 Babbar keeps up Amar blast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 6: Actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar today kept up his tirade against Amar Singh, pushing the mercury up in the ruling Samajwadi Party amid speculation that the Agra MP was planning to switch loyalties to the Congress.

 Babbar, who met reporters in the Uttar Pradesh capital, said he would not back out on what he had said about the Samajwadi Party general secretary last Saturday. He is a fixer and merely serving his own business interest using the party banner, he said.

 But the actor appeared isolated as angry Samajwadi Party leaders rose in chorus to condemn his outburst.

 Yesterday, party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav wanted to know at a meeting what the Agra MPs contribution to the party was, though he did not take his name. Another senior MP, Mohan Singh, sought a probe to find out if Babbar was acting for the CIA as the party was planning to demonstrate against US President George W. Bush during his coming visit to Agra.

 Another general secretary of the party, Ram Gopal Yadav, said if the unwarranted remarks are tolerated, it would affect party discipline. Such a statement is extremely unbecoming of a senior leader who is a member of the Lok Sabha on a party ticket, Yadav said.

 Babbar, however, pressed on with his attack. He (Amar) has brought a bad name to the chief minister and it was because of him that a speculation on Mulayam Singh Yadavs alleged link with the BJP began to spread. Till such elements are weeded out of the party, I will continue my crusade, he said.

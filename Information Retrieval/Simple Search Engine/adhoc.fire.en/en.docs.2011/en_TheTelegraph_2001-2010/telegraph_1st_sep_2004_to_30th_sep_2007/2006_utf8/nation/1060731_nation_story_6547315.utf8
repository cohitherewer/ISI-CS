 Rain puts two states on edge

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai/Ahmedabad, July 30: Marooned villagers, submerged highways and stranded trains in Gujarat and Maharashtra today brought back memories of a year ago when rain and floods had killed about 1,000 people in the region.

 Maharashtra, the sufferer in the July 2005 deluge, issued a flood alert in the western districts and carried out evacuations with army help as rain battered the coast for three days at a stretch and the discharge from dams flooded villages and cities.

 Gujarat, which has reported 10 deaths, moved over 71,000 people to safety away from low-lying areas in its southern and central districts of Navasari, Surat, Bharuch and Vadodara. Some 77 villages were flooded and 400 were without power in Surat and Dangs.

 All major towns, except in Kutch, witnessed heavy rain with Morbi in Saurashtra recording the highest of the season at 204 mm. State relief commissioner Rajkishore said 24 dams were overflowing, 45 were 85 per cent full and another 54 were 75 per cent full.

 The rain eased at some places in the afternoon and evening, but met office predictions of more downpours in the next 48 hours kept both state governments worried.

 Some 18,000 people are believed to be marooned in Maharashtras Pune, Nashik, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Solapur districts, where links with several villages have been cut off.

 The army evacuated over 15,000 people along the banks of the Krishna, Koyna, Indrayani, Mula and Mutha as their waters rose near the danger mark, and rescued more than 3,000 from the submerged Shigaon village in Sangli.

 Parts of Pune city were flooded by the twin rivers of Mula and Mutha, whose rising waters spread panic. 

 The rain has stopped and less water is being released now. The administration is on full alert to deal with the situation. Things are under control, deputy chief minister R.R. Patil said.

 Thousands of passengers were inconvenienced as the railways cancelled or rescheduled trains on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad and Mumbai-Surat route. The Karnavati Express, Sayyajinagar Express, Bhavnagar Express, Saurashtra Janata Express and Surayanagari Express were cancelled, while the August Kranti Express, Saurashtra Mail and Golden Temple Express were delayed. Some 25 others were stranded at various stations.

 The Koyna dam released over 1.5 lakh cusecs of water, raising the level of the Krishna. Over 1 lakh cusecs discharged by Ujani dam in Solapur led to floods in Pandharpur town. The smaller Gangapur, Dharna and Vaitarna dams released over 1.2 lakh cusecs.

 Sangli collector Rajendra Chavan said four army teams had been deployed in the low-lying areas of the district for relief operations.

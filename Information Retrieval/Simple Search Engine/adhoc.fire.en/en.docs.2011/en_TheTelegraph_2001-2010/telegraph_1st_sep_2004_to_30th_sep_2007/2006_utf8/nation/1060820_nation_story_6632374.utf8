 SP MLAs axed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Aug. 19: Four of the five rebel Samajwadi Party MLAs who cross-voted in the recent Rajya Sabha polls and attended a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) meeting lost their seats today.

 The Speaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Mata Prasad Pandey, disqualified Omvati Devi, Sunderlal, Aratan Lal Ahirwar and Kalyan Singh Doahre. He reserved his judgment on Kamlesh Pathak, who also defied his party whip. His case will now come up for hearing on August 21. 

 The Speaker ruled the action of the four MLAs violated Article 2 (1)(A) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. This warranted disqualification from the Assembly. 

 Pronouncing his 31-page judgment here today, Pandey said hearings held for the four MLAs showed they had voluntarily left the Samajwadi Party. He cited a Supreme Court verdict that said disloyalty to the parent party was tantamount to leaving it. By cross-voting, the MLAs proved they had left the party, the Speaker said. Their plea for renewed hearings was also rejected.

 The order takes the number of MLAs barred in the past three months by the Speaker to nine. Five Loktantrik Bahujan Dal members lost their seats in June for rejoining BSP.

 After the exit of the four MLAs, the ruling Samajwadi Partys strength has fallen to 152 in the 392-member Assembly.

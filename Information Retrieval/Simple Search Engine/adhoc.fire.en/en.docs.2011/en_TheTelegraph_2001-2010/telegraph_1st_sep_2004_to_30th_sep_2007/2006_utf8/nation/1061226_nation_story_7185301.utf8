 Das Munshi: Concession call

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has requested Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to try and see whether some concessions can be given to Mamata Banerjee so that she can call off her fast on the Singur issue.

 Last night, Das Munshi visited Mamatas sit-in venue to convey Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs request to call off the fast. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief turned down the appeal while a section of her party booed the central minister.

 On his return from Esplanade, Das Munshi requested the chief minister to consider Mamatas demand that the land acquired without consent be returned. That would allow her to call off her fast, he is learnt to have told Bhattacharjee. 

 At the Bengal CPM headquarters, Bhattacharjee discussed Singur today. But sources said the party was backing the governments claim that only a very small portion of the land for Tata Motors had been acquired without owners consent.

 Industries minister Nirupam Sen is likely to release the list of consent awardees tomorrow to substantiate the claim.

 I want a dialogue with her as well and the contentious issues can be settled if she or her representatives come for talks. I will discuss the concession to Mamata in the party, the chief minister told Das Munshi last night.

 A Trinamul MLA said the party is expecting a letter from the chief minister by tomorrow, the hope stemming from Das Munshis conversation with the chief minister. We are in touch with Priyada and there is reason to be hopeful. There should be an immediate end to the impasse as Mamatas health is failing, he added.

 The Trinamul chief did not speak today because of her failing health. 

 The Congress leadership condemned Trinamul supporters send-off to Das Munshi last night. He is a Union minister and had been sent by the Prime Minister to request Mamata to call off the fast. How could Trinamul activists shout slogans against a Union minister expressing concern over their leaders health? This is not done and our party condemns the act, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said today.

 Trinamul MP and general secretary Mukul Roy, however, blamed outsiders for the incident. Our leaders have a lot of regard for Priyada, he said.

 BJP president Rajnath Singh is likely to make his second visit to Mamatas dais tomorrow. His earlier visit had distanced the Congress from Mamatas agitation.

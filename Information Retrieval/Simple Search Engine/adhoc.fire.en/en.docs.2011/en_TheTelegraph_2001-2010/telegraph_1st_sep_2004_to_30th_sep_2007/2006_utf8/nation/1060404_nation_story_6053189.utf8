 Joshi back, despite Advani

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 3: The RSS today managed to get its pracharak Sanjay Joshi re-appointed in the BJP despite reported opposition from L.K. Advani.

 Joshi had stepped down a party general secretary after a CD, allegedly showing him having sex, surfaced in January this year. The BJP has claimed that Joshi was exonerated last week after forensic tests confirmed that his face did not match that of the man in the CD.

 Joshi has been reinstated as general secretary (organisation). We welcome Sanjay Joshi in the BJP. His name has been cleared in the unseemly controversy he had been dragged into. There is no reason for him now to stay away from active party work, party president Rajnath Singh said this morning.

 Rajnath has been as keen to bring Joshi back into the party fold as Advani is opposed to it.

 The reasons are simple. Joshi was a key voice in the chorus against Advani and had ensured that he quits as party president after the Jinnah controversy erupted.

 Rajnath badly needs a strong supporter in the party. He does not have many friends among the BJPs second-rung leaders. None of the senior leaders ? like Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Pramod Mahajan ? has helped Rajnath counter Advanis recent efforts to hijack the partys political agenda.

 In spite of the Sanghs full backing, Rajnath is in desperate need of a senior partner who can guide him. In Joshi, he sees an adviser. The post of general secretary (organisation) had, therefore, been left vacant during investigations into the sex CD case.

 Some senior leaders have alleged that the former BJP chief made a last-ditch attempt to block Joshis re-entry in the party. 

 Advani threatened to cancel his yatra if Joshi was taken back in the BJP, said one of them.

 However, others brushed aside the claim. The RSS did not want Advaniji to start the yatra in the first place. Why should they be threatened if says he wont go on the yatra now? asked a leader.

 Joshi reiterated that the RSS has full faith in him.

 Danish leg-up for weavers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Varanasi, July 2: Tragedies often bring in their wake unexpected friends.

 Ask the weavers of Peelikothi in this silk city, and theyd vouch for it.

 Known for their magic fingers, they have got a much-needed boost from a famous Danish company, which has stepped forward to help them tide over their losses after the March 7 blasts.

 The company, Bestsellers, which designs and sells its own clothesline internationally and has a staff strength of 14,000, has decided to buy silk stoles ? scarves with intricate designs ? woven by these artisans and gift them to professionals back in Denmark.

 Bestsellers often buys exquisite designs from outside through agents in various companies. In India it has hired Upasana, a Pondicherry-based designing studio which caters to the international market, to make these bulk purchases. The designs will be provided by Meera Mehta, who once styled the tail of British Airways planes.

 This is not the first time the Danish company has tried to keep afloat the creative urge in regions struck by tragedy, natural or man-made. Last year, it presented as Christmas gifts to its employees works of art by women from tsunami-affected villages of Tamil Nadu. They included terracotta whistles and motifs carved out of paper mats, semiprecious stones and spices, all wrapped in gift packs made from banana fibre.

 This time they (the Danish company) have come to know from newspapers the plight of the artisans in Varanasi after the blasts. The artisans remained jobless because of an atmosphere of fear that continued for some time, said Mehta, who is camping in the city now.

 Bestsellers has decided to place an initial order of 10,000 stoles, says Poonam, who has come down to Varanasi with Vimal, a fellow designer from Upasana.

 The two designers visited the Peelikothi area with a German professional, Dorothee, who is working for the Pondicherry-based quality control agency Decko, and met the artisans for a preliminary study.

 The visit also served another purpose: the two got a firsthand experience of the plight of the weavers, who had already been in distress because of the ill health of the Varanasi silk industry. The blasts added to their misery as foreign bulk buyers stayed away.

 A team led by top officials of Bestsellers will shortly be in the city to finalise the deal with the weavers, says Vimal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Rosy report replaces grim dossier

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, 

 Nov. 27: The industries department has shelved 

 a report that sought to portray Bengal as land-critical, 

 substituting it with another that compares the state favourably 

 with others on the farm front.

 The report, titled the Status of Land in Bengal, will be tabled in the Assembly this week by the land and land reforms department.

 The original draft prep- ared by land and land refor- ms commissioner Sukumar Das had suggested that Beng-al be declared a land-critical state.

 Officials said the new report has been prepared by industries minister Nirupam Sens planning and development department under the leadership of state land use board chairman V.K. Ramachandran.

 The debate has more to do with the divisions within the Left than with economics as, in a globalised world, a particular region need not produce all the food its people consume. 

 A section of the CPMs peasant lobby, led by land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, has been warning of a food crisis if farmland is used up for industry.

 Agriculture land accounts for 60 per cent of Bengals land area of 2.19 crore acres, against the national average of 43 per cent. 

 Sen had said earlier that the government will have to bring in industry to provide employment to a large number of people who are now solely dependent on land.

 The land which the Left Front government distributed to small and marginal farmers decades ago has been divided as families have grown since then. The holdings are getting smaller and the pressure on land is growing. But the incomes are not growing at the same rate. Unless the industry and service sectors expand, we cannot thrive on agriculture alone, an official said.

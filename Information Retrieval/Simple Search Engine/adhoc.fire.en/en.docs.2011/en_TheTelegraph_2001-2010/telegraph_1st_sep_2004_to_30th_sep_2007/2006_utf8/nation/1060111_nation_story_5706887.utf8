 Demolition blow to Ulhasnagar

 Mumbai: Governor S.M. Krishnas 

 decision to return an ordinance that sought to regularise 

 illegal structures in Ulhasnagar has again left residents 

 wondering about their fate, reports our special correspondent.

 The return of the ordinance yesterday has delayed a plan by the Vilasrao Deshmukh government in Maharashtra to hurry through with the controversial decree.

 Raj Bhavan sources said the governor has sought clarifications on whether it would amount to contempt of court to promulgate the ordinance as the case was sub judice.

 Bombay High Court had on December 7 re-ordered the demolition of Ulhasnagars 855 illegal buildings and asked for a report by the second week of January. 

 With Krishna away till Thursday, government sources said the ordinance may not be promulgated before the court hearing. 

 Arjun fires Indira salvo

 New Delhi: Human resource development 

 minister Arjun Singh has hinted that the battle over granting 

 minority status to Aligarh Muslim University is far from 

 over, reports our special correspondent.

 On receiving a certified copy of the judgment of the high court, we would decide on steps required to find a way to uphold the commitment of Smt. Indira Gandhi about AMU being a minority institution, says a statement issued on Tuesday by the ministry and signed by Singh.

 On January 6, a double bench of Allahabad High Court had upheld its single-judge order dubbing AMUs minority status unconstitutional. 

 Infant stolen

 Madurai (PTI): The four-day-old baby 

 girl of a blind couple was stolen from the maternity ward 

 of the government-run Rajaji hospital here, police said 

 on Tuesday.

 Mareeswari, 20, wife of telephone booth operator Muthumanickam, said in her complaint the baby was stolen by a woman who had volunteered to help her.

 Fake cops held

 Jammu (PTI): Police arrested two youths 

 on Tuesday for impersonating traffic constables on the Jammu-Srinagar 

 national highway at Ramban in Doda district, sources said. 

 They were extorting money from truckers and other drivers 

 for the past two months.

 Philippine flights

 Manila (AFP): Philippine Airlines has 

 said it will stop flying unprofitable routes such as Riyadh 

 and Kuala Lumpur but will revive services to India and increase 

 flights to the US. It may start flying to Mumbai this year 

 or early 2007.

 The government notified on Tuesday the banknote press at Madhya Pradeshs Dewas would continue as a public utility service for another six months to prevent a sudden strike by workers.

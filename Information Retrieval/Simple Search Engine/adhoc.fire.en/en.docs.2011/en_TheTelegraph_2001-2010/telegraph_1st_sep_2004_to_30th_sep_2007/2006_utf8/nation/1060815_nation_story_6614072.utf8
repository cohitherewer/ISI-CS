 Fury after rain fury

 NISHIT DHOLABHAH

 Surat, Aug. 14: Ashrafbhai Panchbhaya goes red with an-ger and abuses flow as they do when a Surati is annoyed.

 His mother Mominbibi and two children Haroon and Jabrej are among the 100-odd residents who were killed when Rabiya Flats, a building in Surats Rander area, collapsed on the morning of August 8 after a wall along the Tapti river caved in. Ashrafbhai survived, somehow.

 Survivors of the tragedy and residents in Rander claimed to have retrieved many bodies. Fire brigade teams from Rajkot and Bhavnagar reached the disaster site only on August 13 morning.

 There were no less than 400 people in the building, said Ashrafbhai. Besides its 150 occupants, neighbours had also taken refuge in the four-storeyed building.

 On August 7, the structure became weak. It went down at around 9 the next morning, not helped by a red flag fluttering on its terrace and calling for attention.

 An army helicopter came after two hours and picked up a few injured but there was no more help, said another survivor, Ishrafil Shaikh, who is from Murshidabad. Seven men from the same district died. 

 Rabiya Flats was the only building that collapsed and yet the attention of the administration was skewed.

 On Saturday, chief minister Narendra Modi visited some areas in the city. BJP legislator I.K. Jadeja claimed that water receded due to a government decision not to release water from Ukai dam.

 The actual and official death toll do not match. A CRPF officer said there were no boats for rescue operations. 

 At Rabiya Flats, more bodies were retrieved on Sunday as anger against the administration mounted.

 Builders Babakhan Bombaywala and Basit Limbuwala are absconding and so is self-styled engineer Naushad Patel. The trio allegedly brib-ed government officials to erect the building.

 They have to be nailed. The beam was 12 inches instead of 22 inches, said Ashrafbhai.

 In the rest of Surat, people keep picking up the pieces, whether discoloured clothes or broken slippers.

 Bhopal rain

 Bhopal was today buffetted by the heaviest rain in 70 years, which left 22 people dead. The Met department said over 40 cm of rain was recorded in the last 24 hours.

 Bill to shield kids from police

New Delhi: The government has decided to table 

two bills in Parliaments monsoon session to reform the criminal justice 

system for juveniles and give more teeth to the National Human Rights Commission.

It redefines juvenile as persons under the age of 18. At present, boys under 16 

and girls under 18 are considered juvenile. 

 The bill makes it mandatory to produce a juvenile before the Juvenile Justice Board within 24 hours of arrest and eliminates the role of policemen in dealing with them. 

 The second legislation amending the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, will empower the NHRC to carry out surprise jail visits to inspect the living conditions of undertrials and convicts.

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: Nobody danced to the tune of an improvised Kajrare number, thought up by a Sonia Gandhi loyalist for her 60th birthday today. 

 The song was not even played after the pre-release hype over the CD yesterday when a former MP from Tamil Nadu, Anbarasu, called at the Congress headquarters with his special offering for Madam. The CD was perfunctorily released by Congress treasurer Motilal Vora in the presence of a few women from the partys Mahila department. 

 Instead of the appointed hour of 1 pm, the CD was released an hour-and-a-half later. By then, the crowd was tired, hungry and sleepy. They had lined up outside Sonias 10 Janpath residence, next to the AICC headquarters, from 8 on a chilly and blustery morning, waiting in winding queues for a glimpse of their leader. 

 Most had travelled from the southern states wearing little warm clothes.

 However, this was one occasion on which the Congress president insisted on tossing security aside. For five hours, everyone and their aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces came within hand-shaking distance of Sonia, said a party functionary who looked ready to drop. He was among the earliest callers who went in with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his wife Gursharan Kaur and Congress Working Committee members and stayed till the end. 

 Apart from the usual slogans, there were young men in T-shirts proclaiming how the Congress loved Sonia. 

 The Prime Minister gifted her a special volume, In Appreciation, which had an essay on Sonias remarkable political career with letters of good wishes from Singh and other eminent personages. It also had TV soundbites from the aam admi who had benefited from her special rural initiatives, and reproductions of paintings by schoolchildren. 

 The high point of the book, said a Congress handout, was a symbolic motif of a tree in full bloom with 60 gorgeous flowers. The symbolism? The flowers exuded beauty, gave shelter and their roots were deep enough to brave all storms. 

 Sixty varieties of saplings, gathered from all over India, were also offered to Sonia, who promptly asked for them to be taken back to where they belonged and planted. 

 While Sonias morning was spent with the Congress, dinner was a family affair at daughter Priyankas house.

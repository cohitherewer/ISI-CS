 Taslimuddin: Trouble ahead

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Bihar government today told the Supreme Court that it intended to go ahead with the prosecution of Union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin.

 The RJD leader faces several criminal charges, including attempt to murder and illegal possession of firearms.

 Supporting the move to withdraw the 1996 case, the Rabri Devi government had earlier told the court that the case should be withdrawn as the informant had entered into a compromise with the accused.

 But the NDA dispensation today argued in an affidavit that as the charges were serious, non-bailable, cognisable and non-compoundable, the question of compromise did not arise. The affidavit filed by joint secretary (law) Sanjay Kumar contended that it was not proper to withdraw the case at this stage.

 The bench of Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal, Justice C.K. Thakker and Justice P.K. Balasubramanyan asked the parties to file their replies within two weeks. 

 The government was responding to a PIL filed by Delhi Study Group questioning the decision taken on August 13, 2004 to withdraw the case against the RJD leader. 

 The NGO had alleged that the application for withdrawal of the case was filed soon after the Manmohan Singh government dropped Shibu Soren from the ministry. Besides, execution of the non-bailable arrest warrant against Taslimuddin had also been stayed.

 Then joint secretary (law) Rajesh Kumar had, however, submitted that in the event of paucity of evidence, the public prosecutor handling the case was free to file an application for withdrawal of the case under Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

 He had pointed out that the public prosecutor had written a letter to the Araria deputy collector on May 8, 2000, noting that the case be withdrawn as evidence collected by police did not support the prosecution case. Noting that the prosecutor was competent enough to withdraw the case, the law secretary gave the go-ahead on August 13, 2004.

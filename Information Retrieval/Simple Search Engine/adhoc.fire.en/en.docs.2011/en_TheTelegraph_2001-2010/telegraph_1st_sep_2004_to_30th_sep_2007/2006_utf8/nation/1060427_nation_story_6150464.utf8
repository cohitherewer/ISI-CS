 Language wrinkle in nuke deal

 Washington, April 26 (Reuters): The US will stick to its insistence that Delhi adhere to a moratorium on testing atomic weapons as part of a deal that would give India access to American and foreign nuclear technology for the first time in three decades, senior officials have said.

 The testing issue has emerged as the latest wrinkle in the deal, which includes supplying nuclear fuel and reactors to meet Indias civilian energy needs.

 Americas ambassador to India David Mulford expressed confidence the testing issue would be successfully resolved, but acknowledged that the US Congress may not vote on the deal until after the November election.

 The agreement is being worked on and there will have to be some sort of wording arrangement (on testing), which has not been agreed. Its a matter to be discussed with India, he told the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

 A senior US official close to the negotiations said: In working out this bilateral agreement, were going to have to arrive at language ? and I think we can work this out with the Indians.

 He insisted the administration is not rolling back on that commitment.... Were going to maintain our insistence on the moratorium.

 India has not signed the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and has produced nuclear weapons outside international standards.

 In an agreement on civilian nuclear cooperation last July 18, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a unilateral declaration that India would maintain a voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.

 Rather than banning India from testing, US officials say the provision in the agreement asserts the US legal right to halt cooperation under the accord if India tests. The US is bound by law not to assist Indias weapons programme and that will not change under any new agreement.

 What the Indians are objecting to is standard language for nuclear cooperation agreements with the US, a congressional aide said.

 It makes clear that India recognises the US has the right to stop future cooperation and reserves the right to require the return of equipment and materiel pursuant to that right, said the aide.

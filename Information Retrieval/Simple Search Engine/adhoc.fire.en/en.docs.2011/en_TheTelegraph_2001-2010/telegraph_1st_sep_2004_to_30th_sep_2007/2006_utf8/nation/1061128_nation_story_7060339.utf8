 Sitting HC judges off probes

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Supreme Court today ordered disbanding of all commissions of inquiry in which sitting high court judges were looking into issues of public importance.

 A bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said no sitting judge should be asked to conduct a judicial inquiry, and appointments already made should be cancelled. The order would, however, not apply to commissions that have already reached the final stage of inquiry, the court clarified. 

 The matter cropped up during the hearing of a petition concerning students union polls. The court had asked the Centre to place on record the number of sitting judges heading such probes.

 The court said it was not desirable to appoint sitting judges in every case as this was affecting the functioning of the judiciary. 

 The order closes a favourite escape hatch that governments fall back on to stem a public outcry that follows scandals and controversies.

 Cuddalore (Tamil Nadu), Dec. 1: A roar went up at the middle school in Thazhanguda when he arrived. He roared back too, but in laughter, as he shook the little hands that had been waiting to present him with drawings.

 Bill Clinton couldnt have savoured his day out in this coastal Tamil Nadu district as the UN special envoy for tsunami recovery any more than he did this morning.

 I want to see this model copied not only in tsunami-affected areas but around the world, said the former US President. 

 He was referring to the amazing pace at which homes and lives had been rebuilt in this coastal Tamil Nadu district, which faced the tsunamis wrath two years back.

 In Thazhanguda, a village the killer tides changed beyond recognition, Clinton marvelled at the rebuilt homes and schools. He couldnt see a sign of the calamity.

 A lot of the applause was heaped on Gagandeep Singh Bedi, the collector whos toiled on speeding up reconstruction and UNDP-funded tsunami-warning systems. 

 Cuddalore became the first tsunami-hit region to fully rebuild all 2,323 houses destroyed by the tidal waves across 29 fishermen villages. It even has new houses, a lot of it given to Dalits and other weaker sections.

 At a new housing colony that has sprouted with all basic facilities, locals handed Clinton greeting cards. A young woman even presented him a Krishna portrait. Overwhelmed, he broke through the security cordon to shake hands and to ask villagers just how theyd been doing. 

 At the middle school where he received a loud welcome, Clinton saw for himself how kids, used to sitting on uneven floors, now had desks that Unicef had helped provide. Next, he was riveted to a puppet-show.

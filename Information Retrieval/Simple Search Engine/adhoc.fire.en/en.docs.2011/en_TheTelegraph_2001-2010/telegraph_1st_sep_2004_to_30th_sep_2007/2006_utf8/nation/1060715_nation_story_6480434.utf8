 Blast! Its a Lalu joke

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, July 14: This is one Lalu joke Tamil film star Shivakumar could have done without so soon after the Mumbai serial blasts.

 The actor faced police grilling today after a caller from Malaysia ? apparently a slighted fan ? sought to get even by linking him with terrorists.

 The first call had come soon after Tuesdays train blasts ? to the Opposition ADMK headquarters in Chennai.

 Introducing himself as Lalu, a male voice said bombs had been planted in the citys densely populated commercial hubs of T. Nagar and Pondy Bazaar. They would go off last night or today.

 The next few calls, made from different numbers, gave the ADMK a Chennai landline number with the tip that five terrorists from Mumbai were hiding at the subscribers home.

 Party leader and former minister D. Jayakumar noted down the numbers and the country code from the caller identity device and informed police commissioner Lathika Saran.

 The police, who spent the whole of last night and most of today combing the areas mentioned and checking vehicles, matched the Chennai number to the address. It was Shivakumars home in T. Nagar.

 The police found the house locked: both Shivakumar and his actor son Surya were away.

 Later, when the police managed to reach Shivakumar, he told them there was no one at his home and that the caller might have made a mistake.

 A call to one of the Malaysia numbers, however, took the lid off the prank. Lalu confessed to the police that he wanted to teach Shivakumar and Surya a lesson.

 The fan had apparently been trying to talk to them over the phone to discuss a story idea for a film, but they wouldnt take his calls.

 Shivakumar acknowledged that someone had been making calls to his house for the past 20 days. He hadnt taken the matter seriously as we keep receiving such calls all the time.

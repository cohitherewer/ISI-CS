 Fine for lethal medicine switch

 New Delhi (PTI): A homoeopathic 

 doctor who administered allopathic medicines that led to 

 the death of a patient has been asked by the apex consumer 

 commission to pay over Rs 62,000 as compensation to the 

 victims kin.

 Shiv Kumar, a homoeopath practitioner 

 based at Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh, was held liable for 

 deficiency in services under the Consumer Protection Act 

 by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

 Mohammed Jabbar, suffering from gastroenteritis, had visited Kumar for homoeopathic treatment. When his condition did not improve, Kumar resorted to allopathic treatment by admitting Jabbar in his clinic and administered glucose drip and injections that led to his death.

 Lawyer in debar dock

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High 

 Court has held a 75-year-old lawyer guilty of contempt of 

 court for continuing to practise after debarment.

 However, the court, in its October 

 12 order, did not sentence the lawyer, Balraj Chandanani, 

 to imprisonment considering his age. It only imposed a fine 

 of Rs 2,000.

 Chandanani was debarred as an advocate for five years by the Bar Council of India following a complaint lodged by a resident of the city.

 The high court held that Chandananis conduct amounted to interference with administration of justice and he was guilty of contempt of the court.

 The court spared Chandanani a jail term, taking into consideration an unconditional apology tendered by him apart from his advanced age.

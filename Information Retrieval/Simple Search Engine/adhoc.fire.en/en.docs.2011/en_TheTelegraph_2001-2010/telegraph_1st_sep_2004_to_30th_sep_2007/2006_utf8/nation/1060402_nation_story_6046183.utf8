 Bhubaneswar, April 1: The combined force of the state and central police is scouring the jungles of Gajapati in search of two officers, abducted by Naxalites last month, who were on television today.

 Superintendent of R. Udaygiri sub-jail Rabi Narayan Sethi and officer-in-charge of local police station Ranjan Kumar Mallick were kidnapped during a Naxalite raid on the town on March 24, in which three policemen were killed, 40 prisoners freed and stamp paper worth Rs 42 lakh burnt. 

 They are behaving well with us, they are providing us food, said Sethi, 56, sounding miserable as hooded Naxalites hovered in the background. Some of them wore fatigues with PLGA written on them and wielded AK-47s.

 In the interview telecast by two channels, both hostages, who looked exhausted, said the Naxalites have promised not to harm them and asked family members not to worry. They have assured us they will not kill us, Sethi said, adding they were having to move often.

 Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda also appeared on TV to say the attack on R. Udaygiri was launched to loot weapons and free prisoners. We have looted 24 self-loading rifles, one AK-47 rifle, a 9-mm pistol, a .38 revolver, two carbines, a grenade launcher, a signal gun and about 5,000 rounds of bullets. Panda, a former secretary of the Vamshadhara Committee of the Peoples War Group, is said to operate in the forest area near the Andhra border.

 He declared that the hostages will be released only after the government frees jailed Naxalites and tribals, agrees not to allow foreign companies like Posco to set up base here, withdraws central forces fighting Naxalites and creates a forum to give justice to people displaced by industrialisation.

 Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the police are trying to rescue the two officers. The matter is being urgently looked into.

 Director-general of police Suchit Das echoed him, but added the search is not intensive for fear that it might endanger the hostages lives.

 The TV crew said they crossed four hills to get to the hostages and were told not to ask where they were going. 

 The terrain is difficult and very often not even the narrow path which we took to reach the hideout was visible amid the foliage, one of them said. At several places, blockades had been set up with tree trunks.

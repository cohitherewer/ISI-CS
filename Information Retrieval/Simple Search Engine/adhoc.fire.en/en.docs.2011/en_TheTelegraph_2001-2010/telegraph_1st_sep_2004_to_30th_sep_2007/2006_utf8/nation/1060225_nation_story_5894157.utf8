 How will we survive now?

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Hanuman Tekri (Vadodara), Feb. 24: Holding her five-month-old daughter close to her chest, Ashaben, 24, wept inconsolably. She had just heard that a Mumbai court had convicted her husband, Dinesh Jajbhar, with eight others in the Best Bakery case.

 Everyone at ground zero, Hanuman Tekri, had been glued to their TV sets since morning, anxiously waiting for the verdict in the case that has come to symbolise the brutality of the Gujarat riots and had presented a test for the judicial system.

 As TV channels flashed the judgment, people came out of their homes, angry and devastated like Sardaben, Dineshs mother.

 Dineshs elder child, Vipin, is blind but the family cant afford his treatment. Dinesh was the sole earner in the family.

 Now that he has been convicted, how shall we survive? I have two young daughters. How shall I get them married? Sardaben sobbed.

 Amrutaben, 32, wife of Shana Baria, collapsed as she heard the news. Pankaj Gosais wife Deepti, a domestic help, worried about losing her livelihood as no one likes to employ the wife of a convicted man.

 Jostna Bhatt, who lives opposite the Best Bakery, too, was in tears though none from her family has been convicted. She said she was upset because all the convicts are innocent ? a common sentiment in the poverty-stricken neighbourhood.

 Anupbhai, Shailesh Tadvis father, voiced anger at the police, judiciary and opportunist politicians.

 Why dont they shut down the courts in Gujarat? All the cases can be tried in Mumbai, he shouted. How can the Mumbai court find my son guilty when the complainant (Zahira Sheikh) said he was innocent?

 Human rights activists welcomed the judgment as a ray of hope and said they now expected trials to begin in several other riot cases.

 Triumph of justice; the vindication of truth, announced rights activist Fr Cedric Prakash.

 Zuber Gopalani, who was involved in the post-riot relief operations in Vadodara, said: The verdict gives a sense that justice prevails in India. Now we want Zahira Sheikh punished. She played with the sentiments of Muslims by turning hostile.

 Controversial BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava, who had allegedly paid Zahira to turn hostile, reacted cautiously, saying: Im disappointed. Innocent people have been punished.

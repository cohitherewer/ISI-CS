 Jaya cries for a hearing

 Jaya: Letter plea 

 New Delhi, March 7: Facing disqualification from the Rajya Sabha, Jaya Bachchan today urged President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to refer the matter back to the Election Commission for a proper hearing and fresh orders.

 The poll panel has recommended the Samajwadi Party MPs disqualification because she holds an office of profit ? as chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Board.

 Kalam has begun consulting constitutional and legal experts, said a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson. 

 Under the Constitution, the President, in consultation with the Election Commission, decides whether a sitting member of Parliament should be disqualified. Legal experts, however, said the President was bound by the recommendation of the poll panel. 

 Article 102(1)(a) bars an MP from holding any office of profit under the Centre or any state. Although there is no list of posts that constitute office of profit, the Supreme Court has held that if a person derives some benefit from a post, he or she would be liable for disqualification. 

 On Jaya planning to challenge the decision, advocate P.P. Rao said she could move a high court or the Supreme Court only after any action is taken against her.

 In a letter to Kalam, Jaya said the Election Commission had given its opinion in the absence of the most fundamental document with regard to her appointment as chairperson of the film development board, which is lying in a sealed cover under orders of Allahabad High Court.

 It is necessary in the interest of justice to give a copy of the opinion to me, to hear me before passing any orders, her letter states.

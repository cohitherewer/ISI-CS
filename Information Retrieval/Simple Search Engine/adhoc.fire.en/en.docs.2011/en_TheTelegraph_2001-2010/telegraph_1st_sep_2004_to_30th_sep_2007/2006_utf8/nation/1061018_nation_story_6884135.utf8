The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Steel comes calling... 

 - Bengal beckons

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Bhushan 

 Steel and Strips has shown interest in setting up a steel 

 plant in Bengal and the venture could draw an investment 

 of Rs 10,000 crore.

 They (Bhushan Steel) want to invest in a steel plant in Bengal, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings this evening. This followed a meeting with Neeraj Singal, the firms managing director.

 The company was shown both Kharagpur and Purulia as sites to set up the plant, of which it has chosen Kharagpur. There is a land at Kharagpur owned by Tata Bearings. We plan to hand it over to Bhushan after talking to Tata Bearings, Bhattacharjee said. The company, however, said it had not finalised the site.

 Singal said 4,000 acres will be needed in Kharagpur . Nothing has been finalised about the exact location, he said after talking to the chief minister. We hope to identify the land shortly. The plant, Bhattacharjee said, will come up in three phases. 

 In the first, the investment would be Rs 5,000 crore Rs 4,000 crore in the steel plant and Rs 1,000 crore in a captive power unit.

 Singal had doubts about availability of iron-ore as Bengal has no such deposits, but the chief minister said it could come from Orissa. 

 Bhattacharjee said construction 

 on Jindals steel unit, also in Kharagpur, will begin 

 in January.

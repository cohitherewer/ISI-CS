 Tainted ministers

 New Delhi, July 10: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to clarify its stand on ministers with criminal antecedents, reports our legal correspondent.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal asked the Centre to file an affidavit in two weeks stating whether it was for or against tainted ministers. 

 It also fixed a two-week deadline for state governments to respond to a petition by a person named Manoj Narula seeking the removal of several ministers, including Lalu Prasad.

 The court had admitted the petition saying it was an important issue that needs to be examined in the light of constitutional provisions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 SEZ displacement on Congress menu

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Sonia: Concerned 

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The 

 fate of the National Advisory Council and Sonia Gandhis 

 return as its chairperson may hang in balance, but its shadow 

 will loom large over the Congress chief ministers 

 conclave in Nainital on September 23 and 24.

 With agriculture being the theme 

 of the meet, a senior functionary said a key sub-subject 

 will be the need to evolve a proper policy on the rehabilitation 

 of people ousted by the creation of special economic zones 

 (SEZ).

 The Centre is working on a policy, 

 and the Congress has been collecting inputs from its state 

 governments and experts to prepare a blueprint to be discussed 

 in Nainital. A draft national development, displacement 

 and rehabilitation policy worked out by the NAC and posted 

 on its website is likely to be the basis of the blueprint.

 Although the draft came in response 

 to the displacements caused by mega dams like Sardar Sarovar 

 and Maheshwar, the Congress believes it can apply to SEZs 

 as well. The points being looked at are:

 Ensuring the displaced are significantly better off 

 than before, not just economically but also in terms of 

 human development and security.

 Integrating rehabilitation concerns into the development 

 planning and implementation

 Securing the communitys consent before approving 

 a project

 Subjecting development projects that involve transfer 

 of 100 acres or more to holistic appraisal that will focus 

 on its desirability and justifiability.

 The NAC also urges for relocating 

 oustees as an organic whole and not in fragments, 

 giving land to all agricultural families, mandatory employment 

 in new projects and ensuring the new settlements are as 

 close to the factory (or project) sites as possible.

 Sources said with the SEZs fanning 

 controversy in Punjab, Haryana and Bengal, Sonia has shared 

 her concerns not just with party colleagues but other leaders 

 as well. 

 She met Mamata Banerjee last week 

 when the Trinamul Congress leader told her how the Left 

 Front government in Bengal was creating a human 

 crisis by going on an SEZ-sanctioning spree. 

 A Congress general secretary pointed 

 out urbanisation was irreversible and spin-offs 

 like SEZs could not be wished away. He said that though 

 the CPM has demanded a cap on the number of SEZs, zones 

 of 15,000 acres and more must be created if India wants 

 to compete with China. 

 Until Independence, agriculture 

 contributed to 65 per cent of the GDP. Today, it is 20 per 

 cent. But the number of people dependent on agriculture 

 has not diminished. We have to evolve a policy to divert 

 people from the farming sector to the non-farming areas, 

 he said.

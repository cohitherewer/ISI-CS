 Calcutta, Nov. 6: Ten-year-old Ajay Ghosh is suffering from a critical disease and the lower part of his body is paralysed. 

 The boy from Barrackpore was admitted to ward eight of B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children and requires ventilator support. 

 With no ventilator available at the hospital, he was referred by doctors to SSKM Hospital. But to the horror of his parents, a nurse took off the drip. 

 When I asked the nurse why she took off the drip, she said as he had been referred to another hospital, he does not need it, his father Prankrishna, who runs a small restaurant in Barrackpore, alleged. 

 He complained to the authorities and the medical superintendents intervention ensured that the drip was administered again. But that was not before Prankrishna was abused by the security staff, who threatened him with dire consequences if he dared to venture into the compound again.

 Two days after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee visited the hospital following the death of 22 babies in 72 hours, nothing has changed at the hospital.

 Three babies crammed in a cot, lack of drinking water, stinking wards with cats and sometimes dogs roaming, unhygienic toilets and ill-behaved nurses and employees the scene today was the same as it had been in 2002, when 18 babies died in three days.

 There were two more deaths at the hospital today, though the authorities said the babies were brought in a critical state. 

 The government issued a statement that says: Most of the babies were premature, home delivered, exposed to hypothermia due to long travel and of very low birth weight. 

 A committee headed by the director of medical education will conduct an inquiry and submit its report in two weeks. 

 But even as the government scurried for cover, trying to put the blame for serial crib deaths on scarcity of beds and overload of patients, basic services that should be well within reach remained elusive. 

 In its statement, the government claimed that 72 doctors are manning the hospital, 15 more than in 2002. There are 92 nurses and the nurse to bed ratio is 1:3, while for most other hospitals it is 1:5, it said. 

 However, in reality, babies admitted to the general wards still lie unattended for most of the day. 

 Lakshmi Shau of Kankinara wants to shift her 25-day-old son to another hospital immediately. He is suffering from septicaemia. 

 Your son will probably not live, one of the nurses told her to her face. 

 Two-year-old Aritra Singh is suffering from nephritis and has been at ward 11 for the past 10 days. Her mother discovered this evening that his face was scarred with mosquito bites. 

 When we call the nurses at night, no one comes, alleged Hasi Kundu of Habra, whose month-old daughter Piyali is admitted with respiratory distress.

 Health officials said once the new building housing neonatal and paediatric intensive care units is commissioned in January, more doctors and nurses would be recruited. Things are expected to improve then.

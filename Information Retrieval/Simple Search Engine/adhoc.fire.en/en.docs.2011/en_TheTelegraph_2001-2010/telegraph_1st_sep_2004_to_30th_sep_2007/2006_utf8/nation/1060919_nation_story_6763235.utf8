 Tabs on World Bank graft gun

 Singapore, Sept. 18 (Agencies): 

 The World Bank today agreed to give a greater say to member 

 countries in dealing with governance and corruption after 

 India, Britain and others questioned its over-emphasis 

 on these matters at the cost of its core development agenda.

 A communiqu unanimously adopted at the end of the banks development committee meeting said: Given the importance of this issue (governance and corruption), we stressed that the World Bank board oversee the strategy as it is further developed and then implemented.

 Analysts said punitive action, such as suspension of aid on the ground of corruption, would be taken in consultation with the countries concerned.

 The World Bank had discontinued $662-million loans to three health projects in India following charges of corruption but resumed the funding last month.

 World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, backed by the US, has put the fight against graft at the heart of the banks work. But others are concerned that his zeal could slow the flow of lending and punish the poor.

 After lengthy haggling behind the scenes, ministers, including P. Chidambaram, approved a revised plan and said their representatives on the banks board would oversee its implementation.

 China IMF teeth

 The International Monetary Fund today approved a proposal to give enhanced powers to China, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey, voting out opposition from 23 developing countries led by India and Brazil.

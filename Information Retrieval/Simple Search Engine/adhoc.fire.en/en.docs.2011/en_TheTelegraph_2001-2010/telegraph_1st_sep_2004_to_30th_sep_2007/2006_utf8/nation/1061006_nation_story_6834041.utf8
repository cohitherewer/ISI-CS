 Trains graze

 Allahabad, Oct. 5 (PTI): Two trains scraped each other near Allahabad Junction today. No injury or damage was reported as both the trains had been moving slowly. 

 The driver of Chauri-Chaura Express, which brushed past Bareilly-Mughalsarai Passenger, has been suspended on the charge of negligence. He overlooked a red signal shown to him because of the narrow gap between the two tracks, a railway official said. 

 Both the trains resumed their onward journey after railway authorities ruled out any substantial damage to coaches and engines.

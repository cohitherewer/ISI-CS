 Andhra porter to turn watchdog

 Hyderabad, Aug. 1: The ubiquitous railway porter in red kurta and white dhoti/pyjamas will soon do more than just lug your luggage: hell snoop and sniff if youve quietly tucked a bomb away somewhere.

 Three days after Lalu Prasad said only passengers might be allowed to enter stations in future, the railway police force has decided to train porters to spot explosives left on platforms or in compartments and watch out for suspicious elements prowling about.

 Its important that porters, who spend the most time at stations, are trained to spot suspicious elements. If they feel the slightest doubt, they should inform police immediately, RPF chief security commissioner Kamal Kumar said.

 The plan to get porters to double as watchdogs is underway in Andhra Pradesh. It is part of the countrywide effort to step up security at railway stations in the wake of the July 11 Mumbai blasts.

 About 8,000 porters plucked from Andhras stations will be trained in batches of 150 to detect explosives disguised as tiffin boxes, suitcases, carry bags, flasks or volumes of books.

 The porters are better acquainted with the insides of trains and platforms than the police. They can keep tabs not only on suspicious elements but also on erring rail officials, Kumar said.

 Besides, they have a chance to directly interact with passengers, he said. While making small talk with porters, even hardened mischief-makers might give away something crucial.

 Although police have installed closed-circuit TVs at Hyderabads two main stations and four suburban stations, the citys reputation as a hub of ISI activity and a training ground for militants is not letting the RPF rest easy.

 Kumar said the fact that most porters understood the local lingo would be a great help.

 We are keen to help police... to avert Mumbai-type train blasts in Hyderabad, said Mallesh Yadav, a porter of Secunderabad station.

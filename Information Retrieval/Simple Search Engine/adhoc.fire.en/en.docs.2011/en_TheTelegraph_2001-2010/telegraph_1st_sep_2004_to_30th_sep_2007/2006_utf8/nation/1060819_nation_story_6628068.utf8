 Jumbos on ground, air force rejigs fleet

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Indian Air Force today confirmed that more than half its fleet of the heavy-lift transport aircraft, the Ilyushin 76 (christened Gajraj or King Elephant), were not flying but its transport fleet was being rejigged to meet demands.

 The IAF has a fleet of 14 IL-76 aircraft. Only five were fully operational. Six aircraft were being overhauled and three others were due for maintenance needs. By February 2007, the three aircraft that were restricted on the ground for maintenance would be sent for a complete overhaul.

 Air force sources said the aircraft that were not flying have been designated Aircraft on Ground (AOG), meaning they were not being used for sorties to meet operational demands. Air force spokesperson Wing Commander Mahesh Upasani drew a distinction between AOG and Grounding of aircraft. Sources admitted that serviceability of the aircraft is less than 50 per cent. Normally, air headquarters instruction is to ensure 60 per cent serviceability.

 In a rejoinder to a report by The Telegraph (IAFs elephant tied to ground, August 12 2006), Upasani said that three IL-76 aircraft were kept on standby to evacuate Indians from Lebanon last month but the decision to use Air-India aircraft was taken at a much higher level. An IL-76 was being flown with relief for the war victims of southern Lebanon to Beirut early tomorrow morning.

 The spokesperson said it was not true that the grounding of half the IL-76s had thrown military and disaster relief operations into a tizzy. The fact is that IAF has carried out the disaster relief task entrusted upon it with professional dexterity.

 The reason that more than half the IL-76 aircraft are not flying is simple. The aircraft were contracted to fly for 20 years with 10,000 landings and 30,000 hours of flying. The aircraft have completed 20 years with the IAF since induction from 1985.

 Even if the landings and the amount of flying have not been completed, the wear and tear of the D-30KP-2 turbofan engines are much more in Indian conditions because they are operated at the optimum of the flight envelope. The engines had lifecycle terms of about 2,500 hours each.

 The IL-76s were inducted phase-wise from March 1985 and divided among one-and-a-half squadrons number 44 (the Mighty Jets) and 25 A (the Himalayan Eagles). 

 The aircraft are the only ones capable of ferrying the T-72 main battle tank of the army (about 43 tonnes each) and are indispensable in servicing troops in the northern sector Siachen and the Chinese frontier in Ladakh. Besides, the IL-76s are used for weekly courier flights to ferry troops from Leh/Thoise, Port Blair and Guwahati. Part of that responsibility, too, has been shed to civilian airlines (Indian and Jet Airways).

 Air Force sources said talks were on to tie-up spares with Ilyushin Aviation that is headquartered in Moscow. The aircraft were bought from both Ilyushin Aviation and Uzbekistans Tashkent Aircraft Production Corporation (TAPC). But Uzbekistan and TAPC are now no longer part of the same Soviet production system from which India has procured most of its military equipment.

 The IL-76 aircraft are the only heavy lift transport aircraft with the IAF. In the absence of the IL-76s in adequate numbers, the IAF is compelled to use the AN-32 transport aircraft for additional hours to meet the demands on it. Air force sources said that the IL-78 refuellers were also being reconfigured as freighters. The IL-78 is essentially a mid-air refueller on an IL-76 platform. There are six IL-78s with the IAF.

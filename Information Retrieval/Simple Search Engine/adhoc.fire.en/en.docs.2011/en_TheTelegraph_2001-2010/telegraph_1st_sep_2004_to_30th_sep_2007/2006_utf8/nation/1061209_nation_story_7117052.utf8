 Scientist spots deal breaker

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The reconciled version of the Indo-US nuclear cooperation bill finalised by US lawmakers has retained clauses on cooperation on non-proliferation that India had described as unacceptable, Adinarayana Gopalakrishnan, former head of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said today.

 In an early reaction to the reconciled bill, Gopalakrishnan said Section 109 in the final version attempts to thrust the US National Nuclear Security Administration into a joint programme with the Department of Atomic Energy on non-proliferation and safeguards.

 Gopalakrishnan and other former nuclear scientists had claimed last month that such a programme may provide the US an opportunity to snoop on Indias nuclear weapons activities. The presence of Section 109 alone must be considered an absolute deal breaker, Gopalakrishnan said today.

 He said India had unequivocally rejected the clause and that the Indian government had stated it was unaware of the clause until it first appeared in an earlier version of the bill.

 However, the explanatory statement from the US House-Senate Conference suggests that Section 109 is not binding on India. Section 109 is not intended to create an obligation for India to meet, but rather to open an avenue for increased cooperation on topics of concern to both countries, the statement said.

 Other nuclear scientists who had asked the government to proceed with caution on the nuclear deal today said they are examining the reconciled version. Ive got no comments today. Well need time to examine this, said P.K. Iyengar, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.

 PC no to quota relook

 - Govt prepares to answer Supreme Court queries

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram: Firm stand

 New Delhi, June 10: The government has ruled out a fresh look at its quota policy and said it is collating material to reply to the Supreme Courts queries on reservation.

 The material forms the basis for its move to reserve 27 per cent seats for Other Backward Class students in higher education. The ministry has to put together all the material available?. Wait for the material, finance minister P. Chidambaram told a news channel.

 Chidambaram, a member of the Group of Ministers looking into quota for OBCs, said the government has no intention to review its policy.

 He, however, refused to give any details on the response the Centre is planning regarding questions posed by the Supreme Court. The apex court, on May 29, gave the Centre eight weeks to reply to a series of queries on reservation.

 The government will answer in a proper forum, in Parliament, in the Supreme Court (but) not in an interview, the minister said.

 Chidambaram said the government would compile its answers on the basis of reports from various states on the number of OBCs, the Mandal Commissions report and studies by the National Sample Survey Organisation.

 As I understand, there is no ground to review whether there should be reservation or not. There is no ground at all.? If a review means questioning the justification of reservation, I say no, he said.

 Chidambaram said the assurance that Oscar Fernandes, the Union minister for statistics and programme implementation, had given to students that he would examine their demand to set up a non-political commission to review the reservation policy was not the governments position as yet.

 The governments position is the position that will be taken in the cabinet... If Fernandes has said it will be examined, I am sure he means every word (and) it will be examined ... (then) it will come to the cabinet for a decision. I cannot now say what the decision will be, Chidambaram said.

 New Delhi, May 15: Sonia Gandhi today made a second coming to the 14th Lok Sabha, applauded by all Congressmen from the Prime Minister downwards and her family. 

 Sonia was in her usual seat before the House assembled. As she took the oath and signed the roll of members ? less than two months after resigning over the office of profit row ? party MPs continuously thumped their desks in approval. 

 Led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee, Congress members had packed their side of the House today. 

 Son and Rae Bareli campaign manager Rahul sat in one of the middle rows, along with other young MPs.

 From the galleries above, daughter Priyanka watched with husband Robert Vadra.

 The swearing-in of their president ? re-elected by more than 4.17 lakh votes from Rae Bareli ? was the high point of the day for many party members. There was a sharp drop in attendance in their benches when the House reassembled after a 15-minute adjournment, caused by a BJP demand for a debate on Doda killings.

 Also gone by then were Priyanka and Robert.

 Sonia stayed for some time, listening to the Doda debate and taking some notes. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar showed her some papers.

 Outside, Priyanka was mobbed by the media. I am very proud of her, proud of my brother and also proud of the people of Rae Bareli for endorsing her, she obliged.

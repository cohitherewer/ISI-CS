The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Village boss for Rs 1.68 lakh

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 29: If you want to be a village boss and can stump up Rs 1.68 lakh, you might as well head for Tamil Nadus Dharmapuri, where a 53-year-old moneybag nearly became the panchayat chief by quoting the sum before a kangaroo community session last Monday.

 Shanmugham who had successfully bid for the post in Venkatadharahalli village, has been arrested along with four others after authorities got wind of the proceedings.

 He was detained on Tuesday, a day before the deadline for filing of nominations for the October 13-15 polls to the states local bodies, including more than 12,000 village panchayats.

 This is not Tamil Nadus first brush with poll auctions. The scourge first stalked the state in the 2001 civic polls. Shanmugham and others represent a relapse of sorts.

 Polls to the three-tier panchayati raj system are held on a non-party basis, and the chiefs are often elected unopposed after a consensus of village leaders and elders. The apparent unanimity is merely a fig leaf for bidding.

 The state election commission, which holds these elections every five years, is alarmed at the way dominant caste leaders and village headmen have been colluding in the bids-and-offers game over the past few weeks.

 Official sources told The Telegraph that such complaints have come in from over a dozen villages in Ramanathapuram, Theni, Dharmapuri and Thanjavur districts. District collectors are probing specific instances. 

 State election commissioner T. Chandrasekharan has warned that if district collectors find complaints of auctioning true, successful bidders would be arrested under the Goondas Act. They face a year in jail. Polls to such panchayats will be cancelled and the discredited candidates barred for the next five years.

 Bids have ranged from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 11 lakh in villages where competition for the panchayat chiefs post is fierce. The highest bidder who lands the coveted job pours his winning sum into a village fund that takes care of the elders and helps pay for expenses in extraordinary situations over five years.

 In Shanmughams case, the money was to be used for the upkeep of a local temple and to meet village needs. He was almost through, but for the block development officer of Morappur, 20 km from Venkatadharahalli, who came to know of the secret auction. 

 A woman related to the accused, who reportedly played a role in the deal-making, is still free.

 The DMK government has abolished direct elections to top posts in several local bodies. Ward members and councillors elect their heads after the polls. 

 Direct elections are held only in village panchayats, where contenders race against each other on a non-party basis. Polls to other tiers of the local bodies are fought on party lines.

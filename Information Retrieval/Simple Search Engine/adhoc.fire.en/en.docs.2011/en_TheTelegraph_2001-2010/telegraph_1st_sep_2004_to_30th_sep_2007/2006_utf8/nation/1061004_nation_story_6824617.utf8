 7/11 email ID ticks with threat to Pune

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Oct. 3: An email 

 account used by suspects in the July 11 serial blasts in 

 Mumbai is still active, intelligence sources said.

 A new message in the accounts sent folder has said that the next target would be Pune, Maharashtras cultural capital that is fast emerging as an infotech hub.

 Right after the blasts, the police had deactivated an email account used by Lashkar modules that carried out the July 11 blasts. It was called smellfloweryahoo.com. There was another one, though ibn-chandyahoo.ca. The message has been found in this accounts folder, an intelligence bureau official said.

 On October 1, a mail sent from this account to a Pune-based student on the email address nmkhokar786hotmail.com contested the Mumbai polices claim of having arrested the key suspects in the blasts.

 It then goes on to announce that the next target is Pune, the official said.

 The email was sent by one Imtiaz, who has claimed to be a resident of Mumbra on the outskirts of Mumbai, from where many suspects were rounded up after the July 11 strikes. 

 Asked about the email, anti-terrorism squad chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said: I have heard about this. It is nothing but a ploy to distract the investigators when the case has been cracked and the perpetrators are being rounded up. But we will look into the matter.

 The police did not say why this account, registered under Yahoo Canada, was not deactivated.

 The police got wind of the email ID during the interrogation of Mohammed Ali Chhipa, a suspected Lashkar operative and computer hardware engineer arrested in Delhi.

 Chhipa was caught with 4.5-kg RDX in May, days before the huge explosives haul in Aurangabad. 

 Ibn-chandyahoo.ca was used for communication between Chhipa and his Dhaka-based aide, Rahil Shaikh, according to the police. The account is registered under the name Alibaba Chhipa.

 Rahil was wanted in Mumbai. He was one of the accused in the Aurangabad arms haul. Rahils two partners in the Aurangabad arms case, Fayyaz Kagzi and Zabiuddin Ansari, were aides of Faisal Shaikh, Lashkars western India chief. Faisal is the prime accused in the July 11 blast case and is in police custody, an officer said.

 He added that there is no proof against Rahil in particular, though he introduced Kagzi and Ansari to Fayyaz.

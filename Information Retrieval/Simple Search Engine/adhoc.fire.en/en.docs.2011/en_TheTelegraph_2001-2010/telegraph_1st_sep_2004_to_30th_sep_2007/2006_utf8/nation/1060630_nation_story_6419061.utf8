 Police can peep into Rahuls mind

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, June 29: The teeka on Rahul Mahajans forehead could not prevent a fall in his fortunes with a special court today reversing a week-old ruling to allow police to do a brain-mapping test on him and fellow accused Sahil Zaroo.

 The police, who believe the test will reveal the whole truth about the events of June 1 at 7 Safdarjung Road, plan to ask the court to also allow a narco-analysis test ? a demand they had earlier withdrawn.

 These scientific techniques can reveal within hours what standard investigation often fails to unearth over several days, officers claim.

 Mapping someones brain involves firing a variety of questions at him and studying how the electrical signals triggered by his thoughts and emotions vary over time. The blood flow in and out of the brain, too, is monitored.

 Although generally used as an advanced lie-detection technique, brain-mapping can help study the minds of criminals and provide hints of the future crimes they are planning.

 Narco-analysis involves injecting a person with drugs such as scopolamine and sodium thiopental ? powerful sedatives that make him incapable of considered judgement. He then feels at ease with the investigators and talks without inhibition.

 But scientists warn that these tests neednt always bring out the truth. Though the police claim these tests are 99 per cent correct, they are actually about 80 per cent accurate, said Vishal Kumar, a scientist at the National Brain Research Centre, Gurgaon.

 This means the results of these tests are not admissible as evidence in court, and can only help in the investigation.

 On July 5, Rahul and Sahil will be informed about the date, time and place of the brain-mapping. The test can be done any day after July 22, at any of the central forensic laboratories in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore.

 The court had rejected a similar plea after the police failed to cite any case where the technique was allowed.

 In brain-mapping, we initially ask the person questions unrelated to the case and observe how much he thinks before answering them. This helps us understand how his mind works, said Ramesh Thakur at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh.

 A sketch of his brain is prepared. Next, he is quizzed on matters related to the case and his brain signals are recorded.

 More blood will flow to whichever part of his brain is thinking. Since each part of the brain has a specific function, the investigators get an idea of the kind of emotion ? such as excitement or anxiety ? the question has triggered.

 Another sketch is drawn and compared with the previous one to determine at what point the subject is likely to have lied.

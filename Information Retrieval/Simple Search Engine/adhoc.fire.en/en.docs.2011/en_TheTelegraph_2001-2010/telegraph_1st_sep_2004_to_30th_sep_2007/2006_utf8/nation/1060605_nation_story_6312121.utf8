 Mumbai, June 4: Bibek Moitra was cremated here today amid allegations by his parents that their sons death was the result of a villainous plan to malign the BJP.

 It is a conspiracy to malign the BJP, and my son has been a victim, said mother Leela Moitra between sobs.

 Unapproachable since news of her sons death broke on Friday morning, these were her first words in public when the body arrived at the familys residence at Kharghar, Navi Mumbai.

 Later, surrounded by hordes of BJP workers, she made a more politically pointed statement. My son has become a martyr to the party and its ideology. I am proud of him. Those spreading false stories about him will not be able to use his name to bring bad name to the BJP for long. The party will go from strength to strength, she told them.

 BJP leaders assembled at the place immediately addressed the media to spread the word. Hundreds of party supporters and functionaries had turned the funeral into a political event.

 Bibeks mother is a picture of strength. Her words are a great source of inspiration and we will not forget what Bibek did for the BJP, said the partys Mumbai leader, Prakash Mehta. Soon after, a few slogans were raised in Bibeks name by party supporters led by Mumbai BJP spokesman Vinod Tawde.

 All the while, Bibeks father, wearing a discoloured vest, vacantly looked on as his only sister, who had arrived from Bangalore on Sunday morning, sobbed.

 BJP leaders Bhai Girkar, Mangal Prabhat Lodha and Madhu Chavan, an MLC, had received the body at the airport yesterday. 

 The embalmed body arrived from Delhi around 10.45 pm and was kept at a government hospital in Navi Mumbai for the night and brought to his parents Kendriya Vihar apartment around 8 in the morning.

 Bibek was cremated at the Turbhe crematorium in Navi Mumbai.

 Srinagar, May 3: From killing fields to cricket haven. If Javagal Srinaths prediction comes true, Kashmir will soon churn out world-class fast bowlers for the Indian team.

 The former Indian fast bowler was here on a talent-spotting mission for the MRF Pace Foundation. A two-day session put 400 local youths to test. Three of them have been selected for coaching at the MRF academy in Chennai.

 Srinath was all praise for the local Sher-e-Kashmir cricket stadium where the talent hunt was hosted. It is one of the best in the world. I especially like the ambience provided by the majestic Chinars that surround the stadium and the overlooking Shankaracharya hillock, he said.

 Asked whether the presence of security personnel was menacing, Srinath said: Now we are used to it.

 The former Test player said there was a strong need for creating the right infrastructure in Kashmir that was crucial for producing world-class cricketers.

 Dalmiya waits in vain for quiz team

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

 April 3: Former BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya today waited for one-and-a-half hours at Eden Gardens to be questioned on allegations of misappropriation of funds but a Mumbai police team did not turn up.

 I had some verbal information that they will not be coming. But still I came in compliance with the court order, Dalmiya said at the Eden, where the Cricket Association of Bengal is based.

 In Mumbai, the additional commissioner of police, K.L. Bishnoi, who heads the economic offences wing, said: Our team will leave tonight for Calcutta. The investigating officer in this case had to attend a court hearing today and, hence, could not leave this morning. The questioning could happen tomorrow.

 A three-member team, headed by inspector Sudhir Mahadik, was scheduled to leave for Calcutta.

 Dalmiya had gone through four rounds of questioning by the economic offences wing in Mumbai and was supposed to face two more sessions in Calcutta from today.

 Asked whether he would appear again tomorrow, Dalmiya said: I will talk to my lawyer, and if he says so, I will come.

 Dalmiya and former board treasurers Jyoti Bajpai and Kishore Rungta have been appearing before the economic offences wing in line with the directive of Bombay High Court, which had granted them interim relief against arrest.

 The officials are also likely to scrutinise documents relating to the BCCI account for the 1996 World Cup in the Indian Overseas Bank, from where the alleged misappropriation is said to have taken place.

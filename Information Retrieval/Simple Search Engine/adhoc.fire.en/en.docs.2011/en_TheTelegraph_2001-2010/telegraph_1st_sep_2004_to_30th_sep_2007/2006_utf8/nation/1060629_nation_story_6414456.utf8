 Miss soap, get cash

 Watchful eye

 New Delhi, June 28: Imagine getting cash back from your cable operator if you miss your favourite television programme because of him.

 The cash-back rule figures among the set of proposed regulations that telecom regulator TRAI has drafted for areas where the conditional access system (CAS) is implemented.

 The telecom regulatory authority is now seeking comments from broadcasters, cable operators and trade bodies on the draft of The Standards of Quality of Service (Broadcasting and Cable Services) (Cable Television ? CAS Areas) Regulations, 2006.

 One suggested regulation says cable operators must put in place a system of compensation and rebates to make up for no signal or weak signal or disruption of service. And customers must be told about it.

 If there is disruption because of preventive maintenance, the subscriber has to be warned 15 days in advance.

 Under CAS, you get your television signal through a set-top box and pay only for the channels you wish to see during the month. Chennai already has CAS. Delhi High Court has asked the information and broadcasting ministry to implement the system in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai as well.

 The draft rules also say if a cable operator does not install and activate a set-top box within 48 hours after you have applied for it ? and does not offer technical reasons for this ? he has to give you a rebate at the end of the month. The rebate will be at the rate of Rs 15 a day for the first five days of delay and Rs 10 a day after that.

 The proposed regulations set several stringent benchmarks for cable operators.

 An operator must set up a help desk which works at least 12 hours a day, six days a week. He must respond to 90 per cent of all complaints from subscribers within four hours, indicating how long it will take to set things right.

 Ninety per cent of all no signal complaints must be rectified within 24 hours. Ninety per cent of all other types of customer complaints must be corrected within 48 hours.

 In any case, no more than three per cent of subscribers enrolled with a cable operator should need to register a complaint for interruption of service each month.

 The draft regulations compel cable operators to give a four-week notice to subscribers if they plan to drop a channel. 

 A three-day warning is needed if the operator plans to shuffle the order in which the channels are seen in homes.

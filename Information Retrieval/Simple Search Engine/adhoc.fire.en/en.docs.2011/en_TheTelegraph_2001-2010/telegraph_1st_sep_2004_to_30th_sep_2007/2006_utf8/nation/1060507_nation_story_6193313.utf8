 Jaya vows to keep promises

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 6: On the last day of campaigning before Tamil Nadu votes in a new government, Jayalalithaa promised to keep all her promises.

 I have the determination to implement all promises made, come what may, including our latest offer of free computers to all poor students who pass the Plus II examination in the state, she said, touring the city with friend Sassikala. 

 In her 36-day campaign, the chief minister ? like rival DMK ? has announced a sop a day, wooing voters with rice, gold and computers. She has also christened 387 babies along the 5,924-km stretch covered.

 The DMK, in a manifesto that appears to have made an impression with voters, has promised rice, gas, colour TVs, power and land.

 It is customary for the DMK leader, M. Karunanidhi, to dole out any number of pre-poll promises. That is not new and this time includes several things, like free colour television sets and free gas stoves for poor households. But I alone am in the unenviable position to fulfil all promises, she said.

 Addressing brief roadside meetings before the 5 pm deadline, she asked: When was Karunanidhi known to have fulfilled the promises made in a DMK manifesto?

 The Veeranam water supply scheme was a pet project of the DMK which later turned out to be synonymous with corruption, while DMKs 1996 poll manifesto promising sugarcane farmers a support price of Rs 1,000 per tonne was only to be forgotten by him, the ADMK chief said, adding that she had implemented both.

 He (Karunanidhi) will make any number of promises but it is left to me to implement them, she repeated, straining a point to discredit the DMKs manifesto.

 Jayalalithaa also fought off allegations that she had borrowed from the rival manifesto. Not at all. My ideas are all original. They have originated from me. 

 The chief minister managed to draw good crowds in the city, long a DMK stronghold.

 Karunanidhi wound up his campaign with a rally in his Chepauk constituency that was attended by former Prime Minister V.P. Singh. 

 He promised new slum tenements in place of the old, dilapidated ones if voted to power.

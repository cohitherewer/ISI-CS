 Fake currency catch from D-camp

 - Woman who operated for don rounded up in southern city

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Hyderabad, April 15: Dawood Ibrahim is miles away, but police have netted a 50-year-old mother of four for alleged involvement in his fake currency racket.

 Parveen Sultana, who lived with three of her four daughters in the city, spending apparently the hard-earned money of her Dubai-based husband Mohammed Yunus, a manager of a multinational company, was arrested near her Hyderabad home early this week and taken to Mumbai.

 Andhra Pradesh police and a team from the Mumbai CID had been keeping watch on Parveen. On Thursday evening, as she alighted from an autorickshaw in front of her Bagilkhana house and handed a fake hundred-rupee note to the driver, the sleuths pounced on her. They later seized fake currency notes worth Rs 2 lakh and also a demand draft drawn in her name from Dubai.

 Parveens name came up after Mumbai police on April 1 chanced upon Shadur Rahman, a member of the Dawood gang, who spilled the beans. Rahman worked as a conduit for operators of the gang involved in circulating fake notes in the country.

 Andhra police sources said Parveen had been circulating fake currency at several points in the city. They said the key woman operator for south India visited Dubai once in every two months. 

 Each time she carried several suitcases of clothes and other eatables in cont- ainers and returned with currency stuffed in most of them. 

 We suspected her twice but the clever woman abandoned the baggage when she sensed our suspicion, said a Mumbai CID officer.

 The police said the kingpins of the D-companys currency racket ? Abdul Sattar and Taj-ur-Rehman ? recruited regular fliers like nurses, executives, political leaders, journalists and housewives of top executives. 

 During interrogation, Parveen confessed that she was paid Rs 3 lakh worth gold and encashable gift vouchers and hawala tickets. 

 Besides being the carrier for the D-gang, Parveen also acted as a collector of ransom for Dawoods kidnapping racket.

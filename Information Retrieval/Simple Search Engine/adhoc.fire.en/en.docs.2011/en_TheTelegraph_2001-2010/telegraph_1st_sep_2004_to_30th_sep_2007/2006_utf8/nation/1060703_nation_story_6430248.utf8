 Plea to disclose PMO riot letters

New Delhi (PTI): The Central Information Commission 

is soon expected to decide on a plea to direct the Prime Ministers Office 

to disclose correspondence between Rashtrapati Bhavan and the then Prime Minister 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the Gujarat riots.

The petitioner has invoked the Right to Information 

Act to get the sensitive documents that the PMO has refused to hand over to the 

Nanavati Commission probing the riots.

 This is the first time since the inception of the Central Information Commission that all its five commissioners would sit to decide a matter which is considered to be highly sensitive in view of the rigid stance taken by the PMO.

 In March, the PMO had twice rejected the directions of the Nanavati Commission to furnish certain correspondence exchanged between the then President K.R. Narayanan and Vajpayee on the Gujarat riots.

 Facility plan for heritage site

New Delhi (PTI): The Archaeological Survey 

of India (ASI) is working with the tourism department to enhance facilities at 

world heritage monuments to make them more tourist-friendly.

As many as 15 monuments will be shortlisted for developing 

facilities such as toilets, roads, lighting and better literature about the sites, 

said ASI director-general C. Babu Rajeev. 

 Steps will also be taken to create parking areas, construct refreshment halls and set up centres where publications pertaining to the monuments will be available.

 The 15 monuments and sites to be taken up under the scheme will be selected on the basis of the number of visitors to these places, Rajeev said.

 Groom attack

Muzaffarnagar: (PTI): A man riding on a horse 

to his wedding was allegedly assaulted while passing through a village lined with

Heat on minister

Jaunpur (PTI): A case of land grabbing has 

been registered against Uttar Pradesh minister of state for social welfare Shailendra 

Yadav and his brother on directions of Allahabad High Court. The manager of a 

college had filed a petition alleging that Yadav and his associates had been trying 

to forcibly occupy 20,000 sq ft of land belonging to the institution.

Bangaru case

New Delhi (PTI): The CBI is set to file its 

first chargesheet in the Tehelka expose against former BJP president Bangaru Laxman 

and two of his aides after a 15-month probe.

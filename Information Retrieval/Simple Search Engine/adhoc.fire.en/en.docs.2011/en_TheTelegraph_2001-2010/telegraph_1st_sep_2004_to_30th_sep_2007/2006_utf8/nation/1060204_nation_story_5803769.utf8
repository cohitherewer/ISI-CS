 Bhojshala: So far so good

 Dhar (Madhya Pradesh), Feb. 3: The Shivraj Singh Chauhan governments deft handling and the mature response of local community leaders prevented a repeat of Babri at the Bhojshala temple-mosque site here today.

 By noon, over 20,000 Hindu worshippers had gathered inside the complex to mark Basant Panchami. Hindus, who claim that the 11th century monument was originally a Saraswati temple, are allowed to pray here on Tuesdays and Basant Panchami. Muslims, who claim the monument is a mosque, can pray on Fridays.

 But with Basant Panchami falling on a Friday, there were fears of a communal clash. The crowd led by Hindu Jagran Manch activists that arrived to pray in the morning appeared to be in an aggressive mood and unwilling to allow Muslims the right to offer Juma prayers. 

 A nervous Kailash Vijayvargiya, the minister in charge of the district, called up the chief minister for orders. Forty-six-year-old Chauhan asked him to follow raj dharma and said the local administration should do everything to ensure rule of law prevails. 

 Within half-an-hour, the police mounted a mild lathicharge and, when a section of the crowd pelted stones, they burst tear gas shells and fired a few rounds in the air. 

 Minutes later, curfew was imposed in Lakkar Petha and other sensitive areas of Dhar. Vijayvargiya said the curfew was aimed at averting any possible clash between the two communities. 

 Hindu Jagran Manch activists took away a portrait of Goddess Saraswati from the complex, raising slogans in protest against the action to vacate the complex. They also hurled abuses at the BJP leadership, asking how a government that came to power on Hindu votes could thrash Saraswati devotees. 

 By 1.45 pm, Bhojshala was emptied and Muslims were invited to offer prayers. 

 Qazi Zakaullah told the Dhar collector, R.K. Gupta, and superintendent of police Praveen Mathur that only 13 Muslims would go to offer prayers. Zakaullah said the minority community was not keen to burden the already stretched police force. 

 When Vijayvargiya said he could accommodate 250-300 namazis, Zakaullah thanked him but told the remaining Muslims to offer prayers at their neighbourhood mosques. 

 The Muslims made another concession saying they would offer namaz on the terrace instead of the sanctum sanctorum. This silenced the Hindu Jagran Manch hawks who had been insisting that yagna fire should not be doused. 

 Maulana Shafi, who led the prayers at Bhojshala, expressed satisfaction. We prayed amid tight security but without any apprehension. The local authorities were sensitive, he said.

 Asked why he chose to offer namaz on the terrace, Maulana Shafi said: We did not wish to disturb the elaborate puja arrangements. Moreover, as Muslims, we do not pray in the close vicinity of idols. 

 The Archaeological Survey of India, which looks after the monument, had set a timetable giving Hindus time from sunrise to 12.30 pm and then from 3.30 pm to sunset and Muslims between 1 pm and 3 pm.

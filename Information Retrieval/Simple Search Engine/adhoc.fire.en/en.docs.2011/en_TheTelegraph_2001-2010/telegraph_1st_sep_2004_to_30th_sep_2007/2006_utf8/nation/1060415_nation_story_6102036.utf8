 N-tests caught US spies napping

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 14: American intelligence agencies were tracking Indias nuclear programme since 1958 but failed to pass on tip-offs about nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 to the US government, the latest declassified documents have disclosed.

 The National Security Archive at George Washington University yesterday released a set of 40 documents, whose original labels range from unclassified to top secret.

 It contains records of various intelligence agencies from Pentagon to CIA and the state department, which relied on resources like human intelligence and overhead reconnaissance to keep a watch on Indias nuclear programme.

 The disclosure has come at a time when the controversial Indo-US pact for lifting restrictions on nuclear trade is awaiting the US Congresss nod.

 The papers show that the CIA got an idea about Indias nuclear weapons programme as early as 1958. It also assesses why the intelligence agencies failed to warn the US about the 1974 and 1998 nuclear tests and makes recommendations to check deficiencies in the system.

 The records, obtained by senior fellow Jeffrey T. Richelson while researching for his book Spying on the Bomb: American Nuclear Intelligence from Nazi Germany to Iran and North Korea, trace the history of the Indian bomb.

 Richelson writes that like France, Israel and several other countries, Indias nuclear path was incremental and prolonged. 

 Sixteen of the 40 papers address two questions: does India have the capability to build a nuclear device? And what is the likelihood that it will do so? A detailed scrutiny of Indias organisations involved in atomic energy activities was carried out to get the answers. 

 The documents talk about verifying Indias technical claims of the 1974 blasts, particularly its yield, and political and technical factors that helped in shaping its nuclear policies.

 The papers relating to the 1998 tests say India had come close to conducting its second test on several occasions but pulled back.

 They cite the 1995 instance when Indian test preparations were exposed by US spy satellites. That may have helped convince US analysts that despite the pledge by the newly-elected Hindu nationalist BJP-led administration to induct nuclear weapons into the Indian arsenal, no nuclear test would actually take place. Thus, an early assessment of BJP policy suggests that a change in Indian nuclear policy was not imminent, Richelson writes.

 A state department document on the assessment of Indian nuclear tests, labelled secret, examines the motivation for the tests, their estimated costs and reactions from the USSR, South Asia, China and near-nuclear powers like Japan. 

 It reports that the impact of the test has been the hardest on Pakistan. 

 China, it concludes, probably calculated that the Indian programme will not alter the balance of power or threaten China for a number of years.

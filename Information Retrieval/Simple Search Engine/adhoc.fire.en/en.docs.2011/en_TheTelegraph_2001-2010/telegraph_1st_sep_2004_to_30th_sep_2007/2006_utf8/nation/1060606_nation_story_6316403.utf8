 Mumbai, June 5: When Sahil Ahmad Zaroo, accused of procuring drugs for Rahul Mahajans late-night party in Delhi, was arrested on Saturday, it was not his first brush with law. 

 The 21-year-old student of Mumbais St Xaviers College ? who is known as a party organiser on the citys celeb circuit ? has supplied his friends more than just drugs.

 The Marine Drive police station has a case lodged against him for selling shahtoosh shawls, which are banned, to many in Mumbais high society.

 Sahils family owns two shops in Hilton Tower, a five-star hotel. One of them sells carpets and Kashmiri shawls, but we always had a suspicion that there could be a backdoor sale of shahtoosh as well. We raided the shop some months back and thats when Sahil escaped leaving behind two shawls. But before we could arrest him, he took anticipatory bail citing his forthcoming third-year BA exams at St Xaviers College, said Dhahnanjay Kamlakar, the deputy commissioner of police, crime.

 In college, too, his slate wasnt clean. Sahil was not allowed to write the exam as he was caught cheating.

 The list does not end here. Soon after, he got embroiled in a brawl at a nightclub. When he found from his high-society friends that the police were making inquiries about him, he jumped bail and escaped to Delhi. This was about a fortnight back, said one of Sahils friends who did not want to be quoted.

 His A-list of friends included top Bollywood actresses and upcoming model-turned-actors apart from children of industrialists and politicians.

 Lawyer defiant

 Sahils lawyer Majeed Memon today said the 21-year-olds reported statement during interrogation that he had got drugs for Pramod Mahajans son Rahul and Bibek Moitra does not hold good, adds PTI.

 Memon said Sahil went to 7, Safdarjung Road ? Pramods official residence ? on Thursday night to meet Bibek for an air ticket to Srinagar from the VIP quota. He added that Bibek, who was the late BJP leaders secretary, was an acquaintance of his client. 

 Moitra had called Sahil to Rahuls residence on Thursday night where he consumed some liquid or powder after which he fell sick. The story that Sahil gave drugs to Moitra is mere speculation, he said.

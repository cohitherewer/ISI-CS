 Gosh! Angelina amp; Brad may split

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Mumbai, Nov. 1: They may be glued together in sickness 

 and in health or, for that matter, in luxurious jets and 

 in rickety auto-rickshaws but Hollywoods hottest couple 

 wont wait for death to do them apart, if an astrologer 

 is to be believed. 

 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in India for the shooting of A Mighty Heart, based on the killing of journalist Daniel Pearl reportedly visited Pune-based astrologer Anand Soni on October 6, who predicted that the couple would separate by December 2007. He also apparently said Pitt would get back with former wife Jennifer Aniston. 

 According to Soni, Pitt and Jolie were accompanied by son Maddox, A Mighty Heart director Michael Winterbottom, actor Dan Futterman who plays Pearl in the movie and bodyguard Mike.

 The meeting was arranged by a Mumbai-based film production house, said Soni, who counts Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Dino Morea, Smriti Irani, Manohar Joshi and Leander Paes among his clients.

 Soni has also predicted that the title, A Mighty Heart, has a negative vibe and will not do well. He has recommended a series of alternative titles Any Victory Will Do, Bold Venture, Brave One, Brave Vision and Dawning Hope are some of them.

 Anistons name came up when Soni was probing Pitt and Jolies past relationships, a source said. Their horoscopes match well, he said.

 Soni is also believed to have told the stars they will not have any more biological children together, although they will definitely adopt a child from India.

 The couple coined Brangelina sure has a mighty heart. They took all the predictions calmly and smiled throughout the meeting, a source said. 

 Soni was not forthcoming on their reactions. She has a beautiful smile, was all that he would say.

 According to the source, Soni was frisked before he was allowed on the sets of the film. His wrist watch and pen were thoroughly checked. 

 Soni is impressed with the couples vast knowledge of Indian astrology. They used terminology that only a thorough astrologer would know. I was very surprised. 

 However, Soni could not say much about Maddoxs future as Jolie could not give the time and place of his birth. 

 I usually ask for three things before doing my predictions the date of birth and the time and place of birth. Without these details, its difficult to predict, the astrologer said.

 On Pitts character traits, he said: Being extremely ambitious, Brad Pitt will go to any extent to get what he wants; which at times may bring him in harms way. He will have new opportunities, but he will have to struggle hard to achieve results. He should not take things easy and needs to work very hard to see cherished dreams fulfilled. He might have to face some emotional setbacks also. His marital life may not be all blissful.

 While Jolies career would see a rapid growth till October 2007, Pitt will be successful till May 2008, Soni predicted.

 Arti Surendranath of Kailash Picture Company, which is managing the films shooting schedule in India, denied that a meeting had been arranged between the Hollywood stars and Soni. 

 We havent done anything 

 of that sort. I dont believe in astrology and will 

 not indulge in anything like this. I, however, dont 

 know if any meeting was arranged by someone else, 

 she said.

 A Cambodian charity has threatened 

 to sue Angelina Jolie (picture top) for breach of 

 contract, saying she had reneged on a promise to give $1.5 

 million to wildlife conservation over five years.

 But Stephan Bognar, the Cambodia-based 

 chief of the stars Maddox Jolie Pitt Project, said 

 ties with Cambodian Vision in Development had ended amicably 

 in December because their aid work was moving on to 

 a new level.

 Angelina and I will be unveiling 

 our new... commitment to Cambodia in about a month, 

 Bognar said.

 Scared students look to home

 SHASHANK SHEKHAR

 Bokaro, Sept. 30: About 

 150 Indian students at St Petersburgs Mechnikov Medical 

 Academy, where Nitesh Kumar Singh was killed by neo-Nazis 

 six days ago, want to return home despite having spent a 

 fortune on their training so far.

 The students have handed a letter to the principal stating their desire to leave, one of them said over phone.

 He said the murder of Nitesh, a sixth-year student from Bokaro, has traumatised the other Indian students, some of whom have faced racist attacks or threats in the past.

 With unemployment rising in Russia, there is mounting resentment at well-off Asians paying for expensive medical education, befriending Russian women and even cornering some of the jobs.

 The students complain that though Nitesh was stabbed near a police station, the police took their time in arriving. The Indians this week protested with placards that read: No to Nazis and Why is everyone silent?

 The Russian foreign ministry has apologised to Indian ambassador Kanwal Sibal and promised measures to prevent such attacks. 

 But the students say neither Russian authorities nor the Indian consulate-general has done anything to improve their security despite repeated appeals after another student, Kishore Kumar Anjani, was attacked in April.

 Yesterday, the students blocked the car of Indian consul-general Jordana Diengdoh Pavel, demanding closed-circuit cameras and a police post inside the dormitory where they stay.

 Some 5,000 Indians study medicine in Russia, about 500 of them in St Petersburg. The courses take up six years instead of the four-and-a-half in India, and provides a diploma that the Medical Council of India doesnt recognise. They have to take the MCI screening test to work as interns and register as medical practitioners in India.

 The students pay Rs 6-12 lakh every year in tuition fees alone. Board and lodging expenses are extra, and with most Russian hostels providing dormitory accommodation without board, the students have to cook their own food.

 Those who opt to be taught in English have to pay much more, said Dr Anshu Kumar, who returned in 2003 leaving behind his practice in Russia. Most Indians, therefore, prefer to learn Russian but the result is not always happy.

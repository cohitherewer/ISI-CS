 After blast, cops get ready to frisk moviegoers

 Hyderabad, May 10: Film buffs, next time you go to watch your favourite stars in action, be prepared to be watched. And frisked.

 Police in the Andhra Pradesh capital are planning security measures like closed-circuit television cameras in lobbies and the frisking of filmgoers in the wake of Sunday nights blast in a hall in the heart of the city.

 The bomb, suspected to be a grenade, exploded as the popular Telugu movie Lakshmi ? starring former Rajya Sabha MP Mohan Babu ? was edging towards interval. The blast injured a five-year-old girl and four others.

 City police commissioner A.K. Mohanty has urged hall owners to instal metal detectors, closed-circuit cameras as well as plainclothes cops. 

 Such measures will help avoid incidents like last Sundays. Thank God, the explosive did not cause much damage in spite of its power, Mohanty said.

 But theatre owners are reluctant as they think such measures would intrude on the privacy of customers and affect their business. 

 Already, 200-odd theatres in the capital are operating at sustenance levels because of the inroads made by video parlours and cable networks.

 We are already in a hand-to-mouth existence and such security will further ruin our business, said M. Bhaskar Rao, the owner of Sudarshan theatre, located just opposite Odean, where the blast shattered the holiday evening mood.

 The slump in the Telugu film industry, which recorded just three hits out of the 45 films produced this year, has resulted in the closure of over 200 halls since 2000, when there were 410 theatres. 

 Nearly 3,000 technicians, junior artistes and stuntmen have been laid off in the last two years.

 Most of the halls now run at 38 per cent occupancy and have reduced the number of seats to almost half their capacity to reduce the tax burden.

 Industry insiders say the security measures being planned are uncalled for.

 Such frisking and the presence of metal detectors and CCTV would only scare away families, women and youths who form the major stock of our customers, said K. Murali Mohan, secretary of the Hyderabad Film Chamber of Commerce.

 At least one indignant film buff echoed Mohans concern. Why should I go to cinema halls at all if I have to subject myself or my family or girlfriend to such indignities? he asked.

 Some others took a more humorous line. The day is not far, they said, when they might have to go to theatres in bullet-proof vests.

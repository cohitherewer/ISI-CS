 Assembly

 Calcutta, June 20: Having lost the status of an Opposition party in Bengal with less than 10 per cent of the seats, the Trinamul Congress will have to look up to the Speaker for the public accounts committee chairmans post, says a staff reporter.

 Trinamul held the chair, which usually goes to the main Opposition party, from 2001 to 2006. 

 At a meeting of the Assemblys business advisory committee today, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said: I am in favour of the senior-most Opposition MLA getting the post. 

 The Congresss Gyan Singh Sohan Pal is the senior-most member of the House.

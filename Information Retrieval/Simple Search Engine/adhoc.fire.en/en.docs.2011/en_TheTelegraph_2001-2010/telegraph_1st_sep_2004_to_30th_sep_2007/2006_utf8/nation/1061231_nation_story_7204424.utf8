 Bottle breaks Gujarat barrier

 Cause for cheer

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 30: Globalisation may have won a small battle against Gandhi on his home turf. For the first time since Gujarat was born 45 years ago, it will be legal to down a glass of whisky in Indias only dry state. 

 The Narendra Modi government today announced just ahead of the Vibrant Gujarat investors summit that the states prohibition law would not apply at special economic zones.

 With the 33 upcoming SEZs the highest for any state spread across Gujarat, this virtually means a partial lifting of the liquor ban.

 In a state where Gandhian stalwarts had merged the freedom struggle with a campaign against drinking, the issue will be divisive. The industry today welcomed the move and the Opposition attacked it.

 Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said: Modi wants to favour industrialists and builders... lack of drinking water is not his concern.

 But former Confederation of Indian Industry state president Sunil Parikh termed the easing of the archaic law the smartest thing the government has done this year.

 At the last Vibrant Gujarat meet, several software firms had told the state government that its prohibition policy was keeping IT investments away.

 The drinking ban was the reason companies in Gujarat held their conferences and seminars outside the state.

 Currently, foreign tourists are almost the only people who can drink liquor in Gujarat, but only with special permission that is difficult to obtain.

 Sources said Modi had decided on a policy change after going through a report submitted by Crisil, a rating agency, but would do it piecemeal to avoid provoking the Gandhians. The chief minister had decided that with the investors summit just over a week away, this was the time to start sending positive signals.

 State home minister Amit Shah explained: As it is, the state governments laws are not applicable in SEZs.

 Congress leader Modhwadia feared that prohibition would now remain only on paper. You can get any brand of liquor illegally even now, anyway.

 That is just what hoteliers like Ashwin Gandhi have been arguing: prohibition makes no sense today. The other states that had experimented with it Haryana and Andhra Pradesh had to reverse the ban. Gandhi, the Vadodara-based director of the Express Groups of Hotels and a CII representative, wants prohibition relaxed also at hotels and restaurants.

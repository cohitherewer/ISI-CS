 RSS assesses Rajnath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 22: From Jaipurs Chokhi Dhani resort where they revealed the path ahead to the newly-appointed BJP chief Rajnath Singh in mid-February, RSS bosses gathered in Delhi today to review his progress and set the agenda for the future.

 A sprightly and much slimmer Atal Bihari Vajpayee welcomed the Sangh leaders to the two-day Samanvay Baithak (coordination meeting) at his residence. 

 RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan was not there, but his second-in-command Mohanrao Bhagwat and three middle-ranking pracharaks ? Madan Das Devi, Suresh Soni and Bhayyaji Joshi ? attended.

 From the BJP, other than Vajpayee and Rajnath, there were L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Sanjay Joshi, Arun Jaitley and Vijay Kumar Malhotra.

 Rajnath has in these few months managed to amend the party constitution to give the Sangh unprecedented power over the BJP. Following the amendment, the strength of organisation secretaries will almost double from the district-level upwards.

 However, the Sangh leaders were understood to be unhappy with Rajnath over Jharkhand where their favourite Babulal Marandi has quit the party. Chief minister Arjun Munda is a Rajnath man, but the RSS is displeased about the corruption charges against his government.

 Another RSS command that has not been strictly followed is collective leadership. Rajnath has tried to send a message by removing Advanis and Vajpayees pictures from party literature. But Advani has more than once stepped on his toes.

 The RSS was unhappy with the way he announced the Bharat Suraksha Yatra without so much as pretence of a consultation with Rajnath.

 The presence of MPs ? Advani, Malhotra and Swaraj ? is being interpreted as a sign of preparation for the monsoon session. The RSS is carefully monitoring the anti-price rise agitation the BJP has recently launched.

 The discussions would continue tomorrow as well, a BJP leader said.

 Happy ending for Udit wife

 Patna, July 28: The drama is over ? Ranjana Jha and Udit Narayan are man and wife. 

 The playback singer today arrived at a compromise with Ranjana, who sparked a furore three months ago by claiming she was his first wife, before the Bihar womens commission. 

 Avoiding the queries of reporters outside the panels office here this afternoon, Narayan walked in along with four personal guards and lawyer Majid Menon. Ranjana had reached the place by then, lawyer Y.V. Giri accompanying her.

 The commission headed by Manju Prakash presented a draft agreement to the duo. It read: Udit Narayan, son of Harekrishna Narayan Jha, has accepted Ranjana as his wife and agreed to provide for her maintenance and upkeep.

 Narayan and his lawyer read the agreement in which the singer said: I, Udit Narayan, recognise and accept Ranjana Narayan as my wife and promise to look after her.

 Ranjana, too, submitted: I have no complaint or grievances against the singers wife, Deepa Narayan, and their son Aditya, born on August 6, 1987. She agreed to withdraw the complaint lodged against Narayan provided Udit continued to support her financially and emotionally. 

 They signed the agreement in the presence of Prakash, who said it was a working arrangement under which the status of Deepa and Aditya would remain unchanged, but Ranjana would also be accorded the status of the singers wife.

 Asked if the arrangement did not violate the law, she said: Narayans two wives had been living under the same arrangement for years. There could have been no better solution at this moment.

 Narayan said after the proceedings: Samjhauta ho gaya (we have reached an agreement). He left amid tight security, refusing to speak to the media.

 Giri, the womans lawyer, said compromise was the best solution.

 Ranjana, who stormed a hotel in April where Narayan was staying with the claim that she got married to him in 1984 in Supaul district, today said in a feeble voice: Jo patni ka adhikar tha, mil gaya (I have got what a wife should have). My fight was for staying together with Udit. I will discuss it with him later.

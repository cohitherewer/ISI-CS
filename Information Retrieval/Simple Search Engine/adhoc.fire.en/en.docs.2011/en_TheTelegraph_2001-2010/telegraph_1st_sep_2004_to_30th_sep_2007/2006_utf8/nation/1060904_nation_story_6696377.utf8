 Arjun runs into IIT protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Arjun Singh

Chennai, Sept. 3: Arjun 

 Singh had a first-hand taste of the anger at the quota legislation 

 piloted by him when a group of IIT Madras students staged 

 a quiet protest as he visited the campus.

 In a peaceful display of solidarity against the quota bill, which was recently introduced in Parliament and referred to a standing committee, the students sprang a surprise by quickly forming a human chain as the human resource development minister was leaving the auditorium.

 The bill proposes 27 per cent reservation for other backward classes in higher education institutions like the IITs.

 Singh was in IIT Madras to launch the first phase of a national programme to deliver satellite-based instruction to engineering students.

 As he was stepping out of the central lecture theatre, the minister was met with the symbolic protest. They shouted no slogans or created any problems for the minister, a police official said. 

 This was the first time since the quota controversy broke that Singh had been to an IIT or an equivalent higher education institution.

 A protester said: The administration tried to stop us from staging a protest. So we had to form a human chain in an impromptu manner.

 He said around 400 students helped form the chain. 

 We could hold such a protest inside the campus. Outside, it is unthinkable because the pro-quota group is too strong in Tamil Nadu, another student said.

 The minister might have been a little surprised to face a protest in Chennai, the quota supporters bastion.

 IIT students, however, come from all over India. Several of the protesters, from a cross-section of departments, were from other states.

 They felt strongly about the quota bill but, sources said, true to IIT tradition the protest was organised in a very cultured manner.

 There was no attempt to stop Singhs convoy as the students assembled in an orderly fashion and expressed their protest, the sources added.

 A professor at IIT Madras said: You cannot always expect people to comply. It is a mature society. And, true to IIT tradition, the students have demonstrated peacefully.

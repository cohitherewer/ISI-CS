 Train jumps rails 

 Bijnore (Uttar Pradesh), Feb. 26: At least 36 passengers were injured when the Howrah-Amritsar Express derailed near here late last night, disrupting railway traffic in the Lucknow-Dehra Dun section, says our special correspondent.

 Eight general bogies of the Amritsar-bound train jumped tracks around 1 am near Nagina station in Bijnore, completely damaging about 300 metres of track, railway sources said. 

 A relief train was immediately rushed from Moradabad to bring the passengers, the sources said. Several long distance trains like the Jammu-Tawi, Himgiri Express and the Howrah-Dehra Dun Express have been diverted while some others were cancelled.

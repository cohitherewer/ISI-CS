 Racer nerves behind Tanya killers dash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gururaj Kishore

 Bangalore, July 30: Gururaj Kishores nerves were steady enough for him to drive his Honda City at 100 kmph for two-and-a-half hours on Tuesday night with the blood-splattered body of colleague Tanya Banerjee beside him.

 The 27-year-old, who claims he stabbed his BPO colleague 33 times in the car in a fit of rage, has explained to police that he is an ace driver and has taken part in races and rallies.

 Tanyas body was found on the highway to Mangalore 230 km from here. Kishore has confessed to having driven non-stop from Bangalore, where he killed her, till Sakleshpur where he dumped the body.

 I was a race car driver; I have participated in many events, he told them.

 Just the previous week, Kishore had driven to Dharmasthala on the same highway with his friends. The police are trying to find out whether he had been on a reconnaissance mission, which would mean the crime was premeditated.

 Kishore has stuck to the claim that he lost his mind during an argument that followed Tanyas spurning of his marriage proposal, for the umpteenth time.

 I wanted to reform her, is what he has been telling his interrogators.

 Kishore says he knew the 31-year-old Tanya was meeting other men. I also knew she had an earlier live-in relationship. Still, I loved her and wanted to marry her.

 Bangalore additional commissioner of police Bipin Gopalakrishna said the man seemed to have been besotted with Tanya. Otherwise, how can one explain that he bought a Honda City just for her? He told us he paid Rs 8,000 as EMI for the car while Tanya filled the petrol. Despite knowing her background, he was adamant that he could get her to change her ways and wanted to settle down with her, Gopalakrishna said.

 The police, who have Kishore in their custody for a week, have taken him to Shiradi Ghat in Sakleshpur to hunt for Tanyas mobile and the kitchen knife the young man says he used on her. Kishore had thrown both out of the window.

 He says he had bought the knife a few days earlier for his mother but had forgotten it in the car.

 On Tuesday, hours before the murder, Kishore had driven to Nandi Hills, a hilly picnic spot 65 km from Bangalore, with his friends. They had beer and came back in the evening. As usual, after Tanyas shift was over, Kishore picked her up from office and drove towards Sadashiv Nagar where they parked in a quiet corner.

 When he stabbed her around 11 pm, there were no pedestrians in sight, he says. The police say the window tints were so dark that even if someone had peered in, they would not have seen what was going on.

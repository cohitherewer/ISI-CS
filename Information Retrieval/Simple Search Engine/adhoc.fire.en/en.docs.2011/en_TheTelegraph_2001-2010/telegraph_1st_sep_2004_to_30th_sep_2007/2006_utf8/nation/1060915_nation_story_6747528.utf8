 Singur talks gesture

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: The government is willing to discuss the demands of Singur farmers and win their cooperation in the land acquisition for the Tatas small-car plant.

 We will fulfil all demands pertaining to infrastructure improvement, employment and rehabilitation of farmers. But, farmers have to hand over land first, commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said here today. 

 Tata Motors, which wanted the land in July, has readied a Bengali video presentation of the welfare plans for people in Singur.

 Sen said the three factories and a cold storage located on the land earmarked for the planned car factory will have to shift.

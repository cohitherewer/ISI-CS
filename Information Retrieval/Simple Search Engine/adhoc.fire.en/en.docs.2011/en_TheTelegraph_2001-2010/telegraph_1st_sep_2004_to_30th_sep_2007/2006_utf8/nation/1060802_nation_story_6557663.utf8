The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Govt in security cry for Indians 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Delhi today asked Kathmandu to ensure the safety of all Indian entrepreneurs in Nepal after some of them received extortion and death threats from Maoist rebels.

 The ministry of external affairs said the Indian embassy in Kathmandu had received a complaint from Rakesh Wadhwa, executive director of the Nepal Recreation Centre, about the threats. .

 Although only one complaint has been received, incidents of extortion have been reported from the Hitoda-Birganj belt, Indian officials said. According to the ministrys assessment, the targets are Indian joint ventures and individual businesspersons. 

 Sources said the Indian embassy is in touch with the Nepal government and has sought prompt investigation into the cases.

 India wants to prevent a situation in which threats against its nationals spread across the nation. There has been a history of anti-India sentiments in Nepal. About two years ago, an alleged statement by actor Hrithik Roshan triggered widespread protests.

 Delhi, however, said the situation was not alarming.

 The threats to Wadhwa came from the Maoist All Nepal Hotel and Restaurant Workers Union. The organisation asked him to leave the country and warned that if he does not, he would be thrown out. 

 Several Indians work in casinos and in other joint-venture establishments in Nepal. Embassy officials fear that the threat might lead to widespread exodus of Indian nationals. 

 At the moment, it is restricted to a particular region and Delhi wants Kathmandu to prevent the threat from spreading. 

 There were reports of another incident, too, in which members of a Maoist workers union threatened an Indian employee of a Kathmandu casino.

 The cases need to be investigated and the guilty brought to book, the officials said to reassure the Indian business community in the Himalayan country.

 The threats have come at a time when Nepal is reeling under an economic crisis after the recent pro-democracy struggle. India has promised to bring the economy back on track with a comprehensive aid package. Many Indians are involved in several development projects in Nepal.

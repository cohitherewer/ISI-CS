 Fire breaks out in Meerut mall

 Meerut (PTI): A fire broke out in a mall-cum-multiplex 

 packed with shoppers and filmgoers in an upmarket Meerut 

 locality on Monday night. 

 There was no report of any casualty.

 Fire tenders had managed to control the fire, which broke out around 7.15 pm from a suspected short-circuit, but it suddenly erupted again and spread to the first floor of PVS Mall in Shastri Nagar.

 Eighteen fire engines battled for about five hours to control the blaze.

 Army ana paramilitary personnel helped the fire fighters control the blaze, which led to the explosion of LPG cylinders in restaurants at the mall. 

 Inspector-general of police Naren Bahadur Singh said no one was trapped inside the smoke-filled three-storeyed building.

 Praveen to change lawyer

 Mumbai (PTI): Praveen Mahajan, accused 

 of killing his elder brother, BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, 

 has distanced himself from his lawyer for making a bail 

 plea in Bombay High Court without his consent.

 Sources said Praveens counsel Nandkumar Rajurkar had been making statements without his consent. Even the bail application made in Bombay High Court recently was not done with the consent of Praveen, his brother-in-law Prasad Pulliwar said.

 Praveens family members said they were not consulted by Rajurkar who, they alleged, has not met Praveen ever since he took up his case.

 Rajurkar said he has decided to withdraw from the case fearing danger to his life and property. 

 Lawyer jailed

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 sentenced advocate Kuldeep Mansukhani to five months in

 a favourable order.

 The court, however, granted Mansukhani four weeks to appeal against the verdict before the Supreme Court.

 murdered allegedly by her son in Saraiya village of Uttar 

 Pradesh, police said. Virendra reportedly demanded money

 Molester jawan 

 Jammu (PTI): An army jawan has been 

 arrested for allegedly trying to rape a 16-year-old in the 

 Khour border belt of Jammu district. Devinder Singh had

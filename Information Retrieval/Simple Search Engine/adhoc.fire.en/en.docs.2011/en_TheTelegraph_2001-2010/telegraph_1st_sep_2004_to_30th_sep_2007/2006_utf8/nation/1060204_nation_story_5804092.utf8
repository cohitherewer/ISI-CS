 Upgrade scheme for Rajdhanis

 New Delhi (PTI): The Indian Railways scheme for automatic upgradation of passengers, which was launched on January 26, will be extended to all Rajdhani Expresses from February 6 and is estimated to fetch Rs 500 crore annually.

 It has been decided that the scheme to upgrade full fare paying passengers to the next higher class against the available vacant accommodation may be extended to all Rajdhani Express trains, a ministry source said.

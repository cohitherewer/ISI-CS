 Ploy to divide: BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Nov. 30: The BJP has slammed the Sachar Committee report, going as far as calling it the UPAs instrument to communally divide the country.

 Party spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said the real motive behind processing the report was not improving the lot of Muslims but creating more rifts in society for electoral gains.

 In the name of increased participation of Muslims in governance, the report advocates a mechanism for their nomination to public bodies. This is a disastrous provision, on the lines of the separate electorates for Muslims advocated by the Muslim League, Swaraj said.

 The participation of Muslims in nearly all political spaces is low, which can have an adverse impact on Indian society and polity in the long run. A carefully conceived nomination procedure can be worked out to increase the participation of minorities at the grassroots. Mechanisms should be put in place so that a large number of minorities are, indeed, nominated, the report states.

 Such recommendations, the BJP leader said, are the product of a distorted vision. Swaraj blamed the Congress and its pseudo-secular allies for the pitiful condition of Indias Muslims.

 The report only proves what we have been saying. The Congress and the so-called advocates of Muslims are not really bothered about Muslims. If they were, the Muslims wouldnt have been as worse off as the report shows. 

 Sushma said a debate on the report would take place in both Houses of Parliament.

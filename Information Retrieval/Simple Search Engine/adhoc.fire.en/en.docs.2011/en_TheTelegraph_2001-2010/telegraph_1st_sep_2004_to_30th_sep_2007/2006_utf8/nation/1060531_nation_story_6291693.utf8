 Fuel hike on cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New 

 Delhi, May 30: The Union cabinet is expected to 

 give the go-ahead to a moderate increase in petrol and diesel 

 prices this week.

 Petrol and diesel prices are expected to go up by Rs 2 to Rs 3 a litre while cooking gas and kerosene may be spared following opposition from the Left parties.

 As usual, the increase in petrol price is expected to be higher than that of diesel.

 Petroleum minister Murli Deora and finance minister P. Chidambaram wrapped up discussions on fuel prices today with the latter sticking to his known stand against duty cuts on petroleum products. 

 The Left had suggested that duty be cut so that prices can be lowered.

 However, the finance minister has agreed to the issue of bonds by oil marketing companies to cushion the blow. Oil bonds are IOU slips through which the government compensates the companies for losses on selling cooking gas and kerosene at subsidised prices. 

 Last year, oil companies had issued bonds of Rs 11,500 crore, which allowed them to offset losses and clock profits. 

 We discussed all possible avenues, including duty restructuring. However, a final decision will be taken by the cabinet possibly on Thursday or Friday, Deora said after the meeting.

 Ideally speaking, we would like to spare LPG and kerosene, the petroleum minister added. 

 The proposed hike in petrol and diesel prices is expected to enable the oil companies to recover around Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 crore, which falls far short of the projected Rs 73,512-crore revenue loss for 2006-07. 

 Sources said Deora had painted a grim picture, putting the losses at Rs 10.43 a litre on sale of diesel, Rs 9.33 on petrol, Rs 17.16 a litre on kerosene and Rs 114.45 on every LPG cylinder.

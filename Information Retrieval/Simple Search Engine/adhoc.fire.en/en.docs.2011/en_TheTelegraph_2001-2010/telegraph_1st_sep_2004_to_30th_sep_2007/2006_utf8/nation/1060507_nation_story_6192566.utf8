 Govt mulls museum grants

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: The government has proposed financial assistance to museums managed by voluntary organisations, societies and local bodies engaged in the conservation of antiques, coins, paintings, arts and crafts, textiles, stamps and ethnological collections.

 The scheme devised by the ministry of culture is aimed at enhancing security and promoting conservation and modernisation of museums across the country.

 Any registered organisation, institution, society, trust, university or college can submit a project proposal for financial aid under the scheme. No grant would, however, be given for setting up new museums.

 Eighty per cent of the funds would be provided by the Union government and the states will have to bear the rest. States in the Northeast, however, will have to share only 10 per cent of the aid.

 The Museums would be entitled to a grant of Rs 50 lakh for renovation and repairs, Rs 25 lakh for conservation projects, Rs 5 lakh for libraries and Rs 25 lakh for security equipment.

 Besides, state museums in the Northeast, including Sikkim, can seek an additional one-time grant of Rs 3 crore for developing infrastructure.

 The Supreme Court, which is hearing a PIL seeking special protection for historical assets after the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal in 2004, was told by the Centre that applications for funds would be invited every year through advertisements in newspapers.

 The scheme has been framed to ensure that local museums do not compromise on security, documentation of collections or other important activities due to lack of funds.

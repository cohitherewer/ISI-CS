 Samajwadi quota bait for minorities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 5: The ruling Samajwadi Party today passed a resolution in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly recommending amendment of the Constitution to extend reservation to Dalit Muslims and Christians, overriding protests from the BJP and the Congress.

 The Samajwadi move is seen as an attempt to divert the attention of minority voters away from the Sachar committee report on the condition of Muslims in the country. It feels the Congress has tried to gain political mileage out of the report.

 While the Congress protested that the resolution recommending amendment of Article 341 was a political gimmick ahead of the Assembly elections, the BJP said it was against reservation on the ground of religion.

 Rashtriya Lok Dal members were not present when the resolution was passed.

 The resolution states that the Samajwadi-led government in Uttar Pradesh is in favour of amending Clause 3 of Article 341, which bars reservation on the basis of religion. The resolution says religion cannot be a ground for depriving Dalits of reservation, and claims that doing so would violate Article 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution.

 We certainly feel no one should be given reservation on religious basis, but we also oppose it if people are denied reservation on the ground of religion, the resolution added.

 State parliamentary affairs minister Mohd Azam Khan, who led the lobby for resolution, tabled it in the House since chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was absent. It was passed later by a voice vote.

 The BSP and the Congress boycotted the proceedings in protest against the deteriorating law and order situation and patronage of criminals by the ruling party. Only the BJP was in the House to oppose the resolution.

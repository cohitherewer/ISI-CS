 Broadcasters fall in line on CAS rates

 SET FOR NEW REGIMEOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Set for new regime

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: After a show of reluctance and mounting the odd legal challenge, television companies have complied with broadcast regulator Trais directive to declare prices for their channels under the conditional access system (CAS).

 On August 31, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) directed that under CAS, no pay channel should cost viewers more than Rs 5 a month, excluding taxes.

 Meeting the Trai deadline for declaring their prices, 11 companies have sent in their tariff list for 89 channels.

 Not surprisingly, they have set the price for each channel at exactly Rs 5. But some southern companies have clarified that their channels will remain free-to-air in the Chennai CAS area.

 The directive had met with opposition from broadcasters who argued that the market should decide what people pay for their satellite television. But Trais case was that if people ended up paying too much under CAS, the system might fail to take off. It has said the prices can be reviewed later.

 CAS already operates in Chennai. By December 31, it will be implemented in specified areas in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai. The tariff order applies only to CAS areas.

 A couple of broadcasters have petitioned the court and the appellate authority, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal. But even they have submitted their tariff list to Trai.

 STAR India, for example, while submitting its rates for 13 channels all priced at the Rs 5, has made it clear that it is doing so under protest and without prejudice to its petitions against the tariff directive.

 Some others, too, have added caveats, suggesting they could change their prices should the tribunal or the courts hand in a favourable ruling.

 Broadcasters who have indicated they are adhering to Trai-specified tariff are STAR India, SET Discovery, ESPN, Raj TV Network, B4U Network, Sun, Udaya, Gemini, Ushodaya Enterprises, BBC World and Zee Turner.

 Trai is sending a reminder to television companies that have not declared tariffs.

 The regulatory authority said the declaration of prices was an important milestone in the plan to roll out CAS which brings satellite television to households through a set-top box by the year-end.

 Next, Trai needs to nudge broadcasters, multi-system operators and smaller cable-operators into signing interconnection agreements on how they will share revenue.

 Body donor club

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 2: After eye donation clubs, its cadaver donation in Kerala. Youths belonging to the Rationalists Association in Kochi have decided to set up a club of willing cadaver donors so that once dead, the rest of the society can benefit from their bodies, reports our special correspondent.

 Its a pious wish for now but the youths are calling a convention in Kochi in the first week of September to firm up on the protocol, the legal nuances of getting members to sign away their bodies and enlisting family members cooperation.

 A local newspaper, quoting Yesudas Varapuzha, a clerk at Kerala state electricity board, said: Cadaver donation rate in the country is low, not because of a lack of generosity, but owing to a lack of public awareness. Were trying to convince the general public about the need to donate their body for the needy.

 The formalities are being worked out. All those willing to leave their bodies behind, for better use than the ritualistic cremation or burial, can enrol, with an undertaking in the presence of a witness.

 The club undertakes to reach the body to the nearest government hospital or medical college.

 This is not for private colleges. We want to keep commerce out of this. Therefore, the deal is restricted to government institutions. Were in touch with medico-legal experts to firm up an agreement. Once the agreement is finalised we will start the membership drive, said Yesudas.

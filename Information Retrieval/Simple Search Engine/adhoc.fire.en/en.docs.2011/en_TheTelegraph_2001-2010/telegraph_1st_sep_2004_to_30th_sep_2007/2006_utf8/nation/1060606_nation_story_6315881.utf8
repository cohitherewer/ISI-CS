 Veteran tipped for poll top post

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 5: Election commissioner N. Gopalaswami is likely to succeed B.B. Tandon as chief election commissioner.

 Tandon is set to retire on June 29.

 Gopalaswami, the senior-most in the poll panel, was Union home secretary before becoming election commissioner.

 According to sources, Gopalaswamis appointment to the top post in the poll body has been cleared by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Navin Chawla, who was at the centre of a controversy for having allegedly received monetary favours from some Congress leaders, is the other election commissioner.

 Although it is not confirmed who will fill the slot vacated by Gopalaswami, one of the names doing the rounds is that of home secretary V.K. Duggal.

 Clean chit to BC Roy

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: The committee set up by the Bengal health department to probe crib deaths at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children early this month has given it a clean chit. 

 Sources said the report, submitted to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra three days ago, says there was no fault on the part of the hospital. 

 All the patients came in moribund conditions with advanced stages of septicaemia, pneumonia and other critical diseases, an official said, quoting from the report. The report says that even with modern facilities, it would not have been possible to save these children, he added.

 Between November 2 and 4, 22 children died in the hospital, triggering protests by patients relatives and political parties. 

 The report has condemned the Congress and the Trinamul Congresss protests where loudspeakers were often used. It says the political parties role was deplorable, the official said.

 That the probe panel would absolve the hospital of all charges was reported in The Telegraph dated November 8. A senior health official had revealed that preliminary investigations suggested that there was no negligence.

 The final report prepared by the committee headed by director of medical education Jayashree Mitra Ghosh only briefly mentions the lack of infrastructure and facilities at the hospital, but speaks at length about a new building that is coming up. 

 There is a mention of the non-availability of a ventilator, the official said. 

 In the absence of a ventilator, BC Roy took one on lease from SSKM Hospital. However, it could not be used because there was no one who could operate it. 

 The report elaborates on the facilities that the new hospital building will have. It will house neonatal and paediatric intensive care units and have 110 beds.

 The state government had sanctioned Rs 1.8 crore for it. Equipment like a ventilator and a blood-gas analyser would be installed with Rs 70 lakh donated by Sourav Ganguly.

 Ideally, a child care hospital requires a sophisticated ventilator, equipment to measure levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, pulse and heart rate monitors and specially trained nurses. Bengals apex hospital for children has none of these. Three babies often share a cot and two draw oxygen from a single tube. 

 The pressure on the hospital is too much with cases referred from all districts, said the hospitals superintendent.

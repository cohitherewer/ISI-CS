 Trade-off gifts quota cake to creamy layer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Regardless of economic and social status, OBC students will be eligible for the 27 per cent quota that will come into effect in higher education institutions from the next academic year. 

 The cabinet has decided not to apply the creamy layer formula in education. Under the creamy layer concept, the affluent among the OBCs are excluded from reservation.

 Such an exclusion exists in the 27 per cent reservation in jobs for OBCs implemented on the basis of the Mandal Commission report. 

 A panel had drawn up a long list of criteria for excluding the creamy layer from reservation following a Supreme Court directive in 1994. 

 The CPM, which has been advocating quotas based on economic criteria, pushed hard for the creamy-layer bar in education, too. 

 The party had the support of a section of reservation critics within the cabinet, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and law minister H.R. Bhardwaj.

 But the southern allies, the DMK and the PMK, put their foot down. 

 Much against their will, they had to accept a staggered implementation, instead of the 27 per cent at one go. DMK chief M. Karunanidhi earlier this month had written to the Prime Minister urging him not to stagger implementation. But the bill is expected to have a clause that permits the quota implementation in phases over three years in institutions that do not have adequate facilities.

 The provisions to stagger the quota and not to exclude the creamy layer are being seen as a trade-off between the pro- and anti-reservation lobbies. 

 The critics of the bill feel that the application of creamy layer could have neutralised some of the opposition to the legislation. Students in Delhi have already taken to the streets.

 The creamy layer criteria in jobs exclude persons with a gross annual income of Rs 2.5 lakh or above or possessing assets above the exemption limit prescribed in the Wealth Act.

 Sons and daughters of persons holding constitutional posts come under the creamy layer. The posts include those of the President, Vice-President, judges of the Supreme Court and high courts, and the chairperson and members of the UPSC and state public service commissions. 

 The list of persons whose children are denied the benefit of reservation in jobs under the creamy layer is wide ranging. It includes doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants, income-tax officials, financial and management consultants, computer specialists, media and sports professionals, and authors.

 By not excluding the creamy layer in education, the cabinet has ensured that all OBC students even those who are not socially and educationally backward will get the benefit of reservation in top central universities, IIMs and IITs.

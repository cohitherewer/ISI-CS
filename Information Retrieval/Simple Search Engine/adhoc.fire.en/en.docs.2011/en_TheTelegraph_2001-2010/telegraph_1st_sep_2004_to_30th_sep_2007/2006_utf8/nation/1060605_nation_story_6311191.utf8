 Narcotics haul

 Mumbai, June 4 (PTI): The cocaine seizure from the Jawaharlal Nehru port yesterday was the biggest in Asia and despatchers of the drug could have been testing India as a transit route, the Narcotics Control Bureau said today.

 It is something unusual, the bureaus director-general K.C. Verma said about the seizure of 200 kg of cocaine worth Rs 500 crore in the international market. 

 The biggest cocaine seizure this year was of 136 kg in China, he added.

 Bureau sources said five persons have been detained.

 Verma said it was too premature to say if the Mumbai underworld was involved.

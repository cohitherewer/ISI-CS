 Dependency syndrome

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today came out against complex policies and subsidies, saying a dependency syndrome has stunted performance and diminished transparency.

 The comments, at the 16th biennial anti-corruption conference organised by the CBI, come as controversy rages in the country over quotas. But the President did not use the word reservation. 

 Wherever there is an independence to perform, we have performed well, whereas wherever we have created a large amount of dependency through complex policies, procedures and subsidies, our performance has been stunted and transparency diminishes.

 In this context, Kalam cited the phenomenal growth of the information, communication and technology sector despite severe constraints.

 There is a need to introspect on this dependency syndrome which we have created. We need to remove these dependencies systematically and allow people to perform in a competitive environment in the global market, he said.

 For this, there has to be re-formulation of policies and procedures prevalent in the legislature, executive and judiciary, he said.

 Describing corruption as a matter of serious concern, the President suggested setting up an independent commission made up of officials from various government agencies to counter the menace.

 He cited the example of Hong Kong where an independent commission has succeeded in its battle against corruption through strict enforcement of laws and community participation against corruption through continuous education.

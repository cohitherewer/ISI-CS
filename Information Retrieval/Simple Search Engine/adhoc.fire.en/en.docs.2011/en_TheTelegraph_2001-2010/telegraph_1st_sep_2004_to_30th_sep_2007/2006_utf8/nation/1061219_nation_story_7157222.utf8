 Classified racket

 Mumbai, Dec. 18: Want to play naughty boy with a college girl? Maybe the morning newspaper could help.

 Chances are if you are the type, that is you could end up having fun and excitement without any tension.

 Prostitution rings in Mumbai are selling sex through newspapers classified sections. Some of the ads promise a world of entertainment. One phone call, and you will know they are advertisements by full-fledged prostitution rackets thriving alongside ads on career, property, education and health.

 A call to a number was greeted by a very suggestive female voice Kya, aap mujhse milna chahoge?

 She went on to talk about her extended family: 87 members, all especially talented. Customers could choose from college girls, housewives and models. Services include phone sex and massages.

 Another operator gave a low-down on her illustrious list of 60, divided into categories. One is of professional call girls, the second of women who get intimate but do not demand money and, finally, women who pay for your services. The third category, the operator said, usually consists of bored high-society women.

 Theres a category of housewives who take Rs 3,000, and the validity period is of one year. There is another where you pay Rs 7,000 and get a validity period of two years. If you want models you pay Rs 10,000 for six months. We do not meet our customers. Once you deposit the money in an ICICI bank account that I give you, we will give you a code that will enable you to contact the girls, said Sonal.

 If a customer wants to pay through Internet, he neednt worry about police intervention, she added. It would be taken care of.

 Other operators offered fun and games with people of your own community. You could choose from Gujarati or Rajasthani friends. And, if you are an adventurous female looking for some fun, theres free registration.

 Another operator said he had about 65 girls, mostly college students. They will be at your disposal for Rs 3,000, he said, but added that the money is negotiable.

 Most of the girls are from upper-class families and have taken to prostitution to maintain their lifestyle. They normally charge Rs 1,000-6,000. Pleasure clubs also thrive in cities like Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Lucknow.

 One of the operators said they kept changing their numbers every two months and avoided working with the same set of people.

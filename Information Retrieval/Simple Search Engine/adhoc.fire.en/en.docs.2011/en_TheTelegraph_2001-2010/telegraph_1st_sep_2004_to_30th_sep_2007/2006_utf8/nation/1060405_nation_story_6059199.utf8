 Rakesh Kumar

 New Delhi, April 4: Senior IFS officer Rakesh Kumar, booked by the CBI for alleged involvement in human trafficking, has got himself admitted to a hospital in Germany. 

 The special secretary (economic relations) was in Latin America with junior foreign minister Anand Sharma when he was asked to cut short his visit and return to face investigators. 

 On his way back, Kumar complained of chest pain and high blood pressure and stopped in Munich for treatment.

 He has been accused of illegally sending a dance troupe to Berlin last year, many of whose members disappeared on reaching Germany.

 An external affairs ministry spokesperson today said Kumar has gone on leave. Sources said foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who was in Washington last week, called Kumar from there and asked him to return to Delhi. He also gave the go-ahead to the CBI to question the 1972-batch IFS officer.

 The CBI is now waiting for Kumars return so that they can question him for his alleged role in sending the 15-member dance troupe to Germany last year when he was director-general of the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR). 

 Sources in the investigating agency said the empanelment papers of the troupe, Mehak Punjab di, with Kumars signatures, were found during raids at his house and other places. The group was empanelled with ICCR in violation of established procedures and on the basis of forged documents, they added.

 Nine members of the troupe disappeared after they reached Berlin in September 2005. Six of them were traced recently and will be deported soon.

 Kumar is named in the FIR along with Shiv Kumar Sharma from Ludhiana, programme officer in the ICCR Kehkashan Tyagi and a middleman, Har Gulab Singh. They have been booked for cheating, forgery and misappropriation under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and under the Prevention of Corruption Act. 

 Till the time investigations are on, Kumar will remain on medical leave and will not attend office, officials said. He has been named a conspirator with ICCR colleague Tyagi and the others for sending the Bhangra troupe to Germany with the mala fide intention of smuggling them into that country.

 The CBI has arrested Shiv Kumar, who is said to be the key accused, and he will remain in its custody till April 7. He allegedly took Rs 5 to 6 lakh from the troupe members for arranging their travel, sources said. The CBI had questioned him earlier.

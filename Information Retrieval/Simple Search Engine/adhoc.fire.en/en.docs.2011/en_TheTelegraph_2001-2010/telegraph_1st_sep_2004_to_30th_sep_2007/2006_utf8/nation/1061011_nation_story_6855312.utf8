 PM talks business amp; terror busting

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 London, Oct. 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his British counterpart Tony Blair ended their summit today by agreeing to make India an attractive destination for UK investors and to enhance co-operation in fighting terrorism.

 The two leaders also discussed events unfolding after the nuclear tests by North Korea. 

 Singh, who addressed British and Indian CEOs jointly with Blair, said: Investment in India is both safe and profitable. 

 He singled out infrastructure as an attractive FDI destination and had British businessmen salivating claiming that India could absorb $320 billion in this sector over the next five years.

 Singh promised further liberalisation of trade in services and in banking, finance and legal practice. He, however, admitted that whenever parliamentary approval was required some difficulties did crop up.

 I cannot report to you that we have a consensus but this is an idea whose time has come, he said. He seemed confident that a meaningful consensus would be forged in the near future.

 Showing remarkable openness and admiration for each other, Singh and Blair took questions from the CEOs attending the first UK-India Investment Summit. 

 The two leaders joked and laughed about themselves with Singh saying that the basic rule of government was that the higher you go the less you know. Blair countered that he knew even less than Singh to begin with.

 Singh promised clarity and a time-bound approach to investment approvals in the energy sector. A joint group will be formed to make suggestions in this regard.

 He offered to create an enabling environment for British companies to take advantage of the investment opportunities in infrastructure and said a group of ministers would be set up to look into the issue of spectrum (band of air waves) allocation for telecom companies.

 Dismissing the hostile perceptions of China in the manufacturing sector, the Prime Minister said: The world is large enough to accommodate the growth ambition of China and India.

 Earlier in the day, India and Britain agreed to expand cooperation in countering terrorism. Anand Sharma, minister of state for external affairs, said they had agreed to share practical lessons from terrorist attacks on mass transit systems. 

 London Underground was bombed last July while serial bombs hit suburban trains a year later in Mumbai.

 The two countries have also agreed to enhance security planning and co-ordination at vulnerable sites.

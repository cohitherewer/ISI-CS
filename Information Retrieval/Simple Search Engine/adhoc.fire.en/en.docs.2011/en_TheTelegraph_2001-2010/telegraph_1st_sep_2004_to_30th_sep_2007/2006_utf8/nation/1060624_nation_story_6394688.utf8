 Creamy layer in limbo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: Should the creamy layer of Other Backward Classes (OBC) be excluded from the reservation proposed in institutes of higher education ? this is a question no one seems to want to answer.

 Neither the human resource development ministry nor the ministry of social justice wants to touch the issue, especially after the high-decibel uproar over the 27 per cent quota announced last month.

 Sources in the HRD ministry said it was for the social justice ministry to draw up a list of OBCs and identify the well-heeled among them. The social justice ministry, on the other hand, says it is the HRD ministry that will work out the nitty-gritty of the reservation bill.

 Introducing an economic criteria could rob the quota decision of its vote-catching power among the backwards, because it would then be seen as a compromise.

 Veerappa Moily, the Congress veteran who heads the Oversight Committee set up to monitor implementation of the quota, is also shying away from the issue and said it is up to the government to take a decision. 

 The two main political parties, the ruling Congress and the Opposition BJP, have yet to make their stand public.

 Only the CPM is pushing for exclusion of the well-off among the backwards from the reservation in central government institutions, including IITs and IIMs. 

 Party general secretary Prakash Karat has met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to make this point. Last week, his junior and politburo member Sitaram Yechury met HRD minister Arjun Singh ? who set the quota ball rolling ? and made the same appeal.

 A Supreme Court verdict in response to a PIL filed against the Mandal Commissions recommendation of 27 per cent reservation in jobs had laid down that the creamy layer of OBCs should be excluded. The CPM wants the government to apply the same rules to the education quota. 

 But the lobby of OBC leaders does not want to hear about a creamy layer, and insists that reservation should apply to all backwards irrespective of their financial status. Janata Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav has made this clear to the government. 

 The Oversight Committee, too, seems to have run into trouble, with Moily cancelling a national colloquium scheduled for July 3 after sending out the invites.

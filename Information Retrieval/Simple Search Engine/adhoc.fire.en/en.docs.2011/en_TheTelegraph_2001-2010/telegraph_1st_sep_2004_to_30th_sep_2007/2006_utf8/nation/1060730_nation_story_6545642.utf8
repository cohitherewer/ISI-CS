 Court speaks up for quota 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 29: The Supreme Court has said reservation for the underprivileged is justified as long as there are social disparities.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said: So long as social disparities among groups of people are patent and one class of citizens, in spite of best efforts, cannot effectively avail equality of opportunity due to social and economic handicaps, the policy of affirmative action must receive the approval of constitutional courts.

 The words of the apex bench could act as a morale booster for the UPA government, which has proposed reservation for other backward classes in institutions of higher learning.

 The Supreme Court, however, cautioned that any law providing for such a classi- fication among citizens should pass the test of strict scrutiny. 

 Such divisions should be in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, which propose to bring the socially and educationally backward people to the forefront.

 Also the superior court cannot shut its eyes if any illegality is committed by a government in the name of reservations, the bench said, while setting aside the promotion of a reserved category officer by the Mayavati government in Uttar Pradesh in 1997. 

 In this case, the bench said a chief minister cannot make any relaxation that is beyond her authority to promote a reserved category officer.

 The state government had created a post in the labour department to promote the officer who had not even completed the five years of service mandatory under department rules. 

 The officer was promoted allegedly at the behest of the chief minister who was approached by his wife.

 The court said equality was the only purpose for which our Constitution-makers thought of protective discrimination and affirmative action.

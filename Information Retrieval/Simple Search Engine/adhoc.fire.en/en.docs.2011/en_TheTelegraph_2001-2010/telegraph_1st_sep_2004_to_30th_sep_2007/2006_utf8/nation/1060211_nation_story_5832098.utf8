 No IMDT clone, but old clause is back

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Dropping the idea of enacting a legislation in lieu of the controversial Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act, Delhi today decided to amend the Foreigners Act to ensure that anybody whose citizenship is in doubt gets a fair hearing. 

 What it means is that tribunals will be set up in Assam under the Foreigners Act, 1946, as was the case when the IM(DT) Act was in force, to examine the veracity of complaints against suspected Bangladeshi migrants. A tribunal hearing is, however, not mandatory anywhere else.

 The cabinet committee on political affairs took the decision after a recommendation from the Congress government in Assam, the only state where the IM(DT) Act was once applicable. The Congress has been under pressure from the minorities to safeguard their interests ever since the Supreme Court struck down the act on July 12, 2005. 

 The court said the 22-year-old law had not only been ineffective, but also contradictory to its objective of checking the unlawful influx of migrants into Assam. The verdict turned the ruling Congress, which had fought hard to retain the act, into a party of red faces and sent its opponents like the Asom Gana Parishad and the BJP into raptures.

 The cabinet committee meeting decided against a legislation that remotely resembles the IM(DT) Act as it would be political hara-kiri before Assembly polls in five states, including Assam. The group of ministers that was constituted to examine alternatives was also not in favour of a law similar to the old one.

 The Foreigners Act has a provision for tribunals, but not all cases are referred to these. As the onus is on law-enforcing agencies to decide which cases should go through a judicial process, minorities feel a genuine citizen is as susceptible to deportation as a migrant. 

 Briefing the media after the cabinet committee meeting, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said henceforth any person suspected of being an illegal migrant would be referred to a tribunal and be given the opportunity to present his/her case.

 An unconvinced BJP described the move as a cheap political gimmick.

 Mir Hossain, a farmhand from Cachar district, was recently arrested in Sivasagar, branded a foreigner and deported to Bangladesh without a trial.

 An unconvinced BJP described the move as a cheap political gimmick. Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said crass vote-bank politics had led the government to allow a backdoor entry to the IM(DT) Act. Besides being motivated, the decision is in violation of the Supreme Courts order on the IM(DT) Act. Now the government wants to sneak in the same law through the backdoor with an amendment (to the Foreigners Act)_. Going by the quantum of influx to our northeastern states, there can be no doubt about infiltration being a serious challenge to the countrys internal security.

 Congress spokesperson and lawyer Abhishek Singhvi, however, insisted that the government was within its rights to recommend an amendment. Of course, it will later be open to judicial scrutiny. Just as the judiciary struck down a law, the legislature, too, has the right to enact a law, he said.

 Assam has 11 tribunals and 21 more will be set up to take up cases pending from the days of the IM(DT) Act.

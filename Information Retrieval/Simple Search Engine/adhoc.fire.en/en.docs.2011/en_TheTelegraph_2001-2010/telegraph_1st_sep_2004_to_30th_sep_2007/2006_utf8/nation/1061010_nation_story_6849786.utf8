 Delhi picks new Pak envoy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: India today named Satyabrata Pal the new high commissioner to Pakistan. The senior diplomat will replace Shiv Shankar Menon, who took over as foreign secretary earlier this month.

 The Centre cleared Pal, high commissioner to South Africa, for the key assignment last week. The grandson of Justice Radha Binode Pal, he has also served in the UN, besides being acting high commissioner to the UK.

 Pal (in picture) goes to Islamabad at a time when India and Pakistan are looking to restart the composite dialogue that was stalled after the Mumbai train blasts. It is going to be a tough task for him as Delhi prepares to confront Islamabad with evidence that allegedly links the Inter-Service Intelligence with the serial explosions. 

 With his appointment, both neighbours will have new envoys. Pakistans high commissioner to Canada, Shahid Malik, has been named the new high commissioner to India. An old India hand, Malik was deputy high commissioner in Delhi between 1992 and 1995. He replaces Aziz Ahmed Khan.

 The government also named Y.K. Sinha, now the consul-general in Dubai, as the new ambassador to Venezuela. Rajeet Mitter, joint secretary in the external affairs ministry, moves to Philippines as the new envoy.

 Officials said more new appointments would follow over the next few days as the ministry of external affairs goes through a shake-up.

 Earlier, the high commissioner to Sri Lanka, Nirupama Rao, was named the new ambassador to China, another key diplomatic slot. 

 Foreign secretary Menon will have a new team of secretary-rank officers. The post of secretary (east) has gone to Nalin Surie, who returns from Beijing. 

 N. Ravi is secretary (west). The posts fell vacant after Rajiv Sikri, who was looking after the east portfolio, quit to protest the appointment of Menon, his junior, as foreign secretary. Sikris wife, Veena, high commissioner to Bangladesh, had also resigned.

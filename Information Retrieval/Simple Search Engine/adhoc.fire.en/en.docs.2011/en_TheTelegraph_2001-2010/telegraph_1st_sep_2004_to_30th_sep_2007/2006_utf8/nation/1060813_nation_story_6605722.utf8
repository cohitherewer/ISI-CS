 Mumbai, Aug. 12: The chair next to Arvindbhai lies vacant. It is where his friend used to sit, till the 7/11 blasts claimed his life. A month on, the pounding rain dealt another blow to Arvindbhai he lost his diamond business.

 The train bombings followed by the Surat deluge have landed many a diamond trader in doldrums. 

 Its as if we have been cursed. I have my factories in Surat, which have suffered very badly, and my entire family resides there. I dont know which I will attend to first, said Hiteshbhai, who operates from Zaveri Bazar in suburban Mumbai. 

 The Mumbai Diamond Merchants Association (MDMA) had lost 25 members and diamonds worth more than Rs 2 crore in the 7/11 bombings.

 But if the blasts were a hard blow, the deluge in Gujarat proved to be even fiercer. With losses of about Rs 5,000 crore, the diamond industry is deep in distress, say traders with businesses in Surat, the hub of the countrys Rs 75-billion diamond industry. 

 Most traders feel that the next 15-20 days will see their fortunes plummeting further. 

 Its all over for me. In the coming days, the price of diamonds is going to soar and we will not find any cheap labour. Most of our labourers in Surat will go back to their hometowns as soon as the rainwater recedes and we will be left with nothing, said Kalpeshbhai.

 Where will we get raw materials from? asked another trader.

 Along with the diamonds, traders in Mumbai have also lost important documents recording transactions. 

 We have no insurance, 99 per cent of our diamonds are not insured. If they were, then we would not have been that hard pressed. Now, we have no documents to prove transactions and no machinery to continue our business. 

 There are some manufacturing units that use the latest laser technology to cut diamonds. They cost somewhere around Rs 30-35 lakh and are operated through computers they are all damaged now, rued Hiteshbhai.

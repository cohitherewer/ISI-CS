 Shayan liar: Cops

 New Delhi, Oct. 17 (PTI): Police today described Shayan Munshi, the key witness in the Jessica Lal murder who turned hostile, as a liar and told Delhi High Court the trial court had erred by relying on his statements.

 The model-turned-actor had not supported the prosecution and instead talked of the two-weapon theory that demolished the case, the police said.

 Munshi in his first statement before the police did not talk of the two-arms theory and only talked of one weapon and two shots which the prosecution had been pursuing, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanian said. The police had insisted two shots were fired with the same weapon and one hit Jessica.

 Subramanian said Munshi told the police he had chased only one person but before the court he talked of running towards two. At no point of time Munshi talked of chasing two people and two weapons and suddenly before the trial court he spoke of two weapons and two persons, he said.

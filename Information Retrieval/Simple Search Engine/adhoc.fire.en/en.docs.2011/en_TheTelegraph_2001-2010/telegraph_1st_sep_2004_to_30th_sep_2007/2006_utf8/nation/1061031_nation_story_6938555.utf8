 Sis first, Rahul waits

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: The curtain has gone up on the debut of another political dynasty but the Rahul on this stage has stepped aside for the time being for his sister.

 Nearly five months after Pramod Mahajans murder and on his first birth anniversary, daughter Poonam Rao joined the BJP today.

 Her brother Rahul is also keen to begin a career in politics but the drugs scandal seems to have acted as a speedbreaker. Otherwise, like in the Congress first family, the brother would have taken the plunge before the sister. 

 The 26-year-old Poonam, a trained commercial pilot like her brother, enrolled as an ordinary member of the party and will campaign in the election to local bodies and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, scheduled early next year.

 Poonam was accompanied by brother Rahul, her uncle Gopinath Munde, and state BJP president Nitin Gadkari to the initiation ceremony at the BJPs central Mumbai office.

 After joining the party, Poonam displayed her sound-bite skills. I was thinking about taking the membership for the last few years. I have been doing social work for quite sometime, but the work has its limitations. In politics, there will be no limits to what I can do, Poonam told reporters.

 I will work towards fulfilling my fathers legacy. He felt very strongly about educational and womens issues. I will do whatever the party asks me to do, she added.

 Welcoming her into the party, Gadkari said: She has Pramod Mahajans blood in her veins and I am confident that she will do well.

 Rahul said the Mahajan family was committed to the BJP, and it would continue to work for the party. We are one it does not make a difference who joins the party first she or me. The BJP is in our blood and we will continue to work for it.

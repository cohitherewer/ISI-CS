 Militants renew cable TV threat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, May 12: Four militant outfits have reiterated their ban on cable TV operations after the separatist Dukhtaran-e-Milat yesterday said the ban had been a government handiwork.

 In a statement published by newspapers today, Abdullah Mubarak, identifying himself as spokesman for the Jaish-e-Mohammad, al-Badr Mujaheedin, Harkat-ul Mujaheedin and the al-Madina Regiment, warned cable operators not to resume beaming signals as the outfits had decided to continue their ban on the cable TV business in Kashmir.

 It added that viewing cable TV was leading the local youth astray and distancing them away from Islam.

 The four militant outfits have requested Dukhtaran-e-Milat chief Asiya Andrabi not to assume the role of a spokesperson for underground militant groups. Sister Asiya should mind her own business. 

 The militant combine has threatened the cable TV operators of dire consequences, including fidayeen attacks on their establishments, if they fail to pay heed to the warning. 

 With the publication of the statement, all cable TV operations across Kashmir which resumed yesterday were stopped by the operators. We are in a devil-and-deep-sea situation. We dont know what to do and for the time being, it is safe to suspend our operations, said one of them. 

 a cable operator who did not want to be named.

 The militants had launched an aggressive campaign against video and beauty parlours after they stopped running of cinema halls in early 1990. But for the last few years, cable TV operations continued in Kashmir with occasional hiccups because of stray threats.

 It is widely believed that the ban on cable TV operations stems from the recently unearthed sex scandal involving top politicians and senior police and security force officers.

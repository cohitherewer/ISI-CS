 Lalu lash

 Railway minister Lalu Prasad, no longer on good terms with Mulayam Singh Yadav, has demanded that the tapped pieces of conversation be publicised.

 Lalu Prasad said there should be a public demonstration of the contents within a week. If the phones have been tapped, the contents should be made public. 

 His comments came a day after the Congresss Ambika Soni implied that the Samajwadi leaders were jittery because there was something serious on the tapes that could embarrass them.

 They are unnecessarily maligning Soniaji. Why are three chief ministers being approached by the SP leaders? Are they police officers? Lalu Prasad asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Militant duo in name game

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: The two militants arrested from the Indo-Bangla border at Hingalgunge in North 24-Parganas last month made their confessions in court today. 

 Having initially introduced themselves as Mohammed Zuber and Mohammed Sohail, they admitted before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate at Basirhat, about 70 km from here, that their original names were Mohammed Bilal and Adnan Yunus.

 After recording their confessions under Section 164 of IPC, magistrate Pallab Roychowdhury remanded them in judicial custody till September 13. 

 The magistrate, however, turned down a plea from officials of Mumbai polices anti-terrorist squad to take the duo in remand for interrogation under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). The cops had produced a warrant from a Mumbai special court. 

 We are looking for the arrested duo as they may provide some vital information about the activities of militant groups in Mumbai, particularly after the serial train blasts. We also want them to identify some documents related to the blast, K. P. Raghuvanshi, superintendent of the squad, said over phone from Mumbai this afternoon. 

 CID officials claim the arrested militants only acted as links for Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba, groups active in the countrys western region.

 Immediately after their arrest, the two militants had tried to mislead cops by saying they were suicide bombers. They had also provided false information to sleuths about their subversive activities. 

 Officials told the court they could not find anything big from the two men because they apparently operated in a segregated manner.

 The duo drafted letters in the email, but did not send them. The mails were operated by several persons with the same password from cyber cafes across the country, he added.

 Meanwhile, CID officials tightened their network in Swarupnagar and Baduria in North 24-Parganas on a tip-off that 10 Mumbai men had come to the area after the arrest of Zuber and Sohail. 

 Those who have come are also holding close-door meetings with some locals. We have information they might disguise themselves as clerics, an intelligence official said.

 SEZ blow to Gujarat farmers

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Supreme Court today dismissed a plea by some farmers challenging the acquisition of 10,000 acres of land by the Gujarat government for Reliance Infrastructure Ltds Jamnagar Special Economic Zone.

 Disposing of the appeal by the farmers, a bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, however, left it open for the land owners to challenge the quantum of compensation provided for their land.

 The farmers had moved the apex court against a Gujarat High Court order upholding the acquisition of land for the Mukesh Ambani-led company.

 While dismissing a PIL against acquisition of farmland for the SEZ last week, the apex court had noted that such a petition could be considered only if the affected parties approached it. But the court showed no inclination to entertain the petition by the Gujarat farmers today.

 In their special leave petition before the court, the farmers said that of the 10,000 acres acquired by the government, about 9,000 acres was being used for agriculture. The land would, among other things, house Reliance Industries Ltds mega refinery, the farmers said.

 Govt promises brand shield 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: The chairman of the oversight committee tasked to draw up a roadmap to usher in the new quota system today sought to dispel fears that a rapid expansion of capacity in higher education would hit quality of education.

 The committee will ensure that the required faculty and proper infrastructure are made available before the institutions raise their student intake at the start of the 2007 academic year, its chairman, Veerappa Moily, said.

 Well ensure that the brand of institutions is protected 100 per cent, Moily said after the first meeting of the committee.

 Nine of its 13 members attended the meeting today. The committee will be assisted by five technical groups ? each covering a different discipline ? that will determine fine details such as seat increases in specific courses, faculty requirements and the cost of the exercise. 

 A meeting of the heads of the five technical groups will be held tomorrow in New Delhi.

 The government had announced three technical groups yesterday ? one each for engineering, management and central universities. Two new groups for agriculture and health were created today.

 Moily said funding would not be a problem. The government has committed Rs 6,000 crore to add faculty and infrastructure in higher education, he added.

 Senior faculty in several educational institutions have expressed doubts whether the government would indeed be able to expand infrastructure and faculty while still maintaining the quality of education. 

 We always have large numbers of applicants in India. The problem is finding the faculty of the right calibre, said a senior faculty member in a science institution.

 Moily said he would like the students on strike to call off their agitation. The concrete roadmap that we (will draw up) will remove all these fears. Our recommendations will satisfy all sections of the student community.

 Moily said there would be no compromise on quality despite the expansion of seats and reservations.

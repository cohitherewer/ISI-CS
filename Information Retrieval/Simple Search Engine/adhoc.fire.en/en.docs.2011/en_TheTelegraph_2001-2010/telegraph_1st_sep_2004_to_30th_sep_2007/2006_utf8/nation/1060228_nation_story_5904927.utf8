 Tehelka political arrest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 27: The CBI today arrested former Samata Party treasurer R.K. Jain in the defence deal scam.

 More than a year ago, Tehelka had taken the lid off alleged bunglings in the procurement of hand-held thermal imagers for the armed forces. 

 The expos? was part of the news portals sting operation on politicians, bureaucrats and army officials, who were allegedly caught on camera accepting bribes to obtain supply orders for the defence forces.

 The CBI held Jain under the Prevention of Corruption Act from Delhi after questioning him. 

 Immediately after the arrest, the agency raided Jains official and residential premises.

 Investigations into the Tehelka case were handed over to the CBI in October 2004 after the UPA government scrapped the Phukan commission of inquiry.

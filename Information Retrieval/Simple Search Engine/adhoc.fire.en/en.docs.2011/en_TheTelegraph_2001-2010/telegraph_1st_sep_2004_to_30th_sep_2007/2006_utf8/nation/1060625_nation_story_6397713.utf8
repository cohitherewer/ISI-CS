 Plea relief to Patel

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 24: A woman who had withdrawn her petition accusing two MPs of sexual assault filed an amended petition before the Supreme Court yesterday dropping the name of one of them ? Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 The woman had alleged that she was kept confined in the house of Yasmin Abrar, a member of the National Commission for Women, and sexually assaulted by several persons, including Patel and Meerut MP Shahid Akhlaq.

 A vacation bench had allowed her application for amending her writ while permitting withdrawal of the petition on Thursday.

 The petition was dismissed as withdrawn after the woman submitted she did not want to pursue the case because of changed circumstances.

 The court took up both applications together and passed a common order allowing her to delete Patels name.

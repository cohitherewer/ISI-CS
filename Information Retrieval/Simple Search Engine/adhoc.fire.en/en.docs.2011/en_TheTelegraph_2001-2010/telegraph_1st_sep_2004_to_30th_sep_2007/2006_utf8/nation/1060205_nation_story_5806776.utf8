 4 lakh jostle for 5000 jobs

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Feb. 4: The latest job advertisement by the Jammu and Kashmir government has virtually set the CAT among the pigeons, twice over.

 With 4 lakh applications on the way for the 5,000 jobs on offer, the state services selection board faces a task double that of the IIMs, whose Common Admission Test sifts from 2 lakh candidates.

 As the board is first to admit, the task is beyond it.

 We simply dont have the means and wherewithal to hold a written test for such a large number of candidates that would serve as some sort of screening, board chairman Khazir Mohammad Wani said.

 He, however, admitted in the same breath that only a written test can satisfy everyone that selection has been free from political influence and nepotism.

 Which is why Wani wears a worried look though the 3 lakh application forms sold so far have already made the board richer by Rs 2 crore. Another 1 lakh forms are expected to be sold.

 The phenomenal response reflects the huge number of educated but jobless youth in the state, where the virtual absence of the private sector means government jobs are their only hope.

 What the rush has ensured is that two months ahead of the recruitment process, the question is already being asked whether it can be transparent and fair.

 Wani, an IAS officer with a reputation for integrity, was appointed board chief to ensure a fair selection.

 He says that in the absence of a written test, candidates must be shortlisted according to marks obtained in Plus-two board or university exams. That brings its own problems.

 You see, in the early and mid-90s, the education system took the worst beating from the violence. Mass copying and proxy candidates saw most graduates secure extremely high marks ? many bagged between 92 and 98 per cent, a board official said.

 As the education system began getting back on the rails, the high percentages naturally got restricted to the brilliant few. But, on paper, you cannot now reject candidates because they obtained degrees in a certain year. So when you shortlist candidates on percentages, it is the mass copiers who gain.

 Asked how he planned to deal with this, Wani said: We are trying to devise some credible procedure.

 For now, he has divided up the credits for selection: 20 for the interview, 80 for academic merit. The latter is again split into two: less than half for basic qualification and the rest for specialisation in a subject relevant to the job applied for.

 Welcome to the city of one-ways

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Jan. 4: Militant terror is not this infotech citys only worry. There is also one-way traffic terror that Bangaloreans combat everyday while going to work, dropping children to school or heading to the grocery store next door.

 The maze of one-ways ? there are 268 in all ? has made traffic movement in the city an ordeal. To add to this, the citys traffic police yesterday reversed a set of one-ways and will introduce some more in the central business district.

 The traffic adviser to the government, professor M.N. Sreehari, even proudly owned up responsibility for getting the police to reverse the one-ways. The reversing of the St Marks Road-Museum Road one-way system will ease congestion, he said. 

 This is not all. I have advised them to reverse the one ways on Richmond Road and Residency Road, which have a bearing on the flow of traffic on these two roads (St Marks Road and Museum Road), he added.

 The rate at which the number of one-ways are increasing, Bangalore could soon earn another sobriquet ? one-way city.

 With a burgeoning 25 lakh vehicles on the roads (see chart), experts feel traffic options are fast running out.

 Statistics apart, Sreehari also admits that one-ways are only cosmetic surgeries and the easiest solution for the traffic police, but certainly not a long-term remedy. 

 He should know for he had predicted, while doing his PhD at IIT Roorkee on traffic engineering in 1974 itself, that Bangalore would become a mess. 

 A city of this size should have a metro. It should have more flyovers but without a traffic cop atop, he said, referring to the Richmond circle flyover that is manned during the day and closed at night from one of the approaches.

 But flyovers, too, have run into rough weather. 

 Residents of Basava- nagudi, an old neighbourhood, staged protests and moved court as they did not want a flyover run through their area. 

 However, the Bangalore corporation had its way and the National College flyover was completed. 

 But not even Sreehari could have imagined that as the elegant bungalows gave way to monstrous high-rises with glass and aluminium facades, roads and footpaths would also shrink. There is a hundred times more traffic than a few decades ago, he said.

 A decade ago, there were only 7 lakh vehicles on the citys roads. Today, nearly 1,000 vehicles are being registered in the citys five regional transport offices everyday.

 While rapid urbanisation and a poor public transport system are to blame, factors like higher disposable income and easy vehicle loans have added to the citys infrastructure woes despite rising fuel prices. 

 Bangaloreans pay the highest for petrol at Rs 50 a litre and diesel at Rs 35 a litre.

 The increase in the number of vehicles has also taken a toll on the citys environment with even the Supreme Court last year asking the Karnataka government to check the high level of pollution.

 Additional commissioner, traffic, M.N. Reddi, however, said yesterday that the one-way reversals had yielded good results. 

 We are satisfied. It has reduced pressure at Anil Kumble circle (Oriental circle) and on the narrow Hayes Road, he said.

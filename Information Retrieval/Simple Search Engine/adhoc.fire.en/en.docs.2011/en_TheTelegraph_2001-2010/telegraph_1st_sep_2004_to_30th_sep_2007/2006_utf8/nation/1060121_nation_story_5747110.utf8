 LSE eyes Calcutta ties

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kolkata, Jan. 20: The London School of Economics is looking at research collaborations with Calcutta University, which is holding its 150-year celebrations.

 LSE director Howard Davies said: Our permanent office in New Delhi would be working towards forging greater academic engagements, including research collaborations, with major Indian education institutions, which would include Calcutta University.

 Speaking on the sidelines of a seminar on the future of the global economy at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said the move was part of the LSEs plans to strengthen links with Indian academic institutions.

 He, however, added that we foresee no immediate likelihood of establishing overseas campuses.

 LSE already has research collaborations with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Delhi School of Economics and the National Institute of Bank Management.

 The London institute is offering its newly started Masters in Public Administration course to management institutes and government employees. Launched in association with Columbia University and the French Political Science Institute, the course is being projected by LSE as an alternative to the monopoly in the field enjoyed by the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard.

 The school is also looking for an Indian partner for its media course.

 LSE has a ?5-million annual funding for students from developing countries, a lot of which goes to Indians. We are aiming at increasing the grants, combining it with the facility of easy interest loans, to ease cash flow problems for foreign students, Davies said.

 He disclosed plans to establish a chair each at the school for K.R. Narayanan, the former Indian President, and I.G. Patel, who had once headed LSE.

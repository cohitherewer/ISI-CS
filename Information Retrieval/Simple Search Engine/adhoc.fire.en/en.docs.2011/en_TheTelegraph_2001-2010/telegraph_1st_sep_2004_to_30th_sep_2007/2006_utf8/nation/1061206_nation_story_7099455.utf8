 Bhojshala: Battleground to marriage hall

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Dhar (Madhya Pradesh), Dec. 5: In February, local Hindus and Muslims had fought a pitched battle and the BJP regime under Shivraj Singh Chauhan had to use force to prevent a repeat of Babri at the Bhojshala temple-mosque site.

 Many months later, Dhar is busy planning a mass marriage for girls and boys from both communities. The mass marriage programme, in which each couple will be given Rs 10,000 from the state, is to be held during Basant Panchami on February 14. 

 This will be a unique thing, said Indore range commissioner Ashok Das, adding the proposal had been submitted to the chief minister.

 Mass marriage is not the only thing on Dhars menu. Local Hindu and Muslim leaders are recommending names of community leaders for a peace award to be given away on Basant Panchami, the day Goddess Saraswati is worshipped. Violence had marred the celebrations in 2006.

 Hindus claim that Bhojshala, 250 km from Bhopal, is a Saraswati temple and Muslims say it is a mosque.

 In keeping with the new-found spirit of communal harmony, local Hindu leaders recommended the name of Qazi Zakaullah who supervised the namaz on February 3 when Basant Panchami coincided with Friday prayers. 

 Amid violence and curfew, the qazi had prevailed upon hawkish Muslim youths to restrict the number of those offering prayers to 13. The act helped the local administration to tide over the crisis when over 20,000 Hindu hardliners gathered inside the complex to prevent namaz. 

 In another concession, namaz was offered on the terrace instead of the sanctum sanctorum to silence the radical Hindu Jagran Manch activists who were insisting the yagna fire should not be doused. Namaz could not have been said in front of the fire.

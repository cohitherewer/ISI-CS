 IIMA eyes global brand

 OUR BUREAU

 June 27: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, has taken the first step to build a brand for itself in the global market.

 The institutes board of governors has set up an international advisory council to aid the process. 

 IIMA will be the first business school in India to have such a council. 

 We have to get a name in the international market so that there is a demand for IIMA, Ashok Shah, a faculty member, said. IIM Bangalore had experimented in the same direction by proposing to set up a campus in Singapore. 

 IIMA, however, is not following in its footsteps. We are not ready for a campus abroad at this moment. You do not need a campus on foreign shores to go global. What you need to do is built a brand, Shah said. 

 There will be no government representatives on the board of the council. Membership will be by invitation, Shah said. The nominees will be eminent persons, global business leaders and academics.

 The council will function purely as an advisory and not a decision-making body. It will examine, discuss and recommend IIMAs long-term strategic orientations. It will meet once every year. 

 IIMA is collaborating with a number of foreign business schools at present on student exchange, executive and double degree programmes. There is, however, a feeling that the institution is stagnating and needs to make a mark in the international market.

 Our goal is to be among the top 20-25 business schools globally, Shah said.

 IIMB ran into trouble with the human resource development ministry after it proposed the Singapore campus. The ministry rejected the proposal on the grounds that the institution should first meet domestic demands. It also stressed that the memorandum of association signed by IIMB does not have a provision that entitles it to set up a campus abroad. 

 IIMA is going about matters in a different way to mark its presence in top B-school circles abroad. Instead of going for a foreign campus from the outset, it is gradually positioning itself in the international business school academia. 

 We have entered into a collaboration with the London School of Business and the Duke Corporate Education. We are offering programmes in Egypt, Dubai, Muscat and Bangkok, Shah said.

 But IIMA still needs to build stronger strategic academic alliances in various parts of the world. The international advisory council has been set up to assist it in its task. 

 There is considerable pressure from the HRD ministry on the IIMs to increase seats and strengthen its faculty. This pressure has increased with the decision to reserve 27 per cent of seats for Other Backward Classes.

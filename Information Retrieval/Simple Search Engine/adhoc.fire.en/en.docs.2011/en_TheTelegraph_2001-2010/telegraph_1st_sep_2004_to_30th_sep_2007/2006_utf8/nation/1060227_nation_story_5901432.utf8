 72-hour Qila vigil for Bush

 MANAN KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: If Bill Clintons visit was a headache, George W. Bushs trip could give Delhi a migraine.

 The sentiments of an internal security agency official, expressed at an informal meeting, reflect the kind of pressure the capital is in ahead of the US Presidents three-day visit beginning March 1.

 The US, however, is relying more on its own security by bringing about 800-odd personnel, of which an unspecified number are from the secret service. US presidential guards will form the innermost cordon followed by the secret service personnel and Indias National Security Guard. 

 Delhi police will provide the outer security ring to the President. However, the US security staff are not leaving any scope for error even with us. Sanitisation of all places, which are likely to be visited by the US President, is done, and local intelligence has been asked to give continuous feedback on all developments, said a Delhi police source.

 A special team of officials from both India and the US are keeping an eye on Purana Qila, where Bush is scheduled to address a huge but select gathering of parliamentarians, industrialists and academicians on the first day.

 According to sources, security personnel will take over the fort 72 hours before the speech. After that, the NSGs bomb disposal squad will start checking the Qilas sprawling lawn and the quick response team of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police will take position. American security agents are already inspecting the entry and exit points of the fort.

 Sources said personnel of the India Reserve Battalion from Sikkim are also helping Delhi police tighten the capitals security belt.

 The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has been asked to make special arrangements at the airport tarmac for the smooth landing of Air Force One that will bring Bush. 

 The Maurya Sheraton Hotel, all of whose 600 rooms have been booked by Bushs team, is under the scanner as well. Sniffer dogs and security officials were pressed into service to check the vast central ridge in front of the hotel. 

 Besides, shops selling chemicals are being monitored and their owners have been asked to sell potassium chloride, magnesium dioxide, potassium nitrate and sulphuric acid only to those armed with a valid reason and ID proof.

 The vigil, a security agency official said, was certainly not this elaborate during Clintons visit in March 2000. 

 The reason for the heightened measures lies in the security threat the President faces worldwide after 9/11 and the US-led war in Iraq, a source said, adding that the decision not to visit the Taj Mahal could also be traced to the risk factor.

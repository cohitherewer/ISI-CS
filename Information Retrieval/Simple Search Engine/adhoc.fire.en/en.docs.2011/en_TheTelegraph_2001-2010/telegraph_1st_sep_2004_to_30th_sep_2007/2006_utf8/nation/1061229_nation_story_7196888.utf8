 BJP pokes fun at Rahul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The BJP has taken its battle against the Nehru-Gandhi family beyond Sonia Gandhi, turning its guns on her son Rahul and questioning his acumen and ability to lead the Congress in the future.

 Apart from election meetings, especially in Gujarat where Narendra Modi heaped abuse on the Gandhi scion during the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP has restricted its criticism to Sonia Gandhi so far.

 So it came as a surprise when senior party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad mounted an offensive against Rahul this afternoon, sniggering at his skills as a parliamentarian and mass leader.

 It has been two and a half years since Rahul Gandhi became a Member of Parliament but he has yet to establish himself as a parliamentarian. He has made a total of three statements in the House. And yet, he is already counted as a tall leader in the Congress, Prasad said.

 It is time the Congress shed this hypocrisy and admitted that Rahul Gandhi would be projected as their leader because he was born in a certain family. This would happen regardless of his potential or abilities, he added.

 The backdrop of this attack, explained the BJP spokesperson, was Lalu Prasads advice regarding Rahuls political career and the Congresss bitter response to the suggestion. Lalu Prasad had recently suggested that Rahul be projected as the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. 

 Rahul Gandhi should certainly be projected as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. It would help the UPAs prospects, Lalu Prasad had said during a visit to the poll-bound state recently.

 To the railway ministers suggestion, the Congress responded by maintaining that Rahul is a future leader of the country, implying that the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is a post too low for someone of his stature. 

 The BJP regarded this as a perfect opportunity to train its guns on Rahul.

 Boucher set for Delhi trip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: The debate on the Indo-US nuclear deal will spill over from Washington to Delhi briefly as a series of top-ranking US officials and legislators visit India in the days ahead.

 Assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, who heads the newly reconstituted state departments Bureau for South and Central Asia, will lead a group of influential American figures when he touches down in Delhi on April 6.

 Boucher will meet his counterpart in the foreign ministry, joint secretary (Americas) S. Jaishankar. He will also exchange notes on the developments in the region.

 It will be a follow-up on foreign secretary Shyam Sarans visit to the US where, apart from the deal, talks were held on the next steps in cooperation outlined during President George W. Bushs March visit. 

 After Boucher, many key members of the US Congress will join the India queue. Prominent among them is senator Edward Kenney, a Democrat from Massachusetts, who will be part of a Congress team led by Senator Michael Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming who is chairperson of the Senate committee on health, education, labour and pensions.

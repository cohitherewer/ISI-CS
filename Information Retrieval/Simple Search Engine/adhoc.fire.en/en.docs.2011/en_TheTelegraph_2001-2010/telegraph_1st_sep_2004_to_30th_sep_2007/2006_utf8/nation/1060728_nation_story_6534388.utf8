 Buddha works on US dates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 27: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is likely to visit the US and Europe towards the end of the year scouting for investment.

 Tarun Das of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), who is also Haldia Petrochemicals chairman, today met Bhattacharjee and discussed ways to promote investment, especially FDI in Bengal.

 Since there is a distinct possibility of the chief minister visiting select countries towards the end of the year, talks focussed on FDI. We discussed the sectors in which investment can be promoted ? these include leather, chemicals, IT, automobiles and manufacturing, said Das.

 CPM Palestine fund

 The CPM has set up a solidarity fund for the Palestinians in the face of the Israeli attacks on Gaza and the economic blockade against the Hamas regime. 

 The party has asked members and supporters to pitch in, and expects to raise most of the money from Bengal. The secretary of the CPMs Calcutta district committee, Raghunath Kushari, today handed state secretary Biman Bose a cheque for Rs 5 lakh. 

 Every member has been asked to donate according to their income. We have begun collecting donations from the common people while campaigning for the bleeding Lebanon and Palestine, said Rabin Deb of the partys city unit.

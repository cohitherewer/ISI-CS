 Kashmir student killing rage

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Aug. 10: A wave of protests lashed colleges in Kashmir today following the death of a student in police firing.

 Security forces claimed Ghulam Mohammad Sheikh was shot when he was about to hurl a grenade, while the people said he was killed in cold blood. 

 The CRPF top brass said on Wednesday he was shot in the Dal Gate area as he threw the grenade, but at a news conference later, officials said he was felled before it could detonate. 

 Another release the police sent the media fuelled the row. One person was killed in a firing incident at Dal Gate. Police are investigating, it read. 

 Today, hundreds of students from Amar Singh College, where Sheikh studied, and other institutions hit the streets in protest. Long marches were also held in his home town of Bandipora in north Kashmir.

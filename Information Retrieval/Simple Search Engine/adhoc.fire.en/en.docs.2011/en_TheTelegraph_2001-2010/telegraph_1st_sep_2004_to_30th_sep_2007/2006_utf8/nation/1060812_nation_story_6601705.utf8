 Security step-up after calm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Priya Singh arrived at Delhis Indira Gandhi International Airport from Amsterdam late last night, expecting to face rigorous security checks. 

 I had heard about the London bomb scares, and was sure there would be extra security measures at Delhi Airport.

 She was wrong. It was just like normal. No one frisked me, nor did they manually frisk the cabin baggage. There did not appear to be any extra security, Priya said. 

 But it all changed in the afternoon.

 Rohit Khanna, who was at Delhis domestic terminal, said he noted sudden frantic activity around noon. 

 Extra security personnel were placed at each entry point, and the security point inside the terminal, he said. Till then, it was just like any other day.

 After the India-specific warning, a four-tier security check instead of the usual three-tiered one has been introduced, and luggage guidelines issued for passengers.

 At least for the next few days, passengers can carry only one piece of cabin luggage. For those headed to the UK, the cabin baggage cannot be a laptop or any electronic or battery-run device. No liquids or gels except prescribed medication can be carried.

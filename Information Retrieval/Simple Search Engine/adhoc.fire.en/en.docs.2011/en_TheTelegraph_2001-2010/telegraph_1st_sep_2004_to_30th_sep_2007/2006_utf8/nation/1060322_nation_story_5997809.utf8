 ITs time to go Dutch

 New Delhi, March 21 (INEP): There may be a good news, soon enough, for Indian knowledge workers and other hi-tech professionals. 

 A high-level delegation of Dutch lawmakers, currently on a survey trip to India, has thrown sufficient hints that the otherwise highly restrictive migration laws of The Netherlands may be adequately relaxed for Indian knowledge workers and other professionals intending to work in that country.

 Led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, F.W. Weisglas, the delegation comprises leaders of the countrys main political parties ? both ruling and Opposition.

 Although all of them have reservations about tourist visas being misused for illegal migration into their country by undeserving people, they said, the majority of political parties and parliamentarians are in favour of changing the present law to enable genuine IT and other professionals to come and work.

 Indian professionals and experts contribute to the European economy by lending specialised services to its companies and governments but face serious visa problems for themselves and their spouses. The leaders said they were aware of it and were working on the necessary changes.

 We have already lost a few advantages of migration of labour. But we have a problem of managing the diversity of population. 

 Therefore, necessary adjustments are needed. Finding a new balance is the challenge before our Parliament in this regard but a solution will be found, said one of the parliamentarians. 

 Another delegate said a decision could be expected in a couple of months. 

 We knew this question could be asked... in India. Therefore, we pursued it with the government as recently as last Friday, she added.

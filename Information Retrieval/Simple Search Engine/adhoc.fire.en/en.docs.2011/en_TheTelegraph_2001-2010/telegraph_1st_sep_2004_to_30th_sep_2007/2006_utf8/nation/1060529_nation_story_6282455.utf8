 Gujarat car dealers pull Aamir ads

 Ahmedabad, May 28 (PTI): After cinemas and multiplexes across Gujarat decided not to screen the Aamir Khan-starrer Fanaa, Toyota car dealers here and in Vadodara have decided to pull back print advertisements and hoardings featuring the star.

 Aamir is the brand ambassador of Toyota Innova.

 Advertising agencies handling the campaign in Ahmedabad and Vadodara have decided to discontinue using print advertisements, posters and hoardings featuring Aamir, said an agent handling the advertisement campaign.

 The Toyota Innova dealers have decided to discontinue using Aamirs face on their advertisements because they wish to support the stand taken by the state on the actors anti-Gujarat stand, said Sandeep Shah, who handles the advertising for Infinium Toyota in Ahmedabad.

 The local dealers of Toyota Innova do not want to hurt the sentiments of their customers who come to their showroom and see posters, cut-outs and hoardings of a personality who has taken a stand against their state and its requirements, he added.

 It is uncertain if the local dealers will want to continue with the major hoardings and blow-ups of Aamir and Toyota Innova because that is handled by the main advertising agency from their head office, Shah said.

 Reacting to the controversy on Aamir, BJPs Rajya Sabha MP and actor Shatrughan Sinha said the actor should apologise to the people of Gujarat.

 As an elder brother, I suggest that Aamir apologise for his comments on the Narmada issue and Gujarat. He should tender an apology, respecting peoples sentiments, Sinha said. 

 Asked about his views on the protests against Fanaa, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said: Freedom of speech is a fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution. This should be maintained.

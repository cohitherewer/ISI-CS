 Enter wakf in battle

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: There could be more to the debate on airport privatisation than economics and job losses.

 Those battling the government may find surprise ammunition in a book titled Dilli Ki Tarikhi Masajid, which provides religious grounds against the recent cabinet decision.

 Written by a local imam, Ataur Rehman Qasmi, in 1995, the book implies the transfer of Delhi airport to a private company for modernisation is illegal as the land is wakf property.

 The author refers to Section 32 of the Wakf Act, 1995, to argue that wakf properties cannot be transferred without the wakf boards permission.

 The claim about the lands ownership rests on the testimony of Siraj-ul Haq Piracha, who was chairman of the Delhi Wakf Board from 1994 to 1998.

 Piracha, upholding the claims made by the book, told The Telegraph that during his tenure as wakf board chairman he had brought this fact to the notice of the parliamentary committee formed in 1996 to identify wakf properties in the country.

 But he added that the committee, headed by BJP leader Sikandar Bakht, never submitted a report and became dysfunctional as the years went by.

 The Delhi Wakf Board, therefore, cannot stake claim to this land, for it has not been notified in the state gazette, Piracha said.

 He, however, insisted that the books claims, based on revenue records from the 19th century, could still be established. I had submitted all the relevant proof before the parliamentary committee.

 A small mosque still existed in a corner of Indira Gandhi International Airport, he added. The mosque is held in veneration by the pilots, who regularly seek blessings there for a safe flight.

 Piracha stressed that wakf property is Gods property and demanded that the government notify the airport land in the state gazette before going ahead with its decision to transfer it to a private company, whether on lease or permanently.

 He also claimed that revenue records of several other plots of prime land in Delhi ? National Stadium, Oberoi Hotel and Delhi Public School (Mathura Road) ? show them as wakf property.

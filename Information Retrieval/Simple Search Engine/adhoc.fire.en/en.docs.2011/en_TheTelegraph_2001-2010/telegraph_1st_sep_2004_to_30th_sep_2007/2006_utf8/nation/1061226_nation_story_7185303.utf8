 Burnpur, Dec. 25: Guruprasad Banerjee spent over 20 years in uncertainty working for Indian Iron amp; Steel Co. An employee of the IISCO Steel Plant, he is bullish about the last six years of his working life. 

 Pradeep Kumar Roy is clueless about his future. IISCOs Kulti Works, where he worked for around two decades, is closed since 2003. Roy learnt eight months ago that the company had been put on the blocks and there were four bidders. 

 Banerjee and Roy present the two sides of a steel saga dating back to 1870, when James Erskine set up Bengal Iron Works at Kulti. 

 We used to work in the plant that brought metallurgy to the country. We are jobless today and dying, rues Roy. 

 Banerjee is upbeat, for the first time in his 29 years of association with IISCO. Earlier the payment used to be irregular and there was always the fear of shutdown. Now, we are looking at growth, says Banerjee, standing outside the imposing gate of IISCO Steel Plant. 

 The fresh paint, well-kept roads, swank signposts and new employees quarters at IISCO Steel Plant reinforce Banerjees claim. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was here yesterday to flag off the Rs 9,600-crore expansion and modernisation plan for IISCO, merged with the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) in February 2006. 

 Kulti Works was a part of IISCO. But it was not considered in the revival plan as it was closed by then, says Roy, pressing for a fresh start for the countrys oldest steel plant. 

 Kulti around 18 km from Burnpur used to be a bustling township till the 1990s, drawing industrial workers and businessmen from across the country. 

 Today, a pall of gloom hangs over the township, which saw a decline of over 25,000 voters during the Assembly elections. Trimming-up operations and the freeze on appointments for over a decade had reduced the number of workers to 2,890 by January 2003, when another voluntary retirement scheme was announced. 

 It was initially decided that only 40 per cent of the workforce would be laid off. But in March, the management forced all employees to accept VRS. Most of them accepted it and left Kulti, says Roy. 

 But Roy and 39 others have not taken VRS and are running from pillar to post for a rethink on the selloff plans. 

 We have met Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan several times, says Roy. 

 Paswan yesterday announced that a committee would work out the future of Kulti Works and a decision taken in a month. 

 Even IISCO was put on the blocks. But then it was revived, says Roy, waiting for the day he would be able to smile like Banerjee and the 12,000-odd workers of IISCO Steel Plant.

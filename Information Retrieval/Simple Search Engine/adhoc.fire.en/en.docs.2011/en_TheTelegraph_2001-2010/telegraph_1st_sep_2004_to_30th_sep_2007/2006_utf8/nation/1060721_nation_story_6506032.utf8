 CAS in metros by year-end 

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 20: Delhi High Court today directed the Centre to implement the conditional access system (CAS) in three metros by the year-end ? a move that might mark the end of a long-drawn legal wrangle on the issue.

 By December 31, people in specified areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai will get to watch television using set-top boxes. Under CAS, viewers pay only for channels to which they have subscribed.

 The National Democratic Alliance government had notified the implementation of CAS in July 2003. It was implemented in Chennai but shelved in the other metros.

 Cable companies revived the idea a few months ago by petitioning the high court, saying they had invested crores in infrastructure.

 The court on March 10 asked the Centre to implement CAS within a month. But the information and broadcasting ministry sought more time.

 Today, a two-judge bench of Justices Vijinder Jain and Kailash Gambhir directed the Centre to issue a fresh notification on CAS by the end of this month and ensure its implementation by the year-end.

 The ministry later clarified that the court directive did not mean CAS coverage throughout the three metros but only in localities specified in the July 2003 notification. 

 Welcoming the ruling, Ashok Mansukhani, the head of multi-system operator Alliance in Mumbai, said: This is good news. Now viewers can watch 70 free-to-air channels along with pay channels they wish to see. Therefore, the consumer has the power to choose. We were ready with the set-top boxes even in 2003 and, therefore, there will be no problem for us.

 Hathway CEO K. Jayaraman agreed. We had been ready for a long time. The only aspects to be resolved are the pricing and the agreements and for that I think we will need five more months.

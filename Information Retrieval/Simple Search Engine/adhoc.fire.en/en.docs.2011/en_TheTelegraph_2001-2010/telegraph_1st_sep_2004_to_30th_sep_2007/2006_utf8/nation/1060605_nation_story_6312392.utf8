 Bajaj: RS call

 New Delhi/Mumbai, June 4: The Rajya Sabha could see the entry of another high-profile businessman if the political players reach a consensus on Rahul Bajaj.

 Along with the BJP and the Shiv Sena, Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party ? a Congress ally ? has decided to back Bajaj as the candidate to fill the Upper House vacancy created by the death of Pramod Mahajan.

 Ironically, the fast-paced developments began to unfold amid the high-voltage drama involving Mahajans son ? once considered a possible successor to his fathers seat ? in New Delhi.

 The Congress has yet to make up its mind on supporting Bajaj, who is expected to throw the hat into the ring only if the big parties reach a consensus.

 Highly-placed Congress sources said a decision would be taken late tonight on whether the party should go along with the others and support Bajaj or field a candidate and risk defeat. If the MLAs of the NCP, the Sena and the BJP vote together, the numbers favour Bajaj.

 Bajaj, who was outspoken in his criticism of the Union governments stand on quotas in higher education as well as the private sector, reached Mumbai this evening from Pune. Sources said the industrialist is in touch with some Congress leaders.

 Tomorrow is the last day for filing nomination papers for the election that will be held on June 15.

 The Congress was inclined to putting up its own candidate for the seat. Three Congress names were in circulation: that of Prabha Rau, the Maharashtra Congress president; Mukul Wasnik, an AICC general secretary; and former Sena MP Sanjay Nirupam. 

 But the Congress today suggested that Avinash Pandey, a former student leader, could be the candidate. A source said: It will not hurt if he has to be withdrawn later. Withdrawing Prabha Raus candidature would have been embarrassing since she is a senior leader.

 The Congresss original plan suffered a setback when Pawar, who is now in London, indicated to its leaders that he was inclined to backing old friend Bajaj.

 The Congress-NCP relations have hit rough patches from time to time, despite running a coalition government in Maharashtra for the second consecutive term.

 Pawar was reportedly resentful of the way the Congress kept picking up leaders who left the Sena, like Narayan Rane and Nirupam, and expanding its base, regionally and socially. The defeat of an NCP candidate during the recent legislative council elections had added to the strain.

 For the record, the NCP said it would support a secular candidate. Bajaj is modern, secular and a democrat, NCP general secretary D.P. Tripathi said in Mumbai.

 Sena spokesperson Subhash Desai said Bajaj is the common choice of the NCP, the Sena and the BJP.

 NCP sources claimed that the Congress would come around to supporting Bajaj.

 One factor that is forcing the Congress to take its time on a final decision is the reported misgivings of Arjun Singh about Bajaj. Arjun, whose pro-quota stand is well known, did not renew Bajajs tenure as chairman of IIT Mumbai when the issue came up for review.

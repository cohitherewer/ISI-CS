 Sleepless night for Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Feb. 27: A nervous Samajwadi Party prepared for a possible floor test tomorrow as the countdown began to a court decision on 40 of its MLAs who had defected from the Bahujan Samaj Party three years ago.

 The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court is expected to rule tomorrow whether the split in the BSP was legal under the anti-defection law.

 The question worrying Mulayam is: if the verdict goes against the 40, would they be disqualified or would they keep their memberships with the option of either resigning or going back to the BSP?

 The first scenario is better for the chief minister, for the exit of the 40 reduces the House strength from 403 to 363 and, therefore, the majority mark from 202 to 182.

 In the second scenario, BSP sources said, Mayavati might take the 40 back to spite Mulayam, pushing him towards a crisis at a time when the House is in session.

 The Samajwadi Party, which now has 194 MLAs, has issued a whip asking its legislators to be in the House tomorrow. In public, it put up a brave face, discussing only the disqualification scenario.

 If the 40 MLAs membership is declared invalid, the party might suffer a temporary setback. But it will have other members, including those of the RLD (Rashtriya Lok Dal) and Independents, to fill the void, a leader said.

 Disqualification of the 40 will leave the ruling party with 154 MLAs, 28 short of the new majority mark. The RLD has 15 members, and the Samajwadi Party claims it can gain the votes of enough unattached and independent MLAs to make up the numbers without having to depend on the Congress.

 The defections, which took place in August-September 2003 after the BJP brought the Mayavati government down, helped Mulayam form a ministry. The MLAs had first formed an independent group in the Assembly and later merged it with the Samajwadi Party.

 BSP legislature party leader S.P. Maurya had moved court against the decision of the then Speaker, Kesri Nath Tripathi, to recognise the splinter group and its subsequent merger with the Samajwadi Party. 

 Mauryas petition says 13 BSP members left the party on August 27, 2003, prompting him to request the Speaker on September 4 to disqualify them. Another 27 then walked out on September 6.

 But the combined figure of 40, the BSP argues, still falls foul of the anti-defection law, which requires two-thirds of a partys members to walk out for a legal split.

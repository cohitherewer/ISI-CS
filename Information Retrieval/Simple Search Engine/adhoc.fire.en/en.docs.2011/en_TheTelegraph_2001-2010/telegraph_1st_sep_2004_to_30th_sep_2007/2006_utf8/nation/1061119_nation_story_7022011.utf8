 XLRI student suicide sours homecoming

 Jamshedpur, Nov. 18: The suicide of a final-year student has shocked XLRI alumni who were in the city for Homecoming 2006, a two-day fest.

 Chandramohan S, a student of business management suffering from a rare disease, was found hanging from the ceiling of his second-floor hostel room last night around 11.30. He was taken to Tata Main Hospital where he was declared brought dead.

 A pall of gloom descended on the premier B-school campus after the incident. The fest has been cancelled. 

 We have to cancel all the programmes, said Jesal Doshi, executive member of external linkages at XLRI.

 Most former students, who had gathered from different parts of the country and abroad, left this afternoon after an informal lunch with XLRI director Fr Casimir Raj. 

 Twenty-three-year-old Chandramohan had got a job offer from a multinational company around a month ago. The one-page suicide note left behind by him said: I am suffering from Neumann-Pick disease, a disease of the brain which is almost like AIDS, and unable to bear the misery. I know that my decision will hurt my relatives, friends and, particularly, my parents but I have no choice.

 Written on white paper with a blue ballpoint pen, the note was kept on the laptop. A senior police officer investigating the case said the condition of his room and blood stains near the study table, where he probably browsed the Net to find out more about the disease, reveal that Chandramohan was determined to end his life.

 Just before hanging himself, the victim had cut his vein. He probably consumed some poisonous substance, too, before hanging himself from the ceiling fan with a bed sheet, he said.

 The cause of the death will be known only after the post-mortem is done after his parents arrive, the officer said. Chandramohans parents are likely to reach the city by tomorrow from Chennai.

 Deputy superintendent of police Sangeeta Kumari declined comment.

 XLRI director Fr N. Casimir Raj said: About 15 days ago, Chandramohan had gone to Chennai. He was suffering from chicken pox then. He returned three days ago and everything was normal. No one at the institute was aware of any type of disease or mental disorder that Chandramohan was suffering from.

 But one of his classmates said: Chandramohan turned a bit silent after returning from Chennai. I saw him last at lunch yesterday. Neither did he turn up for evening classes yesterday nor did he attend the quiz contest held after that. We found him hanging in his room around 11.30 pm.

 This is the first time a student has committed suicide at XLRI, the director said.

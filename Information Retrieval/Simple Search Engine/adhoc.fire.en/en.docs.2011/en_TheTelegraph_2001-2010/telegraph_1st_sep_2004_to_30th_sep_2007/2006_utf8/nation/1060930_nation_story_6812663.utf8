 Chandigarh, Sept. 29: When Prem Kumar Bedi came to meet his daughter in jail six months ago, he was heartbroken to see her in a plain, cotton salwar-kameez instead of the usual designer clothes.

 Today, the 65-old-year Norway-based garment trader struggled to express his emotions when he learnt that his actress daughter Monica must spend the next five years in jail uniform.

 My daughter is innocent. Ill do my best to bring my daughter out of the case as she is innocent. She has been misled. She cannot do illegal things, said the doting father who had brought bottles of imported shampoo, oil, and a range of lipsticks and facial creams for Monica during his visit to her jail.

 Monicas lawyers had raised the familys hopes, saying she might be let off with six months or so which meant immediate release because she had spent over 10 months in custody after being extradited from Portugal with gangster Abu Salem.

 We expected her to be released. But it seems that whatever Abu Salem has been charged with, she, too, will have to undergo the same charges, her brother Bobby said over the phone from Drammen, where the family runs a clothes store, Eurotekstil.

 She is not a terrorist and has no hand in any underworld dealings or blasts. She is paying a heavy price for becoming friendly with Salem.

 Salem is a prime accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts while Monica was fighting what was basically a passport forgery case. But she was today convicted also of the charge of criminal conspiracy.

 The Bedi family comes from Chhabewal village near Hoshiarpur in Punjab, over 70 of whose residents have moved to Norway. Monica was just 10 months old when the Bedis emigrated.

 Bobby said his mother Shakuntala and father Prem were devastated and depressed at the verdict and sentence, which the family plans to appeal in the Supreme Court.

 We are hopeful of an acquittal in Bhopal (where Monica faces another passport forgery case). We have full faith in the Indian judicial system and believe that my sister would be freed.

 Bobby said the family had not received any threats from Salems men even after Monica said last November that she had not married him.

 No one has threatened us so far. Threats will not scare us, Bobby said.

 He repeated that Salem had never visited the Bedis home in Drammen when he was on the run, and had no links with the family.

 We still dont know what made Monica befriend him. Monica was too innocent then. Even during her acting days, she always sought mummys advice on whom to befriend. Salem was never mentioned, Bobby said.

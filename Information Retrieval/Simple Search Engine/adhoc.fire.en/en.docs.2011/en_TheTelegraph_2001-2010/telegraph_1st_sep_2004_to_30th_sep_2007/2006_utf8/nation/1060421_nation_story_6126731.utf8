 New Delhi, April 20: IFS officer Rakesh Sharma, accused in a human trafficking case, appeared before the CBI today.

 Sources said the CBI, having served three notices on Kumar, was planning to issue a non-bailable warrant against the former special secretary (economic relations).

 The senior IFS officer was accused of sending a dance troupe, Mehak Punjab Di, illegally to Germany last year when he was director-general of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). Nine members of the group went missing after landing in Berlin. 

 CBI sources claimed that Har Gulab Singh, one of the persons named in the FIR, has agreed to become approver. Singh is also ready to confront Kumar during the next round of interrogation, which the CBI will be conducting soon, the sources added. 

 Kumar, who was sent summons to face investigators, got admitted to a hospital in Munich complaining of chest pain and high blood pressure. He did not appear before the CBI even after returning to India. Instead, he headed to Rishikesh to recuperate.

 Kumar, who has been stripped of his charge as special secretary by foreign secretary Shyam Saran, was questioned for close to eight hours today. 

 Sources said Kumar was interrogated mainly on three counts: 

 The source of Rs 4.5 lakh recovered from his residence

 Whether he had gone to Chandigarh in September 2005, around the same time he gave clearance to the Bhangra troupe.

 On what ground was the clearance given. 

 Kumar reportedly gave ambiguous answers to the CBI sleuths. He apparently told the interrogators that he had cleared the Bhangra troupe in good faith. He admitted that he had gone to Chandigarh, but on some other work and not to meet the members of the dance troupe. 

 Besides Kumar and Singh, others named in the FIR are programme officer of ICCR Kehkeshan Tyagi and Shiv Kumar Sharma, a Ludhiana-based conduit.

 Tyagi and Sharma have already been arrested and the CBI will match their claims with Kumars.

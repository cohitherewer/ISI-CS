 Food, biotech on business plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 2: Business leaders of India and the US have drawn up a blueprint that offers scope for greater foreign investment flows in food processing, biotech and energy and the creation of a $5-billion fund to boost infrastructure development.

 The India-US CEOs forum, headed by Ratan Tata and William Harrison, today submitted their report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush.

 I have been briefed on the main recommendations and I am happy to say that some of them are already reflected in the decisions which the President and I have taken today, Singh told the CEOs.

 The joint statement, which sets a target of doubling India-US trade in the next three years, places stress on removing impediments to FDI flows.

 The statement endorsed a plan to promote trade in agriculture goods. It will be acknowledged that India has the authority to certify that shipments of products to America meet organic standards of the US department of agriculture marketing services.

 Discussions will also be held on regulations affecting trade in fresh fruits, vegetables, poultry and dairy.

 Capacity building under food processing to reduce post-harvest losses in India is expected to represent an area of cooperation. 

 In the energy segment, clean coal technologies and ways to better tap coal bed methane and coal-mine methane will form an important part of the cooperation. Solar and photo-voltaic systems are also expected to be taken up. 

 Chief executive officers from the US wanted the Indian government to outline the roadmap for further opening up the economy. US companies are particularly keen on liberalisation of the retail and financial sectors in India.

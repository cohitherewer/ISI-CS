 Lamp ritual singes leader

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Nov. 12: A Dalit panchayat president in Tamil Nadu has put his secular party, the DMK, in a spot by allegedly getting Brahmin priests to conduct a yagna before assuming office.

 Gurusamy, 35, the new head of the Tiruvalanchuzhi panchayat in Thanjavur district, denied having performed any religious ceremony. He said he was only following custom by lighting a traditional lamp and burning incense sticks on entering the panchayat building. 

 In Bengal, CPM minister Subhas Chakraborty had used the same argument (I only followed custom) to justify his act of offering flowers in a Kali temple a couple of months ago.

 Tiruvalanchuzhi, close to the pilgrim centre of Swamimalai, one of the six shrines to Lord Murugan in the hills, was earlier reserved for women. It was placed in the general category this year as part of a rotation process under the Panchayati Raj Act. 

 Gurusamys immediate predecessor, Indira Gandhi, had won as an Independent in the 2001 elections when the reservation was in place.

 Gurusamy won hands down this time, but his celebrations have been cut short with Opposition leaders alleging that his secular mask has slipped.

 Indira Gandhis husband, Pichaimuthu, also alleged that Gurusamy from the other backward classes upper rungs performed the rituals to cleanse the office occupied by a lower-caste woman for five years. 

 Posters across Tiruvalanchuzhi village might have left Gurusamy red-faced, but ideology has to take a bow to custom, he said, like the Bengal communist leader.

 The charges are false and baseless, he told The Telegraph over the phone today. 

 I did nothing more than what custom dictates, Gurusamy added. 

 Was the ritual meant to rid the place of the last vestiges of the Dalit woman? 

 Gurusamy said: As a contractor taking up road construction and other work for the village, I myself employ a number of Dalits. My rivals cannot bear the fact of a young man having been elected panchayat president. 

 Moreover, we have reasons to believe that the previous chief had swindled funds. Before taking charge, I had asked for some documents. This angered them, he added.

 The row has surfaced on the eve of a programme being organised by the local administration and rural development minister M.K. Stalin in Chennai tomorrow to felicitate four Dalit panchayat presidents. 

 These heads of panchayat are from the villages of Pappapatti, Keeripatti, Nattarmangalam and Kottakachiendhal, where the upper castes had for over a decade refused to accept elected Dalits as their local body chiefs. 

 The four panchayats had been reserved for Dalits but elections had become farcical as the Dalit heads would resign immediately after being elected, fearing reprisal. 

 In 2006, the ruling DMK initiated a consensus-building drive among all communities to ensure that the Dalits got their due.

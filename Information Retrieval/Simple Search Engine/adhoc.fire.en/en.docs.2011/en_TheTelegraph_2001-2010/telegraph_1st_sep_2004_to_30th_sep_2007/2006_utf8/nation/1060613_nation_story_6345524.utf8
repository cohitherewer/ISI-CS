 Mamata faints at rally

 - Nature 

takes away heat of hike protest 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, June 12: Mamata Banerjee collapsed 

on stage while addressing supporters at Esplanade this afternoon, apparently unable 

to bear the humidity that made the city sweat through the day.

 After walking for half an hour from Mayo Road to Esplanade, she started speaking against the rise in fuel prices at 5 pm. 

 The Trinamul Congress chiefs head started reeling soon after. She gripped the microphone to avoid a heavy fall, but collapsed. 

MLA Partha Chatterjee and Madan Mitra caught Mamata. 

She lay on the stage for several minutes as party workers sprinkled water on her 

(PTI picture). 

 Former party MLA Saugata Roy later said: Her blood pressure was very low.

 After regaining consciousness, she spoke for a short while and returned home at Kalighat. 

 Critical care specialist Subrata Maitra said such fainting is caused by many factors, including extreme heat, fatigue, stress and strain. 

 A person needs rest and plenty of fluids to recover.

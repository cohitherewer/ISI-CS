 Rape swoop on Cong leader

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shimla: Jan. 22: A Congress leader is among six persons arrested on charges of raping a minor Dalit girl in Kangra district.

 The Congress leader, Manohar Lal, 37, is a former councillor of the Nurpur municipal corporation, 350 km from Shimla.

 The other persons arrested yesterday are Narinder alias Nitta, Sawan Kumar, Manjeet Kumar, Parveen alias Kikki and Bir Singh alias Biru. Two other accused, Bunty and Anu Kapoor, are absconding.

 One of the accused is said to be the son of a subdivisional officer.

 Manohar Lal is a Congress leader. We cannot say about (the political background of) others. Were searching for the two who are absconding, said Nathu Ram, the station house officer of Nurpur police station.

 The 16-year-old victim, in her complaint to the police, has alleged that she was gangraped by eight persons on January 19.

 According to the complaint, Bir Singh alias Biru raped the victim after enticing her by promising to marry her. She was then gangraped by seven others in a forest in the Hatli Jawalan village, said Nurpur deputy superintendent of police Vimukat Ranjan.

 The police organised an identification parade of the accused yesterday and moved an application under Section 164 of the CrPC in the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate.

 The incident happened when chief minister Virbhadra Singh was touring the district.

 The BJP has accused the police and the Congress government of hushing up the matter.

 The police is trying to hush up the matter as two Congress leaders are involved in the gangrape. The law and order situation in the state has taken a backseat as the government is shielding the criminals, said state BJP president Suresh Bhardwaj.

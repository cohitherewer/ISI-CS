 Air force trainer lands 

on belly

 ANIL BUDUR LULLA

 Bangalore, Aug. 21: A Kiran Mark I trainer belonging to the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE), an Indian Air Force unit, belly-landed at Bangalores HAL airport today.

 The pilot and an engineer who were aboard the two-seater trainer escaped unhurt but the accident on the runway disrupted civilian air traffic at the busy airport.

 The accident has given ASTE a prestigious unit which certifies the airworthiness of all IAF flying machines the dubious distinction of losing its third aircraft in 10 months.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had bestowed the prestigious IAF Standard on the ASTE unit last year.

 Airport sources said the runway was closed for one and a half hours and 14 flights, including a Sri Lankan Airlines flight to Colombo, were rescheduled. The damaged aircraft was towed away within 20 minutes of the crash-landing at 4.05 pm to the nearby ASTE hangar.

 Sources said the 28-year-old aircraft, manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), did not experience any technical failure during its routine practice sortie or while approaching the airport.

 Its undercarriage did not open and the aircraft landed on its belly. An investigation is on, sources said.

 It was being flown by Squadron Leader Beri and the engineer, Squadron Leader Santosh, was in the co-pilots seat.

 On October 26 last year, a MiG 21 piloted by Squadron Leader K.R. Murthy crashed because of a bird-hit even as it was taking off. Though the pilot ejected, his parachute dragged him into a ball of fire from the wreckage of the plane, which spun to a halt just off the runway. An engineer in the co-pilots seat, however, bailed out safely.

 In the next incident, on December 27, a Kiran Mark I trainer, similar to the aircraft involved in todays crash, developed a snag while flying back to the Bangalore airport, a few kilometres away from the city. Though both pilots ejected safely, the MiG 21 and the Kiran Mark I trainer have been written off.

 Kiran Mark I aircraft are used in the second stage of training of IAF fighter pilot recruits at the Air Force Academy, Hyderabad. The rookies are introduced to jet flying in this aircraft, very few of which are in operation.

 HALs Intermediate Jet Trainer, when inducted, will replace the ageing Kirans.

 On March 19, a Kiran Mark II aircraft of the IAFs famed Suryakiran aerobatic team crash-landed while on a routine training sortie near the Bidar air force station, killing both pilots.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Finance minister under fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Having targeted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for two days on the R.S. Pathak report, the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha today turned the heat on finance minister P. Chidambaram, saying he has links with industrialist Anil Agarwal.

 ADMK members, who raised the issue as soon as the House assembled, were joined by the Samajwadi Party members, all demanding the resignation of Chidambaram.

 A few members waved copies of a book which, they said, had references linking Chidambaram to Agarwal, whose Sterlite Group had acquired a majority stake in Balco, which was once a state-run company. 

 As the din continued, Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat adjourned the house till noon. 

 All through, Chidambaram remained unperturbed. Shekhawat, who ruled that nothing would go on record, barring the question listed, lamented the way the question hour was being stalled day after day.

 For a long time, there has been no question hour. Let it be allowed to be taken up, he pleaded with the unrelenting members.

 That Chidambaram would not be allowed to speak during the question hour today had been decided by the AIADMK, the Samajwadi Party and the Telugu Desam at a meeting yesterday.

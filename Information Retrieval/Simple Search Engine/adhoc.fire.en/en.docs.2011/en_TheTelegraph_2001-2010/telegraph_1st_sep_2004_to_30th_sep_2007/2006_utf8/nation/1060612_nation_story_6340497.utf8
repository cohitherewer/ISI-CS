 Chew on this: 

prawns now veg

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Like egg ...

 Bhopal, June 11: There comes a time in every Bengali childs intellectual development when he learns to his utter amazement that the prawn, no matter what mom says, is not a fish but an insect.

 For the population of Chhattisgarh, the learning curve has had more twists.

 Months after being informed by Bilaspur High Court that the egg is a non-vegetarian food because it doesnt grow on trees, the state has been told by its fisheries minister that the prawn is vegetarian fare.

 Why? Because the prawn resembles an egg which the minister ? disagreeing with the judges ? holds to be vegetarian food.

 ... Like prawn

 For one thing, the protein-rich prawn comes covered in a shell, Moti Kashyap told a surprised audience at a function to promote aquaculture on the banks of the Narmada.

 Also, both (eggs and prawns) solidify after being boiled. And just as poultry eggs are not hatched, prawns, too, do not reproduce in fresh water, the BJP minister produced the clinching argument.

 Born in a fishermens community, Kashyap may be expected to be an authority on the subject. But his party and government ? who got eggs banished from vegetable markets on strength of the court ruling last October ? arent amused.

 Former BJP chief minister Sunderlal Patwa has advised Kashyap to apologise, Jain seers Vidyasagarji and Poorna Sagar Maharaj have condemned his remarks, the Opposition Congress has asked for the ministers head to be examined, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has asked for his head, plain and simple.

 Kashyap needs an immediate check-up at the psychiatric centre in Agra, state Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal sneered. Well pay for his medical expenses.

 A chastened Kashyap has told The Telegraph he is ready to apologise to the communities whose feelings he has hurt.

 The minister and his critics may not know this, but eateries in Japan, Thailand and many other eastern Asian countries serve imitation prawn and fish, dressed up to look like the original.

 Battered and deep-fried fake prawn in white wine sauce comes for approximately 130 baht (Rs 155) in Bangkok, and is served with boiled vegetables, pasta and carbonara sauce. It has a bouncy, meaty texture and boasts a delicious sweet flavour.

 Similarly, fake lobster bisque (a soup) is priced at 75 baht (Rs 90), coming with chunks of crunchy vegetables and imitation seafood. 

 Its rather thin compared with the rich and thick original, but the taste and flavour are almost the same.

 Kashyap, the true Ram bhakt that he is, believes the Lord will save him. He says men from his Kevat community, according to the Ramayana, had ferried Ram, Sita and Lakshman across the Saryu as they left on their 14-year exile.

 Rams blessings continue to be with us and I will come out unscathed, he said.

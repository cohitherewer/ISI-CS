 Job probation jolt

 New Delhi, Jan. 8 (PTI): Those who thought confirmation was automatic after their period of probation had better think again.

 Delhi High Court has ruled theres no such guarantee even if an employee completes the maximum probation period.

 The ruling came on an appeal against the order of a single-judge bench, which upheld the decision of the Karnataka Handloom Development Corporation to terminate the services of a person after serving him a showcause notice for unsatisfactory conduct.

 B.S. Chopras counsel argued that since his client completed two years of probation, as stipulated in the appointment letter, his services should be deemed confirmed.

 The counsel also said since the notice preceded the termination but no inquiry followed, the order was punitive in nature and, therefore, invalid.

 But Chief Justice M. Katju and Justice M.B. Lokur dismissed the appeal. The bench said just because no inquiry followed the showcause, it did not mean the termination order was punitive and nor was it invalid.

 The judges cited earlier Supreme Court rulings to make their point.

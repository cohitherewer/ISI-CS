 New Delhi, March 15: Thanks to a tactical rapprochement with the Samajwadi Party, the Congress thinks it has tided over the Varanasi episode without too much damage to its own image and that of the UPA government.

 But Uttar Pradesh, where the blasts took place, remains a major problem zone, party sources concede.

 Having extended a conciliatory arm to the Samajwadi Party mainly to avert a communal backlash after the blasts, the Congress is now worried whether it would be able to up the ante against the heartland rival in the immediate future.

 The sources stressed that the transient peace the Congress bought with the Samajwadi Party must not be construed as the beginning of a larger alliance. The battle has to be fought and Mulayam Singh Yadav is a political foe, one of the sources said.

 While the Congress is unlikely to raise the pitch for sacking the Uttar Pradesh government and placing the state under central rule, sources said a fresh offensive against Mulayam would focus on the deteriorating law and order, the propensity of some of his colleagues to isolate the Muslims with their shrill rhetoric and corruption.

 The Congress sources said they took comfort from reports of how Islamic clerics and scholars spoke out against the trend among militant groups to invoke the Prophets name to legitimise their acts of violence. 

 That some seminaries issued edicts against those indulging in terrorist acts in the name of Islam is an encouraging sign. Mulayams party members have painted Muslims as hawks and Hindus as the enemy to increase the sense of insecurity among the minorities. The Congresss tradition will not countenance this brand of politics, a Congress leader said.

 He conceded that the partys dilemma so far was how to respond convincingly to the inflammable language used by some Samajwadi politicians. 

 But if Lucknows Firangi Mahal (Indias oldest Islamic order) slammed terrorism in the name if Islam, its an encouraging sign for us. The battles not lost, said the leader, who is a member of the partys minorities cell.

 Rather than make it a battle between Muslim liberals and fundamentalists, the sources said, the Congress would like to enlarge the political ambit to project it as a fight between the liberals and hardliners from Hindus as well as Muslims.

 The sources said rather than have Muslim members of the Congress react to the BJPs twin yatras, it was politically prudent for its Hindu leaders to speak out. 

 The parliamentary affairs and information and broadcasting minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, was on cue when he dismissed the yatras as the Sudarshan (after the RSS chief) yatra and the Jinnah yatra.

 The Sudarshan rath, said Das Munshi, was being steered by BJP chief Rajnath Singh only to cosy up more to the RSS while L.K. Advani would try and justify what he said on Jinnah on his Jinnah rath. 

 At the end of the day, Jinnah divided the nation and Advanis Jinnah yatra will further divide India, he said.

 As for the negative fallout among the Muslims from the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Congress sources said the partys foreign policy articulations from now on would stress more on points like Indias opposition to the US invasion of Iraq, its harmonious relations with China and its civilisational links with Iran.

 The idea is to deflect attention from the US and Bush and show that India will not allow itself to be used as a pawn in a larger plan to upset the power equations in South Asia, a source said.

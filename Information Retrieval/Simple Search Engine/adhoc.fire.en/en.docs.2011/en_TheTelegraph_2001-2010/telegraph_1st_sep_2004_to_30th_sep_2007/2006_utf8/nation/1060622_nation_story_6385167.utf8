 CPM exhorts people to fight 

 - Maoist-hit village told not to rely on police 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 21: A day after Maoist guerrillas shot dead two CPM leaders at Chandpur village in Bengals Nadia district, the local leadership asked villagers to arrange for self-defence without relying too much on police.

 Just stopping short of asking them to take up arms, Nadia CPM secretary Ashu Ghosh said: Resist the Maoists. Do not rely too much on police. They are government employees? dont expect much from them. You have to ensure your own security.

 He went on to say: When the style of attack is changing, the style of self-defence also has to change.

 Ghosh virtually echoed state CPM secretary Biman Bose who, during his visits to Maoist-hit Purulia and Bankura districts before the Assembly elections, had asked villagers to take up arms against the rebels. 

 Make sure that not a single extremist escapes, he told a rally at Bandwan, about 270 km from Calcutta, where CPM leader Rabi Kar and his wife Anandamoyee were burnt to death on December 31. 

 The state government, which had initially claimed that the Maoists were limited to only some pockets in the jungles of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura, recently expressed concern over the increase in guerrilla attacks and their spread. 

 A special operations group was formed towards the end of 2005 to combat the menace in the three districts. 

 But early on Tuesday morning, the Maoists for the first time struck outside their known strongholds. 

 About 20 masked guerrillas dressed in black and armed with muskets entered the village, about 120 km from Calcutta, and shot dead Uttam Sar- dar and Swapan Sardar, both tribal leaders, after abusing them for not quitting the CPM as instructed.

 Party chief Bose will visit Chandpur tomorrow.

 The district leadership today admitted that party workers and leaders in Krishnagar, Chapra and Nakashipara ? all around 100 km from Calcutta ? were being threatened by CPI (Maoist) activists. I have already submitted a report to the state party leadership, Ghosh said. 

 When Ghosh arrived at Chandpur this morning, Saraswati and Juthika, the widows of the two slain leaders broke down at his feet. 

 Why did you not come to our husbands rescue after the Maoists warned them not to campaign during the Assem- bly election? Why have you come now, when it doesnt matter any longer? cried Uttams widow, Saraswati. 

 Local party leaders described how Uttam and Swapan had defied the Maoists threats and campaigned for the party candidate from Krishnagar East, Subinoy Ghosh. 

 The MLA was in the village today, when it doesnt matter any longer for the bereaved families.

 The Maoists repeatedly put up posters in the area asking the villagers to boycott the elections. But Uttam and Swapan saw to it that every adult voted, a local party member said. 

 Inspector-general of police (south Bengal) Surajit Kar Purakayastha also met the two widows and questioned some of the villagers.

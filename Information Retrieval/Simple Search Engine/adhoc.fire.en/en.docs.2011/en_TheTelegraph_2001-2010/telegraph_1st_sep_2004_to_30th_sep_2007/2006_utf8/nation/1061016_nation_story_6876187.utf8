 B-school badge for Gandhigiri

 - IIM-a May take tips from Munna

 A still from Lage Raho Munnabhai

 After a dose of Lalu Prasads rustic charm, the countrys top B-school is ready to be swept by the appeal of Gandhigiri.

 And it could be the man who coined the term who finds himself lecturing on the idea at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

 If it happens, no one would be more surprised than Abhijit Joshi, script-writer for Lage Raho Munnabhai. 

 When Joshi invented Gandhigiri, he wasnt at all sure it would be as successful as the jadoo ki jhappi of the first Munnabhai movie.

 It was just important to make the film different from the first one, Munnabhai MBBS, and Gandhism was very close to Mr Sunil Dutts heart, who in turn was very close to both Vishal (Bhardwaj, the films director) and of course Sanju (Sanjay Dutt), he said.

 The challenge was to make Gandhism attractive to todays youth. None of us involved in the film was too confident that Gandhigiri would work as an idea, Joshi said over phone.

 It has, and how.

 After rocking the box office, and even briefly intruding into a Congress Working Committee meeting, Gandhigiri is set to invade classrooms at some of the countrys premier B-schools.

 Management teachers want their students to learn not only from Gandhis strategies but also from the way the films makers successfully sold his ideas, packaging what some considered an outdated thought as a practical, modern-day way of life.

 The Birla Institute of Management Technology, Noida, on Saturday held a panel discussion on Gandhigiri: Lessons for the business world and management profession, while the Indian Management Institute (IMI), Delhi, plans a lecture soon.

 Apart from studying the films remarkable success, we want our students to dwell on Gandhian values in todays world of dog-eat-dog competition, said IMI director R. Venkatratnam.

 He believes there is a lot that Indian business can learn from Gandhigiri which he has no difficulty identifying with Gandhis own philosophy.

 For instance, what has been the contribution of Indian business to making society and economy inclusive so that the fruits of development are distributed to the poor as well? he said.

 Tushar Gandhi, the Mahatmas grandson, agrees. Today more than ever, we need Gandhian thought to be popular among an increasingly disoriented youth. Gandhigiri does that, which is why I supported the movie as well.

 For IIM Ahmedabad, nothing less than a lesson from the horses mouth will do. It plans to get members of the cast and crew of Lage Raho to deliver the lecture.

 Our students have to learn to be constantly on the ball when it comes to catching the markets pulse. What better way than to interact with the flavour of the season? said a senior professor who was at a recent meeting where the faculty and administration discussed Gandhigiri.

 In between its hectic academic schedule, the institute finds time for guest lectures, such as the one Lalu Prasad recently delivered on how he had turned the railways fortunes around. The overwhelming response to that performance has only whetted the institutes appetite for more earthy success stories.

 But getting the people behind the film to come is proving a little difficult. They all have busy schedules, which is why we havent been able to fix a date yet, a senior administrator said.

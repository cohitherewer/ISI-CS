 Air force fleet revamp takes wing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, April 30: The IAF family seems to be on Mission Upgrade.

 For the first time ever, dozens of aircraft in its stable are being withdrawn from operational duty and dozens lined up for upgrade.

 Starting from the notorious MiGs to the latest Su-30s, six of the eight types of fighters in the fleet have been sent for upgrade in the last 12 months. Transport aircraft and helicopters have not been left out either.

 Senior air force officials said the programme had been undertaken as there could be no compromise on the airworthiness and combat readiness of the fleet.

 The IAF has an aging fleet of fighters, transports and copters that need to be replaced as soon as possible. But faced with a history of political indifference, the latest avionics, navigation and weapon delivery suites are being used to prolong their lives.

 We are sending a number of aircraft in our fleet for upgrades. But, like always, we have maintained a minimum level of combat readiness, air officer maintenance, Air Marshal B.U. Chengappa, said at the Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification lab recently.

 Although the upgrades began last year, it appears they will continue till next year if the order books of defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited are anything to go by.

 HAL has taken up the massive programme but the actual number and types of aircraft being sent for upgrade are a closely-held secret.

 The next series in the line-up are the MiG 29s and MiG 27s. Work on the MiG 29s will begin any time now. A Bangalore lab, DARE, will upgrade the MiG 27s at HALs Nashik plant. Work is expected to begin this month.

 The Jaguars have just been delivered back to the air force along with Darin II navigation attack systems while the Su-30 upgrade to MKI is expected to be completed ahead of schedule in the next two weeks.

 Air headquarters is also in the final stages of giving its nod to Mirage upgrades.

 A separate parallel programme is on to upgrade transport aircraft and helicopters. The HS 748 Avros are being refurbished at HALs Khanpur division. Even the vintage Canberra reconnaissance aircraft have been certified to fly till 2009.

 Among helicopters, user trials are on for the Cheetal, a re-engined Cheetah, and the Chetan, a re-engined Chetak. A Mi 17 programme is being planned.

 The massive scale on which the upgrade is proceeding suggests the air force might not drag its feet about buying some 126 fighters and 44 helicopters it requires.

 This decision to purchase fighters and helicopters should be taken soon and cannot be taken lightly like the AJT Hawk which took nearly 20 years to conclude, a senior officer at the Bangalore-based Training Command said.

 The Hawks are expected to join the fleet at Bidar only in mid-2007.

 One sniff, and cats out of bag

 SMELL-SMART

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: Through studies on rats given whiffs of banana oil, eucalyptus and rosewater, scientists in Bangalore have shown that rats can determine the direction of smells through stereoscopic noses.

 While scientists have speculated for years that rats as well as some other mammals might be using stereo cues to localise the sources of odours, there has been limited experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis.

 Now, Upinder Bhalla at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in Bangalore and his colleagues have shown that rats can zero in on smells with the help of a stereo processing system that takes in differences in the intensity of smells and the time when the smell arrives in each nostril. The process is similar to the stereo processing of sounds by humans.

 The scientists said rats might be using this ability to both find food as well as to escape predators. 

 When chased by a cat, a rat might tell in a single sniff whether its coming at it from the right or left and quickly get out of the way, Bhalla said.

 In a study that appeared in todays issue of the American journal Science, the NCBS team has reported that rats could localise odours in one or two sniffs. The internostril differences in the intensity and timing of smells provide cues for direction finding.

 The researchers trained rats to lick different water spouts after a quick sniff of their surroundings to indicate whether a smell came from the right or the left side. The rats needed just one sniff and about 50 milliseconds to determine the direction of the smell.

 In the 1960s, Hungarian-born American biophysicist Georg von Bekesy had provided some experimental evidence that humans might also determine the direction of smell through stereo abilities. 

 But people use vision or sound which are far more advanced senses in humans, Bhalla said. Rats are much better with smells. Their range of odours is greater and their sense of smell is more important than vision or sound.

 Rat nostrils are about 3mm apart and appear too close to support stereo sampling. But studies through their respiratory tracts have shown that nasal airflow is directed into separate passages. Olfactory information is separated in the nasal passages and the separation extends to the olfactory bulb, the first region of the brain that receives signals from the nose.

 The studies have shown that 90 per cent of the neurons in the olfactory bulb respond differently to smells coming from the right and the left side.

 While stereo smell in rats has been established, scientists speculate that it may be common in other mammals that rely on olfaction ? dogs, for instance. Dog nostrils have wider separation ? a feature helpful for stereo, Bhalla said.

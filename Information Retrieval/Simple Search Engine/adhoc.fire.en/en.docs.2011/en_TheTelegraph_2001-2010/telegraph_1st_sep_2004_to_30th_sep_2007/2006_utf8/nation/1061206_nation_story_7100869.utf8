 Bihar gives Centre a lesson in RTI 

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: For the first time in his life, Ramesh Suri is wondering why he left Bihar for Delhi.

 The 25-year old civil services aspirant had left the state of his birth after his Class X secondary examinations. His family had told him there was little hope for him in Bihar. I used to top my class in school and my family wanted me to get into a college, he says.

 Ten years and a Jawaharlal Nehru University education later, Suri is thinking of going back to his state.

 Had I appeared for the Bihar State Service Commission (BSSC) I would have had better chances, he says, virtually moaning. 

 Perhaps.

 People might ridicule Bihar for being corrupt, but the BSSC has done what its counterpart at the Centre refuses to divulge details of examinations it conducts.

 Twenty-five candidates who had asked for the cut-off marks in the preliminary exams to the states bureaucracy got what they were looking for. And more.

 The BSSC in its response has called the students who had applied for the details the future of the state, displaying encouragement for transparency seekers in the state.

 All this while, the Union Public Service Commission has sought a stay on a Central Information Commission order asking for a similar disclosure on the exams it conducts, after the exam process is over.

 We were initially apprehensive about disclosing cut-off marks, after all we never have in the past. But disclosing the cut-offs for the various categories (general and reserved) helps shore up the credibility of the body, an under secretary at the BSSC said over telephone from Patna.

 Nor is Bihar alone.

 Based on an order by the Uttar Pradesh State Information Commission on October 23, the states Public Service Commission has revealed the marks of everyone who sat for the preliminary exams for this year.

 The Uttar Pradesh public services commission generally receives the highest number of applicants around 80,000 a year.

 It just needed a click of the mouse, where was the problem in disclosing the preliminary exam marks to all the students, J.P. Singh, under secretary there, said.

 He was, of course, conveniently forgetting that the first application from the students in July this year had been rejected by the State Services Commission, prompting students to use the Right to Information Act.

 Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have gone exactly the same route as Uttar Pradesh getting rapped by the state information commissions and then disclosing details of the cut offs for various categories. No RTI complaints have been filed on this in other states.

 About 2,000 aspirants to the central civil services had sought details such as cut-off and break up of marks, the number of applicants, and the marks they obtained in the preliminary UPSC exams for this year.

 After the UPSC refused to disclose the details, the students approached the Central Information Commission, which on November 13 ordered that the details be made public. 

 But on November 27, Delhi High Court stayed the order till January 16.

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The directorate-general of civil aviation today announced fresh guidelines for safe and orderly air traffic in the event of fog at Delhi airport.

 The guidelines include passenger facilitation if fog causes delay or cancellation.

 The DGCA told all airlines and airport operators that the low-visibility procedures prepared for the operation of the aircraft up to CAT III B visibility condition at Delhi airport shall (need to) be strictly followed by all agencies at the airport, including the security agencies.

 The CAT III B system allows flights to land when visibility is poor.

 The DGCA has also reviewed the winter schedule of all airlines for movement out of Delhi and has asked some of them to withdraw 19 domestic flights, which can be clubbed with other flights to ease the traffic. A special fog control room has been set up.

 Airlines have to ensure that only pilots adequately trained and certified for take-off in fog are assigned flights in low visibility.

 The DGCA said low-visibility procedures would start the moment runway visibility drops to 800 metres or less. This would be continuously monitored by the Met department and individual airlines.

 The airlines are required to plan departures and arrivals, and start the necessary facilitation process for passengers, once they learn that runway visibility is poor.

 Passengers faced a harrowing morning today on top of yesterdays chaos. Flight operations were disrupted in dense fog between 5.30 am and 9 am, forcing a runway shutdown for more than an hour.

 After sunrise, the fog began dispersing and flights started taking off. 

 The CAT-III B instrument landing system was activated around 5.30 am to help six Indian flights and some international flights to land in near-zero visibility.

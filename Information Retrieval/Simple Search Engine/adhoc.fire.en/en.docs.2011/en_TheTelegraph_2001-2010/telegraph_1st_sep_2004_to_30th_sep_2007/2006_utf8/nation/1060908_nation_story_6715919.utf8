The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 India, Lanka in envoy row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Surprised by the outburst of Sri Lankan tourism minister Anura Bandaranaike against Indian high commissioner Nirupama Rao, Delhi today denied interfering in the internal affairs of the island nation and rallied behind the diplomat.

 It is not the policy of Government of India and its representative abroad to interfere in the internal affairs of any country, it said. 

 Yesterday, in the Lankan parliament, Bandaranaike was reported to have asked Rao to mind her own business and not meddle in the islands affairs. It was not clear what prompted the minister to make such a scathing comment, which left officials in both Delhi and Colombo stunned.

 The pretty Rao should look after her embassy and we will look after our own internal affairs, a Sri Lankan paper quoted Bandaranaike as saying.

 India said Raos contribution to strengthen Indo-Lankan relations has been well appreciated by the host government. She is a senior diplomat and has conducted herself in accordance with the highest professional standards, a spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs said.

 The Indian diplomat came under attack days after the Lankan deputy high commissioner in Chennai, P. Amza, faced the wrath of the MDMK.

 MDMK chief Vaiko, a known sympathiser of the LTTE, handed over a memorandum to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week demanding the expulsion of the Lankan diplomat for commenting against a resolution passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly on the islands ethnic crisis. He also asked Delhi to put pressure on Colombo to return to peace talks and stop the genocide of ethnic minorities.

 A buzz about interference by Indian authorities has emerged from Colombos political establishment in the past, but this time it came as a surprise as Indian and Lankan governments have been co-ordinating closely on the resumption of peace talks.

 Rao, the first woman Indian high commissioner in Colombo, has engaged the Lankan government in the peace process. India does not want to be seen as an active player in Lankan affairs. 

 Pakistan envoy Bashir Wali Mohammad, too, turned the heat on India recently when he claimed that Delhi had masterminded the unsuccessful attempt on his life in Colombo. It was earlier believed that the Tigers had targeted the diplomat for colluding with the Lankan government to incite Tamil Muslims against their movement.

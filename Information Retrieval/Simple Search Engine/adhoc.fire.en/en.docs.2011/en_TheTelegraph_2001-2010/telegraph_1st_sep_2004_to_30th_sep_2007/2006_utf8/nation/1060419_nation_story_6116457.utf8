 New Delhi, April 18: A day after the Supreme Court nudged the Prime Minister to try and solve the Narmada rehabilitation dispute, Medha Patkar piled pressure on him.

 Manmohan Singh found himself accused of ignoring the poor soon after he spoke to business leaders about ways to balance development and the rehabilitation of those it displaces.

 The PM has talked about development at a CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) function today. Sometimes I wish he would listen to the poor and the displaced, too, Patkar said.

 She said she was extremely disappointed at the way Singh had chosen to ignore the survey report by Saifuddin Soz and two other central ministers rebutting Madhya Pradeshs claim of having rehabilitated every family in the Sardar Sarovar dams submergence areas.

 Patkar said she would start a nationwide pol khol campaign to expose all the falsehoods about rehabilitation in the Narmada valley.

 We apprised everyone in the government ? from (Planning Commission deputy chairman) Montek Singh Ahluwalia to the President of India ? of the truth about the rehabilitation. But now we know who the government listens to and who it doesnt. Obviously, Narendra Modis threats are taken more seriously here, Patkar said.

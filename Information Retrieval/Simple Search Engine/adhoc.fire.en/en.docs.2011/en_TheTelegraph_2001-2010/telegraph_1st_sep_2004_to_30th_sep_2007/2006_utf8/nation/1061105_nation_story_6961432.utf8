 Nine killed in roof collapse

 Hyderabad (PTI): Nine labourers were killed when the roof of an under-construction building collapsed in Visakhapatnam.

 Nine persons were also injured in the incident that took place in Sector VI of the steel city complex on Friday. 

 All the victims were construction workers from neighbouring villages who were resting when the mishap occurred.

 The Opposition Telugu Desam Party has demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident and Rs 3 lakh ex-gratia for the families of the victims.

 Record surgery at 100

 New Delhi (PTI): A 100-year-old woman 

 has successfully undergone a gall bladder laparoscopic operation 

 here and this could well find a place in the record books. 

 Gowardhan Kaur underwent the surgery at a private hospital on October 27 and is now back to her normal routine, Dr Arun Prasad, the surgeon who operated on her, said. 

 Kaur had been suffering from acute pain due to multiple gall stones and could not bear the idea of daily injections to control pain. Her son then approached Dr Prasad, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals, who was reluctant to do the surgery citing her old age. But medical tests found her heart, liver, lungs and kidney to be normal. 

 The doctors have sent the case to the Guinness World Records and the Limca Book of Records for recognition.

 We sent an application after finding out that Kaur is the oldest reported case. The last entry was of an 89-year-old man in the UK, Dr Prasad said.

 PC terror link

 Kozhikode (PTI): Experts are trying 

 to find out if the computer seized by the police during 

 a raid here was used by Mohammed Fahad for transactions 

 with the Al Badr terror outfit and for sending emails to 

 Pakistan.

 Fahad is one of the two suspected Pakistani militants arrested in Mysore on October 27.

 Three drowned

 Garhmukteshwar (PTI): Three persons 

 drowned in the Ganga during Kartik Mela on Friday. Five 

 others were rescued. Ghaziabad district magistrate M.K.S. 

 Sundram said the water level of the river had risen due 

 to heavy discharge from Hardwar.

 Life for rapist

 Moga (PTI): A court has sentenced a 

 youth to life imprisonment for the kidnap and rape of an 

 eight-year-old two years ago. Parvinder Singh, 20, alias 

 Bhinda, had kidnapped the girl while she was playing near 

 her house.

 More than 70 educational institutions from the UK are taking part 

 in an education fair in Delhi. The fair will travel to seven 

 other cities, including Calcutta, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and 

 Kochi.

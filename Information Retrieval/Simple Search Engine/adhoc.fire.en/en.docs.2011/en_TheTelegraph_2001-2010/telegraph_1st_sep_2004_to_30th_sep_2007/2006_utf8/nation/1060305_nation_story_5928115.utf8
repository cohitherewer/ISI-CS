 Reactors to carry on doing double duty

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, March 4: Indian military nuclear reactors would continue to supply electricity to the civilian grid. Sounds strange? But its true.

 Although everyone has got caught in the numbers game of how many Indian nuclear reactors would be kept out of international safeguards and inspections, one of the most amazing parts of the civilian and military nuclear facilities separation plan is precisely this.

 The nuclear plants which would be kept out of the civilian list would not be disconnected from the electricity grid.

 The US negotiators were in the numbers game ? how many functioning or under-construction reactors would be kept out of safeguards and how many would be offered to the IAEA for safeguards and inspections. They offered a simple enough formula ? those nuclear plants which were connected to the electricity grid were civilian and those that were not were military.

 But this did not work for India. The complication was that Indias nuclear programme had developed as an undifferentiated one. 

 While six reactors with international technology and material links were already under safeguards (two at Tarapur, two at Kudankulam and one in Rajasthan), the rest of the indigenous reactors were producing electricity for the grid as well as fissile material for the strategic or weapons programme. So the US classification of any reactor connected to the grid being civilian was not relevant for India.

 The challenge before the Indian negotiators was how to classify reactors as military without disconnecting them from the gird in an energy-starved situation. Finally, the US side was persuaded that the fact that a nuclear reactor was connected to the grid and was producing electricity had no relevance to whether it is civilian or military.

 Presumably, that determination was to be made by how the spent fuel from the reactor was being used ? whether it was being reprocessed for weapons, going into any un-safeguarded reactor like the fast-breeder reactor or not. When the US side agreed to this, the numbers business was behind India.

 If the US had not agreed to this, the cost of electricity production would have risen dramatically for India as all reactors designated as military would have had to be disconnected from the electricity grid. Meeting that short-fall in electricity would have been an expensive proposition.

 The US negotiators then desired to know about Indias military nuclear programme and to find out how much would be enough for Indias minimum credible deterrent. The next challenge for the Indian side was to argue that the nuclear deal was about Indias civilian nuclear programme and, therefore, there could be no debate on the countrys strategic programme.

 They argued that the concept of minimum credible deterrent was a dynamic one and could change over time. Hence, they argued that the US question could not only not be answered, India was also unwilling to engage with it.

 In the end, the Indian negotiators managed to link together the numbers of reactors, their designation (civilian or military) and the sovereign and sole right of India to classify its future reactors as it wishes in one of the two categories. That was how the separation plan was born.

 It resulted in 50 per cent of all Indian nuclear reactors ? installed and under-construction ? being offered for international safeguards and inspections. The total number of such reactors up to the year 2014 would be 22. 

 Of this, 14 would be on the civilian list ? since six of these reactors were already under international safeguards, it meant of the 16 un-safeguarded reactors half would be put under safeguards and half would be reserved for military purposes.

 In terms of the installed capacity, this was in keeping with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement in Parliament that only 65 per cent of the installed nuclear capacity would be offered under safeguards. What was also made clear was that anything upstream or downstream linked to anything strategic would not be in the civilian list.

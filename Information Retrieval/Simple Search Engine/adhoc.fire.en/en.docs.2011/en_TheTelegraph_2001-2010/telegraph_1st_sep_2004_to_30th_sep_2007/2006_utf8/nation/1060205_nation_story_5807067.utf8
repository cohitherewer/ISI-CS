 Babbar mouthful for Amar Singh

 Raj Babbar

 New Delhi/Lucknow, Feb. 4: 

 Just when the dust was beginning to settle on the phone-tap 

 drama, Amar Singhs colleague Raj Babbar has called 

 him worse names than Ambika Soni did.

 If the Congress leader called Amar a fund manager, Babbar pointing a finger at him for criminalisation and corruption.

 Babbar has announced an ideological war against morally degenerate elements in the Samajwadi Party.

 The Agra MP said there was widespread resentment in the party against Amars brand of politics and he was voicing the concerns of senior leaders and party workers.

 Babbar said socialism was getting a bad name because of people who join politics only to make money.

 I dont need to take his name. The moment I mention his traits, everyone knows who I am talking about. It is not an individual angst; Amar Singhji has been extremely kind to me.

 He got my house evacuated. Some goons were living there. But Ill tell you something, he is good only for such things as throwing goons out of your house. What I am talking about is words alien to such people ? values and ideology, he said.

 Babbar denied he was attacking Amar because he wanted to join the Congress. Who said I want to quit the party? I am relieved that at least I am being clubbed with a secular party. Otherwise, these corrupt elements would force me to join hands with the communal elements.

 Referring to the phone-tapping episode, he said it is not the reason for his anguish. Why should I be bothered about who is talking to which woman in private? My problem is with the kind of politics being promoted by such people.

 They are giving the party a bad name, sullying the image of our leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and alienating genuine and ideologically-driven leaders and party workers, Babbar said.

 Amar could not be contacted. But in an interview to a Hindi paper, he said: I am tired by the huge load of party work. It will be good if I am relieved of responsibility. I am desperate to get earned leave.

 Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh declined comment. This is an internal matter of the party and newsmen should not unnecessarily bother about it.

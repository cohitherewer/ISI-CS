 Pay blow to daily wagers

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: A person engaged by the government on a temporary basis for any particular job does not have the right to claim the regular scale of pay stipulated for the post, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 Dismissing a Madhya Pradesh High Court order, a bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said the doctrine of equal pay for equal work is not applicable to daily wagers who are not appointed according to the statutory rules.

 Referring to the general rule that government posts can be filled only through an open competition, the court said people engaged on daily wages do not hold any post and are not entitled to any scale of pay.

 The ruling gives a free hand to the government to engage people on short-term contracts at cheaper rates.

 The Madhya Pradesh government, which had engaged some persons on daily wages for the work of assistant grade III, had appealed in the apex court after the high court directed it to pay them wages and allowances fixed for the post.

 The state government contended that the employees, whose remuneration was fixed at Rs 97.14 per day, were not engaged on any vacant post and, hence, payment on a regular scale was not permissible under law. The posts of assistant grade III had to be filled in terms of the procedure laid down in the rec- ruitment rules framed by the state government in 1976, it said.

 The apex court noted that the aggrieved employees could claim salary on a regular scale only if they had a right to be regularised in the service. If any recruitment is made by way of regularisation, the same would mean a back-door appointment, which does not have any legal sanction, it said.

 The court rejected the workers claim on the ground that they were recruited only to meet the exigencies of the situation. No post was sanctioned. Vacancies were not notified.

 Directing the state government to fill the posts according to the rules, the court has, however, also asked it to give these daily wagers the benefit of age relaxation for the period of their service while considering them for employment along with other candidates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dozen held for beating doctor 

 OUR BUREAU

 June 13: A doctor, who was brutally assaulted by a mob after the death of a patient at a hospital in Bengals Hooghly district yesterday, is still in a critical condition. 

 Doctors at the private hospital in Calcutta where Anadi Rajwar was brought unconscious said his condition continues to be serious.

 In a knee-jerk reaction, the government today said private security guards would be deployed in all 13 ESI Hospitals across the state. At least one doctor went on record saying his family wanted him to quit a government hospital because it was not safe enough.

 Around 12.15 pm yesterday, relatives of a jute mill worker and a group of local people attacked the assistant superintendent of Gaurhati ESI Hospital in Chandernagore, about 40 km from Calcutta, because another doctor allegedly did not attend to him when he felt pain in the chest.

 Rajkumar Rajbhar, 45, was admitted to the hospital on Sunday afternoon with chest pain. He again felt it yesterday. 

 Shankar Sen, who was in the bed next to Rajbhar, said his relatives became agitated because Dr Amitava Kumar, who was on duty then, was not available when Rajbhar was sinking. Even the nurses were not there. 

 Kumar denied the charge. The hospital superintendent, K.K. Ganguly, too, said a doctor had attended to Rajbhar.

 Rajwar was assaulted while trying to pacify the mob. None of his colleagues was in sight then. 

 A dozen people were arrested today..

 A doctor in Calcutta said: Anadi Rajwar was taken out of the ventilator this morning, but he is under observation. He was injured in the neck and the head and still has pain. 

 Originally from Purulia, Rajwar stays at Bhadreswar in Hooghly with his wife and daughter, a Class VII student. 

 He was the acting superintendent of the hospital in the absence of Ganguly, who was on leave. 

 Ganguly was in Calcutta today to see his injured colleague. He said the other doctors in the hospital fled seeing the mob of about 200 people. 

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: Well soon talk to private security agencies so that their personnel can be deployed at the earliest. 

 At present, none of the ESI hospitals has a guard. Local police stations are supposed to oversee their security. 

 There are police pickets in the medical college hospitals. 

 The doctors at the Gaurhati hospital today made other patients suffer because of yesterdays incident by boycotting the outpatient department. About 150 people had to return home without any treatment.

 Kumar, the doctor accused of negligence, said they would continue the boycott at least till Friday. 

 Director of ESI hospitals A.R. Bardhan said it is an initial reaction from aggrieved doctors. Two officials visited the Hooghly hospital today to probe yesterdays incident.

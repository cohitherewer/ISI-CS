 Salem model for Davy return

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The home ministry has agreed in principle to a CBI proposal seeking to get the prime conspirator of the Purulia arms drop case, Kim Peter Davy, extradited from Denmark on terms similar to that of gangster Abu Salem.

 A senior CBI source said chances of getting Davy to India would brighten if the Centre offers similar assurance to Denmark that it had given to Portugal in Salems case. 

 Sources said the Danish authorities will be contacted once the ministry of external affairs gives its nod.

 India had assured Portugal that Salem would not be sentenced to death nor given a prison term of more than 25 years, and that he would not be tortured. 

 The CBI source said the government has even agreed to Denmarks conditions of repatriating Davy back for his period of imprisonment, if any, offering the Danish consulate unrestricted access to meet him and to be treated in accordance with provisions of the UN convention for civil and political rights.

 In the early hours of December 18, 1995, Davy, on board an AN-26 aircraft, had dropped huge quantity of arms and ammunition in villages under the jurisdiction of Jaldah police station of Purulia. 

 The arms were meant for the Anand Marg headquarters at Anandnagar near Purulia where its central committee had enacted a scandalous resolution to wage a war against the immoral forces to rule the country to get economic power. 

 Although the plane carrying Davy and other accused was forced to land at the Sahar airport in Mumbai five days later, he managed to escape.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Oil amp; CPM wont mix

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 11: Pushed to the backfoot by the Centre, the CPM state leadership has steered clear of oil prices in the first rally after the partys central committee meeting in Hyderabad.

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose and former chief minister Jyoti Basu did not mention oil prices while addressing a rally in Howrah this afternoon. 

 Bose trained his guns on the self-serving Manuwadis and Sangh Parivar groups like the VHP for their opposition to the Centres decision to reserve seats for Other Backward Classes in higher education.

 He said some hated Manuwadis had misled students into launching the anti-reservation movement.

 Bose asked the Centre to ensure that the additional reservation is introduced along with extra seats in educational institutions to meet the aspirations of upper castes as well as backward classes.

 Asked why he skirted the oil issue particularly when the CPM central leadership has publicly opposed the hike and called protests, Bose said: Since I was supposed to make our partys stand on reservation clear, I focused on that. Anyway, the Lefts countrywide agitation against the oil price hike on June 13 stands. So, we will address the issue on that day. 

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had said the Left-ruled Bengal, Kerala and Tripura would not follow in the footsteps of the Congress-led governments and forgo sales tax increments unless the Centre reviews its decision.

 But some Left Front partners in Bengal are peeved that the state did not take the cue from the government in Kerala, headed by CPM hardliner V.S. Achuthanandan, and call a bandh to protest the oil price increase. In Bengal, the protest will be confined to demonstrations.

 The state CPI leadership has sent a letter to the CPM asking for a more meaningful movement to underscore the growing divisions between the Left and the UPA government. Bose said he had received the CPI note and would discuss the matter bilaterally.

 New Delhi/Srinagar, June 30: A lieutenant colonel of the army and eight militants were killed in Kashmir after troops intensified combing and search operations in separate places in a renewed counter-insurgency offensive that follows a security review in New Delhi earlier this week.

 The offensive, mounted jointly by the army, Rashtriya Rifles and the Border Security Force, is aimed at neutralising militant outfits suspected to be involved in attacks on tourists and non-combatants after the Prime Ministers roundtable conference on May 24.

 Army sources in Delhi said eight militants were killed after 12.30 Thursday-Friday night in Keran sector west of Kupwara in north Kashmir. 

 The militants were suspected to have crossed over from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and breached the fence. 

 In Bandipore, Lt Col V.R. Chauhan of the 2/1 Gorkha Rifles was killed when he stormed a house in which militants were sheltered. Sources said Chauhan killed two militants before he died of gunshot wounds. Another militant was also believed to be killed.

 In other combing manoeuvres, the Rashtriya Rifles arrested five youths yesterday. Warlike stores, including grenades, under barrel grenade launchers and remotely controlled improvised explosive devices, were found with them.

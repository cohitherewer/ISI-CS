 Marriage law change

 Muzaffarnagar, Nov. 10 (PTI): Taking a sympathetic view of the plight of rape victim Imrana, who is being pressured to divorce, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board today highlighted the need to change the communitys marriage law to curb harassment of women. 

 Clarifying that Imrana, who was raped by her father-in-law and is now being pressured by a section of clerics to abandon her husband, was being doubly victimised, the board vice president Maulana Kalbe Sadiq said she cannot be punished for the acts of others. 

 Sadiq told newsmen here that in order to prevent litigation in family disputes and to curb harassment of women, it was necessary to amend the Muslim marriage law. 

 He supported the proposed model nikahnama a marriage contract of the Shia Muslim Personal Law Board, saying it was a step in the right direction. 

 Imranas father-in-law Ali Mohammed was recently convicted by an Uttar Pradesh court for raping her and was given a 10-year prison term. His lawyer said he intended to appeal the sentence in the high court.

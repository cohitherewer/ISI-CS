 Westminster beckons, thank Paul

 AMIT ROY

 Swraj Paul

 London, March 6: More Indian students will now be encouraged to study at the University of Westminster, now that Lord Swraj Paul has taken over as its first chancellor.

 Paul, who happens to live next door to the universitys main building in Regent Street, London, said: The chancellors role is ambassadorial, both internationally and in the country, and also to be present for degree ceremonies as a figurehead for the university.

 Recognising that is it prohibitively expensive for students from India and many other countries to come to Britain without scholarships ? America has far more bursaries to offer ? he said he hoped to improve Westminsters outreach programme.

 I am very keen that British universities should strive to improve the education of the world, he said. We have a lot to give and gain by doing this.

 In theory, this means that an institution such as Westminster could open a branch of its highly-regarded School of Media, Arts and Design in India.

 In Britain, in marked contrast to the way media studies are taught in America (at Columbia or Wisconsin, for example), journalists learn their trade on the job. But Westminster, which was upgraded to university status in 1992 ? it was previously the Polytechnic of Central London ? now has 23,000 students, including about 4,000 from 160 countries.

 Pupils who undertake media studies can choose to specialise in print, radio or television journalism.

 Paul said his brief was not exclusively to enhance links between India and the University of Westminster.

 But he realises that journalism would prove to be a big draw, especially among talented young urban men and women in India who see it as an increasingly glamorous profession.

 Westminster has a very good journalism department, one of the best in the country, emphasised Paul. I am passionate about the benefits of education and the mission at Westminster, with its strong emphasis on international partnerships, fits perfectly with my vision. Universities such as Westminster, with its commitment to diversity and multiculturalism, can be such a positive vehicle for change.

 The 75-year-old steel tycoon also gave The Telegraph details of the academic institution he is setting up in Jalandhar with an initial outlay of ?1million. We have the land and the architects, he said.

 Ideally, he would encourage those who studied at the Caparo School of Manufacturing Excellence to spend two years of a three-year degree course in India and a final year abroad.

 According to a statement today from Westminster University, Pauls non-executive role will see him represent the university and promote its interests.

 Raised to the peerage as Baron Paul of Marylebone in 1996, he already has strong links with the university, hosting the annual visit of Indian journalists to study on Chevening Scholarships at Westminster. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters in 1997, it added.

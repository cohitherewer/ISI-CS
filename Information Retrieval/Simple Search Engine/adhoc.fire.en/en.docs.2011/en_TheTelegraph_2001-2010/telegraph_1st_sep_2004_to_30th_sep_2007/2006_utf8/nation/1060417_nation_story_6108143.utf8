 Search for a rival for Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, April 16: The BJP is struggling to find a candidate for Rae Bareli.

 After much thought, the party asked Vinay Katiyar, recently elected to the Rajya Sabha, to battle Sonia Gandhi but he is believed to have refused. 

 In the 2004 general elections, Katiyar had lost his Lakhimpur Kheri seat. But it is not the fear of defeat that is holding him back. 

 Party insiders said Katiyar is not willing to jump into the fray because Uma Bharti, a leader he has always stood by, has fielded a candidate, Prabha Singh Lodh. 

 Contesting against Sonia ? who is seeking re-election after stepping down over the office-of-profit row ? will mean fighting against Umas candidate too. Both Katiyar and Uma are from the backward classes and have been very close since the Ayodhya temple movement.

 During almost all her visits to the temple town as party leader, Katiyar accompanied her. Although he stayed away from Umas recent rallies, he is believed to have remained close to her even after she revolted against the BJP leadership. 

 A firebrand Hindutva leader, Katiyar was feeling insecure in the new BJP set-up after Rajnath Singh took over as president. It was to placate him that the party offered him a Rajya Sabha ticket last month. 

 But when last week, the party high command sounded him for the Rae Bareli bypoll, he is believed to have politely refused. I have told them my reasons. Now it is up to them, he told reporters. 

 With Katiyar opting out, the BJP leaderships search for a candidate against the Congress president continues. 

 It has been learnt that senior party leaders approached TV star Smriti Irani, among others, but have not settled on anybody so far, although only four days are left for the nominations to close.

 In case heavyweights are unavailable, the party may have to go with Ajay Pal Singh, a district-level leader. Former Rai Bareli municipality chairman Manoj Pandey could be another choice.

 Party high command is on the job and a candidate would be finalised in a day or two, said Kesrinath Tripathi, BJP state president.

 Sonia is to file her nomination tomorrow. Her children Rahul and Priyanka and son-in-law Robert Vadra are expected to accompany the Congress president to Rae Bareli.

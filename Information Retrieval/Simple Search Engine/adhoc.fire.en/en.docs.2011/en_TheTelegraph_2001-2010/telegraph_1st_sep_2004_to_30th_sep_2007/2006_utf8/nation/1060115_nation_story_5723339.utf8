 Bitter civic pill for Japanese

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The drive against illegal construction by Delhis civic authorities now faces protest from an unusual quarter ? the Japanese government.

 The countrys diplomats got a taste of Indian law when the Municipal Corporation of Delhi sealed a building that was to house the Japan Culture Centre. The building, taken on rent near Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi, was listed as illegal by the civic body.

 The move came as a surprise to the Japanese officials who are running from pillar to post for help. The culture centre now operates from a building on Ferozeshah Road, but the lease on the premises ends on March 31.

 If the Lajpat Nagar property is not unsealed, the culture centre will have to move to the Japanese embassy or shut down.

 Officials said representations have been made to the MCD and the Delhi government through the ministry of external affairs but they have expressed inability to help because the building was sealed on orders from the high court.

 The Japanese are now planning to approach the lieutenant governor.

 The culture centre is run by the Japanese Foundation under the ministry of culture. It had drawn up plans to expand the centre and bring it at par with the more popular American Center or the British Council.

 Preparations were on to move into the new building and a large sum of money was earmarked for renovating it. 

 Efforts were on to get high-ranking officials from Japan to inaugurate the centre and invites were ready for some well-known Japanese folk artistes to perform as part of the promotional package. The plans have been shelved for the moment.

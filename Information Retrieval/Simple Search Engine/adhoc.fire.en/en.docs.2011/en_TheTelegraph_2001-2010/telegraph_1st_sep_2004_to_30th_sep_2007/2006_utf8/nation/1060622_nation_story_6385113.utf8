 New Delhi, June 21: Declaring a silent revolution was on its way, anti-quota leaders today claimed nearly 50,000 doctors, students, traders and professionals had registered as members within 72 hours of the movement becoming official.

 The National Coordination Committee of the Youth for Equality was registered as a trust on Monday in Bangalore, institutionalising the movement against the proposed 27 per cent education quota for OBCs. The trust was registered under the Societies Act, not the Cooperative Act as planned earlier. We found it easier to register as a trust than as a cooperative, said Vinod Patro, who led the AIIMS strike.

 Explaining that there would be no overt action on the streets, Patro said the revolution would be brought about almost unnoticed. 

 It will not be like the last time, he said, referring to the 17-day strike when medical facilities in the capital and elsewhere were severely affected. Instead, it would spread like an epidemic.

 Our ideas speak for themselves. People are joining us all the time. This whole process of appeasement politics will have to go, Rahul Suri, another leader said.

 The leaders, however, clarified they had no political aspirations for the ant-quota front.

 We have already decided that we will never stand in any elections, Patro said, adding that the Shiv Sena was the only party that had openly supported their cause.

 Their (Sena) ideas match with ours in this matter.

 A chapter of the organisation has been registered in Karnataka, and similar chapters will be registered in many states this week.

 Over 12,000 people have registered in Bangalore, which is explained by a membership drive preceding the trusts registration.

 No official figures are available for Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and other cities where the trust has yet to be registered. But leaders say around 40,000 people have unofficially signed up, of which 5,000 are from Calcutta.

 We already have close to 10,000 members registered in Delhi, said Tarun Agarwal, a member of the Youth for Equality, adding the organisation would be registered in Delhi tomorrow.

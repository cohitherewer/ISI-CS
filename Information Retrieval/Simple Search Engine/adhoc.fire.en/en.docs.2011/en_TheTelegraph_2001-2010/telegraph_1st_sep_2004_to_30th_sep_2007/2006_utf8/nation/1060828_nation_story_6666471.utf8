 Faster passport nudge 

 New Delhi, Aug. 27 (PTI): 

 The ministry of external affairs has asked state governments 

 to send police verification reports on passport applicants 

 within two weeks.

 It has also decided to do away with handmade passports issued in large numbers by Indian embassies and high commissions by March next year in view of security concerns.

 The state governments have been asked to despatch police verification reports in two weeks, an official said here today. 

 He pointed out that the delay in receipt of such reports was the main cause for pendency of passport applications.

 From next year, all applications received at missions abroad will be processed in Delhi on the basis of data fed into computers. 

 The machine-readable passports will be issued in four days and despatched by courier, for which a pact has been signed with Fedex. 

 The official noted that 6,62,464 passport applications were pending on July 31. Of these, 3,81,951 were pending for want of police verification reports.

 The ministry has also increased staff at the passport offices and enhanced output with the help of the National Informatics Centre by introducing machine printers.

 Referring to the tatkal system, the official said a decision has been taken to issue full 10-year validity passports on production of the verification certificate.

 The specified time period under the system has been reduced in the case of 11-35 days to 11-20. 

 The limit in the case of 1-10 days remains the same. 

 The specified time period for re-issuance of passports has been reduced from 1-10 days to 1-3 days.

 A central public grievance monitoring cell has been set up for quick redressal of applicants problems.

 The ministry has decentralised the system of receiving passport applications. 

 It has been decided that the number of speed post centres for collecting app- lications will be increased from 218 to 1,000 in the co- untry by the end of next month.

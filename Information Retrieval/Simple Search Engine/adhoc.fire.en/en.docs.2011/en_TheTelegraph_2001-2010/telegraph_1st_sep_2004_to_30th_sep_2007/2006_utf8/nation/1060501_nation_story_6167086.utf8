 Low-key launch for Uma party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Ujjain, April 30: Expelled BJP leader Uma Bharti launched her new political outfit, the Bharatiya Janshakti Party, here today. 

 The party launch turned out to be a low-key affair with four BJP MLAs, who had been suspended for backing her, and many state party functionaries staying away from the function. 

 At the ceremony, Uma crowned herself the president of the party while rebel BJP leader Sanghpriya Gautam was made the vice-president. Raghunandan Sharma, another former BJP leader, was named the general secretary. 

 Uma unveiled a party flag ? saffron in colour with a golden border and a picture of the sun. 

 However, considering the cold response, she cancelled three events meant to give a thrust to her new outfit. 

 The absence of former state minister Gauri Shankar Shejwar, a staunch Uma supporter, was also conspicuous at the event.

 Madanlal Khurana, who was in the temple town, also did not show up at the ceremony. Khurana said he was considering several options, including the possibility of joining a secular third front consisting of former Prime Minister V.P. Singh and Raj Babbar. 

 Earlier, Uma began her day from Mahakal temple in the presence of over 100 founder members of the new party. 

 Uma said her party would adhere by five principles ? swabhiman (self-respect), suraksha (security), swadeshi (indigenous), shuchita (propriety) and suraj (good governance).

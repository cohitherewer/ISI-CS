 New Delhi, Oct. 19 (PTI): Ram Gopal Varma had barely shouted action for his Sholay when Delhi High Court put him on notice for copyright violation. 

 Varma, who said he would place his defence in court, insisted today: In the way I am making my film, I am not infringing any copyright nor do I intend to.

 The order restraining the release of Ram Gopal Varma Ki Sholay came on a suit filed by the grandson of G.P. Sippy, who had produced Sholay in 1970. 

 Sippy Films Pvt Ltd and Sholay Media and Entertainment Pvt Ltd, owned by Sascha Sippy and Shan Uttam Singh, sought a stay on the release of Varmas film saying the use of the name Sholay by any other entity amounts to infringement of trademark and copyright. They argued that they also had a copyright on the use of Gabbar Singh, the character made famous by the late Amjad Khan that is being played by Amitabh Bachchan in Varmas film.

 Sascha said the late G.P. Sippys son Ajit who reportedly sold the copyrights to Varma had no right to do so. 

 Justice Gita Mittal has issued notices to Varma, his production house K Sera Sera, its managing director P.M. Sanghvi and Ajit Sippy.

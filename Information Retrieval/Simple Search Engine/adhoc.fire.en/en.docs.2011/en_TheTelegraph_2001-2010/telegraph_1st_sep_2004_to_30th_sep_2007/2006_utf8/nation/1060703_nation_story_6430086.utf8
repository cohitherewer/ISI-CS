 Cong in UP poll mode

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, July 2: The battle is at least six months away but the Congress believes its never too early to get ready.

 The party today geared up for the Uttar Pradesh polls with fresh blood in its ranks and the announcement that Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul will hit the campaign trail late this month.

 While the campaign would focus on the Congress-led coalitions achievements in the two years it has ruled the Centre, a documentary would depict what the state has lost in the 16 years the party has been out of power in the heartland.

 The film ? Kya Khoya Kya Paya (what was lost and what was achieved) ? would be shown in all the districts, state unit chief Salman Khursheed told reporters.

 Khursheed said the Congress chief and Rahul would take part in rallies and road shows organised across the state during the next three months and the campaign theme would be the UPA governments achievements.

 I dont know if Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi would separately join the rallies, but I have sent the list of programmes to be organised. They will join rallies depending on their convenience, he added.

 To inject momentum to the partys bid for the heartlands crown, the Congress inducted 65 young faces in the 102 revamped regional committees in the state.

 At least half a dozen of the new faces had attended the youth training camps in Chitrakoot, Gorakhpur and Muzaffarnagar and had a face-to-face interaction with Rahul.

 Rahul Gandhi sought to strike a rapport with the new youth brigade and work with them to implement his agenda, said Satyadev Tripathi, a party general secretary.

 Among the new district-level office-bearers, 34 are Brahmins and 28 Muslims, which suggests that the Congress is trying to forge a Brahmin-Muslim alliance. Thirty per cent of the new office-bearers are from the backward castes and classes.

 However, the party did not have much of a success in its search for women leaders. Only three could be given responsibilities as district president.

 Sources said the revamping of the district committees has paved the way for Rahuls gradual entry into the state unit, though Khursheed sounded evasive when asked if this meant the Amethi MP would shoulder the responsibility of the Uttar Pradesh Congress. He will be our leader wherever he goes, Khursheed said.

 Notings 

on files to go under wraps

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 20: The Centre today decided to dilute the Right to Information Act, projected as a major achievement of the Congress-led government, by dropping the clause that said file notings by bureaucrats have to be made public.

 The decision, taken at a cabinet meeting, has set the stage for a confrontation between the government and right to information activists who are planning an agitation against the move.

 The amended legislation will be placed before Parliament in the session beginning Monday.

 The government is justifying the amendment as a move to remove ambiguities and make the law more effective.

 Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said file notings would be exempt from being made public except those that pertain to social and development issues.

 Decisions taken by the Union Public Service Commission in recruiting people for central government service will also not be shared.

 Das Munshi said the decision to dilute the act was taken following objections raised by some government organisations.

 These organisations had said that while decisions taken could be conveyed, details on how they were arrived at should not be shared.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Central Information Commission had expressed fears that the clause could be misused. 

 It was felt that bureaucrats making adverse notings could be targeted or they might be unwilling to express their opinion freely.

 The decision to dilute the law came just five days after a massive campaign was launched to popularise it so that it could be used as a major tool against corruption. 

 Many activists felt that the legislation could have been strengthened even while retaining the clause.

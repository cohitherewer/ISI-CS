 Rescue berth pangs for dawdler Delhi

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, July 19: Israel has declared a 60-square-mile war zone along the coast of Lebanon but has given a window to a flotilla of the Indian Navy to berth at Beirut to evacuate Indians wanting to flee the country.

 But the flotilla of four ships is being made to wait because the ministry of external affairs woke up late to the emergency and berths in Beirut port have been taken up by US, British and west European ships.

 Before berthing in Beirut port, the Indians will have to take special fleet protection measures in the war zone where a Cambodian merchant vessel was accidentally bombed last week. The measures are required not only because Israel is targeting the port but also because of a threat perception from the militant group Hizbollahs Katyusha rockets. Evacuations from Lebanon have a tragic history.

 Women and children will have to board the Indian naval ships for an eight-hour shuttle to either Larnaca or Limassol in Cyprus. The rescue effort has been codenamed Operation Sukoon. Indian naval warships are not configured to accommodate families. The distance to Larnaca is about 120 nautical miles (210 km). A defence source here said the traffic near Beirut is so thick and in such hurry that there is little sea room.

 But Rear Admiral Anup Singh, the western fleet commander, has been asked to be prepared to berth tomorrow afternoon. There are 12,000 Indians across Lebanon and, as of this evening, the Indian embassy had informed that less than 1,500 Indian nationals were ready to leave immediately. The reason is most Indians are engaged in agriculture and cannot leave immediately because of the compulsions of work. The number is up from a few hundred yesterday and is likely to increase further.

 Delhi can pat itself on the back for having had naval assets in the region but it lost vital time when it should have acted fast like the West.

 Naval headquarters had inquired last week shortly after Israeli defence forces began pounding Lebanon if the flotilla that was making port visits to Israel, Greece and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean was required in Lebanon. But it was asked not to alter its course.

 The four ships ? the INS Mumbai, the INS Betwa, the INS Brahmaputra and the INS Shakti ? crossed the Suez Canal before the government decided in a meeting called by the cabinet secretary on Monday that they were required to turn around and set sail for Beirut.

 The four ships have seven helicopters between them ? an asset ? but not comparable to the Chinooks that the Americans and the British are using. With Beirut airports runways bombed, helicopters are the only flying machines that can land in designated places in the city. Indias Seakings and Chetaks are not made for passenger airlift unlike the Chinooks that can carry 40 persons at a time.

 The navy can also dock one of its ships at the port of Tripoli in Lebanon (not to be confused with the Libyan city) but the drought there is a limiting factor. A defence source here said the flotilla could ferry about 1000 passengers in one wave (in all four ships at the same time) to Larnaca or Limassol. Cyprus is already congested with evacuated Europeans and Americans.

 The Centre was also thinking of chartering a merchant vessel and aircraft to ferry the Indians. Though the air forces IL-76 transporters can fly sorties, they will be uncomfortable because of limited seats.

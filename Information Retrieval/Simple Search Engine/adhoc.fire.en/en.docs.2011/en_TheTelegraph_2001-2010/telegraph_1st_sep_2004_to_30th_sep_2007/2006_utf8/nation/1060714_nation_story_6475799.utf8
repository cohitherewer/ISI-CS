 Bike to train, deadly switch

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Rajarbathan, Hooghly, July 13: The day after he cremated his son Sumanta, there was no consoling Dilip Kumar De.

 Seated in his three-roomed home, he said: My son used to drive a Hero Honda in Mumbai. Last month, when I visited him, I told him it wasnt safe to go around on a bike and urged him to switch to local trains.? And look what happened.

 Saheb ? thats what he was called at home ? garaged his bike and bought a monthly first-class ticket for July.

 Eleven days into his switch to a safer mode of transport, the 24-year-old lost his life to the terror attack on BO 635 at Khar, 6.24 pm.

 The darkness that has descended over Rajarbathan, around 50 km from Calcutta, has more to do with the loss of the villages favourite son than the monsoon clouds.

 Having passed Madhyamik from the village high school and Higher Secondary from Ramakrishna Mission, Belur, with first-division marks, Sumanta, the son of a non-teaching staff member in a local school, went on to clear the civil engineering polytechnic course.

 His tryst with Mumbai was set when he visited his sister there and decided to join his brother-in-law in jewellery designing. 

 Encouraged by the favourable feedback to his initial designs, Saheb decided to move to Mumbai. Soon he began supplying jewellery designs to leading brands. He was working with Nakshatra and doing so well, sobbed elder sister Shrabonti. 

 Hero ? so his friends called him ? was finding his feet fast in the world of jewellery design in Mumbai. From just a Rs 2,000 job in 2003, Sumanta rose to the role of a designer with Nakshatra.

 His stamina to pursue his dream used to fascinate me and thats why I never questioned his decision to not pursue a career in civil engineering, said his father, holding his laminated photograph close to his chest.

 The city had held out hope of a future for Sumanta far removed from the backwardness of a Bengal village. His family, too, had great expectations from Saheb. All came undone in a few moments on the evening of July 11.

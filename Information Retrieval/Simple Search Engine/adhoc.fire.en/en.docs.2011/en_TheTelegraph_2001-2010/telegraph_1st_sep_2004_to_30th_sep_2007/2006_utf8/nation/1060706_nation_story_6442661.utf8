 Andhra quota

 New Delhi, July 5: The Supreme Court today refused to allow the Andhra Pradesh government to provide 5 per cent reservation to Muslim students during the current academic session.

 The state government had challenged an Andhra Pradesh High Court order striking down a law guaranteeing the reservation for Muslim students and job-seekers.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said allowing the plea would amount to staying the high court order.

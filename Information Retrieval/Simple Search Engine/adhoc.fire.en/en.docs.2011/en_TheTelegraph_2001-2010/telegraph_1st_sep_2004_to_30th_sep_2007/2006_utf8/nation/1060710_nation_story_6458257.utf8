 Krrish is superman for kids

Routh in Superman Returns: Whos the bigger hero? 

 Mumbai, July 9: Superman has returned, but the kids want Krrish.

 Hrithik Roshan as superhero is pulling the crowds, with House Full boards up all over the country. 

 My kids would rather watch Krrish than Superman Returns. I dont know the reason, but its a fact. Id rather watch Superman? it would be nice to see the latest version, says Mumbai businessman Surendra Bhatt, 30.

 In many parts of the country, tickets for the entire first week of Krrish and some shows in the second week were sold out in advance. 

 Superman got what insiders describe as comparable advance bookings and Warner Brothers, sources say, had planned to release 650 prints but finally settled for less than half. 

 Ashish Saxena, chief operating officer (west), PVR Cinema, said around 300 prints were released. 

 Krrish released an unprecedented 700 prints, 151 of them in the Mumbai circuit alone.

 Kids have taken to Krrish. While a sense of nostalgia means the 30-plus crowd would rather watch Superman Returns, the kids are definitely all for Krrish. Again, Hrithik has a mass fan following and thats helping the movie, Saxena added.

 Warner Bros have refused to comment on collections.

 But distributor Prakhar Joshi says: Superman Returns has done better than Harry Potter and Spiderman. So the going is not that bad. But again its not comparable to Krrish.

 Sources point out that the Rakesh Roshan film has booked the bulk of the shows ? it has 10-12 shows at multiplexes ? and Superman Returns is not getting enough screens. Market insiders say the Indian superhero, whose stunts are working the magic on children, will have to yield some space and accept a reduction in the number of shows. 

 Most distributors agree that it will be difficult for Krrish ? as it would be for any film ? to hold on to the kind of collections it has had in its opening weeks. Collections dropped considerably during the weekdays in Mumbai. 

 One of the reasons Krrish has done well is that prices have been hiked from the Fanaa days. Also, as far as PVR is concerned, they now have three new properties on which the movie is being screened, says Joshi.

 Comparisons with the $200-million SFX spectacle could cut into Krrishs collections in the coming weeks. Exam results could also impact the film. 

 But at the moment, as trade analyst Taran Adarsh says, Krrish is definitely doing better. Its huge in India.

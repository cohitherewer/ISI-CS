 Time for teachers to go back to school 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 16: New textbooks brought out by the National Council for Educational Research and Training will be launched next week, but the teachers who are to make learning fun havent been trained yet.

 Plans are being drawn up, though. We are going to begin a massive training programme for master trainers, said Ashok Ganguly, the chairperson of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The master trainers will then train other teachers. 

 The new textbooks, released earlier this month, mark a complete break with the format and content of the earlier texts. For instance, the history text traces the history of colonialism through the evolution of cricket. 

 So far, mathematics, political science, history, geography, English and Hindi textbooks for classes I, III, VI, IX and XI have been released.

 The teachers, in order to communicate and teach the new lessons, will have to be given new training. The teachers will require an orientation programme, said the CBSE chairperson.

 The focus of the new textbooks is on understanding and analysis, and on encouraging students to think rather than memorise. But it also means teachers would need to think more in order to be innovative. 

 If education is empowerment then it cannot talk only of students empowerment. It should include teachers empowerment as well, said Poonam Batra, a professor in Delhi Universitys education department, in an article.

 Experts time and again have expressed dissatisfaction with the present quality of teachers.

 On the one hand, government school teachers are indifferent to their vocation. On the other, governments are hiring more and more para teachers. 

 Academic Jean Dreze believes para teachers can never be substitutes for full-time, qualified teachers and that continued reliance on this method stunts the learning levels of students.

 A recent report authored by Pratham, a non-government organisation, and a host of other such organisations has shown that learning levels among primary school students remain disastrously low, particularly in mathematics and reading skills. 

 The country-wide rural survey conducted by over 700 NGOs found that in that 35 per cent of the children in the 7-14 age group cannot read a simple paragraph. 

 Almost 60 per cent of children cannot read a simple story. Around 17.2 per cent of children between 11 and 14 years cannot read even easy paragraphs and 31 per cent cannot read stories.

 The National Council for Teacher Education, which lays down guidelines for teacher training, has agreed to reorganise its Bachelor of Education (BEd) programme on the basis of the 2005 National Curriculum Framework. 

 The framework suggests longer duration for teachers education courses. It recommends two years instead of the present one-year course that is often crammed into six or eight months. 

 It also says teachers must not carry their religious and caste bias to classrooms. Standardised tests should be carried out for the teachers to certify their skills. 

 The NCERTs new textbooks are based on the 2005 curriculum.

 Land payment hurdle

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, July 27: Bengal land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today threatened to put the brakes on land acquisition for the Tatas small-car factory unless the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation pays the promised 50 per cent advance to his department. 

 We cannot acquire land from farmers without paying them compensation first, Mollah told colleagues at a cabinet committee meeting on industry this afternoon.

 His department has already issued notices to landowners within the proposed 1,007-acre Tata plot, asking them to communicate to the Hooghly district magistrate in 30 days their objections to the acquisition, if any.

 The corporation, which would be acquiring the land, was supposed to pay the advance to the land and land reforms department while seeking its clearance.

 Weve issued overnight approval to all the 12 plots sought by the WBIDC. Now if the advance is not paid, the process is likely to slow down, Mollah said.

 The chief minister, commerce and industries minister, finance minister and urban development minister were among those who attended todays meeting. 

 The cabinet committee okayed the Salim Groups proposal to build an expressway, a bridge and a township in addition to developing a special economic zone in Haldia. 

 The government is expected to sign an agreement with the Indonesia-based company on July 31.

 However, not everyone was happy about the hurried manner in which the proposal was cleared. A detailed discussion on the projects would have been more appropriate, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said.

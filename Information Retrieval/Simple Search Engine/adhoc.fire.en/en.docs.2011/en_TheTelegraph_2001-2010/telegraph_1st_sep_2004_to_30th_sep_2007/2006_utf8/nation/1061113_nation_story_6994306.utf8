 Robber fells aide of Lashkar founder

 Hafiz: Right hand lost

 Lahore, Nov. 12 (Reuters): A close associate of the former head of militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba was killed during a robbery attempt here, police said today.

 Abdullah Mujahid was shot dead yesterday by a gunman who had planned to rob him, they said. The assailant was hospitalised in a critical condition after being hit in the abdomen during an exchange of fire with Mujahid.

 Mujahid was a close aide of Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, who now heads the charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa. Saeed is better known as the founder of the Lashkar, and the charity is said to be a front for the militant organisation. Mumbai police say the Lashkar was involved in bomb attacks on commuter trains and stations that killed nearly 200 people on July 11.

 The Jamaat-ud-Dawa said in a statement that Mujahids killing was an act of terrorism, but the police said it was attempted robbery.

 Mujahid was returning from morning prayers when his car was stopped by a gunman, who probably wanted to rob him, said senior police office Ahsan Younus.

 But Mujahid fired at the robber, hitting him in the abdomen, while the robber also fired, hitting Mujahid in the jaw and killing him instantly, he said.

 The Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which is on the governments watchlist, has its headquarters in Lahore.

 Last month, a court released Saeed from detention after he was put under house arrest in August before he was to address a rally.

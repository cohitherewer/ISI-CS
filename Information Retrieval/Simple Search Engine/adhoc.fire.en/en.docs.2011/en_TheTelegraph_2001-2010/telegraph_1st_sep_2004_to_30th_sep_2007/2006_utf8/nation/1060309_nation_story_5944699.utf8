 Chauhan arrested

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, March 8: Khalistan ideologue Jagjit Singh Chauhan was arrested today from Tanda in Hoshiarpur for making separatist statements.

 In an interview to a private channel on Monday, Chauhan had said first Kashmir would gain independence from India and then Khalistans turn would come in 2007.

 Chauhan, who hails from Tanda, actively propagated the idea of Khalistan in the late seventies and eighties. In 1980, he left for England where he set up a Khalistan government-in-exile.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Service to nation in shoot and run

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 14: Mumbai police investigating the firing in Mahesh Bhatts office today said it bore the signs of a Ravi Pujari strike.

 We have investigated three previous cases where a similar method was used. An associate fires one or two rounds, and minutes later, Pujari telephones his target claiming responsibility, additional commissioner (western region) Bipin Behari said.

 Soon after a youth fired a shot at Bhatts office at noon and fled, a man who said he was Pujari made threat calls to the filmmakers home and office. An hour later, a call was made to television channels claiming responsibility.

 It is possible that Pujari is trying to intimidate people, and fill the vacuum left (by the Dawood and Chhota Rajan gangs), Behari said.

 A Mumbai-based small-time gangster, Pujari was one of Rajans men in the Dawood Ibrahim gang when it operated from Dubai. After the split in the Dawood gang following the 1992-93 riots and Bombay blasts, he sided with Rajans group before forming his own. 

 I am doing the polices work by killing people who are affiliated to Dawood and Chhota Shakeel. I am doing a great service to the nation by killing such people, the caller said.

 He said he assigned the job to two associates, but the probe so far has indicated the presence of only one man. We have information only about one man. We have recovered one bullet from the floor which indicates the use of a country-made weapon, Behari said.

 The police traced at least three similar incidents in 2005 to Pujari. His associates had shot at criminal lawyer Majeed Memons car. Deepa Bar, a once-popular dance bar, and a builders office in Andheri, were also attacked.

 On all three occasions, Pujari had made telephone calls minutes after the shootout to claim responsibility.

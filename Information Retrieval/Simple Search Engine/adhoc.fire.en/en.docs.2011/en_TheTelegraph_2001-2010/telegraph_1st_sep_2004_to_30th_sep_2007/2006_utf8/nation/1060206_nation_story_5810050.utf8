 Chirac to call with N-offer

 Chirac: India-bound

 New Delhi, Feb. 5: Weeks before George W. Bushs trip to Delhi, French President Jacques Chirac will be visiting India with the offer of a nuclear deal.

 French diplomats said Chiracs visit, beginning February 19, will be significant as Delhi and Paris are working out a pact on the possibility of civilian nuclear trade.

 A diplomat said Frances views on the subject were similar to that of the US, sharing the same concerns about non-proliferation and separation of military and civilian nuclear establishments.

 Once these matters are thrashed out, Paris will be ready to share its expertise in using nuclear technology in the civilian sector. Ninety per cent of our power is based on nuclear energy, a French diplomat said.

 The Indo-US nuclear deal has generated interest among the Nuclear Suppliers Group, which includes France. The success of the pact will allow the groups members to establish nuclear ties with India.

 The diplomat said the US Presidents visit in early March will be closely watched by Western diplomats because of the prominence Delhi now enjoys in Washingtons scheme of things.

 The French deal is being worked out at the official level. The two sides, however, are not sure if it will be ready for signing during Chiracs visit. The French President had sent his envoy last week to meet national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and other senior officials in the run-up to the visit.

 Chirac will come with a large delegation that will include five ministers as well as officials from Frances nuclear energy commission and Avera, which manufactures nuclear reactors.

 The diplomat underlined the importance France attaches to its relations with India by pointing out that unlike Bush and most other world leaders who visit the subcontinent, Chirac will not be touching down in Islamabad.

 Chiracs visit will be the first by a French President in eight years. Several defence agreements are also in the pipeline.

 Shout against Buta salute

 OUR BUREAU 

 Jan. 25: Governor Buta Singh shut himself in Raj Bhavan as his decision to take salute on Republic Day sparked loud protests in Patna.

 Buta, who is incommunicado since he returned to Raj Bhavan last night, had said after the Supreme Court indicted him in the Bihar Assembly dissolution case that he would not resign. 

 He added that he would preside over the Republic Day function at Gandhi Maidan tomorrow. Chief minister Nitish Kumar is scheduled to be present.

 Almost all Independent members of the Assembly announced this evening that they would skip the programme if Buta hoisted the Tricolour. The unconstitutional governor should immediately resign or he should be removed, Sonbarsa MLA Kishore Kumar said.

 Kumar was one of the petitioners who had challenged the May 23 dissolution of the Assembly last year. All of us protested in front of Raj Bhavan today demanding Buta Singhs resignation. But we were arrested and released on furnishing personal bonds, he said.

 Lawyers of Patna High Court also protested outside Raj Bhavan. 

 The Supreme Court is the guardian of the Constitution and it has severely indicted the governor for violating the Constitution?. Buta Singh should not lead Bihar in celebrating the coming of the Constitution, a senior advocate said.

 Officials said they were helpless. As citizens, we are aware of the Supreme Courts judgment. But as part of the government, we are not in a position even to register a protest, a senior bureaucrat said. 

 I am particularly pained because a contingent of the army would salute the governor. He would also commend several personnel of the defence and police forces on the occasion, he added.

 NDA leaders speculated on the reasons for the Centres reluctance to intervene. If Buta Singh starts talking, he would embarrass the UPA government, including a powerful Union minister from Bihar, a senior Janata Dal (United) politician said.

 NDA memorandum 

 The NDA called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today with a four-page memorandum urging him to secure Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs resignation and dismiss Buta before Republic Day. 

 What was the urgency to approach Your Excellency in the dead of the night in far away Moscow also remains curiously unexplained, the memorandum said. 

 The NDA had earlier said it would meet the President on Friday.

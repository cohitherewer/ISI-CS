 New Delhi, Oct. 29: The capital today stood on the verge of chaos with traders determined to go ahead with their 72-hour shutdown from tomorrow morning even as the government made last-ditch efforts to maintain order.

 The administration was on the edge with the prospect of a breakdown in law and order as the angry traders refused to be pacified with the promise by the group of ministers to move the Supreme Court in a bid to put off sealing of nearly 44,000 business establishments from November 1.

 Around 44,000 traders have given an affidavit in the court that they would abide by its order and stop misuse of residential premises. However, this does not stop their premises from getting affected by the sealing drive that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is to start from November 1. Ironically, those traders who have given no such commitment are spared till January 31, the deadline set by the court to file affidavits declaring their intent to abide by its directions.

 In a letter to the Supreme Court monitoring committee, the corporation has said the drive should be stopped in view of the deterioration of law and order. However, no decision has so far been taken.

 After the meeting of the group of ministers yesterday, Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy, while reiterating the governments assurance to the traders that it would ask the Supreme Court to put off the sealing, refused to say when such an approach would be made. However, government sources said a review petition is likely to be filed in the court tomorrow.

 We would ask the Supreme Court to give relief to all those who come under the notification issued by the central government, said Reddy. On exactly when the court would be moved, he said: The law officials will decide on this.

 Traders thronged Congress president Sonia Gandhis residence this morning with demands to stop the sealing drive from November 1 and regularise all commercial establishments that came up before December 2005.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil has asked home secretary V.K. Duggal to monitor law and order in the city in view of the strike. Rioting and violence led to three persons being killed in Seelampur in east Delhi last month during the anti-sealing agitation.

 Russia waves off Patriot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: Russian military industry sources have claimed that talks with India on a missile defence system were progressing well despite a series of briefings to Indian military officials by the Pentagon on the USs Patriot III system.

 The Russian S-300 system and the PAC III are competitors. A model of the PAC III that India showed more interest in despite first being offered the Patriot II was on display by makers Lockheed Martin at the Defexpo.

 There have been breakthroughs (in our talks) and we have demonstrated the system to Indian representatives, the leader of a high-level delegation from the Russian military-industrial complex, Vyatcheslav Dzirkaln, claimed. 

 He said the Russian system would afford India a wider coverage area. Our system is much more sophisticated and better than the American Patriot III system.

 The PAC III was used by the US-led coalition in the 2003 war on Iraq and shot down Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles targeted at Kuwait.

 There is no statement from Indian sources on the status of talks for a missile defence shield. India is in the process of implementing a slightly dated mechanism involving the use of Israeli aerostat balloons.

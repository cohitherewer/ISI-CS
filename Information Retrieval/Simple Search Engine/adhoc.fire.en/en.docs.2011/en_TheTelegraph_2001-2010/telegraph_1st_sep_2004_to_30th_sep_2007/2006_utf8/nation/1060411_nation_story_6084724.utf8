The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A day in the life of an Indian prisoner

Salman Khan has been sent to a prison in Jodhpur. 

Procedures in jails vary from state to state, but more or less the same routine 

is followed with changes in timings.

Had Salman been sent to Mumbais infamous 

Arthur Road jail ? mainly used to house undertrials but has convicted prisoners 

serving rigorous imprisonment ? this is the routine he would have had to follow. 

 6.30 am: Wake-up time. Thats when water 

starts running in the taps. 

 7 am: Gates of the cells open. Tea is served, 

sometimes with a light breakfast of poha (snack made of beaten rice).

 8 am: If no breakfast is served, its 

time for lunch. Otherwise, the meal comes a bit later. Usually, lunch consists 

of 3 chapatis, a small bowl of rice and dal.

 Till 12 noon: The gates of the cells and barracks 

stay open. Prisoners finish their ablutions, chit-chat or take a stroll.

Those serving rigorous imprisonment, get busy with 

their assigned duties: cooking, cleaning, serving, etc.

 12 noon to 3 pm: The gates of the cells stay 

closed and the inmates are under confinement.

 3 pm to 6 pm: The gates of the cells stay 

open and prisoners are in the open once again.

 3.30 pm to 4 pm: Dinner is served. Two chappatis, 

rice and a vegetable. Some eat immediately, others collect their share and have 

it later. But meals have to be finished by 6 pm.

 6 pm: Roll call. The inmates are counted.

 6.30 pm: The gates are closed for the day.

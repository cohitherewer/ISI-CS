 Cop jailed for Pak rape

 Jammu, Nov. 21: A constable has been jailed for raping a Pakistani woman in custody the first such case in Jammu and Kashmir, reports our correspondent. 

 Shehnaz has since gone back to Pakistan with her Indian-born daughter Mubina. 

 District and sessions judge, Poonch, A.K. Shan yesterday also fined Deen Mohammad of Jammu and Kashmir police Rs 30,000. 

 His conduct was a clear case of breach of trust, the court said.

 Shehnaz had crossed over to this side of the Line of Control in the Nowshera sector in 1995 after a tiff with her husband. She was booked for illegally crossing the LoC and sentenced to one years simple imprisonment. 

 During her stay in the Poonch jail, Deen Mohammad raped her. When Shehnaz became pregnant, she named the constable and a case was registered against him. 

 Shehnaz was kept in Jammu central jail for almost seven years before she was returned to Pakistan last year.

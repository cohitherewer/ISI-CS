 Oil giant in old river hunt

 Chandigarh, Aug. 13: Who do you call to dig for a river that has dried up 4,000 years ago?

 Haryana is banking on ONGC which comes with an impeccable track record: it had struck water instead of oil at 2,500 metres in Libya last year.

 The oil giant is out to explore the course of the mythological Saraswati river at Kalayat, in Kaithal district, after an artesian well with particles of gold, silver and mica was discovered in January during the excavation of a sacred pond.

 According to geologists, archaeologists and scientists, the particles are generally found in rivers and they could have come from an underground aquifer (a layer of soil that can absorb water) underneath a palaeo channel.

 Saraswati is mentioned for the first time in the Rig Veda, a text dated between 1500 and 1000 BC. In the Tenth Mandala of the Rig Veda, Saraswati is described as a river flowing between the Yamuna and the Sutlej.

 Satellite images in possession of the ONGC have confirmed that the major course of a river, believed to be the Saraswati, ran through the present-day Ghaggar river, which passes through parts of the state, including Kurukshetra, Kalayat and Kaithal. The channel enters parts of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and adjoining regions in Pakistan before discharging into the Rann of Kutch.

 Haryana public health minister Randeep Singh Surjewala said the state government was looking at a coordinated drive by various central departments and NGOs to trace the palaeo channel of the sacred river so that the states water woes come to an end.

 The river did exist and geological evidence unearthed by ONGC confirms the existence of a high-energy fluvial regime in western Rajasthan, Surjewala said.

 Impressed by a presentation on the subject by the ONGC and other experts, the minister said the states first task was to locate an underground aquifer of the Saraswati in Haryana.

 If even a slight possibility of it being present was established, the water would be harnessed, he said. The focus is to discover new sources of water by linking the past with the future, he said.

 The government will make strenuous efforts for a joint venture involving the Union ministry of petroleum and water resources, the Archaeological Survey of India, the Geological Survey of India and Isro for the successful completion of the project. 

 Through satellite photography, scientists have mapped the course of an enormous river, believed to be Saraswati, that once flowed through the north-western region of India. The images show that it was 8 km wide in places and that it had dried up 4,000 years ago.

 Wife murder bid after KANK

 Rani Mukherjee in KANK

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna may have had a happy ending for Dev and Maya, but in a Mumbai home, jealousy got the better of love. 

 Shadaf Anwar Khan, 32, stabbed and shot his wife Reshma, 27, because, unlike Preity Zinta in KANK, she refused to allow her husband to marry another woman. Shadaf has been involved with a waitress at a bar for a year. 

 The Khans, who live in a Thane chawl, married nine years ago and have two children Salma, 9, and Salim, 2. 

 Reshma recently moved out of the couples home with her children. But on Saturday, Shadaf came to her and offered to take her out for a film.

 But the date had a twist Shadaf had chosen KANK, a film about couples finding love outside marriage, hoping it would help his wife change her mind about his affair. 

 In her statement to police, Reshma, who has been admitted to Sion hospital with face and chest injuries, said she was happy when Shadaf came to her house with two of his friends and offered to take her out. But her happiness was short-lived. 

 She said her husband attacked her with a sharp weapon, shot her in the stomach and left her for dead on the Mumbai-Agra highway. She was eventually rescued by passers-by, who called the police. 

 When KANK director Karan Johar heard about the incident, he was shocked. 

 When I made the film, I never thought it would incite such strong emotions. Id rather not even think of this incident triggered by my film, he told Reuters.

 Shah Rukh protest

 Activists of Uma Bhartis party today smashed the windowpanes of a theatre in Indore screening KANK to protest against Shah Rukh Khans reported remark comparing aerated drinks with mothers milk, officials said.

 Led by former corporator Parmanand Sisodia, the Bharatiya Janshakti Party workers asked the owner of Regal cinema to stop the show. When he refused, they turned violent.

 Plainspeak on US arms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Afghanistan also figured in the discussions where the US nudged India on participation in Iraq.

 Defence secretary Shekhar Dutt told US under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns that though India was deeply involved in reconstruction in Afghanistan, the deteriorating security situation was telling on the projects.

 The Taliban have targeted Indian workers and engineers, killing two in the past year. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) project from Zaranj to Delaram in the south was slipping behind schedule.

 Dutt said the Taliban, or what remained of them, continued to get support from Pakistan. The defence secretary insisted that Washington should issue a stronger statement against Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan.

 In fact, a source quoted Dutt as saying during the December 8 talks, almost every terrorist involvement anywhere can be traced back to Pakistan.

 Burns raised the issue of Indian procurement of military equipment from the US. He said that the USS Trenton a large landing ship tank was to be inducted into the Indian Navy in the first quarter of 2007.

 Though military-to-military exchanges have increased since 2002, Indian acquisition of US military equipment is still poor compared to supplies from traditional seller Russia and far behind that of Israel and France.

 Dutt responded that the defence establishment has been refining its procurement policies. At the same time, there was scepticism about the reliability of American military supplies.

 He said defence experts in India had pointed out that the US had been an inconsistent supplier in the past. The Pentagon, therefore, needed to demonstrate a long-term commitment to military supplies, Burns was told.

 Dutt pushed the envelope by proposing how the US might do this. The source said Dutt proposed that US military equipment-producing companies should establish manufacturing bases in India.

 This would not only address concerns of the Indian military but would also enable exports from India to friendly third countries.

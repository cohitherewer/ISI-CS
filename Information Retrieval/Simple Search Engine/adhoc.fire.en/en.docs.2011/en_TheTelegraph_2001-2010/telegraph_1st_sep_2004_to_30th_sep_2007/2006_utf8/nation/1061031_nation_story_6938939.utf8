Jammu, Oct. 30: Pity Casino Royale is already shot.

 Otherwise, a train coach on truck tyres cruising along a highway would surely have found a place among the latest exploits of James Bond, who never misses a chance to try his hand at unconventional modes of surface transport.

 A train coach on rubber tyres today snaked through the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, scripting history in the Valley.

 Pulled by a hydraulic trolley, the train on truck tyres will cover almost 300 km over the next three and a half days, probably the first time that a broad-gauge coach is covering such a long distance rolling on the road. 

 The dummy coach was on trial run for the eight bogies of a new train that will chug on a 45-km track from Wishner in central Kashmir to Awantipora in south Kashmir. The train is expected to be operational from February next year. 

 For the Northern Railway, ferrying the coaches each 23 metres long to Srinagar had become a headache. 

The coaches are so big that they can neither be airlifted nor carried in trucks. So we decided to replace the iron wheels with rubber truck wheels and take them through the Jammu-Srinagar highway, said Shiv Ram, the divisional mechanical engineer, Northern Railways (Jammu Tawi).

 The iron wheels would be put back once the coaches reach Srinagar. 

 As the rail track between Wishner and Awantipora is ready the train would be a reality, possibly by February next year, Ram said.

 The 32-wheel bogies and the 10-wheel Volvo engine supplied by ABC India Limited are being described as a technological wonder.

 When Joginder Singh, from Hajipur (Bihar), of the Northern Railways sat at the wheels today, a milestone was also laid for the Valley, where people often cite the absence of railways as an attempt by Delhi to alienate them.

 Not only in India, but possibly in the entire world, we dont know of any example where a broad-gauge coach has travelled a distance of 300 km in a terrain like this, Ran said.

 The railway authorities and ABC India struck upon the idea of transporting the bogies on road three months ago. After that, it was left to Ram to oversee the uphill task. 

 Ram said Joginder was an experienced hand who has frequently travelled in the hilly terrain. 

 He played down fears that the coaches would cause traffic jams on the busy highway or get stuck in Jawahar tunnel in the Pir Pinjal mountain range.

 A huge number of vehicles travel from Srinagar to Jammu along with the Durbar, he pointed out. The Durbar (secretariat) moves every six months when the capital shifts from Srinagar to Jammu and vice versa. 

 Ram said roads have been widened at several places to give the coaches a smooth passage.

 The treacherous terrain of the 294-km National Highway 1 A and unpredictable weather claims dozens of lives in bus accidents every year.

 Sources in the Northern Railways said ABC India Limited would get Rs 15 lakh for ferrying each coach.

 The 45-km track is part of a 287-km railway project in Kashmir that the Centre had approved in 1982. However, a financial crunch held it back.

 Militancy, too, hit the railways plans. Construction work was closed for a while after militants abducted an engineer of the Indian Railway Construction and later killed him. 

 Work on the tracks took off only recently when it was declared a national project.

 The first phase between Jammu Tawi and Udhampur, a stretch of 66 km is already operational. Trains are expected to start plying on the 45-km stretch between Jammu and Katra, the base camp for Vaishno Devi pilgrims, by February next year.

 The construction of lines between Katra and Qazigund in south Kashmir, which lies in the Pir Pinjal range, would take a little longer.

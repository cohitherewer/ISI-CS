The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Friends, fans keep vigil 

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Viveik Oberoi, who called on Sanjay on Monday. Fardeen Khan and director Karan Johar also visited him.

 Mumbai, Nov. 28: Tired and bleary-eyed after a nightlong jagran to invoke the blessings of the Mother Goddess, Sanjay Dutt looked distraught as he hugged sisters Priya and Namrata this morning.

 Nearby stood brothers-in-law Kumar Gaurav and Owen Roncon, quietly lending him support ahead of the final verdict.

 Also around were a few friends producer Bunty Walia, buddy Sanjay Gupta and Maharashtra junior minister Baba Siddiqui, one-time aide of his father, Sunil Dutt.

 So was director Vidhu Vinod Chopra who was seen holding the star by his hand as he walked out of Imperial Heights the Dutts Pali Hill condominium in Bandra around 9 am.

 A few moments later, Sanjay in a check maroon and grey shirt, not his lucky blue one turned and strode towards his SUV, got in and disappeared down the tree-lined avenue named after his mother, Nargis.

 Outside the gates, a large number of fans egged him on, wishing him luck but refraining from raising slogans. One R. Sunder, who had come from Sion, 15 km away, tried in vain to give him a sacred thread that would protect him.

 I and my mother performed a puja for him at the temple of Goddess Adiparshakti in Chennai. The priest told us if he wore this thread he would be acquitted. We couldnt give him this, but I am sure our prayers will work, said Sunder, who runs a Chinese food stall in Dharavi.

 None of Sanjays friends and well-wishers would say a word as they walked to their cars to either follow him to court or go their ways. Try to understand our state of mind. We are in no position to talk, Walia said.

 But once news spread that he had been acquitted under the anti-terror act, the dam broke. Sunder was ecstatic. It doesnt matter if they punish him for possessing guns. At least they said he was not a terrorist.

 Sanjays friend and filmmaker Indra Kumar was the first to land up at Imperial Heights. I have not eaten much since yesterday, I was so tense. We are all so happy the judge absolved him of the terrorist tag. He has cleared his own and his familys name. I will now eat my lunch in peace.

 Around 5 pm, when Sanjay returned, looking relieved but without a smile on his face, fans tried to break barricades to get close to him.

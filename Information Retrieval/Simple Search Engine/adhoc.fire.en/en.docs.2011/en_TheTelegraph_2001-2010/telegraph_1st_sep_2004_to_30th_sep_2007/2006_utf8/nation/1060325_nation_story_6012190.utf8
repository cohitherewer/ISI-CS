 Nuclear group blow to Indo-US deal

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, March 25: Even as Americas nearly two-million-strong Indian community embarked on its biggest mobilisation since the 1998 nuclear tests to rally support for changes to US laws in support of the Indo-US nuclear deal, the agreement has received a significant setback from the international community.

 Two American diplomats sent by secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to Vienna to plead Delhis case for rule change at the Nuclear Suppliers Group are returning empty-handed after the NSG turned down a US proposal to put the deal on the agenda for the groups plenary meeting in May.

 All is not lost, however. Diplomats here said the Bush administration will make another bid before May to get the India deal on the NSG agenda for the plenary in Rio de Janeiro.

 The mobilisation of the Indian-American community, which began today with a briefing for core ethnic Indian leaders by Indian ambassador Ronen Sen on President George W. Bushs trip to New Delhi, comes amid signs that opposition to the agreement is building not only on Capitol Hill but also in key world capitals.

 Japans foreign minister Taro Aso told a parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and defence in Tokyo on Wednesday that he was most concerned about it (the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) losing substance because of the Indo-US nuclear deal. 

 Aso revealed that Rice had discussed the deal with him when they met on March 18. I told US secretary of state Rice during our talks that Japan, even if asked by the US to support it, cannot easily oblige as this would definitely be called a double standard.

 Yesterday, Ken Beazley, leader of Australias Opposition Labour Party, came out strongly against the deal.

 Bush spoke to Australian Prime Minister John Howard on telephone this week about the deal and Rice briefed Australian leaders about it during a visit there. 

 As a result, Howard is sending a high-level team to Delhi, which is expected to propose a nuclear safeguards agreement with India before selling uranium for civilian use.

 But Beazley was blunt in his opposition to accommodating India. No country will get its hands on Australian uranium without signing the treaty (NPT) and living by it. It is as simple as that, he said.

 Japan and Australia were two countries that blocked a consensus at this weeks NSG meeting to put the deal on the agenda for the groups next plenary.

 Other opponents at the NSG, which controls the global trade in nuclear technology and equipment, include the Netherlands, Norway, Argentina and Sweden, diplomats said.

 The two US officials who went to Vienna to lobby support for the deal were yesterday putting on a brave face against the setback.

 Assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation, Stephen Rademaker, said: The purpose of this meeting was to explain our vision of civil nuclear cooperation with India, to answer questions that other delegations had about our vision. We were not seeking a decision at this meeting.

 Richard Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, who accompanied Rademaker, said: Those who raised a lot of questions also recognised the non-proliferation benefits of bringing India closer to the system and some of the steps that India was taking.

 The mobilisation of Indian Americans will continue through the weekend when Sens deputy Raminder Singh Jassal will brief a larger group tomorrow.

 Leaders of influential ethnic Indian organisations, some of whom played a key role is swinging US support for India on Capitol Hill during the Kargil conflict, have arrived here as part of this huge mobilisation.

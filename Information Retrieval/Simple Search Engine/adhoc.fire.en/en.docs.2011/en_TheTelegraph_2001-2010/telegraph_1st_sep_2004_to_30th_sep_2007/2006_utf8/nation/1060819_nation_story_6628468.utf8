 Nuke scientist pat for PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Singh: Potshots to applause

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The nuclear scientists who had earlier expressed concern over the Indo-US nuclear deal today said Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs speech had substantially addressed their worries and they are looking forward to meeting him next week.

 Were generally happy that the Prime Minister has satisfactorily addressed concerns among scientists and others, Adinarayan Gopalakrishnan, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said.

 But scientists also caution that negotiations on the bills before US lawmakers might not be easy. By and large, were happy with the statement, but well have to be watchful and see how the US can accommodate our concerns and how well we can insist on all that was said in Parliament yesterday, A.N. Prasad, former director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, said.

 Earlier this week, the scientists had said India should not accede to any restraint on freedom of action or allow indigenous research to be hampered by external supervision. They had also said that safeguards should be applied selectively and that the existing versions of the US bills are not acceptable to India.

 In his speech, Singh had addressed each of these concerns point by point.

 Our freedom of action with regard to our strategic programmes remains unrestricted, Singh had said. The nuclear agreement will not be allowed to be used as a backdoor method of introducing NPT (Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty)-type restrictions on India. Nuclear weapons are an integral part of our national security and will remain so, pending global elimination of all nuclear weapons and universal, non-discriminatory disarmament.

 He had also said there would be no external supervision of research and development since no sensitive research facilities that handle nuclear material have been included in the separation plan. Nothing in the separation plan infringes on our sovereign right to conduct research and technology development concerning our national defence and energy self-sufficiency.

 Singh had emphasised it is clear that if the final product is in its current form, India will have grave difficulties in accepting the bills.

 While some nuclear facilities such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai and the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre and the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Calcutta have been designated as civilian, they do not handle nuclear materials. There is thus no question of safeguards being applied to them, the Prime Minister had said.

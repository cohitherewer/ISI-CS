 Faster US visas

 Washington, Jan. 18 (PTI): The US state department and the department of homeland security have announced steps to expedite the processing time of business visas, a move that may benefit Indian businessmen visiting the country.

 According to the state department, overseas American diplomats are working closely with local US chambers of commerce in over 100 countries to expedite the visa process for bonafide business travellers. It has also established a centre to lessen the waiting time for business visa appointments for visitors and all American embassies and consulates have established procedures to quicken the processing of this category of visas.

 The two departments have also announced changes in the length of time foreign students may be issued visas and arrive in the US before their academic session begins. Under the new scheme, student visas will be issued up to 120 days ahead and holders will be allowed entry 45 days before their courses begin.

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: Amid all the talk of a possible global bird flu crisis, who better to turn to than the man who led New York during the traumatic days after 9/11?

 Former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in Mumbai to deliver the 15th Sir Dorab Tata Memorial Lecture today, had a simple advice: be aware, be careful, but dont panic.

 He felt that apart from public health authorities closely monitoring any outbreak and working with pharma companies, public education was important.

 You want to give people a sense of urgency but you also dont want them to panic, Giuliani said.

 Panic is the last word one would associate with a man whom French President Jacques Chiraq dubbed Rudy the Rock for the way he helped his city cope with historys biggest terrorist attack. Giuliani modestly explained that several factors had worked in his favour.

 He had an effective team, complete authority over the police, fire, health and other civic services, and an emergency management plan. His experience as mayor for over seven years helped; so did the encounter with his own mortality.

 Personally, I went through prostate cancer. Dealing with my personal mortality and with so many disasters in New York over the years ? although they were not of the same nature ? helped, he said.

 The crisis brought out the softer side of the man whose crackdown on the mafia and white-collar crime had brought the New York crime rate down by 65 per cent.

 Different incidents show different parts of you. There are some situations in which you have to be compassionate and some where you have to be tough, felt Giuliani, whose Mumbai lecture was based on Principles of Leadership.

 Is his leadership style combative or is it based on consensus? In certain areas, like when my city was under attack, you have to be combative. At other times, you have to gather consensus.

 For instance, when he was effecting budget cuts with only six Republicans on the city council against 45 Democrats, he had to rely on the second approach.

 Kiss case

 (Reuters)

 A kissing scene in the movie Dhoom 2 starring Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan has irked a lawyer who has filed a criminal case, accusing the actors of obscenity.

 Shailendra Dwivedi, of Indore, said on Sunday the scene lowers the dignity of Indian women and sends an obscene message to youths. A local court accepted Dwivedis petition and said it would hear him on December 11.

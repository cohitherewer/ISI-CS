 IIT law school seal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 4: The countrys first dedicated school for teaching intellectual property law has taken another step towards becoming a reality.

 IIT Kharagpur director Shishir K. Dube yesterday signed a formal agreement with the main benefactor of the Vinod Gupta School of Management, the premier technological institutes business school, to set up the Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law.

 The law school will start its academic session from July.

 Vinod Gupta, an alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, has pledged $1 million for the law schools infrastructure, which includes buildings, laboratories, classrooms and libraries.

 We have signed the formal agreement for the setting up of the IPR law school and we expect to have a very positive response to it. The need for intellectual property law in India, especially today, is immense, and we expect the school to have a great impact on how the law should be studied, interpreted and finally utilised in todays context, Dube said.

 There is an immediate need for Indian lawyers well versed in intellectual property law to protect the vital intellectual property that is being generated in our country, especially with an increasing number of sectors opening up today, providing greater opportunities for research and development.

 The human resource development ministry has acceded to the demand for the school.

 The first of the two flagship programmes will include a three-year, six-semester, fully residential programme, offering an LLB degree with honours in technology and intellectual property law, which will be conducted on the IIT campus.

 The second will be a one-and-a-half-year part-time diploma programme in intellectual property law for working executives, which will be conducted at the IITs extension centres in Bhubaneswar and Calcutta. Both programmes require prospective students to have a background in engineering or medicine, or have an M Sc degree and will have 50 seats each.

 In January, the IIT had signed a technical collaboration agreement with George Washington University, which has a top-rated IPR law school, for exchange of faculty, curriculum and research material.

 Intellectual property law has assumed increased significance in recent times, especially with India gearing up to adhere to the strict WTO guidelines in many sectors.

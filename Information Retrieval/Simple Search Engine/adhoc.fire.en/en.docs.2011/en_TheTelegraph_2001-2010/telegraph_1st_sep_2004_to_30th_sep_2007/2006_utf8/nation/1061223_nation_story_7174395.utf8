 Wife-beater NRI in net

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 22: A New Zealand-based NRI who allegedly beat up his wife from Andhra for dowry and even kept her in the dark about a previous marriage was arrested with Interpol help after his arrival here.

 Kiran Kumar Gowd was picked up late on Wednesday, just after he had reached home from the airport. This followed a complaint made by his wife, Vasavi, who returned two years ago. 

 Gowds arrest is part of a larger drive launched by Hyderabad police against NRIs who marry in Andhra, only to harass or desert their wives overseas. Pacts with Interpol and US police have helped them extradite erring hubbies and to bring them to justice. 

 A request to extradite Gowd was turned down by authorities in New Zealand, where he attained citizenship five years ago. 

 Hyderabad police pounced on him following an Interpol tip-off that he was heading to the city.

 We have almost 300 red-corner notices and another 27 extradition notices by Interpol for erring hubbies in the US, Europe and Australia. We have been getting good results after our recent pact with the Interpol, said B. Someswar Rao, an inspector in a city police station. 

 Vasavi, a software engineer, went to New Zealand after her marriage to Gowd in 2002. She also found a job there, but trouble started when Kiran wanted dowry to buy a second flat. He didnt want Vasavi to quit work either.

 Vasavi later found out Gowd had married an Auckland girl, but tied the knot again in India for the sake of his parents. 

 Soon after returning in 2004, she filed a complaint with the police. 

 Now, Vasavi says Gowds arrest is not enough. I want him punished for all the harassment he heaped on me, just because I had no one to support me there. 

 Under Indian law, a statement by a wife is sufficient for action to be taken against the husband, police officials said But other parents with daughters in distress abroad feel Vasavi was lucky. 

 My daughter is estranged but still dependent on my son-in-law in Chicago .We are not able to do anything, said Pullela Govinda Rao, a retired civil engineer awaiting action on his case. 

 Since the parents dont want harsh action that might endanger the life of their daughters, we have to go slow, said Hyderabad police chief A.K. Mohanty.

 Hyderabad, Jan. 16: Amitabh Bachchan is planning to donate diamond ornaments worth around Rs 10 crore to adorn the arms of Balaji at the Tirupati temple, reports our special correspondent.

 The Tirupati Tirumala Dewasthanam temple prepared the designs, chalked out the expenses and sent them to the Bollywood star at Mumbai last week. The jewellery is expected to weigh around 7 kg.

 Amitabh Bachchan expressed his wish to donate diamond ornaments for both the arms of the the 21-foot statue of Balaji, said A.P.V.N Sarma, the executive officer of the temple.

 He said Bachchan had asked what he could do for the temple and the deity whose blessings he had sought after recovering from his recent intestinal surgery.

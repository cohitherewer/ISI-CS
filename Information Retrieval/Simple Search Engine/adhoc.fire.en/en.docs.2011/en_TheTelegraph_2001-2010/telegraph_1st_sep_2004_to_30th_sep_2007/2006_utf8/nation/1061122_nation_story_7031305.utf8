 What charms male 

 chimps? 

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: Male chimpanzees prefer sex with older females, a new study has revealed, uncovering a sharp contrast between the behaviour of chimpanzees and humans their closest primate relatives.

 Anthropologists in the US, who analysed eight years of documented sexual behaviour of chimpanzees in a national park in Uganda, have found that female chimpanzees appear to become more sexually attractive with age.

 This study demonstrates that male chimpanzees do not merely disdain young females, but actively prefer older mothers to younger mothers, Martin Muller at Boston University and his colleagues from Harvard University said in a research report that appeared in the international journal Current Biology today.

 In contrast, previous studies on male mate choice among humans across different cultures have shown that womens sexual attractiveness peaks in the late teens and early twenties, and declines after that with age, the scientists said.

 They said certain human traits that are not found in chimpanzees might explain the differences in male mate choice between humans and chimpanzees. Humans tend to establish long-term mating relationships a trait that makes younger females more valuable because of their greater reproductive potential. Menopause and a decline in female fertility may also explain the human male preference for youth.

 However, researchers have hypothesised that in species such as chimpanzees that appear to lack long-term pair bonding, males do not exhibit such strong preferences for young females.

 In their analysis of chimpanzee behaviour, the researchers found that compared to younger females, older females were more likely to be approached for mating and triggered more male-against-male fights in mating contests.

 The scientists said there are several likely explanations for why male chimpanzees find older mothers attractive. One possibility is that older females have more years of experience as mothers and would thus offer a higher chance of survival for their infants. Another explanation is that females who live to grow old have higher genetic quality than those who do not.

 Researchers believe humans diverged from a chimpanzee-like ancestor millions of years ago. The study thus suggests that human male preference for young females is a trait that emerged in humans, long after the two species had diverged, in response to long-term mating relationships, the scientists said.

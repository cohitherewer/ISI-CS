 Ahmedabad, April 17: Narendra Modi today called off his hunger strike after the Supreme Court refused to stop work on the Sardar Sarovar dam, but the Gujarat chief minister couldnt resist being sarcastic in his moment of triumph.

 If his tone was combative yesterday, it was a grateful Modi who thanked Union water resources minister Saifuddin Soz for creating a situation that led to the fast.

 If he had not made controversial statements, I would not have sat on hunger strike which enabled me to meet so many people who expressed their wholehearted support, the chief minister said.

 On Saturday, after a meeting of the Review Committee of the Narmada Control Authority, Soz had said construction on the dam would be halted till all the displaced are rehabilitated, but later said the decision had been left to the Prime Minister. He changed tack again to say that the apex court would decide.

 Modi, who was fuming at the end of the meeting, said an hour later: I will sit on a fast for 51 hours on the banks of the Sabarmati tomorrow at 2 pm.

 Today, Modi, who ended his fast nearly a day early, hailed the courts order as a victory for his state. The apex court has upheld our contention that raising of the Sardar Sarovar dam and rehabilitation can go together, he said but added that he feared a nexus between the Union government and the Narmada Bachao Andolan.

 I have come to know that the lawyers representing the NBA had argued in the apex court today quoting the government documents (on rehabilitation). The governments nexus with the NBA is a matter of concern, he said.

 About protests by the NBA, which has been campaigning for rehabilitating all those displaced once the dams height is increased, Modi said: I am very worried about these developments as they can lead to problems?. The state will have to be very alert to fight against any attempt in future to stall the work on the dam.

 While Modi thanked all those who had supported him, the state unit of the Congress, which was on the same side as Modis BJP on the dam issue, ridiculed him for trying to seek cheap publicity.

 Union textile minister Shankersinh Vaghela, once Modis political guru, said it was the chief minister who had sought the meeting of the review committee as he wanted construction on the dam to be halted so that he could resort to populist drama.

 The Congress leader also appeared to be supporting the NBAs claim on lack of rehabilitation in Madhya Pradesh for which he blamed the BJP government in that state. He said about 33,000 oustees were yet to be rehabilitated there.

 Despite the criticism, it is Modi who has hogged the limelight. The chief minister, who even a week ago was sending feelers to pro-dam NGOs saying he wanted to join their protest as a citizen, was today profusely thanking the NGOs, other parties and all those who had supported him.

 Even before the verdict, all the attention was on him. Yesterday, around 10 pm when the loudspeakers had fallen silent, Modi converted the occasion into an impromptu jansampark abhiyan.

 For about two hours, his followers queued up to meet him as he talked to his fans, shook hands and signed autographs.

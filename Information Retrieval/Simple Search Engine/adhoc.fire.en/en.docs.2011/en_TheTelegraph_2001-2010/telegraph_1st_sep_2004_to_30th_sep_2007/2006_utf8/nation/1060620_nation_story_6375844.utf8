 IIM to train future CEOs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, June 19: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, has tied up with Americas Duke Corporate Education (Duke CE) to offer a customised corporate course in India and West Asia.

 An agreement was signed by IIM-A director Bakul Dholakia and Duke CEs CEO Blair Sheppard today.

 The programme will offer training to middle- and top-level executives. Companies will have to pay $100-600 for each employee, depending on the duration of the programme and where it is being held, Sheppard said.

 Courses will be held on the IIM-A campus. Companies can also opt for classes on their premises, but the fees will be higher.

 Announcing the collaboration, Dholakia said it would expand the B-schools global presence.

 Duke CE is a part of Duke University in North Carolina. We are targeting Indian multinational companies ? companies which have global aspirations, said Shailendra Mehta, Duke CEs representative who will head the venture.

 It is estimated that in the next five years, nearly 5,000 new CEOs will be required in Indian corporate sectors. Executive education is a critical component in developing this talent. However, in India, executive education-cum-training is a much neglected field, he added.

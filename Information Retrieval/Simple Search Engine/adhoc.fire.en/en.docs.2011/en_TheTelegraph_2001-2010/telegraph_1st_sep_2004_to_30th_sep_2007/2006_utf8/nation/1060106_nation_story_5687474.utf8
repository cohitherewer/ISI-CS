 Zee goes one up on rivals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: Zee Sports today bowled a bouncer at its competitors even before the game had started by announcing it was ready to share feed with Doordarshan.

 Other sports broadcasters like ESPN-STAR and Ten Sports have gone to court, challenging the regulation that makes it mandatory for them to share cricket feed with DDs terrestrial network.

 We are ready to share with Prasar Bharati (which runs DD) if we emerge successful in the bidding process, Zee Sports business head Himanshu Modi told PTI.

 Its an obvious ploy to get in the good books of the authorities before the Board of Control for Cricket in India calls bids for long-term telecast rights.

 The other sports broadcasters have opposed the provision on the ground that such an arrangement would undercut their ability to sell to advertisers as the feed would cease to be exclusive, a right for which they would pay an enormous amount of money to the board.

 Modi did not agree that mandatory sharing would strip telecast rights of any glitter.

 Since not everyone has or can afford access to satellite television, the government has cited public interest to introduce the regulation.

 Modi said the governm- ent was only legislating something which has been in practice.

 So why the hue and cry now? he asked, citing instances of sports broadcasters sharing feed with DDs terrestrial network in the past. 

 Even the International Cricket Council (ICC) has jumped on to the pitch, protesting against the regu- lation because it fears dev- aluation of cricket telecast properties.

 But the Indian government is not listening. Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said: We are a sovereign nation. We are not dictated by what ICC says.

 The ICC has made a submission to Prime Minist- er Manmohan Singh and the ministry of information and broadcasting to review the decision. 

 Defending the guidelines, Das Munshi said India abides by rules when it ventures into the international market. 

 When we wanted to show our programmes in the UK, they wanted us to register a company there. So if they want us to follow their rules in their country, they have to do the same, he added.

 The minister may not be aware that the ICC is no longer headquartered in London, but in Dubai.

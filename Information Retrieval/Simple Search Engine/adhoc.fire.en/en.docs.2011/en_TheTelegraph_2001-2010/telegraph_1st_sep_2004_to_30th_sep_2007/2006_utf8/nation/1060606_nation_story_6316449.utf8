 Pay-up rap for insurance trap

 New Delhi, June 5 (PTI): A city consumer court has held that insurance companies that fail to detect pre-existing ailments at the time of issuing a Mediclaim policy cannot later deny rightful claims.

 The ruling came from the Delhi State Consumer Commission, which ordered the National Insurance Company to pay Rs 2 lakh to S.C. Jain, who underwent surgery but was denied her claim on the ground that she had wilfully concealed pre-existing ailments.

 For their negligence in performing their obligations, they (the firms) cannot be allowed to take undue advantage to the detriment of the interests of the consumers, the commission said. The diseases which are being used by the insurance companies for repudiation of the claim are such which can be easily detected on examining the consumer at first instance by subjecting him/her to some basic tests of blood sugar, ECG, etc.

 The ruling came on an appeal by the insurance firm against the order of a district consumer forum, which held the denial of claim wrongful and asked it to pay Rs 2.05 lakh to Jain.

 The commission said: Experience shows that insurance companies lay a trap for consumers... and, once they are in the net, they start wriggling out from their obligations.

 Sonia raps Left

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kochi, March 4: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today kicked off the Assembly election campaign in Kerala by launching an attack on the Left parties. 

 Addressing a mammoth rally in this port city at the state Congresss plenary meet, Sonia reminded party workers that although the Left supports the UPA government in Delhi, it was the Congresss main foe in Kerala, Tripura and Bengal.

 Kerala and Bengal are among the five states going to Assembly polls in April-May.

 She said her party did not believe in the politics of obstruction, gherao and sloganeering. We are against those who trivialise serious national issues.

 Though she did not mention the Left by name, the message was not lost on the party cadre. But she did not mention anything about taking back the breakaway party faction, led by K. Karunakaran.

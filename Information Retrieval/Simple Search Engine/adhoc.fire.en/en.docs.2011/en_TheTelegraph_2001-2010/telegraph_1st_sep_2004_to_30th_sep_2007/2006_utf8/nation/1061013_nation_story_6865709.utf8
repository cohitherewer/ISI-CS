The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 US shield for data

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 12: The 

 US embassy is working with Indian companies and the government 

 here to work out a model aimed at countering data-security 

 threats.

 A presentation on the model will be made to the Indian government in the next four to six months, said John Fennerty, deputy economic counsellor in the embassy.

 A lot of Indian firms have come to us expressing concern about data security and the possible threat to it. The issue has serious repercussions on information flow and business alliances. 

 As a result, we are working through the industry, agency and even ministerial levels on a model which will adopt the best practices and help deal with such issues, he added. 

 The aim of the exercise, Fennerty pointed out, is to develop a model that does not impede the normal flow of data and information between systems and countries.

 The model will combine aspects of industry organisations that act as watchdogs so that governmental interference is minimised in dealing with the threats. Companies will be taught to tackle the problems better and equip themselves at all stages of organisational structure in a proactive and reactive manner.

 Efforts will also be made to ensure that the model not only addresses the data-security concerns of IT firms, but also caters to the requirements of other industries.

 We have worked on such a model in the EU, which deals with data-security issues. Since data is the backbone of many modern industries, including services, such a model is imperative not only to IT but also to financial services, insurance and others which entail criticality of data, Fennerty said.

 Teams drawing up the plan, he said, are not averse to working with local industry bodies like Nasscom, whose experience could be tapped in implementation.

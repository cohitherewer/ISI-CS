 CBI court date for Bangaru

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: Former BJP president Bangaru Laxman has been asked to appear before a special CBI court on August 21 for the first hearing in a cash-for-favours case against him. 

 The chargesheet in the case has already been submitted. This will be Laxmans first appearance after its submission. He has filed for anticipatory bail, which will also come up for hearing on August 21.

 Special court judge I.K. Kocchar announced the date after taking cognizance of the serious allegations made in the chargesheet and their implications in this extremely significant case.

 Laxman has been charged under Section 120 b of the Indian Penal Code for conspiracy as well as under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

 A web portal had created a storm in 2001, showing footage of Laxman, then the BJP chief, accepting money from a fictitious arms supply company for pushing their deal through the defence ministry. The BJP was in power then.

 This was the first of several corruption related sting operations involving politicians the latest being the cash-for-query and the MPLAD scams.

 Along with Laxman, two of his aides N. Uma Maheshwar Raju and Sathya Murthy were under the CBI scanner.

 However, the CBI said it was unable to find sufficient evidence against Raju, and specified in the chargesheet that investigations against him were still on.

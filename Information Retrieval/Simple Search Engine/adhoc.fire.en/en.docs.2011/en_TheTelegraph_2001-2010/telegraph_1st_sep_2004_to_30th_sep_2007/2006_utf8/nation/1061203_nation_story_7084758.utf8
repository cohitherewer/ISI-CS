 Officer kin blame seniors for death

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 2: The body of Lt Col. Pankaj Jha, who shot himself in Udhampur yesterday, arrived in Bhopal amid allegations from his family that the officers superiors were to blame for his suicide.

 Jha was stationed at the Northern Command Headquarters in Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir. He is believed to have shot himself yesterday using his service revolver. 

 Wails from the Jhas residence in Bhopal could be heard from a distance. 

 His mother Lalita said the officer had recently resumed work after a long leave. During his stay here, he was telling me that he was under pressure to do a lot of wrong things by his superior officials. He had said he was incapable of acting against them due to armys thrust on discipline and his orientation, she said. 

 At the same time he was determined not to betray the nation, Lalita said. She alleged that her son had confided that he was being made to sign papers that he thought were improper. 

 The officers father-in-law, M.K. Dhar, said Jha was so strong-willed it was impossible to imagine him committing suicide. There must have been grave reasons for him to take this extreme step, he said. 

 In June, another officer from the city, 25-year-old Lt. Sushmita Chakraborty, shot herself in Udhampur. Six months have passed, but her family is still waiting to hear why she committed suicide. 

 The family insisted Jha was cheerful during his leave. The army owes us an explanation and the truth must come out, the officers brother Satish, a schoolteacher here, said. 

 This is perhaps the first time that a senior army officer, with 14 years of service, has killed himself.

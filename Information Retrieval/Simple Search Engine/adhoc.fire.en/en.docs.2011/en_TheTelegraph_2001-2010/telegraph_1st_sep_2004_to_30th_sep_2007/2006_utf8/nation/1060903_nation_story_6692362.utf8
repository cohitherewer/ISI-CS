 Aged parents find shelter in law

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 2: Andhra Pradesh has made it easier for aged parents, who are abandoned or ill-treated by their children, to claim maintenance and shelter from them.

 All they have to do is file a police complaint, and the state will fight their case under an amended criminal law.

 The amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) also allow illegitimate children to force their biological parents to pay for their upkeep.

 If the children file a police case with help from friends, relatives or NGOs, an alleged biological father can be forced to undergo a DNA test to establish paternity.

 The bill says aged or infirm parents now have the right to shelter in the residences of their earning children and the illegitimate children in the homes of either of their biological parents.

 Illegitimate children already enjoy all the rights of legitimate children and can claim them from their official parents. The new provision gives additional protection to the illegitimate children of rich and philandering persons, Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy said.

 Although Indian law already has provisions for dependants, including parents, to claim maintenance, the Andhra Pradesh bill looks to add more teeth to them by simplifying prosecution and enforcement.

 The bill also tries to help the elderly parents or minor children left behind by AIDS couples who commit suicide a growing trend in the HIV-battered state. The government will protect them from being robbed of their legitimate property by relatives, and try to get them looked after by family members.

 Other than updating the criminal law to protect these people in distress, the state government has also moved to right a wrong against bright young students.

 Prodded by the chief ministers office, the state higher education council has relaxed the lower age limit for candidates seeking admission to engineering and medical colleges by 100 days.

 Till this year, a student who cracked the entrance test had to be at least 17 years old to gain admission.

 While we hear that even eight-year-olds are appearing for medical and higher studies abroad, we are still living with age-old regulations, chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy rued.

 He said almost 20 per cent successful candidates fall short of the current age limit by 30 to 45 days, and his office was flooded with petitions seeking a relaxation of the bar.

 Its ironic when a student who bags the 250th rank in the entrance exam fails to get admitted because he is under-age by 29 days, Reddy said.

 We hope the change will benefit 15,000 to 25,000 students, who would be able to continue with their higher studies without losing an academic year, said K.C. Reddy, chairman of the state council of higher education.

 Pen pal siblings in fraud net

 - Doctor scanned paper, 

engineer helped: CBI 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, April 3: The pen-size camera used in the medical entrance exam fraud was wielded by two brothers, a doctor and an engineer, the CBI said as it presented them in court today.

 Dr Grey Bernard allegedly scanned the 80-page question paper with the docu pen at Chennais Pachaiyappas college ? an exam centre ? before throwing it out of a particular window.

 His brother Stanley Bernard, who had drafted a college employee into the scheme, was waiting outside the window, the CBI said. He collected the gadget and passed it on to a team of doctors who fed the contents into a computer and quickly SMSed the answers to examinees who had paid up for the help.

 The investigative agency said it had traced 10 doctors who had solved the questions and sent the answers, and was grilling them.

 The arrest of the Bernard brothers ? who are from Alangudi in Tamil Nadus Pudukottai district ? raises the number of those in custody to nine.

 The first to be held were the four alleged masterminds of the racket: MD students P. Satish Kumar and Vijay Kanna and senior resident doctors Ravi Kannan and N. Bhaskar.

 Later, the CBI picked up Prof. Kathamuthu ? commerce teacher with Presidency College, an exam centre ? as well as office assistants Raghuvaran Nair and Manoharan of Asan Memorial School and Pachaiyappas College.

 The special CBI court remanded the Bernard brothers to judicial custody till April 13 and extended the CBI (police) remand of the four kingpins by two days to April 5.

 The CBI had argued that the investigations were at a very crucial stage and the four needed to be grilled for some more time.

 We need to trace some public servants who were part of the conspiracy and recover the docu pen and the computer printer that the conspirators used, the CBI counsel said.

 The judge asked each of the four accused if there was any physical violence in CBI custody and, receiving denials, accepted the agencys appeal.

 The CBI has so far seized Rs 31.13 lakh that the accused had stashed away at various places in Pondicherry, Tiruchirappalli, Rasipuram and Salem.

 One seizure was made from a hostel bathroom at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Post-graduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer), Pondicherry, where Bhaskar and Kannan were senior resident doctors and Kanna studied for an MD in anaesthesiology. Jipmer has suspended all three.

 The CBI counsel said: Only half the money (involved in the racket) has been recovered so far.

 The candidates who received the SMSes allegedly coughed up anything between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 30 lakh each.

 A senior CBI officer said the four kingpins had provided several leads which were being pursued. Some investigations will have to be done in New Delhi, too.

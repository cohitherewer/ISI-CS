 Maoists killed in police raid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 28: Police commandos today surprised a group of 30 Maoists in a jungle camp and shot dead 11 rebels, including six women.

 The gun battle took place in the Rayavaram forests in Kadapa district, about 425 km south of Hyderabad, the police said.

 The anti-Maoist Greyhound commandos came under fire as they stumbled on the guerrilla training camp near Sundipalli village on the Kadapa-Chittoor border, police officer Y. Nagi Reddy said.

 After the shootout, the policemen found nine bodies in a cluster and two more in nearby bushes. Nineteen Maoists are believed to have escaped.

 The police have sounded an alert in Kadapa and Chittoor districts and set up road blocks on the state highway to Chennai and Bangalore.

 We are checking all buses, lorries and other vehicles, state police chief Swaranjit Sen said.

 The police have seized dozens of rockets, five Claymore mines, self-loading rifles, .303 rifles and a large amount of ammunition and Maoist literature.

 The rebels have been on the run in the state following the Greyhound commandos combing operations in the forests. Twice in the last two years, top Maoist leaders escaped the police dragnet and fled to neighbouring Chhattisgarh.

 Nearly 600 people ? about 300 Maoists, 50 policemen and 250 civilians ? have been killed in clashes since January 2005 when the peace talks between the rebels and the states Congress government collapsed.

 The ban on the CPI (Maoist) was reimposed after the guerrillas mowed down Congress lawmaker C. Narsi Reddy and 10 villagers on August 15 last year.

 P. Varavara Rao and G. Kalyan Rao, the Maoists spokesmen during the three-month peace initiative, were recently released from jail after eight months in detention.

 Over 6,500 people have been killed in the state since the Maoist insurgency began in the eastern tribal belt of Srikakulam in the early 1960s.

 A few years ago, the rebels had launched a landmine attack on the then chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, after a failed peace initiative by his Telugu Desam regime.

 Orissa arrests

 Two suspected Naxalites have been arrested from the jungles of Malkanagiri district, nearly 200 km from Berhampur, in Orissa, police said.

 The two teenagers, identifed as Gora Suna alias Rosa and Telena Kandabalu, were working as informers in the Liberation Guerrilla Squad active along the Orissa-Andhra border.

 During a special combing operation that continued from April 22 to 24, Orissas special operation group managed to catch the two with the help from Andhra Pradesh police.

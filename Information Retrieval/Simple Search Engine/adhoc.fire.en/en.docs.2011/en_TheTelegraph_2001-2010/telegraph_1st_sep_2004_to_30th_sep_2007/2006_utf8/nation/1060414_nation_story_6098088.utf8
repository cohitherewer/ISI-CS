 Calcutta, April 13: The stopwatch has been stopped. The ticking of the timepiece is passe. The race is no longer against the clock, but against your heart.

 As celebrities line up to play Heart Beat ? Dil Thhaam Ke Khelo, STAR Ones new quiz show starting from May, they must keep an eye on their heartbeats and not on the time. In this desi version of the popular international format owned by Endemol, a participant has to answer multiple-choice questions before his heartbeat count crosses 500.

 The heart is the most active muscle in the human body but you cant just ask it to calm down, smiles show producer Siddhartha Basu, who has set up the Heart Beat sets on the same Filmcity floor where he used to shoot episodes of Kaun Banega Crorepati. And the more excited you get over your increasing rate of heartbeat, involuntarily you are running out of time.

 After an initial medical check-up (to know the usual heartbeat rate), a heart sensor is strapped on to the contestant, the results of which are transmitted to the computer. Then he enters the Heart Beat chamber and interacts with a touch screen computer and a mystery voice. 

 The more questions he answers in the least time, he gets to store his heartbeats which he can later encash for lakhs of rupees. In fact, if played perfectly, there is no limit to how much one can win on the show. 

 It is also the first ever game show in the country without a physical host, Basu reveals. The participant is all by himself as he tries to answer one question after the other, keeping his heartbeat bank as full as possible. The voice does not try to misguide or excite him but ensures that the player explores all his options.

 For help with the questions, a participant can call up anybody, thanks to an electronic telephone guide. He can even have his friend looking up the answers on the Net or have a research conference with the three telephone handsets offered to him. Its about the fun of finding out and then verifying what you found out, says Basu whose Synergy Communications research team comes up with the tricky questions for the show. 

 The first season of the STAR One show will only feature celebrities in the new hot seat, or rather the hot chamber. Says Shailaja Kejriwal, senior creative director, STAR India: Since the format is a touch complicated, we want the viewers to first watch their favourite celebrities try out the game before they want to take a shot in the next season. So, Heart Beat is also about personalities and how their emotions get exposed as they get hyper searching for the answer.

 It was like killing your own demons, says Varun Bhadola, of Astitva fame, one of the celebrities who turned up for the quiz.

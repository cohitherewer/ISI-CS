 Washroom snaps row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Panchkula, Oct. 10: Punjabi pop singer Gursewak Mann was arrested, remanded in judicial custody for 14 days and freed on bail all within a day.

 Gursewak was being escorted to Ambala jail when additional chief judicial magistrate A.D. Gaur reversed his order and granted bail on a personal surety of Rs 20,000. The next hearing will be held on November 20.

 Gursewaks lawyer Manoj Kumar said hours after the remand order was passed that offences under Section 364 of the CrPC under which Mann was booked for outraging the modesty of a woman were bailable in Haryana. 

 While Andhra Pradesh and Orissa had made amendments making the particular section non-bailable, Haryana had not done so, Kumar said. 

 Gursewak has been accused along with an NRI friend of clicking pictures of a girl while she was freshening up in the washroom of a local hotel. He was initially charged with forcibly holding her by the arm.

 I am innocent. I have evidence and I will produce it, Gursewak said. He said it was a case of a misunderstanding on the part of the girl. It was my friend who clicked my pictures near the bathroom when I was coming out. She happened to come out at the same time and began shouting that we took her pictures inside the washroom. 

 Once I realised that my photograph was being taken, I feared that they could be misused. I asked them to show me all the pictures... and delete them but they refused. Instead, the hotel guards asked me and my friend, who had accompanied me to a party there, to leave, said Neha Thakur, who levelled the charges.

 But trouble seems to have begun for Neha, who attends IAS coaching in Chandigarh. Today, her landlord asked Neha to vacate the house.

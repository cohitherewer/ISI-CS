 Relook at Jessica case omissions

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jessica

 New Delhi, March 8: The Delhi police special team going into the investigations in the Jessica Lal murder will focus on the omissions in the probe.

 The police on Monday announced an inquiry into charges of evidence tampering. An FIR was registered stating that several discrepancies were found in the investigation of the case that need to be investigated. 

 The probe is being viewed as the first step towards reopening the case.

 Police failures that could come under the scanner are: 

 Prime accused Manu Sharma, 

 the son of a Haryana minister, was not named in the FIR 

 even though all eyewitnesses had said his identity was revealed 

 soon after the incident

 Manus mobile phone 

 (9811096893) was never seized nor its SIM card recovered

 No witness was produced 

 to prove that Manu had arrived at Qutub Colonnade, the Delhi 

 restaurant-cum-bar where Jessica was shot dead in 1999, 

 in his black Tata Safari 

 Contradiction in police 

 statements on the recovery of the Tata Safari. While sub-inspector 

 Sunil Kumar said the car was found at Karnal, inspector 

 Surender Sharma claimed it was recovered from Sector 24, 

 Noida

 Sharma said a broken piece 

 of glass from a Tata Safari was recovered from the getaway 

 vehicle, but this was not mentioned in the seizure memo

 Failure to lift fingerprints 

 from the Tata Safari

 Non-recovery of the weapon 

 of offence 

 Delay in serving arrest 

 warrant to Manu

 Too many changes in the 

 statements of Delhi home guard Shravan Kumar, brought by 

 the police as witness. Letting off the accused, the judgment 

 said the home guard and another police witness, Deepak Bhojwani, 

 did not see the crime but were produced to implicate Manu

 Alleged switching of empty 

 cartridges found at the scene.

 The police have come across several 

 crucial aspects that were not explored properly and will 

 include these findings in their appeal to Delhi High Court 

 against the acquittal of all the nine accused:

 Post-mortem: The post-mortem report on Jessicas injuries was not properly discussed. Dr R.K. Sharma, who conducted the post-mortem, only stated in court that her death was caused by a bullet injury in the head.

 Some senior police officers believe the report could have been further explored. 

 Apart from the injury, the size of the wound, its probable angle and other aspects could have been put forth in a bid to connect the empties (empty cartridges) recovered from the spot to the injury. 

 A technical examination could also have helped in establishing whether the bullet that hit Jessica was of .22 bore (the one owned by the prime accused in the case) or any other bore, an officer said.

 Site plan: The second important piece of evidence that appears not to have been brought in is the site plan of the scene of murder. 

 The site plan is prepared immediately after a crime occurs. The investigating officer draws a sketch of the scene pointing out the spot where the body of the victim was lying, its direction, the manner in which it was lying, the weapon found, if any, and the location of other evidence collected from the site. 

 While the site plan helps the investigating officer remember important points about the case, it also helps him explain easily to the court how the crime unfolded. 

 In Jessicas case, the post-mortem report and the site plan could have helped the police counter the two-weapon theory that saved Manu. 

 The police had said Manu fired two shots, of which one hit Jessica. But the two empties at the spot were found to belong to different weapons ? suspected to be the result of a switch ? giving rise to the two-weapon theory.

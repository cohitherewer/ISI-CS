 Reddy sets AIDS test example

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Dec: 18: Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy got themselves tested for HIV at a health camp set up in the Assembly today. 

 They were trying to set an example for people in Andhra Pradesh, which has 1.5 million of Indias 5.7 million HIV patients, or about 20 per cent of the total. At the camp, organised by the Andhra Pradesh Society for Control of AIDS, the chief minister encouraged legislators to have the tests done. He sent out appeals to all men and women to opt for the HIV scan before tying the knot, saying it was part of their social responsibility. MLAs, police and IAS officials have been advised to act as role models in the initiative. 

 An estimated 2 per cent of Andhras population is suspected to be living with the virus. A recent study showed that districts and towns on trunk routes and rail junctions had a higher incidence of the disease, about 3 to 4 per cent. Guntur, Ongole and Mahboobnagar were among them.

 The state government is offering inducements to popularise the use of condoms, which are now available not only in pan shops and liquor outlets, but also in grocery stores. Vegetable vendors and even milk sellers have also been roped in. 

 NGO-run residential schools have been set up for orphans who got the virus from their parents.

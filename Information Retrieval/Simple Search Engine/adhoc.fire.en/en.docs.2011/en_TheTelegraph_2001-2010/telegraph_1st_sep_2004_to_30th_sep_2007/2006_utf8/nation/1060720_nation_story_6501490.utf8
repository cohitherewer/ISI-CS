 New Delhi, July 19: India has launched hectic diplomatic efforts to secure berths for four naval ships that entered Beirut today to evacuate its citizens trapped in the war zone as Israel intensified its offensive against Hizbollah. 

 It will also assist Sri Lankans and Nepalese in shifting out of Lebanon if space permits. 

 Senior officials in the external affairs ministry said there is a long queue of ships at the jetty as several countries have sent their vessels to bring their citizens to safety.

 India hoped one of its ships would be able to get a berth by tomorrow and three others in subsequent days.

 There are around 12,000 Indians living in southern Lebanon where Israeli strikes have intensified. The officials said the congestion of ships at the jetty has become a cause of concern as there is a surge of foreigners fleeing the war-torn region.

 Around 1,000 Indians have assembled at the jetty waiting to be rescued, according to the officials. The naval ships will take them to camps in Larnaca in Cyprus. They include 26 family members of Indian embassy staff in Beirut.

 The rescue efforts are going to be a long-drawn affair. The officials said the four Indian ships ? INS Mumbai, INS Betwa, INS Brahmaputra and tanker INS Shakti ? have the capacity to carry only 100 persons. 

 Adding to the problem are requests by Sri Lanka and Nepal to rescue their citizens in Beirut. India has not turned them down but said it would depend on the availability of space. 

 It is an evolving situation. Hostilities are taking place and naturally it is a dangerous place, said foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna.

 Iran minister

 Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki, who was scheduled to arrive in Delhi last night for talks on energy and political issues, has postponed his trip in the wake of the Lebanon crisis.

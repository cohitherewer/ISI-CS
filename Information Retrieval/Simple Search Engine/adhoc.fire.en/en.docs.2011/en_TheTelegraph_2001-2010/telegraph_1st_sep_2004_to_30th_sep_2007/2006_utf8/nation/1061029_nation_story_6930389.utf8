 Cops ask for UK sting details

 Hyderabad (PTI): Police have requested UK-based Channel4 Television Network to provide details about persons caught in a sting operation which purportedly showed them offering to sell data from a city-based BPO.

 The CID had on Friday sent an e-mail to the London-based channel, requesting it to provide details and help it catch the culprits.

 Andhra Pradesh police had registered a case based on a complaint by the regional director of Nasscom, Hyderabad, S.V. Ramachandran, on October 10.

 The CID has also released the photographs of four suspected offenders, culled from the footage telecast by the British channel in January this year.

 The sting operation, titled Dispatches, focused on the alleged data theft in Indian BPO centres and covered Calcutta, Delhi and Hyderabad.

 HC writ after dead winner

 Madurai (PTI): The Madurai 

 bench of Madras High Court has admitted a writ petition 

 seeking to declare the runner up in the civic 

 polls to the Meerankulam panchayat in Tuticorin district 

 as the winner, since the election was won by 

 a dead candidate.

 The petitioner, Sakthikani, said there were four contestants, including herself, Helen Jesila, A. Karpagam and M. Jayantha, for the October 13 polls.

 Helen died ahead of the polls on October 1 in a road accident. But the elections were held without the returning officer deleting her name. 

 Helen won the polls with 664 votes, while Sakthikani got 496 votes. 

 Ticket fraud

 Sonepat (PTI): Two railway 

 booking clerks were arrested on Saturday for cheating and 

 tampering with railway tickets.

 Pankaj Luthra and Suresh Kumar were held after the chief booking clerk of Sonepat railway station filed a complaint. They have been remanded in 14 days judicial custody.

 Cong leader shot

 Varanasi (PTI): A local Congress 

 leader was shot dead by a duo on Friday, police said. Ram 

 Lal Tripathi was killed while returning home from his ashram 

 in the Raj ghat area. Gang rivalry is suspected to be the 

 reason behind the murder, the police said.

 Vote at 106

 Ghaziabad (PTI): Gayatri Devi, 

 106, cast her vote for the local body elections on Saturday. 

 Gayatri, who family members say has not missed a single 

 election since Independence, was accompanied by her eight 

 sons and 17 grandsons to the polling booth.

 The Uttar Pradesh government will not levy any 

 tax on the vehicles that bring in pilgrims for the Kartik 

 Poornima Mela, the Meerut divisional commissioner has said.

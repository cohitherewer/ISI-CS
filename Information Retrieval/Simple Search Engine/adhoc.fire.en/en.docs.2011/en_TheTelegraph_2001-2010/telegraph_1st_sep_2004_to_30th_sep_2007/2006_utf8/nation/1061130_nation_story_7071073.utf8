 Missing from 1500 table: Tory chief

 - Dinner disaster

 Cameron

 Wealthy Indian and Pakistani businessmen who paid 1,500 for a table of 10 at a Bollywood nights dinner at which David Cameron was going to star say they feel snubbed because the Tory leader failed to turn up.

 The long pre-arranged evening, held at the Bombay Brasserie, an upmarket Indian restaurant in London frequently used by the likes of Tom Cruise and Woody Allen, appears to have been something of a public relations disaster for the Tories since this was the inaugural meeting of their Ethnic Diversity Council established to foster links with black and Asian voters.

 The Conservative Central Office says that the cancellation was not Camerons fault because he had to drop everything and take up a slot to go to Iraq at short notice last Monday.

 He had said he wanted to go to Iraq but the timing was not in his control, explained a Tory spokesman.

 In exchange, some 250 guests were offered a number of Tory luminaries, including Oliver Letwin, Kenneth Clarke, John Redwood, Dominic Grieve and other MPs but the group trooped out at 9.30 pm for a Commons vote.

 Letwin said: This is an opportunity for the Conservative Party to review its commitment to diversity. It is also an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to reach out further, and actively seek participation in our party from all people from all communities in Britain. The Ethnic Diversity Council has played a major role in this effort to date and will be playing a major role in future.

 But the dinner had been sold with Cameron as the main attraction.

 To say I am disappointed is an understatement, said one of the furious organisers.

 A businessman said the Hamlet without the prince evening was not helpful to the Tory cause.

 Tickets were 150 each but some bought more than one table of 10 for 1,500, which is a lot of money, he commented. Half the money was for the dinner, the other half for fighting in marginal seats. Some businessmen had also pledged money to the Tories but cancelled their promised donations when Cameron failed to turn up.

 Guests who came expecting to be entertained by a big-name actor from Bollywood of the standing of Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan were dismayed to find a bunch of enthusiastic youngsters from the Shri Academy of Dance in Harrow, north London.

 But one comforting feature was that henceforth, the Conservative Party may come to be celebrated as the party of the dinner party. 

 According to one guest, the food was utterly delicious, as indeed it was, with the menu stretching to: Lamb Galouti Kebab, Chicken Malai Tikka, Roti Pe Boti, Achari Sev Bhatata Puri, Tulsi Paneer Tikka Tartlets, Shrimps Bezule, Vegetable Samosa, Dum Ka Gosht, Dalcha Murgh, Malabari Fish Curry, Paneer Methi Malai Kofta, Baingan Bhartha, Dahi Pakodi Kadhi, Chicken Dum Biryani, Nawabi Tarkari Biryani, Gucchi Tamatar Pulao, Dal Makhani, Naan, Zaafrani Paratha, Amritsari Aloo Cheese Kulcha, Mint Paratha and Mango Kulfi with fresh fruit. Unfortunately, the spiciest item David Cameron was missing.

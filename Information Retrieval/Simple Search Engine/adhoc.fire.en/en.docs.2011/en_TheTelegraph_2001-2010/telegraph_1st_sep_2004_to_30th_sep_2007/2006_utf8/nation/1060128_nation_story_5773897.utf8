 Surprise gifts from Saudi king

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: King Abdullah today wrapped up his three-day visit with offers that surpassed all Indian expectations: Riyadh agreed to put up a joint fight against terrorism and ensure reliable, increased supply of crude oil.

 In a significant gesture, the king signed the joint declaration, which was hailed as a landmark in relations between India and Saudi Arabia. 

 Delhi and Riyadh have agreed to forge a strategic energy partnership that will ensure supply of oil to India through evergreen long-term contracts. 

 The partnership will see Saudi investments in oil refining, marketing and storage in India and setting up of joint ventures for gas-based fertiliser plants in Saudi Arabia.

 The joint declaration said the agreement on combating crime would help the two sides fight terrorism, extremism and criminal elements. The memorandum of understanding on crime will cover money laundering, drugs and arms smuggling.

 The joint declaration also talked about expanding and diversifying mutual trade and investments in all sectors, including infrastructure.

 The declaration called for cooperation in information technology, bio-technology and non-conventional energy technologies. India will help set up a centre of excellence and higher learning in Saudi Arabia. 

 The two countries will explore expansion of ties in the health sector as well. 

 Both countries have agreed to look for peaceful means for resolving international conflicts.

 India, too, said goodbye with a special gesture. Departing from protocol, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saw off the Saudi king at the airport this evening. Three days ago, Singh had received Abdullah.

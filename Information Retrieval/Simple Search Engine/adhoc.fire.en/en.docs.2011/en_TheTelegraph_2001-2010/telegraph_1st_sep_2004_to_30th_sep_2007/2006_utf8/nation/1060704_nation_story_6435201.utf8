 Nepal Maoists wife in freedom cry

 BISWAJIT ROY 

 Calcutta, July 3: The wife of a Maoist ideologue of Nepal, Mohan Vaidya, is in the city to seek the release of her husband and some other leaders who are lodged in Bengal jails.

 Sushma, here with her two daughters for the past fortnight, has been seeking appointments with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and former chief minister Jyoti Basu to plead her case, but in vain. 

 Sixty-year-old Vaidya, charged with sedition and conspiracy against the state in India, was arrested from a Siliguri nursing home on March 28, 2004. He has been in Siliguri jail since.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy confirmed that the government had received a request for the release of some Nepali prisoners from their families. 

 Although the government is preparing a status report on their cases, we have not received any instruction from the Centre on their release, he added.

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, who has played an important role in bringing the Nepal Maoists into the political mainstream, told The Telegraph that it was not up to the Bengal government to release the leaders. The decision has to come from the Centre first. 

 The matter has to be sorted out between Delhi and Kathmandu, Yechury said. 

 The Nepalese Maoists and other pro-democracy activists were arrested by Indian authorities at the request of the earlier regime in Kathmandu. Now the formal request to release them should come from the present multi-party government of Nepal.

 Sources said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also echoed this view during a meeting with the Nepal consul-general, G.P. Kusum, today. 

 All Kusum would say after the meeting was that the release of Maoists from Indian jails was entirely Indias prerogative. 

 We have not received any instruction from our government to pursue the release of Nepali Maoists from jails in India, he added. 

 One reason why the CPM has not taken the lead in getting Kathmandu or Delhi to take up this issue is the Nepalese connection of the Maoists here who are challenging the CPM in Bengal.

 Sushma will tomorrow address a convention in the city seeking the release of the Nepal Maoists jailed here. 

 Her husband fell ill on Saturday and had to be hospitalised with chest pain.

 Why Apollo, why not AIIMS?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 2: The decision by driver Ganesh to take the two men to Apollo Hospital is puzzling by itself because the All India Institute of Medical Sciences is much closer to the Mahajan residence on 7 Safdarjung Road. 

 From Safdarjung Road, AIIMS is about 2 km away while Apollo Hospital is at least 8 km away. What or who prompted the driver to go to a hospital four times the distance is unclear. 

 AIIMS also houses a national poison information centre in its department of pharmacology where experts on poisons and antidotes are expected to be available 24 hours a day. 

 The crucial question is whether Bibek Moitra who was declared dead on arrival at Apollo might have been saved had the driver rushed them to AIIMS.

 The three men who surrendered have claimed that they took Bibek and Rahul to hospital, in which case they might have avoided AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital, which is also close by, because they have police posting.

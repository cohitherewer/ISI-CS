 Scalpel is passe, Agra doctors grab guns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Give me your arms 

 Lucknow, July 30: Get that image of the smiling medical practitioner, armed with just a stethoscope, out of your mind. Agras doctors will now be carrying guns to their chambers.

 The sudden rush among the citys medics to learn shooting skills has nothing to do with Abhinav Bindras recent showing at the world championships, though the national teams coach is among those likely to train them. The move is inspired by the doctors need to protect themselves from kidnappers and extortionists.

 In the past two years, at least 10 doctors from the city have either been abducted or received threats, police sources say. Since November last year, private practitioners have stopped answering calls after sundown for fear of kidnappers.

 The doctors have now decided they would resume working at night, but would learn how to shoot and carry licensed guns. They think its too risky to trust private security guards.

 The Indian Medical Associations Agra branch has drawn up a programme for arms training from next month. The association complains it had no choice left with the local administration persistently ignoring its appeals to arrange for doctors protection.

 We have decided to look after our own safety. But the IMA is now looking for the district administrations cooperation, said Dr Rajiv Agarwal, a member of the association.

 Over 60 doctors have applied for gun licence and district officials are being pressured to quickly clear the applications, city IMA head Dr Sharad Gupta said.

 Municipal commissioner Shyam Singh Yadav, who happens to be a coach with the Indian shooting team, has invited the doctors to train at the firing range near Dayalbagh.

 Among noted city doctors who were kidnapped is dermatologist Dr G.G. Dheer, who was whisked away from his clinic by gunmen but was released hours later after the police swung into action. Dr Rahul Sahai and Dr Munishwar Gupta are among other doctors taken hostage.

 An unsympathetic police claim that the reason the citys doctors fall prey to extortionists and gangsters is the extortionate fees they themselves charge. Even an ordinary GP asks for anything between Rs 300 and Rs 500 for a routine check-up. Some private practitioners are known to examine over 100 patients a day.

 A senior police officer said the guns wouldnt help the doctors unless they stop their cut-throat rivalry. He alleged some doctors have hired agents to attract patients.

 Some of the kidnappings, according to the officer, have been a fallout of the competition, with doctors hiring goons to get their rivals abducted.

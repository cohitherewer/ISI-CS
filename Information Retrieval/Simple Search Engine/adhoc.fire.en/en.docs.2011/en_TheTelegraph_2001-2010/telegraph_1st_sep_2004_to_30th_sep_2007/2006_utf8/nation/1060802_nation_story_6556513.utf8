 Sonia trade bill nudge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Sonia Gandhi has urged the Centre to restore the law to regulate forward trading in wheat and other essential commodities by bringing in the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Amendment Bill 2006 in the ongoing session of Parliament.

 The bill is with the parliamentary standing committee on food and agriculture. 

 Some lawmakers who represent powerful lobbies of the Hindi heartland have opposed the bill on the plea that forward trading benefited the farmers to a large extent. The original bill had been enacted in 1952 to prohibit the future contracts of essential commodities but was lifted by the trader-friendly NDA government. 

 However, the Congress chiefs message, at a meeting of the Congress parliamentary party today, indicated that the governments floor-managers in Parliament would instantly have to press their persuasive skills with the members of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party to clear the amendments. 

 Forward trading is a form of a future contract between a buyer and a seller. Both are obligated to pick up and deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a pre-determined price on a specified future date. 

 It enables traders to make speculative profits from future hikes in the prices of the commodities they deal with. 

 Sonia also asked the government to empower the states to take tough and pre-emptive action against hoarders by restoring the powers they had under the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980, and ensuring it was scrupulously enforced.

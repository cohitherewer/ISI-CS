 Peace talks freeze on icy mountain rose

 New Delhi, May 23: Efforts of India and Pakistan at peacemaking on the icy heights of Siachen have moved like glacial snow in slow motion. New Delhi is insisting that Islamabad acknowledge current positions of the two militaries before it can consider suggestions to pull back troops.

 All suggestions for modalities of disengagement thrown up through backchannel talks have run aground.

 If Prime Minister Manmohan Singh does indeed go to Pakistan as has been suggested, he is unlikely to carry a gift wrap smelling of the mountain rose ? that is what Siachen means ? for General Musharraf.

 Indian and Pakistani delegations, led by their defence secretaries for the tenth round of talks, will meet again tomorrow but little hope of a breakthrough is held out. They presented contrasting moods after the first day of talks. The Pakistani mood was upbeat and the Indian side was stoic. However, the two sides are likely to issue a statement and commit themselves to continuing with the ceasefire that began in November 2003.

 Yes, it went as planned. Very good, was the immediate response of the Pakistani defence secretary, Tariq Waseem Ghazi, after a courtesy call on defence minister Pranab Mukherjee with his delegation.

 Authentication of positions is the bottomline. My understanding is that we have not made any progress on authentication in the talks today. There has been no agreement in the past as Pakistan has always refused authentication. The talks from the Pakistani side that we are closer to an agreement is not true, an Indian government source said.

 A source said the peace talks could go ahead only after a mutual acknowledgement of the positions of the armies along the Saltoro range. That done, there has to be an agreement on comprehensive measures of surveillance and monitoring needs to be put in place in the areas from where the withdrawal of troops take place. 

 The third point put across by India is the process of disengagement itself. There is asymmetry in terms of positions held by Indian and Pakistani troops. It is far easier for Pakistan to access the glacier from its side. This asymmetry should be recorded in the disengagement plan, the source said.

 New Delhi, July 13: Union home minister Shivraj Patil was reportedly snubbed today by his cabinet colleagues, particularly Lalu Prasad, for not appearing to be tough in the aftermath of the serial blasts in Mumbai and Kashmir.

 The cabinet met this afternoon to discuss the twin tragedies and Patil briefed his colleagues. A resolution condemning the attacks was passed.

 Patil, who made a presentation on the blasts, was reportedly told by Lalu Prasad that the government should not only act tough but it should appear to be so as well.

 Lalu Prasad reportedly said the governments image has taken a beating since the attacks. Others who spoke at the meeting were finance minister P. Chidambaram and information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

 In his presentation, Patil reportedly mentioned Pakistan, blaming it for restarting the proxy war. The cabinet resolution, however, does not refer to Pakistan. 

 In the resolution, the Cabinet, expressed its profound sense of shock and outrage at the series of blasts in Mumbai and Srinagar.

 Condemning the blasts as a senseless, inhuman and dastardly attack on innocent people, the resolution iterated the governments commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms. Nothing will deter us from our firm policy to fight this menace till it is wiped out. We are determined to apprehend and bring to justice all those responsible for the evil acts.

 The cabinet conveys its deepest sympathies to those who have lost their loved ones. An immediate priority is to ensure that the families in distress get all possible relief and the injured are provided the best medical attention, it added.

 Cong blood kit push 

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: With the chief minister giving a clean chit to health department officials in the blood-test kit scandal, the state Congress has decided to meet the governor, reports our special correspondent.

 The party leaders will urge Gopal Krishna Gandhi to direct the Left Front government to punish those involved in the racket. The governor is out of town and will return on Saturday. The Congress team is expected to meet him early next week.

 The party today alleged that Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjee was trying to save the health minister 

 and state health department officials.

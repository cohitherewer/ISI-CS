 Lockout lifted at Toyota factory

 Bangalore (PTI): Toyota-Kirloskar Motor Limited on Saturday resumed production at its plant in Bidadi district after 13 days, with over 200 workers reporting for work.

 The management had imposed a lockout on January 8 after a snap strike by workers two days earlier, demanding reinstatement of three colleagues.

 During the strike, the management had received several requests from a majority of the workmen and their families, who wanted to return to the plant and did not want to be part of the illegal and unjustified strike, a company statement said. 

 Considering the interest of its workmen and its business the management decided to lift the lockout.

 Over 500 union members were, however, detained at Ulsoor gate on charges of unlawful assembly, police said. 

 Describing the claim of 200 workers turning up for work as bogus, Toyota union joint secretary R. Ravi said: Only 60 people turned up for duty. The management has roped in local people and provided them proxy identity cards to display larger numbers.

 Nanavati snubbed on Godhra

 Ahmedabad: The U.C. Banerjee committee, which had dismissed any conspiracy behind the Godhra train fire, is allegedly reluctant to hand over documents to the Nanavati-Shah Commission probing the Sabarmati Express tragedy and the riots that followed, reports our correspondent.

 The commission had requested Banerjee for the documents he had collected during his investigations. But it was told the Banerjee committee is setting up a committee to decide whether to hand over the papers, Vishwa Hindu Parishad representative Deepak Shukla claimed on Saturday.

 Bus crashes

 Nashik (PTI): Twenty-two people were killed and 40 injured when a private bus skidded of the road, dashed against a tree and overturned at Ahivant-Wadi-Phata, about 48 km from here on Saturday.

 Narrow escape

 Jalandhar (PTI): Passengers of the Lahore-Delhi Sada-e-Sarhad bus on Saturday had a close shave when the vehicle collided with an army truck at Choggiti near here. The 24 passengers in the Delhi Transport Corporation bus were safe though some window-panes were broken, police said.

 Family burnt

 Ludhiana (PTI): Eight members of a family, including six children, were charred to death when a fire broke out in their house in a village 20 km from here, police said. The fire was believed to have been caused by a hearth left burning.

The first Lahore-Amritsar Dosti Express bus returned on Saturday with no Indian passengers. Only 15 Pakistani officials were on board.

 Misinformation menace

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: A crucial not is missing in the typed copy of a judgment, and the Central Information Commission is in a soup. 

 What complicates matters is that the document has reached the person concerned and a newspaper has published a report on the nature of the judgment, which is in complete contrast to what the commission had intended to convey.

 An information commissioner calls the under-secretary and ticks him off for allowing the glaring error to go through unchecked. But he knows where the fault actually lies. 

 The image of the Central Information Commission is getting sullied by such errors, but with the shortage in staff, this is inevitable, he said.

 A severe shortage of bureaucrats and support staff at the Central Information Commission is also slowing down disbursal of information to appellants, officials said.

 The central guardian of the Right to Information Act receives hundreds of applications every day, and each of the five information commissioners hears at least five cases a day. Decisions are passed on five to 10 cases a day. 

 Each case has a set of relevant documents the appeal, the response of the public authority and the decisions of earlier hearings in the case which need to be carefully checked before the judgment is circulated to the parties involved, a commissioner said.

 Two joint secretaries and one under-secretary, accompanied by a registrar and an assistant registrar, are the only officials with an understanding of the law applicable to the commission. With each application being scanned by them before it reaches the commissioners, they have to ensure that there are no errors. 

 The registrar and the assistant registrar coordinate with ministries and departments and also maintain the commission website. Here, too, commissioners say, the burden is too much for two persons to handle. To make matters worse, ministries often fail to respond to appeals within the time stipulated under the information act.

 We have spoken to the Prime Minister and the government about this problem. We are, however, still waiting for more staff, a commissioner said.

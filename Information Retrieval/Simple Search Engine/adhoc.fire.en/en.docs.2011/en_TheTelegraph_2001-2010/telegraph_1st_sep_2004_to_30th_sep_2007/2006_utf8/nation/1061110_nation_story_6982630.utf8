 Court glare on fake PIL

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, 

 Nov. 9: A fake public interest litigation filed 

 in Calcutta High Court today turned the glare back on misuse 

 of PILs.

 This is strange that fictitious PILs are coming up before us for hearing. The court cannot entertain a PIL moved for the personal gain of petitioners, Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar said.

 This is not the first time the court has addressed the menace. While hearing a case that a Behala resident had filed a few years ago opposing the Calcutta corporations green signal to a private entrepreneur to build a market-cum-shopping complex on the EM Bypass, the court had threatened to impose heavy penalty on such litigants. 

 The Supreme Court, too, has come down heavily on false PILs.

 Parents barred from meeting daughter

 New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): Delhi High Court has restrained a girls parents from visiting her after she moved court saying they were trying to interfere in her married life.

 Baljeet Singh, who had allegedly threatened his daughter and son-in-law when they refused to meet him, has been told by the court to give an undertaking that he will not see them until the girl wants to meet her family members.

 Justice S.N. Aggarwal called the situation unfortunate and expressed the courts inability to resolve such issues.

 Before marriage, he said, Sangeeta Gill had all love and affection for her parents. The joy that her parents shared with her during her youth completely vanished after the marriage for reasons best known to the parties (Sangeeta and her parents).

 The court cannot help them as Sangeeta does not want to budge from her stand.

 Sangeeta had an arranged marriage. In her petition, she said her parents visited her new home frequently and interfered in her family affairs.

 The parents apparently threatened Sangeeta and her husband Satpal Gill when she told them that she did not want to see them again.

 After the threat, she sought criminal proceedings against them.

 The judge said Sangeetas father denied the accusation and assured the court that he would not go to his daughters house again.

 Baljeet also said that the doors to his house would always be open for Sangeeta and Satpal.

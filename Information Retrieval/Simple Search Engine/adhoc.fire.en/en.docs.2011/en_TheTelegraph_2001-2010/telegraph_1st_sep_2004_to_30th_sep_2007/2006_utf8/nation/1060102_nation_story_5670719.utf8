 Another rape in car

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: The year 2005 ended in Delhi on a note that has become all too familiar to residents and police: the gangrape of a woman in a moving car.

 This time, the accused were a cousin of the victims husband and two of his friends.

 The 31-year-old woman was going to a market at Narela in northwest Delhi yesterday to buy vegetables when she ran into Vikram and his friends Sushil and Naresh. They offered her a lift.

 As the victim knew Vikram, who used to come to their house frequently, she got into the car, the deputy commissioner of police (northwest Delhi), Virender Chahel, told reporters.

 The men drove around the city raping the woman before dropping her near her home.

 She narrated the incident to her family who brought her to the police station to register a complaint, Chahel said. A medical examination has confirmed rape.

 Sushil, 20, and Naresh, 22, have been arrested but Vikram has gone into hiding.

 Earlier in the year, Delhi police had come under fire for their failure to react fast enough when a Delhi University student was dragged into a Santro by four men, who drove around the capital raping her. One of the suspects in the May 8 crime has been arrested but there are still no leads on the others.

 A similar case brought the police under a cloud again in July. A pregnant woman was kidnapped yards from her home in a Mayapuri slum and raped by four men in a moving car. The woman was grabbed at night when she went out to relieve herself.

 In August, a 16-year-old was gangraped by seven persons inside a bus. The accused were arrested after a local resident tipped the police off about them.

 Delhis rape graph has steadily risen in the past few months with a series of kidnappings and rape. In 2005, the city recorded 598 rapes and 684 molestations compared with 551 rapes and 601 molestations in 2004.

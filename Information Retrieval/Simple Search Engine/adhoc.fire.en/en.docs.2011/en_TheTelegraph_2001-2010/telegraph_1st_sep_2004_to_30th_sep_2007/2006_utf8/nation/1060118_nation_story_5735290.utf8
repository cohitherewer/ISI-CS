 Twins swap goodwill lists

 GAUTAM DATT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: India and Pakistan today exchanged lists of measures to instil confidence in the ongoing peace process.

 Delhi proposed that no new military post should come up along the Line of Control and sought brigade commander-level flag meetings. 

 Islamabad said it was ready to consider Indias draft on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents and unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. Pakistan suggested that as both countries have tested cruise missiles, the existing pre-notification agreement should include cruise missiles.

 The first day of the third round of foreign secretary-level composite dialogue was devoted to reviewing the peace process, which has been studded with positive features like starting the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus link, opening up the LoC and setting up a new hotline between the foreign secretaries.

 Despite the positive vibes, there was no let-up in raising the difficult questions during the two sessions today. 

 Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan spoke against Delhis comments on Balochistan. But his Indian counterpart Shyam Saran was quick to reject the argument, dubbing it unfounded.

 Day Two of the talks tomorrow will focus on the contentious issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Islamabad has already brought it up once, when Khan called on minister of state for external affairs E. Ahamed and reminded him that the current environment should be used to sort out the conflict. 

 Pakistan has also proposed a discussion on the threat perception and reduction in force levels. It does not want army strike formations to be relocated permanently and has sought military-to-military exchanges and interactions between strategic institutions.

 The sources said Pakistan wants the two sides to work on declaring South Asia a ballistic missile-free zone. However, Delhi appeared cold to the suggestion.

 The suggestions are part of a draft submitted by the Pakistani delegation in response to Indias proposal on preventing nuclear accidents last year. Islamabad had earlier expressed reservations on the issue.

 Pakistan also suggested that inadvertent crossing of the LoC or the International Border should be dealt with at the earliest and people held in such cases should be returned. Pakistan mooted a formal agreement on this.

 India made several offers to expand people-to-people contact. It offered to extend the Munabao-Khokrapar rail link to Ajmer Sharif and raise the number of flights to 24, adding Peshawar to the list of destinations.

 Tech Naidu tries tomatoes

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Naidu

 Hyderabad, Dec. 5: 

 He was a tech-savvy chief minister, until the voters logged 

 him out over two years back. Now, hes turning over 

 a new leaf marketing vegetables and fruits.

 Chandrababu Naidu is passionate about retail, a trait he shares with Mukesh Ambani, whose Reliance Industries flagged off his retail venture with a store in Hyderabad.

 Fresh, the retail chain of Naidus Heritage Foods (India) Pvt Ltd, also opened its innings with a string of stores last week. 

 Each of our stores will be 3000-square feet in area, offering 40 products on the shelf every day, said an official at the companys outlet in Vikrampuri.

 Fifteen such stores are planned in Hyderabad by the end of this month, he said, adding that the companys debut in Chennai and Bangalore could be made with similar numbers.

 Naidus roots in farm marketing go back a long way. His first assignment as a Telugu Desam Party leader was to head the AP Karshak Parishad in 1984. 

 During his eight years as chief minister, Naidu had developed a large tract of land in Nellore into orchards.

 He pushed through similar plans in Chittoor, particularly in Kuppam, his Assembly seat, growing tomatoes, gherkins and capsicum and other vegetables on hundreds of acres by successfully tapping Israeli technology. 

 Unlike the hoopla around Naidus infotech ventures when he was the states helmsman, the launch of Fresh last week was rather muted. 

 At most events, it was his wife Bhuvaneswari who presided. A lot of it is a family affair. Naidus son, Nara Lokesh, back home after a stint at the World Bank, is looking after Heritage Foods retail ventures. 

 The CEO is M. Sambashiv Rao, a former bureaucrat who worked in the chief ministers office when Naidu was in power. Rao resigned as additional secretary in the finance ministry last year to join Naidus business empire. He is said to be the brain behind the retail division. 

 Heritage Foods, believed to be a Rs 310-crore company with its milk and milk products business in Andhra and parts of Karnataka, has roped in KSA Technopak and Curt Salmon Associates as consultants. 

 We will supply the market what it needs, not impose our products or ideas, the official said. The backbone of the retail business is a call centre that evaluates demand and streamlines supplies from all southern states.

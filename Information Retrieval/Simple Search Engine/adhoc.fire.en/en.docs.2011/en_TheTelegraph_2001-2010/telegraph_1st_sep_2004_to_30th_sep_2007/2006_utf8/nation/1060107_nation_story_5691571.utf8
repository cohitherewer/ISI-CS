 1942: A soldiers love story

 MUKHTAR AHMAD 

 Now for real.

 Srinagar, Jan. 6: Theirs is a love story that survived a world war and many bigger odds.

 But then, 105-year-old Beigh Hussain and 90-year-old Sharja Bibi, who tied the knot last year, are no ordinary couple.

 In 1939, Hussain was battling the mighty forces of Hitler in Libya and Burma as a soldier of British Indias army. But the Second World War could not kill him ? he had a tryst to make with destiny.

 Back home in Surankote village in the Jammu region, Hussains love ? 24-year-old Sharja Bibi ? was waiting.

 The soldier returned from the battlefield in 1942 and promptly proposed to her. But like all legendary love stories, Hussains was no bed of roses. Sharjas family turned away her lover, who was not only 42 years old but also married twice. 

 A broken-hearted Hussain left the village and joined the army again. As he survived enemies bullets in far-off lands, he was losing the love of his life.

 Sharjas brothers married her off to a neighbour.

 After retiring from the army, Hussain returned to his village and began living in his beloveds neighbourhood.

 1942: Hussains love story ? like the one in the Anil Kapoor-Manisha Koirala film ? may have suffered years of painful wait, but happiness could not ignore it forever.

 Last year, Sharjas husband died and Cupid got to work. This time, it was Sharja who popped the question.

 But the battle was not over yet. The brides brothers stood in the lovers way again. They lodged an FIR, accusing Hussain of kidnapping their sister.

 But this time, Hussain was not alone. The elders of the village stood by him and made sure the wedding bells rang loud and clear.

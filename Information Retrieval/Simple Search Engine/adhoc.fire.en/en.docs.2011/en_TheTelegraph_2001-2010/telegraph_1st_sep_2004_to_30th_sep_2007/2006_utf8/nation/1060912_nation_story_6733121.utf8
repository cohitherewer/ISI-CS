 Gandhigiri earns Munnabhai tax-free tag

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 Sanjay Dutt in Lage Raho Munnabhai: Role model

 New Delhi, Sept 11: Munnabhai couldnt have chosen a better time to meet the Mahatma. 

 Lage Raho Munnabhai, which hit the screens around the same time as the centenary of Gandhijis satyagraha, has been made tax-free by the Delhi government.

 Some of the credit should go to Rajya Sabha member Mohsina Kidwai. Yesterday, at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, she veered the talks towards the Sanjay Dutt-starrer.

 The CWC was discussing how best to celebrate hundred years of the launch of satyagraha in South Africa. The centenary falls today.

 After the meeting, the Congress announced the formation of a sub-committee to chalk out a programme marking the event across the country.

 Sheila Dixits Delhi has already taken the lead with Lage Raho. Today, her government announced that there would be no entertainment tax on the film in the capital.

 The sequel to the hugely popular Munnabhai MBBS is doing rather well at the box office, and a tax-free status gives it a good boost. And thanks to its satyagraha link, no one is complaining. 

 Aamir Khans Lagaan had bagged the tax-free tag and so had one of the Bhagat Singh films. Even Omkara managed it in Uttar Pradesh, despite a row over its foul language.

 The bhai-speak, though, has everyone clapping, not crying foul. It is a clean film, Kidwai said today. I think more people should see it.

 At the CWC meeting, she said the comedy, with its tapori dialogues, was just right to make Gandhi accessible to the next generation. 

 In Lage Raho, Dutts character is smitten by a radio jockey. To woo her, he must know his history. Thats when the bhai has an encounter with the Mahatma, and his life changes. He begins to practise Gandhigiri truth and non-violence rather than dadagiri (muscle power) to get the better of his rivals.

 And, of course, he gets the girl.

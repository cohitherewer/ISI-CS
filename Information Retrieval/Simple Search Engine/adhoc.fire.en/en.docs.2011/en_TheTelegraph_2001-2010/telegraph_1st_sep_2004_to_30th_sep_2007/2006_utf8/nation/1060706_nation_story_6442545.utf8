 Deficit worries Asim

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 5: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta told the Assembly today that 98 per cent of the states revenue was being used up to pay salaries, pension and interest on loans.

 Wrapping up the three-day discussion on the state budget for 2006-07, placed in the House on June 23, Dasgupta said this huge expenditure was contributing to Bengals high revenue deficit. 

 However, he added that efforts were on to bring down the 98 per cent figure to 80.

 We are committed to the welfare of our employees but there should also be an emphasis on reduction in the revenue deficit. I am confident of reducing the amount spent on salaries, pension and interest payments to 80 per cent of revenue receipts, Dasgupta said. 

 He did not elaborate on the measures to be adopted to bring down the deficit but made it clear that he was anticipating a huge jump in the collection of value-added tax (VAT). I believe that collections from VAT would go a long way in addressing financial problems the state is faced with.

 Responding to Opposition barbs that he had failed to contain public debt, now a whopping Rs 1.25 lakh crore, Dasgupta blamed the Centre for charging high rates of interest on loans.

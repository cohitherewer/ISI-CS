 Eager Advani at odds with BJP 

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, July 12: In his haste to grab the limelight, L.K. Advani today ended up contradicting his partys official stand on yesterdays terror strikes in Mumbai.

 Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJPs top office-bearers passed a resolution accusing the United Progressive Alliance of turning India into a soft state and asking it to either govern or get out.

 Advani (in picture), on the other hand, praised police and the administration and declared it is not the time to criticise the government.

 The former party chief hadnt attended the meeting that framed the resolution. By the time his party colleagues met here this morning, Advani, who was in Ahmedabad, had left for Mumbai to meet the blast victims and their families.

 But his initiative seemed to have backfired as the resolution by Vajpayee, Jaswant Singh, Rajnath Singh and other top BJP leaders ? which followed Advanis comments ? took a completely opposite view.

 Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad tried to control the damage by arguing that Advanis statement was reflected in the resolution. The spirit of what Advaniji said is part of the resolution, Prasad said.

 Another senior leader, though, explained the contrast in the statements as a result of Advanis eagerness to show his face in Mumbai.

 He wasnt present at the office-bearers meeting. He may have just missed what they said. I dont see a grand design in this ? Advaniji was just displaying his enthusiasm to empathise with the blast victims, he said.

 The partys official resolution was a direct attack on the government.

 The UPA has sent consistent signals that initiative against terrorism can be traded for votes?. They have created an environment wherein the infrastructure of terrorism can breed, grow and create havoc in the country, the resolution said.

 The UPA has not ensured that the government of Pakistan fulfils its commitments? that any territory under its control would not be used for cross-border terrorism. The BJP demands that the UPA chooses between their votes or national security. It must either govern or get out.

 But Advani chose to be generous. He congratulated the police, doctors and volunteers in Mumbai for their commendable work in the citys hour of crisis. I salute the spirit of Mumbai, he said.

 It is not the time to criticise the government on its acts of omission and commission, he said. The raja and the praja (people) must unitedly face the immediate challenge before us. However, I do hope the government realises the gravity of the terrorist aggression.

 It was Advani, however, who had first accused the ruling alliance of sacrificing national security for vote-bank politics. That was months ago, when he was saying why he would undertake his Bharat Suraksha Yatra in April-May.

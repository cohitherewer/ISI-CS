 Dengue deaths touch 50

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The number of dengue deaths has climbed to 50, health officials said today.

 Releasing fresh figures for the twin infections being reported in some parts of the country, they said the number of people infected with dengue had risen to 3,613 while those suspected to have chikungunya had crossed 1.3 million.

 A small number of elderly people with chikungunya have died in Kerala and Gujarat. However, there is no evidence yet to establish that the virus caused these deaths, the officials said.

 Our teams are in Kerala and Ahmedabad investigating the circumstances in which these patients died, Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said. 

 Two patients have died in Ahmedabad and about 80 in Kerala. We cannot attribute these deaths to chikungunya yet, but older people appear to be vulnerable. 

 Health officials also pointed out that only a small fraction of blood samples of patients suspected with chikungunya actually tested positive. Among 13,500 samples tested for chikungunya from all over the country, only 1,530 were found infected.

 Were mainly testing for chikungunya and dengue, said Shiv Lal, director of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. The others might have been infected with some other virus, he said.

 Although the same mosquito transmits both diseases, Ganguly said, only one person in Karnataka was found to be infected with both dengue and chikungunya. 

 The spread of chikungunya has been much faster than that of dengue.

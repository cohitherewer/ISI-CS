 Pilgrims progress, 2 a second

 Hyderabad, May 28: Imagine making an Internet booking days in advance and still finding yourself in a 90-hour queue, which is being cleared at the rate of two persons a second.

 Welcome to the Tirupati temple, where the rush of devotees is growing by the day despite quick service being restricted to the likes of Anil Ambani and Amitabh Bachchan. Or the countrys President.

 Footfalls have reached unprecedented levels, and the waiting period has crossed 90 hours even though we manage to rush almost 6,000 persons through in an hour, said A.P.V.N. Sharma, executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Dewasthanam.

 This year, a record 3.6 lakh pilgrims arrived on Askhaya Thirtha, April 30. Not an inch of land was vacant at Tirumala, an eyewitness averred.

 This is remarkable for any religious institution on the planet, said Dewasthanam joint executive officer Dharma Reddy.

 The past two years have seen a rise in visits by the bold and the beautiful. Nearly 3,000 VVIPs ? including governors, actors, business magnates and politicians ? came in 2005. This year, we have already had 2,500 VVIP visits, an official said.

 Among devotees of Balaji, the presiding deity, are industry captains Vijay Mallya, Anil Ambani and Ratan Tata as well as film stars Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, too, paid a visit.

 At the other end of the spectrum are the publicity-shy good samaritans. A donor from Chennai has been supplying 150 kg of ghee every day while another from Bangalore has been sending some 17,000 yards of silk a year, used in all festivals and rituals.

 Many others have chipped in with camphor, sandal paste and flowers. The temple has received almost 75 kg of gold ornaments for the deity from the faithful.

 We have broadband connectivity across the country, not only for booking of rooms and allocation of darshan, but also for collection of donation and sale of prasadam. The rush has increased after we streamlined our online service systems to help pilgrims, Sharma said.

 The huge queues have spelt prosperity. On April 30, there was a fourfold increase in revenue from almost every source ? the hundi collection, seva fees, sale of laddu prasadam and revenue from tonsuring of devotees.

 The temple earns almost Rs 75 crore in hundi collection a year and has a turnover of over Rs 800 crore. It has a gold reserve of Rs 340 crore besides a cash surplus of Rs 650 crore.

 We spend almost Rs 35 lakh a day on free meals, water, shelter, transport and education for the poor, an official said.

 The Dewasthanam, however, stays under the vice-like grip of its chairman, Union minister of state for mines, T. Subbirami Reddy. The minister came under a cloud during the office-of-profit controversy but the post has now been included in the new exemption list.

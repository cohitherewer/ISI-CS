 Srinagar, Jan. 4: Kashmiris may be used to their homes being searched, but the recent raids were still rather unusual. What the government was looking for were not insurgents but electric heaters and water boilers.

 Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has now ordered a halt to the intrusive save-power campaign by the electricity department as he tries to pacify a valley seething at what it saw as an outrage.

 Azad, taken aback by Mondays bandh against the valley-wide raids, has disowned them, ordered a probe and toned down the campaign despite the acute power shortage in the state.

 The chief minister said it wasnt him who had ordered these raids by the electricity department and that such an ambitious exercise should not have been launched without sounding out the public. He has, however, suggested judicious use of power-guzzling gadgets.

 Residents said that during a biting winter, they have virtually no means to keep themselves warm other than switching on the heaters.

 How do you heat up the living room? How do you wash yourself without hot water? How do you give up the use of electric heaters and boilers unless the government makes available alternative means of heating? said an angry Mehraj-ud-Din.

 He complained of bias against the valley, saying there is no ban on Jammu residents using coolers and air-conditioners in the summer.

 It was perhaps this cry of discrimination that alarmed the chief minister, suggested Muzamil Ahmad, a 35-year-old schoolteacher.

 Mondays torrid weather, however, has caused a valley-wide power shutdown with the old and worn-out electric poles and transmission lines uprooted by the heavy snow.

 Electricity department officials claimed a third of the power lines had been restored, but reports pouring in from the towns and hundreds of villages said people are still reeling under a blackout.

 We had no electricity for the last three days. Given the status of uprooted electric poles and fallen transmission lines in our village, it is unlikely we would have any electricity for at least a week now, said Mohammad Ramzan, 48, of Chattergul village, 36 km from Srinagar.

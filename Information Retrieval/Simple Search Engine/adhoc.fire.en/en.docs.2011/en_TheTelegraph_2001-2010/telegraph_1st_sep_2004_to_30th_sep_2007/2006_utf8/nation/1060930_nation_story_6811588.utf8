 IIM unveils quota plan

 IIM-A chairman NR Narayana Murthy

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 29: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, today announced a three-year plan for staggered introduction of the 27 per cent other backward classes quota, starting with the next academic session.

 Institutions need to increase seats by about 54 per cent to implement the quota without slashing seats for the general-category students, as agreed. IIM Ahmedabad plans to increase seats by 10 per cent in the academic year 2007-8, another 18 per cent (of the current seats) in 2008-9 and the remaining 26 per cent in 2009-10.

 The move by the B-school, one of Indias showpiece institutions of excellence, will hearten the Union human resource development minstry. Till now, most central institutions of higher education, which are to implement the quota, have failed to hand in roadmaps on how they plan to put the quota into practice.

 The IIM Ahmedabad board of governors today approved the plan after a discussion on the need for resources and more faculty members, institute chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy said.

 But the premier B-school, which over the past five years has not sought government grants as its own corpus has proved enough, will now apply for central funds. This will be needed to build new infrastructure, because the institute must expand if the quota is to be introduced.

 The recurring expenditure, however, will be met through internal resources, the chairman said.

 The Veerappa Moily quota oversight committee has recommended that the government seek private funds to implement the quota. It has also suggested that three more IIMs and more IIT-like institutions be built to supply the extra seats.

 IIM Ahmedabad is preparing a perspective plan for the next 40 years and, after its next board meeting, is likely to approach the Gujarat government for land for its expansion project, director Bakul Dholakia said.

 The B-school has also decided to set up an international advisory council to advise it on how to build a global brand.

 The board has also decided to create a gender resources centre at the institute. It will be largely a research centre, the director said.

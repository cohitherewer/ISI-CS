 Chawla under profit panel glare

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 15: The MP heading the parliamentary panel on offices of profit today moved the Supreme Court seeking Navin Chawlas removal from the Election Commission in view of allegations against him.

 Chandra Bushan Singh pointed out that Chawla had been indicted by the Shah Commission, which probed excesses committed during the Emergency, and had also been charged with indirectly receiving money from members of a political party.

 The Samajwadi Party MP has sought an order to restrain the poll panel from deciding on applications relating to disqualification for holding an office of profit till the court decides on his petition.

 Singh also requested the court to define the term office of profit for the purpose of disqualification from Parliament and state legislatures.

 He has argued that the Election Commission should seek the views of the joint parliamentary committee before deciding on the disqualification applications.

 Pointing out that the National Democratic Alliance had already moved a petition before the President for Chawlas removal, Singh sought a writ calling for an explanation as to how Chawla was holding on to the post.

 He said that Chawla was appointed election commissioner in May 2005 despite facing serious charges.

 He cited reports that a six-acre plot had been allotted to Chawla by the Jaipur Development Authority at a very low rate and donations for construction on the plot were made by two MPs from their local area development funds.

 There were reports that Chawla also got a plot of land at Jasola for which contributions came from three Congress MPs. 

 Reports said a trust run by his wife had received donations from several Congress MPs.

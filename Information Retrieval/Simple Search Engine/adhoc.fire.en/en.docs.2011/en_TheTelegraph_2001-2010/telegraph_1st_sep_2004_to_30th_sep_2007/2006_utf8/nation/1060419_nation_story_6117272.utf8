 Katiyar shoved into Sonia battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Katiyar

 New Delhi, April 18: Around the last time there was an election in Rae Bareli, Sushma Swaraj had escaped tonsure by a hairs breadth.

 As the constituency heads for the booths again, the Sonia Gandhi effect is back to torment the BJP. This time its Vinay Katiyar who is tearing his hair out in frustration as he is dragged to the arena, kicking and screaming, by his party.

 The BJP general secretary, who believes contesting against Sonia would amount to harakiri, was named party candidate from Rae Bareli this evening despite his protests and a last-minute dash to Varanasi to try and stop the formal announcement.

 I tell you I wont do it (contest from Rae Bareli), Katiyar screamed at this reporter over the phone. I am rushing to Varanasi. Ill approach Atalji. This is gross injustice.

 Katiyar has been privately mouthing what a local party worker described as unspeakable things against the senior leaders who have forced him to fall in line.

 For all his threats to knock at Atal Bihari Vajpayees door ? the final court of appeal in the BJP ? the party was in no mood to give into his tantrums. Katiyar had earlier bullied state BJP leaders Lalji Tandon and Kalraj Mishra into abandoning the effort to field him.

 Katiyar reportedly told Mishra that the veteran leader should himself volunteer to take on the Congress president and become famous in his old age.

 Sonia

 Finally, L.K. Advanis services 

 were summoned. Advani reportedly gave Katiyar a dressing 

 down today, telling him he had no choice.

 Many BJP leaders had earlier suggested the party shouldnt field anyone against Sonia ? and later claim she had won an election nobody wanted to contest. Advani was said to be livid at the idea, saying there was no way the party could escape the battlefield.

 The real battle, however, is not against Sonia, whose victory is certain. The partys prime concern is to prevent Prabha Singh Lodh, the Apna Dal candidate supported by Uma Bharti, from bagging more votes than the BJP contender.

 We simply cant let that happen. Uma would go around advertising that her claim of being the real BJP has been proved true, a source said.

 The Apna Dal is a fringe party supported by the backward Lodhs ? Umas own caste ? and Kurmi farmers. As Katiyar is a Kurmi, he is the BJPs only hope of putting up a fight.

 The party broke through Katiyars resistance late this evening. At 7.30 pm in Varanasi, BJP chief Rajnath Singh announced his name. Katiyar will file his nomination on Thursday.

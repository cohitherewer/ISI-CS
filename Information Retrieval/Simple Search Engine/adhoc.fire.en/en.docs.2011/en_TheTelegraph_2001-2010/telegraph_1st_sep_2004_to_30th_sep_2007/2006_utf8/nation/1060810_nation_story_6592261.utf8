 New Delhi, Aug. 9: India will lead the anti-terror group formed within Bimstec, an association that also includes Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Bhutan.

 The group will find ways to choke funds to insurgents, share intelligence, cooperate on law enforcement and prevent drug-trafficking.

 The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Structural Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec), which was formed 15 years ago, will hold its second summit in Delhi on February 8, 2007.

 Foreign ministers of the member countries met here today for a brainstorming session where ways to turn Bimstec into a gateway to Southeast Asia were explored.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who hosted lunch for the ministers, asked them to strengthen the group. 

 Sri Lankan foreign minister Mangala Samarweera told minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed that his government was not considering war as an option despite the situation turning grim after the LTTE stepped up its offensive.

 Bimstec is trying to improve connectivity among member-nations around the Bay of Bengal. Officials said studies to build roads from India to Nepal and Bangladesh have been commissioned. The Asian Development Bank, which will help countries within the group develop infrastructure, has drawn up a road map on movement of goods and people in other parts of the region. 

 The seven-nation group hopes the free-trade-area agreement aimed at increasing trade and investment and boosting competition will be sealed in time for the next summit. A negotiating team on the issue met in Colombo last month.

 The other area where efforts will be pooled is energy cooperation. On the cards is a centre in India, which will serve as the focal point for all future initiatives. The collaboration will take the shape of more grids gas pipelines and hydropower networks. Renewable energy sources will also be tapped under this plan.

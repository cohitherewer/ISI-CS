 Church bid to clean up education

 RUDRA BISWAS

 Ranchi, Feb. 19: Quota for girls, backwards, Dalits and marginalised children in convent schools and a ban on capitation fees across the country have been proposed at the 27th general assembly of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI).

 The highest policy-making body of the Roman Catholic Church in India, the CBCI deplored attempts of commercialisation of the education system. It said, a quota system for girls, marginalised, Dalits and tribal children would be enforced voluntarily even if academic results suffer in the process.

 It has also urged the government to lay down a just fee structure to obviate the need for taking capitation fees and other donations.

 The CBCI decision, endorsed by 160 bishops from across the country who had gathered at the week-long Bangalore conclave from February 8 to 15, will be immediately implemented in all Catholic-run schools and colleges in the country.

 The CBCI commission for education and culture has been entrusted with the role of drawing up a uniform quota system and a national education policy. The commission has been asked to draft a final policy within a year and take the help of the SC, ST commission in this regard, Cardinal Telesphore P. Toppo told The Telegraph.

 In a final statement released by the cardinal, on his return to Ranchi at the end of the conclave, he said the Church in India runs 20,370 educational institutions, of which more than 58 per cent are located in villages.

 The cardinal was recently re-elected the president of the CBCI for a second term.

 About 54.4 per cent of the students in our institutions are girls and a vast majority of them are from other faiths. Marginalisation has been a phenomenon in our country from very early days, especially as a result of the caste system. Caste discrimination continues and, sadly, has its repercussions on the Church. By marginalisation, we refer especially to Dalits, tribals, economically weaker sections of our society, the migrants, displaced, the girl child, slow learners and other disabled persons, the final CBCI statement read.

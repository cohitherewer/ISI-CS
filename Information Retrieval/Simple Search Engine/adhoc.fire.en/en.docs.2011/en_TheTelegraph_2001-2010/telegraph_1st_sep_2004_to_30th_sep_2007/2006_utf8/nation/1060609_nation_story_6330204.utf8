 Change of heart sends Pramods party to son

 New Delhi, June 8: The BJP appears to have changed its mind about keeping safe distance from Rahul Mahajan, with three senior leaders visiting Tughlaq Road police station today where he was being held.

 The law must, of course, take its own course. But this is a human tragedy. It could have happened to anyone. While this is not the partys affair, why should anyone object to some leaders going and meeting Rahul in the lock-up? asked spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad, after M. Venkaiah Naidu, Kalraj Mishra and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi visited the lock-up.

 Till yesterday, the party, afraid of more skeletons tumbling out of the Mahajan closet after Rahul got tangled in a narcotics abuse case, was singing a different tune. 

 The BJP has nothing to do with this episode, Sushma Swaraj said emphatically, not once but twice in 24 hours, rebuffing Atal Bihari Vajpayee who had taken a softer line.

 Sushmas statement, which had the support of most leaders, appears to have upset party workers who felt the BJP was abandoning the family of the late Pramod Mahajan in its hour of crisis. It took no time for BJP president Rajnath Singh, who was known to be close to Pramod Mahajan, to change the party line.

 Rajnath was one of the first to visit Rahul in Apollo Hospital where he was rushed early on Friday, before the party washed its hands of the family tragedy.

 Another factor that might have led Rajnath to change the partys stand is L.K. Advanis silence. While Advani has let it be known that he was deeply disturbed by the incident, he has chosen not to speak a word. 

 Vajpayee, on the other hand, appeared to offer sympathy when he said such mistakes happen in young age.

 Sushmas statement was made after a meeting of senior party leaders, but the decision to distance the BJP from the mess that Rahul is in is believed to have been influenced mostly by Advani. 

 To an extent, this line also showed Rajnath in poor light because he had expressed sympathy for Pramod Mahajans son in public. 

 That Naidu, an Advani camp-follower, chose to visit the lock-up today is the only jarring note in the theory that Advani was directing the earlier party line. 

 However, Naidu, who could not meet Rahul as he had been taken to the hospital for a check-up, said he went out of curiosity. He claimed he saw a big media crowd gathered at Tughlaq Road police station and only went to enquire what was happening. 

 The BJP has now decided it would treat the Rahul case as a human tragedy, and selected leaders would keep in touch with his family. The party might take a more proactive interest as the case progresses. 

 We are watching the developments very carefully. We are already sensing a witch-hunt. If they (the police) persecute him, the party may decide to take up the matter more forcefully, a senior leader said.

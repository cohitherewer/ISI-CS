 Flight snub for MP

 POORNIMA JOSHI

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Laxman Singh, on his way to the UN General Assembly, had to head back from Delhi airport on Sunday after Emirates Airline refused to fly him to the US.

 The Madhya Pradesh BJP MP was part of a parliamentary delegation to the 61st session of the General Assembly. 

 Singh, the younger brother of Congress leader Digvijay Singh, claims he was humiliated and denied a boarding pass by airline staff because he did not have FBI clearance.

 While the airline did not comment, a US embassy source said: Nobody needs FBI clearance to go to the US unless you have a criminal case or an Interpol reference. 

 Singh and his wife Rubina reached the airport around 4 am on Sunday. 

 We went and sat in the VIP lounge. Ministry of external affairs officials were to take our tickets and get the boarding cards, he said. Just as we had settled down, I was summoned to the airline counter by this lady who wanted me to provide proof of my being part of a diplomatic mission.

 Singh says he produced the MEA documents but was told he could not take the flight to New York. The airline staff said he could fly to Dubai if he wished. Rubina, however, was free to travel to the US.

 The airline did not respond to Singhs accusations though a questionnaire was sent to them. A spokesperson said: We are currently investigating the matter and will revert with a comment tomorrow.

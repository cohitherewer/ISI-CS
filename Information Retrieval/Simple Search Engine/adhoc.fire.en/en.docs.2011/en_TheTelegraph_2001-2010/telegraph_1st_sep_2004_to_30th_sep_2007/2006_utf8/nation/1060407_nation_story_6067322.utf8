 Mt Tomato grows on AP 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 BOUNTIFUL BURDEN

 Hyderabad, April 6: A bustling bazaar a few weeks ago has turned into a wasteland of vegetables.

 Farmers, who cannot afford to sell their produce at the price quoted by wholesalers, have been dumping mountains of tomatoes, brinjals, cauliflower and ladies fingers at Hyderabads Monda market.

 A bumper crop of over three million quintals grown on 10,000 hectares in Kurnool and Chittoor districts has driven the domestic price of one kg of tomato to as low as 25 paise. Cauliflowers and beans, grown on 15,000 hectares, are not faring any better with prices dipping to Rs 1.50 per kg. 

 Even carrots and ladies fingers were sold at Rs 4 per kg, driving farmers to nervous breakdown, said Gopal Kumar Shetty, a vegetable wholesaler at Monda market.

 Maneyya, a 38-year-old farmer from Gollagudem in Ranga Reddy district, had half-a-tonne of tomatoes, 25 kg of brinjals and other vegetables to sell. 

 The wholesalers want it almost for free and I am not getting even the transport cost if I agree to their rates, he said.

 So, the next best thing he did was to disappear from the scene, abandoning his produce that he had grown after almost two months of sweat.

 State government agencies waited at the market for the likes of Maneyya to come back. But they were nowhere in sight. So the agencies prepared to dispose the vegetables as garbage.

 Almost 30 tonnes of vegetables were dumped outside the city on Wednesday but today we expect the amount to grow to almost 40 tonnes of waste, says Venkteswalu, the joint director of the state horticulture department.

 Vegetables were grown over one lakh hectares in the current season as against 85,000 hectares in the rabi season.

 Thanks to the state government campaign asking farmers to opt out of paddy in view of the power scarcity, most of them chose vegetables and are in peril, said the former president of the state farmers federation, Changal Reddy.

 The farmers are requesting the government to buy their produce to stem the price plunge. They should do like in Karnataka where the government bought tomatoes to save the farmers. That they dumped nearly 200 quintals of tomatoes in garbage bins is a different matter, one of them said. 

 The state government, however, 

 is staying out. We told them we cannot give full power 

 to farming. But we did not ask them to grow vegetables or 

 for that matter only tomatoes or cauliflower. It is the 

 fault of the farmers and they are paying a heavy price, 

 said a senior official of the state agriculture department.

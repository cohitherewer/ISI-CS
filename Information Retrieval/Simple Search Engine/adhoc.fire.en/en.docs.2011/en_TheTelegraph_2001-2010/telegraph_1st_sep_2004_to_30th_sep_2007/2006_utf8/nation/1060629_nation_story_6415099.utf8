 JEE race won, hurdle remains

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, June 28: On an average, Dhananjoy Mondals family earns Rs 300 a month.

 His father is bed-ridden since being struck by a neurological disorder and mother is coping with acute diabetes without any medication.

 The 18-year-old walked 4 km to school every day for 12 years. 

 The son of a marginal farmer in an obscure village in Nadia has ranked 148th in the reserved category of the Joint Entrance Examination. 

 The rank will fetch Dhananjoy a seat at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, but he might still not be able to fulfil his dream of becoming a surgeon.

 The authorities have asked me to deposit Rs 5,200 as admission fees. We dont get to eat our meals every day? from where will I get the money? asked the boy, who came to the city for counselling borrowing money from fellow villagers.

 The family ? three brothers and parents ? owns a three-bigha plot near Haringhata, 40 km from the city. 

 Dhananjoys elder brother Sanjoy was forced to drop out of school and work in the field after their father was incapacitated.

 Sanjoy is the familys only earning member. But his income is uncertain. Sometimes, he works as a daily wager to earn a little extra ? Rs 30 a day. 

 Dhananjoys younger brother, Mrityunjoy. is preparing for his Madhyamik.

 I had always dreamt of studying MBBS, Dhananjoy said. 

 And he worked hard to come so close to it. He never had an umbrella in his entire life. He could often not study in the evenings because there was no money to buy kerosene for the lamp.

 Please do not ask me about our daily meal, Dhananjoy said, trying to hide his embarrassment unsuccessfully. 

 The monthly expense of studying at a medical college is about Rs 2,000.

 When in school, neighbours helped Dhananjoy with books. He scored 602 in Madhyamik and 759 in HS in 2003. After that, he worked in the field but the desire to make it to a medical college was too much to resist. 

 A friend who lives in a mess on the northern fringes of Calcutta offered him a place to stay free of cost and the address of a tutor ready to coach without fees some six months ago.

 Dhananjoy did not waste the godsend.

 Straight from the hip on hard problem

 Bedroom tip for Boardroom 

 Boost

 Hyderabad, Sept. 3: Forget 

 cancer and cholesterol. A bigger ailment threatens to make 

 Indias rising growth graphs go limp.

 The country is sitting on a time bomb of erectile dysfunction, says sexologist and infertility expert Sudhakar Krishnamurthi.

 Almost 52 per cent of males aged above 40 in India suffer from the problem. Its impact on productivity is bigger than that of diabetes, cancer, respiratory disorders and arthritis.

 The Hyderabad-based doctor explains that bad sex or no sex leads to poor performance in the workplace and troubled personal and professional relations. Good sex boosts performance at office, boosting national productivity and spelling success in ones career.

 Great in the bedroom, great in the boardroom, he told a spellbound thousand-odd tourism and hotel representatives at the Indian Travel Congresss annual convention here today.

 Krishnamurthi has all the facts at his fingertips. History shows that the bed is the best place for exercise, for good health as well as good relations with ones family, friends and colleagues, he said.

 Good sex improves mens physical attractiveness by 78 per cent, prolongs their life, lends personal charm and brings peace of mind. It can save lives by preventing prostate cancer.

 In women, sex elevates mood, cures depression, improves the health of skin and hair and reduces headache.

 Its also the answer for those looking to shed weight. You reduce 200 calories at each go.

 With so much at stake, the next figure he cites is depressing. Some 15.2 crore Indian men have erectile dysfunction, and the number keeps rising stubbornly at 14 per cent a year.

 Things would never have got this bad, he says, if Indian men werent so shy of going to qualified doctors with sexual problems. The disorder isnt hard to treat if diagnosed in time. His own clinic is ready to rise to the challenge.

 There are several institutions in Hyderabad, including my own, that can look into these problems. We have the infrastructure to cure both male and female (sexual) disorders.

 If properly advertised, these clinics could help bring more tourists to Andhra Pradesh which was his point in coming to the convention.

 The meeting almost rose to a man and applauded.

 Tycoon and Janata Party MP Vijay Mallya was in the audience, so was BJP leader L.K. Advani. They couldnt be contacted for their reaction.

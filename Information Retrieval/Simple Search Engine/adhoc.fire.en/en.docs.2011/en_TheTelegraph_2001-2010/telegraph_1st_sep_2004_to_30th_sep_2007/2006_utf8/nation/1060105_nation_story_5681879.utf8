 BJP stamp on Rajnath crown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: The BJP would hold a meeting of its over 600-member strong national council on January 20 to ratify the appointment of Rajnath Singh as president of the party. After ratification, Rajnaths term would coincide with that of the council, whose tenure expires in February 2007.

 Party representatives from all parliamentary constituencies, chief ministers of BJP-ruled states, state party presidents and about 150-odd national executive members are expected to take part in the council session that is being held twice within a period of just about a month. The last session of the council just got over in Mumbai.

 The forthcoming council session has only one agenda ? to ratify Rajnaths appointment. Rajnath is the third president to be appointed during the tenure of the present council. The first was M. Venkaiah Naidu, the second L.K. Advani with Rajnath being the third.

 The new chief has been busy meeting all senior party leaders. Rajnath had lunch with Atal Bihari Vajpayee this afternoon. He has also met Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Jaswant Singh, Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan and Venkaiah Naidu.

 Except for Kalyan Singh, all prominent leaders from Uttar Pradesh have met Rajnath. Kalyan chose to stay in Lucknow while the rest ? including Kalraj Mishra and Lalji Tandon ? came to Delhi to greet Rajnath. 

 But Rajnath dismissed all speculation about Kalyan being miffed with his selection. I have excellent personal rapport with Kalyan Singhji.

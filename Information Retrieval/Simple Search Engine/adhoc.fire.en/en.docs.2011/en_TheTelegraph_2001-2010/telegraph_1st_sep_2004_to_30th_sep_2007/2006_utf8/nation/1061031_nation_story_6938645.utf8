 Bihar boy sacrificed

 Patna, Oct. 30 (AP): Five people, including a confessed sorceress, have been arrested for sacrificing an 11-year-old boy in Bihar.

 The body of Gulu Kumar was found in a field yesterday near the village of Shaguni, around 15 km east of Patna, said superintendent of police Upendra Kumar Singh.

 Five women have been arrested and have confessed to the killing, Singh said.

 They said one of the women consulted the sorceress on how to save her critically ill two-month-old child. The sorceress, Manorma Devi, said he would only be cured if another male child was sacrificed to goddess Kali.

 The women abducted Gulu while he was returning from school, giving him a drugged candy. They took him to an altar to the goddess and slit his throat, Singh said.

 Singh said police had recovered the knife used in the crime and the women have been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder.

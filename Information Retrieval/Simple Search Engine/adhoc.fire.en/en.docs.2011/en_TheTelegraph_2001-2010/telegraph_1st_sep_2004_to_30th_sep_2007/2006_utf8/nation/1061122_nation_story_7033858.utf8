 Another IAF lady officer punished

 Chandigarh: A lady officer of the Indian Air Force was handed a years loss in service and a stinging rebuke by a military court here that punished her for allegedly driving a subordinate to suicide in 2005.

 Squadron Leader Priya Jairaj, a doctor, is the second IAF woman officer after Anjali Gupta to face such a disciplinary action. Air headquarters has confirmed the punishment of Jairaj, said T. Venugopal, the air officer commanding 12 Wing Air Force Station.

 Sergeant Srinivasan, 32, hanged himself from a tree near the air force station here in September 2005. He left behind a suicide note blaming Jairaj for harassment. 

 Jairaj was facing charges of abetting the suicide under various provisions of the Air Force Act and the IPC.

 Rape dismiss plea rejected

 New Delhi (PTI): A court has 

 issued summons to three rape accused, while rejecting a 

 plea by police to dismiss the case, after the victim filed 

 a complaint before it.

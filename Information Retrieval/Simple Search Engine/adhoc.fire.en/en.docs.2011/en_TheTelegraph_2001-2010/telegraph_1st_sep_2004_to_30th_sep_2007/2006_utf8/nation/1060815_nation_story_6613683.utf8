 Mumbai, Aug. 14: Schools have made special arrangements following reports of possible terror attacks before or after Independence Day.

 We are not only augmenting our security but also conducting drills with students and parents to prepare for emergencies, said Jasmine Vaz, principal of Jamnabai Narsee School. 

 The move was forced by a spate of hoax calls that kept many schools on their toes since the July 11 train blasts. We are working closely with the parent-teacher association to put in place a quick-evacuation plan in any emergency situation, she added.

 Many schools are putting up metal detectors. Parents contact details, especially mobiles numbers, are being rechecked and updated. 

 Some, like the Dhirubhai Ambani International School, already have in place a chain call system, through which information is passed on to parents through SMS or cell phone calls.

 Vaz said her school has even started storing blankets and eatables to cope with sudden emergencies. 

 Swami Vivekanand International School in suburban Kandivali has issued identity cards to parents to allow them to enter the school premises. Our security even keeps a check on people who enter the campus to make sure they do not leave behind any suspicious objects, said principal M. N. Shroff.

 Parents say they welcome such measures, even though some of them described that these were over the top. At the end of the day, it is about the safety of our kids, said Malati Garg, a parent.

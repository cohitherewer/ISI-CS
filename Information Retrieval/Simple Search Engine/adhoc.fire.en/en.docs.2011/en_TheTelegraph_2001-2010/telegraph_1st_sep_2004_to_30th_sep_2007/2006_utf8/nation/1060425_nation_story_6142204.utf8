 Aligarh varsity gets a breather 

 - Minority status stays, quota on hold

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 The main gate of Aligarh Muslim University

 New Delhi, April 24: The Supreme Court has restored for the time being the minority status of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) but made it clear that there would be no reservation of seats for Muslim students till further orders. 

 The interim relief was granted by a bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan while admitting petitions challenging an Allahabad High Court order. The high court had set aside the AMUs minority status and ruled as unconstitutional reservation of half the seats for Muslims. 

 After hearing brief arguments on both sides, the court ordered that the character of the university should be maintained as on the date of the filing of the writ petition before the high court and referred the petitions to the Chief Justice for constituting a Constitution bench to hear the case. 

 Earlier, both the Centre and the AMU sought a stay on the January 5 order by the high court on the condition that 50 per cent quota for Muslim students would not be implemented till a final judgment is delivered.

 Though the court specifically declined to stay the order, the status quo order virtually placed the university in the same position as it was before the high court judgment.

 On reservation of seats for Muslim students, the court recorded the statement by the Centre and the university, which sought to keep the matter in abeyance. 

 Besides the university, the AMU Old Boys Association had also moved court.

 The high court judgment had held that the AMU was not a minority institution entitled to protection under Article 30 (1) of the Constitution and hence reservation of seats for Muslims was unconstitutional.

 On the high court striking down the provision in the Aligarh Muslim University (Amendment) Act, 1981, the university said the constitutional validity of the act was not an issue before the court.

 The legislative competence of Parliament to frame laws for the AMU was not an issue raised by any party in the petitions before the court. 

 Former attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee, appearing for the AMU, said the matter was within the legislative competence of Parliament. Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam said the 1981 Act had just clarified the position enjoyed by the university since 1917.

 Reacting to the order, AMU vice-chancellor Naseem Ahmed said the university will now get a fair chance to prove its claims before a Constitution bench. 

 He told reporters in Aligarh that todays interim order marks a major victory for us and has vindicated our stand on the need to review the 1968 Supreme Court verdict in the S. Aziz Basha case. The court had held that as the AMU was established by a central act, the Muslim minority cannot claim to administer it.

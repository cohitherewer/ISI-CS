 Chidambaram: On track

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said minority stake sales in profit-making state firms were on track.

 I have said this earlier and I am saying this again that divestment is on track, Chidambaram told reporters after a meeting with Left leaders.

 Earlier this month, at a meeting with the Congress, leaders of the Left parties had indicated they may not go along with plans to sell small stakes through public offerings in non-navratna profit-making companies. 

 The Left had last year made it clear that stake sales in navratna companies like Bhel and Indian Oil would not be allowed. But it had adopted a more conciliatory stand on other profitable PSUs, stating that such firms would be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 

 However, objections by smaller Left parties had placed a question mark on the stake sale in some 15 PSUs identified by Chidambaram. The companies included NMDC, Neyveli Lignite and Power Finance. 

 Officials said Chidambarams statement should be considered as an indication that things have progressed and Left concerns would be addressed without the stake sale being put off. 

 Chidambaram said he would take on board alternative Left suggestions to mobilise resources for social sector schemes.

 This stems from the finance ministers earlier assertion that divestment was necessary as 75 per cent of the proceeds would go to fund social sector projects in education, health and employment.

 I will hold a separate meeting with the Left parties to discuss the suggestions in their note in greater detail, the minister said. The note had mooted higher taxes on cars, malls, discos and security transactions. 

 Bush row

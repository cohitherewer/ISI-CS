 Drive against wakf squatters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The minority affairs ministry has started work on an amendment to the Wakf Act aimed at bringing state wakf boards under central supervision and clearing encroachments from wakf properties worth thousands of crores.

 The move, which may appear to be the first step towards implementing the Sachar Committees recommendations, was disclosed by minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay today at a conference of Dalits and minorities.

 Over two-thirds of the wakf properties have been encroached either by private persons or by the state governments or their agencies. If all the wakf properties are put to efficient use, they can generate a significant part of the funds needed for the uplift of the poorer sections of the community, Antulay said.

 Apart from strengthening the Central Wakf Council, the proposed amendment is also likely to effect massive revamp of the state wakf boards.

 The Sachar Committees report had pointed out rampant encroachment by the state governments the custodians of the wakf properties. It had also stated that the management of state wakf boards was unsatisfactory.

 The panel had advocated stricter monitoring of wakf management in general and the vacation of the encroachments in particular and had also called for empowering the Central Wakf Council.

 The market value of the wakf properties can be put at Rs 1.2 lakh crore. If these are put to efficient and marketable use, they can generate returns of at least 10 per cent, which is about Rs 12,000 crore per annum, the report had said.

 Sources in the ministry said the proposed amendment is likely to be introduced in the Budget session of Parliament.

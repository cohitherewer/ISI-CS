 Cheating charge slapped on Monica 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Monica: Good girl?

 Hyderabad, April 4: The Central Bureau of Investigation has framed charges against gangster Abu Salems companion Monica Bedi.

 CBI designated judge P.V. Subramanyam admitted the chargesheet filed by bureau counsel T. Venkatramana and extended the former actresss judicial custody till April 18.

 Monica and Salem were arrested in Portugal two years ago and extradited to India last November.

 She was brought to the Andhra capital to face trial in a forged passport case pending against her since 2001 and has been in the all-women Chanchalguda jail for the last five months.

 The CBI has charged Monica under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating) and 120 B (conspiracy against the country) and under Section 12 of the Passport Act.

 After she was taken into CBI custody, Monica had announced that she was never married to Salem. 

 I am an unmarried and single person and was never married to Abu Salem, she had declared in the presence of Justice Subramanyam.

 Asked to write some sentences for verification of her signature on the passport applications, she wrote: Monica Bedi is a good girl.

 Salem joint trial plea

 Abu Salem today appeared before a Tada court and pleaded that he be tried together with the 123 other accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts case, one of whom is actor Sanjay Dutt. 

 The court has deferred the matter till April 12, adds our special correspondent in Mumbai.

 Earlier, the CBI had submitted a petition in the same Tada (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act) court seeking a separate trial for the gangster. It argued that clubbing his trial with that of the other accused may delay the verdict.

 The designated court has been hearing the blasts case since 1995 and is believed to have been on the verge of delivering its verdict when Salem was extradited from Portugal last November.

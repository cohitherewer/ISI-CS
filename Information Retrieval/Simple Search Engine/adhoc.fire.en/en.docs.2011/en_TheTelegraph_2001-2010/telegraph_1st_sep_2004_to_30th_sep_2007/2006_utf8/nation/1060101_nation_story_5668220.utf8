 Phone tap cuffs on Delhi sleuth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: The owner of a detective agency has been arrested in connection with the alleged phone-tapping of Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh. 

 Delhi police had lodged a case of criminal conspiracy and forgery after Mulayam Singh Yadav yesterday charged Congress president Sonia Gandhi with ordering the tapping of phones of Samajwadi Party leaders.

 Joint commissioner (special cell) Karnail Singh today said Bhupendra, the owner of a detective agency in south Delhi, has been picked up.

 We have taken him in five days police custody and he is being questioned right now. I can tell you this much that with his arrest, the case is as good as solved, Karnail Singh said, adding that he could not divulge more as that could hamper investigations.

 But a PTI report claimed that Bhupendra was allegedly tapping Amar Singhs phone for the past two-and-a half months at the behest of a person who used the polices name.

 The Samajwadi Party has demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe into the tapping case.

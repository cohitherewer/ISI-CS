 Left vents frustration

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The chill was palpable but it has not reached freezing point yet.

 The Left and the UPA leadership met today for 90 minutes, disagreeing on several issues but agreeing on meet again and dropping suggestions that the central coalition was not in any immediate danger of being pushed out of power.

 We conveyed our deep concern at the way the government has gone ahead with certain important policy decisions (Iran and airport modernisation), CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.

 The government is not too happy with the Lefts resolve to push for a debate in Parliament on Iran before the International Atomic Energy Agency meets on March 6 to decide whether Iran should be referred to the Security Council for punitive measures over its controversial nuclear programme. India has already voted with the West for a preliminary move to report Iran to the UN.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the Left leaders that the government would have to respond on the floor of Parliament and requested them not to give the debate a communal tinge.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee wanted to know under which rule the debate would take place. The Left has opted for rule 193, which does not entail voting.

 A joint press conference was dispensed with after todays meeting. But finance minister P. Chidambaram said: The Left leaders have made it clear that they are not contemplating either moving or joining anything resembling a no-confidence motion.

 Talk of a third front is in the air but it does not look feasible at the moment. 

 The Congress leadership, however, wanted to know from the Left how it plans to co-ordinate with Mulayam Singh Yadav. 

 We have told the government that we shall work with non-BJP parties in and outside Parliament to focus on foreign and economic policies, said Karat.

 He also told the Prime Minister that the image of the government was getting eroded and the Lefts reputation is being affected because it is keeping the coalition in power.

 The Left leaders said the government was ignoring them on major policy issues. We have submitted 19 written notes to the coordination committee on a whole range of issues. The exercise has not been as fruitful as it should have been, said Karat.

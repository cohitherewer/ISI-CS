 Modi forecast rained out

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 3: The stars havent quite smiled on Narendra Modis efforts to play friend to the farmer.

 A calendar the chief minister distributed to farmers during his krishi rath yatra three months ago predicting day-specific rainfall for specific regions has all but washed away his passion for astrology.

 The krishi calendar was prepared by in-house astrologers of Anand Agriculture University at Modis bidding to help farmers plan crop schedules. And it had forecast a dry spell in Gujarat from July 27-31.

 But the weather gods played havoc with the astrologers as heavy rain buffeted all parts of the state during that period.

 This has resulted in acute embarrassment for Modi, whose penchant for stars and planets and saffron-clad holy men is hardly a secret.

 Expectedly, the rival Congress has grabbed the chance to poke fun at the chief minister. Senior leader Shaktisinh Gohil has even accused him of banking on superstition rather than science to track the monsoon.

 But state agriculture minister Dilip Thakore has risen to his defence. He conceded Modis fixation with astrology is incompatible with his image, but added: Predictions can go wrong. After all, it is only a probability.

 Thakore claimed his teams intention had been good. We never claimed we are making a perfect prediction. The idea was to inform people and collect new data. Thats why we circulated the calendar in each school and panchayat in 18,000 villages.

 Anand Agriculture University vice-chancellor M.C. Varshney, too, defended the calendar. Even the weather departments forecasts often go wrong, he said.

 Varshney claimed the calendar had been prepared on the basis of data gathered over 100 years.

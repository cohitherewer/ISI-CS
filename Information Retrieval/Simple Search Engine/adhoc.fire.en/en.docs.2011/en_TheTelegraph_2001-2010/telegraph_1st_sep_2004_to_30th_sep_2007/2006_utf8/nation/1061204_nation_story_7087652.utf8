 Martin Sheen in a 

 scene from Bobby (below) and in Marrakech 

 Marrakech, Dec. 2: Martin Sheen, one of Hollywoods most distinguished actors who has starred in a controversial film about the gunning down of Robert Kennedy, said yesterday in Marrakech that it should also be possible for Bollywood to tackle equally sensitive subjects such as the assassination of Indira Gandhi or her son, Rajiv.

 It depends on how it is done as long as it does not glorify the act of violence, as long as it exposes it as an evil, I think an artiste has a responsibility to make that choice, asserted Sheen.

 He is among several well- known names the others are Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Anthony Hopkins, Christian Slater, Harry Belafonte and Laurence Fishburne in the cast of Bobby, which examine events in the three months leading to the assassination of the late John F. Kennedys younger brother, Robert, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 6, 1968.

 Bobby is the first of 15 films being shown in competition at the 6th Marrakech Film Festival. 

 Set in a time when America was being torn apart by the Vietnam War, the film invites obvious comparisons with Iraq. The year 1968, when Robert Kennedy, then only 42, seemed poised to win the Democratic Partys nomination for President, was also a period when race relations were on a knife-edge following the assassination of the black civil rights leader, Dr Martin Luther King.

 In fact, Kennedy is projected as Americas last hope, as summed up in a comment from one of the black characters in the film: Now that Dr King is gone, theres no one left but Bobby.

 At a news conference yesterday after the screening of Bobby, Sheen reflected on whether India could also make movies about political assassinations, which were still raw in the public consciousness. And would such movies prove cathartic or reopen wounds still not healed? 

 Sheen, who had played a young American reporter sympathetic to Indias freedom struggle in Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi in 1982, argued that this movie, for example, had bequeathed an entirely positive legacy.

 The assassination of Mahatma Gandhi was presented in the film, Sheen pointed out. One of the most extraordinary aspects of it was that as Gandhi fell, he praised God and forgave his assassin which was a reflection of his whole life.

 He went on: His funeral was an opportunity for a nation to weep for Indias father at Independence. The new generations of Indians had an opportunity to learn about Gandhi in a way they may not have been able to do before in one way because it was done by an Englishman, Sir Richard Attenborough, who directed the film. He gave India an image that the whole world embraced about Gandhi and his mission of non-violence.

 Sheen connected the Mahatmas message with domestic American politics: That same man was very instrumental in changing the lives of some of our leaders, specifically Martin Luther King Junior who had a profound effect on my nation as well.

 In Bobby, which has been directed by Sheens son, Emilio Estevez, the one role not played by an actor is that of Robert Kennedy himself. Instead, contemporary news footage is used very effectively to take viewers back to 1968. 

 The release of Bobby was held back until after the recent mid-term elections in America because the filmmakers, although paying tribute to Kennedy, a Democrat, did not want to be accused of trying to influence the result. 

 They did not want to premiere on Bobby Kennedys 81st birthday which would have been November 20 and they did not want to open on November 22 which was the anniversary of John Kennedys assassination, so they chose November 23.

 Sheen, who portrays an American president in the hugely popular TV series, West Wing, was scathing about the real life George W. Bush: My country has moved from protection to paranoia since 9/11. We have been fed on fear for these past few years and it is only in this last mid-term election that the American people have finally spoken up and thrown their fear aside and said, We want leadership. We dont want any more politics..

 According to Sheen, this film speaks to a time and place and to a man who gave us that message in our lifetime, in our generation. He (the director) has reawakened the echo of that compassionate voice of Robert Kennedy and given it to a new generation of young people.

 Seated next to Sheen was Laurence Fishburne, the black actor better known for roles in such movies as Mission Impossible III. 

 On India, he commented: I have to agree with Mr Sheen. It is entirely dependent on how it is done. In the case of Gandhi, it was about a mans life and, in the case of Bobby, a movie about a group of peoples lives intersecting at this event. It is not about the act of political assassination itself.

 Fishburne said: I hope this film inspires young people, especially young Americans, to demand the kind of leadership that existed in our country when men like Robert Kennedy walked the earth.

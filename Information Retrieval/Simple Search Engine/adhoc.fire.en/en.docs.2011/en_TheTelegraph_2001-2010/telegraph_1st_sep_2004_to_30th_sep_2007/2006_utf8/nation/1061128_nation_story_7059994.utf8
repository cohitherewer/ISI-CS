 Delhi hope for second city airport

 Not big enough 

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Centre may not object to a proposal from the Bengal government for a second airport at Calcutta. 

 However, it is unlikely to accept the recommendation of the UKs Institute of Civil Engineers (ICE) which conducted a study on behalf of the state government for turning the existing airport into a cargo-cum-air taxi hub.

 The study, presented to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee this weekend, says annual passenger traffic at Calcutta airport could increase to 26 million by 2015 from 4 million, including 2 lakh international travellers, now. The study warns the growth would be slower, at 7-8 million, if only the existing airport stays until then.

 We feel the second airport should be used for international and domestic traffic while the existing airport could be used for cargo and domestic air taxi services, said ICEs senior representative in India, S. S. Chakraborty. 

 He has also made presentations to Boeing asking the US company to select Calcutta for a repair and maintenance hub catering to South and Southeast Asia. 

 Civil aviation ministry officials said they were aware of Bengals interest in a second airport, but denied having received a formal request from the state government. 

 We will not object. If the cabinet clears our proposal allowing a second airport to come up within 50 km radius of an existing one, there is little ground for us to object to a second airport at Calcutta, said an official.

 With the Airports Authority of India (AAI) having taken up a Rs 170-crore plan to develop the existing airport in collaboration with Aeroports de Paris, ministry officials said it would be unwise to limit the spanking new Netaji Subhas airport to cargo and air taxi services. 

 Instead, they said they would like the new airport to compete with the existing one, just like Gatwick does with Heathrow in London. 

 Chakraborty has a different view. The existing airport cant be upgraded to the extent needed. The runways cant be widened or lengthened to accommodate the over 4,000 metres required for big planes. Airports draw flights, and not the other way round. 

 Sources said the Bengal government would like the second airport to be developed by a private entrepreneur with the state government and the central government-owned AAI holding stakes. 

 Ministry officials said the cash-rich AAI could agree to the idea as long as the existing airport which it runs is not reduced to handling cargo and domestic air taxi services.

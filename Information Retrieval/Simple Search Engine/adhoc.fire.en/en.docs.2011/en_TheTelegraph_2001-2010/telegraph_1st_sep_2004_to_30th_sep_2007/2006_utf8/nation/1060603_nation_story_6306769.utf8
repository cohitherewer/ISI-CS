 TRAGEDY AFTERMATH

 Guwahati, June 2: As news of Rahul Mahajans illness came in, a pall of gloom descended on the BJPs Assam unit, which was preparing a fitting farewell to his father Pramod Mahajan and Rahuls first public address.

 Rahul was slated to arrive here tomorrow to immerse his fathers ashes in the Brahmaputra, as Pramod, who was the state in-charge of the BJPs campaign during the Assembly elections, had wished.

 The late BJP leaders secretary Bibek Moitra, who died after a party at Pramods house in Delhi late last night, was to accompany Rahul. 

 The BJP said it would go ahead with tomorrows programme but would keep it simple. 

 Mumbai (PTI): Pramod Mahajans brother Prakash Mahajan who lives in Aurangabad rushed to Mumbai on Friday morning and flew to Delhi later, sources said. 

 New Delhi (PTI): Gopinath Munde has said he was told that nephew Rahul and Bibek Moitra felt uneasy after dinner around 2.30 on Friday morning. Bibek, who was suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, died of heart attack around 5, he said, adding that Rahuls condition is improving. Asked if Rahuls mother Rekha has been informed, he said: We have told her that it is a case of food poisoning.

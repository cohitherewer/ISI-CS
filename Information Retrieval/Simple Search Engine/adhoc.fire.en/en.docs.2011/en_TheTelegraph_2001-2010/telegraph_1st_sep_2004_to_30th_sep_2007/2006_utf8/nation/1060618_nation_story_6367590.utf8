 Mika kiss cuffs on hold

 Mumbai, June 17: Mika Singh has been spared the kiss of police handcuffs, at least for now.

 A sessions court today granted Mika anticipatory bail, a week after the Punjabi pop singers very public smooch sent item girl Rakhi Sawant fuming to the cops.

 But his bodyguard Tiger and friend Vikky Sardar were not so lucky. The two were arrested in the molestation case Rakhi had filed, deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta told PTI.

 The bail relief for Mika came a day after the National Commission for Women said it prima facie appeared that Rakhi, whose stage shows in interior Maharashtra were cancelled after protests against her obscene dancing, was sexually assaulted.

 The court also directed Mika, who is the younger brother of singer Daler Mehndi, to be available for police investigations twice a week for a month.

 The kiss ? and Rakhis peck on Mikas cheek before that ? came at Mikas birthday bash last Saturday and both made it to national television. The footage clearly showed Mika embraced her twice.

 This afternoon, the singer appeared in the court of Judge S. Davre for the hearing. Granting anticipatory bail, Judge Davre ordered that in the event of his arrest, he may be released on a cash bail of Rs 20,000 and a surety of the same amount.

 Public prosecutor Ashok Deshmukh opposed Mikas bail plea, saying the police wanted to check the antecedents of the singer and the two other co-accused, his bodyguard and friend.

 Mikas counsel Dipesh Mehta said his client was not absconding and had travelled to Delhi and other places in connection with scheduled shows. He said the singer had more shows in Delhi and would cooperate with the investigations.

 The judge then directed Mika to report to the police on Monday and Wednesday every week for a month.

 Davre also asked Mika not to leave the country without permission from an appropriate court.

 Earlier, after Mika had refused to apologise for his behaviour, Rakhi had approached the womens commission in Delhi yesterday.

 The commission members said based on the footage, it appeared that Rakhis complaint of sexual assault had merit.

 It, prima facie, appears to be a case of sexual assault, commission chairperson Girija Vyas said in a statement yesterday.

 The commission then summoned Mika to appear for a hearing on June 19.

 But Mikas lawyer Mehta said they had not yet received summons from the commission so far.

 Speaking to reporters outside the court today, Mika ruled out striking any compromise with Rakhi and said he would not apologise.

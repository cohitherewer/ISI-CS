 Manipur activist killed

 KHELEN THOKCHOM

 Imphal, June 28: The leader of a Manipuri womens group that has been campaigning against alcoholism, drug abuse and army excesses was kidnapped last night and shot in the head, allegedly by members of a militant outfit.

 The body of Takhellambam Menaka Devi, 30, was found by a village search party around 1.30 last night just a kilometre from her house at Wangoo Terakhok in Bishenpur district. Four gunmen had kidnapped her a few hours earlier.

 The police, who found two empty AK-47 cartridges at the spot, blamed a major militant group. 

 The anti-army agitation by Manipuri women two years ago ? a dozen of them had disrobed in front of the erstwhile Assam Rifles base in Imphal and cried Come and rape us ? may not have been far from their minds when Menaka Devis colleagues quickly organised a rally and demanded the arrest of the culprits.

 Menaka, a mother of two, was secretary of the Wangoo Lupa Marup Meira Paibi Lup, a group that mobilises women for various campaigns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Nation at a Glance

 Bengal moves HC with BEd plea

 Calcutta: The submission 

 comes in the wake of a division bench order asking several 

 colleges affiliated to North Bengal University to suspend 

 classes till the council gives its clearance. If the 

 government is asked to follow the order, the future of 5,000 

 students under four other universities will also be in the 

 dark, Ray said.

 About 30 BEd colleges under Calcutta, Burdwan, Kalyani and Vidyasagar universities run courses without the councils approval. Examinations are approaching for students who have completed one year in these institutions.

 The state, Ray added, has written to Delhi seeking changes in rules to allow colleges to offer the courses without the central permit.

 Salman witnesses vanish

 Mumbai: Efforts are being 

 made to trace them, the prosecution informed the trial court 

 on Thursday. The witnesses were not available at their homes 

 and have perhaps shifted elsewhere, the prosecutor said.

 The four witnesses are considered crucial to the prosecutions case as they were injured by the actor when he allegedly rammed his car into a bakery on September 28, 2002. 

 Visa fraud

 Moga: Surinder Singh went 

 to Canada in 2004 after procuring a visa from 

 agent Paramjit Singh, police said. But on arrival in Canada, 

 Surinder was arrested for travelling on a fake visa.

 Tainted cops 

 Srinagar (PTI): The superintendents 

 of police of Baramulla and Kupwara, Ashkoor Wani and Sunil 

 Dutt, respectively, have been taken off active duty and 

 attached to the offices of their superiors for alleged involvement 

 in a sex racket.

 Tiffin box blast

 Ahmedabad (PTI): An anti-terror 

 court has sentenced five persons to 10 years rigorous 

 imprisonment in the 2002 tiffin bomb blasts 

 in the city. The court, however, acquitted 12 other accused 

 for want of sufficient evidence.

 The sea version of the indigenously developed pilotless aircraft, Lakshya, has been successfully tested over the Bay of Bengal near Orissa. It is used as a target for air defence systems.

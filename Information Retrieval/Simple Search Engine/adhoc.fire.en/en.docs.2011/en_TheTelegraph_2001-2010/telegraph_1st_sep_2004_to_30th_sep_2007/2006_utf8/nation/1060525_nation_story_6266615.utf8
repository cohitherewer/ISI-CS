 Siachen talks die early

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: The tenth round of talks on Siachen between India and Pakistan actually died a few hours before its scheduled end today with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee announcing that the jaw-jaw was futile though the officials were still at it.

 The announcement came as a surprise because the defence secretaries of the two countries and their delegations were still closeted in room No. 102 in defence headquarters, South Block, apparently trying to hammer out a solution.

 Had the failure of the talks not been a foregone conclusion, Mukherjees premature announcement might have ranked as a huge diplomatic gaffe. As it were, his utterances at a function in the headquarters of the National Cadet Corps in the morning emphasised the pointlessness of the talks. 

 You know this (Siachen) is one of the perennial problems, the defence minister began when asked about the talks. 

 For quite some time we are discussing.... On principle, it has been agreed that both sides will withdraw from their existing position. 

 But we want that before the process of withdrawal and deployment (of troops) at the designated places start, the existing places before vacation should be delineated, authenticated in a document signed and agreed by both sides... Perhaps there can be upward movement in another round of talks. Presently, we could not make any breakthrough... Mukherjee said.

 The two sides did come up with a joint press release for the record. It said there will be talks again and that the two countries had decided to continue with the ceasefire that began in November 2003.

 The view put forward by Indias defence secretary, Shekhar Dutt, that no pullback of troops before the verification of the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL), was strengthened when army headquarters convinced the political leadership last week that Siachen was a sustainable holding operation so long as the ceasefire continued. 

 This meant, the army had explained that Siachen was not haemorrhaging the Indian military machine any longer. In more than two decades of the strife, the army and the air force had evolved systems that were functioning well and with the ceasefire in place even casualties were at their lowest.

 The loss at the negotiating table is interpreted as a victory beyond the confines of diplomatic parleys. 

 For a while ? especially since Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to the base camp at the glacier last June ? the military brass was wondering if the political pressure to strike a deal on Siachen would mount. 

 The Prime Minister had talked of a peace mountain and there were suggestions that he will take a mountain rose as a gift on his proposed visit to Islamabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Fifth-time CM, but with a thorn

 M.R. VENKATESH

Chennai, May 11: As Jayalalithaa sent the resignation of her council of ministers to governor S.S. Barnala this evening, fifth time chief minister-in-waiting M. Karunanidhi wasnt exactly smiling.

 With a majority eluding his party, the DMK leader faces the prospect of an arrangement he is keen to avoid: a coalition government.

 The state hasnt seen one in the 54 years since the Congress, led by the late C. Rajagopalachari, tied up with a few small parties after the 1952 polls.

 The DMK has 96 seats, 22 short of the majority mark of 118. The Congress, the second-largest group in the six-party Democratic Progressive Alliance with 34 seats, hasnt decided if it wants to join the government.

 If it does, Karunanidhi ? whose party is part of the ruling coalition at the Centre ? will be in a fix.

 A coalition government would not work in Tamil Nadu even if the DMK is to lead it, a DMK source told The Telegraph.

 The model in Pondicherry ? where the Congress under Rangaswamy retained power today as part of an alliance including the DMK, PMK and CPI ? will not suit Tamil Nadu, he said.

 Karunanidhi had reason to feel partly relieved this evening as the CPI and the CPM, which have between them won 15 seats, sent letters to the governor expressing support from outside to a DMK government.

 The PMK, with its 18 MLAs, has also said it would back the DMK from outside, but hasnt yet written to the governor.

 A senior state Congress leader said his colleagues in Tamil Nadu want to join the government, and a decision is likely to be taken by the partys central leadership tomorrow. The last time the Congress sat on the treasury benches was in 1967, when it lost power to the DMK.

 Karunanidhi was non-committal on a coalition ministry as he addressed a huge news conference today.

 I will consult the leaders of all our DPA allies before deciding on the form of the new government, he said.

 It is expected that M.K. Stalin, the DMKs youth wing leader and Karunanidhis son, will be made deputy chief minister, but party sources declined to comment on this.

 The PMK was licking its wounds, reflecting on how actor Vijaykants party had eaten into its votes in the northern belt. Vijaykants own victory in Viruddhachalam against the sitting PMK lawmaker has been a blow to PMK chief S. Ramadoss.

 Karunanidhi today promised to uphold the rule of law and not be deliberately vindictive. He stressed that all the promises in the party manifesto would be honoured, but in phases.

 The DMK chief said he wanted a cordial relationship with the Opposition. 

 But MDMK leader Vaiko, who profusely thanked Jayalalithaa for making it possible for his party to open its account in the Assembly this time, said: We have lost the battle, not the war. The war will continue.

 Karunanidhi said the statue of the Tamil icon of chastity, Kannagi, removed by the Jayalalithaa regime from the Marina Beach, will be reinstated.

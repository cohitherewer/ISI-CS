The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Subhas wants Zizou in Calcutta

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 10: The 

 worlds best footballer will light up a patch of Calcuttas 

 soccer turf if Subhas Chakraborty can finally match his 

 action to his words.

 The sports minister today told the Assembly he was trying to bring Zinedine Zidane and some of his Les Bleus team-mates to play a friendship match in the city.

 Chakraborty has time and again promised, and failed, to bring international football stars ? including Zidane and Diego Maradona ?to play in the city. But unlike the previous occasions, he is now talking of a player who has quit professional soccer.

 Pele had indeed played in Calcutta with his New York Cosmos team-mates in 1977, six years after his retirement from top-notch football.

 I have had a talk with French consulate officials in New Delhi about Zidanes visit to the city. They have promised to try their best, Chakraborty said.

 Sports department officials said the chances were brighter this time because Zidane is likely to visit Dhaka in November ? though not to play. The three-time Fifa World Footballer of the Year has been invited by Mohammad Yunus, who pioneered micro-credit in agriculture, to inaugurate a factory in Bogura.

 Both the Treasury and Opposition benches greeted the announcement by thumping their desks, but the minister couldnt specify the date of the match.

 Even Chakrabortys aides had their doubts, but the minister explained his past failures away by blaming them on international rules governing football tours.

 It involves a lot of fact- ors, like clearance from the countries concerned, huge expenses, security and, above all, sponsorship. I honestly tried to bring Zidane, Maradona and Pele (after 1977) but my efforts didnt bear fruit for one reason or the other, he said. This time I hope I shall be successful. I shall leave no stone unturned to turn my dream into reality.

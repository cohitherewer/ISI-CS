 Rape case trumped up: Barnala

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Aug. 20: Tamil Nadu governor Surjit Singh Barnala, whose son Gaganjit is in custody in a rape case, has termed the allegation totally false.

 Insisting that his son is innocent, Barnala, who was in Chandigarh, en route to Longowal village to observe the 21st death anniversary of Harchand Singh Longowal today, told The Telegraph that he hoped the investi-gation would be free and fair.

 Gaganjit, the Shiromani Akali Dal MLA from Punjabs Dhuri, has been accused of raping his domestic help while she was massaging him. 

 If I say anything more at this stage, it will amount to interference in the investigation. The matter has pained the family deeply and it is a false case. Let the investigation proceed freely. This is a dukh ki ghadi (hour of grief) for all of us, he said.

 The governor said he had called Union territory of Chandigarh administrator and Punjab governor S.F. Rodrigues and had discussed the matter with him. I met the governor on a courtesy call. He assured me that the investigation into the case would be fair, Barnala, a former chief minister, said.

 Family sources claimed that the masseuse who had charged Gaganjit with rape on August 12 had worked for a political foe earlier before joining the Barnalas.

 She worked for a political rival whose name will come out soon, a relative said.

 Gaganjit is in judicial custody till August 28. The bail application filed in additional district and sessions judge R.S. Baswanas court here on his behalf by advocate A.S. Sukheja was withdrawn yesterday after the prosecution submitted that investigations were not complete as the DNA and other reports would take another 10 days to come.

 We accepted the prosecutions plea and have decided to move a fresh bail plea at the appropriate time, Sukheja said.

 While arguing in court yesterday, Sukheja questioned why the complainant had not cried for help or told Gaganjits wife Harpreet what had happened as she was present at home.

 Sukheja claimed that with Assembly elections slated for early next year and Gaganjit expected to contest again, a conspiracy had been hatched to implicate him in the scandal.

 The defence counsel said the alleged victim had been making contradictory statements. There is no bed in the place where she has claimed that she was raped, he said.

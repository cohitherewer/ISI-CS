 Dal-roti for lunch, don as neighbour

Mumbai, March 24: Prison is a great leveller. Or so it seems for rape-accused textile scion Abhishek Kasliwal.

 Cooped up in a cell of the feared Anda Barrack of Mumbais Arthur Road Jail, Abhishek gets roti, dal and sabzi for meals ? standard fare for all inmates.

 Breakfast is either upma or poha, followed by a lunch of three chapatis, dal and vegetables. Dinner comprises two chapatis and a cup-sized mound of rice. He is not allowed food from home, a jail source said.

 The 27-year-olds cell is well lit, but has no fan or TV. Like other inmates, he has his meals in his cell. The barrack is guarded round the clock by 10 policemen ? five inside and five outside.

 Accused of raping a 52-year-old woman in his Mercedes on the Sriram Mills premises, Abhishek has underworld celebs for neighbours ? Dawood Ibrahims brother Iqbal Kaskar, Chota Rajan aide D.K. Rao and extradited gangster Abu Salem.

 Jail sources said Abhisheks cell is in yard number two of the barrack, where he is lodged along with some 30 suspects in the Bilkis Bano gangrape case.

 Kaskar, in yard one, is his immediate neighbour, followed by gangsters D.K. Rao, Vicky Malhotra, Farid Tanasha and other Chhota Rajan gangsters in yard three. Salem is in yard four.

 Last afternoon, Abhishek was paraded in the jail along with three burqa-clad look-alikes. The rape victim, two witnesses and watchman Gattu of Sriram Mills, owned by Abhisheks family, identified him.

 No family member, apart from father Ambuj Kasliwal, has visited him in jail.

 I met Abhishek after his arrest, thanks to a magistrate who allowed me and my lawyer to meet him. As for what he has told us, we will disclose that later. It would not be appropriate to disclose our defence at this stage. All I can say is that he is being framed, Ambuj said.

 A family friend and high-profile Mumbai socialite said: Its going to be a long haul, it seems. The family is very depressed, but is putting up a brave front. The boy has always created problems for the family with his wayward acts.

 Sources in Mumbai police said Abhishek conceded during lie-detector tests in Bangalore that he did pick up the woman in the wee hours of March 11. But other tests threw up holes in his claim that he had consensual sex with her.

 He was dodgy on the question, 

 but the brain-mapping and polygraph tests conducted by the 

 Bangalore Forensic Sciences Laboratory indicate this is 

 probably a lie, a source said. The brain-mapping 

 test ? where Kasliwal was shown photographs of his accuser 

 and provided cues regarding the incident ? revealed he was 

 concealing information on the alleged crime.

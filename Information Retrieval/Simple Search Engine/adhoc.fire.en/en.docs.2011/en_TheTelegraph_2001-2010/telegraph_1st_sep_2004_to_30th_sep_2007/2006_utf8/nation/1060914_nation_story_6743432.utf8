 New Delhi, Sept. 13: All 

 you people who sniggered when Amitabh Bachchan was advertising 

 for Parker, its time to eat crow: the pen is not as 

 puny or as much of a walkover as you think.

 You might have given up writing letters to your loved ones because emailing and texting are fashionable and faster; the typewriter might have been killed off by the computer; but the pen has proudly held its own in the age of digital revolution.

 According to a study released today, pen sales in India have registered a phenomenal 82 per cent growth between July 2005 and April this year, riding the wave of an exponential retail market expansion.

 The product is on sale in about 11 lakh stores across urban India, which represents a distribution growth of 23 per cent during the period, the study by global research firm AC Nielsen said.

 The sales peaked in February and March because of the exam season, the report said. This was further spurred by competitive pricing and product innovation.

 There is a consistent month-on-month growth in the writing instruments industry fuelled by competitive pricing and product innovation. Today, one can buy a gel pen for Rs 2 and can choose from a wide variety of pens easy grip to waterproof ink, AC Nielsen associate director, client services, Anmol Sherpa, said.

 The pen market had earlier suffered from lack of organised information on market size or market shares of players as most were not listed companies and distribution was mostly limited to stationery stores, he said. But this was no longer the case.

 Pooja Jain, director, Luxor writing instruments, said: Against popular perception, the pen industry is growing between 35-40 per cent annually. This is essentially in the mass segment Rs 2-10 category. The Rs 50 and above category has also shown growth of 30-35 per cent.

 Increase in purchasing power of the rural sector and emphasis on education has lent an enormous helping hand.

 According to the survey, ballpoint pens constitute the biggest chunk of the market, accounting for 72 per cent. Gel pens follow at 28 per cent. Cello, GM pens, Gigneswar, Linc and Add are the top five players in this segment.

 In the marker pens segment, the top five are GM, Luxor, Stic, Camlin and Faber-Castell. Segments like whiteboard, CD marker or permanent marker have shown positive month-on-month volume and value growth in April.

 The positive outlook of the industry is evident from the amount of air time booked by almost all key players on prime time television, Sherpa said.

 The report said despite the domination by Cello and GM, there was still space and scope for smaller players in the market. Lexi, Agni and Elkos have managed to maintain their share on a regional level or in select pockets.

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Two days after witnessing clashes over the municipal corporations sealing drive, east Delhi is still reeling from the images of innocent children falling to police firing and the apparent apathy of the government to the protesting traders plight.

 A pool of blood marks the spot where 14-year-old Ashraf died. His brother Kalaam points out tell-tale bullet marks on the nearby wall.

 The bullets snuffed out life from three children and a trader in Seelampur.

 Inside Ashrafs house, his name written boldly in red on a wall, his mother Shahida Bano remains inconsolable. He wanted to be a doctor. He was brilliant at studies. And this happened on his way back from school. Now, who will take care of me when I become old? she wails. Her husband, Mohammed Islam, tries to comfort her, reminding her that she has high blood pressure.

 Ashrafs brother Aslam, 17, a Class XII student, holds his biology book in his hand he has exams next week.

 I dont think I want to go to school. Im scared, he tells his family. His school is in Shahadra, 4 km away, but he says: What happened on Wednesday can happen again. Im really scared.

 No one from the Delhi government has visited the area leave alone the victims families since the firing. The lack of a visible administration is leaving the pot boiling, threatening a spill-over again.

 Chief minister Sheila Dixit, who wanted to visit the site of the clash on Wednesday, was advised against going there. 

 Why has no one else come? is the common refrain here.

 Kalaam, Shahidas eldest son, takes us to Ashrafs school, less than 200 m from where the firing took place.

 The Government Boys Middle School is empty on a Friday, but for two children playing badminton. Other children and parents in Seelampur confirm Aslams fear. The large BSF presence in the area, instead of giving a sense of security, seems to be adding to the tension.

 The traders are still protesting. The BSF is still here. Another shootout can happen any time, says Mohsin Kamaal, father of 12-year-old Wasim. Mohsin says his son will not go to school till everything settles down.

 It isnt just schools in Seelampur that have been affected, though. In Shahadra and Welcome, the Delhi Assembly constituencies adjacent to Seelampur, the situation is no different.

 Many private schools have decided to close down while government schools are spending an hour a day counselling the children.

 Manjulatha Ray, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Dilshad Garden beyond Shahadra says teachers have been counselling students not to leave the school premises except in the school bus.

 The boys died as they had gone to see what the commotion was about. We are telling all our children that they should go back home after school and should take all precautions.

 Attendance has thinned to one in every 10 students, she adds. 

 If the situation continues, we will have to go from house to house persuading parents to make their children come to school, says Ray.

 Local MLA Chaudhary Matin Ahmed of the Congress in his solitary visit to the locality since Wednesday promised a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the dead and Rs 50,000 for the injured.

 For Shahida and Islam, the compensation holds no meaning. What we want is the guilty to be punished. Nothing less, nothing more, says Islam.

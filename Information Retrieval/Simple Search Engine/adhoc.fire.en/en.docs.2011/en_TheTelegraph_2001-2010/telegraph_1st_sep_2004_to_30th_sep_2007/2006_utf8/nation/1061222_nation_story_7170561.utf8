 Councillor 

convicted

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: A former city councillor was today convicted of the kidnap and murder of a colleague four years ago in a case that also snared three policemen for destruction of evidence.

 Sharda Jain, who was a municipal councillor from north-west Delhis Keshavpuram, was found guilty by a trial court of killing Atma Ram Gupta, a fellow Congress member.

 The three policemen, from Uttar Pradesh, were found guilty of helping Sharda and her accomplices dispose of the body in a gutter near a canal in Bulandshahr, where it was eventually found.

 Believed to have been in a relationship with the victim, Sharda, the prosecution claimed, flew into a rage when she discovered that he was also involved with another councillor, Memwati Barwala, also from the Congress. Then she hired assassins to kill Gupta.

 Dismissing pleas of innocence from the accused, additional sessions judge Bharat Prashar said: The chain of circumstantial evidence in this case is complete and is inconsistent and incompatible with the innocence of the accused.

 Assisted by her brother Raj Kumar Jain also convicted of kidnap and murder Jain, the prosecution said, plotted to convince Gupta to accompany her after a Congress rally on August 24, 2002.

 Her driver Rajender then drove them to the western Uttar Pradesh village of Chajjupur where two hired assassins, Pushpender and Nirvakar, are believed to have killed Gupta.

 The driver, the hit-men and the village sarpanch, Roshan Singh who the court said had assisted in hiring the killers have also been convicted.

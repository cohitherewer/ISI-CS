 Partys voice looks at future in govt

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Singhvi: Great asset

 New Delhi, April 4: He is the Congresss newest entrant into the Rajya Sabha but if hints and indications are anything to go by, Abhishek Manu Singhvi looks headed for a great future.

 Take it from me, in six months he will be out of the party and into the government, a Congress functionary said off the record.

 The rise and rise of the lawyer who started frequenting 24 Akbar Road after Madhavrao Scindias death ? he was close to him ? has stumped old-timers who have given up hope of making it big in the UPA government.

 Singhvi was in the news for two reasons: one, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha from the lone seat in the Congress quota in Rajasthan, beating veteran industrialist and party loyalist R.P. Goenka. Even Archana Dalmia, a Congress secretary close to Sonia Gandhi, tried and failed.

 Then, a day after his election, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh released Singhvis book Candid Corner from his 7 Race Course Road residence. Singh also described him as a great asset to the Rajya Sabha.

 Abhishek has been an active member of our party, but more importantly he has been an active member of the civil society of our national capital. As a concerned and involved citizen, he has championed many worthwhile causes and he deserves our gratitude for all this, the Prime Minister said.

 I am delighted that he has now entered the Rajya Sabha and I am sure he will contribute enormously to a more informed debate on vital issues concerning our polity, our economy and our society.

 The icing on the cake was the foreword the Prime Minister wrote for the book.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who was present on the dais, wondered how long it would be before Singhvi crosses over from the party to the treasury benches. Singhvi replied: It is a great honour for me to serve the Congress. I enjoy what I am doing.

 As of now, Singhvi is a party spokesperson in a panel that includes Jayanthi Natarajan and Rajeev Shukla. If he does cross over to government, he will be the ninth person to do so.

 Since the UPA came to power, the Congress has lost most of its spokespersons and individuals connected with its media cell to the government. They include Pranab Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil and Ambika Soni, all of whom chaired its media cells; and S. Jaipal Reddy, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Kapil Sibal, Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Kumari Selja who served as spokespersons.

 What is it that draws spokespersons to the government like a magnet? Sources said there was no cogent answer, except that being in media glare day after day and doing a reasonably good job of defending the Congress gave them a decisive edge over low-key aspirants.

 The sources said that in the process the party was losing its advocates. Although Ambika continued to head the media cell after becoming minister, the post had become notional as she was not able to give it much time.

 Besides, being part of the government, she could not take a stand on certain issues, the sources said.

 Congress general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi was slated to replace her but a section has opposed his rise.

 This section has warned Singhvi not to fly too high. After all, Sonia refused to attend his book release and made it clear 10 Janpath should not be used for such things.

 Sonia attends book releases sparingly. The last was at the Nehru Memorial Library in 2004 for a book she herself edited called Two Alone, Two Together: Letters between Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, 1922-1964.

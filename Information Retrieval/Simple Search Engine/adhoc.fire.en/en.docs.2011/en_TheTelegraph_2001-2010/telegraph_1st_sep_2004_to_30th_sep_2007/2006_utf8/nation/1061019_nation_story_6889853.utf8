 Green signal to five-year visas

 Soni: Not satisfied

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: India is set to introduce a five-year multiple-entry visa for visitors from some countries, tourism minister Ambika Soni said today.

 Her ministry has been lobbying for more visa on arrival for travellers from 16 countries. But the home ministry has vetoed that proposal citing security concerns.

 Addressing a news conference, Soni said both the home and foreign ministries have agreed in principal to long-term visas.

 Officials said the five-year multiple-entry visa facility is likely to be extended to visitors from 16 countries and others who offer a similar concession to Indians.

 Although its visa-on-arrival proposal has been shot down at least for now the ministry feels a step has been taken in that direction with the implementation of the advance passenger information system for all Delhi-bound Air-India flights. The system helps in security clearances and could pave the way for visa on arrival.

 The ministry is also lobbying for relaxing travel permits, which restrict travel to remote parts of the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir.

 The focus of the news conference was the launch of a bed-and-breakfast scheme to meet the shortage of tourist accommodation, particularly in Delhi. 

 The scheme has been tried before, though without much success. 

 The ministry feels there is a looming accommodation crisis. For the Commonwealth Games in 2010, Delhi will need about 50,000 budget-priced rooms.

 The ministry has announced the Incredible India Bed amp; Breakfast Establishments scheme, which will kick off in the capital. Residents can offer up to five rooms or 10 beds to tourists in their homes, provided they meet the standards laid down by the ministry.

 Soni said the scheme would empower housewives, allowing them an income of their own.

 She also released a list of basic minimum standards for adventure tourism. 

 The ministry has decided to set up an accreditation committee to ensure that adventure tour operators follow safety and other standards.

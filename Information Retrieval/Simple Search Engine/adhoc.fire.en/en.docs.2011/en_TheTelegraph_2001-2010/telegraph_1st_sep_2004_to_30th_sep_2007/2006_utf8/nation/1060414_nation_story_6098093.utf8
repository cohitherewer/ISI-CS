 No retest, doctors hit discos

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 13: Aspiring postgraduate medical students thronged discos and restaurants this evening after the Centre decided not to cancel the All India Post Graduate Medical Entrance Examination.

 The government said in the interest of justice it would not go ahead with its earlier decision to scrap the test because some students had resorted to unfair means.

 The decision to conduct a re-examination on May 21 had come after 20 students were found cheating in a Chennai centre.

 The decision was taken because of the likelihood that many more students could have been involved in the malpractice. It was a painful decision taken in larger public interest, additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam had said.

 Today, in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, the Centre said preliminary investigations pointed towards the involvement of very few students in cheating.

 Subramaniam said counselling for admissions would start on April 21 after a fresh list is drawn, excluding the 20 who had allegedly resorted to unfair means.

 The approval of the proposal by a bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan lifted the suspense over the fate of about 4,000 students who had cleared the examination conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.

 Some of the successful candidates, who waited anxiously for the outcome of the court proceedings on their petition against cancellation of the test, expressed happiness over the government giving in to their demands.

 Dr Suchi Maheshwari said she was happy with the decision but there was a need to rethink the process of examination. It is not our job to ensure foolproof examination, she said. Even after a good performance in the examination, we had to move court for no fault of ours.

 Dr Anil Kumar said it was strange that the government had decided to punish 38,000 people for the fault of 20. Why should we be made to worry about a question paper leak?

 But all is well that ends well, he said.

 In New Delhi, Dr Manpreet Singh Anand and the petitioners congregated at a restaurant for an evening of merriment.

 Those on the merit list are expected to arrive for counselling in New Delhi on April 21, a process during which they will be allotted MD courses according to their preferences and ranks. Anand is looking forward to an MD in radiotherapy.

 On April 3, the court ? apparently not satisfied with the decision to cancel the examination ? had asked the government to reconsider its decision. Calling for a further probe into the matter, the court had pointed out that the examination could not be cancelled unless it was established that besides Chennai, students at other centres also received answers on their mobiles.

 Subramaniam said there would be no fresh examination but more students from the merit list, besides the 20, could be barred if the CBI found evidence against them. To prevent incidents of cheating in future, there would be mandatory frisking of students by police or paramilitary forces at examination centres, he added.

 Counselling sessions would be held from April 21 to May 8 and admissions will close on June 30.

 With 12 students from the merit list opposing the move, the court had directed a probe before a decision was taken.

NATION BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: In the wake of Sundays landmine blast at Belpahari that killed four policemen, the Bengal government decided to abolish small police outposts in the remote areas of Maoist-hit districts of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore today. 

 Officials said the decision was taken as such camps arent fully equipped to counter any planned Maoist attacks. Public relations exercises like setting up of medical camps will also remain suspended. 

 Calcutta: Twenty Election Commission observers will tour 19 districts of Bengal from Wednesday on their third visit to hear voters complaints and review election preparations. They will return to Delhi to attend a poll panel meeting on March 9.

 New Delhi: An NGO has moved the Supreme Court, seeking a ban on the Hindi film, Chingaari, on the ground that it hurt sentiments of Hindus. Sushmita Sen, who plays a prostitute, is compared with Draupadi, and Mithun Chakraborty, who plays a priest, is shown to be a rapist and murderer, it said.

 Srinagar: A picture in a news magazine depicting the holiest mosque Kaaba on playing cards sparked protests in Srinagar on Tuesday. Hundreds of protesters forced shops to close down and stopped traffic in uptown Maisuma and in several downtown areas.

 Sunny gets court clean chit 

 Gavaskar: Relief

 Ahmedabad, May 9 (PTI): A local court today dropped charges against Sunil Gavaskar who was one of the directors of the Vadodara-based footwear company, Topline Shoes Ltd, which had allegedly duped investors.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate H.I. Velani dropped all charges against Gavaskar after his counsels contended that the batting legend had resigned as a board member from the company much before the allegations were raised.

 We had filed an application before the court to remove Gavaskars name from the list of the accused. We had argued earlier that Gavaskar, who was based in Mumbai, was now not associated with the company and had resigned from the companys board... four years prior to the date of offence, Gavaskars counsel S.V. Raju said. Today, the court considered our discharge application (filed a few months back) and dropped the case against Gavaskar.

 The registrar of companies here had filed a case against all the board members of the company in 1999 alleging that the company had duped investors and vanished. 

 Topline also did not file details of its annual general meeting and annual returns for two consecutive years.

 IIT protesters to skip Sonia rally 

 Kanpur (PTI): IIT students opposed to 

 reservation will boycott the rally of Congress chief Sonia 

 Gandhi scheduled to be held here on August 8.

 Omendra and Sudhir, leaders of the Youth for Equality, which had spearheaded the anti-quota agitation, claimed the protest against reservation in higher educational institutions was gaining momentum. 

 Students of IIT Kanpur, GSVM Medical College and several other higher educational institutions have decided to boycott Sonias rally.

 They said their agitation was aimed at convincing the Centre not to increase reservation in higher educational institutions. They are also persuading leaders involved in the agitation against participating in the rally.

 The president of the city Congress committee, Mahesh Dixit, however, said the party will ask the protesters to re-examine their decision. A meeting of a delegation of students will be arranged with Sonia, he said.

 NRI doctors get hearing

 London (PTI): NRI doctors here have been 

 allowed a hearing of their legal challenge against new rules 

 which will prevent non-EU physicians from getting government-funded 

 jobs in the UK. 

 In a statement, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio), which has launched the legal battle, said the department of health and the home office had not followed due procedures such as appropriate consultations and a race equality impact assessment. 

 The case is likely to be heard towards the end of August. Bapio says about 10,000 trainee doctors will have to leave the UK within months, if the rules are enforced.

 Man freed

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A group of villagers 

 allegedly freed an arrested man on Tuesday and injured three 

 police officials at Khelshikapur, police said.

 Family dies

 New Delhi (PTI): A man poisoned his wife 

 and three teenaged daughters, killing two of them, before

 said. 

 Lethal stress

 New Delhi (PTI): A 16-year-old schoolgirl 

 allegedly committed suicide in west Delhi on Tuesday because

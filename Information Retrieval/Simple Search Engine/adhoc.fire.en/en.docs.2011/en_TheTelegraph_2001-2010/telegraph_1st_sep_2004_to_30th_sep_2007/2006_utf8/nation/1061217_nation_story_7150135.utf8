 Wheel-weary techies take to pooling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Zip to work with car mates

 Bangalore, Dec. 16: IT companies have a strange problem on their hands as they watch the falling productivity of employees who report to work early in the day with frayed nerves and taut visages. Its not the work pressure, but something more mundane fatigue at the wheel.

 The click capitals chaotic traffic and incidents of road rage are leaving employees stressed out when they should be starting the day on a cheerful note, say HRD managers.

 But help is on the way for those hit by steering strain. And it comes in the form of car pooling, a concept increasingly becoming popular not only with IT professionals but also with the less-privileged Bangaloreans.

 Driving the revolution is Vipul Kasera, who got fed up with threading his way to work in rush-hour traffic. Hes been pooling for one and a half years. And, hes happy. 

 One bright morning, three months ago, Kasera decided to do his bit. He designed and set up a website that has now become the talk of the town. Commuteeasy is a pooling initiative that aims to make your daily commute easier by connecting you to those who share your route to work, Kasera said. 

 Car pooling helps lower stress levels, decongests traffic and reduces travel costs. It also boosts productivity and morale. In less than three months, the site has seen 2,600 registered users and 10,000 visitors, says Kasera. Now, the idea has taken wing. The site offers to help travel-weary IT professionals in Pune in a similar way. 

 The bumper-to-bumper traffic gets on drivers nerves, making them angry. I have been car pooling for the last one and half years and am enjoying it, says Kasera. 

 Garima Bhatia, a regular, says its a wonderful way to cover her 44 km to office. Its not the money saved, its being less stressed. Its terrible to see cars occupied by one person. Its such a waste of resources. 

 Ronald De Saran, pooling for only two weeks, likes the change. We can utilise travel time better. We also meet people who are neighbours but were unknown to us earlier. 

 All one has to do on commuteeasy.com is to register and start searching for others with whom one can team up. Just key in the travel details, and the site will generate results instantly. A calculator helps you figure out the benefits.

 Now we are trying to get Citi Taxis (a call taxi service in Bangalore) to start pool trips, says Kasera, thrilled that his concept, borrowed from the West, is going places. 

 It really works. Four of us share a car. I take out mine once in four days and save petrol. It also soothes nerves. I am enjoying the rides as a passenger and have even come to hate driving when its my turn, says Atul Vij.

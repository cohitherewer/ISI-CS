 Cafes losing Netizens

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Cyber cafes remain the favourite place to access the Net in India, but computers at home are gaining ground.

 According to a recent study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India, 39 per cent of the countrys Net users rely on cyber cafes or other public access points.

 But the dominance of cafes seems to be on the decline. The use of cyber cafes reached a peak of 52 per cent in 2003, declined to 46 per cent in 2004 and is now only 39 per cent.

 In contrast, an increasing proportion of Net users are using the computer at home. From only 23 per cent of the total users in 2003, it has grown to 31 per cent in 2006.

 The study suggests that increasing access from home is probably related to the loss of market share by cyber cafe.

 But a major cause of concern is the proportion of Net users who access it from school or college. 

 It is an insignificant 6 per cent, the Internet association says. 

 But among Net users in the school-going age (12-18), the proportion is a higher 15 per cent.

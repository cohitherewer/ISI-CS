 Plane delay puts off Hasina meet

New Delhi: Sheikh Hasina could not keep her appointment with 

the Prime Minister because her Air-India flight reached Delhi two hours late, 

reports our special correspondent.

 The Bangladesh opposition leader was to arrive at 6.30 pm and meet Manmohan Singh at 8 pm on Wednesday. However, the delay forced her to cancel the meeting. She is now expected to meet the Prime Minister on Thursday.

 The Awami League leader, on a private visit, had requested meetings with Singh and his senior cabinet colleagues. She wanted to meet as many leaders as possible to share the perspective on elections in Bangladesh, scheduled for next January. She has taken time off from the election campaign to collect an award from an NGO in Calcutta on June 24.

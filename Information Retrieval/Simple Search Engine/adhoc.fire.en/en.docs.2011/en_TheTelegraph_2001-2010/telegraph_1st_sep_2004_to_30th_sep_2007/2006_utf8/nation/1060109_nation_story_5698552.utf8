 No court say on MP: 

Speaker

 New Delhi, Jan. 8 (PTI): Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is clear that courts have no jurisdiction over the expulsion of MPs from Parliament and that he will not respond to any judicial notice in this matter.

 The Speaker said the government should come forward with a legislation to set up a high-level commission to determine the salaries and allowances of MPs.

 Chatterjee, a lawyer himself, rejected the criticism that the expulsion of the MPs in the cash-for-questions scam was hasty and that the issue should have been referred to the privileges committee or the ethics committee.

 He said the Pawan Bansal committee, which looked into the scam charges, was constituted after consultations with leaders of all political parties. At that time, nobody had raised any objection, he said.

 I cannot stop anyone from going to court. But according to me, the courts have no jurisdiction at all in the matter, he stressed. 

 I am not surrendering or submitting to the jurisdiction of the courts in this issue at all. 

 Chatterjee said he has held consultations with lawyers who fully back his stand that Parliament was competent to take action against its members and that courts did not have a say. 

 Maintaining that he had the highest respect for the judiciary, he said it was a question of discipline and Parliament had the authority under the Constitution to decide how to discipline errant members.

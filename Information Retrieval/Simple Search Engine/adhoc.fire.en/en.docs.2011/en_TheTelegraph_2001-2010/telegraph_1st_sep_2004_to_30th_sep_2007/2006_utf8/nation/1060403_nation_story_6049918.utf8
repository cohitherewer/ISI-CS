 Lady killer whiff in tiger toll

Dehra Dun (PTI): The death of four tigresses in a span of 

two months in the Jim Corbett Park reserve in Uttaranchal has created a flutter 

among top wildlife officials.

 A theory doing the rounds is that these tigresses were devoured by a lady killer on the prowl. The state government has ordered a probe.

Park deputy director Vivek Pandey said: There is suspicion 

that these tigresses might have been killed by a male tiger. We have picked up 

certain clues like pug marks which indicate this.

 Experts from the Wildlife Institute of India have visited the area and carried out investigations. They did not rule out the possibility of poisoning in their report, official sources said.

 Groom quits altar for mobike in Calcutta

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 4: A groom walked out halfway through marriage rituals last night after being denied a motorcycle as dowry. 

 The humiliation came even after Cossipore-resident Rita Kumaris family gave Rs 65,000, furniture and ornaments to the groom, auto driver Rajiv Shaw. 

 Acting on their complaint the police picked up the father of the groom, Shew Kumar, 55, his brother-in-law Surendra Prasad and the matchmaker, Kartick Shaw.

 A senior officer of Chitpur police station said: They have been arrested on the charge of seeking dowry. We have launched a hunt for Rajiv and he should be held soon. 

 Last November, Kartick had brought the match for Rita, 25, to her father Ram Raj Shaw, a small trader living on Cossipore Road in north Calcutta. 

 A relative said: He had given the boys family a wood bed, an almirah, utensils and gold ornaments? everything that he could afford. But even that was not enough.

 Last evening, when the ceremony was in full swing at Basanta Dharmashala ? the house Ram Raj had booked for the wedding ? Rajiv, 31, sought the motorcycle. 

 As Ritas mother Urmilla Devi tried to explain to him that it was beyond their reach, Rajiv excused himself from the mandap. His father and other relatives followed. Rita, in a red silk sari, was left sitting with a garland in hand.

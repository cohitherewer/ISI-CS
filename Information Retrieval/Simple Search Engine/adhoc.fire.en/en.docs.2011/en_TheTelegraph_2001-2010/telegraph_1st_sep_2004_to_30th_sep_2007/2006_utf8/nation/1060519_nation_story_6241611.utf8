 Jaya loss turns fatal

 Chennai, May 18: More than 30 ADMK members have committed suicide since the partys defeat in the Assembly elections last week, prompting Jayalalithaa to deliver a sermon on courage, reports our special correspondent.

 Suicides are no solution to worries and problems. Take problems head-on courageously, Jayalalithaa told her party cadre today.

 When the ADMK president stepped out of the chamber of pro-tem Speaker Sudarshanam after taking oath as member of the House this morning, a horde of hysterical supporters rushed to her. Amma, you are our speech, you are our breath, our very life, they chorused.

 Jayalalithaa, draped in a chocolate brown sari, flashed a smile and the V sign.

 She announced a relief of Rs 1 lakh from her party fund to the family of each of those who have committed suicide.

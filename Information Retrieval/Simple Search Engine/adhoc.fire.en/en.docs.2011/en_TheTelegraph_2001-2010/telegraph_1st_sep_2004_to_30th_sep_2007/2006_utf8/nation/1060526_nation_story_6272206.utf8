 Hindu anger halts Husain UK show 

 Husain

 London, May 25 (PTI): Bowing to pressure from the Hindu Forum of Britain, the Asia House here has abruptly cancelled a painting exhibition of M.F. Husain on security grounds.

 The forum had alleged that Husains paintings of Hindu gods and goddesses had outraged community members around the world.

 The exhibition was inaugurated by Indian high commissioner Kamalesh Sharma on May 10 and was to continue till August 5. However, after calls for its withdrawal by the forum and a threat of a demonstration before the venue by Hindu human rights campaigners on Saturday, the Asia House sent an e-mail saying it has cancelled the exhibition.

 Economist Lord Meghnad Desai said last night that it was an outrageous attack on artistic freedom in the British context.

 While Husains exhibition was cancelled, one of his paintings, titled Blue Girl and sketched in 1964, fetched ?120,000 at a Sothebys auction here on Tuesday. 

 In the same auction, an untitled nude oil on canvas by Indias Francis Newton Souza went for ?310,400. Another ? Amsterdam, a landscape, 1961 ? went for ?624,000 ? the second highest price for Souzas work at any auction.

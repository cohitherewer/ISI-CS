 Tsunami sensors

 Bangalore Jan. 8 (PTI): Isro is developing sensors to pick up warning signs of tsunami from oceans.

 We are developing ocean-bottom sensors for detecting variations in pressure. This is the spin-off of our space technology. We are closely working with the ocean development department on this, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said.

 Isro is also working with the ministry of home to establish a disaster management support system which would address issues on preparedness and evacuation during natural calamities.

 All the space-based resources will be made available to this project, Nair said. It is possible to identify areas prone to natural disasters and safe places where people can be evacuated using remote-sensing pictures, he added.

 52 killed as bus falls into gorge

 Jammu: An overcrowded bus plunged into a deep gorge near Rajouri on Friday, killing 52 people in one of the worst-ever road accidents in Jammu and Kashmir, report our correspondent and agencies.

 The driver of the bus, on its way to Rajouri from a small town, Darhal, lost control while negotiating a bend, just 8 km short of its destination.

 The bus fell about 90 m after skidding off the Darhal-Rajouri road near the Sai Gaji shrine, about 190 km from Jammu, and was reduced to a sheet of metal.

 While only 34-seaters are allowed to ply on the mountainous routes, the bus was carrying more than 65 passengers, said Manmohan Singh, a police officer.

 All the dead have been extricated and the bodies handed over to the next of kin, said state police chief S.P. Vaid.

 Umrao Jaan 

 Aishwarya Rais Umrao Jaan is in a storm again.

 First, it had to deal with a controversy over costumes. Now, Rajtaru Studios Limited has filed a case against its maker, J.P. Dutta, for not honouring dues of Rs 7,50,000 for his earlier films Refugee and LOC-Kargil.

 The Mumbai based post-production studio had asked for a stay on the films release but Bombay High Court refused it on Wednesday, saying the matter wasnt pressing enough. The next hearing is on November 8.

 Keval Sharma of Rajtaru Studios said: J.P. Dutta has been delaying the payment by saying that his films are not doing well so he needed some time to clear the payments. But one fine day, he said that he wouldnt make the payment. So I had to go to the Motion Pictures Studio Association.

 Before the release of Umrao Jaan, I wanted an interim relief, which would either be the payment or a security letter, he added. 

 However, the Dutta camp said the case would not delay the films release.

 Learn from Left, says Atal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 18: Atal Bihari Vajpayee wants the men and women in his party to learn from the communists ? about how to climb back to power.

 The former Prime Ministers reference to the Left came at the partys national executive. He also admitted that there was something lacking in the National Democratic Alliances campaign that led to the defeat in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

 It is true that the way communist parties are moving ahead fast, we should not ape them but we should learn the art of getting renewal of mandate for our government, he is quoted as saying in the latest issue of the BJP Today.

 The part about learning from the Left hadnt figured in the BJPs media brief-ings after the May-end national executive meeting. But it is there in the party magazine, under the highlights of Vajpayees speech.

 It is a great test to get back in power, Vajpayee said. We may go on repeating a hundred times that the NDA government performed well. There is no doubt we indeed did well, yet, something was lacking.

 He said the people praised the governments work but did not renew its mandate to rule.

 In the states where the party is in power now, we must resolve to retain power, Vajpayee said. We should work out a strategy for it.

 He spoke about making a success of coalition governments in states where the BJP shared power. Strengthening a coalition government without weakening our own self is a difficult task. We should ponder over it as well.

 He said the party was capable of converting a crisis into an opportunity.

 But if we fail to make the best of an opportunity, that only means something was lacking. There was no reason why we should fail to run a government. Our success depends on how we behave with each other and what kind of people we take along.

 In that valedictory address, the former Prime Minister also touched on the sensitive issue of the exit of leaders like Uma Bharti and Madan Lal Khurana, who were expelled from the party. He didnt name anyone, though.

 We should introspect about it, he said, after citing how the party was losing some ? though not many ? leaders.

 We are ready to suffer any setback if there is no other way out, but losing someone from our ranks is a big loss to us.

 He said there was an urgent need to move ahead with a sense of mutual affection and cooperation. 

 Whatever problems may arise, we will face them collectively.

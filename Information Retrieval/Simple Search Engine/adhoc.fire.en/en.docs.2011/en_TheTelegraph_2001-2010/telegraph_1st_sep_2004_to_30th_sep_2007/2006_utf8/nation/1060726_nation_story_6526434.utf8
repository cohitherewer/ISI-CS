 TO SIFT SHADY ELEMENTS

 Arent college 

 certificates enough? 

 Lucknow, July 25: Want to get into Lucknow University? How about going to the police station first?

 The cops will decide if you are worthy enough.

 The unusual move, a brainchild of university vice-chancellor R.P. Singh, has come in the wake of increasing incidents of violence involving students. So the university has decided on this novel way to screen criminal elements.

 Aspirants have been directed to get a character certificate from the police saying they have a clean past. Only then can they get into the university rolls.

 The decision has kicked up a storm among students. We already got a character certificate from the college we had studied in. How can the police give us a certificate? said Shamim Ahmed, a student who has applied for admission to a postgraduate course.

 Maybe, says the vice-chancellor, but the university had no other way. We have been forced to resort to this stringent method as the law and order situation in the university has slid to an all-time low.

 The decision has come after several incidents of violence. On July 18, a group of students raided Singhs house mouthing filthy abuses. Leading the students was Ram Singh Rana, a student leader. Two days later, postgraduate aspirants tore up question papers for the entrance test.

 Earlier, on July 14, university professor G.S. Bhadauria was shot at near the campus in Hasanganj. 

 Authorities say the universitys reputation has suffered because of student violence that has become routine over the past 10 years. So the new vice-chancellor ? who is from IIT Kharagpur ? decided something had to be done. He has also asked the cops to flush out criminal elements from the hostel.

 The character-check plan has, however, run into a bit of resistance ? from the cops themselves. There are 30,000 students who study in the Lucknow University campus. We dont have the infrastructure to issue police verification certificate or a character certificate for all, said Lucknow senior superintendent of police Gautam Goswami.

 All we can do is inform the university about the criminal cases in which students are involved, he added.

 But the vice-chancellor is not giving up on his plan. We will inform the government to get the police do it, he said.

 While Singh is determined, the students have hit back: they have asked the university to check the antecedents of professors. Yesterday, they gheraoed the vice-chancellor. Today, they staged a sit-in.

 But Singh did not appear too worried. The anger will fade, he said. We will convince good students about the utility of the plan.

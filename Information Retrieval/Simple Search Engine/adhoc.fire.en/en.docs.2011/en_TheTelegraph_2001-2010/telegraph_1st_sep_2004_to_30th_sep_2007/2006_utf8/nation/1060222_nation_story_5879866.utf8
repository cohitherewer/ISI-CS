 Delhi plays on US fears

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Feb. 21: Twenty-four hours before President George W. Bushs top nuclear negotiator arrives in Delhi for make-or-break talks with officials in South Block, Indias top envoy here today stoked American paranoia that nuclear weapons could end up with terrorists unless there was a creative and realistic approach towards non-proliferation.

 Appearing at a Newsmaker event at the National Press Club here, Ronen Sen bluntly told Americans who are opposed to the July 18, 2005, nuclear deal with India that Delhis nuclear weapons programme will go ahead with or without outside help.

 His twin public approaches, combining conciliation and defiance as part of Indias public diplomacy linked to the nuclear deal, was part of an effort to build public opinion here and disarm critics, as Nicholas Burns, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, plans final negotiations with foreign secretary Shyam Saran.

 Burns will arrive in the capital tomorrow night and have talks with Saran on Thursday and Friday. Sen is leaving for Delhi today to join the talks.

 The ambassador told Americans that India and the US stand together in their joint resolve to see that nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists.

 A day after French President Jacques Chirac endorsed this resolve together with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Sen recounted Indias unblemished record in non-proliferation to make the point that Delhi was a reliable ally for Washington in halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

 Describing the July 18 deal as a unique, but not a risky agreement, Sen reminded Americans that way back in Jawaharlal Nehrus time, India was the first country to call for a global ban on nuclear tests.

 Sen challenged non-proliferationists here who raised the bogey of a nuclear arms race in Asia last week in a memo to the US Congress, in anticipation that Bush will send legislation to Capitol Hill on the deal with India before leaving for Delhi next week.

 Their memo warned that the separation plan that Burns hopes to finalise in Delhi by this weekend would open Indias civil nuclear facilities to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but that the countrys military facilities will remain outside the IAEAs reach.

 As a result, nuclear fuel sold to India following any Indo-US agreement would still free up Indias existing capacity to produce plutonium and highly enriched uranium for weapons and allow for the rapid expansion of Indias nuclear arsenal, the memo said.

 Sen said in reply to a question that India has had its military programme for a very long time and we dont need any outside help for our nuclear weapons programme. We did not obtain any material covertly from abroad. That programme will continue irrespective of any outside help.

 Indian mom in nose-ring fight

 Durban (PTI): A woman of Indian origin 

 is planning to file an appeal in the high court here against 

 a school for not allowing her daughter to wear a nose-ring 

 during school hours. 

 Navaneetham Pillay, an astrologer, has been fighting Durban High School since early this year. 

 My daughter has been denied her constitutional right to follow her customs and traditions and I am not prepared to allow this matter to die down, she said. 

 This is our basic right. Can you imagine Tamil women being denied their right to wear the thali or the dot during their working hours? she asked. 

 The Natal Tamil Vedic Society will support Pillays appeal because this is a constitutional issue. 

 We believe that the school is just being petty in picking on the nose-ring, said Rajah, who heads the society. 

 Obscenity warrant for Shilpa

 Madurai (PTI): A court on Friday issued 

 non-bailable warrants against actresses Shilpa Shetty and 

 Reema Sen for posing in an obscene manner in 

 photographs published in a Tamil eveninger.

 After Dhakshinamoorthy, an advocate, filed a petition, judicial magistrate Seetharaman issued several summons to the actresses. But the duo did not appear in court. 

 The photographs were published in Hindi and English dailies as well. 

 A non-bailable warrant issued to the eveningers editor Murugan was cancelled as he surrendered in court.

 Teen rapist

 Sonepat (PTI): A six-year-old 

 was allegedly raped by a 15-year-old neighbour at Kakroi 

 village, about 10 km from here, on Friday.

 The girl was playing outside her home when Lalit came and lured her to his house where he raped her, police said. A search is on for the teenager.

 Raids on officers

 Jaipur (PTI): The state anti-corruption 

 bureau on Friday raided the premises of 11 officers of the 

 Rajasthan administrative services and other junior employees 

 for allegedly possessing property disproportionate to their 

 known sources of income.

 Water clash

 Akola (PTI): Four persons 

 were injured in a clash over water in Ugwa village near 

 here. Trouble broke out when taps ran dry and villagers 

 attacked each other with iron rods. Cases have been registered 

 against 30 people, including the sarpanch.

 The army has set up a high school and a computer training centre in Kokernag, around 80 km from Srinagar. The soldiers of 36 Rashtriya Rifles also organised a medical camp in a village.

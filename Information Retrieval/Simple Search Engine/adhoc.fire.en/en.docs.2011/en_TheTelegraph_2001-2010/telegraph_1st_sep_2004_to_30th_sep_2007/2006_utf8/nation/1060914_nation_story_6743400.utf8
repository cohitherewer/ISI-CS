 Taste of Tihar for Ramani

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: After a lifetime in the company of the powerful and the glamorous, Bina Ramani will have to spend the next two weeks with common criminals in Tihar jail.

 A Delhi court today sent her to judicial custody till September 27, agreeing with police that the probe into the alleged Tamarind Bar licence forgery would be hampered if she were let off.

 The socialite has applied for bail, which the court is expected to take up tomorrow.

 As she was led out of court by women attendants and into a white Qualis, there were tears streaming down her cheeks. Police sources said she had broken down on a few occasions during the six days in police custody.

 She would all of a sudden break down. This happens sometimes. She was probably tired and is not used to the stinking cells, a police officer at Hauz Khas police station said.

 Ramani will have a cell to herself at Tihar tonight, but may have to move in with hardened criminals tomorrow if her bail plea is rejected.

 Of course, we will make sure that she is comfortable with inmates who share the cell with her. After all, she is an accused, not someone who has been convicted, M.K. Sharma, the investigating officer, said.

 The Tihar cell she will be kept in has no windows. She will have to sleep on a five-foot cement platform with just a sheet on it. The jail isnt known for clean toilets either.

 Till the evening she was arrested in Goa, Ramani the Sultan of Brunei, one of the richest men in the world, counts her as his personal friend was attending and organising parties for several embassies in the capital.

 She spent the day yesterday at her Portuguese-style bungalow in Goa, though in the company of the police.

 While searching her house in South Delhi, the police had apparently found evidence on her computer showing that she had moved to Goa the documents relevant to the forgery. Premises of some of her friends in Mumbai were also searched. In Goa, her daughter Malinis boutique wasnt spared either.

 RSS loses voice

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: The RSS has dispensed with the post of official spokesperson, a post created after the NDA had come to power.

 Ram Madhav (in picture) now holds the spokespersons post that will be scrapped, PTI quoted sources as saying in Nagpur, where the RSS is based.

 Sources in Delhi said the move reflects the Sanghs eagerness to retreat from the media glare and refrain from commenting on day-to-day developments, a practice that brought matters to a head when L.K. Advani made his controversial comments on Mohammed Ali Jinnah in Pakistan. 

 In line with the new trend, BJP president Rajnath Singh has also been keeping a low media profile.

 Paralysis rise foxes doctors

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: A dramatic and unprecedented rise in non-polio paralysis among children in India over the past two years has remained largely unexplained, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said today.

 Releasing a report on the polio-eradication drive, the IMA said while the initiative had made significant gains in reducing the incidence of polio paralysis, this alarming rise in non-polio paralysis needs to be investigated.

 Figures from the National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) show that the annual number of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) a polio-like weakness of the limbs below the age of 15 ranged between 8,000 and 9,000 from 1998 to 2003. However, AFP cases rose sharply to 13,200 in 2004, and even higher to 27,000 in 2005.

 Its unprecedented and there is no satisfactory explanation, said Dr S.K. Mittal, former head of pediatrics at Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi and chairman of an IMA committee set up last year to examine immunisation issues.

 The global average incidence of AFP is about 1 per 100,000. But in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the incidence has gone up to more than 12 per 100,000, Mittal said. Why should such a rise happen here alone?

 NPSP officials explain the rise in AFP cases as a consequence of a substantially improved surveillance system that allows virtually every child with symptoms that resemble paralysis to be labelled as AFP.

 The surveillance system has been operating with high efficiency since 2004 and most surveillance officers are in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Jay Wenger, project manager with the NPSP, said.

 But the IMA team has said the NPSP has no valid explanation for the high numbers. The IMA has recommended evaluation, including detailed symptom follow-up, to assess the possible causes and consequences of the AFP.

 The teams report has said paralysis may also be caused by other non-polio viruses that infect the human gut. The NPSP has detected such viruses in some districts of Uttar Pradesh where they appear to account for up to 50 per cent of AFP cases.

 The IMA has also called for an independent national expert group to consider new strategies for polio eradication, saying that despite intensified pulse polio activities, eradication has not being achieved. Polio has affected nearly 260 children in India this year. 

 Over the past decade, weve had more than 60 pulse polio campaigns in different parts of India, but polio eradication has not been achieved, said Mittal.

 We need to re-evaluate the need for pulse campaign, and focus on routine immunisation which has been harmed by the intensified pulse campaigns, he said.

 The pulse campaigns in which children below five receive the vaccine on a single day have diverted resources and interest away from routine immunisation that was supposed to be the backbone of polio eradication.

 Instead of conducting house-to-house search for children, we need to bolster routine immunisation and sanitation and hygiene, as well as motivate the public to accept the vaccine, said Mittal.

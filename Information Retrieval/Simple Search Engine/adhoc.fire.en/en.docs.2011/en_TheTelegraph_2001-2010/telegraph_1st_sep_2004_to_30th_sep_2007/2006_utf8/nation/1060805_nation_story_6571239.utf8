 Lanka cops packed off home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Aug. 4: A 44-member Sri Lankan police contingent undergoing training at a CRPF facility in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu was sent home last night on instructions from the UPA government.

 The Delhi directive saved the day for the ruling DMK, which came under attack in the Assembly in the wake of the Lankan army turning its guns on Tamils following the near breakdown of the peace process on the island.

 I have just received information that the police contingent from Sri Lanka left Coimbatore last night, chief minister M. Karunanidhi told the Assembly this afternoon.

 The matter was first raised in the House on Wednesday by MDMK leader M. Kannappan and the state government spoke to Delhi that night, Karunanidhi said. State chief secretary L.K. Tripathy then formally wrote to the Union home secretary yesterday, the chief minister added. 

 Leaders from the ADMK, Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), MDMK, PMK and the CPI today kicked up a furore in the House, saying the programme amounts to imparting training to kill Tamils (in Lanka) from Tamil Nadus soil. 

 Karunanidhi tried to pacify the MLAs, saying the Lankans were being given police training on civilian aspects like crowd management, enforcing order and ensuring peace at public meetings. This should not be construed as training given to the Lankan army, he said. 

 However, Karunanidhi added, Delhi should consider whether throwing open CRPF facilities for police training to the Lankan force was necessary and desirable at a stage when the peace process had almost broken down in the country.

 He stressed that harm done to Tamils anywhere in the world cannot have our sympathy.

 But the chief ministers reply did not satisfy leaders of the DPI and the MDMK, who staged a walkout.

 The ADMK, the main Opposition party, also stormed out saying the Centre could not have given permission for the training programme without the DMK governments knowledge.

 Cops wait to get hand on Gibbs

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 Gibbs

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: The most hostile attack that Herschelle Gibbs faces during the ICC Champions Trophy may come in his hotel room, and ducking will not help.

 Delhi police are sharpening their claws to question the South African batsman whom they have been tracking for six years ever since the cricket match-fixing scandal broke.

 Officers of the polices special cell today said Gibbs would face rigorous questioning and even arrest if he was found evasive during the questioning.

 If we find him evasive, we will not think twice before clamping handcuffs on him, said a senior member of the special cell.

 Gibbs is expected to arrive in India with a battery of lawyers for the interrogation sessions, most of which are likely to take place at the hotels where the South Africans stay.

 The match-fixing controversy was unearthed during South Africas 2000 tour of India, with Gibbs, the visitors captain Hansie Cronje and left-arm spinner Nicky Boje among the main accused.

 Cronje died in a plane crash in 2003 while Gibbs and Boje, fearing arrest, have avoided coming to India since then. Boje is absent from the squad this time, too.

 Gibbs and Boje are accused of cheating, fraud and criminal conspiracy under sections 418, 423 and 120A of the Indian Penal Code for which they face a maximum of three years in jail if found guilty.

 Delhi police have been to South Africa to investigate but say they were not allowed to question either player.

 We finally gave him (Gibbs) a list of 18 questions, said additional commissioner (special cell) Alok Pandit. Gibbs answered the questions, but Delhi police were not satisfied.

 The questioning, the police hope, would help establish that Gibbs had played a key role with Cronje in the conspiracy to deliberately lose matches.

 Bookies, who faced a crackdown after the match-fixing controversy broke out but have resurfaced in smaller offices since, are worried that Gibbss visit may spur the police into carrying out fresh raids against them.

 They believe the police could do this to get Gibbs to identify some of those involved in match-fixing.

 We will have to stay completely underground over the next few days, missing out on all the money to be made during the Champions Trophy, said a bookmaker in Karol Bagh.

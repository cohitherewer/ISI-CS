 Caste out of TN temples

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, May 16: Wanted, qualified temple priests ? caste no bar. 

 If you are wondering if its some sort of a joke, its not. Its just that in Karunanidhis Tamil Nadu, priesthood has got more competitive.

 The new DMK-led government today decided to elbow out caste from one of the states oldest institutions ? temples ? and open the door to priests from all social backgrounds.

 The decision, which fulfils one of the DMKs promises in its 2006 poll manifesto and has been welcomed by almost the states entire political class, including the BJP, came at the first cabinet meeting that M. Karunanidhi chaired since taking oath as chief minister last week.

 So far, pujas in temples, except in small village shrines dedicated to folk gods, goddesses or guardian angels, have been confined to Brahmins well versed in the Vedas and agama shastras (manual of temple worship).

 The government has decided to soon promulgate an order so that persons from all castes could become temple archakas (priests), provided they acquire the requisite training and qualification.

 The resolution adopted by the cabinet said the decision, which would abolish caste from the 36,000-odd temples under the states Hindu religious and charitable endowments department, would also fulfil the late E.V. Ramaswamy Naickers wish. The Dravidian icon, popularly known as Periyar, was passionate about bringing in such a reform. 

 An earlier DMK government, that too led by Karunanidhi, had in 1970 enacted a law to make people of all castes archakas in temples as part of a larger goal to Tamilise temple worship. 

 But the Supreme Court struck it down after a group of conservative priests protested, saying the agama shastras do not provide for such universalisation of priesthood.

 However, todays resolution said the apex court, in a 2002 judgment, had cleared the air on this issue, paving the way for people from all castes to become temple priests.

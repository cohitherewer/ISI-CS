 Stab at Sonia, Amit looks on

 Lucknow, Sept. 22: Mulayam Singh Yadav today came out firing at Sonia Gandhi with Amitabh Bachchan at his side.

 The Bollywood icon sat silently on the dais as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and his Samajwadi Party colleague Amar Singh ripped into the Congress president at a rally on the Gorakhpur University grounds.

 After Sonias attacks on his government in Bareilly on Wednesday, today was Mulayams turn. He replied to the allegation of not having spent central funds by accusing Sonia of mouthing rehearsed expressions to slander the state government.

 Amar contrasted the central grants for Uttar Pradesh and Vidarbha to accuse Delhi of bias.

 All this while, Bachchan sat with an impassive face.

 Yet Bachchans mere presence at a Samajwadi rally after four years and a half, surrounded by some of Sonias fiercest critics, could be laden with meaning at a time of growing frostiness between two of the countrys best-known families.

 After some effort by mutual friends at a reconciliation early this year, relations between the Nehru-Gandhis and Bachchans had dipped again during the office-of-profit row.

 Amitabhs wife and Samajwadi Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan had made it clear whom she thought responsible for getting her out of the House by what she felt were underhand means.

 The old bitterness bubbled up again last week when the Congress-controlled Bhopal civic body razed a structure Jaya had built in front of her ground-floor flat in that city. Her mother Indira Bhaduri, who lives in the flat, accused the Congress of trying to settle scores.

 Jaya wasnt present at todays rally, where Mulayam handed out kanyadhan (a financial aid for women) and an unemployment dole, schemes introduced with an eye on the state polls early next year.

 But Bachchan, who makes it a point to deny any official links with the party, urged the crowd to strengthen the chief ministers hand. The superstar himself handed over cheques to scores of women.

 Mulayam Singh Yadav has given you a chance to get this assistance. Use this (for) your well-being as well as that of society and the country, the actor said.

 With the party having announced his visit well in advance, thousands gathered to welcome Bachchan at the towns airstrip. In white kurta-pyjamas and an off-white scarf, Bachchan was not his usual glamorous self, though.

 At his last Samajwadi rally on February 8, 2002, in Kanpur he had sung the 80s hit Mere angane mein. Today he just recited a few poems by his father Harivanshrai.

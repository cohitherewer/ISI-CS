New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Indian and US militaries come together for a second time in two months for joint exercises that will focus on tackling suicide terrorism and human bomb philosophy in counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency, this time in Belgaum.

 The exercise, Shatrujeet, will be held in an urban/semi-urban setting between October 25 and November 3, army sources said here today.

 Echo Company of the second battalion 4th Marines of the US Marines served in Ramadi in Iraq in 2004, in the most volatile Al Anbar province in the region that came to be known as the Sunni Triangle. The unit is now sending 160 soldiers for the exercise with a rifle company of the Indian Armys Punjab Regiment.

 In September, the Indian and US soldiers came together at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii for the second edition of Yudh Abhyas (training for war) for three weeks.

 Army headquarters sources said Shatrujeet is expected to enhance interoperability at functional level. Indian military sources have usually been hesitant to use the word interoperability when it came to joint exercises with the US military. But that hesitation has now been dropped.

 Last month, at a briefing in Nato headquarters in Brussels where, too, interoperability was the buzzword, Nato military officials said they looked forward to joint missions with the Indian military as a consequence of a relationship with India that was still developing.

 For Shatrujeet, the soldiers will participate in the bilateral exercise on confidence and survival training, combat shooting, rock climbing, security of operating bases, astral navigation, unarmed combat, room training, detecting and neutralising improvised explosive devices, intercommunication and radio telephony procedures. 

 The two sides would focus on evolving joint drills on establishment of outer and inner cordons, human rights in counter-terrorism operations and ambush/counter-ambush action.

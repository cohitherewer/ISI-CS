 Tyagi glides, Tipnis flies high

 Hindon, Oct. 8: Air Chief Marshal Shashindra Pal Tyagi in orange overalls tumbled out of a Mi17 helicopter and floated down in a parachute at this Indian Air Force base, east of Delhi, this morning to signal the start of the services platinum jubilee celebrations. 

 But, on the ground, even as Tyagi was floating in mid-air and drawing praise for earning his parawings at 60 years of age, it was a predecessor, former Air Chief Marshal A.Y. Tipnis, who was capturing the eyeballs.

 Copies of a magazine Force carryng Tipnis signed article, in which he took a swipe at the army for being reluctant to part with information as the Kargil war (1999) was being planned, were distributed among invitees to the Air Force Day celebrations here. Among the invitees were defence attaches, diplomats, former air chiefs, serving chiefs and Rahul Gandhi.

 Tipniss nearly 10,000-word engrossing account of the deliberations in defence headquarters during one of which the then chief of army staff, General (retired) Ved Malik, stormed out had exposed once again that in the Indian military jointness is still a theoretical concept. 

 The article was written as a response to Maliks book Kargil: From Surprise to Victory but coming as it did just after the release of General Pervez Musharrafs In the Line of Fire, it has added to the discomfiture among the top brass.

 But before the day , Tipnis and a hurt Malik had made up in Tyagis at-home party each promising a drink to the other. The immediate provocation was probably polite enquiries made by the Pakistani air attache, who was also present at the party and had engaged Malik in conversation asking him why Tipnis was criticising him.

 Malik was not in town when news of the article by Tipnis broke, but before coming to the party he had read through it.

 Malik said he had already written his last word in his book. But since Musharraf has claimed a victory in Kargil, he was now coming out with a revision in the Hindi edition of his book. 

 I told him, said Malik, pointing to the air attache, differences, if any, did not come in the way of throwing your soldiers out of Kargil.

 For Tyagi, who has been reluctant to be drawn into the controversy, its been a happy Air Force Day. A Pakistani invited to a party in his house brought two formerly quibbling generals together. But when they meet over the promised drink, Malik and Tipnis are likely to hardtalk out of earshot.

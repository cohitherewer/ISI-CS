 IIT gates beckon rural pupils

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: Thanks to a changed entrance pattern, more students from rural areas will make it to the IITs this year.

 The new pattern, which stresses more on in-depth study than short cuts, has considerably reduced the disadvantages rural students face vis-?-vis their counterparts in cities.

 Almost 150 more students from villages have cleared the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) this year compared to last year.

 The new pattern is the best thing the government could have done to enhance our chances, said Amit Kumar, a top-100 ranker from a small village in Siwan, Bihar.

 Nearly 1,943 of 6,403 qualifiers (30.67 per cent) to the IITs and Banaras Hindu University ? to which selection occurs through the JEE ? this year are from rural areas. The figure last year was 1,794 (28.02 per cent).

 The percentage increase in rural qualifiers is over 2.5 per cent this year, up from the previous highest of 0.47 per cent between 2003 and 2004.

 Coaching centres agree that the new pattern, introduced last year on instructions from the HRD ministry, could be a key reason for this.

 This years question paper focused on concepts rather than on problems. The new pattern requires deeper and wider study than earlier.

 Though most rural students do take specific coaching for the IIT entrance, coaching centres concede they often have clearer concepts than students in cities, particularly the metros. 

 They work harder and their concepts are clearer, whereby they stand in good stead, said Rakesh Lalla, head of corporate communications at FIITJEE, Indias largest IIT coaching centre.

 He added that over the years it has been observed that city-bred students had a street-smart approach to their preparation.

 They (students from cities) seek short cuts. They do not study in depth, but only do as much as they think is necessary to qualify.

 Another change in admission procedures that has helped rural students is that a first division ? 60 per cent ? in board exams is now mandatory to be eligible for admission to the IITs.

 Till last year, a student simply needed to pass the Class XII board exams and qualify the JEE to walk into an IIT.

 Students would have no interest in what was happening in school, since they only needed to pass the boards, Sucharita, a physics teacher at Delhis Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, said.

 The 60 per cent rule works in favour of rural students as they tend to focus more on their boards, teachers said.

 Two of my friends and I cleared the exam and have over 90 per cent marks in our boards, hardly any of the city qualifiers can say that, said Ravi from Borli village in Maharashtras Raigad district.

 The number of first attempt-qualifiers is also at a record high of 2,761 (43 per cent) this year. Coaching centres feel they, too, have benefited from the new concept-driven questions. They are fresh out of school, and their concepts are clearest then, Lalla said.

 Governor anyone? So many vacancies amp; so few aspirants

 New Delhi, May 28: The Congress is in a fix. 

 The Centre will shortly have to fill the posts of at least 10 governors but no politician is willing to take up the job. 

 The upshot is the government may have to fall back on former bureaucrats and cops and that, Congress sources admitted, was not a happy situation. Not when crucial, poll-bound states like Punjab and Uttaranchal need new incumbents in their Raj Bhavans.

 Two years ago, when the UPA government took over, it went into what was perceived as an overdrive by the BJP to cleanse the states of governors who were appointed by the NDA regime. It picked on those who were seen as the direct appointees of the RSS, such as the late Sunder Singh Bhandari and Bhai Mahavir, and BJP loyalists. 

 After the BJP cried foul and campaigned against the Congresss witch-hunt, inside and outside Parliament, the government decided to go slow and allow the governors to complete their terms before bringing its own nominees.

 However, even then, there was no marked enthusiasm in the Congress for the lollipop. The only heavyweights to accept the post of the governor (of Gujarat) were Naval Kishore Sharma of Rajasthan and former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna (of Maharashtra) and that, too, reluctantly. 

 Sources said Sharma, who had allegedly cosied up to the BJP before the 2004 polls on the calculation that the NDA was returning to power, was discreetly told he would not get a Rajya Sabha nomination and, therefore, a berth in the Union cabinet. Governorship was the only honourable option before him, they added.

 Krishna has already let it be known that he was dying to get out of Mumbais Raj Bhavan and plunge himself into politics in Delhi or Karnataka. There was speculation during the last cabinet shuffle that he may be inducted in an important ministry. A section of the Congress blamed Krishna for meddling in Karnataka politics from his Mumbai perch and causing the loss of the coalition government.

 Others who were sounded included Gandhi family loyalists M.L. Fotedar and R.K. Dhawan but they turned down the offer.

 This time round, Margaret Alva was approached but she, too, reportedly refused. She apparently believed her detractors in the Congress were spreading this story to get her out of 24 Akbar Road. 

 The sources scotched the speculation of gubernatorial posts for veterans Arjun Singh and Motilal Vora. There may be no love lost for Arjun in the Congress and the government. Whatever the politics of Other Backward Classes reservation, the fact is he is a Rajya Sabha member and we cannot afford to lose a seat in the Upper House. Ditto for Vora, said a source.

 The only Congressman who eagerly sought a stint in a Raj Bhavan was AICC secretary Major Ved Prakash. It was rumoured that he would replace Ramachandra Ganesh Kapse as the Lt Governor of Andaman and Nicobar. 

 Among the states that need governors immediately are Andhra Pradesh (vacated by Sushil Kumar Shinde after he became an Union minister) and Bihar (after Buta Singh was recalled). The sources said Orissa governor Rameshwar Thakur, who holds additional charge of Andhra, may be shifted from Bhubaneswar to Secunderabad. 

 The other states where the incumbents will retire include Karnataka, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Uttaranchal. 

 Since the Northeast has a history of ex-bureaucrats and cops presiding over its Raj Bhavans, the Congress is unlikely to depart from this tradition and root for politicos. 

 The principal secretary to the Prime Minister, T.K.A. Nair, for instance, is tipped to take over as the governor of one such state.

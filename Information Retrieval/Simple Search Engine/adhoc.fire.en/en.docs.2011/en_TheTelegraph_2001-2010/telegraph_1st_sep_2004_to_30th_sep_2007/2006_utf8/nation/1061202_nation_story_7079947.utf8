 NRI racism suit on bank

 London, Dec. 1 (PTI): An NRI senior executive is suing Dutch bank ING for over 100,000, alleging that she has been a victim of racist remarks and that her career hit a glass ceiling because of her race. 

 Meena Sagoo, 48, alleged that not long after joining the bank, her boss told her how the rest of the staff had likened her to a character in the popular BBC comedy, The Kumars At No 42. 

 Sagoo, who earns 80,000 a year, will claim at an employment tribunal that another Asian, Brij Bharati, was nicknamed Bhindi Bhaji by boss Richard Mutter. 

 According to a report in Daily Mail today, she also said her white colleague Chris Taylor had caused offence by repeatedly discussing the British Raj with her.

 Other Asian and black members of staff were subjected to racist remarks following the September 11 attacks in the US, according to Sagoo. 

 She is bringing an employment tribunal claim for race discrimination and victimisation against ING Services Ltd. The bank and Mutter, the managing director, strongly deny all her allegations. The case is due to be heard in February. 

 British-born and of Indian descent, Sagoo from Hounslow, west London, joined INGs London Wall offices in 2002 and became a vice-president a year later. She worked in an IT department developing computer systems for the banks human resources team.

 Shortly after I joined ING, I was sitting in an open-plan office and a Sri Lankan male colleague was there, too, she said. Richard came up to us and said, Do you realise what we call you two? We call you the Kumars at No. 42.

 The Kumars at No. 42 features NRI actress Meera Syal as an acid-tongued granny and her real-life husband Sanjeev Bhaskar as her son. They host a chat show from their home and ask guests bizarre questions. Bhaskar has done voice-overs for ING advertisements.

 Mutter smirked when she challenged him about calling Bharati Bhindi Bhaji, Sagoo claimed. 

 She said she had applied for promotion in 2005, but was not even interviewed. In May that year, she was demoted and last month she was the only member of staff to be transferred to another company. She has been off work suffering from depression. 

 Last week, a Chinese employee who worked in the same department as Sagoo was awarded 20,000 by a tribunal after winning a race claim against ING.

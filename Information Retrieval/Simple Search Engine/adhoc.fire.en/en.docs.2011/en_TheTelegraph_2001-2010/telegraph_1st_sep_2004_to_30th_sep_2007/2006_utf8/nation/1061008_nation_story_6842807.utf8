 Assam rail security 

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 7: A rattled Dispur today promised special security arrangements in Assams trouble-torn North Cachar Hills district at a mini conclave held in Lumding. 

 The new security arrangements include providing round-the-clock mobile patrolling wherever work is going on and at offices and residences of officers and employees. 

 A high-level team from Dispur, led by revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman, today visited the site where militants, suspected to belong to the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah, gunned down 11 people, including eight railway employees, yesterday. Barman was accompanied by additional chief secretary C.K. Das and an inspector general of police. 

 The team and senior officials of NC Hills administration met railway officials and representatives of NF Railway Mazdoor Union and Employees Association. Barman said Rs 3 lakh would be provided to the families of the deceased. 

 D. Kohli, additional chief security commissioner of Railway Protection Force (RPF) in NF Railway, said the bodies of seven Railway Protection Special Force jawans were sent to Delhi from Guwahati en route to their home states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir. A guard of honour was given to them at Maligaon. 

 Train services resumed between Lumding and Silchar today after the workers union withdrew its agitation last night, following an assurance from the government that security would be beefed up. Two trains the Barak Valley Express and the Cachar Express carry commuters between the two stations and serve as the lifeline for residents of south Assam, Manipur and Mizoram. 

 For commuters in Tripura, a passenger train plies between Silchar and Manu in the neighbouring state. Additional security was provided to passengers on both trains. Representatives of the union urged Dispur to consider the security aspect of railway employees. 

 The killings have come as a major blow to the Lumding-Silchar-Jiribam gauge conversion project sanctioned in 1996. Work on the 293.7-km stretch is unlikely to meet the commissioning deadline. 

 of 2009, as over 80 per cent of the 171-km stretch between Silchar and Lumding passes through areas infested by rebels. So far, only around 38 per cent of the work has been completed. 

 Dispur, however, asserted that the attack would not affect the completion of any project. I dont think such mindless acts of terror have any long-term impact. We have arranged heavy security cover for projects in the sensitive areas. We are prepared to meet any eventuality, chief secretary S. Kabilan said.

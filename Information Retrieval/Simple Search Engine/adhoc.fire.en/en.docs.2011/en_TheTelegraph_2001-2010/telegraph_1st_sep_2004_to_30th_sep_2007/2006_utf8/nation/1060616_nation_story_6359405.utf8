 Quota panel ambit

 - Rules to cover states, private units

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 15: The panel monitoring the implementation of 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes in higher education will set new norms for academic standards that would apply not only to central institutions but also to state and private ones.

 At a meeting today, the oversight committee discussed hitches that might arise while implementing the quota. 

 One of the questions that came up was whether it had the mandate to dictate terms to state institutions.

 Most of the members felt it was the prerogative of the states to decide the quota percentage and admission policies. But they also said the committee was well within its rights to spell out norms for academic standards for state and private institutions. 

 The Centre is usually wary of stepping on the toes of states, which resent any intrusion in the field of education. But the oversight committee believes that academic standards should have a national-level benchmark.

 Such a decision could be a boon for thousands of students who often cough up huge sums of money to get into colleges only to discover later that some of them have substandard academic faculties and poor infrastructure. The All India Council of Technical Education, an apex body governing technical institutions, has de-recognised many such institutions.

 The Centre, too, has been hard-pressed to streamline private institutions, which have mushroomed all over the country. 

 The committee has planned a national colloquium on July 3. We have invited experts from various fields to get their inputs, said Veerappa Moily, the panels chairperson.

 Sources said these inputs could have a bearing on the student-teacher ratio and quality of the faculty. If the experts decide on a particular student-teacher ratio, it might become the new standard.

 At the end of todays meeting, Moily admitted there were several problems in the implementation of the OBC quota. But solutions are possible, he said and added that he was confident that a plan would be in place by the time the next academic year begins.

 US student visa interviews faster

 New Delhi (PTI): The US visa office is accommodating all requests for student visa interviews within three weeks, the US state departments non-immigrant visa chief Sally Ironfield said.

 This is in contrast to post 9/11, when there was a sharp decline in clearing student visa applications and visa procedures were made stringent too, she said.

 We are now on an upswing and on track to outpace last years number of 18,000 student visas issued.

In a webchat at the American Center, she said: The official 

period prior to studies in the US in which a student may apply for a visa is 120 

days and the visa office in New Delhi is currently accommodating all requests 

for student visa interviews within three weeks.

 India has been the leading country of origin for international students in the US for the fourth year running.

 There is no Congressionally mandated limit for issuance of student visas and most applications from India are approved, she said.

 Custody clash for baby

Hyderabad (PTI): Two-year-old Nikitha is at the centre of 

a battle between her biological mother and a childless couple who have raised 

her.

 Nazia gave birth to Nikitha in Borabanda in the city two years ago. But she abandoned the child the next day after her husband deserted her. 

 Later, the owner of the house where she was staying, handed over the child to Bikshapati, an autorickshaw driver, who adopted the infant after informing police.

 Nazia, reportedly suffering from a mental disorder, recently approached the police to get back her daughter. But Bikshapati is not willing to part with the child.

 There is no police case in this. The only option for us is to send the child to a state home. It is up to them to proceed legally, the police said.

 Serial litigant

 Kuala Lumpur (PTI): Hardial Singh, a 76-year-old Malaysian 

of Indian origin, has been jailed for eight months for filing frivolous lawsuits.

 Foeticide stick

 Jaipur (PTI): Seven women doctors have been suspended for

would be conducted, family welfare director S.P. Yadav said.

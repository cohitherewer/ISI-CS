 Mixed term for Zahira kin

 Mumbai, June 8: A sessions court today sentenced Best Bakery prime witness Zahira Sheikhs sister, Sahira, to three months rigorous imprisonment for giving false evidence, reports our special correspondent.

 But the court was lenient towards their brother Nasibullah, considering his young age, and is likely to put him on probation.

 Sahiras sentence has been suspended till July 10 as her plea against the Bakery ruling is pending in Bombay High Court. She was also fined Rs 500.

 Unlike Sahira, Nasibullah had pleaded not guilty to the charge of giving false evidence. The court said it would wait for a report from the probation officer.

 Left growls, wont bite

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 28: The 

 Left parties are unhappy with the budget, but the government 

 need not panic ? its most important allies have no intention 

 of pushing their opposition beyond the dotted political 

 line.

 The bottom line of the Lefts political strategy remains what it has been: keep the government in power to keep the BJP out. At the same time, they will keep up with their criticism of the Centre on two crucial aspects ? foreign and economic policies.

 Sources said the Left parties might later decide to bring cut motions to oppose certain budget proposals. 

 Despite the increase in revenue collection, the budget fails to utilise the opportunity to fulfil the major commitments in the common minimum programme, the CPM politburo said in a statement.

 It is a pedestrian budget, added CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. The government has ignored all our suggestions.

 The Left parties had given finance minister P. Chidambaram a wish list of what they expected in the budget. The list included, among others, suggestions to increase corporate tax and levy taxes on luxury cars, AC hotels and restaurants, and mop up black money.

 They had also said they would assess the proposals as a measure of how much the government was ready to consider their suggestions. Now they say the finance minister has ignored their proposals but are not being able to express their disaffection in hard political terms.

 The Left is unhappy with the budget proposals in virtually every sector ? from agriculture to health and education. The Union budget has failed to address many of the vital problems of the common people, particularly the peasantry and the unemployed, the CPM said.

 Most of the recommendations of the national commission for farmers have been ignored such as the creation of a price stabilisation fund for agricultural commodities, the politburo underlined.

 The government has made substantial allocations in education and health, but the Left finds it disappointing. The projected increases in health and education spending are disappointing. The small increase in spending for the crucial Integrated Child Development Scheme will not be enough to meet the Supreme Court order to universalise the system, the CPM said.

 Far from extending the coverage of the public distribution system for food, the government, the party added, has actually reduced the budgetary allocation for food subsidy.

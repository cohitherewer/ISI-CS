The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Spend crores, make more

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Oct. 8: Forget that dream job, bet on the ballot, instead. It will be more rewarding and, if its Andhra Pradesh, you could take home Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh every month.

 Thats the kind of sum representatives elected to the states village bodies, mandal councils or the Assembly earn, says a state election commission report that has turned the spotlight on the spiralling cost of elections.

 It takes Rs 10 lakh to get a sarpanch elected, Rs 25 lakh to make sure you have a fighting chance to become a mandal parishad president and Rs 3 crore if one has set sights on the post of the zilla parishad chairman. The figure for an MLA is around Rs 25 crore.

 But few would disagree with the idea that its worth it. After all, an MLA makes Rs 45,000 per month, including allowances for security and travel which add up to Rs 15,000. And thats not all. Legislators get a two-bedroom quarter with free water, electricity and maintenance in the state capital. This would cost at least Rs 30,000 in rent, says a spokesman in the Assembly secretariat.

 Topping this up is a fee of Rs 300 per day that legislators get for attending the Assembly, besides transport charges, free lunches and breakfasts if the session prolongs.

 Signs of the apparent affluence are flaunted with a vengeance. Almost 95 per cent of the legislators own expensive sports utility vehicles like Scorpios, Innovas and Qualises for themselves and their entourage. Almost 100 of them enjoy special escort of gunmen, and a majority of the 295 MLAs have private armies with at least six members. 

 Those on hot wheels need to cruise the information highway, too. So, on come HP laptops costing Rs 50,000 apiece for the MLAs, who were even wired to home PCs at a cost of Rs 80,000 each during the Telugu Desam regime.

 The programme failed as legislators were permitted to buy their own models directly, instead of direct deliveries from PC manufacturers, says a senior Congress legislator. The reference is obviously to MLAs who might have claimed the money for a computer but spent it on something else.

 The MLA packages often get an unofficial boost through cuts and commissions from engineers and contractors building infrastructure projects in constituencies. Engineers and contractors religiously set aside 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of the outlay, a source said. 

 Many legislators also mint money by encroaching on government plots in Hyderabad, where prices shoot up to Rs 15,000 to Rs 35,000 per sq ft. The land mafia is thriving in the city and over 75 gangs, comprising over 2,000 armed men, are on the prowl.

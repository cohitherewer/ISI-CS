 Strike poser to doctors

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 24: Can doctors go on strike? 

 The Supreme Court today posed the question while enlarging the scope of a public interest litigation seeking a ban on disruption of emergency services by doctors participating in a demonstration or protest.

 The PIL, filed by NGO People for Better Treatment, sought a ban on strikes in emergency wards. But the court decided to look into the larger question ? whether doctors and hospital staff could at all go on strike.

 Issuing notices to the Centre and the Medical Council of India (MCI), a bench headed by Justice Arijit Passayat appointed senior counsel Rajiv Dhawan to assist the court in deciding the matter.

 According to the PIL, strikes by doctors are not in consonance with the rules framed by the MCI, the Hippocratic oath and an apex court judgment against disrupting essential services.

 In 2003, the court had ruled that strikes, especially by government employees, to disrupt a social service was illegal. The PIL cited the ruling and sought action against doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences who did not provide emergency services during a strike to protest the proposed reservation in higher education.

 The NGO, headed by Kunal Saha who fought a legal battle for action against some Calcutta doctors whose negligence allegedly resulted in the death of his wife, specifically mentioned the death of a patient in AIIMS during the strike.

 It pointed out that refusing to attend to a patient needing emergency treatment was against the Code of Ethics Regulations framed by the MCI in 2002. Besides, the Hippocratic oath governing the conduct of doctors around the world also made it obligatory for them to make an effort to save the lives of patients, the PIL added.

 The court asked the Centre and the MCI to file their responses within six weeks. The NGO was asked to file its rejoinder within four weeks thereafter. The next hearing will be four months later.

 Small step in torch-up hunt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, May 7: Five days after an eyewitness named 11 people who stabbed and torched a neighbour to death during a communal flare-up in Vadodara, police revealed they have made their first arrest.

 Nilanth Balkrishna, 42, had been in hiding ever since 38-year-old businessman Mohammed Rafiq Vohra was dragged out of his car and killed on Ajwa Road during curfew on Tuesday night, the police said.

 He was arrested by a special squad from his home, A/29 Mahakali Society, at 11 pm on Friday night when he returned to collect a change of clothes.

 The police, accused of a partisan role during the violence that followed a dargahs demolition, had been under fire for failing to catch the murderers even after Vohras younger brother named 11 people straight away and added three more names later.

 Officers said a tip-off had led to Balkrishnas arrest, and the man ? who was clearly drunk ? had seemed surprised at finding the police waiting for him.

 The suspect, a Maharashtrian, had not revealed much during interrogation and the police were still in the dark about where the rest of the accused were hiding, additional commissioner V.M. Pargi said. The police have Balkrishnas custody till Tuesday.

 Some of the other accused, who are absconding, have criminal records. Many of them have been involved in rioting earlier, too, Pargi said.

 He excused the failure to catch them by saying the suspects knew from past experience where the police ? who had been accused of going soft on the 2002 rioters, too ? would search for them.

 All the 14 accused are residents of Riddhi Siddhi and Mahakali Society, about 500 metres across Ajwa Road from Kismet Society, where Vohra lived with his family.

 The post-mortem report on Vohra said he died of stab injuries but was also charred by the time he was brought to hospital.

 Minority leader Chirag Sheikh has alleged that the police havent been sincere about arresting the killers and had deliberately allowed them to escape.

 The city has been calm for the past three days. The army has been withdrawn from the two police station areas of Raopura and Karelibaug and curfew will be relaxed from 8 am to 5 pm, the police said.

 The communal clashes led to six deaths and left dozens injured.

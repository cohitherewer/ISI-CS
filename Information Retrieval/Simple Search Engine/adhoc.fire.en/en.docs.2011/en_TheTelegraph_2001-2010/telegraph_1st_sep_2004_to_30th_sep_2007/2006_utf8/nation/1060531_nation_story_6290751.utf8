 Thanks-TV on screen 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 30: World Cup in June, Tamil Nadu thanksgiving in September.

 The Tamil Nadu government today said global tenders would be floated for buying colour television sets to fulfil the poll promise of the ruling DMK in phases from September 15.

 The promise, once fulfilled, will mean 53 lakh more television sets in the states. Though the purchase would be in tranches, television-makers banking on a customary surge in sales ahead of the football spectacle can now hope to prolong the party.

 In its election manifesto, the DMK had promised to give free 14-inch colour TV sets to 53 lakh below-poverty-line families in the state over a period of two years. The party had dubbed it a pro-woman measure as TV can both be a medium of recreation and a source of general knowledge to rural women in particular.

 Chief minister M. Karunanidhi said a committee of MLAs from all parties would be formed to monitor the tender process for the bulk purchase to ensure transparency, stem nepotism and avoid kickbacks.

 September 15 was chosen for the kickoff because it is the birthday of the DMKs founder-leader, the late C.N. Annadurai. 

 Union IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran had recently said the Centre would suggest to the Tamil Nadu government to quickly invite foreign companies to set up assembling units in the state so that the cost of each TV set could be brought down to below Rs 2,000 a piece.

 Since the proposal could take a longer time to yield results, the state government would have to initially buy the colour TV sets in bulk for the launch in September.

 Cases withdrawn

 The government withdrew a record 342 cases of defamation filed by the previous Jayalalithaa regime against rival politicians and the media for alleged objectionable speeches and scurrilous articles. Of the cases, 147 had been slapped on DMK functionaries. Nine were against the media.

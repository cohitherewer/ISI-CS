 IKEA role model in child labour fight

 Chennai, April 2: An estimated 14 per cent of Indian children in the 5-14 age group are still engaged in labour, according to the latest United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (Unicef) report. 

 This includes children employed in production of goods, often inexpensive, for direct export by large multinational companies, notes the report on The State of the Worlds Children 2006.

 Most of these children work in the informal economic sector? and often in private homes doing subcontracted work, it says. 

 The Unicef study emphasises the need for corporate social responsibility and mobilisation of consumers to demand an end to violations of childrens rights. 

 The glare is the harshest on Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for an estimated 15 per cent of Indias working children.

 The report cites the example of the IKEA Group, which has teamed up with Unicef to demonstrate how the private sector can do business in developing countries in a socially responsible manner by using the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a framework.

 The multinational company ? the worlds biggest furniture retailer with 202 stores in 32 countries ? has a labour code to ensure that no children are employed at any level of the supply chain, the report says.

 A Unicef-IKEA project in Uttar Pradesh ? it is being implemented since 2000 under the name Bal Adhikar-IKEA Initiative ? covered 500 villages in Jaunpur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh, from where carpets are sourced, the report says. The states carpet industry claims a nearly 85 per cent share of Indias carpet exports and draws the bulk of its weaving labour force from marginalised rural households.

 The IKEA initiative works on the premise that simply removing a child from work does not eliminate child labour per se. The root causes of child labour ? like indebtedness in marginalised communities, adult unemployment and poverty ? and childrens right to quality primary education need to be tackled, according to the report.

 This strategy also involves enabling women to form self-help groups. In phase one of the IKEA project, 430 such groups comprising 5,600 women were formed and they saved up to $3,700 (Rs 164,576) a month, the report says. 

 This enables women to escape the exploitative interest rates of local moneylenders and when families are freed from indebtedness, they are less likely to send their children to work.

 The project also addresses childrens education through enrolment campaigns and alternative learning centres that have brought nearly 75,000 out-of-school children between 6 and 12 years into the formal school system, it notes. 

 IKEA has also launched a programme to reach and protect every infant and pregnant woman in all the 21 blocks of Jaunpur district. Its goal is to achieve at least 80 per cent immunisation coverage in the district by 2007.

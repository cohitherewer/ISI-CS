 N-plants on Lashkar hit list: Govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 31: The Centre today said the Lashkar-e-Toiba was planning more strikes, with nuclear installations likely to be on the hit list.

 The intelligence agencies had reported that the attacks could come on critical infrastructure, military targets and religious places, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Lok Sabha.

 He said a slew of security measures had been taken to protect the nuclear installations.

 BJP leaders L.K. Advani and V.K. Malhotra had raised the issue during question hour, referring to national security adviser M.K. Narayanans recent remarks on television about a Lashkar threat to nuclear installations.

 This House has the right to know whether the threat exists or not, Malhotra said. Advani said it was a serious matter and either the Prime Minister or the defence minister should make a statement.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee agreed with members that at a time when Parliament was in session, Narayanan should have revealed his information first in the House.

 I wish the statement had been made here and not outside, he said, delivering a mild rebuke.

 Mukherjee said Lashkars activities were being monitored by security and intelligence agencies, and the government had taken the inputs on its plans very seriously.

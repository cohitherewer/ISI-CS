 Death after thief tag

 - Tongue-lash amp; ruler rap from teachers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Nov. 15: Before 15-year-old Spandita Pal hanged herself with her dupatta last night, she sat down to write a last request to her parents.

 Please tell my headmistress Im not a thief, the suicide note said.

 The class IX student had explained to Avijita Chowdhury that the bunch of notes she was being accused of stealing from a classmate was actually money she had saved from her allowance to buy a book.

 The classmate, Banasree Das, was convinced but the headmistress of Bankura Mission High School was not.

 Chowdhury was arrested this evening after Spanditas father Sunil Pal, an oil mill employee, lodged a police complaint against her, Bankura police chief R.K. Singh said.

 The police said that for the past few days, the students of the school in Bankura town, about 300 km from Calcutta, had been complaining that money, pens and other stationery were disappearing from their school bags.

 Last Saturday, Banasree lost a sum of Rs 50. Yesterday she noticed a bunch of 10-rupee notes in Spanditas bag. Suspecting her to be the thief, Banasree informed the headmistress. Chowdhury asked her to fetch Spandita to her office, an officer said.

 But Spandita explained to her classmate that she had been saving up over the past few months to buy a collection of model questions, Prashna Bichitra.

 I realised she was telling the truth, Banasree said. I took her to the headmistress and told her I no longer suspected Spandita. But the headmistress now accused me of trying to shield Spandita and threatened to hand transfer certificates to both of us for lying.

 The headmistress denied the expulsion threat. I asked Spandita to bring her parents to school, but I never mentioned anything about transfer certificates.

 Spandita was very quiet after she returned from school, her mother Lakshmi said at the familys home in the towns Haritakibagan locality.

 In the evening, she locked herself in her room. I was in the kitchen and thought she was studying. Around 9 pm, I knocked to tell her dinner was ready but she wouldnt respond. I then called my son and husband.

 Sunil and Nilkanta, Spanditas elder brother, broke the door open to find her hanging from the ceiling.

 My daughter could never have been a thief. She was a lively girl and wasnt a bad student, either. When she was promoted to class IX I had to spend about Rs 1,000 on her books. Then she asked to buy the model questions book and I told her I couldnt afford it right away, said Sunil, who earns about Rs 3,500 per month. She told me she was saving money to buy the book.

 The school stayed closed today. Some guardians stuck posters on the gate and walls demanding punishment for those who drove Spandita to suicide.

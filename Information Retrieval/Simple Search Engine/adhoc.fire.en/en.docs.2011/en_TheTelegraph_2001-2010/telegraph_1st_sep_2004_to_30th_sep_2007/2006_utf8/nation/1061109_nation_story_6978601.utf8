 Cong poll hope for Mamata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: The Bengal Congress will back Mamata Banerjees candidate for the December 4 bypoll to the Islampur Assembly constituency in North Dinajpur, provided the high command gives the nod.

 We are in favour of supporting Mamata, but the AICC has to clear it, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said today.

 During the September bypolls, the Congress did not field candidates for the Bongaon Assembly and the Katwa Lok Sabha seats, while the Trinamul Congress supported it in the Malda and Purulia parliamentary constituencies. 

 AICC general secretary Margaret Alva said from Delhi today that she would support the state units decision. In September, we had an electoral understanding with Mamata to counter the CPM. This time, too, we have no problems.

 The death of CPM legislator Mohammed Farooque Azam necessitated the Islampur poll.

 The move will help strengthen the Congress-Trinamul bond, Alva said, adding: We want her to come out of the NDA. 

 Mamata, however, has refused to quit the BJP-led alliance. 

 Her party is planning to move a no-confidence motion in the Assembly over land acquisition in Singur and the blood test kit scam. 

 The Congress, though, is yet to make up its mind on whether to support the motion.

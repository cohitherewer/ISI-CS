 Left fires at Maoist busters

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, June 16: The Left parties have asked the UPA government to disband the Salwa Judum, an organisation set up by the Chhattisgarh government and police to counter Maoists.

 At the UPA-Left coordina-tion committee meeting last evening, CPM and CPI leaders told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that the Salwa Judum ? comprising armed villagers ? has virtually unleashed a civil war in Chhattisgarh.

 They want the government to immediately recall Naga and Mizo battalions from the state because, the leaders alleged, stationing the jawans there was a ploy to pit tribals ag- ainst one another.

 When Singh asked for their alternative, the leaders said they were not asking the government to stop fighting the Maoists, but that the Salwa Judum was not an instrument to be used in that fight.

 The government gave the Left leadership a report charting the Maoists activities, which showed Chhattisgarh was the only state where the rebels had stepped up violence.

 The Salwa Judum campaign figured in a review of internal security by the Cabinet Committee on Security this morning. The 48-hour economic blockade by the Maoists in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh that ended yesterday was also discussed.

 The review was only the third in the UPAs two-year rule. There were also presentations on Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and the Maoist insurgency.

 In the discussions, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said no decision was called for. But the campaign of the Salwa Judum vigilantes and demands for its disbandment were taken note of. 

 The Congress leadership is likely to take up the issue in a meeting tomorrow. 

 Todays meeting was chaired by the Prime Minister and attended by home minister Shivraj Patil, Mukherjee, the army chief and heads of intelligence agencies.

 There is a growing perception that the RSS is seeking to increase its influence through the Salwa Judum. The Left parties alleged that the BJP, which has called it a peoples movement, is also using it to fight the communists. A CPI lawyer, they said, was picked up for taking up a case on behalf of the rebels.

 In Chhattisgarh, the administration first identifies villagers who are not sympathetic to the rebels. They are then sent to camps under police protection, supplied with arms and exhorted to fight.

 Oil report in three months 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Natwar Singh

 New Delhi, May 22: The Justice Pathak Inquiry Authority, set up last November to probe the Iraq oil-for-food scam in which former external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh and the Congress were named as beneficiaries, is likely to submit its report within three months.

 This was disclosed today in the Rajya Sabha by finance minister P. Chidambaram while responding to Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singhs allegation that the UPA government was trying to hush up the revelations.

 Justice Pathak does not intend to ask for further extension and has assured that he will endeavour to submit his report during the extended period of three months, Chidambaram said.

 The government had granted three more months to the authority after Justice Pathak sought an extension, though Natwar Singh was keen that the panel should wrap up its work fast. The panels six-month term to probe the Volcker Committees allegations expires in May.

 Chidambaram said: Both the Congress and Natwar Singh are under the purview of the Pathak Committee.

 The reference in the Volcker Committees report was to two oil contracts, one of which named the Congress as non-contractual beneficiary while another named both the Congress and Natwar Singh.

 Expressing satisfaction over the progress of the probe, Chidambaram said the Enforcement Directorate had already submitted two reports to the Pathak panel. One more (report) is under preparation (by the ED) and this will be presented to the Justice Pathak Authority in two to three days, he said.

 The finance ministers comments came in face of the Samajwadis concerted attack aimed at embarrassing the government.

 After explaining the progress in the inquiry into the oil-for-food scam, Chidambaram sought to clear the doubt over his alleged role in the move to sell 49 per cent residual shares of the government in Balco at a throwaway price, thus causing a loss of Rs 9,000 crore to the exchequer. 

 No decision has been taken by the Committee of Secretaries or the ministry of mines. The government knows and the Prime Minister knows (about increase in the prices of Balco shares). The final decision will have to be taken by the CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs), Chidambaram added.

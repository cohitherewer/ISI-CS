 Support for Speaker swells on court role

 Chatterjee: Adhunik Bheeshma

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today received the support of presiding officers of state legislatures on his stand that courts have no say on the expulsion of MPs and MLAs from the Houses.

 The presiding officers, who met here in an emergency meeting, unanimously passed a resolution that courts should not interfere in the legislature.

 Addressing a day-long conference, Chatterjee asked the courts to decide whether they had the constitutional authority to intervene in the expulsion of MPs on corruption charges.

 Ten Lok Sabha MPs and a Rajya Sabha MP were expelled in December after being caught on camera accepting cash to ask questions in Parliament. Some moved Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court for redress.

 The conference, attended by 41 presiding officers, adopted a resolution endorsing the Speakers decision to refuse court notices on the matter.

 Chatterjee, however, said the judiciary and the legislature should not be on collision course. It is farthest from my mind. The legislature will not gain anything by having confrontation. They are occupying different areas altogether; spaces are different and functions are different. Where is the question of confrontation?

 The resolution was moved by Jharkhand Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari and seconded by Uttar Pradeshs Mata Prasad Pandey and Bengals Hashim Abdul Halim.

 Namdhari even called Chatterjee an adhunik Bheeshma Pitamah (modern-age Bheeshma), adds PTI. 

 He said the Speaker was different from the original Bheeshma, who had been a mute witness to the disrobing of Draupadi. But you have refused to be a mute spectator and stood up to protect the dignity of Draupadi, Namdhari said.

 The Speaker had consulted all political parties before refusing the court notices last month. While most sided with him, the BJP felt the chair should send a lawyer to the Supreme Court to convey Parliaments view.

 Chatterjee said such judicial proceedings were not maintainable as they lack the sanction of the Constitution. As the custodian of the powers, privileges and immunities of the Lok Sabha and of its Speaker and members, I cannot assent to make them a subject matter of judicial scrutiny, contrary to constitutional provisions, he said.

 Any other stand taken by him would have impaired the prestige and dignity of the legislature, undermining the principle of separation of powers, which is one of the basic principles of the Constitution, he said.

 Travel agent dies in shikara row

 Srinagar (PTI): Ten boatmen have been arrested in connection with the killing of a Mumbai-based travel agent, whose body was flown home on Sunday. 

 Jammu and Kashmir police have also launched a hunt for two others who allegedly had an argument with two travel agents on Saturday over fixing the rate for a shikara ride. 

 The argument snowballed into a scuffle in which one of the agents, Dhiren Shah, died and the other sustained injuries. Both worked for the Mumbai-based travel firm Tanman Group.

 Shakeel link to Priyanka

Mumbai (PTI): Priyanka Chopra found herself in more trouble 

after her former manager, Prakash Jaju, claimed he has received threats from underworld 

don Chhota Shakeel over his tiff with the actress.

 I received a call from a person claiming to be Chhota Shakeel this morning threatening me that I should withdraw the case against Priyanka and that I should stop talking about her to the media. I have now asked for police protection, Jaju said on Sunday from Indore.

 Jaju has been at loggerheads with Chopra for the past couple of years, claiming that she owed him Rs 67 lakh as fees for promoting her films. 

 The actress, however, has refuted the claim and last week filed a complaint saying Jaju had been threatening and harassing her.

 PVR water row

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has stayed the order of 

the Monopoly Restrictive Trade Practices Commission restraining PVR Ltd from selling 

mineral water bottles at its multiplex in Noida.

 A division bench, however, asked PVR to make free purified drinking water available at the multiplex.

 Ramdev security

 Hamirpur (PTI): Security has been beefed up for Swami Ramdev 

after the arrest of a suspected militant from the venue of a yoga camp being conducted 

in this Himachal town by the spiritual guru, police said.

 Rear wall robbery

 Thrissur (PTI): About 17 kg of gold, worth around Rs 1.5 

crore, and Rs 6.45 lakh in cash were robbed from the office of a cooperative society 

in Kerala on Saturday, police sources said. Burglars broke into the office of 

the Kanhani cooperative society by cutting open the rear wall.

The 

Jammu and Kashmir government, as part of its efforts to beautify shrines, has 

initiated a project to renovate the Ziyarat-i-Ganj Baksh shrine in south Kashmir.

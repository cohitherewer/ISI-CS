 Clock ticks on N-deal, Iran rows

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The government urgently wants to placate the Left on the Iran vote and Indo-US nuclear pact, but is struggling to find the time before President George W. Bushs visit.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made his Iran statement in both Houses on February 20 and will make one on the nuclear deal on February 27. But its unclear if he can concede the second and tougher part of the Lefts demand ? for clarifications on his statements.

 The Lok Sabha lacks a rule allowing members to ask questions on a ministers statement, but the Rajya Sabha has one. Often, it is the question-answer session that throws light on the stickier aspects of an issue, drawing the government out on areas concealed or glossed over in a statement.

 Given the political implications of Iran and the nuke deal, the Left expects to get more out of the Prime Ministers clarifications than his statements.

 An earlier schedule, drawn up by the business advisory committees and parliamentary affairs minister P.R. Das Munshi, had slated a discussion on Iran for February 23 in both Houses, leaving enough time for clarifications.

 The assumption was that Parliament would have finished its other crucial pre-budget business ? adopting the motion of thanks on the Presidents address ? today. This exercise is preceded by speeches from the leaders of the Opposition and the Prime Ministers reply.

 But L.K. Advani, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, upset the timetable by insisting he needed an hour for his speech. So, Advanis speech and the Prime Ministers reply were put off for tomorrow (the Upper House covered the motion today).

 The Iran discussion will begin immediately after that. Das Munshi said there would be no question or zero hours and no lunch break either. But because every political party has lined up one or more speakers, sources said, the proceedings may drag on till late at night and it wasnt certain if the Prime Minister could give his clarifications in the Upper House.

 There is no hard-and-fast rule that clarifications must be given immediately (after a statement). So it doesnt matter when the PM replies, a source said.

 Ditto for the nuke pact statement. Singh will make it on February 27 after the economic survey is tabled.

 The Union budget will be presented on February 28. The House can resume business after this, but the Centre wants the budget to hold complete sway on Tuesday.

 After that, Bush would be in India. We hope the Left would not demand the Prime Ministers clarifications when Bush is here, the source said.

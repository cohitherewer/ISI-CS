 CPM to scan govt style 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhattacharjee

 Calcutta, Oct. 29: The CPM state committee will review the functioning of the Bengal government in view of differences among ministers as well as within the party over land acquisition for industry.

 The review will be the first such exercise since the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government returned to power in May.

 The CPM state committee, which began today a two-day session on organisational issues, is expected to meet for the review by December.

 We will review the functioning of the state government as well as coordination between the government and the party by December, a member of the party secretariat said.

 The review is aimed at ironing out differences of perceptions as well as confusion within the government over industrialisation, the leader added. The review will be held to clear the air within the party in the wake of opposition to land takeover.

 Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and ministers from Left Front partners the CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc had expressed misgivings about the land policy of the government in the wake of agreements with Tata Motors and the Salim Group.

 The CPI struck a discordant note today, too. The ally accused the CPM of maintaining double standards over acquisition of farmland for industry in Bengal and elsewhere.

 At a rally in Calcutta, peasant leader Atul Anjan criticised the takeover of fertile tracts for the Tatas and Salim. If we justify special economic zones on farmland here, how can we protest against them in Haryana, Maharashtra or Uttar Pradesh? he asked. 

 The state CPM has also decided to set its house in order and is holding a series of meetings following the central leaderships decision to spread its reach to the Hindi heartland and step up its presence in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. 

 The expansion drive will depend on the financial as well as organisational muscle of the party units in Bengal and Kerala. 

 Being an important unit of the party, we have to carry some extra responsibility, state party secretary Biman Bose told the meeting today.

 The draft organisational report prepared by the state leadership stressed on problems of plenty, particularly problems posed by the post-1977 crop of party members. 

 The problems include corruption, factional feud, hunger for power and highhandedness.

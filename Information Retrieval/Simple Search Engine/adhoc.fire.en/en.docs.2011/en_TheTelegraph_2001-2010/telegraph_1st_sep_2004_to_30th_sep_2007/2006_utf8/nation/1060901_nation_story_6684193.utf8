 Yechury takes PM on beedi trip

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Guess what or who is the trigger for the Prime Ministers visit to Sholapur tomorrow?

 Sources in the Congress and the government would have one believe that Manmohan Singh is visiting the Maharashtra town to lay the foundation stone for the second transmission scheme for the Power Grid Corporation. But sources close to him said it was mainly at the initiative of CPM leader Sitaram Yechury.

 Singhs daylong visit includes the inauguration of a low-cost housing scheme for women workers in Sholapurs beedi industry. The scheme fructified, thanks to Citu, the CPMs labour arm, and Yechury.

 While Citu, the dominant trade union in the areas beedi sector, built up pressure on the ground, Yechury pursued the project with the Centre.

 A public-private partnership has ensured that nearly 10,000 women workers will get a one room-kitchen tenement. The units, spread over 425 acres at Khumbari, will cost Rs 40,000 each. It was a promise Yechury had made to the women through a greeting he sent at a joint convention of trade unions in Sholapur on August 15, 2004.

 The Prime Minister has included Yechury in the team that will fly to Sholapur with power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Congress general secretary Margaret Alva.

 The visit was twice put off, once because of some urgent work in Delhi and the other because Singh was furious with the CPM after one of its routine anti-government statements. Singh reportedly told a confidant that if this was the CPMs response to the help the Centre gave, he would rather not oblige Yechury and Co.

 On one occasion, the Prime Minister had cried off a visit to Bengal when CPM general secretary Prakash Karat opposed a cabinet decision on divestment. It happened shortly after the Lefts victories in Bengal and Kerala.

 Sholapur, however, is not the only stop on Yechurys travels with the Prime Minister. He will soon be on board the aircraft that will fly Singh to Brazil and Cuba for the Non-Aligned Movement summit.

 A huge Left delegation is expected to accompany him, among them CPI leader D. Raja and the editors of the CPMs house journals, Ganashakti (Bengali) and Deshabimani (Malayalam). It is believed that Yechury is not going as MP but as editor of Peoples Democracy to complete the CPMs editorial contingent.

 Congress sources said Yechurys engagements with the Centre led them to believe that he was as vital a conduit with the Prime Minister as Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Sources close to Singh recalled with gratitude his efforts in Nepal at a time when the country was on the verge of dismemberment. Yechury did much of the spadework with Nepal Maoist boss Prachanda and other leaders.

 While the governments wish is Yechury should be more effective in getting his party to come round on issues like divestment and policy regarding the US, the Congresss regret is none of its functionaries are indulged to the same extent by the Prime Minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Naidu shield pruned

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Naidu: Safer? 

 Hyderabad, Sept. 11: Out of power, yes, but safer, too?

 At least, thats what the Andhra Pradesh government apparently believes is the case with former chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose security cover has been whittled down to a third of what it was when he was at the helm of the state, says the officer in charge of his security.

 The Telugu Desam Party president, who survived a lethal landmine attack by Maoists in 2003 at Tirupati, was given Z-category security cover by the then NDA government at the Centre. His security status matched only that of ADMK chief Jayalalithaa and former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.

 After the Desams May 2004 rout, the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government had reduced the number of men who guard Naidu. In January 2005, the number was brought down from 160 to 85. Now, it is around 50. 

 However, the National Security Guards Black Cat cover given to him continues, as does the bullet-proof car that Naidu uses along with his colleague and former home minister T. Devender Gowd. The Desam chief has also been given a bullet-proof vest.

 Till the Congress government took over in May 2004, a special team of the state polices special task force went on a recce, sterilising the route every time Naidu went for meetings in the districts.

 Zahira to mark more time in prison

 Zahira: Fresh blow

 Mumbai, June 12: Punished for her flip-flops, the jailed Zahira Sheikh got another jolt from the judiciary today after a special court handed her a three-month term for giving false evidence in the Best Bakery massacre case.

 Judge Abhay Thipsay also slapped a fine of Rs 500 on her and said she would remain in jail for another 10 days if she fails to pay up.

 More than a dozen people died in the massacre after a mob attacked and torched the bakery that Zahiras family owned in Vadodara during the 2002 Gujarat riots. Zahira, a prime witness, later turned hostile amid accusations that she had been bribed.

 The case was retried in Maharashtra after the Supreme Court stepped in and on February 24 Judge Thipsay sentenced nine rioters to life in prison.

 Thipsay said the three-month sentence would begin after Zahira, who is now in Byculla jail, completes the one-year term the Supreme Court had ordered for contempt in March.

 Before pronouncing the verdict, Thipsay, who found Zahira guilty of giving false evidence on 15 counts, asked her if she wanted to say anything.

 I do not wish to say anything, Zahira replied from the witness box.

 Her lawyer Umesh Deshpande said his client would challenge the verdict.

 Earlier, the court had found Zahiras mother Sehrunnisa and sister Sahira guilty of similar charges and sent them to jail for three months. Judge Thipsay also found Zahiras brother Nasibullah guilty but hinted that he would consider placing him on probation because of his young age.

 Todays verdict came in the wake of showcause notices the judge had issued against Zahira and her family on February 24 for intentionally lying to the court during the retrial of the case.

 Last month, Zahira had also run into trouble with the income-tax department, which provisionally attached her properties, including a house in Ekta Nagar in Vadodara, a flat in Mumbai and two small plots in the name of her brother.

 The tax authorities also froze three of Zahiras bank accounts, including one in Syndicate Bank in Bhayander in Thane, where she stayed during the retrial of the massacre case.

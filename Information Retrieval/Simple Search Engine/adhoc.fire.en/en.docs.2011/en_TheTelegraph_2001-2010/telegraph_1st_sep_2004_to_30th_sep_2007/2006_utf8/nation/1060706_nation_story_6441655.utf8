 Varsity bill put to test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 5: Human resource development minis- ter Arjun Singh will have to convince several cabinet colleagues before he can push through the Foreign Universities Entry and Operation (for the maintenance of quality and prevention of commercialisation) Bill, 2006. 

 The bill, to be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament, lays down guidelines foreign universities will have to follow if they want to set up branches in India. At present, they do not have to comply with any rules. 

 Foreign universities will be eligible for national treatment, the bill says, ruling out any preferential treatment.

 But a section in the cabinet believes the stringent rules will drive away high-ranking institutions. 

 Also, the health ministry thinks the role of statutory councils like the Medical Council of India will be diluted if the University Grants Commission is invested with the authority to regulate foreign institutions, as the bill proposes.

 Foreign universities would have to comply with the HRD ministrys rules on fees, admission policy and reservation of seats for other backward classes, scheduled castes and tribes if the bill is passed.

 Some cabinet ministers believe foreign universities should be exempt from all regulations, and have suggested the creation of special education zones along the lines of special economic zones. The ministry for overseas Indian affairs has sought the same exemptions in a proposal floated for a university for the people of Indian origin living abroad. 

 But the HRD ministry has rejected the concept of preferential treatment on two grounds. First, that it will not be fair to Indian universities. Second, students passing out from these foreign institutions could face problems if the degrees are not recognised by domestic statutory councils.

 The Indian institutions are certified by either the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) or UGC.

 Singh is going to point out that foreign institutions are allowed to function in countries like China and Malaysia only by invitation. The free-for-all culture in a special education zone will make it difficult to prevent the entry of fly-by-night operators, the HRD ministry says.

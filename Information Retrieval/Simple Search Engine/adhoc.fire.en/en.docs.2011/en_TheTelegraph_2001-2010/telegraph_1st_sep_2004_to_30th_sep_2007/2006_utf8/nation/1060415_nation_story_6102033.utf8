 Freed, Rockstar Salman wants to fly

 Mumbai, April 14: The grand reception from his fans last night may have warmed his heart, but Salman Khans legal headaches are far from over.

 The actor, who was released on bail yesterday in a chinkara poaching case, will move the Jodhpur sessions court tomorrow to seek permission for going on a world tour. Salmans lawyers in Jodhpur will appeal to the court.

 Only after the courts assent can he organise his passport and visas for Rockstars 2006, a show that will travel to the US, UK, Canada and Europe from April 21.

 Salmans sentence of five years imprisonment had put a question mark on his appearance in the show and had sent its organisers, Morani Brothers of Cineyug Ltd, into a tizzy.

 The cloud lifted after the Jodhpur court granted him bail yesterday afternoon. The star, who spent three nights in Jodhpur Central Jail with a murder convict for company, returned to Mumbai last night, where a flood of frenzied fans welcomed their hero home. 

 However, even if the court grants Salman permission to travel abroad, Rockstars is likely to be delayed, the organisers said. Salmans lawyers will seek the courts permission tomorrow. We anticipate that we may have to delay the tour by a week or so. We may have to reschedule the itinerary, but lets wait till the court grants permission, Ali Morani of Cineyug Ltd said.

 The next hearing in the chinkara poaching case has been scheduled for June 22. But before that, the case in which Salman and his co-stars Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre and Tabu have been accused of killing two black bucks when they had gone to Jodhpur for shooting a film, will come up for hearing on April 22. Salman is likely to apply for exemption from appearance in the case. The other three have been exempted already. 

 In Mumbai, the actor faces the hit-and-run trial in which he is accused of killing one and injuring five bakery employees when he allegedly ran over them with his Land Cruiser in 2002. Salman has been exempted from appearance in that case.

 Things seem to be finally looking up for Rockstars, which suffered one blow after another ? after the Salman sentence, actor John Abraham had an accident and Esha Deol sprained her ankle. 

 The Dhoom star, who was treated for soft tissue damage in his left leg, now looks set to make it to the show. John is definitely on for the tour. We just spoke to him, Morani said.

 However, the actor also faces arrest in connection with the accident ? his bike had crashed into two cyclists who suffered minor abrasions. 

 John later clarified from his hospital bed that he was neither drunk nor speeding when the accident took place and said the cyclists were on the wrong side of the road. His arrest may just be a formality and is not likely to hinder the show.

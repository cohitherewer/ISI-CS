 Trade illegal, but tax relief legal

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: A person engaged in manufacture of contraband drugs can seek tax deductions for the loss arising out of confiscation of goods, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 A bench headed by Justice S.B. Sinha said even if a person carried on an illegal business, the loss arising out of seizure or confiscation of goods must be treated as a business loss while computing his income.

 The ruling came in a case in which income-tax authorities had added the value of 5 kg of heroin seized from a doctor to his total income.

 Dr T.A. Quereshi, who used to illegally manufacture heroin and other contraband drugs in his laboratory in Mandsaur district, claimed that as making heroin was his trade, the loss on account of seizure was an allowable deduction while calculating gains from his business.

 The tax tribunal allowed his plea and ordered a deduction of Rs 2 lakh from Quereshis total income. 

 Allowing an appeal by the income-tax department, Madras High Court rejected Quereshis claim on the ground that he was a doctor and the contraband heroin had nothing to do with his profession.

 The court pointed out that Section 37 of the Income Tax Act bars a person from seeking deductions for expenditures incurred for a purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by law.

 Such a person, the court said, could not be allowed to claim deduction as he is engaged in a heinous and illegal business which is not connected to his pious professional activity.

 The Supreme Court, however, felt that the high court had adopted an emotional and moral approach rather than a legal one. Cases had to be decided on legal principles and not on ones moral views, the court added.

 Justice Markandey Katju, who wrote the judgment for the bench, said Section 37 dealt with deductions with regard to business expenditure but the deduction claimed in the case at hand was for business loss.

 The court said the deduction claimed in the case at hand was for business loss.

 Once it is found that the heroin seized formed part of stock-in-trade of the assessee, it follows that the seizure and confiscation of such stock-in-trade has to be allowed as a business loss, it added.

 The interpretation means one can claim deductions for losses in an illegal business but not for expenditures incurred in illegal activities like giving bribes while carrying out a legal business.

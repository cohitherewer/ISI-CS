The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cry for tariff limit in non-CAS zones

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Broadcast regulator Trais notification fixing a maximum tariff for television channels under the conditional access system has had a ripple effect. Now, cable operators want a similar order for non-CAS areas.

 Roop Sharma, who heads the Cable Operators Federation of India, voiced the demand when he met Trai chairman Nripendra Misra.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), which doubles as the broadcast regulator, recently came up with a tariff order, saying viewers in areas where CAS is in place will pay no more than Rs 5 plus taxes a month for each channel. 

 Also, broadcasters will have to offer each of their channels individually and not in a bunch, forcing people to subscribe to all of them. 

 CAS will come into operation only from the beginning of next year in specific areas of Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai. Chennai already has CAS.

 Broadcasters are unhappy with the Trai order and are planning to go to the appellate authority over this. 

 But cable operators have welcomed it.

 They now want Trai to also fix a tariff ceiling for each channel in places that do not have CAS. 

 By that, they mean a cap on the prices the broadcasters charge operators.

 In the CAS zones, viewers pay for individual channels, while in the rest of the country, cable operators buy bundles of channels from broadcasters. 

 If the CAS tariff order is replicated in non-CAS areas, they, too, can pick the channels they want to beam.

 Sharma said the savings, made by skipping the less popular channels, would be passed on to the consumers. The flip side is that viewers will have less choice. 

 For example, when BBC World Service converted to a pay-channel from being a free-to-air one, cable operators stopped subscribing to it. In many areas, some viewers were willing to pay extra for it, but to no avail.

 Sonia cautions PM on trade pacts

 New Delhi, May 7 (PTI): The government bid to go in for more free trade agreements with Asian countries may run into rough weather with Congress president Sonia Gandhi asking Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to very carefully scrutinise India-Asean FTA to safeguard interests of domestic farmers.

 In a letter to Singh, the Congress chief said she was concerned about the FTAs being signed by the government as the countrys domestic agriculture sector was in distress, particularly in areas like edible oil, coffee, tea and pepper.

 The Congress party (therefore) feels that instead of opening up the agricultural and manufacturing sector through FTAs, more effective domestic policy measures need to be adopted to protect and strengthen the growers and manufacturers in these sectors, the letter said.

 Sonias opposition to FTAs comes at a time when the Prime Minister has advocated the need to go ahead with FTAs with several Asian countries in a bid to move towards a pan-Asean FTA.

 On May 3, the Prime Ministers trade and economic relations committee met to clear some of the thorny issues in the India-Asean FTA negotiations while approving PTA with Mauritius and South African customs union.

 Sonia said she was writing to Singh after bringing the matter to the notice of commerce minister Kamal Nath.

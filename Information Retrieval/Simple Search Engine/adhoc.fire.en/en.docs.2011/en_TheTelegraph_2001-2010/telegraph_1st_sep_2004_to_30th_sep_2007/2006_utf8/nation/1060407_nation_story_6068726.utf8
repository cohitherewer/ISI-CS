 Envoy rap

 New Delhi, April 6: The Indian ambassador in Abu Dhabi has got an earful from the ministry of external affairs for tagging a family function with the Republic Day reception at the embassy, reports our special correspondent.

 The Republic Day reception was scheduled for January 28 but was postponed to March 2.

 The guests were in for a surprise when they found the invitation card also asked them to attend a party for Bhandaris daughter and son-in-law. The matter was soon reported to the ministry. 

 The ambassador has unfortunately shown a lack of judgement in including a family event in the celebration of a formal national event. The ministry has issued a reprimand, said foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna.

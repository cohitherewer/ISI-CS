 Babu beeline for info act

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The Right to Information Act was introduced to help citizens fight corruption and know what bureaucrats are up to.

 But nine months after it came into force at the national level, guess who are using it the most? Those who had opposed it the most the babus themselves.

 Two information commissioners at the Central Information Commission (CIC) said appeals regarding promotions, demotions, transfers and salaries were the most common.

 While it is not possible to give the exact percentage of the appeals filed by government officials themselves, their appeals are without question the most in number, one of them said. The babus are the ones who know the act and the system the best, explained the other.

 Ordinary citizens are apparently not coming forward much with their grievances. The CIC thinks the reason could be lack of enough awareness about the act the Congress-led government introduced after a sustained campaign by Magsaysay award winner Aruna Roy. 

 But for some, the act is daunting, too. Take, for instance, the case of Mohammed Jamal Ansari, who braved through the RTI form without help to find out why the Delhi Development Authority wants to destroy the colony where he lives.

 According to the papers he has, the colony in south Delhis Okhla Industrial Area appears to have been built by the DDA itself.

 I sought information from the DDA, which I did not receive. I was advised to use the RTI (Act), but all the appeals and counter-appeals, apart from the legalities, are not easy for an ordinary person to deal with, Ansari said.

 Chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah is dealing with his case.

 The information commissioners feel the solution lies in investing more to spread awareness about the act.

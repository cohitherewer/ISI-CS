 Chicken death probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Scientists at the high-security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal are investigating the cause of death of several thousand chickens in Maharashtras Nandurbar district over the past week.

 The laboratory received six dead birds and many faecal samples on Saturday from animal husbandry authorities monitoring the outbreak in Nandurbar that has claimed at least 15,000 birds, director Hare Krishna Pradhan said.

 Four of the six birds appeared to have died of Mareks disease, a cancerous condition caused by a herpes-like virus in poultry, Pradhan said. Were analysing all the samples weve got, and hope to have a clearer picture by Wednesday morning.

 Pradhan said animal husbandry officials suspect the chickens died of Ranikhet, an infectious poultry disease caused by a virus. Three years ago, it had claimed more than 10,000 birds in north India, he said. 

 In the past year, the Bhopal laboratory has screened nearly 30,000 tissue and faecal samples from birds to rule out the H5N1 avian influenza virus.

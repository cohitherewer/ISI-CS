 Kasliwal

 Mumbai, March 28 (PTI): A sessions court today rejected the bail plea of textile scion Abhishek Kasliwal accused of raping a 52-year-old woman on March 11. 

 The petition was rejected by sessions judge D.D. Joshi, who agreed with the prosecution that the accused, being influential, was likely to tamper with witnesses if given bail.

 Senior prosecutor Madhukar Pawar said brain-mapping tests revealed that Kasliwal lied when police recorded his statement soon after his arrest.

 This is the second time the court has rejected Kasliwals bail plea. On March 17, a magistrate denied him bail. 

 According to the womans complaint, she was waiting at the Prince of Wales Museum at Colaba at 2.40 am when Kasliwal offered her a lift in his Mercedes. He allegedly raped her repeatedly in the car.

 Tax swoop on Jaya friends

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Jan. 18: An income-tax team from Delhi launched raids on people close to Jayalalithaa here today, heating up the political scene three months before the Assembly polls.

 A furious chief minister let go at arch-rival DMK in the Assembly, accusing it of setting up the raids through its man in the finance ministry (minister of state S.S. Palanimanikkam), and wondered whether they would be coming for her next.

 Even as I speak, raids are going on at the homes and offices of all those associated with me in some way or other, including my personal doctor and my chartered accountant, the ADMK chief announced before stunned MLAs. To her it was all part of a DMK plot to tarnish and humiliate her before the poll.

 I am vulgarly referred to as antha pommbalai (that woman) in conversations between the DMK chief (M. Karunanidhi) and the finance minister (P. Chidambaram), and between DMK leaders and their allies like PMKs S. Ramadoss, she alleged.

 State government sources said the Delhi team arrived unannounced in the morning, taking local tax officials by surprise, and immediately got down to business. The targets of their search and seizure operations included factories owned by the family of Sasikala, a close friend of the chief minister, besides the homes and offices of their associates and friends.

 The income-tax department had in recent weeks raided the homes of Tamil film stars, doctors and other professionals, but todays operation seemed a very large one under the direct instructions of Delhi, the sources said.

 Palanimanikkam told reporters in his constituency, Thanjavur, that there was no political vendetta in the raids: they were part of a nationwide crackdown.

 What crime could her personal physician or chartered accountant have committed, Jayalalithaa asked in the Assembly.

 Her party sources struggled to answer which physician she might be referring to, but later in the evening it appeared the person might be a Dr Bhaskar, whose house in Hyderabad was raided.

 Chartered accountant Natarajan, whose home was searched in Chennai, was auditing Jayalalithaas personal accounts and is a director of Midas Distillery Ltd, some of whose units were raided.

 The pressure exerted by Karunanidhi and Palanimanikkam for action against me has been so intense that they (the tax officials) would have come to my house today itself, Jayalalithaa said.

 But the departments officials in Chennai had stood firm, saying a raid on the residence of a serving chief minister is unheard of? and hence we will not do it.

 So far, they have not come; but tomorrow I do not know what will happen.

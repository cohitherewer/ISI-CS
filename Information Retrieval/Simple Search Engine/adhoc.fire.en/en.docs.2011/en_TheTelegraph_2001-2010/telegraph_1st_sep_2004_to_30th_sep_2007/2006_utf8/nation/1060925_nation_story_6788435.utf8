 Miya-biwi razi, no sight of qazi

 Hyderabad, Sept. 24: If the bride and groom are willing, what can a qazi do to stop the marriage, asks a popular rhyme.

 Well, he can just vanish. 

 Ask Aisha Khan of Shalibanda, Hyderabad. The qazis failure to turn up has wrecked the 20-year-olds dream of marrying her American fiance before Ramazan.

 Now she must wait six months before the software engineer can manage another trip to Hyderabad, or agree to him saying qubool on the phone, thus missing out on all the colour and fun of a traditional Muslim wedding.

 Aisha isnt alone. Scores of Muslim weddings in Andhra Pradesh are stalled because of a shortage of qazis to conduct them. The certificate of a qazi an expert in Islamic jurisprudence relating to marriage and divorce is necessary for a marriage to stand up in court.

 The interior towns and villages are the worst hit, for the huge demand confines qazis to the cities.

 Shaheen, 23, a schoolteacher in Warangal, missed her nikah with Mohammed Fareeduddin by just five hours as the qazi didnt turn up on time and the groom returned to Chennai.

 At the root of the problem is the Qazi Act of 1880 that still governs the institution in the state. Based on the then population of Muslims, the Nizams administration had fixed the number of qazis at 111. Each qazi had five to six naib (deputy) qazis, but they couldnt legalise a nikah on their own.

 In 1880, the princely state of Hyderabad had 3.4 lakh Muslims, and so the arrangement worked out fine with one qazi for every 3,000 Muslims. In 2006, that ratio stands at one qazi per 63,000 Muslims.

 One problem is that the qazis have turned the post into a hereditary one, with fathers handing the job down to their sons, say the naib qazis. The deputies want the number of qazis increased and a chance to graduate from assistant to full-fledged qazi.

 At a recent meeting, the naib qazis formed a forum under the leadership of Ghousuddin to fight the injustice to them.

 Ghousuddin said there should be one qazi for every 50,000 Muslims. He added that Hyderabad has just 32 qazis for its 28 lakh Muslim residents.

 We need a minimum of 100 for the city, said Qazi Kareemuddin, a forum member.

 The forum also wants a hike in fees. Qazis now charge Rs 210 as fee (Rs 120 for the qazi and Rs 90 for the naib qazi), Rs 60 for the certificate and another Rs 50 as travel expenses.

 This is peanuts and drives the qazis to conduct Arab and child marriages, for which Hyderabad has become notorious, said Maulana Badruddin, a qazi from Nizamabad.

 The forum wants a minimum of Rs 200 for the qazi, Rs 175 for the assistant, Rs 50 as price of the certificate and Rs 100 towards travel.

 The families maynt mind paying a bit more as long as a qazi is available.

 Finding a good groom is difficult enough; now the shortage of qazis has made matters worse, said Begum Rahmannussa, a socialite and social worker.

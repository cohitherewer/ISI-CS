 Shelter before ouster for poor

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Singur, July 2: The state government has decided not to evict farmers living below the poverty line from their homes while acquiring land for an industrial project before providing them with an alternative home or a plot to build a shelter.

 A land and land reforms department order in this regard was sent to the district magistrates late last month.

 Observers said the move is aimed at giving a human face to land acquisition for industries.

 A land department official said all farmers will also be allowed to continue cultivation on the acquired land till the authorities of the new project notify them in advance when the actual possession of the land will take place. 

 Land and land reforms secretary Sukumar Das, who issued the order, asked the district magistrates to plan in advance for resettlement and rehabilitation of possible evictees who live below the poverty line. 

 The land acquisition collector shall not take possession of land owned and occupied by any (below poverty line) family for its residential purpose by physical eviction? until they are provided with the basic mandatory rehabilitation and resettlement packages, the order says. 

 According to the package, such families in villages are entitled to two cottahs of land or a house, and in urban areas, flats or Rs 25,000 besides transportation support of Rs 2,000. 

 The order asks the land-requiring bodies to start construction of houses or acquire land for the resettlement of the families to be evicted immediately after the notice for land acquisition has been served.... 

 Farmers can continue cultivation until actual work on the project begins. If its authorities cant wait till harvesting, they have to compensate the farmers for the crop lost, an official said.

 At Singur in Hooghly, 40 km from Calcutta, where the Tatas want to make their Rs 1-lakh car plant, the CPM peasants wing organised a convention today to motivate farmers to give away their plots voluntarily. 

 District CPM secretary Binod Das, also the Krishak Sabha president in Hooghly, and Anil Basu, MP and secretary of the farmers union, asked nearly 1,000 farmers present to decide whether they wanted Singur to develop.

 At Bajemelia village, where Tata officials on a recce had been gheraoed earlier, Basu said: If the Tatas come here, the poor will get job opportunities, the educated can set up down-stream industries. But first you have to decide whether you want that.

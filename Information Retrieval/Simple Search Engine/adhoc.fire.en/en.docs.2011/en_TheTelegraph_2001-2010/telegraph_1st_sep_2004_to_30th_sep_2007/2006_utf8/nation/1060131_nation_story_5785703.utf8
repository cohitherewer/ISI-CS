 Rabri finds date for house shift

 Patna: Bihars most famous couple has finally found a suitable day for vacating 1 Anne Marg, the chief ministers official residence, reports our special correspondent. 

 Leader of Opposition Rabri Devi, allotted the 10 Circular Road bungalow, will make the long-awaited move on Basant Panchami, which falls on February 2.

 After consulting astrologers, the family has decided to shift to the 10 Circular Road house, said a source close to Rabri Devis family.

 The former chief minister and her husband Lalu Prasad had earlier indicated that they would vacate the bungalow any time after the inauspicious month of Kharmaas, which ended on January 14.

 Chief minister Nitish Kumar had said the Rashtriya Janata Dal chiefs family could take all the time it needed to move out of the bungalow.

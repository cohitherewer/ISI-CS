 Arjun acts, boy at IIT 

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 18: Balaram Tudu, 

 a tribal boy from Orissa whose academic career had almost 

 been destroyed by a postal delay, has found a lifeline.

 Tudu, from Mayurbhanj district, was at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur today after being taken into the preparatory course which could lead to admission to the IIT a year later.

 Tudus admission to the preparatory course would not have been possible without the intervention of the beleaguered human resource development minister Arjun Singh.

 Under attack on the streets and on campuses from anti-quota groups for introducing reservation for other backward classes, this act of kindness could earn Singh unqualified goodwill.

 The HRD minister asked us to consider the case of Balaram Tudu sympathetically. We considered it as a special case, said S.K. Dube, the director of IIT Kharagpur.

 The IIT has 42 seats for the preparatory course but increased it by one to make place for Tudu.

 Tudu had ranked 83rd for the preparatory course, but missed the chance to enrol as the communication carrying the information did not reach him on time. 

 By the time he learnt, it was too late. The IIT authorities said they would stick to the rulebook and kept Tudu outside the classroom. 

 The boy complained to the district authorities against the postal department.

 Singh, who sees himself as a messiah of students from backward sections, stepped in at this point. He asked the joint entrance examination (JEE) admission board to treat Tudus case with sympathy.

 The request swung opinion in the admission board to the boys favour. 

 Singh, however, has not stopped just with his intervention for Tudu. He has asked the IITs to put in place a mechanism that prevents such incidents in future.

 The preparatory course is held for SC/ST students who do not qualify for admission through JEE.

 Students who qualify for the preparatory course do a one-year course in physics, chemistry and mathematics. They are admitted to the main IIT course after they secure the minimum prescribed marks at the end of the preparatory programme.

 Singh has suggested that the IIT brochures disseminating information about the institution should also carry information about the preparatory course, the deadline for declaration of the results and the dates of counselling. 

 At present, IIT brochures provide detailed information only for all-India rank holders. 

 The HRD minister has also suggested that information about the date of counselling should be sent to district magistrates, collectors and deputy commissioners.

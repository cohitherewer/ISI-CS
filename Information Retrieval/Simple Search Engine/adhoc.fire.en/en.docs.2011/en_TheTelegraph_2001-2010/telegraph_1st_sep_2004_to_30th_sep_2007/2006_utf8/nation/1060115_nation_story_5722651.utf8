 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Pramod Mahajan turned Atal Bihari Vajpayees 1,000th full-moon sighting into a gala public event, but even the super-efficient BJP event manager ? a title he has assumed since the success of the partys Mumbai conclave ? could not get Sonia Gandhi to attend.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, enthralled by a recital by Pandit Jasraj, saved the evening for his host. A classical music enthusiast and a veena player himself, Kalam made several requests for bhajans and ragas and the maestro happily obliged.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrived much later than scheduled, having been held back by an emergency meeting on the Ottavio Quattrocchi issue.

 Sonia had not consented to come despite persistent efforts but she did send a letter congratulating Vajpayee, who has turned 80. Several guests seemed to believe she declined the invitation because it was extended by Mahajan. After all, he had likened her to a certain White House intern and called her children unmentionable names. The BJP leader, however, denies it all now.

 But maybe she was genuinely busy, said a guest. Perhaps, but that still did not explain a near-total absence of Congress leaders ? except for the Prime Minister and home minister Shivraj Patil.

 The Sahasra Chandra Darshan (Sighting of the 1,000th moon) was a birthday celebration for Vajpayee on Makar Sankranti, a full moon night. It is believed that by the time a man turns 80, he gets to see 1,000 full moons. Mahajan presented a souvenir to Vajpayee engraved with a Hindi poem on one side and a Sanskrit couplet on the other.

 While the opening stanza was a reminder of the 1,000 moons, the poem is a depiction of the Ramayans Laxman, an epithet Vajpayee bestowed on Mahajan in Mumbai. The couplet mentioned Hanuman and Parashuram. Incidentally, the BJPs Hanuman, a name former party president M. Venkaiah Naidu chooses to call himself by, was missing.

 Most Left leaders excused themselves. As did BSP leader Mayavati and DMK chief M. Karunanidhi. But Vajpayee did not seem to miss the absentees as he took in the soothing music and was treated to mouth-watering vegetarian fare.

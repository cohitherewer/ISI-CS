 Two more land in blasts net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 25: Two youths suspected to have links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba were detained by Mumbai police today in connection with the 7/11 train blasts.

 They are likely to be arrested tonight, police sources said.

 Identified as Zamir Sheikh and Sohail Sheikh, the duo was picked up by the crime branch a few days ago. 

 They were handed over to the anti-terrorist squad, the main investigating agency in the serial explosions on July 11, today. 

 A senior ATS officer said: As of now, we have detained them. They are likely to be arrested soon.

 Police sources said Zamir was a graduate from a Mumbai college and owned a key-making shop in central Mumbai, while Sohail was from Pune and had worked briefly in West Asia. 

 The duo had reportedly travelled to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir last year on the pretext of a pilgrimage and had allegedly attended a Lashkar training camp to learn handling explosives and sophisticated weapons.

 The police sources claimed they were close to Tanvir Ahmed Ansari, a unani practitioner who was arrested yesterday. 

 ATS officials claimed Ansari had attended a similar Lashkar training camp in 2004 and was part of the terror groups sleeper cells in Mumbai.

 2000-year ceremony for relics of Buddha

 Mumbai, Oct. 29 (Reuters): Thousands of Buddhists gathered here today to lay to rest part of the ashes and bones of Buddha in a ceremony resurrected after almost 2,000 years.

 Monks in flowing orange robes chanted hymns from scriptures as the remains were lowered into a shallow pit on top of a 90-ft-high stone dome, as part of celebrations to mark the 2,550th anniversary of his enlightenment.

 Organisers of the ceremony said this was the first time in around 2,000 years that Buddhas mortal remains were being enshrined.

 The relics now kept in this magnificent pagoda came from an ancient dome discovered during an archaeological expedition in south India in the early 1900s, acharya S.N. Goenka told reporters.

 After Buddhas death, his remains were divided and kept in eight separate domes built by his disciples across Asia. They were later taken by Buddhist convert emperor Asoka, who placed them in smaller domes about 2,000 years ago.

 The remains enshrined today were found in an ancient pagoda in south India in 1920 and have been kept in a Buddhist monastery for over 85 years before being handed over for enshrining.

 The Buddhists, some of whom came from other parts of the world, including the US, Britain, Australia and Cambodia, sat in meditation inside the dome, which can accommodate 8,000 people, many looking up in the direction of the roof where the remains lay.

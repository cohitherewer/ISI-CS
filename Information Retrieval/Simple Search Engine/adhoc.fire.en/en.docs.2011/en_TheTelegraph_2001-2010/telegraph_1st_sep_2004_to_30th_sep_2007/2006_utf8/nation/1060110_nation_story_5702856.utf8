 Toyota truce talks fail to start

 New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): Peace talks between the management of Toyota Kirloskar Motors and its striking employees failed to take off today after company officials refused to go to the labour department office citing security concerns.

 The situation outside the labour department is very tense as around 400 workers are shouting slogans against the management. We feel that sufficient police presence is not there and thus have requested for the adjournment of the meeting, general manager (corporate planning division) A.R. Shankar said from Bangalore.

 The two sides were to meet the deputy labour commissioner to end the impasse arising out of the companys refusal to reinstate three dismissed employees. Company workers have been on strike since Friday and the management decl-ared an indefinite lockout yesterday.

 We do not compromise on discipline, Shankar said. Asked about production losses, Shankar said the company is capable of recovering once the situation normalises.

 The management has requested the labour department to fix another day for the meeting when it can be held in a congenial atmosphere.

 The Citu-affiliated Toyota Kirloskar union has dubbed the managements failure to turn up for the talks a ploy to evade the issue.

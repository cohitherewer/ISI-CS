 Gowda

 New Delhi, Jan. 8 (PTI): H.D. Deve Gowda today met senior BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee and is understood to have discussed the political situation in his state, Karnataka.

 The 30-minute one-to-one between the former Prime Ministers assumes significance as Gowda is reportedly upset with the Congresss attitude towards his party, the Janata Dal (S), a partner in the states ruling coalition, sources said.

 A faction of the state Congress is reportedly in favour of striking an alliance with Gowdas arch rival Siddaramaiah, who parted ways with the Dal (S) and floated his own party.

 BJP sources, however, refused to confirm whether the meeting took place.

 Gowda skips sons bash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Feb. 3: Janata Dal (Secular) rebel leader H.D. Kumaraswamy was today sworn in as Karnataka chief minister on the steps of Vidhana Soudha, the states seat of power, in a ceremony watched by thousands of ecstatic supporters who had crowded into the buildings lawns and the road in front. 

 The BJPs B.S. Yediyurappa was sworn in as deputy chief minister. 

 After moving into his office on the buildings third floor, Kumaraswamy said he would move a vote of confidence on February 8 and only then expand his ministry. Although his focus would be on rural development, he would not ignore Bangalores infrastructure woes and the information technology sector.

 The new partners expressed confidence that they have the support of close to 140 MLAs, well above the halfway mark of 113. They have agreed that 18 ministers will be from the BJP and 16 from the Dal (S). Kumaraswamy will have to give way to Yediyurappa after 20 months. 

 This is the first time that the BJP is forming a government south of the Vindhyas. On an earlier occasion, it had supported the Ramakrishna Hegde government from outside.

 The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the 2004 elections but did not get majority, and the Congress and the Dal (S) teamed up to form the Dharam Singh government. Last month, Kumaraswamy walked out of the Congress-led coalition with the bulk of the Dal (S) legislators and joined hands with the BJP. 

 Kumaraswamy, who took over as the states 18th chief minister, was administered the oath of office and secrecy by governor T.N. Chaturvedi. 

 Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who had opposed his son and followers joining hands with the BJP, was conspicuous by his absence. Kumaraswamy expressed regret that his family members were not present. 

 BJP chief Rajnath Singh and former president M. Venkaiah Naidu, who helped stitch up the coalition, attended the swearing-in. Rajnath said the two parties would follow coalition dharma.

 Islamabad, June 18 (PTI): State-run Pakistan Television (PTV) is all set to script history by holding a nine-hour telethon with 20 top Bollywood stars this month to raise funds for victims of the October 8 earthquake.

 Sridevi, Amisha Patel, Shilpa Shetty, Neha Dhupia, Zeenat Aman, Jackie Shroff, Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, Aftab Shivdasani, Dino Morea, Celina Jaitley and Raza Murad are among the stars who have confirmed participation in the event scheduled for June 25, PTV marketing director Khawar Azhar said here today. Boney Kapoor, Dalip Tahil, Prem Chopra and Gulshan Grover will also take part.

 Efforts are on to bring legendary Bollywood couple Dilip Kumar and Saira Banu for the programme, Azhar said. 

 The Indian stars would be flown to Karachi by a special Pakistan International Airline flight, to be named Mughal-e-Azam after the movie which recently earned the distinction of being the first Indian film allowed to be screened in Pakistani theatres.

 A PTV team would also record interviews of the artistes on the flight while their arrival would be covered live, Azhar said. 

 PTV has built a special Rs 30-lakh set featuring Mughal architecture as the venue for the programme. The income generated would be donated to the special quake relief fund set up by President Pervez Musharraf, he said. 

 The producer of the digitally-restored version of Mughal-e-Azam would host a dinner in honour of the guests in Karachi on June 24 with tickets to the dinner priced at Rs 40,000 each, Azhar said.

This is perhaps the first time in its history that 

PTV will feature Indian filmstars and Indian films.

 Neighbour learns from Gujarat demolition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 18: A fleet of bulldozers is tiptoeing towards 100 illegal shrines in the city, a fortnight after a similar demolition drive sparked communal riots in Vadodara.

 The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is keeping the operation ? it began yesterday ? quiet to avoid a repeat of Gujarat. The target is to raze by next week at least 100 of the 600 illegal shrines earmarked for demolition before monsoon sets in.

 We want to avoid a Gujarat-like situation here. We are doing it along with the monsoon work, without any fanfare, said a ward officer.

 Plainclothes policemen are accompanying us on these demolition drives, and we are going ahead with the demolitions only after a meeting with community representatives who are associated with these shrines. But still, we are very tense, said Ganesh Kale, who works in a ward in Muslim-dominated Byculla.

 The drive was triggered by a letter from an NGO, Janhit Manch, which alleged that 600 shrines were rebuilt in the city after their demolition following a high court order in 2003. 

 The BMC had released a circular, supported by Bombay High Court, in 2003, listing 1,356 illegal shrines in the city.

 The circular advises ward officers to take priests, trustees, representatives and local residents into confidence before pulling down a shrine. 

 Municipal commissioner Johny Joseph said a building is razed after constant checking and cross-checking of the date of its construction, as all shrines built before 1964 are considered legal.

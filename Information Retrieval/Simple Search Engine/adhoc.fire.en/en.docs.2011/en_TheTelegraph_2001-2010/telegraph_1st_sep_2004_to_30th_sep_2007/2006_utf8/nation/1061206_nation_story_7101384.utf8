 Mittal club deal finalised

Sofia, Dec. 5 (Reuters): Steel magnate Pramod Mittal was confirmed today as Bulgarian premier league club CSKA Sofias new owner.

 The purchase of CSKA was officially announced by previous owner Vasil Bozhkovs representative in a statement, which followed Mittals adviser Alexandar Tomovs disclosure of negotiations for acquisition of the club yesterday.

 As a personal PR of Vasil Bozhkov I am authorised to inform that the negotiations for the sale of a 100 per cent stake of CSKA were finalised on December 4, said Irina Sarachinova. Pramod Mittal is the new owner of CSKA.

 Pramod Mittal (in picture), together with his brother Vinod Mittal, run the steel giant Global Steel Holdings, which controls 71 per cent of Bulgarian steel mill Kremikovtzi. 

 The pair are the younger brothers of Lakshmi Mittal, fifth in forbes.coms list of worlds richest people, with a net worth of $23.5 billion.

 The acquisition of the 30-times Bulgarian champions has increased speculation that a new coach will take the helm.

 A club official, who wished to remain anonymous, told reporters that talks had been held with former England coaches Sven-Goran Eriksson and Bobby Robson.

 CSKA coach Plamen Markov, who replaced Yesic in April, said he was uncertain of his future.

 I have no idea what will happen with me, he said.It will be clear in the next few days.

 CSKA are second in the standings with 37 points from 15 matches, two points behind bitter city rivals Levski. The Bulgarian championship will resume after the winter break.

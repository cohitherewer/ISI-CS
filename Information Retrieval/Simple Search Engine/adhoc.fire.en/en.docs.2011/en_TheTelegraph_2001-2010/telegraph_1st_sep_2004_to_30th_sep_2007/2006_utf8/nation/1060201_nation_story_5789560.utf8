 How to make sense of nuclear cloud

 the iran muddle 

 Following are key issues in the Iran debate as the UN nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, prepares to hold a crisis session on Thursday.

 What is Iran really after?

 The Islamic republic says it wants nuclear energy only to help power its economy. Iran says it has every right to it as a signatory to the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which mandates a solely peaceful use of atomic energy.

 Western powers suspect a clandestine Iranian atomic bomb programme is under way because Tehran concealed potentially bomb-related nuclear research from the IAEA for 18 years until 2003 and frequently parried investigators since then.

 Independent analysts see the truth as in-between Iranian protestations and Western conclusions. 

 They believe Iran may be trying to master the intricate technologies required for bombs before deciding, based on strategic considerations, whether to actually build them, since Tehran is estimated to be anywhere from two to more than 10 years away from that threshold. 

 Does Iran really need nuclear technology?

 Iran says it needs an alternative energy source to oil and gas, much of which is exported to earn hard currency. Iranians regard nuclear technology as a matter of national pride, noting that it is a pillar of economies in developed nations. 

 Western leaders say Iran is so rich in fossil fuels that for it to pursue costly nuclear technology makes no economic sense and the only rationale must be covert bomb production.

 lWould Iran threaten world peace if it got the bomb?

 Washington and EU states say it would, given President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads call for Israel to be wiped off the map, dismissal of the Holocaust as a myth and what western officials say is Irans sponsorship of Islamic terrorism.

 Critics of western policy suggest Iran may have legitimate security fears, enclosed by countries with US troops stationed by an administration wedded to regime change in enemy states. According to this view, a nuclear arsenal would assure Iran does not end up like US-occupied Iraq, and Iran would be unlikely to unleash nuclear warheads at Israel because of the certainty of a devastating Israeli or US response.

 Would UN security council action be legal?

 The West argues the IAEA is legally bound to transfer Irans dossier to the Security Council, saying Iran is a serial NPT violator for having covered up atomic work and delayed or evaded inquiries. They call Irans resumption of nuclear fuel development, after a two-year moratorium agreed with the EU, a red line justifying referral to the Council.

 Iran contends there is no legal basis for Security Council referral or sanctions. Some analysts agree, noting the IAEA has to date found no hard proof Iran is building bombs, only hints of a wish to do so. 

 lIs Iran being fairly treated by nuclear arbiters?

 Non-westerners perceive a crisis rife with double standards. They ask how developing states would not be motivated to pursue nuclear prowess when:

 The original nuclear powers ? the US, Britain, France, Russia and China ? have fallen short of NPT commitments to do away with their arsenals, keeping them as pillars of security policy and their predominance on the world stage.

 Israel, India and Pakistan ? all with good relations with the West ? refused to join the NPT, secretly developed atomic bombs and face no pressure to dismantle them.

 Where is the crisis going?

 On Tuesday, the five permanent veto-wielding powers in the Security Council plus Germany agreed on a resolution to urge the IAEA to report to the Council on what Iran must do to comply. But in a bow to Russian-Chinese insistence on caution, the six powers ruled out Council action ? beyond a possible debate ? until after the next regular IAEA board on March 6.

 However, the six powers resolution looks likely to obtain a comfortable majority at the IAEA gathering after being toned down to reassure board members who feared Security Council involvement now would swiftly escalate the crisis.

 If the Council runs out of diplomatic options, possible sanctions could range from travel curbs on government officials to a full trade embargo. But the latter looks improbable in the near term since losing Iranian oil would damage the world economy. Iran is the no. 4 oil exporter.

 The US and Israel have hinted at military action as a last resort.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Jaya flung off roller coaster, sops amp; all

Amma undone minus proper tie-up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, May 11: Outbid in the sop war and negligent of forming tie-ups, Jayalalithaa was toppled from power by a formidable DMK alliance today after a roller coaster ride at Tamil Nadus helm.

 Five years after the traumatic midnight when he was dragged away from his home by Ammas police, M. Karunanidhi was celebrating at noon as an anti-incumbency wave lifted him towards a fifth stint as chief minister at age 82.

 But though his Democratic Progressive Alliance enjoyed a two-thirds majority with 163 of the 234 seats, Karunanidhis own party fell short of the halfway mark of 118, finishing with 96. 

 Among the allies, the Congress did exceptionally well, winning 34 of the 48 it contested, while the PMK bagged 18, the CPM 9 and the CPI 6.

 Personally, Karunanidhi continued his amazing run of 11 straight victories in Assembly polls, retaining Chepauk by a margin of 8,522 votes.

 Jayalalithaas ADMK, however, did better than many pollsters had predicted, winning 60 seats while allies MDMK and Dalit Panthers of India notched up 6 and 2. Amma herself was re-elected from Andipatti with a huge 25,000-vote margin.

 Her biggest undoing seems to have been the failure to be a bit more accommodating and cobble together a convincing coalition.

 She let slip a chance to strike a deal with a recharged Forward Bloc, led by the young and glamorous film star, Karthik. The Bloc cut into her Thevar vote bank in Madurai and Ramanathapuram, where the DMK picked up several seats.

 The Desiya Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam, floated by another actor, Vijaykant, hurt the ADMK by wooing away crucial Dalit and first-time voters. The new party, though, bagged only one seat with Vijaykant winning from Viruddhachalam by 13,000 votes.

 The DMK also led in the freebie battle. Its offer of free colour TV sets, which promised the poor womenfolk some relief after the days drudgery, was apparently a bigger hit than Jayalalithaas last-minute sop of free computers to plus II graduates.

 The farmers, too, decided that Karunanidhi, with his powerful central allies, was better placed than Amma to carry out his pledge to waive all their cooperative loans. 

 Karunanidhi has now more clout with the Centre. He will be able to give us the much-needed debt relief, a farmer had told The Telegraph during the campaign.

 In the end, Union finance minister P. Chidambarams quip that the DMK manifesto ? the partys litany of promises ? would be the hero of the election proved prophetic.

 The negative votes seem to have come from the 12 lakh state government employees and teachers, left shocked by a crackdown three years ago when Jayalalithaa sacked 1.70 lakh of them at one stroke during a strike.

 They were reinstalled, but would have felt a shiver again when she fired 10,000 agitating road workers a few months ago. Secretariat staff were bursting crackers today to celebrate the DMK win.

 A former DMK minister reckoned that Jayalalithaa would have lost 60 lakh votes if the government employees families averaged five votes against her.

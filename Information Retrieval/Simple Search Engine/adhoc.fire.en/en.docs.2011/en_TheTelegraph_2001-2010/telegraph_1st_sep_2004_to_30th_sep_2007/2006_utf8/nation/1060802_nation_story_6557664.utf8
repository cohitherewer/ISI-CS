 BJP, Left in nuke huddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: The BJP today held prolonged parleys with the Left to work out the sense of Parliament on the nuclear deal.

 Although the party is insisting on a resolution and the Left is not very rigid on the semantics of the sense of Parliament, efforts are on to reach a compromise. 

 Former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, however, said the BJP would bring out a resolution on its own if all parties fail to coordinate on the issue.

 The Left, on the other hand, is eager to spell out a sense of the House that draws the broad parameters within which the nuclear deal is negotiated. 

 The expression of the sense of the House need not necessarily be a resolution. The government has made it clear it does not want a resolution. However, the BJP is still trying to get all parties, including the Left and the Congress, to come around to the idea of a resolution.

 Sinha met CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury this afternoon to discuss the issue. After the meeting, Sinha said he was hopeful of a positive result. 

 The sense I get from the Left is that they are still keen on a resolution. Even Congress MPs have expressed their consent. Let us see what comes of it, he said.

 Earlier in a news conference, Sinha asserted that the nuclear deal was not in national interest and the party would bring a resolution on its own if there was no consensus with the Left. Sinha said the pact was aimed at capping, freezing and stifling Indias nuclear programme. 

 He said the BJP has identified 14 areas where goalposts have been shifted by the US.

 We are trying for a unanimous resolution. But even if no unanimity emerges, the BJP is determined to bring the resolution. Parliament cannot remain a mute spectator to the mortgaging of Indias strategic interests by this government. Parliament ought to assert, he said.

 The proposed resolution, he said, would call for listing all the assurances that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has made to Parliament on the deal. Accusing the UPA of allowing the US to shift goalposts from the July 18 agreement, Sinha said it was imperative that parameters are drawn for negotiating the deal. 

 The US is imposing conditions with greater rigidity on us. If we cannot get rid of these conditionalities, we should reject the deal outright, he said. 

 The BJP has already said a future government can abrogate the deal if India deviates from the July 18 agreement.

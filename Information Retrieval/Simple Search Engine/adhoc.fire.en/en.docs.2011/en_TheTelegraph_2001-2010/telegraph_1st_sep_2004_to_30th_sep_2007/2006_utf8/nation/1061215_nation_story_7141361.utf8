 Kerala shut, not IT 

 - Tale of two strikes: One that crippled a state and the other which hit homes

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 14: Left-ruled Kerala today witnessed a near-total strike but, as in Bengal, the IT industry worked almost normally.

 Most techies came to office with police escort, marking a difference with Bengal where companies brought staff before the strike began at 6 am or arranged for their overnight stay on Wednesday.

 Nearly 6,000 of the 10,000 employees reported for work at Technopark here one of the first two software parks set up in the country but only a very small number of them had stayed back the previous night. Other IT parks in the state capital and Kochi, too, were unaffected.

 Police escorted vehicles carrying techies within a 15-km radius of Technopark. It helped that many of them live near their workplace.

 Unlike Salt Lakes Sector V, located in the middle of a coveted residential zone, Technopark came up on virgin territory where a residual economy of rented property, restaurants and shops sprang up solely because of the infotech industry.

 This has enabled many young IT employees to find affordable accommodation not far from their offices. Besides, the Kerala capital is much smaller than Calcutta, making it easier for the government to handle the logistics.

 All other sectors were paralysed with even ministers joining in the strike. Attendance at the secretariat fell below 10 per cent.

 Showing solidarity with the strikers, ministers walked to the chief ministers residence for a cabinet meeting. Home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan then walked 2 km to the residence of Opposition leader Oommen Chandy to consult him on a commission probing custody deaths.

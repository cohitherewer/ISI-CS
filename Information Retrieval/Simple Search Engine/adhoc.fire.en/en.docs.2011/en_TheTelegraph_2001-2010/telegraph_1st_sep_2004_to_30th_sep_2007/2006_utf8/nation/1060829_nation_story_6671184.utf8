 Promises on paper for engineers family

 Hyderabad, Aug. 28: The 

 daughters of K. Suryanarayana, the telecom engineer killed 

 by the Taliban in April, have had to drop out of school 

 because the family hasnt received a paisa of the promised 

 Rs 20-lakh compensation.

 Suryanarayanas wife Manjula says the government, after building the victim up almost as a martyr, had cooled off towards the family as soon as allegations of adultery surfaced against him.

 The state and the Centre had each pledged Rs 5 lakh while Suryanarayanas Bahraini employer, the Al Moyaed telecom company, was to pay Rs 10 lakh.

 I have knocked on the doors of the chief ministers house and also the secretariat. But I didnt get an appointment. The company refuses to accept any claims. Even the Prime Ministers Office hasnt responded, Manjula told a local TV channel.

 When chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy visited her home after the news of her husbands murder in Afghanistan was confirmed, he had said: The entire nation has condemned the barbaric incident and everybody in Andhra Pradesh feels it as a personal tragedy.

 But after a second wife, G. Swapna, surfaced with the demand for a share of the compensation for herself and her one-year-old child, allegedly fathered by Suryanarayana, the Centre withdrew the offer of a state funeral for the slain engineer.

 The state government and even many friends stayed away from the 13th-day ritual.

 Swapnas claims shook the family, too, with Manjula attempting suicide by drinking acid. A month later, when Swapna began a fast before the house to force the family to accept her, the engineers father, K. Chandrasekhar, suffered a heart attack.

 Manjula was discharged in July but her father-in-law is still in hospital.

 My daughters have stopped going to their convent school because I cant afford the fees any more, Manjula said. Anisha and Manisha studied in class IX and V; their toddler brother Satyateja is too young to go to school.

 Suryanarayana

 A state law ministry official 

 explained, We are unable to decide on compensation 

 and grant of job because of the controversy and the claims 

 by his two families.

 Swapna has approached a family court for a stay on payment of compensation to Manjula but her petition hasnt been admitted yet. She had earlier filed a police complaint staking claim to a share of the money and Suryanarayanas properties but was advised to settle the matter in court.

 The police told her if her claim was correct, both she and Suryanarayana were guilty of a criminal offence by marrying illegally.

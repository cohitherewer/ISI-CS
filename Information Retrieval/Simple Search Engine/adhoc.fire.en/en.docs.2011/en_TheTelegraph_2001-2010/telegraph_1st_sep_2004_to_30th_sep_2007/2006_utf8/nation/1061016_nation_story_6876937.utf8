 Mohali rolls up Pak red carpet

 - Terror shadow prompts cricket visa cut

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Whos prying?

 Chandigarh, Oct. 15: A rousing receptions not what Pakistani fans will get when they arrive in Mohali to watch their teams match against New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy on October 25 and South Africa two days later. But they can safely be assured of many prying eyes.

 Unlike the India-Pakistan Test last year, when fans were accorded VIP treatment the Punjab Cricket Association and the state government showered freebies on them all the way there will be no sweet welcome with jalebis.

 We have asked the Centre to grant only about 1,000 visas for the two matches. They can apply for the semi-final also, but they will have to do so right at the beginning. We are working with Punjab Tourism Corporation on a package tour for the fans for Mohali, Chandigarh and Panchkula. The Centre could increase the number of visas, but only marginally, additional director-general of police (intelligence) Chandra Shekhar said. 

 Of the 2,754 Pakistanis who crossed the Wagah border to watch the Test last year, 25 went missing. While 16 have been traced, the whereabouts of nine are still not known. Some are believed to have been involved in the terror attack on Bangalores Indian Institute of Science on December 28 last year.

 Those desirous of watching the one-day international in Mohali can only come on the package tour. They will stay in hotels we earmark for them and will be kept under surveillance. Under no circumstance, will their visas be extended to other cities like Agra, as had happened last year, Shekhar explained.

 The Union home ministry, taking a stern view of Pakistani fans who have gone missing, has asked Punjab police to step up surveillance during the Champions Trophy matches. 

 Even Pakistani journalists will be watched. We will be watching ever step they take and every move they make. They will be escorted from Wagah by the police a day before the match and taken back to the border the morning after the match, Shekhar said.

 A Punjab Cricket Association official also spoke of a low-key welcome so no bhangra on arrival, and no free lodging, either.

 Mohali itself appears to be in a less generous mood this time round. Last year, shopkeepers refused to take money from Pakistani fans for purchases, and many who could not get hotels were put up by locals in their homes, free. 

 Terror, too, appears to have put off some good samaritans. 

 We are not against the Pakistanis coming here. But reports that some could be involved in attacks has made us wary this time, said Surinder Bedi, a shopkeeper.

 Tighter check on defence spend 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The defence ministry has tightened accountability for armed forces headquarters two months after giving financial powers to the army, navy and the air force and told them that they will be subject to a rigid internal audit system.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee also told the consultative committee to his ministry today that in 2005-06 (last fiscal), the defence accounts department had made payments worth Rs 1,00,000 crore despite being understaffed. 

 This huge expenditure confirms that India is one of the biggest spenders on military wherewithal in the world. But not all the money has gone into buying equipment. A large amount has gone towards paying pensions to nearly 21 lakh ex-servicemen.

 Mukherjee told the committee internal audit mechanisms were being strengthened and the defence accounts department has been asked to imbibe the best international practices to audit accounts. He said the department is likely to review the oversight system.

 The new audit norms follow a July 27 order that empowered the headquarters of the army, navy, air force and the Defence Research and Development Organisation to sanction funds up to 70 per cent of the revenue budget that covers salaries of armed forces personnel and running expenses of the military. The revenue budget for the current year totals Rs 51,542 crore.

 Financial powers of the forces were enhanced on repeated requests from service headquarters despite serious allegations of misuse of funds. In July itself, the minister opened investigations into deals struck by a lieutenant general and a major general.

 The July 27 order came with the rider that greater financial powers must lead to improved operational efficiency.

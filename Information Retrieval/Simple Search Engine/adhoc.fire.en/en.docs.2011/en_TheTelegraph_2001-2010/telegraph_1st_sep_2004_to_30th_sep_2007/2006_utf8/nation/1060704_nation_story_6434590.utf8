 Booked for firing, cop kills himself

Mumbai (PTI): A sub-inspector, who was booked 

for firing from his service revolver without provocation, has allegedly killed 

himself by jumping before a suburban train in northeast Mumbai.

The body of Sandeep Krishna Jadhav, 35, attached to 

the local arms division of Mumbai police, was found near Vikhroli on Sunday night. 

The police said no suicide note was found on him.

 Jadhav was returning home on Friday night in an autorickshaw when he fired five shots in the air without provocation. A probe was on in the matter, police commissioner A.N. Roy said. The sub-inspector was booked for firing the shots. He perhaps realised that he has done something seriously wrong, Roy said.

 His friends claimed Jadhav had been suffering from depression for the past few months as he was not being relieved from the local arms division against a transfer order to the police headquarters.

 Spy diplomat leaves India

New Delhi (PTI): An American diplomat, who 

was allegedly involved with an espionage network in the National Security Council 

Secretariat, has left India. 

Rosanne Minchew, who was allegedly receiving information 

from arrested council official S.S. Paul, has left the country after the Centre 

took up the case with the US authorities, sources said on Monday.

 The diplomat was understood to have been associated with the Indo-US Cyber Security Forum, a joint initiative to fight international terrorism.

 The spy ring came to light in mid-June with the arrest of Paul, a computer systems administrator in the council, which gets assessments from intelligence agencies on security issues, the sources said.

 Salman dues 

Mumbai (PTI): A court on Tuesday will hear 

Salman Khans complaints against Cinevista Ltd regarding eight bounced cheques

for acting in the film Garv ? Pride and Honour two years ago. Salman played 

the lead role in the film. 

Khalsa militant

Babbar Khalsa International member Bachan Singh Sogi, accused of plotting to assassinate 

former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son and former DGP K.P.S. 

Gill.

Fatal drink

Faizabad (PTI): Nine persons have died and 

several taken ill apparently after drinking toxic alcohol in Faizabad. Police

tanker carrying paint thinner that overturned on Sunday.

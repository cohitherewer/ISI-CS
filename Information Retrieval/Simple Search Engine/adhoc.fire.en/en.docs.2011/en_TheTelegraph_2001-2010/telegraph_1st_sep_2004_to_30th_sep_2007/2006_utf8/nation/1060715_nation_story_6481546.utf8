 Three sticks to beat govt with

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 14: The BJPs strategic experts have worked out a sound basis for the partys increasingly shrill rhetoric and chants of hot pursuit that form part of their campaign against terror starting tomorrow.

 Former foreign minister Jaswant Singh today spelt out three main reasons why the BJP believes its campaign would be advantageous:

 The UPAs administrative lapses such as repeal of the anti-terror act

 Its losing out on a psychological war by negotiating with the Ulfa and Naxalites

 Its seeking electoral advantages by hobnobbing with terrorists.

 The BJPs senior leaders feel these lapses can be magnified to embarrass the UPA through a street campaign.

 The campaign seems to have been designed to let the junior functionaries hold populist strikes while the seniors ? Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Singh ? would focus their attacks on the more serious aspects of the governments weaknesses in foreign policy matters.

 An example of this is BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekars statement yesterday that a policy of hot pursuit is needed to weed out Pakistan-based terror groups.

 Singh rubbished it today while carefully refusing to elaborate why such a statement was made in the first place. I dont wish to comment on what was said. But on the limited subject of hot pursuit, it is not an option.

 The BJPs decision to send Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for the campaign clearly signals the partys mission to consolidate Hindu votes. 

 But senior leaders are quick to deny it. I really dont think terrorism should be linked to any faith. This is an error, Singh said.

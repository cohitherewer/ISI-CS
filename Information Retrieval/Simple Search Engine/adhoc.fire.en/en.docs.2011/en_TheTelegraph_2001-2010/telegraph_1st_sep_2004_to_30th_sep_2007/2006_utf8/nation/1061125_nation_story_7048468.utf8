 Chennai, Nov. 24: Money may grow on trees, after all. Only be sure to plant the right one in your garden.

 The problem is, the one thats right for me may not do for you. So what do you do? You go to S. Krishnamurthy.

 The astrology expert claims that every zodiac sign corresponds to a tree species that is lucky for people born under that star. All you need to do is match your sun sign to its tree and plant it in your garden or a temple on an auspicious day, such as your birthday or wedding date.

 So, just walk into any of the three nakshatira marangal (star tree) gardens that Krishnamurthy has opened at three Chennai temples. Look up your tree from his table that matches 27 tree species to the 27 sun signs in Tamil astrology.

 Then buy a sapling from him.

 If you were born under the sign Chithirai, buy a vilvam (bel). If, like Jayalalithaa, your zodiac sign is the powerful Maham, take home a banyan.

 It may not be an accident that Krishnamurthy is a landscape designer by profession, planning the greenery for promoters and house-owners.

 But he insists his isnt a crank idea: the notion of a star tree match is very old in Hinduism. I have for years researched the various systems of Hindu astrology and interacted with siddhars (mystics) across southern India, he says.

 A star tree, it seems, indicates character, too. For instance, people born under the star Uthirattadhi are very independent and love to work alone. Like the corresponding tree, neem, they are not likely to wither away in bad times.

 Krishnamurthy grows his saplings 10 common varieties and 17 collected from various forests at the old Thiruvatteshwaranpet temple to Shiva, where he has a garden. The two other gardens are at the Parthasarathy Swamy (Krishna) temple in south Chennai and the Kapaleeshwar (Shiva) temple in Mylapore.

 Each tree has its own life, soul and distinct vibration, he explains. Your star tree gives you beneficial vibes and your mind becomes calm.

 Just the sort of thing to help Krishnamurthys business at a time when feng shui and vaastu are all the rage among the well-to-do.

 And if his theory lacks a rational explanation, its practical side surely brings scientific benefits, he reckons. I am promoting tree planting, Krishnamurthy chuckles. Its good for the environment.

 The Tamil Nadu Hindu religious and charitable endowments department has allowed him to display and plant these star trees at all state temples, he says. Even the temple department in Left-ruled Kerala has sent him an invite.

 Whatever Krishnamurthys sun sign is, all the 27 tree species seem to match it well.

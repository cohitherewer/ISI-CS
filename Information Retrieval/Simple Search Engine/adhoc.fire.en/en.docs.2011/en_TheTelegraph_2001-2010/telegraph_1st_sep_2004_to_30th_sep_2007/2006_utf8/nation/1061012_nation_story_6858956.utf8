 Kalimpong, Oct. 11: Indira Bhattacharya hasnt spoken to Kiran Desai post-Booker, but she is delighted her niece will now have to revise her opinion that she is just one of thousands of authors going around.

 I am, of course, delighted. I tried to speak to her but she is travelling somewhere between Frankfurt and London. So I couldnt reach her, Indira said, grinning from ear to ear.

 The frail 72-year-old child specialist did, however, manage to connect with her more famous sister Anita, Kirans mother. Oh, she could hardly speak. She is so delighted.

 Although Kalimpong is an integral part of the Booker-winning The Inheritance of Loss, Indira said Kiran didnt quite think the family belonged there. We all love this place. But she believes we dont belong here.

 Kiran had visited her several times in Kalimpong during her vacations, she said, and even briefly studied at St Josephs Convent in the mid-eighties. But at the end of it, her opinion about not belonging here hadnt changed.

 On one such trip, Kiran told her she was just one of thousands of authors going around.

 Indira, who wasnt willing to speak too much or even pose for a picture It is she who is in the picture, not I. I dont think it would be appropriate said Kiran was a warm, loving and very sensitive person.

 She loves to eat and cook. She also likes to travel.

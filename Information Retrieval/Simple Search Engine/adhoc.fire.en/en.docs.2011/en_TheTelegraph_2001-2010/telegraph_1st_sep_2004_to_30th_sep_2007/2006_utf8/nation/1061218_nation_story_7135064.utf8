 Syringe test to beat polio in last battleground

 G.S. MUDUR

 Time to change?

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: The injectible inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) may enter Indias polio eradication effort through a test project next year in two districts of western Uttar Pradesh described as the worlds last battleground against polio.

 An expert group that advises the government on polio has suggested that IPV be introduced in Moradabad and J.P. Nagar in the second quarter of 2007 to determine whether it can boost immunity in children and prevent polio. 

 In line with international practices, the government has been using the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to immunise children nationwide. But studies have shown that OPV has geographical variations in its efficacy. Many children in Moradabad who have got polio have already received over 10 doses of OPV.

 Scientists believe overcrowding and poor sanitation are among factors that prevent OPV from protecting some vaccinated children in western Uttar Pradesh. This allows the wild polio virus to cause disease in some children. Uttar Pradesh accounted for 483 out of 583 polio cases this year. 

 This is the toughest place in the world to eradicate polio, said Bruce Aylward, director of the World Health Organisations Polio Eradication Initiative. Were going to need the biggest, hardest push in the world in the coming months to get the job done.

 The India Expert Advisory Group (IEAG) has said the next few pulse polio rounds must effectively reach the youngest and the most vulnerable children who are not being immunised early enough.

 While the pulse polio rounds will use a sharper, more effective version of OPV that was introduced in India in 2005, the IEAG has suggested that IPV also be introduced to determine whether it can protect very young children who have not been protected by OPV alone.

 A decision to introduce IPV will signal a change in government policy which, for nearly three decades, has relied exclusively on OPV and has not even tolerated scientific criticism of OPV, medical researchers said.

 Well study whether IPV will boost immunity against polio, said Shobhan Sarkar, a consultant with the health ministry. Well also study its social acceptance and whether it will affect OPV campaigns, he said.

 The IPV, based on a killed polio virus, is more expensive than OPV. Studies from several countries and limited observations from India suggest that IPV is more effective in protecting individual children than OPV.

 However, proponents of OPV point out that this inexpensive and easy-to-deliver vaccine helped wipe out polio from all countries in the world except India and a few other countries.

 The IEAG has cautioned that the next few months will be Indias best chance to stop the virus through intensified campaigns. The two recent high-quality campaigns combined with the low season of polio virus transmission make the next few months Indias best chance to eradicate polio, said T. Jacob John, IEAG chairperson.

 India had come close to eradicating polio in 2005 with only 66 cases. Although the 583 cases this year have been reported from 100 districts, 80 per cent of India remains free of polio today.

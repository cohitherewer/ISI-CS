 Mumbai, Dec. 21: Sanjay Dutt will get to spend Christmas with his New York-based daughter Trishala, who returns to Mumbai on Saturday after completing a college term in the US.

 The special anti-terror court today granted Dutt and seven other convicts time till January 18 to surrender. It also deferred the hearing on the actors quantum of sentence and his application seeking release on grounds of good conduct under the Probation of Offenders Act.

 The Lage Raho Munnabhai star, who spent much of last week offering prayers at the Mahim dargah and the Siddhivinayak temple, walked into the court this morning looking relaxed. 

 The proceedings opened with special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam opposing Dutts application seeking extension of bail. 

 Nikam argued that there were no provisions under the law to extend bail of a convicted accused and that Sections 5, 6, and 354 of the Criminal Procedure Code categorically state that an accused found guilty should be taken into custody with immediate effect after cancellation of his interim bail.

 Dutts counsel V.R. Manohar informed the court that his client wished to invoke the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act when the court hears arguments on his quantum of punishment. He told the court that if Dutt was taken into custody today, his application to seek release under the Probation of Offenders Act would be infructuous and he would not get the benefit of the act.

 Judge Kode said he was in the middle of hearing the arguments on the quantum of sentence of other accused and it would save precious time if the defence and the prosecution clubbed together the arguments on the quantum of punishment and the application under the Probation of Offenders Act. Nikam said he had no objection to the suggestion as far as he is allowed to make detailed arguments on both the issues.

 Judge Kode then posted the hearing on January 18. Applications of seven other convicts, who also have sought time on humanitarian grounds, would be heard on that day. They include customs official Somnath Thapa, Imtiaz Ghavate (both suffering from life-threatening diseases), women convicts Zaibunissa Kazi and Mubina Bhiwandiwala, and Sanjays friends Yusuf Nulwalla, Kersi Adajania, and Russi Mulla.

 Trishala, 18, studies in John Day College of Criminal Justice in New York and lives with her maternal grandparents. She was a few months old when her mother Richa Sharma died of brain tumour. Dutt dotes on her and each year spends a vacation with her.

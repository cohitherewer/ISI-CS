The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Delhi firm on Afghan role

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: India today said it will continue to take part in the reconstruction of Afghanistan despite threats from the Taliban.

 The statement came as a regional conference on the war-ravaged country announced a slew of measures to turn the nation into a vital link between South and Central Asia.

 Wrapping up the two-day donors conference, attended by representatives of all countries from the region, G-8 and top officials of international aid agencies, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said the objective of the Taliban was to see Indians withdraw from Afghanistan. We refuse to succumb to the Taliban, he said.

 Pranab said the security of Indian workers has been beefed up with the help of Afghan authorities and additional central para-military forces have been sent to that country.

 The stress on Indias intention to take a leading role in Afghanistans reconstruction came on a day the conference adopted the Delhi Declaration, which held out the promise that the nation would emerge as a vital link between Central, West and South and Southeast Asia.

 We have a vision of bringing freedom, dignity and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan through the co-operative venture which unites all countries of the region in a collaborative effort, Mukherjee said.

 The first step in this link is to put pressure on Pakistan to allow its territory to be used for carrying Indian goods to Afghanistan. Afghan foreign minister Rangin Datfar Spanta said a request to open the road link has been made.

 Delhi is also keen to start the pipeline project between Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. 

 Mukherjee said the project was viable, but added that studies will be conducted to fix the time-frame.

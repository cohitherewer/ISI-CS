 Hurriyat help in blast net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Aug. 6: Jammu police have arrested the domestic help of a senior leader of the Hurriyat Conference hardline faction in Doda on charges of lobbing grenades at civilians.

 Mohammad Qasim and four of his associates are said to have targeted civilians and a BJP rally on May 13, blasting grenades that left three persons dead. They were particularly active in the months of May and June.

 The four others arrested are Javied Ahmad, Mohammad Hussain, Javid Iqbal and Riyaz Ahmed.

 Inspector-general of police, Jammu zone, S.P. Vaid made these disclosures in Jammu this afternoon, claiming that the police have worked out all the grenade explosion cases at Doda in Jammu. We have arrested five militants, all of whom were working for the Lashkar-e-Toiba. We are looking for three others.

 Qasim had been working for Hurriyat leader Saidullah Tantray for over a decade. Tantray is part of the Hurriyat extremist faction led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani. 

 Recently, state director-general of police Gopal Sharma had said in Srinagar that the June 12 grenade explosion at a Jammu bus stand was a revenge attack, two days after Shiv Sena activists prevented Geelani from holding a news conference in Jammu.

 The attacks in Doda in May and June, less than a fortnight after the massacre of 22 Hindus, were seen as part of the militant design to force minorities out of the district.

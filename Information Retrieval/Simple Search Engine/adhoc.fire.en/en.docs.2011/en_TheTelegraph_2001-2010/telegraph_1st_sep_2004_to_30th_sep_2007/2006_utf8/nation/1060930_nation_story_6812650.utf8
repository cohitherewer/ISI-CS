 Blast ghost haunts Delhi shopkeepers

 People out shopping a day after the blasts last year

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Lurking in Vineet Rajkumar Tulis mind is a fear that his Diwali may be over before it has really begun.

 First came the civic bodys order to seal scores of shops including his forcing him to start distress sales just a week before the start of the profitable festive season.

 With a temporary hold on the sealing drive, the corporation may not be damaging his Diwali earnings any further, but the stream of customers coming in till recently has thinned to a trickle after Mahalaya, when the shopping should have begun in earnest.

 The ghost of last years blasts that killed 59 people mostly shoppers at Sarojini Nagar and Paharganj buying Diwali or Id gifts has come back to haunt Vineet and other shopkeepers.

 There is an unsaid fear. When I told my parents we were coming here, they didnt stop me, but they couldnt hide the concern on their faces, says 22-year-old Delhi University student Rashmi Dass as she chooses a salwar-kameez with her friends.

 Vineets earnings on the first six days of the season have been the lowest in a decade even though he has resumed selling at the usual prices. My earnings, compared with last years, are already Rs 7 lakh in deficit. At this rate, there will be no celebrations when Diwali comes, he says.

 Rahul Singhs Adidas showroom had sold just two pairs of shoes yesterday, well into the afternoon. 

 A market that was bustling 10 days ago wears a deserted look as if it were a scorching afternoon in May. Many shopkeepers are standing outside their shops, urging people to have a look at their wares.

 There is almost an air of anxiety, with closed-circuit television sets on top of tall poles specially installed for this period by the police staring down at passers-by.

 Sudhanshu, from Rashmis college, says his parents would be really scared if they knew where he was. The fear is natural at this time of the year, in the festive season. They worry that terrorists may attack crowded markets again, especially here.

 Across the city in Paharganj, local businessmen are thanking the localitys reputation as the backpacking foreign tourists favourite destination. However, hardly any Indian can be seen shopping.

 I came here two years ago at the same time of the year. It was really crowded. This time around, it is much more quiet, says Christine Vecker from Germany.

 Were it not for the tourists, say the shopkeepers, their children would have had to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers.

 Mobile, but no cricket

 Chennai, Feb. 7: If you are a cricket fan and travelling ? too bad.

 Even the handy little cellphone that helps you connect wont be of much good when it comes to updates on the current India-Pakistan one-day series.

 Madras High Court today restrained for four weeks major cellular companies and popular websites from messaging live scores, updates, alerts and other information on the series to any wireless or mobile device in any part of India.

 The order came on a petition by the Chennai-based Marksman Marketing Services, which sought a directive that the cellular companies and websites should obtain permission from the petitioner if they wished to send such SMSes on the series to their customers.

 Justice M. Chockalingam, who admitted the civil suit, said there was a fit case to grant an injunction for four weeks as the balance of convenience was in the petitioners favour.

 The mobile operators and websites restrained include Bharati Tele-Venture Limited (Airtel), BSNL, Reliance Infocomm, Hutchison Essar Limited, the Gujarat-based Idea Cellular, Aircel Cellular, the Mohali-based Spice Telecom, Tata Indicom, the Bangalore-based On Mobile Asia Pacific Pvt. Ltd, and IMI Mobile of Hyderabad.

 The websites include Sify, Yahoo, India Times, Rediff.com, Phoneytunes.com, and the Chennai-based Cricinfo India.

 Shankar Subramanian, the managing director of the petitioner-company, also cited the Indian cricket board and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India among the respondents.

 The petitioner said one M/s Vectracom (Pvt) Ltd had been given global SMS rights for the current tour through a December 29 agreement with the Pakistan Cricket Board. And Vectracom in turn had granted Marksman exclusive rights for the entire territory of India to SMS information on the five one-day matches. So, all mobile operators within India should first take Marksmans permission to message such instant information.

 Marksman said during the recently concluded Test series, several cellular companies were found transmitting SMSes to subscribers without taking permission from Vectracom and expressed fear that they would do so for the one-day matches too.

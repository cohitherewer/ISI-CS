 Brinda cries off Pakistan meeting

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dikshit

 New Delhi, July 15: CPM politburo member Brinda Karat and Congress MP Sandeep Dikshit have decided against attending a meeting in Islamabad next week following the Prime Ministers hint of a Pakistani link to the Mumbai blasts.

 The two-member parliamentary delegation was to attend a workshop on women and development organised by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Karat called up Anand Sharma, minister of state for foreign affairs, to ask whether it was appropriate for them to travel to Islamabad at this point.

 It was not a personal but an official trip. The question was whether it would be appropriate to go to Islamabad in the wake of the circumstances in Mumbai, Karat later explained as she announced she wouldnt be going.

 Dikshit said he was to leave this morning, ahead of Karat. We could not go especially after what the Prime Minister indicated about the role of the Pakistani agencies and the establishment.

 The CPI, though, has urged the Centre not to suspend the India-Pakistan dialogue. The terrorists want to derail these talks and create communal tension. They should not be allowed to have their way, MP Gurudas Das Gupta told reporters.

 He said the government should be stern and ask Islamabad to dismantle all terror camps in the country.

 Das Gupta alleged that intelligence agencies had totally failed to provide crucial information that could have prevented the blasts. 

 What is the home ministry doing? What was the role of the state home department? The Centre must look into it, he said.

 The blasts have come at a time when the Left is upset with the Centres foreign policies. It plans to put the government on the mat in Parliament for its pro-US stance.

 The Left wants the Constitution amended to make it mandatory for the government to discuss in the House and get its approval for any treaty it signs with any country.

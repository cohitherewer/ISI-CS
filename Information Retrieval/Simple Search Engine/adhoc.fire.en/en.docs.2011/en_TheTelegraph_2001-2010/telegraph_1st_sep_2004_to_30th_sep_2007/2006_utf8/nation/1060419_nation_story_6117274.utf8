 Cough up more to chug on Rajdhani

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: Travelling by Rajdhani and Shatabdi expresses is going to be costlier.

 The finance ministry has imposed service tax on on-board catering services of the Indian Railways.

 Service tax on catering services of Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express trains has been included in the ticket fare. Fares of these trains will increase accordingly, a statement issued today said.

 The exact increase will depend on the distance the train traverses from its point of origin to termination. The 12 per cent service tax will be levied only on the value of the food served on the train and not the total fare.

 Sources indicated that the increase would range between Rs 10 and Rs 50 for these two trains.

 For other trains which have pantry services that are not included in the ticket, the cost of food will go up by 12 per cent but the fare will remain the same.

 Till last year, railway catering was among the six services exempted from service tax. 

 In this years budget, however, finance minister P. Chidambaram has withdrawn the exemption.

 The six services included call centres, re-insurance premium received from domestic and overseas sources, catering services provided within academic institutions or medical establishment by an outdoor caterer, services of enterprise resource planning software system and catering services provided on a train by an outdoor caterer.

 Chidambaram has also increased the tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and brought 15 more services, including ATM operations and Internet telephony, under its ambit.

 The new services also include share transfer agents, registrars, maintenance and management, sale of space for advertisement other than in print media, sponsorship of events other than sports, international air travel other than economy class and public relation services.

 The government expects to collect Rs 34,500 crore in 2006-07. 

 During 2005-06, the Centre is likely to collect Rs 23,000 crore (revised estimates) against the budget estimate of Rs 17,500 crore.

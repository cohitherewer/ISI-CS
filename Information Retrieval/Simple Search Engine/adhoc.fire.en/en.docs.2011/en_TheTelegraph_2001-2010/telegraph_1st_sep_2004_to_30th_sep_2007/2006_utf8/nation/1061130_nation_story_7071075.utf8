 Stars shine, jail or no jail

 Mumbai, Nov. 29: Now that the sigh over his part-acquittal has been let out and the hard truths have begun to sink in, the new niggle is: where is his career headed?

 Will he manage to do a third Munnabhai regardless of whether he goes to jail or is let off with a fine or whatever else? Or will his career sink without a trace?

 If Bollywood pundits and stargazers are to be believed, Sanjay runs no such risk: he is certain to remain the darling of the crowds, come what may.

 Even if Sanjay serves out a sentence, his image will come to no harm obviously, his present films might suffer, but Sanjay will not lose anything as a brand, said film trade analyst Komal Nahata.

 Bollywood bad boys Salman Khan and Fardeen Khan would stand testimony to that. Not only did the black buck not dent Salmans star value, it helped Chori Chori Chupke Chupke do well instead a year on. Nor did the bakery crash cost him much.

 With Fardeen, things were even better. Two months after he was caught with a gram or so of cocaine on him, he landed a plum modelling assignment with Provogue!

 Experts keeping tabs on the peoples pulse say a brush with the law has never been an occupational hazard in Bollywood. Nor has it swayed the affection of the masses.

 Indians, as a race, are more tolerant to such things. We are more accommodating and more inclusive... Our history proves we have been a forgiving race (we have) an inherent need to forgive and forget, said psychologist Harish Shetty.

 The message sent out by Sanjays producers today reinforced this, although the star appealed to court for interim relief to finish his films. Most producers said they would not replace him and were willing to wait. We are in no hurry. We still require around 22 days of work from Sanjay, but we are willing to wait. Theres no question of replacing him, said Apurva Lakhia, whose Shootout at Lokhandwala is 80 per cent complete.

 Abbas Mastan, who is producing Mr Fraud, simply said: We are with Sanjay.

 Nehlle pe Dehlla producer Mahendra Dhariwal would say nothing about his film. The entire industry is praying for Sanjay and thats our only concern now.

 Had Sanjay been in the US, things would have been far tougher. Singing star Michael Jacksons image has yet to recover from the battering it got since the story about the molestation of little boys at his Neverland ranch. 

 So also American football player .J. Simpson, who was charged with the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. That both were acquitted did not matter much to the people.

 While sentiments drive us (Indians), Americans are driven by rules and rights. Indians will not take Sanjay or the other stars to the gallows as the Americans have, Shetty said.

 Public relations consultant Anita Vallala agreed. Sanjay was arrested earlier when his career was at its peak. Now again after Lage Raho Munnabhai, he is at the height of his career nothing happened then, nothing will happen now!

 Charred dreams from Gulf 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Aug. 2: The bodies of the Bahrain fire victims arrived this morning, bringing home a tale of charred dreams.

 The Muscat-Bahrain-Chennai Gulf Air flight carrying 16 coffins flew in at 8.30 am.

 The construction workers of Royal Tower Company in Manama died of suffocation when a fire broke out on Sunday in a three-storeyed building.

 The relatives of the victims had the same story to tell how the lure of a foreign job that would help them escape the poverty at home had taken them to the Gulf. My relative who died paid Rs 1.75 lakh to an agent who placed him in this Bahrain company just to do odd construction jobs, M. Arumugam said, adding that he had borrowed money at a high interest rate to buy his ticket to better times.

 Our crops have failed. The government says loans are being given to farmers, but banks are reluctant to lend us any money. To afford a decent wedding and a house in Tamil Nadu, one is forced to go out and work, said Paramasiva Udayar, who had come to take home the bodies of two relatives.

 But the grass is often not that green on the other side, he added. The agents say I will get you a drivers visa when you land there, but people end up tending to camels.

 The government has promised some solace to the families of the dead. Chief minister M. Karunanidhi said they would be given Rs 2 lakh each.

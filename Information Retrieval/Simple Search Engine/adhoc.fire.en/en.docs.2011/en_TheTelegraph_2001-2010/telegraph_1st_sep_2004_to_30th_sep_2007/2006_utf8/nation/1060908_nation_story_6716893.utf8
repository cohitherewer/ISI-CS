 Rebel flees from court

 Srinagar, Sept. 7: A top Hizb-ul Mujahideen militant today pulled off a Bollywood-style escape outside a court in Kashmir late this afternoon, reports our special correspondent.

 Altaf Ahmed Malik, who had been arrested for the abduction and murder of a railway engineer and his brother two years ago, was being produced before a magistrate in Pulwama town, 45 km from here, when his associates suddenly appeared, police said.

 Malik pulled the chain to which his handcuffs were tied from constable Ghulam Qadirs hand. 

 In the meantime, a powerful hand grenade exploded outside the court causing panic and commotion, which facilitated the arrested militants escape. a senior officer said. 

 Maliks aides fired several rounds from their pistols at the constable, wounding him seriously.

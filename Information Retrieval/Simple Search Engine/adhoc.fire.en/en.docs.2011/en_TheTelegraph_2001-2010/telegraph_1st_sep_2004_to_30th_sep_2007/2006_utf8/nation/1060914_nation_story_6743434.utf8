 Socialist stalwarts pushed to corner

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Socialist veterans George Fernandes, Janeshwar Mishra and Surendra Mohan are facing marginalisation in the parties they had themselves once helped form to take ahead Ram Manohar Lohias legacy.

 The old and frail leaders, living out this awful reality, are trying to make themselves relevant in a political atmosphere that seems to have outlived them.

 In the contest for the Janata Dal (United) presidents post in May, Fernandes, 76, was defeated by Sharad Yadav, who had the backing of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. Fernandes is trying to find a new turf for himself by aligning with Samajwadi Party president and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 However, in the Samajwadi Party, too, Mishra popularly known as chhota Lohia has been reduced to a showpiece, with almost no share in decision-making though Mulayam has constantly been trying to don a socialist mask in the run-up to the next Assembly polls in the state.

 Mishra, who is 73 and has difficulty in walking because of knee problems, is as restive as Fernandes. But with his party going in a different direction, he has for the present reconciled to the ways of the Samajwadis represented by Mulayam and his closest aide Amar Singh.

 Veteran Lohia follower Surendra Mohan is carrying out what his supporters call an inner party struggle in the Janata Dal (Secular), especially after party chief H.D. Deve Gowdas son H.D. Kumaraswamy joined hands with the BJP to lead a government in Karnataka nearly six months ago.

 A member of the Dal (S) national executive, Mohan has since organised two meetings of party leaders opposed to what is seen as Gowdas silent support to Kumaraswamy. The first meeting was held in June in Mumbai and the second in Delhi last month. A demand was raised for Gowdas removal at each of them but neither was strong enough to give a push to Mohans resolve.

 Another socialist veteran, Chandra Shekhar, is too ill to take the fight ahead. But the young turk as the former Prime Minister was euphemistically called surprised parliamentarians on a day during the monsoon session by appearing in the Lok Sabha. The MP from Ballia in eastern Uttar Pradesh had not been able to attend Parliament for a long time.

 Chandra Shekhar, who is suffering from multiple myeloma (cancer of plasma cells), is keen to see his huge assets and political legacy in safe hands before it is too late.

 Chandra Shekhar has offered to will his public assets, controlled by various trusts, to the nation through Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and his political outfit Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) to Dal (S) president Deve Gowda. But these attempts are being opposed by a section within his party as well as some of his family members.

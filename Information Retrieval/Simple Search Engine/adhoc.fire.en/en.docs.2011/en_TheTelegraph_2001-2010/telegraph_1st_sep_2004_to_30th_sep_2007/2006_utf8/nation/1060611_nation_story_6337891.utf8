The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left campaign gets louder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, June 10: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other senior CPM leaders returned from Hyderabad tonight, after attending the partys central committee meeting, to try and frame Bengals response to Delhis request for sales tax relief on petro products.

 The response, party officials said, would be fashioned by developments at the national level, such as the Telugu Desam Partys entry into the scene and the overwhelming mandate the Left got in two of the five states that went to polls recently.

 Once the main backer of the NDA, Chandrababu Naidus Desam last night decided to join the Left-sponsored campaign against the oil price hike.

 The tie-up was structured at a dinner meeting in Hyderabad where a host of CPM leaders -- including general secretary Prakash Karat and the chief ministers of Bengal, Tripura and Kerala -- and Naidu were present. 

 Many regional parties, concerned about the way the Congress and the BJP are actually harming popular interests, are gravitating towards the Left bloc for support and leadership, a CPM politburo member said. We are going to formulate our response to the sales tax (cut) and our approach to the politics shaping the oil issue only after consulting Left Front constituents. 

 In Calcutta, Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who has faced criticism for the high sales tax on petrol and diesel in the state, refused to comment because the budget exercise is under way.

 Sources said Dasgupta has told his department that the response would be decided by the party, with Bhattacharjee presenting the guidelines to his cabinet.

 Yesterday, the CPM and its allies were on the back foot when Congress-ruled Maharashtra decided to freeze sales tax on the increase in oil prices. But today, they seemed ready to turn the development into a platform for a larger movement by non-Congress and non-BJP forces.

 The leaders said Bengal could think of a Maharashtra-type move only when the Centre rolls back the price hike. 

 The Congress is playing a joke with the country, as is evident from the fact that the Centre run by it hikes the prices, its leadership expresses appropriate concern at the hike and calls for a review and the states run by it decide to offer relief by tinkering with sales tax, said Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh. If this is not political immorality, what is?

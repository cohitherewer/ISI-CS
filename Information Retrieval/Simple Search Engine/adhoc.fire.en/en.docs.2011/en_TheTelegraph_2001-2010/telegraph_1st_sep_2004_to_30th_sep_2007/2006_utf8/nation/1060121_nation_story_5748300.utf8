 Bush: Defining moment

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: Delhi and Washington have failed to agree on how to separate Indias military and civil nuclear facilities even after six months of talks on their nuclear deal.

 The deal is now unlikely to be implemented before President George Bushs visit to India which, Delhi announced today, will happen in the first week of March.

 After two days of hectic discussions, US under-secretary of state Nicholas Burns and Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran told reporters the two sides now understood each other better but would need more time to settle their differences.

 Asked if the negotiations would be completed before Bushs visit, Burns replied: We are not sure, we are going for it.

 The two officials will meet again in the coming weeks.

 India had submitted a preliminary separation plan last year. The US team came back with its observations on the plan this time.

 On the other key issue of the talks ? Irans nuclear programme ? India was seen standing with the US and Europe. 

 Delhi today said it supported the EU-3 (Germany, France, Britain) initiative on engaging Tehran in finding an amicable solution, while America poured scorn on Irans comparison of its nuclear programme with Indias.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency holds a crucial meeting next month on referring Iran to the UN Security Council. India had sided with the West during the previous vote last year.

 Saran and Burns also discussed the itinerary of Bush and his wife Laura, who are likely to visit Agra and Hyderabad, too. Saran termed the trip a defining moment in Indo-US relations.

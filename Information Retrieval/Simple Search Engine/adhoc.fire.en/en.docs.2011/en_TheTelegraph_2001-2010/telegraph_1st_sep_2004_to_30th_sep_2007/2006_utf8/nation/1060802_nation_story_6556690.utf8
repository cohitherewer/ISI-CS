 Mamata: Constitutional crisis

 New Delhi/ Calcutta, Aug. 1: Mamata Banerjee today demanded the Centres intervention following chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees attack on Jagmohan Dalmiya.

 The West Bengal CMs comments against the duly elected head of CAB, Jagmohan Dalmiya, symbolise a constitutional crisis in the state. The Centre should intervene under Article 355, the Trinamul Congress leader said.

 Ignoring the hush that fell at this suggestion, Mamata continued: The Centre cannot remain a mute spectator. It should intervene and warn the chief minister under Article 355. Article 355 says it is the duty of the Centre to protect every state against external aggression and internal disturbance.

 Bhattacharjees remarks he had described Dalmiyas win as the victory of evil and said he wanted him out of CAB reflected his dictatorial mindset, she said.

 Ally BJP joined the chorus, calling Bhattacharjees comments indecent.

 The chief minister has crossed all limits of decency, spokesperson V.K. Malhotra said. Nothing could be more indecent than Bhattacharjees comments about Dalmiya. It only confirms the speculation that the CPM was neck-deep in the Cricket Association of Bengal election.

 If it was the Opposition that attacked Bhattacharjee in Delhi, in Calcutta it was his Left colleagues.

 Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said that as a citizen he did not agree that Dalmiya should be ousted. If my candidate had lost and they keep losing I wouldve been sporting about it. So many of the people I back in sports have lost. But did I wage a war against anyone?

 I dont think a responsible chief minister would ever have personal scores to settle.

 RSP minister Kshiti Goswami said there was more than cricket to Bhattacharjees dislike of Dalmiya. There are other considerations.

 CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya said: When I win, the process is democratic but when the opponent does, it suddenly becomes undemocratic. What kind of a stand is this?

 From a pauper, Dalmiya became a millionaire, courtesy favours doled out by the state government. When I registered my protest against the Bantala leather complex fiasco, my voice was not liked by many. It must feel bad to lose an election, but does that make the winner evil?

 Forward Bloc minister Rabindranath Ghosh said its usually the Trinamul Congress which makes such allegations after an election.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyas was the lone voice of support. I support the chief ministers stand. He is the head of the cabinet there is no question of any difference of opinion.

 Clock ticking as probe team looks for leads

 Mumbai, July 16: Indias financial capital. Weekday rush hour. Eleven minutes. Seven blasts. Almost 200 dead. Nearly 800 injured. Five days gone. No arrests. Not even a reconstruction of the Mumbai train blasts.

 Time is running out for the Maharashtra anti-terrorist squad probing Tuesdays serial blasts, although chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh is still confident of a revelation within a week.

 Apart from giving out selective leaks, the ATS has largely been mum. No one is ready to go on record, but a senior ATS source said the bombs were probably a deadly concoction of ammonium nitrate, nitro-glycerine and sodium nitrate put together in a glass tube with some fuel oil and fitted with a fuse.

 They are locally called gelatin sticks and must have been put together with a timer just half an hour before they were loaded on various trains leaving Churchgate station, he said.

 Since all seven trains left Churchgate after 5.30 pm, police sources claimed the bombs may have been put together between 4 and 5 pm at a place not very far from the station.

 It would have taken an hour or 45 minutes to put together the bombs because the gelatin sticks ? quite a few of them would have been required ? are extremely dangerous to carry and can set off in no time if a fuse is attached to it without a timer, a source said.

 At least 15 attackers, including a commander, would have then taken half an hour to reach Churchgate and plant the bombs in the first class compartments, the source added.

 They (would have) worked in batches of two and used the trains turnaround time to place the bombs. They couldnt have done it when people were alighting or boarding the compartment.

 Witnesses said they did not recall seeing anybody placing anything while boarding the trains. But it is a tough call to remember such things on Mumbais crowded trains.

 Nor did anyone have a clue till the bombs started exploding: Khar ? 1824 hrs; Bandra ? 1824 hrs; Jogeshwari ? 1825 hrs; Mahim ? 1826 hrs; Mira Road ? 1829 hrs; Matunga ? 1830 hrs; Borivli ? 1835 hrs.

 The ATS said it was looking for an email account that could have been used by the terrorists, as during the London blasts. But there have been no finds yet.

 Suspects in net

 Junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal today said several leads into the blasts had been obtained and it would be known in two to four days who triggered them and how.

 Central security agencies were understood to have picked up a few people, including key suspects, along the Indo-Nepal border, sources said. No agency or Mumbai police were, however, willing to talk about the detentions.

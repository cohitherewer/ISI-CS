 Singh at airport 

for special guest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh waited at the tarmac for his Nepalese counterpart Girija Prasad Koirala, as India lined up a welcome that signalled its support for the new Seven-Party Alliance government in the Himalayan nation.

 Only twice before has Singh received a foreign head of government at the airport, and that was to welcome Saudi King Abdullah and US President George W. Bush.

 The gesture is meant for visitors considered special by Delhi. Junior foreign minister Anand Sharma and senior officials from the external affairs ministry were also on the tarmac as the octogenarian Koirala landed in Delhi on his maiden foreign trip since becoming Prime Minister for the fourth time.

 Unlike Bush and Abdullah, who were on their first visits to India, Koirala knows the country well and has many friends in the Indian establishment. But this visit is different, as he comes as head of a government that was catapulted to power by a peoples movement, ending King Gyanendras reign.

 Koirala arrived with a 41-member delegation that includes finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat, local development minister Raje Pandey and five other cabinet colleagues.

 Sources said all aspects of the situation in Nepal would be assessed. Koirala, they added, will meet leaders like Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the ailing former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar and the CPMs Sitaram Yechury.

 Koiralas four-day stay in Delhi has been given the tag of a goodwill visit, and, the sources added, there will be plenty of warm gestures as India has firmed up an elaborate economic package to bail out Nepals crippled economy.

 Apart from providing financial aid, India is keen to know the status of negotiations between the government and the Maoists, who have waged a long war against the monarchy.

 India wants the Nepal government to ensure that Maoists shun violence before they are accepted back into political mainstream. Talks will also be held on the possible role of the UN in monitoring the ceasefire between the government and the Maoists, the sources said.

 Clintons carnage claim

 - Ex-President sees Hindu militants behind massacre

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 Clinton: Speaking out

 New Delhi, June 5: Former President Bill Clinton has blamed Hindu militants for the Chattisinghpora massacre in March 2000 in his introduction to former US secretary of state Madeleine Albrights new book.

 In the introduction to Albrights book, The Mighty and the Almighty ? Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs, Clinton writes: During my visit to India in 2000, some Hindu militants decided to vent their outrage by murdering 38 Sikhs in cold blood.

 The March 20 violence, one of the worst communal massacres in Jammu and Kashmir, took place on the eve of Clintons state visit to India.

 The book, published by Harper Collins US Publishers, was released last week in Washington and is to be released in India by the end of this month.

 Clinton, however, does not give reasons in the introduction as to why he believes Hindu militants had carried out the attack.

 He also links the massacre to his visit, saying: If I hadnt made the trip, the victims would probably still be alive.

 If I hadnt made the trip because I feared what militants might do, I couldnt have done my job as the President of the United States, he adds.

 Earlier, too, Clinton has spoken about the Chattisinghpora massacre as heartbreaking.

 At a function in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 14, 2000, Clinton had reportedly said: The most heartbreaking thing that happened on my trip to the Indian subcontinent is that about 40 Sikhs were murdered in Kashmir.

 Security forces had initially held Pakistan-based terrorists responsible for the incident and had killed five alleged terrorists. But local villagers had said the five were innocent civilians, forcing the state government to order a probe.

 The bodies were exhumed and DNA tests were conducted on them in Calcutta and Hyderabad by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory.

 It was later alleged that the DNA samples were fudged by Jammu and Kashmir police.

 After the Mufti Mohammed Sayeed government came to power in Kashmir in 2002, it set up a three-member ministerial team to investigate these allegations.

 On July 22, 2003, three police officers and two doctors were arrested after being found guilty by the committee.

 Soldier in heroin net

 - 'Unhappy' with salary, jawan turns to drug peddling 

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: A Rashtriya 

 Rifles jawan involved in counter-insurgency operations in 

 Jammu and Kashmir has been caught peddling drugs in Mumbai 

 during a sting operation.

 Sepoy Diptesh Pradeep Khataukar 

 was arrested on August 18 with 5 gm of heroin after being 

 tricked into supplying drugs to a police decoy in the Sher-e-Punjab 

 area of Mumbais Jogeshwari (east) suburb.

 The 24-year-old, on deputation 

 with the RR regiment in Poonch, had taken 45 days 

 leave starting August 10. He has said he took to drug peddling 

 as his salary of Rs 8,000 was too little to make ends meet.

 Investigating officer Prakash 

 Thete said the police were tipped off by a local informer, 

 who was made to pose as a buyer. At first, we did 

 not know Khataukar was a soldier. It came out during interrogation. 

 He said he did not want to serve in J amp;K. We found 5 

 gm of heroin on him. He said he got lured into this as his 

 pay as a sepoy is not adequate. 

 Khataukar has been charged under 

 the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, 

 after his regiment gave investigators the go-ahead to proceed 

 against him. He will be tried by civilian courts.

 Originally attached to the 501 

 Air Defence Artillery Regiment stationed in Mathura, Khataukar 

 told interrogators he was introduced to drug peddling by 

 a colleague, Kalika Prasad, as a means of making quick money.

 Their intention was to procure 

 drugs from Mathura and sell in Mumbai. Khataukar said he 

 and Prasad wanted to quit the army, Thete said.

 Prasad, too, was arrested after 

 Mumbai police tipped off his Mathura regiment. He will be 

 tried under the Army Act.

 Thete said Khataukar, now in Arthur 

 Road jail, came from a farming family based in Govamone 

 village of the Dapoli area of Ratnagiri district.

 Of late, Mumbai has emerged 

 as a big destination for contraband narcotics from Columbian 

 drug cartels. There have been massive seizures, Narcotics 

 Control Bureau superintendent A.P. Patil said.

 One kg of heroin fetches 

 Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 in Afghanistan. It is worth Rs 2.5-3 

 lakh in Pakistan, from where it is brought to India. Indian 

 dealers get it for Rs 4 lakh a kg, and it is resold to Africans 

 for Rs 5 lakh in Delhi and Mumbai.

 The 5 gm Khataukar was caught 

 with would, at the most, have fetched Rs 25,000.

 Any person caught carrying heroin 

 or having it in his house can be booked under the narcotic 

 drugs act. Rahul Mahajan was booked earlier this year under 

 the act. 

 Actor Fardeen Khan is still doing 

 the rounds of the courts after he was caught with 1 gm of 

 heroin.

 Criminal lawyer Aadab Panda said: 

 The sentence under the NDPS Act is usually lenient 

 for those held with minute quantities (less than 2 gm) but 

 it still remains a non-bailable offence. The police do not 

 have the right to release the person only the courts can. 

 If the amount is more than 2 gm, it is regarded as drug 

 peddling.

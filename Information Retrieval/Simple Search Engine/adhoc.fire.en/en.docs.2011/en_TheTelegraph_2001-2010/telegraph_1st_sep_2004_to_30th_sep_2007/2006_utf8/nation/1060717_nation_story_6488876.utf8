 Five-year plan in line of fire

 Prakash Karat: Twin blows

 Calcutta/ Delhi, July 16: Conflict on policy issues continues between the CPM and the Centre. 

 Yesterday, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat sent a nine-page critique of the approach paper to the 11th Five-Year Plan to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. 

 The Planning Commission has made the approach paper to the 11th plan public and invited comments on it. So, we have expressed our partys observation on the approach paper, Karat said. 

 The CPM, which till now was targeting individual issues like divestment, is now training its guns on almost the entire gamut of the UPA governments economic policies.

 Coming close on the heels of the bulldozing of the governments plans to divest from Nalco and Neyveli Lignite Corporation, the move is being seen as an overall attempt to de-Congressise the national agenda.

 The CPM blow is two-pronged ? first it will expose the anti-people stresses in the approach paper and then come out with an alternative approach paper prepared by the party to further discredit the government. 

 Seeking to emulate tiger economies such as China and Korea, the Planning Commission has set an ambitious 8 to 9 per cent growth target for the five-year plan, commencing in 2007-08. The paper also contains a calculation of the projected growth scenario and the associated requirements of public and private savings, investment and sectoral growth rates. 

 The CPM critique has questioned the Planning Commission model to arrive at the numbers, besides criticising the road map and policies prescribed in the approach paper.

 Skirting Holi, Advani spoils to hit the road

 New Delhi, March 8: Sixteen years after he redefined Indian politics by riding his rath from Somnath to Ayodhya, Lal Krishna Advani today announced that the time is ripe for him to repeat the experiment.

 Advani would ride a chariot on a political journey ? he calls it the National Integration Twin Yatra this time ? across the country later this month as a response to shocking minorityism and appeasement practised by the UPA government.

 The catalyst for this unforeseen announcement is the blasts in Varanasi, which, some feel, could consolidate a section of Hindu votes and help the BJP rebuild its floundering electoral fortunes.

 But sources said it is still not clear how the RSS will respond to the yatra and whether it would allow its famed machinery to be used to mobilise support for Advanis yatra. 

 The response of BJPs allies, particularly the Janata Dal (United), is also significant. It is a meaningless exercise. It is not going to help like the Ramjanmabhoomi movement as the middle class is more bothered about improving their living standards now, a Dal (U) leader said.

 The twin factor in the yatra can be explained by the fact that Advani has had to tag BJP president Rajnath Singh along on the journey.

 Advani has been trying to recover from the political humiliation heaped on him by the RSS after it virtually forced him to resign from the party presidents post following the Mohammed Ali Jinnah remarks. 

 Besides the yatra, Advani announced a series of steps that can contribute to building the necessary environment for his political journey.

 We will not observe Holi this year. On March 16, a day after Holi, all of us from the BJP will go to Varanasi and offer prayers at the Sankat Mochan temple, he said.

 Advani did not specify the route of the yatra or when it is expected to commence, but party sources said his programme would most probably start from Gandhinagar while Rajnath would start from Uttar Pradesh.

 To coincide with the election run-up in five states, the yatra is expected to commence any time between March 18 and 21. Advani will tour the entire country, focusing on the election-bound states, and the two yatras would meet in Guwahati.

 The government has unleashed a series of steps to appease minorities. The level of minorityism is not just detestable, it is dangerous. People are reacting very badly to it. I have no hesitation in admitting that the BJP came to political centre-stage because of the popular disgust with the politics of minority appeasement, Advani said.

 He did not deny that his announcements are linked to the Assembly polls. We are a political party. We cannot disregard elections, he said.

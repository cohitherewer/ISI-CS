 Ahmedabad, Dec. 19: For the past few months, the Matru Chhaya orphanage in Nadiad town was her only home. But this morning, Kanak got a new name and a home an address that could well be the envy of millions.

 The one-year-old will soon be on a flight to Utah, the US state whose governor has adopted her. John Huntsman, a father of six children, one of them adopted from China, came along with his entire family to the orphanage, about which he got to know through a website. 

 She will grow up in the US and have a great future. But she will never forget her roots, this orphanage and the sisters who looked after her, said Huntsman, minutes after he wrapped up adoption formalities today. 

 Mary Kaye, the governors wife, thanked Matru Chhayas nuns, who, she said, had given away a part of their soul. Now, we will give our full love and affection to this child. 

 Once he arrived at the orphanage, Huntsman was ushered in with the traditional tilak, followed by an emotional hand-over. A visit to Santram Mandir capped the trip.

 Orphanage sources said Kanak renamed Asha Bharati was brought to Nandiad from Vadodara when she was all of two months. No one has any clue about her parents, but it is generally believed that she was probably born to an unwed mother who abandoned her.

 Huntsman a Republican elected in November 2004 filed registration papers for adoption of a baby girl a year ago. He had a look at Kanaks video clippings and instantly selected her, said sister Nirmala of Matru Chhaya, wishing that other children at the home were just as lucky. 

 Gujarat health minister Ashok Bharat described the adoption a success of the governments save the girl-child campaign.

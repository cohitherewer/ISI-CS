 Mulayams new mantra

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 11: The Samajwadi Party is working on a new mantra ? annihilate caste system ? ahead of the Uttar Pradesh polls next year.

 The mantra, seen as a desperate coinage to blunt the multi-pronged attack against the Mulayam regime, has a problem, though. It goes against the OBC-Muslim politics the party has been playing for long.

 ? we have always believed in annihilation of castes rather than creating social division through caste politics, said Samajwadi general secretary and parliamentary party deputy leader Ramjilal Suman.

 Despite the partys track record speaking otherwise, the leadership appears certain its new mantra will tilt the political scales in its favour by the time the state goes to polls.

 The Samajwadi decision to promise a caste-less society, instead of beating its usual OBC-Muslim drum, is aimed at deflating the attacks from the BSP, Congress and Jan Morcha. The Jan Morcha had organised a massive rally a week ago in Lucknow.

 The Samajwadi plans to project itself as the representative not only of OBCs and Muslims but of all sections of the people, including upper castes, in Uttar Pradesh.

 Suman said the party would organise a campaign in all districts on June 13 to inform people about the achievements of the Mulayam ministry and the failures of the UPA government at the Centre.

 The party is keen to highlight the states policy to help poorer sections of the upper castes along with backward castes, SCs and STs.

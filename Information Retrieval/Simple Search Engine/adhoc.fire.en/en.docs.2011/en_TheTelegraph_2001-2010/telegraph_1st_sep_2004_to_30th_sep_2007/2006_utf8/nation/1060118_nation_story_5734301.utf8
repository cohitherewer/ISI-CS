 Angler tag on ayurveda study

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Despite the enthusiasm for ayurveda, there is little coordination for its scientific study or quality control, a top medical researcher has said.

 While some recent government-private partnerships have made some headway, current efforts to discover drugs from plants resemble a leisurely fishing expedition, according to Martanda Sankaran Valiathan, the former president of the Indian National Science Academy. 

 The need of the hour is to put our house in order, he says in an editorial in the journal Current Science, published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The editorial comes amid growing concern over the absence of rigorous science and quality control of herbal medicines in India.

 Studies in North America in the past two years have detected heavy metals in herbal medicines imported from India and experts have cautioned that such drugs were not subjects of scientific studies.

 Valiathan says though the World Health Organisation had relaxed guidelines for clinical research on traditional medicines a few years ago, the number of studies from India have been alarmingly few.

 The founder-director of the Sri Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology in Thiruvananthapuram says Indian efforts to discover drugs from plants are disorganised and thinly spread. Except for a lipid-lowering drug extracted from the guggul plant, all plant-based drugs such as codeine, atopine and quinine are developed outside the country, he says.

 The route from plant extracts to specific molecules to treat diseases would be faster if a random screening of thousands of plant compounds changes to a selective approach of picking up clues from traditional medicine extracts, he adds.

 The process currently followed resembles an angler on a leisurely fishing expedition instead of a hunter on a hot trail, Valiathan says.

 Government efforts to standardise the composition and processes for herbal drugs have resulted in a list of 635 herbal formulations, but the number could be 1,000 with variations in the medicines makeup and manner of production, the editorial states.

 The absence of post-market surveillance and the paucity of test laboratory facilities also make quality control of ayurvedic medicines exceedingly difficult, Valiathan says.

 The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, in a collaborative programme with private industry, has used cues from traditional medicines to develop a drug to treat a skin disease called psoriasis.

 Valiathan describes the initiative as a promising start.

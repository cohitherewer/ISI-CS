 Pak shield for Iran N-fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The Prime Minister kept America out of the picture as he defended his governments vote on Iran today, focusing solely on the Tehran-Islamabad link and the threat it posed to India.

 The emergence of a new nuclear power in the countrys neighbourhood ? especially one aided by Pakistan ? was a serious security concern, Manmohan Singh told both Houses of Parliament in his suo motu statement.

 The three-page statement didnt once mention America. Nor did it have a single word on the Indo-US nuclear pact, though the Left and the Opposition had bracketed the two issues to suggest the Iran vote was a trade-off against concessions from Washington on the July 2005 deal.

 Singh underlined the Iran threat by citing the help provided to Tehrans nuclear programme by Dr A.Q. Khan, the architect of the Pakistani bomb.

 The Pakistan card was a counter to the Left argument that by capitulating to US pressure and voting against Iran, the government had compromised Indias strategic interests.

 Harping on the threat perception, Singh said tensions in the region, where Indias vital political, economic and security interests are involved, tend to affect Indians directly. The region hosts 3.5 million Indian citizens whose welfare is a major concern of my government.

 Singh questioned Tehrans commitment as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by citing how it had gone back on a November 2004 agreement with the EU-3 (France, Germany and the UK).

 Iran had promised to voluntarily suspend all enrichment and reprocessing till questions on its past nuclear activities were clarified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But in less than a year, it renewed the production of uranium hexafluoride and resumed uranium enrichment, Singh said.

 However, aware that the vote had angered some Indian Muslims and prompted questions within the Congress on the governments pro-minority credentials, Singh stressed on Indias traditionally close and friendly relations with Iran.

 But government sources clarified that the friendship would be weighed in cost-benefit terms because Iran had never supported India on Kashmir at influential forums like the Organisation of Islamic Conferences.

 To the Left, Singh offered a token sop: a commitment on the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline plan that was thought to have been junked after the February 5 vote.

 Singh mentioned the support of important NAM (non-aligned movement) and developing countries for the vote against Iran at the IAEA, underlining that Islamic countries like Egypt and Yemen had taken the same stand as India.

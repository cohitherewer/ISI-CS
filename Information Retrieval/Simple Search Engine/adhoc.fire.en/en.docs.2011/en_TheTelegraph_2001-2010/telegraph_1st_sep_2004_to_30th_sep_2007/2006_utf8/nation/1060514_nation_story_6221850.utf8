 Militant strike on BJP rally

 Jammu, May 13: Militants hurled grenades at a BJP protest rally in Doda today, killing two and injuring more than 40 in an apparent bid to raise tension in chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azads home district, reports our correspondent. 

 Less than a fortnight ago, militants had mowed down 22 Hindus in the same district.

 Eight among the injured are critical and four have been shifted to Government Medical College.

 It was shortly before noon, when the rally protesting against the governments failure to protect minorities was passing through the general bus stand, that the grenade exploded, killing Bharat Bhushan and Munshi Ram. 

 They were among those leading the march, denouncing the government inaction in curbing terrorism.

 More than 500 people from various parts of Doda district were taking part in the procession.

 The explosion caused a stampede, as screams replaced the political slogans and blood splattered the bus stand. 

 Azad has condemned the attack. No group has taken responsibility for it.

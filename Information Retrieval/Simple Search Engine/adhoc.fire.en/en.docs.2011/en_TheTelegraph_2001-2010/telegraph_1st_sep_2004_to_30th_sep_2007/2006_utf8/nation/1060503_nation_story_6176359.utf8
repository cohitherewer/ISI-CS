 Poll fury hangs heavy on Marxist bastion

 JOHN MARY

 Kannur, May 2: Violence looms on the 15 Assembly segments that go to polls in the third and final phase of voting in Kerala tomorrow, though the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has little hope to make inroads in the traditional Left bastion.

 Of these segments, the Left Democratic Front holds 10 seats and the UDF five. Analysts said it could remain a status quo or the UDF might lose a couple of seats this time.

 All booths in Kannur, the CPM citadel, have been marked sensitive while almost half the booths in Kasargod on the Kerala-Karnataka border are vulnerable.

 Blame it on the tradition of kalaripayattu (a martial art form unique to Kerala), the Malabari militant struggle against the British colonialists or the hardcore Marxists bid to retain supremacy in this Communist outpost, the northern-most districts have witnessed a number of political killings in the past.

 Drive down National Highway 17 and the hinterland reverberates with drumbeats of theyyams ? local oracles in multicoloured attire, priests at Muthappan who take bottles of liquor for offering and party workers vying for voters attention.

 At several intersections, rival activists came face to face yesterday. The belligerent mood on the streets may shock spectators but the cadre are used to such kind of pre-poll drama.

 At Kadirur panchayat, there are several party villages where the CPM and RSS cadre mark their territory on electric posts. Rivals enter the prohibited zones at their own peril.

 The talking point in the election is that the Congress, after several decades, has fielded candidates who can stand up to face the might of the CPM.

 Congress leader Rajmohan Unnithan, pitted against CPM deputy legislature party leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, said: I may win or lose this Marxist citadel of Thalassery. But after a long time, the UDF workers here have come out in the open to campaign. 

 He added: I have been threatened by Marxist cadre that I would not go back in one piece after the elections. My campaign manager was waylaid.

 Balakrishnan retorted: My rival has been able to create an impression of a real battle, but it has been confined to the media.

 BJP candidate Sathyaprakash pointed to the scores of cadre on both sides (BJP and CPM) who have lost limbs trying to uphold party ideology. 

 We know we will be reduced to sitting ducks if the Left comes to power. But we have the resources to face challenges, Sathyaprakash added. 

 Up north on the states border, its a different fight at Manjeshwar where the CPM and the Congress have joined hands to ensure the defeat of the BJP candidate. 

 There is an uneasy calm in Kannur after the announcement of stringent punishment to five people who murdered a schoolteacher in front of students. Officers are keeping watch on the area.

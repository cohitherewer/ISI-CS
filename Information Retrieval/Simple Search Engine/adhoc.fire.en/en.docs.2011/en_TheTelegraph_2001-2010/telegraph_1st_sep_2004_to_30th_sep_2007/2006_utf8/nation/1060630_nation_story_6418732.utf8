 Left seeks House say in treaties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 29: The Left parties want a constitutional amendment so that Parliament can discuss and ratify any treaty India signs with a foreign country.

 The issue, to be discussed at a meeting of the Left Front on Tuesday, will be one of its main demands in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 24.

 We should amend the Constitution so that the government cannot sign a treaty with any foreign country unless it is ratified by Parliament. The treaty has to be not only discussed but ratified by Parliament, said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan.

 The Lefts demand comes in the wake of the endorsement of a bill that will guide the implementation of the Indo-US nuclear deal by the international relations committees of the US House of Representatives and the Senate. 

 The CPM politburo had yesterday sent out a statement criticising the bill and expressing apprehension that it would force the government to compromise its foreign policy.

 The Left parties will raise the demand for a constitutional amendment in and outside Parliament. 

 Their leaders said Parliament had not been taken into full confidence about the Indo-US nuclear deal while the US Congress was kept informed. How can this situation go on? asked Bardhan.

 One of the clauses in the bill that has angered the Left is that the US will secure Indias full and active participation in its efforts to dissuade, isolate and, if necessary, sanction and contain Iran. 

 How can we give such an assurance ? asked Bardhan.

 BJP breathes fire

 The BJP today fielded Murli Manohar Joshi to launch a shrill attack on the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 Iterating that the BJP was not averse to abrogating the deal in the future, Joshi said the intrusive and objectionable provisions of the bill would have an impact on Indias strategic interests.

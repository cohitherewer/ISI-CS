 Land use fee

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: Real estate developers and individuals planning to construct on agricultural plots will now have to pay differential fees for change in land use in different areas. 

 The West Bengal Town and Country (Planning and Development) Second Amendment Bill passed in the Assembly today empowered development authorities to charge fees in view of the level of physical and socio-economic development of the planning area.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the decision would not hurt the middle class individuals who want to build a house on land developed by an authority.

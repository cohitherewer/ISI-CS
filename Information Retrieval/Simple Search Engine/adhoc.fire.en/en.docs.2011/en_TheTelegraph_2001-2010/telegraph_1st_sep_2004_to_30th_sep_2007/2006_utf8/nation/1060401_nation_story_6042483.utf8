 Culture shock for Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, March 31: Development doles to Saifai, his home village in Etawah district, posed no problem for Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 It was easy earmarking Rs 300 crore in the state budget for upgrading the airstrip and the hospital, beautifying roads, setting up a university and a guest house.

 But when the chief minister put Saifai ahead of Lucknow and Ayodhya as a place of cultural and historical interest, Delhi put its foot down.

 Mulayam not only needed central funds to set up a centre to research and showcase the areas culture and heritage, but also Delhis sanction for it to be counted as one of the countrys 50-odd, prestigious multipurpose cultural complexes (MPCCs).

 So, nestling with Lucknow, Ayodhya, Baghpat and Jhansi ? in the states proposal for five such complexes ? was the name of Tircarawacha, a little-known village 2 km from Saifai. This complex was designated a category I MPCC ? with better research facilities ? while the rest were to be category II, devoted mainly to documentation, display and preservation of folk traditions.

 It brought a stinker from Varsha Sinha, under-secretary in the Union department of culture. The estimates for this MPCC are not realistic and have been made without taking into account the specific need of each location. The justification for a category I MPCC in Etawah is also not clear, her letter said while rejecting the entire plan.

 A senior bureaucrat in the state culture and tourism department said the proposal for Etawah had led to the blanket thumbs-down. The schemes for Ayodhya and Baghpat (an important archaeological site) had obtained a favourable response. But the way these were put in category II, and their importance played down in comparison with Etawahs, caused doubts, he said.

 The culture of Lucknow and Etawah are virtually the same and the proposal for separate complexes made no sense, the bureaucrat added.

 Uttar Pradesh now plans to build the centres with its own money, but they will have to do without the MPCC tag.

 The Congress has trained its guns on the chief ministers largesse to his home turf. State unit chief Salman Khursheed has alleged that funds are flowing to those schools and colleges in Saifai whose managing committees have Mulayams family members.

 Also being questioned is the need to upgrade the airstrip into one big enough for Boeings. Currently, its used by helicopters and small planes that bring in Samajwadi Party bigwigs and their Bollywood friends during elections and the annual, glitzy Saifai Festival.

 Lid off lewd bosses

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 23: When a woman assistant director in the state employment and planning department handed her map drawings to her boss, his remarks stunned her.

 Your maps lack proper measurements. Can you at least tell me the measurements of your bra and panties? the commissioner of employment and training and factories, K. Mangapathi Rao, asked her.

 A trainee at a government institute for anganwadi teachers was no less surprised at her trainers remarks.

 I can see you are breast-feeding your baby. It shows. Your left one is leaking, P.R. Krishnamurthy, trainer-cum-consultant, allegedly told her. Your husband should be so happy that your buttocks are so full that he may not need pillows.

 The lid was taken off sexual harassment by senior bureaucrats in Hyderabad when angry lady officials from Raos department demonstrated at the secretariat on Friday.

 He (Rao) objected to my wearing a salwar-kurta and told me to wear only saris, said Prema (name changed). He said I looked sexy in saris and ugly in other clothes.

 She says Rao told her: This is not a temple ? if you come so badly dressed you cannot work for me.

 Another woman official said the 1988-batch IAS officer had refused to let her leave his chamber till she spelt out her chest, waist and hip measurements.

 It was a second Saturday but I was asked to come. I had heard about him misbehaving with sweepers, attendants and typists, but I never thought he would act this way with a gazetted officer.

 She was allegedly told: You are very sexy. Are all women in your family like that? What is the measurement of your waist? How come you have tyres on your waist at such a young age?

 Rao was suspended yesterday on the chief ministers orders. Contacted by the media, the bureaucrat said his question about the innerwear measurements had been made in a lighter vein.

 State womens commission chairperson Mary Ravindranath has summoned Rao as well as anganwadi trainer Krishnamurthy.

 In group discussions, he (Krishnamurthy) would ask us which breast we normally used to feed our babies and later make vulgar comments that it showed, said schoolteacher Puspa (name changed).

 As she and fellow trainees agitated at their institute on Friday, another schoolteacher alleged that Krishnamurthy had a habit of commenting on trainees physical assets and, sometimes, singing dirty couplets about them.

 Asked why they hadnt reported him earlier, she said: He could disqualify us and make us spend another three months in training.

 Raos subordinates, too, said they had been wary of complaining to the departments grievance cell for fear of their careers suffering.

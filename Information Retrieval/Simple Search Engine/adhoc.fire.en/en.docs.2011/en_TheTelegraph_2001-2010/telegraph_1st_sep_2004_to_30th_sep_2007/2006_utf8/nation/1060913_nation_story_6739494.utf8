 Strategic dialogue with Brazil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Brasilia, Sept. 12: India and Brazil today decided to start a bilateral strategic dialogue covering regional and global issues such as energy security and the international security situation, including the challenge of defeating terrorism.

 The dialogue will be conducted by Indias security adviser and the corresponding authorities of the Brazilian government.

 Nine agreements on bilateral cooperation were signed today. One of them was on cooperation on training and exchange on soccer. Another related to cooperation between ONGC and Petrobras, Brazils state-owned oil company. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a one-on-one meeting here this morning, discussing cooperation between the two countries at both bilateral and international levels. Singh is the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Brazil since Indira Gandhis visit to the country in 1968. Speaking at a ceremony to mark the signing of the agreements, Singh called his visit a voyage of personal rediscovery.

 Both sides agreed to station defence attaches in each others capital. They also agreed to establish a joint defence committee in pursuance of the defence agreement signed in December 2003, once some formalities for this are completed. 

 Both the Prime Ministers underscored the importance of the reforms of the UN in order to make it more effective and attuned to present-day realities. India and Brazil also decided to work closely within the framework of G4 to realise their ambition of becoming members of the expanded UN security council.

 Drugged doctor runs into cop slumber

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Nov. 12: A 30-year-old doctor robbed in a Siliguri-Calcutta bus was tossed around police stations in North 24-Parganas on Friday in a futile effort to lodge a complaint. 

 Kaushik Bose, a post-graduate student of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital was allegedly drugged by a fellow-passenger on Thursday night. He lost his mobile phone, pen-drive and some cash.

 The incident came less than a fortnight after Krishna Kumar Pandey of Santoshpur was robbed and beaten up by four miscreants in the taxi he boarded from Esplanade. On November 2, a bleeding Pandey was turned away from three police stations that told him the scene of the crime didnt fall under their jurisdiction.

 In Islampur, the bus had a flat tyre. While the tyre was being replaced, I became friendly with the passenger sitting next to me. He opened a packet of biscuits and offered me some. I had the biscuits and lost consciousness, said Bose. He woke up as the North Bengal State Transport Corporation bus neared Calcutta airport, but found his watch and mobile phone missing. Groggy, he fell asleep again. He was supposed to get off at Ultadanga. 

 When I woke up next, the conductor told me the bus was near Nicco Park. I got off there, said Bose. Apparently, the bus, after dropping all passengers at Esplanade, the last stop, was heading to its Salt Lake depot. It isnt clear why he wasnt woken up at Esplanade. He finally took a taxi to his Dakshineswar home.

 Bose, along with family members, went to Bidhannagar (East) police station in Salt Lake to lodge a complaint but was told to go to Bidhannagar (South). From there, they were sent to Belghoria police station, which oversees Dakshineswar. We were told the complaint should be lodged in Siliguri. I am no longer interested in lodging the complaint, Bose said.

 We will look into his complaint if he lodges one with me, said Basab Dasgupta, Barrackpore additional superintendent of police.

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: An anti- imperialist body fielding an American for the vice-presidents post in the student polls at Jawaharlal Nehru University. A traditionally pro-upper caste students wing nominating a scheduled tribe candidate for the same post.

 For JNU, which went to elections today, this is a season of firsts.

 Tyler Walker Williams contested on an All India Students Association (AISA) ticket. The AISA, the students body of the CPI-ML, currently holds the post of president of the JNU students union.

 Apart from his fair skin, Tyler hardly wears anything that bares his American identity. An M.Phil student in Hindi, he is almost always in khadi-kurta and pyjamas. A jhola completes the JNU look.

 The other candidate in this years elections who has sparked a buzz in the varsity is Manoj Kumar, a PhD student in sociology. This is the first time the BJP-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad has nominated a scheduled tribe student.

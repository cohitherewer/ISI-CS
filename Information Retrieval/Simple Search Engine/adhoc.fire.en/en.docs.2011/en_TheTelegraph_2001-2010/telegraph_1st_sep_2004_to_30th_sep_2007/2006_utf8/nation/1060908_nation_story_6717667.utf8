 No relief yet on pilgrim subsidy

 Lucknow (PTI): The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court has refused to grant interim relief on the central and state governments plea for removal of a stay on subsidies for Haj and other religious pilgrimage.

 Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanavati and Uttar Pradesh advocate-general S.M.A. Kazmi, who appeared before the court on Thursday for a stay on the courts August 25 order, said it would affect arrangements for the Haj pilgrimage and the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.

 A division bench of Justices A.K. Yog and Shailendra Saxena, while refusing any relief, granted a weeks time to the petitioner to file a rejoinder and fixed September 18 as the date for the final hearing.

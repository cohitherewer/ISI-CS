 3 more avenues to unclog Petrapole

 A STAFF REPORTER

Petrapole, June 19: Delhi will develop three more sites in Bengal as land customs stations and upgrade the Petrapole facility to streamline Indo-Bangla border trade.

 The three land customs stations ? legalised entry points for trade ? are expected to help decongest the Petrapole point, which accounts for 80 per cent of Indian exports to Bangladesh and almost all imports from that country.

 Unofficial transactions do take place through the three points ? Fulbari in Jalpaiguri, Mahdipur in Malda and Changrabandha in Cooch Behar ? but there is no infrastructure or regulatory mechanism there now.

 The Centre will develop full-fledged customs stations at the three places as part of an effort to upgrade 13 stations across the country. Of the 13 stations, eight are on the Bangladesh border, four near Nepal and one close to Pakistan.

 After visiting the customs office at Petrapole, junior commerce minister Jairam Ramesh said the Centre was planning to spend Rs 800 crore over the next three years to develop the stations.

 Ramesh, who was accompanied by Bengal industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen, said a single entity, Land Customs Stations Authority of India, would be set up for their better management. It is a depressing experience visiting these facilities. They must be upgraded, Ramesh said.

 He proposed an internatio-nal logistics hub, besides a Calcutta-Petrapole expressway, to decongest the 90-km stretch. 

 Sops for Bangladesh

 India today offered to abolish duty on 4,200 items from Bangladesh by 2008. Ramesh said the concession would allow Bangladesh to make 75 per cent of its exports to India duty-free. But he accused the government there of dragging its feet on the Tatas proposals.

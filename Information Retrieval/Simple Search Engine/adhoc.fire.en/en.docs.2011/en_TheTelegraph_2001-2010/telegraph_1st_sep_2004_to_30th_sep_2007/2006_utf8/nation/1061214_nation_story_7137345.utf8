 Lucknow, Dec. 13: An 11-year-old boy has been reported missing, adding another name to Uttar Pradeshs growing list of child abductions.

 Ratan Vajpayee, the son of an advocate in Sitapur, about 70 km from here, did not return home after going out with his friends for a walk last evening. This morning, his father Umashankar got a ransom call. He lodged a police complaint and a hunt was launched.

 The incident comes a day after 13-year-old Ankit, who was abducted last Friday while playing cricket near his house, was found dead. 

 In November, the son of Adobe India CEO Naresh Gupta was kidnapped yards from his Noida home. Three-year-old Anant returned a few days later amid reports that a huge ransom had been paid to his kidnappers.

 Umashankar, an advocate, said he waited the whole night in the hope that his son might have gone to visit relatives and they would bring him back home. But frantic calls to all their relatives and Ratans friends failed to give any clue to his whereabouts. 

 He did not come back, and this morning I received a ransom call, he told police.

 A Class VI student of Kendriya Vidyalaya in Sitapur, Ratan was abducted on his way home, the complaint said.

 One of his friends said Ratan was walking back home, a quarter of a kilometre away, when he last saw him.

 The police suspect the involvement of a distant relative who is locked in a feud with Ratans family. They refused to divulge any other details. 

 The caller asked for a ransom of around Rs 10 lakh, the police said. Unlike R.K. Viswakarma, who could not afford to pay Rs 5 lakh to get back son Ankit, Umashankar is well off. 

 A student of Lucknow University and two graduates have been arrested for kidnapping and murdering Ankit and they have confessed to the crime. Today, Lucknow police arrested four others and seized the car in which his body had been taken to Barabanki, where it was dumped. 

 There is an uncanny similarity in the three incidents the boys were kidnapped close to their homes and the motive seemed to be ransom.

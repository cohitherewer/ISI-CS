 BJP muted, Left vocal on US deal

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: So long the guns had boomed only Left and Right. Now the Congress has put in a word.

 The party yesterday ended its tactical silence to defend Indias decision to vote with the West against Irans controversial nuclear programme.

 It told the Marxists that no single group in a coalition has a veto, especially in foreign policy affairs.

 The Congress was not the sole source of relief for Singh. Even the BJP ? which usually goes for the jugular ? was unusually muted while commenting on the Iran vote and Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkars recent comments against the nuclear deal with the US.

 It had expended its firepower on election commissioner Naveen Chawla, demanding his removal for alleged Congress links.

 For the Congress, it was the first time that it had sprung to the governments defence since coming to power. The partys stock response used to be that in a coalition, every constituent had a viewpoint and no issue was insoluble. But yesterday, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said it is time we realise that while we respect and listen to all points of view and take time to absorb them, no single party or group in a coalition has a veto.

 Indias foreign policy, he added, has a continuity and stability that no responsible party should seek to undermine. The decision to vote against Iran, he said, was guided solely by national interest.

 Congress sources said the party backed the other critical decisions like allowing foreign investment in retail and airport privatisation as they were taken in public interest.

 At the end of the day, in a large coalition, you will have disaffected groups. If the end result is based on public interest, we will earn popular goodwill, said one.

 The sources also stressed that none of these decisions was rollbackable and the budget later this month would pr-obably formalise FDI in retail.

 They said if the perception was that the retail and airport issues were far removed from the aam admi (common person), the counterweight comes in the form of the social sector initiatives the government has taken. Our India shines for everyone, from the khaas admi (privileged person) to the aam admi, said a source.

 On the other side of the divide, a senior BJP leader said the government should not be heckled everyday on strategic issues. His party, he added, would reserve its arguments till after the Prime Minister makes a statement in the budget session. 

 The Left today kept up its tirade against the US nuke deal. Both the CPM and the CPI asked the government to come clean on the fears expressed by Kakodkar.

 What Mr Kakodkar has said now, we have already said earlier. These are our concerns also. We have asked the government to be more transparent about its plan for the separation of civil and military nuclear facilities, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.

 Kakodkar had voiced fears that putting fast breeder reactors on the civilian list would not be in Indias strategic interest, both for long-term energy security and for maintaining nuclear weapons capabilities. He also felt that any such move would push India into another import trap and make it dependent on supplies of imported enriched uranium.

 TN babus blow govt trumpet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Sept. 20: For once, the babus were not living up to their reputation. But then, nobody was complaining.

 At least, not the men from the media who had assembled at the Rajaji Hall last evening.

 Led by chief secretary L.K. Tripathy, almost the entire brass of Tamil Nadus bureaucracy made history at the 204-year-old building by hosting a news conference, the first in at least two decades, breaking a long tradition of information opacity.

 As the surprised scribes volleyed questions and the bureaucrats reeled off replies, one message was clear the new DMK government wants to reach out to the people.

 The conference started at 6 and, as the evening progressed at the hall built to commemorate the British victory over Tipu Sultan, it seemed as if the babus were gearing up to a new order under the Right to Information Act.

 Tripathy and his team took time to highlight the new projects under a record-high state budget of Rs 39,861 crore this year. He and his colleagues, including finance secretary Gnanadesikan, IT secretary Chandramouli, industries secretary Sakthi Kanta Das and rural development secretary Ashok Varadan Shetty, rolled out scheme after scheme, making everyone wonder where the funds would come from.

 As expected, two popular schemes of the M. Karunanidhi government hogged the limelight at the conference, described as the chief secretarys brain child. The first was free colour television sets for all poor and other households that do not have one, and the second was distribution of two acres of wasteland free to each landless farmer family, modelled on a similar scheme in Bengal.

 On the colour TV scheme, Tripathy said the pre-poll promise was on target as 26,000 sets had been distributed in the first phase on September 15 and 16. By March 2007, we will give another 25 lakh sets with each 14-inch TV costing Rs 3,000, he said.

 Tripathy then suddenly transported his audience to the Nilgiris district.

 The state, he said, faced a marketing challenge when officials had to take the colour TV scheme to 8,797 tribal families in 581 hamlets in the Nilgiris, where life is a constant struggle for survival. Many of these hamlets, he added, did not have electricity.

 But the TV scheme opened up an infrastructure opportunity in the hilly district. It kicked off a journey that literally brought thousands from darkness to light, the chief secretary said.

 Within a month, the districts administrative machinery rallied behind collector Santosh Mishra to plant electric poles and take light to the dark hamlets.

 The result: 4,008 tribal ho- useholds were given connections and 64 far-flung villages electrified. The project, Tripathy said, cost Rs 2.5 crore.

 Tripathy said 1,600 tribal households, deep in the reserved forest areas of the district, were still to be covered and added that the Centres permission has been sought to electrify these hamlets, too.

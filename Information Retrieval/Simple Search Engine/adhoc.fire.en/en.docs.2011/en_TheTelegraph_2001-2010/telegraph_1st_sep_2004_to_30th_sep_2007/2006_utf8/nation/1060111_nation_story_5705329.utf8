 Salem scent in UP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 10: Uttar Pradesh police today claimed to have foiled a kidnap plot, allegedly hatched by Abu Salems gang, and held this up as proof that the dons network was still active in India.

 The polices special task force (STF) arrested six persons in Lucknow early in the morning and told reporters the gang had been poised to abduct two businessmen this evening, one in Lucknow and the other in Delhi.

 The arrested men have revealed that the Salem gangs India operations were being overseen by Ejaz Lakrawala, a gangster based in Dhaka, STF additional superintendent of police Vijay Bhushan said.

 They had planned to route the money to Lakrawala through the hawala channel, Bhushan added.

 The STF will contact Mumbai police on the latest revelation so that they can interrogate the don about it.

 The arrests came a day after a CBI court ordered that Salem be brought over to Lucknow in connection with a fake passport case.

 Saeed Raees Ahmed, Nabi Ahmed, Raj Kumar Pandey and Vishal ? from Uttar Pradesh ? and Rajesh Kumar Kamble and Chand Mohammed from Mumbai were traced to a hideout off Lakshman Mela Ground Road and a brief encounter followed. 

 Lakrawala was to pay them Rs 5 lakh for the abductions, Bhushan said.

 The arrests also indicate that Salem, who hails from Azamgarh and has lived in Lucknow, is banking on his north India network as the police are on high alert in Mumbai, a state police officer said.

 Five pistols, ammunition, six cellphones, ATM cards, a car and a motorcycle were seized from the six, sources said.

 After joining Dawood Ibrahim a decade ago, Lakrawala had set up base in Bangkok. He was D-companys pointman in many high-profile extortion cases.

 The gangster later fell out with Dawood but stayed in touch with Salem. He then started his own gang, usually targeting businessmen and film personalities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Military armed with money power

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: The generals were today given unprecedented financial powers by an order that whittles down the authority of the defence ministry and authorises the top brass of the army, the navy and the air force to sanction expenses for running the military.

 Service headquarters will now sanction expenses up to 70 per cent of the revenue budget that accounts for salaries and running expenses of the armed forces. The revenue budget for the current year is Rs 51,542 crore.

 The order grants a large measure of financial autonomy to the headquarters. It was issued despite serious allegations of misuse of funds ? a case made public last week involved a lieutenant general and a major general ? that are being investigated internally.

 The immediate effect of the devolution of financial powers is the hike in the sanctioning authority of the personal staff officers (PSO) of the chiefs of the army, the navy and the air force, a source told The Telegraph.

 For example, the master general ordnance (MGO), a lieutenant general who reports directly to the chief of army staff and who is responsible for procurements in the day-to-day running of the army and its equipment, will now have sanctioning authority up to Rs 50 crore. Earlier, the ceiling was Rs 20 crore.

 For the air force and the navy, the air officer (maintenance), an air marshal, and the chief of materials, a vice-admiral, have been granted comparable powers but the ceiling corresponds to the share of the air force and the navy in the total defence budget ? 28 per cent and 18.14 per cent.

 The guidelines say that expenses should lead directly to an increase in operational efficiency. For example, in the case of the air force, the ministry has ordered that operational efficiency of its fleet of transport aircraft (mainly AN32s and IL76s) should be improved from 30 to 50 per cent. Service headquarters would also not be at liberty to blame delays on bureaucratic processes in the ministry.

 The service headquarters till now had a direct say in 50 per cent of the revenue budget. That ceiling has been raised to 70 per cent. The order applies also to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The ministry has also told the service headquarters that procurement time for items (such as spares for aircraft) should be an average three to four months. The current average is about nine months.

 With the devolution of financial powers, the defence ministry has adopted a policy of mostly confining itself to long-term contracts.

 In its order, the ministry said it was devolving a large measure of the powers of its department of defence to army headquarters. The army accounts for nearly 47.5 per cent of the total defence budget of Rs 89,000 crore for 2006-2007. Orders for the air force and the navy have also been issued. The order also empowers the headquarters to sanction capital expenditure up to Rs 10 crore.

 Defence spending

 The countrys 11th defence plan is almost ready and envisages an increase in spending to 2.57 per cent of the GDP from the present 2.33 per cent. Official sources today said expenditure on the strategic sector would grow by nine per cent during the plan period starting next year.

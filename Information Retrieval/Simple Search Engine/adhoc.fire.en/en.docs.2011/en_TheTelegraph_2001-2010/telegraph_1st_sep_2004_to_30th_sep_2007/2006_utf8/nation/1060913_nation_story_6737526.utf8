The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dont be a Gandhi amp; go back, bhai said

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Yakub (right) with Tiger 

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: Minutes after the days verdicts were announced, someone began screaming above the courtroom drone.

 You are turning good people into terrorists. You are turning innocents into terrorists, Yakub Memon, shaking with anger, shouted at judge Pramod Kode.

 As a hush fell on the packed audience of 200, he continued, without naming either Tiger Memon or Dawood Ibrahim: Bhai had told me 13 years ago it wont be of any use trying to be (Mahatma) Gandhi and returning to Hindustan. It took me 13 years to realise it.

 The reference was to his return from Dubai with seven other members of his family in 1994, the reason for which stays veiled in mystery. But the frustration of the man, who had surrendered 12 years ago hoping for a let-off but has been languishing in jail ever since, was unmistakable.

 Eyes full of contempt, Yakub spat out: Terah saal se aap humko ******* bana rahe ho. Aap sab log bewakoof ban rahe hain (For 13 years you have been making ******* out of us. All of you are being made fools of).

 Yakub was the only one of the seven (surviving) accused Memons to be convicted of all the charges brought against him. But that wasnt the trigger for the soft-spoken mans outburst. 

 The provocation was Kode refusal to delay his sister-in-law Rubeenas re-arrest by a week so that she could go on nursing his ailing mother Hanifa and make arrangements to take care of her children.

 Rubeenas conviction meant her bail had to be cancelled and she had to be re-arrested on the court premises. The judge later granter her bail.

 Earlier, arguing against Yakubs plea for a seven-day breather, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said the law didnt allow such liberties.

 Sitting on the benches for accused women, Raheen Memon who has been acquitted began sobbing as she watched her husband lose his cool. A woman journalist sitting next to her tried to console her.

 Raheen continued to weep as a disgusted Yakub stormed out of the courtroom. Kode said: Where are the police? Why doesnt someone control him? A group of police officers hurried after Yakub and brought him back. He later apologised to the judge.

 Earlier, one man stood out from the courtroom crowd. Deepak Nachnani held up a placard with a bizarre demand: arrest Dawood and publicly flog him at Flora Fountain.

 Six girl students from the K.C. College of Journalism, granted special permission to attend court today, giggled through the proceedings.

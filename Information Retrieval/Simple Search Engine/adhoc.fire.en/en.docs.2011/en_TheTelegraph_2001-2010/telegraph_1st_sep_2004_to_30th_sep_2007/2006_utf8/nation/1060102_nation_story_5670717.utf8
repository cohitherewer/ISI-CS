 Furious villagers rant at Nitish

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rampur, Jan. 1: Chief minister Nitish Kumar, on his first visit to a site of killing after assuming office, was given a grim reminder today.

 People in his predecessor Rabri Devis constituency, where a woman and her five children were burnt alive, vented their fury saying they had brought about a change of regime to get a better deal.

 We did not wait for 15 years and made you chief minister for this. The corruption of the police station in-charge, the block development officer and the circle officer of Raghopur has known no bounds. Their conduct has been shameless. We want the BDO and the CO removed and the police official hanged, screamed a woman who broke through Nitishs security cordon. 

 She said she was ready to shoot the policeman and face the consequences.

 The chief minister sat numbed by disbelief as the villagers poured out their agony and scorn, mostly directed at police station in-charge Nuruddin Khan, who is on the run.

 A young man came with three goats that Khan had kept in his house for a feast. He eats, drinks, makes merry?. His men enter our houses during nights when women are sleeping. He has been busy transporting felled tree trunks away from Raghopur in connivance with the BDO and the CO, the woman told Nitish.

 The chief minister immediately asked a police team, led by director-general of police A.R. Sinha, to carry out an inspection. They returned after spotting some 30 big logs, thus vindicating the villagers allegation. 

 This matter needs to be investigated, Sinha said. 

 Nitish directed him to go ahead.

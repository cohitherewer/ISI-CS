 Jain catalogue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 27: A group of scholars has completed cataloguing Jain manuscripts in the prestigious British Library under a project that spanned over a decade.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today received the first copy of the 1,278-page catalogue ? part of a larger project of making sense of scattered Jain works in libraries in the West ? and rued that India has done little to tap documents to recreate its history.

 Let us acknowledge that despite our pride as a people in our ancient civilisation, our domestic efforts to preserve its legacy have been inadequate, he said. Consequently, we have lost, perhaps irretrievably, part of our heritage.

 Singh said in an ancient land like India, we can never be satisfied with the variety and quantity of material we have used for recreating the past.

 Work on the catalogue began after the British Library in 1993 approached the Institute of Jainology, an NGO based largely in Britain, to make a list of Jain manuscripts it had.

 The library has hundreds of Jain manuscripts ? from those written in the 13th century to copies made in the 20th century.

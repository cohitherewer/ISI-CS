 Labs trade test charges 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: The controversy over pesticides in soft drinks today took a fresh turn with scientists from a UK laboratory questioning the credibility of the findings of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

 Two scientists from the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) today said the CSEs written report does not provide confirmation of the identity of pesticide residues claimed to be found in the soft drinks.

 There is no evidence in the CSE report that, even if pesticides were present, the levels were measured with any accuracy, said Stewart Reynolds, head of the analytical services at the UK laboratory. 

 The CSE report also does not comply with certain quality standards, said John Gilbert, science director at the CSL. Their results also had some unusual pesticide findings, Gilbert said.

 The scientists, who admitted that they flew here at the request of Coca-Cola, said tests in their own laboratory on soft drink samples from India showed less than 0.1 part per billion of pesticide residue.

 Gilbert said the CSEs results might have been due to lack of experience.

 In response, the CSE said tonight that it had used internationally established and accepted methods for its analysis. The contention that only a foreign laboratory can test its products is patronising and borders on racism, the CSE said. 

 It also said its laboratory has state-of-the-art equipment, including devices used to reconfirm tests on pesticide residues.

 The CSE added that the UK lab tested samples provided by Coca-Cola, but did not pick up samples from the open market as had been done by the CSE.

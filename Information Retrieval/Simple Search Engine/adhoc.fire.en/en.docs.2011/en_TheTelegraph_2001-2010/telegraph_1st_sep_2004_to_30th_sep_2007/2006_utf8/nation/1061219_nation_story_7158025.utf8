 Urgent need for Sukhoi 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 A Sukhoi 30 takes off

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Indian Air Force has proposed an urgent purchase of 40 Sukhoi 30 Mki multi-role combat aircraft from Russia.

 The proposal is aimed at overcoming fears that a depletion in squadron strength will translate into an increase in threat perception from Pakistan and China. 

 The proposal from air headquarters was made to the defence ministry and has been cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) headed by defence minister A.K. Antony.

 The size of the purchase is not known but is likely to be upwards of Rs 4,500 crore. Precise figures will be reached only if the configuration of each aircraft the combat elements that go into them is known.

 Air headquarters has made the proposal for three reasons. First, the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft programme has fallen behind schedule. Second, the oldest generations of the MiG-21 the mainstay of the IAFs fighter fleet have to be decommissioned. Third, the government has still not cleared the Requests for Proposals (tenders) for 126 multi-role combat aircraft (sub-20 tonne category).

 The proposal from the IAF and the DAC has yet to be cleared by the cabinet committee on security. But Antony said on Saturday that things are moving very fast now.

 Letter tiff ends in House duel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The stalemate in the Lok Sabha over Atal Bihari Vajpayees letter to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee ended today, but not the bitterness.

 Bahar jung rahegi (outside the House, the war will continue), parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told reporters.

 The mood was reflected in the House as both sides had their say on Vajpayees stinging missive to the Speaker questioning his ability to inspire confidence in the Opposition.

 There was no apology from the BJP veteran, as the Left had repeatedly demanded yesterday, triggering clashes with the Opposition and forcing adjournments. Instead, L.K. Advani said all Opposition leaders endorsed the letter.

 An NDA resolution, adopted earlier in the day, said the coalition stood by every word of the letter.

 The Lok Sabha began the day with an uproar the Left wanted to discuss the letter and the BJP-led Opposition protested prompting an adjournment till noon.

 During the gap hour, Mukherjee and Advani, the leader of Opposition, apparently worked out a way of ending the stalemate: both sides would place their views and move on.

 When the House met again at 12, leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee read out a statement expressing deep anguish over the aspersions the letter casts on the Speakers impartiality. 

 The stab, he said, was more painful as it came from the pen of a person who had struggled to uphold the dignity of the House over decades and is known for his commitment to parliamentary values.

 Then it was Advanis turn. He said the letter should have been tabled in the House, but the Speaker did not want it to be quoted. But every member of the NDA strongly endorses every word in the letter.

 His tone softened a bit when he said the letter could not be regarded as casting an aspersion on the Chair. Instead, he added, it was the sage advice of a senior statesman to the presiding officer of the House.

 When BJP leaders charged him with showing disrespect to their leader, Chatterjee said he had the privilege of working with Vajpayee since 1971. Dont think you have greater respect for him. 

 Pathak leak notices

 The Speaker today rejected notices of breach of privilege against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the Pathak report leak. But he said he expected the government to probe how the report reached the media before being tabled in Parliament.

 Heat on power secy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today piled heat on Union power secretary R.V. Shahi, denouncing him as a Reliance man.

 He does not reply to letters. He does not reply to anything. His has been a funny appointment.... He came to this place straight from Reliance, Bardhan said, after releasing an interim report by a panel of electricity employees and engineers on power reforms.

 The Left is opposed to the reforms in the power sector that the UPA government wants to push through. 

 Its leaders also think that Shahi is one of the key persons pushing for the reforms.

 Bardhan said Shahi has not responded to his letters urging a review of the reforms. So, the CPI general secretary has sought the Prime Ministers intervention.

 Today, he told reporters that the CPI would march to Parliament on March 1 during the budget session if their call for a discussion on power reforms went unheeded.

 Since P.M. Sayeeds death, the Left leader said, there has been no one to talk to in the power ministry. Almost a month has passed (since Sayeeds death), but there is no power minister we can talk to, he complained.

 Lights out

 In a coincidence, the lights went out at the press club where Bardhan and other power reform critics were holding house. 

 A complete blackout ensued when former atomic energy commission chief M.R. Srinivasan, who came out with an interim report on power reforms, began explaining the shortcomings in the Electricity Act of 2003. 

 Bardhan and Srinivasan joked that the power outage was an example of what the CPI leader called a failed experiment with Delhis power utility.

 Poll relief for convicts

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR 

 New 

 Delhi, Nov. 24: A convicted politician can contest 

 elections if the conviction order is stayed by a superior 

 court before he or she files the nomination, the Supreme 

 Court has ruled.

 Setting aside a Karnataka High Court order, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal said disqualification because of conviction does not hold after the conviction has been stayed.

 The high court had set aside the election of Ravikant S. Patil to the Karnataka Assembly on the ground that he had been convicted and sentenced to seven years imprisonment for rape by a Maharashtra trial court. Patil had argued his conviction had been stayed by Bombay High Court, but it was rejected.

 A person sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years stands disqualified from contesting elections according to the Representation of People Act. The disqualification continues for six years after his release.

 In July 2000, Patil had moved Bombay High Court, requesting it to stay his conviction so that he could contest the Assembly polls in 2004. He filed his nomination and got elected while his appeal was pending before the high court, which later acquitted him. 

 But despite his acquittal, Karnataka High Court set aside his election, saying the relevant date for ascertaining disqualification was that of nomination and election.

 The apex court, which upheld Patils election, however, cautioned courts against suspending convictions of poll nominees without looking into the ramifications of such action. This power should be exercised only in exceptional circumstances, where failure to stay conviction would lead to injustice and irreversible consequences, the court added.

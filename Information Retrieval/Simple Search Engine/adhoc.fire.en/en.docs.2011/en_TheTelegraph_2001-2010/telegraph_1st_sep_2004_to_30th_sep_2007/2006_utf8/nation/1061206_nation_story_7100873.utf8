 Turban apology to Sikh in US

 Washington, Dec. 5 (PTI): A restaurant in the US has tendered a formal apology to a turban-wearing Sikh who was denied entry by a doorman seeking to enforce its no hats rule.

 Hansdip Singh Bindra was denied entry by the Richbrau Brewing Co. restaurant in Richmond, Virginia, when he visited it on November 24 with his extended family.

 Bindra attempted to explain that he was not wearing a hat, but a turban that was a mandated religious article of faith for Sikhs.

 There were all sorts of people there, and yet I was being singled out solely because of the way I looked, said Bindra. I wear a turban everyday as a Sikh, its who I am.

 In the apology letter addressed to Bindra, Michael Byrne, the director of operations at the restaurant, noted: ...I would like to extend to you an apology for our doorman enforcing the no headgear policy literally.

 The apology came after the Sikh American legal defence and education fund wrote to Byrne on behalf of Bindra that a Sikh turban, a Jewish yarmulke, and a Muslim hijab were all federally protected religious articles of faith and, as such, were allowed to be worn by individuals in all circumstances.

 Celebrate Diwali with NatGeo 

 K.P. NAYAR

 The cover of Deborah Heiligmans 

 book

 Washington, Oct. 15: President George W. Bush 

 may once again skip any Diwali celebrations at the White 

 House this year, but National Geographic has more than made 

 up for it by bringing out a new series of childrens 

 books starting with Diwali.

 The prestigious launch of Celebrate Diwali with Sweets, Lights, and Fireworks by the nearly one-and-a-quarter-century-old National Geographic Society, a global pioneer in celebrating the treasures of nature and cultures, is the result of more than a years effort.

 For Indian Americans, it is a compensation of sorts for the failure of their three-year-plus petition drive to get the US Postal Service to issue a Diwali stamp in time for the Indian festival this month.

 National Geographic said in a press release that its Diwali offering is part of a new series called Holidays Around the World that invites young readers to learn about celebrations and ceremonies worldwide.

 It is a welcome effort in this country, where people have very little exposure to the outside world at a time when ignorance about other religions and cultures is negatively contributing to a clash of civilisations.

 The book, aimed at the 6-9 age group, has been written by Deborah Heiligman, who got a fund of response from around the world to her request a year ago for photos and recipes about Diwali and Ramazan.

 A book on the Muslim month of fasting, Celebrate Ramadan and Eid Al-Fitr with Praying, Fasting and Charity, has also just been brought out by National Geographic. 

 When I first started writing this book, I had never even heard of Diwali, says Heiligman, who has been writing for children for 25 years. 

 So to write the book I read a lot, talked to a lot of people, professors, journalists, neighbours, friends, store-owners and waiters. I was lucky enough to go to a Diwali party, I hope to go to more!

 She also used the services of a consultant, Vasudha Narayanan, who is distinguished professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida. Narayanan, a past president of the American Academy of Religion, has included notes to parents and teachers in the book. 

 Its lively text introduces readers, unfamiliar with Diwali, to the joy of the festival. At the back are Diwali recipes, a glossary, a childrens version of the popular Diwali card game of teen pathi, a map, and a resource list of books and websites. 

 Each title in the new series includes a More About section at the back that provides information on who, what, where and why, along with customary prayers, songs and recipes, according to the National Geographic press release.

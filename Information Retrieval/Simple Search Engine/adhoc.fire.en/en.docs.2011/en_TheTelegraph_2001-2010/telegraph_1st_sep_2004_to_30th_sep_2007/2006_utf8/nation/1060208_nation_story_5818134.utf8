 BJP sounds poll bugle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The BJP today declared the names of leaders who will be in charge of crucial poll-bound states, including Bengal.

 Sounding the war bugle in the Left-ruled state, BJP chief Rajnath Singh appointed the partys lucky mascot, Arun Jaitley, to oversee elections in Bengal. Rajnath also approved the continuation of Pramod Mahajan in Assam.

 Rajiv Pratap Rudy, a former minister from Bihar, will oversee the elections in Tamil Nadu, while party secretary from Tamil Nadu E. Ganesan will take care of Kerala.

 Former party president M. Venkaiah Naidu has been given the overall charge of all the southern states.

 The crucial appointments, however, are for Bengal and Assam where the party hopes to consolidate its position.

 Sending Jaitley to Calcutta is being seen as a signal that the BJP has renewed efforts to strengthen its base in the state. Jaitley has, in the past, delivered Madhya Pradesh and Bihar to the BJP. Bihar was considered an uphill task. In Madhya Pradesh, it won two-thirds majority for the first time.

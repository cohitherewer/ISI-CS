 More preachers under watch

 - From Northeast...

 Agartala, July 17: The Mumbai blasts have swivelled the spotlight to Tablighis, preachers who largely work within the Muslim community to spread awareness about scriptures and religious rituals.

 Close on the heels of the detention of 11 Mahrashtrians who claimed to be Tablighis near the Bangladesh border, Tripura police have asked eight youths from Gujarat not to leave a mosque before their credentials are established.

 The eight, residents of Godhra and Bharuch, were picked up from a madarsa in Udaipur, over 50 km from Agartala. They are now put up at Chhanbon Mosque in Udaipur.

 Barring one ? a dentist from a medical college in Delhi ? all have passports and have travelled widely. They also possess registration cards attributed to the Hazrat Nizamuddin mosque in Delhi.

 The group aroused the polices suspicions because they did not appear to know the languages ? Kokborok and Bengali ? used in the area.

 The youths were being questioned since last night by police superintendent Arvind Singh, and officials of the special branch (intelligence wing). They are still under watch for understandable reasons, Singh said.

 The leader of the group said they had left Gujarat for Delhi on June 8. After obtaining registration from the Nizamuddin mosque, they left for the Northeast four days later. The eight reached Agartala from Guwahati on June 22.

 Singh said he has contacted his counterparts in Godhra and Bharuch, seeking information about them.

 Preachers had come under the glare after 11 youths from Thane, including an engineer who had worked in the US, were rounded up in a border district in Tripura on Thursday.

 The police are probing whether the youths, who also said they were in Tripura to preach, are linked to the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, counted among the prime suspects in the Mumbai serial strikes. 

 Two officers from Maharashtra polices anti-terrorist squad arrived here this evening to question the group from Thane.

 Muslim leaders said it is not unusual for volunteers of the Tablighi Jamaat to go to places far from their homes to preach the values of Islam.

 Unlike Christian preachers who have a wider public presence, the Tablighis mostly confine their activities within the Muslim community. The Tablighis focus on remote areas, where they feel that some members of the community need to familiarise themselves more with the religious practices.

 Mufti Tayebur Rahaman, the head of the state Jamiat Ulema, said: Tablighis are patriotic and nationalist Muslims performing their religious work. The detention is a result of misunderstanding.

 Rahaman said he has spoken to Ismail Patel, the head of the Darul Fasal mosque in Thane, and has been told that none of the 11 has a criminal record. He said a Jamiat wing has adopted a resolution that if any Tablighi came to a mosque along the border, the police and the BSF would be informed.

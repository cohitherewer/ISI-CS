 Sex test notice

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre and state governments on a PIL seeking strict implementation of the law prohibiting sex determination tests to prevent female foeticide.

 The court has directed them to respond to the allegations in the petition that the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition on Sex Selection) Act was not being properly enforced.

 In its PIL, the voluntary health association of Punjab pointed out that even as the sex ratio was declining at a very fast rate, legal action is abysmally low and the total number of convictions can be counted on the fingers.

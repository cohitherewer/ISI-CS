The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Global amp; local on CPM table

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 8: The CPM politburo will meet tomorrow in Calcutta with three issues on its plate: US relations, airports and Bengal elections.

 On modernisation of airports and Indias growing proximity to the US, the Left will have to draw up a strategy before it meets the UPA leadership next Monday.

 Last Sunday, the Left ? furious with the governments decisions to award the airport contracts to private consortiums and vote against Iran ? turned down the invitation to a co-ordination panel meeting, citing the busy schedule of its leaders.

 The Left leaders later agreed to attend a rescheduled meeting on the ground that they must confront the government with their stand and express their growing disenchantment with the Centres policies.

 In Calcutta, the CPM leadership will work towards a strategy to deal with the government in and outside Parliament, but the bottomline remains clear: the government would not be pulled down.

 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has separately met leaders of other Left parties to discuss the strategy to be adopted at the co-ordination committee. 

 The Left Front will meet on the morning of the UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting before it goes for a discussion with the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi. 

 The strategy the Left is talking about is debate inside Parliament and agitation outside. Given its negligible presence at the all-India level, the Left, however, cannot expect to organise an agitation that will rattle the government. 

 The Left is, therefore, banking on the debate in Parliament to score points and send reassuring messages to its core constituencies.

 The two-day politburo meeting will also try to work out an electoral strategy for Bengal and put the seal of approval on the candidate list the state unit of the CPM has finalised for the upcoming Assembly elections.

 The state CPM secretariat will table a list of candidates at tomorrows politburo meeting, along with details on the nominees background, their constituencies and the reasons for choosing them.

 CPM sources said that the state unit would also list reasons for dropping some sitting MLAs. 

 After the politburos approval, the candidate list would be placed at the partys state committee meeting on February 16. The Left Front candidate list could be announced that day as the CPM is through with seat adjustments with its partners.

 The politburo would also scan the draft Left Front manifesto, which has already been circulated among the junior partners for their suggestions.

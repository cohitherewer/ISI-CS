 Complaint over KBC

 New Delhi, June 18 (PTI): The blockbuster TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati has come under the scanner after a participant complained of systematic rigging in the selection process by Bharti Cellular, also known as Airtel.

 Airtel is responsible for all such illegal activities and defrauding people at large, particularly those with Airtel connections, giving false statements in advertisements which the mobile holder believed in good faith and acted accordingly, said the participant who dragged it to telecom tribunal TDSAT.

 TDSAT has issued notices to Airtel, which selected participants over the phone. Airtel said it would not comment since the matter is sub judice.

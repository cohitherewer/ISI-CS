 Teachers prey on schoolgirls

 - Parents of pregnant student file complaint, 17 others follow suit 

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Durjanpur (Jind)/Chandigarh, Feb. 9: School teachers Ram Kumar Punia and Rameshwar, accused of raping students over the past eight months, were arrested late in the evening today.

 The teachers, who preyed on Class IX and Class X girls at the Durjanpur senior secondary school, had gone missing after the exploitation came to light. 

 The parents of one of the victims, who had become pregnant, had complained to the local panchayat. Once we were informed that she had become pregnant by the two teachers we called a panchayat on the school premises on Monday to discuss the matter. But the news was leaked to the teachers who fled the school, said sarpanch Mewa Singh.

 Even principal Chotu Ram, whom we respected a lot, is responsible for what was going on in the name of teaching. How can teachers rape and molest schoolgirls who are of the same age as their own daughters?

 After the first shock, parents of 17 girls have now come forward with complaints against both Punia, who taught mathematics, and Rameshwar, a physical training instructor. Both are close to 40.

 Today, the state government suspended seven teachers, including the principal. Orders have been passed to replace the entire staff.

 We are aghast, said K.K. Khandelwal, the director-general of school education. The education department will spare nobody.

 District officials in Durjanpur, which lies in the middle of the Jat heartland in Haryana and is close to the border with Hisar district, said it is not the first time that a girl from the school had got pregnant. 

 Earlier, there were rumours that two girls from poor families had become pregnant. The teachers had paid the parents a substantial amount of money to keep quiet and send the girls to Jind for abortions. We are now being told by the students themselves what the teachers were up to, said an official.

 Police sources said both teachers had been arrested from near the village. Jind deputy commissioner M.P. Bansal confirmed the arrest.

 We cannot take them to the village for investigations at the moment as we want the anger of the villagers to die down. Both teachers are being questioned. They are pleading they will reveal all if they are kept away from the village, a district police officer said.

 The villagers want the two to be produced before them, and fast. Or we will burn everything down, said Satbir, a furious villager. All teachers in the school will have to stand in front of us and answer why they kept quiet when they knew what was happening. The principal, too, we now know, had received complaints but ignored them.

 The district authorities are now investigating the role of the teachers in flesh trade. We are looking at the possibility of some of the girls from the school being pushed into prostitution, said a police officer.

 It is ironic, but the rape and molestation of the schoolgirls would have continued unnoticed had the daughter of an influential villager not become pregnant. Otherwise, it would be difficult to gauge how many girls suffered the same fate under the two teachers who were allowed to remain in the same school for years.

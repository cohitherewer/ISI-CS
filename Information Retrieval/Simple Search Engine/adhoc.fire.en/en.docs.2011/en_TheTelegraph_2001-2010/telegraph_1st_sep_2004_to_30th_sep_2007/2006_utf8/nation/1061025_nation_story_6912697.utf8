 New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Union Public Service Commission could be punished for trying to avoid revealing exam details to candidates.

 The Central Information Commission the watchdog for the Right to Information Act says the UPSC repeatedly flouted its orders to provide the information.

 Information commissioners said that if the UPSC failed to reply satisfactorily to candidates appeals, a fine might be imposed.

 The UPSC has been receiving raps from the information commission since early September after it refused to follow an order to reveal details a candidate had sought. They are dilly-dallying. Their lawyers keep throwing technical reasons as excuses, a commissioner said.

 At a hearing yesterday, the commission asked this student and others who had filed similar appeals since then to file fresh appeals in the next couple of days. The UPSC will have five days to reply, the commissioner said.

 The first appeal asks for details like the cut-off marks for general and reserved categories, the number of candidates who appeared, the relative importance given to the interview and the written exam in the final selection, and the identities of the evaluators.

 The UPSC initially cited evaluators safety to stall the matter, but once the information commission dismissed this argument, it said disclosure of sensitive details would set a bad precedent and could affect the exam process.

 After lengthy debates between the UPSCs lawyers and the information commission, this ground, too, was considered insufficient.

 The UPSC, which conducts more examinations than any other body in India, is now citing the large number of candidates for its exams. The argument is that it would be next to impossible for it to deal with complaints about disclosure of the information sought.

 Under the Right to Information Act, the information commission can issue a show-cause notice to the UPSC if it finds the response to the students fresh appeal unsatisfactory. 

 If the reply to the notice is not convincing enough, the UPSC can be fined up to Rs 25,000. The information commission is hoping it doesnt come to that. What should prove a bigger deterrent, we hope, is the image of a non-transparent body that will stick to it if it faces a penalty, the commissioner said.

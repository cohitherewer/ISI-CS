 BJP brave face: Alls well

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: Prodded by the Sangh, the BJP today played down the controversy over L.K. Advanis renewed claim as the partys official candidate for Prime Minister in the next general elections.

 The widespread feeling within the RSS is that the BJP has, with great difficulty, been able to overcome bickering within the party and assume the role of a serious Opposition party. It now wants the party to focus on the crucial elections coming up in five states and regroup strongly in the national executive and council meetings scheduled for later this month.

 The party has been able to put its resources together and raise issues such as the UPAs minority-appeasement and internal security. The last thing we need right now is yet another controversy. We have to play down anything that has the potential to snowball into something major in the coming months, a Sangh source said.

 Accordingly, all senior party leaders rushed to blame the controversy on the news channel that aired Advanis interview.

 While BJP president Rajnath Singh said it was a malicious attempt to cause a rift in the party, former president M. Venkaiah Naidu said it is deplorable that the media should indulge in such mischief. 

 Advani also spoke to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee over the phone. Vajpayeeji told Advaniji it was a good interview, said a senior leader.

 He was said to have been upset yesterday when reports started circulating that Advani had said he did not expect Vajpayee to propose his name for the post. Rajnath, who too was reported to be unhappy, met Vajpayee late in the evening to discuss the political fallout of the interview.

 Consultations with senior RSS pointman Madan Das Devi followed, and the consensus that evolved by the time the parliamentary party met this morning was to play down the episode.

 The party has no view on this matter, said BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra. What Advaniji said was right. So was what Rajnathji said. Atalji too. 

 Coming out of the parliamentary party meeting this morning, Advani told the waiting reporters: There was no problem in the interview. The confusion had been created by the press release (issued by the channel a day before). I hope everything is clear now.

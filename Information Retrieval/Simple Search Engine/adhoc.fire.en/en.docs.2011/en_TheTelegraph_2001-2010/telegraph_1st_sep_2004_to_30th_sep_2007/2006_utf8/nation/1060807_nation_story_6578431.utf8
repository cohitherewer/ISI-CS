 Marriage without sex is cruelty: HC

 Jodhpur (PTI): Rajasthan High Court has observed that non-consummation of marriage amounts to cruelty and it was the principal obligation of the husband to satisfy the biological urge of his wife.

 Passing a decree of dissolution of marriage, the Jodhpur division bench of the high court said married life without cohabitation would be a curse to the wife.

 Hearing an appeal against the order of a family court, Justices Rajesh Balia and R.P. Vyas held that sex was the foundation of marriage and harmonious sexual activity in marriage had an extremely favourable influence on a womans mind and body.

 Appellant Kusum had married Omprakash in 1996 and had filed an application for the dissolution of marriage two years later. She sought the dissolution on the ground of cruelty due to non-consummation of her marriage by her husband. The court granted it.

 Air hostess was strangulated

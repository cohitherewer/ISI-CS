 Sarangi breaks silence, before hearing

 Pramod Mahajan: Temper trouble? 

 Mumbai, June 7: After a months stoic silence, Praveen Mahajans wife Sarangi has started speaking up, portraying her husband as a doting father to their children, describing the late Pramod Mahajan as a father figure and ruling out any motive other than the temperamental behaviour that runs in the family.

 Sarangis comments ? first to two newspapers and then to a news agency ? became public a day before a local magistrate is scheduled to hear a plea by Praveens lawyer for a psychological check-up on his client.

 She also sought to distance herself from Praveens lawyer Nandkumar Rajurkar, who had declared his client mentally unstable a few hours after the April 22 shooting.

 Rajurkar said Sarangi had not consulted him and she had spoken out of turn, which could affect his strategy of demanding psychological tests on Praveen. If they (the family) are going to speak like this, why should I wrack my brains? Rajurkar asked.

 The lawyer had thrice before approached the Mazgaon court magistrate demanding psychological tests on Praveen, emphasising that his clients mental state when he pumped bullets into his elder brother was key to the trial. On Thursday, the magistrate will hear the application for the fourth time.

 I cant talk about my future legal strategy. I will meet Praveen in jail tomorrow and consult him on whether we should petition the high court if my prayer is rejected again, Rajurkar said.

 Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy has maintained that Praveen was mentally stable and replied to questions during interrogation coherently.

 Lawyers as well as police officials dealing with the investigation said Sarangis comments would have no bearing on the prosecutions case and did not possess any legal validity. It will not have any impact on the case. Praveen has never claimed he is mentally unstable. At best, it will probably be a setback to his lawyers legal strategy of helping his client using insanity as defence, a lawyer said.

 Her statement will not have any impact on the prosecutions case unless she makes these comments before the court. We are all set to file a chargesheet against Praveen within one and a half weeks, a police officer said.

 Sarangi said Pramod was a father figure who spotted her at a college event in Nagpur and sought her hand for Praveen.

 Sarangi said she met Praveen at the Arthur Road jail on May 29. Praveen told her he had called on Pramod at his residence to sort out differences, but fired at him in a sudden fit of anger after being ignored by the brother, she said.

 All three Mahajan brothers ? Pramod, Praveen and Prakash ? were headstrong, and can get angry within no time, and react very harshly, PTI quoted Sarangi as saying in a telephone interview.

 She added that her husband disliked Pramod Mahajans secretary Bibek Moitras condescending behaviour, and resented being asked to consult him for an appointment with his brother. Bibek died recently from drug overdose after a late-night party that also sent Pramod Mahajans son, Rahul, to hospital and then to jail.

 According to Sarangi, Praveen blamed Bibek for Rahuls lifestyle and advised his children not to go the same way when they went to meet their father in his cell.

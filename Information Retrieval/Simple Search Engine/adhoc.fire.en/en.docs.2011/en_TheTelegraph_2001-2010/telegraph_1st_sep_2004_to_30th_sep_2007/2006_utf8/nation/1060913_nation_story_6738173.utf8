 Van trail to scooter key and suspects

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The chance recovery of a Maruti van abandoned by some of the bombers led investigators to the gates of the Memons Al-Husaini building in Mahim.

 It helped us crack the case, recalls M.N. Singh, the then joint commissioner of police.

 Hours after the serial blasts, the police spotted the van (MFC-1972) in the Worli area and found AK-56 rifles as well as hand grenades inside the car. 

 The car was owned by one Raheen Memon, wife of a chartered accountant Yakub Memon, who lived in Al-Husaini building on the Veer Savarkar Marg of the Mahim area. Would you believe it, the house is bang opposite the local police station? Singh said.

 When the apartment was searched, the police said they stumbled on a cocktail of grenades and empty cartons that supposedly contained RDX.

 But a seemingly innocuous find the ignition key of a scooter helped the police establish a direct link between the Memons and the serial blasts. The key fitted one of the three scooters that had been found with unexploded bombs at Dadar in central Mumbai. 

 The grenades were marked ARGES an inscription that was found on shrapnel among the blast debris. A large number of such grenades was later picked up from various sites during the investigations. ARGES was the registered trademark of an Austrian firm, Singh said.

 It was clear to the investigating officers that an effort had been made to obliterate the inscriptions on some cartons that were recovered from the apartment, added A.S. Samra, the then police commissioner. Both Samra and Singh have retired since then.

 But a close examination of the cartons revealed Pakistan markings. Many had Wah Novel Industries inscribed on them. 

 Another breakthrough came when Wah Novel Industries was tracked down by the CBI. The agency claimed that Wah is a Pakistan government-controlled explosives manufacturer based in Islamabads Cantonment area.

 The Memons owned two apartments, Flat No. 25 and Flat No. 22, in the building. Both the sea-facing flats have been sealed after the 1993 blasts.

 Yakub had a chartered accountancy firm, Teejarath International, in neighbouring Bandra. The office was burnt down during the January 1993 riots in Mumbai one of the catalysts that could have pushed Yakub into the conspiracy. The property has now been attached by the CBI.

 After some of the Memons returned to India and were arrested, all except Yakub were granted bail. 

 Out of jail, the Memons have led an uneventful life, constantly moving from one house to another. Over the last 10 years, they have lived in Kurla in north Mumbai and Jogeshwari in the northwest, before shifting to their current home in Dongri in south Mumbai.

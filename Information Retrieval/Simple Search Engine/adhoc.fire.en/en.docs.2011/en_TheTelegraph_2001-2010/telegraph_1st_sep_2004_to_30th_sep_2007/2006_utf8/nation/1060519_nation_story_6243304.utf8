 How Sonia got book

 Sonia Gandhi got her copy of The Da Vinci Code as a gift, from Sitaram Yechury. The CPM leader had read the Dan Brown thriller while campaigning for the 2004 elections and enjoyed it.

 The Congress won the election and the CPM teamed up with it, helping it come to power. During the parties honeymoon, Yechury decided to gift a copy of the book to Sonia. 

 I was a little wary because I wondered if she was a practising Christian and whether her religious sensibility would be offended in that case, he said.

 But the Congress president told him she was not a practising Christian and there was no question of getting offended. Subsequently I learnt she had thoroughly enjoyed the book, Yechury said.

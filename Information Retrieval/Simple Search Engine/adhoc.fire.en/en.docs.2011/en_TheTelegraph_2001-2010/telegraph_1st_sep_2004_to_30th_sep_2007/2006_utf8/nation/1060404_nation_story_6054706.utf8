The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sound and fury, but no complaint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Govinda

 Mumbai, April 3: Some say he could be crying wolf. Others feel it is a serious matter. And his brother says the media got it all wrong.

 But the man at the centre of all the hoopla ? Govinda ? has stayed put.

 Nearly a day after his family claimed he received threats from the underworld, the actor-turned-MP has yet to file a police complaint.

 A Mumbai police team, however, visited the actors Juhu home this morning.

 He has shared some phone numbers from where he has got the calls and we will move only when he comes to us with a complaint, said western zone deputy commissioner Amitabh Gupta.

 But there are others who feel a case should be filed.

 The veracity of his claims needs to be checked, whether he lodges a complaint or not. It needs to be checked whether he is crying wolf because his family has overnight changed its statements about the possible people behind the calls, said a crime branch official.

 The actors brother, Kirti Ahuja, who told the media yesterday Govinda had received death threats from Chhota Shakeel from Dubai, sang a different tune today.

 Let me put this straight, Ahuja said. My brother has not received any call from underworld dons Dawood Ibrahim or Chhota Shakeel or anyone else from Dubai or Karachi.

 Govinda, he added, has got a problem with local criminal elements. He has also got threats that in case he goes to foreign countries, he might face serious problems. He might face serious problems about his family also.

 Asked why he had claimed that Govinda got calls from Shakeel asking him to act in a particular movie, Ahuja said the media had got him wrong.

 Speculation in these matters is not correct. We have already informed the Union home ministry and the Congress high command. We are confident that appropriate steps would be taken for the safety of Govinda and his family.

 A close friend of the Ahuja family said Govinda would lodge a complaint once he got clearance from Sonia Gandhi.

 A senior leader in the state Congress, however, said it was just a ploy to draw attention. His career ? in politics or in cinema ? is going nowhere. As far as I know, it is just a ploy to attract attention and make sure there is a revival of interest in his flagging film career.

 A family friend of Govinda dismissed the allegation. On the contrary, he said, we believe the threat calls are being made to sabotage the resurgence of his career.

 The actor has recently signed six films with directors Nikhil Advani, David Dhawan, Priyadarshan and Pahlaj Nihalani.

 Sources said Govinda is worried about his son Yashovardhan, 12, a Class VII student of Jamnabai Narsee School in Juhu. The star had reportedly called a meeting of family members and friends on March 31. 

 He did not want any publicity as he was scared the whole issue would discourage producers and directors from approaching him, said a source.

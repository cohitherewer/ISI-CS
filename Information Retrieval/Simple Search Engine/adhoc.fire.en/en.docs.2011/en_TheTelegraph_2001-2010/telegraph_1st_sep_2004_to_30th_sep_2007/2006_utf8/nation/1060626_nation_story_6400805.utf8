 New Delhi, June 25: The 

 BJP has told the Standing Committee on Home Affairs that 

 the Communal Violence (Prevention, Control and Rehabilitation 

 of Victims) Bill, 2005, is totally unacceptable 

 as it threatens to disrupt the federal structure of the 

 country.

 The committee is expected to submit 

 its confidential report on the bill to Parliament on the 

 last day of the first week of the monsoon session.

 The bill was introduced in the 

 Rajya Sabha in December and subsequently referred to the 

 standing committee, which comprises 35 MPs. Although its 

 proceedings are kept under wraps, the committee is learnt 

 to be consulting a panel of four experts ? Fali Nariman, 

 Jaspal Singh, Zoya Hasan and M.P. Singh ? on the bill.

 The committee has reportedly sought 

 recommendations from all political parties, and the BJP 

 is believed to have made the following objections:

 Chapter XI empowers the Centre to deal with communal 

 violence in a state and take over its law and order mechanism 

 if it suspects that the state does not intend to act. 

 The BJP says this provision would upset the federal structure 

 as there are no safeguards against the misuse of the special 

 powers

 The composition of the relief committees is not balanced 

 ? the majority community has not been given 

 any representation

 The BJP is also opposed to the clause pertaining to 

 disqualification of a legislator

 Provisions of Chapter XI 

 completely erode the federal structure of the state. Law 

 and order is a state subject. How can the Centre have arbitrary 

 powers to declare an area communally sensitive and send 

 in paramilitary forces? asked a senior BJP leader.

 The partys arguments, however, 

 are in contrast to that of human rights organisations and 

 womens groups. 

 In their public report, Colin 

 Gonsalvez of the Human Rights Law Network and anti-communal 

 group Anhad have attacked the bill on the ground that all 

 the core sections regarding prevention, containment and 

 punishment of communal offences only come into effect if 

 the state government concerned issues a notification.

 A state government may issue 

 a notification bringing the statute into force in the state 

 and yet render it sterile by not issuing further notifications 

 declaring certain areas to be communally disturbed, 

 Gonsalvez said in his report.

 The prospect of the infamous 

 Gujarat experiment of a state-sponsored terrorising of minority 

 citizens is still a real enough threat. It is for this reason 

 that the bill was so eagerly awaited. But what this law 

 sets out to do is not to protect innocent citizens from 

 such acts of their elected rulers. Instead, it sets out 

 perversely to vest those same state administrations with 

 even more powers.

 Notices on MP sack petitions

 SINGH GYANANT KUMAR

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Supreme Court today issued notices to all parties concerned on the Centres petition seeking transfer of all cases challenging the expulsion of 11 MPs.

 Ten of them had moved Delhi High Court after they were shown the door for accepting money to raise questions in the House and the 11th MPs plea is pending before the apex court.

 A bench of Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice C.K. Thakker asked the respondents ? the expelled MPs, the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats and the Election Commission ? to file replies by February 13.

 The notices were issued after attorney-general Milon K. Banerji argued that the cases should be transferred to the apex court as the question of law was almost the same as that in the plea by the MP who had approached the Supreme Court.

 When he pointed out that the high court had fixed the matter for hearing on February 16, the bench directed that the responses be filed three days before that.

 Earlier, the attorney-general had submitted that the question of law related to the power of the two Houses to expel its members.

 A news channel had filmed 10 Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha member accepting money for raising questions. After the broadcast of the footage on December 12 last year, an inquiry was conducted in both Houses and the MPs were found guilty.

 Following a motion on December 23, the Houses accepted the recommendations of the Lok Sabha probe panel and the Rajya Sabha ethics committee and expelled the MPs.

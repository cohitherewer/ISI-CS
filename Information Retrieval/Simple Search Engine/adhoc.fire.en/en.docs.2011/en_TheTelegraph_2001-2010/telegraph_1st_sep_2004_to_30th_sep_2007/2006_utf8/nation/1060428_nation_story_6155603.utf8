 Pramod wife, son quizzed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 27: Five days after his youngest brother shot him thrice in the abdomen, Mumbai police finally began recording the statements of Pramod Mahajans family in connection with the early-morning attack.

 Police sources said a Worli police team visited P.D. Hinduja Hospital this evening and recorded detailed statements of the BJP leaders wife Rekha, brother-in-law Gopinath Munde and son Rahul.

 The three have been at the hospital since Saturday, when Praveen Mahajan shot the 56-year-old former Union minister at his 15th-floor flat in Worli. Pramod was rushed to the Hinduja hospital with severe injuries, was operated on twice and is still critical.

 Although Praveen surrendered after the shooting, Pramods wife, a key witness, his brother-in-law, who rushed him to hospital, and son were not available for police investigations. The sleuths decided to wait a few days and allow the family to recover from the initial shock. Sources said the recording of statements is likely to continue till late tonight.

 Worli police have already arrested Praveen on three charges, including attempt to murder. The 45-year-old has told his interrogators that he attacked Pramod out of frustration over having to lead an obscure life despite being the brother of an influential politician and alleged that his brother treated him and his family like dirt.

 The police have also recorded the statements of Praveens Thane-based family, including his wife Sarangi and two college-going children. Sarangi said her husband had been in a disturbed frame of mind but she was not aware of his motives when he left their Thane flat on Saturday morning.

 The team has also recorded the statement of a domestic help who was in the Worli flat when the BJP leader was attacked. But he said he was not aware of what transpired between the brothers.

 The police claim Praveens assault was premeditated and are investigating his financial dealings and cellphone records. They have recorded the statements of four businessmen with whom Praveen had dealings in the past to find out if his financial condition had prompted the attack.

 At the hospital, doctors in their morning bulletin described Pramods condition as critical but stable, and mentioned a very gradual reduction in medicine to maintain his blood pressure. This evening, they said there has been a significant reduction in medicine to keep his blood pressure stable.

 But the BJP leader continues to be on ventilator and renal replacement therapy because of poor kidney functions, they added.

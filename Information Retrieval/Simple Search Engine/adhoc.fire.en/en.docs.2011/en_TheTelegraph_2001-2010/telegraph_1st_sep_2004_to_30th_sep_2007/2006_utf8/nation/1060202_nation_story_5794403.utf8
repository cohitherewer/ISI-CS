 SC axe on Clinton cop

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Supreme Court has ordered dismissal of a police constable who stole a closed-circuit TV lens installed in an MNC office in Hyderabad during the visit of Bill Clinton in March 2000.

 The duty assigned to him was a bandobast during the visit of then President Bill Clinton, who ran the risk of the highest grade. His conduct could have led to a serious security lapse resulting in fatal consequences, the court said.

 The judgment set aside an Andhra Pradesh High Court order reinstating Mohd Nasrulla Khan, who was dismissed after a departmental inquiry.

 The apex court said the dismissal was necessary to instil the confidence of the public in the Establishment. 

 Khan had stolen the lens and hidden it in a toilet. But an electrician had seen him committing the crime on the closed-circuit TV and informed the authorities.

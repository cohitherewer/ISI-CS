 Threats take Govinda to Sonia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 2: Govindas family has claimed that the actor and Congress MP has been receiving threatening calls, but instead of approaching police, he has informed party president Sonia Gandhi. 

 Govinda has been receiving threats... to his family members. We have informed the Union home ministry and Congress party high command. We are confident the party high command is taking appropriate steps for the safety of Govinda and family, his brother Kirti Kumar said. 

 Asked if the threat had come from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, he said: Let the investigating agencies do their work. Please do not give rise to speculation as this is a very serious matter.

 But Mumbai police were in the dark. We have not received any complaint from Govinda or his family so far. I cannot comment unless I receive a complaint, deputy commissioner of police, zone VII, Amitabh Gupta, said.

 Kirti said Govindas private security cover has been increased, but refused to give details of the calls.

 It is believed that the threats could be related to the fact that Govinda has been trying to resurrect his sinking film career in 2006. Industry sources said he has signed at least four big films with directors like Priyadarshan, Nikhil Advani and close friend David Dhawan. Priyadarshans Bhagam Bhag and Dhawans Partner are on the floor.

 After a string of flops, Govinda turned to politics and defeated BJP heavyweight Ram Naik in a surprise win in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

 Following a car accident in which his wife and children were injured, Govinda decided to return to films for financial reasons. 

 Govinda had received similar threats in 2000-2001. He was among the many Bollywood artistes who often travelled to Dubai for stage shows in the early 90s when Dawood was yet to move base to Karachi. 

 Some TV channels had aired footage of Govinda shaking hands with Dawood, after which Naik demanded his resignation. Govinda denied any links with the underworld and said he has been its victim. 

 Congress spokesman Rajiv Shukla said he had spoken to Govinda who did not identify who threatened him. He has told the Prime Minister, Sonia and the chief minister, Shukla said, adds PTI.

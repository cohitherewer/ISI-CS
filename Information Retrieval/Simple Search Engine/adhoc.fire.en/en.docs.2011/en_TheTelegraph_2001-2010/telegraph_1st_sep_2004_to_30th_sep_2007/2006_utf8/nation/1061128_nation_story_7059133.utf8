 Blocked Lanka highway on PM talks table

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Mahinda Rajapakse

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: When Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse meets Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow, they may end up discussing a highway. 

 The A-9 highway, providing the main access from the south to the Jaffna peninsula, has become the bone of contention between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 

 As the ethnic conflict rages on in Sri Lanka, the government has closed the highway. There is a massive humanitarian crisis building up with food supplies running out in the Tamil areas of north and east Lanka. The A-9 highway has been blocked and relief ships to Jaffna are not being allowed to ply by the LTTE. Airlifting of food has its limitations, given the size of the suffering population. 

 Besides the humanitarian crisis, the leaders are also expected to discuss the proposal for joint patrolling of the Palk Straits.

 The idea is not new. Lanka has been seeking greater cooperation from India to patrol its maritime boundary not only to check arms and drug smuggling and provide security to fishermen but also to check activities of the Sea Tigers.

 The details of the Lankan proposal for joint patrolling are not known. What we understand is that they will patrol on their side and we will patrol our coast. If there is anything more than that, we will have to see the proposal, said a source monitoring developments in Lanka.

 Rajapakse would also discuss Indias offer of 7,000 tonnes of food items to Sri Lankas Tamil-dominated north-east. The LTTE wants food supplies to the beleaguered north sent through the A-9. 

 The peace talks with the LTTE in Geneva last month collapsed over the A-9 issue. The LTTE has alleged that Colombos efforts at airlifting supplies instead of opening A-9 was akin to trying to feed the population in the north as it would prisoners of war.

 The Rajapakse government has also been under pressure from international relief agencies to reopen the highway for relief supplies. It has indicated that it may consider it as a one-off gesture.

 The LTTE itself has refused to allow ships and boats from India carrying relief supplies to sail from Nagapattinam to Kankesanturai port in Lankas north. It has also declined Colombos offer of ships carrying supplies from the Pooneryn post in the northwest of the island to Jaffna.

 The focus on reopening the A-9 highway does not reflect merely a humanitarian concern. The trucks plying on this highway are a major source of extortion for the LTTE. In addition, the highway gives the LTTE access to Jaffna for recruitment, a source in the government said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Telegraph launches online shopping

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 1: From television to tattoo ? the stick-on variety, that is ? almost anything is available on the online shopping portal The Telegraph is launching today.

 There are the mall rats and there are those that feel happier with a mouse under their palm. 

 No prizes for guessing who www.thetelegraphstore.com is for.

 Click on the site and floor after floor of the shopping mall will unfold on the computer screen under heads such as family corner, womans world, mans world, kids zone, kitchen and gizmo world. 

 On display are products from reputed brands at prices that are competitive ? find out for yourself how competitive.

 Each section opens up the range of products on offer along with prices. For instance, gizmo world is the window to iPods, video cameras and home theatres.

 Mans and womans worlds are self-explanatory, so is kids zone but theres no harm pointing out bey-blades are up there at a bargain price.

 Readers of The Telegraph, using the portal to shop, will have an advantage. Advertisements with special codes will appear regularly in the newspaper. With the help of the code, readers can get access to exclusive deals on popular brands at great rates in a feature of the portal called the price surprise.

 Once readers click on the link, they are directed to a page where they can pick up products at low prices. These prices will be valid for a limited period.

 Payment can be made with credit and debit cards, by cheque and demand drafts. On a large number of products, buyers even have the option of paying in three monthly instalments without any interest being charged.

 Sify Mall, of Satyam, is looking after the logistics. 

 Delivery will be usually made in 5-7 working days. The buyer can track his order status ? stage of processing and delivery ? by simply punching in the date of placing it. They can also provide instructions like the preferred time of delivery and location or if a message is to be given with a gift, for example. 

 The offer is available all over eastern India.

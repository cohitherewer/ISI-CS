 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Planning Commission has recommended a national evaluation system to improve low learning standards in primary schools.

 A set of national testing standards will be created and a chain of institutions established to test and evaluate the children according to these norms, the commission suggests as a remedial measure in its final approach paper to the 11th five-year plan.

 The paper points out that the flaws in the primary education system need to be tackled on a priority basis. It talks of a strategy of inclusiveness, which focuses on social sectors like health, education and other public facilities.

 The National Council of Educational Research and Training is working out the details of the testing system that will put in place uniform norms of evaluation. At present, there are no norms.

 One of the main challenges, the commission says, is to ensure a good quality of instruction. A recent study has found that 38 per cent of children who have completed four years of education cannot read a small paragraph with short sentences meant to be read by a student of Class II.

 According to experts, the level of education can go up not just by ensuring that teachers regularly attend classes but that they also improve their quality of teaching.

 Several states have begun efforts to raise basic skills in a campaign mode. Their experiences need to be evaluated, the commission suggests.

 The paper also underlines the need for toning up the primary education system both in terms of infrastructure and teachers.

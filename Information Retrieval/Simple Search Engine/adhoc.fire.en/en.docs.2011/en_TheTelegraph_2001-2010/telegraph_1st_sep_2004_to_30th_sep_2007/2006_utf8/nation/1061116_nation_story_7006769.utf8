 Sacrifice scent in murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 West Midnapore, Nov. 15: An unidentified man was found dead with a gaping neck wound near an abandoned Kali temple, triggering suspicion that it could be a case of human sacrifice.

 Residents of Ramjibanpur in West Midnapore, about 150 km from Calcutta, said there were sindoor (vermilion) marks on the mans forehead and the only piece of cloth he had on him was a new gamchha.

 Police, however, refused to confirm whether it was a case of human sacrifice and said the vermilion on the forehead of the man, who appeared to be in his mid-thirties, and the gamchha could be a ploy by the murderers to mislead the probe.

 We have found out that the black pair of trousers found beside the body had the tag of the tailor, which shows it was stitched in the Champadanga area of Hooghly. Champadanga is a hub of potato cultivation and we are trying to find out whether the murder was the fallout of a business rivalry, a police official said.

 Whatever people might think, we think it is a case of plain and simple murder. If it was a case of human sacrifice, there would have been a pool of blood, district superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said.

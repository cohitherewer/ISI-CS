 Plea for death to end 12-yr illness 

 Jaipur (PTI): Six members of a family suffering from a mysterious disease for the last 12 years say they have sought permission from the President for euthanasia.

 Satish Kumar, one of the family members, said: 

 Pata nahin kya bimari hai, khade khade gir jaate 

 hain (We dont know what disease is this. We cannot 

 stand on our feet without support).

 Residing in Shypur village, 20 km from here, the family that once flourished by selling fruits has now become destitute because of heavy medical expenses. 

 The members have been on a fast since October 2 to highlight their financial plight. 

 They have petitioned President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to allow them to commit euthanasia, Kumar said.

 The family members said they have consulted almost all well-known orthopaedics, including Jaipur-foot inventor Dr P.K. Sethi. But none could diagnose their disease.

 The family declined help from NGOs, saying they wanted financial help to re-establish themselves.

 ID chip for Mumbai jumbos

 Mumbai (Reuters): Elephants in Mumbai 

 are to be microchipped to make sure that unlicensed pachyderms 

 dont give authorities a headache.

 quot;A microchip is like a voter identity card: 

 if an elephant doesnt have one, well know its 

 in the city illegally, said Sarfaraz Khan, deputy 

 conservator of forests for Thane district and the driving 

 force behind the initiative. 

 Khan said there were just five licensed elephants in the city, but with owners not reporting their animals to avoid paying fees, animal activists estimate there could be 15 in Mumbai. 

 IAF sergeant 

 Jodhpur (PTI): A dismissed air force 

 sergeant, found guilty of killing his wife and two children 

 two years ago, has been sentenced to death.

 The fast-track court ordered Anil Vasudeo to be hanged and referred the case to Rajasthan High Court to confirm the sentence.

 ISI arrests

 New Delhi (PTI): Two persons believed 

 to be ISI agents have been arrested in the capital with 

 sensitive defence documents on them. Mohd Muzaffar Khan 

 and Ali Rehman Jalal were arrested on Thursday. They were 

 staying in Delhi for the past nine months.

 Blasts verdict

 Mumbai: The special anti-terror court 

 has convicted three accused in the 1993 serial blasts case. 

 Shaikh Ali Shaikh Umar, Mohammad Shahid Nizamuddin Qureshi 

 and Parvez Mohammed Parvez Zulfikar Qureshi were convicted 

 for landing arms and explosives.

About 2,000 species of cactii from various arid 

 zones of the world will be on display at a two-day show 

 in Panchkula at the National Cactus and Succulent Garden 

 and Research Centre.

 Kidnapping as usual in Bihar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Jan. 17: The most organised industry in Bihar struck early today, hours before another of its victims returned home, safe but jittery.

 Nirmalendu Prakash Diwakar (15) was on his way to school when a gang of four to five criminals abducted him around eight this morning. 

 As the city tried to come to terms with the daring act, 20-year-old Prashant Jain returned home in the afternoon, 12 days after he was abducted from Buddha Marg here.

 Nirmalendu, a resident of Harnichak, was travelling in a Maruti van when the criminals intercepted the car. They first smashed the windscreen before overpowering the driver and took the teenager away in another vehicle. 

 Nirmalendu, a student of Don Bosco, is the son of Om Prakash Diwakar, an accused in the fodder scam. Diwakar, a veterinary doctor and former deputy director of the animal husbandry department, is also a distant relative of former Rashtriya Janata Dal minister Shyam Rajak.

 At a junction about half a mile from the house, the criminals intercepted our car. They broke the windscreen and pulled me out before leaving with the boy, the driver recalled.

 Police swung into action immediately after the family informed them of the abduction. The boys family said they have not received any demands for ransom.

 Prashant Jain was reportedly set free at Mahatma Gandhi Setu outside Patna ? where the police claimed to have found him ? this morning. We have a piece of good news for you. Prashant has been found safe, the chief minister later told the media. 

 After that, the police and government were silent on the the details of his return. 

 The young trader was abducted on the night of January 5.

 while he was returning from his fathers garment shop. 

 Prashant was initially kept at the IPS officers mess where his mother Neera was seen feeding him slices of bread and warm milk. 

 Please dont disturb him... He is in a state of shock, Bihar director-general of police Ashish Ranjan Sinha told reporters. The youth was later shifted to his residence.

 Prashants brother Nishant said he was assaulted by the kidnappers and had suffered a head injury.

 We will be able to give you the details only after his statement before the court tomorrow, said Krishnan.

 Under pressure from the Opposition over the rising crime graph, Nitish Kumar ?who vowed to smash Bihars kidnap industry ? said: Its not only the families of Prashant Jain or Nirmalendu... who are in distress. I personally feel pain. 

 Nitish has called a meeting of senior police officers tomorrow to discuss the measures that would be adopted to check crime.

 As expected, the RJD lashed out at the government. It is just not bothered about the unprecedented rise in crime, alleged Rajak.

 Ill never feel safe again

 ANANYA SENGUPTA

 Abhishekh

 Malegaon, Sept. 10: 

 Thirty-seven-year-old Abhishekh Abdul Hamid was saved from 

 Fridays blasts by a whisker.

 A regular at Bada Kabrastan, Hamid 

 shudders at the very thought of recalling the horrifying 

 images, which he says will remain embedded in his mind forever.

 Bada Kabrastan is a place where our forefathers have been resting for years. We go to the mazhar to pray for their souls.

 As usual, I had gone there on Friday and I did not notice anything awry. The place was bustling with people and it was nice to see so many congregating on a special day as this.

 Children had come in large numbers and they were laughing and joking among themselves before the prayers started.

 The prayers began a little late and the children were impatient. When the namaz concluded, people headed towards the mazhar, but the children started to run out. It was then that I heard a loud explosion.

 There was blood everywhere. The bodies of children, clothes and shoes lay scattered. The walls were splattered with blood and I noticed that some cycles parked nearby had been blown up.

 People were running out, not knowing where to go. Some of them fell down and many got hurt that way. 

 The sight was painful what was till a few minutes ago a happy crowd was now a bloodied heap of burnt flesh. 

 The injured lay moaning on the ground as others came to help and managed to take them to hospital in handcarts. I saw crying men carrying their children to safety.

 There was no one to help these people no policemen were in sight. The injured were in so much pain. I can never forget the sight it comes back in flashes when I try to sleep. Allah will never forgive those who did this. 

 So many innocent people were killed and injured on this holy day. There is no justice in this world.

 I will never feel safe again, thinking that death is waiting for me at some corner of the street.

 But I will come back to the Kabrastan to pray this time I will pray for the departed souls that went to Allahs abode on Friday. I am afraid, but life has to go on.

 Army indicts lady officer

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: A court of inquiry by the army has indicted one of its lady officers and has assigned her to a unit in the Western Command for further proceedings. 

 The officer of the rank of major will now face a court martial or administrative action after her superiors examine the evidence against her.

 The case of Major Deepa (name changed), who has been attached to the Western Command unit, is the second known instance of a lady officer facing a military trial. Only this week Anjali Gupta, the officer who was court-martialled by the Indian Air Force in Bangalore, petitioned the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S.P. Tyagi.

 The army ? like the navy and the air force ? flatly refuses to make a gender-divide of cases. The issue of cases against women is especially sensitive. The women are recruited on short-service commission. Army headquarters does not want to discourage potential applicants ? given the shortage of officers ? and is keen to give the impression that the overwhelmingly male-dominated world of the forces is getting more gender-sensitive.

 The court of inquiry has found prima facie evidence that procedural lapses in the discharge of duties by Major Deepa may have been deliberate. Coincidentally, she was with the Judge Advocate General (JAG) branch that administers the justice system within the army.

 Administrative action by the army can take the form of an expression of severe displeasure or a censure. Disciplinary proceedings can mean a court martial or a summary trial or a revoking of the Presidents pleasure as was done against three naval officers found guilty in a war room leak in August 2005. 

 In her petition to Air Chief Marshal Tyagi, Flying Officer Gupta has said the court martial was biased against her. She has pleaded for the court martial to be declared null and void. On December 9, the air force court martial found her guilty and recommended that she be cashiered from service.

 Gupta and her family contend that she was victimised as she blew the whistle on corrupt deals.

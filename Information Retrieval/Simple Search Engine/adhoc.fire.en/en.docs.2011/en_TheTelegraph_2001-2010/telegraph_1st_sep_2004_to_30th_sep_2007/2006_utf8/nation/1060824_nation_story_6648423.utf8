 Haircut clash rages

 Jaipur, Aug. 23 (PTI): Hundreds of Sikhs threw stones and ransacked a police station as protests against the snipping of a Sikh teenagers hair continued today. 

 The protesters, who carried swords, demanded the arrest of the six youths 17-year-old Inderpreet Singh accused of assaulting him and cutting his hair.

 The fury spread to Punjab where educational institutions and shops were forced to shut down.

 In Rajasthan, the protesters ransacked Gandhinagar police station, where the case was registered. The driver and the guard of additional superintendent of police Sanjay Shrotiya were injured. The windscreen of Shrotiyas vehicle was damaged, police said.

 Shrotiya said station house officer Ramdeo Singh and sub-inspector Rajkumar of Gandhinagar police station had been withdrawn from active duty for negligence in dealing with the case.

 As a mark of solidarity, Avtar Singh Makkar, the chief of the SGPC, the highest Sikh temporal body, today presented a turban to Inderpreet.

 The National Commission for Minorities has sought a report on the incident from the Rajasthan government.

 MiG crash

 Barmer, March 21 (PTI): A trainer version of a MiG-21 fighter aircraft crashed soon after getting airborne from Uttarlai airbase today. Both pilots were reported dead.

 The aircraft crashed near Uttarlai village in Barmer district at 1535 hours, an IAF spokesman said in New Delhi, adding that the names of the pilots were being verified.

 The fighter was on a routine flying-training mission. MiG-21s are single-seater aircraft but the one, which crashed, was carrying two pilots as it was a trainer.

 The bodies of the pilots were found near the crash site by rescue helicopters. So far no damage has been reported on the ground as the fighter crashed in an open area, the spokesman said.

 The aircraft was one of the older versions that are being progressively phased out.

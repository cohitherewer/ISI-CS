 Teacher job stay

 Calcutta, July 6: Calcutta High Court today extended its stay on appointment of teachers by the primary education council in Bengal, reports our legal correspondent.

 The court extended the stay order during the hearing of a petition complaining that the council was not following a Supreme Court ruling that allowed applicants for teaching jobs to appear before interview boards even if they were not registered with employment exchanges.

 The council has been following the system of calling only those applicants for interviews who have registered with employment exchanges.

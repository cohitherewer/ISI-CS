 Second pen drive found

 New Delhi, April 15 (PTI): The CBI has recovered a second pen drive from former Wing Commander Sambhajee L. Surve, who was remanded in three more days of CBI custody in the navy war room leak case.

 The CBI counsel, while arguing for more days of remand, told the chief metropolitan magistrate that another pen drive had been found on the premises of Surve. Its detailed analysis report is still awaited, he said.

 The pen drive was seized by the CBI during raids at Surves residence on April 6 after the agency had registered a case against him and eight others under the Officials Secrets Act on March 20.

 The first pen drive was also recovered from Surve by the counter-surveillance wing of the Indian Air Force, which had led to the controversy.

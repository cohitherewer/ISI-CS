 Foetus bones in another well

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Aug. 11: Punjab health authorities today dug out dozens of bones of three-month-old foetuses from a second well near Sahib Nursing Home in Patran in Patiala district.

 Two days ago, 35 female foetuses were fished out of a well behind the nursing home after a complaint was filed by a nurse. Today, the bones were found in a well near the entrance to the nursing home, which is run by a couple.

 We have found 70 pieces of long bones that form parts of limbs in foetuses. The digging of the well is not yet complete, Patiala chief medical officer Varinder Singh Mohi said.

 Chief minister Amarinder Singh, who has so far been silent on the controversy, today said he has directed district police and medical authorities to conduct a probe and bring the guilty to book. 

 The owners of the nursing home, Pritam Singh and Amarjit Kaur, will not be spared, he said.

 Patiala is the chief ministers home district. His wife Preneet Kaur is a Lok Sabha member from there.

 All deputy commissioners were summoned to Chandigarh today to evolve a strategy to curb female foeticide in the state. Amarinder asked them to follow the example set by Nawanshahr district, where health workers, NGOs and the department of child development maintain a record of all pregnant women. They are monitored every month from conception to delivery.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that people from the entire northern region would come to the Patran nursing home for abortions.

 The state health authorities have received information about several nursing homes and ultrasound scanning centres that abort female foetuses in Haryana, which borders Patiala. They have been offering a package deal for both sex determination and abortion, a health official said.

 Residents of Patran have taken to the streets demanding action against those indulging in female foeticide. We now know why so many people are seen around nursing homes in the region, said Mukhtiar Singh, a businessman and father of three daughters.

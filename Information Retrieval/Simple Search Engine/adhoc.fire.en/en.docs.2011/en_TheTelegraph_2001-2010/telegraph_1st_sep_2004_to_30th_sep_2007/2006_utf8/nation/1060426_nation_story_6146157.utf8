 SC appeal limit 

 New Delhi, April 25: The Supreme Court has set strict guidelines to ensure that high courts do not entertain civil appeals unnecessarily and add to the pile-up of cases. 

 The apex court has held that high courts can entertain a second civil appeal only if it involves interpretation of substantial questions of law.

 A high court cannot adjudicate on facts in a second appeal even if it believes that evidence had been grossly misappreciated during both the prior hearings, a bench headed by Justice Ruma Pal said.

 Any rational system of administration of civil law should recognise that litigation in civil cases should have two hearings on facts ? one by the trial court and one by the court of appeal, the apex court said, quoting the 54th Law Commissions report.

 High courts do not have the jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the grounds of an erroneous finding of fact, however gross or inexcusable the error may seem, the court said.

 The Supreme Court also said the high courts cannot admit a second appeal under Section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code without first formulating the substantial questions of law raised in the petition.

 The findings of facts by a subordinate judge can be challenged only in the first appeal before an additional district judge. The first appeal lies before a single judge of a high court if the case is initially heard by an additional district judge.

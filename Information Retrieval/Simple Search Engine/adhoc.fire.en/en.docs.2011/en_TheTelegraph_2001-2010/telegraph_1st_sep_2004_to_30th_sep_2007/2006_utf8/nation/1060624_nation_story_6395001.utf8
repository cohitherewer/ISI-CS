 Calcutta, June 23: The Bengal government is banking on the stupendous growth in its earnings from value-added tax (VAT) to fuel development programmes and tide it over the financial crisis that it had slumped into only a few years ago.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today projected an increase of Rs 1,114 crore in VAT revenue. 

 To put this in perspective, a whopping 69 per cent of the growth in Bengals tax revenue would be a result of increased VAT collection. The total state tax revenue is projected to go up by Rs 1,611 crore this financial year.

 VAT was introduced in the state on April 1, 2005, amid traders protests. In the first full year after that, collection (the budget papers still refer to it as sales tax) grew by about Rs 800 crore.

 The value-added tax, which resulted in an overall revenue growth of 18 per cent, and the curb on non-plan expenditure enabled Dasgupta to increase the plan outlay for the state by as much as 24.5 per cent. On the basis of these efforts, it would be possible to enhance the states plan by 24.5 per cent to Rs 8,374 crore, up from Rs 6,726 crore in the previous year, he said.

 Given the expected growth in tax collection, the minister has managed to bring down additional resource mobilisation to Rs 46 crore from Rs 100 crore in the previous year. 

 Dasgupta hoped that the budget would have a final total deficit of Rs 6 crore.

 The projected growth in VAT revenue, the minister said, would result from better compliance and procedural simplifications.

 The budget proposed re-introduction of the one-time settlement of disputes. Dealers who have appealed for revision on or after April 1, 2003, or will do so by August 31, 2006, can arrive at a settlement paying 40 per cent of the disputed tax and 5 per cent of the disputed interest and penalty.

 The measure is expected to yield Rs 14 crore in the remaining part of the year.

 A Settlement Commission would be formed to settle certain types of disputes within three months of receiving an application. 

 The mechanism for settlement under this scheme will be laid down in the finance bill.

 A year after the introduction of VAT, the number of registered dealers has gone up from 1.3 lakh to 1.68 lakh and the tax base has become bigger.

 Industry observers believe that Dasgupta is hoping there would be an overall growth in the states economy leading to better tax collection.

 Nazeeb Arif, the Indian Chamber of Commerce secretary-general, said the state domestic product would grow by 8.5 per cent. This indicates that there would be higher growth in agriculture, industry and service sectors. Consequently, consumption will increase and that would lead to higher VAT collection.

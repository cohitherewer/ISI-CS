 Sudden death for TN wife-beater

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Joseph and Mary

 Tirunelveli, Dec. 25: When you mention the name in the middle-class neighbourhood of Shanthi Nagar, people are slightly shocked.

 Oh, him? Isnt he the one whose picture was flashed on all television channels recently? a neighbour said of the first man to be arrested in the country under the new domestic violence act.

 It isnt the shame that has hung a pall over Josephs devoutly Christian family, though. Its the 47-year-old mans death from a heart attack on December 4, just five weeks after an FIR against him was registered on October 28.

 In their flat-roofed, two-room house, Josephs father Job blames his sons heavy drinking both for his fights with wife Benedict Mary and his untimely death.

 I suspect his liquor habit ruined him, said the retired government employee in his 70s. That evening, when I returned from church, Joseph was already in bed, motionless. When I touched him, his legs and hands felt so cold, as if they had been in a freezer.

 Mary, whose complaint led Joseph to be suspended from his government job, blames their marital problems on liquor as well as her husbands greed for dowry, though she couches it in polite words.

 There was an information gap and lack of understanding between our two families, she said at her new home where she lives with her two daughters.

 Marys father was a well-off farmer from the neighbouring Kanyakumari district while the men in Josephs family have been government employees down the generations.

 My father had to sell his entire land to marry off his three daughters and we had fallen on bad times. I told Joseph everything but he kept complaining that I hadnt been given a fair share of the property after my fathers death, she said.

 This oblique hint that I hadnt brought enough dowry was a constant source of friction. Our quarrels degenerated into nasty verbal abuses and then he would beat me. I tried to smoothen the rough edges in his nature, but his alcoholism made him increasingly violent.

 While his son was alive, Job had, with the mediation of local churchmen, been trying to get Mary to withdraw her complaint. Things were working out but too slowly, he said.

 After Josephs death, his younger brother, who works in Tuticorin, informed police and the body was sent for a post-mortem.

 It was a kidney failure leading to a heart attack, said Job. The medical report, at least, saved the family further embarrassment, he felt.

 What about Josephs pension and other retirement benefits? Ive nothing to do with all that now. Its between his wife and the government. She has two daughters to look after, so all that should go to them, Job said.

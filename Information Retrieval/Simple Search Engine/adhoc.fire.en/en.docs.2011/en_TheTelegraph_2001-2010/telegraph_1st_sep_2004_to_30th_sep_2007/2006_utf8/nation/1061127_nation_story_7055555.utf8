 Racial slur

 Melbourne, Nov. 26 (PTI): An Indian woman who emigrated to Australia seven years ago has been awarded $15,000 (Rs 6.9 lakh) as compensation after a colleague made racial slurs against her in front of co-workers.

 Rama Velagapudi, 55, who became an Australian citizen in 2001, told the New South Wales equal opportunity tribunal she had learnt of the comments from colleagues, the Courier Mail reported today.

 Accused Leanne Spooner said she had walked into an empty aisle and mouthed the words in extreme frustration at Ramas inefficiency. 

 But the tribunal last week accepted Ramas version, saying several people had heard the remark.

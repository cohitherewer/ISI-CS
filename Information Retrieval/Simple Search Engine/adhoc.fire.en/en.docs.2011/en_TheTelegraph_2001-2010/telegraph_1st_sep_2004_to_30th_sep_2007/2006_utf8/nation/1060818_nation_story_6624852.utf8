 Graft cases filed against Maneka

 New Delhi: The CBI has filed two cases 

 against Maneka Gandhi on charges of forgery, cheating and 

 corruption.

 Maneka, her sister and four others are accused of diverting funds from the Maulana Azad Educational Foundation when she was social justice and empowerment minister in the NDA government.

 Both cases were filed after a preliminary inquiry registered on November 14 last year, a CBI spokesman said.

 In one case, the manager of the Alp Sankhyak Mridul Girls Inter-College Shiksha Samiti at Pilibhit had applied to the Maulana Azad foundation for a grant of Rs 42 lakh on April 12, 1999. The application enclosed details of teachers and students in the school running for three years. All the documents submitted were false and forged, the spokesman said. No school was running at the time.

 The samiti was sanctioned Rs 15 

 lakh on October 22, 1999, at a meeting of the governing 

 body presided by Maneka , the spokesman said. 

 In the second case, the CBI found that the Gandhi Rural Welfare Trust was registered on March 8, 2000, with Ambika as chairperson and one of her friends as managing trustee. The friend wrote to Maneka claiming falsely that the trust was involved for a long time in social work and requesting five acres for a nursing college. She forwarded the letter to the Pilibhit district magistrate on March 21 and a plot was selected.

 An application was made on January 2, 2001, to the Maulana Azad foundation for Rs 218 lakh to set up the nursing college. At a meeting in 2001 presided over by Maneka, Rs 50 lakh was sanctioned.

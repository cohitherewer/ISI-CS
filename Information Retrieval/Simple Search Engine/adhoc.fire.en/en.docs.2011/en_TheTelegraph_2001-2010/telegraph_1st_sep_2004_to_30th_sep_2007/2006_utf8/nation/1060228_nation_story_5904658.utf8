 Salman: Another blow

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: A court in Jodhpur today read out charges to Salman Khan and four other actors for shooting black bucks eight years ago.

 If proved guilty, Salman and his friends may be in jail for at least one to four years, said Y.P Singh, a Mumbai-based lawyer dealing with environment issues.

 Salman, who was sentenced to a year in prison 10 days ago in a chinkara poaching case, turned up with colleagues Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam at judicial magistrate Dalpat Singh Rajpurohits court this afternoon.

 The actors, along with two Jodhpur residents, have been accused of killing two black bucks at Kankani village on the night of October 1 during the filming of Hum Saath Saath Hain in 1998.

 Charges against Salman, the main accused, were framed under the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching of black bucks, and Section 148 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. 

 Saif, Neelam, Tabu, Sonali and their co-accused, Dushyant Singh and Dinesh Ghawre, have been accused of abetting the crime and face charges under other sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Indian Penal Code.

 All the accused pleaded not guilty and preferred a trial in the case. The filmstars also requested exemption from personal appearance in court.

 Public prosecutor N.K. Sankhla, however, said there was prima facie evidence against the seven.

 Prime witness Harish Dulani, who had given evidence against Salman during an in-camera hearing of the case in 1998, has disappeared. Dulani, the actors driver, allegedly saw him shooting the black bucks and slitting the throat of one of them.

 Salman appeared in another Jodhpur court for the chinkara poaching case. The actor has refused to produce any witness in his defence.

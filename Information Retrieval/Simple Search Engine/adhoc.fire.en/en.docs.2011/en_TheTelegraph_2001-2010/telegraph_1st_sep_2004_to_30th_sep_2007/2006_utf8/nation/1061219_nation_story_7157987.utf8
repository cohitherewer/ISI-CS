 Box office flop, but rolling in money

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 18: Weekend box-office tallies might cease to matter to producers who use a variety of mediums, other than theatres, to deliver movies to people, says the author of a book that looks at the way money-making in Bollywood has changed with technology.

 I say that if you are alert to the possibilities that technology affords through media convergence, you dont have to depend on the box-office. In fact, it would be impossible to produce a flop film, says Derek Bose in his book, Brand Bollywood.

 Film entertainment will be available over FM radio, Internet, home video, animation/gaming, mobiles and through live entertainment.

 Not too far in the future, the FSS (Friday-Saturday-Sunday) factor of revenues at the box-office might slip into irrelevance, he says. It will create a situation where mainstream films wont be star or content-driven. Packaging and marketing will be the true heroes.

 Bose cites blockbusters like Rang De, Krishh, Don, Lagey Raho Munnabhai and Dhoom 2 as examples of films that are non-conventional, but well packaged. Subhas Ghais Kisna and Ashutosh Gowarikars Swades turned out to be huge money-spinners despite being box-office duds. They owed their success to marketing.

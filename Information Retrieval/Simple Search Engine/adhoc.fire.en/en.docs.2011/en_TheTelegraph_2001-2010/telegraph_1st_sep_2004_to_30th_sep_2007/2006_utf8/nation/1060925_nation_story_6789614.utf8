 Cong slips on satyagraha

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: Munnabhai may have restored the Mahatma to the nations consciousness but the Congress, which claims to be the sole inheritor of Gandhijis ideology, has no idea how to celebrate October 2 and hundred years of the satyagraha.

 The party is already 13 days late because the concept of satyagraha, the force born out of truth and non-violence, came into being on September 11, 1906, in Johannesburg.

 Indeed, in South Africa, the celebrations though yet to be formally kick-started have begun from March.

 With his government and party clueless on how to commemorate Gandhis bequeathal, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have to make do with South Africas offerings. He will formally launch the 100th anniversary during his two-day visit from September 30 in the three cities with which Gandhi was closely associated: Durban, Johannesburg and Pretoria.

 This means Singh will not be in India on Gandhi Jayanti on October 2 the first time that a Prime Minister will not be in Rajghat to pay homage to the Father of the Nation on the day he was born.

 Congress general secretary A.K. Antony, who heads a committee specially set up two weeks ago by Sonia Gandhi to chalk out a programme for the satyagraha centenary, admitted that he knew nothing about what the party would do. First, we will observe the jayanti in the party headquarters, then we will decide what to do about the 100 years. Nothing has been finalised, he said.

 The Congress president has been invited to deliver the annual Gandhi lecture by the Durban local government (eThekweni municipality) this September. But Antony said it is not known whether she will go or not.

 Going by Sonias work schedule, once she returns from the conclave of Congress chief ministers in Nainital, it will nearly be time to leave for Brussels. She is expected to inaugurate Tejas, the central part of the Festival of India organised by the Indian Council of Cultural Relations.

 The Prime Ministers stopovers in South Africa include the Phoenix Settlement where Gandhi visualised the satyagraha philosophy, the Pietermaritzburg station where he was thrown off a first-class, whites only, compartment, and the Durban City Centre where protesters gathered to struggle against the former apartheid regime.

 But sources said revisiting Gandhi was just one part of Singhs agenda. It is a bilateral visit, the Prime Minister will hold talks with the President (Thabo Mbeki) and there is a large agenda for economic and defence cooperation, said a source.

 South Africa has stolen a march over India by unveiling yearlong programmes organised by the local governments in Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg. For starters, there was a world conference on religion and peace and walks through the Phoenix Settlement organised by the Mahatma Gandhi Salt March Coordinating Committee to make people aware of satyagraha and non-violence.

 Scramble to salvage nuclear deal with US

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, May 17: Indian and American officials are engaged in a hectic effort to breathe new life into the Indo-US nuclear deal, which faces extinction on account of political exigencies on both sides.

 US President George W. Bushs top nuclear negotiator with India, Nicholas Burns, got on the phone to foreign secretary Shyam Saran yesterday as part of this effort: the two officials will meet in London next week to rescue the deal, which is facing stiff opposition in the US Congress.

 Today, Burns will meet key American lawmakers, including Tom Lantos, the senior-most Democrat on the House of Representatives International Relations Committee (HIRC), in an attempt by the Bush administration to regain the initiative on the nuclear deal from the Congress.

 Lantos had said last week that the Bush administrationsagreement with India, in its present form, lacked the necessary support on Capitol Hill for legislative action and proposed a hitherto undisclosed compromise which will enable the legislation to pass.

 At his meeting with Lantos and other key legislators, Burns will try to persuade them to put off any compromise amendment to the nuclear bill, which could open a Pandoras Box and delay attempts to clear the nuclear bill on Capitol Hill.

 Already the atmosphere in the Congress has been seriously vitiated by a letter circulated to his colleagues by Howard Berman, who is next in seniority to Lantos on the HIRC.

 Among other things, Berman says in his letter: I am particularly concerned that the agreement does nothing to limit Indias production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.

 He has threatened to move legislation in the Congress, which will establish a set of objective conditions that a non-NPT (Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty) country must meet to become eligible for civilian nuclear cooperation with the US.

 What is galling for the Indian government and the Bush administration is that Berman is a member of the India Caucus on Capitol Hill and claims to support the deal.

 Sources said the administrations bid to woo Lantos may succeed because of an unexpected Indian diplomatic coup here earlier this week.

 After persistent Indian efforts, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) this week wrote to leading US legislators in support of the deal.

 We believe the overarching benefit of this agreement is strategic. After almost 50 years of misunderstanding, India and the US are on a path of rapidly increasing cooperation.... The US-India nuclear agreement will advance this growing relationship, and is profoundly in Americas national interest, Robert Goodkind and D.A. Harris of the AJC wrote.

 Their letter was the result of a determined effort by Raminder Singh Jassal, former Indian ambassador to Israel, now deputy chief of mission at the Indian embassy here, to get Americas powerful Jewish lobby to support the nuclear deal.

 In Delhi, the PMO is hoping the BJP will moderate its opposition to the deal after national security adviser M.K. Narayanan wrote an exhaustive letter to Jaswant Singh, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. 

 The reply was in response to a nine-page letter written by Jaswant to the Prime Minister last month.

 The Prime Ministers aides are also hoping to bring round leaders of Left parties to mute their reservations about the deal with America now that their political exigencies, caused by Assembly elections, are over.

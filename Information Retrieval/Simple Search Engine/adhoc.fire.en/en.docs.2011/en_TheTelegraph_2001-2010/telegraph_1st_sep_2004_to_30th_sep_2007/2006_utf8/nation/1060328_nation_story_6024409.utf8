 Electronic nose to sniff out diseases

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): Scientists at the University of Buffalo, US, are developing an electronic nose, a super-sensitive breathalyser-type tool, to sniff out diseases. 

 The device would identify diseases by sensing chemical patterns carried in the breath, said Frank Bright, one of the developers. 

 However, Dr T.S. Sidhu, the head of the ENT department, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, here said: This device is at a very early experimental stage. Until its efficacy is proved, we cannot say much about the day-to-day use. 

 Earlier disease-smelling systems have been big and difficult to use and had limited capability. We are making a small, inexpensive and robust device to assess the same things, anywhere. It could work in the field, at the mall, in the parking lot and at home, Bright said in a report. 

 Researchers have linked some of these chemical patterns, known as biomarkers, to diseases like diabetes, AIDS and schizophrenia, the report in Human Biology on live science said. 

 Made up of sensors similar to receptors in nasal passages in humans, the gadget does not look like a nose. Molecules floating in the air trigger these sensors. When a patient breathes into the device, different molecules will trigger a different set of sensors to light up. 

 Bright and his research team can train the device, composed of artificial nerve cells mimicking a brain, to connect the patterns of lights with particular diseases. 

 Scientists will start training it by comparing samples from patients already diagnosed with cancer. They will search for similar patterns in the patients breath so that in the future when the device sees those patterns, it recognises cancer. 

 So far, Brights team has created about 100 different sensors, which match up to all kinds of molecules. They aim to produce a million sensors.

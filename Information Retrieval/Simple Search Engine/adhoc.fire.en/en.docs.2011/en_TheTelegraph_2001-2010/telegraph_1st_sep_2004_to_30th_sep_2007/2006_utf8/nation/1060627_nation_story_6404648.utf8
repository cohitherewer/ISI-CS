The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM in Bengal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh, Bhattacharjee 

 New Delhi, June 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can breathe easy ? Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will visit Bengal after all.

 The trip will be made before the monsoon session of Parliament begins on July 24, although dates havent been finalised yet, sources close to the Prime Minister said. 

 Singh is arriving to complete an unfinished agenda. He will lay the foundation stone of an Indian Institute of Science, which was first scheduled for October 2005. It had to be postponed after the Prime Minister cut short his visit of Bengal and the Northeast and rushed back as pre-Diwali blasts rocked Delhi. 

 The visit was next scheduled for June, but was again put off although the Prime Minister did go to the Northeast. 

 Sources close to him said Singh had skipped Bengal to send a tough signal to the CPM, which rules the state. He was peeved with the partys central leaders for breathing down his neck on economic policies and refusing to allow his government to function normally. 

 Although Singh will meet chief minister Bhattacharjee in Calcutta, sources said they were not sure if the meeting would be just a courtesy call or more. Earlier, there had been talk that the two would discuss development projects.

 For much of July, Singh will be travelling within India. After a three-day trip to villages Vidharbha this week , he is likely to go to Bihar and Orissa on a similar mission ? to assess how the his governments social sector initiatives like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act are functioning on the ground.

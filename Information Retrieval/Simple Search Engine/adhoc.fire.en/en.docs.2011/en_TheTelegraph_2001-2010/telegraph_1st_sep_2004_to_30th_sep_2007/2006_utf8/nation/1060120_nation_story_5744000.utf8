 Quattrocchi: Relieved?

 London, Jan. 19: The Crown Prosecution Service in Britain is continuing to liaise with Indian authorities over Ottavio Quattrocchi, it was confirmed today.

 However, this does not mean anything new is going to happen with the Italian businessmans London accounts.

 They remain unfrozen and the CPS has made no new applications to the high court to have that changed. The accounts were frozen in 2003 and unfrozen, at the request of the Indian authorities, on January 11.

 Officially, the CPS spokeswoman will only say: Our discussions and communications with the CBI are subject to legal privilege because of our relationship as agents for them in this matter. This means Im not able to discuss specifics.

 Read between the lines, what all this means in plain English is: please dont bother to try to freeze those accounts again. This is just not going to happen. You were the ones who instructed us to unfreeze the accounts. How come you want that reversed? You cant mess with the English criminal system.

 Impasse on womens quota

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Nov. 21: The womens reservation bill is unlikely to be introduced in Parliaments winter session as ruling coalition allies like the RJD, DMK and the PMK still have serious reservations despite the Prime Ministers repeated assertions on passing the legislation.

 I feel introduction (of the bill) will be possible only after another round of talks, said parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

 There is no problem with introducing it for the third time. But a bill should be brought only if we are certain of its passage. If we introduce this bill, it will be sent again to a standing committee. The womens bill is not another simple bill. It requires a constitutional amendment, which needs the vote of two-thirds of the House.

 Das Munshi (in picture) maintained that for the Congress, the base line was 33 per cent reservation and no less. It is believed that the BJP indicated to the government that it was looking at alternatives such as adopting the Election Commissions proposal to leave it to individual parties to reserve seats for women while distributing tickets in elections. 

 The contentious bill on quotas for the other backward classes in unaided institutions and private deemed universities is also unlikely to be tabled this session, which begins tomorrow.

 Among the important bills the Centre will introduce are the Judges (Inquiry) Bill, 2006, which allows complaints of misbehaviour or incapacity against all members of the higher judiciary (barring the Chief Justice of India) to be filed before a five-judge national council. 

 The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Bill, 2006, also figures on the list. If passed, it will disallow several organisations, including those of a political nature, from receiving foreign funds. 

 It also plans to debar any individual or organisation indulging in communal tension or disharmony or conversion through inducement or force, either directly or indirectly, from one religious faith to another from accepting foreign contributions.

 On the agenda for introduction are the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2006, the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2004, and the Broadcasting Services Mandatory Sharing of Sports Signals Bill, 2006.

 One bill which will almost certainly be passed is the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes (Reservation in Posts and Services) Bill, 2004. It is seen as an answer by the Centre to the Supreme Courts observation to recognise a creamy layer of the Dalits.

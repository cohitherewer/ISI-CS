 Stable mind must for valid will: SC

 New delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has held that the signature of the person making the will would not be sufficient for a will to be valid. It has to be proved that the person making the will was in a proper state of mind.

 The propounder is required to prove that the testator has signed the will, and he had put his signature out of his own free will having a sound disposition of mind, it said.

 The ruling came after the court heard the case involving the will of Umeshchandra Joshi, owner of Ramtirth Brahmi Hair Oil, who had seven sons and three daughters but had bequeathed all his property only on his second son.

 The will was drafted in the ICU of a hospital, where he was being treated under a doctor who was a student of the beneficiary. It was executed in the presence of two witnesses who were also close to the beneficiary.

 The family members who were deprived questioned the genuineness of the will.

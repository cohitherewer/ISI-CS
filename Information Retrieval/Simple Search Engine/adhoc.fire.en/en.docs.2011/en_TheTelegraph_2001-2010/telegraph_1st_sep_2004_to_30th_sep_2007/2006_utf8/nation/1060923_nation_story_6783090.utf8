 Bangalore, Sept. 22: When Naureen Naz was born 26 years ago, five-year-old Asif Sauds grandmother had taken one look at the baby and declared: This little bundle is for Saud.

 Little did she know that the couple would have to wait nine years after their formal engagement to honour her wish, with the marriage held up by hurdles like explosions and military build-ups along the border. 

 The engagement, after all, was no ordinary one. While Asif is a Bangalorean, Naureen is a Pakistani. Asif, 31, who married Naureen in Karachi on August 7, said every little niggle in Indo-Pak relations caused a delay. Whenever the ties dipped, it became difficult to get visas.

 Even when we got a visa this time, we werent sure we would be able to go as the Mumbai train blasts happened. We were a large group of 20 but finally managed to fly to Karachi, Asif said.

 There were other reasons for postponements, too. Naureens father died, setting the wedding date back. Floods interfered three times.

 Not many here were encouraging. People kept reminding me that India-Pakistan relations have never been good. Some told me I would never be happy, Asif said.

 Asifs perseverance has paid off but theres been no honeymoon yet. Naureen is here on a 45-day visitors visa, so she needs police permission to travel outside Bangalore.

 Another hassle is that the visa must be repeatedly extended till she can get Indian citizenship in five years or so. Both can be a headache.

 Last year, Mumbai resident Ganga Wahela, 67, who had arrived from Pakistan 50 years ago and got married, received a deportation notice. Her 70-year-old husband Prithviraj said they had tried in vain for decades to get her a citizenship and had in the 1970s procured a long-term visa.

 Again last year, Pakistan asked pregnant Indian doctor Divya Dayanandan now Hafza Aman to quit the country, where she was living with her Pakistani husband whom she had married a year earlier. It took her a court battle to get Pakistani citizenship.

 Asif, an engineer who designs websites, is determined to fight every odd. He said this wasnt the first cross-border marriage in the family: his aunt Naureens mother had married her first cousin in a Pakistani family. She had come to India for her delivery.

 When Asifs mother went to Karachi for a wedding in 1991, Naureens family confirmed that her engagement to Asif was still on. The engagement was formalised in 1997.

 I didnt even have a picture of her as her family is very conservative, Asif said.

 A Bangalore photographer covering the last Indian cricket tour of Pakistan lent a helping hand. He met Naureen in Karachi, took her pictures and handed them over to Asif, who began communicating with the girl four years ago after convincing her family to buy a computer.

 Initially, I would get just one reply for several emails. Later, things improved and we fixed a time to chat on the Internet every day. Once a month we would speak on the phone.

 How does the bride find India? Accha lag raha hai, she said shyly, the mehndi still bright on her hands.

 Court jolt to Fardeen in cocaine case

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Fardeen Khan

 Mumbai, June 5: Actor Fardeen Khan, who is facing trial in a cocaine seizure case, got a jolt today as a special court rejected his petition to amend the charges filed against him. 

 The court said there was no merit in the actors plea.

 While Fardeen said he wanted to buy one gram of cocaine from drug peddler and co-accused Nasir Abdul Karim Khan at the time of his arrest in 2001, the chargesheet filed by the Narcotics Control Bureau alleged nine grams of cocaine were seized from the duo.

 Fardeen had moved the court to amend the chargesheet because punishment under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act varies according to the quantum of the drug found on the accused.

 Possession of up to five grams of cocaine attracts a six-month jail term. 

 A court can also let the accused off on probation. The third alternative is committing the accused to detoxication centre, if it is a first-time offence.

 However, possession of five grams or more of cocaine could lead to 10 years in prison. It may be extended to 20 years and be liable to a fine between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh

 Fardeens lawyer Aiyaz Khan pleaded that the actor in his confession had said he wanted to buy one gram of cocaine from Nasir. He said Nasir had also admitted that the actor wanted to buy only one gram of the drug and the rest of the quan- tity seized from him was meant for himself or for sale to others.

 He pointed out that the panchnama bears out Nasirs statement that the actor wanted to buy one gram of cocaine.

 The lawyer also cited a written information given by the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances zonal office in Mumbai to its headquarters in Delhi stating that the actor wanted to buy one gram of cocaine for personal consumption.

 Outside the court, the lawyer said he would seek Fardeens instructions to file an appeal in Bombay High Court.

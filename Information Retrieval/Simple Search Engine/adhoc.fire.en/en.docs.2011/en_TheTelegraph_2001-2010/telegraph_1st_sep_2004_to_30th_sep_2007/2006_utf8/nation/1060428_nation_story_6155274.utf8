 Wheres the data, SC asks govt 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 27: Does the government know how many quota candidates manage to secure jobs under the general category, the Supreme Court asked today.

 The courts point was that only such data could show whether job quotas have succeeded ? and therefore whether any group should be taken out of the reservation list.

 Tell us, which government is keeping any data on how many are getting representation (jobs) without reservation. I dont think the Centre or the state governments are keeping any such data so that any group can be taken out of reservation, Chief Justice of India Y.K. Sabharwal said.

 A five-judge Constitution bench headed by him was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the validity of the 77th, 82nd, 83rd and the 85th amendments to the Constitution expanding the scope of job reservations.

 The courts observation came after senior counsel P.P. Rao, appearing for a group supporting reservation in promotions, argued that quotas had to continue till the weaker sections got adequate representation in government jobs.

 No government is doing any charity to these people. They are only carrying out the constitutional mandate, Rao said.

 The 77th amendment was brought to do away with the Supreme Court ruling in the Mandal Commission case restricting quotas to appointments as opposed to promotions. Article 16 (4A) was inserted to provide for reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

 The 85th amendment widened this to provide for reservation in promotions even for the Other Backward Classes.

 The 82nd amendment did away with the provision in Article 335 that allowed reservation subject to efficiency of administration. The government brought the amendment in the year 2000 to allow reservation by lowering the standards of evaluation.

 The 83rd amendment has to do with job reservation in certain states.

 A petition challenging the extension of the reservation period from 50 to 60 years (that is, till the year 2010) is pending before the apex court. 

 Another Constitution bench is likely to hear the matter, which relates to the amendment of Article 334 of the Constitution.

 Article 334 initially provided for reservation only for 10 years. It was extended to 30 years by an amendment in 1959, to 40 years in 1980 and to 50 years in 1989.

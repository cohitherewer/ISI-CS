 Bhatta Majra (Fatehgarh Sahib), March 27: The prince came, he saw, but was whisked away before he could react.

 Four English words ? Save the girl child ? stood out from a mass of Hindi and Punjabi as Charles, Britains royal scion, visited Bhatta Majra, chief minister Amarinder Singh in tow.

 As soon as the prince glanced at the boards, Amarinder led him away to waiting villagers who had been handpicked by the administration to greet him.

 Fatehgarh Sahib has the lowest juvenile sex ratio in the country, but no point parading it before the prince.

 Later, asked about the message on the boards, a member of the royal entourage said Charles should have been here for this cause. People will, in any case, shift to organic farming in the years to come after the ill-effects of pesticides and insecticides become uncontrollable, the member added.

 Earlier, a tour of the village revealed that most residents had no idea why Bhatta Majra, which lies next to Grand Trunk Road, had suddenly been noticed by the government or who exactly was visiting them.

 Some just drew their own conclusions. There is a factory coming up nearby, said Joginder Kaur. Its owner is coming.

 The village was chosen only because it lies close to the under-construction Punjab Agri Food Park, the site of the headquarters of the Bhumi Vardaan Foundation that the prince formally launched at a function later in the day at Yadvindra Public School in Patiala.

 The foundation is aimed at assisting farmers who want to engage in sustainable agriculture and to demonstrate what Charles calls the virtuous circle of providing natural, chemical-free, high quality food to consumers.

 So far, only one farmer in the village, Daya Krishan, has switched to organic farming, which Charles has been championing. The prince met Krishan for a while.

 In the village, Charles entered a house that was not on the list. He emerged after spending a few minutes with the family. 

 My cheeks are still red, burbled a woman. He is so handsome.

 The villagers had been asked not to step out of their homes till Charles had left but were allowed to stand on rooftops. Wave, but not ask questions. He should have been here with a message for the entire state to end female foeticide , said Santokh Singh, a villager.

 Most villagers were disappointed that Duchess of Cornwall Camilla did not accompany Charles. Memsahib should have come with her husband. At least then, both would have taken time off to speak about our problems and get the government to do something, rued Ram Swaroop, a potter.

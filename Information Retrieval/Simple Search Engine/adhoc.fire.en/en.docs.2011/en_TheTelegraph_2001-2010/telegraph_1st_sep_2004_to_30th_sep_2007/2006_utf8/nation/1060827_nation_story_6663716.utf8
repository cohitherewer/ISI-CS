 CMs, but no Pawar, at agri meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have convened a meeting of party chief ministers in Nainital to discuss farm policies and rise in prices, but agriculture minister Sharad Pawar will not attend it.

 The meeting on September 23 and 24 was called following the Lefts criticism of the Centres anti-farmer policies and the agriculture ministrys failure to check profiteering and price rise.

 Janardhan Dwivedi, the chairman of the partys media cell, said the meeting will be attended by 14 chief ministers from the party and will focus exclusively on agriculture. But Pawar will be absent and will go unrepresented as he is not from the Congress. 

 Cabinet ministers P. Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee and Shivraj Patil will be present at the meeting. 

 As this is a party affair, sources said it would be improper to invite a non-Congress minister. But they also admitted that had the agriculture minister been anyone other than Pawar, the Congress may have asked him to join even if he was from another party. 

 The equation between the Congress and Pawars Nationalist Congress Party is not on an even keel. The bitterness has got pronounced after the Centre and the Congress were attacked for their failure to arrest price rise and ensure regular supplies of essential commodities.

 In party closed-door meetings, some Congress members blamed Pawar for bringing matters to such a pass. They demanded he be moved to another ministry, alleging he deliberately put the Congress in a tight corner. 

 The Congresss proposals to curtail forward trading and speculation in foodgrains and other essentials, restrict their free movement and crack down on hoarders were reportedly scuttled by Pawars ministry on the argument that such moves would evoke memories of the licence raj.

 Natwar off Sandesh

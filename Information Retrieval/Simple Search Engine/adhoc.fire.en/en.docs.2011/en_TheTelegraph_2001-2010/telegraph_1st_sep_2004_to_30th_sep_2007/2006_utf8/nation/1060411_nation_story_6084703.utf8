 Rs 100-cr gasp in Bollywood

 SAMYABRATA GOSWAMI

 Salman comes out of the Jodhpur court on Monday.

Mumbai, April 10: With over Rs 100 crore and five films riding on Salman Khan, Bollywood is in jitters over the five-year prison term.

 The films that may be hit are: God Tussi Great Ho, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra; Farah Khans husband and editor-turned-film-maker Shirish Kunders Jaaneman; Ravi Chopras Babul, featuring Rani Mukherji and Bachchan. The last film is in the post-production stage.

 The others are Raj Kanwars Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, Nikhil Advanis Salam-e-Ishq, which Salman might lose because its shooting is yet to begin. The actors first Hollywood movie, Marigold, is awaiting release. 

 Some of his under-production films have already started feeling the pinch of the judgment. One of the immediate films likely to be affected is Jaaneman, produced by Sajid Nadiadwala. The film is in the final stages of production and was due for release in August.

 Nimbus Motion Pictures, part of the group that acquired cricket telecast rights, had recently struck a deal with the producer for acquiring the Mumbai rights of the film, according to Vivek Vaswani, the adviser of Nimbus.

 The film is among Nimbuss big acquisitions after it recently forayed into distribution but the company seems to be having second thoughts after the court verdict.

 It is a well-known fact that we were to be the official Mumbai distributors of Jaaneman. We had already negotiated for the film and were all set to sign the confirmation contract today but the scenario has changed in the wake of Salmans arrest. We have now decided to wait and watch the situation for some time. One cannot rule out intermittent delays in the little work that needs to be completed besides the likely shift in the probable release timing, Vaswani said.

 Nevertheless, Vaswani, who is among the many ardent Salman supporters in the industry, is determined to stand by the actor in his time of crisis.

 Salman is an old friend. I am disturbed by the judgment. It is sad that everyone has conveniently forgotten the kind of money he spends on social causes. Instead of punishing him with a rigorous imprisonment of five years, it would have been befitting to fine him Rs 1 crore and set up a sanctuary for endangered species to facilitate an environment where chinkaras will be totally protected.

 Lets not forget that Salman has a huge fan following and the government is likely to lose a huge amount by way of entertainment tax, if his films were to be affected, he said.

 Salman, one of Bollywoods most celebrated and controversial stars, made a remarkable comeback last year with the blockbuster No Entry.

 Despite allegations of underworld links, his Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya, also starring Katrina Kaif, raked in big bucks.

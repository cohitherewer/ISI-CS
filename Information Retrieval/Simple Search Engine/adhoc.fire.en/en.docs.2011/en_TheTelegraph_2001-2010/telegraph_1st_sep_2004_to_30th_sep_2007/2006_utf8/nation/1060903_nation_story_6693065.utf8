 HIV carrier stoned to death

 PRIYA ABRAHAM

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 2: Loknath Mishra, 35, tested HIV-positive two years ago. But something more lethal than the virus killed him last night.

 The Puri-based jobless bachelor died after succumbing to deep gashes on his head inflicted by a group of youths that allegedly stoned him for carrying the virus.

 Mishra, living in Tihidisahi area of the temple town with his family, was admitted to the TB and infectious diseases ward of Puri district headquarters hospital on August 7 after his condition worsened. On Monday, when Mishra came out of the ward, the youths hurled stones at him.

 Mishra suffered severe head injuries and was admitted to the district hospital in Puri from where he returned to the TB ward on Thursday.

 Yesterday, Mishra died. Excessive bleeding from the head injury led to Loknaths death, his brother, Markand, said.

 Markand, who works in a grocery shop, today lodged a complaint with Kumbharpada police station in Puri. No one has been arrested so far.

 Mishra, who was staying with his brother, was reportedly a drug addict since his youth. His family members believe that Mishra might have contacted the virus two years ago during one of the drug sessions.

 After learning that he had been tested HIV-positive, some of Mishras neighbours in Kumbharpada started treating the family members like pariahs. 

 We were ostracised and people stopped coming to my house because of my brothers condition. On many occasions, they threatened to kill my brother, Markand said. 

 We have sent the body for post-mortem and are waiting for the report, said Kumbharpada sub-inspector Artratrana Nanda.

 In Kendrapara district, where HIV prevalence is second only to Ganjam in the state, victims and their family members have been debarred from social functions in several cases. In February this year, the body of a 54-year-old man was not allowed to be cremated after villagers felt that burning it would make the air impure. The body was later buried.

 In November last year, sisters Kanakalata Nayak(6) and Rashmi Nayak (8) were driven out of their village in Jagatsinghpur district for testing HIV-positive. 

 The orphaned girls had lost their parents to AIDS. Rashmi was thrown out of the local primary school when teachers learnt of her HIV-positive status. Villagers kept their children away from her sister.

 Between 2003 and 2005, as many as 459 people have succumbed to AIDS in Orissa.

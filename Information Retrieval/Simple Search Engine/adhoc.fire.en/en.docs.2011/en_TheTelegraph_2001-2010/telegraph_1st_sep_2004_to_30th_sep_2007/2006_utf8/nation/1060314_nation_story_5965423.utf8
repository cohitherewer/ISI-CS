 EVM with braille

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 13: An NGO has requested the Election Commission to introduce electronic voting machines (EVM) with braille features to ensure participation of visually handicapped voters in the coming Assembly elections in five states.

 In a letter to chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon, the Disabled Rights Group appreciated the poll panels decision to ensure ramps at polling booths this time but said the concerns of visually and hearing impaired people had been ignored.

 The NGO has also moved the Supreme Court seeking facilities for disabled voters.

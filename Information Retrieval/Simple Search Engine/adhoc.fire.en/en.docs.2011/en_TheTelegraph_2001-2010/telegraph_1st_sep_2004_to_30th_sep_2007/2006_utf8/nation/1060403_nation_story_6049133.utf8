 IFS officer faces quiz

 New Delhi, April 2: Senior bureaucrat Rakesh Kumar, accused in a human trafficking case, will return home early from Brazil to face CBI sleuths, bureau sources said today, reports our special correspondent.

 The IFS officer appeared headed for more trouble after the sources said investigators had found Rs 4 lakh in cash besides property documents at his Delhi residence.

 The CBI has already registered a case against Kumar for allegedly trafficking people to Germany when he was director-general of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. 

 The bureau, while probing the case of nine missing artistes of a Punjabi cultural troupe while on a tour of Germany last September, had come across leads that directed it to Kumar. 

 A PTI report said six of the nine have been traced in Berlin and are being deported.

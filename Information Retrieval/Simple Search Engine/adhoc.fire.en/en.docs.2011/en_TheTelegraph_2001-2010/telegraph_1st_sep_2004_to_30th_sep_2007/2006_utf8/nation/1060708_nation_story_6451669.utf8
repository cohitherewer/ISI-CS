 Dawood

 New Delhi, July 7 (PTI): The CBI today said it has supplied all addresses of gangster Dawood Ibrahim in Pakistan to Interpol.

 We have given complete proof about his entire network in Pakistan to Interpol and Interpol believes us, CBI director Vijay Shanker said after his meeting with home minister Shivraj Patil.

 The CBI directors comments come close on the heels of Pakistan approaching the world police body and claiming that Dawood was not hiding in its territory. Pakistan had also asked Interpol to strike out Karachi as his address in a notice issued for Dawood.

 High life to deaths door in a night

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New 

 Delhi, June 2: As the police try to unveil the 

 mystery behind Rahul Mahajans sudden illness and Bibek 

 Moitras death, the chain of events that took place 

 at 7, Safdarjung Road late last night is likely to prove 

 critical.

 Ganesh and Anil, Rahuls servants, have told police that after spending most of the day at home, Rahul sat to have a glass of champagne with Bibek around 8.45 pm.

 Bibek then spoke to some people on the phone and told the servants that he was expecting friends.

 At 10.45, four persons arrived, one of whom left almost immediately. They were obviously not close to Rahul as Bibek was heard directing them to the house. Bibek went to meet them at the gate.

 The party that followed continued uninterrupted till around 12.30 am when two of the three visitors left. They returned 45 minutes later to pick up their third friend and then left together.

 At 2.15 am, Ganesh heard Rahuls feeble voice crying for help. He followed it to the room where the party was held. 

 A barely conscious Rahul told Ganesh he wasnt feeling well. Bibek was lying unconscious on the sofa, frothing at the mouth.

 A frightened Ganesh quickly called Anil, and the two of them tried to revive Bibek and Rahul by splashing water on their faces. 

 When it did not work, they called up Sudhanshu Mittal, a close business associate and friend of Pramod Mahajan.

 Mittal told the servants to take the two to Apollo Hospital. Harish, Rahuls driver, took them to the hospital at 2.55 am. 

 Mittal was waiting there with a team of doctors, who declared Bibek dead on arrival and said Rahuls condition was critical.

 Rahul Mahajans heartbeat was hardly detectable when he was brought here, and his blood sugar was very high, a spokesperson at Apollo Hospital said. 

 The doctors asked Mittal if he was aware of any substance the two had consumed. Mittal told Harish to go back and get whatever edible stuff was in the room where the party had taken place. Harish returned with a polythene bag containing a white powder that the doctors could not identify.

 At 5 am, the hospital authorities informed police, who took possession of the polythene bag and sent a team to 7, Safdarjung Road, where they found traces of vomit and two half-empty bottles of champagne.

 Gopinath Munde, Pramods brother-in-law, arrived at the hospital at 9.45 am. The whole family is worried about Rahul. Coming so soon after Pramodji..., he stuttered. 

 Bibek was like a member of my own family. Both the Mahajan and Munde families are very upset about what happened, he added, after being calmed by his aides.

 This sequence of events was given by the servants and does not match the version of the three men who surrendered.

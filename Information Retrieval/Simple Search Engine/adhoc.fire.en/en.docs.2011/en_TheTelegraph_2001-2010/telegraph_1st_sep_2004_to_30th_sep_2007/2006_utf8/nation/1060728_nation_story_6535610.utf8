The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Blast verdict, 13 years on

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 27: It has taken 13 long years but on August 10, the judgment will finally be delivered in Indias largest court case involving its biggest terror attack, featuring film stars, mafia dons, 650 witnesses and 25,000 pages of documents.

 A single day will not be enough to pass verdicts on the 123 Bombay blasts accused, of whom 119 will be in court ? including Bollywood hunk Sanjay Dutt, facing anything between a five-year term and life imprisonment if convicted.

 The special court, set up under the now-repealed anti-terror law Tada, would merely commence delivery of judgment from August 10 with the sentencing probably continuing for several days, judge Pramod Kode said.

 Thirteen explosions, quickly following one another, had killed 257 people and injured 713 in Mumbai on March 12, 1993. The climax of the long-drawn case will come a month after serial train explosions nearly matched that toll on July 11.

 If Dutt will be raising the glamour quotient among those in the dock, the list of the missing accused is perhaps more impressive. It includes three on Indias most wanted list: underworld don Dawood Ibrahim ? believed to have ordered the blasts ? his brother Anees Ibrahim and Tiger Memon.

 The trial was completed in 2003, but it took another two years to deal with legal clarifications before Kode could begin dictating his final judgment. The extradition of gangster Abu Salem in November 2005 raised fears that he might be tried with the original 123 accused, further delaying the verdict.

 In June, Kode ordered a separate trial for Salem. Legal sources said the judge would reserve the judgment on the absconders. If arrested and extradited, their trial would be clubbed with Salems.

 Dutt, one of the 33 out on bail, was charged with possessing an AK-56 rifle and later destroying it with the help of his friends. He confessed and retracted, and the witnesses in his case turned hostile.

 Today, the accused began to whisper among themselves with excitement as soon as Kode announced the date for the verdict. They were relieved that after all these years, something will happen in this case. Good or bad, they will at least know their fate, said defence lawyer Farhana Shah, who appeared for 80 accused including Dutt.

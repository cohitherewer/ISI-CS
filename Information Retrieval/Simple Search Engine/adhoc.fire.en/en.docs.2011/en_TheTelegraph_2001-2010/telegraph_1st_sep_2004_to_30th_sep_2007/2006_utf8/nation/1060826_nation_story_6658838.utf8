 Wazwan back on Valley plates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Aug. 25: Wazwan, the traditional Kashmiri feast, and the multitude of guests are back in the Valley with the high court staying the state governments move to curb extravagant weddings.

 Weddings in Kashmir daylight affairs for the last 18 years since militancy erupted are held at night now that security has been relaxed.

 At an average marriage ceremony, between 500 and 700 kg of mutton is consumed while for an elite one it is around 1,000 to 1,500 kg. The mutton is used in the elaborate Wazwan spread over 25 to 35 courses.

 Not only has full-scale Wazwan made a comeback, the number of guests, which the government wanted to restrict, has also become a no-holds-barred affair. The guests, on an average, number between 500 and 1,000.

 The rich and the upper middle-class are apparently relieved that the government move has hit a roadblock. But the poor and the middle-class are not so happy.

 It is our misfortune that the move has failed. It has brought us under pressure to spend heavily on marriages, which we cannot afford. But we have been left with no choice as less expenditure brings a stigma that could stay with us forever, said Manzoor Ahmad, a school teacher.

 It (the curb) was a great relief which couldnt turn into a reality because of the affluent minority, he added.

 However, a Srinagar businessman said: A marriage is an occasion to celebrate and one must be liberal about it. It is also an occasion to flaunt ones financial status. Why should anybody wink? Those who can afford should go ahead and those who cannot, let them not do it. 

 With curbs stayed, the gaiety and the traditional splendour of the marriage ceremonies are back in full force.

 The paramilitary troops are also lenient towards these parties and let the people indulge in the celebration.

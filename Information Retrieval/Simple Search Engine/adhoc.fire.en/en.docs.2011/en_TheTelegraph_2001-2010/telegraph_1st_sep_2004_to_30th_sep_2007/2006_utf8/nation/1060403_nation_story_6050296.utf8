 CT scan damages 

 New Delhi, April 2 (PTI): A consumer court has asked a hospital here to pay Rs 55,000 as compensation to a man after a defunct CT scan machine allegedly led to the death of his wife.

 H.C. Makkar had lodged a complaint with the state consumer disputes redressal commission, saying his wife succumbed to a paralytic stroke due to delay in treatment, triggered by the faulty machine.

 The panel today said: There was administrative deficiency on the part of St Stephen Hospital in not keeping the CT scan machine in order, knowing it well that any patient who suffers stroke may land up in the hospital and if time is wasted in sending the patient to some other hospital, it may affect him/her adversely.

 Makkar, in his complaint, said his wife Shanta Rani suffered a massive stroke in May 2000 and had to be taken to Tirath Ram Hospital for a CT scan and then to Apollo Hospital for surgery as the facilities were unavailable at St Stephen. 

 He had sought Rs 20 lakh as compensation.

 The consumer panel observed that if no one was available to do the surgery and the machine was not working, the hospital shouldnt have wasted even a minute to refer her to another hospital.

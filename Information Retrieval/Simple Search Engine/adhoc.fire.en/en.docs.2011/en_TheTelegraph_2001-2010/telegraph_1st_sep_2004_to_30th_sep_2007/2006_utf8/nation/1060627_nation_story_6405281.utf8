 Gun licence blow to Salman

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jodhpur/Mumbai, June 26: A Jodhpur court issued a showcause notice to Salman Khan for allegedly misleading it regarding the licence of the gun he used in poaching, and asked him to file a reply on July 10.

 Judicial magistrate Dalpat Singh Rajpurohit issued the notice after the prosecution filed an application alleging that Salman had misled the court by stating in an affidavit that he had misplaced his licence whereas it was retained by Mumbai police.

 According to the prosecution, before filing the affidavit in September 2003, the actor had lodged an FIR on August 8, 2003, at the Bandra police station, stating that his gun licence had been misplaced.

 But, the prosecution said, Salman had actually got it renewed till December 12, 2002, in September 2001. Mumbai police had retained it on technical grounds.

 On June 17, 2006, the court, on the prosecutions request, asked Mumbai polices gun licensing authorities to produce documents related to the licence. Vijay Narayan Pandit, an official of the gun licensing department in Mumbai, showed the original copy of the licence in the court. 

 The prosecution filed an application today, alleging that Salman had intentionally misled the court.

 It also filed an application to amend the charges of illegal possession of weapons against Salman to include the two-month period before October 1-2, 1998, the dates when Salman allegedly shot dead black bucks at Kankani. The case will be heard again on July 3.

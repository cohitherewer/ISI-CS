 Prompt verdict wins praise

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 3: Justice came fast, before the public had lost interest or witnesses had time to turn hostile.

 To rights and womens activists, that was the best thing about the Marine Drive rape trial. But they arent ready to compare it with the tardy Jessica Lal trial, marked by hostile witnesses and a mass acquittal, saying the circumstances were different.

 When trials conclude faster, the witnesses are able to recall the events correctly, and the public pressure for justice on the judicial system also remains intact, said Mihir Desai, human rights lawyer.

 In cases of crimes against women, witnesses turn hostile not because of external factors but purely because of delayed trials, agreed womens rights lawyer Veena Gowda.

 The victims themselves often turn hostile because they dont want the trauma to be prolonged and want to move on in life. As with the rape of a German tourist in Rajasthan, speedier trials will not only bring justice but also ensure women come forward to report cases of sexual offence.

 But Gowda cautioned against reading too much in the quick completion of the case. The accused was a policeman. There were several witnesses, and after the intense public and media glare, there was no way More would not have been convicted, she said.

 The accused was in jail and could not have influenced the witnesses. The system seems to work better when the accused is not influential, unlike the Jessica Lal case, which fell apart.

 She was happy with the sentence: The minimum punishment for rape is 10 years and the maximum is life imprisonment. So 12 years is not too bad.

 Desai suggested that one important feature of the trial was that it was held in-camera. The identity of the victim was kept under wraps... this has played a positive role.

 On the afternoon of April 21, constable Sunil More (since sacked) had raped a college girl inside a police post on the Marine Drive waterfront, provoking national outrage.

 The police had acted fast, sacking More and filing the chargesheet quickly. Bombay High Court set an April 30 deadline but the trial court beat it by almost four weeks.

 But Haseen Khan, a womens rights activist from Awaaz-e-Niswan, isnt entirely convinced by the polices efforts.

 Its a positive judgment, she agreed, but even after the Marine Drive rape, police atrocities on women continued. Sexual offences were registered against policemen at Sahar and Navi Mumbai police stations.

 What have the police done to ensure this does not happen? We had demanded a sexual harassment policy in the police, but it is yet to be implemented.

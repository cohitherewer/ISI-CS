 Rs 75000 for Deccan delay

 Air Deccan: Damages rap

 New Delhi, Dec. 28 (PTI): Air Deccan has been asked to pay Rs 75,000 as compensation to two families who were stranded at Delhi airport when their flight was delayed because of a technical snag two years ago.

 The Delhi consumer disputes redressal commission headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor rejected the private airlines plea that technical problems were not in its control.

 If the contention of Air Deccan is accepted, then every service provider will make one excuse or the other, Kapoor said, dismissing two appeals filed by Air Deccan against the orders of a district consumer forum. 

 Such an insensitive or casual or indifferent attitude shall always leave the consumer high and dry and (he/she will) suffer immensely, he added.

 The commission accused the low-cost airline of deficiency in service for keeping consumers waiting for hours together without any valid reason or any direct proof of a technical problem that was beyond its control.

 Upholding the consumer forums verdicts, the com- mission awarded Gurpreet Singh and Rakesh Kwatra and their family members a consolidated compensation of Rs 75,000. 

 Singh said he, along with his wife and two minor children, had booked tickets for a Delhi-Bangalore Air Deccan flight on December 5, 2004.

 At the airport, he was informed that his flight would be seven hours late because of a technical snag, throwing all his plans haywire, his complaint added.

 Kwatra and his family, too, had to wait for over seven hours to board a Chennai-bound flight.

 Some days ago, the commission had held that airlines operating from Delhi would have to pay a compensation of Rs 10,000 each to domestic travellers and Rs 20,000 each to passengers of international flights if delays exceeded two hours.

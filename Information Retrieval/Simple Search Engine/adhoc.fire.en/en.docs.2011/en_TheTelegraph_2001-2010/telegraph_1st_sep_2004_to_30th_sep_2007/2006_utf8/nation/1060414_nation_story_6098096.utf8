 Shame salvo at Saran

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 13: Two officers of the Indian Foreign Services 1972 batch have become a cause of major embarrassment for the ministry of external affairs.

 If special secretary (economic relations) Rakesh Kumar is wanted by the CBI in a human trafficking case, his batch-mate Harish Kumar Dogra has sent a stinker to foreign secretary Shyam Saran after being recalled as high commissioner in New Zealand.

 Dogra not only decided to stay back, defying his recall order, he also wrote to Saran, accusing him of bringing shame on the country. The contents of the letter appeared in newspapers in Wellington, embarrassing the Indian government and the community.

 A stunned ministry today reacted angrily, saying circulating such material is not becoming of a senior member of the foreign service. 

 The ministry will deal with the matter in accordance with its well-established procedures, said a foreign ministry spokesperson, warning stern action.

 Dogra was given marching orders last month and asked to report to South Block within two weeks following complaints that he refused visas to some Indians in New Zealand for travel to the country. It has been over a month and Dogra is staying put in Wellington.

 Dogra alleged that his recall order was ill-advised and illegal and demanded that the foreign secretary resign. What have I been charged with, why am I being hanged without even being given an opportunity to be heard? the newspapers quoted from Dogras letter.

 The senior IFS officer is also angry that the government was using the media to launch a slanderous campaign against him.

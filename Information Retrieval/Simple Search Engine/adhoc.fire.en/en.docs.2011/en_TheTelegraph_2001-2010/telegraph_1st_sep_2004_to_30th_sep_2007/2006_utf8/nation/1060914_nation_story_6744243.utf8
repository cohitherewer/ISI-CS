 Parents vent molest fury

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 13: Parents pounced on the head of a Hisar school and blackened his face after students were allegedly sexually abused on the premises.

 Joined by other Hisar residents, parents of the students yesterday also beat up teachers who came to the rescue of Rishi Gautam Vishwas, who heads the Vishwas Senior Secondary School.

 Manager Rishi Sagar, accused of exploiting girl students, has been arrested and a case registered against him at the Civil Lines police station. A police officer said Sagar has admitted his guilt.

 Three others Rishi Gautam Vishwas, Rishi Piyush Vishwas and Rishi Pushap Vishwas who were detained for interrogation, have been released.

 Students of various colleges and parents of the alleged victims took to the streets demanding severe punishment for the culprit. They damaged school property and stoned buses. Police had to resort to a lathi-charge to disperse demonstrators blocking the Delhi-Hisar highway. 

 The matter came to light after a parent overheard a conversation between his daughter, a student of Class VI, and a friend, the police said. 

 Hisar deputy commissioner Fateh Singh Dagar said Sagar was produced in additional chief judicial magistrate Sukrampals court and remanded in police custody for two days. 

 We want to investigate the matter thoroughly. We would also like to know for how many months or years the girls were being molested and whether they were also being sexually exploited in the school, he said.

 The police have termed the account of the affected girls heart-rending. 

 They did not know what was happening to them.

 A police officer said Sagar used to threaten the girls with expulsion from the school if they disobeyed. 

 The school staff, including principal Maya Mishra, have resigned, owning moral responsibility. 

 We have nothing much to say. We want a thorough probe into the matter. Those responsible must get severe punishment, she said.

 Arshinder Singh Chawla, the Hisar superintendent of police, said the guilty would not be spared and urged the students and the parents to maintain calm. 

 I want their cooperation in maintaining law and order, he added.

 The administration has clamped Section 144 in the district after parents, residents and BJP, INLD and SFI supporters went on the rampage today. 

 They have demanded registration of rape charges against Sagar.

 Quota becomes political football

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: The BJP slammed the cops. The Rashtriya Janata Dal screamed kamandal. And Arjun Singh hinted at the Oppositions real intentions.

 Political parties today used the quota controversy to settle scores with each other. They clashed and quibbled during a discussion in the Lok Sabha while outside the storm raged over the governments move to reserve 27 per cent seats for Other Backward Classes in educational institutions, including IIMs and IITs.

 But as the topic is sensitive, the BJP, rather than take a direct approach, began with the brutal police lathi-charge on protesting doctors.

 For the main Opposition party, which sends a sizeable number of OBC MPs to Parliament, the indirect approach seemed the best option, as it is keen to break out of the confines of its upper-caste identity.

 Last December, it had voted in favour of the 93rd Constitutional Amendment Act, which proposes education quotas for OBCs.

 There has been a brutal lathi-charge on the protesting doctors, began BJP deputy leader V.K. Malhotra when he rose to speak during a calling attention motion on reservation for OBCs.

 Before he could proceed further, RJD members were on their feet. They accused the BJP of being an upper-caste party which has traditionally been against reservation for OBCs.

 Remember Mandal vs kamandal, they screamed, recalling the nineties when the BJP unleashed the Ramjanmabhoomi movement to counter V.P. Singhs Mandal mobilisation.

 By the time the noise died down, Malhotra had changed tack.

 I would like to know what is the governments stand and what is Sonia Gandhis stand, he said. Did Kapil Sibal ? a Union cabinet minister ? speak out against it? Has the Knowledge Commission voted 6-2 against the quota proposal?

 Arjun then said: Forget the speculation that this government is divided on the issue. The delay in bringing the bill is because of the Assembly polls.

 Economic quota call

 The CPM has demanded introduction of the creamy layer concept in quota for OBCs in higher education to ensure that the benefits reach the needy. The party also favoured reservation for the economically weak section among forward castes.

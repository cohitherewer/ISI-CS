 Feud whiff in attack on mosque

 OUR BUREAU

 New 

 Delhi, April 14: Those who mixed a cocktail of common 

 laboratory chemicals and placed them in two packets near 

 the water tank at Jama Masjid wanted only to cause a scare 

 and not hurt anyone, police believe.

 Potassium chlorate, sulphur and sulphuric acid stirred together and packed with nuts and bolts can only set off a weak blast, an officer said.

 Though security agencies are ready with several theories to explain the motive ? including symbolic revenge by Hindu zealots and a terrorist effort to whip up communal strife ? the strongest suspicion relates to Shahi Imams rivals looking to gain control of the mosque.

 It could be an attempt to malign the Shahi Imam and loosen his grip over the mosque, an Intelligence Bureau source suggested.

 If any of these theories are true, the plotters would have been disappointed. Delhi stayed calm and the Shahi Imam earned praise from Union home minister Shivraj Patil for his appeals for calm after the blasts.

 Though the explosions had little direct impact, the second could have sparked a stampede. After the first blast, the people inside the mosque were already tense when the second packet of explosives was discovered.

 Suddenly, we saw another packet lying close to the place where the first blast happened. We were told that it might also blow off and within minutes, there was a second blast. After the second one, everyone started running around, said Muzaffar Khan, the brother of one of the victims.

 It was mosque staff who took the victims to hospital. When police and the bomb disposal squad arrived to search for more bombs, the premises were cordoned off for nearly an hour and traffic restricted on all roads leading to the mosque.

 The huge crowd in front of the mosque had turned angry as it was not being allowed to enter the premises. When Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul arrived, the crowd wouldnt allow him to enter and he had to use the back gate.

 As the bomb squad searched the spot, the police commissioner and the Shahi Imam appealed to the people to leave the premises.

 After an hour of searching, the police left. Immediately, crowds started going in for the days fourth set of prayers.

 Union minister Kapil Sibal, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and several other ministers visited the victims in hospital. The Delhi government announced Rs 50,000 to each injured.

 Home ministry sources said intelligence agencies had spoken of possible blasts in mid-April, with several festivals like Good Friday and Id-Milad and Mahavir Jayanti almost coinciding, but did not specify locations.

 Digital troops set for action

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The army is set to redeploy its digital soldiers, the one-lakh-strong Corps of Signals, after the force today commissioned its communication network called Mercury Thunder that links frontline formations with headquarters.

 The Rs 400-crore Mercury Thunder project will enable beaming live pictures of action from mobile units that will link to the Army Static Switched Communication Network (ASCON).

 Although this is not admitted, the network is also capable of acquiring live pictures beamed by pilotless spy planes with enough clarity for generals sitting in command-and-control centres far away from the scene of action to decide operations. Already, soldiers in isolated frontline pickets such as on the Siachen Glacier can communicate with their families.

 An army commanders conference next month will consider proposals to restructure the Signals Corps because the digitised communication network that is the responsibility of the specialised branch will not require them to be deployed with tactical units on frontlines. 

 The network that operates at three levels with optical fibre cable, microwave radio and a satellite overlay will obviate the need for Signal Corps officers and troops to accompany frontline infantry units to lay thousands of miles of wire in inhospitable terrain.

 The Signals Corps that is headquartered in Delhi usually deploys its troops along with infantry units but the new technology that has been adopted demands the creation of area commands. We have gone digital and we are now a network-enabled army, said the Signals officer in command, Lt General Davinder Kumar shortly after defence minister Pranab Mukherjee launched Mercury Thunder.

 Kumar said the conversion of the armys exclusive and secure network from a voice-based communication link to a broadband network was like converting a two-way road into an expressway. The network now has 10,000 channels in place of the 120 it was working with. Images would be beamed real-time from sensor to shooter.

 Earlier, at a programme to launch Mercury Thunder, the army chief, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, said the project would revolutionise communications in the force. He said army headquarters envisaged a force that would move from being network-enabled to network-centric within a time frame. It is expected to be concluded by 2012.

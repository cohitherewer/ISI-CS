 Mass death in river after pause for dam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Aug. 29: Wedding guests who stopped by to soak in the majestic sight of water roaring out of the Almatti dam barely drove off in a maxicab when tragedy struck, plunging the vehicle into the overflowing Krishna river.

 Trapped inside the vehicle, at least 26 people, including five children, died. Six managed to swim ashore.

 The accident occurred in Bijapur district, 400 km from Bangalore, when the maxicab driver, Nagaraj, swerved to avoid a two-wheeler rider and lost control. Police said the vehicle smashed through the safety barrier and tumbled into the river.

 Police said the group was returning home after attending a wedding. Only five bodies could be found till the evening.

 The six could escape because they were riding on the footboard of the packed vehicle.

 Maxicabs, a popular mode of public transport in north Karnataka, are normally overcrowded and driven rashly. They are jeep-like vehicles, but much broader and can seat at least 15. While a flimsy tarpaulin cover keeps the elements out, it is open on all sides and has no door.

 Police said all the dead and injured belong to Bagsiband village in the neighbouring Koppal district.

 Last week, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had dedicated the Almatti dam to the nation.

 The bridge where the accident occurred is on NH 13. Though irrigation department officials closed the dam gates after the accident, the water level had not receded enough for police to winch up the vehicle. At the spot, locals assembled on the bridge to watch the rescue efforts. 

 Officials said over 15,000 cusecs of water had been let out from the dam in the last 12 hours and indicated that as the river was in full spate due to the weeklong rains, the dam gates cannot remain closed for long.

 When dam gates are opened, it is common for people to stand by and watch from a distance.

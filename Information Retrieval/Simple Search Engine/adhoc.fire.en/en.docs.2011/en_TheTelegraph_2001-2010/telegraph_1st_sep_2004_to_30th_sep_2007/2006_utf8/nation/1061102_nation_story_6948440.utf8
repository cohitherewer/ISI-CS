 Udaipur, Nov. 1 (PTI): 

 Five teachers of a school, including the principal and vice-principal, 

 were today dismissed from service by the institutions 

 management for allegedly giving a mass haircut to students. 

 About 50 students of classes VII to XII of Udaipurs Guru Nanak Senior Secondary School were seen sporting long hair during the school assembly yesterday.

 They had not cut their hair despite being asked to do so and were given a haircut, sources said.

 Vice-principal Indubala Khosla and two other teachers were arrested yesterday after Devesh Sahu, a Class VIII student, filed an FIR. They were released on bail late last night, superintendent of police Dinesh M.N. said. 

 Principal Godawari Purohit, Khosla and three others Firdos Pathan, Dheeraj Chajer and Maheshwari Kaushik were dismissed after infuriated parents and students complained about the forced haircut, school management committee secretary G.S. Bedi said. 

 Hundreds of students this morning demonstrated outside the school gate, expressing solidarity with the teachers and demanding that they be reinstated as they had acted to maintain discipline. 

 The parents of the students who were given the haircut, however, condemned the action, calling it arbitrary and saying that the administration should have informed them to avoid embarrassment and humiliation of their children. 

 The district administration has instituted a six-member committee, headed by city magistrate B.S. Panwar, to probe the incident. 

 Rajasthan education minister G.S. Tiwari said the deputy director of education, too, would join the committee.

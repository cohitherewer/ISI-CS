 $160000 Nizam slippers found

 Toronto (PTI): A pair of diamond and emerald encrusted slippers worn by the Nizam of Hyderabad in the 1790s has been found in a plastic bag near the place from where they had been stolen in January.

 Two other stolen artefacts ? an 18th century gold toe ring set with stones worth $11,000 and a jewel encrusted anklet whose estimated value was $45,000 were also found, police said

 The regal shoes, valued at $160,000 by Bata Shoe Museum, were found at a church after an anonymous phone call told a staff member where to find them, the police added.

 A man was reportedly arrested on Friday after the police published some photos of people allegedly involved in the theft.

 Museum conservator Ada Hopkins has examined the shoes carefully and believes no damage has been done to them, though there is evidence the shoes have been worn, a Canadian Press Agency report said.

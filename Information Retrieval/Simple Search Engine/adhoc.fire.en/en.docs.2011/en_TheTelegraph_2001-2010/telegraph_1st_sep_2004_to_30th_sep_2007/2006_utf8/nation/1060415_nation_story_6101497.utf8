The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Loss of face and crores

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, 

 April 14: The two-day shutdown would have cost 

 Bangalores IT and ITES industries at least $160 million 

 (Rs 715 crore), but the technology hub was more worried 

 about the loss of face.

 The software firms alone may have lost around $40 million, going by figures that Infosys chief financial officer T.V. Mohandas Pai gave.

 At the Q4 results of the IT bellwether, Pai said his company lost $4 million yesterday when it decided to stay shut after mobs mourning for Kannada icon Rajkumar forced the city to a standstill on Wednesday.

 Yet it isnt the financial loss but the harm to Brand Bangalore that is a bigger concern, said Ananth Koppar, president of the Bangalore Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The issue is not of losing productivity but of the image of the city when the global attention is on Bangalore.

 Most companies were today calculating their losses and figuring out how to make up for lost time.

 The fledgling knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) industry, the latest on the BPO block, was the hardest hit with online tuitions going offline for the period.

 Among big global companies that have set up shop here are Microsoft, GE, IBM, Dell and Intel apart from homegrown biggies such as Infosys, Wipro, Accenture and MphasiS. All these companies are dependent on cabs and buses to transport their 5 lakh-plus workforce.

 We will make up by working one extra day, said Pai, whose companys Bangalore units contribute nearly half of its total revenues of $2.1 billion (Rs 9,400 crore).

 Some senior staff did manage to work from home. They are used to it as they work in different time zones, an Intel source said.

 The BPOs had very little time to transfer client calls to other cities. Some shifts were stretched to the maximum. The employees were cooperative with some volunteering to come to office on their own, a Dell executive said.

 CPM in oil protest

 Calcutta, May 28: The CPM will launch a nationwide movement against the Centres proposed oil price increase and will try to persuade other political parties to join it, reports our special correspondent.

 After a two-day politburo meeting, general secretary Prakash Karat said: In the last two years, the government has increased the prices of petroleum products four times, citing a rise in international prices. We are not for a negotiated hike in oil prices and instead want the Centre not to effect any increase.

 As an alternative, he suggested that customs and excise duties be slashed, a long-standing CPM demand, though it never mentions the high sales tax rates states ruled by it, including Bengal, charge.

 The government refuses to review the taxation structure and this has imposed a big burden on consumers. Without reduction of the tax burden, any attempt to raise prices will be strongly resisted. For this, all democratic and secular parties will be contacted, he said.

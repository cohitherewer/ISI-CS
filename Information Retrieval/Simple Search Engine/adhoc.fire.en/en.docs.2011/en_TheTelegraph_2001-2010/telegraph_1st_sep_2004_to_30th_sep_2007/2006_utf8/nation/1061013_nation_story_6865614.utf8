 Easier entry for Chinese

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: The home ministry has modified the visa guidelines for Chinese nationals. 

 The move comes after the October 9 meeting between Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani and home secretary V.K. Duggal.

 Ambani is believed to have sought quick security and visa clearances for 1,800 Chinese professionals who are to work on the firms gas pipeline from the Krishna-Godavari basin.

 China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Corporation will build the 1,400-km pipeline in a Rs 17,500-crore project to be completed by 2009.

 Besides letting in a large number of Chinese, the new rules extend the relatively short validity of employment and business visas. 

 Things have been expedited due to a special emphasis on Indias energy requirements. It took around three months to process visa applications earlier. It will be two weeks now, the home ministry said.

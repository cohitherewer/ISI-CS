 BJP Big Two back Jaswant

 OUR BUREAU

 Vajpayee

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: With Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani throwing their weight behind Jaswant Singh, the threat of a privilege motion is unlikely to dislodge him from the post of leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.

 There is no discussion at any level about it (Jaswants removal). It is not being discussed, spokesperson V.K. Malhotra said today.

 Yesterday, he had been less certain. There is no immediate move. But I cannot predict what is going to happen tomorrow, he had said.

 As Jaswant came under fire from the ruling alliance in the Lok Sabha, with RJD leader Devendra Yadav demanding an apology over the mole controversy, the BJP launched a counter-offensive against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Brushing aside questions on the mole, the partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, asked Manmohan if he had opposed the nuclear tests as finance minister in P.V. Narasimha Raos team.

 The PM has not answered the question about whether he opposed the tests as finance minister in 1993 on the grounds that the US would impose economic sanctions on India, Malhotra said.

 While the RSS would want the former foreign minister to disclose the name of the mole, it has not pushed for Jaswants ouster so far. The two top BJP leaders Vajpayee and Advani have made it clear they would not hear of his ouster, at least not yet.

 The privilege notice against Jaswant came after a letter he had presented in Parliament as proof that there was a mole in Raos PMO was disowned by the former US ambassador, Harry Barnes, to whom it was attributed.

 Today, Yadav demanded an apology to the nation from Jaswant who, he said, had behaved in an irresponsible manner by creating an atmosphere of suspicion.

 A Congress MP, Madhusudan Mistry, demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee inquiry into allegations that ransom was paid to end the Kandahar hijack. Jaswant was the finance minister then.

 But the BJPs priority now is not so much to act against Jaswant as to cause trouble between the Congress and the Left on the nuclear deal. Party leaders have been holding talks with the Left over the week. 

 Now that the CPI has come out against any joint resolution, the BJPs focus is on embarrassing the ruling alliance by introducing a resolution on its own.

 Even otherwise, the equations within the party do not point to any immediate step towards Jaswants removal. 

 In the upper House, his ouster would mean Murli Manohar Joshi laying claim to the post. The fear of such an eventuality would keep Advani firmly on Jaswants side. 

 Vajpayee has, as usual, kept his views to himself but is widely believed to be against any immediate move to replace the Rajya Sabha leader.

 The mole controversy appears to have stopped short of acquiring the dimensions of the Jinnah row that cost L. K. Advani the party presidents post last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Body to manage museums

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The culture ministry is discussing the possibility of setting up an authority to help manage the countrys museums.

 Tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni is understood to have favoured the establishment of an autonomous body exclusively meant for the development and management of museums. 

 If the idea is implemented, the authority would keep tabs on museums of all kinds, not just those showcasing culture. This means not only those museums that deal with art, antiquities or anthropology but also the ones on science and technology would come under its purview. 

 The proposed bodys turf could include the National Rail Museum in Delhi as well as the Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad.

 The authority, however, may not have direct control over the day-to-day running of the museums. Even now the pattern of administration in museums varies.

 The Salar Jung Museum is run by an autonomous board of trustees headed by the Andhra Pradesh governor. But the National Rail Museum has the status of subordinate office, directly under the department of culture.

 When the authority comes into being, it will have to consider the role of bodies such as the National Council of Science Museums. At present, the council administers 26 science centres and museums ranging from the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in Calcutta to small district-level science centres.

 That the museums need a helping hand to run themselves better is clear from the 2005 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.

 The CAG slammed three Calcutta institutions the Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial Hall and the Asiatic Society on several counts, as they lacked synergy between them, their security was inadequate and some of the money they spent on acquisitions didnt make sense.

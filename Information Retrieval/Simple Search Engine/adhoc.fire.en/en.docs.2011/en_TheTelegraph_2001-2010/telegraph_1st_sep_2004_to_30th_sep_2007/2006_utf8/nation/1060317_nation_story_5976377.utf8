 Suicide finger points at bank

 New Delhi, March 16 (PTI): Delhi High Court has issued notices to the city police commissioner and the station house officer of Srinivaspuri on a petition filed by a woman whose son committed suicide allegedly because of harassment by ICICI Bank for loan recovery.

 Justice R.C. Jain asked the two officials to file their replies and a status report on the incident and posted it for hearing on March 30. The investigating officer was also asked to be present for the hearing.

 Shanti Devi Sharma has complained that her son Himanshu committed suicide in October 2005 after repeated harassment allegedly by hooligans hired by the bank to recover defaulted loan instalments.

 According to Surat Singh, the petitioners counsel, Himanshu had taken a loan of Rs 37,000 in June 2005 to buy a motorcycle. The loan was to be paid in 36 instalments. But due to financial difficulties, he could not pay two of them. 

 The petition said the bank sent hired criminals who took away the motorcycle after abusing Himanshu and his wife. Although Himanshu offered to pay the arrears, the bank insisted that he pay Rs 44,000 to get back the bike.

 Shanti Devi also complained that after initial reluctance, Srinivaspuri police registered an FIR and a case under section 306 of the IPC against the bank. But they took no action against the bank even four months after registration of the case despite it being a non-bailable offence.

 Mystery toxin gives early tests the slip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 2: Samples of blood and urine from Rahul Mahajan and the body tissues of Bibek Moitra hold the key to what has become a toxicological mystery which routine tests by doctors failed to solve.

 Apollo Hospital doctors said this evening that the cause of Mahajans condition could not be determined either through his symptoms or through standard tests carried out whenever a young patient is brought unconscious.

 When Mahajan was wheeled into the hospital, he was in a serious condition, unconscious, with low oxygen in his blood, and low blood pressure hallmarks of respiratory failure. 

 The first medical response in such cases is to stabilise the patient through drugs to correct the blood pressure, control the heart rate, and by delivering oxygen through a ventilator.

 In the late evening, doctors said, Mahajan was in an intensive care unit, his blood pressure and other vital signs stable, but still on a ventilator, a team of internal medicine specialists monitoring him.

 Doctors also drew blood and urine samples and sent them for routine liver and kidney function tests and toxicological screening. These preliminary tests were unable to establish the cause of his condition.

 In toxicological screening, doctors look for the residues of toxic substances that might have been consumed by the patient many hours ago. 

 A number of factors determine how fast you can identify the poison, said Yogendra Gupta, a professor of pharmacology in charge of the poison information centre at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, who is not connected with this case.

 We cant predict how fast a toxicological screen would produce an answer, Gupta said. In general, the more common a toxic substance and the more sophisticated a test design, the faster it is to identify the toxin.

 Conversely, the rarer a toxin, the longer would be the wait for a result.

 The discovery of an unidentified white powder and alcohol bottles at the Mahajan residence has fuelled speculation about whether Moitra and Mahajan had both suffered from the interaction of narcotics and alcohol.

 Central nervous system depression and resulting respiratory failure is a cardinal sign of some opioid drugs, said Gupta. 

 But there are also other substances that can lead to such conditions, he added.

 The inability of experienced narcotics experts to say what the white powder is several hours after they got it has also triggered speculation whether it might contain some new designer drug or an impure or highly toxic version of a drug.

 A senior psychiatrist said it is not surprising to find people combining narcotics with alcohol. 

 About half the cases we encounter abuse both alcohol and narcotics, said Puneet Dwevedi, a consultant psychiatrist in New Delhi.

 In an intoxicated state, people who abuse substances are unable to keep track of the intake of either a narcotic or alcohol, Dwevedi said. The toxic effect of a combination is worse than the toxic effect of just one substance.

 Plea on Lalu bills rejected

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Supreme Court today dismissed a public interest litigation seeking a probe into the alleged payment of Rs 21 lakh to a five-star hotel to settle the bills for the wedding of railway minister Lalu Prasads daughter.

 You treat this court as a police station. Go to the police station, a bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said, soon after the PIL by the Ashok Hotel Mazdoor Janta Union came up for hearing.

 With the court not inclined to entertain the matter, Advocate D.K. Garg, who appeared for the petitioners, sought permission to withdraw the petition. The court, thereafter, dismissed the petition as withdrawn. 

 The petitioners had sought a directive to the income-tax department to probe the transaction as the hotel authorities had not taken the PAN of the depositors. 

 According to the Income-Tax Act, it is mandatory to quote the PAN number for payment of any amount above Rs 25,000, the union said. 

 The hotel management was liable to pecuniary penalty for not following the rules, it added.

 The union alleged several rules were bypassed by the management of the ITDC hotel, a government undertaking, which hosted the wedding.

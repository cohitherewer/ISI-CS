 Prod to PM on foreign varsities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 8: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh (in picture) has urged the Prime Minister to expedite the foreign universities entry bill so that it can be passed in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning July 24.

 The cabinet at a meeting earlier this week had referred the Foreign Universities Entry and Operation (for the maintenance of quality and prevention of commercialisation) Bill, 2006, to a group of ministers (GOM) following differences of opinion among ministers.

 In his letter, Singh has said the absence of legal regulatory guidelines for foreign varsities functioning in India continues to be a matter of concern. Several institutions without proper academic credentials are setting up branches and providing poor quality education.

 The HRD minister has suggested that the GOM act fast so that the bill can be introduced and passed in the coming session of Parliament. But it may run into rough weather because of division of opinion.

 There is a section in the Congress that does not want foreign universities to follow any regulations. Such norms, they believe, will act as a deterrent for them to set up branches here.

 Some in the cabinet have recommended the setting up of a special education zone along the lines of a special economic zone to exempt foreign varsities from regulations.

 But the HRD ministry has a different view. It wants them to be given the same national treatment as Indian institutions.

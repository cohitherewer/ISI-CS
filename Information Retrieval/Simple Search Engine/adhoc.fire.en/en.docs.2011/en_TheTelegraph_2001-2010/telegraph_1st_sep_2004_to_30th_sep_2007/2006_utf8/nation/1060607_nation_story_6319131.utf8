 Bengals 34 brave poisoned paradise

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, June 6: Thirty-four Bengali tourists were on the Jammu-Srinagar highway when grenade blasts hit two buses full of visitors from the state last week, triggering frantic calls from home to drop their holiday and return.

 Our family members told us to abandon the journey and go back, said Monojit Chowdhary, deputy manager at the Burrabazar branch of United Bank of India. The cellphones started ringing as TV channels flashed news of the blasts in Srinagar.

 But the group chose to keep going on the 300-km highway and was on their way back home from Srinagar today, after visiting Gulmarg, Pahalgam and the golden meadows of Sonamarg as planned.

 It has been my dream to come and see the beauty of Kashmir, said Atindra Mohan Mukherjee, a teacher in Hooghly Mohsin College. But on our arrival here, we felt very unsafe. The paradise looked poisoned.

 Initially, the group did not dare venture out for sightseeing. When we reached Srinagar, we chose to remain inside the safety of our hotel rooms for a while. But then our children said that since we had come this far, what use was it to remain confined to our hotel rooms? That sounded logical and we decided to move about normally, said Pradip Ghosh, a visitor from Calcutta.

 Most of the tourists said encouragement from hotel staff and visits by police officials gave them the confidence to stay on.

 When they arrived here, their fellow citizens from Calcutta were being treated at various medical facilities in Srinagar. They were too frightened and preferred to stay indoors. But thank God, gradually with our support their confidence returned and they started moving out, a hotel employee said.

 The visitors returned happy today. Our stay in the Valley has been hassle-free. We found the local residents extremely cooperative and helpful. It has been a worthwhile experience for all of us, Ghosh said.

 Tour operators, grappling with cancellations after the blasts that have killed one person and fearing a reverse just as the industry appeared set for a boom, are hoping there will be more visitors like the 34 from Bengal.

 Thousands of people ? hotel or houseboat owners, taxi operators, handicraft-sellers ? in the state depend on tourism for a living. 

 Ours is not the only place where violence happens. Can anybody name a place of tourist attraction anywhere in the world which is hundred per cent safe? asked Abdul Salam Bhat, a houseboat owner.

 Dulal Kumar Nag, the tour operator who brought the group here, appeared satisfied. It was my last group of tourists to Kashmir till I come back with more in September. All my tourists have safely returned, he said.

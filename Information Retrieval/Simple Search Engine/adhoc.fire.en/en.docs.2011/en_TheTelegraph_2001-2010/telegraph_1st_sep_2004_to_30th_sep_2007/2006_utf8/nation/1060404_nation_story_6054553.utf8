 Jawan shoots down colleagues at CM house

 OUR BUREAU

 Jammu/Srinagar, April 3: Apparently denied leave, a jawan opened fire on his colleagues at the Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers official residence, killing three.

 Chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was going through files in the dining room when the bullets started flying. It was shocking, he told The Telegraph over phone from his heavily fortified residence in the winter capital.

 The CRPF soldier went berserk in the evening when his leave application was denied by an officer, the inspector-general of police (Jammu zone), S.P. Vaid, said.

 The trooper then started firing indiscriminately, killing his company commander and two head constables on the spot, Vaid added.

 The irate jawan, identified as Anand Kumar Singh, has been taken into custody and a case registered against him. He was overpowered by other CRPF jawans and has been arrested, a police officer said. 

 The incident, the first of its kind in the chief ministers residence, occurred around 7.30 pm.

 The chief minister was clearing files at his home as he had to leave on a three-day tour of Doda district tomorrow, where he is scheduled to file his nomination papers on April 5. Azad, who is not yet a legislator, is contesting the byelection from Bhaderwah Assembly constituency. He has to become an MLA before May 2, when he completes six months in office.

 When the firing broke out, the lights went off, adding to the panic. The official residences of most ministers and senior bureaucrats are located in the area. 

 The incident has jolted the entire security apparatus of the state and a revamp of the security set-up at the chief ministers residence has been ordered.

 Azad later spoke to Union home minister Shivraj Patil and requested him to look into the stress factor haunting troops in the region.

 Incidents like these have also occurred in the past in which those posted on security duty have shot colleagues and officers following altercations over refusal of leave.

 The officials have been attributing such panic reaction to continuous work under hostile circumstances, lack of recreational avenues and long separation from families.

 Various security agencies have now engaged counsellors and psychologists to combat stress among troops.

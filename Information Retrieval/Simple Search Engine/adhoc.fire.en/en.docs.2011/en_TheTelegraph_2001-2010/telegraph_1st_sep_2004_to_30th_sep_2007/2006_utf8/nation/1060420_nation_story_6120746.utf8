 Naxalites kill cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 19: Two policemen have died in a landmine blast triggered by Naxalites in a forest in northern Gadchiroli, on Maharashtras border with Chhattisgarh. 

 Around 8.30 last night, members of the special C-60 anti-Naxalite squad were on their way to a police outpost at Gatta in tribal-dominated Gadchiroli in an anti-mine vehicle when a powerful landmine exploded and sent the vehicle several feet up in the air. It landed upside down, injuring all 16 squad members. 

 Naxalites opened fire as constable Avendra Rasekar was trying to wriggle out of the vehicle, killing him on the spot. Three others suffered serious injuries and were taken to Government Medical College Hospital in Nagpur, where 48-year-old sub-inspector Harishchandra Madhavi died today. 

 Yes, we have lost two officers in the ambush. They were on their way to the police outpost under fire from Naxalite groups. The mission was to surround the firing groups and trap them. But before they could reach the outpost, the ambush was triggered. Because it was an anti-mine vehicle, the casualty has been lower, superintendent of police Shirish Jain said over phone from Gadchiroli. 

 Jain and other senior police officials rushed to the spot, which is 42 km from Gadchiroli town. 

 The police suspect that large quantities of gelatin were used in the explosion. It was a blast of dimensions similar to the one that was triggered last month. The explosion had tossed up the anti-mine vehicle, but it landed in upright position. In this case, the number of injuries were more because the vehicle overturned on landing, Jain added. 

 On March 13, 25 jawans of the special squad travelling in two anti-mine vehicles had survived a landmine blast near Pendhari forests. The explosion had flung one of the vehicles about 20 feet up in the air and created a crater more than five feet deep. After the explosion, the Naxalites had opened fire, but the police commandos countered the firing and forced them to flee. 

 Last year, more than 22 policemen were killed in Naxalite strikes in Maharashtra.

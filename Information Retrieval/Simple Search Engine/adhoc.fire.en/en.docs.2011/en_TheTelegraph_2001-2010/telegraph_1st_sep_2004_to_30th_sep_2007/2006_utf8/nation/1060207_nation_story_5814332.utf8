 Cooking gas whiff in deadly bus blast

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Morena (Madhya Pradesh) Feb. 6: Everybody was in a hurry to reach home fast to catch the slog overs of the India-Pakistan one-dayers.

 Then the explosion hit the private bus, killing at least 15 passengers.

 The bus, carrying 54 passengers, was in Kailaras in Morena district, around 350 km north of Bhopal, when the blast occurred.

 Police said the bus was plying between Morena and Sabalgarh, covering a distance of 70 km. 

 When the bus reached Kailaras, a small town along the state highway, it had covered one-third of the distance.

 Apparently, some passengers were carrying a cooking gas cylinder and a tin of inflammable chemical. Either the gas cylinder or the tin exploded, most probably because of a cigarette stub.

 Some passengers rushed to the door and a few tried to break the windows. But many were too stunned to react.

 By the time the fire brigade arrived ? almost two hours after the explosion ? at least 15 passengers had been charred to death. Unconfirmed reports put the toll between 18 and 20.

 The accident occurred outside a police station, which became the target of the angry survivors and a crowd that gathered around the burning bus.

 The crowd burnt down the police station and a municipal corporation building. The police eventually had to open fire in the air to disperse the crowd. 

 Passengers alleged inaction on the part of the fire brigade as well as the police in dousing the flames.

 By late evening, more police forces from neighbouring districts were rushed to Kailaras to control the situation.

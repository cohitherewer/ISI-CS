 Mumbai, March 27: Jagmohan Dalmiya was today moved around from room to room as Mumbai police questioned him on alleged siphoning of cricket board funds.

 The former Indian cricket boss flew in from Calcutta this morning to be interrogated with three former colleagues, all accused in an FIR of robbing the BCCI of Rs 21.74 lakh.

 Dalmiya reached the crime branch office at the Crawford Market police headquarters punctually at 11 am. Former board secretary S.K. Nair and former treasurers Kishore Rungta and Jyoti Bajpai joined him for the grilling by the economic offences wing.

 The questioning, by a three-member team led by inspector Sudhir Mahadik of unit-3, which deals with general cheating offences, began at 11.45 am and lasted till 5.35 pm.

 Dalmiyas aides, who waited in the compound, later complained he was not offered a proper lunch, and that they had to rush to a nearby Udipi eatery to pack a few vegetarian sandwiches.

 This is not the manner in which a man of Dalmiyas stature should be treated. They should at least be offered proper lunch, an aide said.

 But the police said Dalmiya was offered the rice plate and given the option of stepping out for lunch, but he didnt want to face the TV cameras outside.

 The four accused were questioned separately in a conference room on the first floor. After lunch, the other three stayed put but Dalmiya was seen shuttling between rooms.

 Around 5.35 pm, a pale-looking Dalmiya emerged and fought his way through a crowd of reporters and TV cameras to his silver Mercedes. The case is sub judice. I have been advised by my lawyers not to speak, he said.

 The economic offences wings head, additional commissioner K.L. Bishnoi, said: The four BCCI officials? were cooperating and answered whatever questions were put to them.

 The FIR, by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, alleges embezzlement from account no. 1223 at Indian Overseas Banks Bhowanipore branch in Calcutta. But it doesnt specifically mention 1996 World Cup organiser Pilcoms London account, operated jointly by Dalmiya and Pakistan board officials.

 Officers indicated that this account, too, could come under their scanner.

 Bombay High Court has directed the four accused to face police questioning on March 27, 28, 29 and 31 in Mumbai, and on April 3, 4 and 5 in Calcutta. On April 10, the court will hear their adjourned anticipatory bail plea.

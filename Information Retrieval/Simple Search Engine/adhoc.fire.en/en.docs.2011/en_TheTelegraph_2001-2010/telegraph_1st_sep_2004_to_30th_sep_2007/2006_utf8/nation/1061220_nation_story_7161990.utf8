New Delhi, Dec. 19: The arrest of three Manipuri Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives here this morning has confirmed suspicion that the Pakistan-based outfit has spread its reach to the Northeast.

 Salman Khurshid Kori, Abdur Rehman and Mohammad Akbar Hussain were planning blasts in Delhis markets, police said after arresting them near the Red Fort. Two kilograms of RDX, two detonators and a hand grenade were seized from them.

 The accused have told the police the Lashkar was trying to forge an alliance with the Manipur-based Peoples United Liberation Front, dominated by Pangals (Manipuri Muslims). Intelligence agencies had already warned that the Manipuri group was receiving help from Pakistani spy agency ISI.

 Although the ISIs links with Northeast outfits such as Ulfa have been known for some time, this is the first time Lashkar operatives from the region have been arrested in the capital. The Northeast has several Islamic militant outfits, 14 of them in Assam alone. Leading the crop is the All Muslim United Liberation Forum of Assam.

 Intelligence agencies had been tracking the PULF-Lashkar connection since May this year when Kori accompanied Noor, a PULF activist, to Bangladesh.

 A tie-up with the PULF, which controls the Moreh area on the Indo-Myanmarese border, could give the Lashkar control over arms and drug smuggling through the porous international border.

 The tie-up is a serious development, joint commissioner of police (special cell) Karnal Singh said.

 The Lashkars eyes were first set on Manipur in 2001 when it spotted Kori during a visit to Aligarh. The now-dead Lashkar leader, Salim Salar, motivated him to go to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and undergo arms training and a special course in karate. Kori visited Islamabad, too.

 Three years later, he joined the outfits Poonch unit and was asked to recruit youths from Manipur.

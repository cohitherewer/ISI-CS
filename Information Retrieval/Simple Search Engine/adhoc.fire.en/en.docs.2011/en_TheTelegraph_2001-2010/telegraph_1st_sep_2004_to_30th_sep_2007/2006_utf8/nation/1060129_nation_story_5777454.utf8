The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Devotee out, TV crew in

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 28: A devotee was refused entry to a church because a serial was being shot inside. The incident, early this week, has created a stir in the Catholic community here, but the church says renting out its premises is a useful way of raising funds.

 The St Bonavanture Church in Erangal village, Malad, which was built in 1565 and is known for its Portuguese architecture, is often rented out for shooting films. This week, when Francis Fernandes came to offer prayers, he could not enter allegedly because the caretaker told him that television crew were shooting for the serial Millee on STAR Plus and could not be disturbed.

 The Catholic community in Mumbai has objected strongly to the refusal. A church is for worshippers. Nothing can go on inside at the expense of worshippers, said Dolphy DSouza, president, Bombay Catholic Sabha.

 Why Christians alone? No one from any religion should be stopped from entering.

 He said the incident was more unacceptable because the church had a 400-year-old tradition and it is situated at a distance from the main city. Erangal village is near the picturesque Madh Island, where much outdoor shooting takes place.

 But parish priest Malcolm DSouza, who is in charge of the church, said it is not misuse of the church premises. He said the church ? it is actually a chapel, he said ? is often rented out to film crews for a few hours.

 It happens once in two months, he said. But this is the first time that an incident like this has happened. This person must have been in a hurry.

 He said the church is not used for any activity other than prayer services. Shooting is allowed because it brings in much-needed funds. 

 The crew pays a small amount as donation for shooting for a few hours. It comes in very handy, as funds are necessary for the maintenance of the building.

 But Dolphy DSouza said if there was need to raise money, there were other ways of doing it.

 The director of the serial, Vinta Nanda, said her crew had shot for the serial four or five days ago, but she was not aware of the incident.

 She added that whenever she shot inside a church, she kept in mind the dignity of the place.

 Bihar cop top guns test HIV positive

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Oct. 24: Bihar police 

 headquarters today confirmed that two senior officers and 

 20 other policemen in the state have tested HIV positive. 

 While refusing to divulge the identities, home secretary Afzal Amanullah said the two officers sent their blood samples to a laboratory in Delhi on their own. On the other hand, the doctor in charge of the police hospital in Patna submitted a report on the status of the 20 other policemen. The samples have been sent to Delhi for confirmation.

 A television channel and a newspaper, however, identified the duo as IPS officers of deputy inspector-general rank and also went on to report that the government was concerned over the matter. 

 P. Ojha, the doctor at the police hospital who forwarded the report on the 20 police constables, told The Telegraph that no senior police officer had submitted his blood sample with the institution for verification.

 The revelation has created a flutter in the state capital and senior police officials, caught in an unenviable position, have tried to evade the matter by declaring that the headquarters was not in a position to keep an eye on the private lives and morals of the officers.

 What, however, is entirely possible is that the officers and the other policemen have fallen victim to contaminated blood transfusion. 

 With blood banks in Bihar rarely following norms and screening blood samples, the chances of HIV-infected blood being administered are high, said sources.

 Dilip Sen of Sen Diagnostics, the only private pathology laboratory in the state capital equipped to conduct HIV tests, said that since 1995, they have tested as many as 13,000 blood samples. A little less than 10 per cent of the samples have tested positive so far. Among those who tested positive, he added, around 100 were from the police and the army.

 Most of the affected persons were daily-wage-earners and rickshaw-pullers. Although patients are not obliged to reveal their business or profession to us, many of them do so on their own, claimed Sen.

 Police sources said most of the policemen who tested positive have had postings in the districts bordering Nepal. A few constables have been attached with the Railway Police. Amanullah confirmed having received a proposal from the police hospital to make HIV tests mandatory during recruitment of policemen.

 Additional director general of police, Abhayanand, however denied having received any such report. Even if such a report exists, it was not routed through me, he said.

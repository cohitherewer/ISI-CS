 New Delhi, May 21: Delhi or Lucknow? A tricky choice faces Rahul Gandhi as he is poised to take the next step in his political career as an All India Congress Committee functionary.

 Congressmen are unanimous that the time is ripe for the Amethi MP to move up the ladder and become party general secretary. But they differ sharply on whether he should focus on the partys frontal organisations ? such as the Youth Congress, Seva Dal, Mahila Congress and the National Students Union of India ? or concentrate on Uttar Pradesh.

 Some Congress leaders believe that the poll-bound heartland state should top Rahuls priority. He is fresh from the Rae Bareli success and Uttar Pradesh is reportedly craving for change.

 In a four-corner contest with the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the BJP, the Congress could hold the balance of power even if it gets 50-80 Assembly seats. Such a success would be visible and pronounced enough to help project Rahul as the future leader of the party and the country.

 The pessimistic view is that the plan is fraught with risk. Uttar Pradesh is a difficult political terrain. The partys organisational structure there is virtually non-existent beyond Amethi, Rae Bareli and Sultanpur.

 State Congress chief Salman Khursheed is so clueless that he has not been able to appoint an executive panel in the past two years, a source said. This line of argument further suggests that while Rahul may draw crowds, his charisma may not translate into votes.

 The route to success, therefore, lies through 24 Akbar Road, the Congress headquarters. From an air-conditioned office, Rahul can monitor progress, meet leaders from all over the country and implement some of his management skills.

 The backers of this theory cite history: Rajiv Gandhi had been given a similar assignment by Indira Gandhi in 1983. He built a team, mixing newcomers with those from the Sanjay Gandhi era.

 Ahmad Patel, Oscar Fernandes, Ashok Gehlot, Digvijay Singh, Tarun Gogoi, Jayanti Natrajan, Harish Rawat, D.P. Ray, Pawan Bansal, Sarfaraz Ahmad and dozens of others come from this era. Most of them went on to hold big posts and assignments, owing their entire career to Rajiv.

 Rahul has left the final decision to his mother and party chief Sonia Gandhi. On Monday, when the Congress Working Committee will once again plead with Sonia to assign greater responsibility to Rahul, she would take a decision, party sources said.

 What Sonia decides will indicate a timetable for Rahuls future assignments. A thrust on Uttar Pradesh would mean a grassroots route, a path on which success would fill the young Gandhi with self-confidence and a sense of achievement.

 Taking charge of nearly defunct frontal organisations should imply that Rahul has arrived, and that its just a matter of time before he is formally projected as Prime Minister of the country for the 15th Lok Sabha.

 Amid the speculation, Rahul has been quietly meeting senior party leaders individually to get vital inputs, learn from their experience and hear tales of how his father, grandmother and great-grandfather had dealt with tricky situations.

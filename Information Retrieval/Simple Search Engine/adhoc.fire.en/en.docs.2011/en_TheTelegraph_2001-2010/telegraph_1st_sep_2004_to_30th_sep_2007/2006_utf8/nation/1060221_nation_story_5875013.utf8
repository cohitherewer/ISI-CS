 Student poll panel to visit Calcutta

 New Delhi (PTI): The six-member J.M. Lyngdoh committee, set up after the Supreme Court ordered streamlining students union elections, will visit Calcutta later in February to seek the opinion of a cross-section of people.

 The committee will visit Calcutta on February 27 and 28 to examine issues like criminalisation of the elections, financial transparency, eligibility criteria and institution of a forum to address grievances and disputes arising out of the polls.

 In its interactions with people, the committee will also examine the impact of elections on the academic atmosphere in educational institutions.

 Besides Lyngdoh, the committee has as its members Prof. Zoya Hasan and Prof. Pratap Bhanu Mehta from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Dayanand Dongaonkar, secretary-general of the Association of Indian Universities, Prof. Ved Prakash, director, National Institute of Education, Planning and Management, and I.P. Singh, retired deputy comptroller and auditor general.

 SC breather for Assam MP

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has directed a Noida-based petitioner to identify the source of documents on the basis of which he has questioned the citizenship of Assam MP Mani Kumar Subba. 

 A bench of Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice C.K. Thakker asked petitioner Birendra Nath Singh to file an affidavit within a week before the PIL, alleging that Subba was a Nepali citizen, was entered. 

 The PIL alleged that the lottery baron and Congress MP from Tezpur had fled to India after a criminal case was filed against him in Nepal in the early 1970s.

 The allegations are baseless, fabricated, scandalous and totally unfounded, Subba said. 

 Hostel murder

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A school student was found murdered in his hostel room in Gujarats Junagadh town two days ago.

 Laxman Mankadia, 14, sustained multiple injuries after being hit with a cricket bat, police said on Monday. Gogo Makwana, who runs the hostel, is absconding and a probe is on to find out his role in the murder. 

 Double suicide

 Jammu (PTI): A police constable allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the roof of his house in Doda district on Sunday. Farooq Ahmed had a fight with his family. In an unrelated incident, Rakesh Kumar, an insurance company employee, killed himself by jumping from the Tawi bridge in the same district. 

 Cylinder blast

 Chennai (PTI): Four persons were killed when a cooking gas cylinder exploded in a house here on Monday morning. The building collapsed, injuring 12 others.

Navjot Singh Sidhu has planned to be on a daylong maun vrata on February 26. The cricketer-turned-MP, famed for his non-stop chatter, will maintain silence to observe Shivratri.

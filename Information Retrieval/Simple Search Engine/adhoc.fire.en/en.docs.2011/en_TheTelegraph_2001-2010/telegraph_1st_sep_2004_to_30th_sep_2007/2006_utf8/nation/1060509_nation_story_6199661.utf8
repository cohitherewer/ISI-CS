 Cops hand in Jessica synopsis

 New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): Delhi police today submitted a note containing the synopsis of the status report and other details of the Jessica Lal murder case to Delhi High Court.

 The note ? which was in a sealed cover ? contains a date-wise report from the murder of the model in 1999 to the ongoing probe by a special team into the botched-up investigations that eventually led to the acquittal of all the nine accused.

 Counsel for the Delhi government Mukta Gupta submitted the note after a high court directive on April 19, which expressed displeasure at the delay in submitting the status report. 

 Acting Chief Justice Vijender Jain and Justice S.N. Agarwal had asked Gupta to furnish a synopsis of the report as the court could not be expected to go through the voluminous material.

 Mukta told the court today that the note included photocopies of the original case diary, the chargesheet and the status report filed by Delhi police in 1999.

 That year, too, the high court had sought a status report on the investigations after an NGO filed a petition demanding a CBI inquiry. But the court disposed of the petition after the police filed a chargesheet.

 Copies of Delhi polices appeal against the acquittals of the accused and the CD containing the statements of prime accused Manu Sharma are also part of the synopsis submitted today.

 The high court posted the matter for hearing to July 5.

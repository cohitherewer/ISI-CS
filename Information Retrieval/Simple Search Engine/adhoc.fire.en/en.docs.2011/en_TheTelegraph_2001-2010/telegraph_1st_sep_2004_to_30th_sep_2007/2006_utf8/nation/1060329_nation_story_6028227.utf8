 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 28: The Liberhan Commission probing the Ayodhya demolition has wound up its hearings, though the Centre has yet to file written submissions.

 The commission had asked for the views of the Centre on December 8.

 If the Centre fails to file the affidavit, the commission will come to a conclusion without the submission.

 Sources said the Centre was likely to file an affidavit within a few days or at least before the next sitting of the commission on April 19. 

 The commission is likely to give its report before the expiry of its term on June 30. 

 The one-man commission was set up on December 16, 1992.

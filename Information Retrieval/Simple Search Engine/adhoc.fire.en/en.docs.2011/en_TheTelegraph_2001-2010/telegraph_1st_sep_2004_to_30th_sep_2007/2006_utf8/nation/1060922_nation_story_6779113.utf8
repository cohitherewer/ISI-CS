 New Delhi, Sept. 21: An unfinished blue-and-yellow sweater lay beside her. Shahida Banos fingers were still.

 They no longer held the needles that till yesterday flew in and out, over and under, tugging at the balls of wool. Today, they clutched a photograph of her 14-year-old Ashraf, for whom she was knitting the sweater.

 In the photograph, the boy, blue-eyed, her youngest, is in a sweater. Shahida had knitted that one, too.

 Then she broke down.

 Ashraf and Bashir, 7, were returning home from school yesterday when bullets, apparently fired by police, slammed into them. The two were among four persons killed after stone-throwing mobs clashed with police to protest the governments drive to close down illegal shops in residential areas.

 But why our son? He was returning from school and had just gone to see what the commotion was about, Shahida cried as her oldest, Kalaam, made preparations for the burial. The burial has to wait till her husband Mohammed Islam, a fruit trader, returns from Kashmir.

 As the grieving mother sobbed in her home, outside, the tension threatened to spill over despite a flag march by the Border Security Force in the morning.

 An 18-year-old madarsa student, Mohammed Qasim, had died overnight at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in East Delhi. The fourth body has not been identified yet, but police say he was one of the traders in the mob that clashed with them.

 For many like Mohammed Hashim, Qasims father, the violence brought back memories of the police lathi-charge in the largely Muslim locality of Seelampur during the protests that followed the Babri Masjids demolition in 1992. 

 I and my wife were beaten up then, my son was killed yesterday, he said.

 That baton-charge led to four deaths. Fourteen years later, the toll is the same.

 What seems to have upset residents of Seelampur the most is that while the police came under attack elsewhere, too, it was only here that they opened fire.

 Is it because we are Muslims? asked Qasims uncle Mohammed Kader.

 Additional commissioner of police S.S. Cheema dismissed the allegation, but said the district had a history of violence.

 Two weeks back, a few of the residents got into a scuffle with the police. The firing, which appears to have led to the deaths, was because the mob attacked us, he said.

 Yesterday, the police had claimed they had only fired rubber bullets in the air. They could hardly say that today after doctors said both Ashraf and Qasim were shot in the head, Ashraf from close range.

 Ashrafs brother Aslam spoke of how the cops had reacted when he told them he wanted the body to be kept in the mortuary till his father returned. He said the first question the cops asked him was: What is your father doing in Kashmir?

 They talked to us as though he was a terrorist, he said.

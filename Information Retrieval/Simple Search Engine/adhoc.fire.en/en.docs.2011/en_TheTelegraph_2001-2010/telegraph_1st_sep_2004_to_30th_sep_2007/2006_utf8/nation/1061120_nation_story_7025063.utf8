 Rs 2-lakh rap for botched surgery

 New Delhi, Nov. 19 (PTI): The State Consumer Commission has asked a hospital and a surgeon to pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation to a man who became permanently disabled after two surgeries failed to fix his fractured leg. 

 Holding them guilty of medical negligence, the commission headed by Justice J.D. Kapoor took strong note of the fact that metal nails, inserted to fix the fracture, broke and made the reunion of bones impossible. 

 It held the Lajpat Nagar-based Mool Chand Kharaiti Ram Hospital and surgeon Arun Goel responsible for rendering the man, Mool Chand, disabled.

 Allowing Chands complaint, Justice Kapoor said: Whenever a medical professional chooses a device out of several options which are more advantageous, he has to follow the requi- rements of that device meticulously. 

 He added: Having regard to the fact and circumstances of the case and the nature of the medical negligence on the part of the hospital and the doctor, which is writ large on the face of it, we hold them guilty of deficiency in service.

 The commission asked the hospital and the ortho- paedic surgeon to pay the amount to Chand within two months.

 Golden Buddha theft in Sarnath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Jan. 11: A 1-kg gold idol of the Buddha has been stolen from a temple complex in Sarnath near Varanasi. 

 The theft was detected on Monday. Apart from the idol, several silver objects and precious stones have gone missing from the temple owned by the Mahabodhi Society of India.

 Police swung into action last morning, grilling security personnel, temple insiders and residents of Sarnath, an important pilgrimage centre for Buddhists.

 Police said although the theft was detected in the afternoon, they were not informed till evening.

 We have picked up four persons and detained them for interrogation, said Navneet Sikera, the Varanasi senior superintendent of police.

 Principal secretary, home, Aloke Sinha said the police would review Sarnaths security system, but the theft appeared to be an insiders job. Without the help of an insider, entering the temple by crossing the intricate security system would be impossible. 

 Forensic experts have been brought in to examine the spot and sniffer dogs were also pressed into service.

 The police found that one of the windows of the temple, which is fenced by an iron grille, had been broken open. The burglars, however, did not touch the Buddhas ashes kept in an urn.

 Temple officials said a monk, Shibli Bhante, and a security officer spotted the broken window on Monday. 

 K. Siri Sumedha Thero, the chief of the Mahabodhi Society of India, who was on his way to the organisations Calcutta headquarters, was immediately informed. He headed back to Sarnath.

 A group of devotees from Sri Lanka had gifted the Buddha idol to the temple three decades ago.

 Sarnath, 6 km north of Varanasi, is where Gautam Buddha is believed to have delivered his first sermon. It draws thousands of foreign tourists at this time of the year, mostly from Korea, Sri Lanka and Japan.

 The theft and loss of the idol? has hurt the sentiments of Buddhists, said S.D. Bhante, a Buddhist monk.

 Tour conductors in Varanasi are wary that the theft might hit business.

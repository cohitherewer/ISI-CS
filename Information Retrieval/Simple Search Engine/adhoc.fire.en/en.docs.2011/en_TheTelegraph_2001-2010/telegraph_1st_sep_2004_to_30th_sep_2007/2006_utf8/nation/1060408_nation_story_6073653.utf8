 Car import route survives film star scare

 New Delhi, April 7: After being busted last year for a car import scam that engulfed Bollywood stars and some politicians, the travel and tourism trade can breathe a little easy. 

 The government isnt going to pull the plug on car imports under the export promotion capital goods (EPCG) scheme ? a prospect that had loomed after several Bollywood stars like Saif Ali Khan, Suniel Shetty, Sanjay Dutt, Sushmita Sen and Diya Mirza were hauled in for questioning last year over vehicles they had bought from a couple of shysters who had misused the scheme.

 Former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus sons car was also seized. 

 The scheme permits import of cars, sports utility vehicles and all-purpose vehicles on payment of 5 per cent customs duty by hotels, travel agents, tour operators and tour transport operators provided they have foreign exchange earnings of Rs 1.5 crore or more in the year of import and the preceding three licensing years. 

 Several tour operators had brought in a cavalcade of Porsches, Toyota Lexuses, Land Rovers, Mercs, Beemers and Hummers without having to pay the steep 120 per cent duty that import of these vehicles normally attract and then sold them on to the film stars. 

 Aware of the misuse, the finance ministry had directed the department of revenue intelligence to bust the racket ? and the resulting investigation trained the spotlight on Sanjays Toyota Lexus and Sunils Hummer, among others, that had been bought from a Delhi-based tour operator. 

 At one stage, it did seem as though the finance ministry would force a halt to car imports under the scheme, but it now appears that the commerce ministry has been able to work out a compromise. 

 The Export Import policy for 2006-07 unveiled today has wormed in a rider to stop the scam. In an effort to stop small-time tour and travel operators from misusing the scheme, the government has said that the amount of duty saved on vehicle imports shall not exceed 50 per cent of the average foreign exchange earnings from the hotel, travel and tourism, and golf tourism sectors in the preceding three licensing years. 

 Cars imported under the scheme are meant to ferry foreign tourists within India. But over the years, small-time tour and travel operators have found it lucrative to import the cars and sell them on to people who have the moolah and are crazy about marquees ? the more exotic the better. 

 The director-general of foreign trade, K.T. Chacko, told The Telegraph that the rider would check the indiscriminate import of luxury cars by linking it even more firmly to the foreign exchange earnings of the hotel or tour operator.

 He said these tourist operators or hoteliers could earlier import vehicles up to 100 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings. It had been found in certain cases that some of them had imported as many as 10 or even 20 vehicles. The new restriction would check the misuse of the facility, he added. 

 A senior executive with a five-star hotel said the new restriction would be effective in checking small-time operators trying to make a fast buck. These companies normally earn very little foreign exchange and will be constrained by the new ceiling. 

 He said the bigger organisations are less likely to misuse the scheme. Since their foreign exchange earnings are large, they can continue to import the number of vehicles they require to conduct business.

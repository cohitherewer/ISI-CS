 Ulfa talks blow

 Guwahati, Sept. 27: The Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group today pulled out of negotiations with Delhi in protest against its double standards, hammering the last nail into the peace coffin after a series of adverse developments since last weekend, reports our correspondent.

 Considering the flip-flop attitude of the Centre to the extent of going back on its commitment, we in the PCG are of the view that no fruitful results can be expected from the parleys, PCG spokesman Arup Borbora said.

 Formed on September 8 last year, the PCG tried to temper the sense of pessimism by saying that it would continue to work with the people to create a conducive atmosphere for peace. It said Delhi had undermined the decision arrived at during the third round of talks on June 22.

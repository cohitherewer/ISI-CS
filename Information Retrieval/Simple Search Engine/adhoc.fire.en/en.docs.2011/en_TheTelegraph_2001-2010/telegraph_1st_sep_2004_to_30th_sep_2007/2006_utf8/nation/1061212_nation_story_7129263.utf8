 CPM peasant parade in city

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: If it was Mamata Banerjee and her Naxalite allies who expressed solidarity with Singur farmers today, it will be the CPMs turn tomorrow to parade some of them.

 Those on show in the city at the CPM programme would be some of the peasants who have willingly sold their land for the Tatas small-car unit.

 The rally follows todays show of support by the Trinamul Congress and Naxalite leaders for Singur peasants in the heart of Calcutta.

 The venue for tomorrows show would be a stones throw from the place where Mamata is on hunger strike in protest against the acquisition of fertile farmland for industry. Several Naxalite leaders have joined her in the agitation.

 Left Front partners such as the RSP and the CPI have developed cold feet on joining any campaign in support of farmland acquisition and so the CPM will hold the rally under the banner of a committee of willing land-givers for industrialisation and urban development. 

 Tomorrows rally would be by the landgivers, state CPM secretary Biman Bose said at an SFI meeting on Rani Rashmoni Avenue. 

 Dibakar Das, the convener of the committee and a leader of the CPM peasants wing, said: At a rally in Dankuni today, 500 farmers who have sold their land took part. There will be 5,000 of them in Calcutta tomorrow to disprove the Oppositions complaints about forced acquisition. 

 Bose said only 997.11 acres have been acquired out of 3,595.87 acres in Singur. So the hue and cry over farmland acquisition is misplaced. The Trinamul Congress chief, Bose added, was behaving like a stubborn little girl in refusing to end her fast. 

 He was more caustic in his comments about social activists such as the Medha Patkars and Arundhati Roys. These so-called social activists are meddling in politics and serving imperialist design by opposing development programmes in states. Their organisations receive foreign funds. I urge the SFI to launch movements against these sort of intellectuals.

 But the CPMs allies are not convinced. The CPI state council today criticised the government for the police action in Singur and refusing Medha permission to visit the area. 

 Police excesses on common people and journalists and ban on the entry of leaders of social movements are against the Left Fronts policies, state party secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar said.

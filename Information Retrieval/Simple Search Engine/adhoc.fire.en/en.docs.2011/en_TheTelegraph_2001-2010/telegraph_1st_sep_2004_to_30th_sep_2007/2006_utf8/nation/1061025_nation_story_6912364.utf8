 Daylight hit glare on 1993 blast accused

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 24: The crime branch of Mumbai police is likely to question 1993 blasts accused Ejaz Pathan and key Chhota Rajan associate D.K. Rao in connection with the daylight shooting at Kala Ghoda last week in which a duo accused in a narcotics case was killed.

 Both Pathan and Rao are lodged in Arthur Road jail.

 Three people have been arrested in connection with the shooting. They are Pathans 28-year-old-nephew, Abdul Wahab Abdul Salaam Khan alias Lala, and his associates Abdul Samad alias Parveen, 33, and Augustine Ramos alias Karim Bashir Khan, 44. They were produced before a local court and remanded in police custody till November 2.

 We have arrested the trio on the basis of suspicion. The sketches of suspects released on the basis of eyewitness accounts matched the features of Karim Khan. Pathan and Amjad Khan had a financial dispute and we are investigating if the shooting was a fallout of it, said deputy commissioner (crime) Dhananjay Kamlakar.

 Amjad and Himanshu Chaudhary, accused in a mandrax seizure case but out on bail, were shot dead on October 16 when they stepped out of a narcotics court. 

 Amjad, a narcotics smuggler who had links with the Rajan gang, had turned informer, providing inputs to Mumbai police and central enforcement agencies.

 Crime branch officials said they had secured telephone records indicating Wahab had a conversation with Amjad on the morning of the attack, Kamlakar said.

 Pathan and Amjad were partners in the mandrax business much before the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence arrested Amjad with a 516-kg consignment from a Juhu godown in 2000, an official said. Amjad owed Pathan Rs 45 lakh. He had returned Rs 21 lakh. But the payment had resulted in a dispute and they once had a scuffle inside the Arthur Road jail, he added.

 Initially, Rajan was suspected of having killed the drugs duo because Amjad had worked for him in the past. On May 21, Amjad had helped unearth a gun-running operation by the gang. 

 Police had felt Rajan ordered Amjads killing to avenge the bust-up.

 Asked about Rajans involvement, Kamlakar said: We are exploring all angles, and have not ruled out any possibility. The motive could be anything, but we would be able to say more only after investigations are complete. 

 Asked if Pathan and Rao could be quizzed, the commissioner said: We will question those we need to question.

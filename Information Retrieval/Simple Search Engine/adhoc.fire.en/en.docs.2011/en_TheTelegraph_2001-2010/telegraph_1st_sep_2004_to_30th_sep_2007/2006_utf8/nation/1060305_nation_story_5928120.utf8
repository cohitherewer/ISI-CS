 Qila bill

 New Delhi, March 4 (PTI): Booking the Purana Qila for George W. Bushs finest hour in India has lightened the Centres pocket by Rs 25,000.

 We did send the norms to the PMO. In accordance with the norms, Rs 25,000 is charged from the organisers for using the fort, a top tourism and culture ministry official said today.

 The minister alone can grant concessional rates, she added. It was not known if Ambika Soni was approached for one.

 Ulfa guns turn on Gogoi 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dibrugarh, Dec. 26: The Ulfas hit squad has been asked to train its guns on chief minister Tarun Gogoi and his ministers because attacks on security forces, oil and gas pipelines and civilians have not shaken Delhi enough.

 Police extracted this piece of information from Ulfa sergeant-major Samiran Baruah in Dibrugarh. Baruah and two comrades, Numal Chetia and Bonti Gogoi, were arrested in Sivasagar district last weekend.

 A member of the investigation team said the Ulfa seemed to be under the impression that Delhi was not bothered about attacks on security forces or oil and gas pipelines. The outfit believes it needs to do something big that can shake the entire country. 

 Official sources confirmed that the security arrangements for the chief minister and some ministers were strengthened after the revelation.

 Going by what the arrested militant has told the police, the Ulfa is annoyed with Delhi for ordering the resumption of operations by the army and other central forces and eager to give a strong reply. The plan includes attempts to assassinate the chief minister or some his senior colleagues.

 The Ulfa will obviously try to find holes in the security net around the Dispur capital complex, which includes the Assembly and offices and residences of the ministers and members of the Assembly, to trigger explosions, the police said.

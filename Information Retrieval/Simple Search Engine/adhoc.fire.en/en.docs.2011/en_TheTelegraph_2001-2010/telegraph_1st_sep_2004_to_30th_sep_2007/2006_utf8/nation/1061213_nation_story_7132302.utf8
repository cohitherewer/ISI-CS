 New world in the oceans

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: A global census of marine life has revealed exotic, hitherto unknown creatures thriving in the seas, revealing the staggeringly high diversity and huge gaps in human knowledge of life in the oceans.

 Census scientists on Sunday announced their discovery of a furry crab, a giant marine microbe, new species of prawn-like cannibalistic crustaceans and a Jurassic shrimp believed to be extinct for 50 million years. 

 In a report that highlights the findings of 19 census expeditions mounted during 2006, scientists have also described a community of marine life hidden beneath 700-metre thick Antarctic ice, 200 km from the open ocean.

 More than half the creatures we found under the Antarctic ice were not known to science, Ron Dor, professor of marine biology at Dalhousie University in Canada, told The Telegraph. This has been among the most active of census years and it has shown us that theres so much we dont yet know about the oceans, said Dor, a senior census scientist.

 Some 2,000 scientists from 80 countries, including India, are participating in the Census of Marine Life a 10-year initiative to explore the diversity and distribution of life in the oceans that is scheduled to end in 2010.

 Some findings were surprising. What were believed to be lifeless zones in the oceans were found teeming with life. 

 The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Goa is the census node for the Indian Ocean rim countries. The tropical, coastal, and coral zones of the Indian Ocean are among the hotspots of marine diversity, P. Loka Bharati, secretary, Indian Ocean Census of Marine Life, told The Telegraph. Diversity is important. It helps maintain balance in the marine ecosystem.

 Using remotely operated equipment, census scientists have found shrimp and other life forms near a hydrothermal vent at a 3-km depth in the equatorial Atlantic, releasing chemical-laden water at over 400 degrees Celsius. Hydrothermal vents are cracks in the sea floor that release water at high temperatures, the heat coming from layers of Earths crust further below.

 Were finding dozens of new species and we are learning about the evolution of these species how did they arise and what special adaptations do they have that allow them to live in extreme environments, Cindy Lee Van Dover, a biologist at Duke University in the US, told The Telegraph. Van Dover herself led a team that discovered a scaly-footed snail from vents in the central Indian Ocean ridge.

 The new species described in the report released on Sunday include a furry crab discovered near Easter Island, a new protozoan microbe enclosed in a plate-like shell 1-cm in diameter at a depth of 4,300 metres off Portugal and a 4-kg lobster picked up off Madagascar and believed to be among the largest ever.

 Researchers also found 12 new species of crustaceans at a depth of 5 km in the Sargasso Sea, prawn-like creatures that scientists believe eat each other as well as organic matter in the sea. In the Coral Sea, scientists discovered the Jurassic-era shrimp that they believed was extinct.

 Scientists in India have participated in the census through scientific cruises aimed at exploring the diversity of marine life in the Indian Ocean. But exploring the deep sea is a technology-intensive venture and lack of technology has hampered Indian efforts, Loka Bharati said.

 Shield for Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 24: Fifteen MLAs of the BJP, BSP and the Congress, along with six Independents who had backed the Samajwadi Party in the Assembly this year, marched to Raj Bhavan this morning to hand the governor letters of support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. 

 The show of solidarity is seen as a move to fortify the Uttar Pradesh government against a possible withdrawal of support by the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. 

 Twelve rebel-legislators from the BJP, two from the BSP and one from the Congress all of whom had been either expelled or suspended by their parties were part of the group. Their applications for recognition as Samajwadi MLAs are pending with the Speaker.

 This is the first time that they have declared their support to Mulayam in writing. 

 Todays parade follows yesterdays closed-door meeting between Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh and governor T.V. Rajeshwar, sources said.

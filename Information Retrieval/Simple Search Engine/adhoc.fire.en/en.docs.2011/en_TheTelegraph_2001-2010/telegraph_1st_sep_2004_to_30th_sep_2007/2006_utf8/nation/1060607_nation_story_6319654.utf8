 Quota stirs caste cauldron

 DHIRENDRA K. JHA

 New Delhi, June 6: The decision to introduce quotas for other backward classes in higher education has set the caste cauldron in Uttar Pradesh on the boil.

 The Congress and the Samajwadi Party are unsure of the impact of the quota on voters in the heartland while it has thrown up a fresh opportunity for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to make a renewed bid to win over Brahmins before the state goes to polls early next year.

 Although the reservation drive is one of the most important initiatives of the Congress-led coalition at the Centre, the party is shying away from taking credit in Uttar Pradesh. The fear of an upper-caste backlash perhaps weighs heavily on its mind. 

 The Samajwadi Party ? the main champion of OBC politics in the state ? is also in a dilemma. The quota will benefit its political constituency, but the benefactor is the Congress, which can revive in the state only at the cost of Mulayam Singh Yadavs party.

 The quota move has certainly succeeded in injecting confusion among OBCs. With the BSP showing no signs of decline, even a slight shift in the Samajwadi Partys OBC vote bank will be detrimental to the party, a senior Samajwadi Party leader admitted.

 Even as the Congress has gone on the backfoot after taking the reservation decision, the Samajwadi Partys monopoly over OBC politics has been challenged for the first time in the partys history, the leader said.

 He, however, added that as the Congress and the BJP are seen as upper-caste parties and the BSP as a political outfit representing Dalits, the Samajwadi Party would still remain the main claimant to the OBC voters by the time the Assembly elections take place.

 The confusion explains why the Samajwadi Party is the only party of the erstwhile Janata parivar that has not come out to welcome the Centres move to provide reservation to OBC students.

 But the BSP has stepped up efforts to add Brahmins to its vote kitty.

 On the one hand, BSP leader Mayavati has attacked the Congress-led UPA government for announcing the reservation in such a way as to divide society. On the other, Mayavati has expressed willingness to back the Centre if it provides quota to the economically weak among upper castes. 

 The BSP will support the move if the government initiates steps to reserve seats for economically weaker sections of upper castes, she said in Lucknow on Sunday.

 Observers feel that the BSP leader has been eyeing the states 9 per cent Brahmin voters, who have become crucial to the partys bid to capture power.

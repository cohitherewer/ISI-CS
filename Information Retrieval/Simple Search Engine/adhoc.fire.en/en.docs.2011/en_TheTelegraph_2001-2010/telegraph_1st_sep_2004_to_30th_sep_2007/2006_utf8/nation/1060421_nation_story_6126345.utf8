 Pushkar suspect, mom held 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 April 20: Four persons, including the son and wife of a hotel owner, were arrested tonight in connection with the alleged rape of a Japanese tourist in Pushkar.

 The arrested included Babloo, whose father owns Hotel Quiet Palace, Roshani, the wife of the owner, Raju and Sanjay, Ajmer superintendent of police Sriniwas Janga Rao said.

 The arrest of the four followed 10 hours of questioning of the Japanese woman in Ajmer, where she was taken from Agra, by a team of officers. 

 The foreigner had alleged that she was raped and then robbed of Rs 54,000 after being drugged by the son of the hotel owner in Pushkar on April 2.

 Police are looking into a claim by the accused that Babloo had wanted to marry the woman. But the police in Agra, who traced the 24-year-old woman to a guesthouse-cum-restaurant near the Taj complex area, think this might be a ploy to dilute the rape allegations.

 The Japanese woman had faxed the complaint on Tuesday to the Ajmer superintendent of police. Station house officer Sugan Singh Rathore then went to Agra to bring her back last night.

 She is expected to record her statement in a Pushkar court tomorrow.

 Three rooms of Hotel Quiet Palace have been seized as the licence expired last month, sources said. 

 According to Rajiv Krishna, senior superintendent of police, Agra, the tourist had arrived from Pushkar on April 8 and checked into a hotel in the Purana Mandi area of the Old City. 

 She told the hotel employees about her predicament and tried to recover the money from the Pushkar hotel with their help. When she did not succeed, she paid her bills after selling off a camera and other belongings and left. She then went to Indiana Restaurant on April 14, where the police found her. 

 The manager, Mohammad Shahid, had helped her fax the complaint to Ajmer. I found her in a disturbed state of mind. She did not have enough money to have food. I told her if she wanted to have the money back, she must lodge a complaint with the police, Shahid said.

 Representatives from the Japanese embassy, who arrived from Delhi, met her for about an hour in Agra.

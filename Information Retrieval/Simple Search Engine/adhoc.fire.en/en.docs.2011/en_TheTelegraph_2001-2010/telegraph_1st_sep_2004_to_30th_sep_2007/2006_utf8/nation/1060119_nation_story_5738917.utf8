The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Buddha has what Beijing doesnt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 18: What are Indias strengths over China?

 One, it has a stable stock market. Two, it is a democracy.

 Big deal.

 Only, the knight slaying the Red dragon was Bengals Marxist chief minister, whose party has for decades held up China as a model for development, turned its nose up at the stock market and believed that Indian democracy was deeply flawed.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was hard-selling India before a galaxy of foreign delegates at a business conference here today when the question was thrown at him: why does China attract a much larger slice of the FDI pie than India?

 Yes it does, the chief minister admitted, but it wont for long. With its stable stock market, sound banking system, democracy and human resource, India could in the near future outstrip China, whose only advantage is good infrastructure.

 Not convinced? Ask the Japanese.

 Many companies that I talk to say India is the better place to be, Bhattacharjee said. I have even spoken to the Japanese who have investments both in India and China. They hold the same view.

 China is still ahead in infrastructure, having built a mind-boggling network of roads, ports and airports, he conceded. But we have skilled labour and good manpower. Once we develop infrastructure, we will catch up with China.

 Bhattacharjees focus was expectedly on promoting Bengal as a lucrative destination for global investors.

 He reasserted his governments commitment to building a deep sea port. This will give a tremendous boost to industry in Bengal, he said.

 He mentioned that Bengal was looking to build a new greenfield airport near Calcutta. It would soon float a global tender to appoint a consultant to do a feasibility report.

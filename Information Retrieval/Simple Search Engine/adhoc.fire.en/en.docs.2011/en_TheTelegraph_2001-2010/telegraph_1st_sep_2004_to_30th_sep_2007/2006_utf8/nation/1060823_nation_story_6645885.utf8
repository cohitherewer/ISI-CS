 Natwar plays Sonia card

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Natwar Singh has rolled out the heavy artillery to outgun the Congress disciplinary council.

 Only Sonia Gandhi can try him, Natwar has bluntly told a Congress panel that had asked him why he should not be expelled over the oil-for-food scandal.

 In a six-page reply, Natwar tonight asked the Congresss disciplinary action committee to refer the issue of his expulsion to Sonia.

 He told the panels chairman, A.K. Antony, that it is rather extraordinary that my case for suspension/expulsion has been initiated by and is being considered by a committee of which two members, including yourself and another member, have earlier been expelled by the Congress for six years for anti-party activities and had launched their own parties.

 In view of this, my case should be referred to the Congress president, said the former foreign minister, who was suspended after the Pathak authority said he misused his position to get oil contracts for people close to him.

 Natwar said Pathak had not referred to his affidavit submitted during the hearing. Neither had he referred to a one-hour deposition made on May 31.

 Then why were we called and why was I asked for the affidavit? he said, adding that no country in the world, except India, had taken the Paul Volcker committee report seriously.

 Referring to the letters he had written to Iraqi authorities, Natwar cited the examples of Presidents George W. Bush and Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Tony Blair leading business delegations to lobby host nations.

 Jaya steps up rollback heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, June 12: An angry Jayalalithaa today went hammer and tongs at the Centre and the Tamil Nadu DMK government, demanding a complete rollback in oil prices.

 In a statewide protest by the Opposition, the ADMK chief today said the latest hike was too much to bear for the millions of common folk. 

 Yesterday, Jayalalithaas chiding had compelled chief minister M. Karunanidhi to forgo sales tax on the amount by which the price of diesel has been raised. 

 But the Opposition was present in full force today in the rally at Madras Medical College. Jayalalithaas allies ? annan (elder brother) Vaiko, of the MDMK, and thambi (younger brother) Thol.Thirumavalavan, of the Dalit Panthers of India ? joined the ADMK chief in criticising the state government. Jayalalithaa may not be ruling the state now, but she reigns in the hearts of the people, Vaiko shouted. 

 Outside the college, ADMK supporters had managed a rare sight by mounting a shining Maruti Zen on a wooden cart pulled by a bullock, with a graffiti condemning the DMK, which is the UPA governments ally in Delhi. 

 But rarer still was the sight of Jayalalithaa shouting slogans in Tamil as thousands chorused aniyayam, aniyayam (unjust, unjust).

 Today, Jayalalithaa gunned straight for the intellectual trio of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

 All these three people have studied abroad and are acknowledged economic experts. But they do not understand the Indian economy, nor the circumstances and sufferings of the Indian masses, she said, referring to the three by their names. 

 The common people were already reeling under the impact of five price hikes in petroleum products and to impose a sixth, and that, too, soon after the Assembly elections in five states, smacks of the Centres disregard for the peoples sufferings, she said. 

 I have been repeatedly saying the Centre is far removed from the people and the states are closer to them. But the central government is acting as if there is no link at all between those who govern and the governed.

 Dont kill the people with such harsh burdens, she advised the Centre and asked the DMK not to justify the price hike, while dubbing its decision to forgo the sales tax on the increase in the price of diesel an eye-wash.

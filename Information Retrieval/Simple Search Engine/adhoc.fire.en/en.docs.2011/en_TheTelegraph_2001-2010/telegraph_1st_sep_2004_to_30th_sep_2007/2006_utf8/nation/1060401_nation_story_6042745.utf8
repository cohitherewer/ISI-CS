 Kandahar detention notice to Centre

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: The Supreme Court today issued a notice to the Centre on a petition seeking release of two Kashmiri youths, who had been allegedly languishing in a secret detention camp since their arrest in the Kandahar hijack case.

 A bench of Justices B.N. Agrawal and A.K. Mathur issued the notice on the petition filed by Ruquaiya, who has alleged that her brothers had been kept in detention without trial since their arrest from Nepal in August 2000 in connection with the hijack of an Indian Airlines aircraft to Kandahar in December 1999.

 Ruquaiya, a resident of Srinagar, said Mushtaq Ahmad Rah and Mohammad Shafi Rah were arrested by Nepal police and handed over to Indian authorities. She also referred to a newspaper report on the arrest of suspects in Nepal.

 Before her brothers were arrested, Srinagar police had even detained her 75-year-old father for a few days in June 2000, she said, adding that no legal action was, however, initiated against him.

 The petitioner said she had moved court only after all her attempts to locate her brothers had failed. Besides approaching several government bodies and ministries, she had also moved the National Human Rights Commission. 

 The panel had sought a status report from the Centre, but the copy of the report, if any, had not been made available to her family, she said. 

 Ruquaiya claimed the home ministry had even admitted in November that both her brothers were detained in Jodhpur jail but she was not allowed to meet them. The family, thereafter, made several representations before the ministry, but without any result.

 Although no person can be detained for more than 24 hours without being produced in court, she said, her brothers had been kept in detention for almost six years.

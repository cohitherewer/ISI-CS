 Torture salve on police

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 13: Five days after seven men arrested for the July 11 blasts retracted their confessions before a special court alleging police pressure, six other accused denied any kind of torture by the police.

 The court today transferred the six back to police custody, in what is being seen as a small victory for the anti-terrorist squad that had been accused of torture/pressure.

 All 16 accused had then been remanded in judicial custody.

 The six sent to police custody today are Naved Hussain, Mohammed Majid Ahmed Sheikh, Shiekh Mohammed Ali Alam, Mohammed Shajid Markhat Anzari, Abdul Wahid and Asif Khan Bashir.

 The Maharashtra ATS has arrested 16 people for allegedly setting off the serial blasts on trains that left over 200 dead in July. They also claimed to have cracked the case on the basis of their confessions.

 On Monday, led by prime-accused Faisal Shaikh, Muzammil Shaikh, Tanvir Ahmed Ansari, Mohammed Kamal Ansari, Ethesham Siddiqui, Sohail Shaikh and Zamir Ahmed Ansari told the court that they had been forced by police to sign on blank paper. They alleged no magistrate or DCP was present for recording their statements, as is mandatory under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.

 The accused were in police custody when they went back on their statements. Usually, retractions are made by accused when they are in judicial custody.

 The biggest blow to the ATS came when the seven accused it of torture. But today, the six other accused did not complain of police torture to the court. I am only pleading that I am innocent and wrongly implicated in the case, said Naved Hussain.

 The court allowed the accused to meet family members and have home-cooked food in jail.

 But what surprised many was an application from the ATS to the court to discharge three accused Mumtaz Choudhary, Khalid Ahmed and Akhmal Hashmi. The court allowed them to walk free.

 We had told the court that the three had been arrested in connection with the blasts, but on investigation no evidence has been found against them, so they should be freed. We are not against any community as is being alleged by a section of the media, said ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi.

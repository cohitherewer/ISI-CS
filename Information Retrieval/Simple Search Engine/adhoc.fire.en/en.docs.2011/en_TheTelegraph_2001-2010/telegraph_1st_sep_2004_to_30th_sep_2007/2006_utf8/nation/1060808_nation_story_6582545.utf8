 NDA to boycott Somnaths House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 7: Tensions between the Opposition and the Speaker have surfaced again with the National Democratic Alliance deciding to stay away from the Lok Sabha tomorrow in protest against Somnath Chatterjees total disregard for their views.

 The decision came after Chatterjee did not allow the BJP-led coalitions demand to immediately take up the breach of privilege notice against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The Oppositions other grouse is that the Speaker allowed routine House business to be conducted with no regard for their participation.

 Besides boycotting Parliament, NDA leaders would wear black badges and sit under Mahatma Gandhis statue to protest against what they called contempt for their views. They would not sign the register or collect their daily allowance for tomorrow.

 NDA members were on their feet today as soon as the Lok Sabha assembled, shouting slogans and demanding the Prime Ministers resignation and an apology for the leak of the Pathak committees report. When they kept insisting that the privilege notice against Singh be taken up immediately, the Speaker sternly said: The matter is under my consideration.

 BJP deputy leader in the House V.K. Malhotra said Chatterjee had himself taken strong objection to the leak. But that has nothing to do with the breach of privilege (notice), the speaker responded sharply. The din continued despite Chatterjees efforts to restore calm. Finally, the House had to be adjourned.

 In the afternoon, the government tabled the Pathak report and the action-taken report on the probe. The business of the House continued despite the Oppositions demand for an apology from the Prime Minister. Important bills were passed and a statement on pesticide contamination in colas was allowed to be tabled.

 The NDA said the Speaker was allowing important bills to be passed and statements presented without a discussion in the House. That means there is no role for the Opposition, Malhotra said. The (ruling) UPA has been bulldozing its way through. We wanted to mention the privilege notice but nothing was discussed. We are particularly aggrieved by the Speakers observations in the House.

 The Speaker, on his part, has written a letter to all MPs saying that three out of 10 days in the monsoon session have been lost due to uproar in the House. Seeking cooperation, he maintained that he had allowed all possible issues to be raised for discussion.

 Chatterjee reminded that his choice as Speaker was unanimous. Since this responsibility has come to me, which was quite unexpected and, of course, unsolicited, I have been trying in my humble way, in regular consultations with leaders of different parties and groups, to carry on my onerous duties.

 Vaiko piles Lanka heat

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: MDMK chief Vaiko today met Manmohan Singh and demanded the recall of Sri Lankas deputy high commissioner in Chennai, P. Amza, for criticising a resolution adopted by the Tamil Nadu Assembly opposing military action in the island nation.

 It (Amzas statement) was a high-handed action, which went beyond diplomatic boundaries. He should be asked to go back, Vaiko told reporters after the meeting.

 Vaiko led a protest against genocide of Tamils in Lanka before he met the Prime Minister along with four party MPs.

 The MDMK leaders submitted a memorandum urging Singh not to extend military assistance to Lanka. Otherwise, Vaiko said, it would be construed as a direct help to the Sri Lanka government to attack the Tamils.

 Vaiko said they gave a detailed account of the Tamil problem and the present situation.... The Prime Minister has told us India will not offer any military help to Sri Lanka, he added.

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, May 29: A 13-member oversight committee chaired by Congress leader Veerappa Moily and three technical groups will be expected to pencil a roadmap for implementing the 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Classes.

 The government today announced the composition of the committee that will also assess the additional infrastructure and other requirements for increasing intake so that the existing level of seats for general category students does not decline.

 The committee has been asked to submit its report by August 31 after it receives suitable inputs from three technical groups ? one each for engineering institutions, management schools and central universities.

 Bhalchandra Mungekar, member of the Planning Commission, Raghunath Mashelkar, director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Sukhdeo Thorat, chairman of the University Grants Commission are among members of the committee. (See chart)

 The three technical groups will determine the actual increase in seats in specific courses, faculty requirement and other infrastructure for the higher intake and work out both recurring and non-recurring costs of the addition of seats.

 The technical groups, which have to submit their reports by July 31, will also have to suggest short-term measures to be taken by each institution to cope with the enhanced intake from academic year 2007-08.

 The technical group for engineering institutions includes senior faculty of various IITs. 

 The group for management education includes directors of five IIMs, while vice-chancellors and faculty from central universities constitute the group for universities.

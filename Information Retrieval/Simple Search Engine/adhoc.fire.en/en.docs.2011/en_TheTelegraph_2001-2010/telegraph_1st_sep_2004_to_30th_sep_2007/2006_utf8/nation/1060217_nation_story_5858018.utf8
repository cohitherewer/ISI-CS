 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Centre has decided to promote only the bright and committed civil servants, offering laggards the option of voluntary retirement.

 If the latter refuse the golden handshake, they must reconcile themselves to working without promotion, often under batchmates or even juniors.

 The evaluation will be part of one or more mid-career screenings, which will take place after the officials have worked for 15-25 years.

 The way they are judged will change, too. The bureaucrats performances will be assessed by an eminent persons group, with the current system of annual confidential reports being junked.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, addressing the joint sitting of Parliament, announced these reforms today. He voiced the governments determination to reform the instruments and processes of governance and said several steps had been taken so that the process could begin from the top.

 My government is introducing mid-career training systems, with promotions based on new criteria and an accelerated empanelment procedure for senior civil servants, the President said.

 The voluntary retirement, non-promotion system on the basis of mid-career screening was one of the chief recommendations of the Surendra Nath Committee, set up in December 2002 to study the existing system of evaluation and promotion and suggest reforms.

 The commission, too, had suggested that officers performances be reviewed at the end of 15 and 25 years of service and that promotions be tied to performance. It had said that at either stage, the bureaucrats failing to qualify be offered voluntary retirement.

 Kalam said the Centre had instituted the Prime Ministers Awards to encourage commitment among officers.

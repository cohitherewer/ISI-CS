The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No boss, but Sonia team soldiers on

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 12: The profit bill has cleared the way for her return, but will she?

 Its still a puzzle. Yet, away from the media and public glare, members of the National Advisory Council that Sonia Gandhi once headed have been meeting and conferring among themselves and with senior officials.

 The Congress chief, who stepped down from the post in the wake of the office-of-profit row, has not involved herself in these exercises. But NAC sources said she is in constant touch with council secretary Arun Bhatnagar to monitor the progress of the schemes on its agenda as well as initiate discussions with the government for new projects.

 It is learnt that Sonia was concerned about how the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act was working on the ground and what was happening to the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a drive to universalise education.

 She was also keen to have the National Rehabilitation Policy, recommended in detail by the council, in place before another Narmada crisis faced the government. Another priority was judicial reforms for which, too, the NAC has submitted a blueprint to the Centre.

 In the two and a half months since Sonia has been out of the NAC, the sources said the members met at least once a fortnight. Though the quorum of 11 was not always there, those concerned with their work sectors made it a point to be around in the capital when it was necessary.

 About 10 days ago, Renuka Vishwanathan, the secretary in the rural development ministry, had requested some NAC members to discuss implementation of the employment guarantee act. A member said the ministrys feedback was not encouraging.

 As compared to the investment, the actual demand for jobs is not even 10 per cent. Im talking of a well-performing state like Andhra Pradesh. I gather the labour market is in the hands of contractors, so its becoming tough for the administration to directly tap the workers, he said.

 The NAC has asked the ministry to investigate the mismatch between the job supply and demand under the act.

 The council has proposed a rehabilitation policy which would ensure that families done out of their lands and houses have an improved standard of living and get a sustainable income above the poverty line. It also recommended giving houses to all those ousted, irrespective of whether they possessed one or not, and constructing homes for those below the poverty line.

 The council called for making the rehabilitation policy justiciable by linking it with the Land Acquisition Act. It also stressed that this act should be amended to make it people-oriented and consensual.

 The Sonia imprint was visible in the draft policy, which suggested a gender-neutral approach so that all women ? single, married, widowed or separated ? had equal property rights.

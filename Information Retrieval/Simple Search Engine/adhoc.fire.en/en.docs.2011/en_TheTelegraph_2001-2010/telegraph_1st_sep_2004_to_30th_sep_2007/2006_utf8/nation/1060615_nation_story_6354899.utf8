 IIM sheds merit tears 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Apte: Quota bother

 Bangalore, June 14: If the Centre pushes through the proposed OBC quota in higher education, the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, is certain meritorious students will have to be shown the door.

 We will not be able to increase the number of seats to accommodate merit students in case the Centre thrusts the proposed 27 per cent OBC reservation upon us, IIMB director Prakash G. Apte said.

 For IIMB to implement the proposal to accommodate the 27 per cent quota and leave the general category seats untouched, the total number of seats will have to be increased by 55 per cent.

 We cannot increase intake suddenly. Already, there is a shortage of faculty and infrastructure. It has to be done in a phased manner.

 Three years ago, IIMB had planned to hike seats for its postgraduate programme. For this academic year, it is offering 260 seats and plans to increase intake to 300 for 2007-08. 

 The oversight committee, headed by Veerappa Moily, set up to monitor implementation of the quota has hinted that it will be introduced in IIMs and IITs from 2007-08, in central universities from 2008-09 and in postgraduate medical courses from 2009-10.

 If the quotas are thrust on us, I am afraid the number of merit seats will have to be reduced, Apte said.

 The director is unhappy that the sub-committee set up under the Moily panel to look into the IIMs does not include a representative from IIMB and Indore. How can the committee arrive at any decision without our inputs?

 The sub-committee is headed by Samuel Paul, a former IIM Ahmedabad director erroneously identified as a former director of IIM Bangalore. It includes directors of the IIMs at Ahmedabad, Calcutta and Kozhikode.

 At a meeting with the sub-committee last week, IIMB faculty members opposed the quota and some had threatened to write to the President. But after a week, the mood seems much mellowed. 

 What is the use in writing to the President when the government is keen to introduce quotas? We will not go against it, but it is clear that merit students will suffer, one said.

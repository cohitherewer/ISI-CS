 In Singur: cash vs crop

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT AMP; UTTAM DUTTA

 Kashinath Das is not with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. He wants to hold on to his two-bigha plot and will do anything to save his baap-thakurdar jomi (ancestral land).

 I borrowed money to marry off my three daughters. I could repay the debt because I had land. Its like gold to me; why should I sell it? he says.

 Swapan Barui is with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. His family holds around 93 bighas and is into farming, but has decided to sell the land.

 We have a reasonably big holding and do enjoy food security, but nothing beyond that. The Tata project will transform the area, Barui argues.

 If Singur symbolises the big debate in Bengal ? farm versus factory ? Das and Barui represent the two sides. Its perhaps no accident that Baruis family is close to the CPM and Dass to the Trinamul Congress.

 The issue is the governments decision to acquire farmland for Tata Motors small-car plant in Singur. Its from the mouza of Barui and Das, Beraberi, that the land acquisition process kicked off with 165 acres.

 The CPM is showcasing the Baruis to encourage landowners to sell. Barui had shared the dais with industries minister Nirupam Sen at a rally in Singur two weeks ago.

 He admits the familys proximity to the CPM, but insists the decision to sell land is economic logic, plain and simple. He is convinced that industrialisation alone can provide the necessary push to the regions economy and improve lifestyles.

 We wont have to live with the uncertainties of agriculture; the compensation money will change our lives, Barui is confident.

 But 63-year-old Das, who lives with his brothers Biswanath and Manik under the same roof but cultivates his own land, is ready to pick holes in that argument. He and Manik argue they lack the skills to benefit from the Tata project.

 Land is a long-term asset and our main strength. We know the government will give us money if we give up our land. But whatever the amount, we cant keep that for life, says Manik, who grows rice, jute and potato on his own two-bigha plot.

 He has another question: Okay, I shall get some money, but what happens to the bargadars and landless labourers? Government records suggest Singur block has around 3,000 registered bargadars and over 15,000 agricultural labourers.

 Manik earns Rs 25,000-30,000 a year from his land and can afford some luxuries ? a telephone, a television set and a refrigerator. He and his neighbours, such as Prasenjit and Bappa, are surprised at the governments decision to hand over the area ? with a fertile soil and round-the-year water from canals and tube-wells ? for industrialisation.

 The government says it cannot dictate where an investor would set up his plant. It has other arguments too, such as land sharks have already bought prime plots near the Durgapur Expressway or the land being acquired is either fallow or produces only one crop.

 But data from the Bureau of Applied Economics and Statistics suggest that of the 10,437 hectares of farmland in Singur block, 9,099 hectares produce more than one crop. The yield of major crops ? paddy, wheat, jute and potato ? in Singur puts it among the top few blocks in the district.

 The question is whether the productivity is enough to transform our lives, says Barui. He also talks of the vagaries of farming: crop failure, floods, over-production leading to poor price realisation.

 But Manik argues: They are rich people and have huge landholdings. Were small farmers. They can sustain themselves with the compensation; we cannot.

 He says the families of over 2,000 farmers, an equal number of landless labourers, 300 bargadars and around 500 vegetable traders depend on agriculture for their livelihood in the five mouzas identified for land acquisition.

 All of us will join hands to protect the farmland. Even the women will come out to protect the land, says Das.

 Barui isnt worried. Theyll realise their mistake very soon and offer land for the project, he says.

 The jury is still out on the big debate.

 Back to textbook police

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The human resource development ministry today set up a five-member panel to look at the controversial Hindi textbooks that had recently sparked a furore in Parliament. 

 A review committee under the chairpersonship of Professor Yashpal has been set up in view of the misgivings expressed in both Houses of Parliament regarding the contents of the textbooks in Hindi published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the ministry said.

 The committees terms of reference include review and recommendation for improvements or revisions that may be considered necessary.

 It will submit its report by September 30. 

 On the panel are Mrinal Miri, chairperson of the National Monitoring Committee set up by Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe), Rajya Sabha MP Nirmala Deshpandey, Hindi writer Krishan Sobti, Kannada author U.R. Ananthamurthy and Ashok Vajpeyi, a former vice-chancellor of Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University.

 Alleging that the NCERT books contain unconstitutional words and verses by Naxalite poets, BJP MPs including former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj and Ravi Shankar Prasad had repeatedly stalled proceedings in the Rajya Sabha during the monsoon session. 

 They also put a Class XII history textbook authored by Bipan Chandra in their line of fire. The MPs alleged that Lokmanya Tilak, Aurobindo Ghosh, Bipin Chandra Pal and Lajpat Rai had been referred to as terrorists. 

 Chandra, however, had used the words militant nationalists to describe the freedom fighters and the book, in any case, is being phased out. New Class XII history textbooks will be ready by the next academic session.

 For more than a decade, successive governments at the Centre and in the states have been setting up textbook review committees under pressure from one political party or the other. In 1993, the HRD ministry had instituted a panel to particularly look at history textbooks in BJP-ruled states.

 Almost a decade later, during the NDA regime, Murli Manohar Joshi, the then HRD minister, and J.S. Rajput, a former NCERT director, came under attack for putting together a distorted school curriculum and flawed textbooks.

 After taking charge as HRD minister, Arjun reconstituted Cabe, which in turn set up a committee to review textbooks introduced during Joshis tenure. 

 The committee submitted a report that found the textbooks unfit for classrooms. A new curriculum, a new syllabus and new textbooks followed.

 The latest ruckus in the Rajya Sabha has shown that the battlelines are as sharply drawn.

 The BJP finds the use of words like chamar and bhangi unconstituti onal. The book, however, clarifies that the words, though unconstitutional, have been used in a particular context. 

 The BJP MPs have also objected to a poem by Avtar Singh Paasha because he was a Naxalite and the inclusion of M.F. Husains biography because they have a problem with his paintings of goddesses in the nude.

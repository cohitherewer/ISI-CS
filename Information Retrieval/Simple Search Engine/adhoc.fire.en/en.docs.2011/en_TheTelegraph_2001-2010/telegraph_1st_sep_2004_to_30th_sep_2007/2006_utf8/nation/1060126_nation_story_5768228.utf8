 Tricked, Left in retail ritual

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, Jan. 25: Yesterdays cabinet green light to FDI in retail has left the CPM and CPI making noises about organising protests, but the move suggested the Centre had figured out a strategy for getting its way with its communist allies at least some of the time.

 Left leaders today alleged they were not consulted on the cabinet decision to let in foreign single-brand stores like Armani or Louis Vuitton. CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: We are opposed to FDI in retail. Our party position is clear on this.

 He countered the Centres argument about allowing foreign capital only in branded goods by saying: It (branded goods) is a loose term. Anything can be branded. We would like the government to specify the items.

 Both the CPM and the CPI ? which will discuss the matter with Left Front allies Forward Bloc and RSP on Friday ? have appealed to the public to protest the governments move.

 The Centres game plan, however, seems clear: it will go on using cabinet decisions to implement liberalisation policies that do not require a mandate from Parliament.

 For instance, the Centre introduced 74 per cent FDI in telecom and slashed the provident fund interest rate in the teeth of strong opposition from the Left because it didnt have to go to Parliament with these decisions. It was, however, forced to hold back the pension bill because the Left said it would oppose it in Parliament.

 Senior Left leaders realise they can hope to win mostly on the floor of Parliament. They also realise that when they cant win, their protests will have to be limited to press statements and resolutions criticising the government. Political compulsions prevent them from withdrawing support.

 The Centre, on its part, has been humouring its Left allies by giving in to them once in a while. It jettisoned the plan to divest shares in Bhel after the communists quit the UPA-Left coordination committee in protest and kept away for over two months.

 The Lefts clamour today got little further than threats of public protests and press statements explaining that the move might trigger backdoor entry by big retail chains.

 You will hurt employment opportunities and peoples livelihood if you open up this sector, Yechury said.

 The message from CPM-ruled Bengal, however, was different.

 Party state secretary Anil Biswas said the CPM has no problem welcoming foreign capital in Bengals wholesale sector as long as two provisos were followed. One, the FDI must be in perishable goods; and two, the marketing system will be under state control.

 Srinagar, Jan. 16: Jammu and Kashmir police today said they have shot dead the mastermind behind the Diwali-eve blasts that killed over 60 people in the national capital.

 The police also said another conspirator was injured in the north Kashmir encounter that followed specific information from Delhi police.

 Kashmir zone inspector-general K. Rajendra said Abdullah Bhai, a senior commander of the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the injured rebel, Ali Mohammad, were cornered in Khour, a village in Baramulla district, 40 km from Srinagar.

 On specific information passed on to us from Delhi police, a well-coordinated operation was launched here by the state police and troops of the Rashtriya Rifles. The operation in Khour village started early Monday morning. We have killed Abdullah Bhai alias Abu Haziafa, a top Lashkar-e-Toiba commander, and another terrorist, identified as Ali Mohammad alias Abu Zarar, was injured and searches are on to locate him, he said.

 Abdullah Bhai was the chief conspirator of the Delhi blasts, the officer added.

 The bombs were set off last October in two bustling Delhi markets as people shopped days before Diwali.

 Rajendra said Abdullah Bhai and Ali Mohammad were hiding in a house. They were challenged to surrender, but... started firing indiscriminately on the surrounding troops.

 Abdullah Bhais killing came as police in Bangalore, the countrys tech hub, said they had arrested a second suspect, also a Lashkar member, in connection with the shooting at the Indian Institute of Science last month in which a professor was killed.

 In Kashmir, the police said Abdullah Bhai, Ali Mohammad and another Pakistani had tasked arrested Kashmir resident Tariq Ahmad Dar, who worked as a sales executive with a multinational company, to work for them as he often travelled to Delhi.

 In Delhi, joint commissioner (special cell) Karnal Singh said Abdullah Bhai was traced to Khour by a police team sent to Srinagar to hunt for the terrorists behind the blasts.

 Singh said one AK-56 rifle, 25 live cartridges, a hand grenade, a radio set, a mobile phone and two SIM cards were seized by the police team.

 Uniform ban to check militants

 Jammu (PTI): The Jammu and Kashmir government has banned the buying, selling and storing of army uniforms by unauthorised parties in the district to prevent militants from using them.

 An order, issued on Wednesday by district magistrate 

 Hardish Kumar, said: No unauthorised person shall 

 purchase, store, stitch or sell army combat dress cloth 

 and ready-made combat dress.

 The order requires even authorised outlets to inform the nearest police station within seven days of any sale. Besides, they have to maintain a register where all transactions must be recorded and they can sell their products only to armed forces personnel.

 The order shall remain in force for two months.

 HC notice on Delhi schools

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court issued 

 notices to the city government and the Municipal Corporation 

 of Delhi on Wednesday in response to a PIL on the indifference 

 and connivance caused by the mushrooming of unrecognised 

 private schools in the capital.

 Petitioner Ashok Aggarwal, a lawyer representing voluntary organisation Social Jurist, complained that there were about 10,000 such unrecognised schools in different parts of Delhi where about six lakh children studied.

 The PIL alleged the schools, besides jeopardising the academic career of the children, were functioning in unsafe and unhygenic conditions, disregarding the childrens safety and well-being.

 Temple clash

 Jammu (PTI): Six union leaders of the 

 pithoos, who ferry pilgrims on the donkey tracks 

 to the Vaishnodevi temple, were arrested on Wednesday, a 

 day after 400 of them clashed with police.

 The protest was against the induction of two more battery cars on the Adhkunwari-Bhawan route to ferry pilgrims to the shrine.

 Dead promoted

 Kuala Lumpur (PTI): The Malaysian government 

 has posthumously promoted an ethnic Indian soldier, whose 

 Islamic burial against his Hindu widows wishes whipped 

 up a storm in December. Moorthy Maniam, 36, was promoted 

 from corporal to sergeant.

 Hooch tragedy

 Lucknow (PTI): Seven persons died after 

 consuming spurious liquor in separate incidents in the past 

 three days, police said. About 15 others, taken ill after 

 consuming the liquor, have been hospitalised.

About 6,000 doctors from India and abroad will 

 attend the five-day National Gynaecology Conference in Kochi 

 from Friday. It will focus on pregnancy-related disorders 

 and child mortality.

 Freak rain looms

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 10: Rains that cooled northern India on Wednesday are likely to move east towards Jharkhand, Bihar and Bengal, Met officials said.

 The weather systems are already active over these regions, particularly eastern Uttar Pradesh, and over the next 24 hours, the quantity of rain will increase, an official at the Indian Meteorological Department said.

 Rain over Calcutta and other parts of Bengal is likely over the next two days, after which the weather system would weaken, officials said.

 The spell of freak weather on Wednesday that brought relief from the heat in the north was the result of upper air cyclonic circulation systems prevailing in areas of southwest Rajasthan adjoining Gujarat, which interacted with the existing pre-monsoon circulation pattern over central India. Madhya Pradesh has had heavier rainfall than the rest of the region.

 Several weather systems became active around the same time. That is why there was light rain all over northern India today and the temperatures dipped 5 to 6 degrees Celsius below normal, an official said. 

 February was unusually hot. The rains have balanced this and the temperatures which have dipped are now normal March temperatures, he added.

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today ran a House without the Opposition and said he missed them. 

 The BJP-led boycott of the days proceedings, announced yesterday, was in protest against the partisan behaviour of the Speaker. 

 Some Opposition members covered their mouth with black scarves to make the point that the chair was gagging them. The MPs sat on dharna under Mahatma Gandhis statue outside the Parliament main gate.

 Inside, MPs of the Congress-led coalition, the Left and groups like the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party sat in a big block of empty rows. Legislators in the House expressed resentment over the Opposition action, condemning, in particular, the aspersions cast against the Speaker. 

 National Conference MP Omar Abdullah said the Speakers office was above politics. By targeting the Speaker, they are weakening Parliament, he said.

 But the legislators also struck a conciliatory note, speaking about the importance of the Opposition in a parliamentary democracy and urging their protesting colleagues to join the proceedings. 

 Question hour was put aside for a while when Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Devendra Prasad Yadav raised the boycott and other parties, too, wanted to have a say.

 Chatterjee set the tone, even conceding that he could have erred somewhere to trigger the Opposition protest. I may have committed a mistake, someone else may have committed a mistake. Among friends we can always sort it out, he said.

 Chatterjee said it was a very painful situation for him that the entire Opposition was absent. More than once, he urged them to reconsider their decision. They are all our colleagues, he said. We can work together.

 When question hour resumed, the Speaker postponed questions listed by absent Opposition MPs. A calling attention motion moved by the BJP was also postponed, perhaps as a peace gesture. 

 Yesterday, the National Democratic Alliance had complained that the Speaker pushed through major items on the days agenda without a discussion in the House.

 Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee said he was extremely sad. Differences with the government were understandable but it was painful that the Speaker was the target, the Congress leader said. His own party had complete trust in the chair, he added.

 Mukherjee said he would call up Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani and appeal to the Opposition parties to return.

 The Telugu Desam Party, aligned with the NDA on many issues, also condemned the boycott.

 Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 8: A Christian school in Kerala has allowed Muslim girls to wear headscarves, ending a tiff between the Muslim Students Federation (MSF) and the school management.

 Activists of the MSF, owing allegiance to the Indian Union Muslim League, gheraoed vice-principal Biju Jose at Little Flower Higher Secondary School, Nilambur, in the Muslim-dominated Malappuram district on July 21, demanding permission for girls to wear scarves on campus.

 Fr Jojo Joseph, the assistant parish priest, said: Although we condemn the way the local lads tried to raise the issue, our parishioners who own the school felt we should lend a healing touch. Not out of fear but for the sake of religious amity and with due respect to Muslim sentiments.

 He said the issue was debated at the parish general body, which has a member from each of the 600 families that come under the Syro-Malabar Church.

 Not all were for diluting the dress code. But elders prevailed, saying the rule can be bent for a good cause in troubled times.

 At the 25-year-old school, boys wear maroon trousers and white shirts, tie, belt, maroon socks and black shoes while girls have different codes for different age groups. Those in the higher secondary wear ash pajama, ash-striped churidar, ash overcoat and black shoes.

 The practice among Muslim girls who wear scarves to the school was to remove them at the gate.

 MSF state general secretary P. Lamrath, who inspired the gherao, was not available for comment.

 His grouse was against school authorities asking Muslim girls to remove the scarf the moment they entered the school premises. This amounts to violation of fundamental rights. Denying the right to follow ones religion is a transgression of religious freedom, he said.

 The school got a new manager, Fr George Njeralakatt, formerly vicar-general of the high-range Manathavady diocese, just two months ago. 

 He had begun the year with a secular assembly, reading out excerpts from the Bible, Quran and the Ramayana, calling for a better understanding among different faiths

 Fr Njeralakatt was away in Mangalore, attending a retreat. He could not be contacted.

 The school belongs to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the prominent Catholic segment in Kerala, led by Cardinal Mar Varkey Vithayathil.

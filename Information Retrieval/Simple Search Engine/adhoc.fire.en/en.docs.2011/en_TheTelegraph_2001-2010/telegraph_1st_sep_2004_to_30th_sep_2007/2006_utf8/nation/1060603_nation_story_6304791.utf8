 Uma visits Sangh hub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 2: A day after a terrorist bid on the RSS sanctorum, Uma Bharti underlined her close association with the Sangh parivar by visiting the Nagpur headquarters.

 Uma, who formed the Bharatiya Jan Shakti Party after her suspension from the BJP, met some Sangh functionaries before leaving for some programmes in Wardha district of Maharashtra.

 It was a courtesy visit. She was concerned for us because there has been a long association, said a Mumbai-based RSS functionary.

 Apart from Uma, senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde, state BJP chief Nitin Gadkari and Maharashtra textile minister Satish Chaturvedi had visited Nagpur last night, said Shard Joshi of RSS.

 Munde was in Nagpur when he received the news of Rahuls hospitalisation.

 Sources in the Maharashtra police said that the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) and crime department officials have been able to establish that the three attackers killed in the police encounter yesterday, were Pakistani nationals.

 That in many ways establishes the suspicion about the Lashkar-e-Toibas involvement, said a senior ATS official.

 But we will be more sure once the lab tests establish the identity of the 5 kg of explosive powder found on them. It could either be RDX or plastic. The Lashkar mostly uses RDX. The tests will show whether there is any connection to be established between the recent haul at Aurangabad and this one, said the source.

 The three attackers have been identified as Afzal Ahmad Butt and Abu al Kalam Alad, both from Lahore and Mohammad Usman Habib from Gujranwala in Pakistan.

 A diary found on them had their names written in Urdu as well as their phone numbers back home. It is confirmed now that they came from across the border, said the official.

 The police are searching for local contacts of the three militants in and around Nagpur.

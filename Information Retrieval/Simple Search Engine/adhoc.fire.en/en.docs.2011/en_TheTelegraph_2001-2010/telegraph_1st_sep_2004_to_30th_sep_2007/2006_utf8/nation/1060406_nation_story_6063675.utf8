 Third stepdown for Sonia

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, April 5: Sonia Gandhi has resigned for the third time ? now as the chairperson of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust whose first head was Mahatma Gandhi.

 The erstwhile Vajpayee government had tried hard to remove Sonia from this trust on the ground that she knew nothing about the freedom movement and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. But the move was opposed by R.L. Bhatia, a veteran Congress MP (who is now the governor of Kerala) and chairman of the local management committee of the trust, on the plea that its first chairperson was the Congress president and the members were the chief minister and governor of Punjab.

 Bhatia argued that there was no need to upset the structure of the act, legislated by the Nehru government. He had accused the NDA government of freezing a Rs 25-lakh grant to the trust because Sonia headed it.

 Although the Congress did not officially comment on Sonias latest resignation, sources said the party president was consulting legal brains to find out which of the bodies and trusts she either heads or patronises or is a member of would qualify as an office of profit. 

 The current law, the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959, which led to Sonias resignation as MP and chairperson of the National Advisory Council (NAC) ? is silent on what constitutes an office of profit. But the thumb-rule is that any institution which is partially funded by the government or draws on its resources will be deemed as one.

 The sources said Sonia is determined to quit any of the institutions or trusts she is associated with if these are found to be even remotely linked to the government. She is the chairperson of the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Trust, the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the Indian Council for Child Welfare Trust. 

 She is also president of the Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital Society, member of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library Society and patron of the Nehru Trust for Cambridge University and the Round Square (International Group of Schools), UK.

 A Congress functionary said: Each of these is being examined to see which could be exempt under the law and which not. If these cannot be exempted, she will quit the posts. He refused to comment in which category the Jallianwala Bagh trust would be included.

 Sonias objective in relinquishing one post after another is to reinforce the political point that for a person who cocked a snook at the PMs post, such offices were inconsequential, the sources said. 

 Her mind works on a single track these days and that is to silence the campaign that the BJP started. Unfortunately, our party did not adequately answer the charges when it had to, so the president has taken the battle on her shoulders, they added. 

 A general secretary said her latest renunciations had impacted Assam voters positively, though he was unsure if the goodwill would translate into votes. 

 The government will separately assess which of the positions held by the Congress president could be listed as offices of profit when it drafts amendments to the law.

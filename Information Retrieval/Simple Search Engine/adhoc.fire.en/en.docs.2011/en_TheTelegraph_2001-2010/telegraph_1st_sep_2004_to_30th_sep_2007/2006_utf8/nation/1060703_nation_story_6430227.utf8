 Left going to town with rift over hike

 - Cong faces opposition within and outside over faltering common-man plank

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 2: Left leaders meeting here on Tuesday will decide on a road map of agitations against price rise centred around the monsoon session of Parliament and advertise the disconnect with the UPA despite Sonia Gandhis efforts to retain her partys aam aadmi plank.

 Ironically enough, the gap between the Left and the Congress-led government on economic policies is once again in the forefront when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is seeking to make his most eloquent party-for-the-poor statement by spending the weekend in Vidarbhas farmer-suicide belt.

 Last weeks meeting of the Congress Working Committee in which the partys leadership expressed concern over price rise has been brushed aside by the Left parties which do not see much consequence in its deliberations. 

 The Congress is shedding crocodile tears, is what Left leaders unanimously say. The Congress-led government was actively pursuing policies that were causing the price rise and the Congress Working Committees expression of concern does not chime with that reality.

 This is in sharp contrast to evidence within the Congress.

 Disenchantment with economic policies were expressed at the working committee meeting itself. One of Sonia Gandhis special invitees to the meeting criticised the governments decision to offload Nalcos equity.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram was interrupted while lecturing on the growth rate and the performance of the economy. He was almost shouted down by a clutch of participants. 

 Ajit Jogi, S.S. Surjewala and Devendranath Dwivedi emphasised that the UPA had swept to power largely on the aam admi (common man) plank. Softpedalling economic policies that are contributing to price rise will mean that the Left will be handed a stick to beat the government with.

 For the Left, price rise and policies of disinvesting in profitable public sector units are issues that are dearest to their programme. The issues also help them sharply define their role as an opposition despite being the governments strongest prop. 

 The BJP, the Left is convinced, cannot take up the issues with same fervour.

 The Left parties agitation is likely to be two-pronged. 

 They will focus on emba-rrassing the government in Parliament after the monsoon session begins on July 24. The protests are not as likely to hit the streets outside Bengal and Kerala.

 But the trade unions associated with the Left parties would draw up a separate programme of protests that will be dovetailed into the overall strategy. 

 Left leaders say it is still early to think in terms of major action such as an all-India general strike, not least because their own state governments in Bengal and Kerala are not as kindly disposed to such forms of protest as they were in the past.

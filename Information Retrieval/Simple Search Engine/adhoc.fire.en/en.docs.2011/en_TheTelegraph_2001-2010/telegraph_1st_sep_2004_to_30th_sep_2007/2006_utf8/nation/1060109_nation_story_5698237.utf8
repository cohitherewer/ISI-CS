 Shape up, Air-India tells crew

 Mumbai, Jan. 8 (PTI): In a couple of months from now, Air-India cabin crew may need more than just identification cards to board the aircraft ? they need to have a lean body.

 As the airline prepares for competition from foreign and domestic airlines, the national carrier has asked its 1,600-odd cabin crew members to shed flab within two months or forget life in the skies. The ultimatum is not just for air hostesses and flight stewards, but pilots too.

 Those who are overweight, will be grounded (assigned ground duties). But this is not a new decision. The weight control rules are there for quite a long time, Air-India general manager S. Venkat said. But this time we are going to be more strict.

 Sources in the airline said Air-India has already circulated notices to its cabin crew indicating the deadline by which they have to trim down.

 The exercise is part of the airlines efforts to improve the appearance and fitness levels of cabin staff.

 New Delhi, Aug. 6: Delhi police claimed to have arrested the man who murdered an entire family, including five children, in the capital last week.

 After questioning over 200 people, the inter-state cell of the crime branch yesterday arrested Sanjay Rathore, nephew of Om Prakash, the head of the family he had allegedly murdered.

 Om Prakash, 45, his wife Santosh, 40, daughters Manju, 19, Preeti, 18, Dolly, 16, Puja, 14, and son Anuj, 7, were killed stabbed and gashed by a sharp weapon on the night of July 30-31 in their north Delhi apartment.

 We believe Rathore used a butchers knife to slit the throats of each of the seven victims, said a senior police official.

 He had also tried to burn the bodies in an attempt to destroy any evidence, the police claimed.

 Investigators had initially focused on a property dispute angle. But unable to find any lead, they delved into the familys recent history.

 We found out that the accused used to stay with the murdered family till some time back, assistant commissioner of police Muktesh Chander said.

 Rathore, the police said, worked in a job placement agency. While staying with the family, he started courting his cousin Preeti. An enraged Om Prakash threw him out of the house.

 Ever since this humiliation, Rathore had been planning the murders. The fact that even Preeti who he believed had shown interest in him did not stand by him, turned his obsession into cold revenge.

 It was a crime of passion. These are the most dangerous kind of killers, said Chander. He could have killed again, to save himself.

 Senior police officers say they cannot remember the last time an entire family was murdered in the capital.

 The police first started suspecting Rathore, who had disappeared after the murder, when some neighbours informed them that the accused had been hovering around the victims house on that evening.

 Rathore was arrested late yesterday and, on intense interrogation, confessed to the crime, the police said.

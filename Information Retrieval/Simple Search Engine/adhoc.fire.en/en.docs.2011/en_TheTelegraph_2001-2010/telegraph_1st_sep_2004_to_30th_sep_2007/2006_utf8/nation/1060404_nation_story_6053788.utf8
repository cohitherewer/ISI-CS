 Test on May 8

 New Delhi, April 3: Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha seat vacated by Sonia Gandhi after the office of profit controversy, will go to the polls on May 8. 

 The Congress president had promised to contest again from the same constituency when she put in her papers. She is expected to win without much competition.

 The Election Commission said counting would be held on May 11. The bypoll to Deeg Assembly constituency in Rajasthan will be held the same day.

 The poll schedule said notification will be issued on April 13 and the last date for filing nomination will be April 20. Scrutiny will take place the following day. The last date for withdrawal is April 24. 

 The poll panel said the decision to hold the twin bypolls had been taken as elections to the 10 Lok Sabha seats vacated by the cash-for-query expulsions had been barred till July by the Supreme Court

 With the announcement of bypoll schedule, the model code has come into force. 

 Neither the BJP nor the Samajwadi Party has yet decided on fielding a candidate from Rae Bareli. But BSP chief Mayavati has declined to field any, saying the Samajwadi Party and the BJP are her prime enemies.

 Uma Bharti, recently expelled from the BJP, will field a candidate against Sonia and has sought the BJPs support.

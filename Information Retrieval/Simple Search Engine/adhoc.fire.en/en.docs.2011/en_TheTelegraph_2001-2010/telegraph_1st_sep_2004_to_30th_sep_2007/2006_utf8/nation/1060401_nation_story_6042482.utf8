 No status shield for rapists

 Jodhpur, March 31 (PTI): The punishment for rape must depend on the conduct of an accused, state and age of the victim and gravity of the act, not on the social status of the offender, Rajasthan High Court has ruled.

 Declining to reduce the sentence awarded to Mahaveer and Balveer, who were involved in the gangrape of a 25-year-old married woman, Justice R.P. Vyas said the measure of punishment could not depend on the social status of the victim or the accused.

 It must depend upon the conduct of the accused, the state and age of the sexually assaulted female and the gravity of the criminal act, the court said.

 The additional sessions judge of Nohar, Hanumangarh district, had sentenced them to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 each.

 The accused challenged the judgment in the high court on the ground that they were well-respected people and their children were about to get married. They said they were the sole earning members of their families, besides contending that the victim had lodged an FIR two days later.

 But the court said: Crimes of violence upon women need to be severely dealt with.

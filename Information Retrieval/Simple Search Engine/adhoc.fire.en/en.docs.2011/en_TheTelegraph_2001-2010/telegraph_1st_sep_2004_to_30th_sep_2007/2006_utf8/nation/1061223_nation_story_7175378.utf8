 New Delhi, Dec. 22: Former Delhi councillor Sharda Jain was today sentenced to life in jail by a Delhi trial court for the murder of her colleague and lover Atma Ram Gupta four years back.

 Jains brother Raj Kumar and four other accomplices, who helped in the kidnapping and murder, were also handed life terms. Gupta was a senior councillor in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in August 2002. Three Uttar Pradesh policemen, convicted of destruction of evidence, have been sentenced to three years in jail. They have also been fined Rs 5,000 each. 

 Judge Bharat Parashar said the murder and kidnapping didnt fall in the rarest of rare category and, therefore, did not warrant the death penalty. 

 Jain is believed to have plotted the murder after she discovered that Gupta shared an intimate relationship with another councillor, Memwati Barwalla.

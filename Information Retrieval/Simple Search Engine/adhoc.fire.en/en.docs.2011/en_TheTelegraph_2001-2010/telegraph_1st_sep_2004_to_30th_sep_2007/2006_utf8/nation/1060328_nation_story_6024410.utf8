The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 The missing movie link

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, March 27: Nilofar, 13, and Nargis, 9, had never been to the cinema. When they finally did, father Mehraj-ud-Din had to tear the girls away from Rang de Basanti before half-time because he couldnt hold them down in their seats or stop their whoops of delight.

 I looked around wondering what others sitting in the theatre would be thinking about the ignorance of my daughters, but that is the truth. They had such a wonderful experience for the first time, no doubt full of embarrassment for me and my wife, the 45-year-old businessman said. 

 As the rest of the country moves on to multiplexes, a whole generation born in Kashmir after the militancy ? and now in their teens or tweens ? is growing up without ever experiencing the thrill of watching a film on the big screen in a dark theatre, with hundreds of others.

 The experience of the wide screen and Dolby surround sound was something my daughters had never experienced. It was really tough controlling them in their seats when they heard the sound of the bullets being fired or when they heard one of their favourite songs in the reel life of the cinema, Mehraj said.

 As they left the hall in Jammu ? where the businessman had taken his family on a rare trip last week, and where the girls first wish had been to see the cinema ? the parents were relieved but also sorry for their children, for whom films only mean TV.

 Cinemas, and there were quite a few in the Valley which was also a favourite with filmmakers scouting for a location, were the first casualty of militancy. Two ? Palladium in the city centre Lal Chowk and The Broadway in Badami Bagh ? were gutted in fires and the rest had to pull down shutters on militants orders. 

 Khayam, one of the more popular theatres, has been converted into a charitable hospital. 

 Firdous, in the downtown Hawal locality, is occupied by the paramilitary CRPF and converted into a makeshift barrack and battalion headquarters.

 Regal, in the upscale Residency Road area, was re-opened for a short while in 1998 but forced shut again after a grenade attack. 

 Naaz and Shah Cinema have been closed since the early 1990s. Hoardings have now appeared saying another charitable hospital is coming up soon in place of Shah.

 Only Neelam, situated close to the civil secretariat complex, still shows films after it was reopened in 1998. 

 It has been running one show a day, but fear of violence keeps even the biggest film buffs away.

 Bollywood remains popular ? Aamir and Shah Rukh Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Kajol and Rani Mukherjee are favourites here, as elsewhere ? but films are watched only on CDs or on television in the safety of homes. The cinema experience, with popcorn and cola, is all but over.

 Even with some improvement in the ground situation in the Valley, the trade of cinema halls seems to be finally over. It involves heavy investment and the dark clouds of uncertainty in Kashmir would dissuade even the toughest investor from venturing into this business, said a cinema owner who asked not to be named. 

 Nilofar and Nargis have a long wait before they can go to the cinema again.

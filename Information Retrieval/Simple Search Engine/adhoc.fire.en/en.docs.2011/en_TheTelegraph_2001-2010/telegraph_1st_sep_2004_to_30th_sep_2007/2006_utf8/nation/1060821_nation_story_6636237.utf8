 Envoy buzz gets louder

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: Delhis diplomatic circuit is awaiting the arrival of Pakistans new high commissioner. The incumbent, Aziz Ahmad Khan, is on his way out and speculation is rife about his replacement. 

 Pakistans top man in Delhi has always been a closely watched figure among the diplomatic corps. So all eyes are now on Islamabad. Reports from across the border suggest a choice between Shahid Malik and Zamir Akram, both of whom are career diplomats.

 Neither is new to Delhi. Malik, now Pakistans high commissioner in Canada, served as deputy high commissioner in India in the mid-nineties under Riaz Khokar. An introvert like his former boss, he comes from a political family he is related to Senate chairperson Wasim Sajjad. Sources said he might be using his political ties to get the India slot. Reports from Islamabad say President Pervez Musharraf has almost cleared Malik.

 Akram, brother of Pakistans well-known envoy to the UN, Munir Akram, has had long stints with multilateral forums. Unlike Malik, Akram is known for his colourful lifestyle. In the early nineties, when he was first secretary in the high commission in Delhi, he, along with colleague Shafqat Kakakhel, became popular in the capitals party circles and was often seen in clubs and pubs. 

 The two made an effective team that made detailed presentations in Islamabad on decisions taken by Indias Prime Minister. Zamir is now an additional secretary in Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Azizs office. He has also served in Nepal and Washington.

 Aziz Ahmad Khans term will end on September 15. Islamabad will have to inform Delhi about his replacement soon to get clearance. Officials said the high commissioner, already on an extension, is unlikely to stay on any further. 

 The names of former deputy high commissioner Jaleel Abbas Jilani and Pakistans envoy to Japan, Kamran Niaz, have also been doing the rounds, but the choice at this point seems limited to Malik and Zamir.

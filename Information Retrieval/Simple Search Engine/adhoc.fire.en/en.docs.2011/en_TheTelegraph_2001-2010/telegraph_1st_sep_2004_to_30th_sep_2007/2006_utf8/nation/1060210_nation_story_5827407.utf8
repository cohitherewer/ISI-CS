 BJP eyes long tie-up

 Kumaraswamy (top), Naidu: Looking ahead 

 Bangalore, Feb. 9: A day after its new coalition government sailed through a floor test, the BJP declared it was looking ahead to a long-term alliance with partner Janata Dal (Secular).

 BJP vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu today said here that his party wanted to make the coalition a success and, with its experience of having run the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, there was no reason why it couldnt.

 Chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, too, favoured a lasting friendship, Naidu told reporters. We are happy with the proposal and are willing to work together on a long-term basis.

 The new government won the trust vote 138-66 late last night in the House of 224. One reason for the overwhelming support for Kumaraswamy is that the MLAs, especially the independents, are anxious to avoid a mid-term poll.

 Naidu took a swipe at the Congress, saying its government had collapsed because it had failed to stick to the coalition dharma. The new ministry would face no such problems, he was confident.

 The BJP has had the experience of running a 23-party coalition at the Centre without controversies and conflict of ideologies, Naidu said. 

 His party colleague and deputy chief minister, B.S. Yediyurappa, said the state cabinet would be expanded in the next four or five days.

 The cabinet would be expanded in phases. There may be a slight delay because of the sudden demise of chief minister Kumaraswamys father-in-law last night.

 The 18 BJP ministers are to take over the portfolios the Dal (S) held in the previous government, while the 16 Dal (S) ministers will handle the Congress ministries.

 Both Kumaraswamy and Yediyurappa are scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his cabinet colleagues, besides BJP president Rajnath Singh, on February 13.

 Singh, Hasina: Poll 

 notes 

 New Delhi, June 20: Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina will call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow to exchange notes in the run-up to the Bangladesh elections.

 Hasina, who has taken time off from a pre-poll campaign to collect an award from an NGO in Calcutta on Saturday, had requested a meeting with Singh.

 Hasina heads the 14-party opposition alliance in Bangladesh. The combines supporters launched a campaign on Dhaka streets against any move by the Khaleda Zia government to influence elections.

 Hasina will also be visiting Ajmer Sharief, believed to be a regular fixture on her itinerary during her India visits. She was also planning to spend a night in Jaipur after her Ajmer Sharief visit but has now decided to fly back to Delhi. Hasina will also meet defence minister Pranab Mukherjee. 

 Sources said her visit should be seen in the context of Delhis engagements with the political leadership in Dhaka.

 India has not had very good relations with the Khaleda regime, which feels ties cannot improve as long as Delhi continues to believe that Dhaka abets terror.

 Khaleda, whose five-year term ends this October, chose to visit Delhi only this March. The Bangladesh general elections are due to be held by next January under a caretaker administration.

 Excited Infosys warms to Andhra call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy and Dharam: IT war

 Bangalore, April 3: As crumbling infrastructure sours Bangalores marriage with the IT industry, Hyderabad has pounced like an interested lover and found the lady willing to be wooed.

 The Andhra Pradesh chief minister today arrived at the countrys software capital to explain why Hyderabad, with its better roads and a government that acts fast, is just the place where the hi-tech sector should plan its expansion.

 Infrastructure in Andhra Pradesh is better than any other state in the country, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy told industry captains without mentioning Bangalores rundown infrastructure that has prompted some of the infotech biggies to take flight.

 Reddy got immediate applause from his audience. Its good that Andhra Pradesh is doing what its doing. Because frankly, Hyderabad has possibly the best infrastructure for IT in India today, Infosys chief financial officer T.V. Mohandas Pai said after the meeting organised by Apinvest, a state government body.

 Roads are very good. There is a very pro-active CM. Lot of investors are coming in. If you go to Hyderabad today, you see a sense of newness, as if the city is new. There is a great drive to improve the IT industry. So we are excited, Pai said.

 He said exciting things were also happening in Calcutta and Jaipur, where the governments were rolling out the red carpet for IT because it brings high-quality jobs.

 In contrast, Pai said, the morale of the IT industry in Bangalore is low. 

 The battlelines that were drawn sometime ago are now becoming clearer. Referring to the public spat between Infosys chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda last year, Pai said: We had torrid times in Bangalore when people told us that we are not wanted, that they... see us as alien creatures.

 Murthys suggestions on improving Bangalores infrastructure had Gowda questioning Infosyss contribution to the state. It led to Murthy quitting as chairman of Bangalore International Airport Ltd.

 Then chief minister Dharam Singh, who toiled to iron out the IT turf, pleaded with the Infosys boss to withdraw his resignation, but he would not be placated.

 Asked if he thought Karnataka was losing out to its neighbour, Pai said he would rather say India was gaining. It is good to have competition between the states. Five years ago, Bangalore had accounted for 65 per cent of the total IT capacity. Now, it has come down to 25 per cent. This trend is going to accelerate, he said.

 Look, lets admit one thing. We are the people who invest and create... quality jobs. We are the ones who market. Any place which makes you feel wanted, we will go for expansion.

 At the meeting, Reddy trumpeted the feedback he had got from industry leaders that his governments took decisions faster than other states.

 Reeling out statistics, he said Andhra recorded 65 per cent growth in IT and IT-enabled services last year. Reddy added how his state had nudged past Bangalore in the race for the FAB City project, which will bring companies manufacturing chips for computers, cellphones and other electronic gadgets in one place.

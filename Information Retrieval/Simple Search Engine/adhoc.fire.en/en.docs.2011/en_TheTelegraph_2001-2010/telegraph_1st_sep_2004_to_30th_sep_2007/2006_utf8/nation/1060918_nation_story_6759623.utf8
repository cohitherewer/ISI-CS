 Castro talks of Nehru, reforms 

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Recalling old times: Singh, Castro

Havana, Sept. 17: Prime 

 Minister Manmohan Singh met the ailing Fidel Castro for 

 nearly 40 minutes late on Saturday night.

 The one-on-one meeting, which began at 11 pm, took place in a room inside the Cuban Communist Partys office at the Place de la Revolution here. Parts of the office have obviously been transformed into an emergency medical centre, where Castro is recovering. 

 Castro was said to have spoken to Singh nostalgically about Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The 80-year-old communist leader last visited India in 1983, when he passed on the NAM leadership to Indira Gandhi. 

 Castro asked Singh about Indias economic reforms and told him about Cubas economic policies. Cuba might be poor in economic terms, he is said to have told Singh, but rich in economic resources. The two countries, according to him, could cooperate in agriculture and non-conventional energy. Cuba could also learn from India new developments in information technology. 

 Singh was thus one of only four leaders who met Castro during the NAM summit the other three being UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, Venezuelan President and Castros ideological protege, Hugo Chavez, and the Algerian President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. 

 A day before the NAM summit began, Argentinian writer-politician, Miguel Bonasso, who is a personal friend of Castros, met him for 90 minutes in what was the longest meeting the Cuban leader has had with anyone since his intestinal surgery on July 30. 

 Bonasso wrote that he found Castro sitting in bed, with a white table and a mobile phone in front of him. A thick book was on the table: A Hundred Hours with Fidel. Castro was apparently going through the revised, and yet unpublished, book by Ignacio Ramonet.

 Castro stood up to give the Argentine writer a hug. I lost 41 pounds, Castro told Bonasso, but Im putting the weight back on. Nearly half of what I lost.

 Earlier last evening, Singh had a one-hour meeting with Castros brother and acting Cuban president, Raul Castro.

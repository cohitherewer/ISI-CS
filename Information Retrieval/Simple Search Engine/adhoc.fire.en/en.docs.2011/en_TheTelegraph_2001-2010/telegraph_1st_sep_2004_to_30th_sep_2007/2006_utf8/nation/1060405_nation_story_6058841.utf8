 Locker haul

 Mumbai, April 4: Police on Monday seized a Smith amp; Wesson revolver from a bank locker in Mumbai that had not been operated for over 20 years. 

 Officials of the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur broke open the locker to find the revolver, a box containing 11 precious stones, a gold necklace, two pendants, and an earring. Police sources said bank records showed that R.S. Gill, a resident of Faridkot in Punjab, had rented the locker in March 1985 but never operated it. In January, arms were found in another locker opened in 1985, at the height of militancy in Punjab.

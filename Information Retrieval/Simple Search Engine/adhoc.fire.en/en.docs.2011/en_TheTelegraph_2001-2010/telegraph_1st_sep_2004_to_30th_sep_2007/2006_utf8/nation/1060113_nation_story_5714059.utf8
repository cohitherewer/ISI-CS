 Pill against Honda rerun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Jan. 12: Worried about capital inflow following last Julys clash between police and Honda workers, Haryana today announced its own labour policy that aims to prevent industrial strife.

 The raft of measures unveiled by chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda also promise to protect workers rights, ensure industrial safety, improve conditions for women workers and eliminate child labour.

 The IT sector has been declared a public utility service, exempting it from general strikes called by others and prohibiting strikes or lockouts in the sector without notice.

 Labour trouble has been growing in Haryana ever since Hooda came to power in February last year, with workers taking to the streets and clashing with the police. The worst instance has been the Honda unrest in which the police mercilessly beat and injured hundreds of strikers in Gurgaon.

 The incident had scared auto major Volkswagen enough for it to decide to shift a planned 300-million-euro plant from the state to Punjab. The company was recently reported to have had a rethink again and is believed to be reconsidering Haryana, home to factories set up by many multinationals such as Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.

 This prompted the Hooda government to put all the labour unions under watch to prevent any more violence, especially because some 90 labour disputes are yet to be settled in the state. The new policy is the latest move in the effort.

 We welcome the new labour policy. But we want the automobile industry in the state to be declared a public utility service, said the Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India vice-president (general affairs), H.S. Shekhawat.

 This is the first time any state in India has formulated a labour policy of its own, Hooda claimed. 

 The new policy asks the state labour department to try and build trust between workers and the management so that strikes and lockouts can be avoided.

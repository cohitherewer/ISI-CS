The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mamata

 Calcutta, 

 Nov. 27: Trinamul insiders today said Mamatas 

 resolve to give blood for the (farmers) cause 

 had softened with dwindling support. 

 When Mamata planted potato seeds on the plot acquired for Tata Motors in Singur yesterday, there were 50-60 people around her. Our protests will not stop Tata from setting up the factory, said a North 24-Parganas MLA. 

 Another MLA said: The number of people who havent collected their cheques yet is too small to sustain an agitation. Camps to protect the land are now empty. 

 Issuing statements in Calcutta draws more publicity, a Trinamul leader said.

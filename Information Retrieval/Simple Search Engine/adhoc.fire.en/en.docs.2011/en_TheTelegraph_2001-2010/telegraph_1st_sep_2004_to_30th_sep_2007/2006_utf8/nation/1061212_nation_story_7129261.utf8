The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Row over minorities stalls House

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The BJP stalled Parliament today, protesting against Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs remark that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, must have the first claim on the nations resources.

 Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned repeatedly in the morning when the BJP and the Shiv Sena demanded that the Prime Minister apologise for the comments made at Saturdays meeting of the National Development Council.

 Both Houses were finally adjourned for the day a little after 2 pm, with hardly any business having been transacted.

 As the BJP-Sena members shouted slogans in the Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi kept saying the nation was behind the Prime Minister. Pointing at the BJP, he said: It is they who want to divide the country.

 SC nod to sack for rash driving

 Drive safe 

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: If the nature of an accident indicates negligence on the part of a driver, the employer can dismiss him even in the absence of any substantive evidence, the Supreme Court has ruled.

 A bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said if negligence could be inferred from the circumstances, it is for the driver to prove that the accident could not have been avoided by exercising caution. 

 An employer can invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur meaning that facts speak for themselves to shift the burden of proof on the opposite party, the court said.

 All that needs to be established is the accident, and nothing more, the court said, adding that it would be unjust to compel the employer to prove the precise cause of an accident, particularly, when the respondent (the driver) has knowledge of the accident.

 The ruling came during the course of a hearing in a case where the apex court set aside a Karnataka High Court order directing the Northeast Karnataka Road Transport Corporation to reinstate a driver who had been dismissed for causing an accident. 

 The bench referred the case back to the labour court, which had earlier asked the corporation to put the driver back on the job. The labour court was asked to assess whether the res ipsa loquitur principle applied to the facts and circumstances of the case.

 Devidas Manikrao Sadananda was dismissed after the bus he was driving hit another, sending it crashing against a tree. Four passengers were killed and 56 injured.

 Sadananda approached the labour court, which ordered his reinstatement on the ground that there was no evidence to show that he had not taken reasonable care while driving. 

 The management ought to have examined the driver of the other bus involved in the accident, the labour court observed.

 The corporation appealed against the ruling in the high court, which upheld the labour court verdict. The apex court, however, overturned the judgment, and said all facts and circumstances had to be analysed. 

 If the nature of the impact indicates that the vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently, the burden of proof is on the driver to prove otherwise, the apex court said. 

 The res ipsa loquitur doctrine is usually invoked in civil cases to claim damages in accidents or other legal costs. It does not apply to criminal cases.

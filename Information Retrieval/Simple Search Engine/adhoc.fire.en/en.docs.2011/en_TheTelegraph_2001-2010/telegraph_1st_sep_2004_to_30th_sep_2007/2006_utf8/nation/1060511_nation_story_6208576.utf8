 Court crack at posters

 New Delhi, May 10 (PTI): Noting that public places and signboards continue to be defaced with slogans and posters, Delhi High Court today directed the government to book not only the culprits but also bosses in political parties and organisations whose interests are promoted through such methods.

 A division bench of acting Chief Justice Vijender Jaina and Justice S.N. Agarwal asked the capitals civic bodies and the cantonment board to file an action taken report on the directions and posted the matter for further hearing to July 14. 

 At one place we see Sonia Gandhis posters. At another we see L.K. Advanis. How can you allow such things to happen. Shall we issue notices to the bosses of these political parties? the bench asked government counsel Zubeda Begum.

 The bench made the observations after the petitioner, advocate Monika Arora, produced in the court photographs of defaced public places and signboards, that were defaced despite the courts earlier directives.

 House class in Basus house

 Jyoti Basu: Playing teacher

 Calcutta, June 9: Young MLAs eager to learn a lesson on Assembly rules and conduct might soon be sitting in a classroom with a 93-year-old as their teacher.

 Jyoti Basu has one condition, though. The classroom has to be in his Salt Lake house. 

 You know, I am not fit enough to attend such sessions, but if they come to my home, I will have no problems explaining how a legislative body functions. Im in politics for 60 years and new MLAs will be able to share my experience, Basu said today.

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim had earlier approached the veteran leader to train the first-timers.

 The House of 294 has 117 of them ? 98 from the Left Front, 11 from the Trinamul Congress, six from the Congress and one each from the GNLF and the SUCI.

 Halim had wanted Basu to come to the Assembly to take the classes. But having learnt about his reaction, he said: Let us see what can be done to enable Jyotibabus participation.

 Besides Basu, former Trinamul MLA Saugata Roy and former government chief whip Rabin Deb have also been asked to tutor the MLAs.

 The four-day training, scheduled to begin on June 26, is aimed at explaining to the newcomers how the Assembly works and the decorum legislators are expected to maintain for smooth conduct of business. 

 Instances of MLAs rushing to the well of the House and interrupting speeches for prolonged periods have been common in the Assembly, Halim said. There is a need to explain to the new MLAs that a House should not run like that. 

 The debutantes will also be told what they should do during question hour, mention hour and zero hour and how to move adjournment motions.

 The budget session of the Assembly begins on June 12.

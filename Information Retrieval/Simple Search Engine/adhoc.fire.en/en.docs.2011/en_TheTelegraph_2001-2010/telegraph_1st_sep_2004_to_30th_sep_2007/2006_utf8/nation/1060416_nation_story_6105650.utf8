 Grenade blasts hole in police claim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, April 15: One more grenade attack aimed at a paramilitary bunker rocked the Valley today, belying the state polices claim that the module behind yesterdays serial bombings had been busted. 

 Although no one was injured in the attack at Khanyar near the highly-revered shrine of Peer Dastageer Sahib, it spread panic and rattled residents.

 The deserted streets were proof of fear. Very few ventured out while most vehicles stayed off the roads. Students bunked classes as most of the schools and colleges are located in the high-security zone, the scene of yesterdays blasts.

 In Rawalpora, Nishat and Barbar Shah localities, residents observed a strike in protest against the attacks, according to PTI. 

 People expressed their anger openly against the acts of terror?, particularly on the holy Friday following the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad, an official spokesman was quoted by the agency as saying.

 Todays attack came within hours of state police chief Gopal Sharmas media briefing yesterdays blasts.

 On April 14, the militants lobbed grenades at seven places in Srinagar. As a result of these grenade explosions, five civilians were killed while 37 others, including 11 securitymen, sustained injuries, Sharma said.

 By the time the seventh grenade was lobbed at the busy Bohri Kadal chowk ? in the evening, the police had collected vital clues about the identity of the terrorists and started the follow-up action, the police chief added.

 Sharma confirmed the arrests of nine militants belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammad who, he said, had carried out the serial bombings here.

 The DGP said the city police had seized a mini bus from which grenade launchers, hand grenades, detonators, pencil timer chargers and AK-47 magazines were seized. He also said interrogations of the arrested militants were likely to lead to further arrests.

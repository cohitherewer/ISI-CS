 On right track: VP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, May 16: As controversy rages over Arjun Singhs Mandal II, its time for the original Mandal messiah to stage a second coming.

 Hooked to a dialysis machine, former Prime Minister V.P. Singh is trying to again mobilise the forces he had helped create with his reservation policy 16 years ago.

 As Prime Minister in 1990, VP had decided to implement the Mandal Commission recommendations on job reservations for the Other Backward Classes, changing the face of Indian politics by bringing to its centre-stage parties appealing to lower-caste interests.

 This morning, he sat surrounded by members of Uttar Pradeshs smaller parties on his latest mission to tap the continuing dissatisfaction among the states Dalits, backwards and Muslims.

 My potassium level began fluctuating sharply in Ghaziabad last week and my head began spinning. I had to be wheeled into a dialysis centre. I am better now, and here I am, the man in his mid-seventies said with a faint smile.

 Leaders from the Janvadi Party, Pragatisil Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Kranti Party, among others, had rushed to meet Raja saab as soon as he arrived in Lucknow today. All of them are hoping to climb on the Jan Morcha bandwagon VP floated recently with Samajwadi Party rebel and Agra MP Raj Babbar.

 Everybody wants a slice of his time: for a Dalit meeting in Jaunpur, for a farmers agitation in Varanasi. VP smiles and says: Yes, I will attend.

 They are bringing to me issues of the far-flung areas ? the dissatisfaction of the Dalits, the tribals whose aspirations the Samajwadi Party has failed to fulfil, VP says.

 As for the big national issue, VP backs Arjun. 

 He is on the right track.

 The huge response has encouraged the former Prime Minister to try for ? and pull off ? the near-impossible: both Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan are to attend the Morchas May 30 rally here. Both want a foothold in Uttar Pradesh before next years polls. The CPIs A.B. Bardhan will be coming too.

 VPs list of supporters features 11 small parties, but the number is growing. This time, the man who ended Rajiv Gandhis reign by playing up Bofors appears to be soft towards the Congress. In 2007, he would be hoping to do to Mulayam what he had done to Rajiv in 1989.

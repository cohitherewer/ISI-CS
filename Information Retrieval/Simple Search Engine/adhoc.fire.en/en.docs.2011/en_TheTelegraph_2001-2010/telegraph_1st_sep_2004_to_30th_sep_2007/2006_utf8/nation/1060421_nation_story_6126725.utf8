 Gurgaon mall suspect surrenders

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 20: Ashok Rajput, accused of pushing 22-year-old Sonis Javed to her death from the third floor of a Gurgaon mall last week, surrendered in court today.

 Rajput has given himself up and has been remanded in police custody till April 23. We are questioning him, investigating officer Baljit Singh said.

 Gurgaon police had been prodding his family to convince him to surrender. We had told them they would be arrested for giving shelter to Rajput. The ploy worked, he said.

 Rajput has named a few people, the officer said, but refused to divulge details till the probe was over.

 Sonis, who was working as a marketing manager in Rajputs pubs, was allegedly pushed to her death after a quarrel over money.

 The police have recovered Soniss luggage and a bag with documents and a mobile phone from Gurumb, who had taken her from the airport that night to the pub where Rajput was waiting.

 Soniss family has alleged that Rajput had deliberately pushed her from the third floor and killed her.

 Haryana police are also probing a possible love triangle, and whether Sonis was drunk and if this led to her fatal fall at the MGF Metropolitan Mall.

 Gurumb has reportedly told the police that Sonis had a fight with Rajput as he got cosy with the other girl the same night.

 The incident has led to a crackdown on pubs selling liquor till early morning in Gurgaon and Faridabad.

 Help for holiday wives 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, April 19: In their fight for justice, Indias deserted brides are no longer alone.

 Those who feel that injustice has been meted out to them by runaway NRI grooms can approach the nearest passport office with all the details and their complaint will be forwarded to the department concerned abroad, minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma said. 

 He added that the passport officers could play the role of facilitators by forwarding such complaints.

 There are over 15,000 victims, known as holiday wives, of fraudulent NRI marriages living in Punjab. Eighty per cent of the marriages in the state to NRI men are doomed, with husbands never returning to take their brides with them.

 Sharma said public awareness is needed to end the menace of runaway NRI grooms. If they possess Indian passports, the number should be noted down so that it can be impounded later, he said.

 The minister said the foreign policy of the country, inextricably linked to the domestic situation, could be modified in the days to come. 

 The world has a good impression of India. If India has achieved the status that is so evident in the world today, it is because the country has performed well at home. Our democratic institutions, our growing economic strength and our talented population have all combined in giving us respect in the eyes of the world. The foreign policy cannot be de-linked from the situation at home, he said. 

 Sharma pointed out that it is important to reach out to the domestic audience and tell them why the ministry was taking certain steps, which may involve other countries, in particular neighbouring ones.

 The government would soon unveil a new passport and visa policy, he added. 

 We would like to make the issuance of passports and visas easier, he said, hinting at longer-term visas for those wishing to visit India. The ministry realises that simplification of the procedure is important and it is working in that direction, Sharma said. 

 The minister ruled out issuance of permits to travel to Lahore and Nankana Sahib on the bus from Amritsar. 

 Permits are being issued to enable people to cross the LoC in Kashmir. In Punjab, there is the international border and passports are needed to cross over from either side, he said. There is no proposal for a visa office in Amritsar, he added.

 The minister revealed that 80 Indian prisoners languishing in various Pakistani jails had been identified and efforts were being made to release them.

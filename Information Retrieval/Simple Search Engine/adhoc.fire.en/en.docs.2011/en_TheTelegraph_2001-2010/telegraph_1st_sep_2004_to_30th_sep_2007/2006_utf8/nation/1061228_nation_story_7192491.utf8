 New Delhi, Dec. 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today brushed aside the BJPs charge of Muslim appeasement to assert that while some minorities have done relatively well, others havent got an equal share of the benefits of development.

 Some minorities in India have done better than others, he said, giving the example of Jains and Sikhs.

 However, other minorities, especially the Muslim community in certain parts of our country, have not had an equal share of the fruits of development, Singh told the Dalit-Minority International Conference organised by cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party.

 The BJP, which saw red after Singhs comment earlier this month that Dalits and minorities, especially Muslims, must have the first claim on the nations resources, reacted sharply to his latest assertion.

 These statements are not a reflection of the governments commitment to secularism. The Prime Minister does not see any other community which has also remained backward, BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar said.

 Singh said the Sachar committee, which studied the socio-economic condition of Indian Muslims, had convincingly established their plight, and vowed to redress such imbalances, though he did not spell out how.

 This has been true that the Muslim minorities in our country have not got an equitable share of the fruits of development. Therefore, practical ways and means have to be explored to redress this basic inequity, he said.

 Singh also spoke of the discrimination that Dalits face but said it was unique and fundamentally different from the problems of minority groups. The only parallel to the practice of untouchability, he added, was apartheid.

 Our government is deeply and sincerely committed to the equality of all sections of our society and will take all steps to help in the social, educational and economic empowerment of Dalits. This is our solemn commitment.

 Singh acknowledged that scheduled castes and scheduled tribes faced problems like displacement and forcible migration in search of jobs. He said his government would address these issues.

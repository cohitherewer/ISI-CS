 Soni boost to tea tourism

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 5: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments plans to revive tea tourism in north Bengal, turned down twice by the Centre earlier, got a fillip today with the promise of full support from tourism minister Ambika Soni. 

 The chief minister is concerned about promoting tea tourism in north Bengal. This includes upgrading forest lodges and building environment-friendly homesteads in the hills to encourage tea travel, Soni said after a meeting with Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.

 The state government had drawn up a Rs 7.94-crore tea tourism package, which includes upgrading tourist accommodation and constructing log cabins, bungalows, watch towers and treetop huts in the tea estates forest zones. Renovation of abandoned heritage bungalows and landscaping also form part of the plan. 

 The state had also envisaged an arena for performing artistes and display of ethnic crafts around tourist spots.

 The first time the Union ministry had turned down the proposal, it said the gardens were very far from the nearest railway stations and the airport. The Centre also had reservations about a revised Rs 7.84-crore proposal sent later.

 The ministry held that it had stopped funding the accommodation component, which it said usually goes into private hands and is not maintained well later, a state tourism official said. 

 Bhattacharjee today made a fresh pitch before Soni, who said: The tourism ministry sometimes turns down proposals if they do not conform to the required format. However, we are willing to sanction up to Rs 8 crore for the tea tourism project. Were promoting public private partnerships in this sector in a major way.

 Among the gardens short-listed for tea tourism are Makaibari in Darjeeling, Panighata near Naxalbari in the Terai region and Samsing, Hilla, Chalsa, Mohua and Phaskowa in Dooars. The government also plans to open to visitors the doors of Chalsa Polo Club, Nagrakata Golf Club and the Western Dooars Planters Club in Japaiguri, all about 60-80 km from Bagdogra airport. 

 Horse-riding, river-rafting and wildlife watching from treetops, trekking on jungle trails and tea-tasting would also be encouraged.

 Soni promised to find consultants to formulate eco-tourism packages for the hills and the Sunderbans.

 State tourism minister Manab Mukherjee, who met Soni yesterday, said: She has been very supportive. We will send several proposals to her ministry seeking financial support.

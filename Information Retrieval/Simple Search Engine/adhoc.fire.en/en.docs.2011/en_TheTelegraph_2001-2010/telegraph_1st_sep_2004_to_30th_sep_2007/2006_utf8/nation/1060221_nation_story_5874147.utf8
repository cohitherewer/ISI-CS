 Record bid in Sania yard

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Feb. 20: No, it wasnt Sania Mirza who made waves today at the posh Jubilee Hills, but a single square metre of land that went for a record Rs 1,42,620.

 About 5.3 of 300 acres taken over by the government from the Chiran Palace estate in Jubilee Hills were today put on the block by the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority and sold for a whopping Rs 335 crore.

 This is possibly the highest amount that a single square metre of prime land in Hyderabad has fetched in recent times. It was picked up by a consortium of Nagarjuna Constructions, Mytas (Satyams construction wing) and ICICI Ventures.

 The national record in real estate deals is, however, held by Mukesh Ambani. On January 17, he had beaten brother Anil in the bidding, paying Rs 1,104 crore for a 7.5-hectare commercial plot in the Bandra-Kurla complex.

 Four years ago, the Andhra government had taken over 300 acres of the 475-acre Chiran Palace grounds belonging to the seventh nizam, Mahboob Ali Pasha. A nature park has been set up on most of the land, save the plot that was auctioned today.

 Cries of foul play and threats to go to court have already begun. Kishore Biyani of Pantaloon Retail, which quoted Rs 1.35 lakh a square metre, alleged the process smacked of foul play as the sealed tenders were not opened in the presence of bidders.

 The Hyderabad Urban Development Authority has, however, defended the procedure it followed. Other contenders included Taj GVK, ITC Hotels, DLF and Dubais Emmar Group.

 A five-star hotel or a mall is likely to come up on the plot that will be exempt from the Andhra Pradesh Urban Land Ceiling Act and prevailing floor-space index regulations.

 Real estate dealers are amazed at the rate at which prices of land in Hyderabad are skyrocketing. Just a year ago, auction of land at Diamond Hill ? a colony in the heart of Jubilee Hills ? had gone for Rs 48,000 per square metre.

 Shekhar Reddy, former president of the Andhra Pradesh Builders Forum, said upcoming projects like FAB City ? companies manufacturing chips for computers, mobiles and other electronic gadgets will be concentrated here ? could have triggered the price rise.

 Kathmandu, Nov. 9: Now that the government, political parties and the Maoists have finalised the peace accord, the UN is putting in place arrangements for its implementation. 

 The first task for Ian Martin, the UN secretary-generals personal representative in Nepal, is the management of arms in the possession of both the Maoists and the Nepal Army.

 The UN is likely to bring in both serving and retired army officers from several countries to monitor the arms management process. Other UN teams will also supervise the implementation of the peace deal till the elections to the Constituent Assembly scheduled for June next year.

 Martin today discussed the issue with Maoist chief Prachanda and deputy commanders of the Peoples Liberation Army.

 He also held a separate meeting with representatives of the Girija Prasad Koirala government. He holds a tripartite meeting tomorrow with the government, the Maoists and other UN officials.

 Speaking to the media for the first time since the current phase of the peace process began, he indicated that discussions had already started on confining the Maoist army to temporary cantonments. 

 He was, however, cautious about the next steps and suggested that the modalities of the implementation of the peace agreement would be put in place only after a concrete decision about them is taken by all sides involved in the process.

 Prime Minister Koirala, too, briefed members of the countrys parliament today on the peace agreement. All parties and the Maoists contributed to the finalisation of the agreement, he said. The peace deal has been hailed by the international community, though a section had doubted if it would be signed so soon. 

 There was, however, no mention of any particular country in Koiralas speech. There was also no reference to the king or the future of the monarchy. The peace deal, though, has kept the monarchy alive at least till the elections to the Constituent Assembly.

 India, however, has been generally seen as the most important international broker of the peace. The pro-India sentiment in all sections of the people is a major change from the anti-India posturings that have long been common in Nepals politics. Even Prachanda yesterday hailed Indias role in pushing the peace agreement. 

 The US embassy, which had always maintained a tougher stand on the Maoists and opposed the idea of the rebels joining the government before surrendering their arms, has been somewhat critical about the agreement on two counts. 

 The agreement does not include a categorical statement by the Maoists that they will not take up arms again. And, it has not specified what actions are to be taken if the agreement is violated.

 But the US has otherwise hailed the agreement, saying it would diminish the fear of violence, intimidation and extortion that Nepal endured for 11 years.

 Cinemas feel Fanaa pinch

 BASANT RAWAT

 Aamir: Support for Fanaa

 Ahmedabad, May 30: Left to themselves, many hall owners in Gujarat would have liked to screen Fanaa, but chief minister Narendra Modis sealed lips are holding them back.

 Modis studied silence on the statewide ban on screening the Aamir Khan starrer is being interpreted as tacit support to the blackout.

 If Modi wants, he can end this unnecessary controversy. Cinema owners are apprehensive as they fear vandalism if they screen the movie. The fear is genuine. The chief minister will have to assure us there will be no trouble, said a multiplex owner.

 Although theatre owners had announced the unanimous ban, because Aamir had said priority should be given to rehabilitate those displaced by the Narmada dam, the decision came after the state Bajrang Dal chief told them to be ready to face the consequences if the film was shown. And many believe they could not have taken the decision without the blessings of the state government, which is headed by the BJP.

 The party has denied any hand in the ban but has asked Aamir to apologise. If he wants the people of Gujarat to forgive him, he should tender an apology, said party spokesman Yaman Vyas.

 But hall-owners say the controversy is going on for too long. We need to find a way out. The ban is affecting not only us but the state government is also incurring losses in terms of sales tax collection. So it makes good business sense to find a solution to this controversy, said Harish Patel, who heads the 426-member single-screen cinema association in the state.

 Sources said if the ban continues, exhibitors and the government stand to lose close to Rs 8 crore.

 A citizens group has condemned the ban and slammed the demand for apology as outrageous and an attack on freedom of expression.

 The inability to allow truth, justice, freedom and equality for all to prevail is symptomatic of the malaise in the state, it said in a statement. The group urged every section to denounce the ban and ensure the films immediate release.

 Yesterday, Bollywood stood up for Aamir. Film personalities, among them actors Anil Kapoor and Anupam Kher, film-makers Yash Chopra, Subhash Ghai and Ramesh Sippy and directors Kunal Kohli and Ashutosh Gowarikar, said unless the film is screened in Gujarat in a week, action would be taken.

 A senior BJP leader, however, said his party is not bothered by the bad press it is getting. Any controversy is good for the party in the state, he added. We stand to gain politically.

 Perhaps, this explains Modis silence.

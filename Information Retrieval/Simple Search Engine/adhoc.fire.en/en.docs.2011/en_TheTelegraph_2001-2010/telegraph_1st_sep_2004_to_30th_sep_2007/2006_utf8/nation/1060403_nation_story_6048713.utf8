The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Super city nod to Calcutta

 AMIT ROY

 Pound

New Delhi, April 2: Calcutta has been praised 

as a super city by the leader of a heavyweight British parliamentary 

delegation which is about to arrive in the Bengal capital for a series of political 

and business meetings.

 Stephen Pound, the chairman of Labour Friends of India, said: As UK politicians, we recognise the emerging significance of this super city of 13 million people with its massively exciting programme of new industry and infrastructure and we hope to learn a little more of the way the city works, particularly as well be there in the midst of the state elections.

 Pounds comment goes beyond mere politeness and suggests that the British have been quick to recognise that Bengal is climbing out of its trough.

 And if the British are convinced that Bengals bad old days are over, they would be in a good position to pass on the good news to Britains partners in Europe.

 The problem for Bengal has been that it has been slow to market itself in the UK with the same determination that has been shown by some other states, such as Gujarat.

 Bengal could now take advantage of the British cold-shouldering of Gujarat ? senior British diplomats have indicated they will give the state a miss so long as Narendra Modi, with his alleged anti-Muslim stance, is its chief minister.

 In Calcutta, the British MPs will meet governor Gopal Gandhi, who knows London well from his days as director of the Nehru Centre. There will also be a meeting with the chief minister.

 The British delegates say they will participate in a round table meeting with local businesses organised by Ficcis eastern region and also meet the state governments nodal investment agency ? the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. Whilst in Calcutta, the delegation will visit a development project that is funded by the Department for International Development.

 The delegation, which arrived in Delhi yesterday, will return to London on April 9.

 These visits have provided our delegates in the past with the opportunity to understand and see for them-selves the real India, said Pound. The delegates return having forged strong links and established a connection with the many people we meet with in industry, business, politics and civic society.

 In Delhi, meetings have been lined up with such key figures as Kamal Nath, the commerce and industry minister, L.K. Advani, the leader of the Opposition, Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, and Anand Sharma, the minister of state for external affairs.

 Since medical tourism is becoming increasingly important to the British, the MPs will visit the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital; take a ride on the Delhi Metro (it is not known whether they will do a Tollygunge to Dum Dum run as well); visit the visa section of the British High Commission and view the activity of a call centre operated by HCL which has an operation employing over 1,000 people in Belfast.

 As part of industry, Ficci and CII will provide perspectives on the Indian economy and convey the key issues of significance to India on international trade and investment.

 The delegation includes Baroness Corston, the former chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party; Dawn Butler, MP for Brent South (which has a large Indian population) and parliamentary private secretary to Helen Kennedy, MP, minister of health; Andrew Gwynne, MP (Denton amp; Reddish) and parliamentary private secretary to Baroness Scotland, minister for home office; Celia Barlow (Hove); Sadiq Khan, MP (Tooting) and one of the crop of bright young Muslim politicians; and Sir Peter Soulsby, MP (Leicester South).

 Jethmalani: End of a chapter

 New Delhi, April 10: Nomination to the Rajya Sabha is not enough to tame Ram Jethmalani. The Congress just began to discover the joys of adding the legal luminary to its strength in the Upper House today.

 Theyve not given me a full six-year term, Jethmalani said. Obviously, Manmohan Singh does not think I am going to last for more than three years.

 The 82-year-old was nominated by the President on the Centres recommendation. He fills in the vacancy created by Hindi journalist Vidya Niwas Mishras death last year. He will serve only the remainder of Mishras term that expires in August 2009.

 Jethmalani was pleased by the Congresss acknowledging him, though a trifle late. His nomination on Congress support symbolically marks the end of a chapter in his political life.

 Having opposed Indira Gandhi through the Emergency, Jethmalani went to the extent of successfully defending her assassins. He continued his attack on the Congress during Rajiv Gandhis time, shooting off 10 questions a day on the Bofors scandal ahead of the 1989 polls.

 He was associated with the BJP thereafter and appointed law minister by the NDA. But the Tehelka expose saw him taking a strident stand against the NDA. This led to his ouster.

 Jethmalani was hurt, not because he was asked to quit but by the manner in which it was done. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not deem it fit to call me up. He got Jaswant Singh to tell me to leave, he had said.

 The ouster saw Jethmalani warming up to the Congress and Kapil Sibal convinced him to fight as an Independent backed by the Congress against Vajpayee in Lucknow in the 2004 elections.

 Though Jethmalani did an about turn in the middle of the campaign, he was convinced to resume by the joint efforts of Swami Agnivesh and Sibal.

 Since then, he had been waiting in the wings for the Congress to reward him. I am happy, thanks very much, he told well-wishers.

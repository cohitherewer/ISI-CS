 Mother amp; daughter murdered

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI

 New Delhi, March 12: The Sunday morning started on a jarring note for residents of Siddhartha Enclave as they woke up to find a mother and her daughter murdered in the neighbourhood.

 Swarna Mahajan, 72, and her daughter Anuradha, 48, both practising lawyers in Delhi High Court, were found strangulated in the bedroom of their flat.

 When their domestic help, Geeta, came calling around 8 am today, nobody responded to the doorbell. She got suspicious and alerted neighbours, who broke into the flat.

 Anuradha is a divorcee and her brother Sanjeev lives in the US. Police have informed him and he is flying to Delhi. They will wait for Sanjeev before sending the bodies for autopsy.

 Delhi police, whose investigative skills have come under question in the Jessica Lal case, said the murders were apparently carried out by someone known to the victims.

 They said there was no indication of robbery being the motive of the killers, who used a dupatta to strangulate the women. 

 The house was ransacked but valuables were not missing. The women were gagged and their limbs tied.

 The police said a briefcase and a cupboard were ransacked, indicating that the killers had searched for something. 

 However, deputy commissioner of police (south) Anil Shukla did not rule out personal or professional animosity behind the murders.

 Geeta told the police that she cooked dinner for the Mahajans last night and when she left the flat on Saturday around 10 pm, there were two persons with the Mahajans. 

 They had come in a car bearing a Uttar Pradesh registration number, she added.

 The logbook of the security post at the main gate of the colony, where the registration numbers of cars entering the locality are noted down, shows that two cars had come to the house between 6 pm and 9 pm last night.

 However, the guards had not noted down the names of the visitors.

 The police believe that the killers could have come in the second car. They have launched a search to trace the two cars and their occupants.

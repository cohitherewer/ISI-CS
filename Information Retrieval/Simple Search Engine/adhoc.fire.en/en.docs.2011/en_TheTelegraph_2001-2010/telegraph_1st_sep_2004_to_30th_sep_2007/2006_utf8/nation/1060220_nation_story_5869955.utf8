 Sample surfeit jolts Bhopal

 Bhopal, Feb. 19: Thousands of samples kept pouring into the Bhopal-based High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) from across the country, spreading concern among residents of the city where memories of the gas tragedy are still raw.

 The presence of the lab, the only one in Asia equipped to deal with bird flu, close to the dense population is keeping many on tenterhooks. When the 135-acre lab was set up three decades ago, it was away from the population zone. But the city grew over the years and residential complexes came up near the facility.

 Ever since bird flu was confirmed in Navapur, samples have been coming in from Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and the rest of the country. 

 Cancer specialist Dr Shyam Aggarwal said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) should set up a monitoring committee to check the security drill at the lab. There is a need for scientific and independent study to ensure that the samples are effectively disposed of, Aggarwal said.

 S. Hashmi, whose house is near the lab, said the site reminds him of the horrible days of 1984, when the gas tragedy occurred. There were some reports that gas leak was taking place but Union Carbide and local authorities kept saying that everything was in order, Hashmi said. 

 HSADL director Hare Krishna Pradhan sought to allay such fears, saying the lab was cent per cent safe as infectious areas were separated by a floor.

 He said containment laboratories can be isolated by locating them on an island, as the US has done, or by surrounding the laboratory building with another building, a model used in Australia, or by separating infectious areas by an exclusive floor, which is the case in Bhopal. 

 The more dangerous tasks, such as waste-water handling and carcass disposal, take place in an access-restricted basement of the lab. Not a drop of water can go outside without sterilisation because it is potentially contaminated, Pradhan said.

 Water from this lab or the animal wing goes through pipes and is collected and sterilised at 100 degrees centigrade for half an hour, he added.

 The lab is the only one in Asia that adheres to bio-safety level 4 norms set by the WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health. 

 The dozen-odd scientists here have extensive training in handling hazardous infectious agents. Every day, these scientists have to go through a punishing drill that includes three hot and cold showers. 

 Personnel enter and leave the laboratory only through the shower and change rooms. They take a decontaminating shower each time they leave the laboratory.

 The scientists leave the clothes in which they arrive in the outer change room. Complete laboratory clothing ? pants, shirts or jumpsuits, shoes, gloves and undergarments ? is provided.

 The laboratory gear has to be left behind in the inner change room before exiting.

 The air in the labs is kept under negative pressure, which means if a door were accidentally unsealed, air will flow in the direction of the labs, but not the other way.

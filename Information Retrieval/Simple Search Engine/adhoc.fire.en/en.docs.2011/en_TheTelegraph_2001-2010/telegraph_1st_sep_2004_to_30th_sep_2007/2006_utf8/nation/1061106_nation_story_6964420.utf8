 Suicide by top cop daughter

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 

 5: The daughter of a senior Haryana police official 

 shot herself late last evening at her south Delhi residence, 

 police said today.

 Mrinalini, the 18-year-old daughter of Vijendra Rai, Haryana additional director-general of police, shot herself using her fathers licensed official pistol around 8.30 pm, the police said.

 A journalism student at the little-known Madhubala College of Communication and Electronic Media, she was alone at home in Hauz Khas when she shot herself. She had just finished her first year in college.

 We are shocked at the news that Mrinalini has shot herself. Her father has rushed to New Delhi, an official in Rais office said.

 Enquiries have revealed that Mrinalini had failed to appear for an exam in college and was depressed.

 A suicide note found in her room blames no one for her act. She has asked to be forgiven for taking the extreme step, the officer added. 

 Rai said he was in the dark about what made his daughter take such a step.

 In south Delhi, deputy commissioner of police Anil Shukla said though it was fairly clear that it was a case of suicide, we are hoping the parents can shed some light on what led her to take this drastic step. 

 Based on what some friends said, the police think poor academic performance and her fathers high expectations might have driven her to suicide.

 Rai, however, said: She (Mrinalini) was a career-oriented girl and was doing well academically. There was no pressure on her from our side on anything. We do not know why she chose to end her life.

 Top officer at Jessica party questioned 

 New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): The second-in-command of Delhi police, Yudhvir Dadwal, has been questioned by the special investigation team probing the Jessica Lal murder case.

 Dadwal, the special commissioner (administration) who was present at the party where Manu Sharma allegedly shot Jessica, was questioned last week, police said. The party was hosted by Bina Ramani on April 19,1999.

 Dadwal is the second IPS officer to be questioned in the reinvestigation that was ordered after the acquittal of all nine accused by a lower court triggered a public outcry.

 Chandigarh superintendent of police Vivek Gogia, who was additional DCP (south) when Jessica was murdered has also been questioned by the special investigation team. 

 The special team is probing the criminal conspiracy in the destruction and fabrication of evidence during the earlier investigation of the case.

 The team has so far questioned 30 people, including Bina Ramani, her fashion designer daughter Malini Ramani and model Shayan Munshi.

 It has also sent a team to Punjab to trace Vikas Gill, who allegedly helped Manu Sharma escape from the scene of the crime.

 Delhi High Court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Gill, who failed to appear before it when the murder case came up for hearing in appeal.

 We do not have a confirmation from immigration officials about Gill fleeing the country, a police source said.

 On February 21, a trial court had acquitted all the nine accused in the murder case, including Manu Sharma, Vikas Yadav, Amardeep Singh Gill alias Tony, Aloke Khanna, Shyam Sunder Sharma, Harvinder Chopra, Vikas Gill, Raja Chopra and cricketer Yuvraj Singhs father Yograj Singh.

 Following the public outrage, Delhi High Court stepped in and asked the police to file a status report.

 Delhi police also challenged the acquittals and ordered an investigation into the criminal conspiracy to destroy evidence in the case.

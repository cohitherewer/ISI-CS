 Bengals Imrana back home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Nov. 5: A 22-year-old rape victim who was forced to leave her home in Murshidabad three months ago following a shalishi verdict returned last evening escorted by her husband.

 Apprehending resistance from villagers, police had kept a close watch. But Manoara (name changed) returned home safely around 8 pm.

 Elders of Katabagan village near Behrampore who branded the mother of four characterless had ordered her to marry the man who raped her on July 25. Husband Muluk Sheikh was told to divorce Manoara though he wanted to live with her.

 A shalishi had ruled on July 29 that she would have to leave Katabagan, around 210 km from Calcutta. If Muluk wanted to stay with his wife in the village, he would have to pay Rs 50,000. The amount was beyond Muluks means. The police had refused to register Manoaras complaint.

 Manoara, with her children, went to live with her parents in nearby Gakunda village. But her father Rezaul Sheikh and stepmother also shut the door on her as she was branded a woman of loose morals. She finally found shelter at an aunts house.

 Yesterday, my husband and I had dinner outside before returning home. I am happy after so many months. No one prevented us from entering our house, Manoara said while cooking at her home this morning.

 Additional superintendent of police Shankar Chakraborty said he had ordered a vigil on the village when Manoara told him she wanted to return home on Saturday. But no one created any problem. We are searching for the rapist, Manoor Mullick, who is absconding.

 Manoara had lodged a complaint with the additional SP on Thursday. Following his instructions, Behrampore police started a probe. The next day, the police interrogated Manoara and Muluk who pleaded with them to ensure that they could stay in the village. Deputy superintendent of police Sahabul Hossain had assured them of all help and said they could return to Katabagan without fear.

 However, fear of arrest stalks most of the 38 villagers who participated in the shalishi. Some of them are not staying at home at night.

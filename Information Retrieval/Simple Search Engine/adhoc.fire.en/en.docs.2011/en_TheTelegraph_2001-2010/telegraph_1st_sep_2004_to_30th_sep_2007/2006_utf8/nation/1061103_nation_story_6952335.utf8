 Another Marxist in temple trouble

 Baby now... 

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 2: 

 Subhas Chakrabortys visit to the Tarapeeth Kali 

 shrine had his party squirming in embarrassment. After a 

 fellow CPM minister followed suit in Kerala, it is the temple 

 that has landed in controversy.

 Unlike Chakraborty, M.A. Baby had stepped into the Harikanyaka Devi shrine at Guruvayur not for personal or religious reasons. A confirmed atheist from the Christian community, he had gone only in his capacity of cultural affairs minister after being invited by temple officials.

 Yet, some devotees have alleged, a purification ceremony was carried out immediately after the visit because a non-Hindu had stepped into the hallowed premises.

 Baby had gone to Thrissur to fete writer Kovilan who has been selected for Keralas foremost Ezhuthachan literary award. Invited to the temple, he took off his shirt in keeping with tradition and went round the shrine, surveying its rich architecture with admiration. He then promised Rs 25 lakh in state grants for the temples upkeep.

 ... Subhas then

 Anguished devotees say the temple was later purified, as though its sanctity had been defiled.

 The Kochi Temple Board, which administers the shrine, denies the charge. Temple officials say there was just a cleaning-up because of the periodic repairs going on. Besides, the priests had spotted a rat snake within the precincts, which made such cleansing necessary.

 The divergent explanations and the timing of the cleaning-up, though, continue to fuel suspicion. Besides, devotees argue that the elaborate purification, undertaken by five priests, could not be termed as routine.

 Temple president P. Balakrishnan Nair and secretary C. Narayana Poduval resigned from the temple board office in Kochi on Wednesday, hoping this would end the controversy. Baby has ignored the row.

 By convention, non-Hindus are barred from Kerala temples which, till 1936, wouldnt let in even low-caste Hindus, branded untouchables. But the Kerala ruler issued a proclamation in 1936, throwing the door open to all Hindus.

 If Baby hadnt been a minister, he wouldnt have been invited to the temple. But is it all right for a non-Hindu, if he is a minister, to breach convention and step into a temple?

 Professor Vishnu Narayanan Namboodiri, who had done a stint as a temple priest, says: Vedic ethics do not bar anyone with a pure mind from worshipping at a temple. But I would like to believe that the purification did not have anything to do with Babys visit.

 Security in focus for new airports

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Eye on safety 

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The Union home ministry has asked the civil aviation ministry to put in place in-built security apparatus at all upcoming airports in Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore.

 The move was initiated after the foiled terror bid to blow up trans-Atlantic jets. The plan requires all companies or consortium of companies, which would build the new airports, to give detailed plans on how they will ensure that all the baggage and cargo including hand luggage is safe and has been inspected thoroughly.

 The decision came after a string of meetings between the two ministries following the Heathrow plot, said a senior home ministry official. 

 The security plan submitted by the companies building the airport infrastructure will be vetted separately by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and would also require the home ministrys approval.

 The idea is to put such an infrastructure in place that would scan all baggage thoroughly and reduce physical verification to the minimum, said a source in the civil aviation ministry.

 This would require installation of state-of-the-art equipment such as iris and fingerprint scanners, special scanners to read chemicals through the baggage, which in turn can push up the value of commercial bids made by the companies undertaking airport infrastructure projects, the source added.

 The home ministry has also made it clear to the civil aviation ministry that if the ground handling is to be opened up for private players, the new companies will have to obtain a clearance from the home ministry and the aviation security bureau and CISF.

 At present, only verified staffers of the Airports Authority of India, Air-India, Indian and the CISF are allowed to handle baggage of any kind.

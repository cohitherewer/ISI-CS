 Demolition notice on posh Delhi schools

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: The capitals civic authorities today sent showcause notices to elite schools in south Delhis Vasant Kunj area for violating building rules even as trendy shopping complexes continued to crumble under municipal bulldozers.

 If the fashion fraternity had hoped for a respite, there was none. Delhi High Court refused to grant any interim relief against the demolitions in the Lal Dora area.

 The Centre also ruled out an ordinance over the court-ordered demolitions, but said other measures would be in place soon to spare minor violations.

 Among the schools that received notices are the Ryan International School, Vasant Valley Public School, both the junior and senior branches of G.D. Goenka School, Bloom Public School, D.A.V School and play schools like Kangaroo Kids and Tender Feet.

 MCD spokesperson Deep Mathur said the schools have been sent notices asking them to explain within three days unauthorised constructions and violations of rules like running classes in basements.

 MCD sources said the civic body decided to serve the notices after getting complaints from residents. Gita Dewan Verma, a town planner, said many schools in Vasant Kunj have not only violated the Delhi master plan but also the Delhi Development Authoritys lease agreement, according to which they should give free education to 25 per cent students from deprived sections.

 Mathur, however, said there was no need for immediate panic as the MCD would first examine the replies sent by the schools authorities who will then get the chance to explain the violations in person.

 If their replies are found unsatisfactory and the violations are proved, the schools will be given six days to carry out corrective measures failing which the MCD will start taking action which will include demolition, Mathur said.

 In Lal Dora, MCD bulldozers tore through 2 MG Road, a mall that houses some of the best known brands of the Indian fashion industry. The MCD had earlier pulled down parts of 1 MG Road amid protests by high-profile designers.

 The high court today posted for further hearing on Tuesday a fresh petition filed by a group of designers seeking a stay on the drive against their outlets in Lal Dora.

 Union urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy said the government was working out solutions to calm the panic among the public and insisting that large-scale encroachments and minor changes in buildings cannot be clubbed together.

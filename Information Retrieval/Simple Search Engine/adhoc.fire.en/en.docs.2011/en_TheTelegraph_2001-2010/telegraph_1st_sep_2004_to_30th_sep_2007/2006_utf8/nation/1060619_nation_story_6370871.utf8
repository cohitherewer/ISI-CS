 Woman beheaded

 Krishnagar, June 18: The wife of a physically challenged man was beheaded in a Nadia village last night allegedly by her former paramour, whom she had charged with sexual assault earlier. 

 Bulbuli Mondals body was found this morning not far from her house in Hogolberia, 190 km from Calcutta. 

 Police said a hunt is on for 35-year-old Deepak Mondal. Bulbuli, 28, had a relation- ship with him earlier. Last night, he called her out. She told her seven-year-old son Sukanta she would return soon, but did not, a police officer said. 

 Subdivisional police officer Ashok Roy said she had accused Deepak of molestation under pressure from her husband and brother-in-law after they got wind of her affair.

 Deepak was arrested in February and his family had faced a social boycott after that.

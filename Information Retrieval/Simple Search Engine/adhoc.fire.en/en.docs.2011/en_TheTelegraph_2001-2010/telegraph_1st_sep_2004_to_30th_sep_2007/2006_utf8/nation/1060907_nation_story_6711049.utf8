 Bungalow leash on Centre

 New Delhi, Sept. 6 (PTI): The Supreme Court today restrained the Centre from allotting type VIII government bungalows meant for ministers, top bureaucrats and apex court judges in the capital without its permission.

 Dont allot type VIII bungalows without the Supreme Courts order, a bench of justices B.N. Agrawal, P.P. Naolekar and L.S. Panta told the ministry of urban affairs.

 The order was passed at a hearing in which the bench was perusing the documents relating to three type VIII bungalows which were earlier in the pool for apex court judges but were declared unfit. The addresses in question were numbers 1 and 2 Kamraj lane and 11 Thyagraj Marg.

 The court, which allowed allotment of 4 Akbar road to a member of the Cauvery-Krishna water dispute tribunal, later directed that the bungalow be put back in its pool.

 The bench also directed that the bungalow at 16 Teen Murti lane be ready before September 10. Rajya Sabha MP Najma Heptullah, who has been asked to vacate the 4 Akbar road bungalow, complained that the alternative accommodation at 16 Teen Murti was not fit.

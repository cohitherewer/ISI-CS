The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Carnival time outside 10 Janpath, a car the star draw

 ANIRBAN DAS MAHAPATRA

 New 

 Delhi, March 24: Its four in the afternoon 

 but the daylong jamboree on a stretch of Akbar Road that 

 hems 10 Janpath shows no sign of waning.

 Sonia Gandhi hasnt made a public appearance yet, choosing to confine herself in the recesses of the Lutyens bungalow that has become hallowed grounds to millions of Congress supporters across the nation. A banner strung from a tree says it all: Tyaag ki bhoomi (turf of sacrifice).

 A clutch of police barricades planted across the drive-in restricts entry into the sanctum sanctorum, but thats hardly a dampener for the crowd. Chants of Soniaji amar rahe emanating from a megaphone merge with the notes of patriotic music blaring out of a loudspeaker, being towed about by an enthusiast. The battery has begun to show signs of fatigue, but not its bearer.

 A chimerical car ? a Maruti 800 chassis fashioned to resemble a vintage chop-top Standard Herald ? crawls to and fro on the road to the delight of the crowd, still a few hundred strong. Painted a bright saffron and green, the car is carrying some 12 people armed with flags and placards.

 Delhi MLA Ashok Ahuja slips off his perch on the bonnet to flash a broad smile. Hai na badhiya (isnt this wonderful)? he beams.

 Sonia is a brave and selfless leader to have given up her Parliament seat at the slightest provocation from a malicious Opposition, Ahuja argues.

 And she even sacrificed her position of Prime Minister two years ago. Who can beat such altruism? he asks.

 Behind the politician, throngs of supporters are mixing demonstration with a little swig of self-indulgence. A mini-carnival has taken root under the trees.

 For a moment, the pungent smell of human sweat is neutralised by a whiff of country liquor that wafts out from somewhere. Satbir Sharma of Najafgarh takes a break from shouting slogans to squat on the pavement.

 We hope Soniaji will listen to our request and consider withdrawing her resignation, he says. Though her initial step was praiseworthy, by stepping aside she may only have given the wolves more opportunity to get at her.

 Suddenly, theres a hubbub near the barricades. Sonia has agreed to meet her supporters in person, a party volunteer reveals. 

 A queue quickly forms before the barriers. People are let inside in small groups and ushered out a few minutes later.

 Jitender Sharma, a Youth Congress member, is one of the first to walk out. Soniaji has heard us, he announces in a state of ecstasy. We pleaded with her to reconsider her decision, and she said she would give it a thought. Now we shall resume our narebazi (slogan-shouting).

 Sharma hurries across to a group demonstrating under a poster that features a smiling Sonia with her children. Rajiv Gandhi beams from the background, with a shadow for a moustache.

 The Family above all, it seems to say.

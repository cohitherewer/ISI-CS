 Bank pays for card mystery 

 New Delhi, Sept. 17 (PTI): A consumer court has asked the State Bank of India to pay Rs 6,000 to two persons as compensation, including the litigation costs, for failing to check fraudulent withdrawal of money from a bank account through debit card.

 The west Delhi district consumer disputes redressal forum asked the SBIs Janakpuri branch to pay the fine in a month to complainants Shambhu Nath Jha and Usha Devi.

 They found Rs 2.46 lakh had been withdrawn from their joint account through debit card even though they did not hold an ATM card.

 Bank officials, after being told about the discrepancy, refused to cooperate and never explained how the account, which had a balance of Rs 2.54 lakh, could show only Rs 8,802 as balance, they alleged.

 The couple approached the forum, alleging that Rs 2.46 lakh was withdrawn through an ATM by using a debit card that was never issued to them.

 The banks manager, however, told the forum that the withdrawn amount had been credited to the account of the husband-wife duo. 

 Subsequently, the bank did not contest the complaint.

 Posting snub

 Delhi High Court has dismissed the petition of a physically challenged State Bank of India employee who challenged his demotion after declining a rural posting. 

 The court said Ashok Khoslas attitude was akin to having a cake and eating it too.

 He had been promoted to a middle management grade scale officer in a rural area, but opted for VRS after his request for exemption from the post was turned down.

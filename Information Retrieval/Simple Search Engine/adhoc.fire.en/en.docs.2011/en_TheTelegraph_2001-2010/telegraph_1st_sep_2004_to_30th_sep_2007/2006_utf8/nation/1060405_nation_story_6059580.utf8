 Now, Advani talks of Christ

 New Delhi, April 4: L.K. Advanis new-found fervour for Christian symbolism could be credited to his recent visit to St. Patricks, his alma mater in Karachi.

 On the eve of launching his fifth rath yatra, he compared the birth of the BJP to the resurrection of Christ.

 We were thrown out of the Janata Party on April 4, 1980. It was Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ was crucified. We formed the BJP on April 6. It was Easter Sunday, the day Christ was resurrected. The coincidence is remarkable, Advani said.

 The analogy could prove troublesome for the Jinnah-stung Advani. Already, the more excitable members of the Sangh parivar have started spewing venom against him.

 There are so many examples of great people who have made the ultimate sacrifice in Indian history and mythology. But he has to praise the Christians. Why did he not think of Chhatrapati Shivaji? asked Vinod Bansal of the VHP.

 It is unthinkable for the Sangh to condone Advanis assertions. After all, Guru Golwalkar counted Christians among the three internal threats ? the Muslims, Christians and the communists.

 They have developed a feeling of identification with the enemies of the land. They look to some foreign lands as their holy places, Golwalkar has said in Chapter XII of his Bunch of Thoughts.

 Although the Sangh is more circumspect in expressing opinion, an activist tersely said: Vinash kale viprit buddhi (A condemned man cannot think straight).

 Cabinet nod to forest bill

 New Delhi: The Union cabinet on Thursday decided to table in the winter session of Parliament a bill giving land rights in forests to the tribes living on them.

 The cabinet rejected the recommendation of a parliamentary standing committee to exclude the creamy layer (well-off) from the 27 per cent other backward classes quota in central educational institutions.

 The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill will be tabled with certain amendments.

 The original draft had set 1980 as a cut-off date while settling land claims from traditional forest dwellers. But a 30-member joint parliamentary committee recommended that the cut-off date be dropped and all genuine forest dwellers be given land rights. The suggestion has been accepted.

 Rampage against poll code

 Lucknow: Students ran wild 

 on the streets on Thursday, looting shops and fighting police, 

 after Lucknow University refused to lift a campus poll ban 

 on candidates facing disciplinary or criminal charges.

 The universitys code of conduct is based on the recommendations of the J.M. Lyngdoh committee, appointed by the Centre to find ways of cleansing student union elections of money and muscle power.

 The rampage began in the business district of Hazratganj, where students looted shops and smashed glass panes, and then moved on to the main thoroughfare. 

 But a police baton-charge quickly quelled the rioting and over a dozen student leaders were arrested.

 working in a vehicle workshop was found murdered on Wednesday.

 Court has upheld a Bar Council of India rule that says legal 

 students should have at least 66 per cent attendance in 

 each subject to qualify for their LlB exams. The court was

 Virtual IIT to meet quota rush

 Chennai, Nov. 22: As IITs get set to implement the 27 per cent OBC quota from the next academic year, institute directors are divided on how to meet students needs without compromising quality, reports our special correspondent.

 Establishing a virtual IIT using the latest information and communication technologies could be one way of meeting the growing demand for higher technical education, IIT Chennai director M.S. Ananth said last night.

 The suggestion had already been made to the Union human resources development ministry, he said, but there was no consensus among the IITs on the virtual model.

 Some directors felt face-to-face education and creative interaction was better than web-based lessons and virtual classrooms and preferred construction of new IITs, he said.

 But starting a brick and mortar IIT would cost the Centre a minimum of Rs 750 crore, while about Rs 90 crore would suffice for a virtual IIT, Ananth pointed out.

 The IIT Chennai director was speaking on the need to re-contextualise the IITs for the emerging knowledge economy at the Madras Science Foundation. 

 Ananth said as the demand for quality courses grew, there would be no choice but to go in for distance education.

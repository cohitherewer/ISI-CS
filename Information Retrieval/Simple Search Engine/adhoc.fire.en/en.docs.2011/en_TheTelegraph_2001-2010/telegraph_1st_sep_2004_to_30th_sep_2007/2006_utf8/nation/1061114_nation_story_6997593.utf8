 Geelani warms up to Pak

 MUZAFFAR RAINA

 Srinagar, Nov. 13: Leaving behind years of bitterness in his relations with Islamabad, Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani today left for New Delhi to meet Pakistans foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan and start a fresh innings of friendship. 

 With the proposed arrival of Khan tomorrow to participate in a foreign secretary level talks with New Delhi, the separatist politics in Kashmir has picked up steam. 

 A four-member delegation of the Hurriyat moderates and other separatists, including Democratic Freedom Party president Shabir Ahmad Shah and Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik, are meeting the Pakistan foreign secretary tomorrow. 

 Both Shah and Malik said they would seek the involvement of Kashmiris in the dialogue process. 

 The Hurriyat moderates delegation is without its leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, who is in Cairo to attend the Pugwash conference. 

 Minutes before Geelani left for Delhi, he appeared a mellowed man and restrained from criticising Pakistan. Instead, he hoped he would be able to convince Pakistan that it should pursue its traditional stand on Kashmir. 

 I will ask Pakistan to clarify its stand on various proposals like self-rule and autonomy put forth by mainstream political parties, he said. Pakistan has a traditional stand on Kashmir and it should not budge from it. No other solution but the right to self determination for Kashmiris is acceptable to us. 

 Geelani chose to target India for the alleged human rights violations committed by security forces. The so called peace process between India and Pakistan has not changed the ground situation in Kashmir and I will inform the Pakistani foreign secretary about it. 

 The Hurriyat hardliners relations with Pakistan turned bitter after Geelani discovered Pakistans flexibility towards India for resolving Kashmir allegedly under the US pressure. Geelani favours implementation of UN resolutions as the only way to solve the issue and he has set harsh pre-conditions for participation in the dialogue process. 

 A one-time favourite of Pakistan, Geelani opposed President Pervez Musharraf for offering self-rule proposal and other measures for solving Kashmir. He was also critical of the opening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, arguing such confidence-building measures dilute the Kashmir issue. 

 This earned him Pakistan isolation. Musharrafs regime favoured the moderate Hurriyat led by Mirwaiz Omar Farooq. The Hurriyat was divided after Geelani blamed the moderates of not opposing separatist leader Sajjad Gani Lone for a clandestine support to the 2002 Assembly elections here. 

 The opposition to Pakistan earned him isolation from the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC). The OIC, which would invite him to its annual conferences, preferred his rival Mirwaiz in the last two events.

 Last time Geelani met any top-level Pakistani dignitary was in April 2005, when he had a meeting with Musharraf in New Delhi. After that he refused to meet any Pakistani official. 

 Geelani was twice extended invitation, on March 23 on Pakistan day and an Iftaar party at the Pakistani high commission, but on both occasions he declined to meet.

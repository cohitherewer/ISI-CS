 Radio is not yesterdays news

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: Television has not quite silenced the radio.

 In Mumbai and Delhi, an increasing number of people are listening to radio, though few would call the growth spectacular.

 The findings have come in a survey, Indian Listenership Track-2006, released this week by the Media Research Users Council and its partners AC Nielsen ORG Marg. According to it, there was a 4 per cent growth over the last year in the number of people in Mumbai who recalled listening to radio yesterday. The increase in Delhi was 9 per cent.

 A larger proportion of radio listeners who tuned in yesterday than those who recalled listening to radio in the last seven days is seen as an encouraging sign by those who still find the medium powerful. The survey polled 4,500 people over the age of 12 between July 1 and September 9.

 In Mumbai, over 25 per cent of those surveyed said they listened to the radio seven days of the week; in Delhi, it was 28 per cent.

 Before the trends begin to look like a phenomenon, another set of figures will bring some perspective. In Delhi, 40 per cent of those surveyed said they dont listen to radio even one day a week. The figure was 50 per cent in Mumbai. Both figures are among the largest in the survey.

 In Mumbai, the average radio listener tuned in to 1.6 radio stations; in Delhi, it was 1.7. The exercise is mainly for the benefit of advertisers, given that it helps them figure out where to put their money.

 Early this week, a British expert was in Delhi making a pitch for radio as a medium worth spending a bit more of your advertising budget on. Martin Bowley, chairman of the British Television Advertising Awards, cited surveys in Britain at a seminar, Radioworks 2006.

 Radio, at least in Britain, is a more trusted medium than print or television. Radio and television work great when combined in advertising campaigns, he said. TV could be used for building a brand, and radio, for product-specific promotions. Ads on radio, which impart a personal, friendly touch compared with the distant nature of TV, work as reminders to small-screen campaigns.

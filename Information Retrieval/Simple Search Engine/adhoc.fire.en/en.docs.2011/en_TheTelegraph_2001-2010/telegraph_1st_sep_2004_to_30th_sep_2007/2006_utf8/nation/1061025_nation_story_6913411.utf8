 Bytes fine but dont forget barbers

 A tailor and an IT 

 employee: Helping each other 

 Hyderabad, Oct. 24: Infotech is hot in Andhra, but hardly its mainstay, according to a fresh set of figures that busts the myth the sunrise sector eclipses other areas of the service sector in its contribution to the states economy.

 Sample this: the IT sector contributed Rs 1,490 crore to the gross state domestic product (GSDP) the value of all goods and services sold in 2004-05. Thats a lot of money, but still shy of the Rs 1,492 crore that laundry shops, tailors and barbers together totted up.

 Andhras infotech firms employ 1.25 lakh and, while figures for self-employed in the largely unorganised sector are not available, it would clearly be several times the number of those who work in new-economy ventures.

 Saroja Rama Rao, the director of the Andhra Pradeshs economics and statistics directorate, which released the figures, says the services sector gave the state 47.8 per cent of its income and agriculture 28.69 per cent in 2004-05.

 Andhra Pradesh was the first among states to shift the base year a reference year against which all comparisons are made in future to 1999-2000 from 1993-94. The statistical adjustment has led to a 3.3-per cent increase in the contribution of all sectors.

 The gross state domestic product in 2005-06 was Rs 225 lakh crore while the per capita income was Rs 25,625 on an annual basis, says Rao.

 IT evangelists might find it tough to countenance the fact that those in the business of lending death a semblance of dignity make the kind of money not many manage to make in life. 

 The earnings of funeral service providers were put at Rs 736 crore, much of it going to those working in crematoriums, sundry labourers and burial services. This is among the 44 new sectors included in the GSDP on directions of the Central Statistical Organisation, Rao adds. 

 The figures dont seem to throw up a neat fit for tailors, whose earnings have been snipped from Rs 750 crore in 2000 to Rs 447 crore in 2004. The slump is largely because of the invasion of readymade garments, says Rao.

 Event management, not too big a money-spinner until the glamour parades and culture carnivals came into vogue, is a surprise performer. These events contributed Rs 702 crore to the GSDP in 2004-05. Whats more, the figure is expected to go up 20 per cent next year (2005-06), says Rao.

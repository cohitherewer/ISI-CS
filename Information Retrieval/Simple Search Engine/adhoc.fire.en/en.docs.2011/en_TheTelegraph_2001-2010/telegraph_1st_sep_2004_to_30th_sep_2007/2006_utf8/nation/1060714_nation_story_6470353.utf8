 Mulayam clean chit to Simi

 OUR BUREAU

 Lucknow/New Delhi, July 13: Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party today virtually gave a clean chit to the banned Students Islamic Movement of India, accused of helping the Lashkar-e-Toiba carry out Tuesdays Mumbai train blasts.

 Simi is not a terrorist organisation. Some of its members may be involved in terrorist activities and action should be taken against them, Samajwadi state general secretary and PWD minister Shivpal Singh Yadav said.

 Mulayam told reporters the outfit wasnt involved in the March 7 Varanasi blasts or the Ayodhya attack on July 5 last year as alleged by investigators.

 Simi was not found to be involved in the two main terrorist incidents in the state, the chief minister said. There is, however, a central ban on Simi and it is being enforced in the state.

 Uttar Pradesh is where Simi was formed three decades ago and remains the nerve centre of its activities. But the Mulayam government has for a long time been accused of turning a blind eye towards its activities under pressure from some of its MLAs and ministers.

 In May, a state home department official had said the administration mightnt support the continuation of the ban on Simi ? clamped by the Centre in December 2001 ? since it wasnt involved in any activities and no complaint had been received against it.

 State Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh today said his party had, under the Right to Information Act, sought letters written by the state to the Centre advocating the lifting of the ban.

 The comments by Mulayam and Shivpal come a day after state police chief Bua Singh declared Simis role was under the scanner and Union home ministry sources said states where the outfit is active have been told to raid probable hideouts.

 A veteran once associated with Simi said the organisation had started out as an Islamic study group, as youth were increasingly misinterpreting Islam. 

 Today, however, it appears to have been taken over by elements outside the country, and has other people who propagate a violent form of Islam.

 Former Simi president Shahid Badr Falahi, however, denied the outfit had a hand in Tuesdays carnage and accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, intelligence agencies and a section of the media of launching a propaganda war against it.

 Simi cadre have been linked to several terrorist acts in Mumbai, including a string of blasts in 2002 and 2003, and the huge amounts of explosives, including RDX, seized across Maharashtra in the past six months.

 At least eight of its activists were suspects in the Ayodhya attack.

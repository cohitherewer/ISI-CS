 Malaysian boycott after snub

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Jan. 8: Indias reputation for hospitality was dented at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas today when a visiting Malaysian minister claimed that he and his team had been repeatedly insulted.

 We have been treated like terrorists, thundered federal minister Dato Seri Samy Vellu, who protested by boycotting lunch and later events with his entourage of state ministers and officials.

 Vellu said he had been denied entry to two official events: a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and a lunch with the chief ministers attending the three-day function.

 We come from a respectable country and demand to be treated with respect, said the minister, whose ancestors were from Tamil Nadu.

 The Malaysian government has invested in Indian infrastructure projects, mostly in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, in a big way. We had come with big plans to take up many more projects. But we feel insulted and humiliated, said Dato G. Rajoo, a state minister.

 The Divas is an annual function to celebrate the success of Indian nationals and people of Indian origin working and living abroad, and to get them to invest in India.

 The first rebuff to Vellu came yesterday, the first day of the function, when he arrived at Raj Bhavan for the breakfast meeting.

 In spite of possessing an official invitation card, I was not allowed inside Raj Bhavan, he said.

 Oscar Fernandes, Union minister for overseas Indian affairs, had somehow managed to pacify him yesterday; but a repeat snub at todays lunch left Vellu livid.

 The minister was stopped from entering the venue, the Hyderabad International Convention Centre, and directed to the Hitex Centre where a mass lunch had been organised for delegates.

 To Vellu, the ultimate insult was being asked to make it to the centre, half a kilometre away, on foot. Why should I walk? Vellu said, and boycotted the lunch with his team.

 Rajoo said it was obvious that the organisers and police had not been properly briefed, but such a situation was not easy to accept.

 Kalinga Nagar, Jan. 11: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today made Union home minister Shivraj Patil announce an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh for the families of each of the 12 tribals killed in police firing during the protest here against poor compensation for land.

 The announcement was made at Veer Bhumi, the place where the tribals were cremated.

 Patil, accompanying Sonia during her daylong tour to Kalinga Nagar this morning, announced the ex-gratia from the Prime Ministers Relief Fund.

 Before leaving for New Delhi, Sonia told state congress president Jaydev Jena that the All India Congress Committee would give another Rs 1 lakh for the families of the deceased, taking the total compensation to Rs 11 lakh.

 Last week, chief minister Naveen Patnaik raised the assistance from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, but he has not been able to visit Kalinga Nagar.

 Some of his ministers did come to Kalinga Nagar but, fearing a local backlash, they were closeted in the local police station.

 The Congress has always been with the tribals since the days of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. The firing is a great tragedy. The tribals are heartbroken and I feel they are anguished. I have come here to share the grief of the people whose families have been brutally killed. We are going to see to it that justice is done, Sonia said.

 Law and order is an issue which needs to be looked into by the state government, she said after speaking to the families of each of the 12 deceased tribals for about 15 minutes.

 A few minutes after she reached Kalinga Nagar, Sonia walked down the paddy fields where police had fired on the group of protesting tribals. A key highway is still being blockaded by the tribals.

 In Bhubaneswar, Patil asked the state government to finalise its new resettlement and rehabilitation package within a month. The new policy treats unmarried women above the age of 30 as a separate family.

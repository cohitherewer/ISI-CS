 Koda berth pangs

 Koda: Hitting a wall

 Ranchi, Sept. 24: Madhu Koda has four more cabinet colleagues but the chief minister, who carried out his first expansion today by inducting two MLAs each from the JMM and the UGDP, faces an uphill task filling up the remaining slots.

 Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, who administered the oath of office to the four, refused to allow expelled Forward Bloc MLA Bhanu Pratap Sahi a berth in the ministry.

 Razi also asked Koda to fulfil the constitutional criteria of having not more than 12 cabinet members, a task the chief minister is finding difficult to execute. 

 A day after the RJD announced that it would not join the ministry, Koda, who was sworn in last Monday, inducted four ministers Joba Manjhi and Bandhu Tirkey of the UGDP and Sudhir Mahto and Nalin Soren of the JMM to take his cabinet size to eight. The four join Anosh Ekka, Harinarayan Rai and Kamlesh Singh, besides Koda, in the ministry. The portfolios are yet to be handed out. 

 Koda faced a hurdle when the governor put a question mark on Sahi, who has been sacked by the Forward Bloc ostensibly because he was engaged in horse-trading when the Arjun Munda government was reduced to a minority. 

 Although a news communiqu issued by Raj Bhavan said Sahis case was under consideration for certain reasons, sources said Razi put his candidature on hold on as he was facing two arrest warrants issued by a Garhwa court. Raj Bhavan will examine the cases pending against him first, a source said.

 Koda put up a brave front and declared the remaining vacancies would be filled very soon.

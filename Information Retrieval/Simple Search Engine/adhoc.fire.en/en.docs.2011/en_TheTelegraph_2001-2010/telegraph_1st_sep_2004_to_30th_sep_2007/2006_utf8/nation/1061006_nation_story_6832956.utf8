 Delhi trashes US envoys terror tips

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: India today rejected US ambassador to Pakistan Ryan Crockers suggestion that Delhi and Islamabad resolve the issue of terrorism through direct contact rather than talk about it in public.

 Taking strong objection to the remark made by Crocker at a news conference yesterday, Delhi said the ambassador should understand that democratic governments are answerable to people.

 Coming from a democracy like the US, one would expect ambassador Crocker to understand that democratic governments have a primary responsibility to keep their own people fully informed, said a spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs.

 The envoys comment comes at a time when India is set to approach Pakistan with evidence linking its nationals to the 7/11 train blasts in Mumbai. India will take up the matter in the next round of foreign secretary-level talks to be held later this month.

 Crocker, who was appointed ambassador to Pakistan two years ago, also reportedly said that hurling accusations would not serve any purpose. The reference was clearly to Indias allegation that Pakistans ISI had masterminded the serial blasts in seven suburban trains.

 This is not the first time a senior US functionary has made light of Indian claims about Islamabads involvement in the Mumbai train blasts. US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher had spoken in a similar vein immediately after the incident but quickly retracted his statement after a strong objection was registered by India.

 Crockers comment was seen as in line with US support for Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who was portrayed as a hero in the fight against terrorism during his three-week visit to Washington. 

 For the US, the Taliban is still a big threat that can not be fought without Pakistans help. During his visit to Washington, Musharraf gave a detailed briefing on the situation in Waziristan, on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, where a peace deal has been struck with tribal elders.

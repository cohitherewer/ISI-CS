 15 points, not quotas

 OUR BUREAU

 Mohammad Hamid Ansari

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Manmohan Singhs call for a fair share in jobs for religious minorities is seen not so much as an intent of more affirmative action reservations, in particular. 

 The remark is viewed more as a signal for tighter implementation of the 15-point programme unveiled earlier this year by the UPA government. 

 The hint could also be on the need to enforce quotas existing in a handful of states for Muslims and other minorities on the list of other backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes. When the Prime Minister made this statement at the conference, he did not have reservation in mind, an aide said.

 The Centre is already grappling with the problems created by the legislation providing 27 per cent reservation in centrally-aided higher education institutes. Its intention to extend this quota to private, unaided institutions hasnt made matters easy. The Supreme Courts observation that the creamy layer among scheduled castes and tribes must be skimmed off didnt help either. 

 In such a situation, the Centre doesnt want to risk another confrontation with the judiciary or the BJP.

 Experience in Andhra Pradesh has shown that reservation as a tool to pander to the minorities could backfire. The Congress regime, assuming power just after the 2004 polls, enacted a law giving 5 per cent reservation to Muslims in government jobs, only to see it spiked by the high court, which ruled that religion-based quotas were unconstitutional. 

 The Andhra government has since moved the Supreme Court, whose verdict is awaited. The quotas it sought to provide were over and above the reservation already given to certain socially and educationally backward class of Muslims included in the general OBC list. 

 Mohammad Hamid Ansari, the chairman of the National Commission for Minorities, feels affirmative action has to be intensified. Even after liberalisation, the state continues to be the largest employer. While there are established procedures (of recruitment) for the IAS, IPS and other central services, why is it that the minorities, particularly the largest one, are so unfairly under-represented? he asks.

 Ansari said that in spite of National Sample Survey estimates putting the population of OBC Muslims at 40 per cent, they have not got the benefits. The point is that there is a need for more affirmative action.

 He pointed to the model in Karnataka, which enacted a law in 1993 giving an additional 4 per cent reservation to Muslims in government jobs. This was done in spite of the fact that Muslim groups were already among the OBCs and SC/STs entitled to reservation benefits, Ansari added.

 Prime Minister Singh, however, only wants the commitments in his 15-point programme to be fulfilled. These include giving special consideration to the recruitment of minorities in the central and state police forces, besides the railways, nationalised banks and PSUs.

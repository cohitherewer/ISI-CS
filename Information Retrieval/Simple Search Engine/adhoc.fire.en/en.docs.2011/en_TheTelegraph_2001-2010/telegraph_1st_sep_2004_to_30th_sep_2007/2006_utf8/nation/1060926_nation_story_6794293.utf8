 Two Memon aides held guilty

 - Oldest accused appeal for going home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 25: The anti-terror court trying the 1993 serial blasts case today convicted two associates of absconding key accused Tiger Memon on charges of conspiring to bomb the city, acquiring arms training and packing explosives in vehicles.

 Judge Pramod Kodes verdict on accused number 23 Mohammed Iqbal Shaikh and number 49 Nasim Barmare took the total number of convictions in the case so far to 13.

 The two face a minimum sentence of five years in jail to life in prison or even death.

 Shaikh was found guilty of taking part in conspiracy meetings, training to handle arms and packing RDX with timers in vehicles that were parked at various places on March 12, 1993, the day of the explosions that left over 250 dead in the city.

 Shaikh drove an RDX-filled scooter to the congested Naigaum Cross Road near Dadar railway station and left it in front of a doctors clinic. Alert citizens, however, called in police and the explosive-packed two-wheeler was defused on March 14.

 Judge Kode, however, acquitted Shaikh of another charge of throwing hand grenades at the international airport. Shaikh hung his head and was in tears as the verdict was delivered.

 Apart from participating in the criminal conspiracy and abetting acts of terror, Shaikhs accomplice Barmare was found guilty of acquiring arms training in Pakistan, filling RDX in vehicles and throwing hand grenades at Sahar airport. The grenades did not explode. Barmare is the second accused after No. 29 Shahnawaz Qureshi to be found guilty of travelling to Pakistan for arms training.

 Judge Kode also recorded the statements of two of the oldest accused in the case, Dawood Phanse alias Dawood Taklya and Sharif Parkar alias Dadabhai, two landing agents of elusive don Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memons smuggling network found guilty last week.

 Eighty-two-year-old Phanse and Parkar, 75, pleaded for mercy, saying they wanted to return home after 13 years in prison.

 If I have committed a mistake or any offences, I hereby apologise but please show mercy on me as I am an old man and suffering from several diseases, Phanse said.

 He said he had two ailing wives, one 70 and the other 65, and a 35-year-old daughter who insists she would marry only after he is released.

 Parkar, who came to the court holding a stick, said he was sick and old.

 My daughter is 32 and has not married, saying she would not enter into wedlock in my absence.... Please give me a chance to go home and die there, he pleaded.

 I will be answerable to God if I have committed any sins but now I want to go home and finish my uncompleted tasks, he told the judge with folded hands.

 Pak first step to melting Siachen ice

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Pakistan today hinted that it was ready for a conditional authentication of troop positions at Siachen even as Delhi and Islamabad maintained they have not filled the gaps to reach a solution.

 Delhi wants authentication of the positions held at present as a first step to pulling out troops from the glacier for resolution of the dispute.

 Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Mohammad Khan today said that if authentication was for indicating troop positions, it can be accommodated. But it should not be seen as an endorsement of a territorial claim, he said.

 Riaz said there was fear and apprehension on both sides. But at times, fears are like shadows, they can shrink or become formidable, he said, suggesting new ideas needed to be searched. 

 Fears can be resolved to make Siachen a mountain of peace, which can be jointly monitored, he added.

 Asked if Pakistan had moved from its position on authentication, Riaz said it was just a general thought that if there is desire for indication of present position, it would be possible to accommodate it. But if there is an intention to seek endorsement of claim, then it would be difficult.

 The stakes on Siachen were raised with Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri claiming that the two sides were closer to an agreement before Riaz had arrived.

 After the talks today, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said there is still a gap between the two sides.

 Pakistans signal that it was willing to consider a conditional authentication of troop positions at Siachen reopens the box of ideas on ending the war in the icy heights.

 But the Indian government continues to be led by the army in taking a position on Siachen. Defence minister A.K. Antony, in his first big public statement since taking over, said: Our basic stand is consistent. Our first pre-condition is that they must accept the present realities on the ground. If they agree to this, we can think of other things. There is no question of demilitarisation without authentication.

 If Pakistan now agrees to demarcate troop positions on the Saltoro Ridge that, and not the glacier, demarcates the Actual Ground Position Line military experts will be called in to present options. A two-member team of joint secretaries, one from the ministry of external affairs and one from the defence ministry, has already initiated a quiet study.

 One of the most researched military conflicts in South Asia, there is no dearth of proposals on how to demilitarise the region, beginning with Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs idea of building a peace mountain. A suggestion that finds great acceptability among peaceniks and the scientific community is the creation of a Siachen Nature Reserve to be managed jointly by Pakistan and India.

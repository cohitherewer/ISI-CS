 Culture lock on party

 Jaipur, Nov. 7 (PTI): Police raided a party at a farmhouse on the citys outskirts yesterday, apparently because scantily-clad foreigners were swaying to loud music and it was against Indian culture. 

 The cops landed at Baliwal Farms in Jamwa Ramgarh block yesterday after villagers, NGOs and Bajrang Dal activists protested. Police said hard drinks and drugs flowed freely in the party, which had about 3,000 people.

 One of the revellers was arrested for allegedly misbehaving with and roughing up a photographer of a local daily, the police said.

 The party was for the Moondust Festival, a celebration of trance music, which began on Friday. 

 Police found liquor bottles, packets of cond- oms, cigarettes, cigars, reefers and other drugs scattered at the party venue, about 5 km from Ramgarh lake.

 The controversial party was stopped yesterday by the district administration as it was against Indian culture, a senior police official said.

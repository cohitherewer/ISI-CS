 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Natwar Singh today stepped up his offensive against Manmohan Singh, calling him a weak Prime Minister who knew nothing of foreign affairs and lacked the courage to stand by his colleagues.

 It gives me no pleasure to say that he is a weak PM, the former foreign minister said a day after his suspension from the Congresss primary membership for misusing his position to get oil contracts for his son Jagats cousin Andaleeb Sehgal and friend Aditya Khanna.

 I have worked with him (Manmohan) for 40 years.... He knew nothing of foreign affairs.... When I am in difficulty, he does not have the courage or camaraderie to say something in my favour, Natwar said in an interview to a news channel.

 Yesterday, the former minister had launched the strongest-ever attack on Manmohan, saying: I want to write to the Guinness Book of Records that Manmohan Singh is the only Prime Minister of India among the 11 Prime Ministers (he got the number wrong) that the country had who has not won even a municipal election. What is he going to tell me? 

 Calling himself a victim of a conspiracy hatched by two Union ministers, Natwar alleged that they had picked lawyers prejudiced against him to assist the Pathak commission, which probed the oil-for-food scam.

 Asked if he was referring to finance minister P. Chidambaram and science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, he said: It is for you to draw your own conclusion.

 Natwar: Pouring 

 more scorn

 Natwar, however, was kind to the Congress president. Due to my reverence to Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, I will not say a single word against Sonia Gandhi, he said. 

 He reiterated that the signatures on the three letters allegedly written by him to the Iraqi oil minister in the Saddam Hussein regime recommending his son and Sehgal were his, but the content is not mine. 

 The letters are a cut-and-paste job, Natwar said, adding that he had no idea who had concocted them.

 In a statement read out today by Jagat, Natwar questioned the findings of the Pathak committee, saying it had in its own convoluted way totally discredited the basis of Paul Volckers allegations. 

 The statement mentioned that a report of the Permanent Mission of India in the UN on the authenticity and veracity of the Volcker report had said: The Independent Inquiry Committee was headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, whose inclination was to discredit the opponents of US policy.

 The statement further quoted the report as saying: No evidence has been cited and no documentation given on most of the allegations made. 

 Natwar pointed out the report was sent to the Prime Minister on October 30, 2005, and was available to both Manmohan Singh and Justice R.S. Pathak. I wonder why this vital document has been deliberately ignored, the former minister added.

 Blank space fuels buzz

 Priyanka Vadra: Will she, wont she? 

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: In the run-up to this months Congress plenary, Priyanka Vadra is as much on party functionaries minds as brother Rahul Gandhi.

 Will Sonia Gandhis daughter attend the meeting in Hyderabad as a national delegate, a special invitee or a distinguished person? Or will she choose to stay away? The buzz is as intense as that over Rahuls impending elevation in the party.

 Priyanka is not yet an active member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). But she automatically becomes one if she is named a national delegate from any of the states. Most states have finalised the names of their AICC and Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) delegates but Uttar Pradesh has left the job unfinished.

 Party sources said the state Congress president, Salman Khursheed, submitted the list to Sonia with two blanks. The AICC delegates from Sultanpur and Rae Bareli have not been named.

 Sultanpur, Rae Bareli and Amethi are part of the Gandhi familys pocket borough in east-central Uttar Pradesh. Sonia is the Lok Sabha MP from Rae Bareli and Rahul from Amethi.

 According to the party constitution, for every eight PCC (state) delegates, there is one AICC (national) delegate.

 The sources said its Sonias decision who would be named from Sultanpur and Rae Bareli. Priyankas nomination was not a closed chapter: it was up to mother and daughter.

 The sources said Priyanka was unlikely to attend the three-day plenary as a special invitee or a distinguished person. A third slot, that of visitor, has been scrapped.

 The sources stressed that if Priyanka did come, it would likely be as an AICC delegate because of her interest in politics. But she might keep off the meeting because she doesnt want the attention to get divided between her and her brother.

 With Rahuls impending nomination to the Congress Working Committee ? and his prospective appointment as a general secretary ? he is expected to be the centre of attention at the session.

 Priyanka has not come to any large party congregation so far despite invitations. She has campaigned for her mother ever since Sonia began contesting elections, and virtually managed her campaign solo in Rae Bareli in the last election.

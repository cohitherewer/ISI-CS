 Zahira plea cant melt SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 10: The Supreme Court today dismissed Zahira Sheikhs plea to reduce her one-year jail term. 

 Zahira, the key witness in the Best Bakery massacre case who later turned hostile, was sentenced for trying to deflect the course of justice by repeatedly changing her stance during the trial.

 A bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and H.K. Sema, which last month held Zahira (in picture) guilty of contempt of court, rejected her plea to reduce the sentence to a period already undergone and exempt her from paying Rs 50,000.

 In her plea, the jailed Zahira had admitted that she inadvertently committed mistakes because of her illiteracy, poverty and the dismal condition of her family.

 Tendering an unconditional apology for the acts and omissions by her and her family, she said she was a victim of circumstances and prayed for justice blended with mercy. 

 Zahira can, of course, move a review petition, but it will again be heard by the same judges. She can, however, file a curative petition that would be heard by a larger bench. Though she has legal options open, Zahira would not have much to argue as in her application she had virtually admitted her guilt. 

 Zahira was sentenced based on the report of a probe. It began after a website carried out a sting operation showing that she was bribed to change her statement. 

 Zahira admitted that she had lied but denied having received any money.

 and pointed out that her elder brother Nafitullah died on March 2 for want of medical aid.

 Instead of filing a review petition, Zahira had moved an application seeking reduction of the sentence, awarded by the court after accepting the report of the panel that inquired into the changing stand of the Best Bakery case witness. The inquiry followed a sting operation by Tehelka.com indicating that money was paid to her for her changing her stance.

 While admitting that she had told lies before the court, Zahira denied having received any money and pointed out that her elder brother Nafitullah died on March 2 for want of medical aid.

 Nafitullah, who was a rag-picker, was the only earning member of her family, she said, adding that she had no means to pay Rs 50,000 imposed on her. 

 Her father had died a month before the Best Bakery incident on March 1, 2002 leaving behind five children. The family was, thereafter, misused by politicians who exploited their emotions and religious sentiments during elections, she said.

 Nuke talks

 Canberra, March 21 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush has briefed Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Americas nuclear deal with India in a move seen as groundwork by Canberra for a possible policy change to allow uranium exports to India.

 The two discussed the deal after Bush called to pass on his sympathies over a tropical cyclone that devastated parts of the northern Queensland.

 The agreement, reached earlier this month, will see India receive US nuclear technology in return for separating its military and civilian facilities and opening the civilian plants to inspections.

 India wants to buy uranium from Australia. But Canberra maintains it will not sell to countries, such as India, which have not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

 Howard said he discussed with Bush the nature of the deal and the reasons why the US had entered into it.

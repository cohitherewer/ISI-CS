 CBI seeks death for Memons

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 15: The CBI demanded the death penalty for the three Memon brothers convicted in the Bombay blasts case, as the first week of the verdict in one of the worlds longest trials drew to a close.

 Yakub, Essa and Yusuf and their sister-in-law Rubeena were the first accused to be found guilty of involvement in the 1993 blasts that killed 257 people. The charges they have been convicted of carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

 But CBI prosecutor C.S. Sharma said: It is an organised crime and was an incident of mass murder. The manner in which it was carried out was extremely brutal. He argued that it qualified as a rarest of rare case. 

 Sharma sought death penalty for the brothers under Section 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) and Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. He also pleaded for life imprisonment for all four convicts under Section 3 (3) of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act.

 The Memons have not been convicted under Section 302, but the CBI prosecutor wants the conspiracy charge to be read with the murder charge because 257 people were killed in the blasts.

 Defence lawyer Harshad Ponda pleaded that each accused be sentenced according to his individual role in the conspiracy and not held guilty for murder.

 Citing Supreme Court judgments in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and the Parliament attack case, Ponda said Yakub was not deeply involved in the conspiracy and had already served 12 years. Yesterday, Yakub had told the court he was innocent and had been dragged into the case because he was Tiger Memons brother. Tiger is one of the main accused.

 Ponda said Essa, who had served time, was suffering from health problems and Yusuf was a schizophrenia patient, and urged the court to release them.

 The CBI has sought a life term for Rubeena. Ponda pleaded that she had already served 32 months in jail and had two teenage children and an ailing mother-in-law to care for. She had no direct involvement in the conspiracy, he added.

 Ghansar plea

 Mohammed Shoaib Ghansar, convicted yesterday of planting an RDX-laden scooter at Zaveri Bazaar a charge that could draw the death penalty, appealed for a lenient sentence so that he can marry.

 Dressed in an embroidered, spotless white kurta-pyjama and clutching a rosary, Ghansar said his girlfriend has been waiting patiently. She has been waiting for me for 13 years, he said, adding he also had a 75-year-old mother and a 16-year-old sister to look after.

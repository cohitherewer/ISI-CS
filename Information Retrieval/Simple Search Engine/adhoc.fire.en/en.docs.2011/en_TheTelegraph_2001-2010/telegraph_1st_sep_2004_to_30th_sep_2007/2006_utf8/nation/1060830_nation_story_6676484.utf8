 Good news for papers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: City dwellers are spending more time on newspapers.

 The National Readership Study for 2006 says urban residents spend 44 minutes daily on newspapers, up from 41. In rural areas, however, it has declined from 36 to 35 minutes.

 Cinema viewership, too, has declined. According to the study, the number of people who visited movie halls at least once a month last year has declined from 51 million to 39 million. In urban areas, there has been a marginal increase of 0.4 per cent.

 Radio FM has seen an explosive growth. The number of people listening to radio has risen from 76 million in an average week in 2005 to 119 million in 2006. More surprising is the proportionate increase in rural areas is higher than in urban centres.

 Mobile phones have emerged as the newest mode of reaching out up from 1.1 per cent last year to 2.7 per cent, which translates to nearly 22 million individuals.

 But the Net has not added much to its web. From 7.2 million users who logged in every week last year, the number has gone only up to 9.4 million.

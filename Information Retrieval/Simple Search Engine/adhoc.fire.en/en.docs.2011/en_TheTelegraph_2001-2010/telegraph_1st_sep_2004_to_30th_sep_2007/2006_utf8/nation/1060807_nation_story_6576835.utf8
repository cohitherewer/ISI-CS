 Chambal: Gadarias 

 playground

Bhopal, Aug. 6: DSP Ashok Bhadoriya is praying Chambal dacoit Dayaram Gadaria fell to his bullets during a rain-drenched encounter in the Shivpuri jungles last evening.

 He has claimed before Madhya Pradesh police that he shot Dayaram in the chest and has even produced his self-loading rifle as evidence. But there is no trace of the body.

 Dayaram, brother of bandit Rambabu Gadaria, is wanted in over 100 cases of murder, abductions and robberies and carries a reward of Rs 5 lakh.

 In 1999, Bhadoriya, then a sub-inspector in Shivpuri, had made a similar claim. He was promoted and given a cash reward, but the happy times did not last long.

 The dead men Dayaram and Rambabu were arrested a year later in Gwalior district, forcing an angry and embarrassed chief minister Digvijay Singh to order Bhadoriyas demotion.

 Yesterday, Bhadoriya got his chance to settle an old score but the police high-ups are cagey about accepting his claim.

 Sources close to Bhadoriya said the DSP was confident because the tip-off about the dacoits had come from Dayarams nephew Mahendra, now reportedly missing.

 Bhadoriya and his men surrounded the hideout in the Survaya police station area in the dense Shivpuri jungles. In the encounter that followed, Dayaram was reportedly shot but his gang escaped with the body.

 Over 600 policemen have been looking for Dayarams mortal remains without luck so far. 

 Madhya Pradesh DGP Swaraj Puri said he had specific knowledge that Dayaram had been shot. But we are yet to get his body, he said.

 Dayaram, younger of the two bandit brothers, is believed to be the mastermind of the gang. The Gadarias are greatly feared in Chambal. Often described as the Veerappans of Chambal, Dayaram and Rambabu specialise in kidnappings.

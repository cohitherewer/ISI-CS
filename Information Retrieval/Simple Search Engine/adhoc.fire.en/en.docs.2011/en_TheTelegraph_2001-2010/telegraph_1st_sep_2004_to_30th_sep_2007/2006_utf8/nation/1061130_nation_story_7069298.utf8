 9-year-old throttled by cousin

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barrackpore, Nov. 29: The little girl had gone missing since Sunday. Last night, they found her body.

 Nine-year-old Sarmistha Das had been throttled, police said, by her cousin Bappa, who lives two houses away from her Vivekanda Nagar home in Jagaddal, about 30 km from Calcutta, and two others.

 North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said dispute over property led to the murder. We have arrested Bappa and his friends, Rajat and Bubai. They have confessed, the officer added.

 Investigators said the Class III student, whose body was found beside Kalyani Expressway near Jagaddal, was last seen going out of her house with Bappa on Sunday evening.

 Bappa often used to play with her. That evening he took her out saying he would buy her chocolates, said Sarmisthas father Shyamal, a fire brigade employee in Kankinada.

 Next morning, my brother-in-law got a call. The caller demanded Rs 5 lakh for my daughters release. But no other call came after that, Shyamal said.

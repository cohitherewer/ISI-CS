 Talks about to end, result nil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 13: The third composite dialogue between India and Pakistan to resolve big disputes comes to a close this month, having made little progress. 

 The last round is being held in Islamabad, where officials will try to find a solution to the dispute over the Wullar barrage or the Tulbul navigation project in Jammu and Kashmir. The talks have been rescheduled twice.

 Even before water resources secretary J. Harinarayan prepares to leave for the meeting on June 22, the mood is far from optimistic. Pakistan has adopted a tough stand, demanding the project be scrapped. 

 Delhi holds that the Wullar barrage is being built for navigation, but Islamabad says it will block the flow of the Jhelum, which is a violation of the Indus Water Treaty. This time, the two sides did not even agree on the dates of the talks. 

 According to the composite dialogue schedule, the talks were slated on April 18. Since water resources ministry officials were busy at the time with the Narmada dispute, Delhi suggested a meeting on April 25 and 26. But Pakistan refused, saying they were preparing for a hearing on another dispute with India ? the Baglihar hydro-electric project. 

 Once the Wullar talks are wrapped up, a political thrust will be needed to push the peace process forward, an official said. 

 The composite dialogue covered Siachen, Sir Creek, terrorism and drug trafficking, Kashmir and promotion of friendly exchanges.

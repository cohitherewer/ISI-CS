 Gag off, bloggers plan legal step

 URVASHI KAUL

 New Delhi, July 20: Bloggers are working on plans to file a petition against Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for blocking blog sites.

 Faced with an avalanche of national and international criticism, the government today asked the ISPs to provide unhindered access to blogging sites.

 In a notice to the ISPs, it said it had only asked them to block certain anti-national web pages, not entire blog sites. The Centre threatened to take action against the ISPs if they failed to open up these sites.

 Bloggers, however, said they would legally target the ISPs as well as the government for denying access to sites.

 Sarabjit Roy, a blogger on the popular web site Blogspot.com, which is among the sites blocked for over a week now, is spearheading the action. 

 He said: We plan to file a petition seeking compensation from the government for wrongfully denying access to legitimate blogs by ISPs.

 Indian bloggers are forming a legal coalition to fight the case, he said, adding that the ISPs were unlawfully denying bloggers access to some of the popular blogging web sites.

 In its letter to the ISPs, the department of telecommunications said: It had come to notice that in some cases the parent web site had been blocked in contravention of what was stated in its earlier order dated 13th July 2006 whereby it ordered the ISPs to block certain web sites/web pages. The department has sought an explanation from the ISPs why other web sites were blocked.

 Bloggers are filing incident reports with the governments Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In), specifying how they have been affected. They will need to establish the quantum of damages in each case.

 A petition is expected to be filed in the Supreme Court, claiming damages of up to Rs 1 crore each on behalf of the affected bloggers who have registered with CERT-In.

 Pavan Duggal, a Supreme Court lawyer, said bloggers have remedies under Section 43 of the IT Act, which covers unlawful denial of services.

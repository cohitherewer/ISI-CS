 Buddha attacks Dalmiya, Basu attacks CM

 Bhattacharjee, Basu: The big question

 If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee played his cards wrong about the CAB elections, wasnt Jyoti Basu even more wrong by publicly criticising the chief minister? That is the question that may eventually bother the CPM more. 

 The party will do everything to quickly leave the CAB controversy behind, but it may not be that easy to brush aside the question as to who Bhattacharjee or Basu has embarrassed the party more in the entire episode.

 The first hints of the debate are already here. It goes like this.

 Bhattacharjee was wrong, say some party leaders, in plunging into the battle against Jagmohan Dalmiya. The act did not befit his stature. More important, he had not taken the party into confidence. But his move put the partys and the governments image at stake. The same thing happened when the chief minister flew into a rage over Dalmiyas victory, calling it a victory of evil over good. All this was unnecessary, say these leaders.

 This is not the first time Bhattacharjee has been accused by a section of the party leadership of taking unilateral steps. There is a feeling that he does not consult the party as often as he should and that he wants more to lead the party than to follow it.

 This criticism actually points to Bhattacharjees personality and his style of functioning. He is prepared to be criticised for his beliefs, but he would still act in accordance with them even if that means a fight within the party. Basu, on the other hand, would step back the moment he sensed opposition from within the party.

 But Basus reaction to Bhattacharjees comments on Dalmiya reveals more than a difference in personality. Bhattacharjee attacking Dalmiya was, after all, not an inner-party matter. What Basu did gave the episode a different connotation. It clearly was an extreme case of an inner-party squabble, in which a former chief minister publicly censured his successor.

 Even if party leaders take a public stand of closing the chapter as soon as they can, they will ask themselves why Basu did what he did. After all, in the partys scheme of things, defending Dalmiya cannot be more important than protecting the chief ministers image or the partys unity.

 For the party, Basus action has a disturbing angle. Leaders of other political parties also criticised Bhattacharjee for his remarks on Dalmiya, but Basus denunciation must have hurt, not just Bhattacharjee, but the party more because it almost amounts to a factional fight.

 In Marxist parties, Left sectarianism, like the one the CPM charged the Naxalites with, can be forgiven. But not factionalism. Differences over ideological issues are routine and accepted, but not fights on personal choices. 

 There were others in the party like sports minister Subhas Chakraborty who had publicly differed with the chief ministers support for Dalmiyas rival, Prasun Mukherjee. Basus remarks can be seen as evidence of his support to anti-Bhattacharjee leaders in the party. And, the CAB polls could well be a footnote to a factional battle Basu is seen to be leading against the chief minister.

 But why would Basu play a dissidents game at 93? One thesis within the party is that his recent criticisms of the chief minister show his anger and frustration at the way both Bhattacharjee and the majority of the party leadership have marginalised him. Chakraborty, himself a marginalised leader even in his own district unit, uses Basus name to fight a lost battle.

 There is, however, a more important reason why Basu is increasingly upset with Bhattacharjee. Although Basu was once his mentor, the chief minister wants to disown and dismantle many of the formers legacies. 

 The Dalmiya episode is essentially a manifestation of that process. Dalmiya has long been an irritant for Bhattacharjee, not just because of his alleged acts of omission and commission at the CAB, but more because of what the chief minister considers his exploitation of the Basu government to promote his business interests.

 By hitting out at the likes of Dalmiya, Bhattacharjee has declared his war on some legacies of the Basu era. What can the party do about this battle? It is a safe bet that, despite its reservations about Bhattacharjees strategy for the CAB polls, the leadership, both in Bengal and Delhi, will be with the chief minister in his battle against corruption and corrupting influences on the party. In the chief ministers eyes, Dalmiya is a particularly bad example of corruption and its corroding effect on the party. 

 Biman Bose may have been embarrassed by the CAB episode, but he and most of his senior colleagues in Bengal cannot afford to encourage party leaders who are anxious to queer the chief ministers pitch over all kinds of issues. This has been proved in Bhattacharjees success in the battles within the party over the industrialisation projects.

 After all, Bhattacharjee is the public face of the party as well as the head of the CPMs most important government. Basu is the senior-most leader in Bengal, but he is yesterdays story.

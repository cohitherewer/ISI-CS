 Mumbai, Nov. 3: Police today linked the Mumbai train blasts with the Malegaon explosions, telling a court that a suspect arrested in the second case had received arms training at an ISI-sponsored terror camp in Pakistan.

 Earlier, the police had named the Pakistani spy agency in the 7/11 bombings, believed to have been carried out by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba with help from the banned Students Islamic Movement of India.

 Malegaon suspects Noor-Ul-Hooda and Shabbir Ahmed Maisullah Ansari alias Shabbir Batterywala were today brought to Mumbai where a court remanded them in police custody till November 16.

 Both had initially been detained in connection with a bomb hoax at a shopping centre in Malegaon three days after the September 8 blasts killed 37 people in the powerloom town. They were later arrested and have now been charged, under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, with carrying out the blasts.

 Noor-ul-Hooda Samshudoha (23) is a member of banned organisation Simi whereas Shabbir Ahmed Masiullah (36) has undergone training in Pakistan, sponsored by ISI, the remand application said.

 The police added that they were looking for three other September 8 suspects Mohammed Zahid Abdul Majid, Riyaz Ahmed Shafique Ahmed and Ishtiaq Ahmed Mohammad Isaak.

 The Malegaon victims being mostly Muslims, theories had abounded about who might be responsible for the blasts there. Police sources said the explosives used in the 7/11 and Malegaon attacks were similar: both were a cocktail of RDX, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil.

 In Aurangabad city, the police today seized 20 kg of ammonium nitrate, 18 gelatine sticks and 18 detonators from a man. The stuff, packed in a plastic bag, was to be delivered to a contact in Teesgaon, 25 km away.

 The man, Laxman More, was given the packet by an acquaintance; he wasnt aware of its contents. We are probing the matter, an officer said.

 STAR caught in DTH battle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: STAR channels will not be available on Tata-Sky, the Tata-STAR joint venture direct-to-home (DTH) service scheduled to be launched soon, at least till July, if STAR fails to resolve a channel-sharing row with the Zee-backed Dish TV.

 According to an undertaking provided by STAR in the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal last week, the broadcaster has agreed not to provide its channels to any DTH operator till July 3, the next date of hearing.

 The undertaking came on a petition filed by ASC Enterprises, the promoters of Dish TV, which moved the tribunal when STAR decided not to provide its channels to Dish TV.

 Its a positive development since STAR cannot provide its bouquet to Tata-Sky till it settles with us, A. Mohan, legal head of ASC Enterprises, told The Telegraph. 

 We had invoked the 3.2 clause of the Interconnection Regulation, which states that every broadcaster must provide signals of its TV channels on non-discriminatory terms to all distributors of TV channels, including DTH operators, Mohan said.

 The petitioner had also expressed fears before the tribunal that in case a new DTH service is launched in June and STAR provides its signal to it, Dish TV would lose business.

 STAR and Sony have been missing from Dish TV, which was launched in late 2003 and claims to have a subscriber base of one million in the country. 

 According to ASC Enterprises, Sony should be on board by next week while negotiations with STAR have already started.

 STAR officials, however, said the undertaking at the tribunal would not affect Tata-Skys launch plans. 

 There should not be any delay since we are in discussion with ASC Enterprises and are hopeful of a resolution soon, said Tony DSilva, STAR Indias executive vice-president, distribution.

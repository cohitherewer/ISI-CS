 Absconder cop gets suspension breather 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 22: Encounter specialist Daya Nayak may not be put under immediate suspension due to the anti-corruption bureaus (ACB) probe into his alleged disproportionate assets, Mumbai police commissioner Anami Roy said today.

 The statement from the citys top cop came a day after Nayak was declared an absconder by the ACB.

 Roy said his department would not initiate suo motu disciplinary action against Nayak pending the investigation and denied having received any letter from the ACB recommending such a step. 

 Nayak, who is believed to be in hiding in Mumbai, is likely to file for anticipatory bail tomorrow.

 On Friday evening, the ACB registered a case against the police sub-inspector and his wife Komal under the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly accumulating wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income.

 Three hours later, ACB teams raided Nayaks Kandivli police quarters and six other places belonging to the police official and his relatives. 

 The raids revealed that the encounter specialist, an inspiration for many a Bollywood flick, and his wife had acquired assets worth Rs 41.75 lakh when as a sub-inspector at Charkop police station, Nayak drew a salary of only Rs 9,000.

 It remains to be seen whether the ACB would bring on record financial transactions and benami proper- ties that Nayak allegedly possesses. 

 In 2003, an independent crime branch inquiry into Nayaks assets had revealed that he dabbled in film financing, owned hotels in Switzerland, Dubai and Goa, and also owned at least three flats in Mumbai, a lavish penthouse included. 

 Nayaks exploits as one of Mumbai polices Dirty Harrys between 1998 and 2001 ? when he is said to have shot down 83 gangsters ? inspired the film Ab Tak Chhappan.

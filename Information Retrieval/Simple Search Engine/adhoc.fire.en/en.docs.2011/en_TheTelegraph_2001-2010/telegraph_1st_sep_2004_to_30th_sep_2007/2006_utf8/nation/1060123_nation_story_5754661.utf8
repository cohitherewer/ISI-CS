 Private reservation on backburner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Jan. 22: The Congress is keen to give a quiet burial to reservation in the private sector.

 The party would not say so on record but sources said the reservation issue would be given a go-by because the Congress did not wish to anger the corporate sector.

 Sources associated with the drafting of the economic resolution at the plenary spoke of a tug-of-war of opinions between Left-leaning members and others when the document was being finalised.

 The resolution, adopted by the AICCs subjects committee, does ask the government to evolve legislative and administrative support for implementing affirmative action.

 But, the sources said, the Congress is unlikely to pursue it as a priority area if the party could help it. The party would instead support calls for special apprenticeships and other training programmes for the weaker sections, they added.

 A group of ministers is now eliciting views from various quarters.

 The economic resolution today trod cautiously on divestment and opening up the retail trade, hoping to gloss over inner-party contradictions on these tricky issues by focusing on the governments social sector programmes.

 The party praised the Centre for reversing the Vajpayee governments policy of indiscriminate and non-transparent privatisation and urged it to strengthen the navratnas to help them become globally competitive.

 The resolution stressed that under no circumstances should the navratnas be privatised while divestment in other companies should be taken up selectively on a case-to-case basis. The funds raised should not be used to meet revenue expenditure but will go to the National Investment Fund to aid social sector initiatives.

 This was taken as the first cohesive policy statement from the party on an issue that has been bothering the government since the Left opposed its decision to divest part of its shares in Bhel, a navratna. The move was put in cold storage.

 Later, finance minister P. Chidambaram said there was no contradiction between the two statements that simultaneously sought to strengthen the navratnas and opposed their privatisation.

 The 16-page document, drafted by a sub-committee headed by Veerappa Moily, focused on the governments social sector programmes such as the National Employment Guarantee Scheme, Bharat Nirman and the National Rural Health Mission ? issues the party hoped would appeal to the common man.

 But the veneer of social commitment could not hide the silence on labour reforms and ambiguity on retail trade. The Congress called on the government to strengthen the supply chain for the retail sector.

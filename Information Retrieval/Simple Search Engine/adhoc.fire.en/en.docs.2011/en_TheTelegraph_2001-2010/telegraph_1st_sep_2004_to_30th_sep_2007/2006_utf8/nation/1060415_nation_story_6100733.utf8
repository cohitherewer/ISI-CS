 Ruling on CBSE

 New Delhi, April 14: The Supreme Court has refused to stay a Delhi High Court order making it mandatory for schools to obtain no-objection certificates from respective state governments before seeking CBSE affiliation, reports our correspondent. 

 The December 9, 2005 order was challenged by the Independent Schools Federation of India, an association of unaided schools.

 Acting on its petition, a bench headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, refused any interim relief without hearing contentions on behalf of CBSE. The court also issued notices on the CBSE. 

 Earlier, the federation had objected to the order while contending that if such a practice were made compulsory, several schools would be deprived of affiliation. It argued that the terms were onerous and would affect students studying in schools in various parts of the country. The association also asked the CBSE not to insist on NOC in case a state government did not decide on a schools application within three months.

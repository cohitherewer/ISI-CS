 Judgment day for Salman

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: Salman Khans fate in the 2002 hit-and-run case could be decided tomorrow when his lawyer cross-examines the only eye-witness to the accident that killed one person.

 The actors lawyer, Dipesh Mehta, is scheduled to cross-examine police constable Ravindra Patil, also the complainant in the case, before a metropolitan court in Bandra at 3 in the afternoon.

 Patils revelations could prove to be crucial to the judgment at a later stage. 

 The constable, who was Salmans bodyguard when the accident took place, had earlier told police in his statement that on September 28, 2002, he had advised the Bollywood star to drive slowly, but a drunk Salman ignored him. Soon after, the actor ? at the wheels of a Toyota Land Cruiser ? failed to negotiate a sharp right turn and rammed into a pavement near American Bakery on Bandras Hill Road, where five bakery employees were sleeping.

 Patil had not said this in the original FIR lodged at the Bandra police station. His statement that Salman drove rashly came in the second statement recorded by the police after the public outcry. We feel it was not a voluntary disclosure by Patil, Mehta told The Telegraph today.

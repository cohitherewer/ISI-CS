 Bare-all breather for UPSC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: Delhi High Court today stayed the Central Information Commission order asking the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to disclose examination details, including the marks of over 2,000 students who had appeared in exams this year.

 The stay comes a day after the UPSC filed a writ petition against the CIC order, which, it said, violated the official secrets act. 

 Justice Anil Kumar, hearing arguments for almost four hours, stayed the CIC order till January 16.

 The UPSC has written to chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah seeking an appointment, and said it did not want a confrontation.

 The CICs November 13 order came after more than two months of legal wrangling during which the UPSC tried its best to escape having to reveal examination details.

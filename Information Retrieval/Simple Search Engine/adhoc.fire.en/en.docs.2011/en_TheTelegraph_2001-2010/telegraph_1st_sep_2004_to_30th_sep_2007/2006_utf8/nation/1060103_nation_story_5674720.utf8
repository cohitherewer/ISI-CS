 Black Cats to protect Lalu

 New Delhi (PTI): Railway minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad was given the cover of the elite Black Cat commandos of the National Security Guards on Monday, keeping in view the heightened threat perception to him.

 The decision was taken at a meeting of senior home ministry officials, sources said.

 The railway minister had already been put in the Z-plus category of security cover, the sources said.

 Lalu Prasad is likely to get permission to drive up to the tarmac of the Patna airport as a proposal to this effect had been sent to the bureau of civil aviation security, the sources added.

 Parched pilgrims in Haj hit

 Dubai (PTI): A group of Indian pilgrims, 

 allegedly deprived of water for three days in Mecca, attacked 

 a branch office of their Haj mission over the weekend.

 Computers, printers and furnishings of the mission were destroyed in the attack which also left a pilgrim injured.

 Pilgrims residing in a building in Aziziah, Mecca had repeatedly complained to Indian officials about the absence of water supply, Arab News reported.

 Indian consul-general Dr Ausaf Sayeed said one building had a water problem after the motor pumping the supply broke down. Later, water was supplied through tankers, he added.

 Official sources say this is the first time Indian pilgrims are camping in Aziziah. The Indian mission has rented eight buildings here to accommodate some 12,000 pilgrims.

 Bakri Id plea

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): An Islamic seminary 

 has asked Muslims to avoid slaughtering cows on the occasion 

 of Bakri Id on January 11.

 A book brought out by Deobands Darul Uloom on the concept of qurbani (sacrifice) says Muslims should avoid slaughtering cows as a mark of respect for the feelings of Hindus.

 Honour killing

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): The brother of 

 a 19-year-old carried out an apparent honour killing 

 by allegedly beheading her while she was asleep at a hospital 

 in Meerut, police said. She was recovering from stab wounds 

 inflicted by her brother last December for marrying outside 

 their caste, police said.

 Nadira stroke

 Mumbai (PTI): Veteran Bollywood actor 

 Nadira has been admitted to a hospital in central Mumbai 

 after a paralytic stroke and heart attack, hospital sources 

 said.

 Ninety-seven 

 displaced Pakistanis living in Rajasthan for decades have 

 been granted Indian citizenship. Of the 1,086 Pakistani 

 applicants from Jaisalmer, 1,029 have received citizenship.

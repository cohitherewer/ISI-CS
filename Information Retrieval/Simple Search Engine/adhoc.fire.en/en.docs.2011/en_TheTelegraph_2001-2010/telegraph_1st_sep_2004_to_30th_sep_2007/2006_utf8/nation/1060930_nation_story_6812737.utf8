 Tiny bomb sensor with a dogs nose

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: A tiny insulator 500 times thinner than human hair developed by engineers in Mumbai for near-instant diagnosis of heart attacks may also be tailored to sniff out hidden explosives and soften irritants of air travel in the post 9/11 era.

 The microscopic insulator strip is embedded in a prototype nanoscale device for rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of heart attacks, expected to undergo clinical trials later this year, an electrical engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, said.

 But, under a government-funded project, the IIT Mumbai researchers and collaborating scientists from other institutions plan to use the same technology to develop an explosives detection system that could be deployed in airports and railway stations.

 Theres nothing available today that can achieve what sniffer dogs can with their excellent sense of smell, said V. Ramgopal Rao, a principal investigator in the project. The goal is to develop a reliable system that can eventually replace dogs, he said.

 The main problem with explosives is their emissions are so faint that conventional chemical sensors cannot detect them, he said. Traces of vapours from explosives occur in parts per billion which are difficult to detect with most existing instrumentation.

 Most commercial systems in the global market have drawbacks, said Pramod Soni, a scientist at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) in Chandigarh, a collaborating institution. One very sophisticated machine can detect faint traces of explosives, but it needs about two or three hours before it can be reused, he said.

 The IIT Mumbai team is now trying to develop a sensor that relies on a nanoscale system a strip of insulator so tiny and thin that when it comes into contact with even the faintest traces of explosives, it will gain weight, get deflected, and set off an alarm.

 The project is aimed at unveiling two prototypes within the next 18 months, Rao said. Scientists at the TBRL are expected to evaluate the reliability of the technology as well as develop the entire packaging for the explosives detector.

 While sniffer dogs are still the most reliable of explosive detectors, scientists believe it is time even more sophisticated instruments are developed. Sometimes, cocktails of explosives can confuse even dogs, Soni said.

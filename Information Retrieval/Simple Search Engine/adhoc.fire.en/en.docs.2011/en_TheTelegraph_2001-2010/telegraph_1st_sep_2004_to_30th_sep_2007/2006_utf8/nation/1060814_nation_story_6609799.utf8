 Army to hold fire in Assam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Aug. 13: Delhi has suspended army operations in Assam for a few days as a pre-Independence Day goodwill gesture towards Ulfa, a move that ironically comes in the wake of the militant group unleashing a fresh wave of terror in the state. 

 The announcement tonight coincided with militants hurling a grenade at Congress legislator Rameswar Dhanowars residence in Digboi. The grenade did not explode. Another grenade hurled by militants at a police officer in Nalbari town missed its target and exploded in a drain. 

 Dispur confirmed receiving a communiqu from Delhi about the suspension of counter-insurgency operations by the army. The defence ministry separately communicated the decision to the army establishment here.

 Chief secretary S. Kabilan said the decision had been taken at the upper echelons of power, and army units deployed in the state had no option but to abide by it. 

 Kabilan, who heads the strategy group of the three-tier Unified Command for counter-insurgency operations, said the army offensive against Ulfa militants had been suspended for around 10 days. He said the police would continue to maintain law and order. 

 Director-general of police D.N. Dutta echoed the chief secretary. 

 A senior army commander clarified that Delhis move did not imply a ceasefire. If we are attacked or challenged, we will be free to take action, he said.

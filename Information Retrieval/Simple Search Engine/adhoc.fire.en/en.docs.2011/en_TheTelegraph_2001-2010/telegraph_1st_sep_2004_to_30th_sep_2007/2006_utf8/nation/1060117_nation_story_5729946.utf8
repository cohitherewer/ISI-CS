 Court blow to French ship

 Clemenceau: Choppy waters 

 New Delhi, Jan. 16 (PTI): French warship Le Clemenceau, which is carrying toxic wastes, has been virtually barred from entering India as the Supreme Court today said it would not allow the vessel to be scrapped in Gujarat until the customs department clarifies its stand.

 The customs department has to clarify its stand on French ship Clemenceau, a bench said.

 Even if the high-level committee on hazardous waste management clears dismantling of Clemenceau, we will not permit it without examining the stand of the customs department, the bench said.

 We do not want pollution of Indian water, the court said, adding that it was necessary for the customs department to consider the concerns relating to asbestos, which the ship is carrying. Ultimately, if we decide against, they (Clemenceau) have to go back, the bench said and posted the matter for further hearing on February 13.

 The owners of Clemenceau, a decommissioned ship, gave an undertaking before the bench that they will not bring the vessel within 220 nautical miles of the Indian coast that forms the exclusive economic zone till further orders.

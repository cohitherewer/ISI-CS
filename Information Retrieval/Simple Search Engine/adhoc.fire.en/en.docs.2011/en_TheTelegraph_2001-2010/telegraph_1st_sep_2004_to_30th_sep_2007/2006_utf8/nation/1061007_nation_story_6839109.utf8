 Jessica minister resigns on Sonia call

 Venod Sharma

 New Delhi/Chandigarh, Oct. 6: Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked Haryana power minister Venod Sharma to resign after a STAR News-Tehelka revelation last week that a key witness in Jessica Lals murder withdrew the testimony he gave to police under threat, coercion and inducement by Sharma.

 Manu, the ministers son, was the key accused in the murder who had been acquitted, but the investigation was reopened on court order.

 The sting operation caught on camera a host of witnesses and persons connected with Karan Rajput, a key witness. They said Rajput was forced to change his statement on Jessicas murder in an upmarket Delhi restaurant on April 29, 1999, after he was allegedly paid, given other blandishments and threatened by Sharma. 

 Sharma sent his resignation to Sonia, saying he did not wish to remain a minister so long as the case against him was not settled, said Janardhan Dwivedi, the Congress general secretary in charge of Haryana.

 Sources said Sonia had accepted his resignation.

 Other than the TV revelations, the special investigation team of Delhi police submitted a report to Delhi High Court detailing how Sharma had connived with some officers to shield Manu.

 A relative said: The decision was taken last night after the report was shown to Sharma and he was asked to hand over his resignation letter addressed to Sonia not (Bhupinder Singh) Hooda (the chief minister) to Janardhan Dwivedi.

 Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi attempted to put gloss on Sharmas decision, saying he had scored a brownie point by resigning on moral grounds. 

 Until yesterday, however, senior Congress officials were trying to protect Sharma, arguing that there was no proof against him or Manu. Besides, they said, he had repented sufficiently by serving a seven-year expulsion immediately after his son was implicated in the killing of the model, who was acting as a bartender on the day of the murder.

 The main reason, however, was that Sharma is politically influential, resourceful and close to Hooda. He was also a minister in P.V. Narasimha Raos cabinet.

 On the advice of the Congress central leadership, Sharma served a legal notice on STAR News, majority-owned by ABP Pvt Ltd which publishes The Telegraph, seeking an unconditional apology within seven days. 

 Sources admitted that the strategy had failed.

 The fresh allegations levelled against Sharma were too serious for either Hooda or Sonia Gandhi to overlook. The Opposition Indian National Lok Dal leader, Om Prakash Chautala, too, had been demanding Sharmas resignation, the relative said. 

 Sonia has taken a personal interest in the case. She intervened with home minister Shivraj Patil to ensure that the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to protect witnesses against allurements and intimidation and see they did not turn hostile.

 The objective was to ensure that powerful persons like Sharma could not resort to such tactics and thwart fair trial.

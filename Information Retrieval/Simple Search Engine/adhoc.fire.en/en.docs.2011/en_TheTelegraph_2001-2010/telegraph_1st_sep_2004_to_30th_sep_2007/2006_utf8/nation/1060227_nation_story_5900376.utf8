 Aloof Pawar makes Sonia sit up

 RASHEED KIDWAI 

 Feb. 26: Sonia Gandhi has started paying special attention to Sharad Pawar.

 The Maharashtra leader and agriculture minister, who also heads the Board of Control for Cricket in India, has been behaving a bit too independently for Sonias liking. One recent example was his announcement of wheat import a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had specifically ruled out such a possibility. 

 His friends and ministerial colleagues are equally intrigued by Pawars seeming lack of interest in governance. When bird flu hit Maharashtra, the three-time chief minister chose to visit Karachi to witness an inconsequential one-day international.

 On another occasion, Pawar was uncharacteristically late for a parliamentary panel meeting on agriculture. 

 Coming at a time when proponents of a third front are trying to sell the idea of a non-Congress, non-BJP group, Pawars conduct has made 10 Janpath sit up. Pawar is an old votary of a confederation of regional forces like the DMK, Telugu Desam, Akali Dal and other non-BJP, non-Congress groups. 

 Sources close to 10 Janpath said though incidents like Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidus meeting with Samajwadi leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and CPM general secretary Prakash Karats visit to Lucknow have not led to anything yet, the Congress leadership is keeping a close tab on these developments.

 The Congress leadership is unsure what role Pawar is playing behind the scenes, but cannot believe that he is a disinterested observer. 

 A cabinet minister said Pawar had to be watched also because he had really never given up prime ministerial ambitions. When the government was formed under Manmohan Singh in May 2004, he tried to become an informal trouble-shooter or a sort of convener for the alliance, though the assignment was never formally given to him.

 He was often seen in the company of a sulking Chandrashekhar Rao (over denial of a portfolio of his choice) of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti or Lalu Prasad, who was having a running feud with his estranged Bihar brother, Ram Vilas Paswan. 

 When his mediatory role failed to win appreciation from Sonia and Manmohan Singh, Pawar drifted away. He turned his attention towards another important assignment ? heading the countrys richest sports body. A band of rich and powerful people got together and after a failed attempt, managed to take control of the cricket board. 

 On home turf, the Pawar camp is seeing a battle of one-upmanship. Pawars daughter Supriya Sadanand Sule is making comments suggesting her intention to step into her fathers shoes. But, like the Thackeray family, there is a formidable contender for the same role in Ajit, Pawar nephew who was touted as a successor till the daughter made an entry. Pawar has not indicated his preference but the rank and file of the Nationalist Congress Party is under no illusion about the fathers wishes. 

 Sonia is conscious of Pawars power-play potential. When Manmohan Singh took over as Prime Minister, the Congress chief threw a protective ring around him. Senior ministers like Pawar, Natwar Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and Arjun Singh were gently reminded of the dignity and importance of the office of the Prime Minister.

 Natwar is out and it is not too difficult for Sonia to keep Pranab and Arjun under control so long as she remains as powerful as she is. But the Congress leadership is keeping its eyes peeled on Pawar.

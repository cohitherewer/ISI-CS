 Vajpayee voice for women

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: Women aspiring for more voice as peoples representatives have found an eloquent champion.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee today called for increasing the number of seats in the Lok Sabha by 180 to accommodate more women in the House.

 At a function organised by the BJPs Mahila Morcha to launch a booklet documenting the lives of women achievers, the former Prime Minister said the demand for womens reservation should be fulfilled before the term of the current Lok Sabha ends.

 The BJP veteran felt the main hurdle was the reluctance among sitting MPs to part with their share of seats.

 The men are worried about their seats. They feel it is unfair to ask them to give up constituencies that they have nurtured for years, he said.

 In such a situation, the most practical alternative is to increase the number of seats so that we have more women in Parliament. It is high time we do it. Sixty years have passed since Independence. All parties can sit together and reach an amicable solution.

 Vajpayees formula is simple increase by one-third the total seats in Parliament. As the Lok Sabha has 540-odd seats, it would amount to adding 180 more.

 This would solve everyones problems. The present MPs do not run the risk of losing their seats. The constituency size would reduce, so people can look after their voters more diligently. And we would have more women in Parliament, he said.

 Ramani forgery charge 

 New Delhi, Aug. 5 (PTI): Delhi police have charged Bina Ramani with producing forged documents to acquire a restaurant licence and registered a case against the socialite.

 Ramani runs Tamarind Court, the south Delhi restaurant where model Jessica Lal was shot dead in April 1999.

 A senior officer said the special investigation team of Delhi police registered the case yesterday after it detected the alleged wrongdoing while probing the initial investigation of the Jessica murder. The police officer said the premises of Tamarind Court were not meant for commercial purposes and the documents produced to show that Ramani had the owners consent were forged.

 A case of cheating, forgery and using forged documents under Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged at Mehrauli police station by the special investigation team.

 Ramani has also been booked for producing a forged ration card to acquire the licence to run the restaurant.

 The investigators had earlier questioned Ramani, her fashion designer daughter Malini and husband George Mailhot in connection with the destruction of evidence in the Jessica Lal case.

 Delhi High Court had last week asked the special investigation team to submit a report within two months.

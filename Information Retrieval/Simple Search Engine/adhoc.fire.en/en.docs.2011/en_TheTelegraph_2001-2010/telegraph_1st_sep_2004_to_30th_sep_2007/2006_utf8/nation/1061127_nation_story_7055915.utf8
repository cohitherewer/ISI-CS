 Minister fights judges case

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 26: Law Day functions were where the Union law minister cited judicial encroachments on the executives powers and the Chief Justice of India attacked the government for failing in its duties.

 That tradition was broken today with H.R. Bhardwaj sticking up for the judiciary when Supreme Court Bar Association president M.N. Krishnamani alleged a slump in the quality of judges and corruption among them.

 Talking of corruption (among judges) in public will lead to erosion of the system. This is unjust not only to an individual but to the profession at large. Either you prove it or face it, the law minister said at the function to mark the adoption of Indias Constitution.

 He dismissed the idea of the executive taking over the job of appointing judges; nor would he let non-judges sit on the National Judicial Council to probe complaints against judges. You have to trust judges, the minister said.

 Krishnamani had cited alleged instances of judicial corruption and accused judges of meddling in the governments functioning.

 Bhardwaj said the bar chief had not done his task properly and his comments were unwarranted. He added that it was a question of the image of the institution.

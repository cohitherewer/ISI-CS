 Sena vs Sena, out on streets

 Mumbai, Oct. 10: The party that Bal Thackeray brought up on a stiff dose of violence began devouring its own children today with two factions of the Shiv Sena family fighting a turf war on the streets of Mumbai.

 The clash between the supporters of estranged cousins Uddhav Thackeray, the Sena founders son, and Raj Thackeray was initially concentrated in Dadar, which houses the party headquarters.

 However, late tonight, the fight appeared to be spreading outside the metropolis. Police said skirmishes have broken out in some parts of Aurangabad and Nashik.

 Tension has been building up ever since Raj struck out on his own and launched an outfit, setting the stage for occasional brawls. 

 The trigger today was an altercation between activists of both the parties over putting up banners near a college.

 The incident occurred after supporters of Raj tore a poster of Bal Thackeray near a college in Dadar around 5.30 pm. We had to call in additional forces as things went out of control, joint commissioner of police Arup Patnaik said.

 In retaliation, a poster of Raj was also ripped. Curfew had to be imposed and the Rapid Action Force called in familiar fixtures for the Sena that had been blamed for riots and terrorising whole neighbourhoods.

 The police swung the baton and fired two tear gas shells to disperse the warring groups outside Sena Bhavan and near the headquarters of Rajs party, the Maharashtra Navanirman Sena. Four persons, including a policeman, were injured.

 When the clash began, shops and business establishments hurriedly downed shutters. Uddhav called upon Sainiks across Mumbai to assemble in Dadar. Similar appeals were made by the other camp, too. Later, Uddhav asked his supporters to leave.

 The Sena is extremely possessive about Dadar, its traditional stronghold. Ironically, it is Raj who lives in Shivaji Park, adjacent to Dadar, while Uddhav stays with his father in Bandra East.

 Raj, Thackerays nephew and seen as his heir apparent till a couple of years ago, broke away from the Sena last year after Thackeray Senior chose his son as the party president.

 Wheels land rivals in spot

 - Tamil Nadu opponents anger EC for excessive use of vehicles

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: The excessive use of vehicles during election campaigns has brought both Jayalalithaa and her rival grouping under Election Commission glare in Tamil Nadu.

 The Opposition Democratic Progressive Alliance has earned the poll watchdogs flak for an election rally on April 25 in Chennai where, among others, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi also spoke. 

 The excessive use of vehicles for the meeting ? more than what is legally permitted ? has led the poll panel to issue notices to the DMK, Congress, PMK, CPI and the CPM. But now, all the alliance partners are trying to wriggle out of the controversy, leaving others to shoulder the blame.

 In its explanation, the Congress said individuals and groups used vehicles on which the party did not have any control. 

 The DMK, on the other hand, said the extra vehicles were not part of the convoys but were brought by the cadre of its alliance partners.

 The CPI tried to wash its hands of the matter by saying that the meeting was organised by the Congress and their leaders only participated in it, while the CPM claimed that neither was the meeting organised by them nor did their leaders attend it. The PMK said the party had used only two vehicles for transporting its central ministers.

 The replies have failed to satisfy the poll panel. The commission has gone through the explanation furnished by the Congress and the DMK and is of the view that the spirit of the model code of conduct has not been observed, it said.

 The poll panels ire was not restricted to the Opposition. It also issued two notices to the ruling ADMK, again for using more than the permitted number of vehicles during campaigns. The commission pointed out that chief minister Jayalalithaa used nearly 80 vehicles during her visit to Krishnagiri district on May 1-2. 

 The party has neither taken permission for using so many vehicles?nor did all the vehicles have permits exhibited on the windscreen, as prescribed by the commission, the poll panel said.

 In her reply today, Jayalalithaa claimed only three vehicles formed her convoy, as poll panel guidelines stipulated.

 Collector transfer

 The poll panel has ordered the immediate transfer of the collector of Salem district, Sukumaran, for failing to carry out preventive arrests ahead of the polls on May 8.

 Child labour in state court

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The onus of implementing the ban on employing children under 14 years in households and eateries is now on state governments. The restriction will come into effect from October 10.

 A notification issued by the Union labour ministry last month put domestic households and eateries on the list of hazardous industries where employing children under 14 will be illegal.

 Minister of state for labour Chandrashekhar Sahu has started stepping up pressure on state governments. He has written to them to get ready to enforce the ban.

 The minister has outlined three immediate tasks for chief ministers. They should begin sensitising people to the ban and strictly enforce it from October 10. They have also been asked to put in place measures to rehabilitate children who will find themselves without an income. Child workers are often the sole bread-winners for their families. 

 According to Unicef, India has 75-90 million child workers, who contribute 20 per cent to the gross national product (GNP) the national income in accounting terms. The organisation estimates that one of every five children under 14 who leave their families for work in India ends up as a domestic help. 

 The Centre is likely to issue a notification for the second time barring civil servants from employing children under 14. In 2000, the central civil service conduct rules were amended to prevent government employees from doing so. 

 However, sources in the government are sceptical about how far the ban will succeed. This could be a possible reason for the government thinking about issuing a second notification. 

 In his letters to state governments, Sahu said the children without an income should be accommodated under existing social welfare programmes. All states have welfare homes. The children can find shelter there, an official said. 

 Last week, labour ministry officials held a meeting with other ministries whose activities have an impact on child labour. Each was asked to do its bit to further the cause.

 They were asked to create space for the children in existing programmes, said an official. For instance, the human resource development ministry was told to ensure that out-of-work children get admissions to schools under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan.

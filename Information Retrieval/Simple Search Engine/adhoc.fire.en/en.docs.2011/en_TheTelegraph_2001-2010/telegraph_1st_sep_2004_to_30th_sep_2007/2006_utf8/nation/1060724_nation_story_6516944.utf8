 Punjab polices turn to go private

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Outsource move

 Chandigarh, July 23: Punjab police have decided to outsource some of its services to private agencies.

 Patrolling duties and ferrying specimens to forensic laboratories in different parts of the country are among the areas that will initially be assigned to the private agencies. Security in industrial sectors across the state would follow. Private detectives might be hired in some cases as well.

 The move would make Punjab the first state to hand over its policing departments to the private sector.

 We are short of staff and the upgrade of Mohali and Tarn Taran to districts has put a lot of pressure on the force. We have had to shift personnel from sensitive towns like Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana to the new districts. We will be outsourcing some departments soon, a senior officer said.

 The step will be reviewed after some months. Continuation of the private agencies will depend on the feedback we receive from residents, the officer said.

 In the initial stages, armed private security guards accompanied by police personnel would operate from local police posts. They would have to build their own posts once their services are extended. The police presence would be gradually lessened.

 This way, we can have personnel who can be shifted anywhere as the situation warrants. The Mumbai train blasts have taught us a lot of lessons and we need to pay more attention to ensure the state remains free of terror elements, the officer said.

 The 75,000-strong police force in the state is overworked, he added. Apart from ensuring the day-to-day security of people, the personnel have to remain on constant vigil along the long, porous border with Pakistan.

 While they have to watch that Khalistani terrorism does not rear its head again, growing drug smuggling across the border has posed a new threat.

 We are battling on all fronts. It is not an easy task to provide seamless security to the people. We are looking at ways to privatise some of our duties. Patrolling is a small first step. We are also looking at involving private agencies to handle traffic, the officer said.

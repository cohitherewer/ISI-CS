 CM cut to size to pacify rivals 

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, May 15: CPM politburo member V.S. Achuthanandan, who had missed three chances to become Kerala chief minister, will assume the post on May 18.

 But the 83-year-old chief minister (in picture) will be relatively toothless, deprived of the home ministry. All his predecessors since 1982 have held the powerful portfolio that controls the state police force.

 The halfway house is an offshoot of the intense factional divide in the state CPM, which initially pushed Achuthanandan off the candidates list itself. Eventually, an unusual protest by CPM cadre in public compelled the central leadership to intervene and ensure that Achuthanandan was given a seat.

 The dominant faction of party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan concurred with the politburo prescription that Achuthanandan, perceived as an advocate of traditional Marxist policies, be made chief minister only after ensuring that home would not be with him.

 The frontrunner for home is CPMs deputy legislator, party leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, a lieutenant of Vijayan. A four-time legislator, Balakrishnan is the mascot of the militant lobby, hailing from the northern Kannur district, a red bastion.

 The CPM state committee issued a cryptic statement here this evening, unanimously nominating senior politburo member and Opposition leader Achuthanandan as the next chief minister.

 The day-long deliberations at the party state committee, attended by general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo colleagues Sitaram Yechury and S. Ramachandran Pillai, also decided to have 11 ministers. The ministry size will be 19, one less than the outgoing cabinet of the Congresss Oommen Chandy.

 On the ministrys size, the CPM will have to eat its own words, having criticised the Congress for the jumbo cabinet in a small state like Kerala. Besides, eight out of the 14 state secretariat members are becoming ministers, their focus shifting away from organisational responsibilities.

 M.N. Vijayan, a Left ideologue, said this is not parliamentary deviation but blatant parliamentary ambition.

 The full list of ministers will be finalised at the Left Front liaison committee meeting on Wednesday.

 Left Front convener Paloly Mohammed Kutty, who was almost a consensus candidate for home minister, has opted out and is likely to be made education minister despite being a school dropout.

 None of the Left-backed Independents has been considered for ministerial berths. The CPI has drafted a list of four ministers plus the deputy Speaker.

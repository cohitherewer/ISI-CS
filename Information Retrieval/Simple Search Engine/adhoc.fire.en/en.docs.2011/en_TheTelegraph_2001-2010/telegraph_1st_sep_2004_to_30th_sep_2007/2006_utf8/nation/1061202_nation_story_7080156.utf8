 Watchdog for Sangh, madarsa texts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Schools run by the Sangh Parivar particularly the Vidya Bharati chain of schools are in trouble.

 The government is working on a bill to set up a Textbook Council to vet textbooks published by private organisations. The council, however, will not monitor textbooks brought out by government institutions like the National Council of Educational Research and Training and State Council of Educational Research and Training.

 Those in the direct line of fire are Vidya Bharati schools set up two decades ago to promote the educational movement of the RSS. Vidya Bharati schools include Saraswati Shishu Mandirs, Bharatiya Vidya Niketan, Gita Vidyalaya and Saraswati Bal Vidyalayas. 

 Equally vulnerable will be madarsas that communalise lessons.

 There are 6,000 Vidya Bharati schools with 12 lakh children under 40,000 teachers.

 All the schools in the Vidya Bharati chain use the same material for textbooks, many of which have allegedly distorted history lessons with the objective of carrying out communal propaganda. 

 For instance, some textbooks say that India was partitioned because of the conspiratorial policies of the followers of Christianity and that Christian missionaries even today are promoting anti-national tendencies in Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala and other regions. 

 Some textbooks say Ram Janmabhoomi was invaded no fewer than 77 times between 1529 and 1914 and that over three lakh worshippers were killed defending the holy place in this period.

 It is not just propaganda that the textbooks publish. They also reinforce caste and gender prejudices. There is seldom any reflection of the realities faced by women or Dalits in the textbooks.

 A moral science guide in Karnataka, for instance, says a woman should put up with a violent husband in the hope of being happy when her son grows up to be an adult.

 The curricula in madarsas teach women their domestic roles without mentioning any for the husbands.

 The suggestion for setting up a Textbook Council came from the Central Advisory Board of Education which had set up a committee headed by Zoya Hasan to look into textbook distortions. The committee examined the Vidya Bharati textbooks and found them to be highly communal. It left the decision of a legal framework to the government.

 The human resource development ministry has decided to give the council legal teeth to weed out communal propaganda or any material the council believes violates the Constitution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Hello... Madhuri calling

 - Stage set for Bollywood comeback

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Will she go dhak-dhak 

 again? 

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: Will she? Wont she? With whom will she?

 Months of speculation and many imaginary projects later, the comeback film of Bollywoods original Ek do teen girl Madhuri Dixit has been finally dug out.

 After five years of hibernation post-marriage to US-based surgeon Shriram Nene Madhuri will face the arclights again for an untitled Yash Raj Films project, directed by award-winning cinematographer Anil Mehta, who shot Lagaan, Veer-Zaara and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna.

 A spokesperson for Yash Raj Films confirmed the news to The Telegraph that the film will go on the floors in January 2007. Madhuri Dixit will be making her comeback in a film with the Yash Raj banner, which will be her first film after her break, he said.

 It was the Yash Raj banner which had given Madhuri one of her biggest hits in Dil To Pagal Hai, directed by Yash Chopra himself and co-starring Shah Rukh Khan. Taking that relationship forward, the actress has had several sittings in the last few months with Aditya Chopra Chopras son, who is the producer of all Yash Raj Films productions to determine the right film for her return.

 Madhuris long-time secretary Rakesh Nath said although she was offered many scripts by film-makers, she chose the Anil Mehta film. Madhuriji is also slated to do a film directed by me but the Yash Raj film will now happen first. 

 All the reporting that Madhuri was going to do this film and that had no substance, Mehta told The Telegraph. Adi (Aditya Chopra), scriptwriter Jaideep Sahani and I sat for weeks to lock the script of the film before it was sent to her. The project had been conceptualised as a good vehicle for her comeback.

 Unwilling to assign a genre to the film or reveal the rest of the cast, Mehta confirmed that the script has been written around her. 

 She is definitely the central protagonist, he said. I have been a big admirer of Madhuri but have never worked with her even as a cinematographer. So it will be a nice challenge for me. 

 The last time Madhuri was seen on the big screen was in 2002 as the charming courtesan Chandramukhi in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Devdas. The film marked a grand climax for the actress who had ruled the film industry and millions of hearts right through the 80s and 90s with films like Tezaab, Parinda, Dil, Saajan, Beta, Khalnayak and Hum Aapke Hain Koun! 

 Currently in the US, Madhuri will again set up base in Mumbai for the shooting of her comeback film. She is very excited to get the opportunity to spend quality time in Mumbai all over again and plans to do one to two films a year from now on, revealed Nath.

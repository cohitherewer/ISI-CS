 EVM lessons for next phase

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 19: After the mishandling of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in two Purulia booths led to repoll in Jhalda, deputy election commission R. Balakrishnan today sought a training session for all presiding officers before the next phase of polls.

 Balakrishnan was addressing district magistrates from Writers Buildings via video conference. 

 The repoll at Jhalda was not ordered because of EVMs malfunctioning. The machines were mishandled by presiding officers. Also, the spare EVMs in possession of sector officials couldnt be started. This shows theres complete lack of training in handling EVMs, said an election official present at the video conference.

 Digital cameramen will now have to report to DMs two days before elections to ensure they are tagged with the right polling teams. In the first phase, many camera teams didnt report and substitutes had to be found at the last stage, the official said.

 Balakrishnan described the video conference as a meeting on poll preparations, where suggestions were made for bettering administration in the next phase. The three districts in the first phase were a challenge for us. The EC is happy with the first phase of polls and the same formula would be applied elsewhere, he said after his arrival here this morning.

 As for booths that recorded over 80 per cent votes, he said all documents had been checked and no discrepancies were found. 

 In the next phase, officials have been asked to ensure that queues of voters are at least five feet away from the entrance to the polling booth. 

 Voters will stand between five to 10 feet away to prevent overcrowding and to help the CPMF (central paramilitary force) jawan regulate entry better. Also, the fourth polling officer was found sitting inside the booths in some places during the first phase. Strict instructions have been issued to ensure that this officer stands outside to check the EPIC (electoral photo-identity card), said an official.

 Bengal chief electoral officer Debashis Sen will tour Hooghly, Howrah, East Midnapore and Nadia along with deputy election commissioner Anand Kumar tomorrow. They will review law and order, deployment of central forces and warrant execution besides addressing complaints.

 Superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, S.N. Gupta said nearly 1,000 booths in the district have been marked sensitive. Areas where Maoist posters appeared, including Bishnupur, Thakurpukur and Gosaba, are being particularly watched, he added.

 The Left Front said it was pleased the Election Commission had declared the first phase of polls free and fair. But, front chairman Biman Bose added, the huge turnout was not the result of the poll panels awareness campaigns, but because of party workers efforts. Through our relentless mass contact, we reached out to 100 per cent of the voters.

 Show stars fall like nine pins

 John Abraham: Recovering

 Mumbai, April 12: The stars of some top names in Bollywood appear to be on the wane. While some are having a brush with the law, others are grappling with health problems.

 The turn of events has put a much-hyped world tour in jeopardy.

 The Rockstar 2006 show of the Morani Brothers got a jolt when Salman was sentenced to jail.

 Saif Ali Khan, also part of the troupe, had to undergo an appendicitis surgery in Bangkok. He is still recuperating and will not be able to dance during the first leg of the tour, which will travel to Canada, USA, UK and Europe.

 John Abraham hurt his knee and ankle in a freak accident and had a brush with the law.

 Even as he walked out of Lilavati Hospital today, Esha Deol sprained her ankle during a shoot.

 The Moranis are a little worried but they are putting up a brave front.

 Whatever happens, the show will and must go on. We were to leave on April 17. We might have to postpone the departure and go on April 19, said Ali Morani. The fans love the stars and their presence on the stage ? whether they dance or not ? will be exciting, said Morani.

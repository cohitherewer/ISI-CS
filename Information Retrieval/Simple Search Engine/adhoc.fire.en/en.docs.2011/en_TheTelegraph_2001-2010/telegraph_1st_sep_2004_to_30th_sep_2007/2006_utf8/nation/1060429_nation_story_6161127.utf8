 Navy nod to Pak games

 Udhagamandalam, April 28 (PTI): The Indian Navy is ready to undertake joint exercises with Pakistan as the two countries enjoy an excellent relationship, Admiral Arun Prakash said today.

 It (relationship) is excellent and if we get a chance, we are ready to go ahead with joint exercises with the Pakistan navy, the chief of naval staff said.

 He said the navy had such exercise programmes with the US, the UK and Oman. An exercise with the French navy was a rewarding experience, the navy chief added.

 Admiral Prakash said the proposal to set up the armed forces tribunal is a good idea. It is under the governments scrutiny and will be implemented any time. 

 The navy has taken steps to protect Indias maritime boundaries in the wake of the Sri Lanka trouble, he said.

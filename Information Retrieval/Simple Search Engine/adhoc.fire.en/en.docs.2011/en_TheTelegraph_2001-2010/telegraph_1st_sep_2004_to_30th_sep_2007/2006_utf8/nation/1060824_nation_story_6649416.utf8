 PM clears air on nuke leash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Tests, when 

 needed 

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: India 

 is free to take decisions on nuclear tests in future as 

 the moratorium on these exercises is totally unilateral, 

 Manmohan Singh told Parliament today.

 In his fourth statement on the 

 Indo-US nuclear deal, the Prime Minister said no commitments 

 had been made on tests, which could be done when the 

 need arises.

 We have agreed to a unilateral 

 moratorium. But we can take a sovereign decision on detonation. 

 We are not willing to sign a bilateral CTBT with the US, 

 Singh added.

 The Prime Minister dwelt largely 

 on how nuclear power was essential to energy security. But 

 B.C. Khanduri of the BJP disagreed that Indias nuclear 

 programme was designed to meet energy needs. It was 

 odd that you should say the primary motive was production 

 of energy. Our programme was military in nature, Khanduri 

 said.

 Singh replied that even Jawaharlal 

 Nehru had envisaged nuclear power as a crucial component 

 of Indias energy security. 

 Our programme was very much 

 designed for peaceful usage, he said. 

 According to him, nuclear power 

 has to be considered as an important source of energy. We 

 are not suggesting that nuclear power is the only way out. 

 But the supply and prices of oil are uncertain. We have 

 to think of widening our options. 

 He allayed suspicions over the 

 legislative process in the US, saying India would review 

 its stand if extraneous conditions were added 

 to the July 2005 pact. The future would be decided 

 by Parliament, the people of India, not by a legislation 

 passed any- where else.

 Here is Singhs position 

 on some crucial points in the nuke deal:

 On the vote against Iran in IAEA: 

 Iran enjoys the privileges of being an 

 NPT member, so it has to honour the commitments and responsibilities. 

 India does not favour coercive methods to force its hand

 On the prototype fast breeder reactor: This 

 will be completely out of surveillance. Decisions on putting 

 future civilian reactors under watch will be considered 

 later

 Is India on a par with nuclear weapons states? 

 The July 2005 agreement 

 describes India as an advanced nuclear state. It is the 

 only country outside NPT whose nuclear sites will not 

 be inspected.

 Fresh B-school blow to Kurien

 Ahmedabad: The board of the Institute of Rural Management removed Verghese Kuriens hand-picked director L.K. Vaswani and appointed a former student, Nilima Khaitan, acting director on Thursday, reports our correspondent.

 National Dairy Development Board chairperson Amrita Patel was the interim chairperson after Kurien resigned from the Anand institute on June 5. 

 He would have faced a no-confidence motion at the meeting if he had not stepped down.

 Eleven of the 14 board members attended the meeting and unanimously accepted Kuriens resignation, said V. Ramachandran, a government nominee on the board. Vaswani was not present at the meeting.

 Two of the members who did not attend the meeting are Father Abraham, the director of the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, and Hasmukh Shah, chairman of the governing board of the National School of Design, Ahmedabad. Sources say Shah is one of the likely candidates for the directors post.

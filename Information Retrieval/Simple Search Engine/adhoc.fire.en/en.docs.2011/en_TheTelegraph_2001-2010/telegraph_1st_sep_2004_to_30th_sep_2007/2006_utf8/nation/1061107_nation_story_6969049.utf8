 Maoists spill CPM blood 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 6: About a dozen masked men dressed in black gunned down a CPM local committee member in Bengals Nadia district today. 

 Abdul Gani Mondal, 53, was hit by at least seven bullets which, police said, were fired from muskets by suspected Maoists.

 People who saw Abdul being shot at Phasilnagar in Karimpur said the gangsters in black vests, black trousers and masks had walked in and asked a farmer his whereabouts. 

 Around 11 am, the group arrived on the paddy field where Abdul was inspecting his irrigation pump inside a small room where it was installed. His son Lenin was working on the field at a distance. We were far away working in our fields. Suddenly we heard the gunshots and saw the assailants running away, said a farmer. 

 The guerrillas shouted Maoist slogans while escaping towards Domkol in Murshidabad district.

 In June last year, Abduls younger brother Abdul Latif Mondal was shot dead by Maoists.

 Lenin told police the rebels had warned him against working for the CPM. They ordered Lenin to distance himself from the CPM or meet the fate of his father and uncle. He recognised some of them, a senior officer said. 

 This June, masked guerrillas gunned down CPM leaders Swapan Sardar and Uttam Sardar in Nadias Chandpur. 

 As the news of Abduls death spread, CPM activists attacked the homes of over 40 villagers accusing them of having links with the CPI (Maoist). 

 Two fire engines from Tehatta rushed to Phasilnagar, about 200 km from Calcutta, and doused the fire three hours later. The police said the damages were extensive.

 Nadia police chief Ajay Nand went to Phasilnagar with senior officers. We suspect the Maoists hand, he said.

 A police camp had been set up near Abduls house after his brother was murdered. 

 The local CPM alleged that Abdul was killed as he took the initiative to revive a ferry service between Karimpur and Domkal, which the Maoists closed down two years ago. His brother was also killed for the same offence. Children could not go to school as the service was closed. Trade between Murshidabad and Nadia suffered, said Karimpur MLA Prafulla Bhowmik.

 Mulayam late, girls faint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, 

 Sept. 27: Nineteen schoolgirls fainted this afternoon 

 waiting for Mulayam Singh Yadav to hand out doles at a Meerut 

 function.

 The incident at Victoria Park the site of a killer blaze at a fair early this year was a replay of events on Gandhi Jayanti last year, when children standing in scorching heat for Amar Singh at Kanpur passed out.

 The Uttar Pradesh chief minister was to arrive at 9 am, but he did so only at 11.15. Hungry and dehydrated, the teenage girls began fainting one after another.

 At least 19 among the congregation of more than 15,000 had to be taken to various hospitals in the town.

 A doctor at Meerut district hospital said three girls would be under observation till tomorrow. The rest were discharged this evening. Most were revived with glucose drips.

 It had been announced earlier that cheques worth Rs 30 crore would be given to 20,000 boys and girls as part of the chief ministers scheme of offering kanyadhan (gift to girls) and unemployment doles to boys.

 The podium erected at the venue and the shamiana strung over the ground did not cover the entire open stretch, leaving students, many of whom were waiting since 4 in the morning after having arrived from districts like Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur, at the mercy of the blistering sun.

 What made matters worse was that there wasnt enough drinking water. 

 We were sitting in the middle of the ground and it was difficult to reach the water tap. No volunteers were trying to bring us water, said Aparna Soni, moments after regaining consciousness at a makeshift health camp at the venue that could treat no more than five at a time.

 Teacher probe leads to body

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 24: Police probing the mysterious disappearance of a Meerut university lecturer have recovered a decomposed body resembling her, but her relatives have not identified it yet.

 Kavita Chaudhary, a PhD in history who taught at the Chaudhary Charan Singh University, went missing from her campus residence, where she lived alone, on October 23.

 A diary found in her room names two leaders of the Rashtriya Lok Dal one is a former minister while the other is currently a minister in the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. Relatives claimed Kavita was forced to leave her home under pressure from the RLD minister on the night of October 23. 

 Ravindra Pradhan, one of the four accused who surrendered at the office of a news channel in Noida today, confessed to having escorted Kavita to the ministers home that night.

 Pradhan, who will be produced in a Meerut court tomorrow, claimed Kavita was alive and is being held captive somewhere. He told reporters: Two Uttar Pradesh ministers can reveal where she is.

 The headway came after a new team under Meeruts senior superintendent of police Navneet Sikera took charge of the probe. This followed the suspension of an officer-in-charge today for failing to make progress in the case.

 Kavita had spurned a marriage proposal allegedly made by one of the RLD leaders.

 This evening, the police took her relatives who suspect that she was killed to identify the body found 20 km from Meerut. 

 In a handwritten note found in her room, Kavita alleged she was being forced to go with the ministers men as their followers threatened to kill members of her family. She even left the phone number of the minister making threat calls to her.

 There was no response to calls made by Kavitas brother to her cellphone, an FIR lodged on November 2 said.

 Simmering tension over the disappearance spilled on to the streets today with students putting up roadblocks. Rahul Tyagi, a student union leader, described the alleged revelations about the role of politicians as a shame. 

 RLD chief Ajit Singh has refused to comment.

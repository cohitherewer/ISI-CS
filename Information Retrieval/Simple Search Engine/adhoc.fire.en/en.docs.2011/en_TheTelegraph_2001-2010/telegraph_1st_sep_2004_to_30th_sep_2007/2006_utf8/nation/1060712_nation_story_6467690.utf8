 Samaritan spirit alive and well

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Mumbai, July 11: At first glance, the crowd tumbling out of Mahim railway station onto the adjacent arterial Tulsi-Pipe road minutes after the blast did not look very different from the usual rush hour scene at 6.45 pm.

 Men and women were running amok and diving into the thoroughfare blind to the speeding traffic ? only today they were not looking for share taxis and auto-rickshaws. The panic-stricken faces and blood-drenched figures were too numbed to even call out for help.

 Bomb blast? bomb blast was all the man in his 50s could scream, when stopped, before he jerked and ran away.

 Men and women stood bawling while children looked on. The lone beat constable and a few railway policemen ran around swinging their batons and whisking away people, as confused as those they were meant to shield.

 Ten minutes later, the television OB (outside broadcast vans) had arrived, but there was no sign of fire engines or ambulances.

 Local residents were putting the injured into every available vehicle in sight and rushing them off to the S.L. Raheja hospital 4 km away.

 It was like bundling of sacks of vegetables as soon as they had been unloaded by long-distance trucks, said Hanif Raza, a vegetable vendor from the nearby Dadar wholesale market.

 But for the vegetable vendors and local youth, it would have been impossible to manage the situation till police forces and ambulances arrived, said Sachin Wagle, a traffic beat constable.

 Till past midnight hundreds of residents of Mahim ? the Muslim-dominated area where the Mumbai city limit ends and the suburbs begin ? were out offering tea, water and biscuits to people stranded on the streets. Some were distributing pulao.

 Most of those who rushed to help live in the slums that line the railway track that runs through Mahim, Matunga and Dadar, their shanties separating it from the busy Tulsi-Pipe Road that leads to the posh malls of Lower Parel. The government had decided last year to raze their homes.

 There are people lying sprawled on the railway track outside my shanty, said Ashish Kumar, one of them. While the first police force to arrive got busy shooing media-persons, Ashish and his friends used bedsheets to carry the injured lying on the tracks.

 They picked up a profusely bleeding middle-aged man whose hand and part of the face were badly burnt. As they ran across the road to catch a taxi, two policemen came brandishing their baton.

 What are you doing, get out of here, said one and landed his stick on one of Ashishs friends. The locals ran away leaving the unconscious man on the sidewalk. It was a good 20 minutes before he was put into an ambulance.

 Inside the station, the train stood with its roof ripped and a wall destroyed. A thick smoke engulfed the nearly-empty platform.

 Sharon DSouza who was to get off at Bandra, the next station, was standing close to the gate of the second class ladies compartment when she heard the blast. It was as if lightning had struck. The whole train shook so hard and the noise was ear-splitting. I was pushed out of the coach and some people walked over my hand when I fell down. I am lucky, I escaped with some bruises. I am not going to any hospital, I am headed home.

 CPM fights Chinas battle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Prakash Karat 

 may not admire Beijings labour policies, but when 

 Delhi brands the Chinese a security threat he puts his foot 

 down.

 The CPM leadership is preparing to put the Centre in the dock for denying permission to several Chinese companies to start ventures in India.

 Many Chinese firms have had their tenders rejected on grounds of security. The Centre has stalled the development of a Kerala port because one of the Chinese companies that won the bid is also building a strategic Pakistani naval base.

 We want to know how the Chinese are posing a threat to Indias security, a Left leader said. Its ridiculous if they are rejecting a tender from a Chinese company simply because the company worked on a project in Pakistan.

 The CPMs central leadership is readying a note on the subject. It will be handed to the United Progressive Alliance leadership at a meeting at the end of this month.

 Sources said the Chinese ambassador in India had last month got in touch with Karat, the CPM general secretary, to complain at the way his countrys companies were being blocked on security grounds.

 CPM Rajya Sabha member Tapan Sen had raised the subject at the previous session of Parliament. He had wanted to know why the Centre had rejected a tender floated by M/s CIMC, a Chinese company, to build passenger-boarding bridges.

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had said the company was kept out for security reasons on advice from the home and foreign ministries.

 The CPM has always been touchy about China, whether on liberalisation or foreign policy.

 The party had a few years ago attacked the National Democratic Alliances defence minister, George Fernandes, for describing Beijing as Delhis enemy number one.

 The CPM is worried that the Manmohan Singh government, surviving on the Lefts outside support, could be veering to a view similar to Fernandess.

 The Left has been an uncompromising critic of the governments foreign policy, which it believes is being directed by Washington.

 This was one of the Lefts main grouses against the A.B. Vajpayee regime, too, apart from the issue of communalism. Senior Left leaders feel that the Manmohan government hasnt made a clean break with its predecessors foreign policy.

 The CPM central committee, which will hold its three-day meeting in Delhi next week, will discuss the issue of China. The subject had figured also on the agenda of the Left Front meeting earlier this month.

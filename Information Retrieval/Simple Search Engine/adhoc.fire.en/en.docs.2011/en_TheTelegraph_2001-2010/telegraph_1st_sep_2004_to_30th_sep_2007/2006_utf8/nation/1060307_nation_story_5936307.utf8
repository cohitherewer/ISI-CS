 Congress shuts up wagging tongues

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 6: The Congress welcomed the Prime Ministers statement on Iran in Parliament today, during which he said the government would not support regime changes in friendly countries like the West Asian nation.

 Manmohan Singhs statement emphasised and reiterated the independent nature of Indias foreign policy, the Congress said.

 For any doubting Thomases, who saw a shift or slant in our long, historic and comprehensive relations in different parts of the world, this reiteration must set to rest all doubts, party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters.

 In the context of the Iran nuclear issue, India had freely and frankly declared it wanted peace and stability in the region and would work with like-minded countries such as Russia to ensure an honourable settlement, Singhvi added.

 He said that while India would ensure that Iran honoured all its international commitments, Delhi would also see to it that regional peace wasnt threatened.

 Singhvi denied the BJPs charge that India had yielded too much in its nuclear deal with the US, and cited how in other parts of the world, including the US, the perception was that India had got too much for too little.

 The BJP, he said, used its old technique of disinformation to create uncertainty (over the deal) by making too many queries.

 All the questions raised by the BJP have been contradicted by its own statement (made by Jaswant Singh on Sunday). It does not know whether to run with the hare and hunt with the hound or do both, said Singhvi.

 The Congress was waiting anxiously for the outcome of the IAEA board meeting, hoping that Russia would be able to persuade Iran to accept its formula.

 If that happened, sources said, Singh could delink the nuclear deal from the Iran vote. He could argue the Centre had pursued the first in enlightened national interest and on the second, it had followed an independent approach, working more closely with Russia than the US.

 Cyclone? Be 4-warned

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 21: A year from now, the Centre will be able to warn states 96 hours before a cyclone strikes, pinpointing the coastal stretch to be affected and roughly predicting the windspeed.

 Currently, Indian scientists can issue a warning at best 48 hours ahead of a cyclone, but its rather imprecise about the time, place and strength.

 The early warnings will be part of a Rs 1,575-crore National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project the government hopes to put in place next year for the benefit of nine cyclone-prone states, including Bengal, and four Union territories.

 The project, with the Centre bearing three-fourths of the cost, will involve building cyclone shelters and dykes, planting a wall of shrubs and mangroves along the coasts, preserving and regenerating existing mangrove forests, and repairing roads, culverts and bridges.

 It will also allow the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) to upgrade its cyclone tracking and warning system.

 The IMD has been asked to develop a new model on the lines of Japan and the US which can predict a cyclone, with the exact time and place, 96 hours before it strikes so that people can be evacuated quickly, the official said.

 To get the funds, Delhi has tapped the Finance Commission, United Nations Development Programme, World Bank and European Union.

 The Union home ministry, the nodal agency for national disaster management, will implement the project along the coastline in Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, the Andamans, Daman and Diu, Pondicherry and Lakshadweep.

 Right now studies are being done on the vulnerability of places along the coasts in these states and Union territories with the help of the IITs and the IMD, the official said.

 All the parameters, like wind and storm surge, sea profile and geometry, are being mapped to find out what kind of investment will be needed. The project is likely to be ready for implementation in less than a year.

 The ministry has asked the states and Union territories to draw up proposals to suit their local needs.

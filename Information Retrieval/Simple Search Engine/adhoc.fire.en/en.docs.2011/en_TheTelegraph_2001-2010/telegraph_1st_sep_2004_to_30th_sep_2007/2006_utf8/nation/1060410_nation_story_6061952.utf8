 Jaya faces Kanchi backlash

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Jayendra Saraswati, Jayalalithaa

 Chennai, April 9: Brahmin devotees of Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswati have vowed to vote against the ADMK in the Assembly elections in a backlash that could benefit Jayalalithaas rival M. Karunanidhi.

 Brahmins comprise less than 3 per cent of the electorate in Tamil Nadu but a chunk of their votes might move to the DMK led by Karunanidhi.

 The 82-year-old DMK patriarch also heads the Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA) ? which comprises the Congress, PMK and the Left ? in Tamil Nadu.

 The change in the upper castes attitude towards the DMK, which has ideologically fought Brahminism, has been brought about by the Jayalalithaa regimes unthinkable humiliation meted out to the Kanchi pontiff, the main accused in the murder of a temple official.

 Although the issue cut no ice during the Kancheepuram Assembly by-election last year, the seers devotees are determined to defeat the chief minister, said Valasai Jayaraman, the general secretary of the Kanchi Kamakoti Bakthargal Peravai (devotees forum). We are 100 per cent against Jayalalithaa this time, Jayaraman said.

 On Tuesday, the 72-year-old acharya was tired as he drove down to Chennai to appear in court in the Radhakrishnan assault case, or else there was an arrest warrant waiting for him, added Jayaraman, regretting that a pontiff of a venerated institution had to suffer like this.

 He said a major section of the Brahmins and mutt devotees had resolved teach her (Jayalalithaa) a lesson for the indignity heaped on the mutt and did not wish to waste their votes in the Assembly polls.

 While sections in the Kanchi Mutt alleged that the BJP did not espouse the acharyas case after making initial noises, a senior party leader, Ela Ganesan, denied this. 

 I am in constant touch with Kanchi Mutt devotees and several have said they would work for us, Ganesan said after the BJPs first list of 139 candidates was announced.

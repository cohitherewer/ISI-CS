 Ripples 

in Pak over PM remark

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, July 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs reference to the role of Pakistan-based elements in the Mumbai blasts has alarmed Islamabad and analysts who fear such accusations might derail the peace process.

 Singh had said on Friday that those behind the Mumbai attacks had been supported by elements across the border.

 The peace process will be derailed for the time being, it looks like, leading analyst Syed Hassan Askari told The Telegraph from Lahore.

 Askari, however, believes India will have to resume talks with Pakistan sooner or later. 

 The American and the European corporate sector ? both financial services and industrial groups ? have poured in massive capital in India and they would not like to operate in an atmosphere of uncertainty, Askari said.

 He also said there would be tremendous pressure on Pakistan, more so on General Pervez Musharraf from the United States and other major powers, who would like him to fulfil his commitments on dealing with extremists and terror groups.

 The known Pashtoon nationalist and chief of the Pakistani chapter of Pakistan-India Peoples Forum for Peace and Democracy, Afrasiyab Khattak, sounded equally concerned over the latest developments, saying they might jeopardise the composite dialogue.

 This will be a big tragedy if terrorist elements succeed in subverting the ongoing peace process, Khattak said. There are many of them on both sides who do not want the two nations to be at peace with each other.

 For Khattak, the Mumbai terror attack has shrunk the space for the peace process but he urged both governments not to allow enemies of peace to succeed in their designs. The two governments must show maturity at this critical stage to save the talks and the confidence-building process, he stressed.

 Singh told a news conference in New Delhi on Friday that Pakistan needed to curb terrorism if it wanted the peace process to make progress.

 The statements from New Delhi also seemed to have put Islamabad on the defensive, with most officials declining to comment on them. 

 Foreign office spokesperson Tasneem Aslam refused to go on record on the foreign secretaries talks that were to be held next week, saying she could not take a position until New Delhi conveyed its stand formally. Delhi has said the talks will not be held now, but not announced fresh dates.

 The foreign office here has already called for continuation of the peace process.

 Ramanis Phuket flight grounded

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: Delhi High Court today turned down socialite Bina Ramanis plea challenging the issuing of lookout notices against her in the Jessica Lal murder. 

 The courts refusal to quash the notice or grant even an interim stay means Bina cannot leave the country to attend her nieces wedding in Phuket, Thailand. She had sought permission to leave the country for 14 days, beginning March 25, for this. 

 Delhi police had issued the notices after filing a fresh FIR against unnamed persons two weeks ago to probe allegations of fabrication, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy between the accused and the police. 

 Bina and her daughter Malini, both witnesses in the case, had earlier been charged with destroying evidence at the murder site in Tamarind Court, a restaurant they own. They had allegedly washed off bloodstains from the spot. 

 The lookout notices were issued against the accused and the witnesses. 

 Regarding Binas plea, Justice Vikramjit Sen said as the investigation into the allegations of evidence tampering was at a crucial stage, Binas plea could not be considered at this stage. 

 He also pointed out that as she held a British passport, it was not possible to grant her plea.

 Delhi police counsel Mukta Gupta opposed Binas plea, saying her presence was essential for the investigations as the matter related to destruction of evidence. 

 Binas counsel Viraj Datar countered, saying the lookout notices were arbitrary and illegal as his client was a witness and not an accused in the case. 

 Any move to restrain her from leaving the country without reason or justification was violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. 

 He argued that Bina could be restrained only if there was an apprehension that she may abscond. 

 The socialite also offered a bank guarantee as security for her presence in the country after her Thailand trip, but the court did not find much merit in the argument. 

 The court has posted the matter for hearing on April 5. Delhi police have been directed to file their reply on the matter in a week and Bina has been told to file her rejoinder two days later. 

 Earlier in the week, Bina and Malini had approached Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul seeking the scrapping of the lookout notices against them. Paul, however, did not offer any assurance and said the notices were a precaution.

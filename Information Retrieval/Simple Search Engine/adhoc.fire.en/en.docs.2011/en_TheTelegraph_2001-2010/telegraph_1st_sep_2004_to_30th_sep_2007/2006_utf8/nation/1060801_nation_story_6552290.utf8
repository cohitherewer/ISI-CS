 Saudi cash trail to blasts

 - Cops seize riyals from train strike suspect

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 31: Stumbling on a cache of hawala money from Saudi Arabia, investigators are probing whether it funded the Mumbai train blasts.

 The chief of the anti-terrorist squad, K.P. Raghuvanshi, today said the investigators have seized 37,000 Saudi riyals (around Rs 4 lakh) sent in two instalments to suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operative Faisal Sheikh, one of the 10 arrested in the blast case so far.

 The money was sent days before and immediately after the seven explosions. We found 25,000 Saudi riyals last week in Mumbai. We seized 12,000 riyals from Pune. It was sent by Faisals brother based in Saudi Arabia, Raghuvanshi said.

 The squad had arrested Faisal, 30, and his software programmer brother Muzzamil, 22, from Mumbai and Bangalore on July 27 in connection with the bombings. 

 Police sources said Faisal was a key Lashkar operative in charge of the western region, and handled the financial aspect of the conspiracy.

 Sources said Faisal headed a Lashkar module that included a Mumbai-based unani medical practitioner, Tanvir Ahmed Ansari, his brother Muzzamil, key-maker Zameer Sheikh and Pune-based Sohail Sheikh ? all of whom had travelled to Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for arms training in different years.

 The police claimed that after Faisals interrogation, a link with the Aurangabad arms haul and Delhi serial blasts of October 2005 had emerged. 

 Faisal had assigned Fayaz Kagzi, one of the three absconding in the arms haul case, to carry out an RDX-triggered explosion aboard Mumbai-Ahmedabad Karnavati Express on February 19.

 The investigators believe that Kagzi, and the other two operatives, Zahibuddin Ansari and Raheel Sheikh, had fled to Pakistan.

 Raghuvanshi said the crime branch and ATS teams had fanned out across the country to chase various leads.

 The squad has launched a crackdown on members of the banned Students of Islamic Movement of India, which is suspected to have provided logistical support to Lashkar operatives in carrying out the Mumbai blasts.

 On Saturday, the police arrested Ehtesham Siddiqui from Naya Nagar in Mira Road and seized literature related to jihad.

 Today, they arrested Danish Riyaz Sheikh, 28, a Mira Road-based journalist working with Urdu Times, and seized Simi and jihadi literature. 

 Both were held under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and remanded in police custody.

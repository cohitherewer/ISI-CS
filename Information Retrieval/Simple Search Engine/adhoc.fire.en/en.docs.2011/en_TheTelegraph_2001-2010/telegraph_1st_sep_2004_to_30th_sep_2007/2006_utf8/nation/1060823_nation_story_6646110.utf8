 TRS sticks to deadline, walks out

 Rao: Quit punch

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: Telengana Rashtra Samiti ministers K. Chandrasekhar Rao and A. Narendra today walked out of the Manmohan Singh government after failing to wangle any assurance on statehood for Telengana.

 We will withdraw support to the UPA. Definitely. Once you are out of the government, you are out of the UPA, TRS chief Rao told reporters.

 The Congress has cheated the people of Telengana. At the time of elections, it promised a separate state but even after two years it has done nothing in that direction.

 Rao said he would write to the President, withdrawing support to the UPA. With only five MPs, the walkout is not likely to make any difference to the UPA as it enjoys the support of 330 MPs in the 545-member House.

 But it is a political setback for the Congress-led coalition all the same because this is the first time an ally has pulled out on a political issue.

 The TRS leaders also stayed away from a dinner thrown by the Prime Minister for UPA leaders and MPs as Parliaments monsoon session is drawing to a close.

 Rao said he would begin an indefinite hunger strike at Jantar Mantar in the capital tomorrow and launch an agitation in Andhra Pradesh to press for a separate Telengana state.

 The TRS had fought the parliamentary and Assembly elections in 2004 in alliance with the Congress on the promise that it would be granted a separate state. Since then, the parties have been in an uneasy relationship.

 The TRSs decision to quit came after a series of meetings with UPA constituents and Left parties through the day. 

 This morning, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Prime Minister and leaders of constituents like the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Nationalist Congress Party and the DMK had appealed to Rao not to take any hasty decision.

 Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who had been interacting with Rao over the issue, also tried to persuade him not to resign.

 In the afternoon, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who heads a UPA subcommittee on Telengana, met him along with Left leaders. 

 Although the Left parties made their opposition to the TRS demand clear, they appealed to Rao not to take any decision in haste.

 Last week, Rao had set today as the deadline to resign from the government.

 In Andhra Pradesh, too, the TRS has an uneasy relationship with the Congress. 

 The party withdrew its support to the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government within a few months of its coming to power on the Telengana issue.

 Gujarat showcause to Aamir 

 - Filming of chinkara for 

Lagaan dug out 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 8: Actor Aamir Khan, who has earned the wrath of the Narendra Modi government with his statements against the riots and the Narmada dam, has been served a showcause notice by Gujarats forest department.

 The action has been initiated under the Wildlife Protection Act for filming the endangered chinkaras (antelopes) during the making of Laagan eight years ago.

 Aamir (in picture) has 

 been given a week to explain why he filmed the chinkara 

 in Kutch even after being denied permission following a 

 petition by a wildlife enthusiast, Amit Jethwa. 

 A preliminary probe has revealed the films producers did not take permission from the forest department, an official said.

 During the probe, a forest guard said he had taken the production team to the spot but was not aware how and what they filmed.

 If we do not find his reply satisfactory, proceedings under the Wildlife Act will be initiated against the film star, said deputy conservator of forests (Kutch) V.T. Korwadia.

 If found guilty, Aamir faces imprisonment ranging from a year to six years. 

 Jethwa, who had earlier complained against Salman Khan for killing a chinkara, has alleged that the animal was injured during Laagans filming.

 If the filming was done in connection with a documentary or wildlife film, it would not have mattered. But since the film and the footage of the chinkara was made and used for commercial purposes, it is illegal, the official said.

 According to forest department officials, Aamirs former wife Reena, who was the executive producer of Lagaan, and his second wife Kiran Rao, who was the assistant director, were present in Kutch during the shoot.

 Lagaan was produced by Aamir and directed by Ashutosh Gowarikar.

 The film, shot in Jam Kunaria village, about 375 km from Ahmedabad in the semi-arid environs of Kutch district, was released on June 1, 2001. It was nominated in the best foreign language film category at the Academy Awards.

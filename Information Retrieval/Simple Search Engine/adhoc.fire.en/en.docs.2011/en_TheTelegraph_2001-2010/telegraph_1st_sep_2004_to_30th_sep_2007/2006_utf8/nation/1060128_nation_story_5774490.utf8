 New Delhi, Jan. 27: The Left believes the UPA government is floundering and fast losing its credibility.

 At a meeting today, leaders of four Left parties discussed if they should urge Sonia Gandhi ? the fulcrum of power in the Congress-led UPA ? to intervene in what seems to be turning into a messy political situation.

 The Centres pro-US stance and the decision to introduce FDI in retail remain thorny issues in UPA-Left relations. 

 We will approach retail traders to organise protests and strikes against the decision, said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. The Congress resolutions passed at the recent Hyderabad conclave did not mention a word about FDI in retail.

 However, unlike in the past, the focus of todays meeting was the governments flawed political management and not just the UPA-Left conflict.

 Bardhan and his CPM counterpart Prakash Karat said the government had been drifting in and out of political storms and this was hurting its image. The latest in this series were the Bofors revelations and the Karnataka crisis. 

 The Left believes the Congress precipitated the Karnataka problem because it wanted to govern alone instead of sharing power with the Janata Dal (Secular). The Congress tried to engineer defections from the Janata Dal (S), a party which was supporting it, a Left leader said.

 On the Left report card, Manmohan Singh has not scored too well as a political strategist. The Left parties feel he is a gentleman but lacks the political skills a Prime Minister should possess. 

 The UPAs political fortunes have recently dipped in Bihar and Karnataka and the Left is worried they may plunge further after Assembly elections in Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. 

 The government lacks coordination with allies. It suddenly withdrew food subsidy and then kept the decision on hold following protests, said a Left leader. A government cannot function like this.

 The CPM and CPI have expressed dissatisfaction over the way the government handled the Bofors controversy following law minister H.R. Bhardwajs instruction to defreeze the London bank accounts of Ottavio Quattrocchi. 

 The Left does not stand to lose from this erosion in the governments credibility. But the Congress will slide unless it pulls itself up, warned a Left leader.

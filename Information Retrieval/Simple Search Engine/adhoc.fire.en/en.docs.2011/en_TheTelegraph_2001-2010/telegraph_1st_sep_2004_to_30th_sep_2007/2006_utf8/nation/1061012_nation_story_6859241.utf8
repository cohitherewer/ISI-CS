 Moral cops on the prowl in parks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Not in nagpur, please 

 Mumbai, Oct. 11: If you want to know what indecent behaviour means, Nagpur police are ready with an example: a woman sitting on a mans lap in a public park.

 In a drive launched yesterday, the lawkeepers rounded up 54 young couples, mostly college students, from Nagpurs parks.

 These boys and girls were found indulging in objectionable acts in a city garden, embarrassing other law-abiding citizens visiting with their families, particularly children, Nagpur additional commissioner of police (crime) Bhushan Upadhyaya said.

 Mumbais youth were seething today at the moral policing, asking whether the force did not have better things to do in a state wracked by crime and terror attacks.

 If we are old enough to vote, drive, marry and donate blood, we can choose when, how, where and with whom we want to hang out. The police should busy themselves with greater evils. And who judges morality anyway? said 24-year-old Priyanka Aich, a content development specialist with a software company.

 Journalist Kavita Shyam, 23, put the police action down to attitudes fostered by the Shiv Sena, which had ruled the state for years.

 Be it Mumbai, Pune or Delhi, on Valentines Day the Shiv Sainiks and the cops crack down on young couples. Its just the polices way of making a few quick bucks it has nothing to do with morality, she said.

 The detained boys and girls were given a dose of morality, the police said, and freed after their names and addresses were taken down. Couples at a park in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, had not been so lucky last December.

 In the drive at Meeruts Gandhi Bagh, the police had slapped young men and women, including married couples, after forcing them to turn their faces towards the cameras of TV channels they had invited beforehand.

 Upadhyaya said: We plan to conduct the drive two to three times a week, or more if required, to stop this nuisance. There is no restriction on visiting or sitting in the garden in a proper way, but if someone is found sitting on someones lap, we will take action.

 Amitabh Sridharan, a social worker in Mumbai, felt it is the police rather than the youth who need a dose of sensitisation.

 This kind of drive is unacceptable. The best way to deal with situations like this is to sensitise the police fraternity, educate social workers and spread public awareness. In an evolving society, these things (couples getting cosy) will happen. We cannot define morality and lay down laws; what we can do is create space, such as a park for adults, he said.

 The Meerut drive had led to four police personnel, including the additional superintendent (city), being suspended.

 An Uttar Pradesh home department official had said: Theres a streak of perversion among some officers that prompts the police to do this sort of thing.

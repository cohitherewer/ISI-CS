 Cong cloud thickens

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 7: The Congress has virtually abandoned the battle for Uttar Pradesh even before it has started.

 The BJP smelt more than a slim prospect of revival.

 The Samajwadi Party hopes to regroup its Muslim votes.

 And the Bahujan Samaj Party, which heads the popularity sweepstakes in the run-up to next years elections, kept its cards close to the chest.

 The Varanasi blasts ? the third major incident with communal overtones in the state after last weeks Lucknow riots and the Mau violence last year ? could help crystallise the trends, say sources across the political spectrum.

 State Congress sources blamed the party-led central coalition for its inept handling of the Indo-US nuclear deal, the controversy over the Prophet Mohammad cartoons and the Iran vote.

 They said it was time the Prime Minister woke up and initiated some damage control as the three issues have got inextricably linked with the persona of George W. Bush who, to Muslims across the world, is a hate object.

 The Centre can try and sell the nuke deal as the best thing that happened in the energy sector, but it will not cut ice with Muslims. We have to come out (with a) decisive (stand) on Iran and the cartoons so that India is not perceived as a lackey of the US, said a source.

 For the moment, the Congress has abandoned its plans to bring Rahul Gandhi onto the Uttar Pradesh centre stage ? at least not until it has worked out its responses.

 For the BJP, the blasts are the latest in a slew of electorally potential issues like the fact-finding committee on the status of Muslims and the report on the Godhra train fire. Party chief Rajnath Singh alleged the blasts were a fallout of the Centres minority-appeasement policies.

 The party, which had just 4 per cent votes in the recent state bypolls (1 per cent more than the Congress), sees in the ambience a chance to project itself as the only guardian of Hindu interests.

 To the Samajwadi Party, the ideal situation, sources said, would be one where it is pitted directly against the BJP so that its Muslim-Yadav combination stays intact and it could take on the BSP from a position of strength.

 Cruise in the backwaters in composite boat

 New Delhi, July 23: In the picturesque backwaters of Kerala where time, salt water and marine organisms have ceaselessly ravaged traditional houseboats, technology is about to preserve a tourist charm ? and a way of life.

 A new class of composite boats made of glass fibre and polyester are all set to emerge as an alternative to the traditional wooden rice boats converted into tourist houseboats for day and night cruises in the backwaters.

 A joint technology project between the IITs in Mumbai and Chennai and a ship builder in Kochi has spawned a composite houseboat. The first boat will be thrown open to tourists in Kochi next month, but scientists and the ship building company officials said it could be exploited for water tourism across India ? from Goa to the Sunderbans.

 The governments technology information forecasting and assessment council, an agency that tracks technology trends and supports research efforts, coordinated the project as part of an advanced composite mission.

 A composite houseboat was inevitable, said V. Anantha Subramanian, professor of naval architecture at the department of ocean engineering at IIT Chennai, where engineers designed the hull, the steering system and other features of the craft. Wood for traditional houseboats has become scarce and wood craftsmen have dwindled, he said. Composites also require very little maintenance.

 For decades, traditional rice boats were used to ferry rice from paddy fields to villages along Keralas backwaters. But sometime in the late-80s, entrepreneurs began to turn these rice boats into houseboats and to rent them out to tourists.

 This business picked up very well, said Sudhakar Jeevan, managing director of Samdura Shipyard, the Kochi-based company building the composite houseboats. Tourists pay Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000 for a day on a boat.

 Its only the exterior wood and the thatched roof that is traditional in the houseboats, said Jeevan. Inside, you find air conditioning, music systems, television ? all the luxuries of a hotel.

 All of that will be available on the composite houseboats too. Weve tried to reconcile modern materials with traditional aesthetics, said Kishore Munshi, professor at the industrial design centre in IIT Mumbai.

 Weve retained certain curves in the shape of the roof. We want these new boats to gel with the environment, Munshi said. The IIT Mumbai team also designed its interiors, providing an extra-wide window in the bedroom for a panoramic view, better moving space inside the craft, and a kitchen factoring in ergonomics. A modular design makes it possible to build a one-bedroom or a two-bedroom boat.

 Jeevan said the company already has orders for three boats from the Maharashtra government. Such houseboats could be used in selected sites along the coasts of Goa, Maharashtra, even in the Sunderbans, he said.

 Ship builders believe that economics will drive owners of traditional boats to composites. In salt water, wood is susceptible to attack by barnacles and other marine organisms. This demands periodic repairs at a time when the jackwood price has gone up. With composite materials, the hull and superstructure are expected to remain maintenance-free for many years, Jeevan said.

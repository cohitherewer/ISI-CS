 Freedom for Modi mailer

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Omar Siddiqui, the Delhi School of Economics graduate arrested for sending an abusive and threat email to Narendra Modi, was freed on Wednesday, his advocate said.

 Omar has been freed and has gone back to Delhi after the Gandhinagar sessions court approved of the pardon granted by the (Gujarat) chief minister. There is no case against him anymore, advocate M.I. Laliwala said.

 He said the public prosecutor had produced the required papers before the court on Tuesday.

 A human resources manager at a Delhi-based outsourcing firm, Omar was pardoned by Modi on January 29 on compassionate grounds after he reportedly admitted that he had sent the email without thinking.

 He was arrested by a team of anti-terrorist squad sleuths of Gujarat police on January 27 from his house.

 HC orders fresh Jama report

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 warned that it would initiate action against the deputy 

 commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) 

 if his status report on clearing encroachment in and around 

 the Jama Masjid was misleading and false.

 The court on Wednesday directed a fresh joint inspection by officials of the MCD, the Delhi Development Authority and police, along with advocate Usha Kumar, and asked them to file a report during its next hearing.

 Kumar, the counsel for the Heritage and Culture Forum, said she had visited the site on Tuesday and found the encroachments intact.

 Education nod

 New Delhi (PTI): President A.P.J. Abdul 

 Kalam has approved a bill allowing SC, ST and OBC students 

 greater access to higher education in unaided higher education 

 institutions.

 It aims to help them gain greater access to these institutions other than minority establishments, an official release said.

 Contempt notices

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 issued contempt notices to Delhi municipalitys additional 

 commissioner (slum wing) R.M. Pillai to appear before it 

 for failing to clear a slum off Bharat Marg. Dwellers were 

 allegedly relocated there by the corporation while rehabilitating 

 them.

 Sania respite

 Lucknow (PTI): The All India Muslim 

 Personal Law Board has said the question of Sania Mirzas 

 on-court attire does not come under its purview. Every 

 sport has its specific dress code, its general secretary 

 Maulana Nizamuddin said.

 Uttar 

 Pradeshs Etawah district, home to chief minister Mulayam 

 Singh Yadav, would soon feature a lion safari in the 150-hectare 

 Fischer forest.

 Near riots after mosque hoax call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal, Aug. 27: A mischievous complaint to police about terrorists hiding in a mosque with a huge cache of explosives today almost triggered riots in Bhopal.

 Majid Hussain, whose house shares a boundary wall with Kilol Park mosque that is half a km from the chief ministers residence, made the complaint. He is reported to have had some property dispute with mosque authorities.

 The tip-off ultimately turned out to be a hoax but as word of a raid on the mosque spread, hundreds of Muslims spilled out into the streets and got into pitched fights with the police.

 The target of their wrath changed when they subsequently got to know Hussain had pulled a fast one and there were no terrorists holed up in the mosque.

 Huge groups then descended on Hussains home with the intention of burning it down. The police had a tough time reining them in from harming Hussains family and property and damaging a temple and a dargah in the vicinity.

 The police were forced to fire several rounds in the air and burst tear gas shells to disperse the mob.

 But Hussain was nowhere to be seen. He is now believed to be on the run.

 Bhopal inspector-general Sanjeev Singh said the situation was under control. Now that the chaos and confusion have cleared, we are investigating what triggered this incident. But there is no terrorist involvement, he said.

 Police chief A.K. Singh said he was contemplating action against Hussain for giving false information.

 Bhopal is one of the most communally sensitive cities in India with a bloody and bitter past of communal violence.

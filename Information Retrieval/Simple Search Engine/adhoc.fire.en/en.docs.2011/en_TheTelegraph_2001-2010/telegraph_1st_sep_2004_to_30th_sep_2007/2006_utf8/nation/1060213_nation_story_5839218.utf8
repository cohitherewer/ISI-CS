 Sharma off with a flight

 Anand Sharma: Over-active

 New Delhi, Feb. 12: The new junior foreign minister, Anand Sharma, has got off to a flying start.

 Two days after he was sworn in, the minister was on a flight to Brasilia to attend an India-Brazil joint commission.

 Soon after returning from the three-day Latin American sojourn, he invited all African envoys based in Delhi for lunch.

 For the African diplomats, the interaction came as a pleasant surprise as it took place when the Indian foreign office was preoccupied with larger issues like the nuclear deal with the US, the Iran vote at the International Atomic Energy Agency and the political fallout of US ambassador David Mulfords statement.

 Officials in the external affairs ministry are not used to an over-active junior foreign minister. They said in the last decade or so the state ministers have maintained a low profile and operated in the shadow of their senior colleagues.

 With Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself keeping charge of the external affairs portfolio, the scope of the junior minister has become even more limited. 

 The key foreign policy areas like Pakistan, the US, China, Russia and Europe are out of bounds for the junior ministers.

 According to the work distribution, Sharma will handle Africa and Latin America while his colleague E. Ahameds main area of interest remains West Asia. 

 But Sharma, who has been a Congress spokesperson, is being seen as an influential minister in South Block. His predecessor Rao Inderjit Singh was a non-starter.

 Officials said Sharma was moved into South Block so that he could fill in the protocol requirements. Several international conferences and meetings demand the presence of a foreign minister. Sharma is expected to represent the nation at such international fora.

 As of now, Sharma is busy striking a rapport with the diplomatic enclave. He has sent out invites to Latin American diplomats.

 The African diplomats, who often complain about India ignoring the subcontinent, liked the proactive engagement with the new minister.

 Ministerial visits from India to the continent have dried up in the last few years. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam recently talked about establishing a pan African e-network.

 Manager kills herself

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, May 30: A young manager jumped to her death from an upscale building in Gurgaon last night, prompting police to investigate whether problems related to an affair at the workplace drove her to the extreme step.

 The 28-year-old Gagandeep Kaur was rushed from her DLF Phase II residence to hospital where she succumbed to her injuries this morning.

 Gagandeep, a manager at a well-known two-wheeler company, had made 40 phone calls and sent seven SMSes to a number belonging to a colleague, Jaspreet Joshi, before jumping from the second floor. Jaspreet has been arrested and is being questioned.

 According to police, Gagandeep was having an affair with Jaspreet who was married.

 Both were working in the same company. But her uncle has said Gagandeeps relationship with Jaspreet was not liked by her mother. We have questioned three other girls sharing the apartment with Gagandeep and have discovered that she had a tiff with Jaspreet on Sunday, a police officer connected with the investigation said.

 Investigations have revealed that Jaspreet had refused to see Gagandeep on Monday despite the 40 phone calls and seven messages. 

 We are told she had become depressed when Jaspreet refused to see her, the officer said.

 Jaspreet has denied having a hand in Gagandeeps death. It is true she wanted to see me but I was with my wife and children. I do not know who drove her to death. I have no hand in her death, he told the police.

 This is the second instance of a woman falling to her death in Gurgaon in the last two months.

 On April 15, 22-year-old Sonis Javed fell to her death from the third floor of a mall after being pushed by her employer, Ashok Rajput, over an argument concerning money.

 Monkey rap on civic body 

 New Delhi, Jan. 17 (PTI): Delhi High Court today told the city corporation to either tackle the simian trouble on the Tis Hazari court premises or close down its institution.

 If you cannot catch monkeys, then better close down your institution, a division bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Rekha Sharma said in response to a public interest litigation filed by advocate Nirmal Chopra.

 The court gave the Municipal Corporation of Delhi four weeks to free the complex of monkeys.

 The petitioner had complained that the monkeys attacked lawyers, their clients and court staff and even snatched food items. Although representations were made to the corporation and the Delhi government, no action had been taken, he said.

 However, the corporations counsel said catching monkeys was no longer its duty. He pointed out that a monkey-catcher employed by the corporation was so badly mauled that he required 72 stitches. Other monkey-catchers were unwilling to take up the task, he added.

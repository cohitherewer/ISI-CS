 Students die in firing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Morigaon, 

 Nov. 18: Three persons, including two school students, 

 were killed and 17 seriously injured after police fired 

 on a mob which torched the police station at Moir-abari, 

 30 km from Morigaon town, late this afternoon. 

 Residents and students of Moirabari attacked the police station to rescue two higher secondary students, who allegedly knocked down a cyclist, from custody. 

 Sources said the crowd pelted stones at the police station and tried to set the main office ablaze, forcing the police to open fire. This set off a stampede.

 The Morigaon unit of the All Assam Students Union has called a 12-hour bandh on Monday. Morigaon deputy commissioner Sabbir Hussain said proceedings have been initiated against Moir-abari officer in charge S. Medhi. It will be decided tomorrow whether he will be suspended or not. 

 Morigaon deputy superintendent of police S.N. Patawari said the casualties could rise as some villagers, including a few employees of the police station, are untraced. 

 A fire engine was damaged and firemen assaulted. Curfew was imposed this evening after Section 144 failed to improve the situation. 

 The victims are Hipjur Rahman, a 13-year-old student of Moirabari High Mad-arsa, Rekibul Islam, a Class II student of Moirabari Mar-kaj Academy and Amirul Hoque, a 30-year-old barber. Eight persons, mostly students, sustained bullet injuries. 

 Additional deputy commissioner P.B. Nath will probe the incident. The report will be submitted within 48 hours, Hussain said. 

 Food and civil supplies minister Nazrul Islam and forest minister Rockybul Hussain have gone to the spot on Tarun Gogois orders.

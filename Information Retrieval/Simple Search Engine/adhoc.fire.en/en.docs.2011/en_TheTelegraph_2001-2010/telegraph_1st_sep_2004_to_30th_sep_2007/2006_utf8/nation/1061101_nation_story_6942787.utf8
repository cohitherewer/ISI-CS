 Calcutta hub on Telgi lips

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 31: Stamp paper scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi has alleged in his confession recorded before a Pune magistrate that the hub of the racket was Calcutta, and not Pune, Mumbai or Bangalore where investigations were launched.

 Telgi has stated this in a 157-page confessional statement recorded in-camera before chief judicial magistrate D.W. Modak in February.

 He named Calcutta-based Mohammed Saeed as the kingpin and said several printing presses which manufactured counterfeit stamps were located in Calcutta. Saeed, the 58th accused in the stamp paper scam, was arrested by a special investigation team on October 30, 2003. He owned a transport business.

 Denying that he ever printed fake stamps, Telgi claimed he only circulated them with the tacit support of politicians, police officials and senior bureaucrats. He promised to reveal their names in another confession he was writing at the Yeravada jail.

 However, the investigations by the state police had shown that Telgi used his contacts at the Nashik security press to purchase printing machinery auctioned by it and set up a press in Mumbai.

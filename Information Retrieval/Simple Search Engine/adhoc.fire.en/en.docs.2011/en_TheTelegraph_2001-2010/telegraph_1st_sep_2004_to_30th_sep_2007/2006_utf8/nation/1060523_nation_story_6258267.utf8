 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pranab: Troubleshooter

 New Delhi, May 22: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will be taking up one of the most important international assignments for the government when he leaves for Japan and China on Wednesday with a brief to boost confidence-building measures and also address concerns in Beijing on Indias military agreements with the US.

 Mukherjee, the UPAs chief troubleshooter, was briefed by the Cabinet Committee on Security on Friday for his five-day tour of China during which he will meet the senior-most leadership in Beijing. He is expected to reach Beijing on May 28 on the second leg of his tour.

 Mukherjee will convey to Beijing that despite the framework agreement on defence cooperation and proposed civilian nuclear deal with Washington, New Delhi was enthusiastic about broadening and deepening military exchanges with China. 

 India and China are likely to sign a memorandum of understanding to institutionalise training and exercise exchanges and other contacts between the armed forces and defence officials and experts of the two countries, an official release said here today.

 The MoU will pave the way for regular talks on defence issues. The defence minister will be given a tour of military institutions in Beijing, Lanzhou and Shanghai. In his meetings with Chinese minister of national defence General Cao Gangchuan and foreign minister Li Zhaoxing, Mukherjee will convey a commitment to the development of a strategic and cooperative partnership for peace and prosperity.

 During his stay in Japan from May 25 to 28, he will welcome participation by Japanese industry in Indias defence modernisation programme. 

 He will lead a team of senior officials of the defence and external affairs ministries, the Defence Research and Development Organisation and the armed forces.

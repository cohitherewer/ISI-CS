The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Maoists getting close to Calcutta

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Asannagar (Nadia), June 20: The Maoists struck about 100 km from Calcutta last night, proving that they were indeed spreading their tentacles beyond their known strongholds, the impoverished Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 If the government thinks we are active in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia only, it is mistaken, the outfits top leader in the state, Somen, had told The Telegraph in an interview in April.

 Among the places where he said the CPI (Maoist) was preparing mass bases and guerrilla zones was Chapra, barely a kilometre from the scene of last nights double murders.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan said: Our preliminary investigations suggest the group had come from nearby Chapra, which has a concentration of CPI (Maoist) activists. 

 The CPM leaders killed last night ? Swapan Sardar and Uttam Sardar ? were sleeping in the courtyard of Uttams house as it was sultry inside.

 Masked guerrillas in black combat uniform surrounded them around 2 am.

 Doya kore amai mero na. Aami aar CPM korbo na (Please have pity on me. I will quit the CPM), Uttam pleaded with them with folded hands. 

 When Uttams wife Saraswati tried to intervene, she was dragged away at gun-point by two guerrillas. 

 The Maoists pumped three bullets into him, which pierced his chest, a senior police officer said.

 Saraswati could still feel the cold nozzle pressing against her temples this morning. A few minutes later I heard the shots and lost consciousness, she said. 

 His son Chiranjit and widowed mother, who were sleeping inside, heard the gunshots but could not step out because a couple of rebels were guarding the door.

 No other villager ventured out either.

 As Uttams lifeless body hit the ground, Swapan started to run for his life. He jumped into an adjacent jute field and was chased by a band of rebels. 

 The guerrillas caught up with Swapan and shot him. He slumped in a pool of blood, an officer of the kotwali police station said. 

 When the district police chief reached the village, Saraswati and Swapans wife Juthika charged him with not being able to protect them. Tell us what were you doing when the Maoists asked us not to vote in the Assembly elections? they asked. 

 Rajshekharan said Uttam and Swapan had never reported to the police that they had been threatened.

 After a preliminary investigation, the police suspect that the guerrillas who killed the two tribal CPM leaders at Chandpur belonged to a CPI (Maoist) frontal organisation.

 A Nadia police officer said the 

 CPI (Maoist) peasant wing, the Mazdoor Krishak Sangram Samiti, 

 is active across the district.

 Cops zero in on Modi mailer

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 28: Gujarat police are certain the hate mail to chief minister Narendra Modi was sent by Omar Farooq Sidiqqui, 32, a senior executive working with a Delhi BPO.

 However, Omars family claims he has been framed. They are planning to move a bail petition on Monday when his case comes up before a special court in Ahmedabad. He was remanded in police custody after being taken to Gujarat late last night.

 A three-member team, led by deputy superintendent of police (anti-terrorist squad) Dinesh Parmar, from Gujarat had picked up Omar and his father Irfan Sidiqqui from their south Delhi residence on January 26 for allegedly sending an abusive and threatening email to Modi in December. They were questioned at Delhi polices special cell in Lodhi Colony. 

 Omar confessed his crime when we confronted him with foolproof evidence. There is no doubt now that it was Omar who sent the hate email to the chief minister from his personal computer, said deputy inspector general (anti-terrorist squad), Gujarat, D.G. Vanzara. 

 We have charged him under Sections 294 and 507 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, Vanzara added.

 The DIG did not reveal the contents of the email.

 Blast on Lalu route

 Lalu Prasad

 Patna, Aug. 19: A low-intensity bomb exploded near the railway track at Rajendra Nagar around 9.45 am, hours before railway minister Lalu Prasad crossed the area on the way to Bhagalpur.

 Four crude bombs were also recovered near the place, which is three km away from the Patna junction. No one was injured.

 Inspector general of police, railways, A.S. Nimhar dubbed the incident as minor and suspected it to be the handiwork of train dacoits. But the railway minister took it seriously and asked officials to tighten vigil.

 Lalu Prasad said some anti-social elements were behind the explosion. He added there was no reason to panic as it was a low-intensity blast.

 The minister did not miss the opportunity to criticise the state government. He said: One can well imagine the sorry state of the railway police in Bihar where a DIG rank official has been absconding. He was alluding to railway DIG Ajay Kumar Verma who has been evading arrest in a case of trespassing and criminal intimidation.

 Mumbai, Aug. 11: Anam and Affan wait for their father to come home for dinner. Its been a month since Aejaz Shekh died in the serial train blasts, but his children are still holding on to hope.

 They cry a lot. Though the situation is much better than before, the kids are always falling ill. Even now, both of them have fever, said their mother Shagufta.

 On July 11, around 200 people were killed and 700 injured in seven blasts that ripped through Mumbais local trains.

 In the trains, people still talk about the dark day in whispers. 

 We know that these were not the first blasts to happen in the city, and for sure these will not be the last. We have to learn to live with it, said a middle-aged housewife.

 The hushed tones are tinged with anger and the conversations often veer towards the 1993 blasts verdict. 

 So many people are still awaiting justice, how can we hope to get it within such a short span? Theres at least a decades wait ahead of us, said Nitin Dholakia, who was injured in one of the blasts.

 Payment of compensation has also run into rough weather. Even after a month, the situation is so chaotic that I cannot begin to describe it. The process of ex gratia payments is far from complete. Theres lack of commitment and theres no communication between the various departments dealing with compensation claims. The list of injured put up by the railways doesnt match that of the state, said BJP leader Kirit Somaiya.

 Many victims have been paying from their own pockets. I have boarded the train only once since the blasts. I just cant do it. I have already paid Rs 30,000 and my treatment is yet to be complete. I dont know anything about the Railway Claims Tribunal as I have been in hospital, said Keval Shah. 

 The Western Railways, however, claims to have paid Rs 50 lakh towards hospital bills.

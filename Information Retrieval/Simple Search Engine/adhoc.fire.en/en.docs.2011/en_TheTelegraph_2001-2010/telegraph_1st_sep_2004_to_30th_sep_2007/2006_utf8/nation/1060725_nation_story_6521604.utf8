 New Delhi, July 24: Jaya Bachchan was obviously the star, but it was the guest appearance by a certain tall actor that was the real signal that all was well for the Samajwadi parivar.

 When Jaya took oath as Rajya Sabha member in 2004, Amitabh Bachchan had turned up with daughter Shweta, son Abhishek and Anil and Tina Ambani. From the visitors gallery, he had greeted his wifes House debut with a thumbs-up.

 Two years on, as Jaya entered the Upper House again amid speculation that her husband was unhappy with her political career, Amitabh was there with his daughter.

 As if making a public statement, he walked in with party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, his no. 2 Amar Singh and Lok Sabha member Jaya Prada.

 The only face missing was that of Anil Ambani, who quit his Rajya Sabha seat when his political affiliation threatened to hurt his business interests.

 Rumour mills said Jaya might follow suit because Amitabh was unhappy with the way Amar was targeting Sonia Gandhi. The story was debunked when Jaya plunged into electioneering on Sonias turf of Rae Bareli, specifically attacking the Congress chief in her campaign.

 In Assam, she read out a message in Bengali on Amitabhs behalf in a Bengali-dominated constituency. On one particular day, as Sonia hopped from constituency to constituency in Bengal, she showed up in the same places after Sonia had left.

 Today, asked what she thought of Sonias resignation from the Lok Sabha and her re-election, Jaya said: Whatever you people say Im ready to accept. If you say it is sacrifice, it is sacrifice if you say it is not, it is not. I will only tell my personal opinion to my party and its leaders.

 She said she had chosen to stay on in politics ? unlike Amitabh ? because leaders in my party are known for their steadfastness. Another shot at the Congress ? and at hubbys expense ? but Amitabh didnt seem to mind.

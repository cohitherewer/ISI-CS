 Milk brand row boils

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 4: The Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation faces fresh controversy over a move to force all its 12 dairy-union members to sell under a single brand in the state.

 Many of these unions, passionate about the local brands they have nurtured over the years, have hit out at the proposal that the federation says will cut advertising costs.

 The differences are expected to set up a stormy board meeting tomorrow that has been called by managing director B.M. Vyas to consider the proposal.

 The federations dairy unions, which together command a Rs 3,700-crore market, sell within their districts under their own brands, such as Vasudhara (Valsad union), Sumul (Surat), Madhur (Gandhinagar) and Uttam (Ahmedabad).

 The rest is sold outside under the umbrella brand names Amul and Sagar, with Amul enjoying the larger share of the market.

 The local brands have been developed after years of effort. All this cannot be washed out by imposing a common brand, said Surat Dairy chairman Manubhai Patel.

 Among the bitterest critics of the single-brand idea is Mehsana Dairy chairman Vipul Chaudhary, who recently lost a bitter election to the federations top job.

 Why cant there be multiple brands to cater to the needs of different market segments? he asked.

 Sources said it was Chaudharys move to sell his entire produce independently of the federation, under his dairys local brand name Dudhsagar, that had prompted some of the federations directors to moot a single brand.

 The move is believed to have been suggested by National Dairy Development Board chairperson Amrita Patel to prevent Chaudhary from bypassing the federation and joining hands with organised retailers.

 Chaudharys Rs 1,000-crore dairy produces 13.5 lakh litres a day, the highest among the 12 unions. He had been the mostly likely candidate to head the federation after Verghese Kurien quit, but alleged political pressure from Gandhinagar ensured the victory of Parthi Bhatol.

 Since then, Chaudhary had been hinting at parting ways with the federation. Sources said he had recently placed an order for new packaging material carrying the brand name Dudhsagar, setting off panic in the federation.

 Chaudhary had written to Patel for advice on his plan to make his dairy self-reliant. Patel suggested he seek guidance from Kurien, her arch-rival whom Mehsana Dairy has appointed adviser.

 Chaudhary wrote back: We are greatly disappointed with your reply as the NDDB is mandated and claims to be committed to help promote dairy co-operatives in the country.

 Supporters of a single brand include Jetha Patel, chairman of the Sabarkantha Dairy, Gujarats third largest. Patel believes a common brand will help the farmer and cut advertising and marketing costs.

 Kheda union chairman Ramsinh Parmar agrees: It is a good idea to have a common brand.

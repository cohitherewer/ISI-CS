 Arms guru session before shopping spree

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: Indias defence establishment begins a three-day consultation tomorrow with arms transfer experts and military analysts ahead of planned purchases worth more than $10 billion over the next five years. 

 The establishment is now budgeting for big buys but its critics say New Delhi is preparing for an arms race.

 It is about time that we took stock of what is happening worldwide, said defence finance secretary V.K. Misra, who is hosting the gathering of arms transfer gurus. We want an understanding of the best practices before we decide what is good for ourselves.

 Despite a US Congressional research report last week ranking India among the top buyers of military equipment, the defence establishment says that procurements are still far from meeting requirements. Misra said Indias defence spending was at only 2.25 per cent of the GDP.

 The meetings planned for this week are expected to help realign Indian arms procurement policies to meet western standards. India is largely dependent on Soviet-era weaponry for its armed forces. Its procurement policies so far have also been more attuned to the Russian suppliers. In the last three years, however, the US and Israel have prised open the Indian defence market.

 The reshaping of the defence procurement policy was begun by Pranab Mukherjee who acknowledged shortly after taking over as defence minister that US offers of arms supplies had made India take a relook at its processes. It is at the behest of Mukherjee who has since moved to external affairs that Misra will host a first-of-its-kind international seminar on defence finance and economics for which 80 military experts from 28 countries have confirmed participation.

 Proposals thrown up from the consultations are likely to be pencilled into reforms the defence establishment is ushering in. Mukherjee, defence minister A.K. Antony and finance minister P. Chidambaram will address the seminar and sit in for the consultations.

 Among the experts are officials from the Stockholm Peace Research Institute, a watchdog on arms transfers whose reports are consulted by governments around the world, the US Pentagon, the UK department of defence, the Rand Corporation and Israeli military establishments.

 The agenda drawn up covers nearly every aspect of defence trade guns versus butter, teeth-to-tail ratios and technology challenges. We hope to bridge the gap between think tanks and practitioners by bringing them together on one platform and will also demystify some of the complex concepts used in defence finance, Misra said.

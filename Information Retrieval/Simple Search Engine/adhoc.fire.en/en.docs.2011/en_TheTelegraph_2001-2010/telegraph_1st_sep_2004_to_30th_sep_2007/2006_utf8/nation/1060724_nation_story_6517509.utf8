 Murthy no to politics

 Bangalore, July 23 (PTI): Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy has said he has no plans to venture into politics once he retires. 

 I have no desire to enter politics. Because I am not suited for that, Murthy, who retires from Infosys on August 20 when he turns 60, said in an interview. 

 Politics, he said, is a very complex canvas with multiple divides ? urban and rural, rich and poor, and educated and not-so-educated. So, I dont think I am competent to handle such a complex canvas. 

 Murthy said: I have some experience in working with a set of homogeneous people, that is well-educated people, whose objectives are very much aligned with my objectives... People who believe in certain values.

 He said he could understand why different politicians take divergent stands on the same issue because they are looking at it from their vantage point.

 Its like the elephant and the six blind men kind of stuff. Everybody is right. But the challenge we have is how to make sure that all these six people come together, describe the points of view, discuss, debate and come out with an integrated view which will help the entire society. So, its a big challenge, he pointed out. 

 Murthy also said his 22-year-old son Rohan, who is doing his PhD at Harvard and is now on an internship with Microsoft, did not want to step into his shoes. 

 He hinted Rohan may have a venture of his own. I think Rohan is much smarter than I am. So, he probably will have some good ideas on what he wants to do. Whatever he wants to do, our (his and wife Sudhas) encouragement will always be there.

 Dal (U) backs up Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs recent announcement to bring a no-confidence motion on the Iran issue has spurred the Janata Dal (United) into action.

 The NDA ally, with an eye on the Muslim vote bank, has offered to help Mulayam get the required number of MPs for introduction of the motion in the Lok Sabha.

 At a Samajwadi Party rally in Lucknow on Wednesday, Mulayam had said his party would bring the no-confidence motion against the Congress-led UPA government in the budget session.

 If the party decides to go ahead with its threat, it will require the support of at least 50 Lok Sabha members. At present, it has 38 MPs. 

 The Dal (U), which has eight, has pledged to muster the remaining MPs from among the non-BJP partners of the NDA.

 Mulayam is in a predicament as he would neither like to be seen openly with the BJP nor count on the Left on a move that may threaten the government.

 The Left parties, who are unhappy with the government for Indias vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency, have, however, preferred not to align with the Samajwadi Party chief.

 Dal (U) spokesperson Shambhu Shrivastava today said his partys support would help the Samajwadi Party introduce the motion even without the Lefts backing.

 Dal (U) sources claimed that even if the motion was defeated, it would push the Congress and the Left parties on the backfoot, and if the Samajwadi Party decided to drop the idea, Mulayam would get exposed among the Muslims.

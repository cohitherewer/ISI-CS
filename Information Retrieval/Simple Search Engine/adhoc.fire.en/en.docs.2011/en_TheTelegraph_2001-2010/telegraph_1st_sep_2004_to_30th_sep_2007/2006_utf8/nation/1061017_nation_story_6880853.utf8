 Singh date with defence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is to address a conference of the commanders of the armed forces on Wednesday even as the defence establishment grapples with the uncomfortable question of whether or not to act against the Israeli suppliers alleged to have bribed George Fernandes amp; Co to win the Barak missile deal in 2000.

 Singhs address to the commanders is an annual event but this year it has assumed importance because the CBI last week began detailing the allegations against the former defence minister, a former navy chief and others. In his only public utterances so far, Singh has said the policy on middlemen in defence needs to be examined.

 But defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and his establishment have practically ruled out blacklisting Israel Aircraft Industries, unlike others like Denel of South Africa, Bofors of Sweden and HDW of Germany in the past who were alleged to have used bribery to win multi-crore contracts from India.

 Mukherjees future in the defence ministry itself is suspect because Singh and UPA chief Sonia Gandhi are understood to have sounded him out for the external affairs job.

 Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash today re-stated more forcefully than in the past that the navy was happy with the Barak missile defence system for its ships.

 Mumbai cops clear out Shivaji 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: Maharashtra police today launched a drive to seize copies of James W. Laines The Epic of Shivaji, which allegedly makes derogatory references to the Maratha warrior king.

 The state has already slapped a ban on the 2001 book by the Minnesota-based American scholar.

 Director-general of police P.S. Pasricha confirmed the state-wide operation to confiscate unsold copies of the book, which is a translation and analysis of the treatise Shivabharata. 

 Co-authored by Laine and S.S. Bahulkar, a Sanskrit scholar at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, the book was published by Orient Longman.

 Following complaints from Shivajis 13th descendant Udayan Raje Bhosle about the use of the words Oedipal rebel twice to describe the 16th- century warrior king, the Democratic Front government decided to ban the book yesterday. 

 A crime branch team today visited the Orient Longman office at Ballard Pier in south Mumbai, and seized 25 copies of The Epic. 

 The publishing house said that in 2005, a person from Delhis Shivaji Library had brought the objectionable words to its notice. 

 It had promptly recalled all existing copies and blacked out the words with Laines consent, said Sheila Kurian, the regional manager of Orient Longman.

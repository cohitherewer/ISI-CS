 Jaya meal scheme

 Chennai, Dec. 31: In a New Years Eve largesse, Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa has extended the Anna Dhaan scheme to twice the number of temples that now offer free midday meals to needy devotees, reports our special correspondent.

 The decision, a few months before scheduled Assembly polls, means 360 temples will offer the free meal everyday from the Pongal festival on January 14. The scheme now runs in 180 temples. The digits in 360 add up to 9, believed to be lucky for Jayalalithaa.

 She had launched the scheme in March 2002 at the Kapaleeshwarar Temple here. A vegetarian fare of rice, sambaar, rasam, papad, kootu (mixed-vegetable dish) is served to 150 people on a first-come-first-served basis.

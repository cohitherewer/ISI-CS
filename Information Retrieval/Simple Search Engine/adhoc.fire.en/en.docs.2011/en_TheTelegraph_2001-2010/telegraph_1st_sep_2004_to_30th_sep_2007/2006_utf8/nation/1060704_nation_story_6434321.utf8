 Don gets life for murder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: Extradited gangster Babloo Srivastava was today handed a life term for the murder of Delhi businessman Lalit Suneja 14 years ago.

 Nitin Shah, a Mumbai-based businessman accused of hiring Babloos services to get Suneja killed, was also awarded a life sentence by judge Rajender Kumar. Both were convicted of murder and criminal conspiracy to commit murder.

 Manjit Singh, one of the three alleged killers, was acquitted for lack of evidence. Manish Dixit and Virender Pant, the two others, had died during the trial.

 Babloo, whose real name is Om Prakash, is believed to have once worked for Dawood Ibrahim, and later for Chhota Rajan when both walked out of the D-company.

 Babloo had fled the country after Sunejas murder in east Delhi on August 2, 1992, but was extradited from Singapore in August 1995.

 The extradition was only for Sunejas murder, although Babloo was wanted in two other murders, in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, and two cases of extortion, in Delhi and Mumbai.

 International extradition treaties demand that the accused cannot be tried in any case other than the ones they have been extradited for. The other cases thus having effectively fallen through, the police spent eight long years gathering evidence against Babloo in Sunejas murder.

 We had filed the chargesheet then (in 1995) but could not afford to let him escape from this case, ACP Tarun Singh said.

 In 2003, the prosecution began recording evidence in front of a sessions court, a process that continued for over two years. Seeing the long delay, Delhi High Court directed a fast-track court to take the case over in January this year.

 Sub-inspector Hanuman Dan, who had received a complaint from the victim about threats from the don, and 32 other witnesses deposed before the fast-track court.

 Mumbai police still want to interrogate Babloo about alleged links with the citys underworld.

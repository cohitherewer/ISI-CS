 Raj ends Valentine war

 SATISH NANDGAONKAR

 A THING OF PAST?

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: Once, his supporters led the Shiv Senas attacks on greetings-card shops and hotels hosting Valentines Day parties. But in his new avatar as an alternative to the Sena, youth leader Raj Thackeray wants to be seen as more liberal.

 Ahead of Valentines Day next week, Raj has told his supporters not to oppose the February 14 celebrations. The move is being seen as the first step by Raj towards shaping a new party that would vie for the Senas vote bank ? the Maharashtrian youth ? but be more tolerant on some issues.

 The Sena, which has announced it would oppose Valentines Day in principle, too might restrict itself to token protests.

 Yes, Rajsaheb has instructed us not to oppose Valentines Day, said a close associate of Raj, who is in Jalna in Marathawada on the second leg of his statewide tour.

 When he (Raj) was in the Sena, he was basically following the instructions of Balasaheb, like all Shiv Sainiks do. Having now set out to carve his own space in state politics, he will still not support it (Valentines Day) but, more important, he will not vociferously oppose it either.

 Rajs new stand is believed to be the result of interactions with educated Maharashtrians during his current tour. The feedback during his tour indicated that the young generation could not identify with anti-Valentines Day protests, another associate said.

 Valentines Day is popular with the educated Marathi-speaking youth. To counter the Sena rhetoric that the February 14 celebrations are un-Indian, companies have flooded the shops with greetings cards written in Marathi and Hindi.

 It is, however, not clear if Raj would extend his liberal outlook to other Sena issues like its stand against Bihari migrants. Rajsahebs tour would be on till February 23. After his return to Mumbai, he would formulate the agenda for his new party, an associate said.

 Kurien: Losing grip

 Ahmedabad , June 5: Verghese Kurien today stepped down as chairman of the Institute of Rural Management in Anand before its board could move a no-confidence motion against him.

 His detractors were in the majority ? of the 14 board members, 10 wanted the chairman to go ? so Kurien saw the writing on the wall. He had no option but to resign.

 For the milkman of India, it was almost a repeat of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation embarrassment a little over two months ago. Kurien quit as the co-operatives chief on March 22, just two days before its board was to meet to pass a no-confidence motion against him.

 He was facing a similar rebellion at the rural management institute where his rivals had decided to move the no-confidence motion against him in a board meeting on June 8.

 Kurien was also aware that five co-opted members, who will be re-inducted into the board in keeping with a Gujarat High Court order, were against his continuation as chairman of the institute he set up in 1979. The co-opted board members were being backed by Kuriens arch rival and one-time prot?g?e Amrita Patel.

 Against his wishes, Kurien was forced to endorse the co-option of the five members ? IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia, NID chairman Hasmukh Shah, former secretary to government of India V. Ramachandran, director of Xavier Institute of Management Father Abraham and industrialist Vijay Mahajan.

 On April 15 last year, four of the five members were barred from entering the institutes premises and made to sit outside the gate as Kurien presided over a board meeting.

 A sources at IRMA said Kurien had probably made up his mind to quit after he was forced to endorse to co-option of the five members whom he had earlier opposed.

 The board is also keen to remove L.K. Vaswani, the acting director of IRMA who was brought in by Kurien. Vaswani was brought in to replace P.K. Reddy whom Kurien sacked in April last year.

 Other members opposed to Kurien include a state government nominee, Nilima Khaitan of Udairpur, and, of course, National Dairy Development Board chairperson Amrita Patel, believed to be fuelling the rebellion against her one-time mentor.

 With the Narendra Modi governments blessings, Patel could replace Kurien as the institutes chairperson.

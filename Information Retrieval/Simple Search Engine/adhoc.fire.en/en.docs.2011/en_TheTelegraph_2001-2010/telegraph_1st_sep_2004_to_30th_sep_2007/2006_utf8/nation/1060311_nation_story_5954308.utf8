 SC clears air on witnesses

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 10: The Supreme Court has held that courts cannot discard depositions by witnesses in a murder case merely because they are relatives of the victim or interested parties.

 It is well-settled that in a murder trial, merely because a witness is interested or inimical, his evidence cannot be discarded unless the same is otherwise found to be not trustworthy, a bench of Justices B.N. Agrawal and A.K. Mathur said.

 The judges made the observation while setting aside a Jammu and Kashmir High Court order acquitting two persons in a murder case.

 Yush Paul Singhs father and uncle were among the three witnesses to his murder. 

 But with the third witness only partly supporting the prosecution story, the court had discarded the deposition of the father and the uncle and acquitted the duo.

 The high court was not justified in disbelieving them on the sole ground that they were interested persons, the apex court said.

 The bench also ruled that delay in sending the FIR to a magistrate cannot be a ground to throw the prosecution case if evidence cited is found to be credible and trustworthy.

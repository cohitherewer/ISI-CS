 Doctors back next week

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 11: Resident doctors in Maharashtra will resume work on Monday after their 12-day strike was called off last night.

 The doctors and the state government have agreed on an increased monthly stipend. The stipend will be a minimum of Rs 12,700, up from Rs 8,000 earlier.

 Representatives of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, which spearheaded the agitation, met A.H. Khan, the secretary for medical education, last evening and signed the agreement after a long meeting. 

 The strike began after two doctors ? in King Edward Memorial Hospital, Parel, and Bhabha Hospital, Bandra ? were assaulted by patients relatives in separate incidents on February 27. 

 The state government has already appointed a four-member committee to study the living and working conditions of over 7,000 resident doctors and submit a report in a month. 

 But the doctors had continued with the strike despite the appointment of the committee and verbal assurances after the government refused to give any written promise that it would meet their demands. 

 The doctors had asked that assaults on them be made non-bailable offences, that they be provided better security at work, a raise in their stipend and a better doctor-patient ratio. 

 Although the state government agreed to place the demands before the cabinet, it has asked for at least three months to implement them. 

 The stipend increase would happen only after the Vilasrao Deshmukh cabinet ratifies the decision. 

 Minister for medical education Dilip Walse Patil has assured that no action would be taken against the striking doctors.

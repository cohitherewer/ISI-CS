 - Doctors surprised at lack of illness

 Mumbai, Aug. 20: At least 50,000 Mumbaikars yesterday gulped down sea water in the hope of a miracle, and miracle it was that 24 hours later no one was reported ill.

 We have kept all civic hospitals on alert in anticipation of a rash of complaints of diarrhoea and abdominal pain, but at 5 pm, we have not had any admissions, said Dr Neelima Kshirsagar, dean of KEM Hospital. 

 KEM and Sion, the hospitals closest to Mahim Creek where people drank sweet sea water ignoring warnings, were on alert. 

 Infections can occur as a result of either bacterial or viral contamination of water, Dr Kshirsagar said. By now, at least cases of bacterial contamination should have emerged.

 Dr B. Yeolekar, the dean of Sion Hospital, added: It ultimately depends on whether people drank a spoonful, a cupful or a bottle of water. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, griping pain, mild or severe dysentery should manifest.

 Mumbaikars who believed a miracle had made the water sweet had gulped down large quantities since Friday night, even feeding it to children. 

 The National Institute of Oceanography experts had pointed out that the sweet water was neither the salty sea water nor water treated by the BMC. It was an intermediate quality, largely fresh water. It is possible that it may not result in severe problems, but minor problems like stomach aches and vomiting which people may not report to civic hospitals, Dr Yeolekar said.

 Hundreds were on the beach today, down from an estimated one lakh yesterday.

 Rakesh Kumar, senior assistant director of the National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute, found it difficult to explain the absence of significant illness. 

 On August 17, when our teams collected water samples from Mahim Creek, we found very high levels of bacteria in it. It was as high as 100,000 per ml of water. Mahim and Dadar beaches have sewage pumping stations.

 But doctors said several factors might explain why people have not fallen ill. 

 There is an infective dose for most disease-causing microbes a minimum number that would have to be ingested for the organisms to cause disease. The infective dose could vary from 10 to 1000, said Anuj Sharma, a microbiologist and public health specialist at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi. 

 Immunity can also prevent illness. When 10 people eat contaminated food even when all have ingested more than the infective dose not all will fall sick, he said.

 Sewage water typically contains organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, and E-coli that cause diarrhoea. But a small sip may not cause illness in most healthy adults. 

 But Sohail Khandwani says: I have no doubt it was Baba Maqdooms miracle. I first tasted the water at 9 pm on Friday and kept having some every three or four hours. The water was not only tasting sweet, it was clean. Around 9.45 am on Saturday, the high tide came in and the water turned murky. We stopped drinking.

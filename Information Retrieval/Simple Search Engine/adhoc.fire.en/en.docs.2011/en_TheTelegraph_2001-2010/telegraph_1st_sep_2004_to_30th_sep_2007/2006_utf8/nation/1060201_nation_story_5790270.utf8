The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left thunders, govt clears air on Esma

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The government has so far confined its show of strength to a declaration that the Indian Air Force is on standby, taking care to make it clear that a dreaded law would not be sprung on airport employees who stop working. 

 A few hours after the CPM warned against invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma), which arms the government with extraordinary powers to enforce its will, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said: I dont know from where this news about Esma came. We never proposed to invoke Esma.

 The capital was abuzz with speculation earlier in the day that the government was putting in place measures to activate the law.

 The buzz prompted CPM leader Sitaram Yechury to issue a public warning. If the Centre imposes Esma on employees, it will have to face serious repercussion. We have accepted the challenge of government and if Esma is imposed, it will turn out to be a political question and the UPA government would face serious results, he said.

 But, officially, the Left tried to portray the agitation as a trade union event without any political link. 

 Citu leader and Rajya Sabha MP Dipankar Mukherjee said: The agitation is being done by the airports employees union which includes not just the Left but every other section. We are not doing anything. The decisions are being taken by the union.

 In Delhi, the Airports Authority of India officers associations have decided to launch a relay hunger strike.

 After a morning of demonstrations by AAI employees and Left trade unions, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and CPI national secretary D. Raja met the Prime Minister and urged him to reconsider the decision.

 We are not opposed to modernisation but do not want private players, said Karat. 

 The government today asked the IAF to stand by. A defence ministry spokesman said all air traffic controllers and ground controlling staff of the IAF have been told to be on 24-hour standby in case civilian flights are disrupted.

 The civil aviation ministry has requested IAF assistance in providing crash fire-fighting and rescue in 20 airports.

 Air force communication and radar operators and technicians have also been kept on short-notice standby to man critical facilities. The 20 airports include Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Nagpur, Chandigarh and Amritsar. 

 Delhi has asked state governments to put in place systems to ensure that no disruption takes place at the airports in providing regular services.

 Calcutta protest

 Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said in Calcutta that the government could do very little if the airport strike is peaceful. It all depends on what the Centre decides. If the strike takes place all over the country, theres very little we can do, Deb said.

 Airports Authority of India employees staged protests at Calcutta airport throughout the day. No cancellation of flights or major disruption was reported, but there were a few delays, airport sources said.

 None of the domestic or international airlines cancelled any flight till late tonight. We are keeping a watch on the situation, said an airline official.

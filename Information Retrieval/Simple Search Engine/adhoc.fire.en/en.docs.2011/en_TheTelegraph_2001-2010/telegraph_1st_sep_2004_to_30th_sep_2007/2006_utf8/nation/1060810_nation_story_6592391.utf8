 Maneater hunted down

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 End of peril 

 Lucknow, Aug. 9: Roopkali, Champakali and Pawankali swaggered triumphantly this morning through the sal- shrouded Dudhwa National Park, having finally helped vanquish the blood-thirsty tiger that had mauled four villagers.

 Perched on the three elephants, a team led by P.P. Singh, the parks deputy director, had scoured the wilderness for days but the search for the striped killer turned frustratingly arduous until 5 am today. That was when the hunt ended in Tanda Kamp village near the Kishanpur sanctuary in Dudhwa, 260 km from the Uttar Pradesh capital.

 As it lay sprawled across on the ground, Singh and his colleague, Mohammad Ehsan, knew they had quelled the fears of villagers still haunted by Tara, the tigress who snuffed the lives out of 24 people in nine months before being shot dead in November 1979. The first victim of a man-eating tiger here was reported on March 2, 1978.

 We had no other option but to kill it. It became impossible to trap. Nor could it be tranquilised, Ehsan said. The wildlife division of the states forest department initially tried tranquilising, and then, trapping. 

 There was a belief that it was driven out of its lair and isolated from the herd. Wildlife experts thought it was this sense of insecurity that led the tiger to kill humans.

 Later however, we found out the tiger had holed itself up in a small patch of the jungle near Tanda Kamp. From this spot, it was killing goats and other animals of the village, Singh said. 

 The park deputy director explained that using a tranquilising gun would not have been effective since the tiger would have claimed more victims in the village before losing consciousness.

 Other forest officers admitted 

 it was extremely unfortunate that the tiger, 

 which killed four villagers since May 21, had to be shot 

 down, but insisted that the situation did not allow them 

 to take chances any further.

 Girl dead

 Krishnagar, June 13: An 11-year-old girl was found dead in the septic tank of her neighbours house in a Chakdah neighbourhood last night. 

 Police said Tumpa Sardars head was smashed and she could have been raped before being killed. The girl from Durganagar in Nadia, 60 km from Calcutta, went missing on Sunday after she left home to attend a soiree. 

 A local youth, Uttam Das, 25, with whom she was seen on Sunday, has been detained.

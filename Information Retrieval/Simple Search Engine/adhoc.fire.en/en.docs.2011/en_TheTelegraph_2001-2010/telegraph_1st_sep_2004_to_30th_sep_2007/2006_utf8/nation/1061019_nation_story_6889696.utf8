The directors-general of paramilitary forces, including the Special Protection Group (SPG) that provides security to the Prime Minister, also attended the meeting.

 If the security level is raised, Sonias convoy will have right of way, a pilot vehicle equipped with electronic jammers to foil remote-controlled attacks, a specially designed bullet-proof car and an ambulance escort along with a team of doctors.

 A fleet of seven vehicles will guard the flanks, the front and the back of the entourage.

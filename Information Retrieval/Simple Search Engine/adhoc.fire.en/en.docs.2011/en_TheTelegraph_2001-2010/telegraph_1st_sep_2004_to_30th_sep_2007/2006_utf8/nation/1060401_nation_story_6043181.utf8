 Warrant against Dawood brother

 Mumbai (PTI): An anti-terror court on 

 Friday issued a non-bailable warrant against Anees Ibrahim, 

 younger brother of fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim, for his 

 alleged complicity in the Pradeep Jain murder case.

 A non-bailable warrant was also issued against Sunil Nair, Aneess close associate.

 Special public prosecutor Ujjal Nikam said both had been absconding since a long time and the prosecution wanted to go ahead with the trial, especially after extradited don Abu Salem, the prime accused in the case, told police that he executed the murder on instructions of Anees.

 The prosecution said it wanted to arrest Anees and Nair and would eventually ensure that both were declared proclaimed offenders before requesting Interpol to help arrest them.

 Jain, a builder, was allegedly murdered by Salems shooters after he refused to pay extortion money. 

 Clean chit to Chingaari 

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court 

 on Friday dismissed a plea to ban the screening of Chingaari 

 on the ground that it was hurtful to the sentiments of Hindus, 

 says our correspondent.

 A Gorakhpur-based NGO had alleged that there were objectionable references to Draupadi and Duhshashan in the Mithun Chakravarty-Sushmita Sen starrer, which was released on February 11. 

 The PIL also alleged that it was tainted with objectionable dialogues and vulgarity.

 Sushmita, who acts as a prostitute in the film, is compared with Draupadi and Mithun, a priest in the movie, is shown as a villain who rapes women and commits other offences, including murder, the petition said.

 Petrol thieves

 Ajmer (PTI): Eleven people 

 have been arrested for allegedly stealing petroleum by drilling 

 an IOC pipeline and Rs 5 lakh, besides equipment used for 

 the job, police said on Friday.

 The gang from Gujarat had siphoned off petrol worth Rs 30 lakh over the past two weeks, the police said. The leader is still at large. 

 Trawler mishap

 Panaji (PTI): Six persons 

 were feared drowned and two rescued when a fishing trawler 

 capsized after hitting a ship off the Vengurla coast in

 Sea Master, had left Malim jetty here on March 29 and met 

 with the accident on Thursday.

 and explosives packed in two Pakistani cooking gas cylinders 

 were found by security forces on Friday from near the Line 

 of Control in Jammu and Kashmirs Poonch district.

 The army will set up a multi-purpose womens home in Jammu

 Modi pardons mailer

 Ahmedabad, Jan. 29: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has pardoned a man who allegedly sent him an abusive threat email, official sources said today, reports our correspondent.

 The chief minister has decided to pardon Omar Siddiqui as he has admitted and repented after sending the email. Moreover, the CM felt that he had sent the mail without thinking, state intelligence bureau chief J. Mahapatra said. The official said Modi also thought that Omar was educated and the incident would spoil his future.

 Omar was arrested by Gujarat police on Friday from Delhi and brought to Ahmedabad the next day.

 Omars father Irfan was summoned for questioning. He and one of Omars sisters are in Ahmedabad and have met officials of the anti-terrorist squad (ATS).

 The ATS officials, however, refused to divulge where Irfan and his daughter were staying. Asked if Modi had met them before pardoning Omar, an official said he was not aware of such a meeting.

 The ATS nabbed Omar, a senior executive in an outsourcing firm, from his home and seized a computer from which he allegedly sent the hate mail to Modi in December last year.

 This is the second time the Gujarat chief minister has pardoned someone who has allegedly threatened him.

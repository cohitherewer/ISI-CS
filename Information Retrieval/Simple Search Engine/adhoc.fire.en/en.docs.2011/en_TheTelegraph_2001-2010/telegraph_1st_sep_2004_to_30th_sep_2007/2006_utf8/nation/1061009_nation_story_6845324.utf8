 Air hostesses battle fat bar 

 New Delhi, Oct. 8 (PTI): A group of air hostesses has taken the airline Indian to court for suspending them from duty for being overweight.

 A single-judge Delhi High Court bench of Justice J.M. Malik ordered the public sector airline to pay salaries to the air hostesses for the suspension period. But Indian has appealed before a division bench of Justices Mukul Mudgal and J.P. Singh against the order.

 In a petition filed through their counsel Arvind Kumar Sharma, air hostess Sheela Joshi and others have accused the airline of resorting to such tactics to get rid of air hostesses aged 45 years and above.

 The immediate provocation for the petition was a circular issued by Indians executive director for in-flight services saying that from June 15, 2006, the grace permitted to air hostesses for being 3-kg overweight had been withdrawn.

 Sharma has not only challenged the circular but has also questioned the rationale for suspending overweight air hostesses. He argued that competence could not be judged merely by the weight of a person.

 According to the petition, the airline had in June 1990 issued a circular in which it asked air hostesses who were overweight by 10 kg to shed 1 kg every month but there was no threat of their being grounded. Subsequent circulars fixed the maximum overweight limit at 5 kg and later at 3 kg.

 Air hostesses who could not reduce their weight were suspended from duties and denied salaries. About 40 such air hostesses have been suspended for being overweight over the years and reinstated after they reduced weight.

 The case will come up for hearing again on October 18.

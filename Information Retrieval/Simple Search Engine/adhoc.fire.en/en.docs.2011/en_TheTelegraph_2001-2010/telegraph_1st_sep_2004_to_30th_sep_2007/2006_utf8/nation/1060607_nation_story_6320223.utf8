The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket faces Cup rival

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, June 6: Strengthening core markets like Calcutta and opening up non-traditional ones like Gujarat is part of ESPN STAR Sports strategy to counter cricket with football, more precisely with World Cup 2006 for which it has exclusive telecast rights.

 There has been a growth of viewership across genres mainly due to the emerging generation which is broader in its appreciation of other sports. The soccer franchise, particularly, is showing strong growth, said R.C. Venkateish, managing director of ESPN India. 

 With so much cricket going around, theres a fatigue factor... Besides, India cricket has become rather expensive. 

 The sports channel, which lost the bid to cover international cricket matches to be played in the country over the next four years, is expecting a jump in viewership as the football extravaganza gets under way in Germany this week.

 The 2002 edition saw viewership of 2-3 (TRP or Television Rating Points) for group matches, 3-4 for quarters and 10 for the finals. We expect at least a jump of 50 to 60 per cent, Venkateish said. This time the matches will be in the evening during prime viewing time, compared to 2002s mid-afternoon slots.

 If Brazil reaches its third consecutive final, things should get even better.

 In the past few years, football viewership has grown steadily, spearheaded by properties like English Premier League (EPL) and Euro 2004.

 EPL has grown in leaps and bounds. Despite having a huge inventory spread over the entire year, the number of matches with a rating of over 1 has grown from 4 to 14 this season. The top 20 matches involving the top five teams also threw up ratings of up to 8, comparable to some of the most-watched soaps or even one-dayers featuring India, Venkateish said.

 The TRPs are for the 15-plus male category, the standard for sports events.

 For 2004-05, EPLs reach ? or the number of unique individuals who watched at least one match ? grew to 42.8 million, or one in every two cable homes. The reach for live football on the network over the past 12 months grew by 26 per cent.

 The broadcaster is using localisation to drive the growth in Hindi-speaking markets. World Cup commentary will be available in Hindi, something with which ESPN-STAR Sports tasted success during Euro 2004. 

 Hindi commentary helped us open up non-traditional soccer markets like UP, Gujarat and Punjab where passion for the sport is still at a relatively nascent stage, Venkateish said.

 Key markets like Calcutta would receive a special thrust. Calcutta is the market for us which would probably deliver record-breaking viewership. Even in our tie-ups with sponsors there is a greater emphasis for this region.

 Ban on defence brokers to stay

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Pranab Mukherjee today said the ban on agents who function as middlemen in defence deals will continue.

 He was speaking at a seminar on defence procurement and acquisitions this afternoon when speculation was rife on his move to the ministry of external affairs.

 It is still not clear if the ban on use of middlemen in defence deals could be changed later. Mukherjee was speaking on the existing practice but also said that at a later stage, efforts may be made to get agents registered.

 With the defence procurement procedures formulated earlier this year, the armed forces are looking for a big and heavy buy. Each service has a shopping list running into billions of dollars aircraft for the air force, Howitzers for the army, ships and weapon systems for the navy, for example.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said last week that another look at the policy on middlemen in defence deals was needed. 

 Mukherjee said that during the previous NDA regime, the defence ministry had sought to legalise the agency practice and asked agents to register.

 But only two agents registered even as the government struck deals for major acquisitions like the Barak ship missile defence system. 

 Last fortnight, the CBI filed an FIR against former defence minister George Fernandes, alleging that middlemen in the Barak deal had paid bribes to win the contract for Israel Aircraft Industries.

 In the defence procurement procedures and manual drafted under Mukherjees leadership earlier this year, there is no provision legalising the use of agents. 

 Mukherjee said today that the defence procurement policy had made it mandatory for sellers to the Indian military to sign integrity pacts, and pledge themselves to transparent negotiations.

 There is a ban in force on middlemen, Mukherjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Vice-chief says sorry

 - Army skirts quit poser

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pattabhiraman

 New Delhi, June 20: The 

 vice-chief of army staff, Lieutenant General S. Pattabhiraman, 

 today apologised in the aftermath of a controversial remark 

 attributed to him that was said to be disparaging about 

 women in the army.

 A statement from army headquarters this evening comes after days of staunch denial and repeated assertions that the vice-chief was misquoted.

 The vice-chief was quoted in a newspaper report as having said the army could do without lady officers, a day after Lieutenant Susmita Chakraborthy shot herself in Udhampur, apparently out of professional frustration.

 Girija Vyas, head of the National Commission for Women, and BJP leader Sushma Swaraj had reacted to the report based on an interview of Pattabhiraman. Sushma had said: The defence minister should tell the vice-chief that the army can do without him.

 The army spokesman, asked if Pattabhiraman had offered to resign, said: No, he is not.

 Had he been told to resign or was he resigning? The spokesman replied: I am not aware of such a thing.

 The following is the full text of the army clarification: 

 It is unfortunate that during an interview on 16 June 2006 remarks ascribed to me by a journalist in relation to intake of lady officers in the army has caused consternation and generated adverse publicity.

 I would like to place on record that the lady officers joining the army as part of womens Special Entry Scheme have contributed in as much measure as their male counterparts towards upholding armys traditional work culture and ethos. They have also excelled in fields such as adventure sports and shooting, apart from providing value addition to armys work in fields such as education, IT, communication engineering, architecture, inventory management, intelligence and combat logistics.

 I also recognise that women of our country have played a stellar role not only in nation building but also in extreme adventure activities like climbing the Everest.

 Should my remarks, as reported in the press, have caused any anguish or doubt on my personal commitment and healthy respect towards the role of lady officers in the army, I have no hesitation in rendering an apology to such groups or sections of society or individuals.

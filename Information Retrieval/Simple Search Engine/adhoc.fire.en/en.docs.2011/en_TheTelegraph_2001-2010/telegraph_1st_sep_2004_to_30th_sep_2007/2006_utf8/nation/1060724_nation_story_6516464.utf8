 Church call for study fight

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, July 23: Churches across Kerala today called upon the faithful to resist the Marxists bid to trample on minority educational rights in a joint pastoral letter read out during Sunday mass from thousands of pulpits.

 The new Kerala Professional College Act is an assault on the basic character of the Constitution and aims at depriving minorities and future generations of rights guaranteed by the fathers of the Constitution? said the letter signed by seven prelates of the Inter-Church Council.

 The Constitution is very clear about the minority status and we will have it as long as the country exists.

 The recently passed act makes it difficult for the nearly 80 per cent professional colleges, run under different minority labels, to claim privileges in admissions and teacher recruitment.

 This, the Church believes, is aimed at encroaching on the rights guaranteed under Article 30, which entitles minorities to set up institutions and run them.

 The church heads also led the laity in observing a prayer-day across the Left-ruled state, where Christians account for about 20 per cent of the 32-million population.

 Education minister M.A. Baby, however, took a dig at church leaders when he told reporters they should also pray for the errant managements to return to the path of righteousness rather than fatten at the expense of the minority community.

 In the joint letter ? unusual since the practice is for a prelate to address members of his church through an individual pastoral letter ? the archbishops of the three Catholic Rites, the Jacobite Churches and the Church of South India asked the government not to use the language of intimidation.

 The letter, which showed how different Christian denominations in the state had closed ranks, also condemned the recent violence by the Students Federation of India against minority institutions.

 But the spotlight was on the prayers at the tombs of seven brave sons of the Church who died in police firing during the liberation struggle against the first Left-led government in Kerala in 1957.

 Several bishops cautioned the government against allowing the situation to deteriorate to that level which led to the dismissal of the state government in 1959.

 In the evening, an Inter-Church Council meeting marked the culmination of the protest meetings. 

 Tomorrow, the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council will meet in Kochi.

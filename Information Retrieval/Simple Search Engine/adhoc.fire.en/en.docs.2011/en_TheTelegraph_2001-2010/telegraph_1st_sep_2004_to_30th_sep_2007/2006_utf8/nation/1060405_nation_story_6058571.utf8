 CAS road map taking shape

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 4: After three meetings spread over a week, a consensus of sorts has emerged between the government and cable operators on implementing the conditional access system, which enables viewers to select and pay for only the channels of their choice.

 The operators say they could get the system rolling in eight or nine months but are not sure about the broadcasters who would offer their channels to viewers in the four metros.

 The broadcasters largely kept away from a meeting yesterday ? a marathon affair that lasted nearly six hours ? in which the operators sat across the table from information and broadcasting ministry officials.

 Cable operators said once the government issues the notification, a switch-over from cable to CAS could be carried out within 220 days.

 The lone prominent broadcaster which sent a representative to the meeting was Zee. Another meeting is now scheduled for Friday.

 The Indian Broadcasting Foundation is holding a meeting tomorrow, when it is expected to firm up the broadcasters view on CAS.

 OOPS! Carol Gracias adjusts her top after the wardrobe malfunction

 Mumbai, April 3: Maharashtra lawmakers are grappling with a big problem ? how to unravel the mystery behind a little bit of exposed flesh.

 Legislative council chairman Shivajirao Deshmukh today asked the state government to probe the controversial wardrobe malfunctions at the Lakme Fashion Week, which concluded on Saturday.

 The malfunctions happened twice on successive days and were hotly discussed. The first time was when the heavily embellished dress model Carol Gracias had on slipped. The next day, model Gauhar Khans skirt came off.

 Captured by both still and television cameras, the malfunctioning was aired by channels, while the clips made it to multimedia messages. Mumbai police said they would probe whether the slips were orchestrated or accidental.

 Raising the issue, Shiv Sena MLC Neelam Gorhe said it was yet to be established whether the slips were intentional but reeled off statistics of similar incidents across the world.

 Wardrobe malfunctions have happened in February 2004 in America, September 2004 in Sydney, November 2004 in New York, June 2004 in Norway, July 2005 in Germany and December 2005 in Cannes. Such acts are punishable offences under IPC sections 292, 292 A, 293 and 294. Obscene representation of a womans body is also an offence under obscenity laws, Gorhe said, demanding a probe.

 Gorhe said restrictions were necessary to ensure that organisers of such events, designers and TV channels do not violate anti-obscenity laws.

 Supporting Gorhe, BJP leader Nitin Gadkari said repeated beaming of these images could be a bad influence on children, and demanded that the home department serve notices on the electronic media for telecasting nudity.

 Deshmukh said it was a matter of shame and added that he would ask home minister R.R. Patil to attend the debates in the Assembly on the issue.

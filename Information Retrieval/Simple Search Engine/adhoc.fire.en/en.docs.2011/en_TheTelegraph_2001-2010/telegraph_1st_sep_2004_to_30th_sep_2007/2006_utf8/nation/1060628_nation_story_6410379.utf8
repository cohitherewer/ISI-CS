The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 A view of 1857, beyond Mangal Pandey

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Shyam Benegal: From a different angle

 New Delhi, June 27: Mangal Pandey is the best-known icon of the 1857 uprising that is celebrated in literature, theatre and films. But how many have heard of Begum Hazrat Mahal, Maulvi Ahmedullah Shah, Mehdi Hussain, Raja Benie Madhav or Khan Bahadur Khan?

 Not many, believes the UPA government.

 As it readies to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first war of independence, sources said the governments intention was not to convert it into another ritualistic extravaganza but make a larger political point by coming up with its subaltern version of the event.

 Little-known personalities who shaped the struggle as much as those enshrined in historical treatises will be celebrated and the period secularised as a counterpoint to the BJPs projection of some leaders (Rani of Jhansi, Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and even Pandey) as early symbols of Hindu nationalism.

 The idea will be (to) show up the BJPs understanding of this period as narrow and partisan by taking a more broad-based and secular view of it, a source said.

 Coinciding with the anniversary are two other milestones the government will play up as part of the Congresss larger agenda to appropriate the principal role in the freedom movement: 60 years of Independence and the centenary of the Vande Mataram.

 The BJP usurped this song as its party anthem because of the communal context in which it was located in Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyays novel, Anand Math.

 The group of ministers set up by the Prime Minister for the 1857 uprising celebrations today decided a film on the life and times of Begum Hazrat Mahal should be made.

 The proposal came from HRD minister Arjun Singh who said she rose from the ranks to become not just one of Wajid Ali Shahs wives but his Iftikharunnisa (Pride of all Women).

 She lived up to the title because after Wajid Ali Shah was deported from Lucknow to Calcutta, she led the mutineers and motivated the people of Avadh against the British.

 For six months, the revolutionaries led by the begum held fort in Avadh and commanded an army of 150,000, the largest any leader put up against the British.

 The begum raised Rs 5 lakh to build a wall around Lucknow to thwart the British forces. She also struck alliances with kings like Rana Jang Bahadur of Nepal. 

 But what struck the group of ministers ? comprising Arjun, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Shivraj Patil and Ambika Soni ? most was when the British finally laid siege to Avadh in March 1858, the begum did not desert the battlefield. She continued to fight from the fort of Baundi (now in Bahraich district). 

 In December 1858, she crossed over into Nepal and was granted residence by the king. She spurned British offers of the principality of Lucknow and a large annuity, saying she would not be a puppet in their hands. 

 For the Congress, Begum Hazrat Mahal being Muslim, woman and a freedom fighter was the right combination to package her as a role model. 

 The government plans to involve Muzaffar Ali, Shyam Benegal and Gautam Ghose in the project. It is also trying to rope in a woman filmmaker.

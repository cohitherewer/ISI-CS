 Uma sends BJP scurrying

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Uma: Back in action

 Bhopal, Feb. 13: Uma Bharti has drawn a rousing reception in Madhya Pradesh with her janadesh yatra (public mandate march), sending the BJP scurrying to set its house in order by appointing a new state party president.

 Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan now doubles as state BJP chief, but his inability to devote enough time to the party job has led to a rise in dissent in the state unit.

 The chief minister is reportedly lobbying for state panchayati raj minister Narendra Singh Tomar, so that he can have a favourable face in the post. But some in the party have urged the central leadership to consider state unit organisational secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki.

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh pracharak is seen as a crafty politician capable of neutralising the Uma effect. Sources said a decision was likely in 48 hours.

 Uma today stepped up the heat on Chauhan, asking him to present a report card on how many poll promises the party had fulfilled in the state after assuming power in December 2003.

 Dubbing the Chauhan regime as the B-team of the Congress, she claimed she was the real BJP. Her lieutenant and former Union minister Prahlad Patel said Uma would float a new party by April.

 The sadhvi, however, doesnt seem to be in any hurry. She has been keenly watching the BJP central leaderships embarrassment at influential Lodhi leader Kalyan Singhs open support for her. Kalyan, a contemporary of party national president Rajnath Singh in Uttar Pradesh, has repeatedly said the doors are open for Umas return.

 Patel said Uma could return to the BJP if she was offered the national presidents job.

 Uma, back in the state more than two months after her expulsion from the party, told a rally in Rewa she didnt intend to undermine the BJPs ideology.

 My only grief is that the wrong people are in the house while the real people are on the road, she said. Ram ka nam lekar zinda hun, Ram ka nam lekar marungi; lekin Jinnah ki mazaar par phool chadhane nahi jaungi (I live by Rams name, I shall die taking his name; Ill never visit Jinnahs tomb to place flowers).

 She said she plans to visit every Assembly segment in the state to keep up the pressure on the state government to fulfil its election promises.

 The Congress, too, has been comparing the Uma effect with its own poor showing. Ajay Singh, state Congress vice-president and son of Arjun Singh, admitted his party had failed to cash in on the state governments failures. If the Congresss downslide continues, it might end up third in the Assembly polls behind the BJP and the Uma faction, he said.

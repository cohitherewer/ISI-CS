 Jessica question sessions start

 - Ramanis, police officers quizzed 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bina and Malini Ramani

 New Delhi, March 21: Socialite Bina Ramani and 11 others, including police officers, were questioned today in connection with destruction of evidence during the investigation into the Jessica Lal murder case. 

 Delhi police officials were tightlipped about the identity of most of those questioned but confirmed that at least a dozen persons, including policemen, were questioned.

 The quiz related to the fresh first information report registered last month to probe allegations of destruction and fabrication of evidence.

 PTI reported that Binas husband George Mailhot and her daughter Malini were among those questioned today but officials neither confirmed nor denied this. The special investigation team quizzed the Ramanis at their South Delhi residence.

 The questioning of the Ramanis came a day after they met police commissioner K.K. Paul and offered full cooperation in the case.

 The Ramanis had appeared as witnesses for the prosecution and confirmed Manu Sharmas presence at the party being held at the Tamarind court complex on the intervening night of April 29 and 30, 1999.

 However, Bina, as well as her daughter, Malini, said they did not actually see Sharma shoot Jessica. This weakened the prosecutions case.

 After the murder, the police had put the Ramanis under the scanner for operating the caf? illegally. The police had also said blood stains were removed.

 Defence lawyer R.K. Naseem had alleged that the police had initially intended to charge the Ramanis with destruction of evidence but spared them when the two agreed to depose as witnesses. 

 The ongoing interrogation is expected to help the police in not only submitting a response on April 19 before Delhi High Court, which had issued a notice on the shoddy investigation, but also prosecute those who destroyed evidence. 

 The police, which had filed the fresh FIR against unnamed persons, are likely to name the accused in a fresh chargesheet. 

 Appeal hearing

 Delhi High Court will take up for hearing tomorrow the appeal filed by police challenging the acquittal of Manu Sharma and eight others. The case will come up for hearing before a division bench of Justices Manmohan Sarin and Manju Goel.

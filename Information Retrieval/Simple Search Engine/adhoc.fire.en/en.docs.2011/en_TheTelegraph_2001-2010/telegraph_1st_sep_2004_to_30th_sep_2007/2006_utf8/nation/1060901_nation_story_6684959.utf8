 Ulfa letter revives peace process

 New Delhi: The deadlock in the Ulfa-Delhi 

 peace process was has broken by a communiqu from the militant 

 group, assuring the government that the five jailed leaders 

 whose release it wants before starting a dialogue would 

 not abscond, reports our special correspondent. 

 Writer-mediator Mamoni Raisom Goswami delivered the letter from Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua to Union home secretary V.K. Duggal. 

 A senior Union home ministry official confirmed the development. He said the government was exploring options to find a meeting point between Ulfas demand for the release of its jailed leaders and accepting its conditions in toto. 

 Sources said one possibility was to allow the release of the five Ulfa leaders vice-president Pradip Gogoi, cultural secretary Pranati Deka, political adviser Bhimkanta Burahohain, publicity chief Mithinga Daimary and Ramu Mech and keep them under close watch to avoid a possible loss of face later. 

 Delhi is expected to take the decision during the scheduled inter-ministerial meeting on September 5 between the Prime Ministers Office and the ministries of defence and home. Another issue that could be discussed is the suspension of army operations against Ulfa. 

 Ulfas letter mentions that it cannot take any decision on the proposal for a dialogue with the government until its top-rung leaders are freed to facilitate a quorum in its executive council.

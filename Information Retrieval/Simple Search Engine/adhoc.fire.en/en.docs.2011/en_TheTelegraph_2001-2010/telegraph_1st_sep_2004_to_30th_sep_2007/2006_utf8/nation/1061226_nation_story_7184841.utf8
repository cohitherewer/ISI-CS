 Advani steals Rajnath show

 Advani: Class apart

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: The BJPs strategy session in Lucknow last week underscored two points that will be crucial to the partys fortunes in the near future. One, it has now identified what its political agenda should be and two, there is no one in the party who can articulate it better than L.K. Advani.

 The BJP, till recently shooting in the dark about which issues might catch the public imagination best, has zeroed in on several: the Centres alleged appeasement of Muslims, its poor handling of internal security and Muslim reservation.

 As it highlights these, the party will also reassert its natural agenda, which includes the Ram temple on Ayodhyas disputed site, a uniform civil code and the repeal of Article 370 that grants Kashmir special status.

 It was, however, left to Advani to explain these core issues after BJP president Rajnath Singh failed to sum them up for the 2,300-odd delegates.

 It was not just his poor sense of timing or the nasty jibes at Muslims that kept the applause muted. Rajnath also betrayed a lack of perspective and an inability to construct a political argument.

 Advani towered over all. He was brief, precise and impressive. The same issues seemed clearer and convincing when Advani explained them.

 Contrasting Rajnath with Advaniji is like comparing a block president with the party head. There is a difference of class, a delegate said.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayees capacity to hold the strands of complex political arguments, too, seemed diminished. In his concluding remarks at the national council meeting, he referred to the BJP throughout as Bharatiya Jana Sangh.

 Even at the public meeting at the end of the session, he kept making the same mistake. The veteran leader seemed more forgetful and repetitive than before.

 The party seems to have little choice now but to turn to Advani not just to advise it but also to lead its campaigns.

 Narendra Modi, who could have posed a real challenge to Advani, is busy trying to rid himself of the riot stain. He has, with some success, cultivated the image of a development man over the past few years, but it would be a while before his journey to the Centre is acceptable to the party or the public.

 Advani has two years to make the most of his chances, unless the Sangh decides otherwise.

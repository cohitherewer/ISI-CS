 Mumbai, Aug. 6: Rakhi shoppers out to make the most of the Sunday before the festival were left fuming as Mumbai was rained out again today.

 I am disappointed and so are my friends who wanted to make use of the day to prepare for Rakhi. The municipal corporation and the rains have spoilt our plans, said Sonali Satpathy, a television producer.

 For the second consecutive day, it poured incessantly in the city, severely disrupting road, rail and air traffic.

 It is a shame. The civic administration is completely non-existent. In Mumbai, time is at a premium and whenever the BMC cant handle the monsoon, the only thing it can do is ask people to stay indoors, said Jaideep Banerjee, a banker.

 Mumbai has no business being the countrys commercial hub with such sordid infrastructure.

 But the weathermen had more bad news for Mumbaikars. Sati Devi, director, Mumbai circle of the Met department, said: The rains are going to continue for another 24 hours in Mumbai, Konkan, Goa and Vidarbha areas of Maharashtra. But this kind of heavy rain is not unusual.

 According to the Met department, 75 mm rain was recorded in Colaba and 115.2 mm in suburban Santa Cruz till 6.30pm today.

 Heavy waterlogging of arterial roads threw traffic out of gear during the day. But it improved later because of able traffic management and diversions by police. Municipal employees worked frenetically to open up clogged waterways and drains.

 It also helped that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation put out an advisory through television and radio networks asking citizens to stay indoors, said Mumbai police commissioner A.N. Roy.

 The main traffic subways of Andheri, Milan, Khar and Dahisar, however, remained submerged, throwing traffic out of gear. There were snarls in Sion and Chembur areas, too.

 While local commuter trains ran 30-45 minutes late, long distance trains, including Mumbai-Howrah Mail, Mumbai-Punjab Mail and Mumbai-Chennai Mail, were hugely delayed.

 Some long-distance trains of Central Railways were cancelled because of waterlogging on the tracks in Kalyan-Thane area, just outside Mumbai.

 Several flights were diverted as visibility was down to 300 metres at the Chhatrapati Shivaji airport. Some flights were delayed by over an hour.

 It rained heavily in Pune, too. The Mula and Muthha rivers flowed above the danger mark. A flood alert was declared after 25,000 cusecs of water was released from the Khadakvasla dam, near the National Defence Academy in Pune.

 At least 15 people died in the state because of the rain, a Maharashtra police spokesman said.

 State chief secretary D. Shankaran said: The situation is grim across the state. Floods in Nanded have marooned 25 villages. The army, navy and air force are helping the local administration.

 In Vidarbha, nearly 15,000 people were evacuated with the help of defence personnel. Eight IAF choppers are involved in evacuating people from Parbhani, Dharashiv, Yavatmal and Nanded districts of Maharashtra.

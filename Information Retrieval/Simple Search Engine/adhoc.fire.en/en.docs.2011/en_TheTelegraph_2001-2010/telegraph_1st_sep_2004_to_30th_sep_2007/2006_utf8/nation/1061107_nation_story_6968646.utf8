 Congress snubs Left over Saddam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Congress today kept up its cautious posture on Saddam Husseins death sentence, rejecting outright the Lefts demand that New Delhi should seek a revocation of the Iraq tribunals verdict.

 We do not agree with the notion of rescinding the verdict. There is no question of interfering in matters like this. It is another country. We do not agree on that, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.

 He dismissed charges that India was buckling under US pressure, saying: I deny any such suggestion and insinuation. There is no question of toeing this or that (line).

 The CPM had yesterday termed the verdict as rigged and asked the Centre to try and get it rescinded. But the government had issued a cautious statement, merely stressing that such life-and-death decisions require credible, due process of law and leaving unsaid whether the judgment met those requirements.

 Singhvi toed the same line today, saying: The appellate body must carefully scrutinise the tribunals verdict in order to settle the doubts raised over the credibility of the judicial process there.

 The Left continued to pile pressure. The Government of India has been very mild in its initial reaction. It must now come out with an outright rejection of the tribunals verdict and demand that the death sentence be cancelled, the CPI said.

 The Congresss ambiguous stand gave the Samajwadi Party an opportunity to brand it anti-Muslim in relation not only to Saddam but also to minority welfare. Having anxiously watched the Congresss attempts to woo Muslim voters by announcing a series of welfare measures in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh polls, the party today tried to squeeze the maximum juice out of the Iraq situation.

 It accused the Centre of yielding to US pressure while shedding crocodile tears over the continuing backwardness of minorities in the country.

 Both the Congress and the government it leads are working under the pressure of the US, which has been constantly attacking Muslims all over the world. The recent concern expressed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding the socio-economic backwardness of Muslims is nothing more than shedding crocodile tears, Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh told reporters.

 He alleged that the Congress-led UPA government is not honest towards the minorities and may even dump the Sachar committee recommendations (on the status of minorities in the country).

 Amar demanded that the Congress and the government take a clear-cut stand on the death sentence awarded to Saddam and the US-led attack on Muslims throughout the world.

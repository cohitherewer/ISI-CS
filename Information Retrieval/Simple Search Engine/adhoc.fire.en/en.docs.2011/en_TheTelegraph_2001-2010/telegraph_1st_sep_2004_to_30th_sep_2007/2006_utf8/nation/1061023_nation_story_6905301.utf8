 Aam aadmi ads on a roll

 ASHWANI TALWAR

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: Plugging anything from condoms to the virtues of filing tax returns on time, there have been more government ads this year on television. A two-and-a-half-fold jump from last year, by one count.

 This is according to AdEx India, an arm of the television ratings agency TAM Media Research, which compared government commercials on television between January and August this year with the same period last year.

 There has been no controversy about the ad spending, though, unlike when the NDA had splurged on its India Shining ads in the run-up to the 2004 polls. The reason is that the subjects of the ads and the target audience have been different.

 The UPA government and its agencies have paid more attention to the rural aam aadmi. This year, ad-seconds in the rural development segment rose 44 times.

 There were big increases also in commercials related to education, health and family welfare, and environment awareness: each category grew seven-fold. Advertisements on government job schemes went up six-fold.

 Rural development saw the biggest increase in ads in January-August this year compared with the same months last year, but health-related commercials got the biggest chunk of TV time bought by government agencies.

 Together, the two categories of health awareness and health/family welfare accounted for 53 per cent of the government ad volume between January and August 2006. 

 Education cornered the third spot with a 12 per cent share. A tenth of all government ads was related to income-tax returns. Agriculture-related information got 5 per cent.

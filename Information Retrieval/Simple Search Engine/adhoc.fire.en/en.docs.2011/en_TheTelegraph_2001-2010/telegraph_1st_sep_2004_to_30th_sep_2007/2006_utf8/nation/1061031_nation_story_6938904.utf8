 Hizb chief right hand shot dead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Oct. 30: A close associate of Hizb-ul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahauddin was killed in an encounter in Doda today.

 The outfits divisional commander, Noor Mohammad alias Javed Burki, was shot dead after a two-hour gun battle, police said.

 Syed Salahauddin has lost his right-hand man, Doda superintendent of police Manohar Singh said.

 Sources said Mohammad had crossed over to occupied Kashmir in 1992 and lived with Salahuddin for seven years. Mohammad honed his motivating skills there and returned to Doda to recruit young men for training across the border.

 Over the years, the Hizb-ul Mujahideen has built a strong presence in Doda. The area is a favourite haunt of militants because of its caves in which they can hide for months.

 The police were on Mohammads trail for months. When the hideout was tracked down, Mohammad opened fire, Singh said. He kept fighting for more than two hours before the police were able to kill him.

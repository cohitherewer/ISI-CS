 Infosys promise to Karunanidhi

 Bangalore: It just took a whirlwind visit by Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi to Infosyss showpiece Bangalore complex for the software giant to commit a mindboggling Rs 1,250 crore to expand its operations in Chennai, reports our special correspondent.

 Karunanidhi, along with Union communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran, also visited Wipro, which also spelt out its plans but did not put anything down on paper.

Asked if he sought investments from the two top IT companies in 

Chennai, the chief minister replied: That is why I have come here.

 Infosys director T.V. Mohandas Pai said the companys largest campus was coming up at Mahindra City in Chennai on a 125-acre plot. We have impressed upon Karunanidhi that we will generate 25,000 jobs in Mahindra City over the next three-four years. Already, around 3,500 people work with Infosys in Chennai. This year, we will hire 5,000 more there, he said.

 Staines widow on Orissa visit

Bhubaneswar: Gladys Staines, widow of slain Australian missionary

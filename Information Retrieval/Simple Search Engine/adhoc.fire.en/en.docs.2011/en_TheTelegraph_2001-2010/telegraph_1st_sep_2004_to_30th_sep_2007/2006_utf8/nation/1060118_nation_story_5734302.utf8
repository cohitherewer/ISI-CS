 In season of protests, parties plot kings safe exit

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Kathmandu, Jan. 17: It is the onset of Andolan ka mausam in Nepal ? the season for agitations and mass movements. 

 The season begins in early February and lasts till summer. The democratic movement of 1951, the students movement of 1970, the 1978 referendum and 1990 movement for democracy, all took place during this period.

 I would say the protest season begins from Phagun 7 or February 12, traditionally celebrated as Democracy Day. This is when schools and colleges re-open after winter vacations and the harvesting season is over. The peasants and other land-based people are free during this period. This indeed is Andolan ka mausam in which historical events have taken place in Nepal, said Hari Sharma, director of Social Science, Baha, and a political analyst.

 The political parties are already attracting large crowds ? over a lakh turned up at Janakpur to hear the leaders of the seven-party alliance for democracy on January 12.

 The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) or UML and the Nepali Congress have organised protest rallies where between 50,000 and a lakh people have turned up, although UMLs rallies have been clearly larger.

 Now all eyes are on January 20 when the political parties are planning to defy the ban imposed by King Gyanendra on protests in the capital.

 Gagan Thapa, former general secretary of the Nepal Students Union, being tried for sedition but now out on bail, has been touring the rural areas. 

 I found thousands of people coming to public meetings even in remote villages. And they are not party cadre. People have decided to go with the political parties even though they have problems with old leadership.

 There are others, however, who feel that the parties are not doing enough to mobilise the masses. If the Nepali Congress and the UML want to shut down the administration, they can do so in five days. But it would seem that they still want to put pressure on the king, claimed Professor Lokraj Baral, an eminent social scientist.

 Girija Prasad Koirala, president of the Nepali Congress, denies this charge. Why should I want to hold back this movement? I know that time is not on my side so I want the movement to succeed as quickly as possible, said the 84-year-old leader who has consistently refused to endorse King Gyanendras unconstitutional acts.

 Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the UML, also denies the charge.

 It is ridiculous to suggest that we are not doing enough. The crowds are beyond our expectations. But we also have to see how prepared the people are and pace ourselves accordingly. From holding rallies outside prohibited areas, we are already moving into the prohibited areas. Next we will go for civil disobedience. Dont forget that we have a long experience of launching mass movements. Be patient and wait for a few weeks, he said with a smile.

 As for putting pressure on the king to negotiate, Koirala claimed: The time for reconciliation with the king is over. 

 Why then had he been credited with saying that if the municipal elections were postponed, he would talk to the king? Koirala denied this saying: I only said that the talks with the Maoists have injected a new optimism in the masses.

 If elections are not held now then we can bring the Maoists into a democratic framework.

 Madhav Nepal also ruled out any negotiations with the king. I dont see the seven-party alliance holding an olive branch to the king. There will be no more dialogue with this autocratic monarchy, he said.

 That there is little possibility of negotiation with the king was also pointed out by Laxman Basnet, president of Nepal Trade Union Congress.

 The king is in a narrow one-way tunnel. He cannot turn back. The only negotiation now will be about his safe exit.

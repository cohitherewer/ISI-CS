 Bachchan advised hernia surgery

Mumbai, Jan. 31: A red skull cap covering his head and a shawl wrapped around his lanky frame, a slightly stooped Amitabh Bachchan took the backseat as his son drove him out of Nanavati Hospital around 2 am today.

 The actor, recuperating from an intestinal surgery for diverticulitis, arrived at the high-profile Mumbai hospital in an ambulance around 11 pm last night.

 Sources said the 64-year-old superstar was accompanied by his family ? wife Jaya, son Abhishek and daughter Shweta. They were followed by Anil and Tina Ambani and Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh.

 A hospital technician attending to the actor said: He was not admitted but came for an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. 

 It is believed that Bachchan has a hernia that was detected by doctors during his intestinal surgery in Lilavati Hospital. He was advised to undergo surgery once he recuperates. 

 Hernia is generally not life-threatening. One can live with it for years. Surgery becomes necessary only if there is acute pain, said Dr Suresh Rao of the Association of Medical Consultants. 

 A senior doctor at Nanavati Hospital said: Bachchan seems to have been in some discomfort and his family did not want to take a chance in the light of his sensitive post-operative condition. So they rushed him to Nanavati. 

 The hospital is, however, wary of the media after a senior doctor in Lilavati Hospital was reportedly told to leave after he spoke to journalists after the November surgery. 

 Although the actor has been under the care of Lilavati Hospital for over a month, he has had the MRI scan done at Nanavati Hospital.

 Bachchan has not worked since he was discharged from Lilavati on December 17. Doctors say he could take up to six months to get back to work.

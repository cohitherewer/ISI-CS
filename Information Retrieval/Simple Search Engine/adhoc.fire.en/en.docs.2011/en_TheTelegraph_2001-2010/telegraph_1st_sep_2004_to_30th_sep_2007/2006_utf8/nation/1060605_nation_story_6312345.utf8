 SA steel cry

 Durban, June 4 (PTI): A small Indian-origin community in the town of Richards Bay, on the east coast of South Africa, has joined others in opposing the setting up of a smelting plant near their residential area by Tata Steel. 

 The residents of Brackenham who live close to the proposed 650 million rand (about $104 million) ferrochrome smelter, say emissions from the plant could pose a health hazard. 

 They have joined organisations such as the Clean Air Association of Richards Bay and Groundwork in filing objections to the department of environmental affairs and the provincial government.

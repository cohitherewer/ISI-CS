 Kandahar comes up as Afzal waits

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: With the mercy petition holding up the hanging of Mohammad Afzal, the Centre is factoring in the possibility of a hijack attempt or some spectacular sabotage act by terrorists to secure his release.

 Afzal, found guilty in the Parliament attack case, was to be hanged to death on October 20. But this has now been put off as his family has appealed to the President for clemency.

 Senior home ministry officials said there are intelligence inputs that terrorist groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad of which Afzal was a member and Lashkar-e-Toiba could try to hijack a plane or even hold the passengers of a train or a metro hostage to secure his release.

 Asked if this was a reason for stepping up CISF security and putting 13 airports Delhi, Varanasi, Allahabad, Calcutta, Lucknow, Patna, Gaya, Guwahati, Amritsar, Bagdogra, Chandigarh, Shimla and Bhuntar on high alert, a senior CISF official said all these inputs were factored in. 

 The December 1999 hijack of flight IC-814 to Kandahar when Delhi freed three terrorists, including Maulana Masood Azhar, who later founded Jaish, to secure the safe release of the passengers is at the back of the Centres mind. 

 However, others believe that the Centres fears are far-fetched and that the militants would rather have Afzal die a martyr as this would induce thousands of Kashmiri youths to join them.

 Sitting on the dharna to show solidarity for Afzals release, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Yasin Malik said yesterday that hanging Afzal would send a very strong message to the Kashmiris that they are being persecuted by Delhi. This would result in a whole brigade of gun-wielding youths.

 Giving his own example, Malik said Maqbool Butts hanging in 1984 was perhaps the most important reason that made him and 50,000 others like him to take up arms and wage a war. 

 Some officials within the home ministry, though a minority, believe in Maliks view. 

 Afzal is not a big fish like Masood Azhar for whom terrorists had risked a hijack. But they would definitely like to take advantage of the situation if he is hanged, an official said.

 Mika hides from kissing heat

on molestation charges following item girl Rakhi Sawants complaint, 

has gone into hiding. 

 Police, however, said his lawyer has approached them with a bail plea.

 Rakhi, who had been charged with obscenity at a police fund-raising show in western Maharashtra, alleged on Sunday that Mika forcibly kissed her at his birthday party at a suburban restaurant on Saturday night.

 I asked him (lawyer) to produce Mika before police first, then we will decide whether to grant him bail or not, additional police commissioner (west) Bipin Bihari said.

 He added that according to the polices information Mika, who is Daler Mehendis brother, was hiding somewhere in Mumbai to evade arrest.

 Salem lawyer to tap Lisbon

Mumbai (PTI): Alleging that India has violated the extradition 

treaty with Portugal for securing Abu Salems custody, his lawyer said he 

would seek the permission of the gangster to file a case in Lisbon urging for 

his recall.

 The legal course open to Salem for the alleged violations is to appeal for a recall before a Portugal court, said his lawyer Ashok Sarogi. We shall meet Salem in jail and seek instructions from him to proceed in the matter.

 We have documents to prove that the CBI and Mumbai police had violated the extradition conditions, he added.

 ECs profit notice to CPM duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 21: The Election Commission has asked two CPM MPs to reply by July 7 to notices issued following a Trinamul Congress petition accusing them of holding offices of profit.

 Sources said the notices were served on Lok Sabha MPs Bansagopal Chowdhury and Lakshman Seth only after the panel was convinced about the merit of the charges. 

 Chowdhury is the chair- man of the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority and Seth the head of the Hadial Development Authority.

 Petitions seeking disqualification of eight other CPM MPs, including Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, are pending with the poll panel. 

 The others accused of holding offices of profit include Mohammad Salim, Hannan Mollah, Amitava Nandi, Sudhanshu Sil, Tarit Baran Topdar and Sujan Chakraborty.

 The commission, sources said, is likely to close the case pertaining to CPM leader Nilotpal Basu, whose term in the Rajya Sabha has ended.

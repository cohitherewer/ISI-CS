 Malegaon, Sept. 11: Shafiq Ahmads outburst before Sonia Gandhi has borne fruit: blast-scarred Malegaon will have its hospital.

 You had promised a civil hospital here but it never came up, Shafiq, who lost his son in Fridays blasts, had told the Congress president as he handed her back the compensation cheque of Rs 1 lakh on Saturday.

 If the administration arrests the culprits in 24 hours, he had added defiantly, I will give you Rs 10 lakh.

 The bombers may not have been caught but 48 hours on, the state government has sanctioned the hospital after having delayed it for five years.

 Congress chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, who was seated next to Sonia when she faced the embarrassing moment, called an urgent meeting this morning to clear the plan.

 It had been Deshmukh, not Sonia, who had promised the hospital in 2001 after Malegaon was shaken by a five-day riot. The hospital will have 200 beds, will cost Rs 17 crore and is expected to open in 18 months.

 Most residents were happy but some were still sceptical. It will be very good for Malegaon, but its been a long wait. Lets see if they keep their promise this time, said Mohammed Idris.

 Better late than never, said Shakeel Ahmed, who lost his son in the blasts.

 Many residents had alleged that lack of medical care had raised the toll of Fridays twin blasts, many of whose victims were women and children. In the absence of a government hospital in Malegaon, even those with critical injuries had to be taken to Dhule, 51 km away.

 Sometime ago, a victim of police firing had to be moved to Mumbai, 260 km away, because he needed surgery.

 The government wanted 10 acres of land to build the hospital. Now we have a plot in Kallu Shah Baba Darga which is of 11 acres, Congress MLA Rashid told reporters.

 He said nine acres would be cleared by September 28 and a no-objection certificate would be obtained from the irrigation department. Tenders would be issued soon after that.

 This location is ideal because it lies between the dwellings of the Hindu and Muslim communities on either side of the river Mausam, Rashid said. He claimed that there were plans to build a bridge to ease movement to the hospital.

 State BJP chief Nitin Gadkari said: Vilasrao has sanctioned the hospital primarily because Sonia Gandhi had to face an embarrassment. His government is not serious about development issues.

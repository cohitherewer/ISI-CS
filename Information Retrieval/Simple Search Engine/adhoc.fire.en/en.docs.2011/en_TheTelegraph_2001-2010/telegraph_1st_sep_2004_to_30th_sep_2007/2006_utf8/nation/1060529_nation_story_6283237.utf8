 Kalyan favourite in land grab row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Kusum: Resort trouble

 Lucknow, May 28: The woman who cost Kalyan Singh his chief ministers chair is back in the limelight, accused of harassing backward caste farmers in Mulayam Singh Yadavs backyard.

 BJP lawmaker Kusum Rai has grabbed farmers land for a resort she has set up 8 km from Lucknow, the state backward classes commission was told recently. Farmers who resisted were arrested in false theft cases, the complaint added.

 Kusum, a member of the legislative council ? the Upper House in the state ? virtually ran a parallel power centre during Kalyans tenure as chief minister in the late 90s. The BJP sacked Kalyan after he ignored repeated warnings to keep his friendship with her discreet.

 Kusum walked out of the party with Kalyan, and became state PWD minister in 2003 when their Rashtriya Kranti Party joined the Mulayam government. 

 After Kalyan merged the party with the BJP in February 2004, she continued to wield clout in the BJP.

 Kusum and her husband Rajesh Rai, a state information directorate official, had chosen Noorour Behta village five years ago to build their resort, Dream Valley. Some of the farmers handed over their land at Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 a bigha, but others claimed their well-irrigated plots were worth Rs 45,000-50,000 a bigha.

 I and some others put our foot down as our land is all we have, said Brahma Ram, a backward-class farmer. He alleged that the couple then built a fence around the resort cutting through their land.

 Devidayal Ram, another farmer, said the Rais blocked the irrigation channels, too. When the farmers protested, they were allegedly detained by police on false theft charges for weeks in 2004. The farmers say they had submitted a petition to the district magistrate but it didnt help.

 The chairman of the commission, Jagannath Rai, has directed the Lucknow district administration to see that the farmers were not robbed of their land. The local tehsildar, R.S. Pathak, has promised to the chairman to remove the encroachments.

 Kusums husband says he is shocked by the allegations. We arent harassing them; its they who have been harassing us and trying to blackmail us into paying a higher price for their land.

 He claimed that the subdivisional magistrate, Manoj Rai, had probed the allegations earlier this year but found them baseless.

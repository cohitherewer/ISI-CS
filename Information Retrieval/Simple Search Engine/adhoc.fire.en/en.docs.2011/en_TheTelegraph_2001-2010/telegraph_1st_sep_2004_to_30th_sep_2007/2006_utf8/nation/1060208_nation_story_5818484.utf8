 Witness skips Salman trial

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: The Bandra metropolitan court hearing the Salman Khan hit-and-run case has issued a non-bailable warrant against the actors former bodyguard Ravindra Patil, a crucial witness, who failed to appear in court today.

 Patils cross-examination began on Saturday and continued yesterday. It was to continue today. 

 This is the third time a warrant has been slapped on him. In June 2005, a non-bailable warrant was issued when Patil failed to attend hearings. On June 16, he surfaced and said he had received death threats. He was also sent to jail for a day for not obeying the courts orders.

 When trial began four months ago, Patil went missing again and was summoned with a bailable warrant. Patil then appeared for cross-examination by Salmans lawyer Dipesh Mehta on Saturday.

 Showing newspaper clippings, Mehta grilled the police constable on an interview he had given to a city tabloid on September 29, 2002, a day after the actors Toyota Land Cruiser ran over bakery employees sleeping on a Bandra pavement, killing one of them.

 In his interview, Patil had claimed that Salman was not drunk while driving. 

 Patil, who is also a complainant in this case, merely reported the accident in the FIR on September 28. He did not mention Salmans rash driving or the actor being drunk. But in the second statement recorded after the charge of culpable homicide was slapped on Salman, Patil told the police that the actor was drunk and that he cautioned him not to drive fast.

 Actor taxi hits girl

 A taxi in which Salman Khan was travelling today hit a teenaged girl near Bhandara, close to Nagpur. She suffered minor injuries and was admitted to a hospital. 

 The actor had gone to attend the birth centenary of Manohar Bhai Patel, father of civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

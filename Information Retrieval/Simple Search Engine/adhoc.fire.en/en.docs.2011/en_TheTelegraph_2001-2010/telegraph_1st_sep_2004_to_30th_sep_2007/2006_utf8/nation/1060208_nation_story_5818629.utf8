 Punjab caste wall to evict dwellers comes crumbling down

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Feb. 7: The Germans had their Berlin Wall, the Chinese still have their Great Wall, and the Punjabis came close to claiming their own.

 It didnt survive long enough.

 Late last night, parts of the 10-foot-high wall that civic authorities in Fazilka, Ferozepur, had built without an opening around 20 dwellings of the lower-caste Muslim Gujjars, cutting them off from the rest of the world, were broken down.

 The wall had come up three months ago to force the dwellers to sell their land so that a bus stand could be built by a private organisation.

 We have made two openings in the wall. The rest will be demolished soon, said SSP S.S. Srivastava.

 Allah has finally listened to our prayers and the wall is no more, said Kasim, one of the hemmed-in residents.

 But the past few weeks had been traumatic. To keep home fires burning, the Gujjars, milkmen by profession, had been scaling the wall.

 We were being hounded to sell our land. And when we resisted, the municipal authorities, mostly upper castes, simply built the wall around our dwellings, said Kamal Khan, another resident.

 Over 150 people live in the settlement registered in the names of the Gujjars.

 Khan said the pressure began mounting on them to sell their land following the decision of the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to invite builders from the country and abroad to invest in new colonies. Land prices in the state have skyrocketed since the invitation.

 The Gujjars say they were not allowed to take their cattle out for grazing. 

 How can we take them? When it is not easy to scale the wall, how can we take the animals out? Many have died, said Ali, who was beaten up for resisting the wall when it was being built.

 One person could not bear the wall and has died. We, too, will perish. Can anyone help us? Ali had cried yesterday, before the police cracked open the wall.

 Because of the wall, doctors, too, stopped visiting the settlement. Fearing retribution, the dwellers had been taking their sick outside for treatment only at night.

 With conditions turning unhygienic inside the walled area, the residents also felt it could lead to an epidemic. 

 Where do we go to deposit the filth? How do we take it out? We will be beaten if we trespass on the land owned by others outside the wall and they can even have us arrested, another dweller had said.

 Yesterday, Amarinder had said the wall, which came up unnoticed by the government, would be brought down in a few hours.

 Caution on Reliance retail

 talks of control as CPM voices concern

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: In response to concerns in the CPM, the Bengal government appears to be finetuning the terms under which it is prepared to sign an agreement with Mukesh Ambanis Reliance which wants to source and sell farm products from the state.

 There are two areas where the government is focusing attention. One, if Reliance wants government help in acquiring land to set up collection and distribution centres for farm products, it will set some regulatory controls.

 Two, it is thinking of putting locational restrictions for the supermarkets Reliance will set up for its retail venture, launched last week in Hyderabad as Reliance Fresh.

 Were trying to understand how this business will impact Bengal and whether to go into an agreement with Reliance, said commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen.

 The statement came on a day The Telegraph learnt CPM general secretary Prakash Karat has written a letter to the state party, seeking details about Reliances plan. The letter to Biman Bose, the state secretary, is a reflection of the leaderships apprehensions about the project that covers in its sweep procurement, distribution and retail sales.

 Karats letter is a precursor to the leadership forming a coherent stand on the Reliance plan. 

 Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: The effects of the entry of domestic big business in retail will be fairly similar to FDI (foreign direct investment) presence. Care should be taken to avoid large-scale displacement and unemployment of the people already engaged in retail marketing.

 The CPM is opposed to FDI in retail, which is not allowed under law, but theres no bar on domestic corporate investment. 

 As if echoing Yechurys concern, the Bengal government said: We have decided that it (retail outlets) should be located outside the city limits. Unless it is done, it will hurt small businesses and the unorganised sector.

 Sen said the government was studying the examples of America and the more recent instances in China and Malaysia where supermarkets are now being located outside the city.

 Reliance is free to set up this business without government help, but it has sought assistance in setting up the collection and distribution centres for which the company will need to acquire land.

 If the government decides to go into an agreement with the company, it will lay a series of regulatory clauses.

 Sen said: The business will be attractive to us only if we find theyre protecting the farmers prices. If we decide to go ahead, we will have a limited start probably one or two stores. There will be a provision for a review every few months and a pullback clause, enabling us to withdraw if we find that the system is not benefiting farmers.

 In the backdrop lies the CPMs dilemma over the stand to take on domestic big business entering retail because other than the colour of the money theres nothing to separate it from the likes of Wal-Mart. Its feared impact is also the same: death of neighbourhood grocers.

 The other concern the party, guiding it in pressing for a closer look at Reliances proposal, has is the possibility of a monopoly situation where the Ambani company is the sole organised bidder for farmers produce.

 Therefore, competition so utterly smelling of the animal called the market that the CPM is suspicious of is the answer, other than the government playing a role to ensure a fair relationship between the procurer and the farmer.

 A related question troubling the party is whether or not the government should actively encourage what some leaders call the entry of big capital in retail.

 Bengal leader and central committee member Benoy Konar explained: We cannot oppose entry of big business in retail. But the question is whether the state government should sponsor and facilitate the entry of big capital.

 In an editorial, Ganashakti, the partys Bengali mouthpiece, has opposed the retail entry of Reliance, ITC and the Bharti group of Airtel, indicating the policy dilemma and perhaps signalling to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee not to rush into an agreement with Reliance.

 As the farm marketing network is in a sorry state, it might have suited the government to let Reliance step in. But the party has flashed amber.

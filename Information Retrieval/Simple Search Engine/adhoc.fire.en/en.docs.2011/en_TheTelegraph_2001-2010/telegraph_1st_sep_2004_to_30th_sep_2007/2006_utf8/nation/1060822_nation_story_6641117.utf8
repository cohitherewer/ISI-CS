 Airports

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: The Centre today lifted the ban on visitors entering airports, reports our special correspondent.

 The curb had been imposed after the July 11 bombings in Mumbais trains. Security was made stricter after a plot to bomb 10 planes flying between London and the US was uncovered.

 With August 15 over, intelligence agencies have told us that threat levels have gone down. But they would like us to remain alert. So other security precautions that we introduced after the serial bombing of trains in Mumbai last month and the London plot will remain intact, said a civil aviation ministry official. 

 Visitors at Calcuttas international 

 airport were allowed in since noon today.

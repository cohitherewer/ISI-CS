 Scientists stress N-squeeze plot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: Top scientists who had expressed concern over the Indo-US nuclear deal today stuck to their position that the bill passed by the US Congress retains objectionable clauses and asked the government to convey this to the US administration.

 After a meeting with atomic energy officials, the former nuclear scientists said the bill, renamed the Hyde Act of 2006, denies full nuclear cooperation with India, contains clauses that will force India to cap its weapons programme and has no nuclear fuel supply assurances.

 India must not directly or indirectly concede our right to conduct future nuclear weapon tests, if these are found necessary to strengthen our minimum deterrence, the seven scientists said in a statement. 

 The act makes it explicit that if India conducts tests, nuclear cooperation will be terminated and we will be required to return all equipment and materials we might have received under the deal, it said. 

 Why talk about Indias strategic programme at all if this is truly a civilian nuclear deal? one of the scientists told The Telegraph. The intention is clear its to squeeze and cap our strategic programme.

 The scientists have argued that having imported commercial nuclear reactors and fuel at huge costs, India will be under constant pressure never to test at all. Any future nuclear test will result in heavy economic losses to the country because of the inability to continue the operation of all such imported reactors, they said.

 The scientists said the act envisages India to participate with the US in a programme to further nuclear non-proliferation goals. This... has been unilaterally introduced apparently without the knowledge of the Indian government.

 According to the scientists, the act retains many of the clauses on which the Prime Minister had clearly put forth his objections and clarified the Indian position in both Houses of Parliament.

 Once the act is signed into law, all further bilateral agreements with the US will have to be consistent with the law.

 Rules relaxed to make passports faster amp; easier to get

 New Delhi, Dec. 28 (PTI): Passports under the Tatkaal scheme can now be obtained in seven days instead of the 10 days at present with the government relaxing guidelines to cut delays.

 To receive the passport within seven days, an applicant will have to pay Rs 2,500. Under the Tatkaal scheme, applicants also have the option of obtaining a passport within 14 days on payment of Rs 2,000.

 Re-issuance of passports under Tatkaal will be done in three working days, instead of five. The charge will stay the same at Rs 2,500.

 No police verification will be necessary for re-issuance of passports if there is no negative indication with the passport issuing authority.

 The government has also relaxed rules for obtaining verification certificates under the Tatkaal scheme by extending the authorisation powers to under-secretaries, tehsildars and station house officers. So far, officers of the rank of deputy secretary or above could issue the certificate.

 The list will also include sub-divisional magistrates, first class judicial magistrates and officers of the level of Major in the armed forces. 

 Passports can also be obtained under Tatkaal on post-police verification basis, if any three out of 14 documents, including one with photo I-card, are submitted. The documents include voters photo identity card, ration card, driving licence, PAN card, property documents such as pattas or registered deeds, pension documents, railway identification card, bank/kisan/post office passbooks, student I-card issued by a recognised institution, service I-cards issued by state/central governments, public sector undertakings, local bodies or public limited companies, SC/ST/OBC certificates and freedom fighter I-cards.

 The eligibility criterion for emigration check not required stamping (ECNR) will hereafter be matriculation rather than graduation.

 Employees in government service and PSUs and their immediate family members (only wife and dependent children) can get passports if their identity is certified by the head of department or head of the PSU concerned.

 Chairmen of Ficci, CII and Assocham will be able to issue verification certificates for owners, partners or directors of companies that are members of the business organisation concerned.

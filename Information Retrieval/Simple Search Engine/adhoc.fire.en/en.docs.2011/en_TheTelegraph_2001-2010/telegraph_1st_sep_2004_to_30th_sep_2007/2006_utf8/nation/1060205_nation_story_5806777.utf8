The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pat for poverty fight, prick at investment

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Feb. 4: India is doing well in the battle against poverty but needs more investment, both private and government, in public health, education and basic infrastructure.

 The advice comes from Jeffrey David Sachs, special adviser to the UN secretary-general and director of Columbia Universitys The Earth Institute.

 The economist, known best for his views on sustainable development, spoke on Challenges for the UN and Global Society at the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit 2006, organised by The Energy Research Institute in the capital earlier this week.

 Were not sustainable right now, Sachs said. By 2050, 2.5 billion people will be added to the population and we need to quadruple economic activities to support that.

 He felt the two major achievable and pressing tasks for the world are breaking the poverty trap ? achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and ending poverty by 2025 ? and absorbing a huge increase in population and economic activity while protecting global ecosystems. Both are possible but were not on track on either, he warned.

 India, he said, was well on its way to end extreme poverty, but would require public policy, smart business and government planning to achieve the goal.

 The progress in India is quite dramatic, Sachs told The Telegraph after his speech. But the major public challenge is in investment in key development areas. Obviously the investment will be a mix of both private and government. But Im looking at a new source... maybe the international community can come forward and help.

 Public health, education and basic infrastructure management are the areas which need investment in India, Sachs felt. With the high fertility rates, the lack of womens empowerment and access to family planning are also a worry.

 But a lot of what India has achieved is because of the Green Revolution, he said. Imagine what would happen to India if there was no Green Revolution in the mid-60s. Thats what has happened to Africa.

 Too much privatisation, not too little of it, he felt, was devastating for it. But the good news for Africa, the epicentre of the challenge, is that the potential for a green revolution exists.

 Energy is another major area of global concern. The good news is that were running out of oil but not fossil fuel. But the bad news is that if we put all that carbon in the air, the ecosystem will be wrecked. Indias challenge is to convert coal to other energies like gas and oil and make it safe for the world.

 On the MDGs, Sachs felt that the biggest problem is not in countries sharing a set of goals but in meeting them.

 The three-day seminar saw a host of international political leaders, corporate honchos and economists discuss sustainable development.

 Modi magic wanes, Congress crows

 Modi: On slippery wicket

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 13: The just-concluded panchayat elections have put a question mark on Narendra Modis capability to win elections on his own steam, worrying his loyalists ahead of next years Assembly polls. 

 Last year, when he had led the campaign, the BJP had decimated the Congress in zila and taluka panchayat elections, bringing down the tally of Congress-dominated districts from 22 to 7.

 But this Sundays panchayat elections, though not fought on the party symbol, have come as a blow to him because he has not been able to repeat the performance, sources said.

 The Congress has begun to crow in victory, claiming most of the elected sarpanchs owe allegiance to it. To assert that it has regained the ground lost last year, it plans to release the names of party-backed sarpanchs elected across the state tomorrow.

 Senior Congress leader J.V. Momen, the partys election in-charge for north Gujarat, claimed that about 90 per cent of Congress-backed candidates have won in Gandhinagar district.

 Of over 10,000 panchayats that had to pick new representatives, 2,870 had opted for Modis samras gram scheme in which entire hamlets agreed to choose representatives through consensus. The rest went in for regular elections.

 Although the BJP is claiming that its support base in rural areas is intact, senior leaders conceded that the partys performance had not been impressive, especially in south Gujarat where the Congress has a clear upper hand. 

 A party insider said: The reason is that the BJP in Gujarat is too dependent on Narendra Modis popularity. And this is a worrying factor. There are chances that grassroots cadre might become complacent, which appears to be the case in the panchayat elections. 

 Asked why the BJP did not do well, party spokesman Yamal Vyas said: Perhaps, we could not sense the mood of the people. But he insisted the BJP had not done as badly as the Congress was claiming. 

 An activist involved with the voters awareness campaign claimed Modis popularity had eroded in rural areas, proof of which was there were few takers for his samras gram scheme. 

 If he was really so popular, why did only 30 per cent villages opt for this scheme which actually amounts to bribing people? The villagers were given all sorts of incentives, yet most of these villages chose to contest elections, he said.

 Sources said the samras scheme had boomeranged on Modi as most candidates chosen by consensus owed allegiance to the Congress. An example is Kheda district, where all sarpanchs were backed by Congress MLA Natwarsing.

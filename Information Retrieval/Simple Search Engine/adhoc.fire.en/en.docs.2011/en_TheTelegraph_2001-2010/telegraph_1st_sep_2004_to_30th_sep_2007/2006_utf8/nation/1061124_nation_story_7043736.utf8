 Mumbai, Nov. 23: 

 Actor Naseeruddin Shahs 20-year-old son Imaaduddin 

 fell off a running train in central Mumbai this morning 

 on his way to college.

 Imaad, as he is known in Mumbais theatre circles, was grievously injured when he fell off the train around 8.50 near Lower Parel station, railway police said. He was taken to Nair Hospital with head injuries and fractures in his legs and hands, and was moved to Hinduja Hospitals intensive care unit after preliminary treatment.

 He is in the ICU, but doctors said he is out of danger. We still dont know what exactly happened because Imaad continues to be unconscious, Naseers secretary Jairaj Patil told The Telegraph.

 The actor, who rushed to the hospital with wife Ratna Pathak-Shah and daughter Heeba, could not be contacted.

 A final-year humanities student at St Xaviers College in south Mumbai, Imaad was travelling alone on a crowded Churchgate-bound train from Bandra. It was not clear how the accident occurred, but police said they suspect he lost his balance. 

 Our first priority was to provide him medical help. We will inquire into it, a railway police official said.

 The younger of Naseers two children from his first marriage, Imaad made his theatre debut at the age of three in Julius Caesar, directed by his father. He took part in workshops conducted by his father under his theatre group Motley before going professional with the Akash Khurana-directed play Once There was a Way in 2004 and the Naseer-directed KathaCollage, based on three stories by Premchand.

 Imaad also starred in Naseers directorial debut, Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota, released this year.

 The accident has brought into focus the death traps that Mumbais suburban trains have become. According to railway police statistics, accidents on the three suburban railway lines killed a total of 3,395 commuters and injured 3,444 between January 1 and October 30 this year.

 We classify accidents into five categories: line-crossing, falling off running trains, dashing against railway poles, falling into the gap between platform and train, and others, said railway police commissioner Suresh Khopade.

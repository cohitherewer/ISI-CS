 Nation at a Glance

 Another lover in Sholay stunt 

 Kanpur (PTI): A 24-year-old lover climbed 

 a water tank and threatened to jump after repeated attempts 

 failed to make his fiancees family agree to their 

 marriage.

 The stunt, reminiscent of a scene from the film Sholay where Veeru (Dharmendra) tries to impress Basantis (Hema Malini) aunt, however, boomeranged as police lodged a case of attempt to suicide against him. 

 Ajay Balmiki was in love with a girl of Kanpurs Kakadeo area and wanted to marry her, senior superintendent of police Alok Singh said. 

 The police eventually brought the girl to the spot and the young man came down when she requested him. Ajay was immediately taken into custody.

 Recently, several jilted lovers in Hyderabad clambered atop water tanks and tall buildings, threatening to jump unless their loved ones rush into their arms.

 Target nilgai, victim man

 Kanpur (PTI): A 65-year-old 

 man was killed after being hit by a stray bullet fired by 

 some people who were allegedly poaching a nilgai in a village 

 near here.

 Four persons Anwar Ahmed, Mahmood Ahmed, Sajid and Mati Ahmed who went to Ashrafpur village on Sunday night to hunt the protected antelope have been arrested.

 Police said the suspected poachers shot at the nilgai but the bullet hit Chhotelal, who has agricultural land in the area. He died on the spot. The four have been held on the charge of attempt to murder, the police said. 

 The nilgai, a species of Indian antelope with a bluish coat, is listed in the protected schedule of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

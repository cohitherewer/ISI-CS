 Bengal imam in terror net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 14: An imam from Bengal was arrested today by the anti-terrorist squad from Haj House here in a follow-up to the arrest of three alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba militants recently. 

 Forty-four-year-old Maulana Ghulam Yahya Allah Baksh, from North 24- Parganas district, was arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, and produced in a local court that remanded him in police custody till January 24.

 What has shocked police is that Haj House is a well-known Muslim institution, which assists pilgrims visiting Mecca and Medina. It is located just a few yards from the Mumbai police commissionerate at Crawford Market.

 On January 7, the anti-terrorist squad busted a suspected Lashkar module, arresting Arshad Badru from Sopore, Khurshid Ahmed Lone and Haji Ahmed Ramzan.

 Badru is an elected National Conference municipal councillor in Bandipore and the brother-in-law of the late Hizb-ul Mujahideen commander Abdul Majid Dar. His alleged involvement with terrorists has shocked his family of cloth traders.

 Lone was found to be an active member of the Lashkar and was wanted in a bomb blast and a Srinagar bank robbery. 

 Ramzan, 52, worked as a contractor in Bandipore in Baramulla and is also a financial conduit of the Lashkar, the police believe.

 The police claimed they had seized bomb-making material from the three, including a .32 bore foreign pistol, 20 detonators, five electrical circuits and five timer switches. 

 The probe has also revealed that Lone aided the Lashkar in transporting militant groups.

 The police arrested Allah Baksh after the Kashmiris told the interrogators that the maulana had helped them find shelter.

 The anti-terrorist squad said Allah Baksh had been working with the Haj House mosque in south Mumbai for the last nine years and had assisted the trio in hiding arms and explosives they were carrying. 

 Producing him in court, the squad said Allah Baksh knew about the unlawful activities of the alleged militants.

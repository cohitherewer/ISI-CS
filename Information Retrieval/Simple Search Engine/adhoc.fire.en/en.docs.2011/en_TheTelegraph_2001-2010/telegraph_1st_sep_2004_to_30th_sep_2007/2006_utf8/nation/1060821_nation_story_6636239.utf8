 Fairy-tale ending for Bollywood in Britain

 London, Aug. 20: For years, its colourful song and dance routines and improbable storylines were merely a source of amusement for British cinemagoers. But now, for the first time, Bollywood films are more successful in Britain than home-grown productions.

 A record 74 Indian films were released in the UK in 2005, compared with just 61 British productions. During the last 12 months, nine Bollywood films have entered the top 10 list of films compared with just seven British ones.

 Bollywood films to achieve success in Britain include Garam Masala, a romantic comedy, which took 292,033 in its opening weekend, the science fiction epic Krrish, which made 210,499 during the same period, and the drama Dosti: Friends Forever, which entered the UK box office chart at No. 5 after grossing 146,069 in its opening weekend.

 Each of the three films have now grossed around 1 million. Almost one in six of all films released in Britain last year (16 per cent) were in Hindi while Bollywood produced 11 of the 20 most successful foreign-language films released in the UK in 2005.

 The unprecedented level of commercial success has been fuelled by a new generation of young British Asians whose appetite for Indian films means that three of Britains biggest cinema chains, Cineworld, Vue and UCI, now routinely screen Hindi films.

 Bobby Bedi, the Bollywood producer behind cinema successes including The Rising and Bandit Queen, said: Young British Asians have more money than they have ever had and they are going out more than they used to. These films are now showing at multiplexes as opposed to sub-standard venues which used to be the case.

 Bedi said the Bollywood films, all of which were subtitled, had developed a far broader appeal than just the Indian community.

 Attributing the box-office success to the distinctive character of Bollywood, he added: Television programmes like The Kumars At No. 42 mean non-Asian audiences are more familiar with India. They are much more willing to engage with Indian movies.

Although Indian films have become more successful, they have not changed in character. No one is looking to Bollywood to make The Full Monty.

 Successful Bollywood films can now expect to make more than 2 million at the British box office and, despite expensive publicity drives and all-star casts, a number of high-profile British productions have been eclipsed by Indian films.

 For example, Fanaa, a romantic drama, took more than 300,000 in its opening weekend while The Libertine, starring Johnny Depp, took 278,000 over the same period. So far Fanaa has taken a total of 1,176,000, almost double that earned by The Libertine.

 The success of Indian films has encouraged some British-based Indian directors to experiment with the traditional genre of Bollywood films.

 Last year, Gurinder Chadha, who directed Bend It Like Beckham, topped the UK charts with Bride and Prejudice, her Bollywood take on the Jane Austen novel. Michael Gubbins, the editor of Screen International, predicted further success for Bollywood films if producers and directors continued to adapt their work to local tastes.

 A lot of British-based directors of Indian origin are beginning to look at how the genre could develop in future, he said.

 Everyone thinks Indian food is popular, but what the British eat isnt really Indian food. So what we are waiting for is the chicken tikka masala film... which will match the less exotic tastes of a western audience.

 Don spins Bollywood dream

 SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI

 Abu Salem

 Mumbai, Nov. 11: He was always interested in films, but it has been limited to extortions so far. Now Abu Salem wants to act in one and has got his lawyers wife producing it for him.

 On Monday, his lawyer Ashok Sarogi will file a bail petition at the special Tada (anti-terror) court trying him so that the extradited Mumbai blasts accused can get a 10-day break from Arthur Road Jail to shoot for the movie.

 The films story is based on what else? his own life. Police allege it is financed by him as well.

 The film will be directed by N. Chandra, a friend of the Sarogis and whose first film Ankush was critically acclaimed, but was last heard struggling with B-grade nondescript flicks like Style and Xcuse Me.

 My wife Sarla is producing the film and we had sought permission from the Dubai authorities to let us shoot there, but they did not. But now, Portugal has allowed for parts of the film to be shot there. Salem is expected to star in the movie and we are applying to the Tada court to allow him to shoot for the film, Sarogi said.

 Salem, an accused in the 1993 blasts, was extradited from Portugal last November and is wanted in India for a host of other murders. Recently, he wrote to the Portuguese authorities to recall the extradition alleging police torture.

 The title of the film has not been decided yet but the choice is between Kanoon Ko Badal Dalo and Jazba.

 Sarogi was unwilling to reveal the names of the rest of the cast but said the film would trace the journey of the gangster from Uttar Pradeshs Azamgarh district.

 The film starts from his childhood days and then moves to him turning a politician. If the court doesnt allow Abu to shoot, then we will think of a replacement. The movie will be made on a medium budget and will be completed in just 10 days, Sarogi said.

 Salem is also mulling an alternative career in politics and plans to contest next years elections to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly from Mubarakpur as an Independent.

 The police, however, say it is nothing but a ruse to get out of India. If not films, then it is politics for him. It is all a ploy to get bail and go to Portugal to evade Indian police and courts, said a senior officer.

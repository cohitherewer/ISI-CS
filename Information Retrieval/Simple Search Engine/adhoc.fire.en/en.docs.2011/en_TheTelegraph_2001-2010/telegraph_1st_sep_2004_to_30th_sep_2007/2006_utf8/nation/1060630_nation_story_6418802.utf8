 Farmers hand over 321 acres

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singur, June 29: The process of acquiring land for the small-car unit of Tata Motors at Singur started today with about 324 farmers submitting letters to the block development officer agreeing to give up about 321 acres.

 I have received their (farmers) applications and have informed the higher authorities about it, said BDO Abhijeet Mukherjee.

 We received applications from 324 farmers who are eager to sell off about 321 acres. We have already received assurance from farmers for about 550 acres, said Balai Sabui, a CPM peasant leader in Hooghly.

 The Left Front district committee today organised a rally in front of the BDOs office in Singur, about 50 km from Calcutta, in support of land acquisition for the project. CPM MP from Hooghly Anil Basu, who participated in the rally with party MP Santasree Chatterjee and a large number of MLAs, asked farmers not to cultivate their land this year.

 Dont sow any seed this year. The government will compensate you. The government will calculate the price of your crop and pay you for it, Basu said. He also led a deputation to the BDO demanding adequate compensation for the farmers.

 Yesterday, industries minister Nirupam Sen had assured the CPM peasant wing that the government would avoid multi-crop plots as much as possible and stay away from human settlements while acquiring land at Singur.

 Around 3 pm today, about 1,000 farmers gathered with their family members to attend the rally. Asit Das, a farmer who agreed to give up 10 bighas, said: I am not making much profit by cultivating my 10-bigha plot. I think the governments compensation package is good.

 But Becharam Manna, the convener of the Krishijami Bachao Committee, the farmers body opposing the acquisition of agricultural land for the Tata project, said the CPM had not been able to garner the support of many farmers. 

 Most of those in the crowd were CPM supporters from outside. At most, the CPMs peasant wing has managed to get about 100 acres, he said.

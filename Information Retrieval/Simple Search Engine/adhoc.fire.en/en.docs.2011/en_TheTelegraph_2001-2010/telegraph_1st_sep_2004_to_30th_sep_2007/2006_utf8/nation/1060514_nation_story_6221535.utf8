 Rape victim has last word

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: The statement of a woman alleging she was raped cannot be rejected even if doctors fail to find any sign of rape, the Supreme Court has held.

 It said a rape victims testimony does not require corroboration, and courts must not be swayed by minor contradictions in her statement. If the evidence of the woman inspires confidence, it should be relied upon without seeking corroboration.

 Even if the doctor who examined the victim does not find sign of rape, it is no ground to disbelieve the sole testimony of the prosecutrix (the alleged victim), a bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat said. 

 The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars.

 Ordinarily, a victim of sexual assault would not like to reveal the facts even before her family, let alone the public or the police, the bench said. The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case.

 The court expressed concern at the increase in crimes against women, saying it reflected societys indifference towards victims of sex crimes.

 It suggested that high courts and trial courts, in their judgments, should not name the victims of sexual assault, because they often suffer stigma or ostracism.

 It called on subordinate courts to deal with such cases with the utmost sensitivity because a murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, (but) a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female.

 The courts observations came as it reduced the sentence of a man, convicted of raping a woman who was six months pregnant, from 10 years to seven. The court said it had not been proved that the convict knew she was pregnant.

 Om Prakash had raped the woman in daylight on the verandah of the Hardoi zilla parishad office in Uttar Pradesh.

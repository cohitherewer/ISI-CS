 Steady Sainik trickle to Raj

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: Narayan Ranes supporters had quit the Shiv Sena in a blaze of violence, fighting Uddhav Thackerays men at every shakha where there were defections.

 Raj Thackerays supporters are simply locking up the shakhas, handing over the keys to Uddhav and walking out of the 39-year-old party.

 Two weeks after his tearful exit from the party, Raj (in picture above) said he would not engineer defections but would welcome Shiv Sainiks who wished to join him. And slowly but surely, the Sena rank and file is deserting the party that had been held together by the charisma of Bal Thackeray.

 Since Raj made it clear a week ago that he would form a new party, Sena shakha-pramukhs ? chiefs of the suburban branches spread across Mumbai ? have been resigning one after the other and pledging support for Rajs yet unnamed party.

 Senior Sena leader Madhukar Sarpotdar, who lost to Priya Dutt in the November 19 Lok Sabha bypoll from Mumbai Northwest, has had to watch his son Atul leave the party and join Raj.

 Sena office-bearers are flocking to us virtually every day?. I can tell you that the numbers are growing slowly. We expect it to be a flood when Raj saheb actually begins his state-wide tour from January 16, a key Raj aide said.

 Raj will finalise the new partys agenda after completing his Maharashtra tour in February, an associate said. The announcement will be made at Shivaji Park in March.

 The exodus of disillusioned Sainiks, however, began soon after Ranes expulsion in June 2005, and has continued without a stop.

 Kiran Wadivkar, once a party secretary handling the Sena state headquarters, said: The feeling that people who really do the partys work will never get rewarded made me follow Rane into the Congress. The least anyone who works hard for the party expects is appreciation from the party high command. We never got any.

 The rebellion has put under threat Bal Thackerays control over the work- ers unions he had built so carefully over the years: unions of bank, municipal, hotel and transport staff, as well as of seamen, university teachers, cable operators and hawkers.

 The Sena leadership remained tight-lipped. Subhas Desai, an Uddhav loyalist and publisher of Saamna, said, Im not aware of any resignations. I am outside Mumbai currently. I would not like to comment.

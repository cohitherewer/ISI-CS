 Buddha: Dont step on EC toes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, April 10: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today asked Left Front leaders not to cross the Election Commissions path and abide by all its rules as transport minister Subhas Chakraborty again incurred the poll watchdogs wrath for his comments. 

 We dont want any confrontation with the EC. That is why you should tell your supporters to obey all rules and regulations laid down by the EC, Bhattacharjee told a Left Front meeting at the CPMs Alimuddin Street headquarters.

 The chief minister refused to buy the argument of some front leaders who tried to suggest that the commissions restrictions, being implemented for the first time in the state, might hinder campaigning.

 Nothing doing, we must adhere to EC norms, Bhattacharjee said. 

 Barely a week before the first phase of elections in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore, the front meeting was convened at Bhattacharjees instance to drive home the point that the leadership did not approve of any violation of poll regulations. 

 After the meeting, front leaders said the talks would help clear doubts among the cadre about how to react to restrictions they were not used to. 

 Now, the message is clear that front supporters will strictly follow EC rules, RSP leader and former PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said.

 He admitted that there was some confusion among the supporters, which had deepened after Chakrabortys remark that poll officials were the commissions stooges, inviting an FIR. Unfazed, he went after a section of the police last night over their conduct on election duty, drawing the commissions attention again.

 Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose echoed Bhattacharjee. We will have to go by the rules laid down by the EC. For that, front supporters may have to do what they have not done during previous elections, he said after the meeting.

 Bose said front partners had been told not to get provoked by Opposition parties. Instead, we should all cooperate with the EC to help it conduct free and fair elections. 

 He added that as the commission had directed, every booth near a polling station would remain uncovered on all four sides on the day of the election and only one person would man it.

 Earlier, front supporters used to be present in the booths in large numbers but this time we will have to do away with this practice, he said.

 The leadership told the front members to ensure that voters did not protest if they were asked to show identity cards on polling day. Bose said he had full faith in the electorate, which had voted the front to power six consecutive times. The electorate can do and undo many things. We are leaving it to the peoples court.

 In the 2001 Assembly elections, Bose himself was vocal against commission observers touring the districts. This time not only is he holding the responsible position of the party secretary, but the commission also is a great deal more assertive.

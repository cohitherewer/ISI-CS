 Delhi clears N-deal air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 23: Upset by speculation about the nuclear deal in Washington, Delhi today reiterated that it was committed to a credible minimum deterrent and that the pact would not hinder or enhance its strategic capacity.

 It also said the deal on civil nuclear energy cooperation would have to be based on the commitments incorporated in the Indo-US joint statement of July 18, 2005, and the elements contained in Indias separation plan, submitted to Parliament on March 11 this year.

 Reacting to a report that said India could make 50 nuclear warheads a year, a foreign ministry spokesman regretted the misinformed speculation. The argument that the nuclear deal would enhance Indias strategic capacity is as misplaced as its opposite, that it would cripple its nuclear programme, he said.

 The deal was strictly about civil nuclear energy cooperation and not about Indias strategic programme, he added

 He cited US secretary of state Condoleezza Rices statement in her Congressional testimony that the deal would have no impact on Indias strategic programme.

 Reacting to the remarks of US lawmaker Tom Lantos, a critic of the deal who has warned Delhi against backing Iran at the NAM meet in Cuba in September, he said Senators and Congressmen have expressed different views.

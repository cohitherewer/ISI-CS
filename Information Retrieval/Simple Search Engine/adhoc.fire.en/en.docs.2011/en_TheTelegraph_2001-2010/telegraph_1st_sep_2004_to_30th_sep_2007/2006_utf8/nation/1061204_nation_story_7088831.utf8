 Temple date for Marx minister

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 3: Keralas Marxist home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan may do a Subhas Chakraborty tomorrow evening, though not at a Kali temple.

 Balakrishnan is slated to attend the Chakkulathukavu Devi temple festival in Alappuzha in south Kerala and share the dais with scions of the Chakkulathu Illom (family), which runs the temple. Local NCP legislator Thomas Chandy will attend.

 Temple official Suresh Kavumbhagom justified the ministers decision to attend the festival, saying he was also tourism minister and the temple was listed on the tourism map.

 He has agreed to come unless he is held back by the cabinet meeting on Monday, the official said.

 A local daily has brought out a supplement, prominently announcing Balakrishnans participation.

 The main attraction of the festival is thousands of women lighting roadside hearths with the torch lit by the chief priest, cooking a delicious paste of rice and jaggery and offering it to the goddess for bliss and prosperity.

 The temple has earned the sobriquet of womens Sabarimala since all worshippers on the day of offering, barring priests, are women. But at the actual Sabarimala temple, women between 10 and 50 are kept out in deference to Lord Ayyappa.

 Another highlight of the temple is the Naari puja on December 22, when the chief priest will wash the feet of south Indian singer Vaani Jayaram, the chief guest. Later, he will be assisted by several priests in the ritualistic washing of feet of women devotees.

 Not all women there will be able to participate since the ritual starts at 9 am and closes at 2 pm. Like the main Sabarimala temple, Chakkulathu temple is open to people of all faiths. Therefore, Balakrishnan, whose faith is Marxism, is not barred from the temple, quipped a CPM sympathiser.

 Till about two decades ago, it was infra dig for a true Marxist to visit a temple. Communists were not expected to do anything that goes against the tenets of Marxism. For most Marxists, display of their faith was a bourgeois act.

 But the CPM in Kerala has come a long way, slowly casting off practices out of sync with the times. It has even been sending its ministers to churches, temples and other places of worship.

 SC sealing stick falls on its lawyers

 CHARU SUDAN KASTURI

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: Thousands of Delhi lawyers are facing the laws lash, with their legal acumen holding out little hope of escape.

 Nearly 1,000 small and big law firms function illegally out of residential areas and some of them were sealed during the recent drive following Supreme Court orders, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) says.

 Many lawyers, including around 25 practising in the Supreme Court, fear their turn may be next once the sealing drive, on hold till January 31 next year, resumes.

 One of them is the amicus curiae for the apex court on the sealing issue itself, responsible for informing the court about the implementation of its order.

 Supreme Court lawyer Lalit Bhasin, whose office on Hailey Road falls in the illegal category, and many others want special IT park-like areas allocated for law firms.

 The lawyers arent happy with their current options: shifting their offices to a commercial area or converting them into a mixed-land-use area half-residential and half-commercial.

 It would make the offices too small. Senior lawyers spend their lifes earnings in setting up their offices. How can they convert half the office into a residential place, or leave the office and restart elsewhere? asked lawyer Rajiv Kumar Luthra, whose office is in a commercial area and is therefore safe from sealing.

 Many of the lawyers admit they had supported the drive when it initially targeted small shops.

 Perhaps we should have opposed the drive from the beginning, rued Delhi High Court lawyer Sonjoy Bhattacharya, who has received an MCD notice telling him his office is in line to be sealed.

 The lawyers say they would approach the Centre with an argument it cant resist. Commerce minister Kamal Nath has spoken of plans to open up the legal services sector to meet WTO commitments.

 By sealing the law firms, the lawyers say, Delhi would be sending the wrong signal to global law firms who want to enter India.

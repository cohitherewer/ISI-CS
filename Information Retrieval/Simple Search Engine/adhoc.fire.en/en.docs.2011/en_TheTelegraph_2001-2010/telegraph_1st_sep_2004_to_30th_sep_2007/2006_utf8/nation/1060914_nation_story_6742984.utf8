 Mulford thrusts, 

Pranab parries

 Mulford, Mukherjee: 

 Setting the record straight 

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: US ambassador David C. Mulfords remarks here today that India was going slow with economic reforms has stung New Delhi to the quick and prompted defence minister Pranab Mukherjee to retort that liberalisation was on the right track.

 Mukherjee went on to cite the recent adoption of a new policy by his own ministry of defence that has made foreign direct investment easier by partnering with Indian companies.

 The US ambassador and the defence minister came out with opposing views on the pace of reforms by India at the third India-US Economic Summit.

 Mulford said the business environment in India was favourable to trade and investment. But there are signs of a pause in the reform process in recent months. Privatisations have stopped, and political reality suggests that reform of other key sectors and policies of central interest to investors will take longer than envisioned, he said.

 Probably mindful of the Lefts opposition to several economic policies, the US ambassador said the stalling of reforms would take its toll. 

 It is important to bear in mind there are serious economic costs to any loss of momentum on the reform front. The Prime Minister has expressed his hopes for even higher than 8 per cent growth per annum for India. But he has also indicated that higher growth requires continued reforms.

 The World Bank still ranks India 134 out of 175 among countries for the difficulties of establishing or operating a business, and US firms have many unresolved legacy issues involving prior investments in India, he said.

 With the right policies, there would be major US investments in India, Mulford pointed out.

 Mukherjee currently the senior-most in the government with the Prime Minister overseas took up the cudgels and said economic change in India was steady. 

 Reforms are not a stop-and-go but a continuous process, he said.

 There could be minor hitches in the process of reforms but, as you know only too well, democracy is about checks and balances. Decisions can be taken only after debate and due consideration. Hasty decision-making can have its own negative repercussions, the defence minister responded. 

 Quoting from a study by the Wharton Business School, he claimed that India is a better place for business than China.

 Punjab flashes Manila alert

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, May 15: The Punjab government has directed deputy commissioners of police to discourage people from migrating to the Philippines for jobs in the risk-prone money-lending business.

 Intelligence reports have suggested that they were joining mafia gangs engaged in extortion and kidnappings.

 A communiqu? from the state NRI affairs commissioner to the DCPs said the Indian ambassador in Manila had informed the Union overseas Indian affairs ministry that people from rural Punjab were operating as money-lenders in the Philippines and getting adverse publicity in the media. Their activities had also created resentment among native Filipinos.

 The DCPs have been asked to create awareness among the Punjabis willing to migrate to the Philippines so that they do not join the money-lending business.

 Last year, over 10 Punjabis, mainly from the Doaba region, were killed in the Philippines for their links with the money-lending business. This year, seven have died.

 Last month, Kultar Singh, alias Tony, from Gillian village near Kapurthala, was shot at in Manila. He died on April 26. Five of his family members have been killed too, the police said. 

 The Indian community in the Philippines is estimated to comprise over 50,000 people, of whom 3,000 have acquired Filipino citizenship. Punjabis and Sindhis constitute bulk of the people.

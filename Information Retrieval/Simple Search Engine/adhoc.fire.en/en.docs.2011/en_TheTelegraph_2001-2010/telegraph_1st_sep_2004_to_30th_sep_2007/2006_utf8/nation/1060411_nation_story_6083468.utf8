 Nine-year-old directs Jackie

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, April 10: The nine-year-old tries to convince Jackie Shroff he is old enough to sit the Class X board exam.

 Shroff has no choice but to agree. He may be playing chief minister, but the child is the films director and gets to decide the script.

 In his red shirt and crumpled blue trousers at the AVM Studio today, Kishen could pass off as just another starry-eyed schoolboy, rushing about the sets in the excitement of actually watching a film being shot. Only if he didnt look so professional as he gripped the camera with his left hand and waved directions expertly to the crew with his right.

 The Bangalore boy, already a veteran of several Kannada TV serials, is now set to enter the Guinness Book as the youngest person ever to direct a full-length feature film.

 The shooting of Tamil flick Sadhanai (achievement) began today, but the Kannada and Hindi versions ? the latter titled Care of Platform ? are almost complete.

 The film is about an orphan ? played by Kishen himself ? who through grit and sheer genius passes the matriculation, studying all by himself after no school would take him, said sources close to producers VC Film Makers.

 But initially, there is a hitch. The prodigy, who supports himself by selling newspapers, is underage and cant take the exam.

 And so, enter Shroff ? the chief minister in all versions ? ready to be persuaded to waive the age bar through an executive order.

 Kishen conceived the story, the sources said, after watching an orphan boy study in a slum that he passed daily on his way to school in Bangalore.

 When his father discussed Kishens story idea with friends, all they could think of was a documentary on the sufferings of orphans. But when Kishen fleshed it out, the flow of narrative and the boys eye for detail convinced everyone that a full-scale commercial film alone could do justice to the story.

 The Guinness record is held by Sydney Ling of the Netherlands, the sources said. Ling, born in 1959, was 13 when he made Lex, The Wonder Dog. That record may crumble when the three versions of Kishens film are released simultaneously, hopefully a few months on.

 What made him take the real-life slum kid so seriously? Didnt our President sell newspapers as a boy? Kishen shot back at the questioner on the studio floor.

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Some 25,000 beleaguered traders got a ray of hope today after the Supreme Court said it would think about giving them relief, but they have to first stop using residential space for commercial purposes.

 The traders, whose premises were legalised by the government after the sealing drive started, had agreed to close down their establishments in undertakings submitted to a court-appointed monitoring committee.

 The court said it would, after getting a report from the committee, consider whether the traders could be given temporary respite and brought on a par with those whose premises have been exempted till the validity of two government notifications are decided.

 The observation came after the Centre and the Delhi civic authorities pointed out that the premises of 25,000 traders facing action were protected under the notifications but were being sealed merely because they had filed affidavits before the notifications had been issued.

 In the evening, additional municipal commissioner Parimal Rai said the drive to seal these establishments was being suspended till further orders from the court. 

 In the apex court, the bench, headed by Chief Justice Y.K. Sabharwal, said: We permit them (the 25,000 traders) to inform the monitoring committee that in terms of the undertakings they have stopped the misuse.

 The bench said the panel could carry out random checks before filing a report by November 20. Thereafter, the court will consider whether such traders for the present can be temporarily relieved of their undertakings.

 The order is a departure from the one passed on November 6 when the court had directed resumption of the sealing drive starting with those who had filed affidavits before the court.

 The court refused to give relief in individual cases and rejected a plea by a school which said it has been operating since 1962 and had about 700 students on its rolls. When Supreme Court Bar Association president M.N. Krishnamani, who appeared for the school, asked the bench to treat the matter sympathetically, Sabharwal said: Dont create an impression that we dont have compassion.

 The court added kerosene, ration shops and cycle repair shops to the list of 22 categories of activities exempted on the panels recommendation.

 Babri tune changes with shift in power

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: The Centre today told the Liberhan Commission that the Babri Masjid was demolished in pursuance of a conspiracy to build a Ram temple at the disputed site.

 Brushing aside the NDA governments assertion that a spontaneous upsurge led to the demolition, the UPA government said then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, his council of ministers, state government officials, BJP leaders, and some individuals and organisations had connived and conspired to demolish the structure.

 The government contended in its 246-page response to the commission probing the Ayodhya demolition that the destruction was a step towards achieving the object of building the temple. They took various steps in this regard, it alleged.

 The Centre said soon after taking charge, Singh had visited the site along with his ministers to offer prayers.

 The UPA government further alleged that the then state government had systematically diluted security arrangements in Ayodhya before the structure was demolished on December 6, 1992.

 Giving a virtual clean chit to the then Congress regime at the Centre, it said while the central government was trying to resolve the issue, the BJP, RSS, VHP and the Bajrang Dal were busy with their plan to construct the temple.

 The government said the demolition was an act of national shame. A 500-year-old structure which was defenceless and whose safety was a sacred trust in the hands of the state government was demolished.

 Although the NDA government had once admitted before the commission that the state government was negligent, it retracted the statement after Singh took strong exception to it.

New Delhi, Oct. 30: Violent clashes broke out between traders and police on the first day of a three-day bandh today, reviving memories of the violence in Seelampur last month, in which three schoolchildren were killed.

 If the traders faced lathis for trying to break through barricades, inside the Delhi Assembly, Sheila Dixit was facing up to what could be the sternest test in her political career.

 The BJP today announced it would bring a no-confidence motion against her government. 

 The fault lies entirely with the government. They have not dealt with the issue with the seriousness it deserves, said BJP leader Arun Jaitley. Probably they do not understand it is a question of livelihood. Where will the traders go if they do not get relief?

 A clearly troubled Dixit said she was confident of surviving the motion, but her own party colleagues in the Assembly did not appear too happy with her. Hundreds of accusations of mishandling the sealing issue came down on Dixit in the Assembly today not all from the Opposition. 

 A kilometre-and-a-half away from the Assembly, traders fought pitched battles with the police.

 The police had decided the traders would not be allowed beyond the Chandgi Ram Akhada, but were well short in numbers to face the thousands of protesters as they broke through two layers of barricades.

 Tear gas proved ineffective, but the redoubtable water canon came in good use, pushing them back.

 Some of the traders had met Sonia Gandhi on Saturday when she had assured them the government would do its best to stop the sealing, but their faith in the government or the Congress president seemed scarce. Effigies of Dixit and Sonia were burnt, showing that the protesters were in no mood to let the water douse their protests. 

 Late in the evening, there were reports of a trader having been killed in police firing, which the police have denied.

 In view of todays violence, the Delhi government has ordered all schools to be closed tomorrow and on Wednesday, the remaining days of the bandh. The circular from the directorate of education brought an end to the confusion that has reigned over the past two days over whether schools were to stay closed.

 By George, Indians like Bush

 PTI AND OUR BUREAU

 Houston, March 1: What would be the smartest thing George Bush could do while in India? Simple: look for a permanent address.

 The worlds largest democracy would make him feel at home.

 A survey on global attitudes has found that the US President, unpopular in many countries around the globe, is widely admired in India.

 Of the 16 countries surveyed on this question last year, India was the only one, apart from the US, where a majority expressed at least some confidence in Bush.

 According to the 2005 Pew Global Attitudes survey, part of a project co-chaired by former US secretary of state Madeleine K. Albright, 54 per cent Indians approve of the way the President is handling world affairs. 

 In his own country, however, a recent survey reported that Bushs job rating has plummeted to an all-time low of 34 per cent, down from 42 last month. Just 30 per cent approve of how he is handling the Iraq war.

 Overall, Indians are generally positive about the US. The survey found that 71 per cent Indians view America in a favourable light. 

 Indians also tend to support the war on terror, with 52 per cent supporting the US-led campaign. However, 75 per cent said their government did the right thing by not joining the coalition.

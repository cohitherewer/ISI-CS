 Moksha as usual at the ghats

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Varanasi, March 10: As on every other morning, mahant Ramswarup Mishra is at the Dashaswamedh ghat at 5.30 am sharp. The burly man in his fifties shuffles down the long flight of wide stone steps, two junior priests in tow. A huge boat is waiting to ferry them to the eastern bank of the Ganga.

 From the river, the wide stretch of the ghat provides a panoramic view of Hinduisms leading spiritual centre stirring to life for the day. There are the priests and teenaged boys in loincloth, in the middle of their workouts or ablutions, and the curious foreign tourist watching the theory of moksha (liberation of the soul) in action.

 Mishra calls out to the mahant of a different temple on another boat: Jaldi aao, sambhal ke aao (Hurry up but be careful).

 The other priest, who looks slimmer than Mishra, shoots back: Ajkal bom phata Banaras mein, tu sambhal ke rahe (Take care, these days bombs are going off in Varanasi).

 The reference to bombs sets off an explosion of laughter in the middle of the Ganga among the boats passengers.

 In half an hour, the mahants and other priests are working out on the sand on the eastern bank. They take holy dips bowing their heads towards the rising sun.

 The days business has already kicked off on the ghats, now swarming with foreign tourists eager for boat rides. Groups of boys, some as young as six or seven, try to impress them by showing off their knowledge of the visitors own languages.

 A 10-year-old boy quickly befriends a Japanese woman by speaking a few words in her mother tongue.

 But theres no time for trivial vanities any more. The bhang is being mixed with rabri malai and the flower petals strewn on the hallowed beverage. Soon, tourist and temple priest will be united in bliss.

 In the evening, a visit to Asi ghats ceremonial steps will bring cries of invitation for a ganja trip from sadhus speaking French, English and Swedish.

 Three days after the blast, no one is looking over their shoulder on the ghats of Varanasi. 

 Nobody is afraid of death here. The Ganga symbolises the flow of the divine spirit unaffected by anything happening outside. Death here is a bliss and a privilege, says Devendra Shastri, a 32-year-old sadhu who claims he speaks six languages.

 The ghats and the river stand for moksha, both physical and metaphysical.

 There are 21 major ghats along the western bank, each with its own history, mythology and contemporary lore. 

 As dusk falls, the chanting of mantras wafts out of the temples along with the fragrance of incense. 

 The exquisitely carved palaces cast their splendour along the western bank, weaving intricate patterns of light and shadow. 

 How can there be a fear of death here? Mishra asks. Here, life and death walk hand in hand.

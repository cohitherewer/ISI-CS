 Blasts case in home stretch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 10: The Bombay blasts case goes into its last leg tomorrow, when Judge Pramod Kode will begin to hear arguments on the quantum of sentence of those convicted.

 Of the 123 accused facing trial for the 1993 serial blasts that killed 257, Judge Kode had convicted 100 and acquitted 23. 

 Actor Sanjay Dutt, who was cleared of involvement in the blasts but held guilty of possessing arms, is one of the 100 awaiting punishment.

 Arguments for all the accused found guilty under one section will be heard together, and the judge is likely to begin with either Section 3 (3) of Tada aiding and abetting a terrorist act or Section 120 (b) of the Indian Penal Code criminal conspiracy. The bulk of the accused were found guilty under these two sections. 

 Dutt was convicted under the Arms Act. 

 The sentences will be handed at one go after all the arguments have been heard.

 Defence counsel Harshad Ponda, who has completed arguments on the sentencing of prime accused Tiger Memons four family members the judge had planned to hear the arguments as he gave the verdicts, but dropped the idea after the first day will open with the legalities of section 3 (3) of Tada. 

 Each of the other defence lawyers will argue on the same section for their clients. The prosecution will then reply. 

 The CBI had slapped Tada section 3 (1) (2) and (3) and sections 5 and 6 on the accused who it said had participated in conspiracy meetings, travelled to Pakistan for arms training, filled RDX in vehicles, planted bombs, participated in arms landings or transported arms and explosives. 

 While Section 3(1) and (2) were applied to those who planted bombs that killed and injured people respectively, sections 5 and 6 were slapped for possession of arms and explosives.

 Over 16 of the 100 accused face the death penalty. 

 Judge Kode has recorded the statements of the accused, mandatory under the Criminal Procedure Code. Most, including Dutt, have pleaded for leniency. 

 All eyes will be on the prosecution to see what punishment it seeks for Dutt. As reported earlier, the CBI is said to have asked the prosecution to go easy on him. Under the Arms Act, the actor can face five to 10 years in jail.

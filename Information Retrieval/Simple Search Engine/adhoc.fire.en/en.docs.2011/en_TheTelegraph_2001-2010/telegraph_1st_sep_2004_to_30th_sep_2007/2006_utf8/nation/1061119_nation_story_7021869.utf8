 Pak lover in uniform seeks refuge

 Jammu, Nov. 18 (PTI): A Pakistani soldier, who fled to India after allegedly being threatened for having an affair with an officers wife in his country, has been arrested near the border in Poonch district.

 Banafar Khan, a rifleman in the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering unit of the Pakistan Army and a resident of Rawalakot in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, crossed the Line of Control at Makki post on Thursday night, officials said today.

 Arrested by the Indian Army, Khan admitted he was a Pakistani soldier, they said. He told military interrogators that he had an affair with the wife of a major in a PoK camp.

 But the major came to know of it and threatened to kill him, prompting Khan to cross over to this side, he told the army officers.

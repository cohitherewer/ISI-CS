 Subhas bats for Dalmiya against cricket board

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 15: Bengal 

 sports minister Subhas Chakraborty today backed Cricket 

 Association of Bengal president Jagmohan Dalmiya) in 

 his battle against the national cricket boards injustice.

 Chakraborty had earlier hinted that if Dalmiya accepted the chief ministers advice not to contest the upcoming CAB presidents election, the state government might help him fight the corruption charges levelled by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

 Though the government will not be a party to a case, the chief minister will see if there is anything he can do, Chakraborty had promised.

 A source in the Dalmiya camp said the offer implied in the ministers comments today would be considered. If a proposal comes from such responsible quarters, we have to consider it. Then it is up to us to say yes or no.

 Chakraborty today said: Injustice is being done to Dalmiya by the BCCI, which has filed an FIR for alleged misappropriation of funds relating to the 1996 World Cup.

 He recalled how the sum, originally said to be Rs 21 lakh, later climbed to Rs 5.76 crore, Rs 21 crore and then Rs 40 crore. I wont be surprised if it shoots up to Rs 100 crore.

 He also questioned the boards plans to raise its current committees tenure from one year to three years.

 Asked whom he would support in the CAB elections, an evasive Chakraborty said he had never interfered in a sports bodys affairs. The chief minister has made it plain he wants city police chief Prasun Mukherjee to win.

 Public works minister Kshiti Goswami will be the chief guest at CABs annual day function on July 23.

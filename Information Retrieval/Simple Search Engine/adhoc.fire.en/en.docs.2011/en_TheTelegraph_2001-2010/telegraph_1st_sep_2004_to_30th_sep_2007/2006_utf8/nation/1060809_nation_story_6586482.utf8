 SC ruling on quota clubbing

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Supreme Court today held that state governments could not do away with the quota for Extremely Backward Classes without any study to justify their amalgamation with Other Backward Classes for the purpose of reservation.

 It is not binding on any government to categorise backward classes as backward and more backward, but it could not scrap an existing classification without any study, data or material to justify amalgamation, a bench headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan said. 

 The order was passed while quashing a Jharkhand government decision to merge the Extremely Backward Class and the Backward Classes into one group for the purpose of reservation.

 A pressure group had approached the apex court against a Jharkhand High Court order upholding the amalgamation.

 The Supreme Court brushed aside the contention of the state government that allocating reservation to OBCs as one block was similar to and consistent with the policy of the central government. 

 The bench clarified that though a court could not direct the government to make sub-categorisation of a reserved category, it could prevent it from doing away with such sub-categorisation without application of mind.

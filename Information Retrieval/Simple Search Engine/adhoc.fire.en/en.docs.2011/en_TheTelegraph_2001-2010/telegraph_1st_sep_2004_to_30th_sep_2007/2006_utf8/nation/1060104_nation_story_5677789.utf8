 Mittal team in ore doubt

 ANUPAM SHESHANK

 Ranchi, Jan. 3: Mittal Steel today cast doubts on whether Jharkhand has enough iron ore deposits for the groups proposed steel plant in the state.

 Does Jharkhand have iron ore deposits other than Chiriya mines? a senior Mittal Steel official asked, while responding to a question on whether the group was serious about setting up shop here, especially as it is yet to apply for a mining lease.

 There is no question of not coming, but what will we do there without iron ore? We are committed to the MoU but awaiting the availability of ore, he said.

 Mittal Steel sent two teams to survey the availability of resources. But the findings were not encouraging, the official claimed. The teams have not found any iron ore reserves in Jharkhand so far, except in the Chiriya mines, leased to the Indian Iron and Steel Company, the Mittal Steel official said in London. 

 Although the Jharkhand government would like to cancel the lease to IISCO, ostensibly to allow new steel plants access to the ore, the central mining tribunal has stayed the states cancellation order. 

 Reacting to claims by Jharkhand ministers that the state has sufficient ore, the official said their survey showed the opposite. It does not matter who claims what. If the claims are based on scientific research, we would certainly like to examine the truth, he said.

 The Mittal Steel official further said neither has the state government approached them after the MoU was signed, nor has the group approached the government. 

 He said: The site of the steel plant would depend on the site of the mines. The plant will be close to the iron ore mines and until the mines are identified, the plant cannot be set up. 

 He confirmed that the group is negotiating with former Rourkela Steel Plant managing director Sanak Mishra to head its Jharkhand operations.

 According to official estimates, Jharkhands iron ore reserves hover around 3,700 million tonnes of which as much as 2,400 million tonnes are believed to be in the Chiriya mines alone. 

 Mittal Steel officials also doubt how the state would provide iron ore to other players in the steel industry. 

 Flaying the state government for signing as many as six MoUs for one property, they claimed that barring the Tatas and Jindals, none of the others seemed serious about investing in Jharkhand.

 Back home, mines secretary Arun Kumar Singh and mines minister Madhu Koda admitted that there has been no contact with the Mittals after the deal was signed. 

 Both, however, insisted that the state has ample reserves of iron ore and is in a position to meet the commitments. But the Mittals must apply first, said Koda, because rules are, after all, rules; once they apply, we will go all out to ensure supply of iron-ore. 

 Neither of them, however, could identify iron ore reserves other than the Chiriya mines.

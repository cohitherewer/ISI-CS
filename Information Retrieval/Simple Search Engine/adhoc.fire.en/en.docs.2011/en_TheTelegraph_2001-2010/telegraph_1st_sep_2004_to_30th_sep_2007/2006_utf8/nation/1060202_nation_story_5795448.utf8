 Mumbai, Feb. 1: Flights in and out of Mumbai operated normally in spite of the strike till 4 pm, after which some had to be rescheduled.

 Indian Airlines flights to Calcutta, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Nagpur and Delhi in the evening were delayed by two hours. Some private airline flights were also rescheduled.

 Kingfisher Airlines spokesperson Prakash Mirpuri said: Flights to and out of Calcutta were delayed, but we operated the flights and would operate them tomorrow as well. There was a 20-minute delay across the board for all airlines today.

 But other operations took a hit. Aerobridges were unserviceable and we had to use ladders. Conveyor belts were not functional. So, we had to do manual loading of baggage, Indian Airlines spokesperson K. Swaminathan said. We appeal to passengers to check with our flight information desks before arriving at the airport and try to travel light.

 The airport fire department, which plays a critical role in emergency landings, was crippled. The department has over 200 trained officers with seven fire engines to deal with emergencies. None of them reported for work today.

 Flights could operate normally only because air force and Mumbai fire brigade officials were roped in.

 Praful Asurlekar, an airport fire officer and general secretary of the Mazdoor Sangh, found fault with the move. We are trained to respond in 138 seconds to any emergency. They have pressed in Indian Air Force and Mumbai fire brigade officials, but are they trained to deal with air emergencies? he asked

 Bits of garbage littered the check-in lounges, toilets were not cleaned, baggage trolleys were scattered all over and baggage conveyor belts were not functioning as an estimated 2,500 employees went on strike from 10 am.

 Nitin Jadhav, joint secretary of the AAI Employees Union, said: One DGM-level officer was manning the control room for allotment of parking bays for aircraft. But how long can they continue?

 Around noon, the protesters clashed with police, who lathicharged thrice in 45 minutes to disperse the crowd. Jadhav said the police action was unprovoked, but deputy commissioner R. Shengaonkar said it was necessary to stop protesters from gatecrashing into the terminal.

 The police said five persons, including a constable, were injured. But Jadhav said 25 union members were in hospital, three of them with serious head injuries.

 Around 6.20 pm, the airport, which handles about 500 arrivals and departures daily, plunged into darkness. Power was restored in 10 minutes. 

 Airport director R.J. Treasurywala was not available for comment through the day. 

 Passengers complained of lack of information. Actor Rituparna Sengupta was among them. I was to take the 4.40 pm Jet flight, but they said it has been rescheduled to 6.30 pm, she said, unaware that Calcutta airport was crippled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Now, a quota for temples

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, July 3: From government offices and colleges, caste reservation is set to invade the most unlikely of places ? Hindu temples.

 Weeks after ordering all temples to open doors to lower caste priests, the new DMK government has decided that the only way to ensure compliance could be a quota.

 Priests at most temples in Tamil Nadu ? as elsewhere in India ? have traditionally been Brahmins. Some small village shrines, though, have Dalit priests.

 Chief minister Karunanidhi had recently earned applause by passing an order that all Hindus, irrespective of caste, who are appropriately trained and qualified (know the rituals) should be allowed to become archakas (temple priests).

 Now his government has formed a committee to advise it on how to implement the order. Among the policy decisions the seven-member committee will consider is extending the states 69 per cent job quota to state-governed temples.

 Some 36,370 temples in the state ? including almost all the major ones ? are controlled by the state governments Hindu charitable and religious endowments department.

 To remove any objections that lower caste candidates might lack the necessary knowledge of scriptures and rituals, the government plans training centres for would-be archakas. All future priests, from any caste, will have to graduate from these centres.

 The quota will apply both at the time of admission to the training course and at the time of appointment as priest.

 The committee, headed by retired high court judge Justice A.K. Rajan, will suggest the minimum age and educational qualifications for admission, as well as the possible locations of the training centres. It will submit its report in two months.

 In Tamil Nadu, both in college admissions and in government jobs, 18 per cent of seats/posts are reserved for the Scheduled Castes, 1 per cent for the Scheduled Tribes, 30 per cent for the Backward Castes and 20 per cent for the Most Backward Castes.

 The BJP, which had welcomed the governments earlier order allowing people from all castes to become temple priests, reacted to the latest move with shock.

 How can the quota apply to the recruitment of trainee priests? The candidates attitude should be the only criterion, said BJP national secretary Ela Ganesan.

 We need more time to study the latest order. We had already told the government that all Hindu organisations should be consulted in the matter of recruiting trainee archakas.

 Pawar wangles wheat seal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 16: Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar managed to have his way today by obtaining cabinet clearance for the import of 22 million tonnes of wheat under quality norms that are below those specified in the countrys Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA).

 The cabinet had earlier this month rejected the proposal on the ground that the stringency of the import specification must be fixed keeping in view the relevant standard applicable for domestic wheat procurement. While the decision was taken on June 2, it has now been overturned a fortnight later.

 A senior minister said after the meeting that the wheat is being allowed to be imported under the Codex norms laid down by WHO and FAO. These rules do not mention some of the poisonous weeds that are explicitly banned under the Indian norms.

 According to PFA norms, Argemone mexicana, a weed that causes dropsy, and Lathyrus sativus, which causes paralysis of the lower body, are not allowed in wheat procured for human consumption. These weeds grow along with wheat and oilseeds the world over. 

 Argemone mexicana contamination in mustard oil in India has in the past led to cases of dropsy.

 Among other things, it was for these two contaminants that Pawars ministry sought relaxation while importing wheat.

 While the PFA norms say that wheat should be free from these weeds, the food and public distribution department wanted that this phrase be replaced by practically free for imported wheat.

 It had proposed that to ensure that the wheat is largely free from these contaminants, it is specified that the supply shall be practically free from Argemone mexicana and Lathyrus sativus, which shall be ensured by the supplier through sieving and other appropriate methods.

 Critics of the imports allege that the phrase practically free allows for discretion and that there is no easy way of finding out if the supplier has really sieved the wheat to remove these weeds. 

 They also say the Codex norms, as listed by the department in its cabinet note, do not specify any limits at all for the two dangerous weeds.

 Pawars ministry, however, has argued that there would be a direct benefit from the one time relaxation of food safety norms for wheat ? the quality specification as proposed is expected to enable wider participation by major suppliers in the short-period tender for import of wheat for the central pool.

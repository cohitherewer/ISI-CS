 Blows rain on cricket crowd

 Faridabad, March 31: Known to be baton-happy, Haryana police struck a seven-year-old girl on the head today when they let fly at an unruly crowd trying to enter the stadium for the India-England one-day match.

 Vidya Jain had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of a local hospital. Her condition was said to be stable. 

 District commissioner G. Anupama said the police used batons to discipline the crowd. Without the lathi-charge, it would have been impossible to control the crowd, most of whom were without tickets, yet tried to break into the ground through Gate No. 7.

 Haryana police sullied its reputation when it beat up protesting workers of the Honda factory in Gurgaon in July 2005 in an incident that an eyewitness had compared to Jalianwala Bagh.

 Vidya was not the only one to be hurt. Faridabad District Cricket Association sources said seven people, including three women, were injured in the police action. One of the women was newly married.

 Faridabad police chief Mahender Singh was quoted by PTI as saying: There were a large number of ticketless people who were trying to forcibly enter the stadium. They were pushing the ticket-holders and trying to sneak in. At this juncture we resorted to a mild cane charge.

 Vidya had a ticket, though, as did her mother ? who, too, was injured ? accompanying her.

 On the contrary, the behaviour of the police and other security personnel during the match left the distinct impression that they could have over-reacted in the morning. 

 A large number of policemen and officials with duty badges on their shirtfronts were idling around and occupied the seats of ticket-holders. The media box was full of policemen carrying guns and other local officials occupying seats meant for journalists, many of whom worked sitting on the floor.

 The presence of chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda led to security personnel not only restricting movements of spectators, but also pushing and hitting them at the slightest provocation.

 A Haryana cricket official said: Lack of free passes was the biggest problem. Since the chief minister was to come, the officers around him grabbed almost all the VIP passes. A lot of genuine people, who have been associated with the game for years, could not get in. Some of them tried to sneak in through other sources. That created all the trouble.

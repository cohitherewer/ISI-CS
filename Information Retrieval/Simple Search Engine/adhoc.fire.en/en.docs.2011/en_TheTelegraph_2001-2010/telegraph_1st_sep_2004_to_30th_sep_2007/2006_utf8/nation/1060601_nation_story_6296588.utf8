 BJP cant see beyond Sonia

 New Delhi, May 31: The profit row threatens the fate of the entire government, but the BJPs focus is on one person ?Sonia Gandhi.

 For the umpteenth time today, party chief Rajnath Singh raised the pitch for the Congress leaders resignation. If the Congress president truly believes in the moral values she so often talks about, she should resign after the President has returned the office-of-profit bill, he said.

 A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who seems to be having misgivings about the retrospective clause in the bill, which helped several MPs escape disqualification, yesterday returned the office-of-profit bill to Parliament for reconsideration.

 Asked which post the BJP would like Sonia to quit, Rajnath said: That she has to decide.

 Since Sonia has been re-elected to the Lok Sabha after she stepped down from all offices of profit, she is not affected by the bill.

 Rajnath appeared to suggest that she should quit from the Lok Sabha again. The aim of the present bill was to protect the Congress president. But she resigned citing moral reasons. In truth, the Election Commission was to decide on whether she is to be disqualified. If she was really clean, why did she not face the ECs investigation? he asked.

 Ill tell you why; because she did not have the courage. If she truly believes in morality in public life, then she should quit after the Presidents decision to return the bill because the whole exercise was to protect her, Rajnath added.

 The BJP president released a report card on the United Progressive Alliances two years in power with the largest chapter on Sonia.

 What the party cannot seem to get over is her decision not to become Prime Minister after the UPA won the last general elections. 

 Judging by their response in the report card, Sonias renunciation still seems to be a cause of much heartburn in the BJP. 

 The so-called, self-confessed Great Renunciator placed by sycophants in the league of Lord Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi for her act of giving up power has, in fact, through this masterly stroke become the super Prime Minister in the UPA government, read the second paragraph of the chapter Sonia Gandhis Renunciation Drama in the report card.

 The BJP suggests that Jaya Bachchan was disqualified from the Rajya Sabha, a decision of the President on the ECs recommendation, because of Sonia. This was obviously done because the Bachchans and the Gandhis have not been on good terms for quite some time.

 But the step, the BJP says, boomeranged on the Congress when Sonia herself faced disqualification because she, too, was holding an office of profit.

 Ally spoiler in Congress fuel balm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 12: A week after upsetting the Congress by backing Rahul Bajaj for the Rajya Sabha, Sharad Pawars party now threatens to puncture its allys big plan to ride out the fuel price storm.

 The Nationalist Congress Party today signalled it might oppose the Maharashtra governments bid to offer a sales tax relief on fuel if the move hits the treasury too hard.

 The Congress had asked its chief ministers to forgo sales tax on the amount by which the fuel prices have been raised. It had then tried to push the hikes critics ? the Left and BJP ? on the back foot by daring them to follow suit in the states they ruled.

 Maharashtra had taken the lead in pledging the relief, and several other Congress-ruled states had followed.

 But two days before the state cabinet meets on June 14 to approve the relief, NCP spokesperson Ratnakar Mahajan said: Sales tax is a major source of revenue. If it (the relief) impacts revenues in a big way, well oppose it.

 Mahajan didnt name a figure. Government sources have pegged the loss at Rs 425 crore.

 NCP bigwigs avoided comment but sources hinted the party was upset at the Congresss failure to consult it before hiking fuel prices.

 Congress leaders argued that as head of the coalition government, chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had the right to decide on the sales tax relief on his own.

 (This) is another example of how NCP does not observe the coalition dharma, state Congress spokesperson Hussain Dalwai said.

 The Congress had felt let down when its ally joined hands with the Opposition BJP and Shiv Sena to nominate Bajaj for the Rajya Sabha on June 5. It defiantly decided to field its own candidate, a state-level functionary, who is almost certain to lose.

 The election is set for June 15 ? a day after the possible cabinet face-off on sales tax.

 But the NCP seemed divided. The NCP is concerned about the rising oil prices, and we are with the Congress on this issue. There is no difference of opinion, party general secretary Gurunath Kulkarni said today.

 The Congress, attacked on all sides ? ally MDMK joined the anti-hike chorus today ? plans a public awareness campaign to stress that if our governments can do it, why cant the others?

 Sources said even Congress workers needed convincing, for many opposed the steep hike and wondered how the token reduction through sales tax cut would help.

 The Congress will target the BJP more than the Left. The party has stopped its Kerala unit from agitating against the state government for refusing to slash sales tax on fuel.

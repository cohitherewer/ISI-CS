 Airline fined for timing gaffe

 New Delhi (PTI): Failure to intimate a change in the departure time of a flight has cost the airline, Indian, Rs 24,000 as a consumer court has held it guilty of deficiency of service.

 The Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission awarded the compensation to four persons, who on their way to New Delhi, were stranded at Indore airport for seven hours as they were not informed about the change in timing.

 The commission rejected the airlines plea that it was the dealer who was responsible for not informing the passengers about the change.

 Once the airlines or for that purpose any agency dealing in the business of travel, engages the services of its agent for sale of tickets, any lapse and shortcoming on the part of agent in not informing the consumers renders the principal liable and it cannot escape liability merely by taking the plea that it had already informed its agent, the bench said.

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Islamic studies, Buddhist studies, Sanskrit and law they shape the course of student politics in Indias Ivy-League institutions. 

 Leaders, past and present, as well as aspirants say the choice of a subject can be the key to a big leap for student-politicians. And, many who shot to limelight took up these disciplines to give their ambitions a push.

 One of the biggest problems for budding politicians is finding enough time. Many universities, like Delhis Jamia Milia Islamia, dont have an upper-age limit for union polls, but enforce stiff attendance rules for contestants. Almost all Bengal universities do the same.

 Choosing the right course can apparently ensure reasonable immunity from attendance rules, sometimes allowing students to continue for years in the university without paying attention to studies. 

 One of those is Shafiq Rana, pursuing a masters degree in Islamic studies at Jamia. In Jamia, most people in student politics want to take this course, because attendance is not taken seriously, says the 38-year old.

 In many institutions of Bengal, including Calcutta University, student leaders have it easier: they merely have to be registered in a course. 

 But in Delhi University, the official age bar stands at 25 years. But if you are a student of Buddhist studies, forget it all, and join the ballot bout even if you are in your thirties. 

 I have been in Delhi University for 15 years and Buddhist studies tops the list of courses best suited for political aspirants, says an MPhil student. Now 36, he has been elected secretary of the Delhi University Students Union (Dusu) twice once as a candidate of the Congress-affiliated National Students Union of India and the second time as a nominee of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the BJP.

 A forged birth certificate does the trick as far as the age bar goes, unless those opposed to you make it an issue. I have friends in all parties, he claims. Buddhist studies is a top draw with contenders this year, too.

 Since hardly anyone takes the course, seats are always available. It is possible to keep failing and yet stay on, says Amit Dhamal, a student of MA Sanskrit. The 24-year-old, contesting Dusu polls as an Independent, says Sanskrit isnt a bad option either. 

 But some student leaders feel those who deliberately overstay in courses like Buddhist studies and Sanskrit do so only for a hostel. 

 As far as student polls are concerned, the rules are generally enforced strictly, says current Dusu president Ragini Nayak. 

 Law is another favourite for a political career at Delhi University. We never face a problem because some of the top politicians like Arun Jaitley have come from the law faculty, a fact that benefitted the authorities, too, says Rajeev Dayal, who is contesting this year.

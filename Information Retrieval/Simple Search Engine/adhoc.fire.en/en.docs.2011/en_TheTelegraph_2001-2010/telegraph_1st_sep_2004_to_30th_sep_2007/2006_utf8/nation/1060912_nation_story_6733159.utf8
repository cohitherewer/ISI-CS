 An upgraded version of a sketch of a Malegaon blast suspect released by police

 Malegaon, Sept. 11: Police today upgraded one of the two sketches of the blast suspects that were released on Sunday after witnesses claimed they had seen the man hanging around in the Bada Kabrastan area, the site of the first explosion that rocked this textile town on Friday.

 Because of the two sketches that were given out yesterday, many other witnesses have come forward to help us and this is the upgraded photo of one of the accused that has been created with the help of information provided by them, superintendent of police, Nashik (rural), Rajvardhan told reporters here.

 The sketches released yesterday were of two men who purchased bicycles on which the bombs were planted, Rajvardhan said, adding that no arrests or detentions had been made so far.

 We are only questioning the eyewitnesses or the people who come forward with information. I request the media not to publish anything without confirming as it is leading to confusion and panic, he said.

 People who want to give information or leads on Fridays explosions can dial 02554-342197, Rajvardhan said.

 Four police teams have been sent outside Malegaon to investigate possible angles, he added.

 Speaking about police deployment in the town, he said: After the blast, the police have been made more visible and we are confident about security measures. We have beefed up security at sensitive places like mosques, temples and markets in Malegaon and have taken the trustees into confidence.

 Rajvardhan dismissed reports that suggested the police had information three days before the blasts that the town could be attacked.

 It is completely untrue that we had information about the bomb blasts. Three days prior to the blasts, we had information from our sources that a huge consignment of country-made revolvers was being brought to the city, the police officer said.

 From then on, we took requisite steps and started operations in places like bus stops and railway stations, Rajvardhan added.

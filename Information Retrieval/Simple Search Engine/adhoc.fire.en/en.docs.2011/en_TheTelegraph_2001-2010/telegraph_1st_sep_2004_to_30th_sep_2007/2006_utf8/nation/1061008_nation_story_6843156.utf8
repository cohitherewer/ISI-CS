 Bangalore, Oct. 7: Mangalore and its surrounding areas continued to be tense as seven persons travelling in an ambulance were attacked by a mob in a fresh outbreak of violence. One person succumbed to injuries suffered in yesterdays stone-throwing incident.

 However, officials said there was no confirmation of communal strife today. Police patrolled the streets today and over 200 people were detained.

 We have deployed additional forces in all the areas. The curfew will be in force till Sunday evening, Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner M. Maheshwar Rao said.

 Karnataka police chief B.S. Sial said a meeting would be held tomorrow to decide on curfew relaxation.

 On Friday night, police fired two rounds in the air to disperse a mob at Faisalnagar, on the citys outskirts. 

 The flare-up occurred after a truck carrying cattle allegedly knocked down two vehicles and sped away on Wednesday night. When the vehicle owners chased the truck and stopped it near an abattoir, they were allegedly beaten up by a group.

 The incident sparked tension with the Bajrang Dal and other Hindu outfits calling a bandh the next day. 

 The bandh turned violent as warring groups targeted shops of each others community. About 65 people have been injured in the violence over the past two days.

 Prohibitory orders were clamped and the district administration issued shoot-at-sight orders while declaring curfew in some pockets.

 Home minister M.P. Prakash said the administration had been told to crack down on anti-social elements instigating communal violence, looting and arson.

 Prakash suspected the hand of the Students Islamic Movement of India, the Hindu Jagaran Sangh, the Rama Sena and the VHP in spreading violence.

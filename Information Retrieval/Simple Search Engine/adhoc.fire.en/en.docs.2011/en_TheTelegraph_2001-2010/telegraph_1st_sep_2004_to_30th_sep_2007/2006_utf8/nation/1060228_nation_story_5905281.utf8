 New Delhi, Feb. 27: Pranab Mukherjee is set to come into his own as defence minister after P. Chidambarams allocations for the armed forces in the Union budget tomorrow. 

 Mukherjee, who has brought to the defence ministry a financial and statistical mindset because of his experience in handling economic portfolios, surprised the top brass by winning for the defence establishment whopping budget hikes in allocations last year and in the year before.

 But he has so long been playing on a wicket laid by predecessor George Fernandes in terms of the major military acquisitions that have been contracted in the last three years ? such as the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov, the British Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers and the Scorpene submarines from France. 

 The negotiations for each of these acquisitions lasted years and matured during Fernandess term at the helm but it was Mukherjee with his political clout who ensured that the contracts were structured and the allocations made despite threat perceptions on the borders being scaled down.

 With some of the biggest acquisitions already contracted, Mukherjee is now free to initiate or renew negotiations on projects that had willy-nilly been pushed into the backburner. Among these are the modernisation of the artillery, a crying need for the army and, of course, the multi-billion dollar order for multi-role combat aircraft for the Indian Air Force that is so tantalising for global arms majors.

 But the defence minister is known to be concerned that the army was not able to spend more than 40 per cent of the allocations for it in 2005-06 till January this year. 

 That somewhat deflated the campaign in the ministry to spend funds well in time and not return unspent capital allocations to the finance ministry. The defence ministry achieved the objective last year and Mukherjee does not want that record blemished. Year after year till 2004-05, the defence ministry was returning funds till Mukherjee put an end to the practice by rigidly monitoring expenditure and tuning a procurement policy to such an extent that he earned the description finance minister of defence.

 With Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assurance at an army commanders conference in 2005 that 3 per cent of the value of the Gross Domestic Product would be allocated to defence, Mukherjee can hope for a total allocation in the region of Rs 90,000 crore from Chidambaram tomorrow, a hike of about Rs 7,000 crore over the allocation for 2004-05. 

 As in previous years, about Rs 50,000 crore of the allocations would go into the revenue account to meet recurring and maintenance expenditure because there is little sign of the armed forces manpower being trimmed despite the push to modernise and upgrade equipment.

 Mukherjee can hope for the amount not only because of the projected needs of the army, the navy and the air force but also because there has been little opposition to military expenditure even from the Left. 

 Last year, at a pre-budget meeting, Mukherjee had made it clear to the Left that he did not want to debate expenditure for the military. In the last four years, there has been little or no discussion on defence allocations in Parliament.

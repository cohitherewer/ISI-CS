 CPM pat amp; prod for Pranab

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: Days after they got their new portfolios, the CPM leadership has urged Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony to review the UPA governments foreign and security policies.

 In the latest issue of the CPM mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy, party general secretary Prakash Karat has said: The completion of two-and-a-half years of the UPA government has more or less coincided with the appointment of a new foreign minister. This is an appropriate juncture to assess the governments foreign policy and, in particular, its policy on India-US relations.

 The CPM leader describes Mukherjee, the new foreign minister, as a cabinet member with the the most political experience. A.K. Antony is a new entrant to the cabinet who has taken over the defence portfolio. Both are well acquainted with the Congresss earlier role particularly during Indira Gandhis rule in formulating a non-aligned foreign policy safeguarding Indias vital interests.

 Karat writes that the Centre is expected to reappraise its foreign and security policies so that a proper direction can be given in these areas.

 The governments foreign policy has been one of the most hotly contested issues. The CPM has relented on some points of economic reform, but has refused to give the UPA any quarter on policies it believes are tailor-made to please the Bush administration. 

 The Left leadership sees both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Mukherjee as advocates of the school of thought that wants to harmonise Indias positions on regional and global issues with US global strategies.

 In his article, Karat stresses: The mid term (tenure of the UPA government) provides the backdrop to see how the Manmohan Singh government has implemented the common minimum programme (CMP) provision to pursue an independent foreign policy and promote multi-polarity in international relations. 

 The Lefts last skirmish with the UPA government over the Indo-US nuclear deal came when the Centre shot down the Lefts demand that Parliament adopt a resolution binding the government to the guidelines of the pact. 

 It could have turned ugly had the Prime Minister refused to spell out the guidelines on the floor of the House. 

 Karat reminds the government of the note the Left parties had submitted on foreign policy. He also indicates that the government has not heeded the Lefts suggestions.

 HC verdict gives widow relief

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has quashed Delhi Development Authoritys (DDA) bid to slap an excess amount of nearly Rs 1.91 lakh on a 74-year-old widow after belatedly allotting her a flat.

 The court has said the facts of the case displayed utter indifference of the authorities bordering on arrogance.

 Justice Ravindra Bhat also ordered the DDA to pay an interest of 12 per cent on Rs 1.55 lakh, belonging to the widow, held illegally by it for over six years.

 Dev Kumaris husband B.B. Sharma had applied for a flat at Paschim Vihar in September 1985. At the DDAs instance, Dev Kumari joined her husband in 1986 as a co-registrant of the flat. Sharma expired in 1987.

 In April 1989, Kumari received an allotment letter indicating a total cost of Rs 1,63,700 of which she had deposited Rs 92,832. Though the registration of the flat purportedly took place in August 1990, the DDA did not hand over the flat to her and cancelled the allotment in 1993.

 After Kumari made a representation, the DDA issued a fresh allotment letter to her for a flat at Jhilmil. But instead of acknowledging her deposit, the DDA allotted her a flat in August 1995, but at a higher cost of Rs 3,30,900.

 SC nod to contract service

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 said the government has the absolute right to appoint persons 

 on a contractual basis in higher posts if they fulfil the 

 required qualifications.

 A bench of Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and Tarun Chatterjee said so while upholding the contractual appointment of a managing director in the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board.

 Militant held

 from the Surankote area of Jammu and Kashmir for involvement

 Cop fire kills one

 fire at a railway station on Saturday following a spat with 

 a vendor. One man was killed and 12 were injured. Ranjit 

 Singh Yadav was later arrested, SSP Ajay Anand said.

Over 46.78 lakh pilgrims visited the Vaishno 

 Devi shrine in Jammu and Kashmir during the first eight

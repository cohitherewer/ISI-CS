 Poll makes Left harden selloff stand 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 2: The upcoming Bengal and Kerala elections have begun to play tricks with P. Chidambarams calculations.

 Keeping the Assembly polls in mind, the Left today opposed divestment in all profit-making public sector units, including the non-navratnas.

 We are against the governments proposal to disinvest four profit-making PSUs, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said after a meeting of the Left parties.

 Assuming that the Left would confine its uncompromising stand to the navratnas ? the jewels in the public sector stable ? the Centre had planned to off load small stakes in Power Finance Corporation, Hudco, Neyveli Lignite Corporation and National Mineral Development Corporation.

 Finance minister Chidambaram, who had met Karat and CPI leader A.B. Bardhan and was told to wait for the outcome of todays Left meeting, was hoping to raise Rs 1,500-1,800 crore by selling 10 to 15 per cent of shares from these companies.

 We will submit to the UPA within a week a set of alternative proposals for mobilising resources, said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan.

 The Left also stuck to its public stand on two other key issues ? the pension bill and airport modernisation ? and refused to endorse them. 

 The Left parties reiterated that privatisation of pension funds is not acceptable and that they are opposed to the pension fund regulatory development authority bill, a statement said.

 Privately, Left leaders conceded that a 5 per cent divestment in profit-making PSUs would not change the character of the companies, suggesting that a hard round of bargaining could breathe fresh life into Chidambarams proposal.

 But any deal may have to wait till the elections ? expected in May or June ? are over as it is difficult for the Left to be seen as supporting any initiative on divestment. 

 Disinvestment of shares of profitable PSUs is not the right way to raise resources, Karat said today.

 Before Chidambaram met Karat and Bardhan last week, the finance minister had put the proposal before the Left parties at a coordination committee meeting last month.

 The Left parties did not reject the proposal outri- ght then but said they would convey their response later.

 On modernisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports, the Left parties have demanded scrapping of the ongoing bidding process. They have suggested that the modernisation be left to the Airports Authority of India.

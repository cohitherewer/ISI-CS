 Pat for brave Bina

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Delhi High Court today applauded Bina Ramanis bravery as a witness in the Jessica Lal case and said police should have built their case on her statement rather than that of Shayan Munshi, who turned hostile.

 The praise came a day after the court had rapped Bina for a wishy-washy statement her second in the case in which she had failed to definitely identify prime accused Manu Sharma.

 Today, referring to the socialites first statement, the court said Bina, along with husband George Mailhot and daughter Malini, had shown bravery in withstanding pressures to turn hostile.

 Bina is the only one who has stood up to the test, the bench of Justices R.S. Sodhi and P.K. Bhasin said.

 There were hundreds of other witnesses in this case, but did any of them stand up like they (the Ramanis) did? the bench asked turning to Munshis lawyer, handing his actor client a rebuke for the second day on the trot.

 Mailhot came in for praise for his attempts to chase the murderer at the party (where Jessica was shot).

 The police, the court said, had focused too much on Munshis flip-flop statements and failed to give Binas evidence the importance it deserved. It noted that Bina had, in her first statement, said Munshi had told her that Manu had fired the shot that killed Jessica Lal.

 Bina also said she had seen Jessica fall and Manu, who was brandishing a gun, put it away in his pocket.

 The police, however, built their case on Munshis initial statement, in which he recognised Manu as the man who shot Jessica. But he turned hostile in court, claiming that the police testimony was written in Hindi, a language he didnt understand.

 His turnaround made the case much weaker, the court said, blaming the police for the mass acquittals of the nine accused, including Manu, earlier this year. If the police had used Bina as a witness better, Shayan Munshi turning hostile would not have mattered.

 An officer said the police would appeal to the court to admit fresh evidence in the light of the sting operation by Tehelka on hostile witnesses and their friends.

 Tehelka claims the diary and mobile of the late Karan Rajput, another prime witness who turned hostile, contain phone numbers of Manus father Venod Sharma, a Haryana minister, adds PTI. The Tehelka tapes show two acquaintances claiming Rajput was paid off by Venod.

 Sariska shadow on Simlipal tigers 

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Muffled roar 

 Bhubaneswar, Sept. 6: The Simlipal tiger reserve may be heading the Sariska way.

 The Dehra Dun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII), which has been doing a habitat analysis of all tiger reserves in the country since January, has said in a preliminary report that the tiger count in the Orissa park is disappointingly low.

 The park accounts for half the number of tigers in the state.

 The state wildlife department had, however, put the number at 101 tigers in its latest census in 2004, though only 11 sightings were made in the 2,750-sq-km area. 

 Tiger census in Simlipal is carried out every two years.

 Sources who were part of the WII study said the number sighted by the team was so low that it should start ringing alarm bells.

 The numbers we found are far below what the census has been showing up all these years, a source said, though Syed Ainul Hussain, an ecologist with the Dehra Dun-based institute and a key member of the habitat study, refused to confirm the findings.

 Lala Ashwini Kumar Singh, a senior research officer in the office of the chief wildlife warden here, expressed displeasure over the way the WII team conducted the study. Tigers are not meant to be seen. They are tuned by evolutionary process to avoid human beings. Otherwise they would be killed, Singh said.

 They didnt take into account the pug mark method of counting and instead relied on physical sightings by forest guards. But the pug mark method is the best for Simlipal, Singh, who was associated with the tiger census in Simlipal between 1987 and 2002, said.

 Till date, the Simlipal reserve has been counting tigers by the pug mark method.

 The WII study has confirmed what wildlife activists have been alleging. The activists, concerned that sightings have been rare, say that in the past 15 years, the state wildlife department has been doing a juggling act to keep the tiger population between 93 and 99.

 The census is manipulated through liberal duplication of pug casts. There is a high chance of double counting and, worse, even deliberate falsification in this method, said activist Biswajit Mohanty.

 The CBI report on Sariska submitted early this year said the tiger population at the Rajasthan national park was grossly exaggerated.

 Between 1995 and 2003, official estimates said the park had 24-28 tigers. In 2004, the number was said to be between 16 and 18, though no tiger has been sighted since September 2004. The CBI report prompted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up a task force to undertake reforms.

 The team from Dehra Dun, which began the habitat analysis in Simlipal in the wake of the Sariska row, would come back in October for a final survey.

 In January, the team asked the forest guards how many tigers they saw and interpolated the data on a Global Information System (GIS) map of the reserve. In October, the team would collect pug mark data to arrive at a realistic figure.

 The comptroller and auditor general of India, which recently released a report on conservation and protection of tigers in reserves, however says the pug mark method is not considered a foolproof methodology by experts.

 The CAG, which cast doubts over tiger census figures, pointed out that other techniques like camera trapping, DNA analysis of scratch marks on trees, evidence of breeding, direct sighting and radio telemetry were not adopted during tiger censuses.

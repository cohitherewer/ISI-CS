 Mass health insurance proposal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: The government will join hands with the private sector to introduce health insurance for the masses.

 We are planning a health insurance policy on the public-private model, but it is yet to take off, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss told a national summit on public health initiatives organised by industry chamber Assocham.

 Ramadoss said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has expressed concern over the rising expenses on health and the ministry is working out the right model.

 Health spendings are rising, but there is no universal insurance scheme in the country.This is an area expected to grow in another four-five years, he said. 

 At present, a paltry 2-3 per cent of the Indian population is insured despite the escalating expenditure on health.

 We have to involve the private sector in our initiatives so that they share more responsibilities. We have to sit and work out some model and focus on some key areas, he added.

 The Centre will also introduce a law to register all healthcare infrastructure in the country by May 2007.

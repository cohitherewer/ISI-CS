The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Organ transplant hub hits space jam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city?s first organ transplant hospital, to be commissioned in two years in New Town, will be much smaller than what was originally planned. Work on the Rs 175-crore project of the Hyderabad-based Global Hospitals group will start by the middle of this year.

 ?We had sought 20 acres to set up a seven-tower hospital, but the government has so far given us three acres,? surgical gastroenterologist K. Ravindranath, managing director of Global Hospitals, said on Friday. He will approach chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for more land, and any expansion will depend on what the government decides, he added.

 Space constraint has forced the group to scrap the proposed stem cell research centre and training institute for organ transplant from the plan. The number of beds, too, has been cut from 750 to 350.

 However, later in the evening, the chief minister stepped in with an assurance that the group would get the desired acres. ?I need to look into the details. He (Ravindranath) will get whatever he wants,? Bhattacharjee told Metro at another programme.

 According to the original plan, the hospital was to have dedicated units for gastroenterology (with liver transplant facilities), cardio-thoracic ailments (with heart transplant facilities), nephrology and urology, haematology, ophthalmology (with retinal transplant facilities) and stem cell harvest and research.

 Staff quarters, a hotel, malls, guest houses, and helipad were also planned. ?We have spoken to many non-resident Indians, who are experts in transplant techniques. They are all eager to come to Calcutta and work full-time in the hospital,? Ravindranath said. Efforts are also on to rope in doctors from All-India Institute of Medical Sciences and PGI, Chandigarh.

 Of the proposed seven towers, only three will be built now and the clinical sections will start operation first.

 Ravindranath, who has long been nursing an idea to set up a hospital in Calcutta, had once thought of focussing on Mumbai after being frustrated by Bengal?s infamous red tape. The chief minister persuaded him to change his mind. 

 On Friday, the hospital inaugurated its telemedicine and information clinic.

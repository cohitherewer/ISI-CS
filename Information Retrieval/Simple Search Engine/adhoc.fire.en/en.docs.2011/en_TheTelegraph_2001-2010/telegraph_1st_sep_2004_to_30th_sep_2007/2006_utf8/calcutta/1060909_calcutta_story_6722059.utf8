Tom raises a toast

Stage and swig make very odd companions. When God 

Says Cheers!, hosted by the Mumbai-based Two Plus Productions at Saturday 

Club to mark the launch of Haywards Black beer last weekend, drove home the point 

once more. A little after 7 on Saturday evening, Bollywood actor Tom Alter took 

the stage as God, dressed in a brown jacket, for a hilarious chat with Cyrus Dastur, 

who played just another man.

With a dash of wry humour, the conversation between 

God and Cyrus in a pub, with God stealing sips from Cyruss beer, veered from 

omnipotence to poverty and corruption, ambition and ones purpose in life.

Both Alter and Cyrus, who also directs the play, tried 

hard to keep out the noise of hushed chatter, the tinkle of beer bottles, the 

ring of a cell phone and the banging of a door every time a waiter sauntered in.

For the Calcutta audience, this was yet another brush 

with pub theatre, which is now common in Mumbai. We do the best we can under 

such circumstances, admitted Alter, after the play. We have done this play in 

the proscenium, at clubs, pubs and hotels. And we have doing it for more than 

two years.

The script, written by Anurag Kashyap of Satya 

and Shool fame, mentions Haywards Black more than once, and Alter 

explained that names of liquor brands are inserted whenever they agree to sponsor 

a show.

Alter, who last came to town with And Now She Says 

Shes God!!! and the same team, is busy with more interesting projects back 

on the Mumbai stage. He stars in a solo act on the life of Maulana Azad, in chaste 

Urdu. The play titled Maulana Azad has won him rave reviews.

Theres another play on the life of KL Saigal where 

I am playing the narrator. We plan to bring it to Calcutta sometime in December. 

It is written by Sayeed Alam, who has also written Maulana, said Alter. 

Then there is his own production Trisanga, a collage of poetry in Urdu, 

Hindi and English weaving in a host of things from Swami Vivekananda to Mahabharata.

Shellshocked

Calcutta is in for a contemporary interpretation of 

Sukumar Rays Laxmaner Shaktishel (or Laxman Shellshocked) on September 

11, 7 pm, when The Performers Wing stages it at Gyan Manch. Performers Wing 

has switched to Bengali in an attempt to bridge the divide between the audiences 

of English and Bengali theatre in Calcutta.

Leading them is Joyraj Bhattacharjee, 27, making his 

directorial debut. Bhattacharjee, who topped his roles in Chetana and Suman 

Mukherjees film Herbert with a commendable performance as Francis Flute 

in the Tim Supple production of A Midsummer Nights Dream, feels this could 

be a way to revitalise the fare, from Gyan Manch to Academy.

The theatre audience here is at best people who watched 

or participated in theatre in the 1970s. Young people, even in my age group, dont 

come to watch plays unless they are into theatre themselves. There also exists 

this amazing gap between English and Bengali plays, says Joy. 

Reinterpreting Sukumar Rays classic text had long 

been a wish for Joy. I could never read Laxmaner Shaktishel without seeing 

parallels with the contemporary times.

The text has not been changed and all the old humour 

is there. Maybe Sukumar Ray never intended the text to be read this way but there 

are satirical elements and the epic war is seen as a childish farce.

The stage will resemble a military camp; Rabon Raja 

will be dressed as a WWF wrestler, there will be a tower on stage and the vanarsena 

will wear khaki shorts and white T-shirts reminding audiences of both the 

army and the RSS!

The celebrated songs of the play will not change but 

the accompanying music will be modern, with pink and blue psychedelic lights turning 

the stage into a rock concert floor.

The actors, students of Jadavpur University and Presidency 

College, include Abhijay Gupta, Yagnaseni Das, Inam Hossain Mullick, Parni Ray, 

Ritam Sengupta, Rohini Chaki, Prodipta Sarkar, Sahana Bose, Sukanya Chakrabarti, 

Dana Roy, Uttaran Dasgupta and Prodipta Sarkar.

Abhijay Gupta with others will execute the sets, lighting 

will be by Sumit Chakraborty all under the guidance of production managers Aditya 

Bikram Das and Trina Nileena Banerjee.

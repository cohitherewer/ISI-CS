The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 JU balks at added load

 - CU seeks to transfer affiliates, Rabindra Bharati ready

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 An overburdened Calcutta University (CU) is eager to transfer affiliations of some of its colleges to other city universities. While Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) is willing to play ball, Jadavpur University (JU) could well play spoilsport.

 The CU officials placed the proposal at a meeting between Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and representatives of the three universities at Raj Bhavan on Tuesday. 

 The RBU officials were ready to take on the extra load, but JU representatives rejected the proposal on grounds of quality control.

 Vice-chancellor S.K. Sanyal of JU, however, was more circumspect on Wednesday. ?It is an important matter and needs to be discussed at various levels. Only then will we be in a position to express our stand,? he said.

 Currently, 161 colleges are affiliated to CU, excluding about 20 B.Ed and four law colleges. About 100 of these colleges are in the city. 

 The proposal calls for JU to take over the affiliation of the CU colleges in South 24-Parganas. The affiliates in North 24-Parganas are to be transferred to RBU, according to the pitch.

 ?We are willing to take over the affiliation of CU colleges in North 24-Parganas because we have a full-fledged controller of examinations department to hold undergraduate examinations,? said RBU vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee.

 ?The undergraduate education workload is increasing every year due to a rise in the number of students in our affiliated colleges,? explained Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), CU.

 ?We are forced to spend most of our time organising undergraduate examinations. This must stop if our university has to excel in postgraduate education and research and compete with other reputed universities,? he added.

 The CU officials urged the governor to take up the matter with the state government. 

 According to them, both JU and RBU have the infrastructure to take on several affiliate colleges.

 Currently, JU has two affiliated institutions and the RBU one. The state government will have to amend their acts to allow them to take on the CU affiliates.

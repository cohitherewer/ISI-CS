 This is the citys latest Mecca for music lovers whether they are looking out for a Roland casio, a Fender guitar or the latest DJ kit. On 8 Lenin Sarani, next to a new Music World outlet, stands Musik Messe, offering an entire gamut of installed sound, pro-audio and pro-light equipment.

 Set up by a trio of city-based enthusiasts Bobby, Clement Gomes and Rahul Bose, the store is spread over 1,100 sq ft and done up in vibrant shades of yellow and orange. Its inauguration on Sunday afternoon disclosed a wide range of musical instruments like the keyboard, synthesisers, piano, drums, acoustic guitars and sound cards on display on the mezzanine floor. You can choose from imported brands like Peavey, Roland, Ibanez, Fender, L amp;C, Yamaha, Korg, Edirol and M-Audio. 

 On the ground floor, there is a play zone complete with equipment on one side and speakers on another. We have everything in the store for someone who wants to put together a pub, except for liquor, smiles Clement. 

 so on offer are laser show systems including moving heads, scanners, fog machines and smart gobos that are all different kinds of light equipment, found usually above and on the dance floor in most discotheques. 

 Prices start from Rs 15,000 and go up to Rs 70,000 for lights, while speakers are priced from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1,00,000 for a pair. Installation and hiring services are available for malls, pubs, restaurants, office conference rooms, private parties and concerts in options of two way round and square ceiling speakers with a woofer and tweeter, column and fashion speakers. 

 Some of the projects in the past operating from Roland Pro Music, Bobbys first venture into the retail market, include Ego lounge at The Peerless Inn, Ginger restaurant at Hazra, sound installation at the next door Music World and conferencing of big companies like Tata. The client list also boasts percussionist Bikram Ghosh and popular bands like Lakkhichhara, Krosswindz, Fossils, Bhoomi and Cactus. The scale of power output offered is as per demand, from as low as 5,000 watts to as high as 50,000 watts!

 Shure, AKG and Audio Technica microphones are also on offer besides a fairly new concept of garden speakers in interesting shapes of toadstools and rocks priced between Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000. Fashion speakers are another interesting option, which are basically speakers within a picture frame, so that a pub or restaurant need not look cluttered with visible speakers and amplifiers. We are even planning to focus on the home theatre in the near future, says Rahul. The USP of the outlet is a portable DJ system in the Visa260 range under the brand of SoundX and higher power models like Peavey and JBL. No other store in Calcutta offers a portable DJ system, adds Bobby.

 l purchases come with a years warranty, service back-up and free delivery, including in north-east India.

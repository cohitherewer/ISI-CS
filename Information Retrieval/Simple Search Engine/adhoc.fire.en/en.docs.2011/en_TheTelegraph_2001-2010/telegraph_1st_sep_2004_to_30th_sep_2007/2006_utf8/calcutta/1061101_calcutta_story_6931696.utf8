 The puja fever may have died down in the rest of Bengal, but it has just started spreading in Hashimnagar and Baneshwarpur. For, the autumnal festivity in these two villages in Falta, South 24-Parganas, begins late, with Jagaddhatri puja which kicked off in the area on Tuesday.

 With as many as 27 pujas lined up in the adjacent villages, no wonder they are collectively called Chandernagore II. And like in the traditional Jagaddhatri bastion, the puja in Hashimnagar and Baneshwarpur, too, continues for six days.

 Hashimnagar Yuva Goshthis puja is the oldest at 36 years, said club secretary Deb Mondol. The pandal has been constructed beside a pond near the thakurtala, under a huge tree. The idol is 16 ft tall.

 The club with 100 members has raised around Rs 55,000. The main draw is a fair, and there will also be cultural programmes.

 Baneshwarpurs New Young Fighter Club is worshipping a 25-ft idol on its silver jubilee year. The clubs budget is around Rs 1.42 lakh, while the expenditure on lighting has been estimated at Rs 22,000. When I started the puja 25 years ago, the budget was a meagre Rs 746, said Indrajit Maiti, president of the club.

 The club has also prepared a smaller idol for immersion carrying the 25-ft one to the river will be difficult. The immersion will be followed by a community feast.

 The pandal of Baneshwarpur Yuva Samaj is made of bamboo, said club secretary Sandip Mondol.

 The villages remain abuzz with music and excited voices for all six days. It is Chandernagore II with respect to the number of people the pujas draw, said Prabir Dutta Majumdar, a local resident.

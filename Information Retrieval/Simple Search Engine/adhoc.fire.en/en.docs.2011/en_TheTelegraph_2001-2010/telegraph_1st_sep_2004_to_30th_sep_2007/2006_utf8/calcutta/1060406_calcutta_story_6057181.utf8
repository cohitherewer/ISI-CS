 Smoking kills the kidneys

 KINSUK BASU

 The heart and the lungs are not the only organs in danger due to smoking. Those who can?t stay without their puff need to get their kidneys examined as well.

 According to city-based nephrologists, an increasing number of middle-aged executives are turning up at clinics with problems that seem to stem from their smoking habit.

 While the lungs and the heart are the known casualties of smoking, the kidneys also appear to bear the brunt of every puff. This, despite experts claiming that there is no direct link between smoking and the functioning of one of the most vital organs of the body.

 ?It hits you gradually and by the time you realise the cause of your problems, it?s often too late. Intake of nicotine over the years brings about micro-vascular changes in the arteries connected with the kidneys. As a result, the blood-flow is affected,? stated doctor Abhijit Tarafdar of SSKM Hospital.

 He continued: ?This, in turn, can result in sclerosis of the kidneys. By the time a patient wakes up to the damage, the kidneys have already taken a beating.?

 With the arteries shrinking (atherosclerosis), a smoker can even develop progressive ischaemia, leading to renal failure.

 Studies have corroborated that along with the lungs and the heart, smoking affects the kidneys and the spleen by cutting down the production of monoamine oxidase-B, an enzyme that breaks down some neurotransmitters in the body. This causes the blood pressure to shoot up, which takes a toll on the kidneys.

 ?There are no tell-tale signs of kidneys being affected. But one thing is for sure ? if someone below 40 has a high blood pressure, then it is imperative for him to go for a kidney check-up,? asserted V.V. Laxmi Narayan of Apollo Gleneagles. 

 Nephrologists are of the opinion that those who are obese are at a greater danger, since their kidneys are likely to be affected even more owing to the complexities caused by extra weight. For instance, obesity can enhance the presence of protein in urine or lipo-protein glomerulopathy.

 ?Nicotine has been known to increase hydrostatic pressure in the kidney?s filtering unit, the glomerulus. Hike in glomerulus hydrostatic pressure has been recognised as a precursor to kidney problems,? Tarafdar explained. 

 The increasing level of awareness has prompted a number of people in the high-income group to undergo surgery to cut down on their weight, said doctors.

 Schools? monitor opts out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government has failed in its attempt to revive the committee set up to suggest ways to monitor the functioning of CBSE and ICSE schools.

 At its first meeting on Thursday since the Assembly polls, the 13-member panel decided not to proceed further till the government came up with an alternative method of collecting data on the schools.

 The panel?s practice of culling information ? by sending questionnaires to the schools ? has met with a poor response.

 Sources said the committee would submit a report to the government, stating its inability to continue functioning. 

 ?The procedure of collecting information about the schools by sending them questionnaires is faulty. Keeping the students? interests in mind, it?s difficult for the government to take action against defiant institutions,? said panel chairman Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, who is also commissioner in the school education department. ?We have to find an alternative method.?

 Till March 31, the initial deadline for the panel to submit its report, only 10 of the 340-odd CBSE and ICSE schools in the state had sent in their replies. Over the past month, 26 more schools have followed suit. ?But the figure is still too small, compared with the total number of schools,? Biswas said.

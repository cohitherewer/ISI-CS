The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Sachin Tendulkar

 Striking in appearance, you have phenomenal charm. You are a lively conversationalist and can impress people easily. You tend to make promises you can?t always keep. You are very sympathetic to social causes, and can really work hard for them. Although you are highly emotional, you are reluctant to show your feelings. ? Kusum Bhandari

 The party just grows bigger

 Calcutta has really learnt to party, party hard and party long. With the party people in town staying out later than even their Mumbai counterparts, those catering to the crowd are scrambling to keep pace with novel sights and new sounds. So, 2006 is all about taking the party experience a step further.

 Motto 

 According to Bunty Sethi, who sparked it all with Anti-clock and Winning Streak, offering something new will be the New Year clubbing mantra. ?You have to be a different player to gain a foothold in this crowded market. Get noticed, consistently maintain quality and there?s no stopping a new nightclub doing great business.?

 With partying now a habit, price sensitivity is fast becoming a thing of the past. ?Prices won?t matter anymore ? as long as you are delivering the goods right,? adds Bunty.

 Also, the ideas need to be rocking. While they could be a little gimmicky, but there is no room to ?fool around?. For, the party people mean serious business.

 Sound

 The music makers are set to make this a year to remember, with super international sounds, very ?with it? musical leanings and the zeal to teach the crowd to groove. The agenda is quite something, but so is the action plan. DJ Girish feels 2006 is definitely going to be a big year for dance. ?Bollywood as always will be huge but the difference will be noticed in the Hip Hop genre. It assumes a new avatar with Reggaeton and the two-step Hip Hop. Electro-house is surely going to dominate the clubbing scene,? feels Girish.

 So while we bid bad remixes goodbye, you must watch out for divas like Madonna and Shania Twain as they make a comeback. 

 Also, just standing there and shaking a leg will be a no-no with Calcuttans all geared up to dance all night, and dance it right. ?With Latino dance forms making waves, the regular party goer is ready to try out newly-acquired dance moves on the floor,? adds Girish.

 Address

 The party pitch too promises to grow. At least three new night spots are scheduled to hit the floor this year.

 The action starts off with the launch of Bunty?s 11,000 sq ft nightclub Venom on the eighth floor of Fort Knox at 6, Camac Street. Also coming up at Venom are a restaurant and the city?s first Ice Bar.

 The other big bang comes in the summer of 2006. With cutting-edge technology, high-profile fashion shows and parties, and lots of visual imagery, F-Bar and Lounge will open its Calcutta doors. ?The work on the interiors is on and we are trying to open the place fast. The chilling out curve in the city is on the rise and we want to cash in,? says P.C. Rao, Calcutta operator.

 A brand extension of Fashion TV, the bar and lounge is coming up on 11/1, Sarat Bose Road, the space that previously housed The Golden Harvest and China Valley restaurants.

 Marrakesh, the lounge bar housed inside the posh Cinnamon restaurant on Park Street, is also slated to open its doors in January. The 2,000 sq ft lounge is inspired by and themed on Morocco.

 Weeks ahead of the big one, a smaller book fair is drawing crowds at the Nandan complex. Organised by the Publishers and Booksellers Guild for the second consecutive year, the fair is meant to cater exclusively to children.

 And it is not just the books and CDs on display. From the Fairytale-themed decorations to the stalls selling cotton candy and the songs being played on the loudspeaker ? everything is meant to appeal to the little ones.

 ?Apart from daily contests like spot-painting, origami and quiz, we have been holding film shows daily for children for free at Nandan II. The films include Damu, Alibaba, Aparajito, Dakater Hathe Bulu and Iqbal. Plus, every day, for two to three hours, the makeshift stage, called ?Byangoma Byangomir Desh?, is open for performances. There are no restrictions, children can present whatever they like,? said Sourav Bagchi, one of the organisers.

 Sourav and his fellow organisers, all under 30, represent the GeNext of publishing, whose sole aim is to give children a separate space to browse and choose their books, away from the chaos of the main book fair. Sourav hails from the family of PM Bagchi, Srijeet from Best Books, Shubhankar from Dey?s Publishing, Pinkai from Deb Sahitya Kutir, Pradip from Bharati Books and Vicky from Timely Book House.

 There are about 25 participants, including Chhotoder Kochipata, Anandam, Visva-Bharati, Daksha Bharati, Papyrus and more. The response so far ? the fair got underway on December 31, 2005 ? has not been that impressive. Last year the fair recorded a daily footfall of about 50,000. ?We had started around Christmas but this time around, the grounds weren?t free. Even then, the turnout was about 40,000 till January 1. It has fallen as many schools have reopened,? said Sourav.

 Those manning the stalls also agreed that sales had been better last year. What?s selling this year, they pointed out, are drawing books and titles on science, geography and history.

 Adults, who often make the purchase decisions for the kids, don?t seem to be giving much thought to fantasy or fairy tales. But they also emphasised that the presentation quality of storybooks ? particularly Bengali titles ? has to improve to attract the children. A special offering from the fair organisers is a booklet of various classic tales and rhymes in their original and complete forms, with illustrations. Gleaned from archives, that alone is worth a trip to the Nandan complex. The fair is on till January 5.

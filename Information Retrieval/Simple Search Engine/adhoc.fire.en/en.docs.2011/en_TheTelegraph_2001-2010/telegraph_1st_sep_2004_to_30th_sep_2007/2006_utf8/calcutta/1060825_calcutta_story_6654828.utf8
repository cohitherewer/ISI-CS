The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The lad with the lamp

 Having a blast with his kids at Darlington in north-east England, director SUJOY GHOSH tells Pratim D. Gupta about his new film where Amitabh plays genie Genius to Riteishs Aladdin Chatterjee

 Sujoy Ghosh

 Located in the north-east of England is the town of Darlington. Best known for the Rhythm amp; Brews Festival and the Darlington Dog Race, this uniquely unspectacular place is the second home of Mr Jhankaar Beats himself, Sujoy Ghosh. Making the most of the break from Mumbai, Sujoy is chilling out with his kids and spinning another celluloid web.

 And if M. Night Shyamalan made a film out of his bedtime story for his children, Sujoy is all set to retell the evergreen Arabian Nights story of Aladdin in a big Bollywood format. Its my version of the story, Sujoy says over phone from his UK abode. Around 40 per cent of the storyline is same as that of the original. I have just spun a modern tale around it. Its very much a childrens film but the adults should also enjoy it. It will be in the same genre as the Harry Potter movies.

 The whole idea of turning the Aladdin tale into a modern-day Bollywood yarn came from Sujoys urge to write a screenplay out of a story. I am not a story writer, I am a screenplay writer, he explains. When I wrote my first two scripts, I figured out that I was writing screenplay-based stories and not story-based screenplays. If its a Jhankaar Beats, it works. If its a Home Delivery, it doesnt. So, this time I wanted to start with a story and what better one than Aladdin?

 Riteish and Sanjay 

 Dutt lock horns in Aladdin

 But more than the story or the screenplay it is the casting of Aladdin and the Mystery of the Lamp that will make heads turn. While Riteish has been cast as Aladdin Chatterjee yes, hes a Bengali the role of the genie, Genius in Sujoys world, will be played by Amitabh Bachchan. He just liked the feel of the whole thing when I narrated the script to him, says Sujoy. 

 It was a very numbing yet uplifting experience when he agreed to be a part of my film, he says in the same breath. Come on, hes the reason I am in the industry, I have grown up on him. He initially wanted me to go back and work more on the script. Thats fair enough. If you want the best, you have to show him the best. And it also pushes me that extra mile.

 A couple of years back, Sujoy had planned another film with Bachchan called Borivali which never worked out. It was a thriller set in a future Mumbai, he reveals. I had initially imagined it with Mr. Bachchan and Naseerji. Then with Mr. Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt.

 Dutt is in the Aladdin film, too. Hes the counterpart of the genie, Sujoy offers. You can call him an antagonist. His character is more of an analogy to the character of Joker in Batman. He has his own backstory and why he is doing what he is doing.

 The project was initially planned as an AB Corp production but while AB himself is very much a part of the cast, it is not being produced by his company. Rohan Sippys RS Entertainment will back Sujoys Aladdin and the Mystery of the Lamp. 

 Rohan has a certain amount of faith in me and more importantly we speak the same language, says Sujoy. To be honest I didnt have a lot of choices. Also, Mr. Bachchan is very comfortable with Rohan on board. So, it will be a happy environment to work in, with everyone seriously believing in the project. Because for a film like this, a lot of midnight oil has to be burnt.

 Amitabh Bachchan will play 

 a modern-day genie 

 And thats mostly because of the visual extravaganza Sujoy wants to create on screen. I have always believed that cinema should be visually exciting, he explains. It should take you to a new level. Even Jhankaar Beats, which had no special effects, created a world where the audiences have never been before. For Aladdin..., I am planning to hire an international special effects team to make the film at par with the best in the world. It should be visually striking. Nahole to shobai radio shunte pare.

 When Alladin was a very small project, Sujoy was actually planning to shoot the movie in Calcutta and had even come to the city to scout locations. But now with the Sippys coming on board and Amitabh Bachchan heading the cast, Sujoy has to look elsewhere. We are looking at a lot of options, from the UK to northern India, he reveals. We plan to start the film some time next year because this will take some detailed post-production before we go on the sets.

 While his other crew is yet to be decided, Sujoy favourites Vishal-Shekhar, whose Pancham tributes punctuated Jhankaar Beats, will again score the music. 

 And Aladdin and his Genius friend can trigger off yet another kids movie franchise after Krrish. I find franchises very boring, says Sujoy. But if this film works and people love the characters, then maybe, we will have to make more films with them.

 Right now, though, its all about soaking in the lovely British weather in Darlington. I am just having a ball with my kids and also writing a graphic novel with Indian characters, signs off Sujoy.

 Offering an incisive study of complex human psychology, Megh (written by Utpal Dutt) lays bare the crisis of humanity in modern, urban civilisation. It unfolds the sombre saga of its schizophrenic protagonist, Samaresh Sanyal. Sensitive by nature, he has lost his sanity and his faith in mankind, having been betrayed in love. His extreme disillusionment leads him to begin writing thrillers, instead of classics. He decides to write a story in which the murderer commits a perfect crime, leaving no clues, and is portrayed as a real hero. This seems to be Sanyal?s way of expressing his total disgust with the prevailing social order. His writings urge thinking people to disrupt and destroy the present system, so that a new society can be built in its place. His belief in his theory is so strong that he even kills Sujata, his former lover. Finally, he realises that violence and hatred cannot be the means of combating social evils; an agreeable social synthesis can be achieved only through restoration of faith and love. Direction: Anish Ghosh.

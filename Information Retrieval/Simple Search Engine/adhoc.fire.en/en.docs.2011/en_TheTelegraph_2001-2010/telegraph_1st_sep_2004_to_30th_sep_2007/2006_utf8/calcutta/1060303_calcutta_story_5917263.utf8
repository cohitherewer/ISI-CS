 What: Launch of Jewel Co store at Vaibhav Plaza.

 Where: 4, Lee Road on the first floor, shop number 125. 

 When: Thursday morning. 

 Take a look: After a successful stint at Hotel Hindusthan International, Jewel Co has opened its second showroom, giving jewellery lovers in Calcutta a new destination to hop over to. 

 The showroom displays a wide array of jewellery ? neckpieces, danglers, ear studs and bracelets ? that can be accessorised with Westerns as well as traditional wear. 

 Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, blue sapphire and a host of semi-precious stones have been set in gold and white gold to form designs that are a fine mesh of floral and abstract patterns. 

 Dew-shaped stones embedded in a spiral crust or thick chains accentuated with ornate pendants with matching earrings are some of the eye-catching pieces on show. Long stone-crusted danglers and ear studs reveal a fusion of traditional and contemporary motifs. 

 A collection of dainty rings is also on offer, the most arresting designs being broad bands with flower and pyramid-shaped motifs. 

 Those with a penchant for linear patterns can opt for simple pieces embedded with small stones. 

 The store has plans of opening up a few more outlets in the next two years. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 10,000.

 Voiceover: This is an effort to make ourselves easily available to our customers. Our designs are not copies of catalogues and will appeal to women of all age groups, assures proprietor Pratap Lodha.

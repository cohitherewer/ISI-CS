 Bhaichung Bhutia took a break from football practice on the eve of a big match to appear before Howrah court ? not once, but twice ? after being slapped with a witness warrant of arrest.

 The East Bengal star, who was warming up with his team at Howrah Corporation Stadium ahead of Saturday?s showdown with Mohun Bagan, was granted bail on a personal release bond of Rs 200. The Howrah court instructed Bhaichung to appear again on May 20.

 The Indian soccer captain had earlier failed to appear, despite several summons, and a few weeks ago, had informed the court that his National Football League commitments would force yet another no-show, in a lost bag case registered by him three years ago.

 Bhaichung had lost a suitcase on the Howrah-Bangalore Express on October 31, 2002, and had lodged an FIR with the Shalimar GRP on July 1, 2003. Police had retrieved his bag and arrested Harekrishna Gharai in this connection.

 The court had issued the warrant on Thursday to ensure Bhaichung?s presence in court on May 20, to identify the bag and testify in the case.

 At 10.30 am, Bhaichung, accompanied by East Bengal officials, appeared before the court of the first judicial magistrate Sadhan Mandal, who had issued the warrant for contempt of court.

 ?His ignorance about legal procedures has led to this incident,? said Bhaichung?s lawyer Bidhan Chandra Ray, who applied for bail against the witness warrant of arrest on behalf of his client.

 The judge asked Bhaichung to return at 4 pm, when his bail plea would be considered.

 The star striker was called to the witness box when he appeared before the court for the second time and finally granted bail on the personal release bond.

 Public prosecutor Sunil Jana said if Bhaichung doesn?t appear on May 20 without providing a valid reason, he could face another witness warrant of arrest.

 ?I will go to court on May 20 and get back the suitcase I had lost four years ago,? Bhaichung told Metro late on Friday.

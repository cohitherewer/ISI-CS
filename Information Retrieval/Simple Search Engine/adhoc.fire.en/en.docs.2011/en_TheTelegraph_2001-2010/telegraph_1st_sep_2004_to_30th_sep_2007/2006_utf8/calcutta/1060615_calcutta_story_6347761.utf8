 A day after the stalemate over distribution of admission forms came to an end at Presidency College, the Independents? Consolidation (IC)-led students? union on Wednesday threatened a fresh agitation, demanding action against the Students? Federation of India (SFI) for its alleged attempt to terrorise students.

 Also on the agenda is a protest against the authorities? ?failure? to fill the post of assistant general secretary of the union?s executive committee.

 Principal Mamata Roy Choudhuri said she was unaware of any plans of the students? union to launch a fresh agitation. ?The admission process is on in full swing and I am not in a position to comment on the issue of filling up the assistant general secretary?s post. The situation is normal on campus.?

 IC leaders alleged that the authorities are turning a blind eye to the terror tactics being pursued by SFI ever since it was trounced in the union election in January. 

 ?The SFI is creating an atmosphere of fear on campus,? said Anirban Mondal, a students? union leader. ?They are not allowing us to function properly. We have lodged several complaints with the authorities over the past six months, but nothing has been done. We have no alternative but to start an agitation.?

 Trouble over distribution of admission forms, Mondal pointed out, was just one manifestation of SFI?s ?high-handedness?.

 On filling up the vacant post, union leaders said the administration was dragging its feet in resolving the issue.

 The post could not be filled up during the January poll because of a tie between the SFI and IC candidates. A series of clashes and other untoward incidents rocked the campus, as both sides alleged foul play.

 The authorities finally set up a fresh panel for the post. But the stalemate continued, as the SFI alleged the panel was illegal.

 Academic activities resumed only after the administration announced that it would set up a committee by February 15 to suggest ways how to fill up the post.

 IC and SFI leaders both complained on Wednesday that the authorities have not taken any step to set up the committee.

 ?The charges IC is levelling against us are baseless,? said SFI leader Nilabhra Bhowmick. ?As for the assistant general secretary?s post, we are urging the authorities to take steps and appoint the panel.?

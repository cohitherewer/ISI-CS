 Standstill in human sea

 The entire traffic system in and around the city came to a grinding halt and remained immobile for hours as the CPM kick-started its Assembly poll campaign on Brigade Parade Ground on Sunday.

 All major roads and flyovers were blocked by buses, mini-trucks and other vehicles carrying party workers from all over the state. The traffic jams were mainly caused by party supporters who deluged Vidyasagar Setu, the Park Street and AJC Bose Road flyovers and Bijon Setu on their way to and from the rally spot in the heart of the city. 

 Heavy vehicles remained stranded on flyovers and their approach roads for hours. Commuters faced the same fate. Private buses ferried a deluge of CPM cadre.

 ?What can we do? So many people are walking down these roads and we are being forced to stop these vehicles to avoid major accidents,? said a Calcutta Police sergeant manning the Chowringhee crossing.

 Two CPM workers fell from a bus. They were admitted to SSKM Hospital.

 Claiming that the situation ?never spun out of control?, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim conceded that the traffic system was disrupted on Kidderpore and Alipore sectors, SN Banerjee Road, AJC Bose Road and CR Avenue.

 ?All those roads witnessed medium to high traffic jams from 1.30 pm to around 5 pm. After 6 pm, the system reverted to the normal Sunday crowd,? Shamim said.

 The Bengal Bus Syndicate (BBS) alleged that CPM cadre had forcefully taken over private buses to carry them to the rally site. ?On Sundays, about 6,500 private buses ply in the city and its peripheries. Today, the CPM appropriated over 80 per cent of them,? said Swarna Kamal Saha, president, BBS.

 Home shift for lunatics in jail

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 Complying with a Supreme Court order, the state correctional services department will release 73 non-criminal lunatics from Alipore Special Jail by the end of July. 

 About a year ago, the Supreme Court had ruled that all non-criminal lunatics should be freed from jails and admitted to mental homes for treatment.

 The correctional services department has discussed the matter with the health department and identified two mental homes for housing the non-criminal lunatics from Alipore Special Jail.

 ?Most of the mentally-challenged people were taken into custody after they were found loitering on the street. We had to put them behind the bars as there are no special facilities or arrangements for the mentally-challenged,? said Alipore Special Jail superintendent Kamal Mukherjee.

 ?It was not difficult to keep the non-criminal lunatics in the jail. But at the mental homes, they would be provided treatment and medication. That might bring about some improvement in their condition. Moreover, as per the Supreme Court?s order, non-criminal lunatics cannot be kept in jail,? added Mukherjee.

 Of the 73 non-criminal lunatics in Alipore Special Jail, 50 will be sent to Behrampore Mental Hospital. The rest will head for Purulia, where they will be admitted to Institute for Mental Care. 

 ?The non-criminal lunatics have been languishing in jail for a long time for no fault of theirs. We wanted to shift them to mental homes long ago. But it took some time to make the arrangements. The inmates will definitely be shifted to the mental homes at Behrampore and Purulia in July,? asserted B.D. Sharma, inspector-general, correctional services.

 Once the mentally-challenged inmates of Alipore Special Jail are shifted, the department will focus on the non-criminal lunatics in the jails in the districts, said an official.

 The department also has plans to convert Alipore Special Jail into an all-women jail. 

 Women prisoners from Alipore Central jail and Presidency jail will be shifted there. It will be the first time the department will make an exclusive arrangement for women prisoners.

 ?We will turn Alipore Special Jail into a women?s jail. We are redesigning the facility and trying to make special arrangements for female inmates. Officials of the public works department are already on the job,? stated inspector-general Sharma.

 Currently, there are about 400 women prisoners in the state jails. The correctional services department, however, has not set a date for their transfer.

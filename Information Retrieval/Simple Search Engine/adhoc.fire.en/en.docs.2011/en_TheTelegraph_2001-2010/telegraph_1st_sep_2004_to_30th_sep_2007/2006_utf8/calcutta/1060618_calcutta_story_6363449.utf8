The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Look, my lucky charm

 When Sourav Ganguly?s precious Mangal Chandi locket went missing, it almost jeopardised his travel plans for a County season. The most successful Indian skipper struggling to make a comeback to Team India is no exception to the celebrity rule of swearing by a totem that they keep the closest and fear losing the most. Metro hunts down some other potent possessions, from toothbrush to ring

SABYASACHI MUKHERJEE, 

designer 

A toothbrush in his travel bag

There?s this battery-operated, vibrating toothbrush 

that I got as a gift a couple of years ago. I got it on my birthday and don?t 

even remember who gave it to me; must be one of my friends. But ever since, it 

has been an essential companion of mine wherever I have travelled. That maybe 

the only constant thing that I have carried wherever I have gone in the past two 

years. I fear losing it because not only have I got very used to it, I also consider 

it to be a good-luck charm. I would never travel anywhere for a show or an event 

without this particular toothbrush.

A ring mother gave her with a prayer

While I am not superstitious at all, I do always wear 

a particular ring on my finger. It was given to me by my mother around six years 

ago and I don?t remember a day I haven?t worn it since. My mother loves the fact 

that I wear it as she does all the praying for me. Although I do believe in God, 

I do not know ways to worship Him. So I just blindly follow my mother... I just 

want to keep wearing the ring.

actor

A Lokenath Baba locket, two stone-studded rings

I wear a chain with a Lokenath Baba locket. I have 

to take it off while shooting, but I always keep it with myself. I also wear two 

stone-studded rings given to me by my mother. I have developed a kind of fixation 

about them since my mother passed away and I have never taken them off though 

many people have told me that I don?t need those stones anymore. Also, I don?t 

attend the premiere shows of my films. It?s a kind of good-luck charm for me.

BAPPI LAHIRI, 

musician

A locket from mother that he refused Michael Jackson

I wear all my gods in lockets in gold chains. There 

are images of Tirupati Balaji, Ganapati, Hanumanji and Ramthakur. There?s another 

big locket with a Hare Krishna Hare Ram inscription that my mother had given me 

when I entered the film industry 32 years ago. Michael Jackson wanted to keep 

it once when I met him, but I did not part with it. Then there?s a stone-studded 

ring of Balaji that I always wear and another ring with my lucky stone. I am not 

going to reveal what it is. Rock star ZZ Top had once given me a gold ring that 

I wear unfailingly while performing on stage and giving interviews.

CELINA JAITLEY, 

actress

A locket of Durga to touch

While I have always tried not to be superstitious 

about anything material ? anything that has weight and occupies some space ? I 

do carry a locket of Durga with me all the time. It has been with me for the last 

10 years. I had got it in Calcutta. The locket is really very auspicious and I 

like to touch it every day before starting my day.

TAPAS PAL, 

actor-politician 

A maduli and a silver ring

I am not superstitious and I believe in God. I used 

to wear a chain with a locket of Lokenath Baba, but then I had to take it off 

during shooting and it was really inconvenient. Now, I wear a maduli around 

my neck and I have a weakness for it. I also wear a ring in silver that my father 

had given me. It has a sentimental value for me. I step out of the house after 

praying to Ma Kali and after a puja performed by my wife.

NAYANIKA CHATTERJEE, 

model 

A gold cat?s eye ring for all things great

My only prized possession is a gold cat?s eye ring. 

It?s known to ward off evil. It was a gift from my mother?s friend three years 

ago. I am extremely superstitious about it and I believe that the ring brings 

me good luck. My daughter was born around that time too, so I guess I keep attributing 

all the great things in my life to the ring. I am so paranoid about parting with 

it that I have never once taken it off my finger.

KOENA MITRA, 

actress

A picture of Ma Kali in her wallet 

Right from my childhood I have always worshipped Ma 

Kali. There are no proper Ma Kali temples here in Mumbai. Most are either Hanumanji 

or Krishna temples. So I carry a picture of Ma Kali of the Kalight idol 

 in my wallet and since you cannot travel without a wallet, it is always 

with me. But I would like to add that I do not want to believe its a lucky 

charm or something since that would make me weak. Then if I lose it, I will become 

like Sourav and get frantic. I truly believe that Ma Kali is there with me all 

the time.

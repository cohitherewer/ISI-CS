 Cashing in on experience effect

 - High-end sight-and-sound pushers add on environment to boost product sales

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The demo room at a Shakespeare Sarani store has proved very popular with prospective buyers

 From the outside, it?s just another consumer electronics shop. But step past the rows of microwave ovens and television sets at Channel 4, on Chakraberia Road, and tucked away inside is a 110 sq ft room with the look and feel of a lazy lounge bar. Cosy beanbags, fancy lighting and a choice of chai all add up to a great consumer experience and better sales.

 Experience is the keyword, as sight-and-sound product pushers scramble to pamper the customer. ?Adding an environment to the products is bringing in amazing footfall, much of which we are able to convert to actual buyers,? says Aditya Kothari of Channel 4.

 Cut to Promises on Shakespeare Sarani, which sells high-end music and home-theatre brands like Jamo and Onkyo. The store?s two-year-old 200-sq-ft demo room proved so popular with prospective buyers that owner Manoj Bhatia is setting up a separate room for audio now. ?The demo room has really helped me grow my business. Lot of people come to browse but end up making a purchase after the demo,? says Bhatia.

 From consumer electronics to telecom to DVD lending library, the Xperience factor is playing a big part in the plans of companies setting up new stores in the city or upgrading existing ones. Bose India, which opened its first outlet in Calcutta last month in City Centre, is planning a flagship store in the heart of the city, complete with its popular ?theatre show?, a 15-minute tech treat of Bose products, in a specially-created room. ?We?ll start the moment we get space,? says Nandita Sood of Bose India. Bose?s flagship outlets in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad all sport the special add-on that draws in a big crowd, Sood adds.

 At the Rowland Road outlet of Cinema Paradiso, the DVD lending library chain, members will be able to sample DVDs in 5.1 DTS sound in a 10-seater screening room, starting March. ?This is an additional service we?re providing,? says owner-cinematographer Santhosh.

 Airtel?s Mobile Technology Experience Centre in City Centre was opened for visitors to touch and feel products and services ? Live TV on Edge, SMS Appliance controlling system, Vehicle Tracking System and Touch Screen Kiosk ? based on the latest technology. Taking a cue from the Calcutta stop, which draws an average footfall of 50-60 per day, Airtel rolled out similar experience centres in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.

 Even if the add-ons require a few lakhs, those investing don?t seem to mind. ?I had to spend Rs 2 lakh on acoustics, lights, false ceiling, screen and high-end wiring, but the returns are much more,? offers Bhatia of Promises. 

 Agrees Cinema Paradiso?s Santhosh: ?The screening room would cost over Rs 5 lakh, but it?s a good investment.?

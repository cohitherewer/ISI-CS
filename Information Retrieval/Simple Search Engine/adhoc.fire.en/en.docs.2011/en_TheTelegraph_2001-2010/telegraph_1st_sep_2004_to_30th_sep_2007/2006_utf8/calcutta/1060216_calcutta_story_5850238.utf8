 The directive from the Election Commission to the 

 state government not to conduct any eviction drive in the 

 city or elsewhere before the Assembly elections is justified 

 (Eviction bar before polls, The City Diary, January 23). 

 Eviction on the eve of any election might create a host 

 of problems. 

 With the Assembly polls approaching, an eviction drive might result in displacement of many people on the electoral rolls. The displaced voters might not be able to exercise their right from their new address. 

 The Election Commission?s duty is not only to ensure free and fair polls everywhere, but also to see that genuine voters do not face any problem in exercising their right of suffrage without fear or favour. 

 The recent eviction of the squatters of the Gobindapur rail colony has already created such problems. Unless the settlers are registered as voters in the area they relocate to, they might not be able to vote in the coming elections. Political parties can take advantage of such a situation by indulging in false voting. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Apropos the report ?Blaze kills four siblings?, January 26, it is shocking that a woman lost her home and four children in a single night. There are perhaps no words that can console her. The night before the Tangra fire, there was a fire in Ultadanga. If these blazes are occurring due to improper storage of inflammable material, then there should be an inquiry by the fire brigade authorities. Such unfortunate incidents should not recur. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 It is painful to learn that four 

 children of a family perished in a devastating fire in Tangra. 

 Every year, several such blazes occur in the city, but the 

 services of the fire brigade, bereft of modern fire fighting 

 equipment, leave much to be desired. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

 It is horrendous that a few days 

 before Republic Day, shanties were gutted in a blaze on 

 Canal South Road. Calcutta has seen so many market, plazas, 

 businesses being set up over the past few years. But the 

 administration has failed miserably in providing the most 

 basic of services to the poor. There is much darkness under 

 the lamp. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge.

 The article ?Craters cripple city on move?, January 30, underscores the pathetic condition of the potholed roads in the city and their effect on the public. 

 The condition of the buses, especially the private buses and the minibuses, is also to be blamed. They are poorly built with hard seats, insufficient leg room, high footboards and poor suspension. The buses do little to offset the effect of bumps on the road. 

 The condition of the buses should be considered while issuing them permission to ply on the road. Otherwise, commuters will have no option but to continue risking serious injury to their spine. 

 N.S. Ramakrishnan, 

 EM Bypass.

 The way Srimanta Bhattacharya, 

 55, was thrown off balance when the minibus he was travelling 

 in drove into a crater on AJC Bose Road and how paralysis 

 set in a few days later must have sent a shiver down the 

 spine of most Calcuttans. Doctors have blamed jerky busrides 

 for the damage to Bhattacharya?s brain cells. This is a 

 glaring example of the crippling effect of the poorly-maintained 

 city roads. 

 Rash driving is also responsible for such injuries. Whenever a vehicle hits a crater and the driver applies the brakes, the spinal cords of the passengers have to absorb a lot of pressure. 

 Children and elderly people are the most vulnerable to such injuries. The civic authorities must immediately fill up the potholes fore the sake of the city residents. 

 Bhupen Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park.

 The report ?Girls fled from pressure?, January 25, draws attention to the tremendous pressure on the young generation. Many youngsters are pressured from all quarters ? parents, peers, teachers ? but find no one to share their anguish with. The feeling of being lonely and neglected ultimately forces them to either commit suicide or run away. 

 Unfortunately, the education system does not help much. Syllabi are bulky and the evaluation system unscientific. The only yardstick to gauge a student?s merit is the marks he has secured in examinations. The parents and teachers need to change the way they think to prevent more children from running away. I hope that the guardians of the three wannabe heroines will not scold them too severely for their faux pas, and encourage and inspire them instead. 

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati.

 Computerised voice response systems are set up to avoid disputes. In the name of ?helpline?, the organisation or company concerned tries to tactfully abstain from directly replying to any question (Helpline hurdle to dial a cop, January 31). Getting through the helpline of some organisations is so cumbersome that people stop approaching them for service. A direct phone number is much more helpful. 

 Once our maid had tried to blackmail us into paying her salary twice over. When she started getting abusive, my wife called the nearest police station on their direct line. The cops reached our house within 10 minutes. The woman had by then fled, but she was never seen in Salt Lake again. It would have been impossible for us to scare her away if we had to reach the cops through a helpline. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report ?Struggle for salary?, January 23, it is unfortunate that a primary school teacher had to run from pillar to post to be paid his proper salary. By refusing to release his dues, the education department is not only dishonouring the teacher but also the profession. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 It is worrying that an increasing number of 15-25 year olds are being found guilty of murder (Turnaround in murder tale, January 23). The lure of easy lucre is behind the incidents. 

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park.

 If the GoodLife Talk Show 

 series saw apartment residents and celebrity guest speakers 

 engaging in heart-to-heart deliberations on family, fashion 

 and fitness, its sequel Apartainment promises loads 

 of in-house entertainment.

 The Apartainment series began 

 with a bang on Sunday evening to a packed house at Ananda 

 Vihar apartment, on 26, Nagendranath Road. The age group 

 ranged from three to 60-year olds, as nobody wanted to give 

 this a miss.

 As resident Biswajit Das put it: 

 These are occasions when we apartment residents can 

 get together, socialise, build bonds and engage in fun activities.

 The fun session kicked off with 

 a sit-and-draw competition. Twenty two youngsters, from 

 age four to 12, gave colour and form to their imagination 

 for almost an hour. Heads huddled over white sheets, each 

 little artist focussed on his/her canvas with great care, 

 occasionally stealing a glance at the neighbours handiwork 

 and sharing a quick chit- chat.

 For most, the village landscape 

 was an inspiration thatched houses, the setting sun, lush 

 green trees and half-made roads. For the youngest among 

 the lot, it was all about butterflies, fish and eggs with 

 labels! 

 Dipti Jha, with her illustration 

 of fishermen with nets, stood first and bagged a trophy, 

 a cap and a TTIS badge, while Diksha Jha and Sanghamitra 

 Saha won mementos, caps and the TTIS badge. Some 

 consolation prizes were also given away. 

 Next up, Three Minutes To Fame. 

 Kids showcased their skills at dancing, singing, cracking 

 jokes and reciting poems. Moderator Pranam, with his friendly 

 banter, helped the 13 contestants introduce themselves to 

 the crowd. And the constant audience applause was a definite 

 confidence booster. Patriotic poems, English melodies, Rabindranritya, 

 Hindi recitals it was quite a mixed bag.

 The tiny singers had Anthony uncle 

 and his band to back them up. Contestants were judged on 

 personality, presentation and overall perfection. Sreejani 

 Chatterjee, who enthralled audiences with the song I 

 have a dream, walked away with the trophy, cap and TTIS 

 badge. I am very excited. My schoolteacher taught 

 me the song and I practised hard, smiled Sreejani. 

 Anwesha Majumdar and Amitesh Ray stood second and third 

 respectively. They walked away with mementos, caps and TTIS 

 badges.

 In between, you had the audience 

 racking their brains over a spot quiz as Pranam tested how 

 well the Ananda Vihar residents knew The Telegraph. Winners 

 walked away with The Telegraph badges.

 Finally, it was time for the Antakshari 

 round, with seven teams of three members each. The young 

 and the not-so-young had broken up into groups to battle 

 it out in the musical session. Pranam set the stage by asking 

 the audience to recognise a few songs.

 The first Antakshari round, Recognise 

 the Hindi Version of the Bengali Song, was intensely fought. 

 Next it was identifying the hero and singing one of his 

 songs. This proved easier. As Pranam belted out Pal pal 

 dil ke pas, pat came the team reply, Dharmendra, 

 and the team chorus went, Yeh dosti...

 The toughest of them all was the 

 Antara Mukhda round. But the teams were all well-prepared. 

 So, it was all about confident renditions of mere dil 

 ke chain seconds after the antara mere bahon se 

 nikalke stopped.

 At the end, it was Team H of Sukanya 

 Gupta, Runa Gupta and Mandira Gupta, that sang its way to 

 the champions trophy. 

 The memorable Sunday evening came 

 to an end with Pranam singing Sadher lau and residents 

 of Ananda Vihar matching steps with the popular folk song.

 Molest bid at soiree in hostel, 22 held

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A hostel soiree on Thursday night ended in a section of students trying to molest the performers and landing in jail. 

 Twenty-two students, some belonging to the final year, of West Bengal University of Fishery and Animal Sciences, have been arrested on charges of molestation and attempted rape and remanded in judicial custody till January 11.

 The soiree was organised at the university?s Macpherson Hostel, in Belgachhia, for the final-year students. 

 Around 70 students were enjoying the programme. After a few dance items, they suddenly turned violent and demanded that the girls on the stage perform a striptease.

 ?Five girls, including two minors, were performing when the students, some of them drunk, asked them to do a cabaret. As the girls refused, around 25 students jumped on to the stage and started stripping them,? deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Vineet Goyel said, quoting a complainant and victim, Tanushree Ghosh.

 The students then dragged the girls into a hostel room and locked them in for hours. 

 ?They even tried to rape some of the girls, but police intervened and rescued us. We are all shaken at the turn of events,? Ghosh said in her complaint.

 The students, however, denied the allegations. ?We had arranged for a musical night to bid farewell to the fifth-year students. A local dance troupe was contacted for a performance on the Macpherson Hostel compound. But the girls were performing badly and we protested, which led to a scuffle between some students and the male members of the troupe,? said Subhashish Sen, a postgraduate student of the university, who was present on the spot.

 A team from Tallah police station reached the hostel after being tipped off by an unidentified caller. 

 ?When our men reached the spot around 12.30 am, the entire ground floor of the hostel was a battleground. The students started throwing stones and chairs at us,? said a senior officer of Tallah police station. 

 After repeated pleas fell on deaf ears, police lathicharged the students to bring the situation under control. Twelve students were injured and three were admitted to the nearby RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

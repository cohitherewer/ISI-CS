 Books, video games, film shows and a cosy corner to settle 

 down with something to nibble. The first standalone bookstore 

 in town for children opened its doors on Thursday, sporting 

 a funky decor and walls lined with hard covers and paperbacks. 

 Just a shout away from mother shop Oxford Bookstore, Oxford Junior at 17 Park Street has stacked up more than 4,000 titles from Random House, Puffin, Brown Watson, Macmillan, Bright Sparks and Ladybird, among others. 

 Alongside foreign covers is the Indian segment displaying books from Tara, Tulika Karadi Tales, Jaico, Katha, Navneet and Young Zubaan.

 There are books catering to zero to 18-year-olds. We have segmented the stock according to age groups. So there are books for babies, toddlers, pre-school, early school, pre-teens, teens and so on We have further divided the segments into sections like picture books and themes like Baby Einstein, stresses Priti Paul, director of Apeejay Surendra Group, in town for the launch.

 The collection also comprises Indian folktales and stories from the Mahabharata as we felt that children should be introduced to the Indian myths and stories at an early age, for the right balance. We have also been very conscious about the pricing because parents dont want to spend too much on childrens books. So the average price of the books would be between Rs 100 and Rs 200, Paul added.

 With a host of accessories and a series of kid-related events, Oxford Junior is positioned as more than just a bookshop. The two-tiered store has been done up with books arrayed along colourful racks and low seats scattered around. The upper level will house four computers for video games. Below, a cup-shaped corner has been carved out for the Little Cha Bar, which will serve snacks and health drinks.

 At the end of the store is a film-screening room, where storytelling sessions, magic shows and art and craft lessons will also be conducted.

 We intend to stock educational toys, DVDs and CDs of childrens films and maybe National Geographic programmes. We have tied up with Disney for film releases and we plan to have previews or trailers of films at Oxford Junior too The big challenge of every bookstore is to make people interested in reading. Here, the idea is to help children discover the joys of reading, said Oxford Bookstores event consultant Maina Bhagat.

 The unveiling was followed by Superheroes on Friday when kids interacted with their favourite characters from fiction and film Harry Potter, Spiderman, Batman and Krissh. 

 Saturday saw an art exhibition by underprivileged children who also put up a mime and dance show with Bhaichung Bhutia as star guest.

 Its fantastic that children are taken so seriously I have a four-year-old son and I always tend to go to the childrens section first when I walk into a bookstore. I feel more and more publishers should focus on books for children, said theatre artiste Sanjna Kapoor, down from Delhi for the unveiling.

 Shops closed in protest

 - Doctor was Good Samaritan, say Tallah residents

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 On Tuesday afternoon, the news of Jayanta Ghosh?s death trickled into Tallah, on the northern fringes of the city. 

 Some residents of Raja Manindra Road, on which the doctor had his small chamber, adjoining Duttabagan Masjid, refused to believe that their ?daktarbabu? had been murdered. Others asserted that it was an act of injustice which they would not take lying down.

 ?Jayantababu?s death is a great loss for poor people like us. He gave us free medicine and sometimes treated those who could not pay his fees absolutely free,? said Sekhar Nandy, owner of a stationery shop opposite the chamber.

 Most people of the area, however, decided that they must give vent to their anger. Mobile phones came out of their pockets, calls were made, and soon, a group of youths got together. About 10 minutes later, they decided to rise in protest against the murder of Jayantada. 

 Two youths walked down the road, and shutters were downed immediately. One after another, a medicine shop, a meat shop, a string of stationery shops and the garments shop adjacent to the murdered doctor?s chamber were all shut by evening. With almost everyone out on the street, a bandh was on.

 Local people set up a roadblock, hindering all traffic movement along Belgachhia Road and Raja Manindra Road. Late in the evening, the police had to resort to a lathi-charge to disperse the crowd. 

 But that was only after police had given the crowd the assurance that a thorough investigation would be conducted and that the murderers would be arrested.

 ?I don?t feel like keeping the shop open after hearing the news. You don?t come across such doctors these days. Three members of my family were under his treatment, including my mother. On certain occasions, he would drop by without even informing us. We will rise in protest,? said Krishnendu Mitra, who lives in the area.

 Members of the Duttabagan Byabasayee Samity, of which Ghosh was vice-president, sent a memorandum to the local police station demanding a thorough probe. They pleaded with local shops to down shutters.

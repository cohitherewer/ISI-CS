 High commissioner of Canada in India David M. Malone is on a city tour, meeting the chief minister, industrialists and generally familiarising himself with Calcutta.

 The city is completely different from what I imagined it would be. I thought it would be more frantic and I definitely did not expect such green expanses, said the high commissioner, who travelled around Calcutta on Sunday.

 Malone met the chief minister on Monday to discuss possible areas of Indo-Canadian partnership. Sanjeev Goenka, honorary consul of Canada, was present at the meeting. 

 The chief minister identified environmental technology, forest, paper and pulp industry and hydro-electricity as possible areas of cooperation between the two countries.

 As Bengal grows, it is going to need more power. Hence, there are immense possibilities in the hydro-electricity field, observed Malone. He added that Canada has a lot of expertise in the area.. 

 There were also discussions on cooperation in the field of agriculture. Bengal is really productive on the agriculture front. We need to work out how India and Canada can help each other in this area, said Malone.

 The high commissioner felt that the economic relations between India and Canada would be as much about investment as about trade. 

 The chief minister has invited a Canadian delegation to the state to discuss the possibility of cooperation between the countries. A lot of it depends on economic viability. We have the capacity and the interest. It is about finding the right fit, explained the high commissioner.

 He also spoke about the rising popularity of Canada as an educational destination among Indians. The average number of Indian students making it to Canadian universities every year is still very modest, at 2,800. But there has definitely been a growth.

 The sciences and the branches of engineering are the most popular choices of the Indian students. Among the newer disciplines, animation is gaining in popularity. 

 The high commissioner said Canadian universities were interested in cooperation with Indian institutions on research and technology development.

 He cited the example of the agreement between Jadavpur University and York University for student and faculty exchange and joint research in nanotechnology, engineering services and history.

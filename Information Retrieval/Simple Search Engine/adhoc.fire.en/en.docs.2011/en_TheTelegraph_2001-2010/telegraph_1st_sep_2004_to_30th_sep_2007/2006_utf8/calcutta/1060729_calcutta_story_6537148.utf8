 Haute stones for Hurley and you

 Passing

 TITHI SARKAR

 client list; the Mumbai-based jewellery designer at 

 Taj Bengal. Picture right by Rashbehari Das 

 Diamonds, by popular consent, 

 are a girls best friend. And how does it feel when 

 one gets to work day in and day out with ones best 

 friend? Even after 10 long years in the business, 

 its still extremely interesting and creatively rewarding, 

 smiles jewellery designer Shibani Aggarwal of Maharani Jewellers, 

 Mumbai.

 Armed with a degree in art, Shibani 

 started out as a journalist with an art magazine. But it 

 was marriage that charted her career path. My mom-in-law, 

 Neena Aggarwal, had been looking after the business all 

 by herself. I just happened to design a bracelet and I received 

 very nice compliments for it. The natural consequence then 

 was joining the business, recalls Shibani.

 Cut to the present and Shibanis 

 client list boasts Hollywood hotties like Jennifer Lopez 

 and Elizabeth Hurley (yes, you read it right) as well as 

 Bollywood beauties like Shilpa Shetty. She also counts the 

 West Asian royalty, notably the Prime Minister of Bahrain, 

 among her loyal clientele.

 At a recent fundraiser for Gujarat 

 earthquake victims hosted by former US President Bill Clinton 

 in New York, Maharanis jewels fetched $2 million in 

 one evening. Renowned jewellery designers and wholesalers 

 in the US and Europe also buy Maharani creations. 

 Sometimes, Shibani picks up an 

 interesting motif and fits in the stones accordingly. At 

 other times, however, its the stone she picks up first 

 before creating a design around it. Mughal architecture 

 fascinates me. I love making Indian traditional jewellery 

 in a way that it looks modern, she says.

 Talk of diamonds and her eyes 

 light up. Diamonds are my forte. Of course I work 

 with other coloured, precious and semi-precious stones. 

 I like emeralds, too, since they can be teamed with almost 

 every other colour. Combinations like emeralds and sapphires, 

 rubies and grey south sea pearls or turquoises and emeralds 

 work very well, points out Shibani. 

 Sample this. A pair of jhumkas 

 is given a whole new look with cut blue topaz in the centre 

 and peripheral diamonds. Designed on the lines of traditional 

 Indian jadau, the jewellery is lighter and more attractive. 

 In another flower design for a pair of earrings with black-and-white 

 or yellow-and-white diamonds, the stones are hinged so that 

 each petal moves separately.

 Most of her designs are set in 

 white gold, while some are done in yellow gold. Unusual 

 cuts and settings are what make the jewellery stand out. 

 Versatility is another important 

 aspect of her creations. A necklace or a baajubandh 

 can be modified into a choker. A necklace can also be worn 

 around the wrist in a way Shibani wears her string of 108 

 pearls, which can double as a rosary.

 I believe even ones 

 wedding jewellery should be so wearable that one can mix 

 and match it with a cocktail dress or wear it on any other 

 special occasion. Todays woman wants to wear that 

 one piece of jewellery that can make her stand out in a 

 crowd, she stresses.

 Maharanis line is not just 

 for women. Men can sport cufflinks as earrings and kurta 

 buttons as brooches, too.

 The in colours this season 

 are yellow and shades of brown, reveals Shibani. Citrines, 

 quartz, smoky topaz are hot favourites, along with plenty 

 of turquoises as well.

 For a person who strongly believes 

 that jewellery is not meant for the locker, there can be 

 no compromise on the quality front. Its an investment, 

 the value of which will never go down, she smiles. 

 Having recently given birth to 

 her second child, Shibani is ready with her line for young 

 girls, ranging from a few months to 15 years.

 Why deny little girls small 

 trinkets and soft, smooth jewels to go with their pink frocks? 

 she asks, planning to unveil the collection just before 

 Diwali.

 Maharani Jewellers is all set 

 for an exclusive exhibition of fine diamond jewellery at 

 the Taj Khazana showroom in Taj Bengal on August 4 and 5. 

 So, heres your chance to see why Liz finds it lovely, 

 or JLo says its just hot.

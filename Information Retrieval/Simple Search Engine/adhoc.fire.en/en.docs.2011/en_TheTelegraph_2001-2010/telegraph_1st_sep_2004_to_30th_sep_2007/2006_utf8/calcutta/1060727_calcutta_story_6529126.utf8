Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday called for deployment of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel in Metro Railway, in the wake of the serial bomb blasts in Mumbai local trains.

 ?Union home minister Shivraj Patil asked us to send a detailed proposal to the Centre on increasing security on the Metro when I spoke to him three or four days ago. The existing security system in the underground is not adequate,? Bhattacharjee said.

 ?Patil has assured me of considering our proposal to enhance security on the Metro,? the chief minister told reporters at Writers? Buildings. 

 Earlier in the day, state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said a year ago, the government had sought deployment of an adequate number of CISF personnel for Metro security, but ?there has been no response so far?.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said that Metro Railway had expressed its inability to bear the expenses of deploying CISF personnel. 

 Metro Railway officials admitted on Wednesday that the earlier plan to engage CISF personnel for security was abandoned to prevent escalation of operational cost. 

 The proposal was taken up soon after the blasts in the London underground last year.

 ?Deployment of CISF personnel would increase the operational cost, which is already quite high,? said G.K. Mohanty, chief operations manager, Metro Railway. ?Our annual operational expenditure is around Rs 90 crore, against an annual income of only Rs 50 crore.?

 According to Mohanty, it had been decided that officers of Calcutta Police would find it easier to interact with local commuters and would be deployed for Metro security. Currently, 77 Calcutta Police officers, 283 Railway Protection Force personnel and 62 firefighters look after Metro Railway security. They are helped by 309 checking staff. A Metro Railway official described the arrangement as ?inadequate?. 

 He pointed out that the RPF, which is supposed to protect railway properties, is not part of the security arrangements. Calcutta Police are ?misfits? to deal with a strike by terrorists, remarked the official.

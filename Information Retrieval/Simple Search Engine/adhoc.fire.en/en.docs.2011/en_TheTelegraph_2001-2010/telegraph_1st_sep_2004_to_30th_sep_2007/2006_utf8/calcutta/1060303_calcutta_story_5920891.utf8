 Remains of the day: A huge branch lies torn from the trunk of a roadside tree 

 Apropos the report ?Road clog threat in New Town landfill?, January 31, if 1.5 million trips are required to transport 29 million cubic metres of silt to the new township, each truck or dumper will have to carry 20 cubic metres or about 600 cubic feet of silt. The gross weight of the loaded vehicles will thus be around 25 tonnes each. 

 Again, if 1.5 million trips are to be made in two years (730 days), 2,000 trips will have to be made each day. Even if the transportation of silt goes on for 24 hours, a truck cannot make more than six trips a day, considering time involved in loading, unloading and travelling 16 km to and from the filling site, breakdown and rest for drivers and helpers. 

 Going by this calculation, 350 heavy trucks will be required to ply non-stop on some of Calcutta?s busiest roads to move the silt. Hidco will have to pay the truck-owners on a per-trip basis to speed up the work. Consequently, the trucks will be driven at breakneck speed down the crowded roads. It would not be surprising if quite a few mishaps occur. 

 Further, the silt dredged out of the Hooghly will obviously be wet and we can?t expect the trucks to be leak-proof. The silt will be spilt on the roads, making them slippery, hence, dangerous for motorists and pedestrians. If the silt that spills over is not cleared, it will dry to dust and cause pollution. 

 In addition to traffic snarls, 350 heavy trucks plying day and night will cause considerable damage to the roads and the environment. The hare-brained scheme to save the money of constructing a pipeline from Hooghly is bound to cost the government much more on other fronts. 

 The authorities will do well to remember that the volume of traffic was considerably lower 35 years ago, when the Salt Lake landfill was done, but the people in power then still preferred to transport the silt through a pipeline and not by trucks. 

 There is no point in carrying silt in trucks except to save money. But by doing so, the government and the people are bound to lose far more than Rs 350 crore, the estimated cost of setting up a pipeline.

 Apropos the report ?Felling ban rein on builders?, February 4, the West Bengal government?s efforts to curb the rampant felling of trees and encourage plantation is praiseworthy. There is no comprehensive law to protect trees in the non-forest areas and a section of unscrupulous traders is taking advantage of this lack. So, the introduction of the West Bengal Trees Protection and Conservation in Non-forest Areas Bill is well-timed. 

 The government should take care of other relevant issues such as conservation of groundwater. During summer, many areas suffer from severe water crisis as even the tubewells dry up. Every year, a huge quantity of water is pumped out from the ground, never to be replenished. Unless proper steps are taken, the situation will spiral out of control. To avoid the danger, the government should think of ways to preserve rainwater and create more waterbodies. 

 Arindam Basu,

 The news that bill will be tabled in the Assembly was long awaited. It is undeniable that rampant violation of environment norms has damaged the ecosystem of the state, especially in Calcutta. This has resulted in a spurt in the incidences of a number of diseases, including lung cancer and asthma. The abnormally hot summer experienced in Calcutta last year could have been a result of global warming. Nature does take revenge on those who betray her.

 Apropos the report ?Now, clinics get a watchdog?, February 6, the decision of the Centre to set up the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals (NABH) and Healthcare Providers to look into the functioning of private hospitals and nursing homes is most welcome. 

 Many people complain of exorbitant costs and unsatisfactory facilities at private hospitals. No unit should be allowed to function and deal with the life of patients unless it has the proper infrastructure. 

 A proper relationship between the staff of a hospital and the patients is vital. The NABH should keep a tab on this aspect of treatment as well. If it can serve the cause for which it has been formed, the healthcare system of the country will definitely improve. But stress should also be given on the improvement of services in government hospitals. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala. 

 It is heartening that the Centre has appointed a watchdog for nursing homes. Over the years, there have been several complaints regarding the rates charged at private clinics. Hopefully, the monitor will put an end to exorbitant rates and ensure that the fees charged are commensurate with the service provided. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Apropos the report ?Speed thrills but it kills?, February 7, Old Court House Street was the site of two terrible accidents in the recent past, and for good reason. In between the crossings of Mission Row and Waterloo Street, there are two zebra crossings. But the surface of the road on this stretch is uneven and the drivers often take the wrong side of the road to avoid the deeply embedded tram tracks. This increases the possibility of accidents manifold. Until recently, there were no road dividers, making it easy for vehicles to flout road rules. Last but not the least, the pavements have been encroached by hawkers.

 Apropos the report ?Pay school teacher better, HC tells government?, February 6, the court has made a wise judgment and deserves to be applauded by everyone. The order should be implemented in all schools and colleges of the state. The flip side is that a section of teachers continues to skip school to devote more time to private tuitions. They need to be reined in. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Apropos the report ?Gift a smile?, February 4, a club?s effort to spread cheer among thalassaemic children by organising an interface with actress Rachana Banerjee on Saraswati puja gave me immense pleasure. We should all draw inspiration from such acts and do something for the underprivileged. 

 Dalim Kumar Dutta,

 APC Road. 

 The executive director of the ITC Sangeet Research Academy is Amit Mukerjee and not Abraham Majumdar as mentioned in the report ?Youth and Euphony?, February 22. The error is regretted.

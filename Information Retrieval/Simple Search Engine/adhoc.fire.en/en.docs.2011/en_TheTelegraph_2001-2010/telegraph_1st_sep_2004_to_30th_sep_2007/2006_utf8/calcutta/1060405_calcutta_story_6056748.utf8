 Lady, not in waiting

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Models sport creations from the autumn-winter 2006 line of Anamika Khanna 

 With two consecutive showings at the London Fashion Week ramp and a host of displays worldwide, Calcutta designer Anamika Khanna has got a firm foothold on the global style stage.

 But the designer, a regular on the ramp at India Fashion Week till last year, has decided to give the stage a miss at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WIFW) 2006, scheduled to kick off in the capital on Wednesday.

 Though Anamika will not be putting up a show at WIFW, she will display her autumn-winter 2006 collection from her stall in the trade area of the event at The Grand in New Delhi. 

 I just finished with London Fashion Week and exhibitions in Paris, Los Angeles and New York and am too tired to put up another show just now. Plus, very soon, I have to start working on my spring-summer 2007 collection that will be unveiled at the spring-summer edition of London Fashion Week later in the year. So, I just decided to take a little breather, comes the candid confession from the designer who works out of her 2/1, Outram Street studio. 

 The collection on display at WIFW is a modified version of the autumn-winter 2006 line that Anamika unveiled at London Fashion Week this February. Titled Ladies, In Waiting, the collection is unapologetic, bold, rich, sexy, elegant, sharp, edgy, grown-up, gorgeous, clutterless and clean.

 This story is about ladies who are now. Modern, chic and with it. At the same time fully aware of all things beautiful and precious, explains Anamika. The fabric-driven line emphasises textures and crafts. We have almost recreated fabrics, she adds.

 A strong attempt to stay away from bohemia has resulted in clean and structured silhouettes without any amount of layering and flow. Its all about unusual shapes and construction and about contouring the body.

 Trapeze dresses ? that flow out in an A-line shape from the armhole ? is the key silhouette of the line. Keeping them company are shift dresses of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, tapered legging trousers, dresses and skirts with very high waistline, jackets, tunic dresses with suspenders and more. A highlight of the line is prints on the inside of the outfits. 

 The colour palette is dark ? black, chocolate brown, navy blue and burgundy ? moving on to muted hues like khaki, olive, mustard and beige, with ivory and white for relief.

 I had launched Ladies, In Waiting, at the London Fashion Week, but for WIFW I have made certain additions. Apart from western buyers I am targeting the domestic market as well as buyers from West Asia, says Anamika.

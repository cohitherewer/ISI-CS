 No Humans Beyond This Point?. 

 I find myself in front of this intimidating signboard yet 

 again! I?m with my dog Chipper at the Tail Waggers pet salon 

 in Mumbai. Set in a quaint little villa in the heart of 

 Pali village, Tail Waggers is India?s first-ever pet salon. 

 It?s the brainchild of Gauri and Urmila, two gorgeous women, 

 raring to go that extra mile for dogs.

 After doing an assistant veterinarians 

 course abroad, Gauri was working with Sangeeta Vengsarkar, 

 a renowned vet in Mumbai. She would often go to people?s 

 houses to groom their pets and that?s when she realised 

 that though every imaginable foreign breed of dog (poodle, 

 chow chow, boxer terriers, Afghan Hounds, Rotweillers and 

 even the Bichon Frise!) is available in Mumbai, when 

 it comes to grooming their exotic breeds, the owners are 

 clueless.

 Thus was born Tail Waggers, out 

 of love for dogs and their healthy upkeep. Initially there 

 were a lot of raised eyebrows because the concept of taking 

 your dog to a professional for bathing or a haircut was 

 unheard of. But both the ladies, armed with scissors, hair 

 dryers and nail cutters started giving the pets of Mumbai 

 a complete makeover. Today they have a loyal and regular 

 clientele that also includes pets of celebrities (Salman 

 Khan, Preity Zinta, Esha Deol?).

 Tail Waggers is a one-stop shop 

 in dog grooming. Baths (both aroma and medicated flea/tick 

 baths), haircut, blow dry, massage, nail clipping and a 

 lot more. As Gauri and Urmila put it: ?A visit to the salon 

 is not just about your dog looking good but its also about 

 him feeling happier and healthier.?

 So, here are some pet grooming 

 tips from the twosome at Tail Waggers:

 Caution: Never use any 

 human products on dogs as their skin pH balance is different 

 from ours.

 Check: Every time your 

 dog comes back from a walk, run your fingers through his 

 hair for a hands-on check for fleas, ticks; also feel for 

 any bumps or cuts. This allows you to attend to your dog 

 immediately.

 Eyes: Discharge from the 

 eyes must be cleaned with a damp piece of cotton wool to 

 prevent the discharge from sticking to the hair around the 

 eyes.

 Bath: After bathing your 

 dog, towel-dry first then sun-dry or blow-dry your dog. 

 Use a wide-toothed comb to de-tangle the hair.

 Teeth: Specially formulated 

 dog tooth pastes and brushes are freely available in the 

 market. In case you don?t get these, wrap a piece of gauze 

 on your finger, dip it in Betadine Mouth Wash and rub it 

 on your dog?s teeth and gums to clean them.

 Nails: Trimming 

 should not be tried at home because beneath every nail there?s 

 a blood vessel which you may injure. It is advisable to 

 take your dog to a vet or groomer.

 Comfort: It should always 

 be comfort over looking good for your dog. Don?t be conventional 

 in your thinking that a Lhasa or an Afghan Hound can?t have 

 short hair .You can give them a comfortable cut suited to 

 a humid, tropical country like ours.

 Building basics for holistic health

 Feng Shui Matters

 Pinky Kapoor

Luck plays an important part in 

 our lives and keeps changing from time to time. The houses 

 we live in bring good fortune during favourable phases of 

 our lives and help us sail through periods of crisis.

 Building or buying a house or 

 a plot according to the rules of Feng Shui becomes vital 

 as one tends to invest a lifetime?s earnings into these 

 properties. Well-constructed multi-storied buildings can 

 be a boon to the builder and the flat owner.

 The builder will be able to dispose 

 of the flats quickly and the flat owners will also enjoy 

 nourishment from such environment-friendly homes. But there 

 are times when highrises remain unoccupied for years. Just 

 like a balanced body leads to a balanced mind, a regular-shaped 

 house or a plot leads to happy and healthy individuals.

 Shape matters

 Brick by brick: 

 Building or buying a house or a plot according to the 

 rules of Feng Shui becomes vital as one tends to invest 

 a lifetime?s earnings into these properties. Well-constructed 

 multi-storied buildings can be a boon to the builder 

 and the flat owner 

 Plots, buildings or flats that 

 are square or rectangular in shape are considered to be 

 the best. The square shape represents the earth element, 

 which has a gravitational force keeping its residents well-grounded 

 and bringing stability to their lives. Rectangular-shaped 

 properties represent tree energy that symbolises growth 

 and prosperity for its occupants.

 It is best to contain the reigning 

 auspicious energy of such perfect-shaped plots by laying 

 a silver strip all around the internal wall of the boundary 

 in a clockwise manner and then joining it at the starting 

 point. Any property that has a fifth wall is not considered 

 auspicious.

 At times, people happily living 

 in regular-shaped homes get tempted to buy the adjoining 

 plot of land, often due to the growing needs of the family. 

 In such situations, people tend to unknowingly disfigure 

 the existing correct shape of their homes.

 It is not advisable to buy a property 

 that slopes down from the road level. One should go for 

 a property that is at a higher level than the road. This 

 ensures prosperity for the owner, since frequent road repairs 

 often tend to make the house sink over a period of time.

 Also, care should be taken to 

 see that the entire structure is on a level surface. It 

 may gently slope towards the north or east but sudden depressions 

 and sunken areas towards the south and south-west may bring 

 about misfortune and disaster. Similar effects are seen 

 where there are split levels in wrong areas inside the house.

 Room rules

 Just as it is important for our 

 body to be internally strong to keep healthy, it is equally 

 necessary to have strong doors and windows placed in the 

 right areas along with bedrooms, living rooms, prayer rooms, 

 kitchens and toilets. Their wrong placement could disturb 

 the energy attributed to each direction, which will directly 

 affect its residents. For instance, if the pious prevailing 

 energy of the north-east is made to mingle with the polluted 

 energy of the toilet (if built in this area), it would directly 

 affect mental peace of the occupants. Similarly, if the 

 bedrooms are wrongly placed or allotted to wrong members 

 of the family, then the mental attitude of each person gets 

 affected.

 Lofts built in the north, east 

 or north-east sectors of the house or a room create similar 

 problems. It is best to avoid them and if at all, they should 

 be built towards the south, west or south-west sectors of 

 the house.

 Green guide

 The building should not be built 

 too close to the boundary wall at the front as that will 

 create discomfort and have a suffocating effect. The discomfort 

 is directly reflected in the occupants. Tall trees that 

 outgrow the size of the building in front become overpowering 

 and overwhelming. They are acceptable if they are in the 

 south or the south-west part of the house. Here they are 

 believed to give support and strength to the house whereas 

 in the north, east or north-east they obstruct the inflowing 

 Chi. Do not plant trees too close to the house, as those 

 with deep roots may weaken the foundation and could be detrimental 

 to the house in the long run. Tall boundary walls all around 

 the house could act as a barrier to inflowing energy.

 Tip of the week

 Astrologically, the best day to 

 finalise any deal related to property is July 29 onwards. 

 Do not invest money or give any token advance before this 

 date. Presently, the planets are at a retrograde position 

 and will become direct from July 29. This will ensure smooth 

 progress of construction work and will save you delays and 

 problems.

 Traditional touch in theatre

Yaksha Manjusha, a troupe from 

 Mangalore, presented Panchavati, an episode from the Aranyakanda 

 (the forest cantos of Ramayana where Rama encounters 

 Surpanakha and other demons) at our school on November 6. 

 The performance, organised by Spicmacay, was thoroughly 

 enjoyed by both teachers and students.

 Yakshagana is a traditional theatre form combining dance, music, dialogues, costumes, make-up and stage technique, with a distinct style. It is mainly prevalent in the coastal districts and adjacent areas of Karnataka. It is closely connected with theatre forms prevailing in other parts of Karnataka and its neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Yakshagana is the product of the Vaishnava Bhakti movement.

 As of now, there are about 30 full-fledged professional troupes and 200 amateur troupes in Yakshagana. The professional troupes go on tour between November and May, staging about 180-200 shows, on consecutive days, spanning the full night.

 With the off-season shows put together, Karnataka witnesses about 12,000 Yakshagana performances every year!

 Though the number of Yakshagana troupes has not declined, the art form is fast evolving itself to cater to an urban audience.

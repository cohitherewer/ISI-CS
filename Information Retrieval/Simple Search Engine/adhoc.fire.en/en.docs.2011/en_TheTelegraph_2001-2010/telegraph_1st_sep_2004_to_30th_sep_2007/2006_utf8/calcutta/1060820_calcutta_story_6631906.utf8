 Saif Ali Khan in 

 Omkara 

 Omkara might be feeling 

 the Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna heat, but Langda 

 Tyagi has spawned an online life all his own. He has cussed 

 his way into the hearts of Netizens. There are more than 

 20 communities dedicated to the Indian Iago in Orkut alone 

 (List of abuses and insults used by Langda is a typical 

 discussion thread). The bloggers, too, are raving about 

 Saif Ali Khans star turn. Some snippets:

 Amit Varma (http://india uncut.blogspot.com) 

 lauds the inspired casting, the day after Omkara 

 released:

 If youd shown me the cast 

 and the script before I heard about the film, Id have assumed 

 that Saif Ali Khan was playing Cassio/Kesu: after all, the 

 cheerful charmer, as Kesu is in this film (though not Cassio 

 in the play), is what Saif does best. But instead, he plays 

 Iago/Langda Tyagi, and slips into character so well that 

 you hate the man by the time the film is over. Surely this 

 isnt the same guy who did Dil Chahta Hai?

 Ishan Prakash (http://ishkash.wordpress.com) 

 on the bastard we all know but cant describe:

 Langda Tyagi is the most inspired 

 performance since Paresh Rawals Sardar. In between I cant 

 think of any actor getting into the soul of a character 

 like this. Langda is a bit of Jack Sparrow and Bill the 

 Butcher at the same time, which means quality. The best 

 thing was, for the entire movie Saif killed himself to become 

 Langda. When he called SMS assum kar dena in a car with 

 Omi, that sealed it for him.

 George Thomas (http:// georgethomas.blogspot.com) 

 writes in a post titled kaThor prudery on Omkara 

 in general and calls for revolution: 

 I was in a theatre in Atlanta, 

 surrounded by desis of various confusions and places of 

 birth. I didnt hear complaints about the dialogue; I could 

 hear people laughing at all the jokes (I was also impressed 

 at how quiet the hall went during the final sequence); I, 

 too, not being familiar with the dialect at all, could follow 

 what was happening.

 He goes on to say since no one 

 is really interested in unimportant issues like education 

 and poverty, its time to go the West way and get multiplexes 

 out to the remote areas as weve managed to sharpen our 

 multiplex-building skills.

 Elsewhere in the virtual world, 

 US President hopeful George Allens macaca, allegedly 

 a reference to an Indian supporter from the rival camp, 

 S.R. Sidarth, has raised the hackles of many. Some samples 

 from the blogs:

 GorillaSushi (http://gorillasushi.com) 

 in a post titled Macaca The New Black:

 Theres a couple of definitions 

 for the word Macaca:

 1. A type of macaque monkey

 2. A derogatory term for a mixed-race 

 person

 3. French Tunisian slur for people 

 with dark skin

 French Tunisian? Sounds like a 

 stretch right? It would be if Allens mother wasnt of French 

 Tunisian descent. Allen has stated that he did not intend 

 the remark as a slur, while his campaign insisted the word 

 was a variation of mohawk, a reference to Sidarths mullet 

 hairstyle.

 Even if you believe that one, 

 are you going to vote for some knucklehead who cant tell 

 a mohawk from a mullet?

 Chacko (http://mutiny.wordpress.com/tag/india) 

 tells Indians how to respond if they are ever called a macaca:

 Mistake it for my kaka, 

 which means uncle in 6/18 national languages of India and 

 say: Really? I honestly dont think I know your father.

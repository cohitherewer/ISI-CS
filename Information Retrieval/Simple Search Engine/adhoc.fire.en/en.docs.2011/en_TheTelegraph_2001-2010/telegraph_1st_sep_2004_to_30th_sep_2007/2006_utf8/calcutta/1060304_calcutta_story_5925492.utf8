 Julia Roberts: Monalisa smile

 The Pretty Woman brings luck to all those who put money on her, be it on screen or stage. Julia Roberts?s highly anticipated debut on Broadway this month-end has triggered a frenzy of ticket-buying. The Hollywood star will appear in Tony award-winner Richard Greenberg?s Three Days of Rain on March 28. The play will run till June 18.

 The ticket websites crashed soon after the sale of seats started on January 28. The show, on the way to sold-out, has fetched a record $7 million in advanced sales in one day.

 Julia will play two characters, as will her co-stars Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, in this family drama fused with mystery.

 The production, directed by Joe Mantello, starts with Walker (Paul), his sister Nan (played by Julia) and their childhood friend Pip (Bradley) meeting in New York to read out their late fathers? will. Their fathers had been partners at a reputed architecture firm, and in the course of the reunion the three grope for clues that could explain what had gone on between their fathers and the women in their lives.

 The second act transports the trio to a previous generation, where they play the parents and reveal the truths that their children could only surmise.

 Three Days of Rain is one of Greenberg?s most acclaimed plays which was first produced off-Broadway in 1997.

 Of the cast, Julia of course took home an Academy Award for her performance in Erin Brockovich and was nominated for Oscars for Steel Magnolias and Pretty Woman.

 TV actor Bradley Cooper, who also makes his Broadway debut as Pip, was seen on the big screen in Wedding Crashers. Stage actor Paul Rudd has appeared in a recurring role as Phoebe?s husband on Friends.

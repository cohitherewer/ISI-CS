 HS council rejects script scan cry

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The Higher Secondary (HS) council has turned down a demand of English-medium schools that answer scripts of their students be evaluated by teachers of English-medium institutions only.

 Students, teachers and the management of various English-medium schools had long been arguing that the language barrier stood in the way of proper evaluation of the answer scripts of their students by teachers of Bengali-medium schools.

 But the council, at a meeting with schoolteachers last week, refused to modify the system of evaluation.

 ?It?s wrong to say that teachers of Bengali-medium schools cannot assess answer scripts written in English. The educational qualifications of teachers in HS schools are the same across the state,? said council secretary Debashis Sarkar.

 ?We had conveyed our stand to the teachers of English-medium schools who attended a meeting, called recently to train them in evaluating answer scripts of the HS 2006,? he added.

 A number of prominent schools in the city, including South Point, had written to the HS council, requesting for a change in the evaluation system. Among the other schools backing the demand were St Lawrence, Gokhale Memorial, Shri Shikshayatan and Carmel Convent.

 ?Our students find themselves in a disadvantageous position if their scripts are examined by teachers of non-English-medium institutions,? pointed out Father Benny Thomas, principal, St Lawrence School.

 ?The assessment can be fair only if it is carried out by teachers having the experience of evaluating scripts written in English,? he added.

 Almost every year, after the HS results are announced, a large number of HS examinees from English-medium schools lodge complaints with their institutional heads, alleging they have been awarded marks lower than their expectations, particularly in English. 

 The issue was also raised at the council meeting last week.

 The council, however, agreed to another demand of the city-based English-medium schools ? that the answer scripts of their students not be given to teachers who stay in faraway districts.

 Sources said the South Point authorities had written to the council, stressing that teachers in rural areas should not be allowed to evaluate the scripts of their students. Most city-based schools feel the competence level of teachers in the districts is below par.

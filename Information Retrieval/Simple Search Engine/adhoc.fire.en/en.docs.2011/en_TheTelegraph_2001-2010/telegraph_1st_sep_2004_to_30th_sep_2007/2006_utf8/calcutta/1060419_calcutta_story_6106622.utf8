Life

 9 months, not under cover

 Forget those oversized 

 shirts and loose lowers. Its time to flaunt your pregnancy

 Mommies-to-be are meant to be 

 on a roll. After all, good days followed by the good news 

 have just about begun. Skin glowing with happiness, undivided 

 attention and pampering galore, dollops of expectation and 

 a dash of anxiety. 

 But hey, whoever said your style statement needs to take a backseat with so much happening?

 the maternity market for teething troubles, trends and more.

 In the mind

 The same set of oversized kurtas worn with a wrap-around skirt or a pair of loose pants ? thats pretty much the maternity dress code for most. After all, not too many people associate pregnancy with fashion. Well, its high time we did. 

 Gape at the glamorous moms-to-be of Hollywood ? Madonna, Britney Spears, Jennifer Garner, Gywneth Paltrow, Katie Holmes to name a few ? and pick up a tip or two, or at least some inspiration. 

 The common consumer cry spells out the lack of maternity wear available in the city. A further probe into the retail side revealed more. Shop owners in Calcutta feel that this segment is yet to pick up, simply because the mindset is not ready.

 Ankur Agarwal, proprietor of Please Mom, a baby store at City Centre, feels that this segment caters to a restricted strata of the society. Most communities in Calcutta are quite orthodox and dont really like making their pregnancy obvious. They are happy and comfortable in a salwar kameez or sari. Yes, Anglo-Indians are non-conservative about their style statement during pregnancy and some newer nuclear families are also opening up to stylish gear, feels Ankur. 

 Maternity clothes in our shop are picked up not only by to-be moms, but more often than not by overweight women who want to wear Western outfits on a holiday, reveals Sangeeta Kejriwal of Just Casuals, a chain with branches at Lindsay Street, Ballygunge Circular Road and City Centre. Fashionable maternity picks here include empire-lined tops as well as dresses with lots of strings for easy adjustment. These are priced reasonably at the range of Rs 400-500. 

 Many people from the Chinese community are fashion-conscious during pregnancy, awareness in other segments is just about spreading, adds Sangeeta.

 Lilliput at The Enclave in Alipore stocks a host of westerns for moms-to-be. On offer is a range of jeans, capris, dresses, overalls and tops. But when it comes to sales, the count is about five or six a month.

 The poor sales figure reflects the level of awareness about maternity wear in the city. Also the mindset of society is such that many would rather camouflage a pregnancy under a salwar suit than accentuate it in a tee and trousers, offers Manjari Almal of Lilliput at The Enclave. 

 Rack watch

 True, not many Indian women dare to dress like Preity Zinta in Salaam Namaste during her pregnancy days. But things surely are changing, feel industry insiders. The maternity market in the city is just waiting to take off. The infant utility items fly off the racks on our floors and we are convinced that an entire niche market for maternity wear exists in Calcutta, says Naveen Misra, unit head of Shoppers Stop, Forum.

 Shoppers Stop is all set to capture this market with a range of products from UK-based chain Mother Care. Our Mumbai store already stocks it and Calcutta can also expect the entire range very soon, promises Naveen.

 The nascent demand has already been tapped by designer Bhavna Jhingan, who specialises in maternity wear and plus-size clothing under her label Emphasize from her Alipore studio.

 My label was born purely out of feedback. A large market for maternity wear does exist, but no one can really quantify it since it is largely untapped, says Bhavna. 

 While the lingerie section claims to have come of age in the city, lingerie and sleepwear designer Suman Nathwani isnt quite convinced about the availability of quality maternity lingerie. Maternity underclothes are available in the city, but only in a few sizes like 34,36, 38, in cup sizes B and C. Pregnancy brings important physical transformation for a woman, but the right kind of supportive bras are missing from the market here. Hence the problem of sagging is inevitable, she feels.

 As far as nightwear is concerned, Suman recommends a garment that has a lot of space in front to accommodate the bloated tummy. These can also double as feeding gowns post delivery, she adds.

 Design detail 

 Bhavna strongly believes that moms-to-be should no way be wrapped in tent-shaped kurtas and boring shirts.

 There is no reason why these women cant stay fashionable. The trendy things have to be incorporated into their clothes, if not all the way then maybe just in a dainty touch. For example, lace is in at the moment and so we try to make maternity tops with lace trimmings, she says. 

 Technically, adds Bhavna, maternity clothes need not always be huge in terms of size. Nowadays women dont put on that much weight overall, only their tummy grows. Your medium size essentially remains a medium, since your shoulders dont ever grow, only the stomach space needs a bit of accommodation, she explains.

 Bhavna shares a few fine points that set apart a maternity garment: 

 There should be no pressure 

 on the tummy, the elastic band should either be much higher 

 or lower than the waistline. 

 The outfits should be 

 least fussy in terms of zippers and buttons. 

 The best choice of fabrics 

 in such cases is cotton and other soft, natural fibre. 

 The colour palette should 

 be bright and happy. 

 Floral splashes in prints 

 and femininity in terms of ruffles, lace and crochet rule 

 the design roost. 

 Dungarees, empire-lines, 

 capris and flowing skirts look fashionable and super-stylish.

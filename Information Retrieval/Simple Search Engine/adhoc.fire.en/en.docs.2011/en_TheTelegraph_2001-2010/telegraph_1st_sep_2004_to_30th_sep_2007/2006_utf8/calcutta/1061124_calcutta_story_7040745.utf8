 After a break, Calcuttas most-awaited annual fashion extravaganza is back. December 2 is when the city will enjoy a brush with the top names in the countrys design fraternity as Stylefile, the fashion affair hosted by Priti Goenka and Sumedha Saraogi, unfolds on the ramp of ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 The multi-designer fashion show followed by an exhibition started in 2002, but gave the ramp a miss last year, restricting itself to a design and art exhibition at The Oberoi Grand.

 Boosted by a frenzied response from Calcuttans last year, the duo is back with the original format this winter.

 Last time, we received an overwhelming response to the exhibition, but people really missed the show. So, this year we decided to be back with the fashion show, says Priti.

 It will be fashion all the way at Stylefile Winter Show 2006, with The Telegraph as media partner.

 The star-studded line-up boasts design biggies like Rohit Bal, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Aki Narula, Anamika Khanna, Aparna Chandra, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Shantanu amp; Nikhil, Vivek Narang, as well as upcoming talent like Gaurav Gupta and Sabina Singh. 

 While the designers will showcase a mix of mens and womens wear, the show will also boast a sequence of couture jewellery by Raj Mahtani.

 We wanted to have a good mix of designers with each one boasting a different signature look to bring variety to the show. Most of the designers are doing new collections for Stylefile, says Priti. 

 So, while Rohit will unveil a line dominated by linens, Aki will present an all-black collection and Sabyasachi will provide glimpses of his line showcased at the Olympus Fashion Week in New York earlier this year.

 The exclusive designs apart, the show will have surprise elements in the form of the sets, promises Sumedha. This is the first time we are doing an outdoor show, at the Sunderbans in Sonar Bangla. Itll be a very different show on a much larger scale than before and we hope the sets will be a visual treat, she smiles. 

 The sets will be done up by Martand Khosla while Aparna and Tanya will choreograph the show.

 Models set to walk the open-air ramp include head-turners like Bhawna Sharma, Fleur Xavier, Joey Matthew, Laxmi Rana, Tupur Chatterjee, Sapna Kumar, Muzzamil, Rajneesh Duggal, along with city catwalkers Jessica, Devdutta, Sanjukta and Neeraj.

 The show will be followed by an exhibition in Pala, at the same star venue, the next day.

 In addition to the show designers, there will be five new names at the exhibition Amrish Kothari (jewellery), Anjali Kalia, Pankaj Ahuja, Haresh Shah and Kokomoo (accessories). The exhibition will be open from 10.30 am to 5.30 pm.

 Born in Calcutta in 2002, the Stylefile show has travelled to Mumbai in the past years. Now, the duo plans to take it to other parts of the country. We are looking at taking Stylefile to Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Pune in the future, say Priti and Sumedha.

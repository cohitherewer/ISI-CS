Hello there, maam I was too busy framing my picture postcard photograph to bother about who that stern and clipped address was directed at. Before long, a dark frame had covered my viewfinder. Please, maam, you are not to use the flashbulb if you mean to shoot us, the guard in black directed.

 Expecting to be ticked off for taking a picture of Her Majestys home without taking her permission, I was taken aback at this docile restriction. And the royal gatekeeper had more to offer before returning to his post: The flash blinds us and we cannot react if something happens at that moment. This explanation hit me harder than a knockout punch, given the kind of reaction we are used to from our men in uniform.

 With or without the flashbulb, Buckingham Palace is a difficult proposition to shoot past sundown. It was the fifth evening that the faade of the royal residence had been lit up with a 37,000-light installation. This groundbreaking move is apparently to be a fixture every winter for the remainder of the Queens reign. Yet the environment-friendly LED lights seemed dim lanterns compared to what the Queens ancestor, the empress, enjoys at her Memorial in post-colonial Calcutta. And I am not being so blunt as the Scottish matron close by who muttered volubly to her husband: Oh dear, our house has more than this!

 My next destination was Trafalgar Square in search of the pigeons that Madhuri Dixit had fed in Parinda. But the pigeons dont do duty after dusk. The National Gallery was closed but the church next door caught my eye. There was a Vivaldi performance on, but a reminder of the rupee conversion rate kept me from venturing within. I turned to the crypt downstairs. The steep narrow stairs led not to coffins, but to a coffee house. And the only skulls were to be found in the key chains being sold at a souvenir shop.

 I sought out a restroom and hastily proceeded towards the only open cubicle. One step in and then I sprang out. Someone was at it, standing, with her back to me. It was straight out of Mrs Doubtfire where the children spy their cross-dressing baby-sitter using the loo. As I locked myself into the next available cubicle, hearty greetings sounded outside in booming male voices. That sent me into paroxysms of panic. I started thinking bitterly of all the valuables I was carrying that were essential to get me out of the crypt, and the country. I finally gathered courage and tiptoed out. 

 There were three of them two in saris, and the third (the one I had seen) in skirt and top. Dame Skirt-Blouse had divided the mop in three spikes, one in ravishing red, the middle in lightning white and the other in bewitching black. There were painted spikes under the eyes and on the chin as well, pointed downwards. The rest of the faade, too, bespoke a ghastly paintbrush malfunction. 

 Thankfully, the two sirens in saris had their backs to me and I was in no mood to find out whether they imported their attire from Gariahat. Just when I thought I was safely making off, the eyes of the Three Weird Sisters fell on me. Their eyes sparkled, their coloured eyelashes fluttered and their heavy accessories tinkled as they chorused Happy Halloween! I had broken into a sweat, a run and Bengali (Hyan, maney, aami). 

 After the Great Escape, I felt I deserved some entertainment. So I turned towards Leicester Square, where the ushers came down on the streets offering half-price tickets for the nights show. But I did not need Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for the music. Close by khol-kartaal could be heard. The melody-makers turned out to be Lord Krishna devotees. Some carried Hare Krishna posters, one played a synthesiser and the rest sang and danced. In that street lined with night clubs, the crowd was light-heeled anyway and provided with free music and motion, many happily contributed an impromptu gig alongside the procession before carrying on.

 The street also led to the bowels of Chinatown, lined with restaurants. Calcuttas favourite cuisine, here I come, thought I and marched in. A British acquaintance called on my cellphone to find out if I was doing all right. Oh you are in Chinatown? The Chinese triads operate there, you know. Sometime back, an Indian had set up a restaurant ignoring warnings. He was found with his throat slit on the pavement within a week. But I am here only to buy food, I protested. The screech drew the waitress and after deciding what was good for me, off she went even as I started inspecting my surroundings in a new light. 

 The meal went off without any sinister overtures and my throat was beginning to feel secure when the waitress was back carrying a kitchen knife. It was close to midnight and most of my fellow diners had left. I drew a sharp breath, kicking myself for having given up karate lessons in Class II. But out came a rather opulent orange from her pocket. Neatly she cut it in four halves and placed it in front with another flourish of a language which sounded like English but was too heavy with a Mandarin accent for my Bengali eardrums. I happily ate the slices and beamed at the waitress for the treat on the house. 

 Her return of the civility emboldened me so far as to beckon her to a piece of paper on which I wrote my name in capital letters. In Chinese please. It took her a long consultation with the steward and when I had started to wonder whether I was stretching my luck, she was back.

 Four hieroglyphics were what she had added beside my name. So that was Me, though I hardly recognised her! A night in London had earned me a new identity. Happily, I trudged down the stairs of the Metro, err... the Underground.

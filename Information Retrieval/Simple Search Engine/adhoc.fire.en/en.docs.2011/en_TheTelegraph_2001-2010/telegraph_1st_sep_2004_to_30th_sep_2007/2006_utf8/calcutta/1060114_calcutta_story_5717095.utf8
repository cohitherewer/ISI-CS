 Crowning a life totally devoted to dance, Alokananda Roy has completed 50 years of performance on stage. Celebrating this awesome achievement, the students of Chandanaloke and Inspiration Foundation host Aaureleum, a cultural evening featuring eminent artistes from the fields of art, music, dance, poetry and entertainment. Beginning with a prayer and blessings by Rt. Rev. PSP Raju, Bishop of Calcutta, followed by an invocation through vedic chants rendered by Prof. Ranjan Mitter, it offers a delightful medley of music and dance, poetry and painting, besides a special ceremony in which Roy will be felicitated. Moods of Munni Mashi captures the many facets of her personality as visualised by her students. Alaknanda, an audio-visual presentation, pays tribute to the danseuse?s enduring ability to captivate her audience. The programme concludes with Blossoms of Harmony, a collage of dance, song, percussion, poetry and art presented by Tanmoy Bose, Wasim Kapoor, Haimanti Shukla, Pramita Mallick, Srikanto Acharya, Shayne Hyrapiet, Rita Bhimani, Madhumanti Moitra and Roy herself.

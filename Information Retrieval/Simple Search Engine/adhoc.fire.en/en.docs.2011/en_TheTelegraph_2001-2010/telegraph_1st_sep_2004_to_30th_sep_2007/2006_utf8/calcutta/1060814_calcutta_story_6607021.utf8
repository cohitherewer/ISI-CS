 SOUMITRA DAS

 A drawing by Chandrima Bhattacharyya at the Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture exhibition

 Huge and horrendous canvases one of these resembles a Playboy centrefold minus its artistry are prominently hung in the first-floor hall of the Birla Academy of Art and Culture. And if these are truly Glimpses of Contemporary Bengal Art, as the title claims, the art of Bengal better be wiped off the face of the Earth.

 This institution seems quite incapable of separating the wheat from the chaff. Curation is a discipline unknown to it. It is sad that so much space is used to show off such worthless products of the marketplace. 

 Before one gives up in despair, one can discover for oneself less prominent but far more sensitive works concealed in this crowd of uglies. It is easy to lose sight of these.

 To begin with, Santiniketan-based Chandrima Bhattacharyya, who is known for her drawings. Part fantasy, part satire, the colour drawing where Abol Tabol meets Psycho is rich in details and meticulously delineated. With its spooks, rocking horse and moon showing its tongue, it is hair-raisingly absurd.

 Mini Sivakumar, also from Santiniketan, is an autodidact. She has developed a style of her own that is simple yet strong in its appeal, like a poster or picture postcard. She does not try to prove that she has mastered the art of drawing but through the arrangement of images, she builds up a delightful picture. One should not miss the mice printed on the sari of the woman. Like Bhattacharyya, Sivakumar uses strong colours that arrest the eye.

 Curtains rise to reveal a sea resort and the absurd drama of courtship. Sharmi Chaudharys canvas is painted in a nave style. The interplay of a golden light and darkness is skilfully modulated in Aditya Basaks large work. The real melds effortlessly with the world we enter in our sleep, creating an image that is familiar and yet has the lure of the indefinite. For a change, Suhas Roy has deviated from his Radha. He has painted a sensual dark Virgin.

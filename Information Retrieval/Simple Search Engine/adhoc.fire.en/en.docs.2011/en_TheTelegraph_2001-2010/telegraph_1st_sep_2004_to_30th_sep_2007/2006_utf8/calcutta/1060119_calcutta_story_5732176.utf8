 Demolition gun on roadside shrines

 Encouraged by the demolition of a shrine at Kalikapur on Sunday to pave the way for a new link road, the city civic authorities are planning a drive to raze scores of illegally-built places of worship encroaching upon public property. 

 ?The time has come for us to take a firm stand on removing obstructions from the city roads,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. ?Large portions of the roads have been encroached upon by temples and mazhars.? 

 The Trinamul Congress, however, is divided on the issue. While Mamata Banerjee and party chief in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Javed Khan are opposed to the demolition drive, a faction headed by Firhad Hakim, Trinamul chairman of borough XI, is pushing for use of force since December. 

 ?Hakim proposed demolition of illegal structures in the House in his personal capacity. He did not consult the Trinamul leadership,? said Khan.

 In his December-24 proposal, Hakim called for demolition of the Shani and Shiva temples and mazhars that block the city roads. Mayor Bhattacharya welcomed the proposal. 

 The Trinamul supremo was unhappy when she found how Hakim?s proposal was enlisted for discussion by CPM chairman of the House Nirmal Mukherjee, keeping the Trinamul leadership in the dark.

 According to the civic conservancy department, there are over 25,000 temples encroaching the city roads.

 Roadside Shani temples were first set up in the city by Bangladeshis who came to Calcutta during the 1971 war. The number of such structures has since multiplied, especially in the market areas.

 Most of the roadside Shiva and Bajrangbali temples, on the other hand, have been established by settlers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. 

 Bengalis are behind the majority of the Kali temples, most of which are in the residential areas. 

 ?I personally feel hawkers do not pose a problem in the city, since they do not permanently block the pavements. The mushrooming of Shani and Shiva temples and some mazhars are a bigger impediment,? asserted Hakim.

 He continued: ?All the road side mazhars are fake. No one has ever been allowed to bury a body on the road.?

 Describing Hakim?s proposal as ?rational and judicious?, mayoral council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said: ?Something must be done to get rid of illegally-constructed temples and mazhars.?

 Trinamul leader Rajib Deb countered: ?It was actually the CPM?s proposal and was placed in the House through Hakim to embarrass our party leadership. The main objective is to demolish the temples.?

 ?The CPM needs more room on the pavements to earn money by letting them out to hawkers and, therefore, they want to demolish the temples. The arithmetic is simple: for a single roadside mazhar, there are about 50 Shani and Shiva temples on the pavements of Calcutta. We are against all sorts of encroachments and illegal structures. If any action is taken, it should be taken against all types of encroachments, including by the party offices,? held Javed Khan.

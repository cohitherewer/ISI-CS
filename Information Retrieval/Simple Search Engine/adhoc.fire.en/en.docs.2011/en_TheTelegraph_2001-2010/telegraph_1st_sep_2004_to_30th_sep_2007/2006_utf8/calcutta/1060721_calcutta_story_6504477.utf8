 Panic grips Metro commuters after bomb rumour

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Panic gripped passengers of a Dum Dum-bound Metro Railway train following a rumour that a bomb had been planted in one of the coaches. 

 The rumour spread as soon as the train pulled in at Netaji Bhavan station at 1.38 pm. Most passengers left the train immediately and made a mad rush towards the exits.

 The driver switched off the lights of the train and Metro employees were pressed into service. Later, it was detected that the rumour had spread from a coach where smoke came out of a fan following a short-circuit. Metro officials said the train was delayed for five minutes.

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said the man might have died at least a couple of days ago. The body did not bear any injury marks.

 Local residents complained to the airport police station after a foul smell started emanating from the quarters.

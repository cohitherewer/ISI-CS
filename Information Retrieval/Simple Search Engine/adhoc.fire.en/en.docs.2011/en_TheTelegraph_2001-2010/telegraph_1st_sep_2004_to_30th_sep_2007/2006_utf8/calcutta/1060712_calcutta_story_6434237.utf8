 We Ask You Answer

 Our answer to Superman

 Today?s 

 question: Is it right to call Krrish the 

 first Indian superhero? More responses will be published next 

 week

 First Superpower? Hrithik Roshan in 

 and as Krrish

 Purvi Thacker,

 Deb Lane 

 I think Krrish will definitely 

 become the first superhero of Indian cinema. I don?t think 

 Jadoo, the alien in Koi... Mil Gaya, had the same 

 impact on children. Jadoo, however, grew in popularity after 

 the film was released. Hats off to Rakesh Roshan for finding 

 a way into the hearts of youngsters. The way children are 

 collecting Krrish memorabilia, the character looks 

 set on the path to superstardom. 

 Nidhi Poddar, 

 Salt Lake 

 Yes, Krrish is likely to 

 introduce a superhero to the Indian screen. The eponymous 

 character has what it takes to be successful even in the 

 face of competition from Superman Returns. It might 

 even be a global hit.

 Rahul roy, 

 Dum Dum 

 Krrish is definitely the first 

 Indian superhero. Though there have been other superheroes 

 like Ajooba and Mr India, none matched the charisma of Krrish. 

 The latest character is not inspired by any other. His moves, 

 looks and even costume are awesome. Krrish fits the superhero 

 mould and will give a fillip to Indian films.

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati 

 There is no denying that Krrish 

 has created a ripple among children. The film has several 

 firsts to its credit ? the hero himself has done all the 

 stunts and the special effects are hitherto unseen in Indian 

 films. The astronomical budget is also a talking point. 

 However, the main character definitely has shades of popular 

 western superheroes like Superman and Batman. To call Krrish 

 the first Indian superhero ahead of our very own Hanuman 

 would be unjust. The heroic deeds of the latter has won 

 him the status of god.

 Indranil Sanyal, 

 Dhakuria

 Yes. Krrish can be conferred the 

 status of the first superhero of Indian films. To date, 

 we have never been told a tale with digitally-composed images 

 and special effects. Though a 3D film had been released 

 in India earlier, Krrish is in a completely different 

 league altogether.

 Tuli Das,

 Salt Lake 

 Krrish is very much the first 

 Indian superhero. The character is not borrowed from some 

 comic strip. The story starts in a simple Indian village 

 and Hrithik Roshan in his latest avatar captivates every 

 heart.

 C. Bhowmick,

 Kaikhali 

 Krrish is not the first Indian 

 superhero. Characters such as Shaktiman, Junior G, Karma 

 and Hero had captured the imagination of audiences in their 

 small-screen appearances long back. 

 Basant Choudhary, 

 Kankinara 

 If Christopher Reeve as Superman 

 can be called the first superhero from Hollywood, by the 

 same logic it is also right to call Krrish the first Indian 

 superhero. But it is also true that he is an imitation of 

 the Western concept of a superhero. He has similar magical 

 powers by which he rescues people under threat from evil 

 forces. 

 M ohammad Sohail,

 McLeod Street 

 Definitely. I recently watched 

 the movie and it was outstanding. I have never seen such 

 special effects and death-defying stunts in an Indian movie. 

 Hrithik?s performance is as good as that of any other Western 

 superhero. The effort put in by the Roshans has paid off.

 Md. Sarfaraz Alam, 

 Kamarhati 

 Krrish is obviously the first 

 Indian superhero. There hasn?t been a similar character 

 in desi movies. Superheroes were products of the 

 Hollywood dream factory so far.

 Arpita Mukherjee,

 VIP Road 

 After drooling over Super-man, 

 Spiderman and He-man, Indian children and grown-ups finally 

 have Krrish to adore. But the superhero who has ruled Indian 

 minds down the ages is Hanuman. The monkey-god?s popularity 

 received a fillip through a recent animation film.

 Amrita Chatterjee,

 Address not given 

 Krrish is Bollywood?s answer to 

 legendary superheroes like Spiderman, Batman and Superman. 

 He is capable of winning a huge fan following with explosive 

 action.

 Netai Chakraborty

 Secretary, Vaidik Pandit O Purohit Mahamilan Kendra

 There are so many heroes in our 

 mythology, each with superhuman powers. Why should a figure 

 in a Bollywood blockbuster suddenly be hailed as our first 

 superhero? Ram, Hanuman, Bheema all have superhuman 

 powers. For ages, they have been objects of our awe and 

 admiration. A celluloid hero cannot suddenly upstage them. 

 For that matter, if we have to stick to pure fiction, what 

 about Bantul the Great in our popular comic strip? He too 

 can walk through walls and make trucks stop with his bare 

 hands.

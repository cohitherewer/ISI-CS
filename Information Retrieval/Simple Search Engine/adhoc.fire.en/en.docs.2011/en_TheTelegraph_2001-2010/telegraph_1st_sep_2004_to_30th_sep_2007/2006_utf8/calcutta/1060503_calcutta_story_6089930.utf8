 Buffet binge and battle

 Far from being just a 

 time-saving compromise, the pick-and-choose spread today is 

 an integral part of eating out. Shradha Agarwal 

 finds out why and how 

 A vibrant colour story, intricate embellishments, varied textures, sinful aroma and mind-boggling choices. Thats pretty much what a buffet spread stands for.

 Any similarities with things fashionable is surely not coincidental. After all, the buffet is the new flavour in food fashion.

 Gone are the days when an eatery came up with a buffet to push sales on a dull weekday. Today, its very much a part of the urban lifestyle ? both while eating out and at home.

 GoodLife takes a close, appetising look at buffet basics.

 Combo key

 People, especially from the corporate sector, are too busy to browse through the entire menu and then decide on their order. A buffet is ideal for them, all laid-out and ready, waiting to be picked up on the go, says Debasish Ghosh, manager of Mainland China that offers a daily buffet.

 While a buffet promises a great meal within the least time, it also assures enough value for your money.

 Yuvraj Johar, executive assistant manager, F amp;B, Taj Bengal, feels that the buffet is a true gift to the Calcutta connoisseur. Bengalis are known for their love of a large spread of non-vegetarian food, Marwaris, on the other hand, appreciate a wide vegetarian section. So a buffet is perfect ? one spread caters to all, says Yuvraj.

 The right combination ? of colour, texture and cuisine ? is what makes a commercial buffet click.

 There has to be something for everyone at the buffet. Non-vegetarian is a big draw indeed, but there have to be enough vegetarian options too, says Anitha Chettiyar, assistant F amp;B manager, The Hyatt Regency.

 Throwing in an exotic element like oyster bar or a chocolate fountain can add that special zing to a buffet, adds Yuvraj.

 He recommends an elaborate soup and appetiser spread, followed by a wide cold-cut section with lots of meat and exotic cheese.

 Live counters are a major hit in buffets, feels Anitha. Pastas, dosas or waffles ? live counters add great value, she stresses.

 And the final flourish comes in the form of embellishments.

 Edible displays look great near a buffet. Uncut fruits, vegetables, grains or oils in bottles and jars add amazing appeal, says Anitha.

 Diet diktat

 While diets and buffets arent exactly considered to be the best of friends, theres no real reason to fret, assures Dr Shikha Sharma.

 The nutritionist who dished out a low-cal Fashion Food buffet spread for the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week at the Caraway Caf? in The Grand, New Delhi, last month, shares her tuck-in tips with GoodLife.

 The best time to enjoy 

 a buffet is a weekend brunch. A late-night buffet invariably 

 leads to overeating. And going to bed without burning the 

 calories adds to the damage.

 Start with the soup, but 

 without piling on the bread accompaniments.

 In the salad section, 

 choose from vinegar or olive oil-based dressings. Avoid 

 cream-based dressings or macaroni and pasta salads. You 

 can also indulge in sprouts or chaat.

 Choose the main course 

 sensibly. Pick the wheat rotis, not lachha 

 parathas. Likewise, go for the fish, not dal makhni.

 Opt for sugar-free or 

 fruit-based desserts. Ask for guidance and the chefs will 

 be more than willing to help you choose the right ones.

 Finally, finish off with 

 a cup of herbal tea. This is good for digestion and will 

 not make you feel heavy after the meal. 

 You can taste a bit of 

 everything ? after all, you dont want to go home grumbling 

 over not having done justice to your buffet bill.

 Enjoy every moment, relish 

 every morsel and stimulate each sensation? A buffet 

 is a visual treat, an appetiser for your eyes. Overeating 

 normally happens when you eat very quickly, reasons 

 the good doctor.

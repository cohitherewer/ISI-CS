 Cops foil suicide attempts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two suicide attempts in two days turned the spotlight back on the Dhakuria Lakes after the lull of a successful eviction drive.

 A man in his mid-50s followed in the footsteps of a 26-year-old woman for a failed suicide bid at Rabindra Sarobar on Thursday. Both suicide bids were foiled by cops.

 It was around 12.30 pm on Thursday that Yogendra Yadav, a 45-year-old constable of Lake police station, heard a loud splash while patrolling the Sarobar premises.

 He rushed to the spot and found a pair of shoes and a shirt on the banks. Then, he spotted a man in the water.

 Yadav took off his shoes, plunged into the Lake and hauled the man to the shore.

 On quizzing the middle-aged resident of south Calcutta, police came to know that ?acute financial problem? had pushed him over the edge.

 ?He had borrowed a huge amount from several people and private firms to run his business,? said an officer.

 ?Yadav has set an example for others. The force is proud of him,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 On Wednesday, local residents spotted a young woman sinking and raised an alarm. It was a cop who responded promptly and rescued her.

 ?Fortunately, she was close to the banks. She claimed she had slipped accidentally, but it seemed she had jumped,? said an officer.

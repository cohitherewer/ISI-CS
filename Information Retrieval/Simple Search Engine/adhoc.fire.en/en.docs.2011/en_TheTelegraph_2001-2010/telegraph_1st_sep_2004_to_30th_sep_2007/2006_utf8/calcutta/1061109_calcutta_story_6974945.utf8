The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scheme for smooth drive

 - Synchronised traffic signals ahead on key stretches 

 KINSUK BASU

 How often have you wished that traffic signals didnt come in the way when the road beyond was clear? If a grand plan by traffic police proves successful, you wont have to fret and fume at the traffic signals much longer.

 The mandarins have decided to synchronise traffic signals on key stretches across the city to provide an uninterrupted drive. 

 The three-km stretch from Gobindo Khatik Road to Park Circus bridge no. 4 will be the first to flaunt the synchronised lights. The experiment might then be tried out on Chittaranjan Avenue and in BBD Bag. 

 A trial run was carried out on Gobindo Khatik Road-Park Circus bridge no. 4 a few weeks ago with the help of engineers from a central-government organisation. During the run, the average vehicular speed on the stretch was 55 km per hour. Two other companies have been asked to give a demonstration as well.

 We synchronised the traffic signals on this stretch and the system worked fine. The trial was carried out at different times of the day. We are optimistic about the project and hope that it will be finalised soon, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 According to traffic department officers, the project was first tried out between Gobindo Khatik Road and Park Circus bridge no. 4 because the stretch handles one of the biggest traffic loads in south Calcutta. Besides, foreign dignitaries and VVIPs regularly use the route. 

 A few years back, the traffic department had unsuccessfully tried to turn Chittaranjan Avenue into a Green Zone, offering an uninterrupted drive from Shyambazar to Esplanade. So, this time, the cops are taking more factors into consideration.

 The traffic lights will be synchronised according to the time of the day. The traffic load at that time will be factored in. It will be possible to manually manage the signals if required, stated a senior officer.

 The traffic police brass is studying the synchronisation scheme in New Delhi, particularly along Ring Road. 

 For certain stretches on Chittaranjan Avenue, the technique used will be the same the traffic load at a particular point will determine the synchronisation strategy.

 But the cops already foresee a problem. One of the biggest impediments is that traffic pours on to Chittaranjan Avenue from arteries on both sides, pointed out the officer.

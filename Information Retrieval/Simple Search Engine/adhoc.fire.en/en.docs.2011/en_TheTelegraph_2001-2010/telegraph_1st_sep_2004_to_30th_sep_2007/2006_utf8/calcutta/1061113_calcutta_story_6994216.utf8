 College-level theatre is more common and treated with much more seriousness in most states beyond Bengal. In Calcutta, the enthusiasm is largely restricted to the annual performances of Jude (Jadavpur University Department of English). Among past Jude presentations are Kalidasas Shakuntala, Shakespeares Measure for Measure and Samuel Becketts Dramaticules. 

 The play this year is Caryl Churchills Top Girls, directed by drama critic and academician Ananda Lal. It will be presented at Gyan Manch on November 14, at 6.30 pm, with the support of British Council. 

 Something that should spur these actors to strive harder, according to Lal, is the fact that these stage presentations are now a part of the curriculum and students stand to win or lose grades.

 Asked why he chose Churchill, who remains little known in India, Lal said: The play remains relevant; Churchill was a pioneer of British feminist theatre. But there was another consideration girls always form the majority in the English department, so I have to be on the lookout for plays with a lot of women characters.

 And the Judeans (ranging from first-year undergraduates to second-year postgraduates) are doing it all acting, designing costume and handling stage equipment.

 Top Girls begins with a dream sequence where St Joan of Arc, Lady Nijo, Isabella Bird, Rani Lakshmibai and Chandramati are seen seated around a table sharing cheese and biscuits, coffee and brandy with the latest Top Girl, a soon-to-be-MD, Malini (Rohini Chaki).

 The play, which tries to touch on the problems of choices facing every man and woman en route to success, stirs up a concoction of realism and surrealism, where dialogues deliberately overlap and the actors dont move around enough to allow the audiences attention to stray from the dialogue.

 To make it easier for the Calcutta audience, Churchills locale has been changed to the hills of North Bengal, names have been changed to Malini, Jaya and two new characters of Rani Lakshmibai, Chandramati (Harishchandras wife) introduced, explained Lal.

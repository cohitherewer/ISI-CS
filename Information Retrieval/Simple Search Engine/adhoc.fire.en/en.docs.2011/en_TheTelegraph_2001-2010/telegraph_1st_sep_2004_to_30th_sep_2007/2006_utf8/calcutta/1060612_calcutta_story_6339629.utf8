 Biker killed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A young man in his twenties was killed early on Sunday when he, along with two accomplices, tried to give policemen the slip and the motorcycle they were riding rammed into a road-divider near bridge no. 4 in Park Circus.

 The deceased, identified as Mohammad Abib from the Topsia area, was declared dead when police rushed him to National Medical College and Hospital. 

 The two others managed to escape on their motorcycle.

 According to police, the accident occurred around 5.30 am while a police jeep was chasing the motorcycle. ?They tried to snatch valuables from a morning walker in front of Victoria Memorial but failed. When we noticed this, we chased them,? said an officer of Hastings police station.

 The three crossed the Park Circus seven-point crossing and started speeding down the Park Circus EM Bypass connector. While approaching the western flank of the bridge, the youth who was driving the two-wheeler lost control and Abib fell on the road. He laid there with blood oozing out of the wounds in his head.

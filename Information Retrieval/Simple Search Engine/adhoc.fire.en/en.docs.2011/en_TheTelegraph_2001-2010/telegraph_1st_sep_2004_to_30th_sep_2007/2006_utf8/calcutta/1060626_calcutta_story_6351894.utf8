 Burglars prowl in Buddha zone

 - Two families forced to shift out of chief minister?s neighbourhood

 How safe is the chief minister?s neighbourhood?

 According to statistics available with the detective department of the city police, the Karaya-Palm Avenue area, part of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s neighbourhood, has witnessed a number of burglaries over the past year.

 Barring a couple of cases, police have failed to make any breakthrough.

 Finding the locality unfit for living, two families have finally shifted out.

 Barely two months after moving into their Palm Avenue flat, businessman Rajat Buddharaja and his wife had the shock of their life. ?I bought the flat there thinking the area was safe, as the chief minister stays nearby. But after what happened in March 2005, we had only one option: to sell our flat. Now, we live in Tiljala,? Buddharaja told Metro.

 On March 10 2005, Buddharaja and his wife had gone to Vaishno Devi in Jammu. On their return a week later, they found the window grilles of their flat at 41, Palm Avenue, around 100 metres from the chief minister?s residence, broken. Entering the flat, they found the almirah open and cash and jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh missing.

 They lodged a complaint with Karaya police station and the case was taken up by the anti-burglary section. ?Over a year has passed, but the culprits are still at large. I went to Lalbazar last month and was told that the case was closed,? said Buddharaja.

 Another businessman, Ranjit Jaiswal, has a similar tale to tell. Last September, criminals broke into his flat on Bondel Road and fled with jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh. 

 Jaiswal had bought the jewellery for his brother?s wedding. 

 ?The burglary forced me to shift to Ballygunge. Officers at Lalbazar told me last month a probe was on,? said Jaiswal.

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said: ?Our officers are trying to flush out the criminals.?

 Police have claimed to have identified the two gangs that were behind most burglaries in the neighbourhood. ?The kingpins ? Salim and Ashraf, both Bangladeshi nationals ? are at large. The gangs are hiding possibly in Ghutiari Sharif and Canning,? said an officer. ?We conducted raids thrice but they could not be traced.?

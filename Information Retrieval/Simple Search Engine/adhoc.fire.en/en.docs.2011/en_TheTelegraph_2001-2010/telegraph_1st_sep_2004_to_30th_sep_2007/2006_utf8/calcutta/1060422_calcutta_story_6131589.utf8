 Should boys and girls be brought 

 up differently? Is motherhood the greatest achievement for 

 women, as is career for men? Should house work be shared 

 by the husband and wife only if both are working?

 These questions were the topics of a heated debate amongst a bunch of young boys and girls at a workshop on April 11 at Thoughtshop Foundation. The discussion threw up interesting facts, orthodox notions and hints of rebellion against existing norms.

 Attended by more than 30 students and representatives from JU, Vidyasagar School of Social Work, St Xavier?s College, St Thomas College of Engineering and Technology and Kabitirtha Yuva, the session was part of the international ?We Can End all Violence against Women? campaign organised by the NGO in collaboration with Oxfam GB.

 The session began with a vociferous discussion on gender issues that evoked strong reactions from everybody. 

 The We Can campaign is based on the idea that equal relationships are violence free. It seeks to create five million ?Change Makers? in South Asia who will try to change community attitudes and build popular support for the campaign. 

 The Change Makers will reach out to around 50 million people across South Asia in an attempt to curb practices of gender discrimination and violence.

 The main objective of the Thoughtshop session was to scout for young people who are willing to work towards uprooting gender bias.

 The campaign will be launched in West Bengal later this year. Thoughtshop plans to prepare for this event by training a group of core members who have the dedication to spare quality time for We Can. Once the campaign starts in the state, these members will be required to take it forward in full force.

 The workshop ended with the screening of a short film on the success story of We Can. Initially, there might have been differences amongst the participants about the upbringing of boys and girls and the roles of men and women in society, but in the end everyone agreed that ?we can change? to uproot gender bias from our society.

 Sporting salute

 An all-India under-19 invitation cricket tournament was organised by Howrah Union Club, in memory of renowned cricket coach Bulan Mukherjee, from April 8 to 16. 

 The participants were Howrah Union, Bulan Cricket and Football Academy, Mainland Sambaran Cricket Academy, Videocon School of Cricket, George Telegraph, Salkia Friends, Tapobhumi Club from Agra, Virat Sports Club from Allahabad, Bournvita Cricket Academy, Khalsa Sporting from Lucknow and Zilla Cricket Sangha from Pratapgarh.

 Mainland Sambaran beat Videocon School, while Bulan Cricket won against George Telegraph in the semi-finals.

 The Bulan Cricket vs George Telegraph match was thrilling. George Telegraph scored 282/5 in 35 overs. The target was tough, but with an unbeaten 140 not out by Sanjay Mishra, Bulan Academy clinched victory by a wicket. In the rain-interrupted final played at Bangabasi grounds, Bulan Cricket went down to Mainland Sambaran after putting up a spirited fight.

 The tournament was a fitting tribute to Bulan Mukherjee, who had devoted his life to cricket.

 THE DIARY

 I am born in a world...

 I am born in a world where brother 

 fights brother,

 Where humanity cries and generations shudder.

 I am born in a world

 where the system droops and pines,

 Where power rapes

 justice and terrorism shines.

 I am born in a world where corruption is the prince,

 Where freedom lies naked to slavery ever since...

 I am born in a world where darkness shadows light,

 Where nothing grows pure, where nothing glitters bright.

 I am born in a world where treachery murders courage,

 Where living titans threaten and stab human knowledge.

 I am born in a world where misery is death?s jaws,

 Where I sob out of shame,

 Where I survive without a cause.

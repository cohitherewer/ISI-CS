 Sell reality, 

 not dreams

 That makes business sense only when 

 one has the product to back the pitch

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This 

 was many years ago. On a leisurely Sunday afternoon, my 

 hosts in Chicago took me with them on their shopping spree. 

 They said they were going to visit a factory outlet. I had 

 no clue what it was. I was expecting a dreary factory gate 

 selling discounted stuff from a caged counter with hundreds 

 queued up before us. Instead, we reached something like 

 an air-conditioned aircraft hangar, huge enough to accommodate 

 at least a couple of jumbo jets. In it was stocked everything 

 from garments to refrigerators, kitchen towels to gardening 

 tools. I was dazed by the sheer magnitude of space and stocks.

 Walking down an aisle, I saw a 

 television set beaming programmes from a popular music channel, 

 and noticed a sign: ?Press this to hear the difference?. 

 There was a small button next to the sign. I looked right, 

 then left, and then mustering enough courage I pressed the 

 button. I was half expecting a minor explosion. Instead, 

 the music changed. Even ears as untrained as mine could 

 only marvel at the sudden change in clarity. It was as if 

 by the touch of a button, I had converted sound into music. 

 It is then that I realised that the sound that was originally 

 coming out of the television had now started waltzing out 

 of two independent speakers attached to either side of the 

 set.

 This little cameo was from Bose 

 Corporation, a conglomerate founded in 1964 by Dr Amar Gopal 

 Bose, then professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts 

 Institute of Technology. As an MIT grad student in the 1950s, 

 Bose decided to purchase a new stereo system. He was disappointed 

 to find that speakers with impressive technical specifications 

 failed to reproduce the realism of a live performance. The 

 quest for better sound was on. The rest as they say is history. 

 I was reminded of my first encounter 

 with Bose when I watched their new television campaign. 

 In this ad, you hear vibrant music and see musicians playing 

 it. The unusual thing is that none of the musicians has 

 an instrument in hand. Yet their physical movements clearly 

 reflect the posture of playing the instruments.

 Advertising has this unfortunate 

 tag: dream-sellers. At times it pays to sell reality as 

 well. That strategy indeed makes a lot of business sense 

 when you have a product as good as Bose speakers. So, on 

 the floor of the Chicago factory outlet, Bose did not want 

 to verbalise anything about the product. They were content 

 to merely create an opportunity to experience their quality. 

 They did that brilliantly. And make no mistake, what they 

 were doing was unabashed advertising.

 This time, the challenge for Bose 

 was far greater. The medium of choice was television, an 

 audio-visual medium that bundles sound with picture. They 

 were selling sound, yet pictures are always more powerful. 

 They could hardly afford the visual part of the communication 

 to run away with the focus. Leaving the screen blank would 

 have meant foregoing the power of visual persuasion.

 The solution is almost as creative 

 as the little drama I experienced on the floors of Sam?s 

 Club, the American factory outlet. The quality of the sound 

 is fantastic. Even more extraordinary is that every single 

 visual frame adds to the rhythm. Every tone of colour adds 

 to the vibrancy of the music. Finally, the absence of instruments 

 in the hands of musicians reminds you that on sale is an 

 aural, rather than visual, experience. These are reasons 

 enough in my book to place this ad in the noteworthy category.

 Yet, they barely encapsulate the 

 greatness of the ad. It never occurred to me that I was 

 hearing all the sound on a Samsung television.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Divided on Marx, path of progress

 - Desh debate at Calcutta Club

 If there is something called dramatic timing, then for the Naturecare-Desh debate on Saturday evening at the Calcutta Club lawns, it was perfect. 

 On the day that the state was most sharply divided on the governments stand on industrialisation, six sharpshooters fought an impassioned verbal war on whether the CPM is right in digging Marxisms grave in Bengal for the sake of development.

 But the few hundred-strong enthusiastic audience did not witness one debate, but several. Bibek Debroy, Abhirup Sarkar and Saifuddin Chowdhury chose to speak in favour of the motion, and Swapan Chakravorty, Ashim Chatterjee and Amiya Bagchi against it. 

 But Debroy and Chatterjee fought a pitched battle on the issue of development the former Naxal leader even called the current illustrations of development beebhatsha maja (terrible fun). 

 Sarkar and Bagchi, both teachers of economics, were busy proving each others views on bad economics; Bagchi added for good measure that glitzy debates only serve to confuse people. 

 All the speakers against the motion insisted that it was impossible to dismiss Marxism so easily, challenging Debroys appeal to finish digging the grave fast and bury Marxism completely. 

 But it was Chakravorty, the only non-economics, non-politics debater, who explained why Marxs theories and ideas can never be outdated, no matter what his so-called followers do with them.

 Chowdhury, who had rebelled against the CPMs policies and formed his own party, and Bagchi, whose leftist leanings are well-known, probably found themselves on the wrong side of the debate. 

 The former could not finally bring himself to praise the CPMs policies, while the latter, much as he would have liked to do it for his opponent, refused to judge whether the ruling party of Bengal is right or wrong. 

 When the moderator, Harsha Dutta, opened the motion for voting, the majority voted in favour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Destiny girl

 Dia Mirza turned down Raja Mukherjee 

 because she suddenly realised that she is still not done 

 with Bollywood. Perhaps, Hrishita Bhatt (picture right) 

 had Bidhaatar Lekha written in her stars. The petite 

 actress, who will be making her Bengali debut opposite the 

 likes of Jeet and Priyanshu Chatterjee, will be seen in 

 the TV premiere of Jawani Diwani on STAR Gold this 

 Sunday at 1 pm.

 It was fun doing a film which was young, and together with Emraan (Hashmi) and Celina (Jaitley) we had a lot of fun, she tells Metro. Also, Jawani Diwani was very different from the serious films I had done till then. Together with Dil Vil Pyar Vyar, it was nice to do the light scenes.

 But will she be able to manage 

 a Bengali film? Why not? she shoots back. My mesho 

 was a Bengali and I spent a lot of days with him when I 

 was a kid. My friends used to actually think that I was 

 a Bengali!

 Mirroring the male makeover

 Lifestyle

 TITHI SARKAR

 In mens wear today, nothing 

 is off limits anymore. Frills, flounces, bows, pleats, see-through 

 sheers, pastels, neons, graffiti, graphics, grunge... anything 

 goes! There are men here, there and everywhere who are wearing 

 all kinds of things their fathers would have thrown a fit 

 over and probably still do! And you thought fashion and 

 style went hand-in-hand with women?

 In what author Shernaaz Engineer 

 describes as a fascinating project in chronicling 

 the contemporary male style idiom, Soul Of Style, 

 a 196-page overview of mens fashion, describes, dissects 

 and sets the ground rules for male style as we perceive 

 it today. The creative endeavour has been supported by Siyaram 

 Silk Mills.

 The volume starts off with a historical 

 perspective of the evolution of mens fashion. Fashion 

 designer Bennu Sehgal points out that men are getting 

 feminine as far as colours are concerned? its a bit 

 of gender-bender ideology at work. Women want to be like 

 men, what with their trousers and crisp corporate shirts. 

 And men want to explore their feminine side.

 Designer Narendra Kumar notes 

 that we have reached a stage of dichotomy where the 

 Indian market doesnt care for Indian clothes unless 

 it is for the odd occasion like a marriage or 

 a festival. Post-1960, we have moved almost entirely into 

 Western silhouettes and styles? it is inevitable that fashion 

 had to move towards a utilitarian function at some point.

 The list of fashion icons includes 

 the Indian maharajas of yore, Jawaharlal Nehru (whose innovation 

 was the Saville Row-patented Nehru jacket), Mahatma Gandhi 

 (who made a political as well as fashion statement with 

 his bare torso), Rajiv Gandhi, M.F. Husain, Amitabh Bachchan, 

 the westernised Dev Anand and the original metrosexual, 

 Rajesh Khanna.

 There are entire chapters dedicated 

 to fabrics, colours, suits, Friday dressing, wedding wear 

 as well as accessories like belts, cufflinks, watches, shoes, 

 pens and wallets. A whole section has been devoted to ties 

 and the many styles of knotting them along with step-by-step 

 illustrations.

 Women havent been altogether 

 left out. In the chapter The Unfair Advantage, there 

 is a low-down on womens dressing in corporate circles, 

 make-up and styling tips.

 Did you know that construction 

 in mens wear parlance meant shoulder padding and other 

 manufacturing processes that add an engineered, three-dimensional 

 shape to a suit jacket? For many more such interesting information, 

 flip through the book.It offers valuable insight into the 

 arena of mens fashion from the likes of Falguni and 

 Shane Peacock, Anita Dongre, Krishna Mehta, Nandita Mahtani, 

 Narendra Kumar, Payal Singhal, Salim Asgarally and Pradeep 

 Hirani.

 Take a look at some striking photographs 

 by Suresh Natrajan. Though not highly stylised, they are 

 good enough to give you an understanding of the clothes 

 that are described in the volume. One of the prime attractions 

 of the book is the style guide at the end ? a set of pencil 

 sketches of attire designs that will make things easier 

 for even the layman. The book is priced at Rs 2,500.

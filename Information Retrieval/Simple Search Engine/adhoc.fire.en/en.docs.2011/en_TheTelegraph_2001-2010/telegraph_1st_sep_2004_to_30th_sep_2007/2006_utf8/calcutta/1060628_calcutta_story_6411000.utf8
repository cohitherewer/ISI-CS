Screen On amp; Off

This Friday, as you watch the images of Superman 

Returns unfold on a big screen near you, you may find it hard to imagine an 

Indian hand in the willing suspension of disbelief. Yet, Mumbai?s 23-year-old 

digital compositor Achint Bansal?s invisible signature punctuates many a spectacular 

shot that all add up to herald the dramatic return of the man in blue tights.

The ocean and water effects that form an integral 

part of the visual design of the Bryan Singer movie was awarded to the Oscar-winning 

Rhythm amp; Hues Studio in Los Angeles. It?s India office in Mumbai, that has 

been involved in movies like Chronicles of Narnia and the upcoming Garfield 

2, was given a part of the assignment and Achint got into action.

?Just like outsourcing in every field, special effects 

too comes cheap if done in India,? explains Achint, who is a graduate in Applied 

Arts and has also dabbled in graphic design.

?We are given a deadline and certain tasks around 

a particular set of images, and 25 to 30 of us get going together,? adds Achint.

And then he goes about digitally composting the shots. 

?It is basically arranging layers and layers of images and putting it all together 

as one single image,? Achint describes. ?It is more about fooling audiences to 

believe that there is just this one whole image while in reality there can be 

thousands of separate frames shot against green screens and placed one above the 

other.?

When it came to Superman Returns, Achint and 

company had to handle a lot of complex wire removals. ?Most of their stunts are 

using wires and for a film like Superman, it only gets more,? says the 

Mumbai boy. ?So one of our most important jobs was to use previous frames as references 

and reconstruct those new portions in the given frames where the wires were passing. 

More than adding more things, a lot of the work is always about cleaning up the 

frames.?

The cape was a problem point on the post-production 

table. ?It had a lot of wrinkles in most of the shots,? recalls Achint. ?So we 

had to create computer generated (CG) capes in many shots. It helped enhance the 

overall Superman image to have a wrinkle-free cape flowing behind him.?

Achint feels blessed for having got such enviable 

assignments. ?It?s a lovely job,? he smiles. ?You have the whole world waiting 

for Superman to return and here I am giving personal touches to frames featuring 

him.?

What?s more, director Singer himself would review 

his work. ?After my job is done, the shots are passed through several stages to 

the final correction table when the director himself sits with the images.?

Given a chance, Achint would loved to have worked 

on special effects for Indian movies but his job at Rhythm and Hues India didn?t 

allow him to do so. ?We would only get foreign work,? he admits. ?Given the right 

budgets I feel Indian cinema can easily have the best of special effects. I am 

yet to catch Krrish but I believe the effects are on a par with the West. 

Even Paheli had very good special effects.?

What is ?very good special effects?? ?Invisible effects,? 

comes the ready reply from Achint. ?When the audience cannot differentiate between 

what is real and what is made up, those are excellent special effects.?

And there are plenty of such invisible effects in 

Superman Returns that has Brandon Routh resurrecting the legacy.

?There is a scene in the last half hour of the movie 

when Superman hurls a plane into the sky,? an animated Achint goes back in time. 

?Everything in that scene from the plane to the sea and mountains in the background 

are CG created in LA and placed by us.?

Apart from the effects, what?s invisible is the hard 

work involved. What lasts on the screen for a few seconds can take months to achieve. 

?One single difficult shot might take two weeks to get right,? says Achint, who 

has now quit Rhythm amp; Hues to chase his dreams of making movies himself.

?I can assure you it will be full of special effects,? 

he signs off.

 Experimenting with new dance styles by merging existing forms is a passion with choreographer, dancer and teacher Sukalyan Bhattacharya. Hosted by EZCC, Sristhi O Rhiti, this evening?s presentation by Bhattacharya and his troupe, bears testimony to his successful attempts in devising innovative choreographic techniques. A dance collage, it has been conceived by synthesizing several classical and semi-classical Indian forms like Bharata Natyam, Manipuri and Odissi. Clearly an experimental composition, the performance also includes motions and rhythms influenced by martial arts, folk and contemporary styles like Chhau, Kalari, Thang Ta and various other provincial folk and tribal forms of India. The dance presentation will be accompanied by songs, also drawn from a blend of north and south Indian ragas, Hindi, Bengali and Sanskrit songs and folk music of India.

 Event: Dance collage of classical and semi-classical forms 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

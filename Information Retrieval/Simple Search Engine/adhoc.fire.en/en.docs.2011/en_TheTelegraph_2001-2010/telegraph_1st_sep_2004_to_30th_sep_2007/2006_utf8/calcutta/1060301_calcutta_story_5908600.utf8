 Court raps cops for citizen neglect

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has expressed concern over the increase in the number of writ petitions filed before it pertaining to the police?s failure in protecting the fundamental rights of the city?s residents.

 ?Police should be more active in protecting law-abiding citizens. The force must come to the aid of those who are facing trouble from their kin,? stated Justice G.C. Gupta, while hearing a case filed by a widow, who has allegedly been driven out of her house by her son.

 Justice Gupta on Tuesday directed Arpan Ghosh to vacate his mother Kamala?s house. Arpan had been residing there for two months. 

 ?These types of problems should be solved by police before they reach the court,? the judge remarked. 

 The petitioner, a resident of north Calcutta, alleged before the court that even after repeated complaints, officers of Shyampukur police station did not take any action against her son, who was not allowing her to stay in her own house.

 ?In 1999, Arpan forced my client and her husband Amarendra out of their house on Durgacharan Mukherjee Road. They had to move into a rented house. Amarendra died in 2003,? Kamala?s counsel Partha Chakraborty told the court.

 He continued: ?After her husband?s death, my client repeatedly requested her son to let her stay in the house, but to no avail. The situation forced my client to lodge complaints with Shyampukur police station. The police refused to intervene in the matter.?

 Appearing for the police, state counsel Suman Ghosh told the court: ?Since it is a family dispute, the police have nothing to do except show sympathy towards the widow.?

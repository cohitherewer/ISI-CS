 Cops hit clue trail in Garia murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two days after Sachin Mukherjee?s murder, the police on Tuesday claimed to have stumbled upon evidence suggesting that his killers were hired by those who were opposed to the Trinamul Congress leader?s plan of developing a brick kiln, spread over 30 bighas in Bramhapur, Garia.

 The killers, cops claimed, were paid close to Rs 2 lakh.

 The 65-year-old leader was shot dead by a gang yards away from his office on Kali Chatterjee Avenue, in Sonarpur, on Sunday night. The assailants came on two motorcycles and fired two bullets from point-blank range. One missed Mukherjee, the other pierced his chest.

 ?Certain leads have emerged from our scan of Mukherjee?s business details,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. ?We hope the information will help unravel the mystery. Two more persons have been detained.?

 Among them is Mukherjee?s driver Liaquat. Sleuths are trying to ascertain where he was at the time of the murder.

 Officers said the killers were keeping track of Mukherjee for some days. They even turned up at a Narendrapur site, where the leader joined his family for a picnic on Sunday morning.

 The youths had turned up riding two motorcycles and left after inquiring about Mukherjee. 

 In the evening, when they gathered in front of his office, they apparently knew that someone would call the leader and that he would step out to meet him.

 Sure of what they knew, the youths, still on their motorcycles, took cover in the darkness and waited for Mukherjee. As he stepped out, they drove close to him and fired the bullets. 

 Police have found one of the vehicles, but refused to divulge details.

 In the Assembly, Trinamul and Congress members walked out to protest the ?gruesome murder?. 

 Leaders of both parties demanded a discussion on the issue, but Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim allowed only a ?mention?.

 Later, parliamentary affairs minister Probodh Chandra Sinha told the House that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will speak on this issue on February 14.

 Protests were also reported from Garia, where a group of Trinamul workers set up a blockade for over an hour, from 1 pm.

 Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee and Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay were present. Both claimed that Mukherjee?s murder was masterminded by the CPM.

 Mamata Banerjee, while addressing a meeting of party workers at the CPT Ground in Taratala, claimed that policemen, led by an additional superintendent, had plotted to ?knock her down? on Sunday night, when she turned up at the murder spot.

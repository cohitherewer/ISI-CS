 Classics reanimated

 Oxford Bookstore and Oxford University Press recently released a series of ?writings of enduring value? ? The Oxford India Collection ? keeping young readers in mind. And who better to liven up the launch than youngsters? Satyajit Mallick, Sukanya Mukherjee and Satovisha Banerjee of The Heritage School put up a skit, based on The Naive Friends from The Oxford Illustrated Premchand. Colourful paintings and spirited acting brought to life this story about two children?s curiosity about bird eggs.

 Mrinalini Majumdar and Aparna Chaudhuri followed it up with a narration of a delightful tale about a hunter, Kunwar Singh, from The Second Oxford India Illustrated Corbett. Their skillful voice modulations evoked visions of wild forests and fearsome man-eaters. Anmol Nautiyal and Nabonita Kayal of Apeejay School provided a suitable finish to the event with their recitation of Tagore?s humourous poems The Invention of Shoes and The Tiger.

 Prof Sukanta Chaudhuri, editor of the Oxford India Illustrated Children?s Tagore, along with Vidisha Ghosh, enriched the event with their crisp introductions to the authors as well as this series.

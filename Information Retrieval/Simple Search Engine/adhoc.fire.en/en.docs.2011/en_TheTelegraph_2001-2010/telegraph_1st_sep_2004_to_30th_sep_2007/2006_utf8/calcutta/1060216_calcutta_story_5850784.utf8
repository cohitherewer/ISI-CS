 From Pearl S. Bucks English screenplay of Vijay Anands Guide to the original composer of The Chariots of Fire, it was one big mind battle last Saturday evening at the Saturday Club as The Telegraph presented The M2 Challenge ? An Inter-corporate Quiz on Movies and Media.

 The event was meant to raise funds for Concern India Foundation, an NGO working for the betterment of underprivileged children.

 After a 25-question preliminary round, which threw up posers on everything from Paul Bettanys star turn as Russell Crowes imaginary friend in A Beautiful Mind to Ram Kumar Bismils penning of Rang de basanti, eight teams made it to the final ? Wipro, TCS, Bates, ITC, The Telegraph, SAIL, Rediffusion and JWT.

 The eight-round final conducted by Gaurav Gupta and researched by Raka Dutta had everything from catchy visual questions and buzzer rounds to music clues and media connections. The opening round required the teams to identify everything from unfinished film posters to snatches from Ekta Kapoors similar-looking K-serials.

 The visual round was the most entertaining, mixing the first ever music video on MTV with Charlie Chaplins hilarious act in The Great Dictator.

 It was the TCS team that led the scoreboard from Round One till it was crowned champion. The three-member team had taken the Saturday Club quiz stage moments after winning a management quiz at The Park. From bottles of wine to free stays at luxury haunts to DVD players, the winners did take it all.

 Rediffusion and The Telegraph were tied at second spot, but it took all of one tie-breaker question for the ad agency to end up as first runners-up. 

 Theatre personality Renu Roy, who heads the entertainment committee of Saturday Club, handed over prizes to the top three teams.

 The Seagull Foundation for the Arts presents Just By The Way: Rocks Clouds and Nudes, an exhibition of photographs by Raghu Rai. Featuring rocks, landscapes and feminine forms, the show collates the physical and the emotional, the tangible and the abstract, the conscious and the sub-conscious into a neutral whole, with the effect of overwhelming the viewer. In Rais works, rocks, formed by the earth and carved by the winds, begin to resemble ancient people. The mystery of the female body is evoked through its apparent familiarity. Clouds appear as ethereal, endless forms, ever merging and disappearing, as if they never were. Hosted as part of Tasveer, a project that aims to showcase contemporary Indian photography, encouraging it as a form that captures fragments of time and memory.

 Margaret Jenkins Dance Company (MJDC) and Tanusree Shankar Dance Company (TSDC)?s joint venture, A Slipping Glimpse, a cross-cultural, multi-disciplinary performance, will be launched at the Yerba Buena Centre for the Arts, San Francisco, on May 17. The collaborative project, crystallising over the past three years, will then travel across America, Europe and India.

 Reputed choreographer Jenkins believes that the ?artistic adventure? will help ?find a movement language that is at once our own and foreign, a kind of third term, not exactly self and not exactly other, not exactly us and not exactly them, but an unbounded space in between?.

 Eight dancers of MJDC and four from TSDC are practising their moves, while poet Michael Palmer (collaborating in the narrative armature), visual designer Alexander Nicholas, composer Paul Dresher are all ready to work their magic. But everything is still fluid, only Jenkins knows what A Slipping Glimpse will be like.

 ?Jenkins was one of the series of foreign choreographers we have been inviting for residencies. The 2003 workshop with our students culminating in the presentation Gates of Passages impressed her so much that she invited two of our students for another workshop in Cochin, 2005 before inviting us for this project,? said Tanusree Shankar. 

 According to her, ?we have fabulous talents in Bengal, but they need exposure and platforms. It is not enough to preserve our own styles and close the door. One must take every opportunity to see, adapt and grow without losing our own identity.? 

 The TSDC dancers, Jaydip Guha, Debjit Burman, Rashmi Karmakar and Sulagna Sarkar, explained that Jenkins had asked them each to develop vignettes focusing on specific parts of the body. They were not given any music or thematic guidelines. 

 The pieces rehearsed on the basis of counting patterns and feelings were recorded and sent to her for approval. The final pieces ? four solos, four duets, four quartets and one male duet ? were made according to her suggestions but they are still essentially Indian, of the Shankar New Dance school.

 ?This is one of the essential cross-cultural collaborations we are happy to be a part of. There will be more in coming months,? said Susan Shultz , director, the American Center.

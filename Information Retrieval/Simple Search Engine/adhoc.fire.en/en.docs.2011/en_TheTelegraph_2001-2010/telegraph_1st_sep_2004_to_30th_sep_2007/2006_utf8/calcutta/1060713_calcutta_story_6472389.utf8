 Salman Khan and Ali Larter 

 in Marigold

 With Bollywood doing fantastic business overseas in 2006, now even Indian film corporations are looking west for their next natural progression. Adlabs Films Limited and Ashok Amritraj?s Hyde Park Entertainment Group have just sealed a multi-million dollar co-production film financing deal. This formally establishes Adlabs?s presence in mainstream Hollywood, having already co-produced Willard Caroll?s Salman Khan-Ali Larter starrer Marigold with Hyperion Pictures.

 This ground-breaking co-production alliance between a major Indian entertainment company and a high-profile Hollywood player will see Indian rupees being invested in big movie projects in the west. Hyde Park itself has a five-year first-look co-production financing and distribution deal with Twentieth Century Fox and continues to maintain its long-standing second-look co-production financing deal with the Walt Disney Company.

 Over the past 20 years, Ashok Amritraj ? brother of former Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj and no mean doubles player himself in his time ? has produced over 90 films. Some of the Hyde Park Entertainment Group box office hits include Bringing Down The House (Steve Martin and Queen Latifah), Raising Helen (Kate Hudson) and Walking Tall (Rock). Among forthcoming films, Hyde Park can boast of the Sandra Bullock-starrer Premonition and the Kevin Bacon movie Death Sentence.

 While no concrete co-production project has come up yet, Adlabs chairman-cum-managing director Manmohan Shetty is excited about the prospects. ?We have been testing the Hollywood market for some time now and this joint venture with Hyde Park is part of our expansion plans overseas,? he says. ?We have been evaluating various scripts and have set October as the date to announce our first joint project.?

 Full of quips and witty repartees, Nandipat?s play Ballavpurer Roopkatha exposes, through the medium of a genial satire, the pompousness and false grandeur of the erstwhile wealthy, land-owning classes. Bhupati Roy, the insolvent yet proud descendant of such a landowner, is trying in vain to elude his creditors. In a desperate bid to save himself from humiliation, he lets out the news that he is selling off his ancestral mansion to repay his debts. His friend, Sanjib, posing as his estate manager, gets hold of a prospective buyer, Mr Halder. Besides being impressed by the old building, Mr Halder is attracted by its incredibly low price. Moreover, his daughter falls in love with Raghupati, a phantom inhabiting the mansion, to which Mrs Halder strongly objects. Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhury, a rich merchant, also expresses interest in purchasing the property. Poised for an exciting climax and, finally, a surprising revelation, the play provides all the ingredients for an evening of rollicking entertainment. Play: Badal Sarcar. Direction: Prakash Bhattacharya.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Ballavpurer Roopkatha, by Nandipat 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

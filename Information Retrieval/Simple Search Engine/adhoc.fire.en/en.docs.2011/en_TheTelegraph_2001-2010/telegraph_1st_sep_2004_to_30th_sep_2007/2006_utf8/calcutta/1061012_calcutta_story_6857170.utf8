 The 87 prints of Georg Baselitz, an exhibition of which opens in CIMA Gallery on Friday, offer a rare glimpse of the works of a major German artist. 

 His endeavour, from the beginning of his career, has been to stand on their head, literally and figuratively, the aesthetic conventions prevalent in a fractured Germany in the late 1950s.

 The irony of it is that while that may have been the original intention of the 1938-born artist, Indian viewers will be moved by the beauty, however disturbing and subversive their expression and content may be, of Baselitzs work. 

 This show, entitled Printed Works 1965-1992, is jointly organised by Max Mueller Bhavan, Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, Stuttgart, and CIMA.

 It, no doubt, shows how the most familiar images, like that of an eagle or a nude of both genders while remaining recognisable, can be given an altogether different twist. This is done by their positioning, the section of the image the artist has chosen to focus, and by the way these are viewed through a grid or a maze of lines behind which the image is barely visible. 

 This becomes clear when we see his pastoral pictures, in which beasts of the field are entangled in a mesh. 

 The other device by which the artist achieves this effect is by displaying the works upside down, thereby standing logic on its head, and allowing the viewer to distance himself from the image, and as Gtz Adriani had written in the catalogue article, recognise much more clearly the rich interconnections of colour and form.

 That had been Baselitzs original aim to subvert representational art even when he painted recognisable forms by redirecting attention to the surface that had been painted over with pigment. 

 At the same time, he distanced himself from abstraction, although very often his works refused to represent external, recognisable reality, which is the very purpose of abstract art.

 Baselitzs human figures are severely deformed, often viewed from angles which have a disfiguring effect on them. 

 Even when he represents heroic beings, they are shown stripped of power and in a degraded state. Their bodily excrescences were often deemed obscene and Baselitz was once hauled up by the censors. He tried to defeat representation by remaining representational. This is duality is the essence of his art.

 Baselitz began as a painter and in 1963, he discovered the potential of prints. He attacked metal plates and wood blocks with the same gusto he stabbed his canvases with his brush or fingers. His prints, black and white or in colour, are mine fields which bear the marks of explosions of energy. They testify to the amazing vitality of this artist.

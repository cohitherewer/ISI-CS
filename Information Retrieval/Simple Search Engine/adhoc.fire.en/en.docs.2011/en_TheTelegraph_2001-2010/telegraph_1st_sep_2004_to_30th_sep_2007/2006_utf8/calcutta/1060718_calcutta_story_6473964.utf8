 Push to cut cancer stick health risk

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 A grim but inescapable fact about quitting smoking is that 75 to 80 per cent of those who give up the cancer stick will be smoking again within two years. Very few smokers quit via the ?cold turkey? route. Most opt for nicotine replacement therapy or alternative solutions such as acupuncture. 

 A new organisation called Tobacco Harm Reduction Foundation (THRF) recognises that some people find quitting nearly impossible and so, steps towards damage limitation are crucial in the fight against the multitude of fatal illnesses that can arise from taking to the cigarette.

 M. Wali, a doctor at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, and member of the THRF team, highlighted the foundation?s perspective on tackling the issue of smoking-related deaths. 

 ?We are not campaigning against the tobacco companies, we are advocating the introduction of cigarettes that contain as little of the carcinogenic elements as possible.?

 Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are mainly a result of the curing and processing of tobacco, and are also the chief culprits in tobacco-related deaths. 

 THRF?s objective is to campaign for the introduction of tobacco products with a lowered TSNA content, which will then significantly reduce the risk of smokers developing fatal illnesses. 

 Dr Aparna Kumar, a member of THRF and a tobacco cessation expert, pointed out that ?such products have been available in the West for some time. It is very important that they are introduced in India?.

 Wali explained: ?In order to encourage the government to take action on this, we need to gather as much support as possible. We hope to see some legislation come into force.? 

 According to Kumar, THRF is not against tobacco companies because ?the livelihoods of many poor farmers depend upon tobacco as a crop. The government also obtains huge revenues through taxes?.

 He added: ?What we want to avoid is a situation where cigarettes with lowered TSNA content attracts a new generation of smokers.?

 Still in its infancy as an organisation, THRF is set to expand ?with a network of associates to partner in progress towards a healthier India?.

 Return of alternative voice

 - Ballet, music video on sexual minorities

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Alien Flower in action

 Two path-breaking expressions of solidarity with the Indian lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are returning before the public on June 27 at GD Birla Sabhagar. While one of them, Alien Flower, premiered on June 1, 1996 as ?India?s first ballet on same-gender love? by Sapphire Creations Dance Workshops. The other, Pokkhiraaj ? The Pegasus, came out in 2005 as ?India?s first music-video on LGBT rights? by the Bangla band Cactus. 

 ?Times have changed? the LGBT community is acknowledged, if not accepted, and is heard, if not understood,? said Sudarshan Chakravorty, director of Alien Flower. His words are borne out by the fact that the Cactus video was made with the help of LGBT support groups like Amitie, Swikriti and SAATHI. 

 But Chakravorty still remembers the uproar the first show of Alien Flower had caused. ?Since it stirred the narrow complacence of society and authority, it was dismissed for having improper Western influence. Sapphire was ostracised as dance leagues threatened to cancel hall bookings. We dancers were roughed up while putting up posters that carried the words ?Celebrate Your Sexuality?. Ten years on, we still carry some of that flak as our baggage,? he said.

 Eight poems by Sanjay Vasa and Rakseh Ratti are interwoven with interviews of 50 gay men from various educational, cultural and economic backgrounds in the ballet. It focuses on the trials and tribulations of a gay man.

 In the process, it gives artistic representation to the anxieties of marginalised communities and sends out the message that every new-born should be given its space as a member of the human race, free of bias over gender, colour, religion or sexuality.

 For a new experimental dance company, such a controversial project had its risks but with time, the project proved worthwhile. Alien Flower, presented at Uday Shankar Dance Festival and nominated for the Uday Shankar Award moved from Puri Beach Festival and India International Centre in Delhi to stages in Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur and other places. It showed the way dance, too, could be used to represent and project a social cause. 

 The 10th anniversary of Alien Flower at Birla Sabhagar will also feature a discussion on ?Changing Portrayals of Gender and Sexuality in the Arts and Media ? The Last Decade?. Taking the dais will be activist Owais Khan, filmmaker Anindita Sarbadhicari, Cactus frontman Siddhartha Roy and others. The programme, supported by SAATHI, Elton John AIDS Foundation, London, Senco Jewellery Centre and INTERKLUB, will begin at 7 pm.

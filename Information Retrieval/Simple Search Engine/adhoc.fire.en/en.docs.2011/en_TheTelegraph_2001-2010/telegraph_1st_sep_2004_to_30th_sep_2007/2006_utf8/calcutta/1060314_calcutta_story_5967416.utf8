The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Man behind the Truman show

 This year?s Best Actor Oscar winner for his astonishing performance of the troubled writer, PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN has always been the odd man out

Hello, Hoffman 

 Born in 1967 in Fairport, New York

 Was a promising athlete and wrestler before a neck injury took him off 

the mat and got him into acting

 Stacked shelves at a New York City grocery 

 Landed his first notable film role as a backstabbing college student in 

the Al Pacino film Scent of a Woman (1992)

 On stage, alternated roles with John C. Reilly in Sam Shepards True 

West on Broadway in 2000

 Made his big-screen breakthrough as Scotty, the hapless film crew member 

with a crush on porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Andersons Boogie Nights 

(1997)

 His offbeat screen roles include a lonely obscene telephone caller (Happiness, 

1998); a pre-op transsexual vocal teacher (Flawless, 1999); the gentle nurse of 

a dying man (Magnolia, 1999); a leering trust-fund playboy (The Talented Mr Ripley, 

1999); and a defrocked preacher tempted by carnal sins (Cold Mountain, 2003)

 It is difficult to believe that the burly, jovial man could so successfully transform himself into Truman Capote, the flamboyant, diminutive author known for his fey mannerisms, high, lilting voice and over-the-top affectations. 

 The role is an actor?s nightmare but in Capote, Hoffman gives an astonishing performance as the self-absorbed and ultimately self-destructive writer, who spent six years researching and writing In Cold Blood, a ?nonfiction novel? about the murders of a farming family in Holcomb, Kansas. 

 It is a performance that has already won Hoffman a slew of awards including the Best Actor Oscar. The honours have assuredly established his name as a familiar one to filmgoers, many of whom until now, he says, have known him mainly as ?the weird guy?. 

 When Hoffman was offered the role by the writer, Dan Futterman, and director, Bennett Miller, both friends of his from school who had never worked on a feature film, he had other things on his mind: a gruelling Broadway production of Long Day?s Journey Into Night, and his girlfriend had just had a baby. 

 ?I was shocked when they asked me. I?m 5ft 9in, and at the time I was really big ? a roly-poly guy who weighed about 240 pounds,? he recalls. ?I didn?t say, ?Yeah, good idea.?? But he read the script, started investigating Capote?s life and began to see some resemblances. ?When I started studying him and then became semi-obsessed with him, I saw the parallels,? he says. 

 There were physical parallels. ?When I started seeing pictures of him in his personal environment, not his public one, his hair and his complexion were very similar to mine. I knew I had to get small and had to work with the voice and physicality. Once I did that, and the closer I got, the more it all started coming together. 

 ?I lost a lot of weight, and I got as thin as I could, but I still had a fleshy face; but because he had a very fleshy face, that helped a lot. It was petrifying for a while because you don?t want to mimic him and you don?t want to just do a stunt, but the story was so important that I knew if I served the story, this character would come alive. If audiences are moved by the story and caught up in it, the performances become secondary. I don?t want to have any false humility, but the story is the star in this film.? 

 Hoffman is a person who tends to merge into the background when he is not on stage or screen. He has a rumpled look about him and looks more like a lumberjack than one of America?s most gifted actors. 

 Capote begins in 1959 after a pair of drifters have broken into the home of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, and shot all four of its members. That night the author of Breakfast at Tiffany?s boarded a train to Kansas with his childhood friend, Harper Lee, who later wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, with the intention of writing a magazine piece on how the murders had affected the quiet farming community. 

 Six years later, he published In Cold Blood, which made him the most famous writer in America, but ruined his life. The film recreates the years between Capote?s first trip to Holcomb and the spectacular success of his book, focusing on Capote?s increasingly intense relationship with one of the killers, Perry Smith, whom he befriended and helped while at the same time trying to get him to confess in detail what had happened that night in the Clutter house. 

 Hoffman, who became a co-producer of the film, spent five months preparing for the role by reading everything by and about the writer, studying his letters to and from Smith, listening to tapes and watching his television appearances, although most of them were not very helpful, because they occurred later in Capote?s life, when he was addled by drugs and alcohol. Capote died in 1984, aged 59. 

 ?I wanted to capture the man at the height of his powers, not when he was diseased,? says Hoffman. Capote was filmed over 36 days in the freezing cold of Winnipeg, Canada, and Hoffman stayed in character for most of the time, a choice that caused some confusion on set. 

 Asked what was the hardest thing about making Capote, director Miller immediately replies: ?Working with Phil. Phil is just brutal on himself. He was unforgiving, challenging, unrelenting. Everything had to be just right.? Hoffman says in his defence: ?It was the kind of role that technically I had to stay with because if I let it go it was pretty hard to try to get it back. So during the day, even in between shots and during breaks, I?d try and stay in character vocally and physically so I wouldn?t have to try to bring it back up.? 

 Philip Seymour Hoffman in and as Capote 

For Hoffman, Capote posed enormous problems, not because 

of the physical challenges, which an actor of his calibre could master, but because 

Hoffman insisted on knowing what propelled the man to make the choices he did 

and the extent of his duplicity in his dealings with Smith. Ultimately Capote 

is forced to face his own naked ambition and his complicity in the executions 

of the murderers, which he needs to provide an ending to his book. 

 ?Ultimately the film asks the subtle question: did this writer commit a crime? A crime of the heart? A crime of the mind? His emotional and psychological lives were of the utmost importance,? says Hoffman. Capote took such a toll on him that after it wrapped he turned down a number of demanding parts and opted to tackle a showy villainous role in the upcoming Mission: Impossible 3, his first big-budget action thriller since 1996?s Twister. 

 It sounds like a role he could coast through, but that is not Hoffman?s way. ?You have to get the emotional and intellectual logic of the character,? he says. ?It?s an endless exploration of the character as a spirit, as a human being and why they?re doing what they?re doing. You can?t just be rudimentary about it.?

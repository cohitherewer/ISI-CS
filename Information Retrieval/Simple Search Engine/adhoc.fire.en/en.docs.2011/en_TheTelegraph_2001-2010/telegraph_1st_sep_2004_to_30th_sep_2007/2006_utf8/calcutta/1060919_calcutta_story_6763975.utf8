 John Abraham, Kabir 

 Khan and Arshad Warsi in front of their hotel in Toronto.

 KABIR KHAN

 You have been to international documentary festivals but 

 this time it was a feature festival and that too Toronto

 Yes, it was a huge difference 

 in terms of scale. There is a certain sense of grandeur 

 attached to these festivals which documentary fests do not 

 have. And the Toronto International Film Festival is the 

 biggest one today. If your film is here, all eyes are on 

 you. 

 Also, this time there was a huge 

 Hollywood presence with some big film premiering every night. 

 The biggest of stars were there Brad Pitt, Penelope Cruz, 

 Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, JLo they were 

 all there. So that was very exciting for us. We got a huge 

 global platform to show Kabul Express. We at Yash 

 Raj are huge in India but we need to make it big abroad 

 too.

 You did not have Brad Pitt but you had John Abraham!

 Yes, yes (laughs). He was 

 in Toronto last year for the opening of Water and 

 he is now recognised all over in Toronto. Its quite unbelievable. 

 How did the press screenings go?

 They went off very well. The biggest 

 thrill is that they are very keen about Indian cinema. We 

 have had varying perspectives from the critics. Kabul 

 Express got a multi-dimensional response. It has been 

 a great learning experience.

 Overall, how big was Indian cinema this time at Toronto 

 International Film Festival?

 See, the Toronto International 

 Film Festival is huge. There were so many films. But there 

 was a buzz about Kabul Express. They were excited 

 about the film because they looked at it as a breakthrough 

 for Indian cinema. 

 They were aware that the film 

 represented the largest film industry in the world, but 

 not the mainstream, which also had a great representation 

 there. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna which is very much 

 a true blue Bollywood film got a great response. So, they 

 saw Kabul Express as a very unique film.

 Also, the Canadians were very 

 excited about watching the film because it is topical for 

 them, with Canadians fighting the Taliban at the frontline. 

 Both the shows of Kabul Express had been sold out 

 weeks in advance.

 With the film going big at festivals, will the commercial 

 release take a backseat?

 Not really. We will release in 

 India by the end of the year but we will also travel to 

 international film festivals like Pusan, London and maybe 

 Dubai.

 ARSHAD WARSI

 Arshad as Circuit 

 in Lage Raho Munnabhai 

 How was Circuit doing in Toronto?

 I did alright.

 Everyone there was bumping into Hollywood stars

 See, nobody was bumping into anybody. 

 They were all forcing themselves on the international stars.

 And so whom did you force yourself on?

 Me? Me? Arey kya naam hai uska? 

 Morgan Freeman Morgan Freeman. We just crossed each other 

 in the lobby.

 Kabul Express is unlike anything you have done before

 Its not that. To me, its just 

 another character, another job. Just like you write different 

 articles. Now you are writing about me. Tomorrow you will 

 write about some music guy. My only effort is to justify 

 every character I play and then move on. Only, theres a 

 bit of mind that goes into it.

 But you have never played such a real character like the 

 photographer in Kabul Express

 Ill tell you what. When I did 

 Munnabhai MBBS, everybody talked about Circuit. Now 

 after Lage Raho Munnabhai, they are talking about 

 Arshad Warsi. So they have all suddenly realised that this 

 guy can act. Now that will help people to accept me in films 

 like Saher and Kabul Express. The variations, 

 of course, make me happy.

 Do you think Circuit will be stuck to you forever?

 Circuit will never go. In an actors 

 life, some characters are immortalised. Come on, theres 

 only one Gabbar Singh. But films like Kabul Express will 

 showcase me as an actor. Im not that bad an actor.

 It must have been tough shooting in Kabul...

 Oh yes, it was very tough. Theres 

 no two ways about it. It was scary too. The weather was 

 difficult. Food was an issue. Then theres so much of desert. 

 Every way it was difficult. I keep telling everyone in the 

 industry that no Indian actor would have done the film. 

 Just because John and I are these warped guys, we kept at 

 it. But you know what, given a chance I will start shooting 

 for the film all over again.

 You never wanted to just give up and come back home?

 Never. All the time, I knew what 

 I was getting into. Today I can sit back and enjoy the film 

 and be proud about it.

 Are Indians really being accepted in a big international 

 film festival like Toronto?

 I would say India is becoming 

 a significant part of the whole process. We are not taken 

 lightly anymore and not mistaken as makers of senseless 

 movies. There was this huge write-up in Screen. You 

 got to see it. They were very curious about these two Bollywood 

 actors who went to Afghanisthan to make a film. And what 

 kind of a film! We are definitely going extremely international 

 and we are only going to get stronger.

 Given a choice between the star-studded international red 

 carpet and the hordes of aam janta back home, which 

 one will you go for?

 Listen, I dont want to get into 

 Hollywood movies or anything. I was there only for Kabul 

 Express. This whole schmoozing with Hollywood folks 

 does not interest me. I prefer the coins on the screen back 

 home.

 Mobile madam: Sameera 

 Reddy

 Shes no longer just our JLo, shes now also our Lara Croft! Sameera Reddy is now the face (and body) of Indian gaming. Premier game development company Paradox has tied up with Sameera for the development of mobile games. The company has got a two-year contract to create six mobile titles based on the Musafir star. 

 The games will feature the actress in a variety of avatars, capturing her personal and professional image in a virtual world. The games aspire to provide yet another platform for Sameera to reach out to her audience. They also give an opportunity to her fans to play as Sameera herself. The first game that has currently been released is Sameera: The Street Fighter featuring her as an ancient warrior princess on a mission to defeat the tribes who have invaded her fathers regime.

 The game has been released on Reliance Mobile World, Idea Cellular and other leading mobile networks. The game culminates in a Win a Date with Sameera contest. The winner gets a chance to woo the actor on an exclusive date.

 Commenting on the game, Sameera said: Its a great game and it will be a thrilling experience to connect with my fans on such an interesting and unique platform. Mobile games are gaining huge popularity in India and I am excited to see how the audiences will react to my games.

 On the alliance, Salil Bhargava, CEO of Paradox, said: Were sure Sameeras image as a vibrant and versatile actor will help fuel the popularity of our games. Shes an avid gamer herself and we are looking forward to a continuing association with her to create some great games.

 Sayantani Ghosh was happy playing the good bahu in Kumkum until the serial producers decided to turn her into a vamp. But the city girl, who was chosen to play Antara Wadhwa in the popular STAR Plus soap, cringing at the idea of playing villain so early on in her career, has taken the exit door.

 I was meant to carry a pleasing 

 reflection of Kumkum with positive traits after becoming 

 the next bahu in the serial, but things took an unexpected 

 turn with abrupt changes in the plot, said Sayantani from 

 Mumbai. I gave myself some time to see how the character 

 shapes up but Im not comfortable doing negative roles at 

 the start of my career. 

 After an amicable parting with BAG Films, Sayantani is focussing hard on Tollywood, which she had left behind thanks to the Swapno fiasco and the STAR Plus offer.

 An ex-runner up at Sananda Tilottama, the girl hit the the big screen after a stint in modelling and acting in tele-serials and commercials. After Raju Uncle, Swapno and Nayak, she is starring opposite Prosenjit again, in Sujit Guhas Sangharsh.

 Five months from now, Sayantani 

 would no longer be Antara of Kumkum, but she feels 

 its not yet time to pack her bags. Talks are on for more 

 TV serials in Mumbai though nothing has been finalised as 

 of now, said she, keeping her fingers crossed.

 Come September 18 and AXN presents the exciting new season of the Emmy award winning reality series The Amazing Race. The 10th season, which premieres next Monday at 8 pm, has turned out to be the most exciting and competitive so far, with 12 teams this time to raise the stakes. 

 In a true celebration of diversity, contestants include the first-ever Muslim team, a pair of Miss USA contestants, a one-legged triathlete and a father and his lesbian daughter. Also, in a surprise move, teams will be thrown into a culture shock from the beginning of the race, landing themselves halfway around the world in China. Language and culture barriers, along with detours and fast forwards, could level any difference and throw the leading teams right to the end.

 Is being well-travelled enough, or will they have to use their streetsmartness, charm and pure instinct? With teams of stunning male models, cheerleading captains and reigning Miss USAs, maybe good looks could just be the ticket to the cool $1 million prize.

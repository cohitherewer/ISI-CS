 Bernd Borchardt: Ties on the mend. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 The centre of gravity of history is moving towards the East and even if it?s a touch difficult for some Westerners to ?digest it?, you could swim against the tide at your own peril, feels Bernd Borchardt, head of division for South Asia, Federal foreign office, Germany.

 In Calcutta for the second time in two-and-a-half years, the chief of the Asian network of German diplomatic missions has seen a ?paradigm shift? that has warmed his heart and augurs well for the city?s connect with the European powerhouse, he is convinced.

 ?The all-round progress is there for all to see ? cleaner roads, more organised traffic, swank shopping malls and better service standards. The fact that Calcutta has traversed so much ground in so little time, gives us reason to believe the perception of the city back in Berlin is clearly on the mend,? Borchardt tells Metro.

 As the ?partner country? at the Hannover technology fair and ?guest of honour country? at the Frankfurt Book Fair, India has been attracting ?great attention? in Germany, and the South Asia mission head believes Bengal can contribute significantly in science and technology and medium and small enterprises to boost bilateral ties.

 These are two of the thrust areas identified by German chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the joint statement issued last Sunday on the latter?s visit to Germany.

 While the Indo-German Science Circle has given ?new impetus? to science and tech ties, both sides believe the newly-established office of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in New Delhi ?will further add to the close network of institutions between the two countries?.

 Borchardt feels students from both IIT Kharagpur and IIM Calcutta could add value to the proposed Indo-German Science Center to be set up in the capital. He also expects critical inputs from Bengal to enrich research cooperation in biomedical sciences, for which the Indian Council for Medical Research and the Helmholtz Association of German research centres are signing an MoU.

 The German programme ?Youth does research?, which picks up fresh ideas from talented students and puts them to use, will also be replicated in the city with Siemens. Erasmus Mundus, the student-exchange programme, which originated in the European Union, is coming to India too, said the South Asia mission head.

 ?I?m glad we could save the Calcutta consulate office from the sweep of downsizing, and I feel somewhat proud to be partly instrumental in ensuring that during my visit here in October 2003. There are enough positive signs to justify a full-fledged mission here that can continue to act as a catalyst to boost ties with Germany,? says Borchardt.

 Fatal slip for child

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two-and-a-half-year-old Bibek Das was playing with his friends on Olaichandi Road, in Tallah, when he slipped into an open drain and was swept away under a covered portion about 10 ft away.

 By the time local residents, alerted by father Manoj, could get to the kid, he was unconscious. Minutes later, he was pronounced dead at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 Police said the road is flanked by partially open drains. Bibek was playing with two of his friends in the afternoon when he tripped and fell into one of them.

 Following the morning downpour, the drains were full. And thanks to the recent dredging, water was flowing faster than usual. The child was swept away as soon as he fell and got stuck under the concrete cover, said an officer of Tallah police station.

 While some neighbours blamed the civic body for the missing drain covers, Bibeks grandfather Debnath Das held a section of the local residents responsible for the mishap.

 Its true that some slabs were broken, but they still covered the drains partially. Some residents decided to remove them, so their children could relieve themselves in the drains, instead of walking down to the public toilet some distance away, alleged Debnath.

 The tragedy plunged into gloom the neighbourhood preparing for the wedding reception of a local boy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Treatment hub for pets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Last year, the Ghosals of Vivekananda Road were shaken after Dodo, their pet Labrador, died of a cardiac arrest. They knocked on several doors to save her, but Calcutta did not have a facility that could have revived Dodo?s failing heart.

 The city?s dismal animal-care scene will soon undergo a sea change. An ultrasonography, a pregnancy test or an ICU life-support system for a sick pet, hitherto unimaginable, is set to become a reality.

 A state-of-the-art animal hospital, Ananda Laboratory, is being set up in Mukundapur, off EM Bypass, on a 4.4-acre plot now housing the animal shelter Ashari.

 ?Many animals, including pets, die because of a lack of treatment facilities,? said Debasish Chakraborty, managing trustee of People for Animals. 

 ?Like humans, animals, too, suffer from critical ailments and meet with accidents. Our hospital is for them and will have all facilities that are now reserved for humans,? Chakraborty said. It will also cater to stray animals for free. 

 Animal experts and vets from abroad will regularly visit the hospital to upgrade the knowledge base of the staff. 

 Most of the equipment has been installed and the inauguration is scheduled for next month, though the hospital will not be fully operational for a few more months.

 With both indoor and outdoor sections, the hospital will have facilities for pathological and other tests, X-ray, pre-operative barium test and pregnancy test for all animals, including cows, camels and horses.

 ?All animals, pet or stray, will be given utmost attention. The vets will be able to monitor their patients? condition through computers. Test results will be supplied promptly to minimise delay in treatment,? said another official of Ashari. 

 The hospital will also have an intensive care unit and a well-equipped operating theatre, complete anaesthesia facilities and online blood-pressure monitoring equipment.

 Another important feature will be a ?constant endeavour? to develop the knowledge base. 

 Experts and vets from countries, including Canada and the US, will come here to exchange ideas and techniques with the staff of Ananda Laboratory. ?Scientific explanations of ailments and identification of disease trends are also our motive. A team from Canada is scheduled to visit the hospital in February,? the official added.

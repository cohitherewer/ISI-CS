 Tress trend

 What: Launch of monsoon colours and cuts.

 Where: Zahids Hair amp; Beauty Salon at 52A Shakespeare Sarani.

 When: Friday.

 Take a look: The looks were demonstrated by hair expert Zahid Khan. Shades of purple, mahagony copper, red and blonde from the LOreal stable have been mixed and matched to give a long-lasting effect. The three cuts showcased were messy, fluffy and neat. For dry and frizzy hair, Zahid suggested the messy look. The hair length is till the shoulders and the trick is to take out hair weight first, explained Zahid.

 The neat look is suitable for thin hair. During monsoon, thin hair looks dreadfully limp and flat, said Zahid. Texturising gives volume to the hair. For the fluffy look, shoulder-length hair will only require fingers to scrunch for the complete effect. 

 Voiceover: Just like we co-ordinate our clothes every season, haircuts should be season-oriented, too. The monsoon cuts are easy to maintain and require no blow dry or setting, said Zahid.

 Rain raga

 What: The Rainmongers.

 Where: Crossword bookstore on Elgin Road.

 When: Tuesday evening.

 Tune in: Conceived and directed by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee and compered by Rita Bhimani, the evening was a celebration of monsoon. The event started off with Miya ki Malhar and Desh on sitar by Pandit Abhik Mukhopadhyay, followed by Nipobithi Ghoshs rendition of Raining in the heart. Shalini Gupta enthralled the audience with Elo je borsha, an immortal monsoon melody.

 Actor Barun Chanda, actress Suchita Raychaudhuri and Sujoy offered their tribute to the season through poetry. Bijoylakshmi Burman presented the images of solitude of rainmongers. The readings were interspersed with renditions of Rabindrasangeet, Atulprasad and Hindustani classical recital by Dr Sudeshna Basu. 

 Voiceover: This is Crosswords homage to the rich repertoire of monsoon literature and music, said Sidharth Pansari, managing director of Crossword.

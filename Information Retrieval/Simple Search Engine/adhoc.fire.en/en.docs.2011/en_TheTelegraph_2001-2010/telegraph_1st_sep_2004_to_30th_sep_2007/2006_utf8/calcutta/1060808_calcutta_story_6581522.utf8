 Infosys chairman and chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy 

 lashed out at government education policies at the third 

 Keshav Chandra Basu Memorial Endowment Lecture held at National 

 University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) on August 3.

 Calling government policies stifling, he said 

 that excessive controls exercised by authorities 

 have impeded the progress of education in India, especially 

 higher education.

 In the lecture on A framework for reforms in higher 

 education in India, organised by NUJS, Murthy said: 

 India has the third largest higher education system 

 in the world, after China and the US and despite being one 

 of the largest producers of degrees, the country has hardly 

 produced any worthwhile inventions.

 Slamming Bengal over its student dropout rate, the Infosys 

 chairman pointed that the state was one of the worst culprits 

 when it came to primary and secondary education. It 

 has been estimated that only 17 per cent of the student 

 community in the state go on to complete the 10th standard. 

 I am an engineer and I base my statistics on facts and surveys, 

 he said.

 Holding the government accountable for the sorry standard 

 of higher education in the country, Murthy felt that the 

 situation needed a massive shot in the arm to benchmark 

 it with the best in the world. According to him, autonomy 

 is the answer.

 We must provide autonomy to our educational institutions 

 if we want to improve their quality. Autonomy is about the 

 freedom to decide on selection criteria, size of student 

 intake as well as faculty intake, syllabus, fees, compensation 

 for faculty, scholarships for students and adapting to a 

 changing environment, pointed out Murthy.

 The Infosys chairman felt that government apathy towards 

 higher education in the country has led to a massive brain 

 drain in the country. Red tape and bureaucratic hassles 

 had also done substantial damage to any efforts for improvement.

 India spends only 1.9 per cent of its GDP on higher 

 education, the lowest among nations with GDP more than $500 

 billion. The recommendations of the Kothari Commission report, 

 suggesting that we raise spending on education to six per 

 cent, has not been acted on even after 38 years. The message 

 is clear, excellence in higher education does not matter 

 to the country's leaders, Murthy said.

 Asking a number of pertinent questions with regard to the 

 state of higher education in India, the Infosys head bemoaned 

 the lack of quality education infrastructure in India. He 

 said that while the country had seen setting up of five 

 IITs during Nehrus time, only one more had come up 

 in the last 40 years.

 The enthusiasm for creating world class institutions 

 of higher learning has almost evaporated. We see the same 

 story in medicine, economics and agriculture. India has 

 only two universities ranked amongst the top 500 in the 

 world, while Japan has 34 and China has seven. Indias 

 pool of university-educated talent constitutes a mere nine 

 per cent of its population, compared to China with 15 per 

 cent and Philippines with 28 per cent. One can forget comparing 

 the country with the developed nations! stressed Murthy.

 Urban living

 Satyajit Chakrabarti, director, 

 Institute of Engineering and Management, attended the United 

 Nations third World Conference on World Urban Forum III 

 in Vancouver between June 19 and 23. The theme of the conference 

 was the rehabilitation of the increasing urban population 

 in countries.

 It is predicted that by the end 

 of 2007 more than 50 per cent of the world population will 

 live in urban areas. That will create pressure on the existing 

 education system, housing, sewerage and water supply. Slum 

 dwellings will push up the crime rate, speakers at the conference 

 said.

 Chakrabarti pointed out in his 

 speech that big, self-sufficient housing estates were a 

 new phenomenon in developing countries. The difference between 

 the lifestyles inside and outside these mini towns was 

 mind-boggling, he said, adding that such divisions within 

 the cityscape would lead to political division. He called 

 for the trend to be arrested by urban planners and civic 

 bodies. 

 The fourth session of United Nations 

 Urban Forum will be held in Nanjing, China, in 2008.

 Theme study

 The Future Foundation School and 

 Arun Nursery School put up an exhibition of theme-based 

 charts and installations made by their students on July 

 18 and 19. The two schools use the method of theme teaching, 

 whereby the children learn through an integrated curriculum 

 working on various projects based on themes throughout the 

 year.

 In the display, the themes for 

 the kindergarten and nursery kids were My Classroom, My 

 Family, Colours, Hot Days and My Body. Class I put up a 

 display on Our Garden and Class II on the colour Green.

 Exhibits by students of the other classes of The Future 

 Foundation revolved around communication the origin 

 of languages, the development of writing and printing, letters 

 written by eminent persons, the Indian postal system, use 

 of signals in the defence forces, genetic communication 

 and satellite communication.

 Students later presented skits 

 and plays on the same theme. They portrayed various emotions 

 through extracts from Shakespeares plays. A short 

 skit in Hindi stressed the importance of learning correct 

 grammar and proper pronunciation. A mime gave the message 

 of loving animals. 

 Ode to poet

 A programme was organised by Maheswari 

 Balika Vidya Bhavan on August 1 to pay homage to one of 

 the pillars of medieval Indian literature, Tulsi Das. It 

 was during the reign of Akbar (1556-1605) that this great 

 Hindi poet composed his masterpiece Ramcharitmanas. Lauding 

 Tulsi Dass contribution to Indian literature, students 

 of the school presented a cultural programme of songs, dance 

 and drama based on Ramayana. The students pledged to come 

 up with more such programmes in the future.

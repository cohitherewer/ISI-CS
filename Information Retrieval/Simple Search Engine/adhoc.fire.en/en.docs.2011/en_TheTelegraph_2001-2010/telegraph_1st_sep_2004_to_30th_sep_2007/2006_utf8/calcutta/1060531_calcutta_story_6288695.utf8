 Today?s question: Should all colleges with adequate facilities be granted autonomy?

 Whither autonomy: Infrastructure woes plague too many colleges

 Anirban Rudra,

 Behala

 Autonomous colleges need not be bogged down by ancient norms and can experiment with new teaching techniques. Moreover, these colleges are better equipped to run professional courses. Autonomy to colleges ensures a better future for the students. 

 Gauri Mitra, 

 Salt Lake

 Autonomy to adequately equipped colleges is welcome, but it should not turn to autocracy. Decentralisation of academic administration is desirable.

 A.F. Kamruddin, 

 Chandbati, Hooghly

 Autonomous colleges can grow at a faster rate than those under university control. Unnecessary strictures have proved to be stumbling blocks for many a college.

 Pijush Kanti Sarkar,

 Narendrapur 

 Premier colleges like Presidency and St Xaviers should be granted autonomy. They should be allowed to tie up with foreign universities and open academic avenues for brilliant students who cannot afford education abroad.

 D. Mukherjee, 

 Behala

 The older colleges should be given preference in the matter of autonomy. They should have the freedom to frame the syllabi and conduct examinations. The degree, however, should be awarded by the university for acceptability. The process will reduce the burden on the universities. 

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati

 The majority of colleges affiliated to universities are average in terms of teaching and other academic activities. But there are colleges that are equipped enough to upgrade their standard by a couple of notches if they are allowed to function on their own. These institutions deserve to be granted autonomy. Such an arrangement is prevalent abroad. 

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Shyamnagar

 Colleges with adequate facilities should be granted autonomy. It would be impossible to offer education of an international standard without the colleges being made autonomous . 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road 

 All colleges, even if they have adequate facilities, should not be granted autonomy. Otherwise, problems might crop up. Only colleges with potential for excellence should be considered for the honour. Factors such as teacher-student relationship and educational environment should be considered during the autonomy-grant process. Autonomy should not be a status symbol for colleges.

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala

 Adequate facilities should not be the only criterion for autonomy grant. The quality of teaching and academic record over the years should be equally important considerations. 

 Mahasweta Saha,

 Garia

 Autonomy should be granted to colleges that have adequate facilities. Calcutta University is currently overburdened with the task of overseeing the administration of innumerable colleges. Being an M.Sc student of the university, I can understand we will benefit enormously if the pressure is eased.

B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 Most colleges in Calcutta, except a handful, need repairs, a fresh coat of paint and new doors and windows. Some do not even provide pure drinking water and clean toilets to students. The quality of teaching, too, is abysmal. Granting autonomy to such colleges would be premature. 

 S.N. Mitra,

 Beleghata

 Colleges with adequate facilities should be granted autonomy, but they should remain answerable to the government.

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

 Principals of many colleges fail to maintain discipline on the campus. They need to be granted more power if the colleges are to be autonomous.

 Kanai Saha,

 Gauri Bari Lane

 Only colleges with outstanding record and proper infrastructure can be granted autonomy. The right to select the colleges should rest with the central agencies.

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 Autonomy should not be granted to colleges. Otherwise, the managements will fill up the coffers without paying attention to the needs of the students.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 A phenomenal amount of responsibility is placed on a college by granting it autonomy. Hence, such institutions should be chosen with care.

 Rahul Das,

 Tollygunge

 College students know how frustrating it is to have irrelevant people decide their welfare. Education is not a means of arm-twisting by the state. Autonomy will not only grant the college managements more control but also radically improve the ethics of education among the students and teachers. In a scenario where the state agenda of aggrandisement is crippling the quality of education, autonomy is the way out.

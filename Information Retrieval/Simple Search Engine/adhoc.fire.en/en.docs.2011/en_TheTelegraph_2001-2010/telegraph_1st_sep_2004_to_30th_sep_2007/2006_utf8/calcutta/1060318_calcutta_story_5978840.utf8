The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fume check vow, green lobby sceptical

 OUR BUREAU

 The state government is looking for alternative measures to curb auto pollution, following the Calcutta High Court order striking down the ban on commercial vehicles that are more than 15 years old.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury has asserted that auto emission norms would be strictly enforced and not a single offending vehicle would be allowed to ply. 

 ?More than 50 per cent of the commercial vehicles plying in and around the city violate emission norms. We will not allow any of them to ply. We have already taken measures to ensure that emission tests are carried out properly,? Chowdhury said on Friday.

 An ?action squad? is being set up, comprising representatives of the public vehicles department (PVD), pollution control board (PCB) and the Auto Emission Testers Association, to conduct surprise checks at the testing centres and on vehicles on the road.

 To prevent manipulation ? fake ?pollution under control? stickers on vehicles are not too uncommon a sight ? the centres have been asked to record on compact discs (CDs) how the vehicles are being tested. The CDs are to be sent to the PVD.

 The statements, however, have failed to enthuse environmentalists, who believe that the government is not at all serious about curbing pollution.

 ?The government has been consistently helping the transport lobby, either through inaction or by putting up a weak case fit to be defeated,? said green activist Subhas Dutta.

 ?Implementation of the recommendations of a high court-appointed expert committee; introduction of LPG in the city in a proper way, despite being the first to submit an action plan based on alternative fuel; ensuring proper functioning of the emission testing centres? the government has failed on all fronts,? observed Dutta.

 Automobile expert S.M. Ghosh berated the government for issuing the ban notification, ?though it had been established in the high court a number of times that there was no legal provision to do so?. Two years ago, the high court had set aside a ban on vehicles more than 30 years old.

 ?If the government is serious about curbing pollution, why has it not enforced the ban on old taxis, under West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rule 120? Why is it not forcing autorickshaws to switch to LPG? Only 18 per cent of the vehicles go for the mandatory pollution checks, why is no action being taken against the rest?? asked Ghosh.

 Officials of the PCB point out that the government had failed to highlight the pollution angle in its move to phase out old vehicles. They cite a case in which the board had won ?on the strength of the argument? that the government had offered for banning old vehicles.

 The board had ordered certain industrial units to shift from coal to oil (for fuel) to reduce pollution. The units went to court, which ruled in favour of the board.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week without

 Catching the season-end sale

 In case youre looking for 

 an excuse to shop, look no further. A readymade excuse has 

 just popped up right in front of your eyes. Westside, Benetton, 

 Spykar Jeans, Little Shop, Gini amp; Jony, Lilliput and 

 a plethora of shops are offering dream discounts. Give em 

 a breezy browse and you might land yourself all the things 

 that you were wanting to buy, but never thought it worth 

 the spend. Bottomline: great value, greater satisfaction? 

 (Who cares if you end up shopping beyond your budget, at 

 least youve got more for more!) 

 Buying KANK music

 Ok, you are all mushy about the 

 title track and cant go to work without listening 

 to Mitwa. But theres much, much more to the 

 Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna soundtrack than the first 

 two songs. Shankar Ehsaan and Loy have woven their musical 

 magic yet again and theres no better evidence than 

 Tumhi dekho na, the song born out of the piano prelude 

 to the title track. Wheres the party tonight 

 and Rock roll soniye have enough 

 groove and grind to keep the legs moving till the KJo creation 

 finally arrives in August.

 Fort puts its foot down

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fort William on Wednesday said no to Book Fair 2007 on the Maidan, pushing the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government into a corner.

 At a meeting with chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and senior state government officers on Wednesday evening, GOC (Bengal area) Major-General Deepak Raj made it clear that the army would not issue a clearance certificate to the fair this time.

 The chief secretary was trying to sound out the army on using the Maidan for the book fair, one more time.

 We have told the government that the high court does not want any fairs to be held on the Maidan and we will not issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) this time. Our stand is clear, said the major-general after the meeting at Writers Buildings.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and officers from the public works department (PWD) and the information and cultural affairs department, as well as Publishers and Booksellers Guild officials, were present to plead the fairs case.

 The army had issued an NOC for Book Fair 2006 following a prod from Delhi, but insisted that the high courts leave be sought in the matter. 

 The state government had then given an undertaking before the court that this was the last time the book fair was being held on the Maidan.

 While granting permission, the high court had specified that this was a one-off case and that the judgment would not have any effect on the fair being relocated in 2007. 

 Now, the governments move to keep the fair on the Maidan, as the alternative site off the Bypass is not ready yet, has been shot down by the army.

 When the army has made its stand clear, what more can we say? Were exploring other alternatives. Were also talking to the ministry of defence in Delhi, said home secretary Roy, after the inconclusive meeting on Wednesday.

 Last time, then defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had given the green signal to the fair on the Maidan.

 Space could be the major constraint in the relocation of book fair. 

 There is no other place so large. The upcoming fair grounds off the Bypass are very small, conceded Roy, adding that the government was still mulling the option of seeking special clearance from the high court 

 Guild officials said they were depending on the state government to make this years book fair happen.

 The fair is an international event Calcutta is known for. Since the Milan Mela grounds off the Bypass are barely one-sixth the Maidans size, we have alternative site. We will go by the governments advice on the matter. If it moves court seeking a clearance, we too will move court, said Guild secretary Tridib Chatterjee.

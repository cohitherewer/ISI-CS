 Action against errant postman

 Sayani Ganguly: The postmen of Kodalia-Subhasgram post office in Sonarpur, South 24-Parganas, do not deliver letters. The residents of the area have to collect their letters from the post office. Why?

 Thank you for the information. This is the first time I am getting the complaint. I will look into the matter and I can assure you that if any postman is found guilty of not delivering letters, he will be taken to task. I request you to bring such incidents to our notice by contacting the customer grievance cell at Yogayog Bhavan. You may also register a complaint through our website www.indiapost.org.

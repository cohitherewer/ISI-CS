 On the road: Channel [V]s 

 Freedom Express team

 To coincide with Indias 59th Independence Day, Channel [V] presents the all-new season of Freedom Express. From the tip to the toe of the country, VJs Archana, Juhi and Aditya travelled the country and lending their support to this special initiative are Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi as Munnabhai and Circuit.

 Flagging of Freedom Express, Amar K. Deb, Channel [V]s head honcho, said: The show has been created with the sole purpose of opening your eyes to the beauty, the variety and the wonderful people that exist across this remarkable country. It doesnt attempt to preach but provides a visual experience. 

 Says Sanjay Dutt: Freedom is one of the most important things in the world and we all take it for granted. We need to value it and cherish it. Lage raho mamu log! 

 Adds Arshad Warsi, in his typical Circuit twang: Freedom Express ekdum mast concept hai. Apun full force mein support karta hai.

 On the show, making her way up north was VJ Juhi. Touring the serene Hindu temples on the banks of the Ganga at Haridwar or the picturesque locales of Woodstock in Mussoorie, she got to witness the famous Dhanaulti Rock Music Festival. 

 VJ Archana headed east from west. Starting off from Pune and finishing in Calcutta, she interacted with foreigners who have settled and made India their home.

 Leading the charge down south was VJ Aditya, who commenced his journey from Kapad Beach and visited places like Kunnoor, Bylekuppe and Pondicherry. 

 This pan-Indian extravaganza will culminate in three half-hour episodes on Tuesday at 1 pm, 5 pm and 9 pm.

 Fresh face: Divyanka Tripathi as Vidya

 In a fresh onslaught of a series of new soaps on the small screen, Zee TVs latest prime-time TRP bid is Banoo Main Teri Dulhann. A story of an illiterate village girl named Vidya, the new soap revolves around her fairy-tale marriage and how she faces the wrath of her in-laws including her husband. What follows is the story of Vidyas struggle, grit and determination to win her husband over.

 Starting Monday, Banoo Main Teri Dulhann features relative newcomers Divyanka Tripathi as Vidya and Sharad Malhotra as screen husband Sagar. 

 Speaking at the launch, Punit Goenka, business head of Zee TV, said: With Saat Phere, we addressed the issue of the discrimination a girl faces in many parts in India on grounds of her skin colour. The new serial will touch upon and deal with the struggles an illiterate village girl has to undergo. 

 Banoo Main Teri Dulhann will air every week, Monday to Thursday, at 8 pm on Zee TV.

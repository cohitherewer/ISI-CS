 The three-day 14th ITC Sangeet Sammelan to kick off on the lawns of the ITC Sangeet Research Academy on December 8 will showcase a bouquet of the old and the new in Indian classical music.

 Amit Mukherjee, executive director of the Academy, said the Sammelan has carved out an identity of its own through continued emphasis on quality, which had drawn as many as 2,500 listeners to the last edition of the meet.

 We, however, do not get the same numbers every year, admitted Mukherjee. I think it is because a lot of people have a warped idea about classical music they say they dont understand it. But one can enjoy music without being a connoisseur, by simply putting ones mind into it. You cant do something else while listening to classical music and hope to understand it.

 Poet Joy Goswami said there are many music-lovers in Calcutta who, like him, come to the Academy throughout the year. There are meets every Wednesday, where veterans perform. I remember listening to Ustad Vilayat Khan during his last public performance at the Academy. He was ailing and took time arriving, so Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar kept the audience engaged by extending his vocal recital. It is this informal sharing of pleasure that make these events precious.

 The Academy is in talks with Worldspace radio to undertake programmes for the spread of music. We share the common interest of taking art and music to the semi-urban and rural people who do not get the opportunity to attend such conferences, said Mukherjee. 

 Among the young musicians and vocalists who will take part in the Sammelan are flautist Rupak Kulkarni, Sadhana Deshmukh Mohite and Alam A. Khan, Harsh Narayan and Sameehan Ulhas Kashalkar. 

 The ITC Award will be presented to senior Hindustani vocalist of Agra gharana Pandit Dinkar Kaikini.

 There is a also line-up of veteran musicians, like Pandit Ram Narayan (sarangi), Swapan Chaudhuri (tabla), Girija Devi (vocalist) and Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty (vocalist).

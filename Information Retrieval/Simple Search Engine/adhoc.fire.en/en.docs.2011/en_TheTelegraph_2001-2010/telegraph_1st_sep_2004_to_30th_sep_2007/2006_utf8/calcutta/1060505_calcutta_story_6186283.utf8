 ?Tora ja ichhey kor, eikhane toder thakte debo na (You do whatever you can, but we will not allow you to stay here).?

 These were the war words Swapan Saha, CPM councillor of Dum Dum, spat out at Saraswati Sinha, by the remains of her Kalidham home on Thursday morning.

 She had come to inspect her residence ravaged by Saha and his aides on Friday, when they had also assaulted her daughter Runu and son Somnath.

 Saha had just been granted bail and was back at the battlefield ? the home of the Sinhas, a portion of which the councillor and his partymen wanted for a club ? to ward off ?enemy? Saraswati, who has been forced to flee Kalidham with her children.

 Saha, councillor of ward no. 14 of Dum Dum municipality, and five of his accomplices had been arrested late on Tuesday for their assault on the family.

 This was triggered by the intervention of the CPM brass after the Sinhas had turned up at the Alimuddin Street headquarters, seeking redress.

 But Thursday morning found all six accused of ?rowdyism and damaging other?s property? walking free and returning to the disputed site at Kalidham.

 ?Saha threatened me around 8.30 am, while I was inspecting the damage done to my house and overseeing the construction of a bamboo fence. He came to me and warned me with dire consequences for taking the matter to the party leaders,? said Saraswati.

 The day that began with such threats ended on a note of assurance for the Sinhas. 

 They called on CPM state secretariat member Binay Konar at Alimuddin Street on Thursday afternoon, and later in the evening, Amitava Bose, CPM secretary of North 24-Parganas district committee, met the family at his Barasat office.

 ?I assured them that they won?t face any further harassment,? Bose later said.

 During the day, the family living in fear also met state human rights commission chairperson Shyamal Sen.

 ?He listened to our ordeal and advised me to undergo treatment in a government hospital, as blood is still oozing from my wounds caused by last Friday?s attack, and we can?t even go back home,? said Runu.

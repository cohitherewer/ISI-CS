The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State to appeal for vehicle phase-out

 TAPAS GHOSH

 The state government will appeal against a Calcutta High Court order that struck down a government notification banning commercial vehicles more than 15 years old in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.

 According to Debabrata Roy, a lawyer on the government panel, the appeal petition against the single-bench order will be moved before a division bench this week.

 Acting on a petition filed by the Bengal Bus Syndicate and others, Justice J. Biswas had on March 18 set aside the state transport department?s notification announcing that permits of commercial vehicles more than 15 years old would not be renewed and that the vehicles would be phased out.

 ?The government had initially decided to wait till the Assembly polls before filing an appeal. But the urgency of the matter has finally prompted it to act right away,? Roy added.

 To drive home the urgency, the lawyers? panel had cited the recent reports of the Central Pollution Control Board, which rank Calcutta first among all metros in air pollution.

 ?The state green board has requested the state transport department to chalk out a scheme to phase out old vehicles that belch out more than 60 per cent of the poison in the city?s ambient air,? counsel Roy said. ?The department is exerting pressure on the government to enact a law, if necessary, to stop old vehicles from plying in the city.?

 In 2004, a green bench of the high court had ruled that old vehicles conforming to the national Auto Fuel Policy and tailpipe emission norms could not be prevented from plying.

 ?But the fact is, air pollution cannot be checked until the old vehicles are phased out,? argued environment activist Subhas Dutta.

 Air pollution in 10 major cities ? including Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore ? is monitored directly by the Supreme Court. Calcutta does not figure on the list, as an auto emission case had been pending with the green bench when it was drawn up.

 ?If the state government does not take any step to curb air pollution, I will move an appeal before the apex court, seeking inclusion of Calcutta on the list,? Dutta threatened.

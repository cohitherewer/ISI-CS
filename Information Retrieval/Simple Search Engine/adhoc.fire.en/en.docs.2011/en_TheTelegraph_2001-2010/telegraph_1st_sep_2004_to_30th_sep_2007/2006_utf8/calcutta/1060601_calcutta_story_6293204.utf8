 Research boost for trade

 - CU asked to suggest steps for more export to Russia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tea to tobacco, textiles to garments, meat to fruits, machinery parts to two-wheelers? Calcutta University will soon launch a research project to find out ways to enhance export of these items to Russia through better business ties. 

 In the backdrop of the Centre?s decision to sign a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with Russia, the Union commerce and industry ministry has selected the history department of Calcutta University to carry out research on the implications of the proposed pact.

 The government has already released a grant of Rs 5 lakh for the study, which will have to be completed within three months. University officials said the study is likely to be over by July.

 ?A wide range of areas has been included under the terms of reference. The main focus of the research is to find out how the agreement can meet the national requirements,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of the university. He is also a senior professor of the history department.

 According to Das, the assignment is prestigious as no other university in the country has been selected to provide inputs to the ministry for examining the feasibility of the proposed pact.

 The state-run Institute of Development Studies, Calcutta, will also be involved in the study.

 ?We have been asked by the ministry to examine why export of traditional commodities like tea, coffee, tobacco and readymade garments to Russia has declined. We would also have to suggest steps that would boost economic ties between the two countries,? Das explained.

 The study will also explore the possibilities of expanding the scope of bilateral trade through tourism, and medical and educational exchanges.

 The ministry also wants to find out whether Russian companies are interested in investing in India. Sources point out that the sectors that could draw investment from that country include biotechnology, computer software, energy, railway and diamond processing.

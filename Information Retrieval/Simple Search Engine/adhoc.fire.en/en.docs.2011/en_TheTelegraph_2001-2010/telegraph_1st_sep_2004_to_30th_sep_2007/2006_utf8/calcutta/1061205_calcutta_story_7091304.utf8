 B-school executive induction

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta formally inducted the first batch of postgraduate programme for executives (PGPEX) students at a function on the Joka campus on Sunday. 

 Y.C. Deveshwar, chairman of the board of governors, IIM Calcutta and chairman, ITC, along with M.G. Parameswaran, executive director, FCB Ulka, were present at the induction programme. 

 This course is designed for executives with the potential to reach top management positions, said an IIM Calcutta spokesperson. 

 Though the batch strength is 39 in the first year, the authorities plan to raise the seat count for the one-year course that has replaced the earlier three-year evening programme from the IIM Calcutta stable for working professionals. 

 According to the authorities, one of the key strengths of PGPEX is the range of student background, from automobile to software industry and Indian public sector companies to multinational firms. 

 So, Syed Enayet Kabir, with over 8.5 years of experience in the Indian Army, will share classroom space with Ashok Ashta, a Williams College, Massachusetts graduate, with over nine years of experience as an assistant manager in the international marketing division of Toyota Motor Corporation.

 Spread over seven terms, the PGPEX program will have course modules such as managing global logistics, cross-border management and enterprise, team-building and communication effectiveness, explained the IIM Calcutta spokesperson. 

 Besides placement assistance, the students will also get the chance to work as interns in international organisations. Working professionals with a graduation degree from a recognised university and five years of work experience can apply for the course.

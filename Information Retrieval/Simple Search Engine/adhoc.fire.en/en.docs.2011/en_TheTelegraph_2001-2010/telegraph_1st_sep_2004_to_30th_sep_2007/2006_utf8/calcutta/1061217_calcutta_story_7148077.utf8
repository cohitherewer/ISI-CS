 What: 

 Launch of a hookah and cigar bar.

 Where: Ginger, 104 SP Mukherjee Road (near Hazra crossing).

 When: Friday afternoon.

 Waiting to exhale: The 

 cosy bar-cum-lounge parlour on the ground floor of the vegetarian 

 restaurant unveiled a hookah bar-and-cigar section. The 

 new wing was launched by actress Koneenica Banerjee (picture

 On offer is a splash of innovative hookah flavours like Mintos, Lime Lemon, Coffee and Bombay Pan Masala. But if hookahs arent your style, then go with a cigar. Choose from Cohiba, Montecristo, Partagas and Romeo Y Julieta. 

 The restaurant also launched an Eat To Get Lucky Contest, on till Poila Baisakh. 

 Pocket pinch: Hookahs come for Rs 150 (half an hour), cigars are tagged between Rs 35 and Rs 200.

 Voiceover: Hookahs are the latest craze among lounge-goers. We wanted to introduce new flavours of the hookah and also cigars, said Sagar Ganeriwala of Ginger.

 Timber trader untraced

 Raj Kumar Seksaria: Missing since Monday

 A 45-year-old timber merchant is missing since Monday, after collecting dues from customers. Raj Kumar Seksaria left his DL Block home, in the Bidhannagar East police station area, around 2.30 in the afternoon to visit a customer in Topsia. He has not been seen since. 

 ?Around 2 pm, my husband called up the customer and asked him to keep Rs 30,000, that the customer owed him, ready. Then he took a shower, had lunch and left. He told me that he would go to Ultadanga from Topsia,? recalled the businessman?s wife Ritu.

 Raj sold raw timber and had lived in his rented home in Salt Lake with his wife and two daughters for the past three years. The elder daughter is in her 20s, while her sibling is 14 years old. 

 The family members stayed up for Raj past their 10 pm bedtime, but did not fret because he would often return late. When he did not turn up even after 11 pm, they started calling up relatives and friends. After looking for Raj through the night, the family lodged a missing diary with the police early on Tuesday.

 ?His customers owed Raj a lot of money. On Monday, he had collected a large amount. He did meet one of his customers in Topsia. What happened after that is subject to investigation. We have started a missing case,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 ?We have neither received a ransom demand nor has Raj called to inform us about his whereabouts,? said Mohanlal, the merchant?s elder brother.

 Next-door neighbour Ajanta Mitra said: ?Raj kept to himself. We never heard the couple quarrel. It?s shocking to learn he is missing.?

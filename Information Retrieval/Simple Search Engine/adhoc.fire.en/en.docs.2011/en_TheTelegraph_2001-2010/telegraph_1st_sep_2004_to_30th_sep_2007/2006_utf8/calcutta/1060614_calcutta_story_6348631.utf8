The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam-off dispute drags on

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A hearing in the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Tuesday failed to bring back the Zee-Turner channels to a section of city cable homes.

 Zee-Turner, which distributes channels like Zee TV, Zee Bangla, Zee Sports, Cartoon Network, Pogo and HBO, switched off its signal to multi-system operator CableComm on Saturday night.

 ?There are dues of Rs 3.75 crore. CableComm has not paid us for the second bouquet of channels despite signing an agreement,? said Arun Poddar, CEO of Zee Turner.

 CableComm services nearly 25 per cent of the cable homes in the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority area.

 ?We do not have any dues with Zee. Besides, in case of a monetary dispute, a broadcaster must provide a 30-day notice, which Zee Turner did not,? D.S. Mehta, chairman of CableComm argued.

 According to CableComm, Zee Turner was forcibly trying to enforce payment for its second package, for which its operators were not ready.

 CableComm had moved TDSAT for a stay on the disconnection on Tuesday. The tribunal scheduled the next date of hearing for July 13.

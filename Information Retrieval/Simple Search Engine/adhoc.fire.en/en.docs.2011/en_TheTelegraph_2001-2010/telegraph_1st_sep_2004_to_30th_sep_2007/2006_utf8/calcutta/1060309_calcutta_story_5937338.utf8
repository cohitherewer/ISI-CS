 Mastering snip science

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Haircutting is a science, where systematic education is a priority. An education that builds up an artiste fluent in logical theories and equipped with all the modes to express them, believes this flamboyant yet down-to-earth tress stylist who holds the record for 410 haircuts on the trot.

 Trendsetter Jawed Habib (in picture by Rashbehari Das) was in town on Tuesday to award certificates to a school of 25 students graduating from the Habibs Hair Academy and Salon at 55/1, Rashbehari Avenue.

 Academies from the house of Habibs dot Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore. The Calcutta centre, the first of its kind in the East, opened its doors last July to overwhelming response. We have students from Calcutta, the Northeast and even Bangladesh, says a spokesperson for the salon.

 The academy offers a one-and-a-half-month course recommended for those already in the profession, a three-month course for freshers and a six-months course that imparts education not only on hair styling but also on aspects of cosmetology.

 Three faculty members hold sessions like scissors practise, hair shampoo and conditioning, colouring, cutting and salon management. Students are also put through practical sessions and participation in the salon operations. Exams on a regular basis help keep track of a students development.

 I am glad that hair styling is a growing profession and is not looked down upon anymore. I consider it a duty to work towards its improvement, smiles Habib, who is now planning an academy in Chennai.

 And if Habib passes through town when summers just setting in, can he possibly get away without passing on some tress tips? The style should be more the wash-and-go kind. Sporting shoulder length is manageable yet chic? Soft curls are back with a bang? Hair colour is no longer restricted to covering those greys, it adds a whole new dimension to your personality. For summers, when the scorching sun is an area of concern, subtle dark shades should do the trick, he prescribes.

 Dark khaki and copper blondes are the colours to watch out for. As for a maintenance regime, cleaning the hair regularly with a mild shampoo, using a conditioner, drinking lots of water and application of methi paste once a fortnight can do wonders, recommends the ace stylist who has a bilingual book, Haircare for All Seasons to his credit.

 Though I do not recommend mousse and gel, on a bad hair day you can use them. But make sure you do not apply it on the scalp. An application of conditioner, serum or gel on the scalp leads to dandruff, a root cause for hair fall, cautions Habib.

 And finally: Sport a good cut, and think good.

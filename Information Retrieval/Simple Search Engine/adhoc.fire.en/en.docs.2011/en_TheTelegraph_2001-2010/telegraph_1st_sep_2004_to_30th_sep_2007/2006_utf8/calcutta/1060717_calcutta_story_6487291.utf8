 Prankrishna Halder and his wife Nandita were arrested in Baruipur, 

 on the city?s southern fringes, on Sunday for allegedly duping 

 nearly 500 youths by promising them jobs. The couple started 

 a company three months ago and reportedly collected Rs 50,000 

 to Rs 1 lakh from the youths for getting them jobs. A youth 

 lodged a complaint with Baruipur police station on Friday, 

 saying that although he had paid Rs 50,000 to the couple in 

 instalments, he had not been provided with a job. Police raided

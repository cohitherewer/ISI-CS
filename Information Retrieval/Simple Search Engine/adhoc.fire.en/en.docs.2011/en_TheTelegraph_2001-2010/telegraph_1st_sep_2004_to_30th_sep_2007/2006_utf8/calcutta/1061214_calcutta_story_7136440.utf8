 Catch Bipasha Basu in No Entry on TV Stir up grilled chicken with vegetable bake

 Just in case you cant defy the 

 bandh and stay home, Metro tells you how 

 to make the most of an idle Thursday.

 Cook it up: Keep 

 things simple but cook up a storm one big non-vegetarian 

 and one big vegetarian dish. Rakhi Purnima Dasgupta of Kewpies 

 suggests Grilled Chicken chop the chicken into four pieces 

 and pierce them with a fork; marinate the pieces in soya 

 sauce, garlic paste, tomato sauce, oil, salt and pepper; 

 cover and microwave for eight minutes; put some butter on 

 a pan and saute sliced mushrooms; add the chicken stock, 

 leftover marinated juice and a thickening agent; pour sauce 

 on chicken; serve with bread... and Vegetable Bake. For 

 Vegetable Bake half-boil vegetables; make a white sauce 

 with butter, flour, onions and milk; put a layer of vegetables 

 and boiled spinach in a container; pour some white sauce 

 and repeat process; bake for 15-20 minutes and serve.

 To end on a sweet note, Lovey Burman of Kookie Jar recommends a mix of fruit salad topped with orange sauce/jam, lemon juice and sugar syrup cooked into a sauce and placed on a sponge cake (or biscuits will do).

 Be a couch potato: 

 Tune in for a heady mix of Holly and Bolly The Lord 

 of the Rings: The Return of the King (HBO, 9 pm) vs 

 Amitabh Bachchan in Deewaar (SET Max at 9 pm) or 

 the risque laugh riot No Entry (Filmy, 8 pm). Before 

 all that, its Day One of the Ashes third Test.

 Beauty of a bandh: 

 This is a day to pamper yourself and preen. So devote a 

 few languid hours to wellness of body and soul. Go for 

 a turban therapy if your hair is dry. Exfoliate your skin 

 with oatmeal followed by a relaxing fruit mask, says beauty 

 consultant Bridgette Jones.

 In the fitness of things: 

 No junk food and cold drinks; no more than two cups of 

 tea/coffee. Go for a family workout session with free-hand 

 exercises, says fitness consultant Preetom Mukherjee-Roy.

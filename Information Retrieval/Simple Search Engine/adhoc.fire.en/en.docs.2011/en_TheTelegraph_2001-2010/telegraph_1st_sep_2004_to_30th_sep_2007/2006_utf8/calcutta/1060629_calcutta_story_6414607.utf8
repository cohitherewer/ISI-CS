Kate takes the right lane

Screen On amp; Off

 A band bond: Jisshu Sengupta 

 and Swastika Mukherjee come together in a Tollywood 

 potboiler Rudra revolving around the politics of a Bangla 

 band. This is the first time we will be acting 

 together on the big screen, said an excited Swastika 

 about the Manas Basu directorial debut. Picture by Aranya

 She?s known for the incredible screen breaks she gets. A debut at 14 opposite Robert Redford in The Horse Whisperer, then films opposite Denzel Washington (Remember the Titans) and Kevin Spacey (Beyond the Sea) even before she was 20. And now, at 23, Kate Bosworth is getting to play every woman?s dream role ? Lois Lane, better known as Superman?s arm girl.

 Bryan Singer?s Superman Returns, releasing worldwide this Friday, has Kate in the role of Lane, who has won a Pultizer for the article ?Why The World Doesn?t Need Superman?, as a continuation of the Superman II story in the 1980 film (when Kate wasn?t even born). 

 Lane is also happily settled with a five-year-old son when the man in blue tights breezes back into her life. She is, of course, kidnapped by Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) and in an important juncture even manages to save Superman?s life. 

 In real life, it won?t be too long before Kate ties the knot. She is dating Lord of the Rings star Orlando Bloom and despite the many rumours about his infidelities, the two are still very much together and may soon get hitched.

 From reel to real, there?s a Superman Returns link: Kate plans to settle down in Australia, having had a gala time while shooting there.

 Dream role: Kate Bosworth

 He?s had a dream run on the charts and he is widely regarded as the most versatile lyricist in Bollywood. Vipul Shah?s Namaste, London, starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif, will feature Himesh Reshammiya and Javed Akhtar together for the first time.

 ?Himesh and I have wanted to work with each other for a long time,? says Akhtar. ?We come from such varied backgrounds and music sensibilities that there are many opportunities to create new sounds and music. Himesh told me to write without bothering about the sales of the music. He gave me enough space to create what I wanted.?

 For Himesh, it was an honour setting Javedsaab?s words to music. ?He has got great calibre which he has proven over so many years,? says the man whose nasal renditions are the mainstay of music channels these days. ?I am grateful to him for giving me such good lyrics and I am sure people would love the effort we both have made together.?

 A package of eight Bengali telefilms has travelled to Biswa Banga Sammelan (the North American Bengali Conference) beginning in Houston, USA, from July 1.

 The films have been shortlisted from a bunch of 30 submitted by several channels. Incidentally, all eight telefilms are Tara Muzik productions.

 The list features two of Atanu Ghosh?s works. Asamapto, starring Soumitra Chatterjee, Indrani Halder and Kaushik Sen, is on the relationship between an Alzheimer?s patient (Soumitra) and a call girl (Indrani). Ghosh?s second work, Manthan, features Sabyasachi Chakra-borty and Mallika Majumdar.

 Actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay?s directorial debut on the small screen Premer Golpo, with Rajatabha Dutta, Sudipa Basu and Kanchan Mullick, has secured a place alongside Jayashree Bhattacharya?s Madur, Raj Chakra-borty?s Teesta, Ringo?s Gaipar, Anjan Dutt?s E Moho Abaran and Raja Dasgupta?s Tiktiki. 

 There will also be a special screening of Sabitri Chatterjee?s first television venture, Bangasanhar.

 Jayashree?s Madur, about an ageing mat-weaver?s fight to hold on to his prized creation despite grinding poverty, won her the best director award at the Dhaka Film Festival last year. 

 ?Over the past year, our channel has assigned 14 new directors for telefilms. We slot a budget of around Rs 1.5-2 lakh per film,? said Chhanda Guha, head, Tara Muzik.

 Doomed love: Sudhanshu Pandey and 

 Aaksha Garodia in Akela

 After creating a whole new genre on Indian television with CID, producer-director B.P. Singh is starting an all-new show on Sony titled Akela. To start next Tuesday, Akela is the story of a young policeman Ranvir (Sudhanshu Pandey, last seen in The Myth alongside Jackie Chan and Mallika Sherawat) who meets with a near-death accident that turns his life upside down. Recovering from an eight-year coma, he discovers that he can now see and hear the dead.

 But before he gets to use his ?sixth sense?, Ranvir has many other pasts to contend with. His fiancee Kinnari (Aaksha Garodia) has got married to someone else ?while he was sleeping?. Even his mother died waiting for him to wake up and his best friend Savio (Sumeet Raghavan) lost his life in the same accident. 

 As he gets back to work, Ranvir also gets involved with researcher Meghana, who is working with him on the new cases.

 ?It?s the first time we are trying a supernatural drama for TV and we have also been able to weave in a romance,? Singh tells Metro from Mumbai. ?We believe in trying new concepts rather than repeating what is already selling on the small screen. Just like we did with CID, we hope that Akela too will reach out to the audiences very quickly.?

 Akela will be shown every Tuesday, 10 pm on Sony.

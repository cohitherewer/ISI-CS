The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Slog here, frolic there

 - Weekends are for partying in other metros

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Party people are skipping the local weekend action

 Hop on to a flight on Friday afternoon, party hard in Mumbai or Delhi for two nights on the trot and be back in the city to spend a quiet Sunday. This is the revelry roster of a growing gang of party-hoppers who are giving the weekend action in Calcutta the miss to get a taste of the real thing.

 Calcutta might party the longest but it definitely does not party the best. With the star and style quotient not a patch on the other metros, this crowd is working the week at Esplanade or Sector V, but partying the weekend at Climax or Insomnia.

 ?The biggest attraction in a Delhi or Mumbai nightclub is a whole range of high-profile artistes coming in regularly. Calcutta misses out on this action because the nightclubs and event managers here just cannot foot their bill,? says DJ Saranjeet of Incognito. ?And even a normal weekend with no international stars becomes special because of the Bollywood celebs and business barons who drop into the party places and raise the glamour quotient.?

 The party scene in Calcutta has come of age, but the action is still quite monotonous, grumbles the local circuit. ?You have to keep innovating when it comes to partying because it is all about having fun,? says Atan Mahadevan, working with an airlines company in town. ?Instead of partying hard every weekend here, I party once a month in style by flying off to Delhi or Mumbai.?

 For 40-year-old Paresh, variety is the spice that the Calcutta party people are denied. ?I have been at it since the days of Pink Elephant and, frankly, I find it boring. Though quite a few places have come up now, but where are the party people? On the other hand, a city like Delhi is rich and flashy and Mumbai is stylish and non-interfering.?

 Now with the crib factor, there?s the comfort factor. With so many flights between metros and apex fares the norm, living out the grind in Calcutta and the good life in Mumbai is a viable option for many. ?If a big do is happening a few weekends later, one can easily book cheap tickets for the gang and go and have a blast out of town,? says party-hopper Sangita Lal.

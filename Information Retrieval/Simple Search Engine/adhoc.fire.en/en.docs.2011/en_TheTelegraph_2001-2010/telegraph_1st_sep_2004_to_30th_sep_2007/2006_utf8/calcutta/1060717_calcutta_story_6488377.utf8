The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Funnyman and serious guy

 Creating a fresh round of Golmaal at the box-office, TUSSHAR KAPOOR tells Pratim D. Gupta that he doesn?t mind juggling the two rolesTusshar with Ajay Devgan, Arshad Warsi and Sharman Joshi in Golmaal

 Golmaal didn?t have 

 such a strong buzz but it has opened to good reviews. Does 

 that come as a pleasant surprise?

 I think because of the bomb blasts, people were staying away from the movies. But the Golmaal opening has been good and I am damn happy about it. In this hour, people need relief and entertainment to just ease all the tension and Golmaal may be the right film.

 You have this dual personality 

 on screen ? the serious actor of Khakee and the funnyman 

 of Kya Kool Hain Hum. Which one are you more close 

 to?

 You are right about the two images, but I love both the sides. It is always the director that matters. If you do a comic role with a bad director it can turn out to be really bad. Take for example (Raj Kumar) Santoshi. He gets the best out of me. So I can do a Khakee with him or even an Andaz Apna Apna if I do get such a role. So more than the genre, it is the director that matters for a particular film.

 Golmaal is about male 

 bonding. What was it on the sets? A whole lot of pranks?

 Pranks are passe. We were on an outdoor and were all basically concentrating on our own work. It was Ajay (Devgan) who would always get the group together and make sure that we all had dinner together. Thanks to that we got to know each other well. We ended up partying at nights. It was fun, with Ajay being a great source of inspiration. But since I had to be mute in the film, I had to concentrate harder and there was also a tutor on the sets who would help me out with the sounds.

 Pyaare Mohan, Tom Dick and 

 Harry and now Golmaal. Don?t you feel comedies 

 are having too much fun at the expense of the physically 

 challenged?

 See, Golmaal has been adapted from a Gujarati play and we just decided to go ahead with the original characters. In the film, only Pareshji (Rawal) is blind and I am mute. Now Pareshji?s being blind is very important to the plot. The way I look at it is that we are not pulling down these physically-challenged people in our films. We are just incorporating them in the folds of the society rather than keeping them aside and sympathising with them. 

 In Shootout at Lokhandwala 

 you play a gangster. How would you look the part?

 I don?t know. I am just going by director Apoorva Lakhia?s vision. He wants to give me a completely new look for the movie with a half-beard and a different hairstyle.

 The character I am playing of Dilip Bua ? a Dawood Ibrahim aide ? didn?t live long and so it?s difficult to get a lot of information about him. We are fictionalising part of his character ? and he isn?t exactly Nehru or Gandhi that we will have problems on that score. So, I am going pretty raw on the sets and getting moulded by the director.

 But you must be most excited 

 about playing your father Jeetendra?s role in the Farz 

 remake?

 You know what happened, some journalist was suggesting that I should do Farz and that got my father excited. We are still discussing and the project is yet to be finalised. But it will be really exciting to do the film if it happens.

 Why Farz, among all 

 his films?

 Because there hasn?t been a Bond film (in Hindi). There is so much scope for styling. The subject is still so fresh and something like Bond doesn?t go out of fashion. I hear they are doing another Don; that should work. The other films by Dad were so rooted in that time period.

 You were to do a 10-minute 

 film in Sanjay Gupta?s Dus Kahaaniyan called Sex 

 on the Beach?

 No, I couldn?t make it there. I believe Dino is doing it now.

 What else is on your film platter?

 There is a Hitchcockian thriller with director Ananth Mahadevan called Agar. Then there?s a Subhash Ghai campus musical called Good Boy Bad Boy, directed by Ashwini Chaudhry, and co-starring Emraan Hashmi, Tanushree Dutta and Isha Sarvani. A home production with Neeraj Vora is also on the cards.

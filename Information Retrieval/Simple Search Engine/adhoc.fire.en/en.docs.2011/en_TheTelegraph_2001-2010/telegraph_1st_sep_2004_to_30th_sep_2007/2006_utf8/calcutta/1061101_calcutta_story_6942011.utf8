 Army vetoes fairs

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The army will oppose any plea by the state before Calcutta High Court to allow the book fair and a trade fair on the Maidan in 2007.

 Soon after being sworn in as defence minister, A.K. Antony had turned down the request of a section of Bengal government officials to allow the fairs on the greens, Uttam Majumdar, counsel for the army, said on Tuesday. So, its certain that the army will oppose the governments plea before the court.

 Antonys predecessor Pranab Mukherjee had allowed the book fair to be held on the Maidan, following a request from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Armed with Mukherjees approval, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb has recently assured Booksellers and Publishers Guild that the government would move the high court again for permission to hold the mega fair on the Maidan in January.

 Last year, too, the state government had filed a similar appeal before the court, which forced my client to allow the Guild and the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce to hold their fairs on the Maidan for the last time, said Majumdar. 

 The state had then submitted before the court that an alternative site had been identified, off the Bypass, where all Maidan fairs would be shifted.

 Sources said a petition filed in the high court by the organisers of a trade fair in December 2005 would be relevant if the state moved its plea.

 The organisation had moved Justice Jayanta Biswass court after being denied permission by the army to hold a fair on the Maidan. It had alleged that the armys order was discriminatory, as it had allowed the Guild and a trade body to hold fairs on the Maidan. The judge had dismissed the appeal, but observed that the army should not commit such a mistake in future, said a lawyer on the Centres panel.

 This observation must be taken into account by the court while dealing with any fresh plea by the state with regard to permission for another fair, the lawyer added.

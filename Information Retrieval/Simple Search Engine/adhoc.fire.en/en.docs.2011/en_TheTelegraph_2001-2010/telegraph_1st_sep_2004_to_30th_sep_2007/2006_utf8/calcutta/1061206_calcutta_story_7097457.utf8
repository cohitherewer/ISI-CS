The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column 

 Canal carrier of city waste

 It is more than decade that the Ganga Action Plan has been 

 initiated. But one can see few signs of its implementation. 

 Tollys Nullah is silted particularly because of Metro 

 Railway extension work. This stretch of Adiganga, flowing 

 past Kalighat temple, Keoratala and Siriti burning ghats, 

 has become a great drainage network, carrying filthy waste 

 from several drains across the city. It is strange that 

 some people still take a bath in the filthy canal before 

 offering puja or after burning the dead.

 In the dark

 The Garia bus depot does not have 

 sufficient light, owing to which commuters are facing a 

 lot of problems. The bus numbers cannot be read at night. 

 Senior citizens are also facing problems as the conductors 

 and drivers are not helpful at times. The depot is gradually 

 turing into a den of goons. I request the authorities to 

 look into the matter.

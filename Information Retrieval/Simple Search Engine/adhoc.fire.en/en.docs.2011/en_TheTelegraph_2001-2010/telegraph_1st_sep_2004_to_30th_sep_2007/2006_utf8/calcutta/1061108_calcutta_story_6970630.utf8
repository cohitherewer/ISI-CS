 With his boyish looks and rimless 

 glasses, he could easily pass off as the guy sitting next 

 to you in college. Quite at ease with the attention and 

 adulation the 27-year-old receives from his enormous fan 

 base, especially the fairer sex, he says casually, Its 

 quite natural when you are in the limelight from such a 

 young age. 

 Thats New Zealand cricket 

 star Daniel Vettori for you. Tall, fair, handsome, 

 modest, charming and successful all the qualities a girl 

 would want in her man.

 Sexy style: He has been 

 dubbed the thinking womans sporty sex symbol. So, 

 where exactly does his sex appeal lie? I dont 

 think girls would find me sexy in any way; Im way 

 too skinny for that, smiles Vettori, in town with 

 former colleague Chris Cairns for a Pepsodent cricket tourney 

 for kids.

 Fashion quotient: Sporting 

 a maroon striped T-shirt and faded blue jeans, Daniel 

 with his gelled hair and a largish chronometer on his left 

 wrist looked cool with a capital C. Im mostly 

 in my tees and jeans or shorts; New Zealand is a very casual 

 kind of place. Consciously, I dont go all out for 

 designer labels. I wear what I look good and feel comfortable 

 in, he says.

 India connection: Vettori 

 has been touring India for quite some time. Its 

 very different from my country the place, the food, the 

 people... I love spicy Indian food, especially naan and 

 curries. Though I havent seen any Hindi movies, I 

 know quite a few of the stars out here; they are in ads 

 and on television all the time. Ive seen Saif Ali 

 Khan quite a number of times. And the actor with the stubble 

 thats Amitabh Bachchans son, him too! Besides, 

 our team-mate Deepak Patel filled us in with some juicy 

 gossip from time to time, he adds with a wink.

 Ash effect: There 

 are way too many gorgeous Indian women to be able to name 

 just a few. Aishwarya Rai, in my opinion, is very beautiful...

 Family facts: First the 

 good news: hes still a bachelor. Then the bad news: 

 Ive been seeing this girl for nearly two years 

 now. Marriage is on the cards but not right now. Im 

 just 27!

 Short curly locks, stubble on 

 reddish cheeks, athletic frame former New Zealand all-rounder 

 Chris Cairns is all that and much more. A loyal husband, 

 a devoted father, a man of many interests, Cairns is enjoying 

 every bit of life beyond cricket at present, he is hopping 

 six Indian metros in six days for the Pepsodent promotionals. 

 Theres also work for his charity organisation and 

 other business plans. 

 Cairns exudes a sensual feel, 

 a raw sex appeal with his muscular frame and piercing light 

 brown eyes.

 Sexy style: Rugged looks 

 with the right mix of dashing and dapper. It feels 

 nice to receive attention and be called hot by women. But 

 Id rather stay away from all that; it would make my 

 wife very angry, he laughs.

 Fashion quotient: Dressed 

 in a beige T-shirt, dark blue jeans and slippers, casual 

 is his code. I have very classical tastes; I dont 

 let myself be ruled by trends. For formal occasions, I love 

 wearing a well-tailored suit. But if its a casual 

 outing, youll find me dressed just the way I am now. 

 Do designer labels draw him? Not that they attract 

 me much, but I like clothes from Giorgio Armani and D amp;G, 

 he says. I have also seen outfits by Indian fashion 

 designers, but I think they are way too loud for me. I like 

 wearing blacks, blues and whites.

 India connection: Next 

 stop for his charity foundation is India. The documentation 

 is under process and until then we cant raise funds 

 here. We would like to work for child education in India, 

 though in New Zealand we are involved with (safety at) rail 

 crossings; I lost my sister in one such accident.

 Wow wife: My wife 

 is the most beautiful woman in this world, he says 

 without batting an eyelid. Prod him further and he adds, 

 I want to play this safe. Of course, there are other 

 women who look nice. Indian women, for sure. There are so 

 many Miss Worlds from India.

 Family facts: Im 

 a very happy man, touch wood. I have a lovely wife who is 

 from South Africa and two boys, aged three and four.

 Kids lose access to playground

 No childs play: Vivekananda Park, 

 near Lake Kalibari. A Telegraph picture

 Dilip Upadhyay: Vivekananda Park, in front of Lake Kalibari, has been taken away from the children to build a cricket coaching centre. Children are not allowed to play in the park and they are forced to play on the roads, which is very dangerous. How can you deprive children from playing inside a park for a cricket coaching centre? 

 The park belongs to Calcutta Improvement Trust. Therefore, the CMC or your local councillor can?t do anything. It is entirely their decision to hand over the park to a cricket club. But I personally feel, children should be allowed to play as there is no other place where they can play.

 Pastoral picks in porcelain

 Porcelain is a hard ceramic substance 

 made by heating certain materials including kaolinite at 

 high temperature. But the effect of porcelain is rather 

 soft and soothing ? on the room it occupies, and on the 

 eye. 

 So it?s all right if you are tired of those oh-so-common Egyptian pitchers, table lamps and potted plants. You could give porcelain ? which got its name from the white, shiny Venus-shell, called porcella in old Italian ? a chance. 

 Nik Nish has a collection of the porcelain pieces that could add charm, and a hint of nostalgia, to a corner of your house that looks a little dull. 

 All imported, many of them from China, the country where the oldest porcelain pieces were made, these showpieces on stands are about five feet tall. They are mostly in shades of off-white and antique copper, allowing you to co-ordinate them with the colour schemes of your room and upholstery.

 There are artistic figurines draped in elaborate gowns and frilled jackets, ornate carvings, intricate detailing that evoke the past and a pastoral charm. But it is the waterfall effect incorporated in each of the works that makes them eyecatchers. 

 To create this artificial waterfall, one has to pour in water in the semicircular bowl that each piece of art is placed on.

 ?They are most popular with people who love to keep their decor theme yesteryear and nostalgic. But the adventurous modern couple aiming at a fusion of conventional and contemporary sensibilities like to place these pieces alongside modern art,? says Ranjan Purkayastha, general manager, Nik Nish. 

 Within a semi-cylindrical dome is a village scene. A man and a woman with a pitcher in her hands stand near a well. Flowers in full bloom and trees with abundant foliage create the background. 

 Water from a bucket above the well flows on a round crystal to flower-shaped holders. A bell-shaped bulb on top tinged with an orange hue has a stunning appeal. 

 An elephant on a stony cliff eyes the lush banana trees. The water flows from one tree to the other. The lights reflect on the trickling water. 

 The showstealer is a piece where the mother in a stylish Victorian gown that drapes over in folds is seen along with her children, filling up pitchers. The showpiece is adorned with tiny red roses on top and brownish maple leaves below.

 Others include a romantic couple where the women listens with pleasure while her man plays the mandolin.

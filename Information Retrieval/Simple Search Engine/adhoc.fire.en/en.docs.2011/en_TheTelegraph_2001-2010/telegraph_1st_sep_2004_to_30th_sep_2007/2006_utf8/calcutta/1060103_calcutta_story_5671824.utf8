 Simple rules to study right

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, it is essential to create a healthy environment for children to study. Place their table in the north-east corner of the room since this is the educational corner. This will help them concentrate better. Inspirational quotes kept near the table will enchance their interest in studies

Q: I need your advice on the career prospects of my two sons. The elder ones date of birth is 20.04.1991 and the younger ones 18.10.2000. Please advise how I can make them concentrate on their studies and work towards bright careers for them.

 THE SOLUTION: Ensure that they are studying in a healthy environment with their tables placed in the north-east corner of the room. This being an educational corner will help them concentrate on their studies.

 Inspirational quotes like we are blessed with divine intelligence and great concentration written near their tables will help enhance their interest in studies.

 Tree trouble 

 Q: I have a retail shop in front of which there is a huge tree that acts as a barrier. I am aware that its not good for my business and should be removed. However, the municipal authorities are not ready to grant permission to cut the tree. How can Feng Shui help protect my business in this situation?

 Abhijit Sen

 THE SOLUTION: The tree could be harmful for your business but only if it is close enough to your main entrance. If the distance between the tree and your entrance is more than twice the height of your shop, then it will have no effect. For instance, if the height of your shop is 12 feet, then the tree will be detrimental to your business only if it is within 24 feet of the main entrance. 

 The best thing to do in this situation is to make a new entrance to your shop and close the existing one. However, if this is not possible then you should place a mirror or reflective plate in front of your main entrance. 

 Problem plot

 Q: I am interested in buying a plot of land that is being auctioned by government officials. This plot belonged to a businessman who has become insolvent and hence his property is being auctioned. Is it advisable to purchase such a plot? If not, then can I buy the land and then take corrective measures to get rid of the ill-effects? Also, please suggest guidelines for buying land for personal use.

 Nitin

 THE SOLUTION: Feng Shui does not approve of negative plots of land like burial grounds, cremation grounds, land belonging to magicians, plots where someone was murdered or had committed suicide and, of course, ones auctioned by the court.

 These lands absorb the prevailing negative energy very deeply and no remedy can completely purify them. They are best left untouched. If bought, they bring sorrow and grief in life, obstacles to progress resulting in financial constraints, mental and physical problems.

 Future fix

 Q: I was born on 11.11.1982 in Siliguri. I am pursuing management studies and want to opt for finance as my specialisation. Will the new year work for me as far as my profession is concerned? Will I get an opportunity to work in my hometown or do I have to look for jobs outside? Also, how will my personal life shape up in the coming years?

 Dipojjal Chowdhury

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak earth person. You are entering into an earth period from 2006, which will help to strengthen your weak self earth element. This means that it will boost your confidence and luck and all your dreams will be realised. 

 Water element represents wealth for an earth person and the numerous fields connected with it are banking, finance, media, communication and marketing. So you can specialise in finance and the chances of getting a job in your hometown will be very bright. As far as your personal life goes, relationships should flower this year.

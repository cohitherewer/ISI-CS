Why Pujor Nandini deserves the crown for festive communication

SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

The din has died down. The crowd has gone home. Puja 

2006 is over. It is a good time to look back, take stock and announce the winner. 

Yes, if you revisit the frenzy of marketing activities over the last couple of 

months, you would feel that a major Olympic event has taken place. And in an Olympic 

event there always is a winner.

As is usual in prize distribution ceremonies, let 

me start with an honourable mention that could have won the trophy. The Dunlop 

ad was an example of how good advertising can manage to communicate with simple 

visuals and very few words. In these days of haste and hurry, brevity is a virtue. 

The Dunlop ad showed long tyre marks and merely said Dugga Dugga. It is a quintessential 

Bengali phrase that wishes someone a safe, successful and happy journey. We all 

know about the re-opening of the Dunlop factory in Shahganj. It was indeed 

very poignant.

My man of the series award, however, goes not to an 

advertisement but a whole event. Yes, I am talking about the Pujor Nandini contest 

from Ponds. It involved picking happy faces from pandals and then choosing the 

prettiest or the happiest amongst them on each festive day through expert judgment. 

Finally, one got selected through SMS from the people. She became the face of 

the festivity Pujor Nandini. Nice, simple event. People felt happy being photographed. 

Onlookers enjoyed the spectacle. The novelty provoked word of mouth. Lots of people 

sent in the SMS. Many others did not bother but chose their favourites, mentally. 

The chosen ones were in seventh heaven. These were ordinary girls achieving Cinderella-like 

status all of a sudden. All the symptoms of public involvement were evident. Yet, 

do these qualities make the event a great one?

Not quite. There is something else in this event that 

makes it special in marketing terms. All too often one hears various marketing 

instruments of a brand, playing solo in the marketplace. One does not necessarily 

support the other. The orchestration is missing. This is where Ponds and Pujor 

Nandini excelled. Brand Ponds operates in the arena of face. Its campaign reminds 

you to take care of your face because it speaks for your mind. That indeed is 

the core brand platform face and mind. The Pujor Nandini event was built on 

the same linkage. It rewarded happiness on the face because it believed that a 

happy face connotes a happy and healthy mind.

Then came the master stroke. The happiest face, to 

the consumer, translated as the most beautiful face. As a consequence, Ponds was 

able to redefine the concept of beauty. It shifted the focus from body or fashion 

to face and mind. By doing that it married the brand event to the brand campaign. 

Indeed, in the cacophonic world of below-the-line marketing, Pujor Nandini was 

Beethoven symphony.

 Teen panel picks top pujas

 The Pujas had many judges touring 

 the streets in search of the best and the brightest. But 

 few took their jobs as seriously as these 24 teenagers. 

 On the morning of Pratipada, they had gathered at South 

 Point High School auditorium to attend a workshop to prepare 

 them for the task at hand to choose the best pandal, idol 

 and ambience.

 The MP Birla Puja Utkarsh Samman, meant to make the GeNext aware of tradition and honour creativity and ingenuity, had 18 students from South Point and six from MP Birla Foundation School as judges.

 At the workshop, researcher Purba Sengupta quoted Kalikapurana to justify participation in the celebrations. It is not right to turn ones back on the festivities by not wearing new clothes or visiting the idol. The Devi takes offence at this.

 She told them about scriptural prescriptions on the look of the goddess. Her hue should be like an atashi flowers greenish yellow. Her eyes should stretch to the ears. There is joy in one eye and anguish in another, as She has vanquished the enemy but even the enemy is Her child.

 Sengupta criticised use of materials that shows disrespect to the goddess. Ask the priest a few questions, like what Purana he is following. That way the organiser would be warned against employing an ignorant priest using slipshod methods.

 Calcutta Police assistant commissioner Subrata Narayan Sarkar spoke of the duties of cops during the four festive days, giving the young judges an understanding of discipline at a pandal.

 Former director of Indian Museum Shyamal Chakrabarti used a slide show to trace the evolution of Durga iconography. Bengal has made two contributions to this using soft clay as building material and seeing the goddess as part of a family.

 Debmalya Biswas, now in Class XII, told the audience how he could add value to his para puja with his last years judging experience.

 The young judges were itching to hit the streets. My mother is even more excited than I am, laughed Subhra Chattopadhyay of Class IX. My family does not go out much during the Pujas. I am looking forward to pandal-hopping with VIP treatment, said Nausheen Tasneen. After two days of criss-crossing the town, their verdict was in the best idol at Ramlal Bazar, Haltu, the best pandal of Behala Club and the best ambience at Barisha Yubak Brinda.

 Navami spirit

 Student-judges leaf through their Puja project reports.

 I surf through the television channels in amazement at what art can achieve. I stare in pleasant surprise at the varied theme Pujas, scattered all over Calcutta and the suburbs, inspiring mass appreciation for the works of art.

 On the one hand, this is perhaps that time of the year when forgotten artisans get an opportunity to display their creativity and get some sort of recognition for their talent. It is a time when people unite in a season of festivities, forgetting the mundane things of life.

 Yet on the other hand, a single visit to the neighbourhood pandal shows me that as we celebrate Navami once again, somewhere down the line we fail again to establish the good that we talk so enthusiastically about. For as I prepare to offer my puja at the pandal, with mishti and pronami, theres this little boy next to me, wearing the very torn garment that he wears everyday. 

 He looks on at the Durga idol with a twinkle in his eyes that seems to say something. As I walk into the mandap,I am tempted to decipher the meaning of that twinkle. Perhaps it spoke of a curious amazement towards the splendour and might of the goddess; or perhaps it was just praying for a good meal on Navami at least. Perhaps it had spoken of the same meal on Ashtami as well.

 We blissfully ignore his predicament without so much as a thought, busied by the important work of spending on a good theme puja and anticipating one of the many prizes awarded by different organisations. A prize for having spent well on a Durga puja; a Durga puja mind you, and not a Navami well-lived. 

 Might we not distribute awards for social service during the pujas, rather than awarding the grandeur that is here today and will disappear tomorrow? 

 However much I might be fond of theme pujas, I simply cannot overlook the fact that an increasingly large amount of money is being spent on them. Can we not just cut down the budget for giving to those who need it most? Can we not strive to award the spirit of Navami, rather than the empty spirit, that I dare say, the goddess would not be very fond of.

 Final four

 Now, there are just four contestants left in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs. And all are achievers in their own right. Sanchita Bhattacharya, a Class IX student from Howrah, admits her weakness: My voice is low-pitched, adding that she enjoys the company of her co-participants. The aspiring actress is a big fan of actor Iqbal Khan.

 The quietest of the lot is Abhrakanti Saha, a 12-year-old from Bidhannagar Government High School. He rates himself highest for his performances of Barkha Ka Mausam and Teri Deewani. Math and science are his favourite subjects.

 The naughtiest is Sameer Mohammad, lovingly called Thande Hawa Ka Jhaunka by Shaan and Abhijeet. The student of Class VI says about himself: I am good in studies but not good enough to top the class. He loves to play cricket and football.

 Divakar Sharma, a Delhiite, sounds quite confident for a 13-year-old. He is differently-abled but never feels insecure because of it: I enjoy what Im doing and so Im confident.

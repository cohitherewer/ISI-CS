 Madhyamik grades in 08

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The state government plans to introduce the grade system in Madhyamik, as it has done for the Higher Secondary (HS) exams, from 2008 onwards.

 In the new system, students will be awarded grades and marks in individual subjects, but there will be no mention of the aggregate or division in the report card.

 Following a directive from the education department, the secondary education board has called a meeting of its executive committee in the second week of October to finalise the decision.

 The concept of grades is new to students, teachers and guardians. We need to take their opinion first, said board president Ujjwal Basu. The board is discussing the issue with all those involved in the Madhyamik system. We will convey our stand on the matter to the government after next months meeting.

 The meeting will discuss the scale on which the grades will be divided.

 Officials say the government initially wanted to start the system, which will bring Madhyamik on a par with ICSE or CBSE exams, from next year.

 But All Bengal Teachers Association (ABTA), a CPM-backed organisation, persuaded the government to try the model first in the internal exams of the schools.

 The grade system is the most scientific way of assessing students in school-leaving exams, said Aparesh Bhattacharya, an ABTA leader and a member of the board.

 But we want every teacher, guardian and student to the understand the system and accept it wholeheartedly. It would be ideal to start the system in classes VI to IX and then introduce it in Madhyamik, he added.

 Calcutta Central, the seamless mall format of the Pantaloon group coming up at the junction of Ballygunge Circular Road and AJC Bose Road, promises to bring to the city a ?never-before combo of shop-eat-celebrate? to add to Calcutta?s ever-expanding retail horizon.

 ?Calcutta will have a new-format Central, different from the Pune, Bangalore and Hyderabad outlets. Designed by the celebrated Rockwell Group of New York, with a seamlessly integrated cineplex, a larger food court and more efficient parking systems, the Central will also have a series of retail activators,? said Kishore Biyani, managing director, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd.

 The G+5 structure of the Calcutta Central, which can be accessed from both Ballygunge Circular Road and AJC Bose Road, will have a built-up area of 281,700 sq ft, with a 656-ft frontage. The mall with a shop-in-shop concept housing all leading brands under one roof, aims to be an ?experiential shopping destination?, with live music and events at the core.

 The Rockwell Group?s typical style of articulating a brand through storytelling will be evident in Calcutta Central. ?We use architecture as the DNA to grow the brand, delving deep into our scenic design competence, since architecture and movies have a great chemistry,? Mark Patricof, president and CEO of the Rockwell Group told Metro.

 The US design house has created such icons like Kodak Theater in LA, Michael Jordan?s flexi-space restaurant in New York?s Grand Central Station and America?s largest retail complex, Meadowlands Xanadu in New Jersey. In Calcutta, it will use elements like ?swing retail? to liven up a dead zone through ?changeable energisers?.

 A Central typically has a mix of retail, foodcourts, restaurants, multiplex and/or hotel rooms. Calcutta Central is among the 51 malls to be set up by Kshitij, the asset-management company backed by Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd.

 The ?Kshitij Destinations?, involving 14.5 million sq ft of prime retail real estate across 14 states and 29 cities, promises to provide the Indian retailer with ?an accelerated pan-India footprint?. ?The retail footprint of 51 malls ensures a nationwide presence, in the shortest possible timeframe to any retailer. By tying up with us, retailers get access to the best locations across metros, mini-metros and tier-2 towns,? says Shishir Baijal, CEO, Kshitij.

 ?Calcutta Central will also raise the bar in terms of quality of merchandising and hence, there?s a long list of retailers keen to be present in Central,? observed Joanna deSouza, business development amp; head leasing, PFH Investment Advisory Co Ltd, advising Kshitij.

 Besides Central, the Pantaloon group is keen to bring to Calcutta its books-music-stationery combo ?Depot? to Calcutta, besides the ?Fashion Station? format, serving the consumer crusts between Pantaloons and Big Bazaar, according to Biyani. ?Health Village?, a combination of alternative therapies and wellness packages, is also set to hit town.

 ?E-Zone?, an electronics chain, and ?Collection-I? stocking home stuff, will soon make a combined entry, while ?M-Bazaar? and ?M-Port?, communications solutions for the masses and the elite, respectively, are also in the pipeline, as the group charts out an aggressive expansion course.

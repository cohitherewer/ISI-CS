 Promises made, mauled

 Fort William said on Thursday it was willing to host the Book Fair on the Maidan provided Calcutta High Court gave the green signal and no damage was done to the green.

 While the court ruling is awaited, the extensive damage done to the Maidan by Book Fair 2006 was highlighted in The Telegraph on Tuesday, with photographs capturing the debris still on the precious patch of green, 10 months on.

 If the court allows it, we wont object. But the fair has to be held in such a manner that environmental degradation of the Maidan is prevented, said GOC Bengal Deepak Raj, after a meeting at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.

 The meeting with the army was convened by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb to arrive at a consensus before the government moves the high court, seeking permission for the Book Fair on the Maidan.

 Publishers and Booksellers Guild officials, of course, promised to ensure that the Book Fair was organised in an eco-friendly manner. 

 Guild secretary Tridib Chatterjee said: During the fair, we will control the dust by sprinkling water regularly and after the fair, we will plant grass on the Maidan.

 Such promises were made last winter as well, when the court had given the Guild special permission to hold the fair on the Maidan for the last time.

 On Thursday, Metro toured the Book Fair 2006 site and found ugly remains of those January-February days patches of brown that were meant to be green, mounds of dug-up dirt, makeshift cable pillars and cable lines.

 The impact of the eco-friendly fair is visible just a few yards off the main road leading into the fairground in the form of a giant circular concrete structure, devoid of grass on the sides. This was the fountain built in front of the Guild office during the Book Fair.

 Move on and just behind the Territorial Army camp is a row of saplings, evidently planted to make the Maidan greener. Most have wilted and died. The pond that finds pride of place in the fairs scheme of things continues to be a watery mass of muck. And large patches, meant to have been grassed and restored, remain brown and bare. The physical scars of peg marks and furrows still dot the Maidan. Except one banyan tree at the eastern end, all others have chunks of concrete or asphalt or large craters at the base.

 Yet, the Guild claims that Book Fair 2007 will not harm the Maidan, and its custodian, the army, takes its word for it. And Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee prepares to move high court to keep the Maidan-mauling fair on the greens.

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said: Last year, the state government alone had moved court. We will consult the advocate-general and decide whether the army should be made a party this time.

 Green activist Subhas Dutta said the governments double standards must be highlighted, along with its failure to comply with a court to set up a watchdog committee for the Maidan.

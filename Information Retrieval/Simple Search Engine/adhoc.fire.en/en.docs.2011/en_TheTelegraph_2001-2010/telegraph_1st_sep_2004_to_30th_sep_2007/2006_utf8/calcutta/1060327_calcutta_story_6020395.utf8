The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Mummy?s girl grows up

Screen On amp; Off

 Hyderabad Hunk: N. Karunya

 Mother Hema Malini may not be too keen to have daughter Esha Deol expose on screen, but the Dhoom babe has had enough of being draped in those annoying salwar kurtas. After she emerged in a bikini from the Goa waters, Bo Derek style, in the Sanjay Gadhvi bike-and-babes flick, Esha is now treading untrodden paths in Vikram Bhatt?s semi-autobiographical film Ankahee, where she plays a character inspired by Sushmita Sen.

 Esha who has lost a lot of flab to look fab on the big screen has not only done the so-called bold scenes in the film (with one-time boyfriend Aftab Shivdasani) but has also done a special backless shoot for the publicity stills of the movie. After being ?convinced of what the character demands?, Esha threw everyone out of the sets, except lensman Subi Samuel and film producer Rangita Pritish Nandy, before shedding her inhibitions (and clothes).

 She may not be following mummy?s moral codes but Esha will sure feature as the female lead in Hema Malini?s new directorial venture, which will be the original Dream Girl?s second project after Dil Aashna Hai. And Hema is not looking beyond the oh-so-good Abhishek Bachchan to romance daughter Esha on screen.

 Bold amp; Beautiful: Esha Deol

 He is being billed as the Abhishek Bachchan of the small screen and if his female fans are anything to go by, Karunya will make a popular Indian Idol if he does win the title. 

 Recently when the Hyderabad guy, now in a new hairstyle, performed live in Delhi, the female population was almost snatching and tearing his clothes apart. 

 Karunya then went on to feature on a women?s show on radio that has never allowed any man on air. What?s more, he gave beauty tips to his female fans.

 And this craze is not just restricted to Delhi. The charm has also spread as far as Ahmedabad, where one of his fans Vimmi has pasted Karunya?s photographs all around her house. She is seen most of the time in an Indian Idol T-shirt, on which she has printed the Hyderabadi?s photograph on both the sides. 

 You can catch Karunya?s Delhi exploits on the Monday episode of Indian Idol, 9 pm on Sony.

 It?s fun of a different flavour where more the slime, the crazier it goes. Nick, the TV channel for kids, has launched a special slime show of its own called the Gili Gili Gappa. Coming at 4.30 pm every Friday, the fast-paced show embodies Nick?s characteristic features of noise, mess and slime.

 The first international version of Nick?s Guinness World Record-breaking game show Slimetime Live, Gili Gili Gappa is hosted by two fresh faces ? the quirky Nischint (aka Nishu) and the lively Aaliyah. This spunky duo have to try and keep order while contributing to the chaos.

 In Gili Gili Gappa, two teams go head-to-head in each of the six unique games while the final round has the two winners up against each other for the big challenge ? a chance to sit under the Gili Gili Ganga machine for a complete sliming! Even the eliminated contestants can get into the act equipped with water balloons, Gili Gili shooters and popcorn.

This new slime show functions as links between the 

four shows on the two-hour Nick Toons block on the channel ? Trollz, Chalk 

Zone, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron and SpongeBob SquarePants.

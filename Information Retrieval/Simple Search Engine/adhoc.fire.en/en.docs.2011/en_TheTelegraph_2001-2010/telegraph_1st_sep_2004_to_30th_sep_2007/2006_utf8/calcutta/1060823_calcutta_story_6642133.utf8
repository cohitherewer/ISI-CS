 National Library: Satisfaction quest. A Telegraph picture

 National Library is making an all-out effort to upgrade the quality of its service to readers and properly utilise its manpower. The library has about three million books, magazines, journals, maps, and Indian and foreign documents.

 We want all readers to be fully satisfied. In the course of time, we will make CDs of all the books and journals so that a reader can look up any document by clicking the mouse. We hope to complete work within three years, said Sudhendu Mondal, director of the library. 

 The authorities of National Library are organising a national seminar on January 5 and 6, 2007, the theme of which will be National Library as an Intellectual Resource. Eminent personalities from all over the country and SAARC countries will participate in the seminar. 

 Apart from the main theme, other issues to be discussed include the conceptual framework of National Library and role of its leadership, documents collection (both print and non-print), legal deposition on national bibliography control, information services, resources saving and networking, international cooperation, and last, but not the least, organisation and manpower. 

 Experts in different fields like information technology and administration will participate in the seminar. 

 Apart from Visva-Bharati and the universities Calcutta, Jadavpur and Kalyani, professors of universities in Delhi, Hyderabad and Jammu and Kashmir will join the two-day seminar. 

 Our aim is to serve the intellectual 

 community in a better way. We will update and modernise 

 our services so that we can meet the demands of the readers, 

 director Mondal said. Every day, about 250 readers, including 

 foreigners, go to study at the library. The figure goes 

 up to 400500 on weekends.

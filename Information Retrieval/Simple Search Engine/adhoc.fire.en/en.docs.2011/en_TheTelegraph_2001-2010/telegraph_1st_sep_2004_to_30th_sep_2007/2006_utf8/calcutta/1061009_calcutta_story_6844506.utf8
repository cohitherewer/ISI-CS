The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 More blaze-busters on fringes

 Gopal Bhattacharya, director of West Bengal Fire Services, met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. 

Participants included Jagannath Datta, Sandip Chakraborty, Shashi Damani, Talat Shalahuddin and Tarit Basu

Jagannath Datta: Many new buildings and apartment blocks are coming up on the eastern and southern fringes of the city. In case of a fire in these areas, fire tenders have to travel far to reach the spots and are delayed. Why cant you set up new fire stations in these areas and new townships? 

 There are around 103 fire stations across the state. In Calcutta and its adjoining areas, there are 22 fire stations. We have 450 fire tenders and special appliances like the aerial ladder on hand to tackle any kind of mishap anywhere in the state.

 However, I agree that expansion is essential due to urbanisation and industrialisation of the fringes. 

 But we cannot take up such programmes overnight. It requires a lot of planning, policy decisions and funds for land, vehicles, equipment and also for the manpower. 

 However, the state government has already started considering proposals on extension of fire services in the fringes. Recently, we had sent a proposal to the state government for a new fire station at Rajarhat. Talks are on with the authorities for land allocation and funds. 

Sandip Chakraborty: There are many complaints against your department. People allege that the firemen never reach on time. We have read in the newspapers and also seen television news reports about people attacking fire brigade officials for arriving late. What is your point of view? 

 Such allegations are baseless. A handful of miscreants indulge in such campaigns against us. Our officers are always prepared to tackle any fire incident. Its our duty and our job, why would we incur a delay in case of any emergency? 

 I admit that in some cases, our fire tenders get delayed due to traffic snarls on the roads. But that is not in our hands. We try our best to reach on time. But as I told you before, we are trying to introduce more fire stations across the city, so that we can provide better service.

Shashi Damani: Calcutta has more number of illegal buildings than legal ones. Almost all these illegal buildings are fire-prone and are mushrooming at an alarming rate. In case of any emergency, it is you, who have to carry out the rescue operations. Then why cant you take some steps against such illegal constructions?

 Illegal constructions are not under the purview of the fire services department. The city civic authorities should watch out for such constructions. But nothing has been done. We are helpless as we dont have any powers to stop the structures from coming up. 

Shashi Damani: Then will you ignore a case of fire in such an illegal building? 

 When we get a fire call, our duty is to reach the spot as quickly as possible and douse the flames and rescue the people. 

 Before going on an assignment, we really cannot choose whether a building is legal or illegal.

 However, after dousing the flames, if we find that the building is an illegal property and does not have an adequate fire-protection system, we lodge a complaint with the police. 

 We cannot directly punish anyone for committing such an offence.

Talat Shalahuddin: What about including women in the fire-fighting force? There are reports in the newspapers that you are planning to include women in your fire-fighting teams. Is it true? If yes, then what is the progress?

 Im very glad to inform that we will get a special women fire-fighters team soon, who will do field work. I want to mention that West Bengal will be the first state in the country to do so.

 The process is on to recruit 30 women as field workers through employment exchanges in the state. We hope the team will start operating by the end of this year. 

Tarit Basu: Do the puja committees cooperate with your department? 

 Yes, they do. Although a few organisers are difficult to manage. They try to dodge us by virtue of their political connections. 

 In case of fire incidents in these pandals, we immediately lodge an FIR with the police against the organisers. We had three fire incidents during the Pujas in 2005. We will take similar measures this Diwali and see that people have a safe and happy Kali puja and Diwali.

To be concluded

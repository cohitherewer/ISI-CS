The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One stop for wanderlust

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Coming up, Kashmir to Kerala under one roof. The state government has decided to build an integrated tourist complex in Salt Lake, the first of its kind in the eastern region, where people can make their travel plans and even book their berths.

 The complex, to be up by 2007-end, will house tourist information centres of the states, railway and airline reservation and hotel-booking counters.

 This will save tourists the hassle of checking out various offices scattered throughout the city to firm up travel plans.

 The project will be a joint venture with a private developer. The estimated budget is around Rs 50 crore. 

 Our aim is to present a collage of various travel options before the tourists under one roof. This way, they can chalk out their travel plan easily, without having to run around, explained managing director of West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC) Sourin Bhattacharya.

 According to the plan, the private partner will invest the entire amount while the tourism department will provide land to build the 10-storeyed complex.

 We have already invited private entrepreneurs interested in the project. We are expecting to complete the preliminary formalities, including selection of the partner, within a month. Work is likely to start by December and end in a year, Bhattacharya added.

 Space will also be provided to reputed tour operators, travel agents and tourist guides. Besides, there will be a seminar and a banquet hall, a tourist exhibition gallery, a conference room, a training centre for travel guides and food outlets. A guest house for tourists to stay over, if and when required, staff quarters and executive apartments have also been planned.

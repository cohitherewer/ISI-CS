The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Meet to showcase success of club

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Three-month-old Bisakha Hela?s parents were crestfallen when they learnt that the baby had a hole in her heart and they didn?t have the money for the operation. 

 It was worse for the parents of Suman Mandal, a 24-day-old baby from Malda with the same complaint. Both the babies are doing fine now after surgery, thanks to Healing Little Hearts, a Rotary project.

 Healing Little Hearts will be an integral part of Rotary International District 3290?s inter-city meet on Public Image of Rotary, when the 102-year-old body showcases its past achievements, charts out new goals, and asks eminent Calcuttans for their perception of the social service organisation.

 ?It is a look in the mirror for us,? said Debasish Mitra, who took charge as the district governor this month. ?We?d like to assess how non-Rotarians are viewing us, whether we are giving the service to society that we should and how we can improve ourselves,? added Mitra, who plans to turn the meet into an annual affair.

 The meet, on July 22, will feature a panel comprising Exide chief S.B. Ganguly, the chief minister?s wife Mira Bhattacharjee, minister Mohammad Salim, danseuse Preeti Patel and artist Suvaprasanna, among others.

 District 3290 comprises 186 Rotary clubs in India, Port Blair and Nepal, making it the largest district in the global Rotary chain of 32,000 clubs.

 ?Work we have done in the past year includes donating artificial limbs to 51 people, adopting 50 government schools to provide facilities like drinking water and donating ambulances,? Mitra said.

 And, of course, Healing Little Hearts. ?The response to the project has been fantastic. We had thought of 12 operations but had to double the number. Sponsors have also been lining up,? said Shekhar Mehta, chairman of the endeavour.

 Upcoming projects include equipping villages adjacent to highways with 25 ambulances to rush accident victims to the nearest hospital, providing 300 tubewells with arsenic filters to North and South 24-Parganas villages, making 5,000 young people computer literate through Rotary?s Ghalib Street centre and adopting slum areas in Calcutta.

 Music is an outpouring of emotions, specially when spontaneous. It can be an expression of religious fervour, or may even convey the pure joy a mother feels when singing a lullaby for her infant. Such spontaneity in musical expression led to the birth and evolution of folk music. Time of day and moods related to the different seasons played a significant role in shaping folk songs. Malhar, a lively folk style from undivided Uttar Pradesh, is a typical example. Reflecting the mystery and romance of the earth and the sky, Malhar tunes also echo the agonies and ecstasies of our lives. With their moods rooted in their original source, they evolved as ragas and, with time, changed in gait and stature. Such moods have been embodied in a host of Malhar ragas. An Evening of Malhars presents flautist Ronu Mazumdar and sitar player Gaurav Mazumdar in a concert featuring a number of these monsoon melodies. They will be accompanied by Abhijit Banerjee and Subhankar Banerjee, respectively, on the tabla.

 Event: Music concert of Malhar ragas 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park

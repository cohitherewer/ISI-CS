The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 A world of wonder

 Glimpses of home 

 automation systems to be available at Wonderland on 

 Park Street 

 Colour changing lights to ease the eyes, oxygen and aroma therapy to soothe the soul, and an array of high-tech tools to please the home-happy.

 The second Onkyo Wonderland in the country, coming up in Calcutta by July, promises all that and more.

 On offer at the Park Street address would be the entire range of home-theatre systems from the Japanese audio giant, speakers from brands like ELAC, Bowers amp; Wilkins and Jamo, and a host of tech tools like touch panels and learning remotes.

 The Onkyo Wonderland will be a one-stop shop for all your audio video needs and a little more, promises Manoj Bhatia, Onkyos business partner for the east.

 The first Wonderland opened recently in Bangalore while the third has been planned for Surat.

 Home automation systems would occupy significant shelf space in the 4,000-sq-ft showroom spanning two floors adjacent to Karnani Mansions.

 From switching on the TV to controlling the room temperature, dimming the lights or even drawing the drapes, everything can be done with the single touch of a button.

 Touch panels like these from Crestron, priced Rs 4.5 lakh upwards, would be available in Calcutta for the first time, says Bhatia.

 Apart from the product mix, its the lounge ambience of the showroom that should set it apart from other electronics stores.

 The combination of lights, oxygen and aroma will refresh you within half-an-hour, offers Bhatia, who has invested around Rs 40 lakh in the property.

 There would also be a DJ playing music on various audio equipment. You can request tracks or bring your own music to hear the difference here.

 A corner with 1960s-70s music is also planned for the older generation of buyers. 

 Other attractions include learning remotes, light control panels and high-end cables. The remote can be programmed to control any electronic gadget in the house that requires a remote, be it plasma or audio or video players, explains Bhatia.

 Light control panels from LiteTouch can precisely control the intensity of lights in every corner of the room or the entire house, from a single wall panel.

 These come with life-time warranty and are priced at Rs 55,000 for a single room to Rs 8 lakh and above for a house around 4,000 sq ft, Bhatia adds.

 The tech Wonderland would be made operational in two phases. By July we would have most of the major product lines in place and by November everything else should be functional, says Bhatia.

 The store would target corporate buyers for boardroom solutions and the high-end home segment for domestic solutions.

 With the entry of new brands 

 and the prices coming down in home-theatre systems and other 

 audio-video equipment, we have seen a good response from 

 the middle-income group in recent times. The store would 

 also help us draw in new clientele, offers Bhatia, 

 who currently sells Onkyo and other brands from his Shakespeare 

 Sarani showroom.

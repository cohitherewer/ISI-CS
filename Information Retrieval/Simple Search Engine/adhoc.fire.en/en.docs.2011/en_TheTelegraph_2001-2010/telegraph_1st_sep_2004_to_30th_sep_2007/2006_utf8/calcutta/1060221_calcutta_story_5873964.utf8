The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bill in tug-of-war

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The suspense over the East Calcutta Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Bill was prolonged on Monday, with the Assembly standing committee on environment and forest deciding to refer the matter back to the land and land reforms department.

 The department had objected to the bill, stating that dag numbers 171 to 175 in Dhapa Manpur mouza were waterbodies filled up to allow two housing projects on the Ramsar site. 

 If the bill is passed, the two housing projects, declared ?illegal? by the high court last September, will get legal sanction and the character of the wetlands will be changed.

 After Monday?s thinly-attended meeting, standing committee chairman Mursalin Mollah said: ?The bill will only be discussed in detail on March 2, when the committee meets to finalise its report.?

 Another member of the standing committee added: ?We were informed by the law department that part of the bill is sub-judice and that the land and land reforms department has contested the case in court. We would like to hear their objections to the bill, along with the land schedule as per their records.?

 The case is now in the Supreme Court, which has issued a stay order on construction at both sites.

 Monday also saw Trinamul Congress MLA Sougata Roy raising the matter on the floor of the House and accusing the environment department of pushing the bill in order to help ?some promoters to get legal sanction for their blacklisted projects?.

 Meanwhile, the Union environment ministry faxed a letter to the chief secretary?s office on Monday afternoon, seeking an ?immediate? clarification on the proposed bill. 

 ?We?ve categorically told the state government that there cannot be any deviation from the original datasheet of the East Calcutta Wetlands, which it had sent to the Ramsar Bureau,? an environment ministry official told Metro.

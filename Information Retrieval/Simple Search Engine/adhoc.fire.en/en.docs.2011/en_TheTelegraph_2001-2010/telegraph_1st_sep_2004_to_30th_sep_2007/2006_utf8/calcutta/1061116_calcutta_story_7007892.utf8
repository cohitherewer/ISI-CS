 Contemporary Chinese cinema made its way into the 12th Calcutta Film Festival with a bouquet of films made between 2003 and 2006. Theres Li Yangs Blind Shaft, Ning Yings Perpetual Motion and a bunch of short films by seven directors called Seven Colours. The most well-known is Wang Xiaoshuais Shanghai Dreams (poster above), which entered the competitive section and won the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2005.

 The package comprises social films reflecting current trends in Chinese cinema, says Luisa Prudentino, a programmer who has brought the three films, other than Shanghai Dreams, to the festival. But the Chinese audiences dont like to see social, realistic films. They want to see comedies, says Luisa. Chinese cinema is under evolution. The situation is still very difficult, due to two main reasons political censorship and the market.

 Censorship starts even before a film hits the floors. You have to show your script to the film board if you want to distribute it in China, and you will get to make it only if they approve. One can take a risk and make a film without showing the script to the censors, but if the content doesnt go with government policy the film wouldnt be allowed to be marketed in China. So, most of the films are distributed abroad, explains Luisa. 

 With the communist government tightening its grip over Chinese productions, Hollywood films are capturing the market. Its good that the Chinese people are getting to see a lot of American films, but it is affecting the production of local films, feels the programmer.

 Currently, the most populous country in the world produces a mere 155 films a year. Only 10-15 per cent of these get marketed, that too outside China. A lot of these film never get shown, rues Luisa.

 Alongside American films, Bollywood (which alone releases over 300 films a year). is also creating quite a buzz. You do get a lot of Satyajit Ray on DVDs, but its mostly commercial Bollywood films that people get to see from India.

 Investing in films, as a result, is a contentious issue in China. Private financing happens mostly for low-budget films, where individuals pool in money or get small companies to sponsor. The way out: co-productions, especially with the US and France.

 The film-watching culture in China is DVD-driven as the government-run halls have forbidding ticket rates. DVDs cost 10-15 times less than a hall ticket... Every new release comes out in DVD. Thats the only way to see films in China, says Lusia. 

 Postscript

 From China to Arunachal Pradesh. Film-maker Ahsan Muzid has come to the festival with Sonam, the only feature film to have been made in Monpa, a dialect in Arunachal Pradesh spoken along the Indo-Tibet border. Based on an Assamese novel, the film centres around polyandry in a community of Yak shepherds and how the age-old custom takes a toll on present-day inter-personal relationships. I have set the film in 1984 and focussed on what happens to a man who doesnt want to share his wife with others. This custom is related to the working pattern of their society, so that the cattle is not divided and because the number of women is very less, said Muzid, who started his career with the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA) in 1978.

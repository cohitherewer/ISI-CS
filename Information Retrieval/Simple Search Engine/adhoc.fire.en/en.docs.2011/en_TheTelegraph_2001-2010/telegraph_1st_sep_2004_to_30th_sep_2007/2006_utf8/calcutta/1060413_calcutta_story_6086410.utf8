 Mass housing debut in Rajarhat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 It?s an area where not too many developers have set foot before. Mass housing, hitherto confined to the lower-income group (LIG) units of the cross-subsidy, joint-sector model pioneered by the state housing board, is finally going to the masses on a scale that makes a difference.

 Mumbai-based realty major Shapoorji Pallonji amp; Co Ltd has announced its mass housing scheme for lower and middle-income groups in town. SP City, the Rs 1,500-crore project being developed by the company in Action Area III of New Town, Rajarhat, is spread across 150 acres and is scheduled to be completed by mid-2010.

 Shapoorji Pallonji edged out the other bidders ? the L amp;T-Simplex Consortium, Ahluwalia Contracts and the Nagarjuna Group ? in the Hidco project of 20,000 dwelling units. 

 SP City will have 12,000 one-BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) flats and 8,000 two-BHK flats with support facilities like two primary schools, corner stores, marketplace, shopping arcade, mini hospital and a child health check-up centre.

 ?We are very pleased to bring a mass housing complex of this scale for the lower and middle-income groups in West Bengal. A project of such magnitude is going to be a landmark development,? said Subir Dey, vice-president, Shapoorji Pallonji.

 Hidco had sought detailed expressions of interest from reputed developers/builders/ construction companies with ?adequate financial capability/resources? for the development and construction of the 20,000 LIG and MIG units in the proportion of 60:40.

 Ramkrishna Sharma, CEO, Shapoorji Pallonji, said: ?For us, Calcutta is a very important market. This mass housing venture will be the first of its kind in India and we look forward to developing many more such projects across the country.? 

 The company will provide post-commissioning maintenance (at nominal fees to each flat-owner) for the first year on completion of each phase.

 Singapore-based architects/consultants Surbana International will provide the ?comprehensive design solution? for the project and has laid ?special emphasis on creating open spaces for community use?. To add to the greenery, there will be a central waterbody and jogging tracks, toddlers? play area, community centres?

 The price of an LIG unit (built-up area around 400 sq ft) is not expected to exceed Rs 3 lakh and that of an MIG flat (built-up area around 600 sq ft) Rs 6 lakh. The Hidco guidelines also specify that the difference between the carpet area and built-up area of a flat must not exceed 20 per cent.

 ?Our vision is to create a township, a vibrant community with this mass housing complex. The primary objective behind Rajarhat was always decongesting Calcutta and this project should contribute significantly towards that,? felt Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathy.

 SP City promises to provide ?world-class living standards?, including pay-and-use facilities like a club (with swimming pools), besides facilities like sub-soil water recharging and solar power for street-lighting.

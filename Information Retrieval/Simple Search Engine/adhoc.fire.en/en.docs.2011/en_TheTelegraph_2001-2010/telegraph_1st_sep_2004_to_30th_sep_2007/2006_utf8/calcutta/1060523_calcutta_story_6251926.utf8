 What: 

 Fashion show to unveil Ken amp; Tony Collection by Van 

 Heusen. 

 Where: Van Heusen store at 9B, Wood Street. 

 When: Saturday afternoon.

 On the ramp: Hosted by model and grooming expert Nayanika Chatterjee, the show provided a glimpse of Ken amp; Tony, the latest offering by Van Heusen.

 Having invented the collar and the attached cuff way back in 1808, and stitched many other style statements since then, Van Heusen has now launched a new range to spice up mundane office wear. A palette that holds only three basic hues ? pink, blue and white ? along with all the counter-shades, of course, has indeed inspired a fresh line of clothes.

 The show on Saturday afternoon displayed four distinct lines. The opening sequence flaunted a range of casuals comprising T-shirts and cool trousers. Striped or solids with contrast detailing, these tees were teamed with relaxed trousers in baby pink, powder blue, white or beige.

 The second line was all about shirts, both casual printed and formal stripes. Turquoise or powder, bubble gum or baby ? shades of blue and pink were the only colours spotted here. The third collection showcased summer suits in linen.

 Why let the climate dictate our way of fashion, smiled Nayanika, as she introduced this cool collection of breath easy suits. Some self-textured, some striped and others solid colours, these suits were worn with contrast shirts.

 The final sequence was dedicated to volunteers amongst the crowd, who walked the ramp confidently in Van Heusens newest collection.

 Voiceover: This new collection is a deliberate effort to step away from the mundane black and grey associated with work wear. We wanted to look at an exciting palette to add a dash of glamour and colour while lending that cutting edge to the wearer, said Ram Narayan from Van Heusen.

 Love drapes

 What: Love at Exodus, a fashion show by the label Stae.

 Where: Bengal Rowing Club lawns. 

 When: Saturday evening, 8 pm onwards. 

 On the ramp: Designer duo Sudhir and Tapash of Stae showcased four different lines. The show kick-started with a splash of red and orange bridal wear and boasted exquisite embroidery in the form of zardosi, French knots and gota. Both heavy and lighter lehngas were seen. The next line comprised structured salwar kurtas. Mostly double layered, these suits combined various types of surface ornamentation like prints and embroideries.

 The third range was the sari ? both bridal and cocktail. The embellishment in this collection too was a melange of styles. The final sequence showcased a western line. Corsets, pleated skirts, sheath dresses were the highlights here.

 Voiceover: Love at Exodus draws inspiration from lovers, warriors and artistes. It is a synthesis of ancient, urban and rural elements, said the duo.

 Linen focus

 What: Saturday Night Fashion by Nextiles.

 Where: The poolside pub at Calcutta Swimming Club.

 When: Saturday night, 9 pm onwards. 

 On the ramp: City models Priyanka Kohli, Rusha, Ekta and Srabonee took the ramp to show off designer Suchismita Dasguptas latest collection, Tamara. 

 The first line showcased a mix of beachwear and club wear. Lots of pedal-pushers and short skirts in tweed and linen were teamed with sexy bikini tops and short ponchos. The colour palette revolved around olive, white, beige and rust. 

 The second collection of morning wear boasted long skirts, both flowy as well as straight cuts, worn with short blouses and accessorised with summer hats and scarves. The linen used here was specially woven.

 The third line comprising eveningwear was a mix of interesting dhoti trousers and regular fits in black, red and beige. Combined with summer jackets and cool spaghetti tops, the style quotient was upped by innovative drapes on the head.

 The final round showcased saris in earthy hues of cream, orange and beige. Embellished with hand embroidery, the saris are ideal for a summer night out.

 Voiceover: Linen is one of the oldest and most comfortable fabrics ever, so theres nothing quite like a great linen outfit ? both to hang around all day and party hard all night, smiled Suchismita.

 Pageant pick

 What: May Queen 2006.

 Where: Dalhousie Institute.

 When: Saturday evening, 8.30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: With the club lawns flooded due to heavy showers on Saturday evening, seating arrangement for the audience had to be made indoors, pushing back the event by almost two hours.

 The evening kicked off with a fashion show displaying creations by designer Arnab Sengupta. Models Tanushree, Ishika and Pamela showcased drapes in raw silk, georgettes and cotton embellished with illustrations that drew inspiration from Persian and Indo-Turkish art forms. 

 Intricate jafri, meenakari, zardosi, aari, French knots and kantha work added to the vintage feel. The fashion show was followed by a captivating dance performance involving children of DI members.

 Then, the event that everyone was waiting for: May Queen 2006. Fourteen participants in the age group of 16 to 24 were judged by veteran educationist Neil Brien, model-turned-painter Piu Sarkar, beauty expert June Tomkyns, jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty and model Robin Corner Jr. Nicola Gomes was in charge of choreography.

 The first round had participants clad in denims introducing themselves. The beachwear round saw the contestants sashaying colourful swimsuits. Marigolds tucked into tresses and sarongs tied round the waist accentuated the beach look. Seven girls were shortlisted for the finals.

 For the final question-answer round, the judges grilled the finalists. What would you do if Rahul Gandhi were to propose to you? drew a confident I would say no from a contestant. And the answer to How does a woman survive in a mans world? drew loud applause as the young contestant said, With love, patience and the intelligence to handle situations well.

 After what seemed to be a harrowing task, the judges decided the winners. The May Queen 2006 title was bagged by Vanisha Panchanathan. Sheena Dutta and Stacy Johans bagged the first runner-up and second runner-up positions.

 The Miss Beautiful Hair title was won by Yamini. Raji walked away with the Miss Beautiful Skin title. For Miss Beautiful Smile, it was Stacy Johans again.

 The contest was punctuated by fashion sequences showing designer Bobby Sens creations. The evening was wrapped up with performances by band Shiva and DJ Toni.

 Voiceover: Such an 

 event is a platform for young ladies who aspire to win beauty 

 pageants at the national and international level, 

 smiled Denise Smith, council member in-charge of entertainment 

 at DI.

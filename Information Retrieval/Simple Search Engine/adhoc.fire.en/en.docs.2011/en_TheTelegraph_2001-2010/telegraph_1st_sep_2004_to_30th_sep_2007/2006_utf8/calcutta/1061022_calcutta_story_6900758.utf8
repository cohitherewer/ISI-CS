The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A human story across seven seas

At the end of a seven-day shoot in Calcutta, Sarah 

Gavron looked drained as she settled down for a chat at the ITC Sonar Bangla on 

Friday evening. Monica Alis Brick Lane has brought her to the city to 

shoot the childhood sections of the novel based in Bangladesh, playing it safe 

after the filming in Londons Brick Lane drew a flurry of protests disrupting 

the shoot this August.

I went to Bangladesh a few times and found it was 

a beautiful country with a fascinating culture. The land, of course, has similarities 

with Bengal. But we decided not to shoot in Bangladesh keeping in mind the political 

sensitivities of the novel, admits Sarah, sipping on some black tea.

So, Bantala, a village off the EM Bypass, turned into 

make-belief Mymensingh, complete with a marketplace, pond and paddy fields. 

While the city was drenched by heavy showers, Bantala remained dry. It rained 

the day we had a rain sequence, so we didnt have to use artificial showers, 

laughs Sarah.

The film (a British production, working title Seven 

Seas) starts in 2001 though the novel begins in the Eighties and reconstructs 

the back-story through flashbacks. The process of editing is a process of reducing, 

and we wanted to capture the essence of childhood. We had many drafts of the script. 

In the early stages we were concerned with covering a lot more background, in 

terms of time. My approach has been to capture the spirit of the book because 

you cant keep everything in less than two hours. Now, we have a smaller time 

span A book has more licence to meander. In the film, you have to be very linear, 

explains Sarah, who has made shorts and a feature-length film for television before 

moving to this, her first major celluloid project. 

The company that bought the rights of Monica Alis 

novel had approached Sarah to direct the film. Having read and liked the book, 

Sarah decided to take it up. I liked Brick Lane because it is a human 

story and it resonates with people across cultures and generations. The story 

is more about a woman than a community... Contemporary social issues form the 

backdrop.

Abbey Morgan and Laura Jones have written the script. 

Monica Ali has been very supportive, but from a distance. She didnt feel she 

needed to be involved with the writing, says Sarah. 

Having streamlined the story, Sarah and her team met 

a host of actors, both in India and the UK, for lead characters Nazneen, her husband 

Chanu and her lover Karim.

For Nazneen, we wanted someone who had the look, 

age and qualities that suited the character. Tannishtha (Chatterjee) had a great 

grasp of the story. She captured the character extremely well and contributed 

far beyond the call of duty... It was harder to find Chanu (played by Satish Kaushik), 

someone who had the right look, acting capabilities in English and a sense of 

comedy. Because Chanu is a tragic hero and not a stereotype at all. He is infuriating 

yet sympathetic and gentle. British actor Christopher Simpson plays Karim.

The Calcutta shoot had kicked off in the midst of 

mild confusion. It was a bigger team than I am used to. The structure was different 

but we found a way out together, smiles Sarah. The tight schedule has left her 

with little time to explore the city. 

I wanted to visit the museum and walk the streets, 

she rues. For the time being, Calcutta for her means Bantala and a bit of Park 

Street, New Market and Kalighat.

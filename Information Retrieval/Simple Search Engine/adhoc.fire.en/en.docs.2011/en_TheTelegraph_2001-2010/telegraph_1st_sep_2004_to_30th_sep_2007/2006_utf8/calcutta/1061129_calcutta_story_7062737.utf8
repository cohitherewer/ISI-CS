 Dresses, dresses and more dresses 

 dominate the latest collection of Delhi-based designer Aparna 

 Chandra to be unveiled at the Stylefile Winter Show 2006. 

 The fashion gala at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers 

 on Saturday evening will be hosted with The Telegraph 

 as media partner. 

 My collection is all about 

 dresses and I have played around with various shapes, 

 the designer tells GoodLife from Delhi.

 While the shapes are varied, the 

 length stops just below the knee in most cases, with a few 

 shorter variations as well. Just-below-the-knee is 

 the length in fashion right now, she adds. 

 I have always done a lot 

 of bubbles and hence there will be some of them, too, 

 promises Aparna. 

 The look is soft and feminine 

 and the all-western line is also made up of separates like 

 jackets, skirts, tops and culottes.

 The high point of the collection 

 is the combination of various fabrics. Aparna admits that 

 she loves to fuse fabrics and she has combined 

 cottons, silks, nets, organzas, brocades and more. The palette 

 is restricted to striking creams, blacks and reds.

 The line offers outfits for both 

 winter and the next spring-summer. In India we hardly 

 have a strong winter except in the north. So, theres 

 hardly much distinction between winter and summer clothes. 

 The collection comprises garments that can be worn in summer 

 as well as in winter with jackets thrown over them, 

 explains Aparna.

 Our collection for Stylefile 

 is basically mens wear, dedicated to the youthful 

 yuvraj, reflecting the decadent past glory of royal 

 India, say Shantanu and Nikhil, who had worked their 

 magic on Amitabh Bachchan, no less, for his second innings 

 of Kaun Banega Crorepati.

 The hedonistic and sensual 

 young Maharajas with their ambiguous sexuality and dandy 

 ways captured the imagination of an entire generation. We 

 take a peek into their libertine and ultra-sensual lifestyle, 

 and bring their sophistication to life on the ramp, 

 they explain.

 Attention to detail and the element 

 of femininity mark each ensemble. The collection fuses traditional 

 Indian regality with contemporary nuances.

 Fitted sherwanis, short 

 jackets, ultra-feminine tops, delicate drapes and kurtas 

 form the bulk of the line.

 There is also a womens wear 

 line of vintage saris from the Forties. The look is elegant 

 and sensual, with colours like chocolate brown, gold and 

 lavender ruling. The fabrics add to the sensuality with 

 chiffons and velvets. The silhouettes are innovative and 

 romantic.

 New courses and more students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A slew of new courses and a 50 per cent hike in the student-intake capacity are among the highlights of a revamp scheme for Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), that will mark 150 years of the institutions existence.

 The university will celebrate its 150th foundation day on Friday. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Choudhury will attend the programme.

 The state government has sanctioned Rs 17 crore for the proposed revamp, vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea said on Tuesday. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has urged the Centre to sanction another Rs 46.30 crore.

 Ex-students of the university settled abroad have promised to raise $1 million.

 One of the most significant plans of the university is to increase its student intake by nearly 50 per cent, an official said. Besides, Besu will tie up with reputed institutions of the country, including the IITs, to carry out collaborative research and other academic activities.

 In order to provide enough engineers to the automobile units that are likely to come up in the next few years, the university has planned to set up a centre of excellence in automobile engineering studies.

 Besu also unveiled plans to introduce a series of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The undergraduate courses will be in food technology and nutrition, occupational health and safety engineering, and chemical engineering and biotechnology.

 The postgraduate courses will be in power electronics, nano-technology, disaster mitigation and research, robotics and megatronics and development studies. The postgraduate courses are slated to begin in the next academic session. 

 The university has also undertaken plans to beautify the campus and construct a modernised power distribution system for uninterrupted supply on the campus. 

 A water-treatment plant is also on the anvil. 

 Construction of students hostels and renovation of heritage structures on the campus are the other highlights of the revamp scheme.

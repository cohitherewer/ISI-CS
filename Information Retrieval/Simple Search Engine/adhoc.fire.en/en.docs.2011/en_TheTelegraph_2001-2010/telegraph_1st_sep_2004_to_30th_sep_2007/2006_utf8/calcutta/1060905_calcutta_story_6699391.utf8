 Sunday afternoon. The curtains go up on the Star theatre screen even as a Trinamul Congress contingent blocks Bidhan Sarani and protests film shows at the privatised stage address.

 Monday afternoon. Stars from tinsel town take a page out of Trinamuls book of protest, staging a sit-in at Esplanade to oppose the privatisation of Technicians Studio, which they fear could spell doom for the Tollygunge shooting site.

 The common protest point (after-effects of privatisation) and the common protest pitch (on the streets, in your face) united two key addresses of stage and screen, at two ends of town.

 If at Star, a political outfit is protesting the commercialisation rather than the privatisation of the 126-year-old heritage stage, the governments move to call a tender and hand over Technicians Studio to a private player has triggered fear in Tollywood of commercialisation, leading to the 70-year-old address being razed to make way for highrises.

 Artistes Forum secretary Prosenjit said: We are not against privatisation, but we want to safeguard the interests of the shooting floor. The government hasnt mentioned the clause of upgrading Technicians in the tender After this sit-in, I think the government will call us for talks soon.

 Tollywoods top gun had Ray hero Soumitra Chatterjee by his side as actors and technicians squatted at Esplanade to let the common people know about the crisis at the state-run studio.

 The government will have to guarantee that the floors will not be used for anything apart from shooting purposes, said Artistes Forum chairman Soumitra, flanked by Sandip Ray and Tapas Pal, Biplab Chatterjee and Jisshu Sengupta.

 Amidst songs and poems of protest, Pronab Chowdhury, secretary, Eastern India Cinetel Welfare Trust, explained the crux of contention: In 2004, the government had decided to set up two new floors at Technicians, and a blueprint had been drawn up. But the government has backtracked; it passed a tender on August 10 to privatise Technicians without holding any talks with the artistes and technicians.

 Information and culture secretary Dilip Chakraborty made the official position clear: Its not the governments job to make movies or be involved in this business. Hence, we invited expressions of interest from private parties to rebuild, modernise and run Technicians.

 The Merlin Group, Zee Telefilms and Bengal Unitech have bought tender papers so far, said Chakraborty, adding that the last date for submitting bids is September 20.

 The chants of protest from the artistes corner at Esplanade may have carried to Writers Buildings above the Monday traffic din, but on Sunday evening, the stray voices of protest from the political platform outside Star theatre could not invade the revamped 514-seater hall screening Patalghar.

 If the Dolby digital sound didnt drown them out, the cheers and claps from the audience, sparse but satisfied, sure did. The pushback seats, the air-conditioned comfort, the giant screen and the crystal-clear picture quality meant a clear mandate for movies.

 This is the best cinema hall in north Calcutta. Now, we wont have to go south to catch a film, said Niloy Agambagis, a student of Rabindra Bharati University.

 To boost Stars new identity, Priya Entertainment which took over Star from the CMC in a public-private partnership is planning to hold a festival of Uttam Kumar films. We intend to screen critically-acclaimed films and semi-classics in keeping with the character of the hall, stressed Arijit Dutta of Priya Entertainment.

 Unish Kuri 

 Streax Glam Hunt '06

 Finalists of the 

 Unish Kuri Streax Glam Hunt 06;

 Modelling seems to hold quite 

 a glamorous position when it comes to career choices among 

 todays youth. How else can you explain an overwhelming, 

 more-than-2,000 entries response to Unish Kuri 

 Streax Glam Hunt 06 that rolled out its first campaign 

 less than a month ago?

 Organised by popular teen magazine 

 Unish Kuri, the event happens to be the first 

 ever model hunt for guys and girls in the east.

 Unish Kuri Streax Glam 

 Hunt 06 was unveiled on Tuesday afternoon and the 

 day also saw the first round of elimination. Quite a hefty 

 one at that. The judges task was tough: short-listing 

 10 finalists (five boys and five girls) from a crowd of 

 54 aspirants.

 In the hot seat were fashion designer 

 Abhishek Dutta, model Devdutta, actress Rimjhim Mitra and 

 photographer Dhiman Ghosh.

 The aspirants portfolios 

 were varied ? a few businessmen, some working professionals, 

 many amateur models and, of course, the student brigade. 

 But this 16-25 bracket shares a common passion. The passion 

 to make it big ? as big as it gets ? in the cut-throat modelling 

 arena.

In an industry where girls 

 invariably manage to get an extra edge, this model hunt 

 will be different. It is all set to create two top models 

 ? a boy and a girl, said a spokesperson for the magazine. 

 Interestingly, the girl-guy ratio 

 in the 2,000 entries favoured the guys and the participants 

 were clearly excited about it. Rahul Arora, a 19-year-old 

 finalist, said: Girls always have it easier as models; 

 more exposure and more money. But this platform should be 

 equal for us guys. 

 Reasons to take part in the glam 

 hunt are many. While some want to make it to the Miss India 

 finals, others want the right break in the modelling 

 industry. Finalist Sweety Singh, 22, said: I have 

 always wanted to be a model and I hope this hunt turns things 

 around for me. 

 The hunt focuses on beauty and 

 attitude over all else, so the wannabes need not rehearse 

 Mother Teresa-type lines. Our priority will be body 

 language, carriage and presence. Many good-lookers with 

 great modelling potential lose out in beauty pageants. This 

 glamour hunt is purely in search of glamour, explained 

 the Unish Kuri spokesperson.

 The four judges seemed impressed 

 with the standard of the contestants, but how did they fare 

 in their task for the day? While designer Abhishek declared 

 that he is open to doing photo shoots with the contestants, 

 he did admit that judging a model hunt wasnt easy. 

 I was purely looking for the glam quotient, not IQ, 

 he said. 

 Actress Rimjhim was depressed 

 that so many geared-up contestants were eliminated 

 and model Devdutta was relieved to see many potential 

 models. 

 I am basically looking at 

 the photogenic factor, something that sharp features mostly 

 determine, said Dhiman. 

 The 10 finalists who will vie 

 for the titles on August 19 at Hotel Hindusthan International 

 are Arpita Mukherjee, Sumeeta Swain, Priya Ghoshal, Sweety 

 Singh and Lovely Kaur; Rahul Arora, Nirak Biyala, Shabbir 

 Khan, Arka Paul and Siddharth Dugar.

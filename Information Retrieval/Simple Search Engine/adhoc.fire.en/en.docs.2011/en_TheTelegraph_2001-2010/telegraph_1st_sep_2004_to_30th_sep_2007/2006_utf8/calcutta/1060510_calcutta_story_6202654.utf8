 Barnaparichoy, the proposed book mall on College Street, is set to be better and bigger.

 ?There has been some change in the original design, though the concept remains the same. We have decided to add a floor, making the structure G+7,? said Samar Nag, managing director of Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd, the joint-sector company with Bengal Housing Board that is developing the mall.

 The usual add-ons will not be missing, either. A four-screen, 1,100-seater multiplex, a food court and a pub will sit pretty along with book shops.

 The dedicated space for the book mall will house a reading room, library, seminar hall and a book auction centre, among other facilities.

 The developers have roped in two of the best names in the construction industry for the project. 

 While celebrated architect Hafeez Contractor will provide the design solution, Shapoorji Pallonji amp; Co Ltd is likely to take up construction work.

 Contractor is now giving final touches to the design, which will bear resemblance to the existing Indo-Saracenic architecture of the College Street market. Indo-Saracenic was a style employed by the late 19th Century British architects in India. 

 A blend of traditional Hindu and Islamic architecture with Gothic revival favoured in Victorian England, the form finds expression in Gateway of India (Mumbai) and Victoria Memorial.

 Nag said construction will start after Diwali, following the relocation of existing stall-owners at the nearby Marcus Square. National and international players ? including Penguin and Orient Longman ? have shown interest in booking space in the Rs 250-crore project.

 ?We will make a presentation at the Frankfurt Book Fair in September and will also attend a meet in Oxford in June to attract international publishers and booksellers,? Nag said.

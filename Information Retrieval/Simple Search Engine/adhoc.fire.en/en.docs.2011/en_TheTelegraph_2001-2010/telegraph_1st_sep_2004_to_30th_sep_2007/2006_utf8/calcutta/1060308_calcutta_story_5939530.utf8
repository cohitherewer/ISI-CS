 Local shock, motive hunt after cruel end for noble doctor 

 Cops sniff refusal of messy case 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Why did a popular doctor, who treated many poor patients and was always eager to help anyone in distress, have to meet with such a cruel end?

 The police were grappling with the question till late on Tuesday in their efforts to come up with a plausible reason for the gruesome murder of Jayanta Ghosh.

 After talking to patients who were in his chamber on Raja Manindra Road, in north Calcutta, on Monday afternoon and some residents of the area, officers felt ?inclined? to believe that an unidentified gang had tried to force the doctor to take up a ?messy? case and he had to pay with his life for refusing.

 The sleuths have gathered that two people had turned up at the chamber around 1 pm on Monday. Only a couple of patients was present then. According to the version of the local residents who were hanging around, the two, in their 40s, had arrived in a Maruti, with a driver at the wheel.

 They parked the car at a distance, walked up to the chamber and waited a while ? probably they wanted the chamber to be empty before interacting with Ghosh. 

 But their patience seemed to have worn out soon and they barged in, even though a woman patient was waiting for her turn.

 Ghosh probably knew at least one of the intruders, who addressed him as Jayantada.

 They talked for some time ? the two informing the doctor about a patient in distress ? and asked him to accompany them. Ghosh told the only patient left that he would be back ?in a few minutes?.

 Obviously, he had been told that he was being taken somewhere nearby. He followed the two to the car and sat on the rear seat, in the middle. He was never seen thereafter.

 Police believe Ghosh was asked to attend to a ?messy gynaecological? case, which he refused to take up. A general practitioner, Ghosh had a diploma in gynaecology.

 ?This possibility cannot be ruled out, especially in view of the findings of a preliminary probe,? said an officer working on the case. 

 ?Possibly, those who had gone to the chamber did not expect that Ghosh would refuse the case. The fact that he knew the people may have compromised their position, and this prompted them to finish him off. But the theory is still tenuous and we are continuing our probe,? he added.

 Ghosh?s brother, Prasanta, also a doctor, did not debunk the theory, but said the real motive could be ransom. 

 A ransom call had come at 8.30 am on Tuesday, asking for Rs 2 lakh. The delay in paying up the money might have prompted the abductors to kill him, he said.

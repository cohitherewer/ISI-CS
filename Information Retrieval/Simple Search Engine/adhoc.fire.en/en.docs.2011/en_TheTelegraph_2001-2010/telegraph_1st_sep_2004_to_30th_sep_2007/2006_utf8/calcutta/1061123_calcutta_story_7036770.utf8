The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Response cheers Rajasthan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta is playing host to a business delegation from Rajasthan. The team is in the city for two days and will meet all leading businessmen. 

 The first day brought in queries about possibilities of investment in sectors like education, IT and tourism infrastructure, especially in hotels, malls and convention centres. The delegation has also shown interest in cement, power and textile sectors.

 We have got a good response on the first day. This is quite encouraging and we are expecting more from this region, said Purushottam Agarwal, industry secretary of Rajasthan.

 Industry minister Narpat Singh Rajvi laid stress on developing strong cultural ties with Bengal. With our craftsmanship and the technology here, we can create magic. We want the people to know about the prospects in Rajasthan and what all we can offer. 

 On the first day, entrepreneurs from the city acquired nine plots in Rajasthan, three in Bhilwara and six in Ratangar. 

 The delegation has already visited Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai, and is considering an overseas visit to draw investors from New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore and some European countries where Rajasthan already has a presence.

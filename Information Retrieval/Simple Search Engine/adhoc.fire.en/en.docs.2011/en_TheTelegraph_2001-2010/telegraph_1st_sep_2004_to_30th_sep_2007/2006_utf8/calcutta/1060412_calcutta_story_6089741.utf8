The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 On my recent visit to a roadside food joint in south Calcutta, 

 I was shocked to see some brown particles floating inside 

 the soda bottle served to me. When I raised an alarm, the 

 waiter at once changed the bottle without any arguments 

 or altercations. The shopkeeper then requested me not to 

 spread the word and agreed to refund my money. This is a 

 serious health issue. Such incidents indicate how carelessly 

 soft drinks are being manufactured. Consumption of such 

 drinks may lead to health problems like food poisoning and 

 other digestive disorders. I request the civic authorities 

 to look into the matter and take steps to stop such menace.

 Cellular service providers may have launched STD calls 

 at Re 1, but I have noticed that they charge more than that 

 per call. I think they should stop luring the public with 

 their ?non-existing? plans and advertise honestly and clearly.

 Recently, while purchasing a Metro ticket, the man at the 

 counter asked me to pay the exact amount. I gave him four 

 25 paise coins along with other coins. The collector refused 

 to accept the 25 paise coins and said the coins were not 

 in use any more. When I argued that the coins were being 

 used by the bus conductors and even by shopkeepers, he told 

 me to pay up or leave the place. I want to know whether 

 the Metro railway authorities have some special rules of 

 currency usage.

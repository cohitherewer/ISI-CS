The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Sting and Asha Parekh 

 You are always mentally and emotionally busy, as you have goals and promises to keep. A positive environment works wonders for your soul, though too much work and competition can push you to the sidelines. You are approachable, adaptable and rarely demanding. With your effortless charm, you stand out in contrast to those who struggle for centre stage.

Life

 Get set

 Looking your gorgeous best within 

 a deadline needs no magic potion. Shradha Agarwal finds some 

 timely tricks.

 Did you know that some ramp models 

 live off only orange juice and maybe four-five nuts 

 the day before a big show? Or that Raveena Tandon went on 

 a pure popcorn diet for the pole dance in Aks? Or 

 that Kareena Kapoor fasted furiously for three days before 

 shooting a song sequence for Mujhse Dosti Karoge, just 

 so that her stomach would look washboard-flat in an itsy-bitsy 

 red choli?

 Looking your gorgeous best on 

 every occasion sure isnt an easy job. The pressures 

 before the numerous D-Days a super-hot date, a bikini 

 holiday by the beach, your best friends engagement... 

 make you pray for a magic potion that transforms your 

 look at the last minute.

 Well, GoodLife gets some 

 experts Getafix, sadly, could not be reached to share 

 some trade secrets to get you gorgeous even at the last 

 minute. Heres how to get ready within a tight timeframe 

 seven days, two days, or even with hours in hand.

 One day to go

 Diet do

 Single-day makeovers dont 

 permit a breakfast, lunch and dinner spread, but little 

 sips and bites through the day can keep you going. So fuel 

 yourself all day with energy-releasing drinks like wheat-grass 

 juice and alpha-alpha juice and munch on five almonds. Sprouts 

 are permitted while gorging on fresh fruits to fill up your 

 stomach does just fine. These will bring vitality, too.

 so, keep sipping on jasmine tea 

 or peppermint tea. These will help cut down water 

 retention and make you feel light, says Delhi-based 

 nutritionist Shikha Sharma.

 Work it

 Swimming, says fitness guru Preetom 

 Mukherjee Roy, is the sure shot feel-good workout 

 for any big day. This refreshing exercise gives you 

 a great cardio session and the increased blood circulation 

 lends your face a happy glow.

 Follow up with a quick five-minute 

 session in the jacuzzi and finish off with steam.

 For non-water babies, schedule 

 a power-walk outdoors and feel the endorphins take over.

Beauty buzz 

 For starters, says beauty expert 

 Bridgette Jones, select your outfit the night before, even 

 if it means trying 20 outfits in the dead of the night after 

 a long, hard day.

 Try and snooze during the day 

 and in the evening drop in to your neighbourhood salon for 

 a flattering hairstyle poker straight, scrunched, curled, 

 blow-dried whatever you know looks best on you.

 Ditto for make-up. One day isnt 

 the smartest time frame to experiment with your looks, so 

 no last-minute facials (for risk of a nasty reaction) or 

 haircuts, please. 

 Finally, indulge in a luxuriously 

 fragrant bath because being beautiful isnt just 

 about how you look; its about how you feel. 

 And yes, a great smile is your 

 most dependable tool last minute or not! 

 Two days to go

 Diet do 

 On the first day, stick to brown 

 rice idli or poha and feast on vegetable juices 

 and soups. On the second day, follow the one day to 

 go diet chart. Steer clear of refined foods and dairy 

 products these two days. Watching what you eat for any two 

 days is obviously not going to make you lose weight but 

 will surely rid your system of puffiness and excess water.

 Work it

 On the first day, go to the park 

 for a long walk and then follow up with some freehand exercises. 

 Focus on TAG (thigh, abdomen and gut). Some exercises that 

 will work them well are abdomen-crunches, hip rolls and 

 side-leg extensions. 

 On Day Two, hit the swimming pool 

 and top up with some toning exercises this time in the 

 water. Use the waters resistance and do some freehand 

 exercises like jogging and abductions. Take support from 

 the railing and do a few sets of rear leg extensions and 

 leg extensions to complete the aqua workout.

 Beauty buzz

 Schedule a hair spa appointment 

 on the first day or even a colouring job, not as much for 

 the colour as for the gloss. And while you are at the salon, 

 treat yourself to a manicure and a pedicure.

 On the second day, concentrate 

 on relaxing. Keep yourself free from salon appointments 

 and indulge in a home massage. Try olive oil with a drop 

 of lavender essential oil. Exfoliate your body with a grainy 

 scrub and moisturise generously and get ready for the big 

 day.

 Concentrate on feeling good and 

 youll end up looking even better! 

 Seven days to go 

 Diet do 

 Seven days of strictly eating 

 the right food can have far-reaching visual results, 

 says Shikha. This plan, however, is not about starvation. 

 Instead, it shows how small lifestyle changes can help keep 

 the bulge at bay. The key: avoid white rice, flour and semolina.

 Begin your day with a glass of 

 wheat-grass juice and any cereal-based breakfast like porridge 

 or poha. For lunch, have a regular meal of rotis, 

 vegetables or meat and curd. Dinner time is what really 

 requires some dietary changes skip the cereal and fill 

 up on steamed vegetables, grilled chicken or fish.

 This seven-day plan has 

 sufficient minerals and vitamins, assures Shikha. 

 Work it

 Nobody can lose any weight 

 during the first seven days of a workout schedule but yes, 

 one cant rule out the feel-good factor. And who knows, 

 maybe someone with a decent fitness level can show some 

 difference on the scale, says Preetom.

 A seven-day workout plan, he says, 

 should focus on TAG and ideally be a light circuit-training 

 programme. Mix cardio, weight training, resistance training 

 and some freehand exercises involving all the muscle groups 

 and repeat the sets.

 For example, do one set each of 

 tricep, bicep, shoulder and hip exercises combined with 

 bouts of cardio thrown in between. 

 Beauty buzz 

 Target to achieve a clear and 

 glowing complexion. Not that difficult, since skin keeps 

 renewing itself. Bridgette suggests you start by drinking 

 more water. Basic skin care is also a must, so make sure 

 you cleanse, tone and moisturise morning and night. 

 Seven days are quite a handful 

 so there is no end to real-time pampering. Treat yourself 

 to a rejuvenating skin brightening facial to beat environmental 

 stress, business pressure, illness or lack of sleep. 

 Rethink your make-up strategy 

 and learn and practise what suits you best. Incorporate 

 your day one and two plans and feel nothing short of a superstar.

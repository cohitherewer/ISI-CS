The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bend rules, at bourse and jail

 - Stock scamster, cop escort flout travel-stay norm

 KINSUK BASU 

 How does a police officer produce an accused in court in another city? He travels with the accused and his family in a first-class AC coach of a train and puts up with them at a five-star hotel before taking him to court.

 Thats what a sergeant of the Reserve Force of Calcutta Police did. The accused in question is Dinesh Dalmiya, an alleged mastermind of the Rs 120-crore Calcutta Stock Exchange scam, busted in 2001. He was granted bail in the Calcutta case last week, but was wanted in Chennai.

 The sergeant, along with three constables, escorted Dalmiya, his wife and their son to Chennai by the AC first class of the 6003 Up Chennai Mail, on Saturday. On Monday, the sergeant, Dalmiya and his family checked into a five-star hotel in Chennai. Hours later, Dalmiya was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.

 Going by the book, tickets for Dalmiya and the cops had been reserved in an AC second-class compartment. But the sergeant, Dalmiya and his family upgraded to the comforts of first class, the police brass has learnt. Also, the rulebook states that the sergeant should have taken Dalmiya to a police station (not a hotel) and kept him there till court production.

 This is the latest instance of Dinesh Dalmiya having his way, from the markets to the jailhouse. Calcutta Police had filed a chargesheet on June 8, 2006, against the managing director of DSQ Software and DSQ Industries. But an investigation carried out by the Enforcement Directorate has revealed that Dalmiya is active in the security market through several of his front companies, despite a 10-year ban imposed on him by Sebi, with a penalty of Rs 600 crore.

 Sources said Dalmiya would bend the rules at will even when he was in custody. He even managed to meet business associates and manipulate the market.

 Senior officers of city police learnt about the travel-and-stay rule flout soon after the group reached Chennai. The PNR number of the upgraded ticket, the coach number and other details were obtained and commissioner Prasun Mukherjee was briefed. He has asked for a report.

 The team is yet to return. Well surely look into the matter, said detective chief Gyanwant Singh.

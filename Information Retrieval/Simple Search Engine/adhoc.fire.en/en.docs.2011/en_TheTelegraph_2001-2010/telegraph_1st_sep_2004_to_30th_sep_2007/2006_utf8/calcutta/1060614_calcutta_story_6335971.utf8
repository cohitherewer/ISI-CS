 With the soccer extravaganza on, heres your chance to cheer your favourite 11 with your pals in a sporty ambience while you down a drink or two. Step into the Starstruck Sports Zone at Forum, the only true blue sports bar in the city, which opened its doors on Friday.

 The launch of the 60-seater sports bar was well timed on the kick-off day of the World Cup. The sporty atmosphere has been cleverly crafted ? plush sofas resembling giant footballs, waiters donning F1 uniforms and walls decorated with sports memorabilia and photographs.

 We have managed Winning Streak earlier and it was a hit with the Calcutta crowd. With the Starstruck Sports Zone, we expect to spin more magic with the sport-loving crowd, says proprietor Bunty Sethi.

 While you catch the action on the large screen that gives the same viewing pleasure from every corner of the bar, you can choose from a wide array of beverages ? cocktails, mocktails, beers, vodkas and Moet, Chardonnay, Sula and Chantilli, among wines. 

 If you choose to stay away from the alcoholic variety, you can sip a soft drink or a fresh juice. Theres enough to munch on while you stay glued to the screen. While you can take your pick from Lamb Chops or the traditional Fish and Chips, there is a combo meal (Rs 275 for vegetarian and Rs 285 for non-vegetarian) on offer as well.

 We have tied up with ESPN Star Sports for a direct feed to the screen. Whenever theres an important match, the music will give way to the live commentary, adds Bunty. 

 When there is no action on the screen, a table each for pool and foosball can keep you entertained.

 As the World Cup progresses, there are plans to throw open the adjoining restaurant area and merge it with the lounge by setting up another giant screen. This will allow nearly 200 people to watch the matches together. 

 Cheerleaders, balloon drops, football anthems, memorabilia, jerseys and other giveaways will pep up the mood. There are exciting offers on Fosters and Heineken and beverage pitchers, too.

 Open from 11 am to 2 am, theres a cover charge of Rs 300 per head on all match days during the World Cup. You can book in advance during this time.

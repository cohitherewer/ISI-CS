 After facing hurdles for a decade, the much-hyped parking plaza under Laldighi, at BBD Bag, is set to sail through.

 ?We have floated a tender for the contract of the Rs 36-crore project and expect to complete the formalities in a month. Work will, hopefully, start in August and be completed by the end of 2008,?? public works department (PWD) minister Kshiti Goswami told Metro.

 At least a month will be needed to select the contractor, obtain clearance from the pollution control board and chalk out a traffic movement plan in the BBD Bag area for the duration of the construction work, said PWD officials.

 ?We had earlier planned to implement the project with the help of private companies. But the conditions set by some of them were unacceptable. We will construct the parking plaza by putting in money from the government coffers,? added Goswami.

 According to the plan, the two-storeyed parking plaza will accommodate 700 cars, half of them government-owned. The rest of the space will be reserved for private cars.

 The cars are currently parked on the banks of Laldighi. A park with lots of greenery and fountains will come up there. Several ornamental plants and Australian grass will be used to do up the park. The water of the lake will be purified and treated.

 Once the underground parking plaza becomes operational, no car will be allowed to park within 200 m of Laldighi.

 Great Eastern Hotel and Coal India have expressed interest in buying parking space for 200 cars. ?They will make an annual payment. We did not give them any assurance on how much space we can provide. The money collected from selling parking space will be utilised to maintain the plaza. There is almost no scope of income from the plaza as parking fee cannot be collected from government vehicles,?? explained the minister.

 The pollution control board has sought a report from the PWD on the environmental impact of the project and the plan for re-planting trees. According to the department engineers, at least 30 mature trees will have to be uprooted for the project.

 ?Felling so many big trees will have an adverse impact on the environment, but it has to be realised that the construction of the parking plaza is a necessity,? said Goswami.

 ?After the underground parking plaza is built, the pollution level in the zone will come down. We will plant at least 200 trees in the area. We have already expressed our views to the environment panel and expect a nod,? he stressed.

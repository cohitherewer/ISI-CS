 Rajarhat township: Make way for a Maidan. A Telegraph picture

 Drawing a parallel with the Maidan in Calcutta and Central Park in Salt Lake, the state forest department is drawing up a plan for a 100-acre nature park in New Town.

 The department is preparing a proposal to be submitted to the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), implementing agency of the Rajarhat township, for handing over a chunk of green.

 But the park could well remain a pipedream if Hidco chooses not to part with land in a township where an acre fetches crores.

 The park will serve as the lungs of the township, said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban forestry). Were putting final touches to the proposal and will submit it at the earliest.

 The forest department wants the park to come up in the centre of the township, but has left it to Hidco to decide which plot it would like to hand over. Our primary objective behind setting up the park is to maintain the ecological balance. So, we are looking for an area with a waterbody, where small aquatic animals will be raised, Mukherjee said.

 The park will cost around Rs 10 crore and will take five to seven years to be ready. Apart from trees, the park will have a joggers track, fountains and angling facilities.

 The park will serve the twin objectives of beautifying the township and acquainting visitors with various types of flora, Mukherjee added.

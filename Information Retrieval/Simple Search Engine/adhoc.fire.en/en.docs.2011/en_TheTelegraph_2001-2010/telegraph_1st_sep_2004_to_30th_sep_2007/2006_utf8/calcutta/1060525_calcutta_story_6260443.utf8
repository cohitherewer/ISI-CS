 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to go ahead with its decision to recover about 200 bighas of prime land for ?development? from quarters occupied by municipality labourers. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya?s proposal to recover the land from ?sweepers? colonies? was unanimously passed by the mayoral council last week. The CMC plans to convert the land ?left over? after rehabilitating the labourers into shopping and entertainment zones. 

 The decision was taken following a survey, titled Status of CMC Labour Quarters, undertaken by CMC consultant Samar Kumar Mitra. The first survey on CMC labour quarters showed that 22,000 families stay in the labour quarters in 134 city pockets and of them, only 15,000 are civic employees? families. There is no labour quarters under boroughs XII and XIII, in Garden Reach.

 The quarters are spread over 260 bighas, worth Rs 520 crore. A preliminary estimate suggests that about 200 bighas can be retrieved for new projects if the 15,000 civic labourers are rehabilitated. 

 ?We plan to construct multi-storeyed quarters to rehabilitate the labourers. The leftover land can be utilised for the construction of malls, commercial complex, IT centres and entertainment centres,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 ?It is essential for the makeover of the city. The labourers will be given better living conditions with sanitation and water supply facilities,? Bhattacharyya promised. 

 A pilot project is likely to kick off shortly, involving three or four of the labour quarters.

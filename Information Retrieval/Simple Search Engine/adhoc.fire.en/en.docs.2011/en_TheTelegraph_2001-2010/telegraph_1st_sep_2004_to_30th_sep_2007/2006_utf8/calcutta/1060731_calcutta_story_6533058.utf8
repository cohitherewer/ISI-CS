Life

 Shower splendour

 Hi-tech systems, adorable 

 add-ons and a dash of imagination can bring a fresh feel into 

 your bath zone, says Shradha Agarwal

 HOUSE 

 PROUD

 Simple, neglected and boring. 

 Your bathroom, like an old, somewhat dragging relationship, 

 can be screaming out for attention, and sometimes rightly 

 so. The need of the hour then is some life, a breath of 

 fresh air and lots of innovative ideas. You begin 

 and end your day in a bathroom, so why not put in some extra 

 effort to do it up? urges interior designer Ajay Arya.

 GoodLife tells you how.

 Bare basics

 Trendy or traditional, some basic 

 things always remain, well, basic. Rohit Sarda, proprietor 

 of Designer Home, a bathroom design studio on Elgin Road, 

 gives pointers to designing a bathroom.

 Be involved in decision-making 

 from day one. Leaving the finer details to outsiders leads 

 to lack of personal touch in a personal space. 

 Divide the total space 

 clearly into dry area and wet area. 

 Dont mix white and 

 yellow lights. 

 Ask specifically for anti-slip, 

 non-glossy tiles for the floor. 

 Go for steel fittings, 

 not the typical brass ones that are coated with chromium. 

 Steel not only looks stylish but also withstands high iron 

 content in water, very common in Calcutta.

 Create a niche ? for bath 

 basics or a ceramic or marble showpiece.

 Tech treat

 Revolutionary is how one can describe 

 the growth of bathroom necessities, fittings and add-ons. 

 Tiles of any shape except standard square ones, water tiles 

 and rain showers instead of a plain cubicle, glass mosaic 

 detailing, a space-saving wall-hung WC with a concealed 

 cistern, chic counter-tops boasting designer basins and 

 specialised bathroom furniture? Bathrooms are anything but 

 boring today.

 Deep-hued tiles for the lower 

 half, a jazzy border separation and then a lighter upper 

 half, bathrooms like these have long become Jurassic Park. 

 When it comes to designing a bathroom, the newer trends 

 showcase creativity at its best. Tiles, especially, have 

 undergone a magical makeover, says Rohit.

 Leather, metallic or stone ? choose 

 your ceramic tiles with any of these finishes.

 Also, check out the evolution 

 of showers: single flow to multiple flow (including simple, 

 waterfall and massage flow) to rain shower to the latest 

 range of water tiles. 

 Kid comfort

 A bathtub to splash in, cheerful 

 shower curtains, cute bathroom sets housing cuter toothbrushes, 

 the sweet-smelling range of Mother Care or Johnsons 

 amp; Johnsons. A babys bathroom is no childs 

 play to set up. 

 The right height, 

 says interior consultant Meenakshi Dutta, plays the 

 most important role in a childrens bathroom. 

 The basin counter, WC or even 

 the mirror have to be placed right, according to the childs 

 height, keeping in mind the sudden growth spurts, of course. 

 Ajay lists some more points to 

 remember. 

 An anti-skid ledge to 

 grip is a must near the bath section. 

 Glass panels and cubicles 

 are a no-no. 

 Ensure a door lock that 

 is childproof.

 A sunk-in, conventional 

 basin on an in-built counter is best for babies.

 Avoid cartoon characters 

 or extremely childish designs on tiles. Kids tend to outgrow 

 them fast and changing tiles isnt the most practical 

 or cheap option. If you still prefer cartoons, stick to 

 the accessories. 

 Dont dabble in too 

 many colours. Pick one primary shade, complemented with 

 a neutral hue. 

 Check out Sarika Bansals 

 range of imported bathroom accessories at Sriram Gardens 

 in Alipore for loofahs, soap-plates, funky bathroom stoppers 

 and bath sets. Her range can make any kids bathroom 

 come alive.

 Romantic retreat

 Coming second only to a spa, your 

 bathroom can be the perfect sensual getaway that a hard 

 days end deserves. With attention to some details, 

 experts say that a romantic feel is easy to achieve.

 The key points are lighting 

 and the use of wood, says Ajay. His suggestion: control 

 your lighting and go for diffused lighting or even dimmed.

 Carolann Hooper, spa manager at 

 Solace, shares her secrets to lend a spa feel to your bathroom.

 Small aroma candles dotted 

 around the bathtub and other edges set the mood.

 Place a bowl of water 

 with floating petals and sprinkle some romantic essential 

 oil. 

 Light cane furniture like 

 a stool or a basket goes well.

 Ribbon-tied towels in 

 soft colours add life to the basin counter.

 Picture frames flaunting 

 your favourite moments add a sense of personal character.

 Choose sheer shower curtains 

 with raw-finish wooden rings.

 Soft, shaggy rugs thrown 

 on the floors look cosy. 

 Display a collection of 

 bath salts and oils in pottery-style dispensers. 

 And finally, says Carolann: 

 Raise a toast with great wine and exotic fruits in 

 bite-sized pieces.

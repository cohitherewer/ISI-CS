 After the rising on Independence Day, the awakening on Republic Day. If Aamir Khan as Mangal Pandey had stormed record screens last August, Aamir Khan as DJ, aka Daljit, returns on Thursday to remix the screen-steal blitzkrieg.

 As many as 32 shows of Rang De Basanti will play in a single day in the city?s four multiplexes and with the film?s duration running up to almost three hours, Aamir will effectively be on every second plex screen at any given time.

 The exhibitors are banking on Rang De Basanti to break Bollywood?s January jinx, which has seen everything from Amitabh Bachchan?s Family: Ties of Blood to the Sanjay Dutt-John Abraham-starrer Zinda failing at the box-office.

 ?It is the only big film around and with all the controversies, there?s a lot of buzz around Rang De Basanti,? says Ravi Raman, general manager of Fame (Hiland Park). ?We all want to go in with the maximum number of shows.?

 The film, where ?a generation awakens? after a MiG crash, is perhaps better suited for the multiplexes, which have increased the film?s ticket prices up to Rs 200. Says Aroon Sharma, head of INOX Leisure Ltd, which is handling the release in Bengal: ?We didn?t want to go big with the plexes, affecting the business at the 1,000-seater single-screen theatres. But due to the high demand, the exhibitors offered better terms for more Rang De shows.?

 The standalone theatres aren?t left behind, though. ?We are not used to mid-week releases but the response has been good this time,? reveals Pranab Ray, owner of Menoka. Rang De?s makers, of course, want to make the most of the buzz. Says the producer, UTV?s Ronnie Screwvala: ?We wanted to exploit the long weekend and so came in with extra prints.?

 Remarkably, Rang De Basanti started playing at all the multiplexes and single-screen theatres in the city Wednesday evening onwards, even though the film?s official release date is January 26. ?Since it?s a patriotic film, we wanted it to release on Republic Day. At the same time, we didn?t want to lose out on the audiences coming in on Wednesday night with Thursday being a holiday. So, we ran paid previews all over the country,? is the explanation from UTV.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take-it-easy twist to hawker trouble

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Both the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), in separate affidavits, will inform the high court on Friday that although they would like the city?s pavements to be clear of hawkers, they will avoid any ?confrontation? with them.

 On this excuse, they will seek more time to work out and present a hawker policy before the court. 

 Thereafter, they will seek more time to implement the policy, once it is ready.

 Last month, the court had asked them to present on June 16 their policy on restricting hawkers on city pavements.

 In their respective affidavits, the two bodies will tell the court that as the first step towards framing the policy, a high-powered committee has already been formed. It consists of city police chief Prasun Mukherjee, deputy commissioner (traffic), Jawed Shamim, three mayoral council members of the CMC and leader of three central hawkers? unions. The committee has been asked to chalk out a scheme to amicably settle the hawker problem.

 The affidavits by the state and the CMC will be placed before the division bench of Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice S. Sen. The court had expressed grave concern over the ?cancerous growth? of hawkers on city footpaths.

 The twin affidavits will inform the court that they are not bound to follow the national policy on hawkers.

 ?The national policy on hawkers has not been implemented yet. It is a draft policy and the Centre has sent the drafts to all the state governments to seek their opinion on it. We, the Bengal government, are not going to approve of such a policy,? the affidavit will state.

 The two bodies will also assert that they do not want any confrontation with the hawkers. ?Considering the socio-economic structure of the city, we want to settle the problem after taking the views of the hawkers,? the affidavits state.

 The government, in its affidavit, will speak of the bitter experience it had when it tried to remove hawkers from the Hatibagan and Gariahat areas. The state and CMC say they are concerned at problems caused by encroachment of pavements by hawkers.

 The CMC, in its affidavit, will say that on many earlier occasions, it had evicted hawkers from different pavements. ?But the very next day, the hawkers were back again. We have no machinery to keep the footpaths permanently hawker-free,? the affidavit will add.

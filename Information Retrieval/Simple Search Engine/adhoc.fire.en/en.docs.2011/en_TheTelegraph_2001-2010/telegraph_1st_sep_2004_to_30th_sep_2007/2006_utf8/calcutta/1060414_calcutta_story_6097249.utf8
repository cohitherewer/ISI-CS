 Couple in cuffs for doctor murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Jayanta Ghosh

 The Criminal Investigation Department on Thursday arrested Bikas Mondal and his wife Bidyapati in Kandi, Murshidabad, for their alleged involvement in the murder of Salt Lake-based doctor Jayanta Ghosh on March 6. 

 The detectives have seized from the couple the revolver that Jagannath Naskar, alias Jaga, tried to use to kill the 62-year-old physician. When the revolver didn?t work, the doctor?s throat was slit and he was left to die on the banks of the Mayurakshi.

 ?Bikas is the brother-in-law of Bablu Pal, the leader of the gang that picked up Ghosh from his chamber. On the night of March 6, soon after dumping the doctor, Bablu went to Bikas and asked him to keep the revolver. Bablu even took Rs 1,500 from Bikas for expenses on their way back to the city,? said Soumen Mitra, deputy inspector-general of police (CID). 

 Three weeks earlier, Bablu, Jagannath and three other gang members were arrested. Investigations have revealed that Bablu bought the revolver from an arms dealer for Rs 2,600, after selling a plot of land for Rs 18,000.

 Hons papers put back in Part I exams

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Acting on a demand by students, Calcutta University has decided that Part I of the new three-part undergraduate course will include the Honours subject as well. The change will be effected from the next academic session (2006-07).

 The two-part undergraduate curriculum was split into three last year and the university had announced that students would not write any Honours paper in the Part I examination, held after the first year of the three-year course.

 ?While restructuring the course last year, we had kept the Honours papers out of the Part I curriculum thinking it would suit students better,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs). 

 ?But students insisted that they write some of the Honours papers in Part I itself. The proposal was placed before the undergraduate council, which ratified it last week,? he added.

 The proposal will now be placed before the syndicate, the highest policy-making body of the university.

 Sources said the demand for including Honours papers in Part I was submitted to the authorities in writing by the Students? Federation of India, the students? wing of the CPM.

 Pro vice-chancellor Das said a meeting of the boards of studies of various subjects would be convened soon to discuss how much of the Honours syllabi should be included in Part I. 

 Students are required to study eight Honours papers of 100 marks each. ?We will finalise how many papers will be included in Part I after considering the views of the boards of studies,? Das added.

 Under the 1+1+1 system that came into effect in 2005, the Part I syllabus includes compulsory language papers, environmental science and a few Pass papers. Part II and Part III include the Honours and the rest of the pass papers.

 Till 2004, the undergraduate courses of Calcutta University were divided into two parts. Part I exams were held at the end of the second year and Part II at the end of the third year. The eight Honours papers were split equally between the two parts.

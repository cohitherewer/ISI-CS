 What: 

 Launch of Chalo Cricket Manayen, a virtual cricket 

 service by Hutch.

 Where: City Centre and Hiland Park.

 When: December 12.

 Take guard: Get set for your game of bat and ball with the new virtual cricket service, launched for the first time in India by Hutchison Essar Limited. 

 Take your pick from Brett Lee, Shoaib Akhtar, Irfan Pathan or any of your favourite international bowlers. Next, sport the virtual reality headgear, which consists of a 3D eyepiece through which you can see the bowler. The headgear is connected to the laptop, which handles the software to run the game. The cricket bat has a sensor attached to it that is connected to the laptop. Using the Hawk-eye technology every cricket watcher is now familiar with, the movement of the bat is caught on a tracker device. So, step out and drive!

 The Chalo Cricket Manayen campaign will be stationed at City Centre till Thursday and will move to Hiland Park till Saturday. It will soon cover other metros.

 Voiceover: Calcutta has always been a city of firsts, it was the first metro where cellular service was started. What better way to celebrate the passion for cricket than to bring this sport to the city in a unique format, especially with the World Cup coming up? smiled Asit Shekhar, vice-president, sales and marketing operations, Hutchison Essar Limited.

 What: Wrap It Right, a gift-packaging workshop.

 Where: Patchi at Forum.

 When: December 12.

 Take a look: In a gift-wrapping workshop by artist Rohita Bhaskaran, an all-woman audience watched the lady pack crystal pieces, wedding hampers and chocolates topped with decorative ribbons and flowers. 

 The afternoon began with an introduction on how to wrap trousseau, right down to the details of packing gifts pretty.

 Handcrafted gift boxes and trays, theme-based decoration, stylised gift packaging and creative usage of velvet and printed wrapping paper were a few tricks of the trade that Rohita shared. It was an interactive session with creative ideas and lots of tips.

 Voiceover: Patchi 

 is synonymous with celebration. Chocolates are gifts for 

 every occasion and a beautifully wrapped gift adds to the 

 delight and suspense, says Nupur Chamaria, owner, 

 Patchi.

 Taste of Italy unplugged

 OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, 

 CUCINA ITALIANA SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME THE FLAVOUR TO 

 CONTEND WITH, RIGHT HERE IN CALCUTTA, OBSERVES RITA BHIMANI

 Italian meals not just risotto and pasta

 Though pizzas have become 

 a favourite nasta

 But true Italian cucina

 Has a different arena

 And the scope for this cuisines 

 much vaster.

 We get highly indignant when our British friends regale us with tales about their favourite curry. And balk at the fact that they have also laid proud claim to Chicken Tikka Masala as a national dish, which is even slivered into hamburgers. 

 The Italians could accuse us in India of the same narrow focus. Because in the average lay persons lexicon, the pizza-pasta combine would come most readily to peoples minds. Any domestic hand can today rustle up a pee jaah on readymade roundels bought in regular bazaars. The hungry-kya brigade can phone in their desired toppings for their favourite pizzas. And the heavily-advertised readymade packet pastas come up trumps with children whose moms find it an instant school-returning appeaser. 

 Times change, though. Our inveterate travellers can tell you the difference between a porcini mushroom used in risotto and the rarer tartufo or truffle and which osteria (a cross between a bar and a trattoria) in Venice gives you a snacking option teamed with quick quaffs of an ombra a little glass of wine. 

 And in the past couple of years, and more so, in the last few weeks, cucina Italiana seems to have become the flavour to contend with. Right here in Calcutta. 

 At a recent exhibition that showcased a century of Italian menus, at The Park, what was truly flavourful was the artistic tradition highlighted through the display. In the compilation of more than 250 historic and artistic menus through the decades, we could find reflected a great sense of occasion, as also reproductions of the works of famous artists who had graced those restaurants.

 The hugely illustrated and well documented publication the Accademia Italiana della Cucina, dedicated to spreading the historic and cultural significance of Italian civilisation of the table, has given us new insights. Not only into the visual stunners that the menus represent, but also as a gastronomic journey that focuses on the evolution of the culture, language and civilisation of the table.

 From menus for royalty in the late 19th and early 20th century, menus for dinners hosted by Presidents of the Italian Republic, to the ones illustrated by famous artists the visual nutrients give us a chance to mull and slurp over pomp and circumstance.

 We found in the exhibition, for instance, the menus of the Kings of Italy that combined great graphics with a high gastronomical content, the variety going up to as much as 500 different selections in a particular year. The Italian regional specialities found special focus, and when the Italian monarchs went overseas they were treated to grand Italian spreads.

 Coming to the 20th century, the menus have honoured personae ranging from Dante Alighieri (his 600th death anniversary commemorated in Rome and Florence); Pavarotti and his passion for horses in Modena; Da Vinci remembered in a menu for the Fiera di Milano and Enzo Ferrari celebrating with his reds in Monte Carlo. 

 Quite remarkable, too, was how other nations feted famed Italian personalities, from Marconi in London in 1903 to Caruso in New York in 1916 to Puccini in Buenos Aires in 1905 to Valentino in Mexico city. There are menus from transatlantic liners like Michaelangelo and Raffaello and scenes of Italy reproduced on the covers of Alitalia menus, revealing a vast culinary and cultural creativity.

 As we viewed the exhibits over bruschettas and other canapes, and glasses of red and white wine did the rounds, the overheard and actual conversations also reflected the changed attitudes and refinements of the Indians present.

 When a young student said Salute! to a friend with her bicchiere of red, and commented on the fact that the chianti was lovely wasnt it, a semi-celeb passed by and said, Theres more to Italian wines than just chianti, which we used to down at street cafes when we were your age. Oof!

 There were others who traded their experiences of a lusty Ribollita Bean Soup in Tuscany, an Osso Bucco or a Torta Pasqualina (a tart with spinach and ricotta cheese) or the famed parma ham, and some showed their highly developed palates when they had Fried Baby Octopus (moscardini) in a seafood restaurant in Rome. 

 And then there was this wonderful conversation I had with Subroto Dutta, who has been teaching and translating Italian for a dozen years, and Angelo Pugliese, a lecturer at Jadavpur University, who counselled me, Italini mangaro solo pizza, pane, pasta e basta.nonevero. You can get the drift. The new crop of Italian restaurants in town proves that you can go well beyond these.

 Our own Italian consul general, Agostino Pinna, was also at pains to explain the many facets of regional food and the once north-south divide. Being from Turin, or Torino, his favourites are the famous red meats and the French-influence foods downed with a red Barolo, a wine that has been described as robust, velvety, truffle-scented with orange reflections the wine of kings and the king of wines.

 Many people present shared their experiences of risottos, either the making of it (be sure of your arborio rice and porcini mushrooms, and dont get too cheesy, one gourmet counselled). The Risotto Alla Milanese seems to be an all-time favourite, with its touch of saffron.

 The story behind it is more interesting. We hark back to 1574, when the fabulous Gothic structure, the Duomo, was being built in Milan. There was this young apprentice who was enjoying adding a saffron pigment to the stained glass being created for the windows. People teased him about this indulgence. Tired of the taunts, he added saffron to the rice served at his masters wedding. As it happened, this was a big hit and became the popular variant it is today!

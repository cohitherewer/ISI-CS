Stars and Style

Will she or wont she? We mean, ditch her sports 

gear and sport a sari. The buzz about whether Calcutta will see the Swiss Miss 

donning a nine-yard has grown ever since the world no. 9 set foot in the city 

last Friday. The suspense ends on Wednesday night.

The Sunfeast Open Players Party at ITC Sonar 

Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers on Wednesday evening will see the stars of Sunfeast 

Open 2006 (there remains a question mark over Sania Mirzas presence) walking 

a makeshift ramp in designs by Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

And if the designer has her way, Martina Hingis will 

be flaunting an ethnic sari. Given her height and petite frame, Martina 

would carry a sari really well. Shell look truly beautiful and elegant in 

an Indian sari, said Kiran.

The designer, though, added in the same breath: But 

I still havent met her and finalised anything. So, I dont even know 

whether shell like to wear a sari.

If the word from Martina is aye, a sari 

in shades of brown and white with red accents awaits her, while the 

rest of the girls will sport creations from Kirans autumn-winter 2006-07 

line unveiled at the Rome Fashion Week (Couture) in July.

The collection with mens-wear influences in 

the form of pinstripes revolves around a colour story of black, white, grey and 

brown. The players will sport jackets, dresses, churi pants, angarakhas, 

Jodhpurs and saris.

This is the first time Calcutta will see my 

autumn-winter line. The look is simple yet chic, added Kiran, refusing to 

divulge details about the look planned for the sport stars.

Theres still lots to be done because I 

havent done fittings with the girls. And till that is done I cannot decide 

what outfits to give them. My clothes are done to model measurements and these 

players have bigger frames; so a lot depends on the fitting session with them, 

she explained.

Apart from the star dazzle, the party hosted by Ravi 

Naware, divisional chief executive of ITC Foods, will see a performance by the 

band Fusion.

 Revelry on the riverfront

 Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus came

Fossils was such a rage on Day Three of Riviera 

that the host college?s music band, Sixth String, had to be given a miss to let 

it mesmerise the crowds till well past the Cinderella hour. 

 Riviera. Situated by River Hooghly, in the midst of an Industrial belt, a Vision drives this Institute towards Excellence in Recreation and Academics. Riviera, therefore, describes our college, Haldia Institute of Technology, and it is also what our annual fest is called. This year, the four-day fiesta, presented in association with The Telegraph, was held from March 23 to 26.

 Like all other years, a lot of emotions and effort went into making the ninth edition of the cultural fest a grand success. Students who were in the organising team saw to it that the mega event was not reduced to just a few days of mindless mirth. 

 Dignitaries from education, industry and health sectors gave a new dimension to the event. We consciously included quizzes and seminars, along with the usual fare of music, dance and other fun competitions, to give more meaning to the yearly get-together.

 It is noticed that our generation is hardly acquainted with the art form of mime. The fest organisers made an effort to provide a platform for bridging the gap between the GenNext and the dying art form. The audience reaction to the brilliant piece by members of Jogesh Dutta Mime Academy on Day One overwhelmed even Dutta. Praising the crowd, he said that he had never received such a warm response from students before.

 On the second day of the fest, one of the college bands provided wholesome entertainment with songs of Nirvana, Jal and many other recent hits. DJ Harish later took over to churn out some fast and catchy numbers.

 The lectures and audio-visual presentations at a seminar on AIDS, conducted on March 25 by West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, were an eye-opener for us. An interactive session between the experts and the students in the audience followed the seminar.

 Drama, choreography and musical performances dominated all four days of the fest. Apart from performances by five college bands, Fossils and Parikrama pepped up the evenings on Days Three and Four. 

 Fossils ruled with songs from its latest album, Mission F, for more than two-and-a-half hours on March 25. Rupam and Deep?s on-stage energy raised the spirits of the crowd. But Parikrama was the real surprise on the final day of Riviera. Initially, the organisers were a little apprehensive about how the crowd would respond to heavy metal. But by the time the band from Delhi had pulled their act on stage, the young fans were wild with ecstasy.

 The final year students were the most emotional at the end of the final day as it was their last fest.

 That the organisers had strictly kept to the schedule, accommodating performances both by students and celebrities, on all four days helped the fest wind up most wonderfully on March 26.

 Culture cradle

 As the college fest at Haldia drew to a close, another in the city had just started to gain momentum. Sanskriti, the annual cultural extravaganza of the faculty of engineering and technology of Jadavpur University (JU), kicked off on March 25 at its Salt Lake campus. On Monday, the fest, organised in association with The Telegraph, shifted to the main campus with the preliminary rounds of various competitions.

 What began as an initiative on a comparatively smaller scale about three decades ago, in defiance to the monotony of the workaday routine, has now matured into one of the biggest sensations of the fest circuit in eastern India.

 Ever true to its central theme, Sanskriti aims at redefining culture, catering to a variety of tastes, standing out by virtue of its sheer exuberance and freshness.

 The run-up to the annual fete was not a cakewalk for the organisers. Three months of hard work has gone into the five-day package (till April 1) of non-stop excitement on the JU main campus. Hip Pocket rocked the Salt Lake stage on March 25. The star attractions at the main venue in the coming days are performances by Jogesh Dutta Mime Academy, a play by Chetana, a kobir lorai and a stint by Shiva.

 Sanskriti has always been a torchbearer when it comes to bringing new artistes to town, and this year is no exception. If things go as per plan, Ali Azmat of Junoon fame will take over the open air theatre on the university premises at the finale.

 The Muktamancha on the JU grounds will also witness a plethora of events, ranging from dance and music competitions to T-shirt painting, and rangoli to poster painting. Participants will comprise students from colleges in the city and beyond. For the past few years, such is the craze of these competitive items that they are even threatening to unseat the guest performances as the more popular events of the line-up.

 For the students, the entire experience of putting up a programme of this magnitude, of watching their efforts bear fruit and soaking in the adulation is what counts at the end of it all. 

 The path leading to this sense of achievement is a hard trek, consisting of repeated visits to companies, setting up deals, raising funds, contacting artistes and preparing the schedules. The endless brainstorming in the union room shapes the final product.

 Of course, there are days when we, students, feel that all efforts are in vain, when everything goes wrong and funds refuse to materialise. But nobody loses hope. Seniors watch over us, give us tips and correct mistakes. Peers chip in from their own pockets and strangers come forward to help. And with every passing year, Sanskriti rises to a grander scale.

 In more ways than one, for us the five days of Sanskriti are similar to the five days of Durga puja. When the act at the open air theatre wraps up on the last day, we feel the same sense of loss as we do when the deity is immersed. 

 And just like the great festival of Bengal, Sanskriti never dies. It passes on to new batches who are ever willing to step into their seniors? shoes and carry the festive flame aloft.

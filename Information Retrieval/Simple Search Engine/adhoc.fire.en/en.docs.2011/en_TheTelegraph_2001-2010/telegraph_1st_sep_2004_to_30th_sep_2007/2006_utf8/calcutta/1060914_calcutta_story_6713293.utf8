 Repair row ruins roads

 - PRE-PUJA FIX UNLIKELY

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An unsettled dispute between the state public works department (PWD) and the Calcutta Port Trust will ensure that 32 roads maintained by the Port Trust dont get repaired before the Puja. 

 The Port Trust maintains around 80 km of roads in the city, including Circular Garden Reach Road, Munshi Premchand Sarani and Ekbalpore Road. Most of these roads are in a shambles, lined liberally with potholes and craters. 

 A couple of months ago, the PWD had written to the Port Trust, asking it to carry out repairs on these roads in the run-up to Durga puja. 

 In its reply, the Port Trust had reportedly refused to carry out the repairs, referring to an agreement signed by it and the state government two years ago. 

 According to the agreement, the state government had asked the Port Trust to pay Rs 3 crore initially for the repair work. It was decided that the maintenance would subsequently be taken over by the PWD. But the PWD authorities argued that the agreement was not finalised.

 No such agreement was signed. Only a statement was issued by the finance department. It clearly said that the PWD would undertake maintenance work only when the Port Trust hands over the roads to us as assets. But that never took place, explained Pradip Kanti Deb, chief engineer, PWD.

 Why should we repair the roads that are maintained by the Port Trust? We had asked them to hand over the roads to us as assets or carry out the repairs, which is quite logical, said PWD secretary P. K. Agarwal.

 On the other hand, the Port Trust maintained that as it had paid the initial amount, the PWD was responsible for the repairs. 

 We have paid Rs 2.65 crore of the Rs 3 crore that we were to pay for the capital repair work. This year, we will pay the rest. Therefore, any maintenance work this year will invite their intervention and expenditure, explained A.K. Chanda, Port Trust chairman.

 As a result of this dispute, motorists negotiating the potholed roads are suffering and traffic has slowed down considerably. 

 We had asked the Port Trust to repair the roads or hand them over to us, said Tuhin Bera, mayoral council member (roads) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 What: 

 Learn Smart Workshop by Kriya. 

 Where: Ocio at 5, Belvedere 

 Road.

 When: June 1 to 3.

 Take a look: With summer vacations on in most schools, books have taken a backseat for the little ones. And what better way to chill out than a three-day workshop that has packed in some education with oodles of fun. 

 The three-day session had 65 children aged between 7 and 13 enjoying themselves at Vedic mathematics, creative writing and public speaking sessions. On Thursday, the activities centred around the FIFA World Cup 2006 theme. Children had to design a menu card keeping in mind the given situation FIFA World Cup was taking place in Eden Gardens this year and friends invited from seven different countries would be treated to a host of Indian delicacies. The tiny designers came up with colourful menus peppered with sequins and streamers. 

 Next it was the World Cup Jersey Designing and Slogan Writing session. East or West Brazil Is The Best, Brazil Rox, Ronaldo RoxBrazil clearly seemed to be a hot favourite. 

 A creative writing session asked the kids to rack their brains on how Happy Hour (a cartoon character designed by Kriya), now a successful football player, traces his journey to success. Next it was fun time with FIFA Around The World In One Hour Game. 

 At the Vedic mathematics session on Friday, it was alpha numerology tricks to solve problems on addition, subtraction, multiplication, percentages, ratios, squares and square roots. For the public speaking exercise on Saturday, tots posing as celebrities will be put to verbal argument. So Greg Chappell will debate Sourav Ganguly, Tom will argue with Jerry and Pervez Musharraf will be in conversation with Manmohan Singh.

 Voiceover: Workshops like this allow children to learn and enjoy at the same time, said Saurabh Rungta from Kriya.

 Work wows

 What: Workplaces, Places That Work, hosted by Indian Institute for Interior Designers (IIID), Calcutta. 

 Where: Oxford Bookstore.

 When: Sunday, 6.30 pm.

 Take a look: The International Federation of Interior Architects/Designers declared May 28 as World Interior Day this year. The day, usually the last Sunday of May, is celebrated the world over every year. To bring the occasion to Calcutta, IIID hosted an interactive session on interior designing in the city. 

 Moderated by architect Geeta Balakrishnan, the focus of the discussion was relevant aspects of office designing. A packed venue saw interior design students as well as professionals lapping up suggestions. The panel included Ram Ray, chairman and managing director, Response, G.M. Kapur, convenor, INTACH, eastern region, developer Pradip Chopra, Amitava Sinha, head, Rediffusion DYR, Dulal Mukherjee, architect and chairman of IIID, Calcutta, and Maina Bhagat, events consultant, Oxford Bookstore. Partha Ranjan Das, vice chairman, IIID, Calcutta, and Anjan Mitra, treasurer, IIID, Calcutta, made suggestions.

 Voiceover: Today 

 there is too much cloning in the field of interior designing. 

 A space should reflect the personality of the client, 

 Ram Ray said.

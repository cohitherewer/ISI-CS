 The wave of resurgence sweeping India has brought with it a new dawn for the Anglo-Indian community. And where better to celebrate the revival but at one of their oldest settlements, Calcutta.

 The city is all set to host a three-day gala of, by and for the Anglo-Indian community, from October 20 to 22. The theme for the joint annual general meeting (AGM), organised by The All-India Anglo-Indian Association and The All-India Anglo-Indian Education Institution, is A New Dawn. 

 Its a matter of great pride that Calcutta is hosting such an AGM for the first time in 44 years. The record registrations, including more than 100 youth members, is heart-warming, said Barry OBrien, governing body member (West Bengal) of the association.

 Many people in the past felt that we were a little aloof. Thats not the case any more, as can be seen at our AGMs. We are very proud to be Indians and also comfortable with our own culture, added Ian Myers, convenor of the AGM.

 The association, in its 130th year, has 60 branches across India but the turnout of 500 delegates from 45 cities and towns at the AGM has something to do with the host city as well. The venue has itself been a magnet, drawing delegates from Cochin to Dehra Dun, Jaipur to Jabalpur. Many have an old Calcutta connection, said Neil OBrien, president-in-chief of the association.

 The AGMs are where the community mucks-in, a term often used to mean having fun and letting the hair down. This week, the classrooms of Frank Anthony Public School will double as dormitories for the delegates, hosting impromptu singalongs and lively gatherings.

 The inaugural ceremony at La Martiniere for Boys on October 20 will feature a musical presentation by Don Saigal, Rubin Robeiro and Clive Hughes. The Pride of the Community Honour will be bestowed on singer Pam Crain, while product designer Neil Foley will be felicitated with the Reach for the Stars Award.

 For AGM regulars, the three days are meant to revive old ties. World War II veteran Charles Wright, a delegate from Coonoor, said: The AGM is an annual pilgrimage I cant miss. It recharges my batteries for the rest of the year.

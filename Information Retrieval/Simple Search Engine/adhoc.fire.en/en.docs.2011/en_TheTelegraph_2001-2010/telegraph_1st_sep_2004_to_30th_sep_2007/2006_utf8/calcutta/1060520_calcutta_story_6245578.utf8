 Services at R. Ahmed Dental College and Hospital were crippled on Friday as students and junior doctors went on a strike, as part of the nation-wide protests against reservation.

 ?We held a token strike to express solidarity with the anti-quota movement. We will also join the Youth for Equality hunger strike on the National Medical College and Hospital campus,? said Arindam Banerjee, a member of the house staff at the dental hospital. 

 An official said students did not attend classes and junior doctors stayed away from the outpatients? department (OPD). ?Around 50 teachers had to work hard to compensate for the absence of the junior doctors,? said principal Dibyendu Mazumdar.

 At Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, the authorities have set up a medical team to monitor the health of students and junior doctors taking part in the indefinite, relay hunger strike.

 ?The team is continuously monitoring the health of the students,? said superintendent Mrityunjay Mukherjee.

 The strike at the dental college had the backing of the Indian Dental Association.

 A victim of the strike was Anik Biswas, 30-year-old resident of Chinsurah. He had undergone a surgery in the lower jaw and came to the hospital on Friday for a check-up. 

 When Metro caught up with him at the OPD, he had been waiting for three hours for his turn. ?There?s still a long queue ahead,? he sighed.

 Chiradip Kar, a postgraduate trainee, argued that the protesters had taken all steps to ensure patients were not inconvenienced, ?but certain problems are unavoidable?.

 At Calcutta National Medical College, intern Satyajit Das said Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) students spoke to the protesters about joining the hunger strike. ?We will announce our decision soon,? said Satsheel Shrotriya of IIMC.

 Trio held for serial burglary

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 In a pre-dawn swoop on Friday, a team from the detective department arrested three young men who had allegedly committed four burglaries in the Karaya-Beniapukur belt in the past month.

 Of the three, one was picked up from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Palm Avenue neighbourhood.

 Stolen items, worth Rs 2 lakh, including jewellery, saris and CD players, were recovered from Shamsher, Saifuddin and Munna.

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said the three used to enter houses by breaking open the doors or window grilles. Once in, they stole everything they could carry.

 The sleuths activated their sources after receiving complaints and were informed that the man behind the operation was Munna.

 Munnas house in Shibtala Lane, Tiljala, was under surveillance. We rounded him up early on Friday. He disclosed the names of the other two, said an officer. The team then rushed to a hideout in a Topsia bylane and arrested Saifuddin. Shamsher was picked up from from his Palm Avenue house.

 According to police, the trio knew the Karaya-Beniapukur area well. They committed theft at two apartments in Karaya on the night of November 13. The other two robberies were committed in broad daylight, said deputy commissioner Singh.

 The trio has been remanded in police custody for 10 days.

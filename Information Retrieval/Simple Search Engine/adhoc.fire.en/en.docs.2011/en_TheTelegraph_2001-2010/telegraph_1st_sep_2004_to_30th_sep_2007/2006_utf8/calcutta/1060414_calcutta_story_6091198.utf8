 Shiva has carved a niche in Red fort

 After 30-odd years of Left Front rule, it?s time BBD Bag was renamed Red Square. 

 But Marx alone is not the presiding deity of Writers? Buildings. The Hindu gods share this distinction with the father of Communism.

 It is not impossible to miss this tiny Shiva temple built into the red wall of Writers? facing Lyons Range, opposite the huge, pink Turner Morrison building. 

 People passing by, many of them stockbrokers, stop for a few moments with folded hands before the deities. Some extend their palm for prasad or ask the priest to put a tika on their forehead.

 B.P. Karfa, caretaker of Writers? Buildings says: ?Yes, the staff do go there for puja, as do the stockbrokers and men who work in roadside eateries. Shivaratri is celebrated here in a big way. I, too, join my colleagues, though it has nothing to do with faith.?

 Small it may be, but it is not lacking in ostentation. The temple walls and the floor are all lined with marble and the deities are carved from the same material.

 There is Rama with his consort and brother ? the largest and most colourfully attired of the deities. 

 There are, besides, a Durga riding her lion, Ganesh, Mahadev and Parvati, and last but not least, the Saibaba of Shirdi. 

 From the d?cor to the deities, everything has the touch of North India in it. 

 Apart from the small electronic wall clock with a picture of Jagannath and his siblings, there is nothing to tell that the man who looks after the temple is from Orissa.

 The priest, Narahari Das, 51, a pleasant-faced man in a white dhoti kurta, is from Jajpur district. His young son sits quietly in one corner. Narahari says he started performing puja here as a youngster in 1971.

 Before him, both his father, Murari Mohan Das and grandfather, Kangali Charan, did the same. 

 ?I have heard from my father that when the British ruled, the Shivalinga used to be kept under a neem tree. My grandfather used to live in Janbazar then, and he would come every morning to perform puja here, and in the neighbourhood eateries as well,? recounts Narahari.

 In those days, the shrine was plain. Later, it was made over a few times. 

 In the early 80s, when a contractor bagged a big job within Writers?, he was kind enough to introduce marble to the bare walls and floor.

 Prayag Singh, 75, who owns a sweet shop at 16, India Exchange Place, next to what used to be the Standard Chartered Bank building, confirms that earlier, the shrine used to a humble affair, like the one adjoining the Turner Morrison building. Later, both were done up.

 Narahari, who lives in Shibpur, Howrah, says the shrine is maintained with donations from Writers? staff, either from upcountry or Orissa.

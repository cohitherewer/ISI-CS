 The City Diary

 City-based cable operators have decided not to take part in a blackout plan by cable operators across the country on Tuesday to protest a promotional campaign for Dish TV by Zee network. Dish TV is the direct-to-home service of Zee. One Dish TV antenna provides connection to only one television set. But Zee network channels are now showing advertisements for Dish TV antennas that can be used to provide connections to an entire building. The multi-system operators have no problems with the airing of the advertisement, but the cable operators planned a blackout in protest against the development, which they feel is detrimental to their business interests.West Bengal Cable TV Operators United Front member Mrinal Chatterjee said the blackout was called off keeping the interest of viewers in mind. A spokesperson for Zee said cable and Dish TV are different platforms and the company has no role to play in the controversy.

 Higher study feathers in Calcutta cap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta?s higher education scene looks bright again. It is set to become one of the very few cities in the country to have the opportunity of expanding studies and research in both basic and social sciences.

 The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Thursday selected the 150-year-old Calcutta University as one of the five best institutions to conduct advanced studies and research in social sciences. 

 A few days ago, the Centre had chosen the city for setting up the prestigious Indian Institute in Science Education and Research.

 Both decisions follow the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government?s consistent efforts to convince the Centre that Calcutta is the ideal location for institutions of higher studies.

 The tag for Calcutta University will translate into an initial grant of Rs 3 crore for studies in history, sociology, economics and political science. 

 Part of the funds will go into the proposed revamp of the university?s Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic).

 The new institute, on the other hand, will deal with subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics and biological sciences.

 ?We will be able to make a perfect blend of the two areas in higher education ? basic and social sciences ? when our UGC-sponsored scheme gets underway,? asserted Das. He is also a member of the UGC and had attended the commission?s meeting in Delhi on Thursday.

 Explaining the importance of the UGC scheme, Das said: ?While the proposed institute will engage in research in biotechnology, which can effect a sea change in agriculture, farmers can hardly benefit unless studies are undertaken on how to educate them.?

 It is learnt that the UGC?s decision to select five institutes of excellence and grant them funds for intensive study in social sciences resulted from a proposal placed by pro vice-chancellor Das.

 The university has called a meet of senior teachers next month to start implementing the new project. In March, a national-level conference of social scientists from the country and abroad will be held to identify areas where more research is needed.

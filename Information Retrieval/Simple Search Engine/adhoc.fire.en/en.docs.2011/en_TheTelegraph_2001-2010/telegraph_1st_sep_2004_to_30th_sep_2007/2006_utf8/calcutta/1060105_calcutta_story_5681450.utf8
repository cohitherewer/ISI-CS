 Bank fraud hits a peak 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bank fraud has been on the rise at an alarming pace in the city. And most swindlers take recourse to obtaining loans for developing land or building a house to dupe a bank.

 In the past six months, 26 cases were registered and the amount of money swindled was over Rs 50 crore.

 The most recent case came to light on Monday, when the detective department arrested Sanjeev Arora on charges of swindling around Rs 80 lakh from a private bank by obtaining a house loan.

 ?There has been a spurt in bank fraud cases and we have alerted both private and nationalised banks,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department.

 ?The Reserve Bank of India has forwarded a set of guidelines to the banks, stressing proper verification of an applicant?s identity and the documents before sanctioning a loan. Of the 26 cases lodged in the past six months, we were able to crack 12,? he added.

 Most of the complaints have been registered by the central and south divisions of police. Private banks were the victims in a majority of cases. 

 Senior officers put the blame partly on the management of the banks. ?There are several loopholes in the verification process followed by a number of banks, especially the private ones, for granting a loan,? said an officer of the detective department.

 ?Most banks, to maximise profit, outsource verification to private agencies, which are mostly incompetent. There are also instances of involvement of employees of the bank or the agency in the fraud,? he added. 

 During interrogation, Sanjeev admitted to the crime and stated that the entire operation was pre-planned. The money, however, is yet to be recovered. Nor could the sleuths arrest the other accused, who impersonated a developer and helped Sanjeev get the loan.

 Sanjeev first contacted a developer, Fauzdar Shah, who had entered into a deal with a woman for developing her house in Swinhoe Lane. Sanjeev said he wanted to finance the project and obtained copies of the agreement from Shah.

 He later took the second accused to the bank, identified him as Shah, produced copies of the agreement and some forged papers, and sought a loan of Rs 80 lakh. The bank accepted all his claims and sanctioned Rs 79.78 lakh. Of the amount, Sanjeev paid Rs 53 lakh to the fake promoter.

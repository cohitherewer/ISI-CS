The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass requires more patrolling in the night during winter as it becomes unusually isolated at late hours. Passengers travelling in shuttle cars or taxis feel very insecure as apart from passing vehicles, there is hardly anybody in sight on the highway. Since it is relatively less congested, frequent patrolling shouldn?t be much of a problem for the police. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Can anybody spare a thought for the passengers who travel on the Sealdah-Bongaon section of Eastern Railway? Boarding the Bongaon train from Sealdah station during evening office hours is literally a nightmare. The train is jam-packed right from the station itself. I shudder to imagine the plight of those who try to get on the train from other stations on the route. Aren?t the authorities aware of the problem? Why don?t they introduce extra suburban trains during rush hours? 

 Amit V. Sengupta, Sarat Colony. 

 A few days ago, while returning from work, I noticed some pavement dwellers burning tyres, electric wires and plastic items along the roadside to keep themselves warm. Green activists are crying themselves hoarse over vehicular pollution but is anybody bothered about what these toxic fumes are doing to the environment? Burning of toxic substances along the roadside should be banned and awareness drives should be conducted amongst the poor to warn them of the hazards of the practice. 

 S. Sriram,

 Selimpur Road.

 Stir it up, in style

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 The ingredients for a happening party: rocking music, great grub, a well-stocked bar and the mood to match. And not leaving anything to chance as you play the perfect host.

 So why not add that extra spark, in the area that wins the maximum attention ? the beverage bounty. 

 Replace those ordinary-looking plastic stirrers with an array of interesting glass ones from Giggles on Park Street.

 Be it for a party at your home or the normal bar enclosure, these stirrers look different and are sure to catch the eye, says a spokesperson for the store.

 What

 Stirrers with animal and 

 fruit-shaped crowns

 Where

 Giggles on Park Street

 How much

 Rs 20 to Rs 25 each

The stirrers, about seven inches in length, come adorned with adorable animal-shaped and fruit-shaped motifs at the top. It is a complete animal kingdom, where the birdie clan rules.

 While the parrot with its curved tail all in green and a bright red beak looks stylish enough, Mr Cuckoo looks attractive with a jet black body strikingly combined with fluorescent orange wings, tiny claws, beak and a feathery crown. Also on offer are other crystal-clear bird stirrers. 

 A cute little red fish with its frilly tail jostles for attention too. Splashes of yellow at the tail make for the complete effect. The blue dolphin stirrer is also worth a look.

 The fruit-shaped ones will surely score with nature lovers. A yellow banana, ripe mangoes, tomatoes and a green pineapple, they all stand out because of their detailing. And if romance is in the air, stirrers with bright red hearts on top could be your pick.

 The store is home to a shorter variety of stirrers, too. They are also embellished with animal motifs. A textured glass body adds to the appeal.

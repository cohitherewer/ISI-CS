 What: Musical Landscape of Poland. 

 Where: Kala Mandir.

 When: Thursday evening.

 Tune in: It began suddenly. After the lighting of the 

 ceremonial lamp by Dr Krysztof Majka, ambassador of Poland, 

 the powerful notes of I. Wioenioskis flute 

 burst upon the audience, quivering, strangely uplifting 

 and vibrating with the music of Polish life.

 Organised by the Sangeet Natak 

 Akademi, the ministry of culture, the ministry of foreign 

 affairs of Poland, ministry of culture and national heritage 

 of Poland and the embassy of Poland, New Delhi, in association 

 with the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, the concert was 

 part of Days of Poland in India, a festival celebrating 

 the bond between the two countries.

 Featuring celebrated composer 

 Krzesimir Debski, singer Anna Jurksztowicz, The 

 Strings quartet and Turnioki, a folk group whose 

 music blends the tunes of Polish highlanders with rock, 

 pop, reggae, funky and jazz, the concert echoed with the 

 rhythms of the Polish countryside and its people.

 The music was a rich blend of 

 the traditions of north and south Poland, of classical and 

 contemporary music. From the controlled rise and fall of 

 the violin recital Country in E, by The Strings, 

 to Turniokis more energetic Zbojnicka Melodyjka, 

 the Highland robbers melody, the English 

 Autumn Leaves (the Polish autumn being singer 

 Anna Jurksztowiczs favourite time of the year) 

 and Piesn Heleny or Helenas song, 

 Debskis hit from the Polish film Ogniem I Mieczem 

 (With Fire and Sword). 

 The music was simple, echoing 

 the sounds of nature, of gurgling mountain springs and the 

 wind passing through trees, but it was so vibrant that even 

 the language barrier seemed to dissolve. Combined with some 

 energetic dance and Debskis anecdotes, the 

 audience was transported to a cosy highland tavern as they 

 clapped and tapped their feet.

 The highlight of the concert was 

 a song remembering Polish singer Hanka Ordonowna and her 

 work in India.

 Specially for the concert, The 

 Strings played Indyjski or a folk tune from south 

 India, replacing the shehnais and pipes with violin, 

 while the wooden base of the violin served as the mridangam 

 and ghatam.

 The concerts surprise was 

 Jurkstowiczs rendition of Dil tadap tadap 

 ke.., the hit song from Madhumati, chosen for 

 its similarity with the old Polish song Szla dzieweczka 

 do laseczka (A girl was walking into the forest). 

 There was a marked Polish accent, but Jurksztowicz 

 did not miss a cue, either in tune or emotions.

 The concert ended just as it had 

 started, without a preamble.

 Voiceover: Polish music is very simple, compared 

 to Indian music. We have very few notes. But it is lively. 

 For this performance I chose compositions to give the audience 

 in India a feel of the variety in Polish music, said 

 Debski.

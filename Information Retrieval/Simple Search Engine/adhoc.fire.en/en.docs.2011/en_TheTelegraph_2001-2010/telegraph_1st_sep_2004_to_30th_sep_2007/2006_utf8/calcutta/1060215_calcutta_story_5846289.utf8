The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 At the eastern entry/exit point of Park Circus railway 

 station on the Sealdah South section, a no-parking signboard 

 has been recently put up. However, it doesn?t mention the 

 agency which has installed it. Since fewer buses and autorickshaws 

 are stopping near the sign, commuters are having to walk 

 quite a distance and at times, even cross the tracks to 

 reach the combined platform. Civic engineers should work 

 out a better alternative so that people entering the station 

 from the eastern side are saved the inconvenience. 

 Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar. 

 It has become routine for BSNL to send bills to its landline 

 subscribers just a few days before the payment due date. 

 My latest bill was dispatched by CalTel on January 25 and 

 was received by me on February 4. Since the due date was 

 on February 6, I had to hurry and cancel other urgent work 

 so that I could make the payment in time. Is this a deliberate 

 ploy of BSNL to force subscribers to opt for the electronic 

 clearance system? 

 Animesh Chakravorty, 

 Kanungo Park. 

 Baranagar municipal authorities are careless about wastage 

 of water from roadside stand pipes under their jurisdiction. 

 Water has been flowing continuously from one such pipe near 

 my residence for quite a few days. I request the municipality 

 to immediately curb the wastage. 

 Prity Nandi,

 Baranagar.

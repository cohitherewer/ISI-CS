This is not a point of arrival, but a new start. 

We need to keep rolling and this is the path our family wishes to follow in the 

next 40 years.

The words of Luciano Benetton, chairman of the 1.8 

billion Euro-turnover Benetton empire, not only provided the opening bars of the 

brands 40th anniversary celebrations at the Forum of Centre Pompidou in 

Paris, but also traced the contours of the groups core philosophy, that 

of unflagging reinvention.

October 10 marked the first occasion when Benetton 

creations appeared on the catwalk, and the setting couldnt have been more 

fitting. The Centre Pompidou, a revolutionary edifice, provoked fierce controversy 

when inaugurated in 1977 with its crazy architecture, but has since been rapidly 

adopted by Parisians and tourists alike, attracting over five million visitors 

every year.

There was no controversy last Tuesday, only warm embrace. 

The City of Lights and the global fashion capital joined representatives from 

world media to marvel at the Benetton extravaganza, as top models showcased a 

cool styling for both the elegant and casual outfits of the autumn-winter collection, 

always with a leitmotif of colour, dynamism and internationality.

The contrast in styles when one walks from the Marais 

 the bourgeois and bohemian quarters of Paris to Les Halles is astonishing. 

A few metres from the 16th-century mansion houses, the brightly coloured glass-and-steel 

bulk of the Centre Pompidou, which seems to keep a watch over the centuries, played 

host to a vibrant and diverse montage of Benettons colours united.

Our creations are inspired by dreams, 

the chairman told The Telegraph, and the Pompidou carousal re-imagined 

and gave a fresh life to the traditional Benetton emphasis on wool, colour and 

fine tailoring. The show stressed the movement and texture of woven yarns to convey 

exuberance and harmony, and the optimistic use of pure colours to lift the 

spirits.

A brand that looks to the future while preserving 

its strong multi-ethnic and global vision, Benettons Paris show upheld 

the groups belief, in sync with the Bauhaus and De Stijl artists, that design 

can unite the world via an international visual language. On show were forms and 

colours that evoked pre-modern traditions from Japan to Scandinavia.

Vibrant yellows, oranges, reds, greens and turquoises 

were emphasised by their juxtaposition with neutral shades. The possibilities 

of wool to stretch and morph and wrap in softness were freely explored and 

expanded by adventurous detailing. Silhouettes were exaggerated, hugging the body 

and masking it, making shadows unrecognisable.

The post-catwalk high-point of the evening attended 

by celebs and fashion icons of Paris was provided by veteran rock 

roll artiste, poet and balladeer Pattie Smith, a surprise guest unveiled 

by the Benetton family during the five-course, sit-down Italian dinner. Smith 

of Piss Factory fame ignited the occasion with her impromptu, yet power-packed 

short acoustic set, followed on stage by a host of jazz and soul performers.

The Centre Pompidou was also the venue of the multi-form 

exhibition of Benettons communication research wing Fabrica Les yeux 

ouverts put together by the Centre and on till November 6, presenting a 

number of Fabricas major projects.

Staged in parallel with a cycle of musical performances 

and film screenings, and divided into four zones, it provided an insight into 

the tremendous creativity of Fabrica, an institution dedicated to redefining 

the boundaries between art and communication.

The first zone was devoted to Fabricas core 

interest, visual communication, with graphics, photography and video all drafted 

into the service of its partners, among them public institutions and NGOs like 

SOS Racisme and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation), besides UN agencies. 

This section presented two global media campaigns Violence for WHO 

and Food for Life for the World Food Programme.

The second zone investigated the global vision that 

characterises Fabricas activities, with photo-reportage from all over the 

world, each on a different theme (family, death, the climate, energy) grouped 

together under the title I See.

This section also presented a project with Reporters 

Sans Frontieres Colors Notebook offering a chance to reach out to those who 

generally have none, bringing together in writing accounts of themselves by people 

from the remotest corners of the planet or in places where freedom of expression 

is under threat.

The third zone presented experimental interactive 

projects developed by Fabrica teams engaging both the mind and the senses, encouraging 

visitor participation and dialogue. 

The fourth and last zone took a look at Fabrica itself, 

with a virtual tour of the buildings and a series of video self-portraits by those 

involved.

Directorspeak 

RENZO DI RENZO, CREATIVE DIRECTOR OF 

FABRICA, BENETTONS COMMUNICATION RESEARCH CENTRE, ON REALISM, RAY AND MORE

What is the high point of the Paris exhibition?

First of all, the fact itself that we can have this 

exhibition: this is already a great result. Not everybody can have the honour 

to be invited by a great institution like the Centre Pompidou to do an exhibition.

Have Fabricas communication tools changed 

dramatically in recent years with the convergence in information technology?

The world has changed so much in the last years, and 

so has the life of everyone. Of course Fabrica pays great attention to what happens 

around us. The title of the exhibition is clear: Les yeux ouverts means 

Eyes wide open eyes that look into the present and the future. This 

was also the reason why Fabrica was created to constantly research new ways 

of communication.

In always searching for fresh vehicles to reach 

out and connect with landmark global events and burning issues, is Fabrica evolving 

into a new-age media resource centre as well?

I consider Fabrica as a big editorial centre. We produce 

content no matter if this will become an advertising page, a book, 

a music project, a website, an interactive installation. We say: Ideas first. 

What comes after is just a technical way to translate ideas into reality.

With the diverse elements of photography, design, 

cinema, music, publishing and other mediums, what are the areas in India where 

you think the agency can work? Any concrete leads on that?

Fabrica is an independent republic of creativity. 

We pay a lot of respect to the difference of the cultures but we are not used 

to splitting the people by countries. Anyway, I think India as well as other countries 

 especially the ones the western world considers the developing world 

 have great potential. And I think that the better ideas will come from there 

in the future. We have no specific project at the moment, but I hope to have the 

chance to do something sooner or later.

Calcutta has a great history in parallel cinema. 

Is there any plan to connect with that genre and the city?

As you know, there is a direct connection between 

Indian and Italian cinema. Satyajit Ray was influenced by Italian neo-realism. 

I consider him one of the greatest film directors in the world. 

At Fabrica, we pay great attention to the films of 

the south and east of the world. We have co-produced films made by directors from 

Iran, Bosnia, China, Turkey, Cote dIvore, Tajikistan, Thailand, Brazil...

We also won an Oscar with No Mans Land 

by Danis Tanovic. Unfortunately, we have not produced one from India. Maybe not 

yet....

 Joychandi Hills

 One of nature?s wonders awaits you at Joychandi Hills, a stone?s throw from Ayodhya Hills. Staggering rock formations shoot up from nowhere to take your breath away. This part of Purulia is not as well known as Ayodhya Hills, but is just as beautiful. 

 Only local trains pass through the nearest railway station, also called Joychandi. The best way to reach the hills is to get down at Adra. The trains from Howrah reach early in the morning. Buses and autorickshaw are available from Adra to Raghunathpur. The journey takes around 15 minutes.

 On the border of Raghunathpur is Nanduara, a village virtually at the foothills. The winding road through the hamlet leads to a wide open space bordered by the three major hills of the area ? Joychandi, Dakshinakali or Kalipahar, and Jugadhal (dhal means slope).

 To reach the top, one must be adept at rock-climbing. In fact, many people come here to hone their rock-climbing skills. However, a concrete staircase has been built on the slope of Joychandi Hills for pilgrims headed for the Chandimata temple. A stone idol was once worshipped in the dilapidated structure. It has recently been replaced with a deity brought from Varanasi.

 The top of the hills offers a wonderful view of the plains of Purulia, including the Santhal villages. Huge boulders hover over most of the houses. The residents of Nanduara spend their days in constant fear of a rockslide.

 Of the three hills, Jugadhal is the tallest. During the British era, a court used to be convened at the top of the hill. Those sentenced to death were pushed down the slope!

 In February, a week-long mela is held at the foot of Joychandi Hills. People from different parts of the districts congregate here to offer puja to goddess Chandimata.

 Satyajit Ray shot certain portions of Hirak Rajar Deshe, the sequel to Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, around Joychandi Hills in 1978. He was looking for a typical Bengali village surrounded by hills. In Nanduara, you are likely to come across many villagers who still remember the day they ran away from school to watch the great director in action.

 - Business family scion hangs himself in extramarital dispute

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An extramarital relationship drove the scion of a business family to suicide and triggered the arrest of the actress he was allegedly involved with.

 Arun Barik, 51-year-old son of the owner of Bijoli Grill catering, hanged himself with a sari from the ceiling fan in his bedroom late on Thursday at his Hazra Road residence.

 Small-time actress Rita Debnath, 40-year-old resident of Shyampukur, was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged by Barik?s wife Madhumita for abetting the suicide.

 ?We arrested the woman, who is a spinster, because the complainant?s allegation corroborated our findings in the course of our preliminary investigation,? said an officer of Tollygunge police station.

 Police said Barik had been drawn to Rita around 10 years ago. 

 ?A father of two, he first came in touch with Rita while making an ad film for his agency. Since then, they had been in a relationship,? said the officer.

 On Thursday, Barik left home around 7 pm and went to a friend?s house in the same locality for a round of cards.

 ?He received a call from Rita on his mobile phone around 8.30 pm. His friends confirmed that he was looking disturbed after the call. They even heard him saying, ?Aami tomake biye korte parbo na? aar tumio aar kono din amar mukh dekhte pabe na (I can?t marry you? and you will never see me again)?.?

 According to his friends, Barik left the place immediately after the call. Madhumita later told police he reached home and quietly locked himself in his room.

 When he did not open the door for an hour and a half, family members started banging on the door. But to no avail.

 ?They then broke down the door and found him hanging from the iron rod of the ceiling fan, with a sari tied round his neck. They brought him down and called a local physician, who declared him dead,? said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 Madhumita went to Tollygunge police station early on Friday and lodged a complaint, accusing Rita of abetment to suicide.

 In the course of preliminary investigation, police ascertained that Barik had been trying to distance himself from Rita.

 ?His wife confirmed that she had had a quarrel with Barik recently and that he was wanting to end his relationship with Rita,? said an officer working on the case.

 But Rita, claimed the complaint, was refusing to let go. This, said police, could have driven Barik to his death.

 Drills, parade to keep firemen fit

Rathin Das: How do the firemen spend their time when there is no fire?

 The firemen would fail to serve you if they are allowed to spend their duty hours relaxing. Every fireman has to follow a tight schedule. Apart from fighting fires, they have to parade and practise drills and rescue operations to retain fitness. In addition, they have to keep the equipment in proper condition. After returning from a fire, the firemen clean the tenders and pipes. 

 I would like to point out in this connection that after a fire alarm is sounded, a fireman gets only 30 seconds to take up his position in the tender. He is answerable for any delay.

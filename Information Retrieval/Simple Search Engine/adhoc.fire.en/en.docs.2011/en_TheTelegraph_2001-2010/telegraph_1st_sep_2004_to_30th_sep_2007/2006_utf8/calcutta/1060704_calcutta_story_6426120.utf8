 Upgrade for civic clinics 

 - Tie-up with companies to get modern equipment, specialists

 SANJAY MANDAL

 As a first step towards implementing public-private partnership (PPP) in healthcare, the Left Front board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has joined hands with corporate firms to renovate the civic maternity clinics.

 The collaboration is primarily aimed at upgrading infrastructure of the clinics. Talks have been held with a company involved in several infrastructure projects in the city. A voluntary organisation in south Calcutta has been approached to take over a unit.

 ?We have held talks with a company for upgrade of a maternity unit. We will provide the infrastructure, while the private party will bring in expertise and equipment to make the clinic state-of-the-art. If the project is successful, the model will be replicated in the other civic health units,? said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 The Champamani maternity unit on Christopher Road is the clinic where the model will be tried out, revealed civic officials. 

 According to the mayor, once the PPP model is implemented, the maternity units will run in cross-subsidy mode. ?We have sought suggestions from private organisations on how to develop and modernise these clinics.?

 With private hospitals such as Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre providing high-end maternity healthcare, the revamped CMC units will cater to the medium and low-end segment, said health department officials. 

 After the Christopher Road clinic, the CMC maternity units at Darjipara, Garden Reach and Kidderpore are in line for a revamp. They have 20-30 bed capacities and very basic facilities. Each clinic has about three doctors and three nurses but no anaesthetists, a must for surgery.

 ?Once a doctor or nurse is on leave, the workload of the other staff members multiply, often triggering a crisis,? said a civic official. ?The doctors are trained in gynaecology. But there are no super specialists.?

 The maternity clinics also lack modern facilities in neo-natal care and diagnostics. 

 The private partners will instal ultra sonogram, X-ray and other diagnostic equipment. Neo-natal care and paediatric departments would also be set up.

 ?Specialist doctors and anaesthetists would be roped in. The existing staff would be transferred to other centres,? said a CMC official.

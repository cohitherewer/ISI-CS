 What: Opening of Marrakesh, the lounge at Cinnamon.

 Where: Cinnamon at 24, Park Street.

 When: Saturday, 9 pm onwards.

 The bash: Even though football frenzy has gripped the city and its a tall order to get the men (and a few women, too) anywhere away from the telly post 6.30 pm, there was a good turnout at the opening of the lounge on Saturday. The crowd was an interesting mix; actors, musicians, socialites and faces from the fashion industry brushed shoulders with the white-collared. 

 Two veiled women stood at the entrance, welcoming the guests. The decor of the place has a Moroccan feel. Hip Pocket set the mood early in the evening with some great music and jamming. The crowd lapped up the music, before moving on to the well-stocked bar as the night grew old. The party continued till about 2 am, with the resident DJ keeping the tempo up.

 Spotted: Designer Agnimitra Paul was one of the first to walk in a few minutes after nine, but disappeared early too. Faces from Tollywood included Rimjhim, June, Chandreyee, Deboleena, Komolika and Rituparna. Musician Bikram Ghosh along with wife Jaya came and left early. 

 The entire gang of city models was present ? Jessica, Pamela, Ishika, Neeraj, Tina and others. Chef Shaun Kenworthy dropped in with wife Pinky.

 Sip bite: The free-flowing wine and mocktails as well as the finger foods ? Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Marrakesh Open Pizza in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian varieties, Bekti Paupiettes and Lamb Pies ? were yummy. 

 Dinner was a lavish spread at the adjoining restaurant, comprising Lentil Soup, Fried Rice, Baked Fish, Mutton Roghan Josh, Hot Gulab Jamuns and Mango Mousse.

 Voiceover: We aim to attract the corporate crowd and other high-profile people to spend quality time after work. Unlike nightclubs with loud sounds, the music here is mostly soft, from the 60s and 70s, said Ashish Chakraborty, director of Cinnamon.

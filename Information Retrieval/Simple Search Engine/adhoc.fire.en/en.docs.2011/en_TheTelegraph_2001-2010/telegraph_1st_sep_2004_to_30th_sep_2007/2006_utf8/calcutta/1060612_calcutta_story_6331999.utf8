 Even twins dont have the 

 same skin? reads a signboard just outside a Ponds 

 Institute counter, urging you to step in for a complete 

 skin analysis. A trained skin consultant then takes over, 

 employing an advanced skin analyser to check certain attributes 

 of skin health.

 What is checked is the degree 

 of moisture, melanin, wrinkles, spots or blemishes, pores 

 and roughness. The results are then compared with the averages 

 for Indian women (as determined by an extensive research).

 The skin consultant then readies 

 a comprehensive beauty regimen, backed by the skin analysers 

 findings. 

 That, in a nutshell, is the idea 

 behind a Ponds Institute counter, an approximately 

 three ft-by-four ft shop-in-shop.

 There are currently five such 

 counters in Calcutta, a market that Ashok Venkatramani, 

 VP of Skin, Hindustan Lever Limited, sees as undoubtedly 

 crucial, both in terms of sheer usage of beauty products 

 as well as awareness.

 The Calcutta counters are set 

 up in beauty stores like Nabarupa in Gariahat, Model Museum 

 on Bidhan Sarani, Behala Gift House in Behala, Shaw Brothers 

 and Mondal Cosmetics in New Market. 

 l these counters will be headed 

 by skin consultants, groomed at and part of a 21-day training 

 module on skin care.

 After establishing a strong hold 

 on the Indian mass market, an international 

 range from Ponds saw a big rollout from Mumbai and 

 Delhi last month.

 We will build on the brand 

 equity that already exists. Having said that, the current 

 range that addresses a larger market bears no connection 

 with the international range. They are unrelated categories 

 with separate target consumers, explains Venkatramani.

 So far, the response has been 

 great and has surpassed the companys 

 expectations. The average value of sales and also 

 the number of pieces sold per day reinforce our belief that 

 the Indian market is evolving and the consumer is looking 

 at better-value products, says Venkatramani.

 These better-value products 

 can largely be split into three categories: Botanical Hydration, 

 Double White, and Age Solution. Age Solution, in turn, has 

 two ranges ? Early Defence Range (for women between 25 and 

 35) and Renewal Lift Range (for the 35-plus). 

 The Botanical Hydration range 

 boasts a cocktail of 10 active botanical ingredients like 

 camomile, wild thyme and aloe vera extract. Designed for 

 problem-free, younger skin, this range focuses on effective 

 and long-lasting hydration.

 The Double White range promises 

 to offer solutions for uneven, patchy skin. It claims to 

 clarify the skin by dispersing melanin for an 

 even tone and also remove the dullness of the face 

 caused by oxidation.

 Ponds Age Solution ranges 

 comprise skin renewal foam, cleansing milk lotion, toner, 

 intensive serum and separate day and night creams.

 so available are a Lip Renewal 

 and Lifting Lotion that reduces dryness and wrinkles on 

 the lips, eye gel to nourish the sensitive eye-area and 

 facial masks to fight sagging skin.

 Priced between Rs 200 and Rs 800, 

 most of the products come in complementary night action 

 versions as well.

 All for a dying art form

 The last of the female impersonators in commercial Bengali theatre, Chapal Bhaduri, returns to the stage in Nandipat?s Ramanimohan. The play, written by Shekhar Samaddar, seems almost made to order for Bhaduri, since it revolves around the fading fortunes of a retired thespian who used to make his living as the female lead in touring Jatra companies.

 The impoverished conditions of his life at present match the unhappy circumstances in which Bhaduri himself survives today. In addition, Samaddar?s protagonist faces the contempt of his son, whom he depends on for his daily means, and who bans him from acting as women on the grounds that it humiliates the family.

 Altruistically, director Prokash Bhattacharya helped Bhaduri out by offering him this part, and expanded the simple, rather sentimental tale to somehow meet the requirements of a full-scale production. But one can tell that the script is stretched thin virtually to the point of snapping. Only an objective view of the need to appreciate a dying art form keeps us interested in it, because there have been superior treatments of this theme previously.

 This very same objectivity unfortunately necessitates criticism of Bhaduri?s eponymous role. At the show I attended, his singing distressed everyone, to say the least. Time and again he broke the tala and never caught up with it. These things do happen, but not with such regularity. His female impersonations also looked tired, even exhausted, certainly not of the high quality that, in the drama, supposedly entrances the audience.

 In fact, he acted much more naturally as a man at home, as husband and father. And because Ramanimohan centres on him, the supporting cast?s abilities do not really count.

 I could not help comparing this version unfavourably with the original, by the obscure Tarun Natya Goshthi from Nabadwip, which had come to town two years ago. Their little-known director and leading man, Bapi Chakrabartti, had done an excellent job of performing and singing as Ramanimohan.

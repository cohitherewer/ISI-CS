The city last week was witness 

 to White Noise, a concert for a cause that is rarely taken 

 up and is in need of de-stigmatisation child sexual abuse. 

 It was organised by Elaan, a youth group formed in 2004 which works to spread awareness on child sexual abuse and incest.

 The concert featured alternative rock band Cassinis Division, upcoming punk rock band Hoof Hooey and rapper A-List. A number of factors relating to child sexual abuse that require mass support were presented to the audience, through announcements, speeches by performing artistes, posters and T-shirt campaigns. A signature campaign for a law against child sexual abuse was also conducted.

 Child sexual abuse remains an issue we are all afraid to deal with. With this concert we wanted to get people to spare a thought about the problem. Child sexual abuse is essentially the termination of a childs innocence, said Rahul Guha Roy, singer and lyricist of Cassinis Division.

 Artiste A-List performed a number written for the occasion. The song The Real Story was about the trauma sexual abuse victims go through.

 The concert was an attempt to wake up society to the fact that child sexual abuse exists, that it can be tackled. We wanted to say that the issue does not have to be shoved under the carpet, said Pranaadhika, founder of Elaan.

 A classic act

 With the objective of bringing the GeNext in touch with the classics of drama, theatre group Lime Lights will stage Bernard Shaws Arms and the Man at Kala Mandir on December 6. Having staged the play in Delhi, director Kona Roy, former senior headmistress of Modern School, New Delhi, now brings it to audiences in Calcutta. 

 The cast, mostly comprising students, includes Anupam Dhar of St Xaviers College, who plays Sergius with earthy vivacity, while Raina, his love object, is played by Samya Kapoor, niece of painter Wasim Kapoor. Debarshi Dutta, who works at National Institute for Excellence in Telecommunications, plays Petkoff with a burly laugh. Iftekar Ahsan, who had earlier performed with Theatrician in Asif Currimbhoys Goa, does a man-of-the world Bluntschli. Louka is played by Debarati Mukherjee of St Xaviers College.

 The cast went through a three-month workshop with Roy where they trained in speech, diction, posture and body language.

 Our voice

 BBC is connecting youngsters worldwide through its boldest international broadcasting season to date. BBC World is joining BBC World Service and bbcnews.com to present nine days of special programming (till December 10) devoted to the voices, experiences, ideas and aspirations of young people from around the globe.

 One of the highlights of the season is School Day 24, an interactive platform for young people across the world, which links schools in political hot spots with those in areas with opposing views. On December 6, they will be able to talk across social, political and cultural divides about the issues that concern them on television, radio as well as online.

 There will be link-ups in Albania, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, the US and other countries. Satellite broadcasting equipment has been installed in schools to enable teenagers to make themselves heard throughout the day both in their own countries and worldwide.

 attend the closing ceremony as Calcutta Girls High School 

 celebrates its 150th year at the Science City auditorium

 THE DIARY

 ..Me, my comrade

 Prolonged shrieks endorse the 

 wrongs,

 justifying the spasmodic time.

 Polluted thoughts dig our brain,

 techno-trance, addiction and crime.

 Nights drowned in coloured water,

 where sex and lies, get videotaped,

 each day our reasons get remixed,

 and philosophies are flouted and raped.

 My dreams are weathered and cliched,

 yet they are eager to roar,

 Together we dreamt of changed times,

 Comrade, dont you dream like before?

 Archan Bhattacharya,

 A puzzle

 Shredded and shrivelled 

 The leaves fell scattered 

 All around the graveyard 

 Among the buried dead... 

 They fell like the pieces of a puzzle 

 Words unknown and tales untold 

 Legends just carried over generations 

 Whispered among the young and old... 

 The wind blows them separate 

 Some fly off to places unknown 

 While some lie a stones throw away... 

 Another gust of wind 

 Blows them a stretch further... 

 Some disappear in the desert 

 Some sink in the sea 

 While some are lost forever 

 Lost in the depths of darkness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High fives and faves 

 Fancy footwork and tough 

 tackles at Shootout 06, the TTIS soccer meet,

 It is not only the nerves of those 

 watching the World Cup on television that are getting frayed. 

 The proceedings are equally hot at Shootout 06, The Telegraph 

 In Schools (TTIS) five-a-side school football 

 tournament at CC amp;FC, which entered the knock-out level 

 on June 27. Several teams established themselves as contenders 

 in the aftermath of the group level, but one player has 

 truly stamped his authority on the tournament so far.

 Surajit Dey of Pearls of God school scored a jaw-dropping 17 (yes, you read it right) goals in three matches, 10 more than any of the other contenders. Dey propelled his team into the knock-out level of the main plate competition. ?The performance that I am most proud of was against Saint Sebastian?s, when I scored six goals, a double hat-trick!? beamed Dey. Pearls of God adopted the Brazilian national strip for their team, and certainly did the colours justice in the opening matches.

 It was, however, not meant to be, with the Brazilians of Ballygunge crashing out 2-1 in their first knock-out match against La Martiniere for Boys, who look as though they will make a convincing bid for this year?s title. Another serious contender this year must surely be North Point School, Dum Dum, who beat a spirited Future Hope School 2-0. St James Public School beat Albany Hall 3-2 in one of the more hotly contested matches on Tuesday afternoon.

 The enthusiasm of the games played in the losers plate was indistinguishable from that of the games in the main tournament, with Armenian College establishing themselves as the Italians of the tournament. With bruising tackles and serious pace, their defence was virtually impenetrable. St Augustine?s had little in reply to the moves of Armenian College and were eventually beaten 2-1.

 The prize for this year?s most raucous celebrations can only go to one team: Calcutta Boys? School. After beating St Xavier?s in the losers plate, the primal screams of celebration were so extraordinary in tone that everybody on surrounding pitches turned around expecting to see a scene from Gorillas in the Mist. Surajit Dey of the eliminated Pearls of God now has to sit and wait to see if any other players will beat his whopping 17 goals in the remaining matches. Dey and his teammates are confident that they he will go on to become player of the tournament.

Stage study

 From Day One itself, there was 

 a surprising camaraderie amongst the participants at the 

 Theatrecian theatre workshop. Prior to the two-hour sessions, 

 all of us were complete strangers. Yet, it took very little 

 time for us youngsters to get comfortable with each other. 

 Two of the participants, Kabir and Mohit, are students who 

 have come all the way from Boston.

 Faculty member-cum-participant Diya is a dancer with the Rhythmusic Dance Company. She persuaded us into attempting choreographed performances. Another faculty member, Payal, had the difficult task of sorting out our movements. Acting in front of camera was a crucial part of this workshop, and it helped clear much of the false notions that we had earlier. Most of us were earlier under the impression that acting in films was far easier than theatre. Film-maker Tathagatha Bhattacharya quickly rid us of this assumption, as he taught us the technical basics of acting in front of camera.

 Our play 45-minute play, 64 Squares, comprising of many skits, will be staged at Padatik on June 29. Whatever we have learned will be there for all to see.

My Kindred

 2006 has been declared the Year of the Girl Child, yet hundreds of girls in our country are being physically and mentally abused every day. Most of these crimes go unnoticed as the victims lack the courage to speak out. If even one of these victims fights for justice, million others will follow. This is a dedication to all those girls.

 I have been running for miles 

 Amongst the cryptic words.

 I need to sit down and muse

 At every corner of the road,

 But I don?t. 

 I just hold onto my dreams

 And run.

 I hold up my scarred heart to be explored

 And envisage a million hands to be joined with mine.

 I am not afraid of facing the consequences ?

 Of being buried in wrath ?

 Tied up, beaten, hated?.

 All I want is your dream to be

 My paraphernalia ? 

 My courage ? 

 My hope to carve out a 

 Million other MEs. 

 I have still a hundred miles to cover

 But I know behind me?

 There are my MEs ?

 Fighting against the strangulation of their tender spirits.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 100-acre venue for fairs

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 As the debate over the right venue for fairs in Calcutta continues, the state government is drawing up plans for a 100-acre fairground-cum-convention centre at New Town, Rajarhat.

 The government is in the process of setting up a permanent fairground near Chingrihata, on EM Bypass. 

 We will build an international-standard exhibition ground and convention centre in Rajarhat. Construction will start this winter, stated Goutam Deb, minister in charge of departments of housing and public health engineering, after inaugurating Consumer Fair 2006 at the Bidhannagar fairground on Central Park. 

 In an open tender, Bengal Unitech Universal a joint venture of Delhi-based realty major Unitech and Universal Success Group, promoted by NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee has been selected as the developer of the showpiece project at New Town. 

 Though Deb declined to comment on the project cost, sources suggested that the developer will pump in over Rs 100 crore into the fairground, billed as the first of its kind in this part of the country. 

 Not just a permanent structure for holding fairs, the 100-acre compound will also include conference halls, guest house, library, shopping malls and convention centres, added Deb. The minister was the chief guest at the 12th edition of Consumer Fair, an annual feature in the Confederation of Indian Industrys (CII) calendar. 

 Last year, the fair was held on the Maidans and drew over 1.5 lakh visitors. With fairs barred on the patch of the green at the heart of the city, the organisers had to shift to Salt Lake this year. 

 We do not think that the change in venue will have significant impact on the footfall. We expect a good turnout, said Sunil Misra, regional director, CII. 

 The fair will continue till October 18 and over 100 companies from private and public sector banks to beauty product companies and consumer durable majors to insurance firms are taking part in the week-long event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sleuths tighten the Net

 - First chargesheet in cyber crime case with Interpol aid

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will file its first chargesheet in a cyber crime case on Monday. The case, involving two senior engineers of a central government undertaking accused of harassing a woman colleague, was cracked with help from Interpol.

 Neelu Sherpa, in charge of the CID?s cyber crime wing, told Metro: ?This is the first time we are filing a chargesheet in a cyber crime case. To ensure a speedy trial, the charges will be registered with a fast-track court.?

 An investigating officer said the victim, a 37-year-old engineer with Balmer Lawrie and Company, had lodged a complaint with the CID on August 29, 2005, alleging that she was getting unwanted calls and that people were even coming to her house with indecent proposals.

 The engineer, mother of a four-year-old daughter, said she was on the verge of committing suicide.

 Investigations revealed that someone had posted her residential address and phone number, along with a semi-nude photograph of a model, on some pornographic websites. A statement ? ?I am a housewife based in Calcutta. My husband is staying abroad and I am sexually unsatisfied. Good-looking men can call me on this number between 11 am to 5 pm? ? was also attributed to her.

 ?People from across the world ? including the US, UK and West Asia ? started calling her. Some even visited her at home,? the officer added.

 The sleuths hired computer experts, who found that the culprits had posted the woman?s details after creating a false ID through a server in the US. ?We approached Interpol for information about the server and the place where the site was created. After five months of investigation, we zeroed in on two of her colleagues ? Arindam Basu and Amit Saxena ? and raided their offices. Their computers were seized and we stumbled upon evidence pointing to their involvement in the crime,? another officer explained.

 Sherpa said: ?The two engineers planned to harass their woman colleague out of jealousy. One of the accused is a gold medallist in computer science.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeout

 An illustrious journey

 From the turmoil of the 1857 uprising, through the nationalist movement and independence, to the political unrest of the 1960s and 1970s, and the current threats of terrorism and religious intolerance, the Calcutta Police (which came into being in 1856) has constantly evolved and been on the move; modernising, improving and updating its skills, procedures, systems and personnel. Working vigilantly and, often, way beyond its brief, it reaches out a helping hand to the citys denizens in times of their trouble. Swaroop Mukherjee has captured the eternal spirit of the Force through his brushstrokes, visualising the splendour of a crumbling edifice in as sharp detail as the vibrant energy of the men in uniform. As part of the celebrations to mark Calcutta Polices 150th year, governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi will unveil Mukherjees paintings on the Force and release Dynamic Force, a commemorative volume of his paintings and writings by Oindrilla Dutt on the landmark anniversary. Supported by National Insurance Company.

 Event: Launch of Dynamic Force, a book of paintings and writings to mark 150 years of Calcutta Police

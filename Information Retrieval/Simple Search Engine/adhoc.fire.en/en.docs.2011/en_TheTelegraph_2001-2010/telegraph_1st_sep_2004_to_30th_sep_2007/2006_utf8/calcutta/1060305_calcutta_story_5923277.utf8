The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Play in the V or value-add 

 With cricket more than just a game, every trick of the trade is being used to grab the eyeballs that wander

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It is no longer just a game. Much as we the general public applaud a Pathan wicket in Lahore or a Dhoni sixer in Karachi, there is much more at stake in a cricket match than the sporting contest between the teams. Millions are spent to buy the television rights with the hope of making few more millions by selling the commercial time for advertising. The advertisers who buy the time in turn want hundreds of millions of eyeballs to see their ads. The ups and downs of the cricket battle are thus mere means to an end. Gone are the days when they were the end in itself.

 As a business proposition, this is a scary pitch. True, advertising space is bought in advance and low TRP of a match does not result in any refund of the advertising money. At the same time, the rights to telecast are usually bought on a long-term basis. So when the word gets around, the advertising time in the next series becomes that much more difficult to sell. The rights holder desperately seeks insurance. The only route to ensure the eyeball numbers is by adding value to the telecast. The arena of value addition can not obviously involve the cricket on the ground. Because TRPs are dropping during the match, they can hardly ask Dravid to retire temporarily and send in Pathan or Dhoni.

 Initially, the augmentation efforts had concentrated on the visual experience of cricket ? slow motion replays and multi-angle shots. Unfortunately, these have now become par for the course. The efforts are now moving towards the shows put up before and after the match and during the breaks. It is here that the business of cricket telecasting may have got caught in a web. The audience of a cricket telecast is far from homogeneous. Perhaps the umbra is made up of the hardcore who can draw a distinction between playing square of the wicket and playing in the V. Unfortunately, they are small in number. More importantly, they hardly need any additional wooing.

 It is the penumbra that is vulnerable. The vast millions whose enjoyment from a cricket match is predicated on India winning or at least losing gamely. They get easily bored and move to another channel for immediate entertainment. Most of them are not as comfortable in English, thus the subtle joke from a Boycott or a Botham escapes their understanding. Imran Khan is (still) more appreciated for his looks than his cricket analysis.

 The cricket shows accompanying the match do not provide adequate attraction for the penumbra. So money is being spent on other things. Mandira Bedi in her spaghetti-top blouse (picture above) is the best medicine for their headache. They will not mind her asking a great cricketer whether he likes to eat palak paneer at lunch during a Test match.

 This Mandira Bedi model during the last World Cup in South Africa had got SET Max rich dividends in terms of TRP, especially during the matches that did not involve India. Curiously, other channels have resisted the temptation. They have concentrated on Imran and Gavaskar, Shastri and Wasim. The umbra has been kept happy. In the long run, this model could well be non-viable.

 But the solution may be in sight. Now that Doordarshan is a constant channel for cricket matches involving India, there will always be at least two channels beaming the matches. Maybe the time has come to segment the cricket audience. The penumbra could have all the fun (Mandi House permitting) and the umbra could have all the cricket.

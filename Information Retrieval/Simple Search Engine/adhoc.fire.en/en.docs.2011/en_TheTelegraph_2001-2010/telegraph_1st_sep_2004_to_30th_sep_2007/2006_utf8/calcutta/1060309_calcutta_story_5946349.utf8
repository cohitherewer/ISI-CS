The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Branded with the best 

 They will come together for the first time in Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna but Pradeep Sarkar got to direct Shah Rukh Khan and Abhishek Bachchan in two back-to-back commercials, writes Pratim D. Gupta

 Pradeep Sarkar

 His acceptance speeches may not do George Clooney proud but Pradeep Sarkar has managed to win many a heart every time he has walked up to receive an award for his directorial debut Parineeta. If he has forgotten to thank his big find, Vidya Balan, at some ceremony, he has made it up at the next awards do. He needn?t had worried because although there have been 28 directors making their first films in 2005, it would have taken a miracle to defeat ?Dada? in the Best Debut category.

 In between picking up his trophies, everywhere from Mumbai to Mauritius, Sarkar has been shooting commercials one after the other at break-neck speed. ?I have to keep making ads to survive. Making a movie meant low pay and a loss of eight months,? is the frank admission. So, before his next big screen wonder ? he will make it for Yash Raj Films this time ? it?s going to be ads and more ads for the big man from Mumbai.

 Sarkar, who is currently in town to shoot a commercial with Rani Mukherjee for Anu Sarees, has recently directed the likes of Virender Sehwag and Juhi Chawla. But he also got to call the shots when Shah Rukh Khan and Abhishek Bachchan faced the arclights. And this is what Dada felt about the big two.

 Shah Rukh Khan

 On Shah Rukh Khan

 I have shot so many ads for so many years but I never got to work with him. When the late Mukul Anand was making a commercial long back, I almost worked with Shah Rukh but finally it didn?t happen. So, I was looking forward to work with him for the Compaq commercial recently.

 After shooting the ad, let me tell you, Shah Rukh is in a different league altogether. He understands the brand so well and what exactly is needed from him. He wanted to know about the storyline and said that although the humour in the lines was fine we must be open for improvisations on the sets. And that?s exactly what happened ? we did a lot of spontaneous changes during the shoot.

 Another great thing about Shah Rukh is that he keeps rehearsing before giving the shot. He is so very professional. Between two shots, when the camera is being set up for the next shot, he would go and pose for the stills needed to be clicked for the product promotion.

 Abhishek Bachchan 

 On Abhishek Bachchan

 He is another person with whom I have never worked before on any commercial. So it was nice getting to work with him for a series of ads for LG products. Compared to Shah Rukh, Abhishek has just started brand endorsements and so it is something still very new to him.

 I found Abhishek very, very bindaas. He is professional in his own way ? serious when he is needed to be serious. Otherwise he is just so cool. And that is exactly what we have tried to capture in the LG commercials. The storyline of the ad is what all Abhishek would do to keep his wife happy.

 In fact, to capture his bindaas mood, we just kept the camera rolling even when we were not taking the pre-planned shots. And those are the shots we have kept in the final edited commercial.

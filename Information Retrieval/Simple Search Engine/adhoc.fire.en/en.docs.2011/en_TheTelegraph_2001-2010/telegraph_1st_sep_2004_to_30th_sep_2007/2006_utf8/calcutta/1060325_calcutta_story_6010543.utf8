The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 4-month deadline for beacon removal

 - GOVT MUST FILE COMPLIANCE REPORT

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Use and abuse, from a symbol of emergency 

 services to a beacon of special privileges

Calcutta High Court on Friday directed that the beacon be removed from vehicles not entitled to it in four months and the offenders be fined. The state government will have to file a compliance report on expiry of the deadline.

 Echoing an earlier order of the court, the bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly ruled: ?If it is found that beacons are used by persons who are not entitled to the same, the state authorities, including police and the motor vehicles department, must take stern action, including imposition of fines, against the offenders.?

 A similar directive had been issued by a bench comprising Justice T.K. Ganguly and Justice S.K. Tiwari in 1999, on a public interest litigation filed by a social organisation.

 ?It is unfortunate that police have failed to carry out the order in seven years. It?s a fact that even block development officers and panchayat members have installed beacons atop their cars. This should be stopped,? the division bench observed on Friday.

 Petitioner?s counsel Idris Ali submitted that the division bench of justices Ganguly and Tiwari had ordered the government to act against persons using the beacon illegally. ?But the authorities? failure to execute the order has prompted my client to move court again.?

 He alleged: ?The police department itself is a major violator, several Class I officers being among the offenders.? 

 Additional government pleader Debasish Kargupta, appearing for the state, assured the court that his client would take every possible step to curb illegal use of the beacon.

 ?Actions against the offenders are being taken. Police have already removed the red light from 17 cars,? he said, while submitting a report on the violators by deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

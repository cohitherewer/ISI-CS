 Love in the time of lust

 Sameera Reddy and Prosenjit, 

 who star in Buddhadeb Dasguptas next feature film 

 Buladi, Madhubala, a film-maker 

 who is a dwarf, two boys and a girl Buddhadeb Dasgupta 

 promises to weave an unusual tale in his film that goes 

 on the floors from Tuesday.

 Starring Prosenjit and Sameera Reddy, the Bengali feature film Two Boys and A Girl (working title) is being produced by Bag Films, the Delhi-based production house that churns out the popular STAR Plus soap Kumkum.

 Its a film on love, politics and our times, with three characters Dilip, Yasin and Rekha, says Dasgupta, who has been working on the script for the past year. The role of the main man went to Rahul Bose, then Jeet before finally falling into Prosenjits lap. Rahul wouldnt fit the bill of a middle-class khete khawa Bengali boy.... Prosenjit would suit it better and he is very talented, explains the director.

 The Tollywood star plays Dilip, a youth from the suburbs of Bengal who comes to Calcutta hoping to make a mark. Amitabha Bhattacharya, who has featured in a couple of Tollywood mainstream films, will be Yasin. Yasin plays the flute in the film and I chose Amitabha because he can play the instrument. You can always make out when one is faking the finger movements, adds Dasgupta, who has picked Bollywood beauty Sameera for the second time after Kaalpurush, which awaits its commercial release.

 Sameera is Rekha, an ordinary Bengali girl with dreams of making it big some day. She suited the role of a Bengali wife in Kaalpurush... The get-up will be slightly different here, he says.

 Buladi, mascot of West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, emerges as a flesh-and-blood character in the tale of two boys and a girl. TV actress Kamalika Banerjee will play the role.

 Theres a long discourse between Buladi and Dilip on love and relationships. Dilip stands out as he is a person for whom physicality (in a relationship) cannot be detached from love. The film explores how far he goes with this belief and how his surroundings respond to this, explains Dasgupta, seated at his Gol Park workstation.

 Among other curious features that find a place in the script is former screen goddess Madhubala. Madhubala, you can say, is my first love. She is an important character in the film and will come with the song Haal kaisa hai janab ka, explains Dasgupta in all seriousness while keeping the reason for the blast from the past under wraps.

 Tapas Pal, one of the two main actors in Dasguptas Uttara, will appear in a cameo. Sunny Joseph from Kerala will steer the camera; Rabindrasangeet singer Manisha Murali Nair has been roped in for the background score. Shooting starts from November 28 at the Bharat Laxmi studio on sets designed by Indranil Ghosh.

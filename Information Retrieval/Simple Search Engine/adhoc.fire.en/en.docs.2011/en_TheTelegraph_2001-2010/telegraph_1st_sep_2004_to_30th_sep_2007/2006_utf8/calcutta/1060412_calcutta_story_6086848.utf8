 Trade trust betrayed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Regular vigil by police is not enough to arrest the rising crime graph in the Burrabazar-Posta area. The traders there must also put their house in order and earn the loyalty of their staff.

 Investigations have revealed that poorly-paid employees often pass on to gangsters detailed information about how much money is kept in the iron chest of a shop or when it will be taken to the bank. Behind almost every incident of snatching or robbery in the trade turf, sleuths have found an insider?s hand.

 ?A section of employees, including peons and mutias (porters), regularly tips off criminals about the traders,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 ?Betraying the trust of their employers, they even pass on sensitive information like the amount of money stashed in the shops or when it will be deposited in the bank,? he added. ?We cracked a number of cases on the basis of statements provided by the employees during interrogation.?

 Agreeing with police, cloth merchant Surajmal Bhutra, general secretary of AV Market Association, on Mahatma Gandhi Road, said: ?The criminals develop contacts among poor porters in the area and use them as local operatives. At times, they also rope in employees who are not paid well.?

 Elaborating on the criminal-porter-employee nexus, Amit Pandey, assistant secretary of Burrabazar Nagarik Front, said: ?Most of the criminals are from Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa. The porters and a section of employees are also from these states. Criminals take advantage of this.?

 The traders have also come down on police inaction. ?Officers of the detective department?s anti-rowdy squad are supposed to patrol the locality. They do come here ? only to collect bribes, not to catch criminals,? said a trader on condition of anonymity.

 ?Police collect bribes from businessmen in four forms ? nazrana (gift), shukrana (for helping a businessman solve a problem), hakrana (pre-settled deal) and jabrana (forcible collection),? he added.

 Pandey had earlier asserted that the traders would put up resistance on their own, as police were of little help.

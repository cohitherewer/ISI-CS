 Bangla tips for couples in quarrel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Madhuchhanda Banerjee: Indian perspective

 It?s a must-have book for any couple. But so far, 25 Stupid Mistakes Couples Make was only available in one language. Publishers Tata McGraw Hill have decided to branch out into Bengali for the first time, with a book that hopes to bridge the language barrier by promising to patch up relationship problems.

 Doing the good deed was Madhuchhanda Banerjee. ?The original book was written by Dr Paul Coleman. Samparker Satkahan was supposed to be a translation. But it?s more an Indian adaptation, because I have used Indian case studies. The original is too westernised, so we reworked it with an Indian perspective,? says the 31-year-old.

 The freelance feature-writer for Anandalok magazine was approached by McGraw Hill, in collaboration with regional publisher Power Books, with two chapters to translate. Having passed the test, she took up the task of giving Calcutta couples relationship advice. The result was released on January 25.

 ?I worked on it for about four months, researching, observing and talking to people around me ? husbands and wives, live-in partners and lovers,? says she. ?Each problem we have listed has a solution, written in lucid language.?

 Another book, launched on January 30 and also available at the Tata McGraw Hill Ebar Banglay stall at the Book Fair, is Paramvir Chakra. Originally penned by Lt Col Kaushik Sarkar, Guts and Glory lists 21 recipients of the national bravery award. Through their lives, the history of India and wars are also explored. 

 Banerjee?s next book for the same publishing company is an Indian adaptation of Disease to Please by Harriet B. Braicher. ?It?s about the pleasing people syndrome. It?s a disease in some people. Trying too hard to please other people can affect your own health. This book tells you how much is OK and when to stop,? explains the author.

 For the past two months, Banerjee has been working on local case studies, using her own friends, family members and acquaintances for the case studies. ?This is just the beginning. There will be many more,? she signs off.

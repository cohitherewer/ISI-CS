The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Sorry, Mani Sir

Screen On amp; Off

 Calling the shots: Apara 

 Mehta

 Mani Ratnam is going through one of the most frustrating phases of his career. Ever since Viveik Oberoi walked out of his new Hindi film Guru ? starring Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai ? stars have been turning him down left, right and centre. After everyone from Saif Ali Khan to Kunal Kapoor turned him down, Mani Sir found his second lead in Madhavan.

 Now, Apara Mehta ? Savita of Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi ? has turned the film-maker down. She was slated to play Ash?s mother in the film. ?I called them up and told them that I can?t do the film as the dates are not working out,? Apara told Metro. ?They just told me to block dates between April 17 and 19. They didn?t specify my look or my role and I can?t give up all my TV assignments here for something so uncertain.?

 And that assignment happens to be playing Kaki on the Zee TV show Saat Phere. Kaki had wanted Nahar to marry a girl of her choice but with him marrying Saloni, her sole mission is to make life miserable for the new bride.

 According to the latest TAM ratings, STAR Ananda has emerged the second most watched channel on the Bengali small screen. While it is easily the most watched news channel, it has come runners-up to the general entertainment channel ETV Bangla.

 In Calcutta, STAR Ananda recorded a reach of 2,460,000, behind ETV Bangla?s 2,797,000 and ahead of Aakaash Bangla?s 2,423,000. STAR Ananda?s election-related programming has also been well received, with its array of special programmes for the Bengal Assembly elections receiving a big thumbs up from viewers. 

 This record showing for STAR Ananda comes on the heels of an impressive previous TAM week, where the channel had garnered ?50 per cent of the market share in Calcutta and 48 per cent in the rest of Bengal?.

 This April, television viewing becomes more exciting as viewers get a chance to win while they watch. Starting Monday, a contest will run with Miilee, STAR Plus, 9 pm, which brings goodies like five Sony handycams and 10 bags of goodies each day.

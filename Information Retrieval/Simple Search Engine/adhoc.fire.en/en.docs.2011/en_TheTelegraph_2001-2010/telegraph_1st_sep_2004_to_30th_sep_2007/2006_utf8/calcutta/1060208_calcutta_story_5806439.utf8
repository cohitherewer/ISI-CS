The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The introduction of Circular Railway at Majerhat is undoubtedly a welcome development. But it seems that that facility was introduced without much homework and commensurate upgrade in logistics. The Lake Gardens-New Alipore stretch still has a single track for passenger trains. Limited track availability is seriously affecting services of Sealdah and Budge Budge local trains, increasing the journey time in morning and evening rush hours. Since rail authorities have reclaimed the encroached land along Rabindra Sarobar, there should not be any problem now in laying more tracks for passenger trains between Lake Gardens and New Alipore.

 Most multi-national banks have phonebanking facilities for credit or debit cards. However, these helplines put the caller on hold for quite a few minutes before connecting to a customer care personnel. Sometimes, after waiting for a long time the line gets disconnected automatically. I have faced this problem time and again since I own a number of cards. The banks should improve their phonebanking services.

 The silt and waste cleared from the drains on Lower Rawdon Street are still lying by the roadside. Has the Corporation staff forgotten about it? If not removed from the spot, the muck will make its way back into the drain. The condition is equally bad on Lee Road and Justice Chandra Madhav Road. 

 S.S. Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street.

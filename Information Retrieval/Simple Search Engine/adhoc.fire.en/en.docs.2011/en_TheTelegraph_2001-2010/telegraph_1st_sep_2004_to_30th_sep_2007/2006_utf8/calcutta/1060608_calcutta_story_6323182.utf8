 Pageant on your phone

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Winners of the Miss 

 World 2005 pageant at the southern Chinese resort island 

 of Hainan 

 Imagine Aishwarya Rai, Diana Hayden, Yukta Mookhey or Priyanka Chopra on your mobile phone screen urging you to vote for them in their Miss World quest.

 That might not have been possible in their time, but much before the Miss World 2006 contest gets underway in Warsaw this September, mobile users around the world will get a chance to know all about the contestants and even vote for their favourites, on their cellphone.

 Mumbai-based mobile value-added services provider Mauj Telecom has tied up with the Miss World Organisation as its exclusive global mobile partner to provide contest highlights, contestant images and video profiles, audio and video ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers, themes, calendar applications and more.

 Miss World is one of the biggest global events and such a partnership is a first for an Indian company, said Dippak Khurana, regional head, India amp; Far East, Mauj Telecom.

 The finals of Miss World are viewed by over two billion in more than 200 countries. Mauj will deliver Miss World content to over 100 countries through 50-plus operators. We are looking at it as a global property and expect around 50 million downloads, Khurana said.

 Besides content from this years event, mobile users would also be able to access an archive of footage and photos from the past three years.

 Julia Morley, chairperson of Miss World Organisation, said: During the past 56 years we have worked to ensure that Miss World remains at the cutting edge of new developments. In recent years we have gone interactive and our phone and text vote has been a massive success. With this global content deal, Miss World fans around the globe will be able to get closer than ever before to the experience of our festival.

 India had a dream run at the pageant in the 1990s with winners including Aishwarya Rai (1994), Diana Hayden (1997), Yukta Mookhey (1999) and Priyanka Chopra in 2000. This years contestant would be Natasha Suri from Mumbai.

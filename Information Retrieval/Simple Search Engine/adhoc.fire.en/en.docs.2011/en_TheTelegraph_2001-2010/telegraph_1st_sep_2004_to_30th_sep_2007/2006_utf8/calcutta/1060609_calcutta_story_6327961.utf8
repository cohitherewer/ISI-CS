The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Letters

 Many faces of bravery: 

 All these kids are fighting the odds 

 Kudos for the report ?A pupil on the pavement?, May 30, we are not very rich, but my wife and I would like to sponsor Tamina Khatoon?s school fees for a year. 

 Surojoy Bhowmik,

 Address not given. 

 I was touched by the report on 

 Tamina Khatoon. I would like to meet her educational expenditure 

 through a scholarship. 

 Sajjan Bagaria, 

 Auckland Square. 

 I have just read your article 

 on Tamina Khatoon. I would like to help her. Can I pay her 

 tuition fees? 

 Homa Gazder, 

 Address not given.

 We read about Tamina Khatoon in 

 today?s edition of Metro.We would like to make a small 

 contribution towards Tamina?s education by paying her school 

 fees. 

 Rajesh and Lalita Daga, 

 Lake Town. 

 Pritikana Hait is a real example 

 of women power (The colour of courage, May 18). We are very 

 impressed with the spirit of the young lady and that she 

 has managed to continue her studies despite so much hardship. 

 We, as a corporate house, would like to make a contribution 

 to ease her burden so that she can concentrate better on 

 her studies. 

 Aujen Moulik, 

 deputy general manager, Eureka Forbes. 

 The article on Pritikana Hait 

 touched me, as I grew up in Calcutta under similar circumstances. 

 I shall be grateful to be of some help to her. 

 P. Matilal, 

 Address not given. 

 Pritikana Hait?s courage is exemplary. 

 I wish I could do something to support her cause. 

 Surendra, 

 Address not given. 

 I would like to support Pritikana 

 Hait by paying the tuition fees of both her sisters, so 

 that all of them can spend more time studying. 

 Chandan Pal, 

 Rahara. 

 A girl of Pritikana?s determination 

 should be encouraged. I would like to help her and her family 

 in some way.

 Like many other NRIs, The 

 Telegraph helps me keep in touch with India. 

 Recently, a few stories in Metro have illustrated the astonishing effort being made by children from the lower income group to obtain education and skills. 

 I wanted to know if there is a centre that accepts donations and provides financial or educational support to such kids. 

 The intellectual community in the world is driven by Indians, be it in the field of business, technology or medicine. Here in the US, I am familiar with groups that support such valiant children. I think there should a network that encourages gallant endeavours and acts as a link between the resources provided by the NRIs and the children from low-income groups. 

 I think The Telegraph is doing an excellent job of bringing social needs to our attention. Keep it up. 

 Syagnik Banerjee, 

 Kingston, USA. 

 I was moved by the stories of 

 Manik and Mukta. I work with Citibank in Dubai and would 

 love to be of some help to them. I was told that some kids 

 who clear the Joint Entrance Examination do not have enough 

 funds to pursue their studies. I would like to fund at least 

 two such kids. 

 D.J. Sengupta, 

 Dubai. 

 I am grateful to you for getting 

 to read the story. 

 D. Mukhopadhyay, 

 Address not given. 

 The likes of Manik and Mukta Haldar, 

 and 13-year-old Pintu and his five-year-old brother Abhishek 

 Kumar are the future of India. They are examples of what 

 an individual can do to uplift himself or herself in the 

 face of inequity. In the long run, they will have to compete 

 with those who will be better placed to enter educational 

 institutions and land plum jobs. Compare these kids with 

 those who have given up, blaming the political masters! 

 Society can come forward to help these children even if the government won?t. Calcutta is blessed with a large number of para clubs. Perhaps each club can build on its premises a study hall, where underprivileged children can study. 

 Bhaskar Majumdar, 

 Kuwait. 

 I was humbled by the struggle 

 of youngsters to master various sports (The Bravehearts, 

 April 2). With a little help, they can win us laurels all 

 over the world. I want to help Mukesh Paswan. 

 Susmita Basu, 

 Address not given.

 I wish to make a small contribution 

 to boxer Mukesh Paswan. May be a foundation can be set up 

 to help the needy students/sportspersons featured in Metro. 

 Ananda Bhaumik, 

 Address not given. 

 The focus on bravehearts fighting 

 against the odds was appreciable. I know of a talented youngster, 

 who despite hardships, has managed to represent the country 

 in taekwondo. She also trains underprivileged children so 

 that others like her have something to smile about. 

 Vinay Shrestha, 

 Address not given. 

 The article on Sukurmani Oraon 

 (Higher than hoops, May 17) was wonderful. I would like 

 to help in my small way in nurturing her dream. 

 Rumela Sengupta, 

 Address not given. 

 Congratulations for your article 

 on Manik and Mukta. It was very well-written. 

 Shiv Karnani, 

 AJC Bose Road. 

 I was touched by the report ?A 

 class apart, on the kerb?, May 10. I am an NRI and my aim 

 is to help students like Mukta and Manik. 

 Abhijit Sengupta, 

 Address not given.

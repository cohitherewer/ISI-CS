 The red, dilapidated mansion off Creek Row, in central Calcutta, once the residence of Raja Subodh Mullick and now a property of Calcutta University, is likely to be developed into an international-standard conference venue, on the lines of Wilton Park Conferences in Sussex, UK.

 The idea has been floated by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, also chancellor of the university, who inspected the heritage structure with senior officers of the institution a fortnight ago.

 ?We plan to set up a top-class conference venue in the mansion without tampering with the original structure, just as the Wilton centre, once a Tudor castle, has been developed,? said university pro vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.

 The proposal, however, will be finalised only after the Supreme Court delivers its verdict on Monday on a suit pending since the mid-1970s over the custody of a part of the building being occupied by the durwan of the erstwhile Mullick estate.

 According to the university?s plan, only international conferences on issues linked to politics, economics, education, and trade and commerce will be organised at the venue. The deliberations at the conferences will be archived for researchers. Adjacent to the conference centre will come up a guest house with five-star accommodation facilities. 

 Recalling the mansion?s history, registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay said Nirode Chandra Vasu Mullick, a descendant of Raja Subodh Mullick, had donated the property to the university on a condition.

 His will reads: ?If my son has no issue, however distant or adopted son or any issue of such adopted son, my estate shall go to the University of Calcutta for advancement of learning.?

 According to the registrar, the university came to own the building when Hamir Chandra Vasu Mullick, son of Nirode Chandra, died without any issue. 

 ?However, a durwan engaged by Hamir Chandra is occupying a part of the house,? the registrar added.

 Ashish Patil, vice president amp; general manager, creative amp; content of MTV India, says: For a brand like MTV that continues to define a generation, it is important that it leads the generation as well. While the channel is not an expert on AIDS, it surely knows how to talk to young people most susceptible to this deadly virus. 

 Zee Turner, the joint venture partner of Zee Telefilms and Turner International India, has launched a new campaign Zee Turner Ke Saath Faide Ki Baat especially designed for the rural market. The campaign enables rural viewers to get channels like Zee TV, Zee Cinema, Cartoon Network and Pogo at an extremely competitive pricing.

 On the new campaign, Arun Poddar, CEO of Zee Turner, said: The rural market in India provides an immense potential for growth. TV households in rural India today stand at 61 million and only 29 million have cable and satellite connections. Our rural drive will not only provide better options of entertainment to the viewers and better business opportunities to the cable operators, but also help us in enhancing our penetration and consolidating our market share.

 Salve for schools

 - Eye 

 on academic standards only

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government reiterated on Friday that it had no intention of interfering in the internal matters of Anglo-Indian and Christian missionary schools.

 The proposed piece of legislation only seeks to monitor the functioning of all private schools, school education minister Partha De clarified on Friday.

 Addressing a meeting of Association of Teachers in Anglo-Indian Schools, De said the government felt that it should keep an eye on overall functioning of the missionary institutions to help them maintain their high standards.

 The Anglo-Indian schools have played a significant role in imparting quality education to society. These schools are the role models of many. We want them to remain in touch with the government, so we can help them maintain their high academic standards, said De.

 For the past year, Christian missionaries have been on agitations to protect the minority rights of their schools against state interference. The state government wants to enact a law to monitor functioning of all private schools, including the Anglo-Indian and Christian missionary-run institutions.

 The minister observed that the norms for running schools are gradually changing, not just in terms of escalated fees but also in respect of management, thereby increasing the scope for privatising education. 

 He added that the missionary schools might face competition in such a situation, as more and more English-medium schools are coming up in the state. The government will help you in every possible way to maintain your standards, De assured the teachers from more than 41 schools across the city. 

 Echoing similar sentiments, MLA Barry OBrien said several non-Anglo-Indian English-medium schools are making false claims of offering the same standards of education as the missionary schools, and charging high tuition and other fees.

 The association members urged the government to ensure that the existing financial benefits and other service conditions of teachers in Anglo-Indian schools were safeguarded in the proposed piece of legislation. 

 Association president Ismail Nehal said the association would keep a close watch on the developments concerning the bill.

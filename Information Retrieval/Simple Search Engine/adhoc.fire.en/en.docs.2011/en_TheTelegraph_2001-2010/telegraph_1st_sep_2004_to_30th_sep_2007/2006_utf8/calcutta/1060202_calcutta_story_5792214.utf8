 Father killed 

for property 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On Tuesday evening, when Mohammad Yajedulla stepped into father Mohammad Moijuddin?s room in his Bhukailash Road house, in the Ekbalpore police station area, the 60-year-old garment dealer may have thought that sparks would fly. 

 Hours earlier, there had been a fiery exchange of words over property.

 But Moijuddin was caught unawares when his son pulled out a pair of scissors and attacked him. Yajedulla repeatedly stabbed his father in the heart with the scissors. 

 Then he punched him and fled, leaving behind the bleeding and groaning old man. 

 Moijuddin died later at night at a private hospital on Alipore Road. Doctors said he had succumbed to the injuries caused to his lungs by the scissors.

 ?We have started a case of murder against Yajedulla and are looking for him. He is absconding,? said a senior officer of Ekbalpore police station.

 Police have detained for interrogation Moijuddin?s younger son Gudda and the body has been sent for post-mortem. The room in which the murder took place has been sealed.

 Moijuddin, neighbours said, had a thriving business in ready-made garments and clothes in Fancy Market. 

 The father of two sons, he had married off the eldest Yajedulla a few years ago and had given him a share of responsibilities in his business.

 At 32, Yajedulla, however, preferred not to shoulder any responsibilities and only helped with the business whenever he felt inclined. 

 For the past few months, family members claimed, he had been asking his father to part with a portion of the property so that he could start a business of his own.

 ?Yesterday, some time in the afternoon, Yajed walked into his father?s room and soon we heard a heated exchange. He even tried to strangle his father but his mother and younger brother intervened. Later, around the evening, he sneaked in and killed his father,? said a family member. They were alarmed when they heard the old man?s cries for help. 

 When they rushed into his room, they found the dying Moijuddin on the floor. He could hardly move as blood oozed out of his wounds. Neighbours rushed him to hospital, where he finally died around 10.30 at night.

 Police are speaking to Yajedulla?s friends for a lead on his whereabouts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Every winter, many circus companies camp in the city for a month or two. However, due to lack of publicity and cooperation from the administration, the footfall at their shows is often very low. Sometimes, they even incur losses as people are more interested in visiting movie halls and discotheques. Schools should organise trips to circuses so that the children can enjoy the acrobatic shows. This will also boost the trade.

 There should be an adequate number of state buses on the Barasat-VIP Road-Dharmatala route. The only respite is the service of Calcutta Tramways Company buses on routes C 14/1, C 18 and C 3, that ply on EM Bypass, which is quite dependable. But state buses are also much needed on these routes.

 Why are the authorities still so apathetic about Curzon Park? The park is in a wretched state. A urinal near the park is a big nuisance and creates much inconvenience to passers-by. Why is the park getting second-grade treatment compared to the new ones like Citizen?s Park? Perhaps, this park could also be partly privatised for maintenance.

 Mahesh Prasad,

 Hooghly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hearse rerun for city trader

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Death came calling the second time.

 Barely 48 hours after Tuesday?s unsettling incident, a hearse was sent once again to the office of the same businessman on Thursday, apparently as a threat.

 On Thursday, however, the hearse was not done up with flowers. It stopped in front of Ramesh Agarwal?s office on Hazra Road in the afternoon. 

 The driver of the vehicle, identified as Gogo Nath, asked the staff to hand over Agarwal?s body.

 This had happened on Tuesday, too. At that time, the hearse attendant was Gour Nayak. On that occasion, employees immediately contacted their boss, who was in Delhi and in a meeting with his clients. Agarwal contacted police and lodged a complaint.

 ?This is the second time that such an incident has happened within a span of three days. I have ordered an inquiry into it to find out who sent the hearse,? said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 According to police, on Thursday, the vehicle belonging to a social welfare organisation stopped in front of 77/2A, Hazra Road, where Agarwal?s office is located. 

 When attendant Nath asked for the body, the receptionist replied: ?Sorry, you must have come to a wrong address.?

 Nath then showed the piece of paper on which Agarwal?s office address and his name were written. The staff promptly informed the police.

 After reaching Agarwal?s office, the cops interrogated Nath. ?Someone called on the landline of our organisation and requested us to send a hearse for Agarwal?s body. The caller specifically mentioned this address,? Nath told his interrogators.

 This time, police had no idea where the call was made from. ?On the last occasion, the call was made from a telephone booth in south Calcutta to a cellphone of the earlier organisation. This time, we have no clue, because the organisation?s telephone set does not have caller line identification facility,? said an officer. 

 ?We are waiting for Agarwal?s return from Delhi. It appears that a business rival is behind the incident. We will have to talk to Agarwal about his business status,? he said.

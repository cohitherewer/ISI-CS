 Due to the highly stylised structure of Indian classical dance and its emphasis on form, it is often forgotten that emotion produces motion and that the course of that intangible emotion can be charted. In other words, it is possible to learn to ?feel? a mood. This evening?s choreographic rendition of Principles of Shiva by Mandakini Trivedi provides an excellent illustration of the way in which the science of abhinaya or ?learning to feel? can enhance the scope of a choreographic experience. Though Mohini Attam is the focus of all her creative work at present, Trivedi?s style assumes a blend of all the numerous inputs and influences she has borne over time. Her initiation into spiritual practices, which gave her a vision of dance as it must have been practised by ancient masters, has proved to her that liberation (moksha) and self-evolution are the twin purposes of Indian dance. This is reflected with renewed consciousness in her present composition, which embodies perfection of expression, backed by genuine, intense experience.

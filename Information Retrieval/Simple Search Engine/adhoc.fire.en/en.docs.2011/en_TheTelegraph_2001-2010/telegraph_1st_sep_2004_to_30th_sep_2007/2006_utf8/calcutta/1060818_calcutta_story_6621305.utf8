 Row grounds CU project

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A spat between a section of teachers and an official has almost grounded the Technical Education Quality Improvement Project (Teqip) being executed at Calcutta University with World Bank funds.

 The bone of contention is the choice of the company that supplied computers to the university under the project, which is also being implemented in five other state-aided institutes in Bengal. Of the total outlay of Rs 153 crore for the project, Calcutta Universitys share is Rs 30 crore.

 The row has prompted vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee to order a probe into the allegations of both sides.

 In a complaint lodged with the vice-chancellor and other senior officials, Manab Kumar Sengupta, Teqip coordinator and convenor, has alleged that two teachers in the computer science and engineering department are not maintaining transparency in implementing the project. He has urged the authorities to take action against them.

 In another compliant, teachers owing allegiance to the CPM-backed Calcutta University Teachers Association (CUTA) has rubbished the charges and demanded stern action against Sengupta.

 We will announce our decision by the weekend, vice-chancellor Banerjee said on Thursday.

 He said the teachers have requested him to find out why Sengupta had circulated copies of his complaint to so many officials.

 Sengupta has sent copies of his letter to the two pro vice-chancellors, dean of the technology faculty, principal consultant, Teqip, the heads of the six departments of the university where the project is being implemented and all state-level nodal officers.

 Work under the project has suffered badly, said a teacher. We have to resolve the differences at the earliest, as we need to utilise the funds by March 31.

 Problem erupted last month when some teachers of the computer science and engineering department refused to install computers procured with Teqip funds through orders placed by Sengupta. The teachers claimed that the computers, supplied by a city-based company, were of inferior quality. 

 Sengupta lodged a complaint with the authorities alleging that the teachers were deliberately opposing low-cost computers. He urged that serious steps be taken for such irregular activities.

 We will soon finalise our stand on the issue, said Biplab Chakraborty, CUTA general secretary said. Sengupta refused comment.

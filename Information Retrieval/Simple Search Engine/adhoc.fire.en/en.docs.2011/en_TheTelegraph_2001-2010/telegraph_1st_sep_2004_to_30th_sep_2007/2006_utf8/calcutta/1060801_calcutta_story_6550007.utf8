 What: 

 Monsoon Showers, an eggless dessert and snack workshop from 

 The Stadel Poorna Annapurna stable.

 Where: The Stadel housed inside the Salt Lake Stadium.

 When: Saturday morning. 

 Take a look: With Rakhi and the festive season ahead, this was a workshop that women were looking forward to. Women and girls of all ages lapped up ways to whip up simple yet exotic desserts and snacks. Danseuse Sanchita Bhattacharya and public relations veteran Rita Bhimani were present. 

 It feels great to see young girls taking interest in workshops like this. Your food must look good and taste good, but most importantly it should be healthy. I am happy to be a part of the workshop that has kept all the factors in mind, smiled Sanchita. The dancer also shared an easy-to-make recipe with the guests.

 The session presided over by chef Narayan Chatterjee demonstrated all-time favourites like Black Forest-Monte Carlo, Peach Exotica, Chocobisco Wheel and Lemon Cheese Cake. Also showcased were munchies like Mexican Twisted Puff, Vegetable Wellington and Crunchy Paneer Salad. 

 Fruit Word Search, a fun round of fixing up a word puzzle, had winners walking away with exciting prizes.

 Voiceover: It took me some months to come up with these eggless recipes. Next in line will be a North Indian food fare without onions and garlic, said chef Narayan Chatterjee.

 Sea spread

 What: Seafood Festival at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 Where: Virgose, the resto-bar.

 When: Till August 13.

 The spread: The festival offers seafood delicacies with the focus on Continental and a few Oriental dishes. 

 Start with Malwani Fried Prawn, Beckti Tikka Lasooni and Baby Octopus with Thai Chilli Sauce. The Crab Claws with Chamihar Sauce is a must-try. Move over to the main course with Lobster in Xo Sauce, Salmon Steak on Chilli Chive Potato with Caper Butter Sauce, Red Snapper on a bed of Couscous with Basil Butter Sauce and Black Ink Risotto with Mussels and Shrimp. The fish fare does not end here. Bengals favourite fish hilsa has undergone a complete makeover. So dig into Pesto Hilsa on Risotto, Baked Hilsa with Anchovy and Dijon Mustard on Mashed Potato and Sauteed Leafy Vegetable, Smoked Hilsa on Rucola topped with Mango Hollandaise, Poached Hilsa with Ginger Pokchoy Veloute and Virgose Special Hilsa. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 295. 

 Voiceover: The array takes you away from the run-of-the-mill hilsa festivals being held at every nook and corner, says executive chef Utpal Mondal.

 Safe Kalighat cry

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court has expressed concern over the rise in criminal activity inside the Kalighat temple. 

 A division bench of the court, while hearing a public interest litigation, observed that both the police and the temple management committee should put their heads together to chalk out measures to make the temple premises a safer place for devotees.

 ?Devotees have no security on the temple premises. Criminals are very active there. Even a high court judge (Justice Amitava Lala of Allahabad High Court) was robbed inside the temple on April 15 this year. The authorities should take immediate measures to stop criminal activities,? the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Soumitra Sen observed.

 Pilgrims ?should not face such problems in the temple. There are daily instances of devotees falling prey to pickpockets,? the court remarked.

 The court expressed displeasure over the failure of the authorities to keep the temple premises clean. 

 ?Generally, pilgrims take a bath before going to offer puja in temples. But, in the case of the Kalighat temple, the devotees have to take a bath after coming out of the temple,? Justice Sirpurkar said. ?As in many other temples, the Kali temple authorities should make provisions for pilgrims to wash their feet before offering puja,? the judges said.

 The division bench was hearing the petition moved by Prahlad Goenka, a devotee and resident of the city, who brought some serious allegations against police and sebayets of the temple 

 According to him, police had failed in their duty to maintain law and order in the temple area. 

 ?While police have failed to provide security to pilgrims, the sebayets of the temple are more interested in making money by selling their palas to businessmen,? he alleged.

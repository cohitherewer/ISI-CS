Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, the temple or meditation 

room should be located in the east or north-east of a house

Q: Our 

house is being renovated in a big way. We are planning to build a temple and a 

meditation room in the south-west of the house. I would like to know whether this 

direction is Feng Shui-friendly or not.

Sarojini

THE SOLUTION: South-west is the direction ruled 

by earth energy, which is heavy, dense and rich with life. It is just what a couple 

needs for a healthy and stable marriage and relationship. Hence this is the best 

direction for the master bedroom and the area nearest to the south-west is best 

used by married sons in the family.

The temple and the meditation room should always be 

located in the north-east and the eastern part of the house. This is because the 

sun rises from this direction and nourishes the world with life force.

Career call 

Q: My 

date of birth is 03.11.1985 at 10.29 pm. I will be appearing for my BA Part I 

exams with English honours in June. Please let me know my animal sign, kua number, 

lucky colours and auspicious directions. Please guide me about my career prospects. 

Also, I want to know whether there are chances of me travelling abroad for studies 

or settling somewhere outside India.

Sunetra Malik

THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal 

that you are a strong fire person with four self elements. Such strong fire elements 

represent professions connected with hospitality and entertainment. Water-related 

professions also give status to fire people, which could be media, banking, finance 

and communication. Presently you are going through Yang water period, which will 

help reshape your life for the better. You can expect a change of residence or 

city or country. The chances are more prominent in 2007. This period will help 

you gain status as well, which means good results in your Part I and II exams.

Your marriage prospects also seem strong in 2007. 

Your animal sign is Ox, kua number is 9 and auspicious directions are east, south-east, 

north and south. 

You will benefit most from earthy, metallic and water-related 

colours like beige, cream, yellow, white, blue and black.

Finance fiasco 

Q: 

I was born on December 23, 1954, at 2.20 pm. I am without a job for the last three 

years due to the sudden shutdown of my factory. At present I have opened a food 

store on my premises. The entrance to this is from the west. I want to know the 

prospects of this business. Also, please let me know my animal sign, lucky colours 

and auspicious directions.

Arun

THE SOLUTION: You are a very weak water person 

and will benefit only from metal-related work because metal is the mother element 

of water. You had entered into the fire period in 2003, which weakened your self 

water element and at the same time destroyed your metal-like resources.

This period continues till 2008 and in 2009 you will 

step into the water period, which will again strengthen you and things will improve. 

Your animal sign is Horse and your auspicious directions are south-east, east, 

south and north. 

Make yourself strong with water and metal elements 

and their related colours, which are blue, black, silver, copper and gold.

Flushed out

Q: 

We have bought a three-bedroom flat with three attached bathrooms in a highrise 

building. Please guide me about the location of the commode in each toilet.

Ajay Saha

THE SOLUTION: Commode is best placed with its 

back against the exterior wall of the toilet. This way the drainage pipe does 

not run along the interior wall of the toilet, which will surely be sharing the 

wall of the adjoining bedroom. 

Care should be taken that it is not placed in the 

north-east of the toilet. At the same time, you should not be facing east while 

sitting on it. 

We all know that north-east is the worship area, hence 

it should not be polluted with a commode. Again, facing east and using the pot 

is not advisable because we all face east and worship the rising sun.

 Prithviraj Kapoor in the play Deewar

 A display on Prithviraj Kapoor, a tribute to Tagore and a package of select stage pieces in different languages from across the country. The 17-day Prithvi Theatre Festival 2006 gets underway on November 3, having expanded the scope of the annual event.

 This year there are 28 productions putting up 45 shows across four venues in Mumbai. The two troupes making their way to the festival from Calcutta are Tritiyo Sutra and Rangakarmee. Tritiyo Sutra, under Suman Mukhopadhyays direction, will stage Falguni: Suchona and Kalantak Lal Fita as a double bill apart from Raktakarabi. Usha Ganguli and her group Rangakarmee will stage Kashinama, a dance-music spectacle on human values versus commercialism. 

 Falguni: Suchona is a Rabindranath Tagore play where a comic situation results when a king discovers two grey strands in his hair; Kalantak Lal Fita, based on a Shibram Chakraborty story, explores the red tape of bureaucracy.

 The Tagore tribute is a festival of four plays, based on the bards works, that premiered in Calcutta in August. The fare includes Habib Tanvirs Raj-Rakt, K.N. Pannikars Raja, H. Kanhailals Dakghar and Suman Mukhopadhyays Raktakarabi. 

 The Prithvi festival package includes Marathi playwright Satish Alekars Mahanirvan, Jayant Kripalani-directed Manjula Padmanabhans English play Hidden Fires, Irawati Karniks adaptation of Mahesh Elkunchwars Dharmaputra, Mallika Sarabhais musical theatre piece Unsuni, Unheard Voices, Jana Natya Manchas Shambukvadh, P. Rajagopals Tamil play Parkadal, H. Kanhailals Manipuri act Pebet and Nadira Zaheer Babbars take on M.F. Husains life Pencil Sey Brush Tak

 That apart, there are daily platform performances at Prithvi Theatre, which includes Rangakarmees Maiyyat. 

 But the highlight of the Prithvi festival is an exhibition on the life and theatre of Prithviraj Kapoor to mark his birth centenary. The display at Prithvi Theatre will focus on Kapoors theatre career that spanned 1944-1960, during which he steered eight productions on social issues and toured the country with his troupe Prithvi Theatres.

 As Natya Shodh Sansthan, one of 

 Indias few theatre archives, celebrated its silver jubilee, 

 appropriately, the longest-surviving Bengali group Bohurupee 

 graced the festivities with its play Dipdanda, directed 

 by one of the seniormost figures in Bengali theatre, Kumar 

 Roy.

 Roy has always gone out of his way to nurture new writers, and has discovered quite a few. Having promoted Tirthankar Chanda previously, he continues with Chandas Dipdanda, set during the Buddhas lifetime in ancient India. But unlike most such plays, it is neither political nor religious, though in the background Buddhism threatens to get the better of Brahmanism.

 The real subject is an unusual one medical science, Ayurveda and surgery having reached unprecedented levels of perfection in places like Taxila, from where two graduates return to practise in Magadha and Vaishali.

 One of them, the senior, soon becomes the royal physician in Bimbisaras court, gaining reputation and affluence, both important goals for him. The other decides to serve the rural poor, starting a clinic far away from town, where his urbanised wife refuses to accompany him.

 Clearly, Chanda allegorises our health system, juxtaposing doctors who prefer lucrative positions in cities against those who selflessly labour in the countryside. He even inserts lines indicating his ideal: three to four years of compulsory medical posting in villages and availability of the best health care for everyone regardless of wealth.

 Despite the high altruism and practical solution, the script itself remains flawed. It feels strange in this day and age to see nearly 30 male characters, but only four women, of whom just two have any roles of consequence, and even those dispensable. It is chauvinistic to portray wives as opposed or obstacles to husbands single-minded dedication, as several Bengali dramatists persist in doing. Then, to make her commit a sacrifice for medicine in the end and thereby glorify her, as Chanda does, is bad melodrama and opportunistic dramaturgy.

 Roy himself recognises the excessively 

 episodic nature of Dipdanda, which prevents it from 

 creating the atmosphere of the period that it aims to 

 do. Likewise, Gautam Ghoshs music surprisingly lacks historical 

 sense, by employing such later instruments as the sitar 

 and shehnai in the melodies. 

 Bohurupees experienced leading man, Debesh Ray Chaudhuri, gives the best of the performances as the good doctor.

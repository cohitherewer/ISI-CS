 Mercedes count racing ahead 

Mercedes magic

 - Younger lot willing to spend on status and class drives sales forward

 ANASUYA BASU

Merc magic is revving up on city streets, with the number of Mercedes-Benz cars doubling by the year.

 If 24 Mercs were delivered in 2004, the figure jumped to 54 in 2005, and with the ?S? class set to debut this July, the sales figure of the premium wheels for 2006 could well cross the 100 mark.

 ?Yes, the market in eastern India (which still means Calcutta) is really expanding,? smiles Hiteswar Singh, CEO of Interkrafts, the only dealer of Mercedes-Benz in the region. ?And the numbers are being pushed up by the younger lot, more willing to spend on status and class.?

 Despite the potholes, the limited road space, the traffic snarls and crowded parking lots, the Mercedes is clearly catching on in Calcutta. Offering direct purchase of the Mercedes models since 2002, Interkrafts saw a dip from 29 in 2003 to 24 in 2004, but the tide turned from 2005. ?With the best mileage from its ?C?-class diesel model at 11 km per litre, customers here are more than happy to ride a Merc,? says Singh.

 Of the new ?S? class model, described as the Benz of Benzes, Interkrafts is planning to sell 10 to 12 between July and December 2006.

 Earlier, Calcuttans eyeing a ?C? or ?E? class Mercedes-Benz model would have to hop over to a Delhi or a Pune for test-drive or direct purchase. Now, Interkrafts is delivering a Merc to Calcutta driveways ?in a day? if the coveted model is in the showroom.

 Customisation ? mainly limited to choice of colour and transmission system ? takes a maximum of three months flat. 

 ?Obsidian black with double beige upholstery is the most-sought-after combination in the city. For chauffeur-driven cars, Calcuttans want manual transmission and for self-driven cars, they want auto transmission,? reveals Singh.

 Mini-fridges, sun blinds, mobile fittings, parking aids, superior lights and changed alloy rims are some of the other things put in according to customer specifications.

 Calcutta has very ?discerning consumers?, he adds. ?I?ve had Calcutta clients calling me up from London or Germany, asking me if the model they were seeing in front of them would be available in the city with all the features.?

 Ask him for a client list and he downs privacy-clause shutters. ?They are mostly self-employed,? is all that Singh would reveal. 

 With a minimum pocket pinch of Rs 25 lakh, Mercs are ridden by a fistful of businessmen, doctors and lawyers in the city.

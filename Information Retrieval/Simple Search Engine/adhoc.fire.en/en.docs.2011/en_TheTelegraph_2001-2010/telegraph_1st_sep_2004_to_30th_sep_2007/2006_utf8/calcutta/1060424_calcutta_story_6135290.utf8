 Poll officer robbed of cash in Kali temple

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Umesh Mundra, an IAS officer from Bhopal now in the state on election duty, was robbed of Rs 5,000 at Kalighat temple on Saturday evening. 

 Mundra served as an observer in Bankura, in the first phase of the Assembly election. On Saturday afternoon, he went to the Kali temple to offer prayers.

 ?Being a Saturday, the temple was overcrowded. He had to wait for a couple of hours for darshan. He realised that he had been robbed while leaving the temple,? said Bikash Chandra Roy, officer-in-charge of Kalighat police station.

 ?His security personnel should have been with him, especially because there was a crowd. A special darshan could also have been arranged with our assistance. Mundra told us he was alone since he was not on duty. The cash was in a bag that he was carrying. The pickpocket sliced open one side of the bag with a blade and took out the money,? Roy added.

 The officer-in-charge was confident of recovering the cash. ?We are trying our best and hope to nab the culprit soon. My men are on the hunt. A couple of local pickpockets have been picked up for questioning,? he said.

 According to another officer of the police station, people are robbed regularly at the temple. ?Mundra happens to be an IAS officer. Otherwise, there is nothing unusual about the case,? he remarked.

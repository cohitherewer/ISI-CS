The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Who will fly flag for Rs 50

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Wanted: Someone to keep the national Tricolour flying atop Writers? Buildings (picture right).

 Requirement: Incumbent must be able-bodied, capable of climbing up to the fourth-floor scaffolding of the building twice every day ? at sunrise and sunset, to hoist and then lower the national flag.

 Attendance: Every day of the year, night spend in office.

 Remuneration: Rs 50 per month.

 Bottomline: No takers to keep the Tricolour flying.

 With no more than Rs 50 being allocated for the group D staff member in the public works department (PWD) on ?flag duty?, it?s hard to find someone to do the ?special job?.

 The remuneration was raised from Rs 30 to Rs 50 in 2004.

 ?For a paltry sum of Rs 50, none of the younger staff members wants to do this job. We?ve been seeking a revision for some time, but the department has turned a deaf ear. We?re writing to the PWD secretary again,? says an official in the caretaker?s office. ?Unless the amount is raised to Rs 150-Rs 200, we?ll soon have no one to keep the flag flying,? he warned.

 There?s an immediate crisis on hand, with the staff member assigned Tricolour duty now on leave. ?The person filling the gap is hardly willing. Sometimes, we pay him out of our pocket and plead with him to do the needful,? said an official.

 According to the flag code of the country, the Tricolour is to be flown ?prominently? at the state secretariat ?on all days, including Sundays and holidays?.

 The code also prescribes that the national flag be flown from ?sunrise to sunset, irrespective of weather conditions?.

 And it does take quite a lot to keep the flag flying at Writers?. Picture this: climb to the third-floor terrace, clamber up a 27-ft iron ladder (with no railings) to where the flag mast is fitted, then crawl some 15 feet under four iron cross bars.

 PWD minister Amar Chowdhury said he wasn?t aware of the prevailing remuneration for flag duty. ?If the staff members appeal to us, we will consider a revision in the rate,? he said.

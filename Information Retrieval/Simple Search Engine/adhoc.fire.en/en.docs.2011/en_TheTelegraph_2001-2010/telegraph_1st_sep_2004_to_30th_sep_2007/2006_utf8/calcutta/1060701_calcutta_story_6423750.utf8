The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Popcorn vs passion

Stage On amp; Off

 That a seminar on ?What does theatre 

 mean to the youth?? should be attended mostly by grey-haired 

 veterans was itself a giveaway at the flag-off to the sixth 

 Hutch Odeon, held last Friday. But a more kaleidoscopic 

 take was on offer from the younger brigade on the panel 

 comprising Sohini Halder and Saswati Biswas. The others 

 were Rajat Kapoor, Makrand Deshpande, Bibhas Chakraborty 

 and Samik Bandopadhyay. 

 ?In every generation, the youth begin ambitiously but peter out soon. They turn out to be springtime thunder while what theatre requires is blinding rain,? said Bibhas. Rajat Kapoor suggested that the issues theatre deals with today don?t strike a chord with the youth.

 ?In today?s breakneck pace, theatre allows me to sit back, reflect and share... I am convinced that theatre is the ultimate vehicle of change. I love it, so I do it,? felt Sohini.

 Saswati Biswas was more pragmatic. ?There?s no glamour or attractive packaging. It?s only inevitable that movies and the like take the cake. For us, staging a play is a perennial party, at least we have an incentive to carry on. When they aren?t even allowed popcorn into the auditorium, what incentive does the audience have??

 Makrand didn?t think the youth 

 problem was anything to be worried about. ?Every generation 

 always throws up some exceptional talents, and so the art 

 lives on.? But destructive criticism, especially by veterans, 

 has scared off many an emerging theatre worker, warned the 

 man behind theatre group Ansh.

 Helpline for handicaps

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Nine-year-old Souvik is deaf and blind. A year ago, his parents ran from pillar to post to train him in supporting himself. As most schools for the challenged deal with children with one disability, they denied Souvik admission, leaving his parents worried about his future.

 Souvik is not alone. Several children in the city and across the state suffer from multiple disabilities, with no hope to tide over the handicaps.

 To fill in the gap, city-based NGO Society for Visually Handicapped, which deals with blind people, has come up with a project to train children with multiple disabilities, along with their parents.

 We work with the visually handicapped. We have specialists to train them into self-sufficiency. But we are coming across more and more children suffering from multiple disabilities, visual impairment being just one, said Hena Bose, secretary of the NGO.

 The Society first confronted the problem when a city orphanage approached it with four visually-challenged children, also suffering from malfunction of sensory organs. We had only theoretical knowledge of multiple handicaps and their solutions, said project director Ruma Chatterjee. But when the children came to us, we decided to tackle the situation, she added.

 Chatterjee came to know that a Delhi-based NGO, Sense International, has the expertise of providing training to persons suffering from multiple disabilities. We contacted the NGO and they helped us a lot, Chatterjee recalled. Later, I attended their training sessions in New Delhi and Gujarat and got hands-on experience in tackling the problem. 

 Soon after, volunteers of the Society were sent to Sense International for training and they learnt how to communicate with persons suffering from multiple disabilities.

 The session proved very useful and now the volunteers are training 22 children with multiple disabilities.

 While interacting with the children, we realised that their parents hardly know how to deal with the challenged wards. That motivated us to start sessions for the parents, too, Chatterjee added.

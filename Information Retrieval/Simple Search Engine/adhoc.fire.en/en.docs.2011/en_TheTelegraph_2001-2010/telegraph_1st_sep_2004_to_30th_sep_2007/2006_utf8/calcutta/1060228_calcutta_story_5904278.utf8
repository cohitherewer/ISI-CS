 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee unveiled three RPG Enterprises projects in Bengal on Monday, ?an important day for the city and the state?.

 The venue was 33, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, the site of the 400,000-sq-ft CESC-Godrej plaza that is eyeing a March 2008 opening.

 And if the three-in-one inauguration was not enough, the Godrej group gave the chief minister another reason to grin, by committing itself to ?several real estate projects? and even an information technology (IT) venture in town.

 Parmeswar Godrej, for once, refused to steal the spotlight, sitting quietly in the first row while son Pirojsha shared the dais with the chief minister, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka and others.

 Pirojsha gave credit to the ?limitless enthusiasm? of the chief minister, something that prompted him to venture into Calcutta. ?Though it missed out on the initial boom, the city is sure to make up now. We were looking for a prime location for quite some time and we are most excited about our first venture here,? added Pirjosha.

 The mall-multiplex mix apart, also on the Godrej agenda is 3.3 million sq ft IT space, out of which 1.7 million will be located in Salt Lake?s Sector V. ?Forty per cent of Wipro?s manpower comes from Bengal. I think we have a clear winner here,? he smiled.

 Earlier, Bhattacharjee switched on the lights on the foundation stones of the three different ventures ? the CESC-Godrej Plaza, the International Management Institute in Alipore, and the 250 MW power generation unit in Budge Budge.

 ?I tried to persuade Adi Godrej many times to come and invest here but what I couldn?t do, Sanjiv Goenka has done,? smiled the chief minister.

 As for the thorny topic of opening up the retail sector to foreign investors, Bhattacharjee said he was of the firm opinion that ?we are capable of doing it ourselves?, before going on to reiterate why Wal-Mart will only be operating at a wholesale level. ?What will the thousands of vendors do if they enter the retail sector?? demanded the chief minister. 

 On the management institute, Bhattacharjee said: ?When Sanjiv proposed a hospital or school on the small plot of Alipore, I told him that I was ready to hand it over, only if it was a management school, something that we really need.? A tie-up with MIT was on the cards, he added.

 Also on offer in this B-School would be training programmes for the hospitality and retail services. With Joka ?the only international-level management institute? here, Bhattacharjee urged ?quick construction? of the International Management Institute.

 Goenka, on his part, said he would utilise all the RPG Enterprises ?under-performing assets? to perform better.

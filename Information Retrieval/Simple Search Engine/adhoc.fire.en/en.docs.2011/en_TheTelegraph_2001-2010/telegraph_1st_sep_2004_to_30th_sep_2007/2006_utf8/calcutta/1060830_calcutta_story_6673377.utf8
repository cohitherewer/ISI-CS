 Wanted: more hotel rooms in town. With star hospitality addresses more likely to flash the house full sign than multiplexes and business traffic to Calcutta growing by the month, the demand-supply mismatch is acute enough for the chief minister to lead the give us more chorus.

 In Calcutta, we have four five-star hotels but there is need for more, said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the inaugural function of the International Tourism Summit, organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce, on Tuesday morning.

 In sync with the venue ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers Bhattacharjee chose to expound on the expansion plans of Welcomgroup. ITC has decided to set up more hotels here three of them will be in Haldia, Durgapur and Siliguri, announced the chief minister.

 As the announcement created quite a flutter, the tight-lipped hotel officials sought to keep things vague. The intent to expand in the east is very strong and we are scouting around to find the right brand-fit and location for our products. We are looking at various places, including Haldia and Siliguri, but things are yet to be finalised, clarified Ranvir Bhandari, area head (east) and general manager, ITC Sonar Bangla.

 But what is certain, said sources, is ITC Sonar Bangla adding around 300 rooms on the present premises, with a specific target group. Setting up two budget hotels and one luxury hotel in or around the city also figures high on the groups list of things to do.

 Not surprising for a hotel that had come to Calcutta with low expectations but is now recording chock-a-block room bookings and boasts some of the most popular star restaurants in town.

 The story of sold-out hotel rooms stretches from the Bypass (Hyatt Regency to ITC) to Alipore (Taj Bengal).

 Sticking to the hotel beat, the chief minister on Tuesday also told the gathering how the renovation of Great Eastern Hotel is now underway. 

 As it is a heritage site, the facade will remain, but the rest of the hotel is being reconstructed, said Bhattacharjee of the BBD Bag landmark being revived by Lalit Suri.

 Admitting that tourism was being neglected by both the central and the state governments, the chief minister lamented how Southeast Asian countries draw more tourists than us.

 Identifying infrastructure and beautification as the twin drivers, Bhattacharjee elaborated: We have taken up several projects to beautify the riverfront. The stretch from the riverfront to BBD Bag will be rejuvenated. Now, after 9 pm, the whole area is dead.

 Beyond city limits, the government is planing to promote tea tourism in North Bengal, with two pilot projects in the Dooars and Terai.

 Mixing messages with movies, a seven-day fare of screenings, talks and interactive sessions gets underway at Nandan this week. The Fifth International Social Communication Cinema Conference, organised by Roopkala Kendro from February 15 to 21, will showcase feature films, documentaries and TV serials from India and abroad.

 To be unveiled by Mrinal Sen, M.S. Sathyu?s Garam Hawa will be the inaugural film. The star attraction of the line-up, though, is sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who will talk on ?music in films? on the final day. Bangladeshi film-maker Tanveer Mokammel?s Chitra Nadir Paare will be the closing film.

 ?The aim of the conference is to take communication to the grassroots level. The broadcast category, for instance, will see if TV serials with messages can be an alternative to soaps,? says Roopkala Kendro director and CEO Sanjay Mukhopadhyay. ?We will also have interactive sessions with film-makers after the screenings as the conference is trying to have a dialogue with the viewers.?

 Spilt into three sections to target specific audience groups, the first part of the conference is themed on the Partition. Apart from Garam Hawa, the package includes Ritwik Ghatak?s Komal Gandhar and Subarnarekha, Nemai Ghosh?s Chhinnamool and Pamela Rooks?s The Train to Pakistan. Dharti ke Lal, Udayer Pathe and Kalpana will also be screened.

 A tribute to neo-realist film-makers is also on the agenda. Observing the centenary year of Luchino Visconti and Roberto Rossellini, the tribute section features Rossellini?s Rome, Open City, Paisa, L? Amore and Stromboli, and Visconti?s Violence and Passion and White Night.

 The broadcast category will screen TV serials with a social communication message for advertising agencies, donor agencies and public relations organisations. A bunch of 13-episode, commercially-successful serials with need-based messages has been sourced from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam and South Africa.

 The narrow-cast category showcases development films on contemporary issues from Vikalp, Jeevika, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, and other organisations, plus film schools like SRFTI, Jadavpur University, St Xavier?s College and Roopkala Kendro. The target audience comprises district information and culture officers, and members from panchayats, district press and film societies.

 A package of animation films from NID Ahmedabad will be shown alongside films by Roopkala Kendro and Films Division. ?This will give an idea of the tradition of animation films in India,? says Mukhopadhyay.

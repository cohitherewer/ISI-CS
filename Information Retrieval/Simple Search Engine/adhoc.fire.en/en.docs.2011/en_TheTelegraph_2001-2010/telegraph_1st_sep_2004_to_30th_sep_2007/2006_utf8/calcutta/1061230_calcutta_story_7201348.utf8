Grease groove

Screen On amp; Off

 This New Years Eve, Inside the Actors Studio welcomes Susan Williams Antonia Stockard Channing Schmidt, popularly known as Stockard Channing. So, sit back, pour that wine and get into the groove for a long night of partying with the Grease girl on Sunday at 7 pm on PIX.

 In the early 70s, Channing appeared in several small television roles, and made her big-screen debut in The Hospital. But Channings first major film was when she starred in The Fortune with Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty. She finally won her most memorable role to date tough gal Rizzo in the retro-musical Grease. Interestingly enough, although she was cast as a teenager, the actress was in her early thirties when she was chosen for the film. 

 In the mid and late 70s, Stockard Channing had become so popular that the popular TV network CBS offered her the lead in two sitcoms, Stockard Channing in Just Friends and The Stockard Channing Show.

 After a very successful stint on TV which culminated in serials like The West Wing and Out of Practice, Channing went on to win a Best Actress Oscar nomination for Six Degrees of Separation.

 To find more about that lesser known charismatic star of the big and small screens, you have to tune in to Inside the Actors Studio. On the show, apart from acting tips, Channing shares unknown trivia about herself. Hear how she got her role as First Lady Abigail Bartlet on The West Wing, while on a hiking trip. She broke her ankle on that trip and instead of working around it, the makers wrote it into the script.

 Also, only actor Martin Sheen is allowed to call her by her real name, which is Susan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Subrata Mukherjee

 Former mayor, Calcutta Municipal Corporation

 There should be no compromise on development. After this licence from the present mayor, hawkers ? many of them Bangladeshi immigrants ? have become reckless. They do not bother to leave minimal space for pedestrians. The inevitable result will be loss of lives when people are pushed off the carriageway. Rehabilitation is hardly a solution. We gave hawkers alternative space which they took while the original space was again eaten up by other hawkers. Space on the pavements of Brabourne Road, Hatibagan and Burrabazar are even sold on a per-sq foot basis. Police and the Corporation are turning a blind eye. The chief minister used to urge me for a clean up. Now, he is being forced to toe the party line.

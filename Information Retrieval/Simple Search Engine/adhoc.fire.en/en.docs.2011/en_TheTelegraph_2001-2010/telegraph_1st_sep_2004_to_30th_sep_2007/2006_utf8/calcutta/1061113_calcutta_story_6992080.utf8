 Row over tech tips 

 - Students, 

 college lock horns 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Students of Womens College, Calcutta, at Bagbazar, have submitted a deputation protesting the introduction of computer education as a compulsory subject in the current semester.

 The issue had kicked up a row between the students and college authorities. Students claim that they have been demanding a way out but the authorities are firm on their decision.

 The college authorities are forcing us to enrol for the computer classes. Many of us are doing similar types of courses at private institutes outside the college. We had requested them to make the subject optional, but they are adamant in their stand, said a second-year student. 

 The authorities said that the management feels that such classes are the need of the hour and should be made compulsory.

 Last year, when the course was not compulsory, only 11 students had enrolled in it. This is very disheartening. At the beginning of this year, it was decided that the computer education will be made compulsory. The decision was approved in our general body meeting. Therefore, despite students protest, we are helpless, said Sunanda Ghosh, principal of the college.

 The authorities said that the private study centre, Institution of Computer Education, which is conducting the course, has decided to pull out, due to poor turnout last year. 

 We had taken the decision after consulting all the academics associated with our college. However, there are some issues which we will discuss in our next general body meeting, said Salil Chatterjee, president of the governing body. 

 He added that the computer course was approved by the higher education department and was introduced in all the colleges.

 The authorities said the course is being introduced at an affordable rate, considering the students from the lower economic bracket. 

 Each student has to pay Rs 500 for a 10-month-long training. We have also decided to waive the fees for those who cannot afford the amount. Such students have to submit the required documents. We will get 15 per cent of the total course fee. Our aim is to familiarise our students with computer technology at an affordable cost, because it is the need of the hour, Ghosh stated.

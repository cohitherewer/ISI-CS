The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 World Cup wows 

 Who?s the hottest of them all? Boyish 

 Brazilian to sexy Spaniard, the women voters love ?em all. 

 But no one can bend it quite like Becks, yet

 DAVID 

 VILLA 

 A fantastic physique and 

 a cool hair cut. He is a good-looking man with a lot 

 of oomph. When I saw him, the first thing I uttered 

 was ?wow?. The Spaniard stands out for his style and 

 pace. 

 June Tomkyns, 

 beautician

 KAKA 

 The Peter Pan of football! 

 Mature moves and innocent charm ? just the kind of 

 man my friends and I would fall for. And how that 

 handsome nose becomes a trifle red when the going 

 gets tough! 

 Madhumita Das, final-year 

 college student 

 RONALDO 

 There?s something very sweet 

 and down-to-earth about him and he doesn?t look like 

 a celebrity at all. There is a very cute next-door 

 guy kind of look about him, which makes him very endearing.

 Swastika Mukherjee, actress

 RONALDINHO 

 He looks extremely athletic 

 and hence quite hot. He has this energy about him 

 which is very appealing. His hairstyle is also quite 

 interesting and makes him stand out.

 Lovey Burman, Kookie 

 Jar proprietor 

 DAVID 

 BECKHAM 

 Without any doubt, the coolest 

 of them all. If one forgets the infidelity streak, 

 he comes across as pretty cool. Reports say he is 

 a great dad and he?s always very well put together. 

 His experimentation with his hairstyle is also quite 

 interesting.

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh, fashion 

 designer

 He?s way too handsome. I 

 think he?s one of the most well-dressed and fashion-conscious 

 footballers around. He can carry off just about anything, 

 be it hairstyle or clothes.

 Shonal Rawat, model

 WORLD CUP WORDS

 Some new words and phrases 

 and a comic strip have also been kicked off by FIFA 

 2006, enriching the English language. Or endangering it, 

 in some cases.

 The chief perpetrator is England 

 striker Peter Crouch. He invented a jerky robot-like dance 

 (picture right), seen first on television after he scored 

 a goal in a friendly against Hungary last month. Since then 

 the dance, which many compared to Star Wars C3POs 

 routine, and which leapt from the football field to all 

 of Englands dance floors, has been variously called 

 Doing-the-Crouch, Crouchbop 

 or Robot Crouch. Prince William wanted to 

 see the footballer perform it when he visited the England 

 training camp!

 Crouchs act, the serious game-watchers feel, is more 

 embarrassing than cool probably why hes kept 

 it under wraps in the Cup so far. But what they object to 

 more is the number of crouching headlines 

 the 6 ft 7 inch beanpole striker has set off. So theres 

 Crouching Peter, Hidden Talent? Crouching 

 Peter, Hidden Talisman Crouching Robot, Hidden 

 Geek and Crouching Fouler, Hidden Grabber. 

 Crouch even drove the fine FIFA commentators to excruciating 

 excess. When Michael Owen crawled off the pitch and Crouch 

 ran in against Sweden, one muttered: Crouching England, 

 Hidden Owen.

 Arsenals Theo Walcott, 

 17, has been credited with reinventing the word theomania, 

 ordinarily meaning the conviction that one is God or has 

 been specially chosen by God. During the build-up to the 

 Cup it meant the madness over Arsenal player Walcott, chosen 

 to play for England before he had played a serious match 

 for his club. Wonder what will happen if he does take the 

 field against Ecuador and scores.

 Ronaldinho has inspired Brazils well-known comics 

 writer Mauricio de Sousa to start a strip, Ronaldinho 

 Gaucho, as a child. It includes his brother Asis, 

 sister Daisy, biggest fan Diego (no prizes for guessing 

 who) and two dogs Champ and Fireball. The little boy Ronaldinho 

 retains his adult hairstyle and actually looks like 

 a little girl.

 But the words that will live the longest are: Is 

 Ronaldo fat? So asked Brazils President. There 

 are many variations doing the rounds on the Net: Ronaldo 

 is fat, isnt he? Or, Is Ronaldo fat 

 or fit?, or, So, is Ronaldo fat or not?

 Dont ask Zico and his 

 boys.

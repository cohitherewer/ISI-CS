 Civic estate plan irks residents

 ?Switzerland of the South? under siege

 Over 500 residents of Purba Putiary, in the Regent Park area, are up in arms against the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for taking over a two-bigha plot to build a housing estate. The local residents used the plot for strolls and to practise yoga. 

 The plot, in ward 114, called ?Switzerland of the South? by local residents, is surrounded by waterbodies. The civic body has handed it over to the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) for constructing a housing estate under an Asian Development Bank scheme. Those who have been evicted from the banks of Tolly?s Nullah are expected to be rehabilitated at the estate. 

 ?We are determined to frustrate the government?s plans to turn the green zone into a concrete jungle. This is the only place where we can enjoy fresh air every morning,? said Sudhir Bera, former legislator and vice-president of All India Freedom Fighters? Samiti, on Sunday. 

 Bera is a resident of the area for over 10 years. ?The people of the locality will not allow the CEIP to spoil the greenery. People of Paschim Putiary and its adjoining areas come here every day for jogging and other physical exercises. The Kudghat Laughing Club was formed here in 1996,? he added.

 The fencing of the plot had started a couple of weeks ago, much to the happiness of the club members and other residents of the area. They thought a park was being built.

 ?But soon, we came to know that buildings will come up here, instead of a park. Inquiries revealed that the CMC was planning to construct highrises. We then decided to protest and take up the matter with local CPM councillor Amal Mitra,? said a regular morning-walker in the area.

 When contacted, Mitra, who is also the Left Front chief whip in the civic House, said the plot has to be used for rehabilitating those evicted from different places across the city. ?According to ADB norms, buildings need to be constructed to rehabilitate evicted people. Therefore, we cannot comply with the illogical demands of the residents of Purba Putiary,? Mitra asserted. 

 Project director of CEIP Rajiv Sinha said though a few four-storey buildings will come up on the plot, the waterbodies will be properly preserved. ?We will set up benches on the banks of the waterbodies so that people can sit there for some time,? he added.

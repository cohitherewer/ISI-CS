 Chinese boost to brand

 KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR

 A city-based company is making a mark in the crowded consumer durable market. While low prices are Zenith Finesses unique selling proposition, the 13-year-old company is also banking on Brand China. 

 Indian consumers are now understanding the value of Chinese products and our sales have picked up, said Pritimoy Chakraborty, director of Zenith Finesse. 

 The companys turnover in Bengal has crossed Rs 10 crore in the current fiscal and Chakraborty has set a Rs 50-crore target by March 2008. 

 We were initially buying products from Chinese manufacturers and selling them here. But since January 2005, we have been manufacturing DVD players and home theatres by leasing a facility in China, added Chakraborty. 

 The basket of products sold under Finesse brand and priced between Rs 3,000 and Rs 22,000 includes five speaker-one subwoofer home theatres, DVDs, airconditioners and televisions. A 15-inch pure flat television with 250 channels priced at Rs 5,900 was added to the portfolio last month. 

 We are planning to launch an MP4 player early next year. It can store 16 feature films and up to 4,000 songs, stated Chakraborty.

 According to him, the companys marketing strategy revolves around convincing the consumers about the value for money offered by the products and availability of round-the-clock support. 

 Zenith Finesse is planning to set up a manufacturing facility in Bengal by 2008. But it will retain its Chinese tag with a partner from the neighbouring country to capitalise on the benefits of bulk buying, quality products, advanced technology and skilled labour in the land of the dragon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Peter OToole

 You have the spirit of a crusader, a heart of gold and a pleasant nature that endears you to all. You fight till the end if you care for something. Do not neglect your health in the process of changing the world. You keep your cool in the most pressing of situations. Failure does not faze you; you always move on. Kusum Bhandari

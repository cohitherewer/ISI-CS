If the effort of a group of NGOs bears fruit, street children in Calcutta may finally get their birth certificates issued.

 Close to 70 NGOs in the city have collected over 40,000 applications for birth certificates from people living on the roadside. ?We plan to file an affidavit in Calcutta High Court so that the children are issued the certificates,? said Sabir Ahmed, programme coordinator of a city-based NGO.

 According to the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, every child is entitled to get his or her birth certificate. The act also stipulates that the registrar?s office has to be informed about the birth of a child by someone from the family.

 ?But with no one to take care of the street children, we had to take the initiative of providing them with birth certificates,? said Ahmed.

 ?The authorities concerned often allege that these children are from Bangladesh. But we have carried out a survey and found that the parents of most of these children have been staying in the city for over 30 years. Yet, their children do not have birth certificates,? he added.

 Due to the unavailability of the documents, more than 50,000 homeless people have lost their voting rights in this year?s Assembly polls. 

 Deputy chief registrar Shekharesh Ghoshal said: ?Applications for birth certificates have been pending for the past 10 years. We are trying to clear the backlog. So, it is difficult to figure out how many homeless children have not been issued the papers. Besides, there has to be an informant, who will let us know about the birth of a child.?

 Agrees Sher Mohammad, deputy chief medical officer of the civic body: ?In case of homeless people, the hospitals may act as informant. We do not have much to do if hospitals fail to update us. We, however, conduct awareness campaigns among the homeless people.?

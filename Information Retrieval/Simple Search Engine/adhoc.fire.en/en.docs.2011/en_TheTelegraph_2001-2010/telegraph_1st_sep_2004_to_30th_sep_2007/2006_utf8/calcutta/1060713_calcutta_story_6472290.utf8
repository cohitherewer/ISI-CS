 New-age accountancy

 In today?s increasingly digitised world, computerised accounts are becoming an important tool to conduct business. Keeping this in mind, the Institute of Computer Accountancy (ICA) opened its second mega computer training centre, on Chowringhee Road, to equip students with the knowledge of minute technological details, helping them become industrial accountants.

 N.K. Shyamsukha, chairman, ICA said: ?ICA teaches its students to become industrial accountants and guarantees jobs as well. Students will have their money refunded if they do not get placed.? He added that students would also be able to apply for mid to upper management positions like junior accountant, senior accountant and accountant assistant on completion of the course. 

 ICA started seven years ago and now has over 200 centres in India. The second mega training centre faculty will comprise chartered accountants, company secretaries and tax advocates, who have also conceived and developed the course. ?Students will be trained through real life data and practical implementation of various concepts in accounting, including banking, taxation, ROC and business communication,? pointed out Shyamsukha.

 ICA has a dedicated research and development wing comprising more than 200 chartered accountants keeping an eye on the process of evaluation of the subject of accountancy and designing courses which aptly suit the requirements of the industry.

 ?ICA students are nurtured in an amiable environment by a faculty of young and energetic general teachers and chartered accountants. While the general faculty teaches modules one and two, the chartered accountants will address modules three-eight,? he explained. 

 ?Each student after enrolment in ICA?s job guaranteed courses will be given an any time job card. By showing this card at one of our 13 placement offices, they are ensured a job anywhere in India,? signed off Shyamsukha.

 Flurry of courses

 Training and Advanced Studies in Management and Communications (TASMAC), a management institute, has introduced three new postgraduate courses ? MA in journalism, MA in advertising and MA in public relations. Eligibility for the courses is a bachelor?s degree or a postgraduate degree from a recognised university. Undergraduates over the age of 25 with at least two years full-time work experience can also apply.

 Giri Dua, chairman and managing director, TASMAC, said: ?There is a growing demand for professionals in advertising, public relations and journalism. All three careers are among the most upcoming ones today. Advertising professionals are assured some of the most creative, exciting, lucrative and fulfilling careers. There is also a growing demand for PR professionals. The scope for them in corporates, event management companies and TV channels is endless. Journalists, anchors, scriptwriters and newsreaders are also much sought after and highly paid in the expanding media scenario.?

 The institute will start the courses from August. On completing the programmes, students will get degrees recognised by the University of Wales, UK. The batch strength of each course is expected to be around 20.

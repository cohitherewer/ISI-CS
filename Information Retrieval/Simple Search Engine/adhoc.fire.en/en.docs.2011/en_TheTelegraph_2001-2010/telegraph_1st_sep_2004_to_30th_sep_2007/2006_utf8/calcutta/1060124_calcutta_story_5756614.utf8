 Zero-death malaria drive

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities have set upon an ambitious task of making Calcutta free of malaria deaths by this year.

 What has buoyed mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya to work for Target-0, as the project has been named, is the record low in malaria deaths ? three ? in 2005.

 On orders from municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, chief municipal health officer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay is now finalising the project blueprint, which will be placed before the mayor for approval.

 As part of the Target-0 programme, each of the 141 wards will have a health unit. At present, 37 wards do not have one. The civic body runs 63 malaria clinics, which will be increased by at least five. 

 According to a norm prescribed by the Centre, the city should have 92 clinics or one for every 50,000 people.

 Besides, the civic authorities, under the guidance of entomologist Debasis Biswas, have for the first time prepared a micro-level mosquito chart for every ward and brought areas with greater concentration of the malaria-causing mosquito under special focus. 

 The maps have been prepared by conducting a sample inspection of mosquito larvae in 50 houses in each ward.

 ?In just six months, we have been successful in bringing down significantly the incidence of malaria and deaths caused by it,? mayor Bhattacharya said on Monday. ?Our much-cherished dream is to make Calcutta a malaria-death-free city and I seek active cooperation of the residents to realise the goal.? 

 Civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay gives full credit to the officers and field staff of the civic health department for the record low in malaria deaths in 2005. ?The achievement has inspired us to aim for zero-death in malaria. I think it is possible if we have the people beside us,? he asserted. 

 Leader of the Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan and a section of health officials, however, feel the ?abnormally low malaria death figure? was just a spin-off effect of the anti-dengue drive launched in August last year.

 Dengue broke out in the city during the monsoon and claimed 12 lives. The civic body had launched an intense drive against mosquito-breeding grounds, which continued till November, the peak season of malaria. The drive had significantly checked the growth of the malaria-causing Anopheles stephensi mosquito.

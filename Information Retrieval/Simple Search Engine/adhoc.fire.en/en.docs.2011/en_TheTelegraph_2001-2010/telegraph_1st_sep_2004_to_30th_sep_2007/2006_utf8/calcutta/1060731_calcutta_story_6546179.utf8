 FAUNA FEAST: Karnataka is drawing up a strategy to market its premier wildlife destinations

 A delegation of the Karnataka tourism department has arrived in Calcutta to woo those bitten by the travel bug. 

 At a roadshow held in the city on Sunday, officials of the tourism department of the south Indian state announced plans to roll out a luxury train, similar to Rajasthan?s Palace on Wheels.

 Indian Railway?s Integral Coach Factory in Chennai is manufacturing the train. Work is expected to be completed by September 2007, said Prashant Thakur, managing director, Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation.

 The project cost has been pegged at Rs 32 crore. The route will cover some wildlife, heritage and beach tourism destinations. The seven-day, 1,637-km round trip will commence at Bangalore. Mysore, Hassan, Hospet, Hubli, Dandeli and Goa will be some of the stops. ?Those who want to get off at Goa will be able to do so,? added Thakur.

 According to him, the 18 coaches of the train will accommodate 114 passengers. Eleven of the coaches will be used as passenger coupes with 40 per cent double berth and 60 per cent single berth.

 ?Although our train is modelled on Palace on Wheels, it will have more modern facilities,? claimed Thakur. A bar, ayurvedic massage parlour, gymnasium, library are some of the facilities being contemplated. Tickets will cost about $300 per night for the six-night, seven-day package.

 The Karnataka tourism department is also formulating a strategy to market its forest resorts. ?The state, with its rich flora and fauna, is ideal for promotion of eco-tourism,? said Jija Hari Singh, managing director, Jungle Lodges and Resorts, a wing of the Karnataka government. 

 ?We are marketing some of the premier wildlife destinations in the state like Kabini, Dandeli and Devbagh,? she pointed out. ?We are offering adventure sports packages, including safaris, trekking, river rafting and water sports.?

 The tourism department delegation and a group of hoteliers from Karnataka are taking part in the three-day Travel and Tourism Fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

 A recent survey by Fairfest Media, which has organised the fair, has revealed that eight per cent of Calcutta tourists head for Kerala and Karnataka.

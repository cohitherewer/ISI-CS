 The rest day of The Telegraph 

 Merchants? Cup Football at CC amp;FC came alive at night 

 as the other Cup kicked off. The popular club bar became 

 the nerve centre for football action from 9.30 pm on Friday 

 as hosts Germany took on Costa Rica in the World Cup opener.

 With the beer flowing and cheers 

 greeting every other move on the Munich pitch, it was a 

 carnival atmosphere on the eve of The Telegraph Merchants? 

 Cup finals on Saturday evening.

 ?Soccer is very much the flavour 

 of the season. My wife and daughters are interested in football 

 but not to the extent of sitting up at night and watching 

 it. In the club we have many like-minded people who love 

 a game of football over a couple of beers. Here we can shout, 

 scream and celebrate the victory of our favourite teams. 

 The World Cup is also a good excuse for boy bonding,? smiled 

 club member Sablok Maheshwari, gung-ho about the German 

 goals.

 For CC amp;FC members, the Cup 

 truly brimmeth over. ?Both the bars will be open to members 

 for all World Cup matches. We had more than 350 members 

 watching the first match in both the bars. Free snacks were 

 served and prices on some drinks were slashed by 50 per 

 cent. As the excitement grows, we intend to put up a giant 

 screen in the pavilion,? said a spokesperson for the club.

 The Park

 The mood was no less football 

 festive at the Park Street hotel on Friday night, with its 

 three most popular hangouts playing host to the Cup ? on 

 big television screens at The Atrium and Someplace Else 

 and on a giant screen at Tantra. ?Nobody would have liked 

 to miss the opening matches and so we ensured that diners 

 and party hoppers could enjoy their soccer,? smiled a spokesperson 

 for The Park.

 And it proved a hit. While The 

 Atrium and Someplace Else saw a big crowd for the opening 

 ceremony and the Germany vs Costa Rica opener, Tantra witnessed 

 a crowd crush for a combination of football and fashion: 

 Ecuador vs Poland and the Fashion Police show starring Jattinn 

 Kochhar.

 Germany was clearly the crowd 

 favourite, but Costa Rica?s brave battle attracted its fair 

 share of applause. Special shots like Penalty (fiery combo 

 of tequila and Tabasco) and Sudden Death (Bacardi, mint 

 and a dash of lime) on the special Cup menu went down well 

 at Atrium, where the decor matched the drama. 

 The Oliver Kahn sandwich and David 

 Beckham fish ?n? chips were also in demand. At Tantra, beer 

 was the highest scorer.

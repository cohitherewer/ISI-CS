The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 She smiles 

 through pain

 Fighting fit: Piali 

 in her office. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 Namaste, this is Piali, 

 may I help you?, the 27-year-old said softly into the phone, 

 peering into the computer screen through her thick glasses 

 and simultaneously keying in some data. At first sight, 

 Piali Mukherjee seems totally in control as she sits at 

 her cosy workdesk in the administrative block of Apollo 

 Gleneagles Hospital. She is smart, articulate and well-suited 

 for the department of media and public relations of the 

 hospital.

 But alls not well with her. Piali 

 suffers from Brittle Asthma Type I and bronchiectasis, a 

 progressive lung disease, Atrial Fibrillation, where several 

 areas of atria or upper chambers of the heart start beating 

 erratically causing rhythm disturbances, Chronic Obstructive 

 Pulmonary Disease and severe osteoporosis.

 I fell prey to asthma attacks 

 as a result of frequent lung infections in my childhood. 

 But it was during my graduation that I was diagnosed with 

 cardiac arrhythmia. All of a sudden, my heart rate would 

 jump to 200-300 per minute, said Piali, who lived in Krishnagar 

 till she completed her graduation. In 1995, Pialis elder 

 sister died of cardiac problems. So, their only surviving 

 childs health condition came as a big shock for Pialis 

 parents.

 Even when she went to Manipal 

 Hospital in Bangalore for treatment she developed severe 

 pulmonary distress. I went into respiratory distress and 

 had to be revived with assisted ventilation, Piali recalled.

 In 2000, Piali cleared B.Sc honours 

 and decided to take up medical transcription. She took the 

 tough step of moving out of home and shifting to a paying 

 guest accommodation in Calcutta. My asthma continued and 

 I learnt to self-inject the life-saving medicines during 

 an attack, said Piali, who has been implanted with a permanent 

 intravenous (IV) line in her chest for drug transfusions 

 to the heart.

 But while Pialis health deteriorated, 

 her career took flight. She climbed the ladder from a teacher 

 at the institute where she was pursuing the medical transcription 

 course to the centre manager. I always dreamt of working 

 with Devi Shetty. So despite my health condition I gladly 

 took up the job of a part-time copywriter at Rabindranath 

 Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences, along 

 with my full-time job in Millennium Campus. For eight months, 

 I worked seven days a week, juggling the two. In 2003, I 

 joined Apollo Gleneagles, said the girl with a passion 

 for writing poetry.

 Apollo Gleneagles soon became 

 her second home. Respiratory attacks forced her to get admitted 

 to the intensive care unit of the hospital almost every 

 15 days. My oxygen level fell so low that I used to pass 

 out while eating. By the end of 2005, I was confined to 

 a wheelchair and dependent on artificial oxygen supply, 

 recounted Piali, leaning against the backrest of her chair.

 Its been exactly a year since 

 then and Piali is up and about. Her desk is a busy one, 

 with dime a dozen phone calls, colleagues dropping by with 

 queries and office meetings. So what brought about the turnaround? 

 I had drowned in depression when I was suggested by Pranic 

 healer Vidisha Bhattacharjee to undergo the no-drug no-touch 

 complementary energy therapy. Initially, I was doubtful 

 whether it would work. But it did, she smiled.

 Piali is still suffering from 

 the ailments but her respiratory attacks, blackouts and 

 bouts of erratic heart beat have reduced considerably. In 

 the past two-three months her condition has improved a lot. 

 She needs to continue her medication and exercises, said 

 Ashok Sengupta, senior pulmonologist with Apollo Gleneagles 

 Hospitals.

 Piali even ventures outdoors for 

 a while now. With a spirit as resilient as Pialis, destiny 

 has had to bow to her optimism, hope and dreams that many 

 others dont put up a fight for, said her colleague Ekta 

 Bubna.

 Fun quest

 nOur college hosted Quest 2006, 

 the annual extravaganza comprising contests like debate, 

 song, dance and fashion shows, in September. The debate 

 on Who is more versatile, Tagore or Shakespeare? was really 

 interesting. The theme of the fashion show was bridal wear. 

 The crowd-puller was the DJ nite with DJs from Bhawanipur 

 College playing some rocking music.

 Caught on Net

 I am irritated with my friends. 

 Over the past one week, at least four of them have urged 

 me to join an online community called Gazzag. Apart from 

 the extreme ugliness of the name (does it have anything 

 to do with former footballer and fatboy Paul Gascoigne?), 

 we are already part of another online community, Orkut. 

 As the whole world knows by now, Orkut is named after a 

 Turkish software engineer called Orkut Bykkkten. (Random 

 thought: who is the more famous Turkish now, Orhan Pamuk 

 or Orkut B.?)

 Anyway, to return to the matter 

 at hand, to wit, the plague of online communities all of 

 which want a part of you. According to the ever-helpful 

 Wikipedia, there are currently well over 300 such social 

 networking websites, bearing names such as Bebo, Eons, 

 imeem, Tribe and Xanga. Some of them have specific targets 

 such as Bebo which is meant for school and college students 

 and has a user base of over 22 lakh members. Joga Bonito 

 is a community for football-lovers while OkCupid is obviously 

 dedicated to dating. Communities such as CarDomain and LibraryThing 

 are also self-explanatory.

 But then come those communities 

 cunningly described as general-Facebook, Friendster, MySpace, 

 Threadless, and of course, Orkut and Gazzag. Why would I 

 want to belong to any of them? Well, it is a nice way of 

 keeping in touch with people, you are told. It is also a 

 nice way of reuniting with friends or enemies you thought 

 you had seen the last of. Not a day goes by without someone 

 leaping at you from cyberspace with cries of: Aha, the 

 oaf from class 4B who ate my tiffin every day!, or It 

 was me who sent you the flowers and the clockwork crocodile 

 on Valentines Day what are you doing for dinner tonight?

 Ok, its not as bad as that. But 

 after the initial novelty of being able to trawl through 

 thousands of members profiles and eavesdrop on other peoples 

 conversations, two things are possible. You become a complete 

 addict, check your account every quarter of an hour, and 

 feel suitably gratified when congratulated on reaching the 

 magic figure of 10,000 scraps on Orkut. You accede to friendship 

 requests from absolute strangers so that your friends tally 

 is higher than what it was yesterday. You are filled with 

 ecstasy when told that you are connected to 90,907,405 people 

 through 549 friends. Finally, you are almost fired by your 

 boss (about whom you have been bitching on Orkut) and your 

 company bans everyone from checking Orkut at work.

 And the second thing that is possible 

 is that you delete your account, cancel your broadband subscription, 

 join madrigal-singing or kite-flying classes, and become 

 an altogether better human being. But this is rarely known 

 to happen.

 I seem to have run out of space, 

 so I will continue my rant next week. In the meantime, please 

 refrain from inviting me to Gazzag.

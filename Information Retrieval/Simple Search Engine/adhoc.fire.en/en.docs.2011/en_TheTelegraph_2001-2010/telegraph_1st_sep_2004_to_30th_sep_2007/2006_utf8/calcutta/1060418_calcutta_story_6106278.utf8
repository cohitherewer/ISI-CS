The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Forsaken project gets an airing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The proposed East-West Metro is back in the limelight after an eight-month gap, with state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb reviewing details of the project with Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) managing director E. Sreedharan last Friday.

 Sreedharan made a presentation on the project ? that connects the city?s flanks ? at Writers? Buildings before Deb, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar and other state government officials.

 Deb, however, did not make any commitment to the DMRC, saying the government would announce its decision after the Assembly polls.

 The government had engaged the DMRC in 2004 to prepare a detailed project report on East-West Metro. ?We submitted the final report last month. The chief secretary?s interest in the project at this juncture is encouraging,? said a senior DMRC official.

 The project cost is pegged at Rs 3,500 crore, though there will be substantial cost escalation, as work will continue for six years. ?If started this year, the cost could touch Rs 4,500 crore by 2010,? said an official.

 The state government and the Centre are to contribute 20 per cent of the cost each, while the rest will be raised through soft loans from external agencies.

 ?Going by the present project cost, the state government will be required to shell out close to Rs 175 crore annually over the next six years,? the official added. 

 According to the DMRC?s draft report submitted in 2004, the East-West Metro was proposed to cover 24.9 km, from New Dasnagar (Howrah) to Rajarhat. But the state government had suggested a curtailment, as the cost worked out to a staggering Rs 7,200 crore.

 The final report suggests two alignments:

 nA 15-km-long route, with 15 stations, from Kadamtala in Howrah to Salt Lake?s Sector V. The plan includes a carshed near Central Park, Salt Lake 

 nAn 18-km route from New Dasnagar to Salt Lake, with 16 stations along the way.

 ?The second route, though it will cost Rs 300 crore more, is preferable. The first option is not feasible, as we will not get enough land near Central Park to set up the carshed. In the second proposal, the carshed has been planned in Dasnagar,? said a transport department official.

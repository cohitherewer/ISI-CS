The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech takes Quebec fancy

 - Visiting premier sees potential, eyes investment in IT areas

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Premier Jean Charest of Quebec: Upbeat

 The city?s information technology (IT) sector caught the eye of the Quebec premier on Wednesday.

 Quebec, one of Canada?s largest and most economically developed provinces, has invested $900 million in IT research and development for emerging markets, such as technological convergence, optical and biophotonics technologies, wireless telecommunications, animation and geomatics.

 Premier Jean Charest told Metro he now hoped to invest heavily in China and India, as well as attract investors in those fields.

 ?We want to choose areas in India where we can intensify our investments, and we are looking at Calcutta very seriously,? said Charest, leading a 32-member business delegation on breeze through town.

 Charest acknowledged that Bengal had taken great strides in positioning itself as an extremely viable and investment-friendly region, with IT being a focal point.

 G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, ministry of information and technology, was upbeat after making a presentation to the delegation. 

 ?They seemed extremely excited about the potentialities of Bengal, and they want to take it forward through definite agreements. Next-generation sectors such as nanotechnology and animation are areas we are looking to explore as well, and they have the necessary infrastructure and expertise for it,? said Gautama.

 IT apart, Quebec would be looking at investments in other sectors such as aeronautics, real estate and construction, and education.

 Charest said he plans to position Quebec as a prime industrial and knowledge hub and facilitate trade with India on a larger scale.

 ?There is a great deal of diversity in every part of India, and we view all this in the spirit of partnership and hope to accrue the benefits that will come to both regions. Tapping the vast knowledge pool here is a priority,? spelt out Charest.

 Later in the evening, the Quebec premier met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. At a session that lasted 45 minutes, Bhattacharjee reiterated that Bengal meant business and said a hotline would be set up between the state industries minister and Quebec?s minister of economic development, trade and innovation to take things forward.

 ?We have targeted Bengal as a region where we want to push the partnership forward,? said a member of the Quebec mission.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

You cant get through this week without

 Being on the ball

Tennis takes top priority this week as Calcutta hosts Sunfeast Open 2006 at Netaji 

Indoor Stadium. The indoor, Tier III WTA-accredited tennis tournament is offering 

prize money of USD 1,75,000. And what is it offering us? A chance to get up close 

and personal with Swiss Miss Martina Hingis, Hyderabad hottie Sania Mirza and 

some. All roads lead to the stadium between September 18 and 24. Catch the pretty, 

gritty girls as they battle it out. 

Picking your movie

You are spoilt for choice this week when it comes to the movies. If you are in 

the mood for love, you can catch Rahul Bose and Mallika Sherawat playing the tu-tu-main-main 

game in Pyaar Ke Side Effects. If you are looking for some good ol 

action, Ram Gopal Varmas got his angry young man Mohit Ahlawat in and as 

Shiva. Onir moves away from AIDS to Almodovar remaking Live Flesh 

into Bas Ek Pal. But perhaps The Devil Wears Prada is still the 

safest bet you dont need a reason to watch Meryl Streep, do you? 

Wrapping up shopping

You should be nearing the end of the seasons shopping saga by now, with 

clothes for all four days ready and gifts for loved ones all sorted out. So, time 

to run a final check. Accessories and make-up are often overlooked, so glance 

over your current stuff and see what you need to add a dash of glamour to your 

Puja look. Check out the range of long beaded necklaces at Shoppers Stop 

and Chamba Lama. Pick up some pretty jhumkas for the desi touch 

and binge on those bangles. All for that ooh effect!

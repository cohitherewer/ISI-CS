 Ferries will finally set sail on the Circular-New Cut-Kestopur canals. A trial run, from Chitpur Lock Gate to Baisakhi, in Salt Lake, will be conducted on August 15.

 The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) is implementing the Rs 20-crore canal navigation project in collaboration with the irrigation department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 According to the plan, the 20-km stretch of three canals, from Chitpur Lock Gate to New Town, via Salt Lake, will be de-silted and made navigable using water from the Hooghly. Launch services will then be started on the canals.

 Both banks of the canals will be beautified and turned into entertainment zones with childrens parks, cafeterias and flower gardens. A model garden has been laid at Ultadanga.

 The launches will halt at Ultadanga, Lake Town and Baisakhi. The makeshift bamboo bridges on Kestopur canal at Golaghata and Baisakhi will be torn down.

 Two 40-seater launches will initially be pressed into service. The fleet will be expanded on the basis of demand. The journey from Bagbazar to Salt Lake will take about half an hour, said Hidco engineers.

 The water diverted into the canals from the Hooghly will be treated at New Town before being supplied to the township.

 The irrigation department has dredged the canals using funds provided by Hidco. The transport department will operate the ferries in collaboration with a private company.

 The CMC has sealed the drainage outlets leading to the canals. The outlets have now been connected to the citys drainage system.

 An automatic sluice gate has been built near Bagbazar to control the flow of the river water. The high tide will force the water into the canals.

 The major part of the work, comprising dredging, cleaning and strengthening of the canal banks, is almost over. The Hooghly water has been successfully channelled into the canals. A trial run will be carried out on Independence Day, said housing minister and Hidco chief Goutam Deb.

 As this is a completely new venture, a trial run is a must to ascertain the problems in plying launches. We must take the safety and security aspects into consideration before introducing the service commercially, added Deb.

 The government had chalked out plans for the project in 2002, but could not implement it because of a funds crunch.The chief minister cleared the bottleneck by involving Hidco in the project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ready reckoner of city schools

 - Exhaustive guide on admissions, fees and streams of 200 institutions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The TTIS School Directory

 Students, parents, teachers this one is for you. The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS) School Directory is your detailed guide to the world of the classroom and beyond. 

 With exhaustive information on admission procedure, fee structure, board of affiliation, streams offered, extra-curricular activities, and even results of the previous year of more than 200 city schools and Montessories, it is the first guide of its kind in the city.

 MLA Barry OBrien, a columnist for the TTIS School Directory, said: This is yet another platform of The Telegraph to bring schools under one umbrella. The guide is not just a ready reckoner but a collectors item.

 Both parents and teachers feel the directory fills a vital gap one that becomes all too evident during admission season. I wanted my daughter to be admitted to an ICSE school but I did not know which schools are affiliated to the board. A directory like this would have helped me make a more informed choice, says M.D. Rekha of Behala. Adds Vijaya Sriram of Selimpur: This guide would be a boon for working couples forced to take time out to scout school notice boards. 

 The schools are also looking forward to the directory. It will take some load off us during the pre-admission procedure, when we are bogged down with repeated queries about the admission procedure, says Anjali Razdan, principal of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Adds Lorraine Mirza, principal of Pailan World School: The directory will improve exchange among the 200-odd schools listed here.

 TTIS School Directory would also serve as a guide to those who are new to the city. The likes of Anita Rout of Salt Lake, for whom the search for the right school for her two children has still not ended. When I moved in from Bangalore in 2004, I didnt have a choice but to get my children admitted to a nearby school. We didnt know the language, had no friends or relatives... I want to shift my children to a better school but dont know how to go about it. I could really do with a proper school guide.

 TTIS School Directory, priced at Rs 175, will be launched on Friday at Saturday Club. For a copy, call 24499229 or ask your newspaper vendor.

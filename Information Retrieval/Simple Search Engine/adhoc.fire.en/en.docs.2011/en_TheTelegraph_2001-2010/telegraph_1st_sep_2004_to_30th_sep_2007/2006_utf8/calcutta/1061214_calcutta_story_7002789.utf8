Life

 The singular 

 singer

 Sayantani Biswas 

 admires the lean, young man who refused to dance to anothers 

 tune or make others dance at a Boston puja 

 NON-RESIDENT 

 CALCUTTAN

 By the time Monomoy made an appearance 

 on Ashtami at the Wilson Middle School auditorium in Natick, 

 Boston, the crowd had grown understandably restless. He 

 was a little late, of course, for it is more often than 

 not infra dig for a star to arrive on time. 

 True to their style, the dadas 

 and boudis, mashis and meshos had placed 

 shawls and water bottles on the choicest seats before hurriedly 

 devouring a most divine Bengali dinner to be on time for 

 the show. A probashi community getting together during 

 Durga Puja, determined to leave nothing out of the Puja 

 food and entertainment package. 

 Monomoy Bhattacharya strode on 

 to the stage amid his modest troupe of three musicians who 

 had played their part of tuning instruments and adjusting 

 microphones to perfection.

 Now our singer is a lean young 

 man, fair and tall, with an air of quiet confidence around 

 him. He is the epitome of what our mashis and boudis 

 would describe as: Ki shundor dekhtey, ekdom Kartiker 

 moton. But the setting is Boston and the only 

 comment I heard from a neighbouring boudi was: Mondo 

 dekhtey noy, dekhi ki rokom gaay. Thus the programme 

 began with Aami chini go chini tomaarey, ogo bideshini. 

 He sang well and the crowd warmed 

 up to him pretty soon. He sang in a clear, practised and 

 unpretentious voice that we all consider very good entertainment. 

 But as it transpired, all was 

 not well with one member of the audience lets call 

 him D who waited for the third song to finish before hollering 

 in a typically nasal voice: Dada, amra ektu naachtey 

 chai. 

 D exuded the sort of uppity confidence 

 that comes from being a local in this case, 

 being a member of the organising community. 

 The crowd laughed politely and 

 I use the word politely with much deliberation. 

 Monomoy did not look very amused and went on to sing the 

 next song, chosen tastefully along with the others classical, 

 old Hindi movie numbers and Bengali favourites, along with 

 a few from his own albums. 

 D took up the challenge and went 

 on to pester our singer at regular intervals with snide 

 reminders like: Dada, eta Boston, Kolkata noy. 

 Amra ektu naachtey chai. 

 By this time the polite crowd 

 had also turned somewhat confused. It was expected that 

 the artiste, flown across the Atlantic by a probashi 

 community, would pander to what the latter well, one of 

 its members desired. And there was this unrelenting artiste, 

 every bit as polite and composed as he had started out to 

 be. Clearly, a war was being waged, a very personal one 

 at that too. 

 So when the singer requested for 

 a chair, D asked if the artiste was so tired already that 

 he needed to sit down! Monomoy smiled and said he had no 

 such luck, and then went on to place his book on the chair 

 and sing Aye zindagi from Sadma. 

 He had clearly saved the best 

 for the last. As the crowd went about requesting old classics 

 from the singer, D managed to squeeze in another Arre 

 dada, amra ektu naachtey chai je. Monomoy stopped 

 pacing around the stage, paused, and with a benign smile 

 said: Naachtey geley kintu bhalo gaan shona jaabey 

 na. 

 The apprehension in the air was 

 promptly pierced by thunderous applause. And Monomoy, who 

 had by then begun to remind me of Gladiators 

 Russell Crowe in the arena, cheekily turned to the crowd 

 and asked innocently what the applause was for dance or 

 songs. 

 The crowd clearly loved him for 

 they shouted and screamed Gaan, gaan 

 and clapped madly. One Serves you right, man 

 and another Boo were also directed at D. Oh 

 well, I have no qualms admitting they came from my husband 

 and me. 

 Thus it was that one polite crowd 

 put one of its rowdy members in his place and the evening 

 continued as if there had been no pestilence. 

 I have never bothered to take 

 an iota of interest in Monomoys talent before. But 

 seeing him on stage that day, making a sincere effort to 

 present to his audience a fine collection of songs keeping 

 time, place and occasion in mind, I could only feel respect 

 for him. Singularity is a rare commodity in our artistes 

 these days. 

 We all agreed with what one elderly 

 lady went up to the stage and told Monomoy at the end: Tomakey 

 dekhey aami bhishon proud feel korchhi.

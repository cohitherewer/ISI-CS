 2723 cr to mend roads, traffic

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The state government has taken up a Rs 2,723-crore action plan to improve the traffic and transportation system in and around the city. The projects under the plan, drawn up by the urban development department, will be implemented over five years.

 The schemes include extension and widening of arterial roads; widening and strengthening of secondary roads; construction of pedestrian underpasses, bridges, flyovers, elevated roads, bus terminals and truck terminals; improvement of traffic engineering; making arrangements for off-street parking; setting up of a water transport system; introduction of a modern passenger dispersal system; and development of a centralised information system.

 Officials said the Centre would contribute a major part of the funds under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission, while the rest must be borne by the state.

 The state, on its part, will tap the private sector and other sources to raise its share of the investment. Twenty-one schemes will be implemented exclusively with funds from the urban renewal mission.

 The plan has been readied after talks with the departments concerned, like transport, irrigation, public works and environment, and the civic bodies. We will now engage a consultant to prepare detailed project reports for the individual schemes, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Monday.

 The master plan and the specific schemes have been sent to Delhi. We have also sent a list of projects that will be implemented with central funds, he added.

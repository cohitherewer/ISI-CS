The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Ed Harris, actor

 You are positive, considerate, down to earth and always aiming to do good. You are old fashioned and fairly conservative regarding relationships. You avoid erratic and emotional people. You like to lead, rather than follow. You cant help worrying about small things and constantly re-examining other peoples agenda. Kusum Bhandari

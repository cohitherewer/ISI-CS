 Konkona Sen Sharma: Comic 

 act

 Sometime this summer Rituparno Ghosh?s Sunglass will bring another Bollywood face to the Tollywood studios. Sanjay Suri will play the lead opposite Konkona Sen Sharma in the Hindi version of the film, confirms Subho Shekhar Bhattacharya, CEO, Planman Motion Pictures.

 After Dosar, producer Arindam Chaudhuri?s company has teamed up with Rituparno for this Bengali-Hindi venture. The Hindi version is meant for a national release.

 ?For me, it?s very interesting to do a film with Rituparno. I enjoy watching his films and subscribe to his kind of sensibility. Sunglass is a magical romantic comedy and I believe I fit the bill. It?s also the first time Konkona and I will be working together. The film has a bit of everything, from romance to light moments,? says the hero of My Brother Nikhil, having clinched the role that Arshad Warsi was slated to play.

 For the Bengali version, to be shot simultaneously on the same sets, Tota Roy Chowdhury will fill in the blank beside Konkona. Tota played Bihari in Rituparno?s Chokher Bali and had a bit role in Dosar.

 ?Sunglass is a comic take on today?s life. The story is very contemporary and has an element of fantasy,? Rituparno tells Metro.

 The two-in-one film will involve a 30-day shoot in Calcutta and Darjeeling.

 First it was the teary soap, then a thriller and now a reality show. The handsome hero of television is still struggling to find a foothold after quitting the popular STAR Plus serial Kahiin To Hoga and his even more popular role of Sujal Garewal, which had turned him into a heartthrob.

 Rajeev Khandelwal has been roped 

 in to anchor Sony?s Deal Ya No Deal, earlier hosted 

 by Madhavan and then Mandira Bedi. The third series of the 

 reality game show that tests an individual?s ability to 

 make the right choices and win prize money up to Rs 1 crore 

 comes with a new look and feel.

 The format has been jazzed up, with the decision-making round getting tougher for the contestants. The participants will have to choose from 26 briefcases instead of 22, but they will also be allowed to seek help from family members present on the sidelines.

 ?Deal Ya No Deal gives me the chance to do something completely different from what I have done till now. My aim would be to help the contestants walk away with the maximum amount of money,? said the actor, who breezed through town on Friday. The show airs from Wednesday to Friday at 8 pm on Sony.

 It?s a treat from Disney Channel for kids spending the summer weeks at home. On June 25, the channel will air Finding Nemo, Oscar winner for Best Animation Picture and the international box-office topper.

 The film follows the humorous and eventful journeys of the fish Marlin and his son Nemo.

 Disney Channel will promote Finding Nemo through a watch-and-win contest involving movie trivia, which will be aired during breaks. 

 Viewers can send in their entries to win Nemo merchandise.

 The channel will also air Hanuman, one of the most popular animated features produced in India, as an eight-episode series on weekends, starting May.

 Produced by Sahara, Hanuman follows the story of the mythological superhero whose values spell victory of good over evil.

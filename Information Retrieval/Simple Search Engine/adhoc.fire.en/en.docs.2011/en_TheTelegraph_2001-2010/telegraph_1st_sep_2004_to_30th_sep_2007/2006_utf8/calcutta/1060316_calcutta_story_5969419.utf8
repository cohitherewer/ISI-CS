 Cops fear poll misuse

 - Arms 

 aplenty with lapsed licences 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Of the 6,000-odd gun-holders in the city, several have not renewed their arms licences. This has come to light following an Election Commission directive to the police, seeking a ?status report? on gun-owners in Calcutta in a fortnight.

 Over the past week, officers of all 48 police stations in the city have been busy visiting houses of gun-owners, collecting information, including their antecedents and the status of the guns.

 ?Every day, we are visiting gun-owners. Several have not renewed their licences for more than a year. Most defaulters claimed that they had forgotten that licence renewal was due,? said an officer of Alipore polic e station.

 Senior officers at the Lalbazar headquarters fear that at least some of the guns with lapsed licences could be ?misused? during the upcoming Assembly elections.

 ?We are probing the matter and the exact figure will be known once the inquiry is over,? said deputy commissioner of police (reserve force) P.S. Ghosh. ?Preliminary investigations reveal that a sizeable number of defence personnel are among the defaulters. They could not renew their licences as they have shifted base.? 

 The defaulters are being sent notices. ?They will have to submit their licences at police stations and can get back their guns after paying a fine to the Arms Act department. They are being warned not to repeat the error,? Ghosh added.

 Gun licences are issued by the Arms Act department, housed in the police headquarters. The process includes a ?thorough inquiry? of the applicants by the detective department, special branch and the respective police stations.

 ?If a person satisfies us and provides all relevant documents, a licence is issued to him. He has to buy a gun from a dealer within six months of the issuance of the licence and has to renew the licence every three years,? elaborated an officer of the Arms Act department.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Five arrests in torture death

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 She had suffered at the hands of her in-laws for years, till death came on Monday and Ila Mukherjee?s plight came to light.

 On Tuesday, Ila?s husband, parents-in-law, sister-in-law and even her 14-year-old son were arrested on charges of torturing her mentally to the extent that the 33-year-old had no alternative but to kill herself.

 Soon after Ila went missing on Monday evening, neighbours found her body in a well at her in-laws? Barwaritola residence, under Beleghata police station. 

 The in-laws said Ila had tripped over the well, but the neighbours countered the claim, saying the woman had been using it for the past 18 years, ever since she married Shekhar. 

 They also alleged that Shekhar?s family used to torture her regularly.

 Following a probe, a team from Beleghata police station arrested the Mukherjees early on Tuesday.

 ?It appears that even after so many years of marriage, Ila?s parents-in-law could not accept her,? said deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Partha Sarathi Ghosh.

 ?The woman never complained to police. Probably, she struggled within herself and then gave up after it became unbearable. We are waiting for the post-mortem report before framing charges against the accused,? he added.

 According to local residents, Ila?s was a marriage for love. Her parents did not like Shekhar, nor were Shekhar?s parents, who were staying in Mumbai, willing to accept Ila as their daughter-in-law. But the couple still went ahead and got married.

 ?Soon after, Shekhar?s parents, Swapna and Kalidas, shifted to Calcutta. They did not mix with their neighbours and forced Ila to follow suit. They would wait for an opportunity to ill-treat the woman. Even her son?s mind was poisoned against the woman,? said an officer.

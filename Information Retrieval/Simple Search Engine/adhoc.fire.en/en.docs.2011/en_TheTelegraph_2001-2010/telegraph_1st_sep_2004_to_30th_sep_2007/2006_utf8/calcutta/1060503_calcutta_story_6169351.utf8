The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 A shirt to 

 match every mood

 With the Indian fashion industry 

 tilted heavily in favour of the fairer sex, its truly 

 tough for the metrosexual man to beat his wife/girlfriend 

 at the designer wear game.

 If the lack of designer mens 

 wear stores in the city upsets your style quotient, heres 

 some good news for you.

 Tucked away off the EM Bypass 

 Park Circus connector at 98, Christopher Road, is Three 

 By Four, a boutique that is home to exclusive designer shirts 

 for men.

 The brainchild of designer Neha 

 Sharaff, the 850 sq ft showroom at Brindavan Gardens, Building-3, 

 fourth floor, has come a long way since opening its doors 

 in October 2004.

 Neha, from an IT background, decided 

 to dump her nine to seven job and give 

 designing a try in the space she had. The fascination 

 for shirts and the endeavour to give the city something 

 different finally resulted in a venture like this, 

 smiles Neha.

 She started the store housing 

 an array of designer labels, in addition to her in-house 

 label 99 Grams. The growing popularity of 99 Grams was encouragement 

 enough to gradually do away with the other brands.

 Today, 99 Grams also finds rack 

 space at fashion stores like Ayamik and Amara in Mumbai 

 and Elahe in Hyderabad.

 The store with its simple and 

 minimalist decor gives a feeling of ample space and warmth. 

 Candles placed on your left against a bright red backdrop 

 as you enter, glass racks with yellow lighting from below 

 and beautiful ceiling lamps add a dash of glamour to the 

 decor.

 Style see

 Fashionable and sophisticated, 

 yet funky. That in a nutshell describes my collection. I 

 see to it that the shirt adds character and confidence to 

 the personality of the wearer, says Neha.

 Simple, flashy, printed, embroidered... 

 The range will spoil you for choice. After all, a 

 wardrobe should provide something to match every mood and 

 occasion. The Calcutta male perhaps is a little less experimental, 

 but the mentality is fast changing and he is opening up 

 to fashion in a big way, points out Neha.

 The fabrics are sourced from places 

 like Bangkok, Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. And to maintain 

 the exclusivity quotient, a particular design 

 and fabric is available in limited pieces.

 For summers, cotton and linen 

 rule and for winters it is corduroy, thick cotton lycra 

 and denims. The colour palette is also in sync with the 

 season. As the mercury soars, cool pastels, lime green, 

 ice pink, beige and white (the all-time favourite) 

 rule the racks. 

 Far from the boring circular ones, 

 the button story revolves around mother of pearl, press 

 buttons and square-shaped ones.

 Formal front

 The formal section sees a harmonious 

 blend of sober stylisation and funk. The shirts here come 

 in splashes of brown, black, ochre, white, sky-blue and 

 more.

 Simple textured shirts and those 

 peppered with tapes or tiny patches all over are definite 

 eye-catchers. Chikan shirts in pristine white are 

 very summery in look and feel. Those with an eye for linear 

 designs can opt for straight or diagonal stripes, while 

 the adventurous lot can go for the unfinished look.

 Then there are the tie-and-dye 

 ones with denim appeal. Printed white shirts with thin silver 

 borders on the collar look smart, too.

 Prices start from Rs 1,350.

 Party time

 With striking contrasts and a 

 fusion of abstract and traditional designs, the party section 

 sees a lot of innovation.

 White shirts are adorned with 

 applique work in bright reds and oranges. Those with texturing 

 on the back and cuffs look trendy. The nature-printed ones 

 are highlighted with glitters here and there. Some with 

 thin piping and trimmings look interesting. Also find shirts 

 with patchwork all over.

 The price tag reads Rs 1,150-plus.

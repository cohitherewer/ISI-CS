 One of the biggest residential projects coming up in Calcutta, Uniworld City, unveiled its model apartment at its Universal City pavilion on Friday.

 The project, spread over 100 acres in New Town (Rajarhat) Action Area I, is being promoted by Bengal Unitech Universal, a joint venture between Universal Success Enterprises, Indonesia, and Delhi-based Unitech Limited.

 Involved in developing the estate are some of the worlds leading architects, landscape artists and urban planners.

 We plan to make Uniworld City a benchmark for urban living in Calcutta, said Prasoon Mukherjee, director, Bengal Unitech Universal. 

 The project has been conceptualised around a central spine or boulevard, designed as a series of urban plazas.

 Its not just about building an apartment complex anymore. Consumers are not satisfied with that concept any longer and therefore, real estate developers have to offer so much more. Uniworld City offers a lifestyle, explained Mukherjee.

 The project comprises four phases Garden, Horizons, Heights and Downtown. The outlay has been pegged at Rs 2,500 crore. The first phase, Garden, is likely to be ready by end-2007.

 Apart from the residential estate, the company is setting up an information technology park, a logistic hub off Kona Expressway and a state-of-the-art convention centre-cum-hotel. The total investment will be around Rs 10,000 crore. 

 Bengal is now a good place to be in for business. There is a huge demand for quality residential and commercial development. In fact, there is a shortage of almost 90,000 dwelling units every year. Even with the scale of development taking place right now, it is next to impossible to meet the demand, said Mukherjee.

 He also stressed the need to work out the new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines that practically prohibit banks from lending money to realtors to buy land.

 The RBI obviously has its reasons for laying down the guidelines, but once the interest rates level out in a couple of years at the most and realty assumes a more organised look, well most probably witness the next level of growth, signed off Mukherjee.

 Laughter lines: Rauf Lala 

 after the win

 What did Tarzan say on seeing a dead cheetah? ?Thank God, there lies my new

 underwear!? No wonder Rauf Lala is hailed as the baap of one-liners. The man from Pakistan edged past an entire flock of funnymen to emerge as the Hasi Ka Shahenshah at the Great Indian Laughter Challenge Dwitiya.

 A veteran comedian based in Karachi, the 40-year-old Rauf has done lots of theatre and movies and has even worked with the legendary Omar Sharif. He may be a master at comedy but he himself loves watching horror movies. A die-hard fan of Amitabh Bachchan, Rauf has also done cricket commentary.

 Winning the Laughter Champion crown was an emotional affair for the man. When Rauf told his wife about his win, she was so overwhelmed that she kept on crying and the phone eventually had to be disconnected to stop her.

 Now, back home with his family, Rauf is expecting Dia Mirza to turn up at his place. He had invited the Bollywood actress addressing her as ?kadakti bijli?.

 He may be back after 19 long years but now there?s no stopping Superman. The mania around the Man of Steel has gripped the INOX properties at Forum and City Centre. Don?t be surprised if you catch plex patrons dressed up as Superman walking in to catch Superman Returns. Because if you are seen sporting the famous ?S? on blue, you stand to win Patchi chocolate vouchers.

 The kids, of course, are getting first preference as they turn up in the signature red-and-blue combination.

 There?s more. A live Superman ? may not exactly be Brandon Routh ? will be interacting with patrons and giving away exciting prizes. ?There?s a lot of hype around the movie and it has taken off very well at our plexes,? says INOX (Forum) general manager Vikas Syal. ?So we have planned events and contests around the film.?

 It?s a must in Mumbai ? to sing along with the national anthem before the start of every movie screening. Now, Calcutta will be part of the patriotic action and that too with a twist. Shringar Cinemas Limited, in collaboration with BharatBala Productions, has launched A.R. Rahman?s soulful rendition of Jana gana mana at Fame (Hiland Park). 

 The video of the anthem will be screened prior to every show at the Fame properties across India. The first screening of the video was held at Fame Adlabs in Andheri, Mumbai, in the presence of musical maestros involved in the unique initiative like Rahman himself, Pandit Jasraj and Kavita Krishnamurthy. 

 Announcing the launch, Shravan Shroff, managing director of Shringar Cinemas, said: ?We believe that this powerful rendition of the anthem created by A.R. Rahman and BharatBala Productions will appeal to the young and old alike, instilling a fresh sense of pride. We are proud to be the first and only multiplex chain in the country to introduce this moving and awe-inspiring performance of the national anthem.?

 More accolades have come Channel [V]?s way, regarded as the country?s numero uno music channel. It has won an awards haul at the prestigious PROMAX amp; BDA World Gold Awards in NewYork. This is the second time in a row that Channel [V] was given the illustrious 2006 Rocket Award. 

 The Rocket Award recognises a producer, marketeer or designer with four or less years of experience in promotion, marketing or design, and already creating outstanding work.

 The recipient of this year?s award is Channel [V] producer Siddharth Sikand. 

 Speaking on the occasion, Amar K. Deb, head honcho of the music channel, said: ?It?s a fabulously mind-blowing experience to be recognised by our peers internationally. All of us at Channel [V] are ecstatic and overjoyed to have won in the face of stiff international competition. These awards are sure to power the team to continue to?re-design? Indian television.?

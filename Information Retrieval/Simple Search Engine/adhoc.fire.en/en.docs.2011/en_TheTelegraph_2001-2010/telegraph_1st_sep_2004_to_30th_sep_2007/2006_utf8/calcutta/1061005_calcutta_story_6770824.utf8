 Wall wows, season-wise

 Colour Story

 Smita Roy Chowdhury

 Your bedrooms got a Sabyasachi 

 touch with the bedspreads, pillows and cushions wearing 

 the star designers signature. Now, its time 

 for your walls to get a stylish makeover with designer shades 

 from the house of Berger Paints.

 For, the leading paint firm has 

 engaged National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), 

 Calcutta, to develop shades in accordance with seasonal 

 colour forecasts.

 Apart from paint, textile 

 is an industry where a lot of research happens on colours. 

 So, we asked NIFT to develop some shades for us in sync 

 with colour forecasts and consumer preferences, season-wise. 

 They have presented a compilation of colours for spring-summer 

 2007 and are already working on autumn-winter 2007-08, 

 revealed Raja Banerjee, group product manager of Berger 

 Paints.

 Its a first-of-its-kind 

 project because I dont think any paint company has 

 ever approached a fashion institute to develop colours for 

 them. Our faculty members and some students got together 

 to develop the shades. The idea was to take into account 

 forecast fashion colours for the season and modify the textile 

 shades to paint shades, explained Shantmanu, director, 

 NIFT, Calcutta.

 The Salt Lake-based institute 

 has developed 40 basic shades and 200 modified ones, broken 

 up into themes like Eden, Anti-Modern, New Look, Passion, 

 Natural Elegance and more. 

 A shade book comprising colour 

 schemes will be launched in end-October and made available 

 with dealer outlets, architects and interior designers. 

 The look is very bright and lively, with the main 

 hues being shades of yellow, green, magenta, pink and neutrals 

 like earthy grey and beige, shared Prosenjit Bhadra, 

 assistant professor at NIFT.

 Were working on the 

 autumn-winter line now and the look for that will be a little 

 dull, he added.

 When it comes to paints, a major 

 shift in consumer preferences is being witnessed. Theres 

 a move away from pastels and whites, which were primarily 

 the hues that dominated till a few years ago, to intermediate 

 and bright colours. Today, people are painting the house 

 exterior in bright hues and even ceilings, which were always 

 white as a rule, are getting colourful makeovers, 

 observed Banerjee of Berger.

 But there is no grammar 

 being followed in this. So, to introduce a method to this 

 madness we thought of the project with NIFT, he added.

 The shade book will offer detailed 

 displays of the colour schemes and different combinations 

 in house interiors and exteriors.

 A preview service available with 

 Berger Paints will enable you to actually find out how a 

 particular colour scheme will look on your house before 

 making the choice. We offer the preview system by 

 which a consumer can send a photograph of his/her house 

 to us. We scan the picture and present it with different 

 colour combinations for the consumer to choose from, 

 explained Banerjee.

 So, while you update your wardrobe 

 every season to keep pace with current trends, get ready 

 to put a fresh coat of paint on your walls to match the 

 seasons mood. 

 And this is no one-off venture. 

 This will be an ongoing project with NIFT and we will 

 keep on upgrading the shade book every season, said 

 Banerjee.

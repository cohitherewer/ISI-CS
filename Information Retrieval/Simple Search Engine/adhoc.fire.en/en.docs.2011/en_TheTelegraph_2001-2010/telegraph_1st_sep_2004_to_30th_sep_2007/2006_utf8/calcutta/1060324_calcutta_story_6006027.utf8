 Baby hit on head before burial

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The 10-day-old baby, whose body was found buried in the compound of a Jodhpur Park house on Wednesday, was possibly dealt a blow on the head before being interred. 

 That is the preliminary finding of the post-mortem, conducted on Thursday afternoon at the Kantapukur morgue.

 ?It appears that the baby suffered a heavy injury on the head and died. Subsequently, it was buried. The injury is internal and on the left side of the head. The body had started to decompose by the time it was put on the table. The injury marks are internal but they are there for sure,? said the doctor who performed the post-mortem.

 Officers of Lake police station probing the case have sought from the gynaecology and obstetrics units of local nursing homes details of the new-borns, particularly over the past 10 days. 

 Besides, samples of loose earth from the spot the baby was buried have been sent for forensic examination.

 The police claim the choice of the site for burying the child ? the premises of 285A, Jodhpur Park ? is significant. 

 ?It appears the culprits chose the narrow stretch to avoid immediate detection. If it was just about burying a baby, why didn?t they choose the small square plot in the backyard? We?re also looking into the details of all outsiders, including the domestic help of the tenant, who would visit the house every day,? said an officer of Lake police station.

 Curiously, the pots and the small patch of ground in the Ghosh house had been lying unattended for days. On Wednesday, landlady Bithi asked her gardener, Yudhistir Koyal, to clean the place. The body was discovered during the clean-up.

 ?It was only yesterday that I asked Yudhistir to clean the place and plant new saplings. I noticed from the first floor that some loose mud was lying around the stretch and I asked him to remove it as well. He suddenly came up saying that he had found a baby. I have no clue why anyone would choose my house,? Bithi said.

 Police claim that more than one person was involved, and that the culprits did not choose the house next door ? 285 ? despite its big lawn, probably because a durwan guarded the gate at night. 

 So, they scaled the small gate of the Ghosh house and walked in, unhindered.

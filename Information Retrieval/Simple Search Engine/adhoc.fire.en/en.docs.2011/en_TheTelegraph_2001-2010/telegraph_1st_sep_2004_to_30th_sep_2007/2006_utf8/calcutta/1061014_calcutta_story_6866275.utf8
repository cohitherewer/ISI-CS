 Build rules relaxed in Salt Lake

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The building rules for Salt Lake are becoming more flexible, 20 years after they were framed.

 Responding to the long-standing 

 demands from residents, the government is relaxing some 

 norms relating to rooms, garages and basement .

 Framed by the urban development department, the West Bengal Municipal (Buildings) Rules, 2006, has been placed in the budget session of the Assembly. A separate set of building rules for Salt Lake was enforced in 1985.

 The dominant demand for allowing an additional floor in existing buildings has been rejected for lack of civic infrastructure, but construction of one room, measuring 10 sq m, and a bathroom of 3.5 sq m will be allowed on the roof.

 In cooperative housing estates, construction of an additional room will be permitted in the garage space, and treated as servants quarters.

 Another plus for residents is the scope to construct two flats on each floor on plots of five cottahs and more. According to the existing rule, whatever be the plot size, a flat cannot be split into two or more.

 There are two additions to the rulebook a basement and a prayer room on top of the staircase will be allowed. But the basement will have to be used only for assembly and get-togethers.

 Another flexibility factor is that if one fails to complete construction of a building, he/she can simply inform the civic authorities and resume work later.

 The rules have been tabled in the Assembly, but are yet to come into effect. We have noticed some anomalies in the new rules. We are examining the rules to ensure they benefit the most number of people. The revised rules will come into effect very soon, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

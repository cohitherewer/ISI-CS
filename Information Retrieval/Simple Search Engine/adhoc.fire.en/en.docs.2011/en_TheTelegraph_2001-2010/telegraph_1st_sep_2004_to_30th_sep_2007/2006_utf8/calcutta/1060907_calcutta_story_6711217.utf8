 Get shorty: The new look Bipasha Basu in town 

on Wednesday. Picture by Pabitra Das

Its just short, she squealed, tired of answering 

yet another question on her hairstyle. A pause later, Bipasha Basu came up with 

the explanation: Its just that I have kept my hair long for a long time and 

I dont remember seeing myself in short hair. So I just got it short.

Looking distinctly different from the last time she 

was here to discuss Kaalpurush with Buddhadeb Dasgupta the girl from 

Mandeville Gardens looked at ease as she answered questions after handing over 

the heavy Playwin cheque to Jay Prakash Jaiswal. Just dont ask me personal questions, 

was the request at the outset. Read John Abraham and the India Day Parade organisers 

of New Jersey who have threatened to sue her for breach of contract.

The former supermodel sounded ecstatic about the giant 

strides Indian designers are taking in the world of fashion. Just look at Sabyasachi, 

Bipasha said. I knew him as Pepsi, this little Calcutta boy. And now I find his 

clothes selling at Harrods alongside the Christian Diors. It really makes me 

so proud. Not only him, Wendell Rodricks, Malini Ramani, they are all so good. 

But my favourite continues to be Rocky S, who is a friend and also my stylist.

Talking about movies, the Corporate queen is 

looking forward to Dhoom 2 even though John Abraham isnt in the scheme 

of things. I am not allowed to talk about the film but all I can say is that 

it is a visual delight, she said. It is basically an action comedy with some 

wonderful locales. You will know the rest when the film releases on November 24.

Bipasha has also signed two other movies, both with 

the director duo Abbas-Mustan, with whom she had worked in Ajnabee early 

in her career. One of them is on hold because of Sanjay Dutt and the other is 

with Saif Ali Khan, revealed the actress.

Sounding almost desperate to do a Bengali film, Bipasha 

said that she has verbally agreed to Rituparno Ghoshs Draupadi and cant 

wait for it to start. Lets see, it should happen next year, she smiled.

If it doesnt, its unlikely for Bipasha to return 

to Calcutta real soon. I cant even come here for Durga Puja, she sounded a 

tad sad. My parents also have now moved to Mumbai, but they would be coming to 

Calcutta during Puja. I would have to celebrate it in Mumbai with my elder and 

younger sisters. How I miss the Pujas here!

And we miss you.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Off train tracks, to retail racks

 - Delhi developer keen to exploit mall potential of Metro Railway stations

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Retail space created at Delhi?s Tis Hazari Metro station

 Hop off the train and pick up your provisions or a surprise gift for the little one. You could even replenish your wallet at the ATMs and doggy-pack some TV dinner. All this, before you emerge from down under.

 Parsvnath Developers Ltd, which is developing 2.2 million sq ft of retail space in and around 10 stations of the Delhi Metro, is now keen to do organised retail linked to the Calcutta Metro. 

 The group?s prime focus: the 22-ft clearance between the concrete Metro shell and the road level that lies totally unutilised.

 ?We have been associated with the Metro Rail Corporation in the Capital to develop retail malls linked to stations on a BOT (build-operate-transfer) basis. The Calcutta underground offers a readymade opportunity to do integrated retail, with the idle shell as the spine, supported by the surplus land in and around the stations,? Pradeep Jain, chairman of the Delhi-based group, told Metro on Tuesday.

 Parsvnath, which has invested over Rs 800 crore in ambient retail and two prime residential projects linked to the Delhi underground, would like to take up all 17 stations of the Calcutta Metro to develop retail space in various formats, from integrated malls to supermarkets to multi-brand outlets.

 ?Our survey has shown that on an average, each station on the Calcutta tube trail would yield at least 20,000 to 30,000 sq ft of space where formatted retail can be introduced,? said Pawan Gupta, who has been anchoring the three-month city recce by Parsvnath.

 Jain sees a quot;win-win situation quot; 

 for all the parties involved - the Metro Rail authorities, 

 the retailer and the consumer. quot;Our research shows 

 that the entire cost of the Delhi Metro could be recovered 

 through linked retail and real estate activity around the 

 stations. In Calcutta, too, huge revenue can be generated 

 through retail, quot; he stressed.

 City-based think-tank organisation 

 Centre for Built Environment (CBE) had earlier pushed a 

 proposal to use the inactive Metro Rail shell as the core 

 to create parking and shopping options between Park Street 

 and Esplanade tube stations.

 quot;Logistically, its 

 quite simple and doesnt entail any mega construction 

 activity. Whatever little needs to be done could also have 

 been avoided, had the Metro and the city civic authorities 

 put their heads together when the tube rail plan was conceived, quot; 

 architect-planner Unmesh Kirtikar of CBE, the brain behind 

 the model, had said.

 Parsvnath officials plan to meet 

 the city Metro authorities soon with a concrete retail-rendezvous 

 proposal, even promising to take responsibility of maintenance 

 of the immediate vicinity and upgrade infrastructure. quot;The 

 international elevation, sought-after brands, swank eateries 

 and allied entertainment can create invaluable assets, as 

 in the capital, quot; Jain pointed out.

 The groups Delhi Metro retail 

 initiative spans the Tis Hazari station with a 60,000-sq-ft, 

 multi-brand outlet on one end of the spectrum and the Seelampur 

 stop at the other, where Parsvnath is creating a quot;destination quot; 

 with split-level parking, boating, shopping mall, star hotel, 

 cineplex and a ropeway.

 The realtor, currently developing 

 64 million sq ft pan-India, is keen to take on lease the 

 pillars that punctuate the Metro tracks as well. 

 quot;As in Delhi, these pillars 

 can be used for advertisement billboards with the clause 

 that greenery is created around them and the filth cleared, quot;said 

 Jain.

 Parsvnath is also bidding for 

 the 330-acre IT hub between Rajarhat and the airport and 

 is quot;close to sealing a property in the heart of the 

 city quot; for a high-end residential condominium project. 

 Destination malls of quot;over a million sq ft quot; are 

 also on the cards.

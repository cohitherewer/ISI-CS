 Contemporary arts and writers? cafes, more language lessons prompted by the IT surge and all that jazz, better bonding with books, the return of Rimini-Protokoll with its hugely successful mobile theatre project and the Partition perspective?

 Fifty years of cultural exchange have given Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) a base for stronger ties with the country and the Goethe-Institut is keen to further that bridge by looking at the ?reflection of India?s transformation? in its various art forms.

 ?India is a top priority for the institute and Calcutta, where the changing face of modern India finds some of its finest and most intense forms of expression, is surely a thrust area,? Stefan Dreyer, regional director, south Asia, Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, tells Metro. Contemporary, cutting-edge German arts and culture is where the sharp focus of MMB Calcutta would lie, he stresses.

 ?The extremely positive response to the MMB brand in Calcutta and the highly receptive audience here is encouraging and gives us the impetus to try and bond even better. We realise the importance of engaging local partners and understanding the vernacular context. Hence, our respective directors enjoy a great degree of autonomy in developing their own programmes,? Dreyer says.

 The German culture institute is considering a reorientation of its library concept again, after a two-year experiment with the new format. ?Yes, we might bring back a bit of the old concept and blend it suitably with the existing model to answer the needs of our members,? MMB Calcutta director Martin Waelde adds. The new format is expected to be rolled out by this year-end.

 The experimental German Resource Centre at MMB houses a ?small but continually-updated selection? of the latest print and audio-visual media in German and English. Members can?t borrow media, but may make use of the external borrowing or document delivery service to order material from the Regional Information Centre at the Goethe-Institut in New Delhi.

 Demand for courses in German language has also soared in Calcutta, fuelled largely by the new service sectors keen to explore opportunities in Germany. ?We are being increasingly approached by IT majors, BPOs and call centres for group lessons, and we are trying to find ways to cater to this huge and growing demand, even if we have to fly in more teachers from Germany,? Waelde promises.

 The Frankfurt Book Fair later this year ? where India is the partner country ? is another platform the institute is keen to exploit to present and facilitate Indian contemporary arts and culture. ?The curtain-raiser to the fair has already been launched in Leipzig in March, where we have had a large delegation of Indian writers with reading sessions and cafes. This will be carried forward at Frankfurt, where we?ll have the culmination of the writers? exchange programme with seven German authors reflecting their views and sharing experiences with their Indian counterparts,? says Dreyer.

 Waelde expects ?at least 10,000 articles on India in the German press? during the Frankfurt Book Fair, where the size of the international media is expected to be even bigger than the delegation to cover the football World Cup. Zubin Mehta couldn?t be presented in Calcutta because of ?time constraints?, explains the south Asia chief of MMB. ?However, we are alive to the fact that Calcutta has a very evolved audience for western classical music, as it has for mainstream jazz. We would love to feed that demand, while also introducing modern and progressive elements like electronica and DJ tunes,? he adds.

 Dreyer and Waelde are confident the Partition project, originally planned for the end of this year can be stitched together by the ?first half of next year?. The multi-vehicle programme will explore the impact of Partition on intellectual and political fields of cities like Berlin, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Dhaka and Mexico City, besides on their films, theatre, music, etc.

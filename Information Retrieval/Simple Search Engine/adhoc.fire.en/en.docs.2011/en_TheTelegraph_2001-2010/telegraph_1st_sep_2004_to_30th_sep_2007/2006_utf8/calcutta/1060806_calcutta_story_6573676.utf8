 Why Abhishek Motoslvr Bachchan 

 threatens to turn the brand-star debate on its head 

 It is time to turn the question 

 around. In marketing, the usual debate is why do brands 

 need stars in their advertising. This time, the flip side 

 of the same query has become pertinent: why does a star 

 lend his presence to a brand? There is a very good reason 

 to raise this question. Yes, you guessed it right. The issue 

 that really needs to be understood is why Abhishek Bachchan 

 agreed to do the self-deprecating Motoslvr ads (picture 

 right at a promotional for the phone).

 But more about that later. First 

 it would be useful to understand what prompts a star to 

 accept an advertising assignment. The simple answer to this 

 will be to make some quick money. If you are wondering why 

 our super rich stars would need such extra money, dont 

 waste your time.

 Firstly, no one ever has enough 

 money and secondly the sum of money involved in the 30-second 

 advertising films is fairly large. One of the smaller deals 

 that Amitabh Bachchan signed recently allegedly involved 

 a fee of Rs 6 crore, not a mean sum even for a superstar.

 Indeed, return on investment per 

 day of shooting is significantly higher in advertising films 

 compared to feature films. It is also true that stars do 

 not do any and every advertising film that comes their way, 

 whatever be the financial rewards.

 Weighed against the money are 

 very serious considerations about their primary profession. 

 Usually the first screening is the product category. Some 

 fight shy of alcohol and tobacco. Some would not be seen 

 dead in an undergarment ad and so on.

 Past this first post, stars then 

 examine the script. Perhaps justifiably, they are concerned 

 about the impact the advertising will have on their star 

 value and their star image. So they tend to prefer scripts 

 with ample scope either for histrionics or for expanding 

 the halo around their head. There is always a give and take 

 between money and image.

 It is in the light of this trade-off 

 that Abhishek Bachchans appearance in the Motoslvr ads 

 becomes intriguing. We have no idea how much money was paid 

 and whether the offer was irresistible on that count. What 

 seems reasonably clear is that the Bachchan Junior has broken 

 all the rules of the image game.

 A Hindi film star is always on 

 the winning side. He is always the nice guy, the brave guy, 

 the honest guy. Or of late, at least a guy who atones for 

 his past sins and becomes a martyr. Abhishek is already 

 a star. More crucially, post Bunty Aur Babli and 

 Sarkar, he is a superstar in the making.

 More than anyone else he needs 

 to toe the image protection laws of the industry. Yet, Abhishek 

 Bachchan has done exactly the opposite in these two ads 

 for Motorola. In one he plays the obnoxious, full-of-himself 

 hero. In the other, he is an unabashed womaniser confident 

 of picking up a girl in a bar. Both are characters that 

 people can dislike easily. More importantly, both are eventual 

 losers. At this juncture, let us remind ourselves we are 

 not talking about hypothetical characters of an advertising 

 film. In both, Abhishek plays Abhishek.

 Someone said that a hero is someone 

 you admire without an apology. On the face of it, Bachchan 

 Junior seems to challenge this proposition. But if you ponder 

 for a while, another possibility may strike you.

 Abhishek Bachchan could well be 

 adopting a Brechtian strategy. He wants to remind his fans 

 that he and the characters he plays are always different, 

 even if they have the same name and profession. One should 

 not be confused with the other. Indeed, he too perhaps wants 

 to be admired without an apology, but only for his screen 

 persona. He wishes to keep Abhishek the flesh and blood 

 person private. In an image-crazy industry, this brand has 

 set its own rules for creating the reflection.

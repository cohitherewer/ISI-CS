 The five-phase Assembly polls in Bengal threaten to put on hold the academic careers of more than 150,000 students of Calcutta University.

 Minutes after the Election Commission announced the poll dates, the university officials convened an emergency meeting and decided to defer all undergraduate examinations for the current year.

 Those appearing for Part II are likely to be inconvenienced the most as the delay could affect their prospects of pursuing postgraduate studies in other states or even abroad. The Part II examinations were slated to be held from April 18. 

 After the election dates were announced, officials of the state higher education department directed the university authorities not to hold any examinations between April 17 and May 10.

 ?We are shocked by the Election Commission?s decision. We had sent the examination schedule of the entire year to the Commission in December. It is unfortunate that it did not take into account the fate of our students, particularly of the 70,000-odd Part II examinees,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of the university.

 The university officials declared that the Part II examinations would be held after May 15, once the polling was over. The revised dates of the Part II examinations will be announced shortly, they said.

 ?I might not be able to pursue an MBA course this year if my Part II result is not declared on time,? rued Srirupa Mukherjee, a Part II examinee of Gokhale Memorial College. 

 According to Onkar Sadhan Adhikary, controller of examinations of the university, the postponement of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II examinations will push back the academic programmes of the entire year.

 This would force the deferment of the Part I examinations, scheduled to be held in May and June.

 The publication of results will, consequently, be delayed. Hence, commencement of postgraduate classes will also be pushed back.

 ?We will have to begin the 2006-07 session of the MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses at the end of September. Normally, the first-year postgraduate classes start in the first week of August,? the pro vice-chancellor added.

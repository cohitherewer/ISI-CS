 Biz boost beckons recruiter 

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 Bengal Inc. seems to be on course and is even poised for a quantum leap, if one goes by what TeamLease associate director Nirupama V.G. has to say. 

 TeamLease, one of India?s leading staffing solutions and recruitment organisations, has a bullish outlook on the state of affairs in Bengal and is predicting a bright future for the state?s industry.

 ?The situation here is much better than what it was even two years ago. If one goes by the current recruitment pattern in the state, there is a lot to get excited about. The recruitment industry of Bengal generates about Rs 60 crore annually, but that should go up to Rs 600 crore by 2008,? said Nirupama.

 ?Bengal should capture a substantial percentage of the recruitment revenues generated in India within the next two years. The market is growing and evolving rapidly. Entrepreneurship is on the rise and there are a number of initiatives taking off,? she added.

 According to her, the placement scenario in the state is quite positive and is bound to get even better. 

 TeamLease recently conducted two employment outlook surveys with Gallup and Businessworld and found that Calcutta was amongst the most prosperous and industry-friendly cities in India. 

 The salaries in the city, lower than Mumbai or Bangalore, are going to shoot up as well, and be on a par with the rest of the country in a year or two, the surveys found. 

 ?The recruiting profile in Calcutta is better than the rest of India and the city is becoming an attractive option,? felt Nirupama.

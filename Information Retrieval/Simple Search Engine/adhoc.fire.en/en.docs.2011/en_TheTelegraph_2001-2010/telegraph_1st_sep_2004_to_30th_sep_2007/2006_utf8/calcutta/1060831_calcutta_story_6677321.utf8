 Of dreams and death

 The futility of dreams and lofty ideals in todays materialistic, competitive world is the subject matter of Nandikars production, Feriwalaar Mrityu. The Bengali adapatation of Arthur Millers The Death of a Salesman, the plays protagonist, Amalkanti, is an erstwhile smart-talking confident salesman, now reduced to a shadow of his former self. While selling dreams to others all his life, he had dreamt of happiness and contentment in his own life as well. But the unfortunate peddler of dreams did not know life had other plans in store for him. Now old and infirm, he regrets the fading away of the way of life he had held so dear. Wistfully dreaming of the happy days of yore, he refuses to acknowledge the harsh reality of his present, and continues to labour under false hopes of better days ahead. His pride prevents him from reaching out to his near and dear ones, and he further recoils into a shell of loneliness. Finally, he seeks refuge in death, which alone can release him from his torment. Adapted and directed by Rudraprasad Sengupta.

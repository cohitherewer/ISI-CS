 The portico collapse on Kiran Shankar Roy Road on Monday has turned the focus back on condemned buildings, with the civic authorities expressing concern over the increasing number of such structures.

 The building department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has prepared a list of 1,245 unsafe buildings and slapped notices on 700 of them.

 According to an estimate, there are over 75,000 unsafe buildings between Shyambazar and Tollygunge and the number of unsafe buildings will cross a lakh by 2020.

 The concentration of unsafe buildings is more in north and central Calcutta than in the south, the highest being in borough V, comprising the Sealdah, Rajabazar, Bowbazar, College Street, CR Avenue and the Colootolla Street areas.

 According to director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol, the engineering longevity of over 30 per cent of the buildings in Calcutta proper have long expired. The structures should either be thoroughly reinforced or razed and built anew.

 We must take a strong stand against condemned buildings and are moving in that direction, following Mondays incident in which one person was killed, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.

 The mayor held the tenancy act, the long-drawn legal process and negative attitude of local political leaders responsible for the large number of unsafe buildings in the city. 

 The buildings have become no ones property, as neither landlords nor tenants are willing to cough up money for their upkeep.

 It is impossible to bring about an urban renewal in Calcutta if these buildings are left untouched, he asserted.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay feels the civic body should have the right to raze a condemned building, though in the present socio-economic condition, such moves should not be devoid of sensitivity.

 Mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De pointed out that almost all unsafe buildings are either occupied by tenants who have been staying for decades or involved in litigation. Most of the legal cases are between the tenants and landlords. We have razed two vacant, unsafe buildings in Tollygunge, said De.

 Ram Niwas Goel, father of Lakshmi Devi Gupta, has demanded a thorough probe into the circumstances leading to her daughters death.

 Asked whether he was hinting at murder, Goel, 60, said: I cant say for sure what had happened, as I was not present. It is up to police and the court to unravel the mystery.

 Lakshmi Devi allegedly set herself on fire when police, armed with an order from a Sealdah court, came calling at her in-laws house in Salt Lakes FE block on Wednesday to evict her. A prolonged legal battle between the woman, who was also fighting a divorce suit, and father-in-law Ram Kumar Gupta resulted in the eviction order.

 Lakshmi Devis father-in-law, husband Shiv Kumar and brother-in-law Pawan Kumar were arrested on Thursday on charges of torture and abetment of suicide. Police said chargesheets will be filed against the three soon.

 Goel said his daughters was a negotiated marriage. I gave the Guptas a handsome dowry, including ornaments worth Rs 5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh in cash. We spent Rs 14 lakh-plus for the wedding.

 He alleged that the Guptas had secured the eviction order from the Sealdah third civil judge court by producing forged documents. A divorce suit filed by my son-in-law was being heard by the Barasat court, which had ordered that Lakshmi could not be evicted from the Salt Lake address till the case was disposed of.

 Lakshmi Devis brother Gourishankar Goel, however, claimed his sister had been killed by her husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law. 

 The day my sister was killed, I visited the house and found the lock of the ground-floor gate broken. Its possible they had entered the room by breaking the lock, poured kerosene on her and set her on fire, he said.

 Gourishankar also accused police of conniving with the Guptas to hush up the case. From the beginning, police have been behaving in a strange way. First, they refused to register our complaints. Now, they are trying to pass off the death as suicide. I doubt whether police will ever investigate the case properly.

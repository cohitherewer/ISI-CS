 A keen understanding of the human predicament and a feeling of empathy with the hardships and adversities of others distinguish the works by artists of Rapport. The ongoing exhibition of their paintings and sculptures presents an interesting assortment of works that is starkly realistic on the one hand, yet romantic and illusory on the other. With their subject-matter drawn mainly from real-life scenes, events and incidents, they portray reality clothed in an element of almost dreamlike fantasy. Ranging from simplistic line-sketches in monochromes to vivid canvases full of rich, bold colours, the works on show have the power to stimulate the imagination of the common art lover. Featuring the works of Shankar Ghosh, Barid Goswami, Pintu Paul (one of his paintings appears above), Malay Datta, Dinonath Saha, Ashis Chatterjee, Souradeep Saha, Prasanna Chaudhuri, Sankar Bhowmick and Indrajit Ghosh.

 Jack Nicholson and Martin Scorsese 

 , though they have been friends and known one anothers 

 movies for 30-odd years, collaborated for the first time 

 in The Departed (now running in city theatres).

 Nicholsons character did not exist in the original frame of the story, so the actor had the opportunity to embellish, with director and screenwriter, how he saw and experienced gangland boss Frances Frank Costello, who has created a small criminal empire in South Boston.

 The breakthrough was when we decided that conceptually hes a monster, and included his sexuality in the character, says Nicholson. Hes like a mad god who understood at one time in the world there was morality, and knows that there is no longer any, Scorsese describes.

 Costello is in a sense a person who has gone beyond that, and has gotten too old and too crazy to give a damn about anything really anymore. And why should he? Hes had all the power, and is pretty invincible, really. He puts himself in the front lines of drug deals, at his age. He doesnt even have to do that; its just for the thrill of it. But he cant get any more thrills, really. He has seen his days; hes on his way out, and he doesnt care.

 Though the character of Costello is exceedingly dark, Scorsese sees those characters orbiting around him as basically decent people. Im interested in people who are decent or good who, whether its something in their nature, upbringing, circumstances, or whatever, end up doing bad things, says Scorsese.

 I dont even think at this point, given the sense that it is an undeclared war zone, its the issue of whether there is morality left at all in whats happening with these people.

 Nicholson credits the director with setting his vision in motion with insightful and astute casting. One of cinemas most revered and charismatic actors, Nicholson found himself surprised by the experience of being directed by his longtime friend.

 You dont know what its like until you actually do it, he says. And in this case, golly, it was so free! A lot of people use this word, but this was really free. He got the best out of his people. The benchmark of The Departed is its wonderful ensemble cast. All the actors are really great. And since we didnt all work together, to get that kind of thing you have to credit Martin. With me, I just went where I wanted to, and he encouraged it.

 The Asian Development Bank (ADB), state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will fund the second phase of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), to tackle waterlogging, among other problems. 

 We submitted the plan to the state government last week. It will now be sent to the Centre. Floating of tenders and other work will start as soon as we receive the green signal from the governments, said Rajiva Sinha, project director, CEIP.

 The project will cost Rs 1,992 crore, 67 per cent of which will be borne by the ADB, 17 per cent by the state government and the rest by the civic body. It will be implemented between April 2008 and December 2013. 

 The estimated cost of Phase I of the project was about Rs 1,800 crore. The deadline was 2007. It has been extended to 2010. Additional funds have also been granted.

 Under Phase II, Keorapukur canal and Western channel and Rania canal sub-basins of Tollys Nullah will be cleaned, de-silted and re-sectioned. A pumping station will come up on Charial basin. People residing in wards 111-114 and 115, 122 and 123 will benefit. In addition, 29 footbridges will be built over the canals.

 In Phase II, sewerage channels measuring about 655 km will be laid in boroughs 11-15. Seventeen pumping stations will be set up in the boroughs. Two new sewage treatment plants have been proposed at Jaidagor and Kalagachia.

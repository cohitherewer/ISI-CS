 Evoking rich and vivid poetic imagery through the thick, robust marks of his brush, Prokash Karmakar has elevated the art of line drawings to the peak of perfection. Lines Unbound, the ongoing exhibition of his works, offers a fascinating assortment of lively lines that concentrate on expressing the physical beauty of animals. Dedicated in memory of his wife who passed away earlier this month, the show amply proves Karmakar?s exceptional power in wielding the brush. His images, deliberately deviating from realistic representation, nevertheless give an impression of immense energy and passion. Though distorted and contorted, the figures retain the fundamental characteristic of each animal. A combination of thick, strong, dynamic lines generate a palpable tension and energy, sometimes producing a sensation of life-like vibrating movements. Such brilliant animal imagery, ingrained with emotional feeling, certainly marks a special milestone in the creative journey of this celebrated artist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I have nothing to prove as an actor?

 That?s what prompted NASEERUDDIN SHAH to ?come through the looking glass? and don the director?s hat. He tells Pratim D. Gupta about the ?wonderful experience? and why he just wants to be the means to convey a good story, starting with Being Cyrus

 You are known to be very choosy about your projects. What 

 made you do Being Cyrus?

 It was just the kind of film up my alley. I would like to do more films like Being Cyrus. While reading the script I felt it was breaking new grounds. Then, the fact that I was getting to work with a first-time director. In my career, I have worked with more number of first-time directors than other actors. They have a certain hunger and urgency in them, which disappears by the time they do their third or fourth films. Also, Homi Adajania is an extremely gifted film-maker and I wanted to work with him.

 You had said in an interview long back that you are tired 

 of playing Parsi characters. So, why make an exception?

 That?s because Homi made it very clear at the outset that I did not need to speak in a Parsi accent. That made a lot of sense to me. Whenever there?s a Parsi movie, the audience focus is on whether the actors have got their accent right or not. Homi said that it was not important to the story and that we can all speak in regular English. He himself is a Parsi and speaks great English.

 In the recent past, you have been doing a lot of supporting 

 roles rather than heading the cast. Is that a conscious 

 decision?

 I don?t want to obstruct the story. I don?t have to prove my acting capabilities anymore. I am on a trip at the moment where I am not keen on doing great roles. It?s anyway a helluva strain. Also, I feel the right place of an actor is in being a dependable member of the full team. Earlier there was the burning desire to prove myself, to show my versatility. But in the course of my journey I have realised that acting is not the end, it is the means to convey a good story.

 lSo, we won?t get to see the unbridled brilliance of Naseeruddin Shah anymore?

 I do not want to be the focus or centre of everything. I will only be doing projects which are worth my while and something that I can enjoy. I want to pick and help make a good movie without being selfish. Of course, I can say this because I have had my fill as an actor and got my recognition and acclaim and so on...

 Coming back to Being Cyrus, what is your take on 

 your co-star Saif Ali Khan?

 I have always found Saif a very interesting looking guy, from the time he was a kid. I found his looks much more interesting than the other ?better looking? actors in the industry. Now, with time, he has become a marvellous actor. Saif is also very, very funny as an actor and also as a person. It was delightful to work with him.

 His performance in Being Cyrus and in Vishal Bharadwaj?s film (the Othello adaptation, tentatively titled Omkara) will be watershed performances in his career. I don?t know in which direction his career will go from here but he has done some very good work. 

 And you have Dimple Kapadia as your wife...

 Yes Dimple... everybody has been in love with her since she was 18 (laughs). And let me tell you, she is still as gorgeous. What she has added since then is an aura of mystery and pain that surrounds her. That makes her very interesting. Also, she has this elusive quality about her, very charismatic. 

 My definition of charisma is making people curious about you, and Dimple is able to do that. So can Sarika. The best thing about Dimple is that she is determined to extend herself... She is looking more beautiful than she has ever been.

 What do you feel about the rise of the actor in Boman Irani, 

 who plays your brother in the film?

 Oh, Mr Boman the great! What do I say about him? Boms is God. He can do anything. It?s sad that it has taken him so long to be accepted in the film industry. But then again, no two actors ever follow the same path. Boman is getting his due at last. If he needs to do anything at all it is to develop, or rather lose, I?d say, his extreme facility with acting. He shouldn?t find acting so easy.

 What?s the status of your directorial debut, Yun Hota 

 To Kya Hota?

 It?s almost complete. The final mixing is on March 20 and by mid-April, the world will see what I have made.

 What was it like reversing roles and going behind the camera?

 It was like coming through the looking glass. I enjoyed the process very much. I don?t know whether I am cut out for direction or whether I would be able to become an ace film-maker. I haven?t aimed it too high. I had a complete blast during the shooting and it was the most wonderful of experiences.

 The cast of my film ? Irrfan, Konkona, Paresh Rawal, Ayesha ? are all marvellous actors. They are all troopers... I cannot stop talking about them. And they worked for a pittance compared to what they are usually paid. All this makes me feel very gratified.

 Would you rate yourself as a director on the basis of audience 

 response?

 I can?t be oblivious of the audience. I have made the film for people to see. Had I made it for myself, I would have invested my own money. It will definitely disappoint if the film is rejected. But I will judge myself from my own standards. It?s a coherent film where four good stories come together at the end. All I have aspired is to tell the stories well, without obstruction. 

 You have been critical of certain sections of the film industry. 

 Do you fear retaliation now that you are on the other end?

 I have made life hell for many people as an actor and I know that they are out there waiting for my film to release. But I do stand by everything that I have said. All I want is that people should not expect a boring art film because that?s not what I have made.

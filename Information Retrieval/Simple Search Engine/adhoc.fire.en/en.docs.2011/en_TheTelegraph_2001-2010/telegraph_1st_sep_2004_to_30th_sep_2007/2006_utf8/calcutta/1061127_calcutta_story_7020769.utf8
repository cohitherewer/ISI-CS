The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Netizens ahead of online South 

In the fast lane on i-way

 - Cheap computers, easy connectivity shore up citys world wide web stats

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 Bangalore and Hyderabad may lead Calcutta on volume of investment in the information technology (IT) industry, but the city has more Internet users than the southern tech towns.

 The findings are from the Internet in India (I-Cube) study, conducted across the country by the Internet And Mobile Association of India and IMRB International. 

 The figures reveal that only Delhi and Mumbai have more Internet users than Calcutta. While the city boasts 1.34 million Net users, Bangalore has recorded 1.31 million Netizens. The Internet-user count in Hyderabad: 1.29 million.

 There has been a significant increase in usage of Internet in the city over the past few years. Affordable personal computers, slash in connectivity charges and computer literacy programmes in government and private schools have contributed to this phenomenon, said Siddharth, state IT secretary. 

 It is not the swank software offices in Sector V that are generating the Internet traffic. The most comprehensive exercise on Internet usage in the country has found 42 per cent of the users log in to the world wide web from home. 

 Hyderabad, with 46 per cent, is the only city ahead of Calcutta in terms of home-based Internet users. 

 In the home segment, Calcutta has among the highest Internet connectivity in the country, stated Siddharth, adding that the price war among the service providers has fuelled the growth. 

 As Calcuttans crowd the online world, Internet service providers in the city, such as BSNL, Reliance, Airtel, Sify and Tata Indicom, are catering to an increasing demand for connections, both dial-up and broadband. 

 Calcutta has one of the fastest growing broadband markets. The city is only slightly behind Mumbai, which is considered the Mecca of commerce and connectivity, said Deepak Srivastava, chief operating officer (north and east), Airtel Broadband and Telephone services. 

 Public sector telecom major BSNL has witnessed more than 20 per cent increase in the demand for Internet connections, from 250,000 homes to about 300,000. 

 Broadband is driving the growth. Currently, we have around 94,000 connections and we expect to touch the 100,000 mark by March 2007, said S.K. Bhaduri, spokesperson, BSNL. 

 According to the I-Cube study, which also focuses on the nature of Internet usage, the Net users in Calcutta like to mix work with pleasure. 

 While 36 per cent access the Internet to check their e-mails, 30 per cent log in to scout for information related to education. Search for jobs, bargains at e-commerce websites and life partners draw about 26 per cent users among the highest in the country. Approximately eight per cent go online for relaxation and entertainment. 

 The number of online train ticket bookings from Calcutta has gone up five times in less than two years, said a railways official. 

 The city that once resisted the advent of computers has now one of the fastest movers on the information highway. 

 The rate of growth in Internet usage will only pick up even in the remotest corners of the state as the government is determined to take IT to the common man, predicted Siddharth.

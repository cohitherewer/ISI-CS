 Focus shifts to slums social uplift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) has taken up a scheme for social upgrade of slum-dwellers. The project has so far concentrated on improving the citys sewage system. The new scheme will be handled by the CEIPs social development unit.

 There are nearly 5,000 slums, housing 1.5 million people, in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area. 

 Our men are working in wards 1 to 100. We will prepare a project report and submit it to the CMC, hopefully by April 2007, said project director Rajiva Sinha. 

 The CEIP work has been divided into civil and social heads. The civil work includes building of toilets, baths and urinals, and installation of lights and other facilities with funds from the Asian Development Bank.

 The social work is being carried out in the slums on Chetla Hat Road, Turf Road, Chakraberia Road and Panchanantala Road. Work has also been taken up in slums at Tiljala, Shibtala, Mollarhati and other places. 

 Field-level committees of the CEIP are working in the 25 slums. In addition, 31 self-help groups, comprising 295 women and 40 men, have been formed, stated deputy team leader of the CEIP social development unit Ranjana Dasgupta. The self-help groups have been linked to banks so that they can obtain loans. 

 Besides, 200 slum women have been trained in nine vocations, including tailoring and embroidery. As part of the project, CEIP has helped 135 families to open bank accounts.

 In many slums, parents had not registered the birth of their children. Applications have been submitted to the CMC for registration of the births of 1,821 slum children below 14 years, said Dasgupta.

 The CEIP is also running 10 nutrition demonstration camps and 14 mobile health camps in the slums, with the help of NGOs. 

 The study will focus on utilisation of the slum land for residential purposes. According to a plan, one-fourth of the slum area will be used to build houses for the dwellers. A park or community hall will come up in half the area. The remaining land will be used for commercial purposes. Funds for the purpose will be sought from the Centre under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 The money got from utilising the slum land for commercial purposes will also be spent on erecting the buildings.

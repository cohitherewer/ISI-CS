 Dancing girl

 night in Underground. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 

 What: 

 Payal Rohatgi night. 

 Where: Tantra at The Park.

 When: Saturday.

 The bash: The sikandar babe burnt the dance floor as camera phones kept clicking from every possible angle from the minute she stepped onto the bartop. When Payal, looking sexy in a cleavage-revealing red-and-green lehnga choli, rocked to the rhythm of sikandar, Beedi jalaile and Kajra re, the crowds cheered long and lusty. 

 Bond fever

 What: Casino Royale night.

 Where: Underground at HHI.

 When: Saturday night.

 The bash: Truly shaken and stirred! In keeping with the theme, the nightclub was all decked up in Bond posters. DJ Anshul at the console churned out 007 tracks, film clippings were screened and couple passes for Casino Royale were doled out.

 Money matters mantra 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 To avoid money being drained away, one should stimulate the south-east corner of the house with blue and green objects. These should be made to sparkle with a light from above. An effective measure is to place a box filled with coins here. The box should be placed either on a mirror base or the coins should be reflected in a mirror placed inside the lid of the box

Q: Nothing seems to be going fine with my career. I was born on 07.01.1979 at 10 am. I have completed my MBA in 2004, but have not got a single good job till now. My bedroom is in the north. Please advise.

 Soma Bhattacharya

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak wood person born in late winter. Your chart is loaded with wealth elements and you will come across plenty of wealth when you enter into the favourable period of metal element. This period starts from 2010 and will continue for the next 20 years. This will transform your life altogether for the better.

 Strengthen yourself with lots of green and blue shades in your surroundings. For your career to improve, place some art with a focus on your future on the northern wall. You could also hang a pendulum clock here. Also place your resume in a blue folder with a note of affirmation that you have got a decent job in a good company. 

 To avoid money being drained away, stimulate the south-east corner of the house or your room with blue and green objects. Make them sparkle with a light from the top. Place a small circular metal box or a rectangular wooden box filled with nine coins or its multiples here. Either place them on a mirror base or make the coins reflect in the mirror, which is placed on the inside of the upper lid.

 Luck lustre 

 Q: My date of birth is March 30, 1985. I want to know my animal sign, lucky number, element, lucky colours and auspicious directions. I also want to know about my career prospects. Please suggest measures that will bring me some love luck as well.

 Sandipta Roy

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are an earth person. Your animal sign is Ox, kua number is 9 and auspicious directions are east, south-east, north and south. 

 You should do well in computer engineering or any other field connected with metal. Its not yet time for Cupid to start its play on you, so you should concentrate on your career now. 

 Animal effect 

 Q: I want to know which animal sign I belong to according to the Chinese calendar. Please suggest how I can know it.

 Rajib Dasgupta

 THE SOLUTION: The Chinese New Year does not begin on January 1 like the western calendar, but on a date that corresponds with the second new moon after the winter equinox. Hence it varies from year to year. 

 If you are born in the months of January or February then you will have to refer to the Chinese lunar calendar, otherwise a simple way of finding out your animal sign is by referring to the table given below. 

 To start with, the first animal sign which is the Rat is associated with the year 1948 and is followed by Ox ? 1949, Tiger ? 1950, Rabbit ? 1951, Dragon ? 1952, Snake ? 1953, Horse ? 1954, Ram ? 1955, Monkey ? 1956, Rooster ? 1957, Dog ? 1958 and Pig ? 1959. In total there are 12 animal signs associated with 12 months of the year. 

 So to find out your personal animal sign, add 12 to the year of each animal sign and find out where your animal sign falls. 

 Health woes

 Q: I am a young girl studying in college. For the last two years I have been suffering from different kinds of health problems. My parents are giving me the best of medication, but my health is not improving. This has left me with lot of negativity as I feel I will never regain normal health. I feel I am surrounded with negativity in my immediate environment. There is a tiny window in the east of my room, which I rarely open. Please suggest remedies.

 Rewati Das

 THE SOLUTION: To enjoy good physical and mental health, your room should be purified with early sunrays. Not allowing sunrays to flow into the room is also symbolic of limiting your future prospects and opportunities. 

 We have all observed how fresh plants bend towards the east to tap sunlight for photosynthesis. To create a positive environment, open the window, place a fresh plant with flowers and hang a pair of well-cut round crystals here. Worship the rising sun with folded hands, ask for blessings and feel the sunrays being absorbed in your body. All these enhancements will help in the absorption of heavenly Chi energy into your body and your room, which will bring good luck and support your health as well. 

 Every month on the full moon night, place water here to be charged by the rays of the moon. Spray this around the room in a clockwise manner to remove the negative ions. Also burn aromatic oils or incense sticks to raise the energy level.

 Drug for lifestyle ailments 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 City doctors grappling with a litany of lifestyle diseases like heart attacks, strokes, osteoporosis, Alzheimer?s disease and cancer, are increasingly seeking solace in a ?wonder drug? with wide-ranging risk-reduction benefits.

 The lipid-lowering effect of the ?statins? family of drugs is well documented. A growing body of research is now revealing a number of unexpected health-enhancing and potentially life-extending qualities, and the medical fraternity of Calcutta is fast embracing its ?impressive? clinical success.

 ?It?s a breakthrough medicine in treating vascular diseases, and helps immensely in long-term reduction in the risk of stroke. Along with blood thinners, good control of blood pressure and blood sugar, statins as a group is the fourth pillar in stroke prevention and therapy,? says Amitabha Ghosh, department head, neurology, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. 

 Statins inhibit cholesterol absorption throughout the intestine by reducing cholesterol?s solubility. They increase excretion of fat and cholesterol from the body, which directly lowers the bad (LDL) cholesterol levels. They also reduce the body?s natural cholesterol synthesis from the liver and peripheral tissues (such as the adrenal glands), lowering overall cholesterol concentrations.

 ?Given the high degree of urban stress, our practice is peppered with patients presenting either with a progressive lifestyle disorder, or the potential to have one soon. So we have to work our way down risk factors,? observes Kunal Sarkar, consultant cardiac surgeon, Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences.

 Sarkar says statins have been ?hugely instrumental? in treating and managing cardiac conditions and there?s ?clear evidence? they lower risks of myocardial infarction (heart attack). ?Not just the preventive aspect, because they can help manage plaque deposition better, patients who have undergone angioplasty often have better long-term results with statins,? he adds.

 In the October 2000 issue of the of Neurology, a multi-centre team of researchers reported that the risk of developing Alzheimer?s disease ? a chronic and progressive degenerative neurological condition ? was reduced by up to 73 per cent in older patients being treated with statins.

 ?This is most definitely corroborated by indications in our routine practice. There?s clearly a vascular factor in Alzheimer?s, and now that the understanding of the benefits of the statins family is better, we are reaping the rewards,? confirms neuro-physician Ghosh.

 Statins have also been found to be beneficial in the treatment of osteoporosis. Following the discovery that statins promote new bone growth, researchers found men and women taking statins had a ?substantially lower risk? of fractures and higher bone densities than those who were not taking statins.

 A potentially beneficial role in cancer therapy is also seen. Reduced number of deaths from cancer occurred among patients involved in several large trials of statins for prevention of cardiovascular events.

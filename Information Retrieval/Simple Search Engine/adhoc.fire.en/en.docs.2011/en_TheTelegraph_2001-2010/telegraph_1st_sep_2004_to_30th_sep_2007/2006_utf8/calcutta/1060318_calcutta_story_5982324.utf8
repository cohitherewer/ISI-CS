 Eyes on him: Jay Sean 

 signing autographs

 It was a cricket match of a different kind with filmstars and signers slipping into flannels, but by the end of the day, the IIFA Cup, held at the Brabourne stadium on Thursday, was the celebration of a noble cause ? that of the behind-the-scenes workers of Bollywood.

 In cricket battle gear for IIFA XI were film stars like Suniel Shetty, Arbaaz Khan, Madhavan, Venkatesh, Riteish, Aftab Shivdasani, Rahul Dev and former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin.

 Their opponents ? the Sports Relief XI team from UK coached by West Indian legend Alvin Kallicharan ? comprised Jay Sean, Jake Humphrey, Mark Chapman, and former English cricketers Phil Tufnell and Jack Russell.

 Batting first, IIFA XI scored a total of 229 runs, with Azharuddin top scoring with 64. The Sports Relief team could only manage 166. Phil Tufnell with three wickets was the bowler of the match while Riteish was adjudged the best batsman with his trailblazing 48 off 36 balls. 

 Current England captain Andrew Flintoff made a brief guest appearance to cheer the two teams and show support to the IIFA Foundation. Also present for the glam factor were actresses Katrina Kaif and Amrita Arora.

 You can catch the match and the rest of the off-field action on the April 8 simulcast on STAR Plus, STAR One and STAR Utsav at 5 pm.

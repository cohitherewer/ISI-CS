 Dome of dazzle with glitter gamut

 Trendy to bridal, junk to ornamental, Navratan or designer jewellery, a gleaming gold pendant or a single-line solitaire diamond necklace ? all under one roof. Calcuttas first dedicated jewellery mall, Fort Knox, The Ornamint, is all set to open its doors in the first week of February.

 The nine-storeyed dome of dazzle offers 80,000 sq ft of built space for gems and jewellery retailers to showcase their shine. 

 We have signed a deal with Tanishq, which will be the anchor store, taking up 4,000 sq ft on the ground level with a 60-ft frontage. They will come in with an array of new designs besides their routine range of gold, diamond and bridal jewellery, Ashok Bengani, president of Fort Knox tells GoodLife.

 The first five floors are designed for jewellery showrooms and the next three are customised for jewellers offices. The eighth floor houses the entertainment section with Italian vegetarian fare at Little Italy and Venom, the lounge bar with its disc, ice bar and separate VIP lounge.

 The unique experience begins and the glitter goals are set at the entrance itself, with the walk-in lobby paved with semi-precious stones.

 The first level is dedicated to diamonds. Kiah from Mumbai, the leading name in polished diamonds, making its maiden foray into Calcutta, has taken up 2,000 sq ft. Adora, another diamond brand from Mumbai, with a presence in London and Dubai, and Lata Mangeshkar as brand ambassador, will launch its first dedicated city showroom.

 Sygnus, another Mumbai merchant dealing in diamonds, is opening a 1,000-sq-ft showroom, while Orra is shifting its retail racks from Chowringhee to the Camac Street mall. R.C. Parekh, a top local jeweller, which is coming up with its own mall on Theatre Road, has also taken up space on the first level of Fort Knox. B. Motiram, specialising in Sindhi jewellery, is coming to Camac Street from New Market.

 Level 2 will have Exclusive Lines with its designer watches, Kunal Gems, which also has a presence on Theatre Road, besides Epari Sridhar from Bhubaneswar. 

 Leading international brand D. Damas, with its diamond and gold range, will have a franchisee presence in the mall. N.P. Jewellers (gold) and Anuradha Jhunjhunwala (silverware) complete the line-up on this level.

 The third floor will house Sawan Sukha (specialists in bridal and trendy jewellery), also famous for its kundan ornaments from Bikaner, besides Komal, a leading brand from Bangalore, which is a regular supplier to Tanishq. Gouti Sons from Mumbai, official suppliers of gold jewellery to the Tirupati temple, is also setting up shop in the mall located opposite the British Council.

 Colour stone jewellery using emerald, ruby, sapphire and pearl are very popular these days, and we will have a rich range of this stuff, promises Bengani. The mall will have a designers gallery, too, allowing young and established designers to showcase their creations. The management is even planning an institute for gems and jewellery designing and training on the colour gradation of diamonds.

 The price parameters for diamonds lie in the four Cs ? colour, clarity, cut and carat ? and its important for retailers and consumers to be aware of these determinants, stresses Bengani, who feels that with diamond gaining in popularity, it will soon become a security asset in this country, much like gold.

 Bengani believes the mall would serve not just Calcutta, but neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Nepal as well. 

 For that matter, you will struggle to find a mangalsutra even at Tiffanys in Singapore, he smiles.

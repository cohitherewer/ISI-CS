 Add-ons for the bar

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 A bar cabinet, though swank, may be a threat to space in a modern flat. But there is hardly an alternative. Glasses could be stacked away in the crockery cabinet, but certainly not your collection of wines and liquors or even the bar accessories.

 The bottle holders and bar accessory sets at Giggles on Park Street could solve the dilemma. Not only do these save space but make for nice home decor, too. A reason they are popular picks as gifts as well as for personal use, says a store spokesperson. 

 The bottle holders, made of polystone, capture chefs and sailors in light-hearted moments. The figurines in various postures have one thing in common ? men holding on to their bottles possessively. 

 The chefs are mostly in blue trousers and black coats. A middle-aged cook seems to be just out from a busy day in the kitchen and is more than eager to put his arms around the bottle and hug him like a friend.

 The chef with his cap on and a big brown moustache right for his chubby bright face tilts on his right, as if the bottle is too heavy to hold. His pockets are bursting with spoons and forks. The lazy sailor lying on his back and winking is in no mood to steer the wheel.

 Another bottle holder looks like a golf cabinet with a wooden finish. It can hold three bottles, each to be slid in from the side. The front has a green base showcasing various golf accessories like the golf stick, ball and even old stamps related to the game.

 Bar accessories come in holders that look like small golf bags or leather boots. A brown leather boot with its front-edge in black polystone accommodates a matte-finish metal bottle opener, a cork-screw, a peg measure, an ice pick and three stirrers. 

 The one in a chocolate brown golf bag includes tools with the tips resembling golfing accessories. So while the cork-screw has a golf ball like tip, the stirrers and the peg measure have golf stick tips.

 One can also opt for the set of six tequila shot glasses in a glass holder with a decanter in the middle. Once the decanter and the glasses are out, the holder serves as an ice-bucket.

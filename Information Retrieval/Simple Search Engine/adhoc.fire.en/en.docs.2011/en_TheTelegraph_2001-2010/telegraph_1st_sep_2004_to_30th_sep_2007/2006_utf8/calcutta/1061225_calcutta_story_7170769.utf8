 The alchemy of imagination

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A Raghu Rai photograph on display at the exhibition

 In its bid to highlight the art of photography in India, Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre begins with an exhibition of one of the undisputed masters of black-and-white photography Raghu Rai. Titled Rocks, Clouds and Nudes, it has some truly stunning photographs of clouds and sunsets and boulders on display. 

 There are nudes by the dozen, too, but they are commonplace. The women have the requisite physical assets and thats about all. The photographs lack that spark of imagination, which transforms the most ordinary situations or views into breathtaking stills when clicked at just the right moment. 

 Perfect timing has to overlap with vision. Think Nobuyoshi Araki and the image of the slit eye and you know what I am talking about.

 Rai, too, has captured one such fleeting image on bromide clouds peeping over the hilly road in Sanawar. It is pure magic. But unless one has the ability to recognise a perfect image when one sees one and presses the shutter button at the same time it does not even exist. 

 Then there is the delicate image of the calloused bark of a tree against a bamboo grove in the background, a bamboo grove that is almost as insubstantial as gossamer or a shimmering spiders web catching the light. It is like an impressionist painting in black and white. Equally arresting are the images of the childs hands clasping its fathers huge work-worn, wrinkled thumbs and the tribal child being breastfed. Some of these photographs date back to the 1970s. Are these digital or genuine silver gelatine prints?

 While these images are brilliant, Rai goes one step further when he composes the frames of the men on the beach in Kerala, the men on Marine Drive, the flutist of Varanasi, the desert in Rajasthan after a flash flood and the vast expanse of Pokhran with only the furrows left behind by jeep tyres fanning out like the hood of a cobra. In the Kerala beach photograph, the men are huddled in the right-hand corner of the frame, the cumuluses doing a balancing act over their heads. Over the Ganga and the Arabian Sea, the same insubstantial clouds erupt in the sky like a flaming ocean liner. The drama of cloudscapes is overwhelming.

 Then again, nature is all order and harmony as the camera focuses on farmland. One would have thought that such perfection was only possible in a Ganesh Haloi painting.

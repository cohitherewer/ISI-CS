 Awards for all employees

 - JU institutes annual prize for excellence for teachers, staff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Instead of giving away performance-based prizes to students alone, Jadavpur University will from this year present annual awards to all sections of people involved in its education system ? teachers, non-teaching staff, group-D employees and officers. 

 The prize, comprising Rs 20,000 and a certificate of merit, is mainly aimed at developing a consciousness among all levels of the university system to excel in whichever field they work, university officers say. The decision is part of the year-long celebrations being organised to mark the university?s 50th birth anniversary.

 ?We are perhaps the only institution, not only in Bengal but also in the entire country, to introduce such a system to encourage innovative teaching and service among the university staff,? Parthapratim Biswas, a university executive council member, said. 

 ?We hope this will enable us to improve work culture in the institution,? he added. 

 Since the Centre declared the university a ?centre of excellence? in 2002, the new scheme will open a new avenue for excelling in all spheres of activity. In addition, the system will encourage competitiveness among teachers and employees, the authorities feel.

 The proposal has already been prepared by vice-chancellor Ashoke Nath Basu and he will place it before the meeting of the executive council ? the institution?s highest policy-making body ? for approval between February 10 and 15, university sources said.

 The award will be given to a single teacher of the rank of lecturer from each of the three faculties ? engineering, science and humanities. There will be four prizes in the non-teaching category which will include group-D staff as well. In the officers? category, there will be only one prize.

 The university has plans to start giving the awards from the current year. The prizes will be presented at the time of the institution?s annual convocation. 

 The first batch of awardees will be given the prizes on December 24, on which day the annual convocation of the institution is to be held this year.

 The procedure of making the final selection of a suitable candidate is yet to be finalised, institution sources said. 

 To win the prize, the candidates will have to make some outstanding contribution in their respective fields. ?They must also prove their excellence,? the sources added.

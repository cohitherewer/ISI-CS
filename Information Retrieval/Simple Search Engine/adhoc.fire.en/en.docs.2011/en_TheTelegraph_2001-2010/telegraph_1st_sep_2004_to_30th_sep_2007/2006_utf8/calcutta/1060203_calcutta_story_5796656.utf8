 The sign of deliverance

 - Mini Kanodia?s marriage papers forged, say forensic tests 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For Mini Kanodia, the vindication of her claim of being abducted by a spurned suitor has come in the form of a Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report, submitted to Hastings police on Wednesday. 

 It states that the signature on her marriage certificate with Mohit Srivastav was forged.

 On December 10 last year, five days before her wedding, the 24-year-old was allegedly dragged into a Maruti van by Mohit and whisked away from Vidyasagar Setu. She was riding pillion on her fianc? Vikas Khaitan?s motorcycle, when the ?abductors had blocked their way?. The next morning, police found her having tea with Mohit and two of his friends in a warehouse in Posta.

 The cops claimed that Mini had faked the abduction to run away with Mohit, who stayed in her building in Howrah?s Nitya Dhan Mukherjee Lane. But Mini maintained that she had nothing to do with Mohit. 

 ?We are not taking sides, but the forensic report is a vital document in this case. This is one of the reasons why we decided to get the signature verified by the CFSL. We are going to submit the chargesheet soon. Mohit will now be charged with forgery in addition to abduction,? said a senior police officer. 

 At Bankshal court, Mini had vehemently denied marrying Mohit, a PCO booth-owner in Howrah, even after his lawyers had produced a copy of the marriage certificate. A letter allegedly written by her to the inspector-in-charge of Howrah police station, stating that she wanted to stay with Mohit, was also produced before the court.

 Mohit?s father Hari Om said that Mini was doing a volte-face after calling up his son and asking him to rescue her from the ?clutches of the Khaitans?. 

 Mini stuck to her claim.

 The chief judicial magistrate released her against a personal bond of Rs 500, while Mohit was arrested along with his two friends, Devaki Ranjan Bhojak and Santosh Sharma. They are still in Presidency jail.

 Despite the CFSL verdict, the investigators do not foresee an early resolution to the case. It might, however, mend Mini?s strained relationship with Vikas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scan on unit site policy

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 With a number of polluting units in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) being shut down following public outrage, the state government has been forced to review its industrial siting policy.

 Following a flood of complaints from residential areas where industrial units have come up, we are reviewing the process of issuing clearances, environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee said.

 What apparently steeled the governments resolve to make the norms for granting no-objection certificates (NOCs) tougher was an incident two months ago.

 Chatterjee was scheduled to unveil a waste plastic recycling unit in Bally, Howrah. On the day of inauguration, local residents picketed the gate of the unit, saying they would not allow it to operate. We advised the minister, on his way to Bally, to return, as the situation could have taken an ugly turn, said an official.

 Framed in 2001, the siting policy is riddled with loopholes and has resulted in polluting units mushrooming in human settlements.

 The policy states that units in the red category (both special and ordinary) are banned in the CMA, but are free to come up in panchayat areas. Orange units are banned only in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Howrah Municipal Corporation areas, but are allowed if they are within industrial estates.

 Green units like those producing grille-gates, shutters or steel furniture are allowed everywhere, irrespective of the noise or air pollution they cause.

 Chatterjee said local bodies will be cautioned against rampantly issuing clearances to industrial units. They must understand the ramifications of allowing polluting units in their areas. Job creation should not be the only criterion for granting NOCs.

 In 2000, the environment department had commissioned an abattoir-cum-meat processing plant in Mourigram, Howrah, which was soon served a closure notice by the pollution control board, following a torrent of complaints from local residents.

 After an investment of Rs 150 crore, the plant on 32 acres is operating at a fraction of its capacity, said an official.

 A cast iron pipe unit and a heavy chemical factory have come up in Khardah. The units deal in harmful substances like sulphuric acid and chlorine. The iron dust and mica released by the pipe unit has raised the air pollution in the area alarmingly, said the official.

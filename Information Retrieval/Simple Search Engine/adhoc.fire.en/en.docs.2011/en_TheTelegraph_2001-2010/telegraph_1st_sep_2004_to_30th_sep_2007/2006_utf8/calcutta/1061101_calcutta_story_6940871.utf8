 The 17-km Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, extending from Ultadanga to Garia, will be widened in phases and the new lanes will be laid with concrete or mastic to enhance their longevity.

 The decision was taken at a recent meeting called by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), of which Bhattacharya is chairman, will be the implementing agency.

 A CMDA official said two lanes will be added each to the six-lane stretch between Ultadanga and Parama Island and the four-lane stretch from Parama Island to the Rashbehari connector.

 A lane will be added to the remaining stretch of the artery, comprising three lanes, from the Rashbehari connector to Garia.

 The new lanes from Ultadanga to Parama Island will be laid with concrete and the rest with mastic. The total project, to be funded by the CMDA, would cost around Rs 8 crore.

 The project will be executed in phases. Work is likely to start in November and the agencies to be hired will be given a three-month deadline, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar. 

 Any cost over-run because of delays will have to be borne by the agencies.

 Elaborating on the decision to concretise the new lanes between Ultadanga and Parama Island, an official said the stretch is used by VIPs and foreign guests on their way to Writers Buildings from the airport. 

 Baviskar also said the CMDA has received the technical report on the proposed extension of the Bypass by 11.5 km, from Garia to Baruipur. Stressing the need for the extension, he said Baruipur is fast gaining in importance, as the government has decided to shift the district headquarters of South 24-Parganas there from Alipore.

 The road connecting Prince Anwar Shah Road and EM Bypass, which has hit a hurdle over the issue of shifting a church, will be ready by December, Baviskar added.

Time: 2 pm.

 Place: Opposite Webel Bhavan, in Sector V.

 Scene: The makeshift food stalls wear a deserted look The roads are empty and no signs of activity at the otherwise busy IT hub in Salt Lake. 

 Rains did to Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec) what strikes failed to do bring down attendance. 

 And the empty food stalls along the roads on Friday afternoon told the tale of natures impact on the 24x7 outfits. 

 Public transport was non-existent and those who ventured out on their own faced problems. Attendance at our office is poor, around 60 per cent, said Chandrani Banerjee, manager-HR, Last Peak Group, a call centre.

 Poor turnout was the order of the day at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees showpiece tech town, where attendance crashed to around 65 per cent.

 At Tata Consultancy Services, known for its 90-plus per cent attendance even on bandh days, only 70 per cent employees turned up to log into their workstations.

 The non-stop showers have really spoilt the day for us. People came either in cabs or in their own vehicles. It poured through the day and now the worry is how to go back home, said a TCS official.

 Other biggies in Saltlec, like CTS, IBM and Skytech Solutions, also recorded below-normal attendance.

 But there was no major waterlogging this time at Sector V. In July, the tech town was marooned after a days downpour.

 Four pumps have been operating since midnight and draining out water. But if it continues to pour like this, we dont know what will happen, said a CMDA official.

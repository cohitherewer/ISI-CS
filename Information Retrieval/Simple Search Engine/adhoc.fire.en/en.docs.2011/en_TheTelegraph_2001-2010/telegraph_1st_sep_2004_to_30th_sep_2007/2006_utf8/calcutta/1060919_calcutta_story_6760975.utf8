The brew just got better

The guitar remains. The orange signature stays. The 

aroma lingers, and gets a tad better. On that note, step into Barista Creme 

Barista in a new, upgraded format.

Housed at 4/1 Camac Street, Barista Creme, unlike 

its chain of espresso bars, is lounge-like mood lighting, burgundy walls and 

an adjoining terrace seating. Barista Creme, with its ambience and extended food 

menu, says Partha Duttagupta, CEO, is the logical extension of an Italian 

heritage.

With the Saturday launch of Barista Creme adjacent 

to Exclusive Lines, the total Barista count in the city touched seven. October 

is slated to see four more Barista outlets opening up.

Calcutta is home to the countrys fifth 

Barista Creme outlet (there are two in Delhi, one each in Gurgaon and Hyderabad) 

and it incorporates the best of the other four. This format is final and all other 

Cremes will be modelled on the Camac Street version, said Partha.

Traditionally, Barista is known best for three 

things great coffee, a nice place to get together, and warm, friendly service. 

Barista Creme takes each of these experiences a step further, he added.

Result? Greater range of coffee with introduction 

of dessert-beverages, comfortable couches for lounge-style seating and personal 

table service. Improvisation apart, Barista Creme also boasts a series of firsts: 

A sandwich deli, fresh salad deli and pasta section. 

Green Onion and Peas Soup, Country Style Arabiata, 

Jalapeno Muncher Cheese Melts, Chicken Salami Pizza, Chunky Chicken Lasagne, Dieters 

Crunch Salad, Fishy Tuna Mayo Catch all of this and more on this Barista table.

But the focus on food is not intended to steal the 

limelight from the brown beans. Food component in the espresso bars comprise 

30-32 per cent of the bill value. In Creme, it climbs up to 40-45 per cent 

but each of these bills includes at least two beverages. So coffee is not going 

anywhere else, said Partha. 

Evidently not, because coffee took centre-stage in 

ways more than one at the Barista Creme launch party co-hosted by fashion designer 

Shantanu Goenka on Saturday evening. As the amazing aroma floated through the 

air and teased the tastebuds, a photography exhibition provided more than food 

and drink for thought with DJ Girishs lounge and beach-house beats setting 

the right pace.

Cameras of three young photographers Anushka Nadia 

Menon, Tarun Vishwa and Kunal Verma captured the essence of coffee in their 

own signature styles. Anushka, who was present at the launch, said: I wanted 

to showcase Barista Creme as a luxury brand by touching the borders of reality 

and fantasy. All my images are about people indulging in the pleasure of coffee 

drinking. 

The party saw great coffee, conversation and an impressive 

crowd turnout.

Seen at the first day, first show were Moon Moon Sen, 

June, Anamika Khanna, Sangita Kejriwal, Rahul and Kamna Saraf, Abhishek Dutta, 

Pooja Goenka, Varda Goenka and Sanjukta.

The verdict: We are coming back.

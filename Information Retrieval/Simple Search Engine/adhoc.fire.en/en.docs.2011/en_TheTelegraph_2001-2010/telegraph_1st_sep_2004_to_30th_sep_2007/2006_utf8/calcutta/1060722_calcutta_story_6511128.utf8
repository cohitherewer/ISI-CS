 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

 have an independent streak, often breaking clear of your 

 family at an early age. Always active, pleasant, but a bit 

 moody, you can also be critical and contradictory. You are 

 a competent worker who isn?t afraid to jump in when the 

 going gets rough. You risk getting exploited by your employers. 

 Learn to indulge yourself with some luxuries.

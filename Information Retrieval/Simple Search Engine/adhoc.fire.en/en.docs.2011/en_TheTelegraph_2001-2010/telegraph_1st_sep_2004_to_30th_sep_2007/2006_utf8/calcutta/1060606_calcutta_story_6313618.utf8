 In a world where gardening space is becoming increasingly constricted and people are opting for hassle-free artificial plants, customisation and variety are the only options before the enthusiast, was the advice of experts from Suttons on Environment Day.

 There were few takers at the free seed and seedling distribution counter set up by the company, a branch of the 94-years-old Suttons England, at Allen?s Park on Monday.

 However, Subrata Saha, assistant manager (sales) of Suttons, claimed: ?In the past 10 years, we have recorded 100 per cent increase in sales.?

 According to him, even people living in tiny flats are craving for greenery and there is an increased demand for potted plants, indoor varieties and dwarf versions of trees.

 Some who visited the counter, like Manisha Mukherjee, opted for a terrace garden, with guidance and tools from Suttons. People with new houses wanted to know what plants would look good on their premises. 

 Suttons once used to sell only packets of 100-200 seeds. ?That was when almost everyone had the opportunity to grow several types of plants. Clients today have to make do with a maximum of 25-30 pots. So we provide mixed seedlings,? added Saha.

 Company horticulturists like Amrit Ghosh counselled customers on the right shade of bougainvillaea creepers or the perfect hedge for the garden. 

 For the summer, it is best to choose plants like gaillardia, which flower in five-six months with little tending, over zinnias, opined the Suttons experts.

 Plants that have fine leaf structure and look good even when not in bloom, for example Cassia Biflora and gardenia, are the best for small houses, offered Ghosh.

 Nikhil Mukherjee, who has been a client of Suttons for 40 years, cherishes his lawn of Wimbledon grass and the dahlias, chrysanthemums, roses and orchids he bought from the store.

 Another customer, Kajli Srimal, could not understand why people go for artificial plants when real alternatives provide oxygen. 

 ?Artificial plants need dusting and they don?t grow or bloom, and hence, do not satisfy gardeners,? chipped in Mukherjee.

 The Russell Street store of Suttons has an extensive collection of gardening tools, fertilisers and accessories. The company regularly conducts campaigns and seedling distribution camps at schools and colleges of the city.

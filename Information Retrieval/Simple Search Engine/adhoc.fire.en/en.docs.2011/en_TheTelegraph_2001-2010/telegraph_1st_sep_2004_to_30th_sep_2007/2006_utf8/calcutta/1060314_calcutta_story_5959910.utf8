The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Fashion week call for fair lady

She has been walking the city ramp for close to a 

decade now and she recently even announced her plans of no more modelling. 

But the limelight, it seems, is not willing to let Amrita Sengupta (in picture 

left by Pabitra Das) go, just yet.

 Just when she was packing up, this 25-year-old model has been chosen to walk the ramp at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) in Mumbai later this month.

 Yet to recover from the breaking news, Amrita recalls how she landed herself this golden chance. It all happened very suddenly. I was shooting for The Telegraph with designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee when he told me to try out for the LFW. I contacted the person concerned and before I knew it, I was confirmed in three days!

 So, what clinched it for her? Well, I think they liked my profile and also the fact that I had worked with a few Mumbai-based choreographers, feels Amrita.

 She has, in fact, done three shows with model-turned-choreographer Marc Robinson and also a couple of stints with Aparna Tania.

 I think they must have checked with Marc and the next thing I know is that I am on board, she smiles. 

 Though the final designer list is not known to Amrita yet, what she does know is that she will be walking the ramp for Sabyasachi. I dont know the other names yet but if theres one Indian designer whose ensembles Im dying to showcase, it is Wendell Rodricks... His fashion sensibilities are simply stunning.

 Been there, done that and more. For a model who has done everything she could for her career, this Fashion Week is something Amrita is doing just for her own happiness and satisfaction.

 So, this leggy beauty pursuing a human resource management course, treats this unexpected opportunity as nothing short of a bonus. 

 Amrita, who returned from Mumbai after a short stint a couple of years ago, leaves again on March 25 for fittings and trials and is expected back in Calcutta on April 2.

 And whats next? I wasnt really thinking about this, but if they offer me next years show, great, otherwise Im happy near home sweet home, signs off this south Calcutta girl.

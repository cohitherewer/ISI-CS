Life

 Sound of a siren

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 In town last weekend, Tanushree said: Right from my newcomer days till date, I have not stagnated one bit. The roles in all my films, be it Aashiq Banaya Apne or Chocolate, have been different. I have moved on. In my forthcoming projects, too, I have made a conscious decision not to repeat myself.

 GoodLife got up close and personal with the Jamshedpur girl, chilling out on Sunday afternoon at Hushh, the new Italian restaurant in City Centre (picture above by Bishwarup Dutta).

 Sex symbol: The tag rests easy on her shapely shoulders. I take it as a compliment. In our industry, the glam quotient ought to be high lucky ones have it and some cannot get enough of it! Be it the skimpiest of clothes or a sari, one can manage to look sexy with the right kind of attitude and comfort level, reveals the leggy lass.

 Sensuous me: I am not sure, people say my sex appeal lies in the eyes, she says, all smiles.

 Winning line: Its all about inner beauty and confidence. Confidence fluctuates from time to time and I am no different. But then the basic amount of self conviction carries you through, is the picture perfect Miss India reply.

 Item girl: The Signal girl, playing a cameo in Priyadarshans Bhagam Bhag, refuses to be restricted to item numbers. I am an actress first and foremost. Once in a while I am open to item numbers, provided the song is unique in its own way. Signal is a comedy track and I had fun doing it. Moreover, it fetched me more than I asked for Priyan Sir signed me for his next film, gushes Tanushree.

 Style talk: Style is all about comfort, confidence and how one carries oneself. On that count, the lady is all praise for sexy siren Malaika Arora Khan. Malaika is quite a style icon. Even after childbirth she manages to look so good!

 Sizzling in a pair of brown trousers and top jazzed up with an embellished belt, Tanushree adds: For formal occasions, I prefer saris. Otherwise, I love wearing jeans and tees. 

 Prized possession: The values and sincerity that I have inherited from my family, says Tanushree in all seriousness. Once a Miss India, always a Miss India!

 Controversy call: As a film star, controversies are a part and parcel of our job. Controversies have followed me right from the beginning. I am a low-profile person and do nothing but keep quiet.

 Look at him: No one but the Big B tops Tanushrees list of hot males. She is quick to add: Abhishek Bachchan is cute, too. Internationally, it would definitely have to be Tom Cruise. He is the universal favourite with girls across continents.

 Femme fatale: Rani Mukherjee and Jennifer Lopez win maximum votes from this sultry stunner. Rani might not have a perfect figure, but that is not the sole requirement for being sexy. Jennifer Lopez has it in her too.

 A fun zone where you come first

 Once considered a sleepy pocket on the outskirts of the city, Chak Garia off the EM Bypass is now busy and bustling, with car count and footfall constantly on the rise.

 First, Hiland Park put Chak Garia on the city map as the tallest residential tower. Then came The Metropolis mall with its shop stops and food court, followed by Fame (Hiland Park), the four-screen multiplex.

 And now, on Poila Baisakh, comes a 3,500 sq ft chill-out destination at The Metropolis mall that cannot be termed a pub or a lounge or a resto bar ? it is a fusion of all this and more.

 This fun zone on the second floor is an extension of Yo Foodies, the popular food court, and is called I.

 Scheduled to open on April 15, this Rs 25-lakh offering took close to six months to complete.

 The concept of I was with us right from the time Yo Foodies opened a year ago. Acquiring the licence was definitely an issue but more than anything else we wanted to gain an insight into all the aspects of this industry before taking the plunge, says one of the four business partner, Vishal Kapur.

 The whole belt has nothing like this and the distance from other parts of the city should be an added advantage. It should be an ideal haunt for people to unwind, away from the hustle and bustle, smiles Kapur.

 But why call it I? Be it shaking a leg, savouring a drink or having dinner with the family, this should be home away from home where you can be yourself. Hence the name I, explains Kapur.

 Once you enter, the floor in dark ash and patches of red and ceiling bulbs with a blue glow catch your eye. To the right is the restaurant area that can accommodate 40 people. Seaters in silver and black along with sleek squarish tables create a fine dining ambience.

 Sections of the wall inscribed with I in various languages provide some interesting food for thought.

 Table mats inscribed with similar illustrations help sort out which I belongs to which language and also tell you how to pronounce it.

 While the food court caters to a lot of impulse eating during shopping or after catching a movie, this section should be for serious eaters, points out Kapur.

 The menu offers an array of Oriental and Amritsari delicacies. The live My Noodles counter allows you to enjoy your own signature dish by choosing from four kinds of noodles, 11 sauces and 32 vegetarian and non-vegetarian toppings. After 10.30 pm, finger food and snack platters will take over.

 There is more to the 40-ft bar counter than drinks, cocktails and mocktails. A part of the wall overlooking the counter gives you the history of whisky and how it was called Uisge Beatha (water of life) by the ancient Celts/Celtics.

 From folklore to globalisation to Robert Burns (Freedom and whisky gang together), there are passages that talk about everything related to the drink. The write-ups will change every one-and-a-half months, adds Kapur.

 The bar counter is home to a wide variety of glasses big and small. Each drink will be served the way it should. After all, a proper glass adds to the authenticity, feels Kapur. 

 The beverage section helmed by bar guru Irfan Ahmed offers a six-page menu with more than 100 cocktails and mocktails, and a wide variety of Ten shots on offer. I Squeeze, Kamikazi, Blue-berry Blush... The cocktails and mocktails have eye-catching names, too.

 To your left is the pub area with ample space to laze about, sink into low soft couches or sit on squarish seaters. The background is in colourful leather patches.

 Next to it is the My Music wall where musical instruments from all over the world shall find pride of place. A resident DJ shall keep some guests going on the dance floor. Karaoke, Live Band, Heavy Metal Nights and more have been lined up on the music front.

 The music can be controlled to keep it lower at the restaurant area, says Kapur.

 A sergeant stops a speeding car and slaps a fine on the driver. He pays by swiping his credit card and the cop generates a receipt using the printer built into his palmtop. 

 Welcome to policing of the future. It could soon be a reality, thanks to a decision by the ministry of home affairs to develop a policing model for seven cities ? the four metros and Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore ? using the latest technology and with the help of better man-management.

 The plan, named The Megacity Project, aims to explore ways of upgrading policing in the cities in the next five years using central funds. 

 The first meeting in this regard took place in the Capital in mid-November and was attended by the chief secretary, home secretary and the director-general of police of Bengal, and the city police commissioner. Following subsequent meetings in New Delhi, the city police have submitted a detailed document specifying ways to recast the force in accordance with the demands of the future. 

 The Rs 550-crore plan stresses on communication, arms and intelligence, and looks to bring about an overall improvement through small reforms.

 The police brass proposes to acquire two OB vans ? the kind used by news channels to cover events live ? to monitor major incidents closely. The feed will be transmitted via satellite to the control room in Lalbazar. 

 ?Once we have the vans, we will be better equipped to instruct officers handling a crisis on the spot. We can even track the build-up of law and order problems. Just small changes in the way we function can work wonders,? said Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner of police (administration). 

 Other proposals include use of Global Positioning System in police vehicles. According to police officers, this will help crack abduction cases and other crimes.

 Growing Internet crimes have necessitated the set-up of a cyber lab at Lalbazar. The police are also likely to benefit if their computers are networked.

 The VSNL authorities have expressed willingness to collaborate with the cops in the upgrade of the computer infrastructure. Webel has already been asked to develop a networking blueprint and create software for catering to the demands of the force. 

 The cops have also called for: 

 4Mobile investigation labs, with equipment for forensic tests 

 4Round-the-clock surveillance of important parts of the city 

 4Building up of a dedicated network to collect intelligence 

 4Faster vehicles for officers.

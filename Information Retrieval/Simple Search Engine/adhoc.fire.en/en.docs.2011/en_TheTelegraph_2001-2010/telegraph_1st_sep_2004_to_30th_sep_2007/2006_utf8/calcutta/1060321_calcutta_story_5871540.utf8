 What: The 

 Devils Advocate: A Night of Decadence with DJ A-Myth.

 Where: Tantra at The Park.

 When: Saturday night.

 The table-turner: DJ A-Myth has to his credit hit remixes like Koi roko na, Chalte chalte, Baar baar dekho and Naache naache.

 The bash: If anything, the presence of the DJ from Mumbai promised a rocking night at Tantra. The young and the not-so-young trooped in, in full force to dance the night away.

 Up first was Rang barse, bidding farewell to Holi. Then there was Aadat, Salaam namaste, Right here right now and Say na say na. Every DJ has to play the handful of songs that are topping the charts. But playing the right remix at the right time is most important, said a reveller.

 Voiceover: Every DJ has his preferred genre of music but it is important to gauge what the crowd wants before anything else. Nightclub audiences today are very discerning. The immense amount of musical exposure in India has put them on a par with the international music circuit. And with the addition of the Bollywood music industry, it is a veritable haven for music lovers with tastes ranging from jazz and blues to Kajra re and Dus bahane, smiled DJ A-Myth.

 Rang revelry

 What: Post-Holi bash with DJ Ryan Barretto and DJ Akash.

 Where: Fusion, the resto-bar at The Golden Park.

 When: Saturday night.

 The bash: Party people who trooped in were greeted with a glass of thandai.

 The colour of Holi was all too evident at the console, which churned out songs like Rang barse, Lets play Holi, Khaike paan Banaraswala and Jai jai shiv shankar.

 Voiceover: Seeing the way people are enjoying themselves here it seems they have not had enough of a Holi high, said DJ Ryan Barretto.

 Auction action

 What: The horse auction.

 Where: Royal Calcutta Turf Club.

 When: Saturday night.

 The show: The horse auction was punctuated by a fashion show where models displayed various kinds of jewellery. 

 Sip n bite: 

 Various types of salads, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Fish Tandoori, 

 Butter Naan and Black Forest Rasmalai were some of the items 

 on the menu.

 Voiceover: The evening was a perfect blend of the beauty and the beast! If the horses were magnificent, the models did a good job on the ramp, smiled a member of the audience.

 Beer blast

 What: Fosters Beer and Barbecue bash to mark the beginning of the Grand Prix season. 

 Where: Calcutta Swimming Club.

 When: Sunday afternoon.

 The bash: Members and their guests turned up in hordes to enjoy the live screening of the Malaysian Grand Prix in the dining hall of the club, over bottles of beer and light snacks, and amidst much cheering.

 For those who were more interested in catching up with friends on a Sunday afternoon, the poolside was the preferred site, as they washed down chips, fish finger and a variety of other snacks with chilled beer.

 Sunday also marked the opening of the pool for the season and children were seen making a splash in the blue waters.

 Voiceover: The three Fs ? fun, frolic and Formula One ? sum up the afternoon. Fosters is now the official sponsor of Formula One and this is our way of ensuring that people of this city get to enjoy the sport in their own way, said Sukanta Banerjee, regional business manager, Fosters India Ltd.

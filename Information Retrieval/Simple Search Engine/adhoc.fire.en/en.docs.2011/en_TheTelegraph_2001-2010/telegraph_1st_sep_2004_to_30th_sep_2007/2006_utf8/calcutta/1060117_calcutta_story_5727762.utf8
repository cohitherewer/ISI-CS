 It was a two-day exhibition of artwork by underprivileged children. But the adult brigade turned up in full force to support their efforts. 

 Meera Bhattacharjee, social worker and wife of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, inaugurated the display on Saturday morning, at Bharatiyam, in Salt Lake. 

 Organised by NGO Prayasam, the exhibition comprised the works of kids from around 40 schools in North 24-Parganas under the National Child Labour Project (NCLP).

 Labour minister Md Amin, district magistrate Manoj Panth, principal secretary of labour Ashok M. Chakrabarti, Unicef child protection officer Francesco Dovidio, NCLP project director Nilanjan Shandilyo and dancer Madhubani Chatterjee were some of the eminent personalities who turned up to admire the youngsters? works.

 The varied art, crafts and handicrafts at the event were the result of a three-month workshop, Crayons? Cry, with the children by Prayasam volunteers to bring a little colour and creativity into their lives. 

 Some of the students from Kamarhati Child Labour Welfare School also attended the exhibition, where ?Meeradi? taught them to fly kites.

 On January 28, the artwork will be displayed at a district exhibition in Barasat, where children from the 40 schools will be taken to view each other?s products.

 The Prayasam volunteers are hopeful that Crayons? Cry will become an annual affair, with the exhibition drawing even bigger crowds at future events. ?In fact, some people even wanted to buy items. And to think a lot of these kids had never dabbled in art before!? said a Prayasam spokesperson.

 Teaching kids to care

PET PASSION

 A child who learns to care for an animal and treat it kindly learns to treat people the same way. Most of us are aware of the health benefits that come with having a pet, including lowering high blood pressure, preventing heart diseases and combating depression. But most importantly, a pet teaches children some of the most invaluable lessons of life.

 Taking care of a pet on a daily basis is a child?s first introduction to thinking about the needs of others, or even to realising that others have needs. But it?s unrealistic to expect a kid to be solely responsible for a pet. Teaching a dog the rules of the house and helping him become a good companion is too overwhelming a task for a child. If you?re adopting a pet for the kids you must be prepared and willing to be its primary caretaker.

 Positive relationships with pets can help in the development of a child?s relationship with others and can contribute to a child?s self-esteem and self-confidence.

 Pets are also receptacles of secrets and private thoughts ? kids often talk to them in strictest confidence.

 Walking the dog or feeding a cat can serve as a fun study break for kids, and a replacement for TV and video games. They are likely to stay more focused on the chores at hand and completing homework. Pets can teach respect for other living beings and provide a link with nature. Other needs fulfilled by pet ownership include physical activity, comfort, loyalty and affection.

 Some kids may be rough or even abusive to pets. So, it?s best to monitor their interaction. Kids should be reminded that the pet is an important family member, not a ?toy? to be neglected and tossed around.

 Also, there?s a tendency, in our society, to think of all pets as disposable. When a child?s enthusiasm for a new pet wanes, care for the animal sometimes suffers. You can help strengthen the relationship between your pet and child by showing respect for your pet?s needs and feelings. No pet should be discarded because the ?newness? wears off, and the sooner your child learns this the better it is for him.

 The City Diary

 Water supply to some areas served by the Tallah-Palta network is yet to return to normal 48 hours after the repair of leaks in the big-diameter water mains under BT Road. Residents of Palm Avenue, Beleghata, Burrabazar and Dhakuria complained about low pressure of water on Sunday. Engineers in the civic water supply department said the low pressure was due to the presence of air bubbles in the underground pipeline.

 Tension mounted at Jetia, in Barrackpores Halisahar, on the citys northern fringes, after residents spotted the leg of a baby sticking out of the ground. They called in policemen, who exhumed the body and sent it for post-mortem. Investigation revealed that the body was that of a newborn girl.

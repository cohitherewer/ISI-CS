The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 This weekend you can hit the... 

Dhaba trail

 If pandal-hopping is not your cup of tea and its too late now to head out of the city, drive down to the dhabas on the outskirts to add flavour to the festivities. Here are four food stops to speed off to, on Navami or on Dashami, at any time of day or night.

 Azad Hind Dhaba

 Where: At Birshipur in Uluberia, 50 km from the city.

 What to expect: Spacious and clean, this is a great family/friends hangout, bordering a BPCL car stop. Like any dhaba worth its salt, this one is famous for its Tandoori dishes and variety of Kebabs. The items are priced between Rs 25 and 175.

 Though we are a new entrant, we have been able to attract many people. Our biggest strength is the size of the dhaba. Its almost as large as a football field, says manager Navratan Sharma. 

 Timings: 24x7

 Call: 26613794, 9830651975

 Sher-e-Punjab

 Where: On National Highway 6, 70 km from Calcutta. Take a left turn from Kona Expressway and drive down the highway.

 What to expect: The 120-cover dhaba, built in 1983, used to cater mainly to the truckers. Today, the family crowd constitutes Sher-e-Punjabs primary clientele. The dhaba is known for its Tadka, Tandoori Roti and Chicken Tandoori.

 The bar and the exclusive family enclosure have been a hit, says an official of the dhaba.

 Timings: 24x7

 Call: 9932001475

 Reliance A-1 Plaza

 Where: On National Highway 6. Take a left from Kona Expressway and drive towards Kolaghat.

 What to expect: For the Puja days, there is a special buffet consisting of 23 dishes. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies make up the menu. The platter is priced at Rs 150 per person and Rs 500 per family (4 heads).

 The A-1 plazas are fast becoming destinations rather then just food stops on a journey. The elders can relax on the sprawling premises while the kids can enjoy themselves in the playing arena, says a spokesperson for the Reliance hospitality division. 

 Timings: 24x7

 Call: 9831562752

 Reliance A-1 Plaza

 Where: On National Highway 34, en route to Siliguri at Birohi, its a 45-minute drive from Salt Lake 

 What to expect: The buffet and the a la carte menu are the same as at A-1 Plaza. So, a good place to put up your feet and spend some leisurely hours.

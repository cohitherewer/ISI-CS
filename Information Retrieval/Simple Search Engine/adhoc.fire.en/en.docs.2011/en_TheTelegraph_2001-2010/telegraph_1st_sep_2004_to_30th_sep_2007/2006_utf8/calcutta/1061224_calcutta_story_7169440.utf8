 Tragic tale of fact amp; fantasy

 A moment from Madhavi. Picture by Aranya Sen

 The golden frames, the ornate couch, the swing with its red velvet seat... the stuff of court paintings, stylised and sweet. Here incense rises in curls, diyas dance on golden stands, and lyrical dialogue accompanied by music and dance-like gestures tell the sad tale of Madhavi, the beautiful courtesan from a 1,500-year-old Tamil epic.

 Madhavi, which opened on December 22-23 at Padatik Buildwell theatre, is Shyamananda Jalans directorial venture after a decade and more. The last play Jalan had directed was Ramkatha Ramkahani in 1995.

 Madhavi is a character from a Tamil epic called Shilpadikram revolving round the tussle of rich traders wife and mistress. When I read it in translation as a novel Suhaag ke Nupur by Amritlal Nagar, I was impressed. So when we were looking for a script that would justify the talents of our actors and the many facets of this theatre space, I decided to try out a poetic rendition. This one is a lyrical play by Shivaprakash, says Jalan.

 Madhavi presents a play within a play, the courtesan Madhavi (played by Anubha Fatehpuria) is getting ready to meet her beloved Kovallam returning from a long voyage. But the audience and some of the actors are aware that Madhavis wait will be endless as Kovallam has been killed in Madurai.

 So what we have is an elaborate pretence, a dramatic presentation of an ideal past which Madhavi wants to cling to. Bedecked in jewels and flowers she waits for Kovallam, while maids (played by Chetna Jalan and Vanita Agarwal) struggle to keep her daughter (Kovallams child) from crying out and breaking the spell. 

 Many philosophical aspects are touched upon, says Jalan. What if Madhavi knows the truth and is deliberately trying to overlook it? Was Madhavi wise in refusing to marry Kovallam just to keep the yearning alive?

 The play translated by Basant Rungta has songs set to music by Balu Dutt and light design by Subrata Mazumdar. It mirrors appearance and reality, truth and fantasy.

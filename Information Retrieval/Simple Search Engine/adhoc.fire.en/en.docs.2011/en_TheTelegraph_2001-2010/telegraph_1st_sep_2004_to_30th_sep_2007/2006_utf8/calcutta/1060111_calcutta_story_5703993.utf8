 Exquisite artefacts crafted in silver and glass, wooden sculptures modelled as furniture, rich furnishings for the home, clothes from designers across the country, jewellery pieces in gold and precious gems ? all this and more showcased stylishly in a minimalist yet chic ambience. Thats Prana, a 5,000 sq ft lifestyle store set to open its doors on January 12.

 The first thing that greets you at the 13/3, Ballygunge Circular Road store is the beautiful portrayal of the three elements of nature ? fire, water and earth ? at the entrance. The depiction of fire motifs in a red background, water in blue and earth in green sets the mood for the decor of the rest of the store.

 The unique thing about Prana, which means life energy, is that the products have been thematically displayed according to the three nature elements, says proprietor Kavita Khaitan.

 For instance, the jewellery section depicts fire and passion and hence the ceiling in this part of the store is painted red. We have linked the garment section to water because of the free-flowing nature of creativity and hence one wall here is painted blue. Likewise, the home section stands for earth and so the decor bears touches of green.

 These highlights apart, the store is done up in white with dashes of steel.

 The home section spells sheer luxury with its objects d art furniture crafted from wood sculptures, furnishings like bedspreads and cushions, glassware and silverware. There is imported wooden furniture, Naga and tribal furniture and wooden showpieces and vases by Viya Home. The furniture is not the very functional kind; it enhances the aesthetics of a room, says Kavita. 

 The focus of the furnishings section by Nikita Jhajharia is on the wide array of cushions, though bedspreads too share the racks.

 A whole section dedicated to glass, crystal and porcelain pieces from brands like Kosta Boda, Orrefors and Nicco, boasts vases of various shapes, sizes and colours and other decoratives. The silverware section by Episode is a show-stealer. Sparkling silver artworks like an entire collection of Ganeshas, functional bar sets, desk sets, baby sets, tea sets and more.

 With shop-in-shops by city designer Preeti Jhawar and Delhi-based label Ruh, the garment section at Prana is a multi-starrer. The designer label list reads Ambrish Damani, Ksara, Medhavini Khaitan, Sonali Mansingka, Gauri amp; Nainika, Siddhartha Tytler, Rajvi Mohan, Wild Orchid...

 Its a platform for young and upcoming designers from Calcutta as well as other metros, smiles Kavita. From dressy lehngas and saris to gorgeous cocktail wear to smart evening wear, the variety is indeed wide. Accessories like bags, shoes, belts and silver costume jewellery complement the clothes.

 A highlight of the garment section is the range of shawls on offer from designers Sonya Atal Sapru and Sirat Gupta. Traditional motifs used in contemporary styles with Pashmina makes this collection quite unique.

 The line of smart, cocktail jewellery comes in gold and silver, set with diamonds and emeralds, and also beautifully crafted jadau pieces.

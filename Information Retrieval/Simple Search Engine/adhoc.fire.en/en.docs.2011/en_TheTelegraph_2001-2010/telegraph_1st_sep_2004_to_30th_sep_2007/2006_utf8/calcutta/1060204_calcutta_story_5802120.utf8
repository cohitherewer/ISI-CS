 GREAT IN A GROUP: The Rang De Basanti line-up

 Four decades later, the yellow submarine is back. Only this time, it?s not the Beatles but Aamir Khan and his gang who are painting the town yellow. Rang De Basanti has not only given the year its first hit, it has turned out to be a breather for many a busy executive in the city, too.

 Besides registering big collections everywhere ? an average of 85 per cent occupancy at the Calcutta cineplexes till Friday ? Rang De Basanti has had companies flocking to book entire shows. As many as 25 shows of the film were block-booked in the first week itself at the four city multiplexes and the demand is getting stronger in Week II. 

 While some companies want their customers to go and check out Aamir in his cool new avatar, most want their own employees to take a break and enjoy what should be one of the biggest blockbusters of recent times.

 ?We have had block bookings for many films before, but the demand to watch Rang De in a group has been unprecedented,? says Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum), where Kotak Mahindra booked five shows on five consecutive days. ?The feeling of togetherness that the movie projects is prompting companies to inspire their employees. What?s more, the bookings this time are not only on weekends, but even on weekdays.?

 ?When I saw the movie, I felt that there can be no better combination of entertainment and sending out a message. We immediately had a show booked for our employees,? says Bhavna Agarwal, vice-president, corporate communication of Visa Steel.

 If INOX had companies like Kotak Mahindra, Visa Steel, Tata Motors and ICICI queuing up to buy up shows of the film, 89 Cinemas had the likes of the Ambujas, Pepsi and Hungama TV bulk-booking prime-time shows in the first week. Says Prashant Srivastava, general manager of the Swabhumi multiplex: ?We are also having Rotary clubs blocking 150 to 200 seats at a time and coming in with their families.?

 For firms like Tata Indicom, Rang De helped them connect with customers. ?We blocked three back-to-back shows at Fame (Hiland Park) last Saturday and the response from our customers was fantastic,? reveals a customer care official of Tata Indicom. ?The theme of the movie, along with the presence of Aamir Khan, gelled perfectly with the profiles of our premium customers.?

 No surprise then that the city plexes are running six to seven daily shows of Rang De in its second week, despite the release of two new movies (Aksar and Mere Jeevan Saathi) on February 3. As Fame (Hiland Park) general manager Ravi Raman puts it: ?It?s been quite some time that a big film like Rang De has scored this big.?

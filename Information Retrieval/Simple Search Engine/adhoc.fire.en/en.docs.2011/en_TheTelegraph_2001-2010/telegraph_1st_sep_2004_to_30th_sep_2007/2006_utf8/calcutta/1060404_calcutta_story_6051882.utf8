 Of utility and creativity

 Designing is a problem-solving exercise. It seeks to find remedies for the demands for particular kinds of clothing ? this unique take on fashion comes from Rahul Mishra, the 24-year-old design student who proved to be the surprise package at the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai, drawing audience applause and buyer response.

 The final-year apparel design and merchandising student of the National Institute of Design (NID) in Pune was the star of the Liberty Gen Next Designers show on March 30, which featured collections by five other design students.

 Rahuls first taste of success came with a collection titled Ray of Light. Targeted at tourists with Kerala as the inspiration, the line bore out his problem-solving philosophy.

 I think there is a major lack of fashionable clothes designed for tourists. In this collection I have kept in mind the problems that people usually face while travelling and have tried to work on them, said Rahul.

 l the garments in the collection were reversible. Reversible garments actually give you two outfits in one. So, you have to carry half the number of clothes that you otherwise would have, he explained.

 Fine handloom fabric from Kerala, woven in handlooms of Kollayil, shaped the clothes. Kerala fabrics are so lightweight that they will automatically reduce the weight of your luggage, claimed Rahul.

 Reversible coats, skirts, wrap pants, blouses and gowns with the traditional fabrics made up the line. Soft ecru shades with gold and orange borders formed the palette. The silhouettes were finely tailored and structured.

 With Albert Morris from Londons fashion landmark Browns quite openly voicing praise for Rahul (the only designer apart from Sabyasachi Mukherjee who managed to hold Morriss attention), the budding talent was flooded with enquiries.

 The overwhelming interest that buyers showed in my collection was quite unexpected. I have bagged orders from domestic buyers that I will go back to my institute and finalise. Quite a few international buyers also wanted to place orders, but I dont think I am ready for that right now. A lot of production and management-related issues have to be sorted out first, he admitted.

 There is a lot more to fashion design than just creativity, stressed Rahul. It has to be user-centric, you have to know your clientele and produce different designs for different people. Its basically about the right styling for the right client.

 For now, Rahul is looking forward to his one-year stint with the Instituto Marangoni in Milan, for which he has bagged a scholarship through a national contest.

 After finishing my course at NID next month, I will head for Milan. I have an option to take up any fashion-related course there and I want to study fashion management. Thats one area in which Indian designers lack, he explained. Also, just living in Italy for a year will be a training in fashion design.

 Hailing from Kanpur, Rahul bagged a bachelors degree in science before getting into NID. Since my school days, I was very interested in fashion, but my father wanted me to take up a mainstream career. And I am not rebellious by nature, so to make him happy I did my B.Sc.

 Soon after, he applied to NID and NIFT and got through both. Now, my dad is very happy, smiled the find of Lakme Fashion Week.

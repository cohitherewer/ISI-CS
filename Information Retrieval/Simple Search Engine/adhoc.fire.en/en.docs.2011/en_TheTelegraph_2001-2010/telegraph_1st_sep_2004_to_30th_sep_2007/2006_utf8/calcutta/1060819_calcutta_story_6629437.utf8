The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diversity amp; deconstruction

 With 14 plays in 10 years, BRATYA BASU has established himself as one of the most prolific and controversial dramatists of our times. With Hemlat-Prince of Garanhata, Page 4, Operation 2010 being staged and two new plays, Darjiparar Marjinara and Mrityu Ishwar Jounota, lined up, the dramatist-actor-director talks to Sebanti Sarkar about his itch to shout out loud.

 Girish Karnad recently said 

 theatre is dead in Calcutta and that the only promising 

 plays being written are in Maharashtra. How would you react 

 to that?

 What Karnad said is the kind of thing one expects from a cultural bureaucrat. Karnad was undoubtedly a great dramatist but these days he has too many other commitments to actually check the theatrical scene here or elsewhere. Neither me nor anyone else in India needs to take note of such comments. 

 But where do you find the inspiration 

 to keep churning out plays?

 In the dictionary (laughs). No, it can come from anywhere a broken image, a discarded clay cup, snatches of conversation, a comment, insults, love. But I write when it becomes impossible to do anything else but write. That writing could be a Page 4 or a Hemlat. One of our so-called seniors believes that I have erred in turning to Hamlet because to him Shakespeares Hamlet is purity personified. But for me inspiration comes from both the pure and the impure.

 Hemlat even in its fourth 

 show, has been quite a success

 Credit for the success of Hemlat mostly rests with the actors.

 But what made you write this 

 play?

 It was written some two years ago, when I was struck by the decadent nature of the times we live in. I chose Hamlet because I found in it the seed of initial existentialism but I realised at once that I would have to rewrite the text I tried my best to forget the original text. If July 17 was a reconstruction of Manusher Odhikare, in Hemlat I attempt a deconstruction of the text.

 There have been complaints 

 about the use of too much slang in Hemlat

 No, there isnt too much slang. There was slang in my first play Ashaleen but with it was a debate for and against the use of slang and expletives. Expletives are for me a weapon and it is up to me in which play I will or will not need to use it. But they are certainly not used to make people laugh or to draw crowds. I believe expletives are an expression of violence.

 Have you used expletives in 

 the next two plays?

 Yes, in Darjiparar Marjinara, but it is missing from Mrityu Eshwar Jaunota.

 Known as you are for variety, 

 there must be some link among these plays you keep coming 

 up with?

 No, each is different. I have totally rewritten Darjiparar Marjinara, which I will produce later this year, and it is no longer the same as the published version. But it still is about the predicament of people who live and try to work in this city. Mrityu Ishwar Jounota to be presented by Srijok in September compiles three monologues on the three inevitables of human life god, death and love.

 What was Operation 2010, 

 launched at Sujata Sadan last Sunday, all about?

 We had done two shows earlier, but this one was by Natyamukh of Ashoknagar. Here again the focus is different football, and the possibilities of India winning the World Cup! 

 Do you need to update your 

 plays, say like Page 4?

 Yes sometimes, but nothing except the casting needed to be changed in Page 4. The play will continue to be relevant as long as the unholy nexus between cultural and political hegemonies remain. One reason why Page 4 has not received the kind of publicity my other plays have got is maybe because the play attacks the very mechanism responsible for such publicity.

 Rail aid for water line tunnel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Acting on the civic authorities? plea, the railway ministry has directed its civil engineering subsidiary, Rites, to help the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) construct an underground tunnel beneath the railway tracks and Boat Canal in Majerhat.

 The tunnel will link the 56-inch-diameter water mains from Garden Reach with the booster pumping stations at Garfa, Kalighat and Ranikuthi. The CMC has been hard-pressed to find a contractor for the 200-m tunnel to be built six metres below ground level.

 Only two firms had responded to the civic body?s tender floated 10 months ago. One did not fulfil the eligibility criteria, while the other backed out, citing ?poor soil condition? at the site. The civic authorities had then approached Rites with the contract, but it refused to take up the work.

 On December 21, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had written to railway minister Lalu Prasad, requesting him to ask Rites to construct the tunnel. The ministry arranged a meeting between Rites executive director B.K. Makhija and the mayor in Delhi last week.

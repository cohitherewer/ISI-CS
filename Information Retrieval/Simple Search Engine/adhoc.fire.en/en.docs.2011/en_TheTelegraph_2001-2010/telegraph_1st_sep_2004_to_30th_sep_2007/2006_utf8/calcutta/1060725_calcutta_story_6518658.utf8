The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mission mainstream

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subir Kumar Das now leads a normal life. After an 18-year fight against his drug addiction, Das runs a printing unit at Feal Lane, near Moulali. 

 Apart from working in the unit, he also distributes newspapers in his locality in the morning and teaches two students in the evening.

 Das is not alone. Nine others, once victims of addiction, are also leading normal lives. Thanks to the self-help group founded by V. Pavamani in 1997. The unit, funded by NGO Calcutta Samaritan and a German group, not only shelters the addicts but also helps them to return to the mainstream.

 ?The unit has improved our lifestyle for the better. It?s not just a workplace, it?s like a rehabilitation centre where we are motivated towards a better future. All our members now lead normal lives, some of us are even married and have landed ourselves a job,? said Das.

 In the initial years, the self-help group had only one or two members. But currently, nine of the members are running the printing unit. 

 ?Addicts suffer from some form of guilt and often feel helpless. This prompted me to come up with this self-help group that would shelter them and also keep them busy,? said founder V. Pavamani.

 The members are specialised in making greeting cards, letterheads, envelopes, visiting cards, photo lamination and other stationery. The clients range from schools, clubs to big firms like Tata AIG and Lexus Motors. ?The orders range from official forms to annual reports of clubs and companies to certificates to photo lamination and others,? said Das. 

 The handmade products are also in demand abroad. ?Our Christmas cards are quite popular in England. We have already delivered the first lot and we have earned around Rs 40,000,? said V. Pavamani.

 Plans are afoot to rehabilitate street children, who are addicts. ?Our focus is to chalk out a similar programme for vagrants and street children, so that they can be independent in future.?

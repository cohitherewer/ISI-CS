 Attackers wanted imam dead 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The two youths who chased Hazi Abdul Rezzak on a motorcycle on bridge no. 4, in Park Circus, on Saturday evening, had come with the intention of shooting the 33-year-old leather trader, police said on Sunday.

 ?Going by our preliminary findings, it doesn?t seem that the youths had chased Abdul just to snatch the Rs 1 lakh he was carrying in a bag,? said a senior officer of the detective department. ?They wanted to kill him. Had money been the target, the youths could have stopped Abdul and snatched the bag by brandishing a revolver. But they fired at him thrice, once after overtaking him.?

 Besides the detective department, officers of Karaya police station and the special branch, too, are probing the case that has left a large section of leather traders in Tangra and Topsia rattled. 

 Four persons have been rounded up since Saturday night, but Abdul, also the imam of the local Janab Ali Masjid, did not identify any of them.

 With the registration number of the motorcycle not available, the sleuths are trying to hunt the suspects on the basis of descriptions provided by a few witnesses. ?All we know is that the attackers are in their late twenties and that they were wearing black trousers,? said an officer of the Karaya police station.

 Bill Clinton wants the world to see him. Richard Gere discusses the finer points of tap dancing with him. Michael Douglas wants him to show the Americans how to do his special moves. The last time he was in Calcutta, Shiamak Davar spoke on choreographing the likes of Shahid Kapur and Aishwarya Rai but on Tuesday, when he came down for the final show of Summer Funk 2006, the man seemed to be in a different zone altogether.

 And rightly so. The last year has seen Shiamak moving in leaps and bounds, choreographing every big stage event from the IIFA Awards in Amsterdam to the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. From making the Bachchans ? Amitabh and Abhishek ? match steps to guiding Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee through the bhangra, Shiamak has done it all.

 ?It felt really good when the Indian government decided to show the world at the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games that Indian dance is not only about classical steps,? Shiamak told Metro at the Science City auditorium where the Calcutta dance workshop was culminating in a grand show in the evening. ?I put in everything from Indo-jazz to Sufi to contemporary to Odissi steps in my moves. Of course, in my signature style.?

 The man who aims to evolve as an educationist and not just another choreographer, wants his dance students from Calcutta to get into his professional team. ?I want to take all of you to all the places I am invited to perform,? Shiamak announced during his pep talk before the packed auditorium. ?The only problem is that we do not have a regular year-round class in this city but that?s something we want to start soon.?

 Another focus area for Shiamak is the development of his Victory Arts Foundation. ?Through this foundation I want to teach dance to all those special kids who are either suffering from AIDS or are children of sex workers or are physically challenged in some way. Apart from 10-odd NGOs from where I have personally picked up children, our school is also training kids from the Helen Keller institute.?

 The choreographer of Dil To Pagal Hai and Taal is also raring to do a bit of Bollywood. ?I just had a chat with Adi (Aditya Chopra) and I will choreograph a Hrithik number in Dhoom 2. I am also doing two songs in Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s Saawariyan,? smiled Shiamak.

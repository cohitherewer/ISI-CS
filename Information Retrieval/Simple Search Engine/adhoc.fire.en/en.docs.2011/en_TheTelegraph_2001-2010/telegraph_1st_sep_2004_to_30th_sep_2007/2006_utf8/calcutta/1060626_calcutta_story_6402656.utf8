?Only Hrithik could be Krrish?

Screen On amp; Off

 Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka 

 Chopra in Krrish

The Singaporeans treat him like one of them. And why not? On Rakesh Roshan lies the responsibility of showcasing their country to the rest of the world. The man himself spent a good 60 days shooting in the Lion City, after having made three recce trips to scout locations. So when the actor-turned-director walks on the footbridges and quays of Singapore, you can mistake him for a ?local? Indian on his way to work.

 And what work! With help from a whole lot of sponsors ? try and count them as you watch the movie ? and, of course, the Singapore Tourism Board, Rakesh Roshan has placed Rs 50 crore on the broad shoulders of Krrish. Because, he wants to ?take Hindi films to the next level?.

 Having been inspired by The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Rakesh decided to take the story of Koi? Mil Gaya forward. Koi Tumsa Nahin, named after one of the lilting ballads in the soundtrack was the proposed title, but it became Krrish once numerology raised its timely head.

 ?Krrish is an entirely different film from Koi? Mil Gaya and even Hrithik is not playing the same character,? Rakesh says, not perturbed by the appalling success rate of sequels in Bollywood. ?Here there?s no Jadoo (the alien who gave special powers to Hrithik?s character in KMG), only Jadoo ka karishma.?

 What makes Krrish unique is that the sequel has brought about a change of genre ? from a sci-fi alien film to a superhero action adventure. It has also automatically placed the movie opposite Superman Returns which releases worldwide this Friday. ?I believe Superman Returns and Krrish are two very different films,? Rakesh argues. ?The main difference lies in the fact that Krrish is Indian. Also, both stories have their own plots. I would go on to say Krrish is different to any film that has been made.?

 The backdrop itself makes the film look very different. No Indian film has shown Singapore the way Krrish does, with more than 60 per cent of the film shot in different locations around the country. ?The second half of my script demanded a foreign location and when I came to Singapore for the IIFA Awards in 2004, what struck me about the place was that everything was within a few kilometres,? Rakesh goes into flashback mode. ?The Singapore Tourism Board was also looking for Indian film-makers to shoot here. Our paths met and destiny led me to set my film here.?

 Incorporating the most scenic of Singapore locations was a challenge not new to Rakesh. ?I never choose locations randomly and then pass them off in my film as some other locations,? he states, with more than a touch of pride in his voice. ?Locations have always been integral parts of my films, whether Bangkok or New Zealand or Canada or Singapore. And the films in turn have helped the tourism boards of the country. New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clarke gave us a present for helping to spruce up the tourist count of the country through Kaho Naa? Pyaar Hai. You can call Singapore a character in my film.?

 But it wasn?t easy getting 200-ft cranes to meander across the busy roads and have 200 local extras do as directed in a controlled atmosphere. ?It is always a tough call to shoot on roads and on real locations and also use helicopters for the shots,? Rakesh explains. ?But the Board helped us through all that. They put special advertisements in the papers and shut down roads so that we could shoot in peace. Robinson Road, which is a very important road in the city, was closed for three weeks every Saturday and Sunday.?

 Now that Krrish has released, Rakesh?s concerns are not about shooting schedules but things like merchandising and international-language dubbing. ?There will be everything from Krrish toys and T-Shirts to water bottles and tiffin boxes,? he says. ?As for the dubbing, it?s released in Tamil and Telugu in India, apart from Hindi. I have also sold the rights to dub Krrish in German, Spanish and Malay. If there?s a demand to dub it in Chinese (close to 80 per cent of the Singapore population is Chinese), I have no problems.?

 Whatever be the language, does 

 Krrish have the steam and the stunts to complete 

 the hit hattrick after Kaho Naa? Pyaar Hai and Koi? 

 Mil Gaya? ?Every film has its own destiny but all I 

 can say is that I cannot visualise any other actor doing 

 what Hrithik has done in the film,? says the proud father. 

 ?And I am telling you all this not because he is my son. 

 Krrish is about his personality, the own shades that 

 he has added to the character? Only he could have done this.?

 Metro-Movie-Meter

 Krrish

 Koi... Mil Gayas Rohit and 

 his wife are long dead but son Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) 

 seems to have all the powers the alien Jadoo had bestowed 

 on Rohit. His Dadi (Rekha) may have locked him up from the 

 world for a couple of decades but love in the form of Priya 

 (Priyanka Chopra) takes him to Singapore where he helps 

 save the world from a sinister scientist (Naseeruddin Shah).

 Hrithik is incredible as the village simpleton who rises 

 with his genes to become a global saviour. His human approach 

 to his special powers makes him so much more identifiable. 

 Heres a superhero whom you dont mind seeing 

 crying for his granny or catching butterflies for his sweetheart.

 The last half an hour is on a par with any Hollywood thriller 

 in terms of action choreography, special effects and camerawork. 

 You aint seen anything like this on Indian screen 

 and that too featuring an Indian superstar. The climax alone 

 makes Krrish a must watch.

 The songs may be not helping the screenplay but its 

 a treat to watch Hrithik and Priyanka romance, from the 

 icy climes of Shimla to the sunny beaches of Sentosa Islands. 

 The basic plot makes Krishna more like a King Kong or a 

 Tarzan brought to the city from the village as a display 

 item, and that certainly is not ideal groundwork for a superhero.

 The first half of the film is a drag. The build-up to the 

 romance is so archaic and hackneyed that you feel youve 

 stepped into the wrong theatre for the first hour and some.

 Rekha looks straight out of Bhoot. Her body language and 

 dialogue delivery are befitting of a horror movie, not a 

 feel-good adventure like Krrish.

 Last word: Krrish is not about a superhero; its 

 about super hero Hrithik being given a plausible reason 

 to show his prowess and, boy, he does it so well. Go, have 

 your piece of the action.

 Maidan security beef-up 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have decided to strengthen their early morning vigil in the Maidan area after three youths on a motorcycle tried to snatch a gold chain from a morning walker in front of Victoria Memorial on Sunday. The number of policemen in the area will be increased soon.

 Deputy commissioner (south division) Ajay Kumar said the move was initiated to protect morning walkers from criminals. ?Officers have been asked to keep a close watch on the areas frequented by morning walkers,? he stated.

 Currently, a police jeep is parked opposite Birla Planetarium. ?From now on, we will keep an eye on the western slope of the AJC Bose Road flyover and all thoroughfares around the Maidan. The Maidan, Hastings, Park Street and Shakespeare Sarani police stations have also been alerted,? said Kumar.

 Police have also prepared a list of roads that criminals may use to flee from the area.

 Early on Sunday, the three youths had made an abortive bid to rob a woman as the other morning walkers had raised a hue and cry. A police jeep chased the trio, who fled towards Park Circus.

 One of the youths, Mohammad Abib, lost control of the two-wheeler and rammed into a road divider. He was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. His accomplices managed to escape.

 A couple of years ago, a morning walker was abducted from the same area. He was released only after his family paid a ransom. The abductors were later arrested.

 Actor with new aim

With a ?thought-provoking? film based on a novel by Suchitra Bhattacharya, actor Arjun Chakraborty is set to slip into the director?s chair. Apart from Arjun himself, the cast includes Koel Mullick, Mamata Shankar, Tota Roy Chowdhury and Chaiti Ghosal. Bikram Ghosh will score the background music.

 The Ankush actor began his screen career at the ?impressionable age of 19?, assisting Gulzar in four films ? Namkeen, Angur, Libaas and the unfinished Devdas. ?Being an assistant director, I didn?t have any say then but I always wanted to explore several ideas. It took a backseat as I turned to acting, but the desire has long remained bottled inside me,? says Arjun.

 For his directorial debut, the actor has decided on a story that revolves around a relationship between a young girl and an older man. ?The film is about how a person ruins all her other relationships in order to form a new relationship. The passion and craving for someone can be so overwhelming that it destroys everything else around her,? says the actor who plays a professor in the film. Koel stars as a college girl who is besotted by the professor, pursues him till he gives in and walks out on her family for a live-in relationship with him.

 ?What attracted me to Suchitradi?s story is the crumbling of so many relationships in the flash of a moment. One rash decision changing so many lives? The professor dumps his wife (Mamata Shankar) and the girl refuses to marry the man (Tota) she is supposed to. The turmoil subsides slowly and things return to normal, but not everything is the same as before. Some old relationships have been destroyed, some new relationships have sprung up. This twist of life fascinates me and as a director I feel like a helpless onlooker,? observes Arjun.

 As the professor, Arjun says he decided to cast himself because he could not find any other actor who fitted the bill. ?I needed someone between 45 and 50 years old, who should look virile for an 18-year-old girl to be attracted to him physically and mentally. But I didn?t get anyone,? he admits.

 The storyline demands a few love-making scenes ? between the professor and his wife, and between him and the girl. But Arjun is not out to sensationalise this. ?It?s there for the sake of the subject.?

 Juggling the dual roles of director and actor will not be a tough act to follow in his first film, he insists. ?Many people have done that before ? Raj Kapoor, Clint Eastwood, Robert Redford?,? rattles of Arjun, before dwelling on the indelible influence of film-maker mentors Gulzar and Tapan Sinha.

 The untitled film, to go on the floors in the first week of October in Calcutta, will be produced by ARG Enterprise ? a production company that Arjun has floated along with a few friends. The plan is to churn out Bengali and Hindi films, plus TV serials. ?We plan to make quite a few Hindi films from Calcutta. I intend to make a Hindi film to be scripted by Gulzar.?

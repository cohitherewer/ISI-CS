The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Being Masha, then moving on

 In the countdown to the release of Shadows of Time, TANNISHTHA CHATTERJEE speaks to Reshmi Sengupta about the film and her journey

 Tannishtha Chatterjee in 

 Shadows of Time 

 How did you get the role of Masha in Shadows of Time?

 Casting director Dilip Shankar contacted me and asked me over for a screen test in Mumbai. I went and Florian (Gallenberger) made me do a couple of improvisations. He wanted to know if I could sing and dance and how many languages I spoke. I was called the next day and I was asked to sing and dance. Florian then made me do a couple of scenes from the film.

 They had met and screen-tested many big stars in Bollywood, and I was a fresh graduate from NSD without much experience. They called me again after some months for a test and I had to do different scenes with different co-actors. Florians script was in English then. He hadnt decided what language he would make the film in. He only knew that he wanted to shoot it in Calcutta.

 Then the producers came down and told me: You will be Masha.

 Did you have any workshop before going on the floors?

 Tannishtha Chatterjee 

 with Prashant Narayanan in Shadows of Time

 Yes, Irrfan, Prashant (Narayanan) and I came down to Calcutta for a 15-day rehearsal, and I trained in kathak under Vikram Iyengar for two months. I also sang in the film, for the first time. Thats the track for which Debajyotida (Mishra) has composed the music.

 How did Florian communicate the Bengali script?

 Florian had made his first film in Spanish and shot it in Mexico. So, making a film in a foreign language wasnt a first for him. He has a knack for understanding cultures and languages. He likes to pick up universal stories and search for a cinematic language. He was quite a famous child artiste in Germany There were moments during our rehearsals when I would ask for a retake and Florian, too, would insist that that portion had gone wrong, which was quite uncanny.

 How was Florian as a director?

 He is specific about what he wants. He guides you and allows you to do it first, but will intervene if he feels that you havent got it right and go for as many takes as long he is not satisfied.

 How were your co-actors Irrfan and Prashant?

 I had worked with Irrfan in 2004. He had directed me in a telefilm, which was my first work in Mumbai. It was a very difficult role of a demented girl. We have been friends since. As a co-actor, he allowed me to do what I wanted to do. The benefit of working with a good actor is that you can do different things. If you improvise he will also contribute.

 Prashant is a very funny guy. He is very much unlike what he plays in Shadows. He is a natural and a fine actor.

 What was the audience reaction to Shadows at the 

 Berlin Film Festival?

 It was very interesting. Some felt the film was a melodramatic story told in a very German style. Some appreciated the actors immensely. Some were surprised that I could give a controlled performance, coming from Bollywood.

 How much of a milestone is Shadows of Time in your 

 film career? Did it help you bag Brick Lane?

 I wouldnt like to look at it that way. The exposure has helped me more in a different way travelling and meeting people. Shadows didnt help directly in getting Brick Lane, but yes Sarah (Gavron) had seen Shadows.

 Now, where would you slot Bibar in your cinematic 

 journey?

 I was very happy with my work in Bibar. This is what I wanted to do from what I had understood of Neeta, my character in the film. But I heard that Bibar got mixed reactions. Well, this is part of any expression But Bibar fetched me and Subrata (Datta) the best actor and actress awards at Osian.

 Any offers yet from Bollywood?

 There are a few but I havent signed anything. I will do anything thats different from what I have done already. You need to make those choices. You need to tell people that you are capable of doing a variety of films. Avenues for actors have expanded with multiplexes coming up. And there are different films, different stories being made within Bollywood, like Omkara and My Brother Nikhil.

 So, where do you go from here?

 I am waiting to see

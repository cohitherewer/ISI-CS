The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stop-job threat to tallest towers

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The pollution control board has threatened to slap a ?closure order upon the entire project? of South City, Calcutta?s biggest real estate venture, if ?there is any attempt of construction? in the adjoining ?Bikramgarh Jheel area?.

 This is according to an order signed by Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer, state pollution control board, on April 5 (a copy of which is with Metro).

 The order follows inquiries by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the state fisheries department that confirmed how ?the project proponent has already encroached the waterbody?, on the southern fringes of the project site on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

 ?The charges are baseless. They are being levelled by the CMC and the green board without conducting a proper survey,? South City CEO Sanjay Choudhary told Metro on Friday evening.

 Metro had, on March 1, reported how the giant project, spread over 31.14 acres, had been rapped by the PCB for four alleged environmental follies, including filling up of the Jheel and filling up a pond at the construction site without creating a bigger one (as mandated by the board).

 On March 30, the CMC had written to the green board that ?the premise boundary of South City, on the southern side, encroaches? on around 10,000 sq m of the Jheel. A parking lot has come up on around 4,000 sq m of the encroached area, the letter added. The findings were based on an aerial survey map of the city, prepared in 2003. 

 The green board order directs the developers to ?stop all construction work? on the Jheel and asks Jadavpur police station to ?oversee that the project proponent should not continue any further construction job? on the waterbody.

 The board has also formed a committee ? headed by P.N. Roy, chairman of the state government?s Environment Impact Assessment Committee ? to examine all green issues related to South City. The developers have been directed to submit all relevant documents to the panel.

 South City CEO Choudhary, asserting that the developers had ?nothing to hide?, promised to extend ?full cooperation? to the board?s panel.

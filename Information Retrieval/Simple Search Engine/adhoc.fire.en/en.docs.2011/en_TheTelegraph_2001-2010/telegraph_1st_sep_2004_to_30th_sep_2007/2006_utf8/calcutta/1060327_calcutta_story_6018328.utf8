The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blitz prod for lamp post scan

 SUSHIL KUMAR SHARMA, mayoral council member (lighting and environment), Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Dippi Singh, Md Alamgir, Heera Singh, Seikh Absar, Subhadyuti Datta, Subal Ghosh, Sunil Roy, Sandip Banerjee, Shelly Sinha, Abdus Saraf, Lakshmi Chaudhury, Saud Ahmad, Sikha Mitra, P.K. Roy, Bachan Bose, Sailen Sarkar, Avijit Bose, Ranjan Sarkar, Sohan Yadav, Sheela Chaudhury and Rahul Sinha

Sandip Banerjee: The Telegraph recently carried a series of reports on street lights not functioning along important stretches. Why don?t you maintain the street lights properly? How long will it take to repair the lights?

 I would like to inform you that the civic lighting department is responsible for maintaining 120,000 lamp posts in the city. I admit that some of them need repair. Following the publication of the reports, I visited Judge?s Court Road. The lights there were repaired in 24 hours.

 Lamp posts along important thoroughfares like APC Road, the Vidyasagar Setu approach and Dufferin Road also do not function. But they do not belong to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

Sandip Banerjee: Which agency is responsible for maintaining those lamp posts?

 The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) are yet to hand over those lamp posts to us. 

 Series connection is another problem that we face when we take over lamp posts from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) or the HRBC. If one street light in a series goes off then six, 10 or 12 lamp posts also become non-operational.

 The civic body on the other hand does not connect more than four lamp posts in a series, and that too, only alternate posts.

Subhadyuti Datta: How many agencies are responsible for illuminating the city streets?

 The CMC is responsible for maintaining most of the street lights in the city. Over 96 per cent of the lamp posts are owned by the civic body.

 The other agencies that maintain street lights in specific pockets are the public works department, HRBC, Calcutta Port Trust, Calcutta Improvement Trust and the CMDA.

 Recently, the CMDA handed over more than 20,000 lamp posts to the civic body.

Subhadyuti Datta: Why don?t you take over the maintenance of the street lights from other agencies?

 We have requested the agencies several times to hand over the responsibility to us. They have never considered the proposal seriously.

 I have recently discussed the matter with the mayor. It has been decided that the agencies will be approached yet again for the transfer of lamp posts along with the budgetary allotment for them. Taking over a lamp post means an additional annual maintenance cost of Rs 4,000. Hence, we want to realise the maintenance cost from the agencies.

Bachan Bose: What steps have you taken to keep the streets illuminated at night?

 I have directed the civic deputy chief engineer (electrical), Pradip Jyoti Biswas, to prepare borough-wise status reports of street lights and direct the assistant and sub-assistant engineers concerned to undertake the necessary repair.

Sailen Sarkar: What action have you taken against those who tried to fill up a one-bigha pond at 52, Bondel Road?

 An attempt was made to fill up the pond with waste about seven years ago. A complaint was lodged with the environment department and the move was stalled. I will soon visit the pond and take steps to restore it. 

Ranjan Sarkar: A group of realtors is felling trees on a five-bigha plot on 13,14 and 30 Bondel Road. There used to be a foreign liquor warehouse on the plot.

 Thank you for the information. Let me assure you that felling of trees without clearance will not be allowed. I will inspect the site very soon and take necessary action.

Concluded

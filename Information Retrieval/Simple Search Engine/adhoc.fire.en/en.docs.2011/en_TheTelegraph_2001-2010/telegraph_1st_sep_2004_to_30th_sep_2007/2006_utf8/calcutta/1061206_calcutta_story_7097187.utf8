 Honey, here comes the moon

 Wedding planner 

 (From top) Get inspired: Glimpses from Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd;A popular honeymoon haunt, Maldives 

 If you think of it, honeymoons are for pessimists. The word probably dates back to the 16th century, and was used in a rather satirical sense to imply that the period of bliss i.e. honey is brief, and that it will start to fade as soon as it reaches the peak much like the fickle moon.

 Armed with this knowledge, instead of hanging about and getting drunk on mead (a honey-based alcoholic drink that apparently fathers-in-law in Babylon used to dish out to the grooms for a month after the knot was tied, offering an alternative etymology) the young bride and groom decide to skip town.

 Hey, if the bliss will last only a month, a holiday away from the nosy family, scores of lunch-dinner invites and goblets full of honey, could be the best strategy to maximise your chances at an ever after (happy or otherwise).

 Money matters

 an ahead with care, particularly if you are strapped for cash (as you are likely to be after feeding 500 people for days on end). Budget for your holiday packages hotel, tickets, visas etc but leave the rest to your guests.

 Everyone knows that the we regret that we cannot accept any gifts line on the invite is essentially a euphemism for the less subtle but also prevalent we would appreciate your blessings in an envelope line.

 The only difference is that the second statement orders all gifts to be cash only, while the first implores only close relatives and friends to give bankable items usually jewellery or money (cheque, gift certificates, forex, gold biscuits will do just as well, thank you). So that takes care of your travel, food and shopping. What else will you do with it all, anyway?

 Locale hunt

 As for destination, there are a million and one places you could go to, though I would seriously recommend steering clear of Digha-Puri-Darjeeling or any other place within comfortable distance of Calcutta. These for what theyre worth have been done to death.

 Still, if you are looking for something close by, try some off-the-beaten-track locales in north Bengal or Sikkim.

 Otherwise, you are lucky that cyberspace is teeming with Sardars with Kerala drawls and Boman Iranis inspired by jet-setting acquaintances. You need not leave home to plan your week of wedded bliss hundreds of miles away. 

 What you need to do before you log on and get tempted by Magical Maldives or Gorgeous Greece starting at Rs 45,000, is fix your budget.

 The offers all sound great, but once you look at the inclusions, you may have to curb your enthusiasm, or go hungry once you reach your destination, or eat desi khana cooked by your tour operator in a Swiss hotel. So if you are looking at luxury, a modest budget could get you where you want to go, but it is not likely to keep you there for long. If you have all the dough in the world (or dad is footing the bill), you have naught, as usual, to worry about.

 But the most important factor that should decide your destination is this: How well do you know each other? Have you been together for years? Or is this your first opportunity for intimacy?

 If you have been there and done all that before, let the world be your oyster! (Unless you are vegetarian, of course, in which case you have a choice between paneer tikka, crispy chilli baby corn and stuffed mushrooms.) If you barely know each other, decide what level of intensity you are ready for. Can you handle a secluded island getaway where there are no distractions like shopping and sightseeing? Where it is just you and your swimsuits and your heart-shaped bed and your bubbly? If you can handle it, plunge headlong. 

 Pack right

 Remember to pack the negligee your mother-in-law so mortifyingly displayed alongside the rest of your wedding trousseau. This is as good an opportunity as any to use it. 

 Specially, if you have signed up for a pre-wedding slimming package and have lost a few inches here and there. If the honeymoon period is destined to be short-lived, your svelte new bod worth thousands is sure to be even more fleeting.

 Lust for life,

 Theres a buzz in the blog world 

 about Second Life. For those not in the know, Second 

 Life is a 3D virtual world that is (second) home to 

 more than a million people across the globe. Inside this 

 online address, developed by Linden Lab, one can create 

 an avatar of any shape, sex or even species. The avatars 

 interact with each other, buy virtual real estate, go to 

 virtual offices and even marry, virtually. Second Life 

 has its own newspaper and news agency. Reuters last week 

 opened a Second Life bureau that would report only 

 on the community.

 An increasing number of Second 

 Life residents are chucking their jobs in the real world 

 to make their living within the virtual economy. Sounds 

 incredible? Nicholas Chase (http://www.chaosmagnet.com) 

 explains: Everything in Second Life is built by 

 residents, and you can buy and sell these using Linden dollars. 

 Whats cool about that? Well, how about the fact that you 

 can buy and sell those Linden dollars using real dollars. 

 Yes, that means that if you make money in Second Life, 

 you can turn that into cold hard cash. How much cold hard 

 cash? The exchange rate fluctuates, but as far as I can 

 tell, its about one American dollar for 250 Linden dollars.

 Businesses have hitched a ride 

 on the bandwagon. Second Life resident Kimberly Maul 

 (http://thebookstandard.typepad.com) lists whats 

 on offer: Companies like Adidas and Toyota promote and 

 sell products in this virtual world... Penguin is the first 

 major publishing company to have a presence in Second 

 Life... London-based literary agency Greene amp; Heaton 

 has weekly office hours where Second Life residents 

 can talk to an agent. Author Kurt Vonnegut has an avatar. 

 So does Duran Duran. 

 Some residents have chosen to 

 blog only on their Second Life experiences. Heres 

 Alaska Metropolitan (http://alaskametro.blogspot.com), 

 a fashion designer in Second Life: I dont have 

 as much time to spend in Second Life as I wish I 

 could, because of my attempt to balance school + work + 

 financial responsibilities + a social life (the last especially 

 seems to suffer lately). Every once in a while when I log 

 in, the growth of the grid sneaks up and surprises me. My 

 clothing sales have increased over the last few months; 

 it wasnt until they announced the millionth account created 

 that I clued in as to why this was happening.

 Brangelina (Brad Pitt + Angelina 

 Jolie) are reportedly in the process of adopting an Indian 

 child even as Madonna and Guy Ritchies adoption of little 

 David Banda from Malawi kicks up a storm. 

 Herclitus (http://the-reaction.blogspot.com) 

 says: White celebrities should just forego mentioning Africa 

 altogether (Id even be in favour of passing a law requiring 

 it)... Well, now Madonna is back from Africa, and going 

 on the offensive (and on Oprah, no less) Apparently, she 

 still doesnt understand why people are less than admiring 

 of her ploy of going to Africa and carrying off someone 

 elses child as a symbol of her moral goodness, a pendant 

 to pin to her chest to remind the world of how noble she 

 is.

 The fierceness of the criticism 

 has prompted the Material Girl to use, what else, but her 

 blog (http://madonnasthoughts.blogspot.com) to clarify 

 her position: I DID NOT pick my baby out in a lineup! I 

 was sent photos of children to consider. Please help me 

 get the truth out. Friends have told me about stories implying 

 I picked my son out like I was shopping for a handbag. 

 Nothing could be further from the truth!

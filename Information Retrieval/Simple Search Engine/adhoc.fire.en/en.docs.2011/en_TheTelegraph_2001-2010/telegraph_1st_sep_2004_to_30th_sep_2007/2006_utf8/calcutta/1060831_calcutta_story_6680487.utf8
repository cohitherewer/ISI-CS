 No more excuses was Branislav 

 Kraliks slogan for the GeNext on International Youth Day 

 on August 12. The Slovakian student of Jadavpur University 

 was one of the many youngsters who celebrated the occasion 

 on the campus with a cultural programme, slogan-writing 

 contest, debate and poster presentation.

 The programme, organised by the 

 students of JUs department of international relations, 

 was supported by The Youth Explorers Institute for Social 

 Service and the Centres field publicity directorate.

 Though International Youth Day 

 was started in 2000, the youth in Calcutta celebrated it 

 for the first time this year. The city usually celebrates 

 Swami Vivekanandas birthday as National Youth Day. In fact, 

 India was one of the 19 nations across the globe that marked 

 International Youth Day this year.

 The debate at JU was on students 

 policies in the country. National Medical College was one 

 of the participating institutes. The poster competition 

 gave expression to the expectations of the young generation 

 from their contemporaries, elders and the society as a whole. 

 The slogans voiced their determination in changing the world 

 for the better.

 The JU students are not new to 

 community service. The NSS group of JU also works with underprivileged 

 children in the nearby areas. They have the zeal to do 

 something different. This programme is an assurance on our 

 part that we are with them, said Professor Sumita Sen.

 But the governments lack of involvement 

 in the celebrations came as a disappointment. There was 

 hardly any response from the department of youth services, 

 though many of the officials had been very supportive, 

 said Major S.K. Dey of The Youth Explorers Institute for 

 Social Service.

 And how relevant was Youth Day 

 to the youngsters? Every youth should be aware of his or 

 her responsibilities and rights and these should percolate 

 even to the lowest stratum of the society, felt the participants 

 at the programme at JU.

 What is needed is the confidence 

 to speak up and against wrong, be it an individual or the 

 system, pointed out JU student Jyotishka Mondal.

 The Diary

 Thunder Wings

 The thunder thrashes upon 

 the grey citys tombstone

 Rain powders the remains.

 ...she moves in the garden

 after nine thousand years

 and I am reminded of

 the rain in the hills

 when ghosts and angels

 broke their vow of silence. 

 The rebel prophet 

 broke from his grave 

 and screamed.

 Or maybe he sang.

 Songs and screams

 ran fingers through her hair

 her hair of jaguar rain

 and your jazz spreads wings

 over nightmares and tombstones...

 A moment to eternity

 The skies are all in sadness drenched, 

 The wilted leaves fall to the ground; 

 But closed roads open to the wild 

 And lead where all is

 lost when found... 

 The emptiness rings far and wide 

 and silence pervades through all sounds. 

 The grasps of strength loosen

 their hold; 

 Where once hope was, 

 now fear abounds 

 The rain pours on; the dry earth chokes

 And loses itself in the flood 

 And be it grime or be it gold,

 in veins of earth it runs as blood 

 In dim light the world lives content.

 All that is bright is but deceit. 

 For what is seen is what is shown

 And what is felt is but discreet

 Artificiality

 Fade away sweet artificiality,

 the facade of mortals, 

 the livelihood of creativity;

 pretense is but an expression;

 a religion...

 Theres no need to tell anyone;

 erase individuality...

 Theyll only hold us down,

 forget individuality;

 drop your guard, all is forgotten;

 mention mastodon...

 Difficult it is 

 to pretend that I dont see,

 what you hide so carelessly;

 can I not wish it all away?

 Spoken fears do come true 

 artificially,

 what dies in you, 

 I perceive individuality

 what lives in you..nugatory!

 Scaling heights

 Nova, the rock-climbing and mountaineering 

 club, recently held the graduation ceremony of its 7th Basic 

 Rock-Climbing Course and the 5th Camping Course-cum-Nature 

 Study Camp. The week-long courses are held every December 

 at Bansa Hills, in Purulia.

 This years graduation ceremony 

 assumed special significance in the light of the recent 

 mishap at Bagmundi. As Ashish Kumar Dutta, one of the pioneers 

 in Calcutta of camping, pointed out: Safety is the primary 

 concern while organising treks or camps. One should keep 

 in mind where, at what time of the year, as well as with 

 whom one is going.

 He was seconded by club secretary 

 Parthasarathi Dutta: Today, we think that Purulia is a 

 place for accidents, and that trekking and mountaineering 

 are fraught with risks. The truth is that we forget to take 

 precautions and later blame nature for mishaps.

 A lecture by Guruprasad Chattopadhyay, 

 professor of geography at Viswa-Bharati, threw light on 

 the dangers of confusing semi-permanent snow patches with 

 a glacier through a slide show of the Himalayan glaciers 

 and the French Alps.

 Agricultural meteorologist Swadesh 

 Mishra spoke on the role of weather in mountaineering, which, 

 he explained, is influenced by latitude, longitude, the 

 incline of the slope and the direction of the temperate 

 winds. There is no such thing as mountain climate. Sudden 

 and stark temperature differences often cause rainfall and 

 sunny weather within a small area, he elaborated.

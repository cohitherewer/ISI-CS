The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Other side of love

 MAKRAND DESHPANDE is back with the final act of the trilogy aimed at moving the audience emotionally, says Sebanti Sarkar

 Sequel saga: Makrand Deshpande

 From plays that have been branded bizarre ?trips?, dramatist Makrand Deshpande seems to have finally succeeded in winning mainstream acceptance with Sir Sir Sarala III, that opened at Prithvi theatre.

 Seldom has there been so much speculation about a play?s sequel as there has been with this trilogy ? Sir Sir Sarala I, II and now III. ?This had started as an attempt to reach a wider audience, therefore love was chosen as a theme with an almost universal appeal,? Makrand told Metro between rehearsals in Mumbai.

 Better known for screen roles in Swades (the fakir in Yoonhi chala chal), Satya, Jungle, Company, Road and Makdee, Makrand has also directed offbeat films like Danav. But his first love has remained the stage.

 A prolific writer with over 19 scripts to his credit, Makrand has in the past wowed the Prithvi audience with innovative plays like Laila, Kasturi and Basant Ka Teesra Yauvan, all performed by his Ansh Theatre Group.

 Aiming primarily ?to move the audience emotionally and give them a new experience?, Makrand?s says: ?This medium is so strong that it forces people to stay and watch. After all, for how long would anyone read a novel at one go? And for these many hours the audience sharing the experience still remain individuals with their own pasts, presents and futures.?

 Sir Sir Sarala I and II, staged in Mumbai and Delhi in 2005, have been declared ?super hits?. The first part begins with the reunion of a professor of English (played by Makrand) and his three students Sarala (Sonali Kulkarni), Fanidhar (Anurag Kashyap) and Keshav (Abhimanyu Singh).

 Meeting after five years to work on a project on love, they are all reminded of their own individual passions. Sarala is married to Keshav, as the professor had advised, but neither Sir nor Fanidhar has been able to get over her. The first part ends with Sarala expecting a child.

 Makrand felt a sequel was necessary to see what happens afterwards, ?how the characters develop?. Part II begins seven years later. Sir has retired and Fanidhar is a professor. Sarala, now a mother, has divorced Keshav and also attempted suicide. In short, as Makrand put it, ?Life is not poetry any more? The characters face harsh reality, there is fear and violence.? 

 Known for his literary skills, Makrand deliberately uses a lot of Mukti Bodh poetry in the first part. But in the second he uses prose with excerpts from the dialogues of the female characters in Vijay Tendulkar plays.

 No exit

 If the second part shows the ?problems and tragic consequences of Sir?s decision,? Part III deals with what happens when Fanidhar rejects Sir?s ideologies. The location, which had earlier been restricted to the Professor?s house, is now the college campus. When Fanidhar decides to marry one of his students Gauri (Nivedita Bhattacharya) there is a furore and a strike in college. Political agencies move in and Fanidhar suddenly realises that he had become a tool.

 According to Makrand, ?he now has to decide not only whether he should or should not wear a designer suit, he has to decide whether he is marrying to prove a point or because he is really in love with Gauri. Because if it is only to prove his professor wrong his effort is a failure anyway.?

 There are many layers to it and much of Tagore?s poetry. ?The play ends with the realisation that love happens and if it hasn?t, you cannot rebel. But once it has happened, even if it is over, there is never an exit.?

 But why is Sonali no longer part of the play? ?Sarala is in New York, she has been through a lot and won over life. Part III focuses more on the male characters and the question of whether one generation of students can live up to their teacher?s ideals? which is why there are two Sirs in the title, apart from the phonetic impact.?

 Will there be a Part IV? ?No, this is over. I am writing another play, which I think will be a musical.?

 The title? ?Single Sangita.?

 About? ?Love.?

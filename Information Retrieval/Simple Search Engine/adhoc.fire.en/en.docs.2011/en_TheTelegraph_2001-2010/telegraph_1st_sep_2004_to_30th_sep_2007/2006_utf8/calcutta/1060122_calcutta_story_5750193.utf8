The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Nurpur

 The condition of National Highway 6 was great till we reached Bagnan, 64 km from Calcutta. But the 24 more kilometres to Gadiara were the usual Bengal roads ? poorly maintained and riddled with potholes, just like any north Calcutta stretch.

 But as we checked into Rupnarayan Tourist Lodge, almost at the confluence of the Hooghly and the Rupnarayan, the tortuous last leg of the journey was quickly forgotten. Leaving our backpacks in our rooms, we trekked down to the river.

 The lush greenery of rural Bengal unfolded before us as we approached the confluence. We hired a boat to take us to Nurpur, in South 24-Parganas. The boatrides to and from the village were the most prized moments of our weekend trip.

 The afternoon sun had added a glint to the lethargic flow of the river waters. Country boats fitted with engines, locally known as bhatbhatis, were plying up and down, while fishermen had parked their vessels near the banks and were patiently awaiting high tide. Tourists were out on pleasure trips on boats.

 Gadiara was beautiful but slightly crowded, while Nurpur was serene, almost lonely. Large ships plying down the river towards Calcutta port sometimes halt by the village.

 The lighthouse here stands witness to a past when the pirates fought the advancing British. To us, Nurpur appeared a part of rural Bengal that hadn?t yet lost its innocence.

 The ride back was even more memorable. We came across quite a few fishermen?s boats. They were returning with the day?s catch. Soon, the sun was going down over the river in all its glory, turning the water orange. Even the boatmen stopped rowing to drown in the beauty.

 An eagle was circling overhead and a large flock of ducks flew past us towards their shelter for the night. The paddy fields looked almost magical in the fading glow of the sun. During an evening on the Hooghly, we had found the solitude that we were craving for since we left the city. 

 The next morning, we decided to take a boat to Geonkhali. A handful of weekend tourists was enjoying a quiet day there. The lunch we had at Triveni Tourist Complex, run by Haldia Development Authority, was by far the best we had on the trip. At Geonkhali, too, there?s not much to do except enjoy the greenery. 

 Back at Gadiara, we had a few hours to kill before heading for the city. So we went down to the riverfront. It was low tide and the water had receded to reveal the ruins of Fort Mornington or Clive Saheber Durgo.

 Unfortunately, there is nothing much left of the fort for the tourists to see after the floods of 1942 had devastated it.

 On our way down to the Gadiara market, we met a few local people. Their propensity to talk politics took us by surprise.

 After a fish and rice lunch at the lodge it was time to drive back to the metropolis that we had left so far behind in our minds for two days.

 Going 

 Drive down National Highway 6. At Bagnan, take a right turn for Gadiara. If you prefer rail, take a local train to Bagnan and then hire a vehicle to Gadiara. You can also take CTC and CSTC buses from Esplanade to Gadiara, from where boats leave for Nurpur

 Staying 

 There rsquo;s no place to stay at Nurpur. At Gadiara, your best bet is the Rupnarayan Tourist Lodge, run by the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation. Room rates vary from Rs 200 to Rs 500 per night. There are private hotels, too. Those who want to spend a night at Geonkhali can stay at Triveni Sangam Tourist Complex. Charges vary from Rs 300 to Rs 1,200 a night

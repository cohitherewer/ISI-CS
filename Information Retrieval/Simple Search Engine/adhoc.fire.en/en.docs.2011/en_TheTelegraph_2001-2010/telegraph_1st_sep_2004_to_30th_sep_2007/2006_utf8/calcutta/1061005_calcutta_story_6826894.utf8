 A bit of Bangladesh will come alive from the pages of Monica Alis Brick Lane next weekend, off the EM Bypass.

 Tannishtha Chatterjee plays protagonist Nazneen, a first-generation Bangladeshi immigrant who leads a claustrophobic life in Londons Brick Lane, in this film adaptation of Alis bestselling debut novel. Bollywood actor Satish Kaushik is Nazneens much-older husband Chanu.

 The British production had run into a row in London this August, with a group of Bangladeshis protesting the films content, forcing the base to be shifted from Brick Lane to Chapel Street.

 And so, a slice of Bangladeshi life will be recreated in Calcutta, a short distance from the Parama Island roundabout, instead of the outskirts of Dhaka.

 After wrapping up the London shoot by Friday, director Sarah Gavron and her core team, comprising cinematographer, set designer and sound technician, will be coming down for two weeks of filming. They will capture Nazneens early years in Bangladesh with a Calcutta cast.

 We will shoot Nazneens childhood and the story about her mother. Bangladesh possibly doesnt have the infrastructure to support the shooting, so we are trying to create the feel in Bengal, the films associate director Sangeeta Datta told Metro from London.

 The crew scouted locations in Birbhum and South 24-Parganas, before deciding on the semi-rural setting off the Bypass. A mosque and a marketplace will be created to give the feel of a Muslim village. That apart, we will make do with whatever is available, like the paddy fields and waterbodies. We will also shoot in Pailan, for which Tannishtha will possibly come down for a day. Theres a crucial helicopter shot in the script for which we may have to use the helipad of ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, added Datta.

 The British team has chosen theatre actors Bidyut De and Dola Chakraborty to play Nazneens parents. Bidyut has done minor roles in Rituparno Ghoshs Antarmahal and the yet-to-release Khela.

 Dola, who plays the mother, appeared as Soha Ali Khans personal maid in Antarmahal and as Prosenjits nurse in Dosor. 

 The director, Sarah, had met me in Calcutta and discussed the role of Nazneens mother. Later, I was told that I had been selected, said Dola.

 Of the two children, young Nazneen has been finalised. We have screened around 50 children, said a Calcutta-based documentary film-maker helping with the casting. 

 But the crew plans to look around a little more before casting Nazneens sister Hasina.

 Our criterion for casting child Nazneen was resemblance with Tannishtha. We will take a day or two to finalise Hasina. After that, we will have a two-day workshop from October 11. We start shooting from October 14, said Datta, a London-based film-maker who has helped with the research and scripting of Brick Lane.

 The London team will be assisted by a bunch of local technicians, mostly from Rituparnos team. 

 The sets will be supervised by art director Indranil Ghosh, known for his work in Chokher Bali and Antarmahal.

 Post-production begins in November, when the soundtrack will also be composed. I am trying to persuade Sarah to try Indo-western musicians like Talveen Singh, added Datta, who assisted Rituparno in Chokher Bali, Raincoat and Antarmahal.

 While Tannishtha will return to the city where she starred in the shoot of Florian Gallenbergers Shadows of Time three years ago, the Brick Lane schedule comes to town just over a year after Mira Nairs filming of Jhumpa Lahiris The Namesake.

Life

 Being who I 

 want to be, for free

 Its in a shopping 

 mall that Chandrima S. Bhattacharya can act 

 out her fantasies

 SEX 

 amp; THE CITY

 I find myself in a shopping mall. 

 Its a little kinky ? but thats where I have 

 learnt to act out my fantasies.

 I can never pass a shopping mall 

 without stepping into it. I know why Ulysses had to chain 

 himself to the mast of his ship while the Sirens called. 

 But I wouldnt ever strap myself to the sides of the 

 taxi or ricocheting auto in which I usually am, because 

 I want to go. 

 Into the shimmering mall that 

 rises before my eyes, since thats where I can be who 

 I really am inside. For free. Even if it means tricking 

 people a little.

 I have perfected this little art 

 of living through long practice.

 In a sprawling mall, the first 

 stop is the perfume counter. I want a fragrance that 

 is flowery, I say. They are only too happy to serve 

 me.

 They ask for my hand ? I unfold 

 it, I imagine, like a swan stretching out its slender white 

 neck. They take out a vial and spray its contents generously 

 on my wrist and rub it softly in. I smell it. It fills my 

 senses.

 But they will not stop. Out comes 

 the next glass vial. It has a hint of hyacinth, they say. 

 Little beads of perfume glisten on my wrist ? I must smell 

 the coffee beans.

 They take out more bottled splendours 

 and arrange them in a neat row. They pluck out some sharp 

 paper strips from somewhere, soak them in the perfumes and 

 offer them one by one to me. Flowery, 

 feathery, fairy little affairs. I feel giddy. All the perfumes 

 of Arabia? 

 I tell them that the brand my 

 friend really likes is not there and move on. 

 I linger at the cosmetics counter. 

 But I like shampoos best. They have the most evocative names. 

 I am seduced by a slim, elegant, tapering-at-the-waist bottle 

 containing the purest powder-blue translucent liquid.

 Gift of nature, it says. Honeysuckle 

 and Aloe Vera. Naturally moisturises and strengthens hair. 

 No, this is the essence of feminine mystique, distilled 

 in a bottle. I touch it lightly, lovingly, and move on.

 How would it be if I was trapped 

 forever here? Is even a lifetime enough?

 I am in the clothes section. It 

 holds out the greatest promise. From one clothes rack I 

 pick up two tops. One a dark blue spaghetti strap, the other, 

 a lilac one, so soft to the touch that it reminds you of 

 a baby. 

 I am unobtrusive, but the two 

 male attendants look at me a little funnily. Should a woman 

 in a baggy shirt and jeans do this? Do I dare disturb the 

 universe? Yes.

 I go to the next rack and pick 

 up the short black cocktail dress and march towards the 

 trial room. I am stopped by the woman attendant. I can only 

 take two items at a time. I take the two tops first.

 I try the dark blue one first. 

 It fits snugly cutting into my shoulders. There is a zari 

 band round the waist that tapers off delicately, giving 

 me a waist-hip ratio that was only there in my dreams. If 

 I wore this to a nightclub anywhere, I wouldnt feel 

 apologetic.

 I try on the lilac top. It hangs 

 from my shoulder daintily, a mass of soft crushed fabric, 

 with a large, many-petalled rose of the same stuff dangling 

 at the breast. 

 It is a lush rose. It is a lyrical 

 outburst of great poetic power. I just need some flowers 

 in my hair. I am the hyacinth girl.

 I return the two tops to the attendant 

 and try on my li black dress. 

 The front is simple. It is a short, 

 structured number, with a deep neckline countered by an 

 asymmetrical hemline, with the shoulder straps going up 

 smartly at a halter-neck angle. 

 But the back is another story, 

 complex, rich, a little evil. The straps from the front 

 go down to become knotted and crossed with each other and 

 knotted up again in a wicked filigree, an excess of sex, 

 beauty and torture that can only bring to mind Sharon Stone.

 I close my eyes and put it on. 

 I pull myself up to my full height and stand on my toes, 

 too. 

 I look at the mirror. My reflection 

 peers down at me. I am deadly, gorgeous. I am deadly gorgeous. 

 I am Sharon Stone. 

 I slip into my old clothes and 

 come out and return the dress to the attendant. But she 

 seems to have found me out. She will not let me go without 

 an explanation. The neckline was too deep, I 

 tell her. 

 I come out and sit down on the 

 stairs. I buy a chocolate truffle pastry and feel its goodness 

 oozing into my mouth. I cry a little. Eventually I take 

 a taxi back to work.

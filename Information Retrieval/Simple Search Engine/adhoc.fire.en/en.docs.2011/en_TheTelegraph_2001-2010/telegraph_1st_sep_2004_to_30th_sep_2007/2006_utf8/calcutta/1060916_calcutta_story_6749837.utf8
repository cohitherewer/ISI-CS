 Understanding Tagore

 The enduring relevance and universal quality of Tagores works make us feel his ubiquitous presence in our daily lives. His creations and philosophy have enriched the consciousness, ideas and sensitivities of future generations of poets, who themselves seek inspiration from him. Often, in writing or in conversation, they have expressed their abstract perceptions of Tagore, who is the spring of their art and creative vision. Aamar Ekla Bnashi, which invokes Tagore through a classical expression of his lyrical creations, also attempts to help us gain valuable insight into Tagores genius through the responses of some of the great minds of our times. Featuring readings from Joy Goswamis Nijer Rabindranath (a personal reminiscence of Tagore), Pagol Je Tui and his own poetry, readings from essays and autobiographical writings by Soumitra Chattopadhyay and Tagore songs by Joyshree Dasgupta, Sreenanda Mukhopadhyay, Shekhar Gupta, Rahul Mitra, Lopamudra Bhattacharya and Sudeshna Mitra. Concept: Rahul Mitra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Six-month course in cyber law

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Information Technology Act was passed in 2000 but since then, little awareness has been created about cyber crime, both among victims and those entrusted with the responsibility of tackling it.

 In an attempt to fill this gap, Global School of Tech Juris, an institute formed by budding lawyers and computer experts, was launched on Friday with a six-month cyber law training programme.

 ?The knowledge of cyber crime has become essential for everyone? from students to lawyers, government officers to police,? said Misum Hossain, who devised the programme and is heading the institute.

 The programme will be of six months? duration and will cost Rs 8,000. ?We plan to start classes in June with 100 students in batches of 30,? Hossain said. The school, however, is not opting for any affiliation. ?We want to establish ourselves as an affiliating body in this area,? Hossain added. Those with 10+2 qualification are eligible for the course.

 Justice Altamas Kabir was present at the Friday launch of the school. ?This is one of the first endeavours to set up an institute and fulfil a need that we have,? Kabir said. ?As a Calcutta High Court judge, I looked after computerisation of the high court and the district courts. Initially, I thought it would be tough, as I didn?t know the ABC of computers or the IT Act, but soon I realised how important this knowledge would become for the judiciary,? Kabir added.

 At the launch, Hossain, who holds a degree in law with business studies from UK, explained the various aspects of cyber crime. ?Such crime happens not because cyber criminals are very smart but because we are not aware and are indifferent in our surfing habits,? Hossain explained.

 As instances of cyber crime, he cited cases like the Delhi Public School MMS clip and the Pune and Delhi BPO frauds. ?Often, we send an obscene SMS/MMS for a laugh to friends. But these might land you in jail for up to five years,? Hossain cautioned. Areas like phishing, credit card theft and hacking were also discussed.

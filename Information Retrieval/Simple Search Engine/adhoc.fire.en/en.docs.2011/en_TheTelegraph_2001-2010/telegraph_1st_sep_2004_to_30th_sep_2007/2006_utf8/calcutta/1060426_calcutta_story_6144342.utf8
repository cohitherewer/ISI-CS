 Discreet vigil by 11-man army 

 Delhi special team activated sources 

 to sniff out most-wanted quarry in unfamiliar terrain 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was a long vigil in a city 

 they were unfamiliar with.

 But the task for the Delhi police?s 

 special team was to track down Sher Singh Rana, main accused 

 in the assassination of Phoolan Devi, who had walked out 

 of Delhi?s high-security Tihar jail in a daring escape, 

 dressed as a policeman. 

 Sniffing around different parts 

 of the country, the trail had led the team to West Bengal 

 and, finally, to Calcutta. But the brief was also to keep 

 the Calcutta police out of the picture, a task that the 

 team from the capital achieved with remarkable ease.

 The groundwork had started last 

 December, when officers from Delhi police had come to the 

 city to carry out a recce. It had taken them to Basirhat, 

 in North 24 Parganas. 

 It was only early this month that 

 some ?concrete? information about the possible arrival of 

 Rana in Calcutta reached the Delhi police and they decided 

 to send their men across.

 The first to arrive was Ranbir 

 Singh Dahiya, an officer of the special team, who reached 

 the city on April 21. The only information he had was that 

 Rana was in Bangladesh and his visa was about to expire. 

 ?We had definite information 

 that he was coming to Calcutta and that is why we decided 

 that we would set up a vigil for him and wait till he appeared 

 on the scene,? said Karnal Singh, joint commissioner of 

 Delhi police?s special cell. 

 ?We also had information that 

 he would be staying in a hotel in central Calcutta. It was 

 not an easy task, but let us say that we were helped by 

 certain people who were passing on information to us. It 

 is not possible to reveal anything further,? he added.

 Dahiya checked into a hotel on 

 Sudder Street, but did not mention any address or telephone 

 number in the register. Then, he activated his contacts 

 and the search began. 

 But the task was simply too much 

 for him alone and two days later, he was joined by two other 

 officers, Surinder Kumar and Satyabir Singh. 

 They checked into the same hotel 

 and maintained the same anonymity. Only, in the address 

 space in the hotel register, they added the words Lodhi 

 Colony.

 The trio then found out ? again 

 from their sources ? that Rana had arrived in the city and 

 was using a satellite phone. With the help of the telecom 

 authorities, they learnt that Rana was in the Dharamtala 

 area. 

 ?Being unfamiliar with the city, 

 it was difficult for them to go about tracking hotels and 

 positions,? said a senior officer of Delhi police. 

 So, the team in Calcutta once 

 again contacted their bosses in Delhi, saying that the ?Dharamtala 

 area? was proving too big for them and requested reinforcements. 

 On Sunday, eight other officers 

 arrived. The search narrowed down and on Monday evening, 

 the Delhi police found their quarry in a phone booth near 

 Metro cinema.

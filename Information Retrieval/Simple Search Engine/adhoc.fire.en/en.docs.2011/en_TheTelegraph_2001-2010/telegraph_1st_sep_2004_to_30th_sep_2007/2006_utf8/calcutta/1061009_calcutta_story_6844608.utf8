 Calcutta Police has joined hands with its counterparts in North and South 24-Parganas to ensure that 24x7 Sector V is not affected by the 12-hour Bengal bandh on Monday. 

 Special forces will be deployed in and around the tech township to allow easy movement of the industry staff. The men in uniform will be stationed on the citys border with North 24-Parganas, particularly along EM Bypass. There will also be men on stand-by. 

 A cell has been set up at Bidhannagar (North) police station exclusively to help IT professionals impeded by the bandh. Police pickets will be posted at five important intersections in Sector V. Even processions will not be allowed in the area. 

 We had rounds of discussion with police from North and South 24-Parganas to work out a plan for movement of IT workers. A blueprint has been prepared. If anyone seeks our help to reach office, well help him, promised city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 On Sunday, Mukherjee met senior cops, including the divisional commissioners, at the Lalbazar police headquarters and reviewed the arrangements for the bandh. Besides discussing the general situation, the top cop issued specific instructions to ensure that the IT industry staff did not encounter any resistance on their way to office. 

 We have held meetings with representatives of at least 40 IT companies over the bandh, claimed North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.

 In the city, more than 5,000 policemen will try to tackle the bandh. Over a hundred pickets will be set up across Calcutta and special forces will be posted outside government offices. Seventy wireless vans will do the rounds from 5 am.

 Arrangements have been made to prevent markets from being forcibly shut down. More police will be deployed on the road and outside Metro stations.

What: The Durian Society Interior Design Awards. 

 Where: The Hyatt Regency. 

 When: Saturday, 8 pm onwards. 

 E-quotient: With star performers like Perizaad Zorabian, Mahima Choudhary and Sangeeta Ghosh, the glamour factor got hotter by the minute. The show that kick-started with TV item girl Sangeeta Ghosh dancing to the latest chart-toppers progressed to a performance by Bangla band Cactus belting out popular Bengali and Hindi numbers. The show reached a different level when the vivacious Perizaad Zorabian took centre stage. What followed was an electrifying medley of three songs, Habba habba, Right Here Right Now and Ek ajnabee. Her on-stage antics were marked by characteristic energy, as she effortlessly moved from one dance genre to another, with a baseball cap perched atop her head. 

 It was then the turn of Pardes girl Mahima Choudhary to regale the audience. Her act was the grand finale of the show, with an edited mix of the songs Aaja mahi, Deedar de and Dhoom. Looking ravishing in a black and silver outfit, Mahimas jhatkas and matkas went down well with the ensemble crowd. 

 Sip bite: A well-stocked bar that served everything from good wines to scotch saw a very busy evening. The dinner spread comprised perennial Indian favourites like Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Mustard Fish, Chicken Butter Masala, Spinach and Corn served with Vegetable Biryani and a variety of breads. 

 Faces in the crowd: Arjun Chakraborty, Bhaichung Bhutia, Sharbari Datta, Bikram Ghosh and wife Jaya were spotted in the audience, adding glamour to the event.

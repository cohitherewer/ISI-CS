 Ten months of careful whispers later, word is now out. Sir RN Mookerjees house at 7 Ho Chi Minh Sarani (opposite 22 Camac Street) is set to be conserved as Calcuttas first boutique-heritage hotel.

 Lady Ranus residence as the address is popularly called will be restored and revived by the Singapore-based Wellside Group of Companies.

 The budget is over Rs 200 crore, the brief is a blend of the best of boutique and heritage hotels, and the timeline is 18 months from the final government go-ahead.

 This is going to be Calcuttas first restoration project proposed to be conserved as a heritage hotel. It is the best heritage city in the country and the venture can be a model project for property owners and developers here. Also, it is my way of giving something back to the city I was born and brought up in, says Aditya Poddar, chairman of Wellside, the largest exporter of plantation teakwood from Latin America, now investing in Indian infrastructure.

 The four levels spread over an acre will see intense restoration while retaining its original glory. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, while confirming that the property had passed on to an NRI from Singapore, said: We will ensure that the heritage aspect is kept intact.

 While ownership of the hotel will stay with Wellside, luxury brands like Starwood and Hyatt are being explored for a tie-up. Several options were thrown up once we acquired the property. We wanted to be open to public, yet be exclusive. We also wanted the venture to be economically sustainable and so the idea of a boutique-heritage hotel, explains Poddar.

 The project will be handled by Arc Studio, a Singapore-based architect firm that is a breakaway group of RSP Consultants.

 Arc Studio understands the value of heritage and how to conserve. No firm in Calcutta came even close, reveals Poddar.

 While final details on food and beverage, spa, rooms and rates have not been decided, each room is sure to tell a story from pages of the past.

 The lobby, too, promises to feel like a living museum, flaunting the houses original artefacts. 

 Wellside Group of Companies owns and operates plantations in seven Latin American countries. It has been responsible for bringing Ascenda Singapore to Calcutta for information technology projects.

 The civic body, in its drive to create more parking space in downtown Calcutta, has made it clear to Wellside that it must not only ensure enough parking space on its premises for visitors to the hotel but also make special provisions for space to be let out for commercial parking off congested Camac Street.

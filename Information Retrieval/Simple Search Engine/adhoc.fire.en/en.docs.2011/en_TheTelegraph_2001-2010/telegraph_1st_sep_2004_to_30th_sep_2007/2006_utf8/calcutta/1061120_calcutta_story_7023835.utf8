The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Rail prey of politics

 Aroop Biswas, Trinamul 

 Congress MLA and chairman of Borough X, met readers of The 

 Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included 

 Atanu Mukherjee, Radha Kanta Mukherjee, Tapan Dasgupta, 

 Anil Sinha, Mohd Kasem, Narayan Chakraborty, Dilip Halder, 

 Suprabhat Banerjee, Mohd Alamutullah Gazi, Ashok Basu, Narayan 

 Chakraborty and Anil Sinha

Suprabhat Banerjee: The extension work of the Metro Railway has come to a halt. Do you think the work is being delayed as Mamata Banerjee is no longer the Union railway minister? People living in the four wards (97-100) of Tollygunge are suffering during the monsoon because of the incomplete work.

 I am aware that people are suffering due to the incomplete Metro Rail work. Sewage and drainage water have flooded many houses during the monsoon. I think now you will realise that our Didi is not just a woman of words but has done excellent work in many areas, too. 

 It is the central government, as well as the state government, which lack interest and initiative towards the project. They are making it a political issue. 

 You must understand a simple political equation. The Trinamul Congress is the only anti-Left force in the state. The UPA government is being pressured by the Left parties not to help us in any way. Therefore, the project is suffering.

Mohd Kasem: The 150-year-old burial ground on Prince Anwar Shah Road is in a shambles. The burial ground caters to more than seven lakh people living in different parts of South 24-Parganas. More than three cottahs of land have been swallowed by weeds. Please help us to clean up the mess.

 You will be glad to know that Mamata Banerjee has allotted Rs 15 lakh for reconstructing the burial ground. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will take up the revamp work.

Ashok Basu: Local realtors in Tollygunge have been eyeing the Pachapukur math for a construction project for quite some time. The plot was formed in 1982 by filling up a waterbody. During the 80s, the realtors could not take up any construction project due to resistance from the adjacent Kalabagan bustee. 

But recently, a housing cooperative has been formed. Promoters are measuring the plot in an attempt to start work. Will you please look into the matter and see that the land sharks cannot get their project sanctioned from the CMC?

 In the present CPM raj, the chief minister and his cabinet ministers are selling private land by illegal means. A mass movement alone can stop this nuisance.

 I would like to point out that any construction project is cleared after verifying various factors, like title rights, character of the plot, etc. If there is no dispute over the title rights and the character of the plot, the CMC will at once sanction the construction project.

Dilip Halder: Owing to heavy flow of traffic on Tollygunge Circular Road between Tollygunge Phari and Taratala, office-goers and students are facing a lot of problems in crossing the road. The stretch is busy throughout the day and is quite accident-prone. The traffic situation has further worsened as there is no coordination between the Calcutta Police and the district police. Can you take some steps to improve the situation? 

 During the last Assembly session, I brought up this matter before the government. I personally think that the problem cannot be rectified at Mahabirtala junction until Chetla Road and BL Shah Road are made one-way. 

Many shop-owners and businessmen are encroaching on the footpaths and roads in the Azadgarh, Grahams Road and Ashoknagar areas, near Tollygunge tram depot. They are using the footpaths for storing their stone chips, sand and bricks. Pedestrians are facing a lot of problems. Have you noticed this?

 I admit that a section of businessmen are using the roads and footpaths to store their stock. But I ask you, where will they go? It is the question of their bread and butter.

Narayan Chakraborty: The Jhilmil slum area is a hub for gamblers and drunkards. The entire area is living in constant fear. Please help.

 Most of these people are either daily labourers or rickshaw-pullers. If 1.5 lakh factories are closed, where will they go? Employ them and you wont see them around your house. 

Anil Sinha: Madartala Jheel is being encroached on by mushrooming shanties. Can you do something?

 It 

 belongs to the Calcutta Improvement Trust. The trust has not 

 transferred the waterbody to the CMC.

 Concluded

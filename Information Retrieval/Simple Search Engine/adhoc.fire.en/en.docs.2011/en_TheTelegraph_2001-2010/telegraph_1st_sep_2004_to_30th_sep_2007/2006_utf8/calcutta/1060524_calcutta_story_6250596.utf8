 Two types of autonomy work abroad. In one, all decisions are taken by the college. There is only a body to monitor standards. In the other, the exams are conducted by the college but the degree is awarded by a university. Complete autonomy is not feasible in Bengal because people will not accept it. The liberal autonomy policy in south India has failed as their college degrees lack credibility. We need a supervising body for standardisation of the courses so that their credibility does not get diluted. Here the higher education council itself can pay a crucial role.

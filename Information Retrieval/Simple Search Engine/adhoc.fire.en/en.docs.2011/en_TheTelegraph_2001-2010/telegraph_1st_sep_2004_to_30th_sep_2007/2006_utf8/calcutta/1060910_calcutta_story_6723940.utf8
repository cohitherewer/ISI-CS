Console Call 

The magic sound of lounge mesmerises and de-stresses at the same time, says DJ 

Girish

If a DJ changed your life last night with something 

he spun on the decks, if you were totally mesmerised and de-stressed, then maybe 

its time you embarked on a journey of exploring the sound and genre that 

is parallel and contemporary compared to the sounds flowing out of every nightclub.

 Guests at Shisha, the lounge that popularised 

this genre of music in the city

I want to highlight the sound of lounge music, which 

has now become a household trend and sure has a calming effect on its followers 

and listeners. 

This genre comprises everything from world music to 

the sound of panpipes, also ranging from down-tempo drum and bass to the 

up-tempo tabla and percussion. Imagination and variety in lounge has no boundaries.

The most popular chill-out sounds one comes across 

all the time are that of Buddha Bar. For many, lounge music starts and ends with 

that. Buddha Bar is a lounge bar in Paris that introduced the trend across the 

globe, with a powerhouse back-up of its resident DJ Ravin who has compiled Buddha 

Bar CDs and essential selections and has made this concept popular worldwide.

Talking about lounge music, there is a whole platter 

to choose from. Artistes like Talvin Singh, Karunesh, Badmarsh, 

Karsh Kale to name a few, are really big names in this genre. We have our 

very own Delhi-based outfits like Medival Punditz and the Bandish Projekt 

going international as well. 

I was surprised to see our very own Bickram Ghosh 

on international lounge compilations. These guys are doing some amazing world 

sounds and are being accepted globally.

Taking a tour of lounge bars in Bangkok and Singapore 

recently, I noticed the same trend that I maintain here at the Shisha Bar in Calcutta. 

DJs there play uplifting, beach house and soulful house at lounge sessions.

Back home, I spin a whole set thrice a week of the 

above-mentioned genres and I have a set of followers who are there to listen to 

those sounds before we go commercial. Well, this is exactly what I plan to do 

in my sets when I am spinning at the Shisha in Singapore as well.

Some lounge tracks have Vedic chants and shlokas 

from the Mahabharata fused with the beats. The most amazing one that I 

spun recently was Midnite on 27th street. Its the new dark sound 

of lounge and was very well taken by the crowd. It has got recitals from the Quran 

that make the sound really enchanting compared to the sound of Arabic lounge, 

which has a lot of vocals and a happier feel.

Some of my favourite lounge compilations are Cafe 

del mar, Brazilian lounge, Cafe Arabia and the Hed Kandi beach lounge 

sessions.

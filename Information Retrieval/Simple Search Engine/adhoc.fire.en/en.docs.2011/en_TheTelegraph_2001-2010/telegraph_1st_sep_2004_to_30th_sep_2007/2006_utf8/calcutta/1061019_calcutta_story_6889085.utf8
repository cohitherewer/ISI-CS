The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Briefs

 Three 

 armed dacoits tried to rob a house in Picnic Garden on Wednesday 

 morning. Police said the trio, posing as representatives of 

 a private company, went to Mita Banerjees home in Deb Banerjee 

 Lane when she was alone. As the 45-year-old housewife opened 

 the door, one of them grabbed her throat and the others tried 

 to move in. The woman resisted their attempt and alerted neighbours, 

 who caught two of the dacoits and handed them over to police. 

 The taxi in which the dacoits came was impounded and its driver 

 and cleaner were arrested. Police have urged people to check 

 the identity proof of those who claim to represent various 

 companies. 

 Calcutta 

 Universitys manuscript library department has come across 

 over 13,000 identified manuscripts in Calcutta. Researchers 

 will benefit from the manuscripts handed over to us by organisations 

 and individuals, vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee said 

 on Wednesday. The university, during a state-wide survey, 

 has found around 1,050 manuscripts in Nadia. 

 Training 

 and Advanced Studies in Management and Communications Ltd 

 (TASMAC) is entering into a partnership with the University 

 of Greenwich to offer postgraduate degrees in computer science 

 and software engineering.

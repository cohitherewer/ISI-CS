 Cricket to pitched battle 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 At least eight people, including two policemen, were seriously hurt and several others received minor injuries in a pitched battle between two groups of people in Narkeldanga over a game of cricket being played in front of Momin High School on Wednesday afternoon.

 Trouble erupted after a ball hit a bystander on the approach to Narkeldanga bridge. The man reportedly retaliated by striking the boy with the bat he was playing with. 

 The injured child, 13-year-old Md Jahir, stopped playing and returned home to complain to senior residents of the locality.

 As word spread, people gathered and attacked residents of the neighbourhood to which the man who hit the boy belonged. They brandished swords and burst bombs. 

 Witnesses said a mob of about 20 to 30 swooped on Narkeldanga North Road and hurled bombs, leaving a few injured.

 To avenge the attack, about 35-40 youths from Narkeldanga North Road stormed Maulana Abdul Kalam Sarani, on the opposite side across the bridge, and threw bombs and sodawater bottles, damaging two parked motorcycles.

 The fight continued for over an hour, prompting teams from three police stations, including Narkeldanga, to rush to the spot and Lalbazar to send additional forces.

 Two Heavy Radio Flying Squads and a mobile unit were despatched to control the situation. 

 Traffic was held up along Narkeldanga Main Road for over 30 minutes. Caught in the crossfire, a few policemen were injured.

 ?It was sparked by a minor issue that later snowballed into a clash. Police have been deployed in both neighbourhoods and we?ve decided to keep a vigil all night,? said B.K. Saha, assistant commissioner of police.

 Local people were taken aback by this show of strength by both groups before the elections. Both sides seemed to be more interested in brandishing the weapons they carried. ?People walked around with single-shooters, swords and hockey sticks, while others barged into houses threatening women and hitting seniors. We just dread the days ahead,? said Naushad Alam, a resident of Maulana Abdul Kalam Sarani.

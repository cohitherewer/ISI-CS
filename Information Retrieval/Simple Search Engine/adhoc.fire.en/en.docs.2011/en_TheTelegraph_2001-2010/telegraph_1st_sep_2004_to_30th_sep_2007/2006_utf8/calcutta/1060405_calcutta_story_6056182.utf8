 By virtue of their superior sensitivity, artists are naturally invested with the ability to express ideas, opinions and concepts that have universal relevance. The ongoing group exhibition of paintings presents an attempt to re-awaken social consciousness by highlighting the decadence that has taken root in society, threatening to affect every sphere of life. Dipak Kundu?s themes portray the subversion of love into eroticism, while the works of Manik Kandar (one of his paintings appears above), reflect the tragic culmination of love into desolation and loneliness. Malia Bhattacharjee emphasises the importance of man?s communion with nature in an age of alarming apathy towards it. The paintings of Barun Roy deal with man?s futile efforts to break free from the fetters of an onerous existence. Palash Halder?s canvases express an all-consuming greed for power and wealth while Rajat Sen conveys the dissipation of human values and virtues in man?s quest to attain material success.

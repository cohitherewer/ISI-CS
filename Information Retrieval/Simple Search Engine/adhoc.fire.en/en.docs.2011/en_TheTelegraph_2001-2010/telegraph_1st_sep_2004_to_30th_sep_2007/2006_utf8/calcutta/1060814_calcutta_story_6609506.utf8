 On top: Priyanka Chopra

 Edging past other nominees like Kareena Kapoor and Bipasha Basu, Priyanka Chopra has been crowned eBay India Style Diva for the year 2006. The former Miss World, now on the wish list of every top film-maker in tinsel town, won the online poll which saw the two million-strong eBay India community voting right through June and July.

 Priyanka, in turn, announced an opportunity for all Indians to participate in a charity auction and raise funds for the education of the girl child through NGO Nanhi Kali. The Krrish leading lady also donated a unique experience a day on the sets with Priyanka to one lucky buyer on eBay India. 

 I am thrilled that so many people chose me as the eBay Style Diva, said Priyanka. I would like to thank my fans for their support. It feels great to be able to reach out to millions of people over the globe through this exciting platform.

 On the film front, Priyanka has a host of exciting releases including Dharmesh Darshans Aap Ki Khatir, Farhan Akhtars Don and Nikhil Advanis Salaam-e-Ishq.

 Do not disturb: Naseeruddin 

 Shah

 While Karan Johars Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was hogging all the attention, Naseeruddin Shah quietly slipped into town for a two-day shoot for Rituparno Ghoshs Sunglass.

 The Bollywood actor was holed up at Chhatu Babu Latu Babus house on Beadon Street all through Saturday. He plays a curio shop owner in this comedy starring Konkona Sen Sharma, Madhavan, Tota Roy Chowdhury, Raima Sen and Jaya Bachchan.

 Rituparnos comic take on todays life features Konkona as the wife of Madhavan in the Hindi version and of Tota in the Bengali. The film produced by Planman Motion Pictures is being shot simultaneously in Bengali and Hindi.

 The Saturday shoot had Naseeruddin in a sequence with Konkona whom he had directed in his debut feature film Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota. The two will face the camera again for Rituparno in September and when the Sunglass crew hits north Bengal and Sikkim later this year.

 The interiors of a curio shop were erected at the north Calcutta address for the two-day shoot, but the film production team threw a tight security ring around the house as Naseeruddin didnt want to be disturbed on the sets.

 But if his Sunglass stint seems more like a cameo, Naseeruddin will make up with a meaty part in Rituparnos next film with Planman. Titled London Summer, the Hindi film will bring him and Shabana Azmi together after a long time. The contemporary story will have Shabana playing sister-in-law to Naseeruddin and will be shot in London.

 Call Time: A moment from Bombay Calling

 This August, National Geographic Channel presents the changing face of the country through its series Emerging India. The five-part series will premiere on the eve of Independence Day, on Monday, at 10 pm. The series looks at an emergent India coming to terms with its new-found place in the world. 

 It covers topics as diverse as the new call centre generation (Bombay Calling on Tuesday) to computer literacy amongst children (The Hole in the Wall on Monday) to the development of the worlds largest planned city on the outskirts of Mumbai (Mumbai on Friday). 

 Says Joy Bhattacharjya, senior VP of programming, National Geographic Channel India: The series successfully manages to present the fast-track life of an Indian today, a life which sees a complete eradication of earlier conceptions of the country by those in the developed world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bar clarion for apex court arm

 - High court circuit bench in north bengal from september

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Lawyers of Calcutta High Court have yet again urged the Union law ministry to set up a Supreme Court circuit bench in Calcutta to make it easier for litigants in the city to file appeals against high court orders.

 Nearly a decade ago, the Centre had announced that a circuit bench of the apex court would be set up in the city, while a circuit bench of Calcutta High Court would be set up in north Bengal.

 ?The north Bengal circuit bench will start functioning in September, but nothing has been done about the Supreme Court circuit bench in Calcutta,? complained Uttam Majumdar, vice-president of West Bengal Bar Council.

 High court officials stated that a Supreme Court circuit bench in the city could not be thought of ?unless the construction of the third building of the high court is completed?. The court has two buildings ? the old one, dating back to the Raj, and the centenary building. 

 ?Setting up a circuit bench of the apex court here will help litigants. They will not have to rush to Delhi for filing appeals against high court rulings. But we can?t do anything due to shortage of space,? said a senior high court official.

 According to state law ministry sources, four judges of the high court will initially be transferred to the circuit bench in Jalpaiguri for hearing cases from the five districts of north Bengal. ?In the near future, another high court judge will be deputed to north Bengal,? a law department official told Metro.

 The north Bengal circuit bench could not be started earlier because of scarcity of judges in the high court, pointed out officials. Against the sanctioned strength of 50, the court has only 45 judges.

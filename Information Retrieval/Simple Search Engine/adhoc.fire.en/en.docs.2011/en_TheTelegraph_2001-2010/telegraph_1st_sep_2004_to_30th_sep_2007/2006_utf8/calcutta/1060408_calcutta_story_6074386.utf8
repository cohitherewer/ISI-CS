 His blog describes him as ?Mohan Agashe, a Doctor by profession, an Actor by choice?. Identities are an obvious preoccupation with this man of many parts. Even finding reflection in his upcoming theatre production Behind the Mask, which will have Agashe in a solo role and mark his return to the stage after a longish gap.

 ?Behind the Mask will probably premiere in Calcutta this September, courtesy Sanlaap,? said Agashe. The play will be produced by Maharashtra Cultural Centre, which Agashe currently heads.

 ?It is a play about the patient-doctor relationship which is deteriorating daily into a buyer-seller relationship ? where the doctor no longer listens or cares and routinely puts every patient through a series of tests. Even the legal system contributes to this situation by allowing patients to sue his doctor if he fails to detect every illness,? said Agashe, a psychiatrist and founder-director of Institute of Mental Health in Pune.

 Agashe was recently in town to deliver the Utpal Dutt memorial lecture organised by Paschim Banga Natya Akademi. ?We once played brothers in a film, both equally bad. After all we were two good men who excelled in acting bad,? laughed Agashe.

 The event was attended by Sova Sen, Dolly Basu, Ashok Mukhopadhyay and others.

 ?Actors have little say in the scripts or choice of plays and have to struggle inwardly to fit into roles. This turns them into emotional wrecks by the end of their career,? felt Agashe.

 But theatre can also bring amazing mental changes in the audience, he added. ?Process-oriented theatre, where there are separate actors and spectators as everyone wears masks and takes turns to act out different roles, can act as therapy, encouraging the much-needed release of emotions and stress.?

 Though not a practitioner of process-oriented theatre, Agashe claimed that many of his friends in NGOs working with small groups of ?troubled people? have found it to be effective.

 The GRIPS theatre project Agashe had propelled at Prithvi Theatre many years ago has also borne fruit. 

 ?GRIPS is a project from Berlin which calls for a different kind of theatre for children. Instead of fairytales, it offers them realistic insights helping them deal with real-life situations. The project has produced someone like Vibha Deshpande who was just seven when she became involved in GRIPS productions. Today she has written Mum Too, Dad Too, about the pain of a little girl whose parents are about to separate, to be staged at the Prithvi festival,? said Agashe.

 And when in Calcutta, he doesn?t miss a chance to fondly remember how Satyajit Ray had seen his performance as the Machiavellian Nana Phadnavis in the play Ghasiram Kotwal before casting him in Sadgati.

 Meryl Streep: With Brecht 

 on the boards 

 Two-time Oscar winning actress 

 Meryl Streep is returning to theatre this summer with Bertolt 

 Brecht?s Mother Courage, in the New York Shakespeare 

 Festival. The production will run at Public Theatre from 

 August 8 to September 3.

 Brecht?s seminal play which spans 12 years in the Thirty Years War will feature Streep in the title role of a shrewd woman who exploits the war to earn money but ends up causing harm to her children.

 As one by one her children Kattrin, Eilif and Swiss Cheese are taken away by the war, Mother Courage questions the value of honesty, virtue and family in the face of a tough struggle for survival. The production has original music scored by Jeanine Tesori and is directed by George C. Wolfe. It has been by translated Tony Kushner. 

 Alongside her screen career during which she earned 12 Academy Award nominations, the actress is also known for her stagecraft. Mother Courage marks Streep?s return to stage after the 2001 production, The Seagull. Joe Papp?s production of Trelawney of the Wells in the mid-70s had brought her notice and since then Streep went on to enact several challenging roles and bring home a host of awards. She played two characters in one night in Arthur Miller?s The Memory of Two Mondays and Tennessee Williams?s 27 Wagons Full of Cotton. 

 She has won the Outer Critics? Circle Award, the Theatre World Award and earned a Tony nomination too. Her other Broadway and off-Broadway credits include Henry V, Measure for Measure, The Taming of the Shrew, The Cherry Orchard and the musical Alice at the Palace for which she won an Obie award. 

 Dhritiman Chaterji: Pitching for poetry 

 When some Chennai-based theatre enthusiasts put together Dark Horse, little did they think the one-off English production would bind them to a long-term relationship. The successful staging of the play ? written by Gowri Ramnarayan as a tribute to Marathi poet Arun Kolatkar ? across the country has prompted the individuals behind it to form their own theatre troupe, The Just Us Repertory.

 Dark Horse was staged in Calcutta last year as part of the Odeon Theatre Festival and has since been performed at the NCPA, the NSD theatre festival and the Kala Ghoda Festival in Mumbai. Through dialogues, enactment and Carnatic music, the play tries to bring Kolatkar?s poetry alive.

 ?What has happened with so many performances of Dark Horse is that a lot of young people, who didn?t know Kolatkar before, are getting interested in his work. I would love it if someone did something like this with Shakti Chattopadhyay. I feel that, apart from seminars and lectures, this is probably the best way to keep some traditions alive,? says Dhritiman Chaterji, who plays Kolatkar in Dark Horse and is a key member of Just Us.

 The Chennai-based actor who began his career under Satyajit Ray was in town to shoot for a Bengali telefilm. ?I am hoping to do texts in Bengali that I have always loved. That way, one can reach Bengali theatre to a non-Bengali speaking audience too,? adds Chaterji.

 Ramnarayan has written her second play for the newly-formed troupe. Called Rural Phantasy and co-produced by The Madras Players, the play is set in a small village of Thanjavur in 1941, where a woman from Calcutta arrives and brings with her the seeds of reform and a whiff of romance.

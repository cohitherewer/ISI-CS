The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Play it straight, in the V

Veteran film-maker Pedro Almodovar recently 

said that Penelope Cruz has one of the best cleavages in world cinema. GoodLife 

asks a few good men back home to vote for their cleavage queen

Aqeel, DJ

The best cleavage would be Angelina Jolies. Shes hot, shes 

beautiful and shes definitely every mans fantasy. And alas, Brad Pitts 

reality!

Jisshu Sengupta, actor 

I think Bipasha Basu has a very hot cleavage. She has a very dusky, Indian 

appeal and there is no denying that she is Bollywoods sexiest glam girl. 

The other person who has a stunning cleavage is Angelina Jolie.

Sabyasachi Mukherjee, FASHION Designer 

Zeenat Aman, I think, had the best cleavage in the world something that 

was truly epitomised in Satyam Shivam Sundaram. I think Raj Kapoor really 

brought out the best of her in those itsy-bitsy cholis

Aryan Vaid, model 

This is a real tricky topic with more than half of the glam woman population opting 

for silicon implants. But seriously, I think my answer would be Jessica Simpson. 

Firstly, she makes it a point to go out of her way to announce her natural 

assets, so let me give her the benefit of doubt. Secondly, and more importantly, 

because I think she is super-sexy with a perfect cleavage. My other all-time favourite 

cleavage is that of Bo Dereks.

Gaurav, VJ 

Well, when a great man and a greater filmmaker like Pedro Almodovar announces 

that Penelope Cruz has got one of the best cleavages ever, I will only 

more than agree with him. Penelope is sheer perfection and her cleavage is certainly 

no exception. I think she is stunning.

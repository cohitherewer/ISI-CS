The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Functional is the way to be

 He would much rather design a helmet than a pretty dress. He would much rather follow his instincts than any sort of fashion forecast. His bet is on pure functionality and really nothing else.

 Meet fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh, a man whose designs are a replica of his persona plain, simple, neat and fuss-free.

 In town as a jury member for BD Bangur Endowments project Nirmaan at Taj Bengal, Pratap as he is better known in the fashion world spoke to GoodLife about Calcutta, couture and more.

 I love coming to Calcutta on the slightest pretext. I have tonnes and tonnes of friends here, from both school and college and, secondly, I love the food here anything and everything, smiles Pratap.

 This time, he is in town as a judge for Project Nirmaan. A task that Pratap feels is frighteningly tough because the students are all full of dreams and so excited. The responsibility of a judge, he stresses, is huge (as) guiding students in the right direction is essential. Quite different, he says, from his own bad student days in school and college.

 Because I had started working early and had learnt a lot through my stints in export houses and with David Abraham (of Abraham and Thakore), by the time I joined NIFT, I thought I already knew a lot, he recounts.

 And with that began his fashion career. The first-ever piece he made was a white linen jacket and even after 10 years, both the silhouette and the colour remain his favourites. I love jackets and right now I am really pushing bandhgalas. After a sari, its one of the finest garments ever possible, he feels.

 Here are two tips from Pratap on how to get most out of a bandhgala: leave the top few buttons open and keep accessories minimal, maybe just some decorative buttons.

 From bandhgala to Bollywood... so, does the silver screen beckon Pratap? I am doing something for personal reasons but cant tell any more, is the guarded reply, before he explains: Films require a certain level of commitment and I cant give that right now. And moreover, its just not me. 

 Not surprising. Despite a decade well spent in the world of glamour, Pratap seems a most reluctant celebrity.

 I am happy being a tailor. Construction of a garment is what excites me. New designs, new concepts and the technical aspect of an outfit interest me. Functionality counts, nothing else does, he declares.

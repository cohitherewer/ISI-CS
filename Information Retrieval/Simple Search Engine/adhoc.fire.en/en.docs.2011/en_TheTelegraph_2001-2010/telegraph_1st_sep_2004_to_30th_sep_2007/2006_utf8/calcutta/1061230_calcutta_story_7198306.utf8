 The year-end festivities started at St Xaviers Institution, Panihati, as early as December 17 with the two-day annual sports meet. The 40th anniversary celebrations of the school, in association with TTIS, continued till December 21 with a variety of lively events. A panel discussion, titled Songs of Innocence, coordinated by teachers Joyeeta Mukherjee and Rakha Bhattacharya, was first on agenda on December 19. The toddlers danced to nursery rhymes. A fashion show and a mime performance by Jogesh Dutta were big draws of the day.

 The fun and gaiety continued into the second day with parents taking to the stage. Up first was Songs of Experience, a panel discussion on precocious children. After the serious talk, came a break with some popular numbers of the 70s and 80s sung by the students. There was more from the parents though, with them walking the ramp with elan. There were even some pointed questions from the judges to turn it into a true fashion show. The finale was a puppet show by Calcutta Puppet Theatre.

 Day Three started in the same spirit. It was time for the staff to take the stage with the play Lal Kamal and Nil Kamal, written and directed by teacher Arka Mukhopadhyay. 

 The three-day programme wrapped up with a magic show by P.C. Sorcar (junior). Overall, it was a befitting end of an eventful year.

 Phobia funda

 Did you know that people who fear forests actually suffer from hylophobia? Or that conchology refers to the study of marine, fresh-water and land shells? All these and more were easy meat for the youngsters who travelled to Calcutta from across the country for the National Biodiversity Quiz 2006 held on December 22 at the Science City Mini Auditorium.

 The first of its kind to be organised by the National Council of Science Museums, with branches all across the country, the contest saw 16 teams contesting. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya inaugurated the event that was presided over by J.R.B. Alfred, former director of Zoological Survey of India.

 R. Manigandan of Science City said: We began in June with 2,500 schools across the country and about 10,000 students, working our way through the block, district and state levels. There was a written elimination round at 27 science centres, where 16 teams were selected from each zone. The four qualifying teams from each zone made it to the semi-finals at Science City.

 There were eight tough rounds, including direct questions, audio and video questions in the semi-finals. Identifying various phobias comprised a separate round, though some thought it was not a proper subject for a biodiversity quiz, remarked Saumya Khemani, a Class VIII student of Nirmala Convent School, Siliguri. But it was my favourite, she enthused. Although she could not make it to the finals, she feels that participating is more important than winning. It was a lesson in using ones confidence and will power.

 The finals included rapid fire and Know Your India sessions. In a closely fought contest with the team from The Cathedral and John Connon School, Amit Ben Antony and Murtaza Charbiwala from Hasanat High School, Mumbai, emerged winners.

 Amit said: We thought we would be dead today. It was quite unexpected, since most participants were from well-known schools, and ours is a small set-up. We had expected to come second or third, but this was a pleasant surprise.

 The participants, who landed in the city on December 21, were taken sight-seeing on the following day. For Amit, who had been putting up at Chandni Chowk, it was like staying at the nerve centre of the city where you could feel its rhythm.

 State parliamentary affairs and environment minister Sailen Sarkar gave away the trophies.

 Spellings fun

Kaleidoscope Inter-School Spelling Bee competition, organised on December 20 at Gyan Manch, saw 89 students from eight schools participating (picture left by Bishwarup Dutta). MP Birla Foundation, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy and Hartleys High School spelt their way to the state-level finals to be held at Siliguri. Clearing the written test where they had to spell 25 words, the shortlisted candidates proceeded to the oral rounds where clues were provided for recalling the words.

Twin in contrast

In the last instalment of this column I had promised (or threatened) to write about the doppelganger, a German word which literally means ldquo;double-goer rdquo;, but is more commonly understood along the lines of ldquo;evil twin rdquo; or ldquo;alter ego rdquo;. While there is little or no scientific support for the phenomenon, the doppelganger has been a steady fixture in speculative fiction from the 19th century onwards. In its most clich eacute;d form, the doppelganger is an identical twin who creates confusion in the life of the protagonist by eating expensive meals without paying, stealing his girlfriend and so on. Think of Shakespeare rsquo;s Comedy of Errors and countless such variations on the theme of twins sundered at birth and miraculously reunited.

 But in order to experience the full horror of the doppelganger, one has to turn to the 19th century. Two of the most sinister doppelgangers in literature are Edgar Poe rsquo;s William Wilson and Stevenson rsquo;s Jekyll/Hyde duo, along with Oscar Wilde rsquo;s Dorian Gray. But perhaps the most satisfying portrayal of a doppelganger was by the somewhat less famous Adelbert von Chamisso, who in 1814 wrote an utterly charming fable about the unfortunate Peter Schlemihl, the man who sells his shadow to the devil. In exchange, the devil gives him Fortunatus rsquo;s purse, a bottomless wallet which produces an unending stream of gold coins.

When Schlemihl first meets the devil, the latter is a meagre-looking gentleman, who, in the course of an afternoon, produces from his pocket first a telescope, then a twenty-foot Turkish carpet and finally three horses. Soon afterwards, the devil addresses Schlemihl thus: ldquo;During the short time I have had the pleasure to be in your company, I have mdash; permit me, sir, to say mdash; beheld with unspeakable admiration your most beautiful shadow, and remarked the air of noble indifference with which you, at the same time, turn from the glorious picture at your feet, as if disdaining to vouchsafe a glance at it. Excuse the boldness of my proposal; but perhaps you would have no objection to sell me your shadow? rdquo;

Thus begin the travails and travels of Peter Schlemihl, who finds himself an object of pity and horror wherever he goes. He tries to impress his beloved with his wealth but she spurns a man who has no shadow. For in Gothic tales, the shadow is taken to represent the soul, and only demonic creatures like vampires cast no shadow. In desperation, he escapes to the wilderness where he unsuccessfully tries to buy his shadow back from the devil (What does the devil do with shadows, one wonders?). Finally, he embarks on a series of scientific explorations in the company of his faithful servant Bendel and sees the ends of the world. I urge you to read the rest of the wonderful story, which can be found at www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/ptsc10h.htm.

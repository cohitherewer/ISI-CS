 The towering genius of Rabindranath Tagore had, to a large extent, overshadowed the fame of the other great poet and lyricist of Bengal, Kazi Nazrul Islam. Popularly known as the rebel poet, his vast body of romantic lyrics went all but unrecognized in his own time. Nazrul Nana Range, this evening?s presentation of choreographic compositions of the lyrics of Nazrul, attempts to rediscover the depth and range of his musical calibre. Dance portrayals of selected pieces from his lyrical oeuvre enkindle the spark that he had intended to light up in the minds of the people. Based on Kathak style, the dance creations are representative of many of the different genres of songs he had composed. Songs on which the dance items are based include Anjali laho mor, Dola lagilo, Ore neel Jamunar jal, Mor ghumo ghore ele manohar, Mahakaler kole eshe and Brojo gopi khele holi. Concept and choreography: Amita Dutt. Hosted by Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre.

 Event: Nazrul Nana Range, choreographic renditions of the songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Purbasree auditorium, Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

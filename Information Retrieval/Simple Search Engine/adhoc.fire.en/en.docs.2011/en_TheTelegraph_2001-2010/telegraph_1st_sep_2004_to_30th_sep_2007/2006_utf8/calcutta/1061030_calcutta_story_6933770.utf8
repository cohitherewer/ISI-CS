 What are men scared of?

 WONDERS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE REASONS THAT LED MEN TO LAUNCH 

 A PROTEST PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT 

 The first arrest has been made 

 under the domestic violence act. But last week, with the 

 act barely out of Parliament, a group of men went slightly 

 wild. To protect the hallowed institution from the threat 

 of legalised terrorism by women, they launched 

 a protest group called Save the Indian Family. When anyone 

 who has been in touch with contemporary Indian culture knows 

 that nothing can save the Indian family since Rakhi Sawant 

 burst onto the scene and I will not dwell on the word burst 

 in this context.

 A democracy has to allow for all 

 sorts of phenomena and their expression: Rakhi Sawant, Gandhiji 

 T-shirts following his rehabilitation through a film starring 

 a bomb blast accused, the possibility of Navjot Singh Sidhu 

 printing his complete works So why should men who feel 

 that all women are potentially terrorists be stopped from 

 holding their protest march?

 But I was just wondering what 

 made the men feel so threatened. There doesnt seem 

 to be much reason. 

 India is the world capital of 

 legislation it loves to pass acts that will never be implemented. 

 Otherwise the act banning child labour would never have 

 been passed. Without children in our homes, tea stalls, 

 factories and red light areas, the economy will crumble 

 and all foreign journalists will go away.

 The domestic violence act is very 

 welcome and it will be a shot in the arm for many women, 

 but I have a feeling that many more will never know about 

 it. I know a young woman who works as a cook at several 

 houses. She has two children. She was a bright student and 

 her parents her father is a watchman had high hopes 

 for her.

 But she met a dashing young man 

 one day, the chief mason at a nearby building under construction, 

 and fell in love. True, he drank, but love is a great cure 

 for alcohol. So she gave up school to watch him slap the 

 cement on the freshly-laid bricks and never was watching 

 paint dry so much fun. She married him. 

 Now he doesnt work, drinks 

 and drinks and sometimes takes a break to beat her up. The 

 women who read the papers would probably have turned to 

 the law enforcement agencies in her situation, but it is 

 unlikely that she will.

 The act, the men said, brought 

 into being by modern sadists and modern 

 Surpanakhas, would encourage terrorist activity by 

 women. Are the men worried about this girl?

 The men can also take heart from 

 the areas covered by the act. It tries to map the crucial 

 areas of torture marital rape and sexual, physical, verbal 

 and economic violence and in that it is generous. But 

 it leaves out some notoriously unspoken facts about the 

 tortures of living with a man. They can lead to slow death 

 for the woman.

 What happens when every day, after 

 a hectic time at the office, the woman comes and sees the 

 floor strewn with empty plastic bottles, which means that 

 not only she has to put them back, but also fill them with 

 filtered water? Then the wait at the filter? Then to find 

 that an empty pizza box is lying on the bed? To find that 

 the fan had not been switched off, though he left home later 

 and came back earlier? That the clothes are all to be folded, 

 while he watches the recap of how India lost because they 

 played Dhoni at number six? To feel too tired by the end 

 of dinner to give in to his wish of watching a movie together? 

 To have to scream at him, though thats not how it 

 should have been at all? Day after day after day? 

 What is the name of this torture? 

 The Daily Grind? The Lazy Mind? The Thick Hind? Whatever 

 it is, it is again unlikely that many women, though living 

 through this, will report to the police the details of their 

 domestic lives. 

 Then what are the men so scared 

 of? 

 I think the secret is that it 

 takes very little to make men feel scared. Anything that 

 poses a threat to their control of the world makes them 

 tremble. Even the thought of a threat makes them scared. 

 Sometimes they invent the scare, a great big bogey, from 

 nothing, just to assert themselves. Like George Bush Jr. 

 and the Weapons of Mass Destruction.

 It is probably no coincidence 

 that the men who formed the society see the women as terrorists, 

 modern sadists and modern Surpanakhas. 

 They could be talking about Weapons of Mass Destruction 

 too.

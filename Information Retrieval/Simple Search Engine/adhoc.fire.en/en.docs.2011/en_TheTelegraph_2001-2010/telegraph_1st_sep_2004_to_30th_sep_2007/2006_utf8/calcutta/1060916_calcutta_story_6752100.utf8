The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trapped in e-ticket tangle

 - Agent dispute with sub-agent can ground air passenger

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Vikram Ghosh (name changed) was scheduled to fly from Calcutta to Chicago, via London. He had purchased an e-ticket on a British Airways flight last week, from a city-based travel agency. On reaching the airport, Ghosh was told that his ticket was not valid. The sub-agent who had handed him his ticket told Ghosh that it had been cancelled by the main agent.

 The sub-agent from whom the client had purchased the ticket was not clearing our dues and so we had to cancel the ticket, argued Rajesh Agarwal, director of Paras Travels.

 We sympathise with the passenger, but unfortunately, this is entirely a matter for the travel agency, an airline spokesperson said. Customers can book tickets through British Airwayss contact centre, sales shops, or online.

 Ghosh is not the only victim of the e-ticket tangle. With a majority of passengers now opting for computer-generated virtual tickets, disputes between the main agent and sub-agents are taking their toll. Enough to prompt travel agents of the city to meet on Friday, address the problem and suggest corrective steps.

 The e-ticket is a strip of paper on which the Passenger Name Record (PNR) number and itinerary are mentioned. The authorised agent, from whom the ticket is purchased, can at any given time cancel or alter the booking. In the case of a paper ticket, cancellation is not possible without its presentation at the airline counter.

 We have received several complaints from passengers whose tickets were cancelled by agents. This can snowball into a crisis, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India. At Fridays meeting it was decided that before a ticket is cancelled, the passenger should be alerted. And to avoid being stumped at the airport, one must buy tickets from agents authorised by International Air Transport Association, said Punjabi.

 Crores for Rajarhat campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Annex Group of Institutions has announced plans for setting up a state-of-the-art, Rs 130-crore campus in the city. 

 The education trust has approached the state government for 10 acres of land in Rajarhat and is confident of a positive response. The residential campus will house specialised institutes offering courses in engineering, management, pharmaceutical studies, information technology and entrepreneurship. There will be a strong focus on research and development. 

 Director of Annex College of Management Studies Vikash Kumar Singh said: Dialogues are on with the state government. We had submitted our proposal to the government a year-and-a-half back and have received a letter from the land and land reforms ministry. We hope to have the land allocated to us by the end of this year. This will be a three-year project. The first phase, the cost outlay for which is expected to be around Rs 45 crore, should be operational by early 2008.

 Singh added that financial institutions would provide 90 per cent of the funds for the project. The Annex Trust will come up with the rest of the money.

 The group has planned to affiliate the institutes with West Bengal University of Technology and All-India Council for Technical Education and other authorities.

 The Rajarhat campus will have two hostels accommodating 800 students. The institutes will offer 26 courses with a seat capacity of 120 for each course.

 The Annex College of Management Studies has also announced the launch of one-year postgraduate programmes in retail management, travel and tourism management, real estate management and pharmaceuticals sales and management. 

 All the courses have been designed and conceived by our academicians, with inputs from the industry. There will be stress on academics as well as operations. Students will undergo a five-month internship with corporates and will be absorbed by them on completion of their course. We guarantee placements for all students, stated Singh.

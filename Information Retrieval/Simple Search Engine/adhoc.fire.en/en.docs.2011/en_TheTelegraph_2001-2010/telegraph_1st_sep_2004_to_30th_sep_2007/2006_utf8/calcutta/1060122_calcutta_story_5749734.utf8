 What: The launch of Ranjhan Yaar, the maiden album by Frankfinn Music, a division of Frankfinn Aviation Services.

 Where: Hotel Hindusthan International banquets.

 When: Saturday afternoon. 

 The sound: The Sufi album boasts eight love songs sung by Micky Narula. The lyrics have been simplified to suit a contemporary and universal audience, explains Micky, who has done more than 50 shows with sister Jaspinder Narula.

 The visuals: The song Yaar mera as well as the title track Ranjhan yaar have videos to their credit. Both videos feature Mumbai-based fashion designer and aspiring actress Vijaya. 

 Yaar mera has been directed by Bollywood choreographer Ahmed Khan while the title track has been choreographed by Pony Verma.

 Frankfinn claims to have spent more than Rs 50 lakh on these Bollywood-type song sets.

 We have purely depended on the strength of the songs, rather than on unnecessary skin show, says Kulvinder Singh Kohli, chairman of Frankfinn Group.

 Also spotted: Top city DJs like Anshul, Girish, Saranjit, Harish and Anil. My marketing and PR team thought of inviting the DJs to the launch since Yaar mera is a club number. Also, the rest of the songs can be promoted during the lounge hours at the nightclubs, explained Kohli. 

 l set to launch eight more albums this year, out of which two are by well-known Pakistani artistes, Frankfinn also seems open to interesting sounds churned out by DJs and upcoming artistes.

 While DJ Anshul also gave Kolhi a copy of his very own remix track to see if the company would be interested to launch it, Girish, the Shisha man, thought of this new strategy as not a bad marketing gimmick.

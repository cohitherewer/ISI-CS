 Bandit bash, mid-week fashion 

 Party Time -KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR

 Models Rahul and Shreya at the Pirates of the Caribbean night in Underground.

 What: Pirates of the Caribbean bash. Where: Underground at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 When: Friday night, coinciding with the release of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest.

 Take a look: The bandit feel was brought alive at the nightclub. The dead mans chest at the entrance hinted at the treasure of gifts and giveaways for the best dancing couples.

 Waiters sported red pirate bandanas, while skulls and skeletons entwined with ropes and bones welcomed the guests. Party animals swayed to the beats of DJ Anshul as he churned out hit tracks, including Summer moon, Rapture, Bheegi yaadein, Yaa Ali and Dil tod ke na jaana from the film Pyaar Ke Side Effects, ending the night with house music. 

 The event was organised in association with Sony Pictures. Free merchandise like skeleton key chains, pirate bandanas, eye patches, Pirates of the Caribbean T-shirts and movie tickets were handed out to the best dancing couples. 

 The guests mostly sipped on Mojita, the signature cocktail of the night and the national drink of Cuba.

 Voiceover: After the success of our last theme night Black and White, the backdrop of a bandit movie seemed the perfect way to find yet another excuse to party, said manager Vaibhav.

 Fusion feel

 What: A fashion show featuring an Indo-Western collection by designer Swati Srivastavas.

 Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth.

 When: Wednesday night. 

 Take a look: City models Cheena, Riya, Debdutta and others sizzled on the dance floor sporting ethnic as well as western outfits by Swati.

 Fabrics like georgette, chiffon, khadi, matka, raw silk, cotton and net shaped the garments. Bright colours like oranges, reds, firozi and golden yellow formed the colour story of the lehnga sequence, while subtler hues like off-white, beige and maroon ruled the tunics.

 Wraparound skirts were paired with corsets and inner churidars and trousers, blending tradition and modernity.

 What set the collection apart was the use of a sash or Japanese Origami belt along with the tunics, usually broad but narrowed down in this case to suit the Indian frame. 

 Voiceover: The Indian eye is looking for variety and my creations increase utility by allowing for mix-and-match options ? each garment crafted to form a complete piece in itself, said Swati.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 KBC to couple coup

 She is a very unlikely Super Sub but Rakshanda Khan has been picked by STAR to draw the TRPs and audiences Amitabh Bachchan used to command on Saturday nights with Kaun Banega Crorepati. Come March 4, 9 pm, and Rakshanda will welcome viewers to another celebrity game show ? after Nach Baliye ? called Jodee Kamaal Ki.

 ?I think one shouldn?t even dream of trying to match up to Mr Bachchan,? Rakshanda tells Metro. ?I am just going to be myself and hope people love the new format and watch the show. If I try and be someone else, it?s only going to get tougher.?

 Based on love, companionship and understanding, Jodee Kamaal Ki aims to test and inspire the strength of celebrity relationships. Unlike Nach Baliye, which only featured television couples, Jodee will have three celebrity couples coming on every episode from various walks of life including sports, politics, music and films.

 ?My role in the show is to help the couples connect and also ignite the spirit of competitiveness,? Rakshanda says. ?I had originally started out as a game show host and then I went on to do event hosting and acting. It feels great to be hosting a game show again.?

 The five interesting rounds designed to use different skill sets of each partner to test how well they complement each other are well thought out. Pyaar Ka Imtihaan is a warm-up round testing how well the partners know each other and to what extent they agree on something. Kaam Ke Na Kaaj Ke will test how well the team members can step into each other?s shoes, with husbands having to make chapaatis and wives having to tie neckties. Bolo To Jaane checks how well a celebrity couple communicates while Bol Boli Bol will be a round of trust. Finally, Hum Saath Saath Hain will test the teamwork, where the two partners will be given a task to complete together.

 ?We have already shot for a couple of episodes and it is very intriguing to find reactions from couples on many unknown issues,? reveals Rakshanda.

 The glamorous hostess is happy that her stint as an actress met with such a great response. ?Both my characters, Tanya in Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Mallika in Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, have been able to stand out on their own,? smiles Rakshanda. ?Even if the popularity of the serials have gone down, my characters continue to be as popular.?

 Right now, though, it?s all about cosying up with couples for Rakshanda, who is also hosting another show ? Indian Idol Takatak ? for STAR?s rival channel Sony network?s SAB. ?There I play the role of a friend and confidante to the finalists and they come and share everything with me. Here, on Jodee Kamaal Ki, I have to make the couples fight, yet connect with each other.?

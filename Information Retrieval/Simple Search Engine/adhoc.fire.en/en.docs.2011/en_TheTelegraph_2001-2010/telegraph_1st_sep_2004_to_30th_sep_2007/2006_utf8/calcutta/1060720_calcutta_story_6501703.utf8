Mega win for Mini 

Screen On amp; Off

 Mini Mathur is one happy woman. On one show, she earns a packet for keeping her heartbeat in check. On the other, she gets a pat on the back from the producers for her non-stop chatter. 

 Rewind by a month. It is action time at Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari in Mumbai. Inside one of the godown-like structures, a platform has been built with giant screens in the background. 

 This is the stage from where Mini anchors Sirf Ek Minute Mein, Sahara One?s live dial-in game show. Once the clock strikes seven, it is serious business with checks being carried out like clockwork.

 TV, motorcycle, dishwasher, sunglasses ? a tempting spread is on offer as the questions flow thick and fast. With seconds to go for the show to end, a woman picks up the biggest booty of the evening, a motorcycle. ?It?s my first day as anchor here and I got in seven callers in 21 minutes. They say it?s a record,? Mini gushes, ?It?s the first time people are loving me for talking fast.? 

 Fast forward to the present. Mini is on seventh heaven, having pocketed Rs 20 lakh on STAR One?s Heart Beat: Dil Thhaam ke Khelo as the first celebrity on the show to hit the jackpot. Isolated in the claustrophobic booth, she fielded the bouncers with as much elan as she bowls them. ?The trick was to keep your cool as you are given 500 of your own heartbeats as time. The more nervous you get, the faster you spend your time.? 

 She did have her husband and brother on the Internet to help her out.

 ?Forty per cent went in taxes; some I donated for the blast victims. The rest went in treating the 15 people who formed my helpline team.? The money may all be gone, but Mini is still a winner.

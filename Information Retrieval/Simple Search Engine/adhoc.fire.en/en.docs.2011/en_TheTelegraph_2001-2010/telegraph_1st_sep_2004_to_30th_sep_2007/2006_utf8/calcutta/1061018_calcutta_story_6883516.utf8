 Bar on cylinder loading

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) distributors were on Tuesday restrained from loading and unloading cylinders on the road by the state pollution control boards appellate authority, headed by former high court judge Gitesh Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 The distributors will have to pick up the gas cylinders from their respective godowns and take them straight to the customers. The loading and unloading of gas cylinders on the open road is against pollution norms, ruled the judge. The distributors do not have the right to load and unload cylinders in vans from the delivery trucks, the judge stated.

 The judgment has caught the distributors off guard. They are apprehending delay in reaching cylinders to consumers if the judgment is implemented. The distributors have planned to move the high court challenging the order.

 After the judgment, it will be impossible for the LPG distributors to promptly supply cylinders to consumers. My clients will have to wait till there is enough demand to warrant a trip to the godown for picking up the cylinders. As a result, there will be a delay in supply, said advocate Saptangshu Basu, who appeared for a distributor on BK Pal Avenue.

 The appellate authority had said the judgment would come into effect after four months. I will move the high court and seek a permanent stay on the order, added Basu.

 A resident of BK Pal Avenue had lodged a complaint with the board against an LPG distributor in the area. The petitioner argued that the loading and unloading of gas cylinders on the open road violated of Gas Cylinders Handling Rules under the Explosives Act and claimed that the practice causes pollution.

 The authority passed an order applicable to all distributors, explained Basu.

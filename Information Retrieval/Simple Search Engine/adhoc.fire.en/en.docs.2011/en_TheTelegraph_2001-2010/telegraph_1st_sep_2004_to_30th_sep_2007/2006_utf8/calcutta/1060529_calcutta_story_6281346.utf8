The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rule flout by private operators

 Md. Amiruzzaman: I recently learnt that couriers are being barred from carrying packages weighing less than 300 gm. This will inconvenience the public a great deal. How can the postal department force us to avail of its services, especially since it is not dependable? Is the order being issued to secure a monopoly for the department?

 According to Indian Postal Act, only the postal department is authorised to deliver consignments weighing between 1 gm and 2 kg. Till date, we have not enforced the Act. A section of unscrupulous businessmen have started offering courier services. They are creating problems for us by violating laws. The Speedpost service offered by us is suffering due to unfair advantages enjoyed by the private operators.

 A stall at the India International Mega Trade Fair

 Touted as the biggest fair of its kind in eastern India, the India International Mega Trade Fair 2006 offered an array of options to the consumer. 

 From those looking for the lowest home loan interest to those trying to find quality home furnishing, the fair catered to present and prospective house-owners.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty opened the fair on May 18 at the helipad ground of the Salt Lake stadium. About 215,000 people visited the fair till it closed on May 28.

 A number of seminars were organised to showcase Bengal as an exciting destination for trade and investment.

 ?The objective was to make the fair multi-dimensional and a gateway to industrial development in eastern India. The focus was on industrial progress, capabilities and business potential of eastern India in general and Bengal in particular,? said S.D. Gupta, director, GS Marketing.

 Property agents, developer forums, cosmetic brands and even food product companies took part in the fair, supported by real estate developers? association Credai. The Salem group, ICICI and HDFC, interior decoration brands Mobel, Somany and Marc were among the participants. Food products major Britannia and cosmetics brand Emami were also there at the fair. 

 ?We wanted to provide the consumer with a large number of options. While the stress may have been on meeting the prospective or existing home-owners? needs, there was something for everyone,? explained Gupta.

 The popularity of the event had forced the organisers to look for a larger venue this time round. ?The number of visitors has been growing every year, forcing us to move from the Maidan to the Salt Lake stadium,? said Gupta.

 Generating revenues to the tune of about Rs 400 crore, the fair will henceforth be organised every two years.

 In search of a dream

 I will perform a solo act I 

 think for the first time ever. There are a few others 

 on stage but mine is the only speaking part. I play 

 a working woman in her mid-30s, who is rushing to get 

 ready for work in the morning. This is against the backdrop 

 of a war and as she talks one gets to know about her 

 resentment at the monotonous drudgery of everyday life 

 the poverty, the kind of treatment she gets 

 from her boss in the factory... I havent done 

 any serious theatre before and when Koushik offered 

 me the role I readily agreed. I will perform Shuprabhat 

 one Saturday every month at Sujata Sadan, says 

 Roopa Ganguly (seen with Koushik Sen in picture above

 From Ankhipallab in 1992 to Malloban in 2006, Swapnasandhani seems to have finally come of age. Celebrating its 14th year, this 30-member group is ready to launch a four-day festival (May 26-29) at Sujata Sadan.

 ?We have accepted the fact that we are an alternative theatre group and have proved that it is still possible to survive independently and do good theatre in Calcutta,? said actor- director Koushik Sen during a break in rehearsals.

 Malloban based on the eponymous Jibanananda Das novel is one of the two new plays being fine-tuned by the group for its upcoming festival. The other, Shuprabhat, will feature screen star Roopa Ganguly in a solo act. With these two productions, Swapnasandhani will have a repertoire of 12 full-length and 10 short plays.

 ?This group was the dream of my father (theatre personality Shyamal Sen), who was its vice-president in 1992 when Soumitra Chatterjee was president,? recalled Koushik.

 On the opening night of the festival, after the staging of Banku Babur Bandhu, the popular play based on a Satyajit Ray story, the annual Shyamal Sen Smriti Samman will be conferred. ?This prize is limited only to young practitioners of theatre (individuals or groups) with significant contributions to their credit,? said Koushik. The four groups selected this year are Ethic of Belghoria, Natadha of Howrah, Total Theatre, and Vivekananda Educational Society.

 On May 27, Samudrer Mauno will take the stage for the 13th time. Starring Koushik, wife Reshmi Sen, Kabir Suman and Amit Bhattacharya this was one of the plays written secretly by someone with the pen name Vevcor during World War II.

 On May 28, Shuprabhat will be premiered. Translated by Jaya Mitra this is one of the short plays written by Franca Rame (wife of Dario Fo) to keep their group going through bleak times. ?It focuses on the typical tragedy of married couples everywhere today. They no longer have the time to be together or even listen to each other,? said Koushik.

 Shuprabhat finds a woman talking to her baby as she prepares for another hard day at the factory. Her husband, also a factory worker, sleeps throughout the play. Everything seems to be going wrong for her until a ?miracle? occurs, only underlining how mechanical our existence is.

 On the same day there is Bhalo Rakkhosher Galpo, a play on environmental awareness, which has been well received.

 Koushik feels Malloban, to be staged on May 29, has tremendous relevance today and ?people will relate to it quite easily?. Protagonist Malloban (played by Koushik) is a frustrated, lower middle class, 42-year old who yearns for an idyllic way of life. A maze of stairs separates the rooms of Malloban and his ambitious, self-centred wife Utpala. ?The likes of Malloban are misfits in this age, and find themselves isolated and vulnerable,? said Koushik.

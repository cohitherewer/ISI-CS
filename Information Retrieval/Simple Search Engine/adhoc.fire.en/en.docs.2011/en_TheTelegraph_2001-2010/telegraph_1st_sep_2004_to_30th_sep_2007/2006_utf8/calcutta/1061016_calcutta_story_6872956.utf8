CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA REVISES 

THE RAMAYANA AND SETS SITA FREE... FOREVER

Recently I got an e-mail forward from a friend. It 

was very long, but since the subject line humbly said not bad if you have 

time, I read it.

It was an article by novelist Julian Barnes, in which 

he re-imagines the novel Madame Bovary, allowing Emma to correct her own 

story. So though in the original Flaubert makes her die of a sizzling, dissatisfied 

heart, here she lives on to accept weight, grey hair, a chicken gifted by a farmer 

on Sunday, in a village with her husband. Couples survive. And women survive 

too, she signs off.

I am nobody, but I have this great urge. I want to 

do my bit to revise the ending of a very well-known story that has shaped our 

countrys past to a great extent.

The scene is Lanka. Kumbhakarna, Vibhishan, Indrajit 

and Ravana are dead. Ram has just won the battle over the Rakshashas.

He is a graceful victor he has cremated Ravana in 

style, after wrapping his huge body and his 10 severed heads in miles of designer 

brocade and burning them on a pyre of sandalwood, for which he has uprooted an 

entire forest.

Then someone remembers Sita. Rams campaign was 

launched for her. She deserved to be looked up.

So Hanuman was despatched to Ashokvan again and he 

found her still moping wearing that old tattered soiled cotton saffron sari 

she had been kidnapped in, tears streaming down her cheeks. It was very picturesque, 

very Raja Ravi Verma.

She was overjoyed and stunned to hear the news of 

Rams victory. She said she would meet her husband in the state she was, 

but Hanuman said no.

So she bathed and wore all sorts of resplendent clothes 

and jewellery and presented herself before her godly husband.

Her heart was beating violently. In Ashokvan, under 

the shade of the shimshapa tree, she had been dreaming of this moment for God 

knows how long.

It was not easy; the ogresses would keep a stern watch 

and Ravana would try to seduce her daily, with words of love, desire or downright 

threat, and she would feel vulnerable but wanted, filled at times with a strange 

tenderness towards the Rakshasha king, and wonder if her and Ravanas story 

was the ancient anthropological model of the King Kong narratives of the future.

But she was fully aware of her role as Rams 

wife and the weight of her chastity.

So she always distracted herself by thinking of the 

moment of their meeting again. Would her husband be rendered speechless? Would 

he look tender, with eyes glistening with tears? Would his eyes burn with passion? 

Would she faint?

She was ready to faint now, but Ram seemed to have 

other things in mind.

Sita, you have spent so much time with the Rakshashas. 

How do we know you are chaste? I have done what a man could by punishing Ravana. 

But I cannot accept you. You are free to go anywhere you want.

So this was love. Sitas heart cracked from side 

to side. Before, I was ready to faint. Now, I am ready to die. Lakshman, 

light a pyre, I will kill myself, Sita said.

Lakshman promptly lit it and Sita was ready to jump 

in, but something snapped inside her brain. Words that she had held long back 

exploded in her head. If she had lived through Ashokvan, she might as well live.

I have changed my mind. I want to make a little 

speech, she told the crowd, her eyes flashing. It will be on grammar, 

language, logic and gender.

It starts with womens names, she 

continued. I was called Sita, the ploughed woman. My earthly father Janaka, 

King of Mithila, found me while ploughing the field. He was a very rich farmer.

I was also called Janaki, Maithili, Vaidehi, 

but why did I get stuck with Sita? I have some divinity in me, as everyone knows, 

and my manifestation on earth was not entirely without my consent, but from the 

very start they made it certain that I was a passive voice. Dont dismiss 

me as merely an adjective, because you know what I am saying. So much for grammar. 

Man made it.

Friends, Romans and Indians, my next point is 

about logic. My husband tells me that I may not be chaste. He is the active voice. 

But why cant I ask him if he has been chaste?

Because logic doesnt permit me to. Because 

a man, especially someone in Rams position, cannot be unchaste, even if 

he cavorts with a thousand women. If a man cannot be unchaste, how can I ask him 

if he is chaste? So much for logic, man-made too.

I know my husband doesnt mind me going 

through the agnipariksha, because it is a win-win situation for him. If 

I die, its the end. If Agnidev saves me, proving my innocence, Ram will 

be able to take me back, which is the script, also made by a man. But Ram knows 

that no one, nothing, including fire, can really prove chastity. 

Friends, Romans, countrywomen, I will end by 

saying that my husband is an honourable man and he is mostly blue or green, but 

he can change colour further and turnwhatever.

So saying Sita looked down and said: Open up, 

Mother Earth. Verily Earth, her True Mother, cracked herself open and took 

Sita right back into her womb.

There Sita, in a Kill Bill yellow catsuit, 

would start an underground school for girls, where she would teach the right grammar, 

logic and philosophy. But that started another battle.

Moral of the story: Dont delete all forwarded 

mail.

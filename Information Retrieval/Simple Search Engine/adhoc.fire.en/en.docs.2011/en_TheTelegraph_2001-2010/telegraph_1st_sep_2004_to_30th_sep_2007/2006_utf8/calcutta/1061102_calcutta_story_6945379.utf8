 Spirit of celebration

 Any effort to enrich the lives of underprivileged children and youth with music, art and similar other cultural activities deserves special praise. Performed by students of Sri Aurobindo Music College, Suri, Birbhum, many of whom have been brought up in homes for the distressed, The Melody of Eternity, this evenings programme of music and dance, represents the fruition of such endeavours. Depicting the daily lives, customs, rituals and culture of economically backward people like peasants, boatmen and woodcutters, it provides a stirring account of the incessant trials and toils endured by them merely to sustain themselves. In spite of all their hardships, they remain true to their native tradition, rejuvenating their arduous lives with the spontaneous spirit of festivity and the natural warmth of relationships. Thus, the cultural spectrum of our country continues to radiate undying brilliance eternally. Choreography: Nibedita Lahiri. Hosted by EZCC.

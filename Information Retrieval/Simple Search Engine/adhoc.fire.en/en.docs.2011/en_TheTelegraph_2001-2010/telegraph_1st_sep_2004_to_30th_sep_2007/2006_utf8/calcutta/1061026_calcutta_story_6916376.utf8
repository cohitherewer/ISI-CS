 Ayurveda at clinic 

 - Alternative 

 blend with allopathy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The first ayurveda therapy clinic in the city opened doors at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital on Wednesday. Kerala Ayurvedic Health Spa (KAHS), a unit of Kerala Vaidyashala, launched the unit, which will offer treatment of spondylosis, slipped disc, arthritis and asthma and medicated oil massages.

 The clinic will initially be located in the hospitals existing building, off EM Bypass. It will be shifted to our new building, where the facilities will be enhanced, said V.K. Ramanan, director (medical services) of Apollo Gleneagles. The clinic is an attempt to blend allopathic treatment with alternative medicine, he explained. Apollo has also tied up with KAHS in Agra.

 In the new building, the ayurveda centre is slated to offer nearly 100 therapies, including mud bath. The aim is not only to treat ailments but prevent diseases and rejuvenate, stated Harshjeet Kuroop, managing director, KAHS.

 Lifestyle changes have aggravated several physical disorders. Ayurveda therapy helps in overcoming stress. Therapies with herbs and oils not only refresh and rejuvenate the mind and body, but are free of toxicity and side effects, he added.

 According to Kuroop, the unit also plans to set up a ward for indoor patients in the new building. Due to space constraints, for now, we will only treat outpatients in sessions during the day, said Kuroop. This is a popular method to attract medical tourism, he pointed out.

 The new hospital wing, spread over 72,000 sq ft, will have a full-fledged lifestyle management unit. Apart from the ayurveda clinic, it will also have a fitness management centre, stated a hospital official.

 A number of private hospitals in the city have introduced fitness and rehabilitation centres. BM Birla Heart Research Centre has a fitness and rehabilitation centre for cardiac patients who have undergone surgery. AMRI Hospitals, too, has a similar facility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buddha balm for traders

 - Burrabazar law-and-order cry referred to home department

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A string of complaints over the past two years against corrupt cops in the Burrabazar-Posta belt has finally yielded a response from the highest level in the government.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s secretary Dipankar Mukhopadhyay has informed Burrabazar Nagarik Front that the complaints have been forwarded to the home department for necessary action at the earliest.

 ?We are pleased that the chief minister?s office has finally responded to our complaints,? said Amit Pandey, assistant secretary of the Front, an association of traders and residents in the city?s trade turf. 

 ?We received a letter (240 CMS, dated 9.03.2006) last Monday, in which Mukhopadhyay said he had received our last complaint, addressed to the chief minister, on February 22 and had forwarded it to the home department,? he added.

 Metro had carried a series of reports highlighting the deteriorating law and order situation in Burrabazar and the allegations of a nexus between policemen and criminals in the locality.

 The traders? charter of demands include a dedicated helpline for dealing with complaints against cops who demand bribes. ?Such a helpline will help us a lot. Traders in the Burrabazar, Posta and Jorasanko areas now spend a good deal of money to keep policemen and extortionists happy,? Pandey said.

 The organisation, he added, will also inform the government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation about illegal construction in several pockets in the central business district.

 ?Several buildings in the area are being extended, violating all rules. Quite a few of the new buildings, too, are illegal. The civic authorities have been informed several times, but in vain,? Pandey alleged.

 Another member of the organisation claimed: ?A proper probe will reveal that 95 per cent of all construction activities in the trade hub in the past five years were unauthorised.?

 The civic authorities have denied the allegations.

 Mayoral council member in charge of buildings Dipankar Dey said: ?We hardly receive any complaint about illegal construction in the Burrabazar area. If a person comes to us with details, we will take action against the offenders.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Musharraf fire fizzles out in city 

 - FEW TAKERS FOR GENERALS MEMOIRS

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 MEN OF LETTERS: 

 (Top): Bill Clinton. (Below): Pervez Musharraf 

 One wrote his autobiography before being nominated for the hot seat and yet produced a bestseller. Another wrote it after eight years in the hot seat and cashed in on all the happenings in his political and personal life. The latest one fought his way to the hot seat but has failed to win the book battle.

 In Calcutta, Pervez Musharrafs In the Line of Fire has fired a blank, compared to Bill Clintons My Life and A.P.J. Abdul Kalams Wings of Fire.

 If the former US Presidents autobiography drew readers young and curious, the Indian Presidents work sold big among students and their parents. Musharrafs memoir, however, has made no headway among civilians despite the revelation that he had once fallen in love with a Bengali girl.

 The Rs 950 hardbound has only found takers among the uniformed corps and the establishment. Only a negligible number of civilians bought a share of the 50 copies that we had brought in. Officials from the army and the Border Security Force, bureaucrats and politicians have bought the book, says Rajiv Chowdhry, CEO, Oxford Bookstore, awaiting its next consignment.

 In contrast, Clintons Life had generated a huge hype pre-release and lived up to its billing on the racks. Besides Clintons action-packed administrative tenure, his personal life was of huge interest to readers. His autobiography promised a lot of interesting content, including a certain Monica Lewinsky, smiles Gautam Jatia of Landmark, where 100 copies of My Life were lapped up within days of its release.

 Wings of Fire, launched in 1999, is selling till today. Soon after he wrote the book, he became President and that acted as a major catalyst. Also, our President is a popular figure, especially amongst children, says Jatia, who has sold 500 copies of the autobiography till date.

 So why has Line of Fire fizzled out, despite it being the first published memoir of a Pakistan head of state while still in office, despite so-called revelations about the Kargil war, despite his fixation with Karachi during his teens because of a Bengali girl, and more?

 The price factor, for one. It is a hardbound edition priced at Rs 950, which is too high. In Calcutta, the average selling price of a book is between Rs 200 and Rs 250. Sales might pick up with the more reasonable paperback edition, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword.

 But even the paperback edition might fail to fire sales, as Pervez Musharraf is hardly the most popular figure to spend on this festive season. His book neither falls in the fiction nor in the general interest category. Very few people would really want to read it, feels Gautam Jatia.

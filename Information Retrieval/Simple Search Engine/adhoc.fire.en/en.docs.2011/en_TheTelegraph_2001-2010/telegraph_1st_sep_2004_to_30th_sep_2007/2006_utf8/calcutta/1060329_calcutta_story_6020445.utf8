 What: G-Way Chilli Spray.

 Take a look: How many times have you been harassed on the city streets and wished you had something in hand to teach your tormentor a lesson? And now, there is help at hand.

 The G-Way spray promises to be an effective tool of self-defence. 

 A product of Star Security Services, the spray contains capsicum Oleorasin Capsicum (chilli extracts) solution in water and aerosol propellant. 

 Not causing permanent damage, it triggers a burning sensation and a pungent smell when sprayed.

 The effect begins to wear off in 20 minutes, but by then your harasser would have learnt a lesson the hard way and you would have proved a point to him and to yourself.

 Launched six months ago, the sale of this self-defence spray is picking up gradually. In the last three to four months we have sold around 40 to 50 bottles across India. This month we sold 50 cans in Chennai itself, claims Usha Sundar, managing partner, Star Security Services.

 The spray is specially designed and easy to use. All one needs to do is press, with the nozzle facing the enemy.

 Pocket pinch: On receipt of a demand draft for Rs 180 to Star Security Services, Plot no. 43, 24th Cross Street, Padmavathy Nagar, Selaiyur, Chennai, the 50 ml can will be despatched.

 Voiceover: This gives confidence to todays woman on the move. This is also useful for old people who are home alone, says Lt-Col. C.R. Sundar, managing partner, Star Security Services.

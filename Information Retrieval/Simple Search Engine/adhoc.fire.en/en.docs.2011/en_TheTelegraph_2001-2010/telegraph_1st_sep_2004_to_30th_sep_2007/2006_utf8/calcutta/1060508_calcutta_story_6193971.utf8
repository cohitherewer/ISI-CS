The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Out of jail, misfit in society

 - Shunned by kin amp; neighbours, convicts fail to re-integrate

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Kallol Bhattacharya had long dreamt of a life of liberty, but was scared to think how he would adjust to freedom. His nightmare proved to be true when his family refused to take him back after being released from Presidency Central jail last July.

 Bhattacharya had spent 20 years in jail as an undertrial for allegedly murdering his father-in-law. Acting on a report of the judicial review committee that he could return to society, Calcutta High Court appointed Asim Roy and Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee as his counsel. He was released on bail, following a submission by the counsel.

 Bhattacharya?s is not a one-off case. Sahanara Bibi, and Bharat and Satrughna Moitra, too, met a similar fate on being released from jail.

 ?Sahanara Bibi was accused of murdering her child. The trial dragged on for 16 years, but the charge could not be proved. When she was released, no one from the family came forward to take her back. She disappeared without a trace,? advocate Chatterjee recalled.

 The Moitras were serving life sentences for ?murdering? Madhusudan Santra, a resident of Haripal, in Hooghly. In 2005, after 14 years, they were acquitted of all charges by Justice A.K. Basu and Justice P.K. Deb, who observed that the duo had been framed.

 ?But when they returned to their village, they were shunned by their family and neighbours. No one knows where they are now,? said Chatterjee.

 Advocate Roy rued: ?We now refer to jails as correctional homes, but there is no organisation that works for re-integration of convicts into society after their release.?

 Bhattacharya, however, refuses to be cowed by the hostile surroundings and still dreams of living life with his head held high. ?I saw several convicts coming back to jail within a week or two of their release. For some, the world outside is worse than the confines of a jail ? they have no job, no shelter and no clue how to live on their own. But I never thought I would be in a similar situation,? Bhattacharya repented.

 He now stays on the verandah of Purono Kali Mandir on Kalicharan Ghosh Road, ?named after my ancestor?. ?The prasad is all I get to eat during the day. At night, my mother, who has a room in our ancestral house nearby, shares her meal with me,? he said.

 Counsel Chatterjee said the authorities of correctional homes conduct sessions for socio-psychological rehabilitation of prisoners, but society is not prepared to share space with those who have served time in jail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fatal shot freezes station

 - Unidentified man fired at from point-blank range at peak hour

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Mumbai-style shootout claimed a life and left Sealdah station shell-shocked on Thursday evening.

 The victim, a man in his early 30s, was shot in the head on a crowded approach to the railway station around 7 pm.

 Taking advantage of the platform-bound crowd crush, the gunman fired from point-blank range and then melted into the multitude.

 Preliminary investigation put the daring strike down to a gang rivalry in the Sealdah area or personal vendetta. The victim had not been identified and no arrest carried out till late on Thursday.

 Police said the fatal shot was fired on the western flank of the underpass, opposite the station gates. No one seems to have seen the killer, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Basudeb Banerjee, a garment trader with a shop close to the murder site, told Metro: It was close to 7 pm when I heard a sound like two bulbs bursting. At first, I did not suspect anything. But then I saw a crowd gathering in front of my shop and a policeman alerting senior officers over his mobile phone.

 Before Banerjee could realise what was happening, he heard shouts of Pala, pala police guli korchhey. That sparked panic and people began scurrying for cover.

 There was a mini stampede... But soon, order was restored and a police vehicle arrived to take away the body. We were stunned to learn that a man had been shot by goons during peak hour, said Banerjee, adding that he had not seen anything like this in the past 30 years that he has been plying his trade near Sealdah station.

 The area remained cordoned off till late and most shops close to the murder site downed shutters.

 The shootout has turned the spotlight back on the criminalisation of the Sealdah railway station area. An officer from Muchipara police station said several gangs are active here, with a drug market springing up every night and extortion being rampant.

 We have to take this route every evening. This incident is really scary. Police must intensify vigil to ensure commuter safety, said Himadri Chakraborty, homeward bound at Sealdah station on Thursday night.

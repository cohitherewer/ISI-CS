 A technology-driven system has been put in place on Vidyasagar Setu to ensure that not a single vehicle crosses the bridge without paying the toll. 

 On Saturday, SMSL-IRD took over the toll collection from the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC). 

 Under the new system, those who use the bridge frequently have the option of buying smart cards from SMSL-IRD. Placing the cards in front of the smart gates in the toll plaza will open them. There is no need to insert the card in a machine or swipe it. 

 Of 18 gates at the toll plaza, 14 are smart gates. The remaining gates are electronically operated from the control room. These are primarily meant for vehicles in a hurry.

 There will be the option of paying in cash at all the gates. Officials of the company said that those without smart cards would initially be allowed to use any of the gates. Later, gates will be designated for those who want to pay the toll in cash. 

 The smart cards, costing Rs 90 each, will be valid for 66 trips over five years. On expiry, the card can be recharged by paying the same amount. 

 The smart cards can be purchased from the toll plaza office. The owner will have to provide his/her name, address, age and particulars of driving licence and vehicle to procure the cards. 

 As per the agreement between the HRBC and SMSL-IRD, government vehicles, including those of ministers, VIPs and police jeeps, will have to pay the toll to cross the bridge. They won?t, however, have to pay upfront.

 The HRBC will issue stickers, to be pasted on the windscreen of the vehicles, that will allow smooth passage through the toll plaza. 

 The government agency will later pay the toll for the vehicles with stickers. 

 ?We will inform the company about the number of cars issued the stickers. On the basis of the number, they will give us a monthly bill, which we will pay. I have asked the transport department to give us a list of VIPs who will be issued the stickers,?? said HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee. 

 ?Gone are the days when hundreds of vehicles used to cross the bridge evading toll either by bribing the policemen or toll employees or claiming to be VIPs. We do not know any VIPs. Nobody will be allowed to cross the plaza without paying the toll,? asserted Ramesh Rawat, spokesman of the SMSL-IRD. 

 ?We have to pay Rs 2,007 crore to the HRBC every year and we will not cough up the money from our coffers. The amount has to be earned by collection of toll, so the question of being lenient does not arise. If the government or HRBC feels that someone?s car need not pay the toll on the spot, it is welcome to pay for those vehicles,? Rawat added. 

 The company on Saturday stopped over a hundred ?VIP? cars on the bridge that tried to evade paying the toll. Several hundred trucks, which often bribe policemen and plaza employees and sail through, were also stopped.

What: Art camp Abotar Abanindranath. 

Where: Trincas, 17B Park Street.

 When: August 16, 9 am to 7 pm.

 Take a look: Twenty-three artists got together at a day-long art camp organised by Different Strokes, an organisation promoting young and talented artists in association with Trincas. To celebrate Janmashtami and the birth anniversary of Abanindranath Tagore, one of the pioneers of Bengal art, the theme was Krishna. The day started off with bhajans by Madhurikana Chattopadhyay and Rabindrasangeet by Indrani Bhattacharya. 

 Former mayor of Calcutta Subrata Mukherjee was the chief guest at the inauguration, with Meera Bhattacharjee, wife of the chief minister, also making her presence felt (in picture above by Rashbehari Das). Present amongst the artists who took part in Abotar Abanindranath were Bijan Chowdhury, Partha Bhattacharya, Subrata Gangopadhyaya, Anita Roy Chowdhury and Mintu Deb. Proceeds from the sale of paintings will go to Mentaid, an NGO working for the mentally challenged, and Helpage India, providing shelter and medical aid to needy senior citizens.

 The event also saw the release of Vatsayan Brindaboni, a romantic novel by Sankarlal Bhattacharjee.

 Voiceover: Our forthcoming ambitious ventures will see us holding art camps in Varanasi and Darjeeling in January and April 2007, respectively, said Ajoy Gupta, founder of Different Strokes.

 LPG vehicle tested for CNG fumes

 JAYANTA BASU

 There is no way you can lay your hands on compressed natural gas (CNG) in the city, but don?t be surprised if the CNG emission standard is applied to your liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) car the next time you take it for an emission test. 

 Or, if you are lucky, the considerably less stringent petrol standard might be used for the pollution under control (PUC) test on your LPG vehicle. 

 An LPG-run Maruti 800 (WB 02F 8520) obtained a PUC certificate from Lake Auto Service, in south Calcutta, on the basis of the CNG emission standard in November 2005. The report said the car was running on CNG, a green fuel that is definitely not available in the city. 

 When the owner of the car took it to Lansdown Service Station for a repeat test in April this year, the vehicle sailed through, clearing the emission parameters for petrol this time.

 Such incidents are clearly the rule rather than the exception. ?I pointed out the mistakes in both cases but was categorically told that this was the norm,? said the car-owner. 

 ?The hydrocarbon emission standard for CNG is far more stringent than that of LPG. A car that can obtain a PUC certificate as per the LPG standard, might struggle to do so if the CNG standard is applied,? explained auto emission expert S.M. Ghosh. 

 The hydrocarbon standard for petrol is the easiest to clear (see box). 

 ?Using the wrong fuel standard for emission tests is a serious lapse,? admitted Asim Banerjee, secretary of Auto Emission Testing Centre Owners Association. 

 ?We only work on the software that the company (Indus) supplied,? a representative of Lake Auto Service said in its defence.

 ?There are options for both CNG and LPG in the software. It is up to the person using the software to choose the correct option,? observed Aniruddha Poddar of Indus. He complained that ?untrained hands frequently operate the auto-emission testing machines?.

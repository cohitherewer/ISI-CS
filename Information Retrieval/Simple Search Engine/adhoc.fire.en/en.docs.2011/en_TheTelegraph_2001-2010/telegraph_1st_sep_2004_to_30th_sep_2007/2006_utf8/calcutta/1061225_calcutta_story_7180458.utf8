 Second burglary in 4 days

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A gang broke into the ground floor of a double-storeyed house in Seven Tanks Lane, in Sinthee, late on Saturday and decamped with gold ornaments, Rs 4,000 in cash and two cellphones.

 This was the second incident of a theft at night in the Sinthee police station area in the past four days.

 Police said house-owner Prodyut Banerjee, 42, an employee of a private firm, and his family were on the first floor and came to know about the burglary only on Sunday morning. Prodyuts brother Pradip was on the ground floor till 11 pm.

 We have started an investigation into the case and hope to crack it soon. We need some time, because it appears that a common gang is involved in both cases, said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (north).

 Police said the gang picked on the Banerjees house because it does not have a covered entrance. 

 There are very few houses in the locality that do not have a covered entrance. The two rooms on the first floor in the Banerjees house are usually locked with an iron chain attached to the top of the door. The gang entered the house after breaking the chain, said an officer of Sinthee police station.

 On December 20, a gang broke into the South Sinthee Road flat of Archana Roy and walked away with gold ornaments and Rs 1,000 in cash.

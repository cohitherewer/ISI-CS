 Road repair list with a tilt to the north

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The north-south development divide is set to be bridged a bit, with a road-repair move aiming to correct the southward tilt of the previous civic board.

 In the countdown to the Assembly polls, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken up a Rs 15-crore project to revamp 19 arteries, most of them in the north. Some link roads, too, will be touched up, at a cost of Rs 1 crore.

 A major campaign plank of the Left Front before the civic polls had been ?balanced development? of the city. It had made much of the complaints from north Calcutta residents against former mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s ?southern bias?.

 The road revamp programme, observers believe, falls in line with the CPM?s strategy of winning a few more seats from the city in Poll ?06.

 ?I live in south Calcutta, but that does not mean that I shall pay less attention to the north. We have prepared a list of roads that need to be repaired,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said on Thursday.

 The roads picked for repairs in the north are Vivekananda Road, Keshub Sen Street, Gas Street, MM Burman Street, Bidhan Sarani, College Street, Nirmal Chandra Street, MG Road, BB Ganguly Street and CIT Road (from Ultadanga to Phoolbagan), Sukeas Street and Surya Sen Street.

 Down south, Bondel Road, Belvedere Road, Beckbagan Row, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, SP Mukherjee Road (between Tollygunge railway bridge and Hazra crossing), Mayfair Road and Wood Street will be given a facelift.

 Civic officials admit that roads in the south are better off than those in the north. Some arteries in the north, such as MG Road, Bidhan Sarani, and Rabindra Sarani, have not been overhauled for years.

 On several occasions, Calcutta High Court had pulled up the government and the civic body for the poor condition of the thoroughfares. Potholed roads had also earned them the wrath of the public. 

 The project comes close on the heels of a tram track repair programme undertaken by the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners that would largely benefit the north.

 BB Ganguly Street, Bidhan Sarani, MG Road, Rabindra Sarani and Nirmal Chandra Street would all be revamped at a cost of Rs 34 crore.

 Writers? Buildings officials said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee recently asked the mayor to take ?a personal initiative? in road repairs. ?Do repair the roads immediately and ensure the city does not drown this monsoon,?? the chief minister is learnt to have said.

 The mayor said the 19 arteries would be repaired with mastic asphalt. ?Work is set to start within a fortnight and we hope to complete a major part by April.? The repairs, he promised, would last at least two years.

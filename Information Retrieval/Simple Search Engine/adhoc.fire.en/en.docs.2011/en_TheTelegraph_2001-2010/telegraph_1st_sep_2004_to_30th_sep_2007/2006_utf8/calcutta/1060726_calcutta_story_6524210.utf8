 A set of demands to safeguard their future in the cable trade and a gherao to demand what is rightfully theirs. 

 Cable operators were a busy lot on Tuesday when a group marched from Sealdah station to Rani Rashmoni Avenue, appealing for stability in their trade, while another laid siege on the Hazra Road office of a broadcaster, demanding decoders.

 ?We want Conditional Access System implemented immediately and new operators, MSOs and free-to-air service providers stopped from entering the trade,? said Tarak Saha, president of Forum of Cable Operators. 

 The association also submitted a deputation to the chief minister in this regard.

 If preventing admission to new entities was the purpose of the Rani Rashmoni Avenue rally, gaining entry was the aim of the Hazra Road gherao of SET Discovery?s office. 

 ?Despite repeated requests, Sony has not provided us with its channels. We will continue the dharna till they do,? said Mrinal Chatterjee, of upcoming MSO Kolkata Cable and Broadband Services.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Now, Sexy Sam is Johnny Walker

Screen On amp; Off 

Amitabh Bachchan will play the title role in Shoojit 

Sircars next film, an emotional tale of relationships, to be co-produced by 

Percept Picture Company and AB Corp, writes Pratim D. Gupta

 Amitabh will play a man living in a corner 

of Manali whose life comes full circle when he falls in love all over again with 

his old flame. Vidya Balan (middle) is being approached to play the leading lady 

while Abhishek Bachchan (bottom) could play the young Amitabh.

Anthony Gonzalves, Vijay Chauhan, Devraj Sahay, Sexy 

Sam Johnny Walker. Neither is he endorsing the alcohol brand by the same name 

nor is he playing the legendary comedian of the Indian screen. But come 2007, 

Amitabh Bachchan will be Johnny Walker.

After four months of discussions and debates, Bachchan 

is all set to play the title role in what would be Shoojit Sircars next film 

after his critically acclaimed directorial debut Yahaan.

Percept Picture Company, which was earlier behind 

Amarjeet (Shoojits anti-tobacco film set in Calcutta that didnt roll), 

will be producing Johnny Walker.

Bachchan, who is currently in London, confirmed the 

development saying: I am very excited to be a part of Johnny Walker. I 

feel the film has the potential to cut across global audiences. The final logistics 

are being worked out for the production of this film. In fact, our company AB 

Corp is also looking at the possibility of doing a joint venture with Percept 

Picture Company (PPC) for this film.

Percept on its part confirmed the chances of AB Corp 

coming on board. Says Mahesh Ramanathan, chief operating officer of PPC: The 

fact that AB Corp and Percept Picture Company could be partners on this just shows 

the true potential of the film. Shailendra Singh, joint managing director of 

Percept Holdings, adds: We truly believe that Johnny Walker is Indias 

first cinema offering to the global entertainment consumer. It has the required 

emotion and drama where language will not be a barrier.

Johnny Walker is one of many ideas that Shoojit 

has been working on after Yahaan. When Amarjeet couldnt take off 

due to casting problems, he started working on a thriller set in a forest and 

a coming-of-age love story written by Gulzar. Those projects are still on but 

in an industry like Bollywood you never know which project takes off first, says 

Shoojit. When I narrated the script of Johnny Walker to Mr Bachchan, he 

was very excited and here we are ready to roll.

It will not be the first time that Shoojit will be 

directing Bachchan, as the boy from Barrackpore has made most of the Cadburys 

commercials with him including the current on-air ad of Miss Palampur. But 

making a film with him is indeed the opportunity of a lifetime, adds Shoojit. 

Bhebei bhishon bhalo lagchhe. And believe you me, the man has become so 

much more agile after his hospitalisation. I dont know why others are saying 

hes still unwell because I found him to be so much fitter!

Not keen to reveal details of the story, Shoojit says: 

The concept here is more important. Johnny Walker is about this love story 

which begins where most love stories end. It questions how far you can go for 

love. It is about a 60-year-old couple discovering love all over again many years 

after they had first fallen in love. It is a very emotional tale of relationships 

with the man coming full circle at the end of it all.

 Shoojit Sircar

While Bachchans leading lady has not yet been finalised, 

Shoojit is in talks with Vidya Balan. She will be able to pull off both the age 

groups very well, he says. She will be herself as the young girl and then with 

make-up, she will be made to look like the older lady.

For Bachchans young days though, Shoojit wants to 

cast a different actor altogether. We will place the whole project in front of 

Abhishek as a separate actor and hope he likes it, he reveals. We do not want 

him to do the film just because his father is doing it or because AB Corp may 

come on board.

The screenplay of Johnny Walker has been penned 

by Rensil DSilva, who co-wrote Rang De Basanti with Prasoon Joshi. Jakob 

Ihre, who shot Yahaan, will shoot this film too, adds Shoojit. It is 

going to be a very beautiful-looking film shot mainly in Shimla and Manali. We 

will also shoot in Dalhousie, Delhi and Agra.

Johnny Walker will go on the floors in March 

2007 and release later in the year.

 Colour their kingdom

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 A swank sofa set is the last thing on your mind and a fancy bedcover is out of the question.

 For, your little ones invariably prefer the drawing room or your bedroom to their room during playtime and you have no choice but to admire furniture and expensive bed sheets in magazines and showrooms and comfort yourself with once they are grown up phrases.

 Have you ever wondered why your tiny one likes to spend fun time out of his/her own room? 

 Well, simply because their room with a computer, a study table piled with books, pencils and cupboards stacked with clothes add up to routine rather than fun, study rather than playground.

l you need is to add that dash of colour and cheer to get your children to love their room at all times of the day. Cute little seaters and cushions at Queen of Hearts in City Centre will help you do just that.

 Products of Soft Wonders, the imported seaters in fur will spoil you for choice. A nozzle below allows you to blow them up to form a short and cylindrical seater. 

 They look attractive and are comfortable to sit on too. From toddlers to 12 year olds, they find favour with all, smiles Deepa Seth from Queen of Hearts.

 The top resembles various cartoon characters ? Winnie the Pooh in bright yellow, Donald Duck with its orange beak and feet, Mr Mickey Mouse with his bright eyes popping out, and Miss Kitty all in Pink. A fluorescent green smiley with a broad grin has its red tongue sticking out. 

 The cow chooses to go the blue way with its horn all in orange. For little tykes, it could be the monkey or even the bull.

 These cloth stools are washable and space saving too. Place them in the nooks and corners to accentuate the look of your childs room and if needed squeeze out the air to put them away in your cupboard.

 Throw the folding cushions on window sills or the bed or display them as showpieces; they are sure to brighten up the room of toddlers or pre-teens.

 Colourful and attractive, they are made of suede. Each squarish cushion has a toon motif in the middle of the top edge. Once you fold it, they become soft toys. 

 It is a complete animal kingdom with a cushion in an electric red-black combo and a beetle on top, a bunny smiling away to glory and a dog with its bright eyes.

 A hen with a bright red crown and orange beak has feather-like extensions at the back. A cheerful giraffe sits on a cushion with irregular brown spots all over. These are washable too.

 So, liven up their room and dress up yours.

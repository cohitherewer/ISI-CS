 Moscow-based tea merchant Sajjan Sharma, 32, and his septuagenarian father Mohanlal were taken into custody as they landed at Calcutta airport on Wednesday morning, on charges of causing the death of Sajjans wife Ambika.

 The two were carrying with them Ambikas body.

 We have arrested Sajjan and his father following a complaint from Ambikas father Dindayal, who alleged that his daughter was tortured for dowry and killed, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Ambika, mother of two-year-old twins, died reportedly after falling off the kitchen window of her 10th-floor apartment in Moscow on July 25. 

 A B.Com graduate from Ranchis Marwari College, Ambika was married to Sajjan on April 3, 2003.

 Sajjans parents live in Dum Dum and Ambikas in Ranchi. According to Kumar, Dum Dum police are contacting their counterparts in Moscow through the Union home ministry and the ministry of external affairs to get details of the incident.

 On the night of July 25, a man identifying himself as Ambikas neighbour in Moscow informed her parents that she had died in a fall from her apartment.

 The parents immediately called Ambikas in-laws, but no one responded. On July 26, they went to lodge an FIR with Kotwali police station in Ranchi. The FIR, however, was not accepted as the death had taken place in Moscow.

 We know for sure that she was killed by her husband, as we were unable to meet his demands for dowry, alleged Ambikas cousin Amit Sharma, who has arrived from Ranchi.

 According to him, Sajjan used to torture Ambika regularly, asking for cash to prop his business. Once, he even demanded a flat in Moscow and an imported car, said Ambikas brother Basant.

 Sajjan denied the charges. She just fell off the window when I was not there. We have two beautiful children. Why should I kill her? he asked.

 Hit or miss: Cars 

 pass by the toll plaza on Vidyasagar Setu before the 

 collection passed into private hands 

 The report ?Toll plaza turns private? 

 seems to suggest that Vidyasagar Setu remains abysmally 

 underutilised more than a decade after its opening. Ironically, 

 the bridge was built in the hope that it would reduce the 

 load on Howrah bridge. 

 It was also thought that construction of the bridge would trigger development in Howrah. But projects around the bridge were sporadic. It could be due to the low number of vehicles using the bridge. The step-motherly treatment to the twin city had resulted in waste of the money spent on Vidyasagar Setu. 

 If the annual toll collection was only Rs 11 crore, then the staff of the toll plaza was surely involved in malpractices of unimaginable magnitude. Even if several cars flaunted the beacon to evade toll and truck drivers sped past, the collection could not have dropped to such levels. It is possible that duplicate coupons were being issued from the toll plaza. I don?t think the authorities tried to prevent such practices or were, perhaps, hand in glove with the corrupt officials. 

 SMSL-IRD must have checked the data before offering a huge sum for the right to collect toll from the bridge. They will still make a neat profit due to rise in the movement of vehicles because of development on both sides of the bridge. It is difficult to believe that HRBC, which executes huge contracts, failed to manage a toll plaza. Such inefficiency cannot be excused.

 Apropos the report ?Home alone, charred?, April 7, what could possibly be more shocking than an elderly widow being burnt in an apartment where she was locked by her family members, while they were out on work? No words are strong enough to condemn the callousness and cruelty of her family members.

 That smoking causes health hazards has been known for some time (Smoking kills the kidneys, April 6). What is more alarming is that the campaign to stop people from smoking has proved useless. The bar on the sale of cigarettes has proved ineffectual. We should not forget that many smokers in our country are poor. It is not possible for them to go for regular medical check-ups or undergo expensive treatment. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala.

 Apropos the report ?Warrant against Bhutia?, April 7, lack of respect for law has become quite common. Such activities should not be allowed to continue. Obedience of the court is the foundation of democracy. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Apropos the report ?Today?s story in yesterday?s colour?, April 6, in this age of colour films, it is definitely a big challenge to make a film in black and white. It would have been nice if a photograph of cinematographer Abhik Mukhopadhyay accompanied those of the stars. 

 Prantik Sanyal, 

 Address not given. 

 Apropos the report ?Death rap on builder?, April 3, it is unfortunate that three labourers were killed in a building site. I request the contractor concerned to compensate their kin. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia . 

 The picture of the dead birds captioned ?Caged plight?, April 3, hurt me deeply. The murder of the tender creatures at Narkeldanga police station rips the mask off human brutality. Urbanisation has taken a heavy toll on the flora and fauna. Isn?t it also our duty to protect nature? The farcical name ?rescue centre? seems a rude joke. 

 Rima Choudhury,

 Behala.

 The living fledglings in the 

 pictures, with green plumage, red beak, large head and eyes 

 are Alexandrine Parakeet (Psittacula eupatria, in 

 local parlance pahadi chandana), and not Rose Ringed 

 Parrots as claimed in the caption. Attaining puberty, the 

 male Alexandrine Parakeet develop a red and black ring on 

 the neck (collar). Many believe Alexander the Great brought 

 this species to India, as it is found along the path that 

 the great warrior took. Rose Ring Parrots (Psittacula 

 krameri, in local parlance tiya) are smaller 

 in size (42 cm) than Alexandrine Parakeet (53 cm) and lack 

 the distinctive maroon patches on wings. 

 Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar. 

 Apropos the report ?Click to access little magazine?, April 3, little magazines have been breeding ground of many gifted Bengali writers. Hence, the project by three software professionals to preserve the Bengali little magazines is wonderful. 

 The website will surely be a success among Bengalis in all parts of the world. NRIs, especially, will welcome the initiative. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake.

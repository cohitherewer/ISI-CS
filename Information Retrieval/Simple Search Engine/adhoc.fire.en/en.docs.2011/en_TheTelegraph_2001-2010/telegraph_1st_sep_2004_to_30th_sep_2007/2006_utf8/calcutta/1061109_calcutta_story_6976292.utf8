 The divergent practices of the young and not-so-young artists from all over India come to the fore at the exhibition, Concepts amp; Ideas, that opened at CIMA Gallery on Wednesday evening. 

 Whereas Yusuf and Mohan Singhane from Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal still paint or draw on canvas or paper (notwithstanding the young Singhanes installation created specifically for this show), Jitish Kallat and Subodh Gupta (both hot properties) use an idiom in international currency.

 Mona Rai is a painter, but she does not hesitate to use a thread and needle to achieve the effect she strives for which is quite startling. Together, they create an impression that contemporary Indian art practice registers the same tugs and pulls that the country and its deeply-entrenched traditions is being subjected to in a globalised 21st Century.

 Kallats Onomatopoeia/The Scar Park is a huge suite comprising 68 prints, its format imitating the multiple screens of a closed-circuit TV system. The prints show battered, scarred, dented, rusting sections of automobiles in Kallats continuing interest in the transport system. In two other acrylics on canvas, titled Rickshawpolis 6 and 7, buses, commuters, autorickshaws on a collision course hurtle down a road like Ganga descending on Shivas dreadlocks. 

 The two canvases are supported on brass waterspouts that one identifies with the Gothic Revival architecture of Mumbai.

 In a striking photographic shot of a Mumbai street, measuring 54.5 cm by 198 cm, where the artist is making a call at a phone booth, the frame is hemmed in by autorickshaws.

 Subodh Gupta from the Bihar heartland, creates objects of middle-class desire, such as an array of stainless steel kitchen utensils in a photorealist painting on canvas, and sculpture inspired by forms going by the dictates of toiletry and luxury car advertisements that one is bound to find on the dressing table and the sideboard of the modern Indian male.

 Drawing and graphic art are the forte of Yusuf. For this exhibition, he has created works on canvas some quite large with infinite, painstaking care. 

 Within a grid of horizontal lines, he produces forms that seem to be in a state of upheaval or are being subjected to violence. He produces this impression purely by using paint and ink.

 His colleague Mohan Singhanes installation belongs to an altogether different school of thought. Drawings with the minimum of forms is what this young artist is used to doing. Then, he suddenly thought of trying out installations. 

 He made it a point to pick up the skills of an electrician to body forth his thoughts. Inside a pitch-dark room, gradually one notices a set of dim blue lights that seem to shut and open their eyes. A bleary-eyed spotlight just about reveals the presence of a translucent panel on the wall. Without any recourse to gimmicks, Singhane creates various layers of darkness by the simplest of means.

 Mona Rais paintings, with their surface glitter of gold and silver, are actually an assault on the world of glamour and glitz. She bombards the spangled and mirror-studded surface that could have been painted with glossy nail varnish with a variety of colours from the feminine arsenal of cosmetics.

 The violence is quite obvious in one blood-splattered canvas. It is a grisly reminder of graffiti that serial killers often create with the blood of their victims.

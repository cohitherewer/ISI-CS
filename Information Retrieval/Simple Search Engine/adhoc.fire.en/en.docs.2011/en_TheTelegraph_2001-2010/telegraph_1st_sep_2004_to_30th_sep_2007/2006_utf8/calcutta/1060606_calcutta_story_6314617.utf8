The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 999 notches up a parity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The magic Higher Secondary (HS) figure of 999 on Monday brought a smile to students who had cleared the ISC and CBSE examinations last month and were waiting to slug it out with their HS counterparts for seats in city colleges.

 This year?s HS topper, from a school in Cooch Behar, scoring a record 999 out of 1000, could signal the end of the practice of deducting ?5 to 10 per cent marks? scored by ISC and CBSE examinees while competing with HS students for BA, B.Sc and B.Com seats.

 Hours after the HS 2006 results were declared, the authorities of various city colleges decided to abolish the HS vs rest marks divide. With students of the state boards scoring far higher marks these days ? almost on a par with other boards ? the case for deduction is lost.

 ?We may now have to stop the practice,? admitted Mamata Roy, principal, Presidency College. ?Our decision will be finalised once we complete the process of collecting the application forms for admission.?

 After scanning the HS results, Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), said: ?The fact that HS examinees are scoring high marks is an indication that a parity between the marking system followed by the ISC, CBSE and HS boards has been reached? That being the case, colleges would be doing an injustice to the ISC and CBSE students if they continue with the old system and deduct marks during the admission process.?

 A proposal to ask all its affiliated colleges to reconsider their admission procedures will be placed at the Calcutta University undergraduate council meeting later this week.

 ?There is no standing rule in the university that can debar any of its affiliate colleges from following its own admission procedure. But we will definitely not allow any college to be unfair to any student, whichever board they come from,? explained Das.

 The magic 999 marks scored by Subhankar Roy Chowdhury caused more than a few ripples in HS circles.

 Debashis Sarkar, secretary, West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, said under the present system every student must appear for five compulsory subjects, each carrying 200 marks.

 That adds up to 1000, but if a student takes an additional subject carrying 200 marks, a maximum of 140 can be added to the students? total marks.

 ?It is because of this system 

 that students are scoring so heavily when it comes to aggregate 

 marks,? Sarkar said.

 Party Time

 Time was turned back on Saturday 

 night to a more regal era as Sushmita Sen, looking glamorous 

 in a white cutwork outfit, unveiled a restaurant Hushh 

 and Kobe Sizzlers at City Centre. The former Miss Universe 

 sat inside a private enclosure separated by transparent 

 plastic blinds on the roof of the new party haunt as the 

 guests trickled in one by one.

 And just like a queen indulging 

 in jharokha darshan, our delightful diva was obliging 

 guests with a Hi or Hello, and charming 

 each one of them.

 Sanjeev Goenka, Bhaichung Bhutia, 

 Jisshu and Nilanjanaa, Bickram and Jaya Seal Ghosh, Raima 

 Sen they all had their special moments with Sushmita.

 Her father had been to my 

 concerts and Sushmita expressed her eagerness to listen 

 to my music, Bickram said.

 Goenkas Saregama is the 

 producer of Karma, Confessions amp; Holi, Sushmitas 

 next release, which stars ex-boyfriend Randeep Hooda.

 Sitting with Sushmita on Saturday, 

 though, was her man of the moment: ad film-maker Madhav 

 Menon. But daughter Renee, in her pink dress and red-framed 

 glasses, was the show stealer. 

 Hushh, positioned as an Italian 

 Resto Lounge amp; Bar, is one of the only eateries in town 

 to have a wooden oven for the pizza. And if you are not 

 feeling so Italian, you can always dig into the Kobe sizzlers, 

 part of Mumbais daily life since the Opera House outlet 

 came up in 1977.

 The two-in-one outlet belongs 

 to Rajat Dalmia, Sushmitas business partner.

 Back to Sush, the actress gave 

 a glimpse of her painting prowess by doing a quick sketch 

 of the facial contours of a goddess and signing Durga, 

 Durga in the corner. But it was Sushmitas presence 

 that made all the difference to the party.

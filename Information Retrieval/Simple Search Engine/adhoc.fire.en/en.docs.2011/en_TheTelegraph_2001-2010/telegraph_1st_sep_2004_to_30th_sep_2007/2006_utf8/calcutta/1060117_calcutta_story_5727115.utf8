What: Celebrations of Lohri, the north Indian 

festival.

 Where: The CC amp;FC lawns. 

 When: Saturday evening, 8 pm onwards. 

 The show: Lohri, one of the most popular north Indian festivals, was celebrated in true Punjabi style on this cool wintry evening. 

 A huge bonfire for the rituals and a traditional table spread of sugarcane, chidwa, popcorn, rewdi and peanuts were the top draws. 

 Charanjeet Singh with his troupe regaled the audience with famous folk numbers and contemporary commercial hits like Bolo tara rara and Dil le gayi. An enthusiastic audience that clapped along added to the revelry beats of Bhangra and Gidda.

 The ambience: The mood was festive and so was the decor. Flickering lanterns were placed on each table. Stacks of hay, a brick well and mashaals added up to the feel of a Punjab village. Some members dressed in bright traditional attire added colour to this joyous occasion.

Sip n bite: An elaborate food spread 

kept the members busy and happy. There were two counters by Astor, one serving 

a traditional platter with Sarson Da Saag, Makki Ki Roti, Gobi Mattar Aloo and 

chicken preparations, and the other catering to the Tandoori tastes of the guests. 

 A Gupta Brothers stall whipped up delicious chaats and fresh desserts like Jalebis and Gaajar Ka Halwa. The menu was planned keeping in mind both the authenticity as well as the diverse tastes of the members, explained Bitty Alexander, member-in-charge of the catering. 

 Voiceover: It is the very first time that CC amp;FC has celebrated Lohri. Honestly, this was just a try and we are overwhelmed by the response, said Deepankar Nandi, CEO and managing member of the south Calcutta club. 

 Dragon do

 What: Enter The Dragon 2006.

 Where: Swabhumi.

 When: Sunday evening, 5 pm onwards. 

 The show: It was the very first time that the Chinese community was performing outside China Town, claimed the participants. An effort that went down well with close to a thousand people ? both Chinese and Indian ? flocking to catch a glimpse of the cultural programme. Songs by a Chinese band kick-started the show. 

 Typical Chinese cultural highlights like the Dragon Dance, Lion Dance and Fans Dance enthralled the spectators for hours on end. Children from Pei Moi School also performed. 

 Apart from the cultural show, there were some stalls displaying authentic Chinese stuff. Sing Cheung and Pou Chong exhibited an exotic collection of sauces. 

 so on sale was a selection of ceramic gift items ranging from Rs 90 to Rs 3,100. The Buddhas Light International Association put up a stall of traditional trinkets like bracelets and pendants. 

 Most of these items are of Chinese jade and nuts and are all handmade, said Ben Won from the association.

 Voiceover: We stepped out of China Town this year only to project our culture and establishment. It is heartening to see the support we have got from the people, said Michelle Hsu, secretary of the Indian Chinese Association.

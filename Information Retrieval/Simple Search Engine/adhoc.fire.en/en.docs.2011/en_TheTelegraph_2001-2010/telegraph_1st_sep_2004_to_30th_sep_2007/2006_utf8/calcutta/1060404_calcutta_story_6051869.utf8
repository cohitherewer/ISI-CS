 Inspired by A Ramachandran, the paintings of Bhagat Singh celebrate nature with an exuberance that has become a hallmark of his creative expression. Celebrating Nature, the ongoing exhibition of his recent art works, reveals a mature style that can be described as a combination of the miniature tradition and his own technique of exaggerating forms to give an impression of fantasy. An abundant display of flora and fauna indicates an awesome surfeit of nature?s offerings. Singh brings to his canvases a pleasing sense of design where fruits, flowers and birds appear enjoined in a joyous choreography. His use of colours shows an unbridled vivacity, where brilliant reds, yellows and greens overwhelm the senses with their bold saturation. His images of fantasy are, however, touched with an element of irony in interpretation. Coiled creepers, sinuously spreading across the canvas, recall unpleasant parallels that disturb the atmosphere of peace and serenity to be found in nature?s fold.

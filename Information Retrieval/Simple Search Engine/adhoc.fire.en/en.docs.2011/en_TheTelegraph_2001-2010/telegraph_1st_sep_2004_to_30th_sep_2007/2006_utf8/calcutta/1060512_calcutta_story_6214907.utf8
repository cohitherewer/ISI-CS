The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

No-no to show-show

Screen On amp; Off

 Neha Dhupia with Kareena 

 Kapoor in Chup Chup Ke, and (below) in Julie

 A couple of years back she (back)started the skin flick brigade with her tantalising backless posters drawing roving eyeballs to every wall in town. And when Julie became a hit, Neha Dhupia became the first of a series of Bollywood actresses ? Meghna Naidu, Payal Rohatgi, Monalisa ? ready to trade their clothes for box-office glory.

 But now that the skin show has sunk at the turnstiles, Neha has switched gears. The salwars and kurtis are back on her and the in-your-face sex appeal has been conveniently replaced by a coy crinkle-of-the-eye smile.

 ?As of now, it?s (skin show) a no-no,? she spells it out to Metro. ?It has been a conscious choice to do a different kind of cinema after Julie and Sheesha. That?s the fun thing about being an actor, the ability to be able to do a variety of roles.?

 So, after doing a cameo in the Harry Baweja dud Teesri Aankh starring Ameesha Patel, Neha is again playing second fiddle ? to Kareena Kapoor ? in Priyadarshan?s forthcoming comedy Chup Chup Ke. ?Being in a film with other actresses (there?s Sushama Reddy as well) has never been a problem since all of us have our own distinctive characters,? she reasons. ?Also, we keep hearing about heroine rivalry on the sets. But it was great acting with Kareena. There was never a dull moment and there was no reason to complain.?

 Fortunately, Neha does all the talking in the film since Kareena?s character is mute and Neha the screen cousin has to interpret all her thoughts. Chup Chup Ke also finds Neha doing her second out-and-out comedy after last year?s Balaji hit Kya Kool Hai Hum.

 ?It?s about love meeting confusion and then confusion meeting love. But how all that happens I can?t reveal before the release,? smiles the actress who plays the Gujarati girl Meenakshi in the film.

 This is also not the first time that Neha is working with director Priyadarshan. ?We worked together in Garam Masala,? she reminds us. ?And although it was a less meatier role than the one I have in Chup Chup Ke, it was a lot of fun. Priyanji has this knack of making humour out of simple things in life and although his characters might play along with lots of seriousness, the audience finds it funny.?

 After Chup Chup Ke, Neha will be seen in more fun films. First up will be Sanjay Khadari?s comic thriller Ek Chalis Ki Last Local opposite Abhay Deol. Then she will be seen alongside Jimmy Sheirgill in the Shivaji Ganeshan Productions venture Delhi Heights, which has created quite a buzz with Rabbi Shergill writing and composing the music for the film.

 Neha has also shot for Kumar Sanu?s home production Utthan directed by Ujjwal Chatterjee and co-starring Priyanshu Chatterjee. ?I can?t talk about that film, can we move on to some other question,? is Neha?s fiery reaction to questions about the movie. Can that have something to do with her character in the film being inspired from Jessica Lal?

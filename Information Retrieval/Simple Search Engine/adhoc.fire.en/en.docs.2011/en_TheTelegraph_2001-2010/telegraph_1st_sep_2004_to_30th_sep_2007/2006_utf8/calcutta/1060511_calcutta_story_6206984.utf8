 Humiliated at being made to stand outside her classroom, an 18-year-old girl took her life by jumping off the sixth floor of her school building in central Calcutta on Wednesday afternoon.

 According to police, Archana Arora 

 , in Class XII of Seth Surajmal Jalan Balika Vidyalaya, 

 had gone to drink water before the second period began at 

 12.15 pm, accompanied by three classmates. When the four 

 returned around 12.25 pm, the English class was already 

 in progress.

 ?The teacher denied them permission to enter the classroom as they were late. They were told to stand outside. After a while, Archana told her friends she was feeling unwell. She went to the sixth floor and jumped,? Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central) said.

 The school authorities said it was a shocking incident but the teacher should not be blamed for the girl?s death. Nandalal Singhania, secretary of the school, admitted that Archana and her friends were not allowed entry into the classroom as the class had already started. ?She was a brilliant student, loved by all,? Singhania added.

 Archana had topped the Madhyamik examination from her school. Her fees were waived as her father had died a few years ago and the family was facing financial difficulties.

 The world of the Aroras came crashing down again around 12.30 pm on Wednesday, when on hearing a thud, the school durwan noticed the girl sprawled on the floor, her head smashed. Archana, the youngest of four siblings, was rushed to Shree Vishudhanand Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. Her mother, Veena, wailed inconsolably at the hospital.

 ?She prayed before leaving for 

 school at 10.30 am... Around 1 pm, I got a call on my mobile 

 from the school saying Archana had jumped. I do not know 

 what prompted her to kill herself,? cried Veena.

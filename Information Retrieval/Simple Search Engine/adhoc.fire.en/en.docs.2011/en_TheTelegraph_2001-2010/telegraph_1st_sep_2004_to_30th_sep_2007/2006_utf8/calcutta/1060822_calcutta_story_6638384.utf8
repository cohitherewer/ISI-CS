The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Young Metro

 No bar on speaking up

 Aregular classroom. Students from 

 different departments were in attendance. Along with them, 

 sitting on the back benches, were two professors. In the 

 teachers chair was a student, reading out his research 

 paper on Lennon. His friend sat next to him, taking notes 

 on the laptop. Welcome to the Derozian community, learn 

 to question, read a discoloured poster inside the classroom.

 A seminar on Class, Gender and 

 Genre organised by the history department of Presidency 

 College was as different as expected. Conducted by students 

 of the department, the session covered a range of topics 

 from terrorism to John Lennon as a working class hero.

 Debak Das, who spoke on terrorism, 

 discussed the gender bias in the world of terror. He pointed 

 out that a few of the terrorist groups like LTTE have female 

 members, though the number is strikingly small. On the other 

 hand, the Islamic terrorist groups hardly recruit women. 

 In the question session, he stressed that though many terrorists 

 are Muslims, all Muslims are not terrorists.

 Talking on the amalgamation of 

 art and commercial films, Madhumanti Rakshit pointed out 

 that the demarcation in the types of films is nothing 

 but a forced thin line. Another participant, Debarshi, spoke 

 about the revolution in John Lennons songs and how he 

 tried to become a working class hero but eventually failed.

 The first seminar of the kind 

 in the history department of Presidency College was organised 

 in 1908 and the tradition has been carried on ever since.

 But should these talk sessions 

 be included in the syllabus? Not at all. That would become 

 a burden at times. Also, formalising such talks will make 

 them uninteresting, said Benjamin Zachariah, a former student 

 of the colleges history department and presently a professor 

 at Sheffields.

 The seminars are an opportunity 

 for the students to express their views on various topics. 

 Even those who come up with questions for the speakers at 

 the end of each session do a lot of research on the topics. 

 We encourage such talk sessions 

 as these help in personality development, said Jayati Mukherjee, 

 head of the history department.

 Fun with friends

 How many Disney characters do you know? was 

 the question asked to an eight-year-old at Masti ki Pathsala 

 held at Mahadevi Birla Girls School on August 8. With 

 a know-all smile on her face she rattled off the names. 

 And the list seemed unending. At the meet there were many 

 more like her who were growing up with Disney with 

 Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, Pooh, Donald Duck, and of 

 course Goofy.

 As part of Disneys largest-ever school contact programme, 

 students from 75 city schools in the age group of six to 

 14 will get to watch the audio-visual promos of the channels 

 programmes like Thats so Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Suite 

 Life of Zack and Cody, Recess and American Dragon: Jack 

 Long with their friends. The children at Mahadevi Birla 

 took part in a quiz contest and game shows with plenty of 

 prizes on offer (picture above by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya). 

 Each kid was gifted a kit with an animated timetable chart, 

 stickers, posters, show cards and other goodies.

 The most enjoyable event was an on-the-spot contest where 

 the children shared jokes and mimicked people. The 

 whole idea is to let the children enjoy with their best 

 of friends around, said K. Seshasaye, head, corporate 

 communications, Walt Disney Company (India) Pvt Ltd.

 Programmes like Masti ki Pathsala are tools for the channel 

 to reach out to the new-age tech-savvy children through 

 Disney characters.

 I-Day revelry

 Delhi Public School Newtown celebrated 59 years of Indias 

 independence on August 15 with a programme by students of 

 classes IV-VIII. The programme, conducted by Godavari House, 

 started with the flag hoisting ceremony followed by the 

 national anthem.

 In her welcome address to the audience, principal Ruma Chandra 

 said: We should take pride in being an Indian. Its 

 high time we refrained from blaming the system. Each of 

 us has to try and make a difference in our small way.

 Next up were melodious renditions of popular patriotic songs 

 like Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo and Muktir Mandir Sopan Tole. 

 Then there were dance performances by the students set to 

 Nanha Munna Rahi Hoon and Des Mera Rangeela. The students 

 also put up a hilarious skit in Bengali, titled Aikatan, 

 which left the audience in splits. The programme ended with 

 the national anthem sung by the school choir with the audience 

 joining in.

 Antiquity appeal

 At 21, Milinda Banerjee shows the signs of a scholar in 

 the making. A former La Martiniere student, he secured an 

 astounding 562 out of 800 in the history honours examination 

 of Calcutta University, appearing from Presidency College. 

 The 70.25 per cent in history is one of CUs highest 

 marks in recent years.

 Milinda is one of the very bright students of our 

 college in recent times. He has a brilliant academic record, 

 said Bhaskar Chakraborty, a senior history professor of 

 CU.

 Milinda aspires to research in history and philosophy because 

 of his innate interest in antiquity, particularly Rome and 

 Greece. He plans to study Raja of Rabindranath Tagore in 

 the context of Rome.

 Besides Bengali and English, Milinda has already completed 

 his superior diploma course in French language and is now 

 learning ancient Greek and Latin at Jadavpur University. 

 He has already read Baudelaire and Rimbaud in French.

 Stage symphony

 He dropped out of his postgraduate media studies because 

 he was too busy designing music for a play. 

 Two years later theatre music is still what Satrajit Sarkar 

 wants to do. From live and recorded music for intimate space 

 presentations like Sanchayan Ghoshs Holocaust Studio 

 and Otri Rays No Future No Thank You to composing 

 the haunting background score of Bratya Basus Hemlat, 

 Prince of Garanhata, the 27-year-olds career has been 

 unbelievably exciting.

 Music had been a passion right from school and the love 

 for theatre he had inherited from a grandfather. Learning 

 guitar from Vikramjit Banerjee of Krosswindz, he began the 

 classic rock band Dizzy Trips which gave way to Shinny Happy 

 People. I knew Bratyada (Basu) from school, as an 

 awfully strict Bengali teacher. But because theatre was 

 a common area of interest it was easy to get into his good 

 books. In 2000, I joined him in a play called Sahar Yaar 

 as a guitar player, but soon Bratyada had left the entire 

 job of designing music to me, recalled Satrajit.

 Composing music for theatre has a lot to do with visualising 

 what the writer or director wants. Often, it may be necessary 

 to change the feel of music as the directors vision 

 alters. Unlike the cerebral Hemlat, satires like Page 

 4 and Operation 2010 offer scope for kinky experiments, 

 but I believe in loops in which simple notes can depart 

 and return, Satrajit explained.

 He however rues the lack of proper equipment in most theatres 

 today. What does it take, just a mixer and some imported 

 speakers? Surely the private and government halls can afford 

 it since they do charge quite a bit for the shows? 

 asks Satrajit.

 Conflict amp; compatibility quotient

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Among the most frequently asked questions in Feng Shui is the one that relates to the compatibility and the clash of persons having different animal signs. Chinese astrology divides the 12 animal signs in four groups comprising three animals each. It is amazing how there is a similarity between each animal sign within the same group.

 Compatibility between people having signs of the animals in each group is clearly visible because they not only think alike, their natures also complement each other. As a result they complement and bring out the best from friends in their group. 

 Similarly, there are six sets of animals comprising two in each group, which clash with each other. When such a clash occurs in any particular year, the outcome is not a very happy one.

 So while looking for a match or a business partner, it is advisable to go for favourable animal signs and avoid getting into any relationship where the animal signs clash with each other. 

 Rat, Monkey and Dragon: This is the first favourable group. The Monkey is always restless and very clever but lacks intelligence. Rats on the other hand are witty and intelligent, which they pass on to the Monkey. Rats are basically insecure and tend to hoard while the Dragon is courageous and confident and thus complements the Rats requirement. Since Dragon people are rigid and stubborn, they would do well to derive some intelligence and flexibility from Rats.

 Snake, Rooster and Ox: Form the next favourable group where they are considered to be intelligent and have the ability to foresee the future. They are strong personalities and have the power to captivate their audience. The movement of the Ox is limited and is destined to monotonous hard labour. The Snake on the other hand is very flexible. When both of them join hands, the Ox can benefit from the flexible qualities of the Snake while the slimy Snake gets to derive some stability from the Ox. The Rooster always carries the know-it-all attitude and is more into showing off. He lacks diplomacy and stability in life. It is only when he comes in to contact with his favourable partners Snake and Ox that he learns the ways to deal with the world.

 Horse, Dog and Tiger: Is the third favourable group where the three animals are independent and do not like to be controlled. The Horse is ambitious and loves to gallop towards success. But they are slow starters and need the Tigers aggressiveness to move them forward. Tigers are ferocious and need to be calmed down by the good nature of the Dog. To achieve his goals, the Dog needs the determination of the Tiger.

 Rabbit, Sheep and Pig: form the last group of favourable animals. They are all soft spoken, highly popular, sympathetic and go out of their way to please others. They are not inclined to take risks and lack intelligence and craftiness. Pigs are strong and they provide strength to both Sheep and the mild Rabbit. Sheep are generous and have herd mentality while the Rabbit are good planners. Hence the Rabbit safeguards the Sheep from doing wrong acts. 

 Clashes between people with different animal signs are as follows:

 Horse and Rat: The Horse needs free reigns to gallop away while the insecure Rat who is always trying to hide in his hole is unable to tolerate the Horses impulsive nature.

 Ox and Sheep: Ox is a strong animal and has no time to waste on emotions, while the Sheep is extremely emotional and sentimental. Since both have opposite tendencies they both feel that the other is wrong.

 Tiger and Monkey: Both the Tiger and the Monkey are strong but they do not like each other because they both think that the other is smarter. Even the roaring and ferocious Tiger is no match to the clever and crafty Monkey.

 Rooster and Rabbit: Since Roosters are arrogant and conceited, they have a clash with Rabbits who hold high moral values. The Rabbit feels that the Rooster is a useless show off while the Rooster thinks that the Rabbit unnecessarily portrays a wrong virtuous image.

 Dragon and Dog: The Dragon is always at loggerheads with the Dog as the Dragon is impulsive and has his own ideas and can not accept interference from the Dog. The Dog, on the other hand, is always cautious and will take decisions after a deep thought. The Dragon takes quick decisions and has no time to waste on the Dog. The Dragon thinks that the Dog is non co-operative.

 Snake and Pig: The basic difference between the two is that the Snake considers itself to be stylish and very confident. The Snake misinterprets the Pigs cool and good nature and thinks that he is dumb and weak. It is the Pigs bad luck that despite being humble, polite and kind-hearted he is totally misunderstood by the Snake.

 A darker, tougher, streetwise James Bond is about to be unveiled to the world, and Casino Royale director Martin Campbell is convinced that Daniel Craig will win over a new generation of fans with a stunning performance as 007. 

 Campbell, 65, was born in New Zealand and moved to the UK to work as a cameraman. He cut his directorial teeth on British films like Eskimo Nell and Three For All in the early 70s before working on acclaimed British TV series like The Professionals, Minder and The Edge of Darkness. 

 By the 1990s, Campbell was making his way to Hollywood, first directing television shows and then features. He followed GoldenEye with The Mask of Zorro and more recently, the sequel, The Legend of Zorro. His other films include Vertical Limit and Beyond Borders. 

 Were you involved in the process of choosing Daniel 

 Craig as James Bond?

 Oh yes, we all had to agree on who would be Bond Barbara (Broccoli, producer) Michael (Wilson, producer) all of us. I mean, we saw a lot of people. There was endless speculation about it but we had to go through everyone and we tested a lot of people and there were other names mentioned and finally it came back to Daniel. We knew he was the right man for the job; it was as simple as that. 

 What did you like about Daniel? 

 Well, for a start, hes obviously a very, very good actor. And another reason was that he fitted the concept we had and he certainly fitted the book and the more realistic approach much better than anybody else. Casino Royale is a rather interesting book. Its his (Ian Fleming) first book, written in 1953, and it was set in the Cold War with Smersh involved Flemings version of the KGB. It was a very realistic book, too. It doesnt feature outrageous situations, outrageous action and Bond is very real, too. He is not the tuxedo wearing, womanising master spy that we have been given in the movies. 

 So hes not the sophisticate we know now? 

 No, hes not and basically he has just been given his first task having been given his 007 status and he is still a bit green around the edges. For example, he has to kill someone and the killing is tough and its messy and he finds it very disturbing. And its also interesting in the book, he drinks way too much and he smokes about 70 cigarettes a day! 

 So he is vulnerable and a dark character and has a dark side to him. He doesnt find it easy. Hes very much a misogynist and explains why in the book actually theres a very good description of why he detests affairs and he actually talks about the steps you go through and its so true, how it all ends up leaving a nasty taste in your mouth. And, of course, Fleming at the time was about to be married to a woman he didnt want to be married to so all of that sort of fed into the book.

 lWere there performances of Daniels that convinced you he was your Bond?

 Well, Layer Cake has a certain charm about it despite being about drugs. He is very charming in it. And normally you associate him with slightly heavier roles like Enduring Love, The Mother, Sylvia, and actually I thought Munich was one of the best things hes done although hes hardly got a line in it. Hes bursting with vitality in that role; hes there and you cant help but watch him. And as Ive said, this Bond had to be darker and Daniel can convey that, rather like (Sean) Connery in a way, he has that dark quality and Connery had it that presence on the screen of someone who could definitely take care of himself.

 And do other contemporary movies feed into that decision 

 that Bond has to reinvent itself? 

 They are up-to-date movies. I love The Bourne Supremacy and Paul Greengrass is a very talented director, he has that documentary style which gives it a great sense of realism. But, yes, theres that to think about. Also, I think Cubby Broccoli (producer of most of the Bond movies) always wanted to make Casino Royale so that was one of his passions to get the rights to the book and make a movie but he died before that was possible. So Barbara and Michael saw it had become available and leapt on it. 

 What was Daniel Craig like? 

 He turned out to be very good indeed. I mean, to begin with he buffed up and he trained and he looked great. But I think there was a little bit of a learning curve in the way you do action, the way you shoot action, the way its done. But once he was in the rhythm he was great and hes done a fantastic job. 

 And you have to commit.. 

 Yes, you do. So all of those guys had very much the standard image of Bond that we know from the films. But now we go back to the books and thats different. If you read the books you will find that he is a darker character who does have an inner conflict. He has a lot of demons and he has a lot of vices and he does get beaten up. So its a very different thing. And I think Dan has this rugged good-looking quality and he has the darker side, the tougher side that we wanted for the part. 

 His relationship with Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) sounds 

 like its crucial to shaping the man... 

 Yes, thats all in the book and in the film. Its all about that. And it very much shapes him. At the end of it he becomes Bond, the one that we all know. And we do things that play into the myths. He asks for a Martini for example, but he doesnt say shaken not stirred but he lists the ingredients, which is in the book. Its this with this and a touch of lemon... So there are one or two embryonic moments as to how these things started. 

 Youve had some valuable inputs from Paul Haggis 

 (writer-director of Crash)... 

 Yes, and hes a very, very good writer and one of the things he did was beef up Ms part, so Judi (Dench) had a lot more to do in this which she was pleased about. Shes wonderful. Shes out of the office a bit more this time. She went to The Bahamas and Prague and she has a good part. Its very, very good to see her and Daniel together. 

 What are you like on set? 

 I think Im quite calm, actually. I mean, I yell and I scream but I do it not in an angry way, I do it because I like a lot of energy and I like people moving and getting on with it. 

 There are, as always with Bond, some beautiful actresses 

 in the movie... 

 Well, Caterina Murino, who is a lovely actress, plays Solange and her purpose in the Bond is to show how Bond can be kind of chauvinistic in the way that he uses women in the sense that he will take them to bed to get information out of them and then leave them, thats his attitude going in. She plays the wife of a guy who works with Le Chiffre and Bond knows that he can use her to get to him. 

 So hes quite cynical in the way that he uses her... 

 Exactly. And thats the point. With Eva Greens character, Vesper Lynd, he meets someone who changes his life. She gets to him in a way that no woman ever has and changes his life because he falls in love with her. 

 Thats a big role. What was she like? 

 Eva was fantastic. It was interesting because we had approached a few better-known actresses but then we went to Eva and I was amazed at how good she was. Her English is amazing and she has no accent at all. We tested her and she was very nervous in the test but I knew instinctively that she was the right actress. The Vesper character is very enigmatic and is a major, major part. This is not a Bond girl, this is serious stuff. 

 Is it possible to forget that its a Bond movie while 

 you are making it? 

 Oh I do, the actual Bond thing doesnt affect me at all, its making a film, the drama that affects me. And you know as much as this is a Bond film its also a love story, its about a relationship and that has to work and that has to be right and it is, I think. On that level we have great chemistry.

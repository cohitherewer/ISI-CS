An animation roadshow, possibly the first in the country, is set to hit the city on Friday. Organised by Growel Academy, which, with the help of Aditi Multimedia, recently opened its city branch on Park Street, the roadshow will traverse Calcutta every Friday, Saturday and Sunday till July. 

 According to the plan, professional counsellors will move around offering advice on careers in animation. The vehicles used for the purpose will be fitted with computers to allow prospective candidates a glimpse of the selections of international animation projects undertaken by Digikore Studios, whose training unit is Growel Academy.

 The counsellors will visit schools, colleges, caf?s, multiplexes, theatres, shopping malls and housing estates to reach out to a wide number of people. To make things interesting, quiz contests will be arranged with winners getting a 10 per cent discount on animation courses (3D Studio MAX and Maya), costing about Rs 75,000. Students enrolling for courses at Aditi Multimedia will also be eligible for a 10 per cent discount. 

 ?The animation industry is set to explode and there is need for lakhs of well-trained professionals in the near future,? said Aditi Agarwal, CEO, Aditi Multimedia. ?Our roadshow will focus on how animation and graphics play an important role in our daily lives and how the youth can have an exciting career by becoming an animator or a graphic/web designer.?

 According to her, Indian animators are in demand the world over for their calibre and low fees. A lot of animation work is being outsourced to India and as per Nasscom estimates, over 50,000 animation and multimedia professionals are immediately needed in the country. With production houses mushrooming in eastern India, there are rewarding careers awaiting the students, claimed Agarwal. 

 Growel Academy, part of a Rs 250-crore group, has over 12 training centres in India. The Calcutta unit marks its foray in the east. Encouraged by the responses to animation film festivals in Nagpur (March) and Chandigarh (April), the company is planning film shows in the city this July.

 ?The films were all made for foreign production houses. They would have never been shown in India. We had to get special rights to screen them here,? stated Agarwal.

 Among the attractions are Little Amadeus, an animated TV series presented by a leading German production house on the 250th birth anniversary of Mozart.

 A journey of impressions and expressions through music and poetry, Raga and Rasa presents an original, creative exploration of the myriad moods, ideas and sensitivities associated with love, passion, happiness, separation and sadness. Featuring Dr Sudeshna Basu (picture left) and Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee (picture below), it offers evocative renditions of some of our most private, intimate thoughts and emotions in melody and verse. Basu will illustrate the variation of raga Behag in Tagores compositions through her songs, a theme she has examined in her most recent music album. Chatterjee will articulate his expressions through the works of eminent poets including Nirendranath Chakraborty, Subodh Sarkar, Edmund Ortiz and Malini Bhagat.

 Event: A music and poetry collage presented by Dr Sudeshna Basu and Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee 

When: Today at 6.45 pm 

Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

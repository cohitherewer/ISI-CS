 Tie-ups add to Puja thrill

 Four days are not enough. Corporate Bengal wants more of Durga puja. The autumnal festival may be the biggest advertising opportunity in eastern India, but the platform is getting too crowded.

 This year, I got offers seeking promotional tie-ups for visarjan, smiles Suman Chatterjee, president of Babubagan Club, Dhakuria. The arrangement may not have worked out this time but he is certain that this will come to pass. 

 What is already working, and rocking many a pandal, is sponsored Vijaya Sammelani. 

 We used to hold a small gathering where local artistes would sing and later we would dine together, recalls Samit Banerjee of Putiary Club puja committee. But Saturday the 14th had the south Calcutta locality rocking to the beats of Chandrabindoo, courtesy liquor giant McDowells. We could not afford such a big name. Our budget used to be just about Rs 15,000.

 Putiary Club is just one of the dozen-plus pandals in the state that hosted Chandrabindoo as part of a corporate arrangement. And no one is complaining. 

 Residents are eager for such entertainment before returning to their daily chores after the Puja, Chatterjee explains. In return, the sponsor gets to hang his banner free at the puja site through the festive days right till the event.

 Anirban Ghosh, managing director of Idea Management, which conducts events on behalf of private firms, explains the logic behind the move: There are so many puja awards that it is possible to get crowded out. So, it makes sense to step into a virgin Puja territory.

 If the companies are sniffing around to use the Pujas in a yet-unused way, so are the Puja organisers. The 66 Pally Sarbojanin had launched a website and put prasad on sale there. The effort was not a success, but there is always next year.

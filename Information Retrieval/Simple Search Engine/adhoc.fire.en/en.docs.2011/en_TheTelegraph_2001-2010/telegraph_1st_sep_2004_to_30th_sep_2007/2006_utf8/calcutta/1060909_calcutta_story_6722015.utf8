Chhele Natabar

Every backbenchers worst enemy the first boy, teachers 

pet and headmasters well-fed nephew is the hero of Natun Chhele Natabar, 

setting the tone for Hanshi Rashi, the set of three new fun plays presented 

by Nandikar. To be staged on September 10 at Girish Mancha, starting 6 pm, are 

Natun Chhele Natabar (based on a story by Lila Majumdar) directed by Gautam 

Haldar, Ashapurna Devis Rater Kutum and Lila Majumdars Pakhi directed 

by Swatilekha Sengupta.

The three plays grew out of an ongoing theatre project 

on which Nandikar was working in association with Swedish organisation SIDA, 

Swatilekha Sengupta told Metro during rehearsals on Wednesday. Two other 

groups, one from Bangladesh and another from Mysore, are part of this project 

which encourages grown-ups to do plays for children that involve direct interaction 

with the young audience. This is the first time that adult members of Nandikar 

will be playing roles of children aged 5-12.

While Swatilekha wrote the scripts, designed music 

and directed Pakhi and Rater Kutum, the script of Natabar developed 

during rehearsals and only needed a little rearranging, said Gautam. Stories 

for childrens plays should be sweet and simple and I prefer not to burden them 

with too many messages. 

For childrens plays, Gautam felt, adults should delve 

into themselves to discover the child within and from there try to communicate 

with children.

For adult actors aged 22-40 to behave like junior 

schoolchildren is, of course, quite a challenge. I had to create the kind of 

atmosphere needed for the actors to shed their inhibitions and really act and 

think like children in particular situations. It wasnt that difficult we found, 

said Gautam.

Natabar uses a minimum of props a tiffin 

box, water bottle, a stool so it is up to the actors to recreate the story of 

Natabar (Sajan Srijan), the new boy on campus, using his physical prowess and 

cunning to get the better of bullying classmates

Pakhi is the tale of a disabled girl and a 

wounded wild goose. A lot of the narration is through songs and a bit of choreography 

is used to establish the idyllic Sonajhuri where reside red, blue and green fairies, 

and where eight-year-old Kumu is visiting her grandmother to recuperate. Kumu 

and the bird draw strength from each other.

Rater Kutum, with Debshankar Haldar, Sohini 

and Gautam, is about two petty thieves who break into an old womans house but 

end up having to look after the ailing aged lady.

SIDA officials will be here for the three-in-one show 

on September 24, at Academy of Fine Arts, after which Nandikar hopes to do repeats 

of only two plays at a time.

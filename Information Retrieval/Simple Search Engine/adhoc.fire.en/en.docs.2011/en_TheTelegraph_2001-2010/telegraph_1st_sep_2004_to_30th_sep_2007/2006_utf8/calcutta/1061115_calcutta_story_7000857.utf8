 Get into marriage

 Wedding 

 planner / Madhumita Bhattacharyya

 Amrita Rao and Shahid 

 Kapoor in Vivah 

 There are two mutually exclusive 

 categories of people in the world: those who want to be 

 married, and those who dont. This is rather different 

 from two other categories those who want to get married 

 and those who dont. 

 If you think you are on the I-do 

 side of the second category, an affirmative in the first 

 doesnt necessarily follow.

 Being married and staying married 

 implying a willing submission of your single status for 

 as long as you both shall live is a serious matter, which 

 requires far more weighty consideration. Getting married, 

 on the other hand, is all about the bash.

 Where you stand on the more temporal 

 getting married issue can be clarified by answering a simple 

 yes-or-no question: have you been to see Vivah yet?

 In other words, just because you 

 have chosen of your own free will or otherwise to do 

 the forever-after (for now) thing, it doesnt mean 

 you have to do the Hum Aapke Hain Kaun thing. Deciding 

 well in advance where you stand on this could save you much 

 pain, embarrassment and expense. 

 If you prefer the Four Weddings 

 and a Funeral milieu (albeit with real, rather more 

 convincing I-dos), its time to let it show. In fact, 

 to do so may save you a trip down Runaway Bride road 

 (which, apart from being a ghastly movie, would mean the 

 equivalent of social death for your erstwhile loved ones).

 Whether you choose a long-drawn-out, 

 five-day affair or a short-and-sweet quickie, you have a 

 party to plan. Both can be beautiful and great fun for your 

 guests (everyone knows the bride and groom have zero fun 

 at their wedding anyway).

 But perhaps we are jumping the 

 gun. If you havent snagged someone as yet, could you 

 still make it in time for the winter-spring wedding season?

 If you, like Karan Johar, believe 

 that marrying your best friend, someone you care about, 

 is the worlds worst option, then you may have a long 

 wait ahead of you. There is no easy way to find Prince Charming 

 on a white charger, so we would advise you to stay at home, 

 alone, with a stack of DVDs (Dil to Pagal Hai and 

 Serendipity, for example, would definitely 

 reinforce your resolve).

 If not, there are a number of 

 other options available for the pragmatist. If your parents 

 are breathing down your neck about doing the deed before 

 your next birthday, and you just cant get your head 

 around arranged marriages, its time to log on. Marriages 

 are no longer made in heaven, they are made on the Internet. 

 And while this basically is a self-arranged marriage, at 

 least you can pick your partner on your own terms.

 While false advertising is frowned 

 upon, present your stats with care. We created, just for 

 fun, a profile on a leading Internet matchmaking site, the 

 key points of which were:

 Nationality: Indian

 Age: 27

 Colour: Dark

 Faith: No religion

 The portal came up with a few 

 suggestions of its own, which were enough to show what really 

 counts, out there, in cyberspace. All three lived abroad; 

 all three had no religion. They seemed fine, 

 upstanding fellows, making enough cash, if not a lot. Only 

 one was married not yet divorced. Hope clearly floats 

 in our virtual world.

 But with 36 pages of men living 

 in the US alone doctors, engineers, citizens, you name 

 it on one of the most popular portals, chances are you 

 could find someone you could bring home to your parents. 

 The only problem here is of plenty.

 The bride/groom shopping, however, 

 must be left to you. We cant really help you there. 

 What Wedding Planner will explore over the next few 

 weeks is everything else you could need for the big day. 

 Next week, we will lay down some basic ground rules for 

 negotiation. Your wedding will most definitely be hijacked, 

 but if you are more Andie McDowell than Madhuri Dixit, its 

 time to get into battle mode.

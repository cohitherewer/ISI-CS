The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Head straight for Italy 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The Coliseum in Rome is a perennial attraction 

 This summer or autumn, you could be sipping cappuccino in a bar on the Piazza Di Spagna or the Navona Square in Rome, spend an evening at the opera in Verona, or marvel at the white conical roofs of the village houses in Alberobello, in the boot of Italy.

 ENIT ? the Italian state tourist board ? expects a ?20 to 25 per cent rise in tourist traffic? from Calcutta this summer, and has pulled out all stops to project Italy as a ?solo? tourist destination.

 ?Calcutta is very much a thrust area for us now and we expect the city to contribute significantly to the 140,000-plus Indians who tour Italy every year,? Salvatore Ianniello, representative of ENIT in India, told Metro on Tuesday.

 He was in town for ?Serata Italiana?, organised by the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry (IICCI) in collaboration with ENIT and the Italian consulate. 

 The Italian evening is part of the ?constant endeavour to increase awareness in India of Italy as a single tourist destination? and update local tour operators on the latest information regarding visas.

 ?We are concentrating on the cultural and historical elements to connect with Calcutta,? stressed Ianniello. Agostino Pinna, Italian consul-general in Calcutta, and Pankaj Parekh, IICCI?s eastern region chairman, also addressed the seminar. Direct flights to Italian stops ex-Calcutta are also in the offing, it?s learnt.

 A proposed cultural tour roadmap for city tourists drawn up by the Italian board begins in Sicily and proceeds to the heritage site of Alberobello in Puglia. ?Italy has 65 per cent of Unesco?s World Heritage Sites, a fact we are confident, will excite Calcuttans,? the ENIT official added.

 The culture trail then takes tourists to Naples with a visit to the magnificent Blue Grotto caves. Next stop, Pompei, which was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption. En route, ?one must stay in the small villages of Sorrento and Posetano?, the ?pearls of the Mediterranean?.

 Rome is up next, where ?if you don?t stay for five days, it?s a crime?. A stopover at Assisi, and then off to Florence, the leaning tower of Pisa, the Carnival of Venice and Viareggio?

 ?The seminar helped us understand the visa procedures, for which a fresh checklist is being sent by the consulate?s nodal agency,? said Anupama Singhi of Travels amp; Rentals, one of the 40-odd city-based tour operators who attended.

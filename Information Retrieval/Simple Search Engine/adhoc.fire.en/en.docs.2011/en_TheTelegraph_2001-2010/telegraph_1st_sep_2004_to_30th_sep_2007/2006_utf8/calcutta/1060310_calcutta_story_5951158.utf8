 The special offers announced for this year?s Valentine Day could have filled a large book (Love day, party night, February 14). But a friend who works in advertising is all for more parties and more liquor. He likes teasing girls in an intoxicated state and finds nothing wrong with it. According to him, everything is lawful on Valentine?s Day. Unfortunately, a large section of the youth shares the attitude. 

 But can love be forced? And are the partyhoppers dancing the night away really celebrating love? Isn?t it too much to assume that everyone is making love on Valentine?s Day? 

 Love isn?t something that can be sparked on a particular day in the year. Many people, young and old, who frequent nightclubs are only on the lookout for sex. They have confused love with lust. 

 The hype around the day often conceals the unsavoury aspects of love gone wrong. Incidences of illicit relationships and violence within the four walls of home are swept under the carpet. I know of a woman for whom Valentine?s Day brings no respite from beating at the hands of her husband. 

 Publicity should also be given to the victims of the Valentine?s Day craze. Youngsters commit suicide for having to spend the day alone, without a partner. The focus might also be shifted to aged couples who have stood by each other for years through thick and thin. Perhaps, theirs is the love to celebrate.

 Apropos the report ??Safer? women to pilot state buses,? February 14, it is a matter of regret that even the drivers of state buses do not observe road rules. However, the transport minister?s attempt to curb mishaps by recruiting women drivers is ludicrous. 

 Women drivers in state buses could, in fact, worsen the situation on the road. Many male drivers would try to overtake vehicles driven by women, even if they have to take risks in the process. The mishap count may thus go up. 

 The only way to rein in reckless drivers is by imposing stiff fines. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala.

 The transport minister has come 

 up with a good idea. Employment of women drivers in state 

 buses will definitely bring down the number of road accidents.

 However, it should be kept in 

 mind that it is not just the state buses that are responsible 

 for the mishaps. The private buses and minibuses are. It 

 should be mandatory for owners of private buses to employ 

 women drivers. 

 Purnima Vasudeva, 

 Rowland Road.

 Sense has prevailed on the transport 

 minister with the elections approaching. In Uttar Pradesh, 

 a bus service named Sakhi, meant exclusively for women and 

 children, was started about five years back. The driver 

 and other staff were also women. Unfortunately, the service 

 was available only on a handful of routes.

 Such a service was also started 

 in South Africa. The people initially used to avoid the 

 buses, but over time the women drivers were found to be 

 more reliable.

 Apropos the report ?Autonomy pat 

 for college?, February 9, Presidency College must be granted 

 autonomy for improvement in its standard. Elite academic 

 institutions are national assets and should be treated as 

 such. The college should have been given a free hand long 

 back. It is high time the state government sets a precedent 

 by rising above its narrow political concerns.

 Amit V. Sengupta, 

 Sarat Colony.

 It is undoubtedly heartening that 

 Presidency has been found to be one of best colleges in 

 India in terms of research by a team from National Assessment 

 and Accreditation Council. The team has recommended granting 

 of autonomous status to the college. Another illustrious 

 city college has already been granted the status. The colleges 

 will flourish outside the control of Calcutta University. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road.

 Apropos the report ?No doors at 

 lock-up loos for women?, February 9, it is difficult to 

 figure out why toilets for women in lock-ups should not 

 have ceilings and doors. The authorities should have found 

 other ways to prevent suicides in toilets. Is hanging possible 

 without a hook or a fan in the ceiling and a chair to stand 

 on? If the height of the ceiling is reduced to less than 

 that of an average person, suicide by hanging will not be 

 possible. 

 Moreover, why can?t a plywood 

 sheet be used as ceiling. It will break if someone tries 

 to hang from it. Also, the bolts and locks on the toilet 

 doors can be removed, but not the doors themselves.

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Diamond Harbour Road.

 I wonder why the state government 

 continues to cast its evil eye on the wetlands, which protect 

 the city from various environmental hazards (?Bill peril 

 hangs over wetlands?, February 14).

 A good portion of the wetlands 

 has already been eaten up by Salt Lake. New Town, Bantala 

 Leather Complex and construction of new roads towards Garia 

 will further encroach on the area.

 There are vast stretches along 

 Diamond Harbour Road and in Mahestala and Budge Budge that 

 can be used to expand the city. There is also a case for 

 building a satellite city like Noida.

 The government should try to attract 

 businesses to other areas in the state so that the development 

 does not remain localised.

 Pijush Banerjee,

 Sarsuna.

 The spat among the state ministers 

 over alteration of the character of the East Calcutta Wetlands 

 will turn out to be a show full of sound and fury leading 

 to nothing. The ministers concerned will resolve their differences 

 on being pressured by Alimuddin Street.

 Abdur Rezzak Mollah had kicked 

 up a storm over Indonesia-based Salim group?s proposal to 

 build a township on farmland in South 24-Parganas. He, however, 

 became totally silent on the issue after some time. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge.

 Apropos the report ?Security vigil 

 at temples in blast wake?, March 9, the picture above is 

 of Sri Radha Krishna Temple, popularly known as Birla Mandir. 

 It had been wrongly identified as Lakshminarayan temple 

 in the caption.

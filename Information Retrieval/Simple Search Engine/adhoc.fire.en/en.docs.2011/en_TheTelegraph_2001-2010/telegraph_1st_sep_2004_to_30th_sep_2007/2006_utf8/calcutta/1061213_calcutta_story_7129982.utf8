 Adieu to the arclights

 A true artiste, passionate about his art, can never accede to his farewell from stage. Ramanimohan unfolds the unfortunate saga of one such artiste, highlighting the predicament of actors of yesteryears who were totally devoted to their profession and who lived only to entertain spectators with their histrionic skills. Compelled by age to quit acting, Ramanimohan, the plays protagonist, now lives by cherishing fond memories of his past. He has also been forced by his son not to enact female roles, in which he was very proficient, as it led people to take him as a eunuch. Yet, when he gets a chance to be on stage again, Ramanimohan cannot resist the opportunity. His performance elicits both praise and derisive laughter, but his son, furious with him, shuts him up in his house forever. And then, all of a sudden, he disappears one day, leaving behind his possessions, awards and his treasured costumes. Direction: Prakash Bhattacharya.

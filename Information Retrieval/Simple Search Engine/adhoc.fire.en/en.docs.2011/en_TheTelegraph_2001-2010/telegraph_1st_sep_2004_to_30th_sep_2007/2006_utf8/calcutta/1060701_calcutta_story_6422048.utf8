 Cleric in opium sale held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohammad Israel, imam of a Park Circus mosque, was arrested at his Bright Street residence after being caught selling opium.

 Four pouches of opium, weighing 2.8 kg and worth more than Rs 2 lakh, were seized from him.

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said the arrest followed a complaint by a Tiljala resident, Zulfiqar, that the 33-year-old imam had been ?selling opium openly? for the past few months. 

 Police then laid a trap for Mohammad Israel. Zulfiqar called the imam on his mobile phone on Thursday evening, saying he wanted to buy two kg of opium. The imam readily agreed and asked Zulfiqar to come to his residence around noon on Friday.

 ?Our officers shadowed Zulfiqar while he went to the imam?s home after 11 am,? Singh said. 

 The imam opened the door and asked Zulfiqar to follow him in. After a few minutes, both emerged, with the imam holding four pouches of opium. ?We challenged him as soon as he opened the pouches,? said an officer.

 During interrogation, Mohammad Israel told police that this was the first time he had sold opium. ?Recently, I had been to my village in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, which is known for opium cultivation. I decided to bring some back with me,? he claimed.

 Taxi assault arrests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four men were arrested on Friday on charges of assaulting and robbing Krishna Kumar Pandey, an employee of a stockbroker firm, on November 2 night.

 Once dumped by the robbers, a battered and bleeding Pandey had to go through another ordeal. He visited three police stations, each refusing to register a complaint on the grounds that the spot of the crime was not under its jurisdiction.

 Senior officers said on Friday that Pandeys harassment by the cops is being probed. We will take action against the officers of Bhowanipore, Ballygunge and Shakespeare Sarani thanas for refusing to register Pandeys complaint, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 Pandey, a Santoshpur resident, boarded a share taxi that was carrying four other passengers at Esplanade around 11 pm on November 2.

 As the taxi swerved into Ho Chi Minh Sarani from Chowringhee, the four attacked Pandey, and snatched Rs 8,000, a gold chain and a cellphone from him. He was then thrown out on Rowland Row.

 As Pandey, bleeding from the nose and mouth, ran from one thana to another, he fell ill and had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of a south Calcutta nursing home.

 The sleuths came to know that before robbing Pandey, the gang had robbed another person, Amarnath Mahato, in the Maidan area. 

 The four have been identified as Pranab Das, Sunil Sharma, Raja Ghosh and Sheikh Noor Mumtaj.

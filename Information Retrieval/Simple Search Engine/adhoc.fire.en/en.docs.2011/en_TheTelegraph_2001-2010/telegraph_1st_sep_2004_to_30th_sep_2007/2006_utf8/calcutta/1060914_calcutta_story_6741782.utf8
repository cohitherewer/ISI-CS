The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Work-live-leisure lairs target techies

 SUBHRO SAHA

 After some upcountry majors have sunk their teeth into the citys appetising real-estate pie, its the turn of a southern giant to join the brick-and-mortar party. And the target, from IT land, is IT space.

 Shriram Properties Ltd, part of the Shriram Group with aggregated business in excess of $4.2 bn and a dominant presence in South India, is gearing up for Calcutta with its core competence of creating specialised habitats for IT pros in Bangalore and lifestyle lairs with golf villas.

 We are looking at launching a million sq ft of residential space with an IT bias and 1.2 million sq ft of commercial space with SEZ status in the first year of operations in Calcutta, M. Murali, managing director of the Bangalore-based firm, told Metro on Wednesday.

 Murali, on a reconnoitre visit, said a land scout was also on to develop a high-end golf resort on the periphery of the city. We are looking for 250 to 300 acres to create a comprehensive leisure-and-lifestyle haunt of exclusive villas built around an 18-hole golf course with our Australian collaborator, Prudentia.

 Shriram Properties is poised to acquire a four-acre plot on the Bypass, close to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, for its maiden residential project in town. The 400,000-sq-ft project will offer 200-250 apartments and the management hopes 60 per cent of the flats will be snapped up by IT professionals.

 Our experience in Bangalore gives us critical inputs on the basic needs of IT families and we hope to apply that learning curve in our Calcutta projects, said Murali.

 Ground should be broken by February 2007 and construction completed in 18 months.

 The second housing project planned is a 350-400 apartment estate in the Behala area where, again, a 40 per cent occupancy by IT personnel is projected.

 Our market research reveals a defined demand for high-end properties in Calcutta, and we are bullish on that segment, offering a bouquet of amenities like health club, swimming pool, tennis courts, billiards and pool, creche, and of course, the latest in security and connectivity, Murali pointed out.

 Two IT parks for two captive clients are also set for launch in the first year of Calcutta business. Over the next five years, Shriram Properties hopes to develop six to eight million sq ft of residential space in Calcutta, besides commercial and retail properties and the lifestyle resort.

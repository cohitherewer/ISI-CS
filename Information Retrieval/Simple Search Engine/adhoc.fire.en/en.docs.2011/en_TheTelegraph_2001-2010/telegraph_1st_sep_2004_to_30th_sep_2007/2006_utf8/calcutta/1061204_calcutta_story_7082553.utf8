 Ive already seen quite a 

 few men wearing ties tucked under shirts at parties, 

 smiles Aki Narula. The current address of the designer from 

 Calcutta is cloud nine, and he has every reason to be there. 

 With Don winning rave reviews for its style quotient, 

 the designer behind the subtle international look 

 of the film is firmly in the spotlight.

 In Bollywood reviews, costumes 

 hardly get a mention. Everyone talks about the stars, the 

 director and the music. But Ive read three-four reviews 

 of Don that praised the costumes. It feels really 

 good, says Aki, in town for Stylefile Winter Show 

 2006 at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers on Saturday 

 night.

 The St Xaviers College graduate 

 had shot to filmi fame with the wardrobe of Shaad 

 Alis Bunty Aur Babli Bablis patiala-and-kurti 

 combo became a real rage and was crowned the biggest Bolly 

 influence on mainstream fashion in recent times.

 So, which style statement of Don 

 will manage to whip up a style storm? I dont 

 want to take names, but I know of at least four big brands 

 that have come up with matching ties and shirts like Shah 

 Rukh (Khan) sported in Don, shares the trendsetter. 

 The silver dress Priyanka (Chopra) wore has also become 

 quite popular; Ive seen girls wearing it, he 

 adds.

 But Aki draws a line of distinction 

 between the Shaad Ali and Farhan Akhtar films: The 

 style statement of Bunty Aur Babli was more mass, 

 it was something very accessible and hence became a rage 

 in different strata of society. But with Don, the 

 look is very subtle and international, so one doesnt 

 expect it to create that kind of an impact.

 Aki admits that he was under tremendous 

 mental pressure to match up to the style image of 

 Amitabh Bachchans Don. Don was 

 not only a hit film, it was also a highly stylish film. 

 Both Amitabh and Zeenat Aman looked very stylish in the 

 film and so it was a tough task to recreate the magic. I 

 just wanted to pay a homage to that film. And this 

 he did after extensive research.

 For instance, the motifs 

 on Shah Rukhs shirt in the Khaike paan Banaraswala 

 song are the same motifs that were on Amitabhs waistcoat 

 in the same song, he offers.

 Taking a cue from the paisleys 

 Big B sported in the film, Aki also hunted out similar paisley 

 prints for Shah Rukhs shirts from Bangkok.

 The idea of playing up the tie 

 was also derived from the original. In Don, 

 Amitabh wore a lot of bow ties. But today, the bow tie looks 

 comical. So, I decided to play around with the tie but in 

 some other way, says Aki.

 After a hit hat-trick first 

 Bunty Aur Babli, then Bluffmaster and now 

 Don the city boy is now big in Bollywood. I 

 was a complete film buff since childhood and it has been 

 a dream to work in Bollywood. I will do one or two films 

 a year, but Im in Bollywood to stay, says Aki, 

 who loves the energy and pace of the film world.

 Aki is now busy putting the finishing 

 touches to the wardrobe of Shaad Alis Jhoom Barabar 

 Jhoom starring both the Bachchans, Preity Zinta, Bobby 

 Deol and Lara Dutta. This is the second time Ive 

 worked with both the Bachchans (after Bunty Aur Babli) 

 and now I can bully them into wearing what I want, 

 he laughs.

 On a serious note, he adds: The 

 Big B is the greatest style icon we have. But he trusts 

 me completely with his wardrobe. As for Abhishek, 

 the jeans-and-Tees guy just loves wearing 

 Pathanis and hates linen.

 From reel fashion to real, Aki 

 is now busy with his autumn-winter 2007-08 line, which he 

 will showcase at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week 

 in Delhi next March. For the coming spring-summer, Aki has 

 done an all-white line boasting volumes, structures 

 and lots of drapes.

 The ace designer lists a few must-haves 

 for this winter:

 A pair of skinny jeans, 

 in black or blue

 A waistcoat

 High boots

 Lots of ganjis to wear under jackets

 Blacks, browns, beiges, greens and splashes of red.

 The ongoing exhibition of paintings by MAC, a group of young artists, comes as a breath of fresh air in an art scene inundated with abstract stereotypes. Mainly featuring works inspired by the artists? observations and experiences, the show is remarkable for its presentation of a precise synopsis of contemporary life and times with lucidity, honesty and frankness. What is interesting about the paintings is that, though they portray images from real life, they are always coloured by their creators? personal perception and interpretation. Mintu Mallic (one of his paintings appears above) deals with emotions like love, longing and desire that lie dormant within our hearts. Balu K. Sadalge?s paintings, while depicting the decay and decadence of urban life, also express optimism about the future. Dip Narayan Paul looks towards spirituality and oneness with nature as a means towards attaining salvation. Goutam Saha?s works, partly conceptual and partly real, reflect the disturbing ambiguities of modern civilisation. Ranjan Paul reveals an urge to break free from convention and explore his creativity to its full potential.

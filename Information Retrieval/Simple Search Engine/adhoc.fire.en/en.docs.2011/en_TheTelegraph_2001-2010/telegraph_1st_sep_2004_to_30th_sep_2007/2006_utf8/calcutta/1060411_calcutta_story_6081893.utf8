 Posers perplex HS examinees

 The computer application paper 

 in this year?s Higher Secondary (HS) examination, held on 

 April 5, was unexpectedly horrible. Being a HS candidate 

 from Patha Bhavan, I would like to convey this concern to 

 the authorities on behalf of all examinees of my school.

 In the first paper, there was a printing mistake in the first question. ?Byte is a small unit of storage? was written in the Bengali version as ?Byte holo storage-er sobcheye choto ekok?. Question 3e of the first paper was too difficult for us to answer.

 In the second paper, Group A?s question 3 (second part) was out of syllabus. It carried four marks. On the other hand, question 4 of the paper about CSMA/CD was also tough as our books have just two sentences on the topic. The question carried six marks. Question 8 of Group B in the second paper, also worth six marks, was completely out of syllabus. So was question 10 (ii).

 Question 12 of Group C required us to do an arithmetic operation which we were never taught. Question 13 of the same group and question 14 (i), worth six marks, were out of syllabus.

 I would request the examiners to be considerate while marking us on these questions.

 Many questions in the computer application paper of the HS examination this year were out of syllabus and there were also a few cases of misprints and mismatches between the Bengali and English versions.

 Question 3, 4 (in the networking section), 8 (in access section) and 14 (in excel section) of Paper II were out of syllabus. These questions carried almost 30 marks. Parts of some other questions, carrying two to four marks each, were very difficult to answer. These included poser on tab order, conditional formatting, datagram, i-cycle and e-cycle, calculation of percentage-average function of the marks in a hypothetical gradesheet, etc.

 In the paper worth a total of 140 marks, we could barely attempt questions of 90 marks properly.

Double joy

 A year after winning the silver medal in Informatrix 2005, an international computer project competition organised by the ministry of education in Romania, students of Learnium School in Calcutta have once again qualified at the meet.

 The participants, along with their teacher-in-charge, will be leaving for the final phase of the contest in Bucharest on May 14. The students have worked hard throughout the past year in the hope of getting the opportunity to take part in the competition. Finally, they beat 300 other teams from 40 countries to make it to the top slot.

 Abhishek Deb Purokayastha of Class VI prepared his project on Wildlife in India, while children?s games was the theme of the projects by Sounak Paul and Suvojit Kar of classes V and VI, respectively.

 Tech savvy

 Birla High School has been awarded the much-coveted INTEL National Award for the best integration of technology into the school curriculum for the year 2005. 

 Over the years, the school (junior section) has strived to promote multi-faceted use of computers in varied fields like giving instruction to students, communication, research and publication of write-ups.

 Kaveri Dutt, headmistress of the school?s junior section, said: ?Technology-aided learning has helped the students reach out beyond the confines of the classroom and scale new heights. Students no longer just read about Rajasthan or Meghalaya in their texts. Instead, they take virtual tours to learn about these places and their people. Project-based learning methods help more in-depth learning about various topics.?

 During Earth Day celebrations, computers were used to address environmental issues. Students of Birla High interacted with e-pals across the globe, under the guidance of Tamar Hurwitz, UN environment education manager, to formulate an action plan to combat environmental problems. Impressed by the initiative by Birla High, Hurwitz later visited Calcutta to interact with the school?s students.

 The youngsters also used computers to research and publish write-ups on the damaging effects of misuse of plastic items during a recent drive to make the school premises a plastic-free zone.

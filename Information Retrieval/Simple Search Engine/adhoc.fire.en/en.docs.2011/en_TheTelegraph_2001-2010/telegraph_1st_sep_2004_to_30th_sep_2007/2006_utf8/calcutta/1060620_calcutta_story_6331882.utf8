 Bookie bulletin on June 9: Brazil wins World Cup 2006 and Ronaldo is the player of the tournament.

 Bookie bulletin on June 19: Argentina wins World Cup 2006 but Ronaldinho is the player of the tournament.

 It has taken 10 days and 29 matches of World Cup action for the odds to do a somersault of sorts in soccer-crazy Calcutta.

 When the Cup got underway in Germany, Ronaldo?s Brazil was the hot favourite of city bookies, with odds of Rs 2.85 (on Re 1). Beckham?s England was in second spot with Rs 7.50.

 With the group matches reaching a climax and Brazil struggling to find their samba rhythm, Argentina now leads the race with odds of Rs 3.30 (for every Re 1 you get Rs 3.30 if Argentina wins the Cup). Brazil is second with Rs 4.25.

 ?Though Serbia and Montenegro is not a tough team, winning by such a big margin (6-0) has really lifted Argentina?s fortunes as favourites. The below-par performance of teams like Brazil, England and Germany has also helped Argentina,? a bookie in Burrabazar said on Monday.

 And Ronaldo, lumbering and lethargic, has been overtaken by team-mate Ronaldinho (though quite low-key himself) as the star tipped to win the Golden Ball (best player) trophy.

 If the weekend saw Argentina emerging favourites for the first time, it also saw women making their debut on the betting field. ?Though there are very few women, but for the first time, they are entering the fray. The players they like ? often on the basis of looks ? hugely influence their bets. For instance, four women put money on Italy last Saturday night,? revealed a bookie.

 To cash in on the Cup craze, the minimum amount required for kick-off is Rs 5,000 and a sound reference. ?The age bracket is 25 years to 55 years,? says the Burrabazar bookie.

 One victim of football fever is cricket betting. ?The volume of betting I handled for the first India vs West Indies Test was more than Rs 5 crore. In the second Test, this came down to below Rs 2 crore. For the last two Tests, as World Cup craze peaks, the money on cricket will dip further,? said a bookie.

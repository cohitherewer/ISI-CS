 HIGH TIME: Party people in action. A Telegraph picture

 Four hours of fun. Four months of planning.

 New Years eve may still be some weeks away but the preparations have been on in full swing for some time now. From popular nightclubs like Shisha and Venom to star hotels like The Park and Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI), the big plans for the big night have all been chalked out.

 We have to start planning from September because there are so many things to be done and in the party business, the early mover gets the best venues and deals, said Shisha manager Sovan Mukherjee. Also, if our regulars are aware of the plans early, they can freeze their party destination.

 So, even as everyone was celebrating Shishas third birthday party in September, they got a teaser invite for the Alibaba and 40 Thieves 31st night at Nalban Boating Complex. 

 Across the road, Venom has thought ahead, too. When Metro got in touch with proprietor Bunty Sethi, he was busy shopping in the bylanes of Singapore to jazz up the New Years eve offering of his Fort Knox haunt. We are doing a week-long celebration this time to ring in 2007, what with my new restaurant Urban Desi opening doors soon, he added. The Venom party this year will spill over two floors and it needs two-three months to set things up this size.

 The hotels are not far behind. Very aware that crooners and dancers are much in demand on the last night of the year, the party organisers at the star addresses book much in advance. That way, we also get the best rates, offered Namrata Ray, assistant manager, events and entertainment, The Park. And with so many different venues Roxy, Tantra, Someplace Else, Aqua we have to come up with different ideas. We can then go out, fix tie-ups and promote the big night by blocking hoardings and advertising space.

 So, while the international acts at The Park have already been finalised for the 31st night, Hotel Hindusthan has beefed up plans for its party premises like Underground, Virgose and the Poolside. We need a lot of lead time to plan three very different parties under the same roof, explained a spokesperson for HHI. Sometimes, permissions take longer than expected and so, its better to be safe than sorry.

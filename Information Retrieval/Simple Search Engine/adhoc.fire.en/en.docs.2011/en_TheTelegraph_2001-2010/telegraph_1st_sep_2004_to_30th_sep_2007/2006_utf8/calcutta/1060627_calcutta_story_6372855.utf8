 Switch over to a brand new look 

 Far from looking fake, 

 wigs in their new avatar can help cover up a bad straightening 

 job or hide a thinning patch in style. Shradha Agarwal

 The only cure for bald hair, goes 

 the old saying, is the guillotine. But then todays 

 wigs ? or switches, as they are more fashionably called, 

 werent in vogue.

 Designed to hide a receding hairline, cover an untimely (isnt it always that?) bald patch or even make a huge haute statement, wigs are in like never before.

 Your neighbourhood uncle might buy one. Your favourite model might hide her bad straightening job under one. The mop of hair, which looked like a toupee on the 70s Bollywood hero, or was seen as a corny cross-dressers asset or a filmi vamps make-up essential, has gone places. 

 Those made with Indian hair, especially. Indian hair is recognised as the best quality hair, says international hair stylist John Gillespie, who was in town recently. The most exquisite wigs are made from them, adds Gillespie. 

 GoodLife tells you more about wigs.

 Tress trick

 A number of factors turned the wig that looked like a wig into a hairstyle. Earlier wigs would look fake, now it is hard to tell. There is a marked improvement in the material and texture. Today wigs are lighter and the fall is like that of natural hair, says Bridgette Jones, hair expert. 

 It is no longer about all jet black wigs. You get them in lovely colours now ? copper, blonde ? and streaks as well, she adds.

 Agrees beauty expert June Tomkyns: Today wigs look absolutely natural and are very helpful to models who have to sport different looks often, as well as people suffering from acute hair loss due to diseases, she adds.

 In Calcutta, locally made wigs are available in New Market and shops on Chitpore Road. They start at Rs 500. The better cost around Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. The salons sell wigs imported from Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. These are priced approximately between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,500.

 Wear it right

 A wig would end up looking like a wig if not worn right. Bridgette draws up a list of dos and donts. 

 Remove the protective hair net from the wig and give it a good shake to wake up the present styling. Brush your hair off your face at the top and sides and the nape. For long hair, use bob pins. You can also try a wig-liner to keep natural hair in place.

 With the woven label at the back, place it just over your natural hairline and slide it back. Wigs usually have an elastic band near the nape of the neck to ensure a snug fit. 

 For half-wigs, it is important for the piece to match the natural hair to blend over the crown area, where the wig is secured with combs, and with the neckline, for a natural look. 

 Maintain must 

 Conditioners, serum, anti-frizz gels, hair souffle? Does a wig scream for that high a maintenance regime, too? Well, not if a dip in a bowl of diluted shampoo and water is considered high-maintenance, says Bridgette. Hang it to dry naturally and the wig is clean.

 When it comes to style maintenance, synthetic wigs win hands down with a wide range of styles, colours and comfort. 

 Shorter synthetic wigs are literally shake-and-go and longer styles need to be combed or finger-styled, says Bridgette. 

 Synthetic ones are also handy to travel with and the fibre is resistant to humidity so your style holds in any weather. 

 One thing that is important to remember is that you should never use heat on a synthetic wig ? be it a blow dryer or an open oven ? it can damage the fibre and ruin the wig, adds Bridgette.

 Human hair wigs are never pre-styled and hence require more effort than synthetic wigs. They also tend to be heavier and thicker and need to be trimmed to suit your features, Bridgette says. 

 Wow wefts

 The next big thing after wigs to storm the fashion scene in the UK is the weft, says Gillespie. Wefts are basically bails of human hair that can be attached to your own to add a further dimension ? in terms of volume or colour. 

 A tailor-made solution for extra fine hair, wefts make the hair look natural and thicker. Unlike the hair extensions that need to be removed professionally, wefts with their simple glue are easy to wear as well as take off. 

 These wefts last for two weeks and are great to have fun with. Snip them with a razor to blend them with your own hair, adds Gillespie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School to shut early for Kalam

 OUR BUREAU

 The visit of a President who pens books on how to ignite young minds is causing a leading school to shut down an hour early on Tuesday. Or rather, it is police paranoia over President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s breeze through town that is hacking into the school?s schedule.

 On Tuesday, Modern High School will give over at 1.30 pm, instead of the usual 2.30 pm. ?If the school is going to be shut early, the President is not aware of it. Why should schools be closed?? a Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson said in Delhi.

 A traffic sergeant turned up at Modern High on Monday morning to inform the school authorities that no car would be allowed to park on Syed Amir Ali Avenue on Tuesday afternoon, as the President would pass by before 3 pm.

 ?It was inconvenient, but not closing early would have meant unnecessary hassles for the students, parents and staff,? said principal Devi Kar.

 An officer later said: ?Lalbazar requested the school authorities for smooth movement of the President?s convoy. They voluntarily acceded to our request.?

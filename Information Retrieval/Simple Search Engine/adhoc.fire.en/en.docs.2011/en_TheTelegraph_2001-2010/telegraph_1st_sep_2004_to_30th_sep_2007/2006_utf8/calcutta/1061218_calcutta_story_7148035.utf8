 Move over oh-so-common whites, blacks and browns. Colour, colour and more colour is the latest leather accessory buzz and Italian brand Blue amp; Blues is all set to impress with a vibrant palette. 

 While internationally the brand finds a place in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Austria, Blue amp; Blues brought to India under the banner of Blue amp; Blues Fashions (India) Ltd, has an exclusive store in Gurgaon.

 Last week, the label made its foray into the eastern market with a store at 4 Camac Street (next to Fort Knox). 

 Stores in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune and Bangalore should be up in the next six months. The Blue amp; Blues brand will also be available in UK and USA in the next financial year.

 Says Praveen Agarwal, director, Blue amp; Blues Fashions (India) Ltd: Blue amp; Blues has been available in Taj Khazana and Shoppers Stop outlets for some time now. The new showroom will give us the opportunity to showcase on a broader platform. 

 Spread over 1,100 sq ft, the Blue amp; Blues city address with an all-white colour code touched up with silver and Prussian blue is an eye catching contrast to the colourful display all around.

 While the ground floor is the womens zone, the first floor is for men. The bags and accessories are displayed on swank white racks.

 Hand bags, wallets, portfolio bags, key rings the array will spoil you for choice. Stylisation and utility are in perfect synchronisation. Our Indian design team works very closely with the Italian team to bring out the best keeping in mind Indian likes and dislikes, says Sharmistha Sen, creative visualiser, Blue amp; Blues Fashions (India) Ltd.

 The look and designs are international and customer satisfaction is guaranteed, adds Praveen.

 The womens section is home to a number of signature collections, with coloured leather being the key. La Africano offers spacious hobo bags in unusual shades, in combinations of soft leather and hard leather. 

 ass beads handworked in African patterns embellish the bags. 

 La Tribale draws inspiration from South African tribal motifs. Muted greens and reds have been patchworked with spirals. La Forza in pretty pinks and ochre has braids incorporated generously.

 If you are an all-white dresser, La Puro is a suitable line for you. Pristine white bags are jazzed up with silver fittings. Closer to nature is the La Feroce with reptilian prints. 

 There are funky shapes like bananas, and regular rectangles as well. Metallic shades rule here. 

 La Floreale with its bright and cheerful hand-painted floral patterns should find favour with teens. La Eleganza looks classic yet customised for regular use.

 Men can take their pick from a variety of office bags, pen cases, mobile holders, passport holders and more. The trimmings are less, and the look smart and macho. The finish could be matte or gloss.

 Prices start from Rs 338 and go up to a few thousands.

 In terms of fashion, Calcuttans today have shed their conservative shell. They are ready to experiment with colours and want to make a style statement. The city is ready for a premium brand like this. Men or women, the label is suitable for all age groups. However, the target group is definitely niche,explains Praveen.

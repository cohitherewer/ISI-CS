 Tour fraud cry rises

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after a fraud by a travel agency came to light, fresh complaints poured in. On Friday, two more people lodged complaints with Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 Sanchita Maity, a physician from Tollygunge whose husband Ajit is stranded in Frankfurt, along with 30 others, accused Indranil Mitra, proprietor of the travel agency Endeavour, of cheating her of several lakhs.

 Police also recorded a complaint by Arindam Dey, who said he had paid Mitra Rs 3.8 lakh for a tour of Europe with his five-member family.

 The detective department took over the probe on Friday. Police came to know about the fraud on Thursday, after electronic goods dealer Nisith Sinha lodged a complaint, saying he had settled a deal with the agency after floating a tender.

 ?We selected 28 clients who were offered a World Cup package ? the two semis and the final. Endeavour agreed at a cost of Rs 90,000 per head. An advance payment of Rs 15.5 lakh was made. The group was scheduled to leave on July 1. But Mitra left the city on June 28 for the UK,? Sinha said in his complaint.

 Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (south), said Mitra was contacted by three of his employees on Thursday. ?He asked them to come to Bangkok, via Kathmandu, where he would talk to them. Sensing trouble, the trio contacted a few persons scheduled to leave on Saturday and told them that they had been cheated.?

 Kumar, however, clarified that those stranded in Frankfurt had no links with the deal between Mitra and Sinha. ?Endeavour offered the group of 32 persons, including former Mohun Bagan coach Amal Dutta and club secretary Anjan Mitra, a World Cup package ? the quarter-finals, the semis and the final, along with lodging and airfare,? he said.

 Anil Punjabi, of Travel Agents Federation of India, requested tourists to check out whether the antecedents of their agents were genuine.

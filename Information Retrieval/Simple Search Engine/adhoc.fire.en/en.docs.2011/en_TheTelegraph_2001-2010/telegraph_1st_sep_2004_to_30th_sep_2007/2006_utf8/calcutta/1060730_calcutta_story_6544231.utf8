 Driving through North Sikkim

 - Next weekend you can be ...

 Every time I have been to North 

 Sikkim, I have felt that the region, more than Kashmir, deserved 

 to be described as ?heaven on earth?. A recent visit only 

 strengthened the feeling. 

 We set off from Gangtok for a 52-km drive to Phodong past breathtaking landscape. It took around 90 minutes to reach the town at 5,700 ft.

 The main attraction of Phodong is a monastery, located off the main road. We had to trek about a kilometre to get there.

 The monastery, built in 1740, was repaired a couple of years ago. It has the most exquisite carved door you are likely to come across in this part of the woods. The murals inside are equally impressive.

 From Phodong we drove about a couple of kilometres to another magnificent monastery, at Labrang. After a brief stopover, it was time again to hit the road.

 The 27-km downhill drive to Mongon (3,950 ft), too, was past some magnificent landscape. We had a late lunch in the town and proceeded to Singhik, 5 km away. Many come here for the wonderful view of the Kanchenjunga.

 By the time we reached, it was 3.30 in the afternoon. The sun was well on its way down on the western horizon and had turned the third highest peak in the world a fairy land in gold.

 Amidst a lovely alpine forest, a small chorten (stupa) and the monastery of Singhik looked picture perfect. Our night halt was planned at Chungthang, 26 km from Mongon. It was getting dark, so we could not linger at Mongon on the way back. 

 It was dark by the time we reached Chungthang. We spent the night at the mess for army officers. For those who cannot get permission to stay in the mess, the other accommodation options are the PWD bungalow and a handful of hotels.

 Before leaving early next morning for Chopta Valley and Gurudongma Lake, via Lachen, we drove around Chungthang for a bit. It is a picturesque cantonment at the confluence of the rivers Lachen Chu and Lachung Chu. The banks of both are strikingly pretty.

 We drove uphill 20 km and reached Lachen (9,500 ft) as the first rays of the sun were about to emerge from behind the mountains.

 About 150 houses make the village. Most of the residents are yak shepherds. We saw yaks coming out of the houses to graze.

 We did not stop at Lachen and drove on to Thangu, about 30 km away. The journey was enjoyable, with alpine trees and flowering plants dotting the way.

 A carpet of wild flowers welcomed us at Thangu Valley. In winter, a thick blanket of snow envelopes everything here.

 Our journey continued to Chopta Valley (13,200 ft). Snow-capped peaks, meandering rivers and alpine forests kept us captivated for the three hours we were there. 

 Anyone who has toured Sikkim extensively is aware that no visit to the state is complete without a trip to Gurudongma Lake. It is the land of yaks, blue sheep and other high-altitude animals. The road to Gurudongma is picturesque, alpine pastures dotted with thick rhododendron bushes on the sides.

 Brilliant sunlight reflected by the snow-fed waters of the lake dazzled us when we got there. The waterbody is one of the sources of the Teesta. It is located at an altitude of over 17,000 ft and is surrounded by snow-covered ranges.

 Since it was summer, we were expecting a prized view of the Bramhakamal flower. But it had snowed late into the season, and we had to turn back disappointed.

 However, our field glasses afforded us a glimpse of a herd of mountain sheep grazing in a distant valley.

 Gurudongma Lake freezes in winter, except at one spot, which people believe is blessed. We saw couples praying for children on the banks. Many believe that the water of the lake has the power to cure infertility.

 Interestingly, Buddhists treat 

 the lake as reverentially as the Hindus. For us, though, 

 the natural splendour was the blessing.

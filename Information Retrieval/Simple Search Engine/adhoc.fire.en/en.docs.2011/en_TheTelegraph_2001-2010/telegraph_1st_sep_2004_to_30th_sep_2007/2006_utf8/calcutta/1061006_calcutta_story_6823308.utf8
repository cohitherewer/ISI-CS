Park Street stalwart Flurys won quite a crown on Tuesday 

 the MTV Lycra Style Award. A whole host of celebrities including Cyrus Sahukar, 

Usha Uthup and June attended the presentation of the award at Flurys.

Aditya Swamy, vice president, marketing, MTV India, 

praised the cafe-restaurant for being the epitome of style in Calcutta for 

over 70 years, adding how delighted they were to recognise it as the 

most stylish place in town.

The MTV Style Awards have been running for the past 

four years, largely focused on Mumbai. The judges and organisers this year included 

Bangalore and Calcutta for awards in the Most Stylish Places category.

urys was found to be one of its kind. Calcutta 

is fashionably stylish, and Flurys, 

over many decades, has been the popular destination 

for famous personalities who have defined style in so many exciting aspects, 

said Satish Khurana, regional director of Apparel, a backer of the Awards.

Singer Usha Uthup concurred: When I was young, 

I used to take my singing classes nearby, and after the lesson was over I used 

to come to Flurys and buy some of their delicious cookies. The place has been 

a constant throughout my life, and Im very pleased to be here to see Flurys 

collect such an award.

Actress June recalled how as a kid she always used 

to get her birthday cakes from Flurys. A birthday was incomplete without 

a Flurys cake! she said.

Apeejay Surrendra Hotels managing director Vijay Dewan 

expressed surprise and delight at the award, and explained the efforts 

of the Pauls to keep Flurys at the top of the game. The challenge was taken 

up two years ago to make Flurys reminiscent of a turn-of-the-century European 

tearoom, while upgrading technology, kitchen and efficiency in operations, 

he said.

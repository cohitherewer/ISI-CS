 Rethink on clean chits

 - Character certificates may be withheld to discipline students

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Worried over repeated clashes among students, the authorities of Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) have decided to be ?more strict? about issuing character certificates to outgoing undergraduates seeking placements through campus interviews. 

 The move, officers feel, will make undisciplined students think twice before fomenting trouble on the campus.

 ?We are planning to be more strict while issuing character certificates to outgoing undergraduate students. A contract will be entered into with companies that absorb our students through campus interviews so that a student without a clean chit from BESU will be liable to get his candidature automatically cancelled,? Debasish Ghosh, dean of faculty, BESU, said on Sunday.

 On an average, around 450 outgoing students land plum jobs with various companies through campus interviews every year, he added.

 Three clashes among hostel inmates on the campus within a span of seven months has forced BESU to initiate the ?stringent? move, a senior officer said. 

 ?Every time a clash breaks out, police come, we order hostel inmates to vacate their rooms and leave the campus, meetings are held, the errant students tender ?unconditional? apologies and we pardon them. But after some time, things are back to square one,? the officer observed.

 The university authorities have till now issued good character certificates to all outgoing students as ?we don?t want a young man to be in trouble?. 

 The professor-in-charge of student affairs, hostel superintendents and various department heads will regularly maintain registers where the behaviour of students will be recorded. 

 Character certificates will be issued to students on the basis of records of their behaviour on the campus. 

 Students involved in trouble will not be issued character certificates at all, the official said.

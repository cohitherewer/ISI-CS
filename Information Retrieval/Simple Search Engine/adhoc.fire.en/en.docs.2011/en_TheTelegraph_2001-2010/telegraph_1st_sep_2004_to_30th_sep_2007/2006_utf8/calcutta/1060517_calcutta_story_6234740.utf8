 ?Phir Hera Pheri not a sequel? 

Screen On amp; Off

Writer-director NEERAJ VORA tells Pratim D. Gupta 

why the much-awaited comedy is a standalone film and what makes it two bit 

better than the first one

 Suniel Shetty, Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal and 

(below) Bipasha Basu in Phir Hera Pheri 

Why isn?t Priyadarshan directing the sequel despite 

Hera Pheri becoming such a cult film?

Priyanji felt that you can?t make a sequel 

to a film like Hera Pheri. Then the producers looked at Satish Kaushik 

but he had some date problems. Then they thought since I had written both the 

Hera Pheri films and also had some directing experience ? Akshay Kumar-starrer 

Khiladi 420 and the yet-to-be-released Familywallah ? I was the 

best person to step in as director.

Hera Pheri in many ways revived the comedy 

genre in Bollywood. What do you think was the secret behind the success?

My writing was good but the way Priyanji conceived 

the film was tremendous. He did not take it away from life, yet kept it larger 

than life. People make the mistake of making comedies that are so unbelievable 

that people cannot identify with them. Priyanji gave a terrific perspective 

to the characters. Comedies are all about chakachak lighting. He went for 

a high contrast lighting, and brought in the poverty aspect. That made Hera 

Pheri so fresh amongst the kind of comedies being made then and made the characters 

so lovable.

After Hera Pheri, why have you and Priyadarshan 

failed to repeat that magic?

That?s because the audiences expected all the subsequent 

comedies to be like Hera Pheri. Now, every film can?t be about kidnapping, 

every film cannot be about financially broke people. In every film we have tried 

to laugh out the problems we face all the time. They may not have been big hits 

when they were first released, but when they came later on TV, people started 

loving them more and identified them as different stories. As writers and directors 

we have to keep experimenting and presenting different faces of life.

Now, Phir Hera Pheri being the sequel of 

Hera Pheri, the expectations are even greater. Will that be its undoing?

I don?t consider Phir Hera Pheri to be a sequel 

at all. It?s a new happening in the lives of these people. Like there were new 

episodes in the life of Charlie Chaplin, in the lives of Laurel Hardy, even James 

Bond. As for the expectations, I love it. I am not worried at all, I love challenges. 

If there?s no challenge, there?s no fun. At the same time I wouldn?t say that 

it?s no big deal. I know people won?t accept one bit less than the first film. 

But I promise to give them two bit better. Phir Hera Pheri is an extra-ordinarily 

entertaining film.

What is the adventure this time?

In the first film we showed you how these three characters 

played by Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty and Paresh Rawal get some money. In this 

one, we see what they do with that money. Is the money enough? Is money the way 

to happiness? Phir Hera Pheri has all the answers. It has a message apart 

from being a comedy. 

What was it like directing the cast?

It was lovely. Pareshji is, of course, a great 

actor and directing him is like driving a Mercedes. Even Akshay and Suniel have 

become such improved actors. They have been able to adopt improvisational qualities 

since they are no longer in awe of the very act of acting. They can now throw 

a dialogue casually as opposed to stressing it the way old actors used to. As 

for the ladies, we have gone for Bipasha Basu and Rimii. Since Phir Hera Pheri 

is not the second half of Hera Pheri, we didn?t have to repeat Tabu 

or the rest of the cast.

 Neeraj Vora

Your film is coming on the same day (June 9) as 

Priyadarshan?s Chup Chup Ke, which you have written. Is it like fighting 

yourself and your mentor?

There?s no fight as such. Chup Chup Ke is a 

different kind of movie. It is emotional, sweeter and a romantic comedy. Phir 

Hera Pheri is a mad and black comedy. 

What next?

I am making a romantic comedy for Balaji, the cast 

of which hasn?t been finalised. And my second directorial film Familywallah 

should release later in the year. It stars Arjun Rampal, Dia Mirza and Paresh 

Rawal. It is a family comedy.

Why do you only make comedies?

Because apart from comedies and romances, you get 

to see everything else on the news channels on TV!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

A return to the roots

Screen On amp; Off

 Family ties: The cast 

 of Aisa Des Hai Mera

 Lekh Tandon, who had directed films like Amrapali, Prince, Jhuk Gaya Aasman and Professor, is making a big comeback on the small screen by helming the new Sony serial Aisa Des Hai Mera, which will replace Indian Idol 2.

 The veteran, who was recently seen in cameos in films like Swades and Rang De Basanti (Aamir?s grandpa), is naturally thrilled about his latest assignment. ?I am telling a simple story of how it is culture that brings all of us together,? Tandon told Metro.

 Aisa Des Hai Mera has a British girl discovering that her father was an Indian and coming to India to trace her roots. ?It is about the coming together of yesterday, today and tomorrow,? said Tandon, admitting that ?television allows you to do a lot more than movies?.

 Pop pair: Ryan Phillippe and Reese 

 Witherspoon

 She is not only winning awards galore, Reese Witherspoon is also sending out the right style signals. The Walk The Line actress and beau Ryan Phillippe have been named the most stylish showbiz couple by an American publication.

 The hot pair, who also walked the Oscar red carpet before Reese won her Best Actress trophy, beat other star couples including Jay-Z and Beyonce Knowles and newcomers Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams to the title.

 You can, of course, catch Reese at her best in Walk The Line, where she plays June Carter to Joaquin Phoenix?s Johnny Cash. The Legally Blonde star was, at one point of time, on the verge of walking out of the musical that is currently playing on our city screens. She admitted that it was her ?paranoid thoughts? that almost made her quit Walk The Line right in the middle of the shoot.

 Continuing its endeavour to make the coming state Assembly elections as transparent as possible, STAR Ananda has been doing a reality check on the candidates in Marksheet. Aired every evening at 6.30 pm and then again at 10.30 pm, the new show will tabulate the bidhayak?s performance reports in their respective constituencies since the last Assembly elections. Marksheet will travel to more than 50 constituencies around Bengal to get a representation of various parties and regions from all over the state.

 AC Nielsen has done a detailed survey on behalf of STAR Ananda to verify the claims made by the candidates. 

 The common man is part of the show too, as he gets a chance to voice his opinion confirming or negating the candidates? claims. Marksheet will be telecast on STAR Ananda till April 15.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green board eye on cell towers

 - Missive to service providers after complaints

 JAYANTA BASU

 Is the cellular tower atop your building a hazard to your health and the environment? The West Bengal Pollution Control Board is trying to find out.

 Inquiries by the public on the effects of electromagnetic radiation from the mobile phone towers and a directive from environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee have prodded the board to write to the five cellular service providers in the city, seeking an explanation of their stand on the issue.

 ?The minister asked us to look into the matter. Besides, we have received inquiries about whether radiation from mobile towers affect human health. A public interest litigation (PIL) has also been filed in the Supreme Court,? chairman of the pollution board Sudip Banerjee told Metro.

 Letters have been sent to Hutch, Airtel, BSNL, Tata Teleservices and Reliance Infocomm, the chairman added. ?The firms have been asked to furnish the findings of any study they might have carried out on the effects of radiation.?

 The cellular service providers ? with over 1,000 towers among them in the city ? refused comment on the ?sensitive? matter. Spokespersons for some firms termed it an issue involving the entire industry and not individual players.

 According to pollution board law officer Biswajit Mukherjee, complaints regarding mobile phone towers were received from Kamarhati, Howrah and Hooghly. ?Though most of the complaints were about the use of diesel generators to power the towers, there were several about the alleged damage caused by the electromagnetic waves to humans and plants, particularly coconut trees,? he said.

 A mass complaint by residents of Chikrand village, in Hooghly, to the district magistrate stressed that ?radio-wave emission from the tower causes considerable health hazards in the surrounding locality?.

 A PIL filed by an NGO in the Supreme Court in May raised questions about the health threats posed by the towers. The study carried out by the NGO showed that constant exposure to the electromagnetic waves emanating from the base stations can lead to neurological, cardiac, respiratory and ophthalmic disorders, and even cancer.

 The petition pointed out that though there are no guidelines on the issue in India yet, the setting up of mobile towers near schools and in residential areas has been banned in the US.

 ?It is an established fact that electromagnetic waves have adverse effect on all biological systems, including human beings and especially on children,? said professor Dipak Ghosh of Jadavpur University?s radio physics department.

 ?We need a proper epidemiological study to establish a significant correlation,? felt electrical engineering expert Sujoy Basu.

 Aesthetic expressions

 Celebrating the festive season of wispy clouds and mellow sunshine, The Monsoon Show, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by 19 women artists, provides a vivid and visually appealing feast to art lovers. On view are 20 paintings and six sculptures that deal with a variety of themes including nature, romance, belongingness, tradition and harmony. Varied in style and content, the paintings evoke powerful emotional responses, at the same time offering an insight into the creative individualism of each artist. The sculptures on show are imaginative studies of lyrical expressions in aluminium and bronze. Participating artists include Shanu Lahiri, Anita Roy Chowdhury, Uma Siddhanta, Anusua Chakraborti, Sohini Dhar, Arunima Choudhury, Banasri Khan (a sculpture by her appears above), Sukti Subhra Pradhan, Tapati Sarkar, Piu Sarkar, Shyamasree Basu, Subhamita Dinda and Sumona Ghosh.

 Gallery clone to display three-dimensional artwork

 As the last two auctions in New York organised by Sotheby?s and Christie?s have proved once again, the market ? both local and international ? of Indian contemporary art is booming. But only two-dimensional works on either paper or canvas were sold. No place for sculptures by modern artists here, although there is a thriving market of Indian classical sculpture.

 In the country, too, collectors and investors, who are growing in numbers, usually do not touch sculptures as apart from being difficult to display, they have little resale value. Not unless a piece was sculpted by a master. 

 Aakriti Art Gallery, on Picasso Bithi, would like to do its bit to reverse this trend.

 Adjacent to its gallery for exhibiting paintings that was inaugurated last October, Aakriti is getting ready to open another devoted exclusively to sculpture, which will, perhaps, be the first of its kind in this country. Vikram Bachhawat, who runs the gallery, says the second gallery will cover 2,700 sq ft and will in all likelihood open on August 15. The two spaces will be connected by a small corridor.

 The new gallery, under construction now, will have a glass front overlooking the street and will have a small pantry. There will be a permanent display besides. 

 Bachhawat says he has hired an expert from Mumbai to fix the special lighting meant for displaying three-dimensional works to best effect.

 Bachhawat already has started collecting sculptures. He has a few large bronzes by Satish Gujral and some terracotta work by Laxma Goud. He has acquired quite a sizeable collection of the works of Bengal sculptors, like Ajit Chakrabarty, Manik Talukdar and Bipin Goswami. He says he has also procured a piece by Pradosh Dasgupta and would like to acquire others by important sculptors from all over the country. But he admits these are difficult to come by.

 He is in touch with city-based sculptors, such as Sunil Kumar Das, Bimal Kundu and Adip Dutta. The gallery will be able to make its mark only if he is able to collect at least some important works.

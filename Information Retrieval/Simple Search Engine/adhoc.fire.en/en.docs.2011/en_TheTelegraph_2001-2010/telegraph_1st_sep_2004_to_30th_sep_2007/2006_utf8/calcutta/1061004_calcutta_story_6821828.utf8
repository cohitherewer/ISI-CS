 Tushar Kanti Mukherjee

 Priest of Salt Lakes CK-CL Block puja and a Corporation 

 employee

 I have been a priest for the past 

 20 years and had learnt the rites and rituals of pujas by 

 assisting my father from a young age. While I back young 

 purohits studying the shastras, I also feel 

 that this is like a science where theory must go hand 

 in hand with practice. There can be no compromise with the 

 mudras, grammar and pronunciation of mantras, and 

 if a workshop can help purohits perfect these skills, 

 then so be it. Workshops are not new. I myself had attended 

 quite a few in Burdwan nearly 15 years ago, but it is only 

 now that the media is publicising them.

 Next Week

 Were the crowds thinner this Puja? 

 If yes, why?

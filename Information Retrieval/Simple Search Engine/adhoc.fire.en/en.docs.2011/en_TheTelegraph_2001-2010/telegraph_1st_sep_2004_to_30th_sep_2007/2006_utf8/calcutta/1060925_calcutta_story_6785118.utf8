Life

 All about my 

 mother

 Chandrima S. 

 Bhattacharya thanks the women in her life, in a sentimental, 

 Oscarly way 

 SEX 

 amp; THE CITY

 Three more days to go and Ma Durga 

 will manifest herself. The Mother is our carer, protector, 

 provider, guide, confidante. I believe that I dont 

 believe, but I tend to see parts of Her in the women who 

 are with me. They are called by different names and are 

 all partly divine. (This is not the time to talk about their 

 human sides.) 

 Since I dont have money 

 to buy all of them gifts, or cant, even if I want 

 to, I seize the opportunity to tell them what I dare not 

 in person. Its the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness 

 and I will be unembarrassedly personal, unabashedly sentimental 

 and Oscarly but I have a feeling that you, too, know their 

 counterparts. 

 I thank my sister. For 

 warning me that a man who claims to love The Outsider 

 and pronounces Camus as Kemas is not to be trusted. Didi, 

 never trust a man who calls Camus Kemas, were her 

 exact words. She was right.

 For believing with me that Sukumar 

 Rays Ho Jo Bo Ro Lo is a far greater work than 

 Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland.

 For telling me that books loved 

 in childhood or early youth are to be revisited with caution 

 they may have changed, too. One such example is Maitreyee 

 Debis Na Hanyate (on which Sanjay Leela Bhansali 

 based his hit film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam without 

 acknowledging it). Never read Na Hanyate beyond late 

 adolescence.

 I thank Mashi. For drinking 

 rum with passion, and with water. For going on a secret 

 date with me to Tangra for a typical chilli chicken and 

 beer lunch at Kim Ling and letting me finish most of the 

 chilli chicken.

 For explaining to me the Window 

 Theory of Life. Your life is like a room, she 

 said. It may be very nice. But always keep a window 

 open. Mashi, Im mushy. 

 I thank my best friends.

 1) For getting me an illustrated 

 copy of Jenny Josephs Warning: When I 

 am an old woman I shall wear purple/ With a red hat which 

 doesnt go, and doesnt suit me/ And I shall spend 

 my pension on brandy and summer gloves/ And satin sandals, 

 and say weve no money for butter I will try 

 to live up to that.

 2) For staying up the nights before 

 exams and realising together that it was another day, but 

 we had only discussed Life, and not Old English.

 3) For teaching me to appreciate 

 Johnny Lever. He is an acquired taste. 

 I thank Madonna, for Papa 

 dont preach. The rest was fine, too, but Papa 

 started it all. (Though I think she betrayed some by turning 

 into such a good mother.)

 I thank Didu. For remembering 

 to chant Dugga Dugga Kali Kali Narayana Madhusudana Janardana 

 Jaya Gopala Govinda Gadadhara Vishweswara every day 

 when I leave for office. In an advanced stage of dementia, 

 at times she cannot even remember what she has just eaten.

 I thank my other Didu, 

 who no longer is, for getting up early to make motor 

 shutir kochuris and a thousand other delicacies 

 for me, many of which I wouldnt eat. I was young and 

 cruel. It hurts now.

 I thank Ashapurna Debi, 

 for Prothom Protishruti and Subornolota. If 

 I ever have a daughter, I will name her Satyabati. If I 

 am still feeling vengeful, I will add Subornolota as her 

 middle name.

 I thank Jane Austen, for 

 Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. 

 I thank my sister-in-law, 

 for baking that cake. It had three layers, white, coffee 

 and chocolate; it had a glazed surface and had caramel carvings. 

 It didnt look real. It wasnt real. It was my 

 fantasy given a shape.

 I thank my mother-in-law. For 

 never mentioning the incident in which I broke the wash 

 basin. It is another thing that I was so drunk that I didnt 

 even hear the ceramic crashing to the floor. The dog didnt 

 bark either.

 Last, I thank Ma. For telling 

 me since the time I remember that it was a shame if someone 

 else tied my shoelaces. For calling me up no less than three 

 times at my work, despite hints. For telling a neighbour 

 that his wig was beautiful, and then being heartbroken as 

 she realised what she did. For telling me that if I have 

 taken a decision, I must stick by it.

 For stressing that theres 

 no need for me to buy a house that unnecessary EMIs make 

 life shabby. For not having a clue to what I connect with, 

 what I listen to, what I read, whom I meet, but knowing 

 what exactly goes on in my mind. (At this point I could 

 burst into tears and round off my little speech, but I suddenly 

 remember a whole lot of other names.) 

 I also thank my first class- teacher, 

 who wore skin-coloured stockings that I thought gave her 

 webbed feet; Helen; Rekha; Angelina Jolie; my senior who 

 gave me my first Sidney Sheldon; the fish-seller in Mumbai 

 who always gave me extra fish, as opposed to the woman who 

 cheated; the woman last night in the share- cab who got 

 the better of the cabbie... In this season of mists and 

 mellow fruitfulness, you are All About My Mother. 

 And now my mother has agreed to 

 watch the Almodovar film, too, with me. I know she will 

 choke on the debauchery but she will go through it for 

 my sake. And she will love it like I did.

 Tress troubleshooters

 Streaked, straightened or permed hellip; there rsquo;s a solution for every kind of chemically-ruined hair. Shradha Agarwal rustles up some repair recipes

 (From top) Kareena Kapoor flaunts her black tresses; rebonding causes major damage to the hair without proper follow-up care; colouring too can lead to mishaps in the absence of attention 

 After the blonde disaster in Aitraaz, actress Kareena Kapoor (thankfully) is back to black. For many of us off-screen mortals too, tress troubles never seem to cease. If the sleek straight look rules the scene one season, its the flirtatious curls that make waves the another. If nothing but fiery red works most times, the style doctors often prescribe a hazelnut hue.

 While keeping abreast with trends ups your style meter like nothing else, frequent makeover is the last thing prescribed for healthy hair. Result: hair that screams out loud for attention and immediate care.

 Some amount of hair care is essential after exposing your tresses to chemical treatments; a post-operative care of sorts. If this post-op care is not provided properly, then damage control is the only other option, says hair and beauty expert Priscilla Corner of June Tomkyns.

 Coloured, streaked, rebonded (straightened) or permed hair, theres a solution to every kind of damage. GoodLife takes you through the hair-raising agenda.

 Colour correction

 The Indian hair fashion scene has changed dramatically in recent times. Jet black, long hair, once synonymous with an Indian beauty is a rare sight today, observes hair and beauty expert Sudha Bibra.

 Enter, a plethora of choices offered by foreign and domestic brands alike, who tempt you with an exotic colour palette each season. The best way of fighting temptation then becomes yielding to it, triggering a string of hair mishaps, especially for those who dont care enough.

 The non-expensive do-it-yourself colour packages come without any after-care recommendations or an experts guidance. Any tress expert will examine your hairs health and texture and guide you whether or not you should streak or colour your hair, says Sudha, who strongly advises a thorough consultation before and after every colouring session.

 Another hair saver comes in the form of the breathing space that should be allowed before changing colour from one to another. 

 Fashionistas need to avoid whims and fancies. Changing the hair colour and texture is a sensitive issue and you have to give it a gap of five to six weeks before commencing a chemical treatment all over again. Otherwise you will end up with damaged cuticles, excessive hair fall and weakened roots, explains Rita Mohan from Rapunzel. 

 The most vital tip to maintain the lustre after colouring or streaking, however, is using the correct after-care products. Expensive, for sure, but they truly go a long way in preventing damage.

 The colour pigments that are infused in the hair get released with each wash. But special shampoos for coloured hair lock the colour in, explains Priscilla. 

 According to her, reds are the ones that fade the fastest, of the three basic colour families of violet, red and yellow. Hence the red family also needs maximum care. 

 Another damage control measure is a hair spa treatment that revitalises the tresses. These refreshing sessions bring back the lost gloss and lustre.

 Professional hydro-masks are preferred over home oil therapies because these wash off easily with a single shampoo rinse, instead of the double application that unnecessarily strips the hair of moisture, says Priscilla.

 Rebond rules

 Immensely happy with your sleek straight hair one day and crying over that almost straw-like texture the other? Welcome to new-age tress woes, far more complex than the dandruff and falling hair issues of yesterday.

 But relax, straightening or perming your tresses need not always be such bad news. Like colouring, the thumb rule of following up with the right products applies here too, failing which you have to resort to damage control.

 We use a special repair shampoo followed by an intense moisture mask and a serum. A thorough rinse and a leave-in silk essence complete the treatment, reveals Priscilla.

 Rita feels hair spas do wonders for such allied problems. These sessions manage frizzy hair from root to tip, stimulate and brighten the shine of hair. 

 Another quick pick-me-up is a power dose, a spray that should be left on for five minutes before rinsing out.

 Sudha prescribes a do-it-yourself remedy for damaged straightened hair: Mix olive oil with coconut milk with a teaspoon of honey and vinegar. Apply and leave on for half an hour. Shampoo and comb it straight.

 Like rebonded hair, permed tresses should also be conditioned regularly. The process takes one-and-a-half hours depending on the damage. It involves an application of three types of hair oil, heat treatment and a hair pack made of various herbs like tulsi, methi, bhringraj and jabakusum, adds Sudha.

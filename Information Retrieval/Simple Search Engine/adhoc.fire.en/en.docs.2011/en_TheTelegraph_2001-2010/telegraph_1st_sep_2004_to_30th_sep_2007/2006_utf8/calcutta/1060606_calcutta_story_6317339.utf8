 What do you do if you got a film premiere invitation card with a Disprin tablet stuck to it? Well, you go Ghoom! The creative (read crazy) heads behind MTV?s dream ? they call it their biggest mistake yet ? project just wanted to make sure that the audiences were ready to combat the headache that could follow the first look at the Fully Faltoo spoof on Dhoom.

 But that didn?t intimidate the 200-odd people who turned up at the black(!) carpet premiere of the hour-long parody movie at the INOX multiplex in Nariman Point. Not only did Dhoom director Sanjay Gadhvi make it, there was everyone from Usha Uthup and Bappi Lahiri to Kunal Kohli and Pritam ready to sit through the mad comedy.

 And yes, it was funny. When you have MTV?s brand of tadka applied to a blockbuster hit like Dhoom, it really can?t go that wrong. ?There were just too many elements to spoof ? the bikes, the babes, the storyline,? Ashish Patil, vice-president and general manager, creative and content, MTV Networks India, told Metro.

 The real funny moments, though, crop up every time the famous MTV caricatures come into the frame. So, you have Kaun Abraham?s (Gaurav Chopra) biker gang comprising lookalikes of Sanjay Dutt (in tez dhaar mode), Sunny Deol (who only shouts Balwant ke kutte!) and Salman Khan (straight out of Tere Naam). Amitabh Bachchan?s doosra makes fleeting ? and hilarious ? appearances as Black?s Devraj Sahai, Bunty Aur Babli?s Dashrath Singh and of course as the KBC quizmaster. Even age-old gags like Sanjeev Sholay Kumar being asked the time, work.

 Sumeet Raghavan, who plays Abhishek Bachao based on Bachchan junior?s character, is the pick of the lot. Sporting shorts throughout the film, he manages to generate a laugh even when dead serious. Watch out for the scene when he starts playing antakshari at the climax.

 The whole concept may be very new to India and replete with Bravery Certificates ? for sitting through the film ? and Ghoom caps as giveaways at the end of the movies. It may sound a tad far-fetched for the paying janta, but it seems to have worked.

 As the INOX (Forum) spokersperson told Metro, Ghoom has managed to rake in an average of 80 per cent occupancy at the Elgin Road multiplex, including more than a couple of house-full shows.

 Back on the small screen, MTV is flooding the airwaves with loads of new shows. Launched last Saturday evening was MID, which has nothing to do with Agent Ethan Hunt?s exploits.

 MTV Ishq Deewane chronicles the love lives of celebrity TV couples like Shweta and Manav Gohil, Rajeshwari and Varun Badola, Neelam and Ronit Roy, Manasi and Rohit Roy... ?It?s very mainstream, yet very MTV,? says Patil. ?It?s a recreation of how the couple met and to what extent one of the two will go to display his or her love for the other.?

 Next up is TV Star of the Month, very much in line with Apna Artiste of the Month, only this time it?s a famous face from telly.

 And the first to be honoured is Johny Lever, who started his own stand-up act on the small screen earlier this week.

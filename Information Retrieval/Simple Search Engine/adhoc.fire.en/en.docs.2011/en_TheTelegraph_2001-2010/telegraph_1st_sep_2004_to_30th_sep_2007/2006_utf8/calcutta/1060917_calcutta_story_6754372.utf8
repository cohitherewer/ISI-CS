 A 

 THOUGHT FOR FOOD

 What: 

 Road to Pakistan Truck Art and Food Festival.

 Where: Saffron at The Park.

 When: Till September 24.

 Take a look: A splash of 

 vibrant colours adorns the entrance and the interiors of 

 the restaurant. Anjum Rana, representing the creative and 

 entrepreneurial spirit of Pakistani women, has presented 

 the traditional flamboyant truck art on aluminium plates, 

 enamel mugs, truck doors, mirrors, miniature trucks, canvases, 

 coal irons, teapots, keychains and more.

 Anjum has brought folk artist 

 Ghulam Sarewar from Peshawar to recreate truck art within 

 the restaurant and two chefs, Hidayat Rehman from Chakesar 

 and Abdul Rashid from Narowat, to whip up Pakistani delicacies. 

 You can also pick up a few mementoes from the exhibits.

 The spread: While you sip 

 on some shikanji, you can munch on Tandoori Aloo, 

 Paneer Tikka Peshawari, Patta Tikka or Mahi Lahori.

 In the main course, you can enjoy 

 Kashmiri Mix Subzi, Chikkar Chholey and the eternal favourite 

 Sarson Ka Saag. In the non-vegetarian section, you can dig 

 into Karhai Murg, Baluchi Sajji (pot-roasted chicken cooked 

 with potli masala) or Nalli Nahari (lamb tempered 

 with creamy yoghurt and nihari masala).

 You can relish all these with 

 Naan Baluchistan (naan stuffed with mutton mince 

 and fresh coriander), Makke Ki Roti, Saffron Pulao or Kabuli 

 Pulao (fragrant basmati enriched with raisins, 

 cherries and nuts). End on a sweet note with desserts like 

 Rasmalai, Kheer, Kulfi Falooda or Gulab Jamun.

 Pocket pinch: The items 

 on the a la carte menu are priced between Rs 65 and Rs 495.

 Voiceover: Truck 

 art is a very popular art form in Pakistan and it is no 

 longer confined to the north-western province. The folk 

 art has given rise to an industry now, shared Anjum.

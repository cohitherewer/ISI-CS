 Scuffle at late soiree

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Eight people, four of them policemen, were injured in a fight between members of a Tangra club and police early on Sunday. The trouble started when police turned up to stop a function organised by the club at the intersection of DC Dey Road and Mathurbabu Lane, off Jana Swasthya Kendra, around 12.45 am. The club members resisted the cops. Four of them were arrested. 

 The club did not have permission to continue the programme beyond 10 pm. Some local residents complained about the blaring loudspeakers, said a Tangra thana officer.

 The club members alleged that the policemen roughed up women and children while trying to stop the programme.

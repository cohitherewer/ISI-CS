 Weeklong regimen to rein in revelry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If party spirit will pick up from this weekend, so will police vigil.

 A weeklong revelry regimen has been drawn up to keep things under control from Christmas Eve to New Years Eve.

 And target number one for police on the prowl will be drunken driving. A group of special officers will be posted near all discs and hotels during this period to check the menace. More than 10 breathalysers have been brought in for the purpose.

 The traffic brass has identified a few thoroughfares where vigil will be intensified to slam the brakes on rash driving during party nights. EM Bypass, Park Street, Camac Street, Ballygunge Circular Road and Southern Avenue figure high on the extra-measures list.

 Every traffic guard has been instructed to send in a list of officers on special duty to keep a check on motorcyclists without helmets.

 Drunken driving and motorcyclists without helmets are two of our major concerns at this time of the year. We have decided to start checking with breathalysers outside the hotels and discs so that drivers are not able to take their seat in an inebriated state, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic department).

 There are plans not to allow two-wheelers on Park Street on two successive Sunday nights, while motorcycles with three riders will be stopped and penalised all over town. On December 24 and 31, traffic cops will be out on the streets till 3 am, manning all major revelry routes.

 The security cover will strengthened, from streets to hangouts. Surprise checks inside discs and a hawkeye on private rooftop parties are among the measures being drawn up by police.

 Earlier, policemen would only be deployed outside hotels housing discs. They would step in only when asked by the authorities. But this year, our men will also keep a watch on what is happening inside, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Last year, there were complaints from residents of adjoining apartments accusing organisers of violating sound-limit restrictions, added an officer. This time, we will stop such parties if the complaint is valid.

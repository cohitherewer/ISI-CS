 Whats been cooking? This time it was payesh and more at The Telegraph Whirlpool Bijaya Utsab held at Jamuna Banquets on Sunday afternoon.

 Of the 300 entries received for the payesh recipe contest, 40 were chosen to come with their prepared dishes on Sunday for a final round of judging. A live demonstration of microwave cooking by Whirlpool set the mood for the gourmet affair as Sujan Mukherjee, executive chef of Taj Bengal, and cookery consultant Somnath Bhattacharya rolled up their sleeves and got down to some serious business. While one conjured up Saffron Rice, the other sweetened the affair with traditional Chandrakala.

 And it wasnt just the professionals at their best. Anybody who saw the unique varieties of payesh and sweet displayed on the long white-cloth tables that bordered the room would know how much effort the participants had put in.

 Different kinds of payesh Kamala, Luchir, Nikhutir, Daber, Egg Rosogollar, Wheat, Gajorer and Narkel Narur were only a few of the mouth-watering selections of payesh the homemakers had dished out.

 This was my mothers recipe. She passed away last year and I thought this was the perfect way to show my respect to her. Plus, less preparation time makes it ideal for working women like me, said Anjana Banerjee who made an interesting Bandha Gobi Payesh.

 I tried to keep my dish Chhanar Barfi Payesh traditional but with a touch of something new, gushed another participant, Soma Ghosh.

 The chefs judged the dishes on the basis of taste, novelty, presentation and food-value.

 If you think the audience comprised women only, think again. Quite a few husbands seemed to have an equal interest in perfecting culinary skills. I am interested in cooking and frequently spice up a few dishes at home, smiled Kumar Chatterjee, who accompanied his wife Nupur to the event. They walked away with the best couple prize sponsored by Whirlpool.

 l participants were given certificates and Whirlpool Microwave Starter Kits. The top three Mahua Singh Karmakar, Preeti Chatterjee and Dolly Jain won gift vouchers of Rs 3,000, Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,000 respectively.

 While the gala cooking session was being compered by actress Aparajita Auddy in one hall of the Jamuna Banquets, children of various age groups gathered to participate in a Sit Draw competition in the next. The kids were divided into sub-junior, junior and senior categories. The topic: Healthy Living. 

 I drew a girl eating healthy food like fruits and vegetables, said an excited Prachi Saraogi who came first in the sub-junior division, followed by Meghna Kundu and Shalini Gami. Maitrayee Mullick, Meghna Banerjee and Gangotri Dutta took the first three slots in the junior section, and Pallavi Majumdar, Shibani Bhattacharjee and Ashna Singhal ranked first, second and third in the senior section. All participants were given certificates and a bagful of goodies filled with Krrish masks, Beyblades, crazy balls, sweets and balloons. 

 l winners were felicitated at a prize distribution ceremony in the evening at Vidya Mandir, followed by a musical performance by Pratik Chowdhury.

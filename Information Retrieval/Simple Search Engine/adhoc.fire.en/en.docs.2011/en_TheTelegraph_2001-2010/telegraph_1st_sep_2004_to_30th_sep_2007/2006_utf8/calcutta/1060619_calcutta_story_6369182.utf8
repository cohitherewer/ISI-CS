 College plot order axed

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The state land and land reforms department has cancelled an earlier order allowing conversion of the character of a plot that falls within the East Calcutta Wetlands, on which a private engineering college is coming up.

 The plot (2139/2375 of the Dakshin Dhapa-Manpur mouza, under Calcutta Leather Complex police station) had been converted from shali (low-lying agricultural) to bastu (residential) land. 

 The recent order, issued by joint secretary in the department K. Bandyopadhyay to the additional district magistrate and land and land reforms officer of South 24-Parganas, restores the original character of the plot, thereby making the future of Bengal Institute of Technology (BIT) uncertain. 

 According to rules, construction is not allowed on shali land.

 The order, copies of which have been forwarded to the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police and the state pollution control board, has asked the district administration to file an action-taken report on the restoration of the plot character.

 A.K. Roy, general manager of the group that runs BIT, said: ?Part of our college is coming up on the plot? We hope the matter will be resolved amicably.?

 Sources said the land and land reforms department order adds teeth to an order of the pollution control board that asked BIT ?to shift... on or before March 31, 2007?, as ?the institute falls within the East Calcutta Wetlands area?, a Ramsar-recognised site where development activities are banned under a Calcutta High Court ruling.

 ?According to the court order of 1992, no conversion of land character is allowed within the 12,500-hectare East Calcutta Wetlands, which has been classified as a waste recycling region,? said Dhrubojyoti Ghosh, who won international awards for his pioneering work on the wetlands.

 An environment department official said the directive on the BIT plot will sure open a ?Pandora?s box?, as the character of several plots within the wetlands have been altered, violating rules.

 Citing examples, he said a huge housing estate is coming up in Kochpukur and a number of commercial establishments have been planned near Parama Investigation Centre, on EM Bypass. 

 ?It?s amazing how such a change of land character was allowed by the land and land reforms and the environment departments, despite the court order,? wondered an environmentalist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Anil Kumar Chatterjee

 Chicken-seller, Jodhpur Park market

 This is an outbreak of panic. The way the media is going about giving publicity to the non-existent disease is shameful. I have been in this trade for 30 years now. I have seen nothing like this ever. In the early 80s, there was a panic, but that lasted only five-six days. Customers are avoiding me like the plague. ?Sorry,? is all they say from a distance. I have tried to reason with them, but they say that even if they buy, the women are refusing to cook chicken. Even chicken stored in the refrigerator was being thrown away. Every Sunday, I sell close to 50-60 birds. The first Sunday after the panic, I could not sell a single one. The next Sunday, I sold just nine. If this mindless trend continues, we will be out of business.

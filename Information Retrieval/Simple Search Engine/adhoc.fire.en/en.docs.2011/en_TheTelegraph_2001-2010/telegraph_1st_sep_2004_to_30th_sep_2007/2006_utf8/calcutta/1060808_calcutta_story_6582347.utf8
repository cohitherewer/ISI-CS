 Labourer dies of septic tank gas

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 29-year-old labourer, Raju Rao, died after inhaling a poisonous gas emanating from a septic tank under construction on Diamond Harbour Road, in Thakurpukur, on Monday evening.

 Three others who went in after him were taken ill and rushed to hospital. The condition of one is critical.

 The three-storeyed building near the 3A bus stand, where the tank is being constructed, has been cordoned off and a police picket posted nearby.

 The incident took place around 5 pm. We are trying to find out the nature of the gas, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). 

 A preliminary probe has revealed that Raju had gone in to fetch the wooden planks that are being used to construct the tank. As he was not coming out, three of his co-workers Suri Rao, Sheikh Selim and Kesto followed him in.

 But there was no sign of the four emerging from the eight-ft-deep tank. The other labourers raised an alarm, prompting local residents to alert the fire brigade and police, said an officer of Thakurpukur thana.

 The four were brought out by the firemen and rushed to Vidyasagar Hospital, where doctors pronounced Raju dead. Kesto was shifted to MR Bangur Hospital, as his condition was deteriorating.

 Borough XIV chairman Sovan Chatterjee said: A team of engineers was supposed to inspect the construction. I will find out if it has submitted the report, which will help us ascertain whether there was any irregularity in construction.

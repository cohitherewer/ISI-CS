 Now, degree in tongues

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Studies in foreign languages are set to get a boost. 

 Calcutta University (CU) has decided to introduce full-time undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses in foreign languages from this year.

 Noticing an increase in demand among students, the university has decided to set up a centre, School of Foreign Languages, under which all the departments of foreign languages, like Russian, French, German, Japanese, Chinese and Korean, will be brought together. 

 ?After passing Plus II, many students are keen to pursue higher education in foreign languages. To fulfil this trend, we have decided to open full-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses,? said Suranjan Das, Calcutta University pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 Analysing the recent trends and demands, the university has decided to start with a three-year undergraduate course in Russian in the current year.

 ?We have decided to begin with a three-year BA honours course in Russian from this year. The course is the most suitable one, as we have quite a few Russian experts in the city, who will be engaged initially,? Das added. 

 At present, the university only offers short-term postgraduate certificate and diploma courses in various foreign languages. 

 The other languages, like Chinese and French, are also in great demand, especially in Bengal. 

 ?Job opportunities for experts in foreign languages are on the rise. There are many openings for translators and interpreters in foreign IT companies, especially in Bengal,? Das added.

 According to university officials, CU has already contacted the various embassies to provide ?efficient teachers? for the proposed courses.

 ?We need efficient teachers, as these will be full-time degree courses. The students may have to pay high tuition fees, as there will be no assistance from the government,? Das said.

 The Japanese embassy has already responded to the university?s proposal and is willing to provide teachers as well as financial assistance.

 Dying with his boots on

 John Hiscock recalls his final meeting with film director Robert Altman

 The ensemble cast of Robert Altmans last film A Prairie Home Companion

 Robert Altman had death on his mind when I talked to him four months ago. The 81-year-old director, who died last week in a Los Angeles hospital, seemed in remarkably good spirits, despite the illness that had caused him to reschedule the interview. 

 Altman was having the time of (his) life. But there was no doubt that he was anticipating his own mortality with a grim fatalism and morbid humour.

 My short-term plan is to wake up tomorrow morning and my long-term plan is to wake up tomorrow morning, he said when I asked him about future projects.

 His latest film and, as it turns out, his last is the folksy drama A Prairie Home Companion, an affectionate, humourous look at an old mans sudden demise.

 I was told not to say its about death, and death may not be the thing that any of us desire particularly, but were all going to face it, said Altman. So the movies about death and I think thats good.

 Our appointment had been postponed from three weeks before, when Altman had been taken ill and had to go home just before our meeting. He sent a message that he would reschedule as soon as possible.

 Altman came close to death a decade ago when he had a heart transplant that he kept secret for fear that no one would hire him if it was known. He finally revealed it at the biggest forum he could find.

 The director, who never won an Oscar despite his record-tying five nominations, announced the transplant when he received the Lifetime Achievement award at this years Oscars in March. He joked that the heart came from a woman in her late thirties. 

 So, by that kind of calculation, he said, you may be giving me this award too early, because I think Ive got about 40 years left on it, and I intend to use it.

 Although he had a reputation for being prickly and brusque Ive got a short fuse and a big mouth, he once said he was charming and amusing during our interview, and he talked for an hour about his life and career, recalling missteps and triumphs with equal relish.

 A tall, imposing figure with a grey moustache and goatee beard, he was dressed in black and spoke softly in a deep voice. He was happy, he said, because he was working and was immersed in preparing what was to have been his next project, a film called Hands on a Hard Body, about a group of people who enter a contest to see who can keep their hands on a car the longest.

 Many of my colleagues, many of my protgs, have a hard time getting a job today, he said. The business has changed quite a bit and its changing a lot more, very fast. I have no idea where its going, but I dont try and chase it. I always come back to what it is that interests me and excites me. So I just keep trying to truck along.

 The famously contrarian film-maker, sometimes known as Hollywoods Grumpy Old Master, was one of the few great directors who was making films in his old age that were just as vital, original and uncompromising as anything he did in his youth.

 He was also one of the very few modern-day directors who was able to work regularly outside the major studio system. He had not made a film financed by a major studio since O C and Stiggs (1983), a stinker that sat on the shelf at MGM for four years before being released.

 A true auteur and utterly unpredictable in his choice of subjects, Altman inverted the conventions of nearly every genre with such unorthodox classics as the Agatha Christie-style murder mystery Gosford Park, the Southern Gothic comedy Cookies Fortune, the Hollywood satire The Player, the blackly comic M*A*S*H, the western McCabe and Mrs Miller, and his film noir, The Long Goodbye.

 Because most of his 40 films showed only a modest potential for profit, he often had to scramble for financing, although he always flourished because he was beloved by actors. 

 Im having the time of my life, 

 he said as he stood up to leave. All I regret is what Im 

 not going to do. I see the light at the end of the tunnel, 

 and I can see the day when I wont be able to do this any 

 more. But Im going to die with my boots on, because I am 

 bored to tears when Im not working. Nothing else interests 

 me very much.

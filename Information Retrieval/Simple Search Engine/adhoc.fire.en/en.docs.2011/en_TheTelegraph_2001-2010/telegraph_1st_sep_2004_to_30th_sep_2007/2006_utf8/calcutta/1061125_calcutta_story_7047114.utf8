 A doctor, lawyer, grandmother, teacher All back to class, as students. Thats the magic of MACE (Modern Academy of Continuing Education), a unit of Modern High School for Girls.

 Launched in 2005, MACE, a centre for lifelong learning has completed a successful year. On Friday, the occasion was marked by an interactive session involving Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, educationist Neil OBrien and Suranjan Das of Calcutta University. It was moderated by Dr Rudrangshu Mukherjee of The Telegraph.

 In the past year, MACE has conducted talks, discussions and some workshops on entrepreneurship, photography, effective parent-child communication, and even foxtrot and ballroom dance. 

 In August, it began foreign language classes and a six-month teachers training course, as part of CUs outreach programme. The training course offers two levels Primary and Secondary and covers six modules psychology education, classroom communication, lesson design, learning in action, technology in education and assessment and evaluation.

 Calcutta is famous for its love for learning and that encouraged us to set up MACE. We offer skill-based education here and dont promise any jobs, said Debi Kar, principal of Modern High School for Girls and MACE director.

 Fridays interactive session began with the governor sharing what he had learnt from former President K.R. Narayanan Do not underestimate a man in his circumstances and do not overestimate a man because of his position and power.

 The session then touched upon various topics, from inclusive education for differently-abled children to the need to eradicate thought control, to a teachers obsession for covering or rather uncovering the entire syllabus, to unlearning at a later stage in life, to the idea of treating life as a university. The governor summed up the proceedings with three vital Es elections for democracy, examination for education and employment for a living.

 At the end of the day, it truly was all about a question of separating learning from education.

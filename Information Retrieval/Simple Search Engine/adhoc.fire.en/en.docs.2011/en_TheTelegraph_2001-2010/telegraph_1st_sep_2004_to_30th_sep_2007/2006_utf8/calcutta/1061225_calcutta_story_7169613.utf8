 Scholars and team spirit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Science is not just about individual excellence; it calls for team spirit as well. This is what those behind Jagadish Bose National Science Talent Search feel, which is why they encourage their senior scholars to work in groups. 

 A senior scholar has to work in a group of two or three, besides participating in four seminars in a year and maintaining good academic performance to remain eligible for the scholarship. We have been doing this for the past three years to encourage team spirit among the youth, said Talent Search director Papiya Nandy.

 Talent Search 2005 scholars Debkishore Mitra and Sakya Sarkar, both students of IIT Kharagpur, have studied airborne aerobic bacteria isolated from active hospital environment and their benzene degrading capabilities.

 Their project bagged the second prize at the annual award event of Talent Search, held on December 20. The first prize went to Mridul Aanjaneya, also of IIT Kharagpur.

 Chief guest at the programme was Satish Kulkarni, a scholar of the first batch, now working as counsellor for science, technology, environment and health affairs at the US embassy, New Delhi.

 The Talent Search has been in existence for over four decades and aims to identify and motivate students with a knack for science towards a pursuit of excellence.

 To achieve the objective, the institution provides scholarships to students from disciplines of basic sciences, engineering and medicine. 

 The scholars get a monthly stipend of Rs 500 and a yearly book grant of Rs 1,000 till the completion of B.Tech, MBBS or M.Sc.

 This year, the scholarship went to 23 students from IIT Kharagpur, Presidency College, Jadavpur University, Institute of Engineering and Management, Medical College and Hospital and NRS Medical College and Hospital, among other institutes.

 The Talent Search also gives out junior scholarship to school students from the Northeast. This year, 27 students bagged the scholarship. 

 South Point High School bagged the best school award for producing the maximum number of scholars.

 We aim to instil in students a sense of wonder about science and love of the subject, signed off Nandy.

 All eyes were on Rajesh Pratap 

 Singh on the penultimate day of the India Fashion Week Spring 

 Summer 2006 on Saturday and the designer, as usual, did 

 not disappoint. A break from his trademark black-and-white 

 palette with the introduction of flaming reds and fluorescent 

 yellows was like a whiff of fresh air in a fashion week 

 dominated by pastels and neutrals.

 Prataps evening show at 

 The Grand in New Delhi was unfurled against a backdrop done 

 up with wall clocks, with each clock showing a different 

 time of day. A cloth pouch containing a pack of marshmallows 

 and a pair of blinkers greeted each member of the audience, 

 reminding one of the condom and earplugs packed neatly inside 

 a stainless steel tiffin carrier that the designer had handed 

 out during his show at the India Fashion Week 2005.

 The silhouettes were pretty much 

 the seasons favourites a wide variety of short dresses, 

 pencil skirts, knee-length flared skirts, shorts, fitted 

 shirts nipped at the waist, oversized shirts Pin tucks 

 and raw-edged cutwork dominated the first part of the line, 

 also marked by broad belts and big buttons. Starting off 

 with pure whites, the collection moved on to pale pinks, 

 blues and ashes, giving way to a sparkling line in silver 

 with huge fluorescent floral accents. The remarkably brief 

 show came to an end with a couple of floor-dusting dresses 

 in bright red, decorated with big white flowers. Models 

 with red mouths and clean faces carried huge hobo bags. 

 The collection is very basic, wearable and very spring-summer, 

 is all that the designer said about his winning line.

 The other big name of the day 

 Ashish Soni wrapped up the evening with a show sponsored 

 by Nokia. With Nokia ringtones making up much of the music, 

 the designer unveiled a line that shouted out his signature 

 style. Unusual tucking and cowl pleating formed the mainstay 

 of the collection that included baby doll dresses, multi-tiered 

 skirts and tops, shirts, capes, trousers, boleros, summer 

 jackets, shorts, box-pleated skirts, yoke dresses, off-shoulder 

 dresses and more. The palette picked on beiges, greys, blacks 

 and brilliant whites. Silks, airy cottons, voiles, linen, 

 jerseys and lightweight wool formed the fabrics. The overall 

 classic look was given innovative twists with random tucking. 

 The out-and-out international garments were accessorised 

 with chunky silver ornaments for the neck, hair and wrist, 

 and chic clutches.

 Stalwarts Meera and Muzaffar Ali 

 showcased a line called Khattati in the afternoon. 

 The inspiration was present in a part of the line, with 

 Khattati or Urdu calligraphy embellishing the garments. 

 The general look was ethnic, with extensive use of kalamkari 

 prints, with a dash of cutwork and chikankari. Mid-calf 

 flared skirts, wrap tops, kurtis, front-open long kurtas, 

 mid-calf dresses, panelled high-waist kameezes, knee-pants 

 and saris made up the line, with shararas teamed 

 with most silhouettes. The palette was vibrant India red, 

 green, blue, orange, purple, moss, gold, black and more.

 Earlier in the day, designer Krishna 

 Mehta unveiled a light and breezy line of flowing georgettes, 

 muslins and chiffons and florals, aptly titled The Flight. 

 Style has no limitations; it is a very liberating 

 experience, with the only restrictions being of your own 

 making, Krishna explained. Shirts, billowing jackets, 

 trapeze dresses and voluminous skirts in endless layers 

 were decorated with hand-painted desert blooms and roses, 

 combined with hand-sewn beads and hand-pleated lace. Feminine 

 and romantic, the collection boasted a fresh flowery palette 

 of ecru, peach, pistachio, emerald and salmon. Its 

 all about dressing with fun, energy and vivaciousness, in 

 a modern casual way, smiled the designer.

 Saturday also had a Calcutta connection, 

 with designer duo Swapan and Seema unveiling a line called 

 Madame Butterfly. The duo, with a studio on Sarat 

 Bose Road, has been a regular at the fashion week since 

 2002, clearly raised the bar this time. The western line 

 of knee-length dresses, wrap dresses, knee-length skirts, 

 shirt dresses looked fresh, with neat and crisp cuts and 

 floral prints. The ethnic range of cocktail saris and lehngas 

 with pearl and crystal handwork, however, could have done 

 with a lot less shine and shimmer. A pale palette of pink, 

 smoky blue, taupe and whites was soothing. Madame Butterfly 

 is surely the best collection Swapan and Seema have showcased 

 at the fashion week so far, but they still have some way 

 to go.

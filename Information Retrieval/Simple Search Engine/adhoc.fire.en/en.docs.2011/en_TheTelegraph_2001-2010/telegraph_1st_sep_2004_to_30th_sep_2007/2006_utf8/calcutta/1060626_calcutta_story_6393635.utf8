 Dazzle den with heritage halo

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 A sprawling three-storeyed mansion with huge black gates, an open courtyard, lion murals on the walls, colourful stained-glass window arches and hanging lanterns exudes old-world charm from every nook and cranny. A typical north Calcutta zamindar house, renovated retaining every bit of the old-world flavour, houses a brand new showroom of Anjali Jewellers.

 Anjali Bati at 38 Sri Aurobindo Sarani in Sovabazar threw open its large iron gates to Calcuttans on Friday evening.

 While the 1,500 sq ft ground floor houses the fifth Anjali Jewellers showroom in the city, the two floors above it will be let out for weddings and other functions.

 This was a dream that we nurtured since the inception of Anjali Jewellers. North Calcutta has managed to hold on to tradition through all these years. And there couldnt have been a more befitting format for a jewellery store here than one that draws on the era of the babus and zamindars, says co-proprietor Anargha Chowdhury. The market here has potential and a good understanding of jewellery.

 While retaining ethnic appeal, the store also takes care of every modern retail need. A huge parking space, for instance, sets the tone for a hassle-free shopping experience.

 The showroom is divided into three sections, on three sides of another courtyard. The entrance leads to the heavy jewellery section. Chandeliers and ornate floor skirtings, wooden sofas with carved legs and rich upholstery and Egyptian paintings create a baithak khana ambience. On offer is wedding jewellery ? broad necklaces, elaborate earrings, bangles, maangtikas and baajubandhs. The showstealers in this section are sets with gold meshes, combined with rhodium polish metal and stones.

 A passage around the courtyard leads to the lightweight jewellery section. The walls of the passage are adorned by photographs of bejewelled women. 

 The lightweight jewellery section called Johuree Bazaar is done up in blue with ceramic skirting on the walls. Mirrors all around give a feeling of ample space.

 This section has been built on the lines of a naachghar. Here the focus is on jewellery for gift purposes and the prices are pocket-friendly, claims Anargha. 

 Ear tops, pendants, pretty lockets strung with beads and rings make up the collection. Silver jewellery in tribal motifs is a definite eye-catcher. There are costume jewellery sets with semi-precious stones.

 Next is the diamond section that draws on the favourite pastime of yore ? hunting. Tiger and deer heads find place on the walls. The designs here are sleek, with diamonds set in yellow and white gold. In some, diamond has been combined with pearls, rubies, emeralds and tourmalines. For men there are rings, tie pins, cufflinks and kurta buttons.

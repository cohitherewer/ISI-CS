 Upgrade pat for campus

 - Shibpur university chosen as centre of national importance

 ANASUYA BASU

 After weeks of indiscipline and unrest on campus, theres some good news for Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu). 

 A survey conducted among seven reputed technology institutes across the country has found that the oldest engineering college in Bengal is the most suitable for upgrade to IIT status. 

 The Anandakrishnan committee, which assessed the seven institutes on parameters like academics, infrastructure, governance, student admissions and preference of academic community, has published the finding in its report. 

 The upgrade will come about by March 2007, beamed Besu vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea. According to him, the tag of Institute of National Importance (INI) will put Besu on a growth path, as funds will start flowing freely to the Shibpur campus. 

 Individual IITs have far more financial autonomy, with an annual recurring corpus fund of Rs 100 crore that it can spend on any head it deems fit. Besu receives a mere Rs 15 crore from the state government under the head of salaries and grants, he explained. 

 The Union ministry of human resources development had commissioned the survey in seven institutes shortlisted by the M.K. Joshi committee to prepare a roadmap for upgrade of engineering institutes to IIT status. 

 Besu made it to the top of the list with a total score of 247.19, leaving behind Cochin University of Science and Technology at 241.76 and Institute of Technology, Benaras Hindu University, at 238.32. 

 Jadavpur University (JU) came a poor sixth with 153.79 mainly because the committee felt delinking the engineering faculty of JU from the parent university does not appear to be feasible. 

 Though Besu will get IIT status, the name will be different. According to the recommendation of the Anandakrishnan committee, the institutes conferred the status will be named Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology. 

 The three-member panel has suggested the IIT model of governance for the institutes, with the President as head. Their legal status as INI and their functions will be prescribed by an Act of Parliament. Their financial resources and recurring expenditure should be derived from central funds. Other funds from state governments or agencies, if any, should be without strings attached to preserve their autonomous character, the report said.

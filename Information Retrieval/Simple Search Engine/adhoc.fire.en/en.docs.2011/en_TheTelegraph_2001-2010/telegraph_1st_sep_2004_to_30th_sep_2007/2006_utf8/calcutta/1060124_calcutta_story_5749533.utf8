 Pullout from green panel

 - Two nominated members quit over pollution board dealings

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 How clean are the clearances issued by the state pollution control board to big projects? The question can?t be wished away, in the wake of the resignation of two members from the board?s nine-member panel that conducts public hearings on the projects.

 Scientist Partha Ghosh and environmentalist Biswajit Roy Chowdhury quit the panel in December, citing ?lack of transparency? in the way hearings were being conducted. They were among the three non-government members, nominated by police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee.

 ?There was great pressure on us to approve the projects at a single hearing. My reputation would have been at stake if I had continued on the panel, which used to sanction projects on the basis of flimsy environmental impact assessment reports submitted by the promoters,? said Ghosh, who resigned on December 16.

 Two days later, Roy Chowdhury followed suit.

 According to rules of the environment and forest ministry, any project that involves more than 100 apartments or an area of more than 60,000 sq ft or use of more than 50,000 gallons of water will have to be passed by the panel. The process includes public hearings.

 Advertisements for the hearings have to be published in two newspapers, so that residents of the area where the projects are to be located can voice their concerns, if any. 

 ?But people?s participation was never sought and the hearings were mostly closed-door affairs,? alleged Roy Chowdhury. ?The environment impact assessment reports were grossly inadequate and also misleading.? 

 He had pointed out the lapses to the board?s member-secretary in November and suggested that either a field visit be arranged or the hearing deferred. The member-secretary did not bother to reply, prompting Roy Chowdhury to quit.

 The board, however, has ignored the resignations and sent notices to both for another hearing.

 Police commissioner Mukherjee has taken a serious view of the matter. ?It appears Ghosh has serious reservations about the manner in which public hearings are conducted. He is a renowned scientist and his resignation should be taken seriously,? Mukherjee wrote to environment secretary Asim Barman on Tuesday. 

 ?The working of the panel has to be reviewed. I?ll take up the matter when the new member-secretary takes charge,? Barman said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus in turmoil over uniforms

 - Students refuse to pay

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trouble broke out at Pailan College of Management and Technology, on Amgachia Road, in Bishnupur, on the southern fringes of the city, on Monday, after some students held a demonstration to press their demand for free uniforms.

 The college authorities, the agitating students claimed, were going back on their earlier promise to give them uniforms gratis.

 The students alleged that hoodlums brought in by the management fired from their revolvers and also lathicharged them while they were holding a demonstration. However, the college authorities denied the charges.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta has confirmed that the private security personnel of the college did fire two rounds in the air, but no one was injured.

 The college authorities complained that the agitating students locked them in for nearly four hours from 10 am and damaged college property. 

 Students of the second and fourth-year master of computer application (MCA) have, for the past few days, been protesting against the fees charged by the college authorities for their uniforms.

 The students claimed that earlier, the authorities had promised them free uniforms. 

 ?All of a sudden, they told us that each student will have to pay Rs 1,650, which we have refused. We have been protesting their decision for some days. 

 ?Today, while we were demonstrating, a Maruti van carrying some goons arrived on the campus and started firing at us. They lathicharged us, and some students, including two girls, were injured. They will have to be admitted to hospital,? said a second-year student of college.

 However, principal Saibal Kumar Mukhopadhyay said some students were fomenting trouble because the authorities had taken a firm stand on attendance. 

 ?The percentage of attendance of some of the students was as low as 45 to 50. According to university rules, it must not be below 75,? the principal said.

 The students whose attendance was low feared that they may face problems during examinations. So, they were out to create trouble, the college authorities said.

 Regarding fees for the uniforms, the principal said on February 15, students were told to pay Rs 1,650. 

 On February 20, it was reduced to Rs 1,000.

 A police contingent brought the situation under control, but the students are quite determined to continue their agitation till the authorities concede their demands.

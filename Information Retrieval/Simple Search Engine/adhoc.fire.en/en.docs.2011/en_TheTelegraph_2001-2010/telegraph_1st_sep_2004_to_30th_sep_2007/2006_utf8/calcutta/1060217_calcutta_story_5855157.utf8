The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Rene Russo You have 

 a fine balance of materialism and spirituality. You enjoy 

 yourself most in the company of learned people. You are 

 highly emotional and a real romantic, happiest in your dream 

 world. You have the ability to appreciate and uphold customs 

 and traditions. Though you prefer to avoid challenges, you 

 never back out of one. ? Kusum Bhandari

 In a bid to combat crime against women in the city, the government on Thursday announced plans to appoint an adequate number of policewomen at all thanas.

 ?We have adopted a policy decision to appoint policewomen at all police stations,? chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the Assembly. ?Policewomen are now deployed at all thanas in the city, except two. We have now decided to increase their number at each police station.?

 Earlier, during the question-answer session, Trinamul Congress legislator Ashok Deb asked the chief minister about the status of deployment of policewomen across the state. Bhattacharjee replied that of the 418 police stations in the state, as many as 253 do not have any policewoman. But in the city, all except two have policewomen.

 Trinamul chief whip Sovandeb Chattopadhyay said incidents of crime against women were increasing, as was the number of women accused. He alleged that the government had failed to take any effective step to prevent crime against women and crime committed by women. He also accused the government of not taking any initiative to appoint policewomen at thanas where there is none.

 The chief minister said the 5,000-odd posts lying vacant at various levels in the police force would be filled up. ?We have already recruited 200 policewomen. They are undergoing training, after which they will be posted at various police stations, including in the city.?

 Home department officials stressed the need for adequate women personnel in the force, in view of the rise in incidents of crime against women. That apart, investigations and raids are also hampered because of the absence of enough policewomen.

 A senior officer said women offenders are gaining in strength in the port, Entally, Bowbazar, Muchipara, Chandni Chowk and the Maidan areas. Several of them are involved in drug peddling, snatching and pickpocketing.

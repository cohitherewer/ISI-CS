 Act, don?t react to beat job stress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 India is condemned to become the world?s capital of heart attacks, strokes, hypertension and diabetes by 2020, and experts feel the rat race up the corporate ladder is among the prime triggers for the impending medical catastrophe.

 Recent research indicates marked increases in stress-related diseases as a result of lifestyles saturated with excessive stress and chronic tension. A ?multifaceted and holistic? approach to combat stress, the silent killer at the workplace, was the theme of a workshop ? Corporate Lifestyle amp; Health ? organised by Apollo Health amp; Lifestyle Ltd and Apollo Clinic in the city recently. 

 Corporate medical officers and HR heads of around 60 companies from various sectors were invited to the seminar, anchored by K.P. Misra, senior consultant of cardiology and director of medical education at Apollo Hospitals, Chennai. The conclave dwelt on stress-management strategies as tools to ?help calm the body and mind?.

 ?Using simple and effective structured guidelines, corporate leaders can participate in developing and implementing strategies for creating a more balanced lifestyle. The outcome is reduced stress levels and increased productivity,? explained S. Chockalingam, chief operating officer, Apollo Health and Lifestyle Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of The Apollo Hospitals Group. 

 ?We must strive to squeeze more life out of living and address the unchecked pressure and feeling of chaos that comes with being pummelled by problems, tasks and interruptions,? observed Misra, who has taught over 90,000 doctors and medical students at all levels in the past two decades.

 Misra?s stress-management mantra is based on the primary pillars of diet, exercise, yoga and relaxation techniques, hobbies and attitude. 

 ?Most of us either overeat or have the wrong kind of food. A low-fat, low-cholesterol, high-fibre diet with adequate supplements of vitamins like B1, B6, B12 and Folic acid plus antioxidants like beta carotene is essential,? he pointed out.

 Regular exercise, positive thinking (?act, don?t react?) and pursuit of a hobby can also help fight urban workplace stress, he added. Recent studies have shown more than 50 per cent of workers in a large organisation believe they suffer from serious job-related tension. Other research indicates 85 per cent of executives fail to use all their earned vacation time. 

 ?Yes, where is the time for a vacation, when we are constantly rushing to meet deadlines?? agrees Shyaontini Rudra, senior executive in an outsourcing agency who attended the seminar and is keen to learn more about stress-busting tools and techniques at work. Chockalingam promised Apollo will roll out follow-up programmes including on-campus interactive workshops.

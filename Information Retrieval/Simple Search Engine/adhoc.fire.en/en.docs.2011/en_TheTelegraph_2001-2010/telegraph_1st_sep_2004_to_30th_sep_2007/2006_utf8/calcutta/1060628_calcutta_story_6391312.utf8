 Lifestyle link to pre-term births

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The changing lifestyle of women has led to a sharp rise in premature births in the city.

 Workplace stress, smoking, drinking, late marriage and lifestyle diseases like diabetes have caused the number of premature babies to shoot up. Doctors said such births have increased from five to 10 per cent of total births over the past five years ? the most affected being working mothers.

 The delivery of a child before 37 weeks is called pre-term, premature in common parlance. A child born between 26 and 28 weeks is severely premature and even with the advanced neo-natal care facilities available in the city, the survival rate is not more than 25 per cent.

 Apart from respiratory distress syndrome, septicaemia and jaundice, premature babies are at times born with permanent physical and mental retardation.

 ?The cases of cerebral palsy and other complications among children born premature have increased in the city,? said neo-natalogist Jayanta Kumar Chakraborty, of AMRI Hospitals. ?Cleft lip and cleft palate, feet disfigurement, eye-related and even cardiac and thyroid problems are common in these babies.?

 Some external factors are also responsible for the rise in premature births. 

 ?The spread of lifestyle diseases, like hypertension and diabetes, has given rise to pre-term labour,? said Ranjit Chakraborty, gynaecologist at Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre and Woodlands Hospital. ?Women are smoking and drinking more these days. Smoking affects the foetus and premature delivery often becomes necessary to save the child.?

 Late pregnancy is another factor. ?Working women often tend to marry late or defer pregnancy. With age, the child-bearing capacity of the body declines, leading to complications and early delivery,? explained Chakraborty.

 Fertility treatment, an option working couples are increasingly exploring, often leads to multiple pregnancy ? twins and triplets ? that may cause premature delivery.

 ?Lungs, kidney and other vital organs and even the immunity system of a premature baby are not developed,? said neo-natalogist Chandan Ray of Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre.

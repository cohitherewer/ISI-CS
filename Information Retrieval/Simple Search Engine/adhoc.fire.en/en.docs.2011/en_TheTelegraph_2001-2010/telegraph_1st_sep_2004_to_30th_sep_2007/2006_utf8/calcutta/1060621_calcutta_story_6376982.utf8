 Plans are afoot to renovate Dakshineswar Kali temple, to take pilgrims and visitors back to its glory days. 

 The trustee board, Dakshineswar Kalimandir and Debuttar Estate, has chalked out a number of programmes to this end. ?Our aim is to take devotees and visitors back to the days when Sri Ramakrishna stayed here. A lot of pilgrims visit the temple every day,? said Kusal Chowdhury, trustee and secretary of the estate. 

 The plan will include restoration of Kuthibari, where Sri Ramakrishna stayed between 1856 and 1871, decoration of Panchavati and other adjacent gardens as described in Kathamrita and other religious source books. This period marked his ascension from Gadadhar to Sri Ramakrishna. Kuthibari used to be an indigo planters? house. 

 The trustee board also plans to relocate the shops to some other suitable place, so that pilgrims can have a full view of Lokmata Rani Rashmoni Temple and the main temple as they enter from the main gate. 

 ?Kuthibari is in a shambles due to lack of maintenance. Our plan is to renovate it first ,? Chowdhury added. 

 The room in which Sri Ramakrishna lived will be rebuilt. Besides, a museum and a library will be constructed, where research books will be kept for scholars and students. Guest houses and meditation rooms have been planned.

 The museum will be based on Sri Ramakrishna?s life. Books related to his life and his teachings will be kept for reference. This will be a place where devotees can spend some time in peace.

 Chowdhury added that the central tourism department has allotted funds for the project and will release them in phases. The renovation work will be carried out by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). ?I have already spoken to urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and CMDA officers. I have requested them to start the work at the earliest,? he said.

 Chief executive officer of CMDA P.R. Baviskar said: ?Some funds are lying with us and work can be started as soon as we get the green light from the state government.?

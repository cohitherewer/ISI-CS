Nine Indian Idol singers, thousands of armymen 

and a remote setting the stage was right for an evening to remember, reports 

Pratim D. Gupta

 The Indian Idol singers and the Tezpur 

jawans in a musical duel

Veeran badi duniya thi meri

Dil kyun na bane paagal?

These lines from Kashmir Ki Kali seemed to 

echo the overriding sentiment of the 3,000-odd army folk who had gathered at the 

Meghna Stadium in Tezpur?s Solmara district on Wednesday evening. The performers 

for the day were nine of the Indian Idol finalists but for the men in green, 

they were nothing short of a Sonu Nigam or a Sunidhi Chauhan.

Confined to their camps and quarters, the television 

set has been the only window to the world outside for these armymen coming from 

three places in Assam ? Tezpur, Misamari and Chardwari. Even the two cinema halls 

in town are either running old films (they were playing Abbas Mustan?s Ajnabee 

last week) or mediocre B-grade stuff. So, a fresh episode of a Kaun Banega 

Crorepati or an Indian Idol is like the first-day-first-show of a Bollywood 

blockbuster for them.

?An army station like Tezpur is still better than 

the ones at the border,? revealed P.S. Shekhawat, an army officer. ?We mostly 

have support staff here who provide the border forces with a lot of aid. This 

is a strategic and tactical station and a lot of important military decisions 

are taken here. Tezpur also happens to be a family station and everyone can live 

here with wife and children.?

 The singers try their hand at shooting

So, the special Indian Idol evening ? meant 

for a Republic Day telecast on a news channel ? turned out to be quite a draw 

with the army people coming in with their families. Even the big guns turned up 

to catch a glimpse of the new singing stars of the country ? GOC of 4 Corps, Lt 

Gen H.S. Liddar was the chief guest. No wonder there was very strict security 

even for an evening like this. 

?Aisa kya roz roz hota hai?? asked an armyman 

from the engineering department. ?We hardly have any entertainment in this part 

of the country,? quipped a captain. It wasn?t surprising then that the 2,000 chairs 

spread across the stadium were filled up by 5 pm for a programme starting at 6.30 

in the evening. In another hour, two big bonfires were readied to combat the freezing 

cold and by the time the show was supposed to take off, the entire stadium had 

gone olive green.

Backstage, in the makeshift greenroom, Ravi Tripathi 

and Panna Gill, two Idol finalists, were signing autographs for schoolchildren. 

The kids were doing everything from serving tea to writing song lyrics for the 

aspiring singers. The finalists had had a long drive from Guwahati to Tezpur and 

only the iPods and walkmans had helped them prepare for the evening show.

 On a different stage

On stage, acting as support staff for the Idol 

singers were members of the 106 Engineer Regiment Jazz Band. They may not 

know little about a Louis Armstrong but they did have their Bollywood funda in 

place. Their jhankaar beats went on to punctuate the soulful renditions 

of the Idol singers, which largely ranged from patriotic stuff like Yeh 

desh hai veer jawanon ka to recent chartbusters like Aashiq banaya aapne.

But it was the singing of the jawans themselves that 

had all eyes welled up and throats choked. When Mohammed Asif dedicated Border?s 

Sandeshe aate hain to his wife staying somewhere far away in the north, 

emotions took over as everyone present in the stadium identified with his heartfelt 

outburst. They also didn?t shy away from taking the floor in front of the stage 

whenever a popular track was sung and although none of them would have ever shaken 

a leg in a nightclub, their no-holds-barred josh more than made up for 

it.

If it was one humdinger of an entertainer for the 

military men in the audiences, it was a humbling experience for the Indian 

Idol finalists, who had travelled all the way from Mumbai for this two-day 

trip. ?It feels so special to sing for all these people who take so much care 

of all of us throughout the year,? felt Calcutta-based Monali Thakur. ?It is our 

first trip out of Mumbai and we are going to treasure every minute of this trip,? 

said Ravi Tripathi, who is from UP and is taking a shot at Indian Idol after 

failing to clear Fame Gurukul.

The morning following the show, the nine singers were 

spotted at 43 Assam Rifles trying their hand ? and legs ? at all those tough drills 

that the army folk have to undergo as training. So, if Panna tried shooting and 

Ravi was playing with the dogs, Sandeep was diving across the grounds and Karunya 

was climbing ropes.

In the weeks to come, most of these Indian Idol 

aspirants would be SMSed out, one by one, by the public but the few hours that 

they spent at the Tezpur camp would sure leave one indelible mark on their mindscape.

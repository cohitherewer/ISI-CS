 Fibre focus

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 What: A display of natural fibre products. 

 Where: Hugli, Hastings Court, 96, Garden Reach Road.

 Take a look: From wood to water hyacinth to cane, the latest value addition at this swank shop stop is a line of natural fibre lifestyle products (picture by Rashbehari Das). Mostly imported from Southeast Asia, there are items sourced from cottage industries across the country, too.

 Kitchenware includes cane containers with covers, in sizes big and small, wooden trays embossed with floral and abstract motifs and wooden containers with cane borders.

 Water hyacinth baskets in earthy shades catch the eye. Pandan and water hyacinth boxes come in sets of three. A big planter made out of tree trunk deserves a look. To fill in, there are bamboo sticks and dry flowers and branches.

 Then there are jute fibre laundry bags with wheels and pandan suitcases in off-white and chocolate brown. Banana fibre floor cushions come in hues of green, black, brown and orange. You also have cushions embellished with coconut shells and beautiful shitalpatis and chatais.

 A big candlestand with a metal frame has two wooden fish in the middle. Another eye-catcher is a palm leaf ludo board with terracotta dices.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 55 and go up to a few thousand.

 Voiceover: This is an effort to stress the use of eco-friendly products, says Madhulika Khaitan, proprietor of Hugli.

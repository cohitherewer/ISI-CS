 The new Indian-American 

 is a dual-careerist, balancing a hip, arty night-time job 

 with a secure daytime career, says TURNA RAY 

 NON-RESIDENT 

 CALCUTTAN

 I am a one-career woman. What 

 did I want to be growing up? The answer was always same. 

 There was no back-up plan, no fail-safe. On my business 

 card, below my name, it says one word: reporter. I thought 

 its simplicity would make an impression. Turns out, Im 

 a slacker. 

 It seems the hyphenated identity 

 of Indian-Americans extends to their professions as well. 

 No longer is it enough to be a doctor, lawyer, or engineer; 

 nor is it acceptable in the NRI community to doodle ones 

 life away in poverty chasing childhood flights of fancy 

 like painting, dancing or singing. 

 So increasingly I meet Indian-Americans 

 who are lawyer-singers, advertising exec-rappers and financier-DJs. 

 They lead double lives, juggling 

 their careers and after-work ambitions with the proficiency 

 and scheduling of a business. 

 To this new breed of high-powered 

 artists, the corporate and creative arent mutually 

 exclusive worlds. 

 They come from good families, 

 hold advanced degrees and for part of their day, work respectable 

 jobs that pay the bills. 

 They seem unencumbered by artistic 

 dilemmas, they dont appear to suffer from creative 

 anguish, and as far as I know, no one has chopped off an 

 ear, yet. 

 To them, the idea of the starving 

 artist is unviable and impractical. You gotta 

 eat, says rapper Raja Wilco, 27, who at his day job 

 as an advertising sales representative for Verizon is know 

 as Raj Desai. 

 Someone can choose to do 

 just art, but they can be poor. Is that a gamble? Maybe. 

 I can balance both. 

 When I called lawyer-singer/songwriter 

 Shaheen Sheik at 6 am in Los Angeles, she was wide awake 

 and already getting ready to go to office where she will 

 work from 7 am to 1 pm and then jet off to the studio from 

 2 pm to 6 pm. 

 Her self-financed debut album, 

 Rock Candy, was recently picked up by Times Music. 

 She is currently working on her second effort slated for 

 release in 2007. 

 Practising law and singing 

 are exhausting. But almost every artist has a day job. Its 

 just that I was blessed with a degree and my waitressing 

 job just looks a bit different. 

 History bears many examples of 

 artists with day jobs. Salman Rushdie wrote his Booker Prize-winning 

 novel Midnights Children while working part-time 

 as a freelance advertising copywriter for Ogilvy and Mather 

 and Charles Barker. 

 While Andy Warhols work 

 as a commercial graphic designer resonates in his art, few 

 can guess that the poet TS Eliot was a banker. 

 Among artists who made it 

 big, few have had the backing of a wealthy family 

 as the prolific Rabindranath Tagore did. 

 Yet for the innumerable artists 

 who are still trying to make it, the sparse economic returns 

 from a life solely dedicated to art is often the main reason 

 for a day job. 

 But the rise of dual-careerists 

 is a phenomenon specific to second-generation NRIs. 

 Unlike in the larger artist community 

 where a serious day job is seen as a lack of commitment 

 to ones craft, within the NRI community, balancing 

 a hip, arty night-time gig with a secure daytime career 

 is seen as a laudable achievement. In fact, for NRIs in 

 the US, youre nobody unless youre an overachiever. 

 For Indian-Americans, their immigrant 

 struggles in the US make them particularly risk-averse. 

 I always say, my parents 

 generation worked hard. But as second generation desis, 

 we work smart, says Nitin Ramlal, who is a senior 

 operations analyst at Freddie Mac and also a music producer, 

 events promoter and DJ in Washington, D.C. 

 Not only is the 25-year-old not 

 starving, he bought his own place. 

 When asked if he would ever shed 

 his DJ Dynamix moniker to be a corporate exec full time, 

 he answers with the logic of a businessman: I have 

 invested $20,000 in studio equipment, I cant turn 

 my back on that. 

 For Sheik and Desai to quit their 

 day jobs, they will have to generate the kind of income 

 that allows them to keep up their current lifestyles. 

 Its an ambitious condition 

 to place on ones art, which is supposed to be driven 

 by passion, not bottomlines. 

 These encounters got me wondering, 

 were the rising artists within the US NRI community 

 serious artists or really smart kids with expensive hobbies? 

 Do they suffer from Jack-of-all-trades 

 syndrome? And without risk, sacrifice, struggle and may 

 be even starvation, does the art suffer? 

 Ramlal, Sheik and Desai certainly 

 take themselves very seriously, work hard and are beginning 

 to make a name for themselves within the NRI community. 

 Thats all fine and well, 

 but what does this mean for us single-careerists? If there 

 is an investment banker out there moonlighting as a reporterIm 

 in trouble!

 Riding on a hilsa high

 With the onset of monsoon every year, Bengal gives way to celebrations of the hilsa. Pailan World School came up with a unique event on July 29 for its students, their parents and staff. Present please, Ilish please, as the hilsa festival was named, showcased the rich culture of Bengal and a spread of over 40 preparations of the fish.

 The programme, held at the Golden Platter Dining Hall on the campus, was attended by a number of eminent persons. The students of the school first performed song-and-dance items based on the theme of villages in Bengal.

 The menu that awaited the guests was a fish-lovers delight. Even the main ingredient in Padma Ganga Mishrana, a hot beverage on offer, was hilsa. In the main course there were many innovative delicacies such as Hilsa Biryani, cooked with the eggs of the fish. And of course there was the all-time favourite Doi Ilish. For dessert, there was Baked Ilish in Sweet Honey. Unlike what was expected by a few amongst the guests, none of the recipes had the fishy stink.

 Besides the hilsa festival, the school also organised a puppet show on road safety by the children.

 No plastic, please

 We made our school a no-plastic zone to spread awareness about how harmful plastic is to the environment. The non-biodegradable material chokes waterbodies and pollutes the soil. Earlier, we used to talk about it, make charts and have debates on the subject. Soon we felt it was time to get into action and contribute to minimising the use of plastic, starting with plastic bags. This is how we went about it.

 There are six groups in the class. Each group has a leader and four others. Every day one group gets the chance to keep vigil at the school gate from 8 am to 8.45 am. The members of the group prevent the entry of plastic bags into the school premises. In exchange of the plastic bag being carried by a student or teacher, the group gives a paper or jute bag to keep the belongings. 

 Even during the recess and when the school gets over, the students of Class VIII are on the lookout for students and teachers who are using plastic bags. Teachers who carry plastic bags are fined Re 1 per bag. Students who are found using plastic bags are given a badge with a crying face to wear.

 We plan to continue this campaign in school for six months. We have even put up posters barring the use of plastic bags in our school. We are also planning to write letters to retail outlets Pantaloons and Westside, urging them to pack their products in paper or jute bags instead of plastic ones. We hope our campaign will help us all change the way we think about and use plastic bags.

 Lost and found

 On Sunday, July 16, at roughly four in the afternoon, I left a copy of Joseph Conrad rsquo;s novel Heart of Darkness in a compartment of a Burdwan local train (chord line) drawing into Howrah station. And then walked nonchalantly along platform no. 5 till a man tapped me on my elbow hellip;

 Rewind to 2003: a copy of Herman Hesse rsquo;s Steppenwolf lies abandoned on a Brighton-London intercity train as two men steal sidelong glances at it from time to time.

 Enough of these inept Le Carr eacute; imitations! It was in 2003 that I heard of www.bookcrossing.com, a unique virtual database of books released and found all over the world. The idea was suggested to founder Ron Hornbaker by PhotoTag.org, a website which tracks cameras released into the wild. Wishing to do the same with books mdash; which along with umbrellas and biros are probably among the most lost articles in the world mdash; Hornbaker came up with BookCrossing.

 It goes something like this: let us say you have a spare copy of a book you want to give away. You join BookCrossing which gives you an ID and password. Then you are asked to enter the details of the book you want to lsquo;release rsquo; mdash; in most cases, entering the ISBN (international standard book number, the barcode thingy at the back of the book) is sufficient. The website then generates a unique ID for the book which you are asked to make a note of.

 The next step is to write an appropriate message inside the book, on the lines of: 

 Gentle reader, this is a good book. Read it and pass it on. And if you are anywhere near a computer, go to www.bookcrossing.com and leave a journal entry for the book after keying in the book ID. And may your teeth rot and fall if you try to sell it!! (Well, maybe not the last line.)

 If you are lucky, the reader who finds the book in the Burdwan or Brighton local will do precisely that. As the book moves on from reader to reader, the journal entries under its ID will track the progress of the book from Baguiati to Baghdad to Baltimore, connecting its temporary owners in a common bond of readership.

 Can this ever work, I hear you cry. That it does is shown by the rising number of books being lsquo;released rsquo; and lsquo;caught rsquo; on the BookCrossing website. So far not too many Indians have joined up though mdash; just about 3,500 compared to about 50,000 in England and over two lakhs in the US.

 hellip;and said, lsquo;Dada, ei boita apnar? rsquo;

 lsquo;No rsquo;, I said with as much hauteur I could muster and walked away. A puzzled man stood on platform no. 5, clutching his Heart of Darkness.

 Next week: In which we meet the champion liar of the world

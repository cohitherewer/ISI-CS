 Tips to share bird flu test load

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bird-flu tests will be conducted in Calcutta, at the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL) in Belgachhia, from April 15.

 Two scientists from the laboratory have been sent for training to the Bhopal-based High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, the only centre in the country where such tests are conducted.

 The antigen and serum samples required for the tests will be supplied by the Centre and the other ingredients by the state animal resources development department.

 ?The two-day training for the researchers, to be conducted by senior scientists of the Bhopal-based laboratory, begins on March 23. The RDDL representatives will be joined by two researchers from Pune,? said Jawaharlal Chakrabarty, additional director of the animal resources development department.

 The move to train scientists from regional laboratories in bird flu tests follows a recent report from the Bhopal centre that its staff was overburdened scanning samples from across the country.

 Accordingly, it has been decided that researchers from laboratories in Calcutta and Pune will be trained first, followed by scientists from Jalandhar and Bangalore.

 ?Calcutta was the first pick, as the laboratory here caters to 11 states in the east and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,? said a senior official of the animal resources development department.

 The tests will be conducted in a new facility on the campus of the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biological, which houses the regional diagnostic laboratory.

 Senior officials of the animal resources development department will meet on March 27 and 28 to thrash out the details of the new laboratory. They will also have a round of talks with a Hyderabad-based consultancy firm.

 The government has decided that West Bengal Milk Federation and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will jointly execute the project.

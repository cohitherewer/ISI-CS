The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taut vigil on ground

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If the fear of flying has gripped the international skies, a heightened security drill is the local ground reality in the run-up to Independence Day.

 There is no specific threat, but we are on an alert. Specialised forces, including commandos equipped with sophisticated weapons, are being deployed at vital installations from Friday night, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K Chatterjee.

 An emergency meeting was held at Lalbazar on Friday afternoon, where the focal point was foiling any possible terror attack. A red alert had been sounded soon after last months serial blasts in Mumbai. We have taken all preventive measures and stepped up vigil, especially at Metro Railway stations, said Chatterjee.

 The security ring around consulates and embassy offices has been tightened. Surveillance has been intensified at public places, including parks, shopping malls and railway stations. 

 Random checking will be conducted and police pickets posted at all 21 entry and exit points of the city. Officers of all 48 police stations have been asked to tighten vigil and intensify night patrolling.

 Scarred by kiss of death

 When Srikumar Das, 35, was about to step out of office on Wednesday evening, he was warned by his colleagues: Be careful, dont land up in a hospital bed! But the foreboding had nothing to do with the near-fatal accident the ONGC corporate communications executive had, an hour later.

 Das had a miraculous escape when a deranged man slipped into the drivers seat of a stationary CSTC bus and drove wildly through the stretch in front of Sealdah station, crushing a man to death and injuring three others.

 One of the injured was Das, who on Thursday recounted the kiss of death from his hospital bed, where he is recuperating from a left collarbone hairline fracture and minor cuts and left bruises.

 The note of warning from his colleagues of landing up in a hospital bed was mere office banter, referring to the driving skills of the co-worker Das was leaving his Chowringhee office with.

 I was supposed to meet my wife and daughter at Ballygunge station but changed my plans and decided to go to Sealdah, as I had finished work earlier than expected. If I had gone to Ballygunge, this would not have happened at all... But it was certainly my fate that saved me, he said.

 I was walking down the narrow stretch in front of the station adjacent to the parking lot when I suddenly saw the bus jerk to life. I could see it speeding towards me but was unable to move I felt as if I was rooted to the ground. In the fraction of a second, my world had turned upside down and I was staring at the underbelly of the bus. I did not feel any pain but my mind was racing. I was thinking how the rear wheels of the bus would crush my skull with a cracking sound, Das recounted softly.

 I shut my eyes... Then, suddenly, I realised that the vehicle had screeched to a halt. I opened my eyes and looked up. I felt as if the mechanical parts would give way any minute and I would be crushed... Slowly, I mustered the courage to crawl out. To my left lay a man in a pool of blood and on the other side was another who was motionless.

 When I saw my wife and daughter a few metres away, I broke down... I experienced the moments before death and escaped alive only by Gods grace, sighed Das.

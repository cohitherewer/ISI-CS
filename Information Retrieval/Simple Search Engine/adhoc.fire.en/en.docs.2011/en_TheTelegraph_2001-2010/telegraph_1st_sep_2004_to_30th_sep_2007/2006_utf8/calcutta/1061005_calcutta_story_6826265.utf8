 Amorous affairs

 Preoccupied with the trials of sustenance, we have all but forgotten to delight in the simple pleasures of daily life. The sheer ecstasy of falling in love or the excitement of a blossoming romance are experiences far removed from the monotonous routine of our humdrum lives. One of his most popular romantic comedies, Tagores Sesh Raksha comes as a breath of fresh air, providing welcome succour to souls parched of all emotion. It presents a frank portrayal of human passions, sensitivities and sensibilities. A tightly-knit plot, vivid characterisation, along with Tagores refined, sophisticated dialogues seasoned with racy wit and sharp humour, provide the perfect ingredients for an evening of intelligent entertainment. The play introduces us to four young people Indumati, Gadai, Kamalmukhi and Binod whose uncertain, oscillating romantic fortunes we follow with anxious anticipation till the very end. Direction: Seema Mukhopadhyay. Hosted by EZCC.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Sesh Raksha, produced by Rang Roop 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

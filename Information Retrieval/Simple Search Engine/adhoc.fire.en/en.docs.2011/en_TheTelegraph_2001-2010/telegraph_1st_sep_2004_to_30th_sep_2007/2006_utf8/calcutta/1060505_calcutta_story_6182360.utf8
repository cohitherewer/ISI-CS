The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 More than just a game

 With 35 days to go for the quadrennial showpiece of the beautiful game to kick off in Germany, Discovery Channel makes a foray into the sports arena with a series that traces the destiny of half-a-dozen participating nations through their footballing fortunes.

 More Than A Game: The Story of the World Cup deals with six World Cup-winning teams ? Brazil, Argentina, England, Germany, Italy and France. ?The series is not a capsule of on-field moments. It narrates how the political, social and economic set-up of a country is linked to the performance of the national team on the football field,? says Rajiv Bakshi, associate director, marketing and communications, Discovery Channel. 

 Brazil?s history, for instance, can be broken into watershed moments of the country?s World Cup victories. Similarly, Germany?s victory in 1954 gave the nation something to be proud of after the post-World War II depression when the team was not even allowed to play in the World Cup. In recent memory, the role of Zinedine Zidane, a second generation Algerian, in France?s Cup-winning feat in 1998 did its bit to unite a nation torn asunder by ethnic issues.

 Coming up next Friday at 9 pm (repeat on Saturday at 10 am and on Sunday at 11 am) is one of Calcutta?s favourite footballing nations ? Argentina. The game had come to the nation from across the sea with the British who kept it restricted to the elite. But it became a people?s game via the poor immigrants from Italy and Spain, with emphasis on craft and cunning. 

 Through a montage of match moments and interviews of sport historians, commentators and footballers, the series reveals little-known facets to construct the bigger picture. When Argentina hosted the Cup in 1978, it was under military dictatorship. The reins of the team were handed over to the chain-smoking Leftist coach Cesar Menotti with unprecedented powers. After a solitary defeat in the initial stages, Argentina needed to bypass Brazil in goal difference to reach the final. The Brazil match had finished earlier and Argentina knew how many goals they needed. Footage from the BBC shows how General Jorge Videla, head of the military junta, was present for the crucial match against Peru. Interviews from the players reveal how the dictator paid a visit to the Peruvian dressing room before the match and spoke about Latin American unity that shook up the younger players. The result was a flurry of goals that raised suspicions about match-fixing. 

 Also on view would be immortal moments like The Hug of the Soul in which a boy without arms embraces two players after the final victory.

 The story also encompasses the individual journeys of personalities, Mario Kempes to Maradona, Gordon Banks to Gary Linekar....

 And even as Rooney?s injury lands the whole of England in a crisis, discover on May 12 in the episode on the country how for the first couple of decades it did not even deign to participate in the tournament. Life does come a full circle on the football field!

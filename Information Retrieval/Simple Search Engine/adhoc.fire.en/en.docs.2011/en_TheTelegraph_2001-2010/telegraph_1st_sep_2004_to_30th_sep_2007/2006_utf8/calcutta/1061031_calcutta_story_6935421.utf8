 Sewer surgery to stop waterlogging

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic engineers have planned a bypass surgery on the sewers under Bidhan Sarani, Rabindra Sarani and Madan Mohan Burman Street to prevent waterlogging in the area.

 The Mechhua-Ram Mandir-Thanthania-Kalabagan-Vivekananda Road belt, home to about two million people, is suffering from the problem for 60 years.

 The water mains under Bidhan Sarani runs from north to south, while the 36-inch underground brick sewer crosses Bidhan Sarani from west to east, said chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose.

 The brick sewers and pipe sewers to the west of Bidhan Sarani are supposed to pour their run off into the 36-inch diameter main sewer. The 30-inch diameter water mains runs through the main sewer, hardly leaving space for sewage. This results in drainage problems in the area.

 According to the civic engineers, a new sewage route must be laid, bypassing the 30-inch water mains. They have chalked out a route to transport the sewage generated to the west of Bidhan Sarani to Palmer Bazar pumping station via the main sewers under APC Road and AJC Bose Road.

 The cost of creating an alternative route has been estimated at Rs 12 crore. The scheme is going to be implemented as part of the Rs 100-crore revamp project for non-man entry sewers under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The work will take about eight months.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya is pinning hopes on the project to stop waterlogging in central Calcutta.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhya said a group of civic engineers led by Supriya Chandra has started a survey of the sewers. The team has been entrusted to design and carry out the bypass surgery.

 The sewers are in a very bad shape in central Calcutta and even when there is no rain, they struggle with the regular household run off, stated a member of the team. 

 Welcoming the move, local RJD legislator Mohammad Sohrab and Left Front councillor Reita Chaudhury has promised cooperation to implement the scheme as early as possible.

 Chaudhury said due to inaction on the part of the civic drainage and sewerage department, residents of the area have been forced to wade through sewage in monsoon. 

 Sometimes households cannot use their toilets for days after a heavy shower because of back flow from the sewers.

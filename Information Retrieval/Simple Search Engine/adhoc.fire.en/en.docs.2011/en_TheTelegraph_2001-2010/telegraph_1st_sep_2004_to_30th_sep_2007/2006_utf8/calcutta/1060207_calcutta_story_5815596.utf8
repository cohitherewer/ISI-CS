 Nature always comes up with a script far more imaginative than anything I could have thought of,? said award-winning wildlife film-maker, writer and producer Harry Marshall. ?I remember when we were filming the Bandavgarh tigers. The region is famous for warring Rajput dynasties. Our heads were full of it when we came upon this massive old tiger named Charger. His rival was his grandson recorded by forest officers as B1. As we studied this young male we realised that there can only ?be one? of his kind. Suddenly, our film gained an almost Shakespearean touch as our cameras recorded the battle between Charger and B1. The film ends with the wounded Charger limping away into his cave to die.?

 With his films The King Cobra and I, Bandavgarh: Temple of the Tiger and Great Cats of India drawing crowds at the 3rd Aranyak Wildlife Film Festival, Marshall was busy conducting a workshop on ?How to market wildlife films internationally? at the British Council. Promoting wildlife film-making in India is, after all, a pet project.

 ?There are a few wildlife film-makers here, but they are not enough,? said Marshall, whose love affair with the Indian wilderness began at birth. Marshall spent most of his childhood in south India, catching and taking as pets a wide variety of snake, mongoose, chipmunk and insects. When he was sent to study English at Oxford ?it was like someone had suddenly turned down the colour of the television? just compare a robin to a peacock or a fox to a lion or tiger and you will know what I mean?!

 Once he co-founded Icon Films in Bristol, ?it made sense to return to India?. Reeling footage through Ladakh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Bengal, Marshall has learnt that India offers more of a challenge than Africa.

 Feel-good films on animal behaviour are on their way out, stressed Marshall. The market is for movies that address environmental issues and people. ?It is, after all, impossible to ignore the impact of people. We are the most influential animals. So in my films you find people in relation to wildlife,? said Marshall, adding that a time is coming when people will crowd cinema halls to see wildlife films.

 ?Films like March of the Penguin, Grisly Man, Wind Migration and Blue Planet have done well commercially,? observed Marshall, pointing out that if wildlife films had a Lord of the Rings kind of budget, the result could be stupendous. ?Truth after all is stranger than fiction.?

 Marshall is currently working on two projects: Crocodiles (for National Geographic and American Public Broadcasting Service) and Tigers at Night (for Discovery and the BBC). The crocodile film will record a search for a 20-ft-long crocodile in Indian waters. The search was prompted by an American organisation for breeding purposes and involved a large reward.

 ?I believe it will be impossible to find such an animal because all of them have been killed. So the failure of the search will add to the film?s success,? said Marshall. The other film will revisit the Bandavgarh tigers where B1 is still said to live. Marshall will use four cameras and the latest technology in nocturnal filming.

 In a bid to develop socio-cultural ties between Calcutta and Delhi, the Calcutta chapter of Karol Bagh Bangiya Samsad organised a cultural festival at Gyan Manch on Sunday. 

 The chapter hopes to extend the socio-cultural activities of the Samsad, established in 1958 in Karol Bagh, Delhi?s famous Bengali para.

 ?Karol Bagh has been our home for more than 15-20 years now. Because of our Calcutta roots, we have opened a chapter in Salt Lake,? said vice-chairman S.K. Gupta. 

 The musical presentation by the cultural unit was one of the main attractions of the show. The Samsad?s Delhi drama unit also presented a satire against sponsorship. 

 ?Though we get local and government donations, members from the Delhi unit also contribute for our social welfare projects,? said Gupta. 

 The Samsad has adopted Raghunathpur, a village in Ranaghat. ?We are supporting a school in the area. We are also building a four-storeyed, 24-bed hospital, which will be inaugurated in May,? added Gupta.

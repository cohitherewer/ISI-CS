 Murder mastermind held

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Arghya Dam, 32, allegedly killed by his brother-in-law, who has been arrested in Indore

 Bappaditya Dey, alleged mastermind in the murder of his 32-year-old brother-in-law Arghya Dam, was arrested in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, early on Wednesday. He was produced in a local court and is being flown to the city.

 Police said Dey, a resident of Hind Motor, in Hooghly, strangled Arghya to death in a hired car on June 10. The motive, they claimed, was to grab property of the Dams.

 ?Ever since our team failed to net Dey during a raid in a Tarakeswar village, one of his relatives had been keeping us posted about him. A few days ago, we got a tip-off that he had put up in a hotel in Indore,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department).

 The sleuths got in touch with their Indore counterparts, including senior superintendent of police Suman Singh Yadav, seeking confirmation. 

 ?After the local Prabhari police station reported that Dey had indeed put up in the hotel, a team left for Indore,? said a senior officer of the detective department.

 Arghya, a resident of Hidaram Banerjee Lane, in central Calcutta, went missing on June 10. His body was found in Dhaniakhali, Hooghly, the next day, though the death was confirmed much later, after Arghya?s mother identified the shirt and shoes found on the corpse.

 Reconstructing the events leading to the murder, police said Dey and three others had hired a Tata Indica and called Arghya on his cellphone on June 10 afternoon, when he was with his wife-to-be at her Foreshore Road home, in Howrah.

 As Arghya reached the designated spot to meet Dey, the four abducted him. They strangled him with a wire while driving down Durgapur Expressway. On reaching Dhaniakhali, they dumped the body.

 On Sunday, the cops had arrested another alleged gang member, Deepak Das.

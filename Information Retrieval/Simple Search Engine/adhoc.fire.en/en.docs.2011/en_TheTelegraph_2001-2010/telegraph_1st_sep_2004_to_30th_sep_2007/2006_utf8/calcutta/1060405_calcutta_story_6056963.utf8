The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Protest blitz to block bill

 - After a day?s closure, church schools gear up for rights fight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Classes in about 700 schools run by Christian missionaries in Calcutta and elsewhere in the districts were suspended on Tuesday, as students, teachers and guardians joined a rally to press for the withdrawal of the School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006.

 More than 10,000 protesters ? mostly from the Christian community ? gathered at Shahid Minar and marched to the Gandhi statue on Mayo Road, where the church authorities threatened to intensify their movement if the government ignored their demand.

 They, however, announced that educational institutions run by them would function normally from Wednesday. 

 The rally organisers will start a signature campaign from Wednesday to spread awareness about the fallout of the bill, which makes it mandatory for all state-aided minority institutions to recruit teachers through the school service commission.

 A relay hunger strike on the first day of the new Assembly session is also on the cards. ?If need be, we will court arrest and even launch a fast-unto-death,? warned Herod Mullick, general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, one of the organisers of the demonstration.

 Lucas Sircar, archbishop of Calcutta, urged the church leaders to persuade the government ?at any cost? to withdraw the bill. ?How will the state government react if the Gujarat government introduces a bill that takes away the rights of the minorities??

 Representatives of a number of reputed Anglo-Indian schools ? despite school education minister Kanti Biswas?s assurance that they would not fall under the bill?s purview ? attended the rally.

 Schools run by the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India, however, stayed open as they have decided to organise a separate movement.

 Mullick argued that church-run schools, known for their excellence, will lose ?their character and uniqueness? if the bill is enacted.

 ?Most missionary schools cater to the common people. Not a single good school will exist if the missionary-run institutions are not allowed to recruit teachers on their own,? he asserted. 

 The bill has put the churches 

 in a fix. If the schools continue to accept government aid, 

 they will have to appoint teachers through the commission. 

 They can avoid interference if they stop accepting the grant, 

 which would mean an increased financial burden that might 

 result in a hike in tuition fees and freeze on teachers? 

 salaries.

 Old boys shape syllabus

 - Joka ex-students suggest ways to improve course content

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 The finance modules are flawless, but the marketing courses need a makeover. Niche programmes like retail management are welcome, but only after thorough research.

 These are some of the suggestions the batch of 1981 threw up, when it met Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta faculty members at a unique workshop to discuss curriculum review at the Joka B-school.

 With so many ex-students around, we thought it was a nice opportunity to pick their brains on a curriculum review, which is an ongoing process here, said Anindya Sen, dean, programme initiatives, IIM Calcutta. 

 The premier B-school has a curriculum review committee that monitors course content and incorporates necessary changes to make the post-graduate management programme relevant to the needs of both local and global companies. This was a first in terms of alumni involvement.

 From discussions on case-study approach in B-school pedagogy to management of information technology-related issues, the batch of 1981 converging on the alma mater after 25 years discussed an entire gamut of issues, taking time off from a rare reunion.

 The old boys and girls including professionals in multinationals and professors in leading US business schools prescribed more stress on live projects and frequent industry-academia interface to improve the institutes branding. 

 All of us were really serious about the workshop and had even formed groups. Now, each group will work on the suggestions and get back to the faculty with specific recommendations, said alumnus Srinivas Eranki, vice-president and CIO, Reliance Industries.

 The alumni members were, however, unanimous that IIM Calcutta has never faltered on keeping its course content up-to-date with the changing trends in management education. 

 Some alumni members, now teaching in various universities around the world, expressed their willingness to visit the Joka campus to offer short courses or conduct lecture sessions.

 The institute will soon approach students from other batches as well. We are inviting suggestions... We have already received more than 50 responses. The faculty will take these into account while reviewing the curriculum, said Sushil Khanna, professor of strategic management.

 And it was not ideas alone that the batch of 1981 promised; some committed to contribute to the Joka coffers.

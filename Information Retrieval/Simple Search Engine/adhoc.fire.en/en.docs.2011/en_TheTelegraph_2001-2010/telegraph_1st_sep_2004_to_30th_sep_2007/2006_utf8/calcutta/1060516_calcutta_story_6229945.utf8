 Newcomers to the world of crime

 It was non-stop fun at 

 Kids Day Out that kicked off at Calcutta Swimming Club 

 on May 6, with a host of events, on and off-stage. The 

 last of the four parties will be held at Punjab Club 

 on May 21. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 Sellers of fake CDs in Chandni 

 Chowk have adopted new methods to hoodwink the law enforcers 

 and continue with their illegal business. Apart from selling 

 pornography to regular customers, they are now engaging 

 young boys to entrap unassuming first-time shoppers to the 

 area.

 These boys keep repeating the monotonous mantra ?CD chahiye?? to all passers-by. Those who know the area well don?t fall for the trap, but newcomers end up asking them where they can get MP3 or game CDs. The young man then promises the best deal and leads the customer through narrow bylanes to a nondescript shop tucked away in a corner. A man fishes out a CD without a cover or label and convinces the buyer that it contains all the songs that he had asked for.

 After a gruelling bargain, when the CD is sold, the seller makes a direct offer on his latest pornographic ware. He tries his level best to convince the buyer to take one.

 The CD purchased usually turns out to be a VCD comprising a ?D-grade? Bengali or Bhojpuri film. These VCDs are specifically targeted at chance customers who venture into the area but are not in search of porn. Later, when the customer returns for a refund or an exchange of the product, the seller hurls abuses at him and denies having sold it at all.

 Most of these dealers are in the age-group of 15 to 23 years.When asked why they had joined the illegal trade, they said: ?We haven?t ever been to a school. This is the only way we know to earn our livelihood. We never return money or exchange the goods once sold.?

 The bragging lasts only till they sight a cop. Soon, they melt into the bustling crowd. Young and shrewd, they are the GeNext law breakers. Their future is doomed in the murky world of crime.

 What?s on your mind this week

 Merit matters

 There is a huge uproar about reservations 

 for SC/ST candidates in prestigious educational institutions. 

 What is worrying is if the quota is raised, it might lead 

 to a dearth of truly-qualified candidates in the colleges. 

 As an inevitable consequence, the high standards of these 

 institutions will fall. It is unjust.

 Many deserving candidates will be denied the seats just because they are not SC/ST. That would be rather absurd. People should get admission into esteemed educational institutes solely on the basis of merit, not on the basis of which ?class? they belong to.

 By giving priority to undeserving candidates, we are only making our country?s future bleaker.

 Mindless revolt

 I don?t think medical students 

 should protest against quotas for the backward classes (OBCs), 

 under the justification that such reservations would dilute 

 the quality of the medical students and graduates.

 Being a science student myself, I think that caste system, an ancient practice, shouldn?t be allowed to encroach the minds of the youth, especially because we are responsible for the nation?s future.

 The caste system is a hurdle in the country?s path of development. It throws the nation back to where it started from. Why alter the meaning of equality? If the OBCs haven?t got the equality they deserve yet, then I think it is time that some initiative is taken for them.

 Why are we forgetting that this nation was shaped by people like Gandhi and Ambedkar, who fought for the OBCs and inspired the preamble of India to start with ?We the people of India?? 

 Had the British still been ruling over India, wouldn?t we all have been labelled as OBCs, including those who now protest reservation?

 The caste system is a myth which can be only broken by today?s youth, who know the difference between mindless revolt and fruitful revolution.

 Target roots

 One would wonder why studious 

 youngsters who till recently kept to their classrooms have 

 suddenly taken to the streets. The reason: to support the 

 value of competence in merit, which would directly determine 

 the quality of services the future professionals will deliver 

 to the society.

 The protests are not unprecedented, on many previous occasions students have voiced their opinions about the same issue. But they were not heeded. Assurances of looking into the matter were given, that was all.

 Many students have been visibly shaken by the condition of those who have dared to voice their protest. They now stand aloof, having lost their faith, totally or partially, in the system and its efficacy in delivering justice.

 The point in question ought to have been the quality of education to those who deserve it by reason of brains and not birth. Today?s generation refuses to be taxed for the mistakes of its predecessors.

 Besides, progress must begin at the roots, targeting the problem and from where it arises. Anything else would simply be dismissing responsibilities. Equality implies giving merit an upper hand by dealing with economic backwardness, by preventing social inequality to those who face it, and not to those whose ancestors faced it centuries ago.

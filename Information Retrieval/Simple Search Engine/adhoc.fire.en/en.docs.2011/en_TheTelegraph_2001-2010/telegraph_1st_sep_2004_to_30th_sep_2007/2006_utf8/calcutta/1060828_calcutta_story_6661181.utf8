 The illusion of life

 Some of the most promising artists of the present generation demonstrate a predilection towards themes and techniques, reflecting their urge to express personal emotions. New Works, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by a group of young painters, is significant in the sense that it showcases works portraying individual experiences and displays unique styles developed by each artist. Motifs and symbols with distinct urban, contemporary overtones, have been used effectively to heighten the impact of expression. Depicting images that deal with an universal, elusive search for the ideal in an imperfect world, the paintings ultimately express the futility of existence. Participating artists are Debabrata Sarkar, Dibyangshu Das Gupta, Pradip Das (a painting by him appears above), Santosh Chattopadhyay, Sudipto Dutta, Tapas Sardar and Satyabrata Karmakar.

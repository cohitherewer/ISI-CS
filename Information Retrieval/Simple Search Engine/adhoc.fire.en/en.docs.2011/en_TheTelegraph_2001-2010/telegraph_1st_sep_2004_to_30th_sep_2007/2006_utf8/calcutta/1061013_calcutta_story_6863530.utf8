 The lure of becoming the chief executive officer of a call centre turned an industrial engineering graduate into a scamster.

 Sushant Chandak was in a hurry to clamber up the corporate ladder. So, when two Channel 4 representatives posing as entrepreneurs interested in setting up an outbound call centre in Calcutta met him in June 2005 and promised him the top slot in exchange of client database, Chandak could see his dream coming true.

 He (Chandak) has told us that he started collating information about British citizens from various sources after he received the proposal, said Rajeev Kumar, deputy inspector general (operations), CID.

 A sting operation by Britains Channel 4 exposed Chandaks involvement in a data theft scandal, sounding alarm bells across the fledgling business process outsourcing (BPO) industry in the country. The 29-year-old had offered to sell a database with credit card details of 20,000 people.

 Chandak, arrested on Wednesday, was produced at the Barrackpore Court on Thursday and remanded in police custody till October 18. During interrogation, Chandak revealed that he used a pen-drive a portable data storage-transfer device to steal data from servers.

 Chandak, an engineering graduate from Nagpur, had worked in a Delhi call centre before shifting to Calcutta in 2003. He has been out of a job since July 2006.

 Chandak confessed that he could steal data, as he was in-charge of database management at the city-based call centre. Besides, he used call centre agents to smuggle out credit card, passport and driving license details of clients. Chandak had stored all this data on his computers hard disk.

 We found the hard disk missing when we raided his Nagerbazar home last week, said a CID officer, adding how Chandak had tried his best to impress the British journalists, or investors.

 A woman came down in July 2005 to finalise the deal with Chandak. He produced the data set along with recorded conversation of call centre agents and clients in the UK. He assured her that his contacts would fish out more data, said Kumar.

 But it soon went all wrong, ending the engineers dream of becoming a CEO.

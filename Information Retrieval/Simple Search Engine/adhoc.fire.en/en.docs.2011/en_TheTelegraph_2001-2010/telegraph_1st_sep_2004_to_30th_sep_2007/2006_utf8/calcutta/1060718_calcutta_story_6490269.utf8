The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Siwan MP?s aide held in forgery raid

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Mohammad Aslam Rustam Khan, wanted across India, has landed in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) net during a raid to bust a fake documents racket.

 CID officers believe Khan was instrumental in spreading the fake documents racket to Punjab, Tamil Nadu and the Northeast.

 Khan is said to be a close associate of Md Shahabuddin, the controversial MP from Bihar?s Siwan district. He is wanted in at least five murder and extortion cases and was allegedly involved in the killing of Jawaharlal Nehru University student leader Chandrasekhar in 1997.

 Khan was held in Prasad Nagar, Kamarhati, on Saturday. He was injured when he tried to flee the three-storeyed rented house. His identity was revealed during interrogation.

 ?Khan was a key member of Shahabuddin?s core group and several cases of murder and extortion have been lodged against him. As far as I can recall, Khan had escaped from a hospital where he had been admitted with Shahabuddin a few years back,? police superintendent of Siwan Sunil Kumar told Metro.

 Investigations revealed that Khan had made the Prasad Nagar house his base. He was scheduled to fly to Delhi on July 17. Ashraff Ali Khan, who had helped him rent the house, was also arrested.

 ?Khan had made arrangements to slip out in case of a raid. The iron grille of the gate was broken and a rope was hung from the balcony of the house. He could not climb down since he was drunk,? said Soumen Mitra, deputy inspector-general, CID.

 Speaker of the Assembly Hashim Abdul Halim on Monday asked MLAs to keep their letterheads and seals secure. The forgers had got hold of the letterhead of a south Calcutta MLA.

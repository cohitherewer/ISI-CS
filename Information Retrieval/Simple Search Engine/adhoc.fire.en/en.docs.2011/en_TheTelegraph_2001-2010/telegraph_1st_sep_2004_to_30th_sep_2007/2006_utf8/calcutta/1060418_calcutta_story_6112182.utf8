 The City Diary

 The CID?s special operation group on Sunday night arrested Syed Osman Ali, wanted in around 30 cases of extortion and murder in Orissa, from a hideout in Thakurpukur. The hunt for Ali, alias Tito, had been on for the past six months, following a communication from Orissa police to the CID. 

 preliminary probe revealed that Ali had bought flats in Howrah worth around Rs 50 lakh and a 50-acre bheri in Paradip. He came to Thakurpukur on Saturday from Maslandapur, North 24-Parganas, where he had been staying for the past few months.

 A team from West Port police station on Monday arrested Mehtab Ali Shaw and Dhiren Patra in Tikiapara, Howrah, in connection with the theft of a truck. Police said the two had sold off parts of vehicle. A hunt is on for another man involved in the theft. 

 Eleven bombs were recovered from a vat on Amherst Street, in central Calcutta, on Monday. A ragpicker noticed the bombs and immediately informed local residents, who called police.

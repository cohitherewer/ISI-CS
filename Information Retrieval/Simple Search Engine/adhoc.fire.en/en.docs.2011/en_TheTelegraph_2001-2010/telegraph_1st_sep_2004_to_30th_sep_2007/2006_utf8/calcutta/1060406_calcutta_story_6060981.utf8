 A critically-acclaimed and award-winning play, Mohit Chattopadhyay?s Chandralokey Agnikanda is being revived by Kathakriti in this production after a span of four decades. Carrying a message that is still relevant to the present socio-political scenario, it presents an apparently absurd, puzzling and bizarre theatrical exercise in phantasy, unconventional imageries, repressed desires and angst, metaphoric supernaturalism and, above all, an all-pervasive conflict between state power and the power of love. Its characters seem familiar on first impression, but, as the play progresses, they reflect a spectrum of portentous motives, often metamorphosing into primitive and archaic stereotypes. Simultaneously depicting the grotesque interplay between realism and super-realism, conscious and unconscious, the play stirs up a swirl of emotions that leave the audience feeling disturbed, threatened and anxious. Nevertheless, its ends on a note of promise and hope. Direction: Sanjib Ray.

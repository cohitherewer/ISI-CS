 What: 

 Tequila Texmex Night.

 Where: Underground at 

 Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: The set-up was vibrant and the mood was happy as everyone got into Mexican mode at the HHI nightclub. The interiors helped cactus and sand as did the free-flowing tequila-based cocktails, shooters and even teas.

 DJ Anshul was true to the theme. Lots of old Western music and some Mexican movie numbers kept the crowd grooving along.

 Voiceover: We wanted to set up a colourful and distinctive ambience for our guests to enjoy, and so we thought of a Tequila Texmex Night, said Arundeep Sachdeva at HHI.

 Music mood

 What: Hip-hop Flava. 

 Where: Venom at Fort Knox, Camac Street.

 When: Friday night. 

 The bash: Hip-hop Flava officially kicked off the monthly Flava series at Venom.

 The series that intends to showcase a new genre of music every month was finalised after a recent pilot event with DJ Ivans House music.

 On Friday, DJ G rocked the party with a whole range of new R amp;B sounds and lots of hip-hop remixes of other popular tracks.

 Channel [V] VJ Tina T upped the glamour quotient as she interacted with the crowd and gave away some prizes, drawing hearty cheers.

 Also spotted: Soccer star Bhaichung Bhutia, VJ Nikhil Chinappa along with other MTV crew members.

 Voiceover: Running a nightclub is not about playing the same beats every night. We are targeting a wider section of the party crowd by bringing specialised sounds to cater to Calcuttas growing taste, said Bunty Sethi, proprietor of Venom.

 Mixed menu

 What: The Three Eyes.

 Where: Phoenix Hall, Saturday Club.

 When: Saturday night.

 Take a look: Loads of fashion and dollops of dramatic dance display over a ladies coffee meet made up the evening.

 The men were not left out either as a fashion show gave glimpses of Puja trends for both men and women.

 Durgavandana by members of Nritya set the mood for the evening. Next up was the fashion show choreographed by Prithviraj Ghosh. A host of colourful creations by city designer labels M amp;N, Manjari, Sammohita, Swati Tex, Vibrashion and Threds punctuated with dance sequences (it could have been the other way round as well), kept the audience glued to their seats.

 City models displayed saris, lehngas, kurtas and mens shirts. Glitter, heavy embroidery, rich fabrics and a riot of hues were the highlights. Saris in splashy reds, striking blues, pearly pinks and sober peach looked gorgeous with intricate work on the borders and pallu. Equally gorgeous were the heavily-embellished lehngas. The kurtis were worked upon with nature as well as abstract illustrations.

 In between you had men showcasing long kurtas. The models strutted the ramp flaunting mens formal, party and casual shirts. Sober pastels and solid blacks with a dash of red looked cool.

 Voiceover: The idea 

 is to let the ladies bond and socialise with each other. 

 A fashion show seemed ideal with the festive season not 

 far away, smiled Renu Roy, convenor of the entertainment 

 committee, Saturday Club.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Satyakam or Mili or... 

Screen On amp; Off

 After we picked our five favourite films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee on Tuesday, some readers wrote back with their choices...

 With reference to your article in the Metro on 29th, I was pleased that your esteemed newspaper found some place for the greatest film-maker of Indian cinema.

 I have seen plenty of Hrishidas films and every time I watch his films I find them more interesting than before. His films dont allow me to move away from my seat.

 I think the greatest film of all the great films created by Hrishida was Satyakam. It may not have been a commercial hit, but can anybody say that he doesnt like Satyakam? And the performances of Dharmendra and Ashok Kumar deserve special applause. 

 I will request Metro to come out with articles on all the 40 films created by Hrishida. Because no one, literally no one, can match him and his films. 

 Sandeep Tulsyan, 

 Howrah

 Your list on Hrishikesh Mukherjees best films is fine but you should have added Mili. It is such a nice film, almost a parallel to Anand. Here it is the girl dying and what a performance by Amitji! Badi suni suni hai without Hrishida... 

 Priyanka Jain, 

 Dhakuria

 I think another classic movie 

 of Hrishida is Namak Haram (1974). Lots of 

 films have been made on friendship but none was as touching. 

 Namak Haram was simple yet powerful. Two superstars 

 Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan set the screen on 

 fire with their powerhouse performances.

 It is a touching tale with no melodrama, true to Hrishidas style with brilliant dialogues of Gulzar and backed as usual with another Hrishida favourite RD Burmans touching music. Diye jalte hain, Main shair badnaam still echo in our memories not only because of the melody but also because of Hrishidas simple way of shooting songs, proving once again that excellent locations are not prerequisites to make a song memorable. 

 Namak Haram cannot be remade, as such a simple, touching yet brilliant tale of conflicting ideologies and friendship can only be made by a simple craftsman called Hrishikesh Mukherjee.

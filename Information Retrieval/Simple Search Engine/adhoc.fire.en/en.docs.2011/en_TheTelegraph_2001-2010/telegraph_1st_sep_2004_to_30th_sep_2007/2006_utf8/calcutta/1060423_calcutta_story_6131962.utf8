 Lucky charm comes calling

 Lucky charm is what the tinsel town loves to label Ameesha Patel. And why not? In her first two releases, she delivered two of the biggest hits in the history of Indian cinema ? Kaho Naa? Pyar Hai and Gadar?Ek Prem Katha. Since then, her films havent quite hit golden eye but Ameeshas never really been too far from a blockbuster. No wonder industrywallahs keep backing her projects and she invariably has her kitty full.

 It has never mattered to me whether my film creates ripples at the box-office or not, said Ameesha, in town on Saturday for a stage show at night, but turning up bright and early at the AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria to tour the new annexe wing.

 Looking slightly thanda in a blue top, she announced: I am only interested in work that excites me and not something that just increases my bank balance. I even dont mind sitting at home without work if I dont get a good role.

 That, of course, is far from the case, with Ameesha slated to be seen in four big films in the coming months. I have been shooting back-to-back for the past few months and it has been really tough, she confessed. And the projects I have in hand will keep me busy for another couple of months.

 The first Ameesha Patel film to release this year would be Ankahee, something the actress finds special for many reasons. The movie is inspired by the real-life marital blues of director Vikram Bhatt, whom Ameesha has been seeing for some time now. Its a power-packed role and it makes most of me as an actor, she announced. I play the wife who is betrayed by the husband (for Sushmita Sen in real life, and Esha Deol on reel). Its about how she stands up to the situation and society.

 Ankahees leading man Aftab Shivdasanis character in the movie is loosely based on Vikrams, but Ameesha did not shy away from dissecting his characteristics. The man in the film is a typical male who is much more weak than my character and is easily drawn to temptation, she explained.

 I have never been told that the film is based on anybodys life but my character is such that every woman can relate to it.She is not the cranky bundle of nerves, she has a sense of dignity and does not have to accept the man back.

 But why has she been missing from the films promos? Its deliberate, I am the surprise package in the film, she almost whispered. The guys in charge know in which direction they finally want the sympathy wave to flow. Everythings so real about the film. Its very raw and I have sported very minimal make-up. Its definitely one of the best movies I have done.

 The no-glam look will continue in her next release, as Ameesha pairs up with Sanjay Dutt for Anubhav Sinhas Tathastu. Its an emotional mothers role and the film shows to what extent she can go to save the life of her child? It was again completely different from what I had done before, but then again I have always taken up challenges. When everyone refused it, I agreed to do Gadar with a much older man. When everyone asked me not to, I played a negative character in Humraaz. When others turned it down, I was ready to play a non-made-up widow in Mangal Pandey.

 Once the serious roles are taken care of, its back to glam-sham for Ameesha. In Dharmesh Darshans Aap Ki Khatir I will be seen in a glamorous role again where I am supposed to look good in great locations, she revealed. I also did my first ever out-and-out comedy in Reema Kagtis Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd. I never knew I had comedy in me, but the way the unit cracked up during the shooting, I was really satisfied.

 Calcutta does hold a special meaning for Ameesha. Oh! I love the food here, fish and rice specially, she sounded all excited. I am also fond of the Bengali culture and the beautiful saris. And even the novels and authors. Full marks for forgetting the rosogollas and mishti doi!

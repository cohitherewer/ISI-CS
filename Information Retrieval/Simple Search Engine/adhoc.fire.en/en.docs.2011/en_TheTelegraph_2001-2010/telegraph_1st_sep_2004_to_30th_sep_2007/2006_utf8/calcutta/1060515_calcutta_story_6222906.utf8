The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Snag trips civic helpline

 ALAPAN BANDYOPADHYAY, municipal commissioner of Calcutta, met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included Anil Bavishi, Sivabrata Chatterjee, Diptimoy Ghosh, Mehboob Kader, Md. Aamiruzzaman, Md. Shamim, Subhadyuti Datta, Sushmita Roy, Divya Mishra, Om Prakash Jaiswal, Neha Agarwal and Talat Shalauddin

Md. Aamiruzzaman: Does the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) helpline work? We never get a response. Why?

 I apologise for the inconvenience. Quite a few process linkages are yet to be established. It will take some time to sort out the problem.

 To make the helpline really helpful, decentralisation of the municipal commissioner?s power is necessary. Officers must have a clear idea about what decision has to be taken at what level. They must know their rights and limitations. The entire process should be over in three to four months.

Anil Bavishi: Since the late 1990s, I have been 

lodging complaints with the CMC and the vigilance department against an illegal 

construction on 81, NS Road. Till date, no one has looked into the complaints. 

The owner of the plot was allowed to carry out the construction on the basis of 

the floor-area ratio of a 23-cottah plot. The area of the land is only 21 cottah. 

Can you take steps regarding this?

 I am instructing the director-general of the CMC building department to personally investigate the the matter and submit a report to me within a week. After getting the report, I will get back to you regarding the matter. I hope to get in touch with you within 10 to 12 days.

Sivabrata Chatterjee: Non-residential structures like warehouses are being build in areas like Justice Dwarkanath Road, where such constructions are not allowed, as per the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1951. Moreover, there is a directive from Calcutta High Court prohibiting non-residential constructions in certain areas. I want you to look into the matter.

 The civic body is now guided by the CMC Act, 1980. Give me a copy of the list of areas in the city where construction of non-residential structures is prohibited. Also, give me a copy of the high court order. Before taking any step I must consult these documents.

Diptimoy Ghosh: It is time you got rid of hawkers in the city. Please give the pavements back to the pedestrians.

 The matter is now pending in the apex court. A national commission has submitted its report on hawkers before the Supreme Court. We too have sent our men to Delhi. We are now waiting for the court?s directive in this regard.

Om Prakash Jaiswal: Illegal activities have been going on in stall F1 in College Street market. The owner has sublet the stall, extended it without permission and kept rubber goods in it without obtaining a fire licence. I have written to the CMC requesting the authorities not to allow mutation of the stall. No probe has been initiated into the matter.

 I think you have some sort of personal interest in that stall. Mutation is a quasi-judicial process and permission for it is granted only after verification of the documents. Without hearing the version of the other side, it is not fair to answer your question. You can, however, give me documents supporting your claim, along with a copy of your earlier complaint.

Mehboob Kader: An illegal construction has come up on the roof of the Lalbazar police headquarters. Have you sent a notice to the Calcutta Police authorities?

 I am awaiting the final report in this regard. But I would like to make it clear that the CMC and Calcutta Police are complementary bodies and we don?t want a confrontation. Many government buildings have come up in the city without taking permission from the CMC. The insistence on plans being cleared by the civic body is a recent development. The Calcutta Improvement Trust recently coughed up Rs 1.5 crore as building plan sanction fees to the CMC. The CMDA too has started approaching us for approval. 

Diptimoy Ghosh: Vats in the city are not cleared daily. It is an ordeal to pass by a vat overflowing with trash. This poses health problems too. Why can?t you clear the vats regularly?

 Calcutta is one of the few cities in the country where garbage is cleared daily. It is one of the best managed cities internationally in respect of garbage collection. Still you can see some vats spilling over with garbage because trash is deposited round-the-clock.

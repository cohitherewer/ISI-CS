 What: Announcement of special sweepstake 

 prize of Black Dog Scotch Whisky.

 Where: Mahalakshmi Racecourse, Mumbai.

 When: Friday, 8 pm.

 The bash: In true Mumbai party style, the proceedings 

 kicked off almost an hour late. But thankfully, host Vijay 

 Mallya was there right from the outset. Dressed in a black 

 suit with a pink tie and sporting shoulder-length salt-and-pepper 

 locks, the spotlight never shifted from the king of good 

 life who (as he himself announced) runs two of the 

 countrys most highly regulated businesses alcohol 

 and airline.

 But then, where else could the 

 spotlight have been, given the low make that no celebrity 

 turnout at the party? Yes, you read it right! There were 

 hardly any party people, forget about a sprinkling of tinsel 

 stars.

 Winter in Mumbai is incomplete 

 without the derby and what better way to start the season 

 but with a run-up to the forthcoming elections? Mallya, 

 who is battling Cyrus S. Poonawalla for the chairmans 

 throne at Royal Western India Turf Club, made the evening 

 an occasion to remember for members.

 There was a red carpet leading 

 to the grounds from the main entrance. The balmy Mumbai 

 air was filled with lights at the open-air venue. And there 

 was no dearth of firecrackers as the programme got underway. 

 Yet, something was missing. As the evening progressed, the 

 missing element star power and celebspotting became 

 increasingly conspicuous.

 First, there was a short ceremony 

 to award the winner of the special sweepstake prize of the 

 contest by Black Dog Scotch Whisky. The prize? A sleek custom-designed 

 car by Dilip Chhabria. Amid loud crackers and colourful 

 sparklers, Mallya chose the winner from a lucky dip and 

 handed over the car keys to software professional Karthik 

 Vembar from Bangalore. The other finalists didnt go 

 back empty-handed; there were special cases of Black Dog 

 Scotch Whisky for them.

 The emcee for the evening, 

 Divya Palat, then passed on the baton to pop singer Anaida, 

 who failed to keep the crowd of turf club members interested. 

 Starting off with her own compositions, Anaida then proceeded 

 to Bollywood numbers. The crowd joined in half-heartedly 

 to tracks like Dhoom macha le, Kajra re and 

 Wheres the party tonight.

 In what could have easily been 

 an appeal for a parliamentary seat, Mallya then took over 

 to convince his guests of his transparent track 

 record, made promises to kick off night racing and build 

 a clubhouse, held forth on his concept of a futuristic 

 India and assured all assembled that he would take 

 time out of his busy schedule for the organisation.

 Fashion fundas: No, there was no flamboyant flaunting 

 of dazzling designer wear. No ramp rockers, no svelte sultry 

 sirens. Yet, plenty was on offer at the evening gathering 

 blacks, blacks and more blacks; dresses, dresses and more 

 dresses. Okay, there was the occasional auntyji in 

 a garish georgette but the ebonies and the emeralds easily 

 drowned that.

 Sip bite: There was no letting up on this 

 front. Free-flowing drinks went around with bite-sized snacks 

 all through the evening. The highlight, however, was the 

 lavish buffet spread including Indian and Continental dishes. 

 A special mention for the malai shots!

 Last word: Though its not yet winter on the Mumbai 

 map, Mallyas party was cold and colourless or should 

 we say highly regulated most unlike the good 

 times one expects at his bash.

Life

 Just to be bedazzled

 LIFESTYLE ZONE

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 Stylish ? right from the decor to the pieces of jewels to even the paper bag that holds the buy ? is the effect thats bound to strike anyone who spends even a few moments at Vasundhara, a designer jewellery studio that opened its doors to Calcuttans a couple of years ago.

 On the quiet third floor of The Enclave at 17/1F Alipore Road, this boutique catches your eye immediately, not just because of the bedazzling beauties it houses, but also for its ambience.

 I wanted my studio to reflect outstanding creativity in every sphere, smiles Vasundhara Mantri, the name behind the label.

 Ambience

 This 350 sq ft studio exudes a mixed aura of modernity fused with the classical. The flooring is firewood and wood while the essential elements used in the overall decor are steel and wood. Geometrical is how one would describe the studio look.

 The extensive use of glass reflects light, lending a special sheen to the stone jewels. All my cabinets are steel too, since it goes well with my jewellery, says Vasundhara. 

 Two main counters, placed in the centre of the store, house most of the pieces from the new collection. With the basic body of these counters being in steel, the gleaming zircons embedded within attract immediate attention.

 The lighting in this lifestyle zone is also quite effective. A huge back-lit span of glass makes up one entire wall of the studio and numerous spotlights that focus on the designs are seen scattered all over the walls and stands. 

 Jewellery 

 A dazzling collection of earrings, pendants, rings, bracelets and watches in semi-precious stones makes up the range. And the earrings that comprise a hefty 70 per cent of the display deserve special mention. 

 Available in three distinct categories, all the earrings are set on a zircon base. I have a separate range of earrings for everyday use, explains Vasundhara.

 Smaller in size and mostly in neutral colours, these are priced between Rs 800 and 1,500.

 The second category of earrings looks almost real and is set in pearls and polkis. My third range comprises funky pieces where I have used two different-coloured stones or settings for a single pair. The most common stones seen are rose quartz, turquoise, lapis lazuli and amethyst.

 Vasundhara experiments with lots of textured metals too. Fancy cocktail rings in mother-of-pearl and quartz that cover the whole length of a finger, are priced between Rs 2,500 and 3,000.

 Funky pendants that are larger than life employ unusual stones and settings. I use a range of turquoise and rose quartz that I pick up in rare shapes and sizes, reveals the designer.

 Chunky and oversized bracelets are available in a wooden range as well as with regular stones. They are tagged between Rs 2,000 and Rs 8,000. 

 Add-on

 Giving company to the dazzling jewellery is a host of other accessories. Jewelled bags and sandals that complement the main product line are also available at Vasundhara. Fancy potlis, cool clutches and peppy printed canvas bags are all on display.

 The difference is noticeable in that added touch with shining stones and glitter. Dressy footwear and sandals that are encrusted with stones are available in common sizes. Special sizes can also be arranged on request, assures Vasundhara. 

 Prices vary between Rs 800 and Rs 2,500. Each of the purchases comes in a neat wooden box put inside a cutwork white paper bag.

 The final detail ? a red sheet of paper slipped into the packet ? makes for a great finishing touch.

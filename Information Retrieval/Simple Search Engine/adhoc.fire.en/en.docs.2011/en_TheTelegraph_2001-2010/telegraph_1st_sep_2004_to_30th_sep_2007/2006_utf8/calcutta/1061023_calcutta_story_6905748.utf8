The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Great divide as unquiet flows the Don

 Pratim D. Gupta, representing GenX, sat through Don 1978 and Don 2006, and was floored by the Farhan film. But he also kept an ear open for GenEx grouse and grumble while watching the remix... 

 don (1978)

 GenX: Sorry, 

 but Chandra Barots Don was no classic, even by lenient 

 Bollywood standards. It was a one-line idea Javed Akhtars 

 words: tala bandh, chabi phenk di developed into a three-hour 

 movie.

 Coincidences galore with characters suddenly bumping into each other at crossroads, it was a 180-page screenplay of convenience. How could the Bihari Vijay talk and walk like Don overnight? Why wouldnt DCP DSilva, so proud of his honest squad, tell the others in his team about the Vijay-Don swap and yet disclose it to a rank outsider like Roma?

 Then you have a ham-ham-thank-you-mam Pran with a misfit of a golden wig and too much mascara. Check out the scene where Jasjit turns down Narangs offer by saying Koi chance nahin And the less said about the catch-the-red-diary-contest climax, the better.

 But then, Don had Amitabh Bachchan, who not only had Zanjeer, Sholay and Deewar under his belt, but had Trishul, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar and Kasme Vaade released in the same year. It also had some amazing music by Kalyanji Anandji. Not just Khaike paan Banaraswala, Yeh mera dil and Main hoon Don, but the background score can have Salim-Sulaiman sweating even today.

 And most importantly, it had some of the best one-liners in Bollyspeak. From mujhe uske jootein pasand nahin to Aunty apni uncle-on ko saath layee hain to Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin namumkin hai, when AB the Don spoke, you listened. Period.

 If you rewind, the old Don was the first half hour till Don is dead plus Khaike paan Banaraswala.

 GenEx: Yes, it 

 was a plot that called for a lot of willing suspension of 

 disbelief, and it had all the liabilities of its time (from 

 Pran to technology). Yet, it was an Amitabh movie that gave 

 ample screen time to the man we all flocked to see and threw 

 in more twists and turns than films in those days saw. For 

 us, it remains a good film to go back to and watch in parts 

 (every part with Amitabh, that is).

 do you know

 Amitabh Bachchan took Rs 2.5 lakh for the role of Don while Pran, a bigger star during the making, took Rs 5 lakh. Zeenat Aman didnt take anything because of the producer-camerman Nariman Iranis sudden demise.

 The Khaike song was choreographed 

 in the original by PL Raj, the mentor of Saroj Khan who 

 has choreographed the same song in the new Don.

 Director Chandra Barot 

 got the idea of making Amitabh eat 40 paans before Khaike 

 shoot from Anandji (of Kalyanji-Anandji) who was a paan 

 addict.

 The role of Iftekhar was 

 first offered to Rajendra Kumar but he wanted his character 

 of DCP DSilva to be garlanded at the end of the film by 

 Bachchans Vijay, which the makers did not agree to.

 Farhan Akthars Don is 

 not the first remake of Don. It was first done by Kawal 

 Sharma in his film Dav Pech in 1989 starring Jeetendra as 

 the main character. It flopped in a big way.

 The idea of remaking Don 

 was conceived when Farhan was listening to a remixed Don 

 song while travelling in a train from Delhi to Dehradun. 

 Farhan began writing the 

 script with Hrithik Roshan in mind for the role of Don.

 Shah Rukh, Priyanka and 

 Arjun Rampal took extensive martial arts training under 

 the guidance of experts from Shaolin Temple.

 SRK actually jumped from 

 a height of 15,000 feet for a scene. It was done under the 

 guidance of Hollywood stunt expert Joe Jennings who was 

 involved with Charlies Angels, XXX and Air Force One.

 don (2006)

 GenX : Farhan 

 the fan fights Farhan the film-maker and the film wins. 

 The 32-year-old director has turned a formula film of good 

 defeats bad into a modern-day neo-noir movie where bad fights 

 bad. And thats good news because the sinister Don was so 

 much more attractive than the paan-chewing Vijay.

 The new Don is more of a remix than remake with the scratchy edges smoothened out with grunge grooves and blistering beats. Farhan changes the backdrop and the background and yet manages to keep the original sequences and lines. And it sure needs a gifted writer to execute what his dil chahta hai.

 First, the wish fulfilments. 1. The invincible Don doesnt die within 30 minutes. 2. The villain is not an innocuous balding bum. 3. There is no forced love story in the middle of a dark thriller.

 Now, the add-ons. 1. Don meets his nemesis in DCP DSilva all right, but he is not playing by the law. 2. Roma doesnt learn to fight overnight to take revenge of her brothers death at the hands of Don, but is a natural who doesnt shy away from displaying her dashing skills. 3. And the mother of all twist moments before the end credits makes Don in Farhans own words an individual entity.

 Farhan also scores where he is expected to eye-catching locations, cinematography and production design. Don looks sumptuous. Add to that the breathtaking chase and action sequences and Farhan again breaks new grounds on the Indian big screen, just like he did with the war in Lakshya. In the new Don, you never know whats about to happen next. And thats the way we like it, aha!

 GenEx: Come on, 

 give us a break. We know we may be passe, but we still have 

 a voice (or so we hope!). Replacing a diary with a disc 

 does not a modern remake make. The new Don is all style 

 and little substance, redeemed only by the final twist in 

 the tale and Boman Irani. A full 150 minutes of video-game-like 

 moments from Barot and Bond, Con Air and cartoon is painful 

 to sit through. Worse, its boring. If you survive the ordeal, 

 a surprise awaits you at the end that spells part paisa 

 vasool (the ticket is Rs 200, remember?).

 khaike (1978)

 GenX: Thank god 

 Barot added this song after Manoj Kumar couldnt go for 

 a loo break in the action-packed second half during a test 

 screening of Don. After a dismal first week, it was Khaike 

 which changed the fortunes of the film. And why not? Along 

 with Rang barse, Mere angne mein and Pag ghungroo, this 

 was easily one of Bachchans best item songs. With his 

 towering presence and trademark moves, he made Khaike into 

 one helluva rollercoaster ride, while Zeenat smiled coyly. 

 Kishoreda behind the microphone did the rest.

 GenEx: Fun song, 

 but overrated.

 khaike (2006)

 GenX: Shah Rukh 

 Khan hasnt danced like this in a long, long time. Sure 

 he knew what he was in for. What he misses in stature, SRK 

 makes up with energy. Look at him move and shake like a 

 man possessed. Saroj Khans steps are just what the Don 

 ordered very, very filmi and just what Shah Rukh needed 

 to add his three-bit to it. Udit Narayan does a decent job 

 and the music is mast. Yes, surprise, surprise, the new 

 Khaike is as good as the old one!

 GenEx: Full marks 

 to Farhan and Shah Rukh for pulling off the Khaike act. 

 It sure pumps up the volume and gets the foot tapping to 

 the SRK-Priyanka antics.

 zeenat aman

 GenX: Roma was 

 unlike anything that Bollywood actresses needed to play 

 during those days. And thats why Zeenat Aman fitted the 

 role to the tee. The eternal rebel, Zeenie Baby flitted 

 from cold to cool to warm to hot at will. Not only did she 

 quite look the avenger angel, but she slipped into Vijays 

 arms as convincingly. The only problem: her squeaky voice.

 GenEx: Zeenat 

 made a classy, cool Roma of her time.

 priyanka chopra

 GenX: If theres 

 one thing flawless about the new Don, then it has to be 

 Piggychops. After the disappointing Krrish, Priyanka is 

 in prime form here. The cold stare, the measured smile and 

 the killer kick... man, she rocks! If you cant imagine 

 anyone playing Don apart from SRK, it is impossible to visualise 

 anyone else as Roma. The magic lies in how Priyanka never 

 loses her feminine touch even as she breathes fire. And 

 you have to go back to catch her coming out of the waters 

 one more time in that wet swimsuit. Go, junglee billi (thats 

 what Don calls her), go! 

 GenEx: Priyanka 

 is a SAD act. No comparisons here, this junglee billi is 

 just not up to scratch.

 yeh mera dil (1978)

 GenX: Helens 

 hips and Bachchans glare... Yeh mera dil was like a ball 

 of fire seducing a slab of ice. And how! Helen was eight 

 years older than Bachchan when she danced around him in 

 Mehboob Studios on the first day of Don shooting in 1974. 

 Every time you watch this act, you are mesmerised by Helens swivelling hips, her legs flashing from that slit skirt, that crawl across the carpet, and Amitabhs silent intensity in slowburn. 

 We talk of Rakhi Sawant and Mumait Khan as item girls today. When you think Helen in Don and Sholay, well, you just take a deep breath.

 GenEx: Ditto 

 to that!

 yeh mera dil (2006)

 GenX: Farhan 

 feels just like Helen, with Kareena, no matter how little 

 clothes she wears she doesnt look vulgar. He is right on 

 that count. But where Bebo misses a beat or two are the 

 steps. She is not as gifted a dancer as Helen. While its 

 spellbinding to watch her seduce Shah Rukh, her hips do 

 lie. The new Yeh mera dil cannot carve out its own identity 

 and depends too much on the Helen factor to work. SRKs 

 Don does give it his own twist by giving in to Kamini/Sonias 

 moves, till the Uncles spoil the steamy party!

 GenEx: Bebos 

 bodyline moves are fine, but where is the sex appeal, pray? 

 Forget seducing Don, her turn-on is a con.

 amitabh bachchan

 GenX: When you 

 draw up a Favourite Five list of Amitabh Bachchans movies, 

 you seldom keep Don out. It is because the film revolved 

 around him from the first frame in the rear-view mirror 

 of the car to the last frozen frame. No Shashi Kapoor, Dharmendra 

 or Mithun Chakraborty to snatch screen space or time from 

 the Big B here.

 No actor in Bollywood history has used his height and voice quite like Bachchan. And in Don, he thrives on both. 

 Whether its that famous scamper across dhobi ghat or the Khaike song, his stature makes all the difference. Look at the camera angles in the Main hoon Don song and you know Mumbai ka king kaun... 

 And the dialogue delivery... Phew! We all remember and recite Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin namumkin hai, but dont miss him tell Helen: Mujhe do tarah ke ladki pasand nahin. Ek jo mere paas aane mein der lagaye aur doosri woh jo mere paas jaldi aa jaye. Mindblowing!

 And when he became Vijay, Bachchan went back to the fumbling-bumbling routine he was an absolute pro at. Dont miss his trademark aayein between two sentences when the ganwar Vijay converses with DCP DSilva.

 Don is Bachchan and for 28 years it was impossible to imagine someone in his shoes. And despite Shah Rukh trying his best, the Big B still remains the Don.

 GenEx: The generation 

 gap is bridged by the Big B. Amitabh was, is, will be, Don.

 shah rukh khan

 GenX: A few minutes 

 into the new Don, you see Shah Rukh sitting in his foamed 

 bathtub and watching Tom amp; Jerry, having bumped off 

 a few dushman in Paris and Malaysia some moments back.

 Anybody else trying to do this would have been blasphemy given what the word Don spells for Bollywood fans. But King Khan manages to pull it off. 

 With a blend of inspiration and innovation, Shah Rukh delivers as Don. The way he throws legendary lines like Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai is homage and history in a single snap.

 Yes, SRK struggles in stature and voice but makes up for it with his sinister demeanour and cool quotient (wardrobe, watch, shades, cellphone). He looks foolish but forced as the ganwar Vijay but thankfully its a blink-and-you-miss role before its the dark Don again.

 And the energy is infectious. The way he moves around and snaps back, almost like a rattle snake, is frightening at times and that air of scare helps the thriller move along at a feverish pace.

 SRK always wanted to play James Bond and here he is doing the shaking and stirring. He may not be on the right side of the law but then unlike most superstars on the Indian screen, he was born on the dark side in Baazigar and Darr.

 GenEx: Would 

 Don 78 have worked without Iftekhar and Pran? Of course. 

 Can Don 06 work without Boman Irani and Arjun Rampal? Of 

 course not. That should say it all. If Don then was an Amitabh 

 Bachchan film, Don now is a Farhan+SRK +Boman+Arjun+techno+... 

 film.

 Stamp of slavery as girls go missing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 There are villages without girls in Bengal and every village is a source area for trafficking, feel activists.

 Pragati, the ladies? wing of Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, organised a meeting on Wednesday to address trafficking of women and children, a phenomenon that is spinning out of control all over the world, not to mention south Asia.

 Ruchira Gupta, who won an Emmy for her documentary on trafficking of children from Nepal called The Selling of Innocents, said: ?The number has grown in the past 10 years to 3 million women and children being trafficked worldwide every year now, according to UN.?

 Gupta heads an NGO called Apne Aap that works with women and children who have been trafficked or are vulnerable to it.

 ?There are other disturbing trends. The age of the girls trafficked is going down, and it has also become far more organised, with far-reaching consequences,? she warned.

 The racket runs on black money and the brothels have become money-laundering centres being used by illegal immigrants.

 One reason for the spurt in the trafficking is migration. Bengal is a major destination for women from Bangladesh.

 ?There are villages in Murshidabad where there are no women or girls. The people there don?t have any answers about the missing girls,? said Gupta. ?It?s the same in the villages along the Northeast corridor near Siliguri.?

 Sometimes the source area, transit point and destination overlap. Because of the women being absent, the social life and the economy of the villages have changed.

 ?Men are becoming more prone to organised crime, to alcohol and drugs,? observed Gupta. ?Sometimes more HIV-prone, too, because the women come back disease-ridden and re-establish relationships.?

 Because of the huge number of women involved and the reach of the phenomenon, Gupta compared trafficking to what slavery was till the 19th Century. The girls are in as much bondage and lead as wretched lives.

 According to latest estimates, 1.5 lakh girls are trafficked from India, Bangladesh and Nepal every year.

 ?About 72 per cent of the trafficking is for commercial sex, 82 per cent happens during migration of labour and 12 per cent for family tradition,? explained Gupta.

 Some 63 per cent of the women and girls trafficked are from the Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

 Global spirit

 City designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh is all set to make another global mark this year as she takes her summer collection 2006 to the Swiss Alps.

 The preview at Lausanne, Switzerland, is part of a four-city campaign, the others being Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi. 

 Kiran rsquo;s latest collection is inspired by The Vagina Monologues and is marked for women with individuality and intellect.

 ldquo;For some, The Vagina Monologues is a play, but at another level, I feel that it is an entire movement for women, not just about their emancipation but also about their individualism, rdquo; she says.

 Kiran also feels that what a woman wears is nothing but a form of expression mdash; an expression of her individualism, evolution, voice and, hence, her monologue.

 ldquo;It is a fact that fashion constructs identity and my collection attempts to do just that. It also goes a step further and constructs diverse identities, injecting disruptions in dress forms. I believe that one should be vicariously individual, explore assimilation through collision because there are many a me in an I, rdquo; stresses the designer. 

 Kiran rsquo;s collection moves towards simpler cleaner lines, elegance and femininity. 

 ldquo;It rsquo;s all about Art Nouveau and Arabesque prints, rdquo; she explains. 

 There rsquo;s an interplay of many fabrics, with jacquard, twill, georgette, chiffon, lace, crochet and a variety of knits being used. The collection boasts Boleros and exquisitely printed T-shirts to be teamed with pleated saris and other garments.

 The colour story is a dreamy palette of pistachio, oyster, pink, lavender, coral, powder blue, brown and ldquo;white, white and more white rdquo;.

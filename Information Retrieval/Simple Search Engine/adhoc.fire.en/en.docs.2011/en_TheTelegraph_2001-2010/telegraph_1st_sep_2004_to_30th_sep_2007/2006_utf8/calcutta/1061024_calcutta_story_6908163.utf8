 Assaulted couple in hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jiban Ratan Sarkar, 55, and his wife Sandhya, 42, are undergoing treatment at Howrah District Hospital for the past 10 days after they were beaten up by goons allegedly backed by the CPM. 

 On October 12, a gang of local youths beat up the Sarkars when they protested its move to clear a drain that went through their land. Badly injured, the couple, residents of Balitikuris Khaldhar, was admitted to hospital the same day. The goons also ransacked their house. 

 A complaint was lodged with Dasnagar police station against the assailants but no one has been arrested.

 The goons are roaming free in the area, said Abhijit, son of Jiban Ratan. 

 Abhijit, an employee of the West Bengal Fire Services department and is posted at Raghunathpur division, Purulia, rushed to the hospital on October 15 after receiving the news.

 But he could not visit his home for fear of being assaulted. For the past 10 days, he has been staying at his friends house in Salkia. 

 The criminals are constantly threatening him over the phone, he alleged. 

 Abhijit said: They keep threatening me and asking me to stay away from my home. The hospital will release my parents on Wednesday, but I cannot take them back to the house as the goons can attack us again. And in such a situation, nobody can save us.

 Debashis Roy, inspector at Dasnagar police station, however, said: The family can return home without fear. We shall give them protection. He did not have an answer when asked why the goons have not been arrested even after 10 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trader cry of extortion by cops ratified

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An eyewitness account corroborates a trader?s allegation that an officer of Burrabazar police station had misbehaved with him and demanded a bribe to help him out in a property dispute.

 Sanjay Sau, a businessman, met assistant commissioner of police (I), south division, Dulal Chakraborty on Monday and gave a ?blow-by-blow account? of how trader Ram Sagar Sahni suffered at the hands of sub-inspector Sukhendu Chel.

 On May 22, Metro had carried a report on Sahni?s complaint, lodged with then deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Kumar, against the sub-inspector. Kumar had ordered an inquiry and Chel was transferred from Burrabazar to Taltala police station.

 Sahni used to run a fruit juice shop on Canning Street, from which he had been allegedly evicted in April. ?Seeking justice, I went to Burrabazar police station. But there, I encountered three extortionists in uniform. It was a nightmarish experience,? Sahni said.

 Sahni had reportedly visited the police station several times, but no officer paid heed to his complaint.

 ?One day, an officer demanded Rs 15,000 to hear me out. I broke down and fell at his feet. But he did not listen to me. The officer even told me that I would get back my shop if I paid up Rs 40,000. I told him it was impossible for me to pay such a huge amount, as I was penniless. To this, his response was: ?Go to hell?,? Sahni had written in his two-page complaint.

 ?When I told the sub-inspector that I would lodge a complaint with superior officers, he said it would not make any difference.?

 Sau, who was present at the police station during the conversation, echoed Sahni during the deposition before assistant commissioner Chakraborty.

 Chakraborty told Metro: ?Yes, Sau came and gave his statement. As for action against Chel, that is our internal matter and cannot be discussed with outsiders.?

 He, however, ruled out any chance of police playing an active role in returning the shop to Sahni. ?We can?t do this. We have asked Sahni to move court. If he gets a favourable order, we will provide him all help,? the assistant commissioner said.

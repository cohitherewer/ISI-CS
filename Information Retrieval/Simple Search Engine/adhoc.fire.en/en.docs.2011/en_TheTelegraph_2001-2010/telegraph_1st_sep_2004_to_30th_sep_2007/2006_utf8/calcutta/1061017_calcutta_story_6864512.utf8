 Adieu to Durga, upstream

 - Whats on your mind this week

 Monks offer prayers to the goddess before 

 the immersion at Dashashwamedh Ghat in Varanasi

Durga puja immersions in Calcutta 

 are always eventful affairs. But the visarjan rituals are 

 no less fascinating in some other places in the country. 

 This Puja, I got to witness the immersion at Dashashwamedh 

 Ghat in Varanasi.

 In the twilight hours on Dashami, 

 the crowd at the ghat was one of the biggest I have ever 

 seen at an immersion. Besides hundreds of devotees, tourists 

 from various parts of the country and even from abroad had 

 turned up to catch a last glimpse of the goddess on her 

 journey back from her fathers home to her husband 

 Shivas abode in Kailash.

 The ceremony began with monks 

 from Bharat Sevashram singing hymns in praise of the deity. 

 Then, representatives of various institutions addressed 

 the crowd explaining the importance of Durga puja at Varanasi.

 What followed was a sight to behold. 

 In a symbolic bid to keep her safe on her journey, the monks 

 formed a protective ring, circling the idol and participating 

 in mock fights with swords, sticks and spears.

 The arati, too, had a twist to 

 it compared to the usual one in Calcutta. There were two 

 aratis. The first, with a lamp, a fan, incense sticks, dhunuchi 

 and other novel items, was performed for the deity. The 

 second arati was for the deity and the Ganges together. 

 Although this Ganga arati is done everyday, its special 

 on the immersion day. The proceedings were a treat for the 

 senses the drum beats, the chanting of the hymns, 

 the lamps and the serene river in the background.

 The sight overwhelmed foreign 

 tourists. Xinamei from China said: It is awesome to 

 see a goddess get such a startling farewell from the people 

 of India. Barbara from Germany gushed: This 

 is unique, totally different from anything we have ever 

 seen. It presents the culture of this country. Sandra 

 from Spain said she was elated to be a part of this 

 beautiful event.

 Andrew from Australia seemed to 

 be a better observer than the rest as he said: It 

 is impressive. Although India is a polytheistic land it 

 is amazing that people from all communities share such festivities 

 together. Maybe it is because of this unity that though 

 I am from Calcutta, I felt connected. Perhaps the others 

 from different parts of the country present there felt the 

 same way.

 Crop vs car

 Industrialisation is essential for development. But 

 if it has to come at the cost of people losing their means 

 of livelihood, then its undesirable. There are widespread 

 protests against the proposed car-manufacturing unit in 

 Singur, which is one of the most fertile areas of West Bengal.

 Although the residents are being promised jobs, its only natural that they are reluctant to part with their land. 

 Is there a dearth of barren land in the state? No one is against setting up of an industry in the state, but agriculture is equally important. Land fit for growing crops must be saved at any cost.

 Gandhigiri in deed

 September 11 was the fifth anniversary 

 of the 9/11 attacks. On the same day, we celebrated the 

 centenary of the Satyagraha movement. 

 Although Gandhi smiles his way into our lives every time we hold a Rs 10 note, yet we dont hesitate to give or take bribe. Gandhigiri is indeed the need of the hour and we must sustain it.

 Congrats cops

 Calcutta Police showed unprecedented 

 success in traffic and crowd control during the Pujas. The 

 work they did round-the-clock is worth appreciation. Most 

 major thoroughfares were free of traffic jams as pandal-hoppers 

 were made to stick to the footpaths. Cars were not allowed 

 into no-entry zones. The disciplined puja crowd also deserves 

 praise; it followed the entry and exit paths at the pandals 

 perfectly.

 But the capabilities of the cops raise a very important question too. When they efficiently managed thousands of people and vehicles during the tumultuous puja days, then why do they fail to do the same on the other days of the year? Calcuttans would love it if this question is answered by the cops in action, than in words.

 Literary affair

 The Bengali Literary Society celebrated its 75th year at 

 the St Xaviers College auditorium in September in 

 collaboration with the colleges alumni association.

 On the occasion, secretary of BLS Platinum Jubilee 2006 

 Snehasis Sur brought out a 421-page publication of contributions 

 to Bengali literature by former Xaverians. Litterateur Buddhadev 

 Guha released the book. This was followed by a debate on 

 Shobar Mote, Bangali tar Bangaliyana Harachhe 

 (In the opinion of the house, the Bengali is losing his 

 Bengaliness), judged by Pabitra Sarkar, former chancellor 

 of Rabindra Bharati University. On Day Two, former Xaverians 

 like Srikanta Acharya, Dipak Rudra and Kharaj Mukherjee, 

 and Krosswindz performed. The college choir sang evergreen 

 Tagore songs. The event upheld the rich heritage and culture 

 of the Xaverian fraternity at large.

 Peep into past

 Our recent history project was on Early Man and his 

 Surroundings. Our teacher divided us in groups of 

 two and gave us the rules and sub-topics of the project. 

 We were told to make a chart or a model, or enact a play 

 to describe the life of the early man. Some of us collected 

 information from the library, while others surfed the Net, 

 some drew pictures and others enacted scenes from the life 

 of the early man. It was during this project that we realised 

 the value of the comforts of modern life.

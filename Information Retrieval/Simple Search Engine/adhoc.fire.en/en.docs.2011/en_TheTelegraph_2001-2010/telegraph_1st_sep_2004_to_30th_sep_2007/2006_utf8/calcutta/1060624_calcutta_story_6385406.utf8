 Plans are afoot to modernise National Library, to help readers choose their desired books by the click of a mouse.

 At present, a reader has a long wait for a book to be located and issued to him. To ease this problem, the library has chalked out a number of programmes. In the times ahead, a reader can access rare and old books in a few minutes. 

 ?We have received funds from the Centre for this project. It has assured us of more funds, as per our requirement,? said Sudhendu Mondal, director of the library.

 The work will be carried out in phases, involving retro conversion, digitisation and CD conversion and cataloguing. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 6.5 crore this fiscal. 

 In the first phase, the authorities plan to prepare machine-readable catalogues, so that a reader can search a book of his/her choice. 

 The catalogue will be available to readers all over the world. This type of catalogue was first introduced by the Library of Congress in Washington DC. ?It will be available in different languages and we will take three to five years to ready it,? Mondal added. 

 After this, the books will be digitised for swift location and the readers can get CDs issued and go through the books. Printouts of the books will be available at a reasonable price.

 ?We have started with books published before 1900. Already, we have digitised three million pages. We have nearly three million books, magazines, journals, maps and Indian and foreign documents. We plan to digitise them all in three years,? he added. 

 In the final phase, the total system will be computerised to overcome the entire cumbrous process of selecting a book. ?Computerisation and modernisation is of utmost importance for a library like ours, with a 300-plus footfall every day,? Mondal explained.

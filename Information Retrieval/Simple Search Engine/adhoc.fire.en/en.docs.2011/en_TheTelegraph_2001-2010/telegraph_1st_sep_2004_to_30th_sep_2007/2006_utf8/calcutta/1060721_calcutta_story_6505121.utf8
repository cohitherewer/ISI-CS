The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Grab cop lost and found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swapan Singha, constable of the Reserve Force accused of harassing a woman in front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters and ?absconding? since Tuesday night, surrendered at New Market police station on Thursday evening for interrogation.

 ?As soon as he came to rejoin duty around 5 pm, he was asked to surrender at New Market police station. Action will be taken against him only after an identification parade,? said an officer of the Reserve Force.

 Singha was later taken to the office of deputy commissioner (central) Ajoy Ranade. ?The constable is being interrogated,? confirmed Ranade.

 ?We have informed the complainant, Tanushree Ghosh, to come to the police station on Friday for the identification parade. If she identifies Singha as the constable who tried to grab her hand for refusing him a bribe last Friday, he will be placed under suspension,? said an investigating officer of New Market police station. ?Departmental action will also be taken against him for his unauthorised absence,? he added.

 Following Singha?s ?disappearance?, a team comprising five Reserve Force men was formed on Wednesday night, but it failed to trace him.

 ?When he turned up for duty in the evening, his colleagues alerted the Reserve Force. Singha said he had gone to a relative?s house in Howrah,? an officer revealed.

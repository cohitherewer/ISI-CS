The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Bengalis, the cream of Bollywood?

 BIPASHA BASU, who plays Nishigandha Dasgupta in Corporate, tells Pratim D. Gupta about pride, passion and performance

Is Corporate the first time you are playing 

a Bengali character?

 Hmmm? yes! You know what, no one?s pointed that out to me before. Although I do not get to speak in Bengali in the movie, the name does it all. It?s a pretty strong one ? Nishigandha Dasgupta. Of course, the character also is very nice.

Madhur Bhandarkar is known to extract stunning 

performances from his leading ladies. What was he like?

 The way I look at it, Corporate is a film about 35 characters and I am one of them. Of course my role is important, but the focus is on the corporate world as a whole. What Madhur is trying to show is that human beings are the same everywhere and that there is only a basic set of emotions. When these corporate people are at work, they are different and when they return home at night, they are different.

The experience must have been very different from 

a No Entry or a Jism?

 Yes, Madhur?s done a lot of research on the subject and the result shows. In fact, I got to learn a lot of new things about the corporate world while shooting for the film. The best thing about Madhur is that he knows what he wants. And I am someone who follows the director?s instructions to a T. So it was very easy to work with him. There was no friction of thoughts even though he was very flexible, open to discussions and inputs.

After appearing with the hottest hunks in Bollywood, 

you have a thinking actor in Kay Kay Menon opposite you?

 Let me correct you on this one, Kay Kay is a total hunk. I find him extremely handsome and extremely intelligent. Then, he is a great actor. He can be sensitive when needed. He can be strong when needed. And when we were not shooting, Kay Kay would always make me laugh. He has this great sense of humour. So that used to make things easy and the chemistry between us came naturally.

Would you call your look in Corporate deglamourised?

 Not at all. The corporate world is one of the most glamourous sectors around because that?s where the money is. The people there are always well styled, but they dress keeping the profession in mind. They are not dressed up for a film. And that is why I think Madhur chose a person like me who can bring out that glam factor in the corporate setting.

While Corporate is a couple of weeks away, 

your Phir Hera Pheri is rocking everywhere?

 That I feel is because people these days lead highly stressed out lives. Films like Phir Hera Pheri are fun and there?s not much to think about. Then Hera Pheri itself was such a big hit. So people are going to the theatres wanting the same magic.

 But a couple of days back I read in one of the newspapers that a 16-year-old boy had committed suicide because he wasn?t allowed to watch Phir Hera Pheri a fourth time. Now that?s not done. People shouldn?t get obsessed about movies. It is just a mode of entertainment and we are all doing our jobs.

Why was your voice dubbed in the film?

 I don?t know. I was the first person to dub for the film, a long time back. I think the makers lost the tapes or got confused somehow. When I asked for an explanation, they sounded apologetic. It really doesn?t make sense because first of all the dubbing was really bad and they lost extra money. Also, they never informed me about this, which is sad.

No such problems with Omkara?

 Not at all. I completely love Vishal Bharadwaj?s sensibility as a director. I play this dancer in the film named Billo Chaman Bahar. It is a character full of masti. There is a similar character in Othello but what Vishal has done is taken the play and then made it into a completely different film; his very own version.

You star with Konkona Sen Sharma in the film. How 

was it shooting with another talented Bengali?

 I feel extremely proud that Bengalis are doing so well in such a big film industry. Not only that, they are the cream of Bollywood and doing some great work. Not only actors, you have Bengali directors, cinematographers, screenplay writers?I have always been pro-Bengali. So I do feel proud to be part of this Bengali brigade.

What?s the status with Dhoom 2?

 We have shot one schedule in Brazil and next we will be headed for South Africa for the rest of the shooting. Working with Yash Raj is always a pleasant experience, from the days of Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai. I was offered Dhoom also but it really had no role for the ladies. This time Adi (Aditya Chopra) has written a great character for me and I couldn?t say no. It?s turning out to be a visual delight and everyone?s looking as good as they can look. Dhoom 2 is like the films we like to see ? youthful and colourful.

You must be missing John though?

 Why? Did he miss me in the first Dhoom? (Laughs) No seriously, he justified what he did in Dhoom. What Dhoom did for him, John did equally good things for Dhoom. Among other things he started this bike cult in India. But Dhoom 2 is a different film altogether. I am sure people will watch it as a new film.

What else is on your platter?

 There is an Abbas-Mustan film with Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan. We shot recently in London for the movie. It?s basically a comedy but with the director duo around, there is also a thrill element to it.

And what about playing Rituparno Ghosh?s Draupadi?

 Call up Ritu and ask him that. I am very much ready to do Draupadi. The day he calls me, I will allot dates. You can say I am more than keen to do it.

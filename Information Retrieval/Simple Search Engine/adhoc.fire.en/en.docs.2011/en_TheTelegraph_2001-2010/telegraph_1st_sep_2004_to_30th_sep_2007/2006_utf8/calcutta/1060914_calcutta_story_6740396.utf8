The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 State buses from Metro stations

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) is gearing up to launch short bus services from all the Metro stations.

 A CSTC official said on Wednesday that services have already been started from Tollygunge Metro station to Joka, Garia and Sakuntala Park. Buses from Dum Dum Metro station to Barasat, Dakshineswar and Howrah station have also been introduced.

 The official added that four buses are being used to offer the services on each route. The number will go up soon.

 Next on the cards is services from Shyambazar, Girish Park, Jatin Das Park and Kalighat Metro stations. The routes will be kept short to increase the frequency of service.

 The CSTC officials have held a detailed discussion with the Metro Railway authorities on how commuters can easily reach Howrah, Sealdah and Kolkata (Chitpur) stations and major roads from the Metro stations. The routes and the number of buses to be put into service, however, have not been fixed.

 The Metro Railway authorities have agreed to provide space on the station compounds for parking the buses and put up billboards publicising the services. Information about the services will also be disseminated through the television sets at the Metro stations.

 Our move is aimed at increasing connectivity between the Metro stations and other parts of the city. We want to create facilities to attract more and more people to the Metro, said CSTC managing director Ashok Bhattacharya.

 Many people avail of the Metro to travel from north Calcutta to south Calcutta or vice versa, but face problems in finding buses from the stations to their destinations. Generally, autorickshaws are the only options available before them. 

 According to the CSTC officials, plans are afoot to launch a joint ticketing system. For example, if a passenger wants to reach Garia from Shyambazar Metro station, he or she will be able to buy a Metro ticket to Tollygunge station and a bus ticket from there to Garia together.

 The CSTC has also decided to ply buses till late at night during Puja. The officials have held a discussion with police in this regard. We will try to ply as many buses as possible to help people to visit the pandals easily, said a CSTC official.

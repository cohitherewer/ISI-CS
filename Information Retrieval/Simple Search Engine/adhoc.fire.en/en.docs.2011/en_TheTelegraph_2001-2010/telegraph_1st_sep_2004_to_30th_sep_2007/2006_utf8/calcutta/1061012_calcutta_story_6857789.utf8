 Bangkok beckons with the lowest-ever flight fare.

 Thai Airways on Wednesday announced a return fare of around Rs 7,000, plus Rs 3,200 tax, on the Calcutta-Bangkok-Calcutta route. The offer will be valid from October 16 till the end of November.

 With Diwali approaching, we are expecting a rise in the number of Bangkok-bound tourists from Calcutta, said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, general manager (Calcutta) of Thai Airways. The fare will be Rs 7,055, plus tax, if the tourist flies back within a month and Rs 7,580, plus tax, if the return flight is scheduled after a month but within a year. The present fair is Rs 8,500, plus tax. 

 The Thai Airways offer is set to stoke a fresh price war, with Singapore Airlines announcing that it will revise its fares in a day or two. The new fares will be lucrative, said Ryan Pua, manager (eastern India), Singapore Airlines.

 Srisinwarakool also said Thai Airways will start daily operations between Calcutta and Bangkok from April 1 next year. It now operates five days a week. From October 30, it will start direct flights between Bangkok and Johannesburg.

 Indian already has a low fare structure for Southeast Asian destinations. Weve the lowest-ever competitive fare in the sector, an airline spokesperson said. It is also offering a flyaway package that includes air fare, stay and food and sightseeing in Bangkok.

 A new route to Bangkok has also opened up for Calcuttans, with Bangladesh-based GMG Airline announcing on Wednesday its Calcutta-Dhaka-Bangkok-Calcutta operations. The service takes off on October 26, said Arindam Chakladar, senior sales officer (Calcutta), GMG. The return fare on the route will be around Rs 14,500, including taxes.

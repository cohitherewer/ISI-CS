 Copycat cheque 

 for charity

 Its celebration time for 

 designer Ritu Kumar. But this time its not international 

 acclaim or show success that has come the ace designers 

 way. After a seven-year court battle against copycats in 

 Calcutta, the designer has finally got her due.

 On Saturday, the designer will 

 donate a cheque worth Rs 1.4 lakh and garments worth lakhs, 

 retrieved from plagiarists in Calcutta, to the Missionaries 

 of Charity.

 The designer had filed a case 

 with the Delhi High Court way back in 1999 against some 

 retailers and manufacturers in Calcutta and surrounding 

 areas, producing and selling fakes of her designs.

 Following this, the court had 

 raided several stores and workshops here and found printing 

 screens belonging to Ritu and direct copies of her designs, 

 which were then sealed off.

 Through an order in mid-2005, 

 the court had directed the defendants to return the goods 

 to Ritu. While six of the seven accused, over a period of 

 time, returned the goods, Nina Talukdar, retailing from 

 her Tivoli Court flat, refused to toe the payback line.

 Nina Talukdar was persistent 

 and she not only did not give back the sealed goods, she 

 even continued with her copying business. This was treated 

 as contempt of court and the court took necessary action 

 against her, Ritu told GoodLife during a chat 

 at Taj Bengal on Wednesday.

 More than a year later, the matter 

 has finally been settled and Nina has handed over a sum 

 of Rs 1.4 lakh along with the sealed goods, which include 

 95 sets of embroidered silk salwar suits, to Ritus 

 company Ritika Limited.

 I will hand over the money 

 and all the garments seized from the various accused units 

 to Mother Teresas charity home, revealed Ritu.

 Though the Delhi-based designer 

 wants to forget the long and tedious process 

 of the seven-year case, the landmark judgment, she feels, 

 will definitely make a difference to the Indian fashion 

 industry. 

 This is the first time that 

 an Indian court has passed such a judgment in a copyright 

 case in the fashion space. I am sure this will deter people 

 from indulging in plagiarism. At least people will now think 

 twice because they cant go scot-free by doing it, 

 said Ritu.

 The judgment has already made 

 a difference, believes the designer who had started out 

 with one fashion address in south Calcutta. At one 

 time, copies of my designs were flooding the Calcutta market. 

 So much so that I was losing motivation to produce and losing 

 my interest in Calcutta. In fact, I was considering shutting 

 down my operations in Calcutta. But gradually as the case 

 proceeded and I was winning individual cases against the 

 defendants, copying of my designs went down majorly. People 

 now wont want to tangle with me, she smiled.

 But the battle against copycats 

 was not just a personal one. I wanted to stop this 

 blatant infringement of intellectual rights. My aim was 

 also to prove a point to everyone that a fashion creation 

 is as much an intellectual property as any other work of 

 art, she signed off.

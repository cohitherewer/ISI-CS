He has worked magic on some of the most beautiful faces in show business, for the past 17 years. He has also worked magic on some beautifully ordinary faces. His forte, he feels, is to carefully watch a face and bring out its latent, untapped beauty.

 In town for an Aviance beauty workshop, make-up maestro Cory Walia, talks to GoodLife about his secrets, stars and some.

Exquisite eyes

 Rani Mukherjee. Cory firmly believes that Bengal is the place to go for beautiful eyes. Most Bengali women have amazing eyes and Ranis smouldering, expressive and intense eyes leads them all.

 His prescription for her? Only kajal and mascara is what she needs. Cory also has a soft corner for the very Bengali eyes of Bipasha Basu and Koena Mitra. They have jet black eyes without lenses.

Perfect pout

 Bipasha Basu. I love giving her lips this pale, fleshy Naomi Campbell look, says Cory.

 Want to copy the Bips pout? Line the lips with a pink-brown liner and shade with lip-liner along the edges of the lips. Dab a dot of foundation both on the lower and the upper lips and blend well (blending, says Cory, is the secret to great make-up.) Complete the look with a lightly frosted gloss. Make the look slightly brighter or more brown depending on your face tone, he suggests.

Mane marvel 

 Aishwarya Rai. She has beautiful hair but the look I like best on her is the messy pile-up on her head, he says.

 Create the same look by taking the hair up and pinning sections randomly. Let some strands fall loose and frame the face.

This upswept look is something that hardly ever fails, 

feels Cory. When in doubt, do a messy pile up. Carelessly careful is the 

way to go.

Cheekbone charm

 Malaika Arora Khan. The secret is the taut skin over her cheekbones. All it needs is a sweep of shimmering cream blush, says Cory.

 But for those who want to create the illusion of such stunning cheekbones, play up the area between the eyes and the cheekbones with a highlighter and then shade just under the cheekbone to bring it into focus.

Dramatic difference

 Amrita Arora. Any person who gets completely transformed thanks to make-up, says Cory, has to have a very plain face. Only then can she be like a chameleon ? sometimes sensual, sometimes innocent and sometimes devi-like.

 Amrita with all her girl-next-door looks can transform into a babe or a sex siren instantly, with make-up. 

Naturally nice

 Riya Sen. For her naturally pretty features. Her skin is so fabulous that she looks perfectly made up with only moisturiser, says Cory, who never feels the need to dab the greasepaint on Riya.

Tips of the trade

 Seventeen years of experience. Naturally, the man has an opinion on everything from Rakhi Sawants perpetual pout to photography.

 He also thinks the mascara is, by far, the most underrated make-up product while the most overrated is, well, glitter. Oh God, its a useless thing, he says.

 Heres more from Cory Walia:

 Eye drops work wonders. Just squeeze in a drop 

each ahead of the cleaning, toning and moisturising routine before beginning the 

make-up.

 To make the lipstick last longer, dab some 

eye shadow on your lips after applying the liner. Choose an eye colour that 

is close to the lipstick, says Cory. Finish off with the lipstick and then 

gloss. 

 Use your ring finger for blending under the 

eye. The ring finger, being the weakest and the softest finger, works best. Use 

the patting motion to place the concealer under the eyes.

 Use a water-based foundation like a pancake 

on squeezed pimple marks and other scars. Oil-based make-up products are not capable 

of covering marks. This is because scar tissues dont have pores and 

hence reject most make-up products, he says.

 Cover smudged eye make-up with a concealer. 

Apply with an angular brush.

 Pull your eyelid up and then use an eyelash 

curler to prevent pinching your skin. Also, curl the lashes before coating with 

mascara to avoid mess.

 To line lips, perfectly, begin by defining 

the V. Then start with the outer corners and join inwards to get a smooth, straight 

line.

 Never forget to cover the throat, ears and 

back of the neck for the flawless finish.

 Philosophy on stage

 A remarkably poetic play on the three great human experiences love, divinity and death Bratya Basus Mrityu, Ishwar, Jaunota attempts to portray and analyse some critical philosophical and psychological concepts. The action of the play progresses through three main sequences, characterised by Shokal (morning), Bikel (evening) and Ratri (night), who are associated with love, God and death, respectively. Shokal, the central protagonist, explains that sexuality does not merely stand for carnal passion; it also inspires creative imagination, sensuousness, intuition and love. Bikel represents an inner awakening to the presence of the divine. Instead of being depicted as a religious icon, God is visualised as a symbol of virtue, integrity and perfection. Ratri, which holds the strands of the plot together, describes death not as an escape or obstacle to achievement, but as the natural culmination of our constant efforts to excel ourselves. Direction: Debashish Basu.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Mrityu, Ishwar, Jaunota, produced by Srijak 

When: Today at 6.45 pm

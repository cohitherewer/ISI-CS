 What: 

 Inauguration of Art Beat 2, an exhibition of paintings by 

 Masters Collection Art Gallery, in association with HSBC.

 Where: Taj Bengal.

 When: September 2. On till September 24 at the Masters Collection Art Gallery, at 3, Woodburn Park Road (near South Club).

 Take a look: Though the showcase is billed as an exhibition of contemporary art by eminent artists of Bengal, the bouquet includes quite a few lesser-known names as well. Judging by the way works were being swept up, even before the formal inauguration by author Sunil Gangopadhyay, Art Beat 2 seemed to have got quite a headstart.

 Suhas Roys small mixed media portrait with its soft touches of blue and pink on a haze of black is certainly one of the best in his Radha series. Hiran Mitras abstract acrylic where geometric shapes, textures and chiaroscuro try to capture Inner Sensations was another standout. If Prakash Karmakar presents a nocturnal landscape with bright yellow moonlight, in Ramananda Bandopadhyays tiny linear drawing, pink is the colour of Pyar suffusing a womans form. Sharing space with them are Kazi Anirbans robust Maria, Shyamasree Basus Creation, Sanatan Dindas Yeogopurush, Samindranath Majumdars acrylic Remembrance of Things Past, Minakshi Des reclining Woman in charcoal and conty, Shakila Sheikhs collage of Three Women and the works of 33 other artists like Jogen Chowdhury, B.R. Panesar, Bijon Choudhury, Shuvaprasanna, Samir Aich, Wasim Kapoor, Subrata Gangopadhya and Debabrata Chakraborti.

 Voiceover: Proceeds from the show will go to the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf and Dumb, said Sahil Desai of Masters Collection Art Gallery.

 Stone style

 What: Launch of a jewellery collection Be Your Own Unique Style, from Art Karat.

 Where: Genesis Art Gallery at 8B, Middleton Street.

 When: Till September 13.

 Take a look: The launch kicked off with an exhibition that offers an array of exclusive jewellery forms. The latest line from jewellery designer Asha Kamal Modi offers pretty neckpieces with matching long earrings, bracelets and rings. Set with coral, citrine, amethyst, tourmaline, rose-quartz, turquoise, pearls and other precious and semi-precious stones, each piece has been crafted intricately.

 Pocket pinch: The price tag reads Rs 1,200-plus.

 Voiceover: The collection is unique, affordable and gives women a feeling of completeness, said Asha.

 Melody mix

 What: Annual inter-club Antakshari.

 Where: Dalhousie Institute (DI).

 When: September 2.

 Tune in: RCGC, CC amp;FC, Tollygunge Club, Calcutta Club, Saturday Club, Ordnance Club, Dakshin Kalikata Sansad, Outram Club, Lake Club, Calcutta Rowing Club, Indian Life Saving Society (ILSS) and DI, vied for the rolling trophy introduced this year by the host club.

 Conducted by Pranam Roy and Sujata, the Antakshari saw families flocking to enjoy an evening of tunes and togetherness. Seven rounds, including a visual round and a Bengali round, were played out. Lots of audience questions pumped up the crowd energy. Young participants supported by their seniors showcased a melodious mix of old and new tunes.

 ILSS lifted the winning trophy, with Ordnance Club the first runner-up and Calcutta Club the second runner-up.

 Also spotted: Quiz guru Derek Brien, looking cool in a white-and-beige combo.

 Voiceover: The response to Antakshari is overwhelming. The popularity graph can be judged by the entry of four new clubs this year (Calcutta Club, RCGC, Ordnance and Tolly), said Raju Raman, member-in-charge of cultural programmes.

 Home haute

 What: Launch of Godrej Lifespace stores.

 When: September 6 and 7.

 Where: BT Road and Brabourne Road.

 the year-end, smiled Shyam Motwani, vice-president

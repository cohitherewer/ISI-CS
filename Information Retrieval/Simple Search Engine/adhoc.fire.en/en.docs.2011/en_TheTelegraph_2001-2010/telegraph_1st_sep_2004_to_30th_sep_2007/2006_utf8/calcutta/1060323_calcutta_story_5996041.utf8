 Cops turn away dead teen?s kin

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five days have passed since his employer allegedly poisoned 17-year-old Sukesh Pal to death, but officers of Sinthee police station have not allowed his brother to register a first information report (FIR). 

 The cops, however, claim they are investigating the case. 

 Sukesh, who hailed from Nadia, had been employed for a year in a gold ornament-manufacturing unit, owned by Haripada Bhuiyan, on Gopal Bose Road. The teenager?s family alleged that Bhuiyan had physically tortured him since he joined the unit.

 According to witnesses, on Friday, too, Bhuiyan had beaten up the boy. Sukesh was later found unconscious inside the manufacturing unit around 2.30 pm. A bottle of insecticide was found beside him. Sukesh died at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital around 7.45 pm the same day.

 The family was informed and Sukesh?s elder brother Arabindo reached Calcutta on Saturday. When he tried lodging a complaint at the police station, he was turned away.

 A. Raju, officer-in-charge of Sinthee police station, was tightlipped about the incident: ?We are investigating the case. No arrest has been made.?

 He refused comment on being asked why he had refused to accept an FIR and on what basis he had started an investigation.

 ?The officers kept me waiting for an hour before starting to question me. I was frightened. They did not register my complaint. We are poor people and do not know where to go for justice,? said Arabindo. 

 An inquiry revealed that Bhuiyan was picked up by Sinthee police on Friday night and has been ?missing? since. Sources said he has been kept in police custody. Police, however, denied detaining him.

 ?Bhuiyan beat Sukesh with a stick on Friday afternoon after locking the door of the establishment from inside. The boy was crying loudly but we never thought that he would be poisoned to death,? stated local resident Alok Das.

 Workers of an adjacent factory had sneaked in through the window to discover Sukesh lying unconscious.

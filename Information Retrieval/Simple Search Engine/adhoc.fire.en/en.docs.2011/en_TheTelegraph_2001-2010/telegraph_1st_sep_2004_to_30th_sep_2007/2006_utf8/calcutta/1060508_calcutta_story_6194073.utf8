 Four held on fraud charge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four persons, including a couple, were arrested on Sunday on charges of forging documents and cheating a businessman of the Bowbazar area of his belongings. They were produced in Bankshal court and remanded in police custody till May 18.

 According to Bowbazar police station, Shibprasad Agarwal and his wife Manju allegedly transferred all the properties, including a firm and several bank accounts, of his elder brother, S.N. Agarwal, in their names by forging his signature.

 The duo changed all the papers relating to the firm with the help of two chartered accountants, Akhil Kumar Manglik and Nirmal Kaushik, who were also arrested in the raid. The firm?s office is located on Ganesh Chandra Avenue.

 ?By forging his signature, the couple cheated S.N. Agarwal of crores. It was a pre-planned and well-thought-out act and both Akhil and Nirmal were party to it. Investigation is on to ascertain whether any other people are involved,? deputy commissioner of police (central) Ajay Kumar said.

 The modus operandi, according to investigators, was simple. Last year, Shibprasad and his wife worked out the plan in consultation with the two chartered accountants. 

 The couple later prepared a draft on behalf of S.N. Agarwal, declaring that ?I am retiring and from now on Shibprasad and his wife will take over the factory. In addition, all my bank accounts and properties should be transferred in their names?. 

 But S.N. Agarwal?s wife got wind of the plans on October 10 last year, when she visited her husband?s bank to withdraw cash. She immediately brought it to the notice of her husband, who was flummoxed.

 Realising that he was ?really cheated?, S.N. Agarwal and his wife lodged a complaint with the police in October. A team from Bowbazar police station raided the Gurusaday Road flat of Shibprasad and arrested him and his wife.

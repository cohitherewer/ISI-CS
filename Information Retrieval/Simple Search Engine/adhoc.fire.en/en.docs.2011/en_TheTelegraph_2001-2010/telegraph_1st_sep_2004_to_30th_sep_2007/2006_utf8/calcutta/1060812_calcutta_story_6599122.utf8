 JU may bend rules for HS toppers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University (JU) is set to adopt a well-defined policy for allotting seats to students with outstanding results in Higher Secondary (HS) or equivalent exams in departments of their choice.

 The JU authorities said there has been a rise in the number of requests from the toppers of HS and other examinations to offer them seats in departments of their choice.

 This year, they added, the university had received five such applications. The list includes Subhankar Roy Chowdhurys request, who topped HS 2006 with a record 99.99 per cent.

 There should be a well-defined policy for creating special seats for outstanding students, said Partha Pratim Biswas, a senior teacher of the university and a member of the universitys executive council.

 He added that the university had never received so many requests in a single year. The matter will come up for discussion at the executive council meeting next Thursday.

 According to the rules of the state, it is mandatory for all engineering institutions to admit students in various departments strictly on the basis of seats allotted by the state joint entrance examination (JEE) merit list.

 The selection of the department is made by the JEE board, on the basis of the rank the examinee holds on the JEE merit list. 

 The university, being an autonomous institution, had been following a convention to create extra seats to accommodate exceptionally meritorious students, if they were not allotted a seat by the JEE board in a department of their choice.

 Subhankar Roy Chowdhury, despite topping HS examinations, got a rank of 1600 in JEE. The board gave him a seat in civil engineering in Jadavpur University (JU). 

 Later, he appealed for a seat in the electronics and telecommunication engineering department.

 The authorities added that the university is considering the applications. The situation is changing. There should be a clear view on this matter. We cannot just depend on precedents, a university official said.

 Model moves from Mauritius

 PASSING 

 THROUGH

 Viveka Babajee at 

 The Park on Friday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 Its been a long and fruitful 

 journey, she begins. Another grandmothers tale you 

 might think. Only for a second, because it would take more 

 than a top make-up artist to make Viveka Babajee look anything 

 like a grandmom. But her 13-year brush with the spotlight 

 has indeed taught her much, Viveka tells GoodLife, 

 in town for the Fashion Police show at The Park on Friday. 

 My mother tells me I wanted 

 to be Miss Mauritius when I was five. The idea of the glittering 

 crown sure did excite me but thats all I understood 

 back then, says Viveka. With the Miss Mauritius crown 

 on her head when she was 16, Viveka went on to participate 

 in both the Miss World and Miss Universe contests in 93 

 and 94, before moving to Mumbai. 

 Boman Irani, who was then 

 a photographer, shot my portfolio. Nice pictures, but I 

 hated Mumbai, she says, softly. The wannabe model 

 then moved to London and pretty much did the same there 

 ? a portfolio, some agencies. But again, a strong dislike 

 for London, and it was back to Mauritius, to her conservative 

 family of academicians and artists. 

 I invariably ended up feeling 

 so rejected and dejected... cold shoulders, cold vibes? 

 I hated every moment of it, confesses the glam girl, 

 now well settled in the not-so-warm, fiercely competitive 

 modelling industry. 

 Back home, I opened a tourist 

 shop and modelled part-time till an Elle editorial 

 shoot got me back to India in 1998. I met lensman Atul Kasbekar 

 here and eventually did the Kama Sutra condom campaign. 

 And how did her conservative 

 family react to that bold move? Oh, that was 

 a tricky situation but it was simpler than I anticipated. 

 By then my folks knew I was unstoppable and all for the 

 right reasons ? sheer passion for modelling and not just 

 for-the-heck rebellious attitude, she says. 

 Viveka has been modelling in Mumbai 

 non-stop for the past eight years, and these years have 

 taught her more about life than Mauritius could ever 

 have. 

 She has taken her next big step. 

 No, not a crossover movie or item jhatkas, Viveka 

 is now also a fashion choreographer. Shes got her 

 hands full with LOreal shows and all assignments of 

 Matrix, an event house.

 The sad point is that I 

 am still worth the ramp but other choreographers have stopped 

 taking me for their shows. Insecurities, pronounces 

 Vivekanandini Babajee. 

 Yes, you read the name right. 

 Of course, there is a story behind that too.

 I have three elder sisters 

 and my parents really wanted a son. A son who they decided 

 to name Vivekananda? But when I was born, that quickly got 

 extended to Vivekanandini!

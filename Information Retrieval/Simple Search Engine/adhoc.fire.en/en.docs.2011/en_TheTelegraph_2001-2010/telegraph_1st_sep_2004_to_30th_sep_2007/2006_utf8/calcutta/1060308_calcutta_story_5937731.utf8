 Heritage gate waits for restore touch

 One of the most striking features of No 5 Russell Street, next to the ITC glass box, was its arched gateway, which even now, visitors from abroad look around for in vain. It was demolished on the night of August 25-26, 2001.

 This house has a long history. Which is why the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) included what was the Bishop?s former residence, in the heritage list in terms of Section 425B of the CMC Act, 1980, as SL No 298. The gateway was, surprisingly, included in the same list as SL No 307.

 The original house was constructed by Major Mark Wood in 1763 on 12 bighas, the first construction on the street, according to Schalch?s map. Before leaving India, the major sold it to Captain John Ulric Collins in 1786 for Rs 61,840.

 The captain, in turn, sold it to Russick Lal Dutt in 1803. His family was in the business of acquiring and then leasing residential properties to Europeans in Chowringhee. 

 His son, Uday Chand, sold it to James Pattle, a civil servant with the East India Company, on May 14, 1824, for a lakh. Pattle leased it to the Company as the Episcopal Residence at a monthly rent of Rs 600.

 Bishop Heber, the second Bishop of Calcutta, officially took up residence at 5, Russell Street in October 1825. Till the consecration of the new cathedral named after St Paul, No 5 was home to five bishops.

 It served as a boarding house for the young men of the Company after the death of Bishop Wilson. His executor, Prince Golam Mohammed, sold it, and in 1890, it was conveyed to the estate of Elias David Joseph Ezra. In 1916, the property was conveyed to YMCA.

 After the demolition of the gateway, then CMC commissioner D. Som had written on September 7, 2001, to the National Council of YMCAs of India, in New Delhi, requesting it to ?reconstruct and restore the gateway to its original shape and character in consultation with the conservation architect without delay and complete within a period of six months from the date of issuance? of the letter.

 Calcutta High Court has also admitted a case filed by the Destiny of Calcutta Anglo Indian Association asking for a court permission to renovate and reconstruct the structure. Nothing has come of it.

 The deputy chief municipal architect amp; town planner of the CMC informed INTACH in October 2005 that he was in the process of issuing instructions to it to undertake restoration of the gateway. That letter is yet to arrive.

 G.M. Kapur, convener, INTACH, says these bungalows, including Meghalaya House and 5 and 6 Middleton Row, all part of the Royal Calcutta Turf Club, represent an architectural typology which will vanish from the city, now that they have been delisted.

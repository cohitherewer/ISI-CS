The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Listen to their heart beat

Screen On amp; Off

 Siddharth Basu?s follow-up to Kaun Banega Crorepati, Heart Beat ? Dil Thham Ke Khelo had a rocky start in Calcutta, thanks to the STAR network missing from more than 70 per cent cable homes in the city. But now that some of the subscription problems have been resolved, you can watch the quiz show, played against the heartbeat and not the clock.

 While STAR One is still missing from several homes, viewers can catch the heart-stopping action on STAR Plus on Sunday nights (10.30 pm), when the whole week?s (Monday to Thursday) half-hour episodes are telecast together on the most popular general entertainment channel.

 The stars you have missed playing the game include Varun Badola, Mandira Bedi and Vinod Kambli. While Badola was in top form, stretching his play through many an episode, Kambli found himself crying his way to Rs 7 lakh.

 This week, feel the pulse of former 

 Bollywood actress Namrata Shirodkar, TV actor Hussain and 

 telly host Pooja Bedi as they go through the Q amp;A.

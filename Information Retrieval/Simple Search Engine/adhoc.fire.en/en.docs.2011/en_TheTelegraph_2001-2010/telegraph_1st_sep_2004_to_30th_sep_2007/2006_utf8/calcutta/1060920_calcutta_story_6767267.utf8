 Club culture of turf tussles 

 - Shift from 105-year tradition in one, post-seeker under cloud in another

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Club and conflict seem to go hand in hand this season, with Calcuttas social institutions engaged in one power play after another. Close on the heels of the acrimonious face-off for the presidents post at the Calcutta Club AGM last month and the hectic last-ditch parleys at CC amp;FC to avert a similar showdown, come turf tussles at two other leading clubs Saturday Club on Wednesday and Tollygunge Club on Friday.

 While at Saturday Club, on Wood Street, a 105-year-old tradition is being broken with a contest for the presidents post, further south at the Tollygunge Club, the candidature of the incumbent was questioned on the ground that he was a non-resident member.

 Two challengers Kewal Nayar and Rathin Sen have thrown their hats into the ring at Saturday Club, where sitting vice-president A.K. Chatterjee was to have moved into the presidents chair, to be vacated by Arjun De, as per convention, at Wednesdays AGM. Some conventions are more significant than written constitutions, says past president Prem Nayar, lamenting the departure from age-old custom.

 The outgoing committee led by De, which hasnt nominated Chatterjee (who won from the floor last year), maintains that a secret ballot has revealed a majority of club members didnt want anyone to be nominated. Renu Roy and Dilip Burman are contesting for vice-president. Club members have been bombarded with calls and mobile messages by candidates canvassing their own cause.

 At Tolly, where the outgoing committee nominates the new president and vice-president, a group of members had raised questions whether sitting vice-president Abhijit Majumdar is a resident of Calcutta.

 Theres no problem (at Fridays AGM). Majumdar is the candidate for president and M.J.Z. Moula for vice-president, declares K.B. Menon, chief executive amp; managing member of the club. But outgoing president Subir Bose had to send a special circular to each member, clarifying the veracity of Majumdars candidature. Theres still an underlying tension, with 11 candidates running for seven committee posts five from the floor, far higher than normal.

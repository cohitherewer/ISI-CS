 nomadic spirit: Michelle Rodriguez

 She may be playing a tough cop in Lost but in real life actress Michelle Rodriguez has been caught on the other side of the law many a time. Her drinking and driving have twice landed her in jail in the recent past and the actress wants to start afresh by launching her own fashion line.

 Michelle is one of the actors who has been introduced in the second season of Lost, the popular Emmy-winning mini series on STAR Movies. She plays LAPD cop Ana Lucia Cortez who will only be seen in this season because she signed a one-year contract with the producers for her nomadic spirit.

 Making a breakthrough in the world of showbiz with the film Girlfight, Michelle has been seen in blockbusters like Resident Evil and The Fast and the Furious. She has also recently completed a starring role in the Wes Craven-produced The Breed, and her voice will soon be heard in the animated film Sian Kaan, alongside Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina. 

 You can catch Michelle, one of Maxims 100 Sexiest People, on Lost every Thursday on STAR Movies.

 For all those teens and tweens out there earning applause by mouthing a dialogue from Sholay with aplomb and doing a moonwalk a la Hrithik Roshan, heres a bigger platform to do their thing. 

 Sahara One has launched a talent hunt for a reality show called Super Stars: Life Badal De. This is not about just dancing or singing or copying a superstar but about being an overall performer, stressed Sahara One COO Purnendu Bose in Calcutta on Tuesday. 

 The show would be based on the hit international format Performing As... It debuted in Holland in 1983. Since then we have run 70 series in 23 countries, including the UK, Germany and the US, said Rajesh Kamat, managing director, Endemol India, about the format owned by Endemol. 

 Before Performing As, India has seen other Endemol formats like Fear Factor and Heart Beat on the small screen and will also get to see the desi version of the international favourite Big Brother.

 Super Stars would require the participants to bring an Amitabh Bachchan or a Shah Rukh Khan alive through all facets of the particular stars performance. We have chosen 12 superstars. Every week the challenge will be based on a specific star. That, of course, does not mean that if we find a great Mithun Chakraborty in Calcutta we leave him behind, Bose said. 

 For each of the superstars, 10 performers will be selected initially. Then the best Amitabh battles the best Shah Rukh and the rest for a pruning from a dozen to the final six. 

 The biggest fan who becomes his hero or heroine best, according to celebrity judges Shiamak Davar and Urmila Matondkar, gets a Rs 1 crore booty plus a chance to act on the big screen. The auditions happen in Calcutta on August 17 and 18 while the multitudes of Khans and Rais descend on the small screen from September.

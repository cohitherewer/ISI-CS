 Foul air plea in high court 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The transport department, in an affidavit before Calcutta High Court, has confessed that lack of infrastructure and manpower were behind the traffic congestion and excessive pollution in the city.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury submitted the affidavit on December 2 on the courts order, mentioning that the motor vehicles enforcement wing and the traffic police did not have the infrastructure to check vehicles between 11 pm and 8 am.

 As a result, loaded trucks ply in the city during these hours, resulting in a rise in air pollution. The document states the government will adopt measures to check goods traffic at night. If we can put in place regular checking infrastructure at night, pollution will come down considerably, said Chowdhury. 

 Environment activist Subhas Datta said: The state seems reluctant to act. NGOs, too, will have to come forward.

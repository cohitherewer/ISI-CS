The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buy quality at cut rates 

 - Brand drives bargain boom as shoppers snap up discounts

 NISHA LAHIRI AND ZEESHAN JAWED

 The city is on ?sale? and it suits the shoppers just fine. As the mercury rises and the prices drop, it?s time to splurge. And the increasingly brand-conscious Calcutta consumer is eyeing quality options at discounted rates, from the Tommy Hilfigers to the Omegas.

 A sale sign for shoppers is like ?a red flag for a bull? even during the lean season because of the value-for-money factor, feels Gautam Jatia, CEO of Landmark.

 Tommy Hilfiger conducts two sales every year. This time, it?s all sold out. ?When they get discounts, they spend more, since it means more value for the same amount of money,? concurs a spokesperson for the Elgin Road apparel store.

 Brand awareness is the basis for today?s bargain bonanza. ?The number of walk-ins at Prime Watch World outlets has doubled in the past couple of years, because people want to upgrade their lifestyle,? sums up Rajiv Chopra at the store where Omega, Christian Dior and more are ticking away on a one-month sale.

 At the Oxford Bookstore annual price slash, Calcutta rates as ?the best? among the other metros, according to CEO Rajiv Chowdhry. ?It is an opportunity for people to buy the best books not easily available or affordable,? he explains.

 Rock-bottom pricing is not the page-turner here. Rather, quality rules over quantity. There is a vast range of books on sale, from kids? stuff to classics. ?We have sourced a lot of books from places like the US and UK, negotiating prices,? adds Chowdhry.

 Calcuttans no longer wait for Puja or Poila Bosiakh, as the retail graph switches from a few peaks to round-the-year shopping highs.

 ?With the boom in the retail sector, awareness has gone up. For many, a sale is a golden opportunity to buy big brands. The average rate of discount has also gone up now, from around 20 to 25 per cent to over 60 per cent,? says Madhusudan Binani, who owns the franchise for brands like Satya Paul, Van Heusen, Reebok and United Colours of Benetton here.

 The sale at all these outlets have just concluded, and the response, adds Binani, ?has been very good?.

 Even at Pantaloons, which ended its rack clearance sale on February 12, quality was the key. ?It?s the hyper-market concept that is making people more quality-conscious,? says Suresh Sadhwani, area manager, Pantaloons. So, the big brands on sale were more popular than the basics.

 The lure of the brand is drawing a steady footfall, round the clock, at the fall-winter Wills Lifestyle store sale. 

 It?s often about matching supply to ?sale? demand. At 2.30 pm on a March afternoon, as buyers were busy raiding the racks at the College Street Bata outlet, the man behind the counter summed it up: ?We were supposed to end the sale this week, but fresh stocks have been ordered for at least another month.?

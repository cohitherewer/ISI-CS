 State in upgrade dawdle

 - IIT status report on campus duo next week, minister mum 

 OUR BUREAU

 The state government is still cold to the proposal of granting IIT status to Jadavpur University (JU) and Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU), Shibpur, with barely a week to go before an expert committee submits its report on the upgrade.

 ?The question of discussing the proposal with the Centre does not arise,? said higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty. 

 ?We first need to know how the system will function before we spell out our stand. As for the two universities, they are autonomous and have powers to take their own decisions in this regard,? the minister added.

 Sources, however, said the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government fears that its grip over the two institutions will weaken if the upgrade proposal comes through. 

 Despite the minister?s claim that the universities are autonomous, the sources point out, it?s the government that pulls the strings in their affairs.

 The three-member expert panel appointed by the Centre conducted ?spot inspections? of the two institutions in December last year and will submit its report on February 13.

 Human resources development ministry officials said the panel had rated JU and BESU the ?most deserving? of the seven institutions shortlisted for the upgrade.

 The panel has also reportedly suggested that the Centre conduct a final inspection of the universities at the earliest.

 ?We hope to start examining the committee?s report in the third week of this month. We will get in touch with the state government once again, after the final inspection is over,? Irina Garg, a senior official in the ministry looking after the IITs, said from Delhi.

 The state?s attitude, on the other hand, has created concern among students, teachers and other employees of JU and BESU. 

 ?We have initiated several projects in regard to the functioning of the university. We are ready for the upgrade,? said Partha Pratim Biswas, a senior teacher and member of the executive council of JU. 

 At BESU, the teachers? council recently held a meeting and adopted a unanimous resolution urging the state government to agree to the upgrade. 

 Vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea said: ?As of now, we feel the outcome of the inspection will be in our favour. But the state government has not held any talks with us on the issue.?

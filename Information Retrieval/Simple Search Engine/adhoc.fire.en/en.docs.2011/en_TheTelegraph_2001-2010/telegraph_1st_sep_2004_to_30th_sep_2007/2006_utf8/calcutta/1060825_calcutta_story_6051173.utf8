 Local punters, bookies in Inzy tizzy

 Not only Lahore and London, even Calcutta is reeling under the heat of the Inzamam-ul-Haq and Darrell Hair duel. However, this one is in the betting bastion and not on the cricket pitch. 

 The punters of the city, who had placed their bets on an England victory for the fourth Test, are accusing the bookmakers of cheating. 

 The punters say that as the International Council of Cricket (ICC) has declared England the winner, they should receive their share of the pie. The bookies in England have already paid the people who had betted for England. 

 For any Test match, the bookies give three odds: win, loss or draw. They argue that the fourth Test between England and Pakistan ended without reaching any of the above results. 

 The match ended without being completed, that means it was cancelled. When the match was cancelled, how can we assume that England would have won the match? If the ICC has awarded the match to England, it is their internal matter. We will not go by it, affirms a bookie in Howrah. 

 The Test match between England and Pakistan at the Oval took an ugly turn on Sunday afternoon when, initially, Pakistan refused to take the field in the post-tea session on the fourth day of play, after umpire Darrell Hair accused them of ball tampering and awarded five penalty runs to England. 

 But after half an hour, when the Pakistanis returned to play, the umpires had already drawn stumps 

 The ICC has awarded the match to the English team. As a result, the bookies and online gambling portals in England paid the people who betted for an England win. The punters in Calcutta also want the bookies to pay up.

 The supreme body of international cricket, ICC, has given the verdict. We did not cook it up, says a punter. 

 At the beginning of the fourth Test on August 17, the English were the favourites as they were leading the four-match series by 2-0. 

 But the match took a turn when Inzy amp; Co came up with some brilliant performances on the field.

 There were many people who had placed their money on Pakistan. Do you think they would pay up? Similarly, we too cannot pay back because we will face severe losses, explains another bookie in Baguiati. 

 With some major cricketing events coming up later this year, the current tiff between the bookmakers and the punters is likely to hit the business of the bookies in Calcutta. 

 The beauty of this business is that it runs on trust completely. But this unfortunate episode has created an environment of uncertainty. Many people might stop betting because of this episode, says a bookie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Wine-dine den

 SUBHRO SAHA

Dig into a scrumptious platter of Turkish kebaps or savour a soup Moroccan style. Party in style in the private karaoke room with the mini-bar wheeled in, the live grill set the way you want it, personal butler in attendance. Sip your single-malt with an international array of bar snacks to the strains of cool jazz, or maybe a stand-up satire show. On your way out, pick up some blueberry cheesecake from the in-house deli or a half-yard beer glass as a signature souvenir.

 l at Mezze, right in the heart of south Calcutta.

 The dine-wine-entertainment den spread across 5,000 sq ft at Ideal Plaza, off Minto Park, promises to raise the bar this peak party season.

 The magic melange (11/1, Sarat Bose Road) comprising Mezze, Calcuttas first authentic Mediterranean restaurant, Soho, the lifestyle kitchen bar along with the Soho Ultra Lounge exclusively for members and the Soho Deli, also offering Hard Rock Cafe-style designer merchandise, will open its doors mid-December to catch the Yuletide window.

 Our mission is to deliver five-star deluxe standards at an affordable price in a cheerful ambience without compromising on the quality of food and beverages, standardisation, hygiene and service, stresses Vishal Kapur of promoters Cool Foods, which has also rolled out Yo Foodies and I-Lounge in The Metropolis, Hiland Park.

 Mezze will focus on Turkish, Greek, Italian, Moroccan and North Indian Frontier delicacies in buffet and a la carte formats to go with an exhaustive choice of fine old-world and contemporary wines. 

 Soho, on the other hand, hopes to be spoken about in the same breath as an Attica or Indochine in Clarke Quay, the heart of 24x7 party-city Singapore.

 To operate 12 noon through 12 midnight on weekdays and till 2 am on weekends, the lifestyle lounge will have resident DJ Denzil from Mumbai and DJ Bom from Thailand as guest to man the mix console, spinning the latest global party tracks from midday.

 We will have a mix of Tapas, Chinese, Thai, grilled items, fondues and sandwiches apart from some of the most famous bar snacks from across the world. These will complement the more than 150 cocktails, premium domestic and international liquor choices with a focus on single malt whiskies and the finest cigars, says cocktail king Irfan, also part of the Lansdowne lifestyle venture.

 The Soho Ultra Lounge will stress on corporate members with a day membership option as well. Apart from a variety of international finger foods to accompany the wines, spirits, liqueurs, single-malts, cigars and shishas, a unique feature will be the private karaoke rooms.

 Each of our three thematic rooms of different sizes will have a distinct design, with karaoke facilities and options of playing both house DJ music, TV audio or your own DVDs/CDs, besides wheel-in grill and bar, and butler service. These are perfect pads for private parties, product launches or interactive workshops, says Apratim Dhar of Cool Foods. 

 Another novel element, the Soho Deli, located at the entrance lobby, will showcase customised desserts, cakes, puddings, pastries, chocolates, cookies, brownies, and various types of bread, besides homemade packaged dips and sauces.

 Failed climb spurs fresh 

attempt

 ROMILA SAHA

 It was their love for mountains that prompted 32 youths to undertake an expedition to the Dronagiri peak near the Baghini glacier, in Uttaranchal.

 But despite their willpower, members of Howrah District Mountaineers and Trekkers Association had to suffer at the hands of nature. After three days at camp III, the nine members, who were on their last lap to scale the peak, had to return due to heavy snowfall and rough winds.

 Dronagiri (21,290 ft) is situated outside the Nanda Devi sanctuary in Uttaranchal, close to the Indo-Chinese border. In 1988, two trekkers of Durgapur Mountaineering Association had lost their lives in the snowfall while trying to scale the peak.

 The Howrah team started its trek from Juma, an army checkpost about 45 km from Joshimath, on August 14. The route to the peaks base camp was steep.

 Heavy snowfall made the climb through a terrain strewn with boulders more difficult. We were exhausted by the time we reached the base camp situated in the moraine zone of Baghini glacier. We were at an altitude of almost 15,000 ft, recalled Kiran Mukherjee, secretary of the club.

 It took five days for the youths to cover the distance between camp I and II. They reached camp III on August 28.

 The blizzard began on August 30, a day before the team was scheduled to reach camp IV. The two sherpas who were accompanying the team had already deposited the equipment and food at camp IV. 

 An avalanche triggered by the blizzard devastated camp IV. The nine members were almost trapped.

 Loose snow was falling continuously and depositing on our tents, said Subrata Banerjee, a team member. 

 We stayed awake all night and took turns to clear the snow to prevent suffocation. It was also difficult to cook at minus 10 degrees Celsius, he added.

 With weather not relenting, team leader Swaraj Ghosh decided it was time to retreat. Though the expedition was not a success, the members have not lost hope and see the attempt as part of their learning curve.

 The attempt was important because the glacier is disintegrating. You cannot compete with nature. We are optimistic and are planning to climb Mount Kamet in the Himalayas, signed off Mukherjee.

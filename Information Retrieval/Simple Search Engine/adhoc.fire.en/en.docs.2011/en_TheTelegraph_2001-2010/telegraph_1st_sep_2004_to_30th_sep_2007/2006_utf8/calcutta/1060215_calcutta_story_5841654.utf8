 Virus cripples civic office

 - Tax 

 Collection drops at Gariahat branch 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Work in the Gariahat office of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has been severely affected since last week, following a suspected virus attack on the computers. As a fallout of the technical breakdown, assessment hearings, collection of revenue, adjustment of dues, approval of demand notices and generation of licence and tax bills have remained suspended.

 Taxpayers are being turned away by the employees, who are not sure when the problem will be fixed. The virus has reportedly spread to all 30 computers in the office.

 A senior officer claimed that the virus is even affecting the functioning of the cellphones in the vicinity of the computers.

 ?All of a sudden, the computers are hanging for about 30 minutes, before starting to function again. The machines are also refusing to accept our commands,? said a collection officer.

 The average daily collection at the office has come down from Rs 50 lakh to a few lakhs only.

 Leader of Opposition in the civic body Javed Ahmed Khan said the CMC should put up a notice to avoid harassment of people due to the problem. 

 ?We have informed IBM, the manufacturer of the machines, since the problem has cropped up within the warranty period,? stated deputy municipal commissioner Nandan Roy.

 The civic authorities recently spent Rs 50 lakh on making the Gariahat office a part of the civic computer network. The virus has not spread to the computers in the headquarters and other civic offices. 

 A defalcation case to the tune of Rs 20 crore by manipulating computer data had been perpetrated in the Gariahat office. The civic authorities and the detective department are yet to bust the case.

 Former municipal commissioner Asim Barman started computerisation in the CMC in the mid-90s. He had installed over 200 PCs and more than a dozen servers, along with a relational database management system. In 1999, Tata Consultancy Services and Management and Computer Consultant were entrusted with the responsibility of checking whether the set-up was adequately protected against the Y2K problem.

 Civic revenue earning has since grown by over 40 per cent. But lack of maintenance and upgrade has made much of the hardware and software obsolete.

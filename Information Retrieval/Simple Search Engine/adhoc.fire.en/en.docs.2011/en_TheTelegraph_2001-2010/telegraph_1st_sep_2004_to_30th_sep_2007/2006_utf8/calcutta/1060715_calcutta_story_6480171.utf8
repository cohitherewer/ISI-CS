 Fatal jump off office building

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man in his mid-40s committed suicide by jumping off the fifth floor of Yogayog Bhawan on Friday afternoon. His fell on the eastern flank of CR Avenue and died on the spot.

 Police later identified the man as Jayanta Das, a resident of Titagarh, in North 24-Parganas, on the basis of an office identity card found on him.

 ?The identity card shows he was an employee of the Panihati telephone exchange. No suicide note was found,? said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 After conducting a preliminary investigation, police said Das had entered the building with the intention of committing suicide. ?We spoke to all employees at Yogayog Bhawan. None could remember having seen him in the building,? said an officer of Bowbazar police station.

 Witnesses said the incident occurred around 4 pm. As part of a scheduled agitation, the employees were then picketing at the main gate of the building.

 ?Suddenly, I heard a thud and turned around. A man was lying on the thoroughfare. I had no clue how to react. He was restless for a few seconds and then became still,? said Ayan Halder, a pedestrian.

 Prakas Shaw, who lives on the pavement in front of Yogayog Bhawan, said: ?His head was badly injured. I and some others rushed to the spot, but he was dead by then.?

 A traffic constable on duty a few feet away informed Bowbazar police station.

 Police said the window on the fifth floor through which Das jumped had no iron bars. ?We have not come across any evidence of foul play,? said an officer.

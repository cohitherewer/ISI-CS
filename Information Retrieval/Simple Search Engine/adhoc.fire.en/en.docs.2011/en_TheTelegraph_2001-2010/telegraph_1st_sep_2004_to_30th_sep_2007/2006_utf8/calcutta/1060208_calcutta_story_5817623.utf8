 The 36-year-old had persevered through 42.195 gruelling km of cruel concrete to emerge champion. The news of his victory proved too much for his father, who died of a heart attack. Winner of The Telegraph Kolkata Marathon 2005, Bimal Mahato swore never to run again. Much counselling later, the Railway Police Force employee ran the New York Marathon, where he secured 66th place and was the second among Asian runners.

 That?s the story of a champion runner. The search for the next Bimal Mahato will be flagged off on the morning of February 19 on Red Road, with The Telegraph Marathon 2006 sporting bigger prizes, more participants and a galaxy of stars.

 Organised in association with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Athletic Coaches Association of Bengal, the 2006 edition of the run boasts total prize money worth Rs 7.60 lakh, up from last year?s Rs 6.25 lakh. The winner of the main marathon gets Rs 2.4 lakh, while the 10.5 km ladies? event winner pockets Rs 60,000.

 The top three will have the chance to participate in international marathons. Besides, there will be prizes for the top 20 contestants and finishing medals and certificates for other participants.

 ?It?s a great effort, particularly to attract youngsters to sporting activity,? said hockey legend Gurbux Singh, at the meet to announce the marathon on Tuesday.

 To enable more entrants in the marathon movement, registration booths have been set up at Rabindra Sarobar, SAI complex (Salt Lake stadium) and Kennel Club, plus in Serampore, Barrackpore, Batkula and Muchisa.

 Success rate under review

 - New multiple-choice JEE format a stumbling block for HS students

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The state joint entrance examination (JEE) board is conducting a survey to figure out the comparative performance of students of various boards in this year?s tests.

 The move follows reports that multiple-choice questions, introduced this year, had helped ISC and CBSE students outshine their Higher Secondary (HS) counterparts.

 ?A preliminary review of the results suggests that the success rate in the JEE of ISC and CBSE students has gone up this year. We have started a survey to get a clearer picture,? said Abdur Rauf, an official of the JEE board.

 As part of the survey that started on Saturday, the board is distributing a questionnaire to successful students who are attending the counselling session for engineering courses at the Indian Museum auditorium. Similar forms will be distributed later to those who have qualified for medical studies.

 The students are being asked to write down, among other information, the names of their schools and the affiliating boards or councils.

 Government sources said ISC and CBSE students have fared better than their HS counterparts because they are used to multiple-choice questions, introduced by their affiliating bodies more than a decade ago.

 The HS council, on the other hand, is still continuing with subjective-type questions.

 ?CBSE and ISC students have performed better because they are more familiar with the multiple-choice format,? confirmed Jayanta Bagchi, who is attached to a private coaching centre.

 Of the 86 candidates from Bagchi?s institute who have cracked the medical entrance test, only 14 are from HS schools. The rest are from CBSE or ISC institutions.

 Officials in the education department have found out that till last year not more than 25 per cent of the students enrolled in engineering and medical courses were from ISC and CBSE schools.

 ?We won?t be surprised if we get more such students this year,? said Kisan Kejriwal, managing trustee of MCKV Institute of Engineering and Technology, a private college.

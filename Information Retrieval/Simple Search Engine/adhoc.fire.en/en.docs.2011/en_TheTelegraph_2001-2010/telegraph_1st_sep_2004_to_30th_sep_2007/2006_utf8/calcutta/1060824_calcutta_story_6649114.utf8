 There were no winners at the first round of The Telegraph School Awards 

 for Excellence 2006 held at Vidya Mandir on August 23. Nor 

 were there any contests in the run up to the prize-giving 

 ceremony. At the opening of the programme, Barry OBrien 

 aptly said that the School Awards were just an excuse 

 the idea was to come together, share, learn, feel humble 

 and feel motivated. A little later, when the young achievers, 

 their parents, teachers and friends stepped on stage, others 

 in the audience must have grasped the meaning in OBriens 

 words. 

 Presented by Adamas International School, the first round of the 10th edition of The Telegraph School Awards at the Moira Street venue saw awarding of certificates of merit and honour in various categories.

 The event began with a series of performances by school students. Debopam Banerjee of Akshar rendered the opening Rabindrasangeet, followed by a flute recital by Aratrika Mukherjee of Springdale High, Kalyani, and a Bryan Adams number by Ankit Agarwal of St Vincents High, Asansol. 

 Here are some of the young achievers who received an overwhelming ovation from the packed house for their undaunted spirit.

 Courage counts

 Among the numerous children who stepped on the dais to receive the honours, some were extra special. Opportunities had not coming knocking on their doors. And they had had to put up a fight at every step of life to hold on to their dreams. The Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for courage was given to three such youngsters at the ceremony. One of them was Arpan Basu, student of St Thomas Boys, Kidderpore.

 When Arpans father, the familys bread-winner, was diagnosed with throat cancer, Arpan had had to run from one government department to another to raise the money for his treatment. Despite surviving the throat operation, his father later died after a cardiac arrest. Fate had more ill luck in store for Arpan as his mother developed a kidney problem.

 Arpan took up a job with a BPO and continued working during his ISC examinations this year, which he passed with the help of his teachers and friends. The laurel he won on Wednesday wasnt of much consequence to him. What matters is the respect that I got. My dream is to grow to be the man my father had wanted me to be, the young man said confidently, adding that he would definitely reach out to people in need.

 The other achievers of the courage awards were Kazi Monirul Haque of Assembly of God Church and Rajiv Shekhar Pal from La Maternelle High. Since Kazi Moniruls father runs a small shop of old utensils, his school is sponsoring his education. Haque wants to be a heart surgeon. Rajivs high scores in exams are hardly a giveaway of the odds he faces in life. His father is a patient of Hodgkins Disease (a form of lymphatic cancer) and the family cannot afford his school fees. He gets a scholarship from school.

 Merit matters

 Sixteen meritorious youngsters from city and district schools won the scholarships this year. Two of them, Seikh Majarul Islam and Asif Kalam, are doctors in the making. Seikh Majarul of Arambagh ranked third in the medical joint entrance examinations this year and is studying at Medical College. His father, a day labourer, barely manages to make ends meet with the monthly Rs 2,200 he earns. Asif of Birbhum ranked fifth in JEE-Medical. His monthly academic expenses amount to Rs 2,000, whereas his irregular family income averages only Rs 1,800 a month. Undeterred by the financial problems, the duo is determined to make it through the medicine course.

 Some of the other awardees work part-time so that their families can survive. Sneha Shaw of Julien Day couldnt turn up at the ceremony as she had to rush her mother, a cancer patient, to hospital. The commerce topper in school gives tuition after her father passed away to afford her mothers treatment. Although blind and from a poor family, Joydeb Hansda of Kamalpur High School got 75.12 per cent in his Madhyamik. His mother earns Rs 1,200 a month working in a coal mine for the survival of the five-member family. Undaunted by his handicap, Joydeb gives tuitions to add to the family income and to continue his education.

 Best of the bunch

 The other award categories were A School That Cares, Best Maintained School, Best Academic Performance by schools, Academic Excellence by a student, Social Service, A School That Looks Beyond, Outstanding Talent, Best Sportsperson of the Year, Best All-Round Student and Best Extra-Curricular Performance by a school. The awards ceremony ended with the national anthem.

 The final round of The Telegraph 

 School Awards for Excellence will be held at the Science 

 City auditorium on August 26, 9.30 am onwards. Governor 

 Gopal Krishna Gandhi will attend the programme. Students 

 are expected to come in school uniforms.

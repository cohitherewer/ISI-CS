The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Purpose, process amp; people

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 Addressing the issue of individual and corporate skills is what a UK-based professional development company called Frontera aims to do in Calcutta. Keeping that in mind, it has decided to open its first office in South Asia in the city. 

 Sujit Basu, principal consultant of Frontera, a Calcutta-born British resident, felt this would be the perfect city in which to begin Frontera?s South Asian operations. 

 ?It is a cosmopolitan city that is constantly changing. Being born here, I know the city well, and I have many contacts here.?

 The main purpose of the firm is to ?align people, purpose and process to effectively help the corporates and the individuals to achieve their goals?. The company offers a wide spectrum of services to companies and individuals, ranging from ?Individual Organisational Performance? to ?Strategy of Government?. 

 Ravi Kumar, CEO of Frontera in India, stressed that corporate social responsibility was a central ethic, adding: ?People are not assets, cars are assets. People are people.?

 Basu laid great emphasis on his work overseas in the past in such places as Honduras and west Africa. Hilary Bolton, senior associate consultant, also felt that their experiences abroad had been invaluable to the company?s experience. Speaking of her time in a humanitarian organisation, she recalled: ?In many places, I was working in small villages, trying to draw potential out of people.? 

 One might expect for a company that largely exists in a corporate world that their ambitions would be to become a multi-national corporation themselves. Basu dismissed the notion, asserting that ?we do not want to become a big company. We are big in heart, not in size?. The company also expresses its wariness of homogenisation, stating that it has ?the potential to destroy the uniqueness of individuals and organisations in any corner of the world?.

 Basu concluded: ?I am still learning new things the whole time, it?s as much a process for us as it is for the people we are helping.?

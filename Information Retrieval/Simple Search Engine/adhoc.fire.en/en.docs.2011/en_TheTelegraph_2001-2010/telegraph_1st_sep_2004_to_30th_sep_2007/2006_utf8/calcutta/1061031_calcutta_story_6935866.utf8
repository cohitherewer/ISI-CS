 Prodding two of its supporters to court arrest, pledging not to interfere with the law and pressing for an internal probe to find out the real reason behind the attack on Prasenjit Ghosh the CPM machinery in Bally is working behind the scenes to put the harass-and- hit episode to rest.

 Kishu Bhaduri and Rana Ganguly, accused of beating up Prasenjit on October 26, walked into the Bally police station on Monday morning. Later, they were produced in Howrah Court where their bail pleas were rejected.

 Three other co-accused in the case Sudeb Guha, Rabi Bose and Shankar Maitra are still at large. We are searching for them, but they are not in the area, claimed a police officer.

 Initially, CPMs district leadership tried to protect the accused, but the leaders are now trying to distance themselves from the incident triggered by the harassment of Prasenjits wife Sharmistha at their GT Road home.

 According to the FIR filed with Bally police station, Krishnendu Halder, main accused in the case, would click Sharmistha on the sly besides sending her lewd text messages and harassing her with phone calls.

 Days after Prasenjit confronted Halder and told him to lay off, the 35-year-old engineer was assaulted by a gang of around 15, while being led to the local CPM office.

 We have told the administration to take strict action against the accused. They should not bother from which party the assailants are, said Sridip Bhattacharya, district committee secretary, CPM. For the past two days, Bhattacharya had refused to comment on the matter.

 The party has also constituted a three-member team to conduct a probe into what prompted the attack on Prasenjit. It will also look into the claim that he was targeted by some CPM leaders for having refused to buy building materials from them.

 Prasenjit, meanwhile, will return home from a private nursing home on Tuesday.

 Wife Sharmistha wants to carry on the fight against the local CPM supporters and meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in this regard. All the accused should be thrown out of the party so that police can take action against them, she said.

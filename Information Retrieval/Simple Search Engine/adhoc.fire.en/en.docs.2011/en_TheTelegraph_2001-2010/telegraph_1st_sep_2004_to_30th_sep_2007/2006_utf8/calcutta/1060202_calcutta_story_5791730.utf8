The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blair aid sought for angel

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Assuming that the efforts of Jessop Company to repair the angel atop Victoria Memorial are going to fail, activist Subhas Dutta has written to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, seeking the assistance of his office in this regard.

 Metro has accessed a copy of the letter, dated January 28, 2006. In it, Dutta said the ?environmental and structural degradation? of the Memorial had prompted him to file a case in Calcutta High Court, seeking its intervention.

 ?Two major problems have surfaced during the proceedings of the case. One of which is the leakage of rainwater in the monument. The other problem relates to the static bronze statue atop the main dome of the Memorial, which is causing serious damage to the structure,? the environmental activist wrote.

 He asserted that it would be impossible for the Memorial management to restore the angel?s mobility with the available infrastructure and expertise. 

 ?I, therefore, request you to take the necessary steps to explore the possibilities of extending expertise to overcome the problem, which will not only bring a smile to millions but will strengthen the friendship between India and the UK,? Dutta continued.

 To substantiate his assertion, he enclosed a number of newspaper clippings with the letter. The letter also contained a brief history of the monument, including how Lord Curzon, then viceroy of India, conceived its construction in 1901.

 King George V laid the foundation stone of the monument on January 4, 1904, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921. 

 ?I have e-mailed the letter and sent it by courier. Now, I am waiting for the reply,? Dutta said on Wednesday.

 He added that he would inform the high court about the letter to Blair. ?The high court is very anxious about the problem. It is unfortunate that the Memorial authorities, even after repeated directives from the court, are not making enough efforts to make the angel twirl again.? 

 The angel had stopped moving in 1991. According to Dutta: ?The Memorial authorities did not spend a single paisa to repair the defective ball bearings.?

 M.K. Bhattacharjee, a retired engineer of Jessop Company entrusted with the job of repairing the angel, had submitted a report before the court. He had opined that there was no short-cut to making the angel twirl.

 He suggested: ?It would be apt if the Memorial authorities arranges an open discussion, which might bring greater details about the technicalities to light.?

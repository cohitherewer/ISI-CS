 In sync with the theme, the evening

 in true Broadway style. Tracks from Broadway musicals and 

 Hollywood hits followed.

 While Usha Uthup enthralled the 

 audience with tracks like Heartbreak hotel, Big Spender 

 and Time Of My Life, Ishita Ganguly carried the mood forward 

 with Somewhere Over The Rainbow and Girls, Girls, Girls. 

 Anjum Katyals Dont Cry For Me Argentina and 

 Priscillas version of Cabaret were also hits with 

 the 550-plus crowd.

 Voiceover: It was a rare 

 evening that brought together so much talent on one stage. 

 My fascination for movies was a driving force behind this 

 musical evening, says Oindrilla Dutt of Open Doors.

 wake up to the concept of spas. It is also important that 

 the salons impart the right kind of spa treatments and hence 

 this workshop. We will be coming in from Indonesia every 

 two months for workshops. We want our customers to get the

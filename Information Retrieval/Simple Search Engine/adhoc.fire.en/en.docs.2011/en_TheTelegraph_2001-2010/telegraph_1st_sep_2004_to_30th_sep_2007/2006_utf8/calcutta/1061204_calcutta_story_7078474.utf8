 STATE OF THE GHAT: Filth and plastic waste swamp the banks of the Hooghly. A Telegraph picture

 An expert committee appointed by the high court has called for a ban on the use, storage and disposal of plastic on the Hooghly banks.

 We have identified plastic as a major source of pollution of the Hooghly, especially around ghats in greater Calcutta. So, a blanket ban has been imposed on plastic in the vicinity of the river, stated state environment secretary and committee chairman M.L. Meena. 

 A Union environment ministry report published last year showed that the water quality in the stretch of the river in and around the city has become poorer over the past two decades, despite nearly Rs 300 crore being spent under the Ganga Action Plan.

 The state pollution control board will soon forward the high court directive to the commissioner of Calcutta Police and the director-general of state police. The civic bodies concerned have been asked to keep bins at the ghats for disposal of non-plastic waste.

 Stringent action will be taken against those who violate the plastic ban, asserted Meena. Many government officials, however, feel that the ban will be difficult to implement with business establishments, parks and ferry ghats dotting the banks. 

 The results of a plastic ban at various public places and heritage addresses in the state are hardly encouraging, pointed out an official. 

 Tapas Ghatak, a member of the expert committee associated with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, stated: Arrangements have been made to collect flowers, plastic and other waste during major immersions. However, a great volume of waste is disposed of in the river on a number of other occasions.

 Another member of the committee, environmentalist Subhas Dutta said: The committee has decided to ask Calcutta Port Trust to ensure that the ships and barges docking at the port do not throw away plastic or other waste. 

 The civic bodies have also given a last chance to furnish information about their sewage disposal within three weeks, added Dutta. If the civic bodies do not respond by then, the matter will be reported to the high court.

 We are documenting the developments and the court will be apprised of them in detail, said member-convener of the panel and senior law officer in the environment department Biswajit Mukherjee.

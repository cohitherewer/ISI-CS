The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The write line

Stage On amp; Off

 Not only has English theatre in Calcutta sprouted many fresh branches in recent years, in the shape of new groups, but some of them have even embraced the writing of original drama ? a most welcome trend, because the one thing in which English theatre lags behind her regional sisters in India is new playwriting.

 The PlayMakers? debut, Death of a Godot, was written and directed by Bodhisatwa Dasgupta, a final-year undergraduate, and its youngest cast member is a college fresher. Considering their age, this reworking of Beckett?s classic threw up intriguing possibilities. By depicting Didi and Gogo as man and woman, Dasgupta pre-empted my pet concept for staging Godot, and it seemed to work.

 The near-simultaneous ?murder? of Pozzo and Godot presented a neat red herring, injecting an essential ingredient of suspense. A strong Christian allegory underlay the script: the tramps had been thrown out of their home, perhaps because they did some wrong, and need keys from Godot to re-enter. 

 Shion Guha (Didi), Ragini Ghosh (Gogo), Soumyajit Bhattacharya (Pozzo), Raka Sarkhel (Lucky) and Dasgupta himself (the Boy) did a good job of keeping us interested in potentially boring situations... What ruined the effect was the manic lighting, better suited to discos and ramp shows. 

 Stage-Addict is another group comprising mainly students. Its second regular production, Swap, is written and directed by Adwaita Das. Coincidentally, both Das and Dasgupta belong to the same class in university. Das?s play, though, does not rely on an earlier source. It explores the loss of love in four different couples, created by juxtaposing two pairs of lovers in public spaces, then switching partners to form two further pairs in private spaces, of live-in and marital relations.

 All four actors (Das, Tathagata Chowdhury, Anshuman Wanchu, Sreejita Biswas) hold a sustained level of performance, the veteran among them, Chowdhury, portraying his most believable roles to date... 

 Das reveals a knack for theatricality during the quick change in the dark and elsewhere, but her scenes with the older couples lose intensity toward the end by repetitiousness. However, the carefully chosen soundtrack of familiar songs adds to the impact.

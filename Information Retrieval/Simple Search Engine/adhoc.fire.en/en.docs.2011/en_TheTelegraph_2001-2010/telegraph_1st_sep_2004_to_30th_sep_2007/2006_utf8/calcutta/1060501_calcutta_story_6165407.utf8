 Rs 32-crore to revamp drainage

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 In an attempt to improve the drainage and sewerage system on the city?s northern fringes, the government has taken up a Rs 32-crore project, Trans Municipal, to refurbish the whole system.

 With financial assistance from the Centre under the National Urban Renewal Mission, the CMDA will implement the project in five municipalities ? Khardah, Panihati, North Dum Dum, Dum Dum and South Dum Dum. 

 ?We have already prepared a detailed project report and submitted it to the Union ministry of urban development, seeking funds. We are expecting to get the nod in a few months,?? CMDA officials said.

 The project will include cleaning up of choked drains, construction of covered drains, an underground drainage network, construction of concrete drains to replace the brick-built open drains and introduction of a modern sewerage system.

 The government?s decision came in the wake of several complaints from different municipalities in the past few months.

 The local residents complained of waterlogging and overflowing sewers, which made their surroundings dirty and were also responsible for many water-borne diseases and other health hazards. 

 After facing wrath from the Opposition parties and local residents, chairpersons of these five CPM municipalities urged the government to take up a comprehensive project to renovate the drainage system. 

 ?Instead of taking up individual projects, we have decided to renovate the drainage system of these five municipal areas, as they are adjacent to each other. Once the project is implemented, the problems will be alleviated,? a CMDA official said. 

 The master plan was prepared by the urban development department, which later engaged Consulting Engineering Services (CES) to prepare a detailed project report. 

 Expressing his satisfaction, South Dum Dum municipality chairman Srihir Bhattacharya said that though several projects were implemented to improve the drainage system in the city, nothing much had been done for the neighbouring areas like Dum Dum. ?We are happy that at last, the government has realised the problems prevailing here and taken up an initiative,? he said.

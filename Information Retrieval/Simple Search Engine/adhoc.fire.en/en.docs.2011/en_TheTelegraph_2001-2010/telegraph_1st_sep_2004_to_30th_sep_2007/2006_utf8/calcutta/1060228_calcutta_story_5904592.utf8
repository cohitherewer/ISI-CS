 Testing times in running a school

 Who says pressure is a companion of only students? Teachers and the school administration, too, have to suffer foreheads creased by crisis. And if the students can approach teachers, guardians and counsellors for advice, educationists have only their peer group to turn to. That is why a seminar on ?Crisis and communication management in an educational environment? drew principals and administrators in a body to Bengal Club in search of solutions. 

 Uma Mani, chief publisher, schools, opened the discussion on behalf of the organisers, Macmillan India. How does one keep children interested in books when television is becoming more and more interesting, she asked. 

 But the discussion soon veered to more concrete hurdles faced in running of a school. ?The student today is a customer and relationship marketing has become vital today in administering education institutions,? pointed out Professor Arup Chowdhury, associate dean, ICFAI Business School. 

 The situation is even more complex than in any other sector, as other than an internal customer ? the student ? there is also a powerful external customer ? the guardian ? who has to be kept satisfied, he added.

 The problems soon tumbled out of the cupboard on to the screen ? admission requests from VIPs, goons, ?half-educated? guardians (?infinitely more problematic than uneducated ones, who do not meddle?), medical emergencies, accidents, power cuts, negative media reports, unruly staffers...

 ?As March looms, there is a threat of students taking the ultimate course before or after the exams,? reminded J.K. Sen of Julien Day School, Ganganagar. 

 A candid reply came from Keya Sinha of Vivekananda Mission School, Joka, who faced such a tragedy on campus. ?Since then, I tell my students to compete with themselves, not with others in class.? 

 ?But what do we do with guardians who threaten suicide if their wards are not promoted?? a wail was heard from another corner, creating a light moment amid the serious brain-storming.

 Lack of information about a student?s background can be a bother. ?A boy in the primary section had forged his grades on the report card. It was only on probing that we came to know that his father had shut him out of the house all night after seeing his report last year,? recalled Mukta Nain of Birla High School, Boys.

 The evening was more about sharing notes than finding answers. ?At least, now we are talking amongst ourselves,? an educator pointed at the silver lining.

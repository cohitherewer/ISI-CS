 Institute set to air radio link

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute of India is all set to establish its community radio on its premises by the year-end. The project has received a central grant of Rs 60 lakh.

 The institute also plans to launch a captive TV station by next year.

 Community radios are the means to involve the masses. Our aim is to get local ideas and learn about the ground realities for our cinemas, explained institute director Swapan Mullick.

 The airwaves having been made a public property in the Supreme Court Declaration of 1995, the community radio has been permitted in most educational institutions, like Jamia Milia Islamia, Delhi, and Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. 

 In Calcutta, Gyanbani of Netaji Subhas Open University has been broadcasting educational programmes funded by IGNOU.

 Our station is expected to reach 25 km around the campus. We will broadcast a wide range of programmes, initially for four hours in the morning and evening, said Mullick.

 The programmes will be both informative and entertaining. They will cover local issues and events, including films and allied arts like theatre and music. Interactive sessions on films will also be aired for the students.

 For all this, we will be conducting a month-long workshop with various experts. By December, the studio, staff and equipment will be in place.

 The radio may also accommodate a few commercials, on the lines of FM channels, signed off Mullick.

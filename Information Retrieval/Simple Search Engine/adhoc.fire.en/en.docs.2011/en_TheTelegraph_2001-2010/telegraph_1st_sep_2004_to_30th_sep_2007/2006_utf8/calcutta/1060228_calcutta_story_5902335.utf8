 Timeout

 Coming as a breath of fresh air into the city?s usually solemn literary and artistic circles, the ongoing exhibition of selected cartoons by Mangesh Tendulkar also provides a welcome relief from the boredom and monotony of daily life. Tendulkar?s creations, that have appeared in Marathi newspapers and magazines, depict the vagaries and uncertainties of life in a manner that at once makes us look at the lighter side of life, eliciting spontaneous laughter. Full of amusing, humorous picture stories, his cartoons also reveal the various facets of human nature in a delightful way. Selected from his sketches that have been published over the years, the collection on show has been specially re-drawn by the cartoonist for this exhibition. Without any accompanying caption, the cartoons retain the timelessness of the messages conveyed and also allow viewers to explore various interpretations without any language barriers.

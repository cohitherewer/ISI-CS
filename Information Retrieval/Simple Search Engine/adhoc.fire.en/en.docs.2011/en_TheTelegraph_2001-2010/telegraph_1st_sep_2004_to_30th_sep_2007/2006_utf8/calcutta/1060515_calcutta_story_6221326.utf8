 The lush mangrove forests of the Sunderbans or the Indian wild dogs of Neora valley ? Calcuttans could do with a little more awareness on nature and wildlife.

 Sensing a certain apathy towards the environment and the need for focused scientific studies on nature, a city-based cardiac surgeon has gathered a few like-minded people from various fields to take a step in the right direction.

 Society for Environment Nature and Sustainable Ecosystems (Sense), the NGO formed by Dr Debal Sen, will work in three spheres ? scientific research, educating students on environment and nature conservation, and photography, publication and documentary films.

 ?Currently, we are conducting a survey on the Indian wild dog population in the Neora valley, Darjeeling. We will make a documentary on the Sunderbans and we are in the process of publishing a book on the mangrove forests of India,? says Sen, president of Sense and an avid wildlife photographer.

 Sense has a panel of around 15 members, comprising nature conservationists, scientists and senior forest officials. Actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty is its vice-president.

 The organisation will be formally launched on May 16 at Academy of Fine Arts, when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee unveils an exhibition of nature and wildlife photography. Tales from the Woods, the display sponsored by Indian Oil, will be on till May 22. The official website of Sense (www.sense.org) will also be launched on the occasion.

 ?It?s an ambitious venture and a lot depends on corporate funding,? stresses Sabyasachi. A keen wildlife photographer, seven of Feluda?s frames will be displayed at the exhibition.

 The organisation plans to bring out a monthly journal and conduct nature awareness camps for high school and undergraduate students. ?We will have scientists who will go to schools and colleges with multimedia presentations and talk about conservation,? adds Sen. The film on the Sunderbans will take a couple of years to get made, but Sen is thinking big for the journal. ?We want to make it something like an Indian Geographic.?

 ?I have decided to contribute by writing articles for the journal and also publishing my photographs, attending the awareness camps in schools and colleges, and also by being involved in the making of documentaries,? adds Sabyasachi.

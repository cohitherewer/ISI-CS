 HS answer script missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Higher Secondary physics answer script went missing from Hare School on Wednesday. It could not be traced till late at night.

 The incident comes close on the heels of an alleged leak of the mathematics paper of the Class VIII annual examination of the school. 

 Sources in Hare School said the invigilators discovered that the answer script was missing after the second half of the examination ended at 5 pm. The examinees, of Mohammed Ajan School, in Kidderpore, had left by then.

 Tests for physics, education, nutrition and business organisation and management were held on Wednesday.

 ?We cannot rule out the possibility of the answer paper being misplaced among scripts of the other subjects. We have told the school to first check all the answer script bundles thoroughly,? said West Bengal Higher Secondary Council secretary Debashis Sarkar. ?If the script cannot be traced even then, we will lodge an FIR with Jorasanko police station,? he added.

 Sarkar said the student could also have taken the answer script home.

 Oven that saves LPG

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcuttans will soon be able to tide over the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) crisis. Scientists at Jadavpur University are pooling their talent to devise technology that will scale down an LPG stove?s fuel consumption.

 The scientists engaged in the project are all experts in flame research. 

 The burners will be designed to consume much less fuel than an LPG oven does while cooking certain staple items, like rice and fish.

 ?Users will not only save on fuel, but will also spend much less time in the kitchen,? said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and member of the university?s executive council. 

 According to officials, the stove will benefit the middle class the most.

 Once the research is over, the university will tie up with an agency that has expertise in making LPG stoves on a mass scale. ?If the research is in the right direction, the new stoves will be available in 2007,? Biswas said. 

 Preliminary findings have revealed that a user of the new burner will save at least 15 per cent on fuel. 

 The efficiency of an LPG burner, experts say, is judged by the heat it generates. The new burners will generate the same intensity of heat required for cooking staple items in much less time, compared with the existing ovens.

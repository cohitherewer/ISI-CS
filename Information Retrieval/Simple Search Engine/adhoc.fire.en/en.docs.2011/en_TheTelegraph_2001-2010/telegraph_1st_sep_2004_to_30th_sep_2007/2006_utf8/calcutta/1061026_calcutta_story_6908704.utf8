Life

 When mum is 

 the only word

 Sushmita Gupta 

 writes about the lonely life of her three-year-old, denied 

 the benefit of social interaction and the affection of the 

 extended family, in the United Kingdom

 NON - RESIDENT 

 CALCUTTAN

 It is a lonely life for my three-year-old 

 in cold and dreary England. A life where he sees only his 

 mothers (often sullen) face all day, and his fathers 

 for at best a couple of hours before his bedtime. 

 The lack of interaction (that 

 encouraged us to put him in nursery at the age of two) made 

 him wary of friends who occasionally visited us, and cling 

 to his mother at all times. 

 It is a far cry from the life 

 a child normally has back home in India among doting grandparents, 

 uncles, aunts, cousins, neighbours and, of course, the all-important 

 mashi. 

 Oh, how I envy my sister-in-law 

 who has a child a year younger than mine. She is free to 

 work (and play) as long as she likes while her child is 

 secure in the company of his grandparents and his whole-time 

 nanny. 

 I, on the other hand, have had 

 to manage it all myself (with considerable inputs from my 

 husband) the entire childcare routine, of course, as well 

 as devising various ways of keeping him engaged all through 

 his waking hours. That entailed rescheduling all my activities 

 (like bathing, cooking, and some telly watching) around 

 his sleep times. 

 Things have improved during the 

 last four months, but before that it meant having my child 

 follow me around every minute of the day as repeated pleas 

 for him to sit and play with his toys fell on deaf ears. 

 Children here are constant companions 

 of their parents they have to be taken along on visits 

 to the supermarket, to the hairdressers and even to 

 the doctors. 

 I remember the time I had to take 

 my son along on a visit to the dentist. He screamed so loudly 

 when he thought the dentist was attacking his 

 mummy that I had to come away without being examined. Needless 

 to say, activities in which he cannot be included have been 

 out for the last three years.

 It has been an exhausting time, 

 and I have often lost patience or found the routine boring 

 especially when we have been cooped up indoors during the 

 long winters playing with those same toys day after day 

 and desperately trying to find new challenges. 

 At the same time, the experience 

 has been enriching and certainly fulfilling. I have been 

 witness to each and every developmental phase in the little 

 ones life, and together we have learnt and done so 

 much from reciting Bengali rhymes, racing cars, drawing 

 cards, playing with plasticine, and reading stories to learning 

 the alphabet and to count, playing in the park, and more 

 recently, watching cartoons on the telly. 

 We also occasionally cook, peg 

 the washing or mow the lawn together! We have had each other 

 for company 24x7, and I (and my husband) have invested more 

 time in him than I would have had I been a working parent 

 (as I certainly would have been) in India. 

 What is glaringly lacking is, 

 however, the benefit of social interaction, especially the 

 love and attention of the extended family. 

 My son remembers all the near 

 and dear ones he spent such an enjoyable time with on his 

 last visit to Calcutta, and one of his favourite activities 

 is to look through his photo albums where he takes pleasure 

 in identifying all his relatives; thanks to cheap call rates, 

 he also gets to hear their voices occasionally. 

 It is obvious where his roots 

 (and his loyalties) lie when on being offered chicken nuggets, 

 he says: Bowl-e kore muri aar sandesh khabo!

 Formerly a lecturer in a Calcutta 

 college, Sushmita now looks after her home and family in

 Black-out at theatre gala

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Incomplete lighting arrangements forced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to wait in the dark for more than an hour at the Nandan complex and held up the inauguration of the sixth Paschim Banga Natyamela on Thursday. The glitch played havoc with the performance schedules at Rabindra Sadan, Girish Mancha, Sisir Mancha and Madhusudan Mancha, with a section of stage personalities alleging neglect.

 Debashish Roychowdhury, director of one of the plays presented by Anya theatre, complained of total mismanagement at the venue of Natyamela, organised by Natya Akademi. The arrangements are ready days in advance during film festivals. Theatre is always neglected.

 Sukanto Roy, member-secretary of Natya Akademi, blamed the over-confident contractor for the goof-up. The agency, Sinha Electric, reportedly told Roy that the vehicle carrying the lights and equipment broke down on the EM Bypass. It took a lot of time to shift the consignment from one vehicle to another, explained Roy.

 The chief minister had arrived around 5.15 pm, recalled actor-director Saoli Mitra. After spending a while inside Nandan, he joined us in an open enclosure. The seniors sitting there, like Kumar Roy, Khaled Chowdhury and Ashok Mukhopadhyay, must have found it quite uncomfortable.

 Finally, a couple of floodlights were turned on and Bhattacharjee managed to deliver his inaugural speech. He apologised for the delay and asked the organisers to ensure that such goof-ups are not repeated.

 On Friday, Roy said more lights have been given than asked for.

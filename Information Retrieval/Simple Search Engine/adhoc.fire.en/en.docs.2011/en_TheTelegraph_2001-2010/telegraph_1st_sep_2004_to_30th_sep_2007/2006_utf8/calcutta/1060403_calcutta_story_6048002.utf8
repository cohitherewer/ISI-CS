 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work by Samindranath Majumdar

 Large areas of grey washed with white or buff, in which glow patches of ochre or buff, form the backdrops of the canvases of Samindranath Majumdar on display at Akar Prakar. He was trained at Rabindra Bharati

 The artist, in his late 30s, uses either spirit or water to wash his canvases so that the acrylic drips down, making its mark all the way.

 Majumdar could be depicting a landscape or cloud formations but one does not have to scrutinise the canvases to discover calligraphic scrawls or stelae ? they are distinct enough. 

 Or else, there is a tiny human figure floating in the void and imprints taken of sheets of ribbed plastic sheets.

 Perhaps in reaction to his famous forebear, Majumdar eschews the figurative in favour of the abstract. One can easily detect shades of Gaitonde and Ram Kumar, two of his favourite artists, in his canvases. 

 Perhaps it is too early to expect this artist to develop the intense sense of contemplation, and it would not be exaggerated to say meditation, that set apart the works of these two senior artists. But Majumdar has years ahead of him and he still has hope.

 In two canvases, he replaces the stelae with milstones. But the effect of isolation and loneliness created by the vast spaces of misty grey is inescapable. 

 Although at times Majumdar is stifled by the masters of Indian contemporary art, he comes into his own in his paper work.

 These are smaller works and here, Majumdar creates a dialogue among various forms. Contrasts come into sharp focus when he dissolves conti in water and juxtaposes light with areas of darkness.

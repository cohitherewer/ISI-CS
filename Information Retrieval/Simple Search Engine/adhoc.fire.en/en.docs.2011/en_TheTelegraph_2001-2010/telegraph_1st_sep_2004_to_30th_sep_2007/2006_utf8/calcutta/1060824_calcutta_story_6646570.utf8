 Biotech park push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A big push is being planned to realise Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees dream of making Bengal a biotechnology hub.

 Calcutta University is setting up a biotechnology park in Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city. Last week, the university signed an MoU with the California-based KPC group for the proposed park on a 77-acre plot. The KPC group is also setting up a private medical college and hospital in Jadavpur by 2008.

 The project is likely to involve an investment of over Rs 200 crore. The KPC group will take care of the funding while the university will provide land.

 The initial formalities are over, now we will start creating the infrastructure, said Calcutta University vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee.

 From drug development and disease diagnosis to research on bio-fertilisers and bio-insecticides, the university plans to make the park a hub for research and development in the field of biotechnology.

 Initially, 30 acres have been allotted for the project, to be scaled up later. Once the first two phases of the park become operational, we will acquire more land outside our existing campus for the next phase, added the vice-chancellor.

 According to vice-chancellor Banerjee, a number of companies, both local and global, had shown interest in the park offering industry-academia interaction and promoting knowledge sharing.

 In a bid to draw investments in the field of biotechnology, the Bengal government had framed a biotechnology policy in 2002 and gave the sector special status.

 But investors like Biocon, Dr Reddys Laboratory and other top players stayed away from the state and preferred Shapoorji Pallonji Biotech Park and ICICI Knowledge Park in Hyderabad, International Biotech Park in Pune, Lucknow Biotech Park and Ticel Biotech Park in Chennai.

 That could change in the near future. The government is setting up another park at Kharagpur, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology at a cost of Rs 100 crore.

 Biotech companies prefer zones, instead of separate units. Besides, proximity to a university or an academic institute adds to the zones attractiveness. So, the biotechnology parks in the state are bound to attract major players, summed up Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, Indian Chamber of Commerce.

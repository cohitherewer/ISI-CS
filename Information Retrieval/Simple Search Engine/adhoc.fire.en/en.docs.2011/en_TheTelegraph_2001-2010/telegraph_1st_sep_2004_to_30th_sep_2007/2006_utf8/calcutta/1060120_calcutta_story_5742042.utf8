 Loans for fertility services 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 For couples craving a baby but who cannot think of visiting a fertility clinic because of the costs involved, there seems to be hope in the offing.

 Genome, the fertility clinic of Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre, has tied up with HSBC Bank to offer personal loans to couples planning to have a baby using the latest developments in the field of reproductive health.

 Patients, according to Yenten Lama, CEO of HSBC (Eastern India), will be offered the loan at the rate of 14 per cent interest. For a cycle of in-vitro fertilisation ? which involves removing eggs from a woman, fertilising them with sperm in the laboratory and then transferring the fertilised eggs to the uterus a few days later ? Genome will charge Rs 30,000, apart from the medicinal costs. 

 ?The essence of the clinic lies in extending quality international standard service at a reasonable price,? claimed Madhu Neotia, adding that Genome has tied up with Herzliya Medical Center (HMC) of Israel, arguably one of the top-line fertility clinics in the world. 

 The clinic will receive technology and guidance on clinical management and even man-power training from the HMC. 

 Genome has tied up with major pharmaceutical companies of international repute to ensure the best medicare. 

 ?Even as the finishing touches are being given to the clinic, we have already had four success stories. One of the USPs is pre-implantation genetic counselling, whereby we can pick up a few cells and scan them for genetic aberrations,? claimed Rohit Gutgutia, a senior consultant with Genome.

 Focus on teacher stress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 It is as important for teachers to remain stress-free in the classroom as it is for students, the ICSE schools have been told.

 Chairman of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations Neil OBrien on Monday advised the authorities of the schools to ensure that the teachers do not feel stressed in classrooms.

 According to the council chief, work pressure often pushes the teachers to punish students on the basis of circumstantial evidence. He asked the schools to take steps to prevent such incidences.

 We should not forget the stress our teachers, particularly the women teachers, have to deal with. The women teachers are often under tremendous pressure both at home and school. The schools must consider their problems, said OBrien.

 The council chief had addressed the issue at a national conference of principals of ICSE schools in the city last month. The heads of over 700 ICSE schools across India attended the meet.

 Explaining the adverse effects of unfair punishments, the council chief told the principals that teachers, under no circumstances, should punish a child without ascertaining his or her guilt.

 Asking a student to leave the classroom or to stand on a bench holding ears can cause mental trauma and humiliation. A student may not be able to bear the humiliation and can even take a drastic step. Every teacher must therefore be very careful while punishing a child, said OBrien.

 He had made a number of suggestions to the principals to lower the stress levels of the teachers. He advised the school administration to only take on teachers who can communicate well. Poor communication skills often lead to stress, stated OBrien. 

 He also felt that teachers under stress should consult a counsellor. They should also take time out for recreation and physical exercise.

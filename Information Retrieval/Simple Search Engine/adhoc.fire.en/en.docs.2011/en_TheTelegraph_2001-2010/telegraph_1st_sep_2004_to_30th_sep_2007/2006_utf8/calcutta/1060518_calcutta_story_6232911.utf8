 The colour of courage

 Perched on a stool on the Gol Park pavement every evening, she studiously applies mehendi on proffered palms for hours. Job done, she cycles back six km to her Gunomoni Safui Road home in Garfa, to her mother and two younger sisters, whom she supports.

 Courage is the colour that characterises 21-year-old Pritikana Hait. A student of a South Barasat college, she does a daily grind of 14 hours ? divided between books and mehendi sessions that earn her a maximum of Rs 60-100 a day ?only to ensure that her sisters and she can go on studying.

 ?My mother occasionally works as an ayah and does not have a fixed income. She had once decided to take my sisters out of school as she could not afford it,? recounts Pritikana, at the end of Tuesday evening?s mehendi session. ?I was told I could continue my studies if I could support myself. But how could I study while my sisters sat at home??

 Pritikana decided to put to use the skills she had picked from an assorted group on Rashbehari Avenue. ?A group of men would apply mehendi on the hands of passersby in front of Basanti Devi College. I would observe them carefully,? recounts the BA final-year student.

 Now, every day, she takes the 8.30 am local from Jadavpur station to south Barasat. Back home by 5 pm, she picks up her stuff and cycles all the way to Gol Park, where she sits near the Mouchak sweet shop with a table, two stools and a bunch of mehendi design books. She returns home after 10 pm.

 Pritikana?s skills ? and spirit ? have found quite a fan following, ?A young girl is not expected to earn this way. But I do not have an alternative. Some people tried to discourage me, but I have received full support from women, some of whom are my regular customers. Many say I am an inspiration for other girls. But I am just trying to meet the basic needs of my family,? she says.

 Despite it all, Pritikana?s dreams remain as colourful as ever ? a Master?s in English, researching various languages, pursuing photography, penning poetry and singing, and, above all, putting mehendi on the palms of Preity Zinta.

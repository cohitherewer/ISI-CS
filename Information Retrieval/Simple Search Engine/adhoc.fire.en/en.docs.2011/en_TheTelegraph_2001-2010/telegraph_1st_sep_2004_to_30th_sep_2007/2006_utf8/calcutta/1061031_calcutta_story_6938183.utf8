The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The capped all-rounder 

Screen On amp; Off

From producing serials to composing music, from singing 

his way to Wembley to starring in an autobiographical film, HIMESH RESHAMMIYA 

is doing it all, reports Sudeshna Banerjee from London 

 Himesh Reshammiya performs at Londons Wembley 

Arena along with the finalists of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005 on Sunday 

night

Himesh Reshammiya is turning actor. The music director 

who has broken all norms by consistently giving voice to his own compositions 

and beating established singers to the top of the charts and awards trophies, 

will be starring in a film called Aap Kaa Suroor, The Movie, based on his 

own life, of course.

And it promises to be right up there with Bollywoods 

mega-budget projects. If that is music to the ears of his fans, they can wear 

a bit of Himesh too as a fashion label is also being launched in his name. The 

music director chose Londons Wembley Arena to make the announcement on Sunday 

night, which took the huge concert crowd by surprise.

The two-hour film featuring him as HR is being directed 

by Prashant Chadha, who has done all his music videos, and will be produced by 

Vijay Taneja, who has invested in films like Hum Ko Tumse Pyar Hai and 

Yeh to Hona Hi Tha.

The film will answer all the questions people have 

been asking why I wear the cap, why I never smile, why is there so much pain 

in my songs, why the girls always leave me in the music videos It will deal with 

the enigma that I am, declared Himesh, standing on a stage that had hosted Tom 

Jones 24 hours before him and will have Christina Aguilera rocking next week. 

After all, for whatever it is worth, Himesh is being projected as the first Indian 

rockstar on his UK sojourn that follows his 18-city US tour.

Aap Kaa Surroor, The Movie will revolve around 

the real luv (sic) story of the man. But it will be a fast-paced dramatic thriller, 

not boring, promised the nasal singer, back at the Wembley Plaza hotel after 

a high-decibel performance. I am not playing a Jaggudada ya don. It will 

just be me, he added.

Prashant Chadha, the director, explained that the 

composer-singers love story had been dramatised so that it follows the classic 

Act I-Act II-Act III pattern. The biggest draw of the film would be nine new 

tracks that the capped composer claimed would be his best work.

Aap Kaa Surroor, The Movie, eyeing a June 2007 

release, will straddle continents as the songs would be shot in different countries. 

The film will feature a world tour and one sequence will be a concert. But we 

will recreate that experience and not use archival footage. So that would involve 

a lot of money, said Chadha. Two fresh female faces would be introduced as eye 

candies.

Himesh would not need any workshop. He is a very 

quick learner. Once you tell him what he needs to do, he gets it in a flash. We 

will at best have a line-reading session with everyone, said Chadha.

On the fashion front, Himesh has joined hands with 

Kishore Biyanis Future Group to launch a brand called Mega Music Movement (M3). 

The labels would be available under Suroor, Jhalak, Aashiq and Jhoom, key words 

in Himesh hit songs, at Big Bazaar.

I owe it to my young fans, said Himesh. The other 

initiative from this combination would be eight branches of a Himesh Reshammiya 

School of Music, across four metros. 

It will have 10 departments on rock, sufi-rock, jazz, 

classical, symphony and even club mixes. There is need of talent in the industry 

today. No longer shall two or three names rule for 25 years. The launch happens 

in Calcutta in two months as Himesh, an RD admirer, loves Bengal music.

But wont all this give his critics much more to aim 

their pot shots at? Himesh, on a high, does not really care. When I started producing 

serials at the age of 16, people said yeh ladka kya karega? Andaz became 

a huge hit on Zee TV... When I started singing, they laughed me off. I produced 

36 hits and people started taking me seriously. Apna mazaak banane ke liye 

main music industry mein nahin ayah hoon.

If there is more of Himesh on these fronts, there 

will be less of him in another. Himesh will cut down on the number of films he 

would compose for to two-three projects a year, other than cutting a solo album. 

Himesh Reshammiya should not be available to everyone, he declared, with composer 

father Vipin Reshammiya standing by him.

Life

 Look, shes young again

 Three days back, her three-year-old son asked her: Are you on TV everyday? Thats when he realised that the reason his schoolmates flock around her is not because she is his mom but because she is Smriti Irani. Or as Smriti would like to say herself: Im Tulsi Virani of STAR Plus.

 But come August 19 and she would love to be re-christened Uma, the character she is playing in the new weekend serial on STAR Plus Thodi Si Zameen, Thoda Sa Aasman. And she is also playing a new role behind the camera producing the prime-time (10.30 pm) show along with friend Ektaa Kapoor.

 Everybody is asking me why doesnt the serial start with a K, laughs Smriti, sipping her coffee at The Oberoi Grand conference room on Friday. The reason I call it Thodi Si Zameen is because of the family roots of the character and the reason I call it Thodi Sa Aasman is because the girl has the freedom to have a dream. Girls coming from middle-class families tend to get caught up in their jobs and lose their dreams. Umas roots give her the wings to fly.

 Getting into production was a natural progression for Smriti who has always been involved in the making of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, apart from heading the cast. Its just that I am getting the tag of a producer this time, she smiles. The reason I got into production full-time is because it is a good area to grow. I hate stagnation, basking in the glory of fame. Production is a new everyday adventure that allows me to explore new associations and maintain old ties.

 But balancing the twin roles of acting and producing has been nerve-wracking, admits Smriti. Producers and actors have never been open to each other; there are too many layers in the relationship. So I have tried to retain the trust of my acting colleagues. That doesnt mean I have only cast friends in my serial. I have never met Harsh Chhaya before but I felt he was suitable for the role and I cast him. I have to keep my interests protected too.

 Rubbishing reports and rumours that Jackie Shroff was playing the lead of Thodi Si opposite her as a figment of imagination, Smriti says: The only person I ever thought of in that role was Kiran Karmarkar. And he is doing the serial. But I dont know whether you can term the relationship that Uma and his character share as romantic. She is not interested in falling in love or getting married. Her priorities in life are very different, of supporting her family and chasing her dreams of higher education.

 The backdrop of a typical Mumbai chawl mostly occupied by mill workers has ensured that Thodi Si isnt reeking of opulence like any other Ektaa Kapoor production. But please dont call it real or people will confuse the serial with the grainy Shyam Benegal films of the 70s, announces Smriti. Its just that we are experimenting with the shot-taking and production design. It will be a very different visual design.

 Even Uma is nothing like Tulsi or even Smriti for that matter. I am not as passive as Uma, the actress-turned-politician claims. Uma is not revolutionary and would laugh off the problems unlike Tulsi who would challenge them. The directors on Thodi Si would keep coming up to me and ask me to get the depth out of my eyes because Uma is so much more restrained.

 But Smriti is fully aware that it is as Tulsi Virani that she still calls the shots on the small screen. Seeing me in white hair must have been shocking but still Kyunki is the number one show on TV, she says with an air of arrogance about her. In a day and age when only youth-based shows work, here you have a 65-year-old protagonist. That only means that the audience has enough adaptability to accept the concept.

 Having initially planned 52 episodes of Thodi Si, Smriti is continuing her histrionics on stage. The theatre actor in me has also been recognised with our play Kuch Tum Kaho Kuch Hum Kahein being invited at the Sky Festival in Manchester, says the BJP member, leaving for the UK next week.

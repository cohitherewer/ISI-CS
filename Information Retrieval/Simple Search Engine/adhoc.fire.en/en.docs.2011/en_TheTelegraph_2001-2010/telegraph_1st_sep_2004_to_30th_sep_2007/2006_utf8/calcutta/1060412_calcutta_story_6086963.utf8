 Psycho held in station

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 An unidentified killer, who had struck terror in Howrah station for three months, was finally nabbed by Howrah Government Railway Police (GRP) on Monday night.

 The psychopath had killed two hawkers and seriously injured a third within a span of less than a month on the station premises.

 He struck first in mid-December last year, when he killed Tapas Ghosh on platform 7 in the old complex of the station. Within a few days, he tried to kill Sonu Choudhury. 

 He struck again in early January and killed Raju Das, whose mutilated body was found on platform 1 of the same complex.

 The killer used to smash the heads of his victims almost beyond recognition with large chunks of concrete. Thereafter, he hacked their bodies with an ice hook.

 These killings forced the GRP to set up a special team exclusively for dealing with the mysterious killer.

 ?Our team laid a trap and arrested the killer, Gopal Chakraborty, in front of Howrah General Post Office last night. He confessed to killing Tapas and Raju and making an attempt on the life of Sonu,? said Taj Mohammad, inspector-in-charge of Howrah GRP station.

 The GRP team had no doubt that one man was behind all three cases, said the officer on the special team. 

 ?The smashed heads, the injuries all over the body caused by the hook ? all were pointers to that,? he said. 

 The team was also sure that the killer was a psychopath, his signature being a dead giveaway.

 All the victims were hawkers. They were friends, who spent the night on the platform and had a common enemy. Gopal admitted that they had betrayed him to the police.

 In the past, he had been jailed for various crimes, including theft, snatching, dacoity, murder and rape. 

 He was wanted by the Howrah GRP and Golabari police station.

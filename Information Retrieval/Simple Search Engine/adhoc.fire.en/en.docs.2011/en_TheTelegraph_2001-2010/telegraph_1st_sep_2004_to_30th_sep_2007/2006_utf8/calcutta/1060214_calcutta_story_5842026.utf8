 Bill peril hangs over wetlands

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The East Calcutta Wetlands could be struck off the Ramsar list if the state government fails to retain the character of the entire watery sprawl.

 The environment department is pushing a bill in the Assembly, which includes certain stretches of the wetlands within the ?urban/ rural settlement? area, thereby altering their character. Land and land reforms minister Abdul Rezzak Mollah has alleged that the alteration has been allowed to facilitate the execution of two ?blacklisted? real estate projects. 

 ?There are certain criteria for qualifying for the Ramsar tag. The government cannot slice off pieces of wetlands and change them into settlements,? said an official of Creative Research Group, which prepared a ?baseline document? of wetlands in 2000. 

 ?The Ramsar status for Chilika Lake was withdrawn because the character of the waterbody had changed. It was re-listed only after the character was restored. If the Calcutta wetlands meet a similar fate, the government, especially the environment department, will be held responsible,? he added.

 The World Wildlife Fund (India) has warned that it will report the government?s attempt to alter the wetlands? character to the Ramsar Bureau. ?We?ll write to the Ramsar Bureau,? said Colonel Shakti Ranjan Banerjee, state director of the Fund.

 ?Environment secretary Asim Barman emphatically told us that no project would be allowed on the wetlands. The government is going back on its commitment,? alleged Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC, which had filed a PIL in Calcutta High Court, prompting Justice Umesh Chandra Banerjee to declare the area a wastewater recycling region in 1992 and ban all development work there.

 Kakkar claimed that environment department officials had assured her that inclusion of dag nos 771, 772, 773, 774 and 775 in Dhapa Manpur mouza within the ?settlement? zone was an error and that amendments would be made before the East Calcutta Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Bill was tabled in the Assembly. The bill, however, has been introduced unaltered.

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said on Monday that minister Mollah?s allegations, submitted to him in writing, would be discussed and a decision taken.

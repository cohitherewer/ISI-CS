The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pitching for youth power

 Young Metro

 Surveys indicate that around 52 

 per cent of the Indian population is below the age of 25. 

 Directors of many big companies in the country have an average 

 age of 45. Each section of the Indian youth, such as teenagers 

 from schools, college-goers, B-school students and young 

 executives in corporates, have different aspirations and 

 hold varied opinions. Yet, they all have a major role to 

 play in shaping the country?s future.

 AIESEC in Calcutta has been hosting 

 a series of debates for the past four months under the banner 

 Yuva: The Power of the Youth. An initiative in association 

 with The Telegraph, it aims to bring together the 

 different sections of youth on one platform.

 The first phase of Yuva kicked 

 off at Kala Kunj on April 22 with an inter-school debate. 

 Over 300 students from 12 schools participated. Two best 

 debaters were selected.

 The second phase was an inter-college 

 debate at St Xavier?s College auditorium on May 6. Around 

 450 students witnessed 10 teams from eight colleges fight 

 it out for the top two places.

 Now, it is the turn of B-schools 

 to join the fray in the third phase of Yuva at Rotary Sadan 

 on July 25. Two best participants will be selected at this 

 meet as well.

 The six debaters, two from each 

 phase, will finally come face-to-face in The Big Fight at 

 Kala Mandir on July 28. The cross-section of the young populace 

 will have a war of words on a range of issues.

 Wrapping up the youth festival 

 will be Corporate Careers 2006 on July 29 at Hotel Hindusthan 

 International, in which companies will interact with students 

 of colleges and B-schools. Workshops on ?Communication and 

 Business Ethics? will be held for 80 select participants.

 The young contestants in the final 

 round of Boogie Woogie, held at Aquatica on July 1, were 

 a big hit with the audience. The elimination rounds have 

 been on for almost a month. The semi-finals were held at 

 Gyan Manch and Aquatica.

 The panel of judges for the finals 

 included Naved Jafferi. Principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls? 

 School Malini Bhagat was the chief guest. She had judged 

 the semi-final round as well.

 More than 200 dancers took part 

 in the categories of group, duet and solo. Six-year-old 

 Manshi Jerajani won over the crowd matching steps to Kajra 

 re, while Sourav and Santanu performed to Jhalak 

 dikhlaja.

 Tagore tribute

 Uma Mukherjee Memorial School 

 celebrated Rabindra Jayanti on June 16. The school, started 

 for underprivileged children, is located in a relatively 

 backward area of Narendrapur.

 The song-and-dance programme was 

 a success, courtesy the cooperation of the villagers of 

 Ukhila and the enthusiasm of the youngsters, who put in 

 long practice sessions. The participating students were 

 given story books at the end of the function. The sultry 

 afternoon seemed more radiant by their beaming faces.

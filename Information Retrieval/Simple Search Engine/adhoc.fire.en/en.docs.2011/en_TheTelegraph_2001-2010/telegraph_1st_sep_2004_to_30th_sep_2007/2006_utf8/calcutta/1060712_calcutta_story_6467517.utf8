Here she goes again

 Rituparna Sengupta has hit the Arabian Sea, full throttle. Her act as the beautiful wife of Rajpal Yadav in Main Meri Patni Aur Woh has added inches to her stature in Bollywood even fetching her an action film worth watching out for. Manish Gupta, scriptwriter for Ram Gopal Varma?s D, Sakar and James, has signed on Rituparna for his directorial venture Saab Chai Pani? ? an oblique reference to bribe culture.

 After looking a Lucknawi bride in Chandan Arora?s Main Meri?, Rituparna is switching to a Marathi woman living in a Mumbai chawl in Saab?. The film revolves around a good cop succumbing to social pressures and turning bad, with Rituparna playing wife to main man Sonu Sood. The cast also features Om Puri, Mukesh Rishi and Goga Kapoor.

 ?I liked Rituparna and her acting in Main Meri Patni Aur Woh, and I think she will fit the character in my film very well,? Gupta told Metro. Having turned director with Darna Zaroori Hai with Varma?s Factory, Gupta is now awaiting the November release of Hostel, starring Vatsal Seth and Tulip Joshi.

 ?Saab Chai Pani? is about how a cop turns corrupt succumbing to the pressures at home and what happens to him then. Rituparna?s character wants to get out of her world and step into high society; she dislikes the fact that her husband can?t afford it. But when they do get rich, she doesn?t like the way her husband is making the money. She?s also afraid of being targeted by his enemies, and that is what happens at the end. I am showing how professional life impacts marital life and vice versa.?

 For Rituparna, Saab Chai Pani? adds variety to her Bollywood bag. ?I have done a romantic comedy like Main Meri? and a romantic film like Unns which will be releasing soon. Saab Chai Pani? is a serious action film. I want to work on different subjects,? Rituparna said from Mysore, where she is shooting with Mithun Chakraborty for an untitled Swapan Saha film.

 On picking this project she said: ?I have a solo lead in Saab Chai Pani? and I also liked the fact that Manish worked with Ram Gopal Varma like Chandan Arora. So I guess their schooling would be similar.?

 As for the character, there?s a lot of opportunity for ?sensitive acting?, she felt. ?There are lots of crosscurrents in her. She is ambitious and straightforward, but at the same time can?t accept certain things about her husband. She is torn between her personal desires and social values,? explained Rituparna.

 Though Manish has started shooting, Rituparna joins the cast and crew in Mumbai from July 13. Meanwhile, she?s busy working for the Swapan Saha potboiler. ?Let?s see how the combination of Mithun, Rituparna and Swapan Saha works... I have a parallel role opposite Mithun in this film,? she said.

 And what more in Mumbai? ?Well, talks are on for an Anees Bazmi film but things are yet to be finalised,? replied Rituparna, before rushing off for a shot.

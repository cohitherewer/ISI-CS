The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 boys to men

 - first look

 From packing a punch to tickling your funny bone, Vikram Chopra?s directorial debut Fight Club tries to get the balance right in this all-action fare. Although there are glamourous girls for eye candy, the film has an entire line-up of guys ? Sohali Khan, Dino Morea, Riteish, Zayed Khan, Ashish Chaudhury, Ashmit Patel and Suniel Shetty ? trying to match each other, muscle for muscle. Fight Club releases January 26 at a theatre near you.

 A 

 Thought For Food

 Guests at the cake-mixing 

 ceremony at The Peerless Inn. Picture by Rashbehari 

 Das 

 What: Cake-mixing ceremony. 

 Where: Ego, The Peerless Inn.

 When: November 14.

 Take a look: Chefs at The Peerless Inn got together 

 with some directors, in town for the film festival, for 

 the cake-mixing ceremony, said to be a harbinger of good 

 tidings and happiness.

 The cake mixture comprised dry 

 fruits like raisins, glazed red cherries, orange peel, tutti-frutti, 

 dates, dried apricots, figs and a few imported goodies like 

 prunes and black currants from the UK. 

 Golden syrup, honey, molasses 

 and vanilla essence were poured in while a number of gloved 

 hands stirred the concoction tirelessly. The 40-kg mixture 

 will be marinated for a month in liquor, brandy, rum and 

 other spirits together with flavouring agents and taste-makers. 

 Fruitcake sans alcohol will also be offered along with the 

 traditional plum cake.

 Voiceover: The tradition dates back to the 17th 

 century in the UK, when all members of the family would 

 stir the cake mixture to participate in the month of joyous 

 celebration, explained Rahul Bhattacharjee, executive 

 chef of the hotel.

 Chocolatey

 What: Launch of revised menu at Choco-larte.

 Where: 31 Judges Court Road, Rajhans-Rajshree Apartments.

 When: November 10. 

 The spread: Choco-larte, a vegetarian confectionery 

 boutique, is just two months old, but it all began three 

 long years ago when Seema Keyal decided to convert 

 her childhood passion to serious business by 

 setting up a homely baking workshop.

 Cookies, brownies, chocolates, 

 fudges, cakes, footlongs, breads, snacks Choco-larte menu 

 reads all this and more. It specialises in cakes. Choose 

 from chocolate to cheese, from fun birthday shapes to a 

 fancy three-tier wedding wow. 

 There are six varieties of breads 

 and four types of sauces in the footlongs section. Drive-in 

 facilities are offered too, and very soon, Choco-larte will 

 also be serving chai with samosa. Seema also 

 runs Choco-larte The Class at 8 Alipore Avenue, where 

 she teaches the tricks of her trade.

 Pocket pinch: Prices begin from Rs 5 for cookies, pastries 

 are priced at Rs 15-plus and cakes on order start from Rs 

 160 per lb.

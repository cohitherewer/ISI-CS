 Goa tops Puja list

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Goa is the most preferred Puja holiday destination of Calcuttans this year, a recent survey has revealed. Bangkok and Malaysia are the top choices abroad.

 Fairfest Media, which has organised Travel and Tourism Fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium from Saturday to Monday, conducted the survey. It also found that 86 per cent of the prospective Calcutta tourists are opting for domestic holidays; foreign shores beckon the rest. 

 Eighteen per cent of the domestic tourists will head for Goa this Puja or later in winter. Orissa (eight per cent) and Himachal Pradesh and Kerala (seven per cent each) occupy the second and third spots on the preference list. Sikkim, Rajasthan, Uttaranchal and north Bengal follow, with five per cent of domestic tourists rooting for each.

 Kashmir remains the holiday destination of choice of only a handful. ?The recent terrorist attack on tourists have had a severe impact in this region,? observed chairman and managing director of Fairfest Sanjiv Agarwal. 

 ?Daily flights, low airfare and affordable hotel tariffs, even by Indian standards, have made Bangkok, Malaysia and some other southeast Asian destinations popular among Calcuttans,? explained Agarwal. ?The trend of tourists from Calcutta going abroad started in the late 1990s and is picking up at a fast rate.? 

 Turbulent Nepal, too, is once again drawing tourists from eastern India. ?With peace being restored in the neighbouring country, the tourist flow has once again resumed,? said a city-based tour operator.

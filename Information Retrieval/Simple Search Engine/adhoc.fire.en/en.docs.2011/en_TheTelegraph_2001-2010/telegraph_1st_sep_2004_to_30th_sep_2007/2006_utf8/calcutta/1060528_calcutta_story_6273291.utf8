 The Calcutta Racket Club, off 

 Birla Planetarium, was established in 1793, and is perhaps 

 ?one of the oldest squash clubs? in the world. It boasts 

 seven squash courts of which two are glass-backed international 

 standard tournament courts with a large spectator gallery 

 that has come up recently.

 The other five courts came up 

 over a period of time after the establishment of the club 

 and are located in the main building. 

 The 95 JL Nehru Road address also 

 has a fully equipped air-conditioned gymnasium for the fitness-conscious 

 members of the club.

 If you think the name of the club 

 suggests a pun on the word racquet, you?re far from the 

 truth. ?The club is named after racket, the bird,? explains 

 vice-president Alok Maheshwari.

 ?It is a small and cosy place 

 to unwind after a hard day?s work. We have a very unique 

 member profile. The membership strength is around 550 out 

 of which more than 150 members are active squash players. 

 Each one on the court knows the other and they are quite 

 regular at the club? We do not have many female members 

 but we are definitely open to the idea of taking in more,? 

 adds Maheshwari.

 The Calcutta Racket Club is the 

 administrative headquarters of The West Bengal Squash Racquet 

 Association that is affiliated to the Squash Racket Federation 

 of India.

 The club plays host to all major 

 squash activities and training in eastern India. It was 

 also the first club to host the International Squash Championship 

 in 1990.

 Last September, The Calcutta Racket 

 Club hosted the US$ 20,000 Professional Squash Association 

 championship that drew players from 10 countries.

 The club is also a cradle for 

 future squash stars as the eastern region centre for the 

 National Junior Development Programme.

 ?More than 40 children are trained 

 at the club under our professional trainers. We are perhaps 

 the only club that gives memberships to children only and 

 in their names. The only condition is that they have to 

 be interested in squash. This is with an eye to the future. 

 The idea is to groom the next generation of squash enthusiasts,? 

 says Maheshwari.

 Besides squash, the one other 

 thing The Calcutta Racket Club is famous for is its fresh 

 lime soda. 

 ?We have a full-fledged bar. After 

 a game of squash there is a big queue in front of the bar, 

 not for any alcoholic beverage but a glass of fresh lime 

 soda,? smiles the club vice-president.

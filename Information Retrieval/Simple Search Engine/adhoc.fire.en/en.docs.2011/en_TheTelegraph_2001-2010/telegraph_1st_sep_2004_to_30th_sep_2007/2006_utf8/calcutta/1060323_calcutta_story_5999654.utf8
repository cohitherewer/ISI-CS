 Based on a play by Vladlen Dozortsev, Shesh Sakshatkaar makes an ironical comment on the nefarious, egotistical attitudes of the privileged class, for which the less fortunate are made to suffer. It tells the story of Dr Subhankar Karmakar, a well-known heart-surgeon, who decides to operate only on those patients who are sure to recover. He refuses surgery to a large number of patients, some of whom do not survive. The surgeon and his associate even consider these deaths justifiable for their own reputation. When Dr Karmakar is awarded the Padma Vibhushan and also becomes the state minister for health, these honours are considered welcome for the benefit of their hospital. But, when Mahasin, a patient, is cured by another doctor, the question arises whether other patients could have survived likewise. A young journalist who tries to get to the bottom of this issue, loses his job and is made an outcast. After five years, a stranger comes to meet the doctor accompanied by a frail, broken woman, seeking his resignation. Adaptation and direction: Rudraprasad Sengupta.

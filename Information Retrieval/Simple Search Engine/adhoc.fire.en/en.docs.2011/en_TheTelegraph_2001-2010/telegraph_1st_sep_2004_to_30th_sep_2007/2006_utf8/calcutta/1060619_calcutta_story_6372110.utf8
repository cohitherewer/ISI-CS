 More secrets: Madonna

 You can never have enough of Madonna as the pop icon keeps reinventing herself from time to time. After her last album Confessions On A Dance Floor debuted at number one in 29 countries ? in the middle of her highly-acclaimed Confessions Tour ? the Papa don?t preach star is now set to feature in a provocative documentary on her. 

 Having made musical history many times over and created quite a few flutters thanks to her much-publicised personal life, Madonna is set to raise a few more brows with the documentary titled I?m Going To Tell You A Secret. The film revolves around the singer-actress?s stunning and highly praised Reinvention Tour. Warner Brothers announced last week that the much-awaited documentary is scheduled to be released in June.

 Directed by Jonas Akerlund, the DVD/CD package contains spectacular performance footage of many of her major hits and also reveals Madonna?s intimate journey behind the scenes, with her touring family and real family as they go around the globe.

 Secret aims to give Madonna fans an insider?s view of the singer at work, beginning right from the dancers? auditions. Revealing the process of putting together an elaborate stage spectacle, the documentary also shows an up close and personal view of the artiste?s daily life. Apart from the on-the-road journey, the docu shows beautifully filmed sequences of the Material Girl performing some of her biggest hits including Like a prayer, Vogue, Music, Holiday and a profoundly moving version of the John Lennon hit Imagine.

 Telly stars: Iqbal Khan and Eijaz Khan from Kavyanjali

 This Monday will see a first on Indian television when the two popular STAR Plus shows Kavyanjali and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii weave into each other in a one-hour special episode at 7.30 pm.

 The episode will open with a lavish sangeet ceremony of Anjali, getting all ready to enter into a new and promising life with Shaurya. But destiny has something else in store for her. Even as she gets ready to enter a new phase of her life ? with the wishes of her close ones and special telly guests like Parvati , Pallavi, Kashish and Prerna ? Kavya returns to her life.

 Well, not exactly. It is guest Soham who is an absolute lookalike of Kavya. But that?s enough to throw Anjali?s marriage plans off track as she gets lost in a maze of memories. Here comes the twist as Parvati, who has been invited by Anjali for her sangeet, is passed on a vital piece of information that leaves her shocked. And it has everything to do with Om?s death and his killer.

 So, watch the two serials in one as the two storylines merge into one climactic crescendo.

 What transforms a house into a home? The tips will be on beam now as Discovery Travel amp; Living presents two series on designing good homes in its Interiors Week starting June 19 to June 23. 

 Understanding how design transforms space can be both informative and entertaining. At 9 pm will be aired Double Vision, starring identical twin interior designers, Jayne and Joan Michaels. This is a series where we get to see how two identical spaces are being worked upon simultaneously by identical twin designers. The challenge is to do up two similar spaces differently from each other. Watch the series to see how identical twins can present distinctly diverse designs for the same space and give it a contrasting touch. 

 From House to Home is the other series in Interiors Week. A team of professionals, including an interior designer, a garden designer and a property developer, comes together to renovate a given space of a house and ends up creating a well-designed room. Be it the kitchen, or the living room or the bedroom, each area is planned and given a makeover to match the owner?s personality. 

 The d?cor chosen keeps in mind the essential elements: comfort, functionality and good looks. The show unfolds innovative design options for its viewers to help transform every space into a specific room. Watch From House to Home in the Interiors Week at 9.30 pm and find out how good design can add a new dimension to the interiors of your home.

 For some time now, the writing on the club walls has been clear: take hard decisions or haemorrhage. Now, Calcutta Swimming Club (CSC) ? inaugurated in 1887 as The Baths ? has extended superannuating options to its senior members.

 The Strand Road club management has succeeded in getting a resolution passed at an extraordinary general meeting recently, chalking out the retirement route as an option to those who have been members of the club for at least 20 years or are over 60 years of age.

 The exit option comes with a one-time benefit of Rs 75,000, subject to club committee approval.

 ?This is the first time in the history of Calcutta?s social clubs that a resolution for surrender of membership has been successfully passed, and we have had immediate response,? CSC president Ravi Todi tells Metro.

 If CSC got the retirement resolution passed by ?an overwhelming majority?, Saturday Club balked at the brink when it tried to break a 12-year deadlock by inducting 25 new members every year. 

 The Wood Street club loses ?around 50 active members annually? through death, disease, transfer or other reasons.

 ?Of our 1,800-odd town members, barely 400 use the club?s facilities on a regular basis. Although we manage to meet the deficits through corporate memberships, the club surely needs fresh blood,? stresses president Arjun De.

 How, is the vital question clubs are grappling with.

 CSC has found an answer, with the management receiving 60 applications from members willing to ?surrender?. Of the club?s 2,800-odd members, around 1,000 will be 60-plus.

 Todi feels the vacancies thus created could be filled up by active members, expected to use the club?s facilities more, yielding better revenues to build a corpus. ?There are too many dormant members and even after the minimum billing clause, it?s tough to plug the gaps,? he adds.

 Tollygunge Club had mooted a proposal similar to the CSC motion in 2000. The resolution was technically passed, but there were ?very few takers? on the ground. 

 ?There are members who don?t use the facilities at all, year in and year out. An exit option allows the management to keep these memberships alive,? observes M.J. Robertson, who was at the helm in Tolly when the golden handshake was offered.

 Robertson, now CEO of Space Circle, feels the retirement route should be the way forward for all other clubs saddled with dormant members.

 An informal survey initiated by DI last year had revealed how most run at an operational loss due to overheads, with an aging membership being one of the primary problems.

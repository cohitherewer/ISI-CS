 What: Grasim Mr India 2006. 

 Where: Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

 When: Saturday night. 

 The panel of judges: Actors Rahul Khanna, Mithun Chakraborty and Varun Badola, actresses Rati Agnihotri, Mousumi Chatterjee, Sakshi Tanwar and Rajeshwari Sachdeva, quiz master Siddharth Basu and ambassador of Tanzania, Eva L. Nzaro. 

 E-quotient: The countdown to the hunt for the most gorgeous men took off with a song-and-dance medley and some sizzling performances from Katrina Kaif and Koena Mitra. Deafening catcalls greeted Katrina as she took the stage to Just chill. Himesh Reshammiya belted out Aashiq banaya aapne and Jhalak dikhla ja, and the hot batch of 30 contestants danced to Right here right now. But the show stealer was city girl Koena who charmed all with her hip-hop act to Saki saki and Dholna... More dance numbers followed from telly stars Nigar Z. Khan, Karishma Tanna and Shama Sikand along with actresses Hrishita Bhatt and Suman Ranganathan. TV anchors Shonali Nagrani and Gauhar Khan added to the glam quotient as hostesses for the evening.

 The show: Looking dashing, the 30 contestants appeared on stage for the first time in ethnics or jackets. The second round brought the number to nine. A question-answer session with the judges whittled it down to six. The common question asked was ? If you were to appear on the cover of a magazine, which one would it be and what would the caption say? With 75 seconds to pen down an answer, most of the men opted for Time magazine. 

 The winners: Delhi boy Yatin Sonic clinched the title with his smart choice (I would love to be on the cover of Vogue and the caption would be What women want!). Nishant Dahiya and Hanif Hilal were declared the first and second runners-up. 

 Voiceover: The first call I will make is going to be to my father, Yatin smiled after winning the title.

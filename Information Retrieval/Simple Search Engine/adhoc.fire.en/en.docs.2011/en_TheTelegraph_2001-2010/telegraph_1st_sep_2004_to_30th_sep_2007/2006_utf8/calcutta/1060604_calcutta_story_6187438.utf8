 Slippery slope 

 of separation anxiety

 I almost stopped talking to my 

 friends Viki and Tasneem when they gave their two-year-old 

 mongrel Joeye away. Since they were both working, Joeye 

 was alone at home to fend for himself. He would tear down 

 the entire house and keep the neighbours up with his incessant 

 barking. With neighbours complaining and Joeye?s increasing 

 aggression, they had no option but to give him up.

 Last week, on the Internet, I 

 came across separation anxiety, a behavioural problem that 

 dogs suffer from. What is separation anxiety? In dogs it 

 is the fear of isolation, which often results in undesirable 

 behaviour. It causes them extreme distress and anxiety when 

 left alone.

 Why does it occur? It?s not known 

 why some dogs suffer from separation anxiety while others 

 do not.

 Separation anxiety sometimes 

 occurs: 

 When a dog accustomed to constant 

 human companionship is left alone for the first time.

 Following a long interval, such 

 as a vacation, during which the owner and dog are constantly 

 together.

 Due to a traumatic past, such 

 as times spent in a shelter.

 After a change in the family?s 

 routine (in work schedule or if a new pet or person comes 

 into the home).

 Separation anxiety-induced 

 behaviour includes:

 Digging, chewing and scratching 

 at doors or windows in a bid to escape and reunite with 

 owners.

 Howling, barking, and crying to 

 get the owner to return; urination and defecation at unacceptable 

 spots (like the bed).

 You can know that your dog has 

 separation anxiety if the behaviour occurs exclusively or 

 primarily when he?s left alone, whether for a short or long 

 period of time, and he reacts with excitement, depression 

 or anxiety to your preparations to leave the house.

 In case your dog has separation 

 anxiety, try to: Keep your arrivals and departures low-key. 

 For example, when you come home, calmly pet him. This may 

 be hard for you to do, but it?s important because showering 

 excessive attention will only increase the anxiety during 

 separation.

 Increase your dog?s exercise. 

 A tired dog is a good dog. Try some mental exercises, like 

 training and exploring new places.

 Gradually condition your dog to 

 being left alone. Leave for 10 minutes, come back, and, 

 if there are no problems, heap praise on him. Then keep 

 increasing the time until you have conditioned him for the 

 amount of time you are normally gone. 

 Be sure to maintain regular hours 

 after this conditioning because the first time you are later 

 than usual, he will misbehave as a way of relieving stress.

 Get your dog used to your getting-ready-to-leave 

 cues, like picking up keys, putting on shoes. Go through 

 these actions repeatedly when you?re staying home. Leave 

 your dog with an article of clothing that smells of you.

 If your dog engages in destructive 

 chewing as part of his separation distress, leave him a 

 chewing item (hard rubber toys). Remember that punishment 

 is not an effective way to treat separation anxiety. In 

 fact, it may actually increase his separation anxiety.

 Though today Joeye is a happy 

 dog, chasing birds on the farm with other dogs, I had to 

 make that one call to my friends and tell them Joeye suffered 

 from an acute case of separation anxiety and wasn?t an ill-mannered 

 dog after all!

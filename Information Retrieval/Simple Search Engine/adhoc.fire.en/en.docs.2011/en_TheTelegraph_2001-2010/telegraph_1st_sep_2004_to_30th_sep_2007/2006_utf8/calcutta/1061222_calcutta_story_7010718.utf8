 Perilous Path: Shadows of apprehension lengthen on the Maidan after sundown

Apropos the reports Maidan stench leads to body, October 25, and When dark, its deadly, October 26, it is disheartening that the Maidan is no longer safe for evening-walkers. Young couples and single women are especially at risk in the area after dark. 

 Not many cities in the country, perhaps the world, are blessed with such a spectacular patch of green, that, too, at its heart. Sadly, the authorities have failed to maintain the lungs of Calcutta. 

 About 25 years ago, no one had heard of crimes on the Maidan. It was safe to go for a stroll on the greens even late in the evening. In contrast, people now avoid the Maidan even just after sunset. 

 There is no denying that failure to illuminate the Maidan after the sun goes down and lack of policing have made the stretch attractive for criminals. The discovery of a half-decomposed body near the Mohun Bagan tent underscores the point. Many other crimes perpetrated on the Maidan do not make it to the newspapers. 

 If the government remains apathetic about security on the Maidan, the law and order situation on the greens will deteriorate. That cannot be allowed. The administrators need to immediately set a deadline to put in place security measures on the Maidan at night. 

 It is the state governments duty to ensure that Calcuttans are not deprived of the pleasure of a evening walk on the Maidan after dark.

 Apropos the report Main water pipe near collapse, October 27, the water supply network in the city was laid by the British. The pipe connecting Palta and Tallah has outlived its life expectancy. Its wall has become thin due to wear and tear and is incapable of withstanding extra pressure. Recently, the pipe burst causing water scarcity in north Calcutta. The authorities must chalk out a plan to replace the worn-out pipe. The help of experts from abroad should be taken to ensure that the new network lasts as long as the old one.

 Apropos the report Cops track down cheques left in bus, October 31, it is good to know that there are at least some cops who go the distance to help the common man. The incident of a traffic sergeant chasing down a bus to retrieve a cheque will surely boost the faith of people in the force. I, too, have seen that traffic police generally try to help people in need. The authorities should laud the helpful officers in some way.

 It is shocking that about 17 per cent of the citys population suffer from anxiety disorder (Stress fans mind malady, October 30). This is a by-product of the intense competition in every sphere of life. The increase in population and economic disparity have given rise to socio-economic problems that are affecting the mental health of individuals. Anxiety disorder cannot be cured only through medicines. The government needs to address the root cause.

 Apropos the photograph with the caption Sibling snapshots, October 25, it was pleasing to see Dona Ganguly wearing the colours of the national flag in a Bhai Phonta function for thalassaemic children. She is a patriot like her husband Sourav who has done the country proud on so many occasions.

 The report Direct to home and aiming sky high, October 6, mentioned that the Tata Sky helpline 1-901-425-6633 is toll-free. I am a customer of the Direct To Home service and had to cough up a hefty amount after calling the number from my home landline. On August 31, I spoke with the operator on the helpline for 2,087 seconds. Calcutta Telephones metered the call at 70 units and treated it as an STD even though I do not have STD facility on my phone.

 Tata Sky responds: We have never stated our helpline numbers are toll free in any of our communications. However, the customer who was misguided by the article may contact us. 

 Apropos the report Two sides of the contest coin, December 13, Devraj Bhattarai had written to us in November with a swatch, claiming the Rs 5-lakh scholarship being offered in the Surf Excel 10/10 Contest. The swatch was validated and the claim was found to be false. We promptly wrote to Bhattarai explaining that he was not eligible as the claim was not genuine. For the purpose of control and to ensure genuine claims, all the swatches that carry the score of 10/10 and which are eligible for the scholarship have been pre-coded by us to enable us to validate the claims.

 What: Wine and Seafood 

 Festival. 

 Where: Mainland China.

 When: Till November 21.

 The spread: Tuna imported from Thailand, lobsters from Andaman and Cochin, prawns and king crabs from the Sunderbans Pamper your tastebuds with a sumptuous seafood spread. Each dish comes with wine, on the house. We have consulted wine experts. The idea was to pair each dish with the perfect wine, says Rajesh Dubey, director (food production), Mainland China.

 Start off with Steamed Lobster and Mushroom Dumpling, Pan Fried Lobster Dumpling with Onion and Celery or Steamed Prawn and Crabmeat Cabbage Roll. To go with it theres a glass of Sula Chenin Blanc.

 The soup section includes Lemon Grass Flavoured Lobster Broth paired with a glass of Sula Sauvignon Blanc; Hot and Sour Crabmeat and Tofu Soup paired with Sula Blush Zinfandel. Move on to the main course with Stir-fried Squid Flowers with Pepper along with a glass of Sula Blush Zinfandel.

 Then, sip on Sula Cabernet Shiraz while you savour Fire Baked Fish Stir Fried with Red Pepper, Singapore Chilli Crabs, Cheese and Chilli Lobster and Sun Dried Tomato Chilli Fish.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 120 per dish.

 Voiceover: This is the third year we have come up with a sea food festival and like every year we expect it to be very popular, smiled Dubey.

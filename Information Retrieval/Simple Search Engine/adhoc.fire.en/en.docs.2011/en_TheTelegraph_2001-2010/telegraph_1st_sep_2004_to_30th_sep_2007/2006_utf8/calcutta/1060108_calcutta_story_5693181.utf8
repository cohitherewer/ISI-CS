 Party right, through the night

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 Being up on your feet through the night could act as a great calorie-burner 

 A weeklong gruelling gym session and then working up the will power to say no to all things sinful. But come weekend and you suddenly find yourself taking the (Oscar) Wilde route of fighting temptation best by yielding to it! 

 That one small drink that leads to many more and that one potato wafer that doesn rsquo;t let you stop till you reach rock-bottom of the bowl. Sounds like your Saturday night story? 

 The same sequence repeating itself weekend in and weekend out could spell disaster. So, here rsquo;s the GoodLife guide to watch your health without putting paid to your party plans.

 Smart snacks

 Dont leave home on an empty stomach, warns nutritionist Shikha Sharma. Quite a common blunder for those hurrying to a favourite night spot after a hard days work. 

 A growling tummy just about consumes anything in sight, throwing all calorie calculations out of the window. While Shikha Sharma advises at least a bowl of curd before stepping out, restauranteur Ashim Mewar recommends ordering a dry toast with honey at the bar itself.

 Eating something helps coat the internal lining of your system, facilitating alcohol absorption, explains the doc. So, here are some smart snack choices that you can make through the night.

 While ordering at the bar, choose some grilled options like chicken, fish or vegetables. 

 Nibble on salad sticks with interesting dips.

 Cheesy savouries ? but not too much ? on the menu go well with the mood. 

 Say no to peanuts and potato wafers.

 Footloose fun 

 Dancing those extra calories away is one of the healthiest options ever. Wading your way through the crowd, the pushing and the jostling and finding a decent spot on the dance floor itself makes for a great warm-up.

 And then, theres that Bollywood beat lending itself to every jhatka and matka ? exercise could never be more fun! But if desi isnt your true style, then pump up your rate with those cool, hip-swaying hip hop moves.

 All the chartbusters right now, be it retro mixes or Kajra re scream for high energy and hence a 45-minute session could help burn many calories, says dance instructor and choreographer Vishal Kanoi. Salsa, too, is a great tone-up for the legs. 

 Cheers check

 Devdas isnt quite a welcome breed anymore. And the sooner people figure it out, the better it will be for the party scene. 

 Long hours gone without food, no time for a snack before clubbing and then a bad alcohol binge. While most party people really dont care what they are drinking after that certain level of happy high, its always a good idea to pre-determine how much you want to drink while the night is young. 

 Here are some tips from bar expert Irrfan Khan to keep the party going till late, without any hiccups.

 Vodka shots, now touted as the poor mans Tequila, is a no-no; choose from fruity shots like Kiwi Kamikazi or liquor-based B-52s. 

 Dilute your drinks with freshly squeezed juices instead of aerated drinks. 

 Lace your drinks with healthy snacks all through. 

 Lemon juice is great to prevent hangovers and for smokers. Drop it in your drinks as much as possible. 

 But healthy partying isnt only about what and how much you consume. Small things, says Ashim, should also be taken into account. 

 Never accept a drink from anyone you dont know well enough. Go up to the bar counter yourself and order a drink if need be, advises the man behind Red Kitchen amp; Lounge.

 And also, take cover the minute you feel yourself going a little haywire. Dont keep sitting if you begin to feel high. Standing helps and if you are up to it, just hit the dance floor, adds Ashim.

 And most importantly, dont forget to keep your intake of tobacco under control. Many people are used to lighting up a cigarette the minute they get hold of a drink, but its actually the perfect recipe to ruin your health. 

 Active smokers or their passive party partners both end up inhaling a dangerous dose of tobacco. So keep a count on the number of cigarettes or cigars you light up. And if lighting up is a must, try flavoured hookah, choosing anything from strawberry to apple. These pre-filtered hookahs, made of fruit pulp and honey, are filtered a second time through water and are hence less injurious to health.

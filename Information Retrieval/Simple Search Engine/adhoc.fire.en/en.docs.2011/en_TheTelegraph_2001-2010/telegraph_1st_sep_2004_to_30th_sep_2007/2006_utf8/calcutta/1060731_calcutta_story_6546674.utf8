 1.2 lakh snatched from fish trader 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dacoits stabbed a businessman and snatched Rs 1.20 lakh from him on a suburban train between Sealdah and Park Circus stations on Sunday morning. 

 One of the dacoits was caught by hawkers and members of the public at Park Circus station, officers of Government Railway Police (GRP) said. The dacoits stabbed Sahidullah Gain, 40, a fish trader, in the head with a knife. 

 Gain, a resident of Bahura, in Joynagar, South 24-Parganas, supplies fish to wholesalers at Koley Market, in Sealdah. As on any other day, on Sunday morning he delivered fish to the market and after collecting his dues, was on his way back home. 

 Gain, along with five other fish traders, boarded the Sealdah-Lakshmikantapur local on Eastern Railway?s Sealdah division. He was in the fourth compartment from the rear. 

 The train left Sealdah at 9.08 am and within few minutes, four youths armed with knives and a country-made gun, demanded that Gain hand over the bag containing Rs 1.20 lakh which he had collected after selling fish. 

 They snatched his watch and bags containing clothes from other businessmen, police said.

 When Gain tried to resist, one of the robbers stabbed him with a knife in the head. With Gain bleeding profusely, the dacoits started jumping off the train, which was slowing down as it was about to enter Park Circus station.

 As the passengers in the compartment raised an alarm, one of the dacoits, Saifuddin Mollah, could not escape. ?He was caught by hawkers and passengers standing at the station and beaten up severely,? said B.K. Mullick, superintendent of railway police (SRP), Sealdah. 

 Gain?s watch was recovered from Mollah, a resident of Pathar Pratima, in South 24-Parganas. Raids are being conducted to net the other members of the gang.

 Gain was taken to Bagha Jatin State General Hospital, where he was discharged after treatment. A complaint was lodged at Jadavpur GRP station. ?It seems that this gang was shadowing Gain for the past few days and was acquainted with his routine,? SRP Mullick said.

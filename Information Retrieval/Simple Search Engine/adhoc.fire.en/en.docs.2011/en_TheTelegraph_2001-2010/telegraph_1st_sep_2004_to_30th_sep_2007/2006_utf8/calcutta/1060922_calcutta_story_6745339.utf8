 Look before you speed: Death traps on 

 major city roads

The proposal to upgrade the services 

 of National Library is heartening (Service upgrade on cards, 

 August 23) for old patrons like us. I would like to suggest 

 modifications to the rules for admitting readers. People 

 associated with institutions of learning and authors should 

 be granted membership on the basis of self introduction. 

 The system of issuing Day Slips (valid for the day of issue 

 only) should also be restored for the benefit of non-members. 

 A system of offering life membership to a class of readers, 

 if introduced, would be most welcome. Banakumar Mukherjee,

 Bakultala Lane 

 The contractors and corrupt/inefficient CMDA officials responsible for the poor condition of the Park Circus Connector are hardly going to be troubled by reports like Blame game over repair, August 24. Their names should be revealed (if necessary, by using the right to information act) so that the CMDA is forced to take action against them. Lack of accountability has led to the poor condition of important roads. Also, why cant the repair of busy roads be done at night between 10 pm and 6 am as in Delhi, Mumbai and the Western countries? Creation of public opinion in this regard will help of lot.

 Apropos the article Act leash on schools, August 17, it is unfortunate that the association of Anglo-Indian schools, which is calling for protection of minority rights, has in no way been imparting education to Anglo-Indian children for free or at a subsidised cost. Providing no benefits or rights to the community but using its name is akin to exploitation. I am hopeful that the education minister Partha De will keep the interests of a microscopic community in mind while sorting out the matter.

 It is a welcome news for guardians 

 and parents that punitive measures will be taken against 

 private schools if irregularities are detected in their 

 mode of functioning. Most private institutions have poor 

 infrastructure and charge high tuition fees apart from donations. 

 Only the government can save parents from the sharks in 

 the educational sphere.

 A mother with her heart and soul as well as all her resources had tried to make her son an engineer (Mother in murder cry, August 17), but his senseless death has shattered her life. A probe by the CID should reveal the truth about Soumik Basus death. The Centre and the states should ban student unions in educational institutions. They are the root cause of conflicts on campus. Such a sad incident should not be repeated.

 The article Duel in the sun, August 12, on fencing brought back memories. I was the foil champion at the Indian Military Academy, Dehra Dun, during my two-year training period there as a cadet in the late Fifties. I was adept at an attack mode that is usually known as parry-thrust, a technique that Olympic champion Christian DOriola of France used to great effect later on. I remember the fencing team was made to see the movie Scaramouche. I still recollect the teacher in this film instructing Stewart Granger: You must hold your sword like a bird hold it too light and it will fly away, hold it too tight and it will die! I am sure the day is not far when Indias fencers will win medals at the Olympic Games.

 Apropos Medical mess at fitness hubs, September 14, the tragedy happened in a gym on AJC Bose Road, but the picture used is of our gymnasium. This has caused a lot of confusion among our members. The picture has caused a great harm to our reputation. Ocio at Belvedere has four fitness trainers and an ACE amp; PICP certified fitness consultant. Each of them is fully trained in administering first aid and safety.

 Apropos the report Landfill legalised for fat fee, September 12, the Foundry Park project, promoted by Indian Foundry Association and being implemented by Foundry Cluster Development Association, is strictly following procedures and requirements of the state pollution control board so that environment clearance is duly obtained both at the state level as well as from the Union ministry of environment and forests. Our proposal has cleared many such stages and there has not been a single adverse comment from anyone.

 CEO, Foundry Cluster Development Association 

 Metro replies: The article mentioned that 

 some industrial estates and foundry parks had been identified 

 by the land and land reforms department as flouting land 

 rules. It did not pinpoint this specific Foundry Park 

 project being promoted by the Indian Foundry Cluster Development 

 Association nor hint that this particular foundry park was 

 flouting norms. The article has no bearing on this particular 

 project.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The death of 70 chickens in 48 hours sparked panic at Sheoraphuli, in Hooghly district. 

 Officers of the animal resources development department visited Jayanta Poultry Farm, in Jagaddhatri Para, and collected samples for post-mortem and other tests.

 ?The post-mortem reports say the chickens did not die of bird flu but of Ranikhet disease,? said Subesh Das, secretary of the department. 

 The farm was not sealed since the deaths did not occur because of bird flu, the officers said.

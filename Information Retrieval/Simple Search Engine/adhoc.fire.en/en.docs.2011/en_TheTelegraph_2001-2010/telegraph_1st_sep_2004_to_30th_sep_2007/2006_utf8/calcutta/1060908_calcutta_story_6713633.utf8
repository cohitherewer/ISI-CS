 Probe confirms murder

 - Discrepancy in statements arouses suspicion of sleuths

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Joyjit Mukherjee, the B-school student from Jadavpur whose body was found beside railway tracks near Dunlop on August 17, had been murdered, according to detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Officers of the Government Railway Police (GRP), who were probing the death earlier, claimed it was a case of suicide.

 The CID officers have come across discrepancies between the statements of those who had seen the 25-year-old hours before his death and the report filed by the GRP.

 Our preliminary investigation does not support the suicide claim. Circumstantial evidence and the nature of injury on the body indicate foul play, said D.P. Tarania, inspector general (II), CID.

 The CID took charge of the investigation after Joyjits family alleged that the student might have been murdered.

 According to the sleuths, there was a feud between Joyjit and Ramesh Balmiki, laboratory assistant of his college. Balmiki said he had lent his cycle to Joyjit a couple of months ago, but he was not returning it, stated Tarania. On August 17, four people accosted Joyjit in front of a cinema hall and accompanied him to the college campus.

 There, Balmiki and his friends took away Joyjits cellphone and wallet, and forced him to write a statement saying he was handing over the articles willingly. 

 Balmiki claimed during interrogation that he had allowed Joyjit to leave the campus. He even told this to the college principal, stated an officer working on the case.

 The detectives interrogated Ajay Debgupta, the principal, on Wednesday and he told them that he was aware of the dispute between Joyjit and Balmiki. But the sleuths are not satisfied with the statements furnished by Balmiki and his friends.

 The other factors that aroused the suspicion of the CID officers are:

 There were no bloodstains 

 near the spot where the body was found. It is possible that 

 Joyjit was murdered elsewhere and the body dumped beside 

 the railway tracks 

 If Joyjit had jumped off 

 a moving train, there would have been bruises and cuts on 

 his body. But there was no such mark 

 There were dirt and black 

 spots on Joyjits clothes. It is not clear where the students 

 clothes were soiled.

 What: The preview of Southern Weaves, an exhibition of classic silks from Chettinad and Kanchipuram. 

 Where: Kanishkas at 2/1, Hindusthan Road. 

 When: Monday, 3 pm onwards. The exhibition will be on from January 19 to 21. 

 The show: A Bharatanatyam performance by Chitraparna Saha and Milasree Bhattacharya, disciples of Kathakali exponent Guru Kalamandalam Venkitt.

 The saris and the dance performance cannot be separated from each other, hence this special cultural preview to showcase the binding thread, says Prateek Raja of Kanishkas.

 On display during the three days will be a host of special saris, a product line that is the outcome of a whole years designing and research conducted closely with the master weavers from the south. Bright colours blend beautifully with the authentic creams and golds to create stunning pieces. 

 Pocket pinch: The Chettinad range is priced Rs 2,700 onwards and the Kanchi-puram saris are tagged Rs 3,500-plus. 

 Voice-over: We have been working with weavers from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh for the past 15 years and our relationship with the Kerala craftsmen also is about six years old. This exhibition is our effort to revive old patterns and designs, many of which are extinct now, explained Prateek.

 New brew

 What: New menu for the new season with the theme Indulgence. 

 Where: Barista outlets.

 The menu: The card is extensive with an array of coffees and munchies on offer. Hot coffees include the Venetian Special Espresso Romano, the ever-popular Cappuccino with three new flavours like Irish Cream, Cinnamon and Tiramisu to choose from, Swiss Hot Chocolates, Vanilla Caramel Latte and the Caribbean Calypso. 

 For cold coffees there is the Apple Pie Shake and Big Brownie Bite to sip on. 

 The new wraps from the coffee chain include Chicken Masala and Chilli Paneer and the new crispies include Chicken Twister, Spicy Potato Twister and Veggie Puffs. 

 To take care of your sweet tooth, you can pick and choose from the very rich Dark Temptation, the sinful Wicked Brownie, the awesome Chocolate Iceberg, the delicious Black Forest Magic, Crumby Apple Dive and the exotic Apple Excess. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices of this new fare start from Rs 20.

 Voiceover: Barista is a great place to spend quality time in, and with the new menu, well spend even more time here, said a gang of college friends.

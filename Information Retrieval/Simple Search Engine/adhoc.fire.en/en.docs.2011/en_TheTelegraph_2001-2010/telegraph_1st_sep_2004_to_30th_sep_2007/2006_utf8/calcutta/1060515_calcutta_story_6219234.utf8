 A dance form of Assam, Sattriya Nritya was introduced in the 16th century by Shankardeva, the Vaishnavite saint and reformer, to propagate Vaishnavism in the region. Enriched with all the elements of classical dance, it was traditionally practised in the Sattra institution, which was envisaged by the apostles of the new faith as its preserver and the repository of its doctrines. Sattriya dance is set to a distinct system of melody and rhythm. Shankardeva alone composed a large corpus of lyrics, each composition being set to a particular raga and tala. New additions, experimentations and improvisations have subsequently enlarged and widened the canvas of this form over the years. Guru Jatin Goswami (picture above), an acknowledged expert of Sattriya Nritya, has just concluded a 10-day workshop on the form, with over 30 young dancers. This evening, the workshop participants and Guru Jatin Goswami, will present a Sattriya dance recital.

 Event: Sattriya dance presented by Guru Jatin Goswami and participants of his workshop 

When: Today at 6 pm

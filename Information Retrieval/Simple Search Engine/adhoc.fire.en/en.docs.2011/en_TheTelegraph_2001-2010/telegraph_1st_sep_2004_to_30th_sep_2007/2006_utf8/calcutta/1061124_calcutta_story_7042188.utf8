 Shibaprasad, 16, was digging mud on an embankment of Tollys Nullah on Thursday morning when a huge mound fell on him from a height of 15 feet, crushing him.

 Residents of Paschim Putiary, near Kudghat, took Shibaprasad to MR Bangur Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Till late at night, the body lay unclaimed at the hospital morgue.

 The embankment, near Putiary bridge, was erected for the expansion of Metro Railway from Tollygunge to Garia. A spokesperson for Metro Railway said Shibaprasad was not part of the expansion squad.

 I was returning home from the market around 9 am when I heard a cry from the spot. Along with a few local residents, I went close and found Shibaprasad trapped under a huge mound of mud. Two youths, who probably accompanied the 16-year-old in digging mud, were trembling in fear, said Narayan Chatterjee, a local resident.

 We started to clear the mound to rescue Shibaprasad, whose name we came to know from the two youths. He was unconscious by the time we could manage to bring him out, recalled Ashish Mitra, another local resident.

 Meanwhile, sensing danger, the two youths fled before a team from Thakurpukur police station reached the spot. 

 The residents blamed a gang of soil racketeers for the death. Following the real estate boom in areas like Haridevpur, Putiary and Garia, these unscrupulous elements are engaging poor youths to steal soil that they later sell to promoters, said a local resident. He alleged that such activities are rampant along the entire stretch of Tollys Nullah.

 S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said a probe has been ordered to find out who had engaged Shibaprasad.

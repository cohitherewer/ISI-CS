The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safety at shop 

 stops

 Post-Meerut, Metro checks out 

 the fire-fighting fitness of our markets 

 Canning Street market. 

 Picture by Pradip Sanyal 

 Where: 72, Canning 

 Street

 What we saw: 

 The market that dates back to 1886 is a fire trap. It has 

 three extremely narrow entry/exit points with illegal encroachments 

 and just two fire extinguishers, the use of which the shop-owners 

 aren?t too clear about. Electrical wires and fixtures hang 

 everywhere

 Marketspeak: 

 ?The landlords refuse to spend any money on maintenance. 

 There have been a number of minor fires... We are keeping 

 our fingers crossed,? said R. K. Gupta, secretary, 72, Canning 

 Street Welfare Association

 Where: AC Market, 

 on Shakespeare Sarani

 What we saw: Things 

 are improving at the market that opened in 1972. Five entry/exit 

 points are open; each has a fire extinguisher. Smoke detectors 

 have been installed; work on a water sprinkler system is 

 underway

 Marketspeak: 

 ?We are extremely conscious of the fire- safety regulations 

 and are taking all necessary steps,? said Pradip Arora, 

 president, shop owners? association 

 Where: Treasure 

 Island, off Lindsay Street

 What we saw: The 

 market set up in 1986 has three entry/exit points, but two 

 remain shut most of the time. Fire extinguishers are placed 

 at a few strategic points.

 Marketspeak: 

 ?We have to keep two entry/exit points closed because of 

 the AC. But in case of an emergency, they can be opened 

 easily,? said Vinod Narula, shop owners? association

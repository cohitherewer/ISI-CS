 Brazil will win this year?s World Cup. The team does not play a power game, but the ball skills of the players put them above the rest. England stood a chance against Brazil, but the injury to Rooney has dashed its hopes.

 I think Brazil will win this edition of the World Cup. The prerequisite for winning a tournament of this magnitude is consistency. No other team comes close to the samba squad in this respect.

 Arindam Basu,

 Brazil is undoubtedly the favourite in this year?s World Cup. No other team boasts of so many players with the ability to turn a game on its head. Moreover, Brazil plays the most attractive football. Apart from Kaka, Ronaldinho, Adriano and Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Robinho are the players to watch out for. Brazil has played 87 matches in the World Cup, losing only 13. Being a die-hard supporter, I hope they continue the winning streak. Complacency must be kept at bay though.

 It is incredibly difficult to predict the winner of the World Cup, simply because there is very little difference between the top teams. My money would be on Brazil. Ronaldinho and Ronaldo will give the team an edge over England without Rooney.

 Subhobrata Basu, 

 Ballygunge Station Road

 I believe Germany, the host nation, will win World Cup 2006. The runners-up of the 2002 tournament would be boosted by the home crowd. The team has a wonderful blend of youth and experience. Podolski is an exciting prospect and is a front-runner for the Golden Boot. Ballack, on the other hand, is well known for his midfield prowess. The only weak link is the goalkeeper?s position, with Kahn and Lehmann past their prime. The defence will have to ensure that the goalkeeper is not tested too often.

 Brazil is my favourite team. I will be delighted if they win the Cup this time, too. The combination of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Robinho will pose a potent threat to any team. Moreover, no other team is more fun to watch. That?s why, Brazil has won the hearts of the world.

 Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Brazil is my favourite for the World Cup. No other country has a comparable side. France, Italy, England and Argentina can, however, come up with tough challenges. But the skill of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Carlos and Kaka should see Brazil through. The team?s recent performances make me more confident. Brazil is the favourite and for good reason. 

 P. Bhattacharyya, 

 Joka 

 My favourite team is Brazil. Whoever be its opponent, Brazil manages to raise its performance a couple of notches in the World Cup. Records, too, point to a Latin American triumph. Fortune, however, can upset calculations and predictions.

 Owais Khateeb,

 Collin Street

 Brazil will win the World Cup. It is strong in defence and attack and disciplined. The best players in the world, like Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos, are part of the team. The coach and the players are hardworking and dedicated. Moreover, its goalkeeper is a cut above the rest.

 Danish Khan,

 College Street

 Going by past performance, Brazil seems to be the strongest contender for the World Cup. The deadly trio of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaka should do the trick for the samba kings. France, Mexico and England will, however, ensure Brazils victory is not a cakewalk.

 Rabindra Lal Nandi,

 Kaikhali

 Miracles do happen in a match, but generally superior physical ability, mental strength, judgment and intelligence are enough to win. Brazil is the best equipped in these respects to win the Cup.

 Joydeep Chatterjee,

 Shyambazar

 Brazil, of course. It has the potential, stamina, consistency and skill. History also favours Brazil.

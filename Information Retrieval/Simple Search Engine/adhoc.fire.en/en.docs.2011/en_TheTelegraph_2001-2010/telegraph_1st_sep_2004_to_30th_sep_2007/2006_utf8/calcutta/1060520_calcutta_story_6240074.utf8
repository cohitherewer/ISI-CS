 The spread: An array of noodle delicacies includes Pho Ga (Hanoi rice noodles in broth flavoured with red hot chilli and coriander), Laksa Penaeng (from Malaysia, rice noodles cooked with pineapple in an aromatic tamarind broth) and Udon Noodle Bowl with Prawn Tempura (Japanese Udon noodles simmered in stock flavoured with ginger, served with prawn tempura).

 Pocket pinch: A meal for two could come to Rs 1,500. 

 Voiceover: We introduce innovations for our customers from time to time. The noodle promotion is an effort to ensure that the customer gets something totally different from the usual fare, said sous chef Rahil Ahmed.

 Summer fare

 What: Grishher Khabaar, a summer special food festival.

 Where: Oh! Calcutta in Forum at 10/3, Elgin Road.

 When: Till May 26.

 The spread: Sip on a cool glass of refreshing Aam Pora Shorbot (cooler of dry roasted mangoes) or Ghol (buttermilk) and start lunch with steaming rice and Shukto (bitter-sweet melange of seasonal vegetables flavoured with paanch phoron).

 Proceed to the Tok Dal (blend of lentils and green mangoes) and Lau Jabri (bottle gourd and chana dal patties with sesame paste).

 Among the vegetarian dishes, you can try the Jhinge Posto (ridge gourd and potatoes cooked with poppy seed paste), Doi Potol (wax gourd cooked in sweet-and-sour yoghurt gravy) and Subzi Monhari (a light concoction of seasonal vegetables tempered with onion seeds and chillies).

 In the non-vegetarian section, savour the Aam Diye Machh (fish stewed with raw mangoes), Murgi Posto (chicken chunks swathed in poppy seed paste), Niramish Mangsher Jhol (mutton curry without onion or garlic) and Chingri Pudina Curry (prawns combined with mint). 

 Dont miss the Kacha Aamer Chutney (sweet and sour condiment of raw mangoes) before moving on to the desserts.

 On a sweet note, end with Daber Payesh (green coconut kernel cooked in thickened milk) or Aamer Kheer (ripe mangoes steeped in condensed milk).

 Pocket pinch: Around Rs 500 for a non-vegetarian meal for two.

 Voiceover: All the 

 dishes in this special a la carte menu have a cooling effect 

 on the body and is just ideal for the summer weeks. Depending 

 on the popularity of the items, we may continue to serve 

 some of them even after the festival is over, said 

 corporate chef Rajesh Dubey.

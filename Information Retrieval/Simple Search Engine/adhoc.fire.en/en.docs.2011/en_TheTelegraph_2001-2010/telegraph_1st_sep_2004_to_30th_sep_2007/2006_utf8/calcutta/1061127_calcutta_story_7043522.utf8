 Generating coal from solid waste

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 A project to convert solid municipal waste to coal has come up in Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city.

 Being run by Barasat Municipality and the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA), the project produces two tonnes of artificial coal through carbonisation of 10 tonnes of garbage. 

 The project is environment-friendly and helps in proper disposal of solid waste, said Shantipada Gan Chowdhury, director of WBREDA.

 The process of converting solid waste to coal started a year back on an experimental basis at Mollar Bheri, in Salt Lake. In early 2006, Barasat Municipality had approached WBREDA to launch the project on a plot adjacent to the civic dumping ground on Jessore Road.

 The plant comprises a modified kiln. The sun-dried solid waste is fed into the oven and smouldered at a temperature between 600 and 700 degrees Celsius. A lining of catalyst on the inner wall of the kiln transforms the garbage into powdered coal, which is compressed into small cubes, explained Gan Chowdhury. 

 The artificial coal is useful for both domestic and industrial purposes. At present, it is being used as fuel in the power-generating plant at Gosaba, in the Sunderbans. Power for about 1,200 households is produced from the coal, Gan Chowdhury added.

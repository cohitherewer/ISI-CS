 What: 

 Emphasize, an exhibition of maternity wear and plus-size 

 clothing.

 Where: Flat 13, 3rd floor, Belvedere Court, 11 and 13 Alipore Road.

 When: From April 7 to 9.

 Take a look: Stylish maternity clothes like corduroy trousers, cool capris, sleeveless tops, shirts and evening skirts make up the line. Made differently to last all through nine months, these clothes ensure that you dont need to update your wardrobe each growing month. For plus-size women, there is a wide range of evening wear as well as basic formal shirts, kurtis, trousers and skirts. The embellishments used are lots of lace. The colour palette is bright and happy with some toned-down pastels to suit the summer.

 Pocket pinch: Prices at Emphasize begin at Rs 350 and go up to Rs 900.

 Voiceover: It is a very niche market and no one has really tapped the potential. Pregnancy style need not be restricted to oversized kurtas. Likewise, plus-size women should wear more than just all-black outfits, says the designer of the brand, Bhavna Jhingan.

 Birthday blast

 What: Second anniversary celebrations of Sriniketan at Metropolis, Hiland Park.

 When: Sunday, 4:30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: This happens to be Sriniketans 44th year in the city and its second at Hiland Park. As part of the birthday celebrations, kids along with parents and family members were present to enjoy the party and have fun. Tollywood actress Chandrayee Ghosh ? who stars in Rituparno Ghoshs forthcoming Dosar ? graced the occasion.

 The birthday bash kicked off with a fashion show by tiny tots showcasing the brand new childrens collection. 

 Girls and boys walked the entire floor premises and escalator showcasing smart frocks, capris, tees and trousers in cheerful splashes of pink and yellow. A band at the mall belting out numbers specially composed for the children kept the celebration mood going in full swing.

 Voiceover: Initially there were some apprehensions of Sriniketan fitting into the mall culture. But in the past few years the response has been good and people know that we not only cater to Bengali tastes but also provide options for all. We are due to open a shop near Shyambazar within the next few months, said proprietor N. Aich.

 Sunny splash

 What: Miss Lee, the spring summer collection from Lee.

 Take a look: Easily adaptable to modern lifestyle, the collection has been designed focusing on fashion and comfort. In keeping with current trends, the ensembles are fun and come in a riot of hues. 

 On offer is an array of layered tops, striped camisoles, off-shoulder tees, peasant skirts, embroidered jeans, tank tops, slim-fit corduroys, web belts and floppy hats. 

 Denims include slim-fits, stretch jeans and boot cuts. The fits are flattering and snug. The collection is available at all Lee stores. 

 Pocket pinch: The T-shirts are priced between Rs 349 and Rs 599 and the shirts cost anything between Rs 499 and Rs 699. The price tag for denims and trousers ranges from Rs 1,299 to Rs 1,599. The skirts come for Rs 899-Rs 1,099 and the capris for Rs 999-Rs 1,299.

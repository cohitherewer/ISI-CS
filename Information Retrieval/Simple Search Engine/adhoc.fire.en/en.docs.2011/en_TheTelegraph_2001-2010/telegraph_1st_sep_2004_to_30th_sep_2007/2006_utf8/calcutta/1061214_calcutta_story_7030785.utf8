Life

 Chocolates and chillies

 Shaun Kenworthy

 I spent a long time working as 

 a pastry chef before I decided there was more to food than 

 the delights of being a pastry chef. I recall the first 

 full-time job I had. I was working at a 200-room hotel in 

 Manchester called the Portland Hotel, then run by Thistle 

 Hotels, though I have no clue who runs it now.

 It was a busy hotel with loads 

 of banqueting. Even in those days most of the banquets were 

 plated, something very difficult to execute here in India 

 with so many special diets. 

 Yet very easy there. For instance, 

 if it was a party for 500 then youd cook 495 fillet 

 steaks and five chicken breasts for those who didnt 

 want steak or who were vegetarian (British vegetarians usually 

 eat chicken) and if there was a real vegetarian, a rarity, 

 then obviously they could have a plateful of the steak accompaniments! 

 Not a particularly vegetarian friendly bunch us European 

 chefs. Good for you that I discovered India. 

 The dessert of choice for most 

 parties in those days was either a simple fresh fruit meringue 

 with two-feathered coulis or profiteroles served with two-feathered 

 chocolate sauces, white and dark. The preparation of both 

 of these items, either meringue or choux paste, was a miserable 

 job, to say the least, especially for someone so junior. 

 Mondays was the day to make all 

 the profiteroles for the week and Tuesdays for the vacherins 

 (my job, if you like). Each plate of profiteroles was made 

 up of eight tiny choux buns and we would plan for around 

 1,400 portions per week (11,200). 

 This would include enough for 

 dessert trolleys for the restaurants as well and about the 

 same amount of portions of vacherin (meringue nests). Id 

 have to make 12 six-litre batches of choux and to my memory 

 around the same of meringue. 

 Now this is the part Im 

 getting to. You have to picture this. Both of these items 

 are piped out on to trays using a piping bag. Using a piping 

 bag is obviously something you get used to quite quickly 

 with those kinds of volumes, but a messy job all the same 

 for a newcomer to the industry. Youd end up with choux 

 paste or meringue covering you from head to toe after that 

 14-hour shift. 

 I remember going home, taking 

 a bath and there would still be bits of choux floating on 

 the surface or Id go out after work for a drink with 

 bits of dried up sugary meringue sticking the hairs together 

 on my arms in places that Id missed when I was washing. 

 Happy days

 Im going to give you the 

 recipe for profiteroles. No space for both but I promise 

 Ill give the meringue recipe sometime.

 Profiteroles

 For the choux pastry:

 Pre-heat the oven to 200OC and 

 then into a clean saucepan, pour 200 ml of cold water, half 

 a tsp castor sugar and 85g butter. Bring to a boil and stir 

 in 115g of plain flour. Beat together over the heat for 

 around 30 seconds, remove from the heat and allow to cool. 

 Once cool, gradually beat in four eggs, beating vigorously 

 until smooth and glossy.

 Lightly oil a large baking tray. 

 Dip a teaspoon into some warm water and spoon out a teaspoon 

 of the profiterole mixture. Rub the top of the mixture with 

 a wet finger and spoon on to the baking tray. This will 

 make for a crisper topping. 

 Bake for 25-30 minutes, until 

 golden brown. If too pale, they will become soggy when cool. 

 Remove from the oven and prick the base of each profiterole. 

 ace on the baking tray with the 

 hole facing upwards and return to the oven for a further 

 five minutes. The warm air from the oven helps to dry the 

 middle of the profiteroles.

 For the filling:

 Whip together 500ml of cream with 

 15g of icing sugar and a couple of drops of vanilla essence. 

 When the profiteroles are cold, using a piping bag with 

 a plain nozzle, pipe the cream into the holes of the profiteroles.

 Finally, the chocolate sauce. 

 Melt together 175g of good quality chocolate, (the best 

 that money can buy. It will make the difference between 

 good or an okay completed dessert), four table spoons water 

 and 15g butter over a pan of boiling water until smooth 

 and shiny. Arrange the buns on a serving dish and pour over 

 the hot sauce. Eat hot or cold.

 What We are Watching

 THEATRE

 Ballavpur 

 Ki Roopkatha 

 Padatik presents its latest production, directed by Pradip Roy. The play written by Badal Sircar exposes the pompousness and false grandeur of the wealthy landed gentry. The story starts with Bhupati Roy, the proud descendant of a landowner, deep in debt and trying in vain to elude his creditors.

 Watch it at Padatik Little Theatre, 6.30 pm, April 9

 Our plays, Our stage

 A panel discussion on why English theatre groups in the city tend to take up the works of European or American playwrights, overlooking the rich variety of Indian plays in English. Organised by Theatrecian and Dialogue Club. Panellists include Katy Lai Roy, Suman Mukhopadhyay, Vinay Sharma, Tathagata Chowdhury and Shuktara Lal.

 Catch it at Oxford Bookstore, 6.30 pm, April 12

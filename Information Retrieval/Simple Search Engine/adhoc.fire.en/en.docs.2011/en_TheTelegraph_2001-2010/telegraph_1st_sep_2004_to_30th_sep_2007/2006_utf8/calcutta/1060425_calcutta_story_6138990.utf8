The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clothes and stuff to woo the voters

 - CAP, VEST AND UMBRELLA MOST POPULAR

 Chowringhee constituency candidate Subrata Mukherjee is kicking off his poll campaign on a Sunday morning. A huge crowd awaits the former mayor at Hazra more. 

 Suddenly, there?s a huge rush towards a Maruti van parked under a tree. No, it?s not Subratada, but a trunkload of caps and badges bearing the Congress colours. Within minutes, the cloth caps are lapped up by the crowd waiting for their leader in the sweltering heat. Even a little later, after Mukherjee appears and the rally gets underway, party workers ? and bystanders ? are seen asking only one question to anyone remotely resembling a senior party functionary ? dada, ekta tupi hobey?

 With the Election Commission imposing restrictions on campaigning methods, including no graffiti on the walls, it?s clothing and accessories that political parties are using to take their message to the masses. And leading the pack is the ruling CPM.

 ?We?ve been selling over 3,000 caps a day,? said Ashok Singh of Ram Jiwan amp; Sons, on MG Road. The caps are priced at Rs 5, 6 and 7, depending on the quality of the cloth. 

 The designs are sent to the shop ? usually the party colour, symbol and candidate?s name ? which are then worked on by karigars in the Park Street area. 

 ?During previous elections, party flags were the highest- selling items. This time it?s caps and vests, sales of which started to pick up from a month before the elections,? Singh added.

 If caps cover the scalp, T-shirts offer more ad space. ?The parties and their agents source singlets and T-shirts from us. These are seconds rejected by the factories, with holes or spots on them,? offered Manoj Mundra, a trader on Rabindra Sarani. 

 Depending on the candidate?s demand, 2,000 to 6,000 pieces are picked up at one go. ?Right now, the round-neck is in good demand,? Mundra said.

 The umbrella is the other item of interest for political parties looking to beat the Election Commission clampdown. ?Umbrellas are a hit because they are stylish and come in very handy this season,? reveals an umbrella dealer on Armenian Street. ?We usually stock the umbrellas supplied by the parties but sometimes, they send us the design and ask us to get them printed as well,? he explains.

 With the emergence of newer modes of communication, traditional tools are taking a backseat. The use of local cable channels to promote candidates has been much less this time compared to earlier elections. 

 Clampdown confusion and a host of new channels, say cable operators, are the main reasons for this.

 ?Parties are not very clear about what is allowed and what is not. Also, with a number of local news channels offering ?live and exclusive? coverage, candidates are asking why they should spend money on coverage when they can get it for free,? said an operator.

 Earlier, local networks would be sent ?documentary type? video cassettes, profiling the party and the local candidate. The other request would be for covering meetings held by heavyweight netas in the neighbourhood.

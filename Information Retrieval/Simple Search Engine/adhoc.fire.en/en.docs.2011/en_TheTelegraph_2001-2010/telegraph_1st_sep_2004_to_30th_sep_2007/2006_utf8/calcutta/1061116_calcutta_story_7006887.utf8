 Raids to monitor fire-fight measures

 KINSUK BASU

 Rattled by the lack of fire-fighting arrangements at Ruby General Hospital, the fire services department has decided to raid markets, business hubs, hotels and restaurants across the city to take stock of the measures adopted by them.

 We went to a few star hotels recently and plan to visit a few more in the weeks ahead for a stock-taking exercise. I will not reveal names, but there are quite a few hotels, markets and nursing homes that are slack in terms of abiding by the fire-safety norms, said state director of fire services Gopal Bhattacharya. There are several institutions that have not even renewed their fire licences, he added.

 According to sources, a team of inspectors will first visit some malls and markets in south Calcutta, including Vardaan Market and AC Market. Some markets in Bhowanipore, Tollygunge and Behala will also be under the scanner. 

 Why just markets? Several hospitals, including the ones most frequented, dont have a fire-fighting system in place. The same holds true for a few well-known clinics in south Calcutta, said a senior officer of the department. 

 Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to the authorities of Ruby General Hospital, saying that it should cut down on admission of patients till the essential fire-fighting system is in place.

 Neglecting fire prevention measures is a serious offence. Weve asked the hospital authorities to restrict the admission of patients until theyve taken precautionary measures, stated Chatterjee. The minister threatened to lodge an FIR against the authorities if they dont comply. We can even get the hospital proprietor arrested, he asserted. 

 At an inspection on Tuesday, fire services officers found basic fire-fighting infrastructure missing at Ruby General Hospital despite a notice, issued on November 3, being served on the institution. The corridors are narrow, smoke detectors were absent and there were virtually no fire-fighting measures. The staff doesnt have the minimum training, said Chatterjee.

 Party probe: Health minister 

 Surjya Kanta Mishra has ordered an inquiry into the party 

 at Ruby General Hospital on Saturday night. Ive asked 

 my officers to investigate. Theyve gone to the hospital 

 today, said Mishra on Wednesday. A sting operation by news 

 channel Star Ananda had brought the party to light.

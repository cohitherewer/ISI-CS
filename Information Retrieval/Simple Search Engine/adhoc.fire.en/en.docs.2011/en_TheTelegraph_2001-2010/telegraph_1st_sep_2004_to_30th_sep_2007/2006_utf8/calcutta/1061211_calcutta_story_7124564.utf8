 SRK trying to better Big B

 Friday 

 If you do not let me go soon, I will either be divorced or I will die, announced an anguished Arshad Warsi. The day (Friday, December 8) Metro caught with Circuiteshwar on the sets of Bigg Boss in Karjat (a two-hour drive from Mumbai), it was Mrs Arshad Warsi, Maria Gorettis birthday. So, the request to wind up the chat early was understandable. But once the man got talking, wifes birthday bash took a backseat.

 Bigg 

 host

 Arshad took up the job of hosting Sonys big-ticket reality show Bigg Boss because he wanted to see if he could do it. Hosting and acting are two very different ball games, he said. I am ready to do the weirdest stuff as an actor but hosting demands a different routine.

 Over one month into the job, Arshad feels that he is still getting there. Initially, I was petrified and it took me some time to find my way, he recalled. Still I am nowhere from being the best host ever. My show producers think otherwise, though. But what you see is the real me. I am not acting when I am hosting.

 Not easy to be pinned down by the teleprompter, Arshad doesnt find hosting easy. Almost 90 per cent of the questions decided to be thrown at the guy, who would be eliminated, are changed eventually, he explained. You have to adjust and adapt to the mental state in which he is. Like Aryan (Vaid), I had to first give him time and then he broke down.

 He may be a new host but Arshad knows his anchors. I do look up to Mr (Amitabh) Bachchan, he said. He wins hands down but I have also enjoyed watching Farooque Sheikh. I love the warmth he exudes as a host.

 Arshads affinity for Big B as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati has made him a natural detractor of Shah Rukh Khan taking over as the shows quizmaster. He speaks his mind. Shah Rukh is trying to overpower Mr Bachchan. Anyone else in his place, it would have been a wrong call, but knowing Shah Rukhs track record, I think he knows what he is doing. It must have been a difficult decision for him, Arshad said.

 Kabuls kebabs

 What has Arshad learnt after shooting in post-Taliban Afghanistan for Kabul Express? Not to shoot there again, pat came the reply. Although this was meant as a joke, it was evident that the death threats and bombings had taken their toll on the actor who plays a news cameraman in the film.

 To be honest, it is really a fascinating country , Arshad continued. Where else would you find more AK-47s than mobile phones? I knew I would never get the chance to go to Afghanistan as a tourist. So it was an enriching shooting schedule for me.

 But it is the food that got Arshad really going. You have to eat the kebabs there to understand, he revealed. We had this man who is supposedly the best kebabchi in that country and he was making these kebabs to be used in the film shoot. Now, this was no Filmcity where the food used for shooting is often inedible. I checked with the kebabchi and once he assured that these kebabs could very well be eaten, I dug right in. Everyone else followed. We must have eaten 100 kg mutton in three days flat of which I must have had 20 kg!

 Having spent a lot of time with him on the sets, Arshad has the highest regards for John Abraham. I am delighted to be working with him again in Vivek Agnihotris Goal, he said. Anyway, no girls want to act with me. So, I have to look for male co-stars with whom I can do male-bonding films.

 Arshad is sure that Kabul Express will not only amuse, but also make people aware. Watching the movie you will know how 95 per cent of the Taliban are from Pakistan, he chipped in.

 Family man

 Arshad doesnt hide the fact that he took up Bigg Boss to spend three months with son Zeke Zidaan. Otherwise I would be shooting in London or Australia, he explained. He loves his son so much that he almost springs out of his chair if you call Zeke Zidaan a weird name. The names special, he argued. Zeke means shooting star in Aramaic (believed to be the language of Jesus Christ) and Zidaan means the pinnacle in Arabic.

 When it comes to wife Maria, Arshad goes into defensive mode. She doesnt want to do films; she is a very good Catholic girl who loves to be at home with her kid. Do you know she was offered Dil Se by Mani Ratnam?

 And it is because of Maria and Zeke that Arshad would never get inside the Bigg Boss house. I love my family too much. I cant spend so much time without them. And even if I do I have to have the facility to call them whenever I want.

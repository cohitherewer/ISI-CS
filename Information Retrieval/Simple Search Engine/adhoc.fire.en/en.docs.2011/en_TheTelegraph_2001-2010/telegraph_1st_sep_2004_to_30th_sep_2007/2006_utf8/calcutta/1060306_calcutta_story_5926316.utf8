 Twenty boys in black, wearing attitude on their jacket sleeves, rev up their metal chargers in front of Victoria Memorial. This is neither Dhoom 2 nor a shock-and-awe gang but a group of bikers with a zest for change.

 Monoshock is the name they band under, and their mission is safety. The company formed by some biking enthusiasts in town pressed the pedals on Sunday morning, from Victoria Memorial to Dum Dum. ?We bike for a definite cause. We want to change the perception that all bikers are brash and risk their lives by performing stunts. Some like-minded people have come together and made a pledge for safe biking,? says Rahul Mishra, member, Monoshock.

 After Dhoom and Torque released in 2004, being John Abraham or Martin Henderson became the driving force for every daredevil youngster with a bike. Biking gangs sprung up in most metros, often with dangerous consequences. Just a few weeks ago, the police slammed the brakes on a gang of 25 Dhoom-inspired bikers in Mumbai, who would assemble at the Bandra-Worli sea link at midnight and go crazy with their powerful machines. Similar cases were reported from Rajarhat New Town and even Dobson Road, in Howrah.

 But for Monoshock men, biking stunts like willies, stoppies and side sketchings are a strict no-no. They believe in safe and formation biking. ?Our gear is trendy, but it does not portray us as rash individuals. We wear full-faced helmets, shoes with laces and proper gear,? says Mishra.

 Beside going around improving the brand image of the biker, Monoshock will import full-faced helmets and boots to promote two-wheeler safety.

 ?No matter where, the identification with a fellow biker is automatic. Where else will you have a techie from Infosys holding a college dropout in high esteem? Most of us on the ride-outs met not more than a few weeks ago. But we have all bonded for our love of formation and safe biking,? says Jai Shah, team coordinator.

 Something like the bonding that John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan are known to share as they hit the fast lane on their bikes after midnight in Mumbai. But far safer.

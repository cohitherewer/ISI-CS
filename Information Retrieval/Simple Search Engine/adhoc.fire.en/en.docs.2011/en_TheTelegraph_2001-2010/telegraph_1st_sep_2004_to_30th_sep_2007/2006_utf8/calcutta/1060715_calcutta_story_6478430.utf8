The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Raid heat in red alert

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have launched a crackdown on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, following the serial blasts in Mumbai.

 In the past three days, a team comprising personnel from the special branch, intelligence wing of the city police and the detective department raided a number of hotels and guest houses to verify whether any foreign national was staying without valid documents.

 Four Bangladeshi nationals and an Indian were arrested in the New Market area in course of the raids. Four fake passports were seized from the Bangladeshis, who were from Noakhali and Dhaka.

 ?The raids are part of precautionary measures initiated after the Mumbai blasts,? said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 According to police, there are a number of places in central and north Calcutta where Bangladeshi nationals put up during their visit to the city.

 ?We have recently arrested a number of people who came here with an intention to distribute fake Indian currency notes. During interrogation, we found out they had links with terrorist outfits and Pakistan?s ISI,? said an officer.

 ?Even Research and Analysis Wing had once cautioned the city police about illegal immigrants,? he added.

 The areas that came under the cop scanner in the past three days were Zakaria Street, New Market, Lindsay Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Free School Street.

 ?Apart from netting the five, we had examined more than 50 Bangladeshi nationals and verified their documents. The exercise will continue for the next couple of weeks,? said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

 While interrogating the four Bangladeshis, police came to know they had come here a few months back and were planning to open a business of sending labourers abroad.

 ?They had already established contact with those who supply fake passports,? said an officer. ?The Indian joined hands with them.?

 A special branch officer said: ?The state has become a safe passage for intruders. For Pakistani nationals, the Karachi-Dhaka-Calcutta route is the safest to sneak into India.?

 According to a report the state government received from Delhi a few days back, several people whose names figure on the most-wanted list of the Bangladeshi police have been holed up in the city for the past several months.

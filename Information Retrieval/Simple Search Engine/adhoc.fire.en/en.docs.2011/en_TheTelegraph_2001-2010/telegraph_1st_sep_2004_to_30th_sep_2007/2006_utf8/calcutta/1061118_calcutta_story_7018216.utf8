 007 may not give a damn about his

 all shaken amp; stirred by the first day, first show

 Daniel Craig in 

 Casino Royale

 The film

 First things first. Casino 

 Royale is the best James Bond film ever and yet it is 

 not a James Bond film the way we have known it for the last 

 four decades.

 Yes, there is a master spy but 

 only just. At the beginning, his just-earned double-0 status 

 is almost taken away because he is a blunt instrument. 

 Somewhere in the middle, he himself resigns the MI-6 job. 

 And it is only at the end that he speaks the words we all 

 wait for: The names Bond, James Bond. Whats more, the 

 signature tune is played only with the final roll of the 

 credits.

 Casino Royale is about 

 how just another 00 agent is battered, bruised and betrayed 

 to blossom into 007, into the James Bond. In that 

 sense, the film remains true to its working title Bond 

 Begins. For, very much like Christopher Nolans Batman 

 Begins, Martin Campbells film unlearns the rules of 

 the Bond game and lays them out afresh, thus setting the 

 stage (or rather screen) for an-all new franchise.

 And, to be honest, 007 did need 

 a rebirth having been reduced in the last few outings to 

 just another gadgety, high-octane action thriller with come-on-say-it-now 

 one-liners and come-on-show-them-now set-pieces.

 Eva Green in the 

 film 

 The magic of Casino Royale 

 lies in the love story at the heart of all the dhoom-dhadaka. 

 The romance between James Bond and Vesper Lynd is so electric 

 and enigmatic that at times you end up hoping that they 

 live happily ever after and flout Ian Flemings storyboard.

 By returning to the master storytellers 

 first Bond book, the makers (the Broccoli family) have been 

 able to take James Bond out of a world of fantasy to a real 

 and relentless ride where blood and sweat blend seamlessly 

 with blondes and style.

 So, Bond returns to good old school 

 no-frills film-making. They dont even allow you to rest 

 your eyes on that stunning Aston Martin DBS (colour: Casino 

 Ice). Its all rolled over even before you can say WOW! 

 Directorspeak: This is 

 Bonds first 00 mission and he has a lot to learn. Hes 

 thinking more with his heart than with his head, and things 

 go wrong. But by the end of the movie hes becoming the 

 man we know. This is more realistic and more emotionally 

 involving than previous films Martin Campbell. 

 The man

 In Kill Bill, Budd tells 

 Elle: If youre gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare 

 it to every sword ever made, wasnt made by Hattori Hanzo. 

 Taking a cue from QT (Quentin Tarantino) language, when 

 you compare a James Bond, you compare him to every man who 

 ever played and didnt play James Bond.

 Daniel Craig holds his own, and 

 how. Yes, Sean Connery was the popular choice, Roger Moore 

 the favourite of Fleming fans and Pierce Brosnan the coolest 

 one but just a few minutes into Casino Royale you 

 know who the man who wrote Bond would have picked to play 

 Bond Daniel Wroughton Craig.

 So, no offence meant to the Connerys 

 and Brosnans, its just that Dan lives 007, rather than 

 wearing the tag on his sleeves.

 Tough, thuggish, no-nonsense, 

 spontaneous, vulnerable (and, yes, blond)... Daniel Craig 

 brings a hunger and urgency to James Bond that the franchise 

 badly needed.

 Watch him bust the most popular 

 Bond myth when the bartender asks him about his Vodka Martini: 

 Shaken or stirred? Our man Craig retorts: Do I look like 

 I give a damn? Gulp!

 Bondspeak: I wanted to 

 do as much of the action work as I could, so that the audience 

 can see its me and its real. If you dont get bruised 

 playing Bond, youre not doing it properly Daniel Craig.

 The women

 Theres always more cleavage than 

 character in a Bond film but not so with Casino Royale. 

 And in many ways, Eva Greens Vesper Lynd is more important 

 to the film than Bond himself, because she makes him what 

 he will become in the (books and) films to follow.

 The alluring French actress, discovered 

 by Bernardo Bertolucci, is a real dream. With loud make-up 

 and without it, with killer lines and without them, Eva 

 sets the screen on fire, a fire that can only be doused 

 by Bonds ice- blue eyes. A Bond lady has never looked or 

 sounded better and there lies a secret to the films wholesome 

 flavour.

 The other Bond babe is Solange 

 far more conventional played by Caterina Murino, has 

 precious little to do other than crawl on Dans bare chest 

 and walk the beaches in a bikini. No novelty there!

 And what does one even begin to 

 say of Judi Dench? Just watching her play M is like enrolling 

 in an acting workshop. As Bonds boss, Dench is just brilliant, 

 and thanks to guest screenwriter Paul Haggis, she has more 

 to say and do this time.

 Ladyspeak: Vesper is a 

 complex person. She is full of secrets and I think that 

 is why James Bond is attracted to her. She and Bond spark 

 off each other, they are always bantering and they understand 

 each other on the surface Eva Green.

 With Bond and Solange the energy 

 is purely sexual; its chemistry Caterina Murino.

 Im drunk with power Dame 

 Judi Dench.

 TAKE ONE: FROM DEBUTANT TO DEVOTEE 

 We caught up with a few Calcuttans 

 after the Friday morning show of Casino Royale 

 at INOX (Forum)

 Harshvar-Dhan: 

 I have never seen a James Bond film before. I really loved 

 the action scenes in Casino Royale, especially the ones 

 in the beginning and in the end (pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)

 Monisha: 

I have seen all the Bonds from Sean Connery to Roger Moore to Pierce Brosnan but 

after watching Casino Royale, I think Daniel Craig is the best. He is the most 

masculine of the lot and he has a great screen presence

 Harjot: 

 Before this I have only seen Pierce Brosnan in the role 

 of James Bond but I found the new actor better than him. 

 He is very good in the action scenes and he also has a great 

 body. I want to watch the film again

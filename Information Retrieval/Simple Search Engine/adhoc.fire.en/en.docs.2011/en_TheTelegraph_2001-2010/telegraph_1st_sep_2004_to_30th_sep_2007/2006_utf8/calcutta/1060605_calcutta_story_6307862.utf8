 Dancer-turned-choreographer-turned-DJ by accident ? thats how Akbar Sami likes to describe his entry into the world of disc jockeying.

 But the veteran DJs involvement with the world of music goes much deeper than the console. Introducing new sounds, music direction, production and squeezing in time for DJing keeps Akbar busy.

 Akbars foray into the entertainment world dates back to the early Eighties when he would go around doing dance shows. He later graduated to be a choreographer, while still in school. 

 The DJing bug bit him when he was in standard eight. One Saturday, the in-house DJ at Cavern, the night club we practised in, did not turn up. The manager, all hassled, put me in the DJ console. Shaky and nervous, I began playing, getting the hang of it, and people actually enjoyed themselves. After that evening I breathed a sigh of relief, but somewhere at the back of my mind I knew this was something that I wanted to continue doing, he recalls.

 The brief stint in Cavern was followed by a job at Xanadu. Courses at Juliyanas (academy for DJ training) and DMC (DJs Mixing Club) in London ensured that Akbar was on the right track. 

 Otherwise I am a self-taught man. From the technicalities to reading the audiences mind, the initial days at Cavern and Xanadu had me learning it all, step by step, all by myself, remembers Akbar.

 He shot to fame with the album Jalwa, followed by Jadoo and Jalwa II. Delhi, Chandigarh, Pune, South Africa, Singapore, UK? This globetrotter has had audiences from all over the world dancing to his tunes. But it is Dubai where the Mumbai man enjoys playing the most. 

 It is a place where you have to cater to a crowd from all parts of the world. That is a challenge in itself, smiles the king of remix.

 While the debate on remixes spoiling the flavour of old melodies rages, Akbar finds nothing wrong in remixes. However, he is quick to add: There is too much of cloning now. The same beat, the same kind of music and to top it all, too much of sleaze in the videos.

 Timeless classics like songs from Pakeezah just cant be tampered with. Also, remixes are being done by all and sundry and there is little you can do, quips Akbar, who has remixed most of Himesh Reshammiyas recent chartbusters like Tera suroor and Jhalak dikhla ja. 

 Currently Akbar is enjoying every bit of his new-found role as a music director for the film Risk, an action thriller. Up-tempo, easy and friendly is how he describes the music . 

 The profession might demand a lot of disco, hip-hop and rock roll, but Sufi melodies and classical notes are personal favourites of the man who grew up on jazz, piano, saxophone, harmonium and the tabla. 

 In fact, before Jalwa happened I wanted to do an album on Indian folk, he reveals. 

 Akbar has played for biggies like Amitabh Bachchan, but it is Michael Jackson that he dreams playing for. 

 In Calcutta for a few performances over the weekend, Akbar rocked Tantra on Friday and Underground on Saturday. 

 Saturday morning, however, saw him spending time with amateurs at A.R.D Training (an institute for DJ training) at 31, Dr Suresh Sarkar Road, near Puddapukur Maidan. Youngsters asked him a host of questions about the profession and the big man was more than eager to reply. 

 How do we handle requests that do not go with the tracks being played at the moment and how important is communicating with the crowd? asked one student. And pat came the reply: Just play the request. The audience is your priority and communicating with them, reading their pulse is a must. Remember, you cannot disregard the audience, the moment they start disregarding you, your career is doomed. 

 His message for aspirants: Be a DJ if you have the talent and potential to be one, not for style.

 Slice of Europe at retail rendezvous

 An artists impression of Avani Europa

 Come Pujas 2008, you wont have to hop onto a flight to visit the Eiffel Tower or the Big Ben. You can catch a glimpse of these tourist icons of Europe on Jessore Road itself. Or their diminutive doubles.

 Avani Europa, a 430,000-sq ft retail rendezvous coming up between Lake Town and Bangur Avenue will have miniature replicas of European must-visit landmarks built into its faade design.

 We want to create a destination mall with Europe as the underlying theme, the stress more on ambience than the brand-mix, to provide a unique experience to shoppers and energise the entire zone, says Anirudh Daga, managing director of Avani Group, developers of the shop-flick-cuisine combine.

 Construction on the Rs 90-crore retail project (minus land cost) at 136 Jessore Road, attached to the 400-apartment Avani Oxford housing complex, will start in January next year and the mall is expected to welcome shoppers by the festive season of 2008.

 Apart from a four-screen Fame cineplex by Shringar Cinemas, the six-level northern shop stop, drawing inspiration from the thematic Dubai malls like Ibn Battuta, will have Magnet hypermarket of the Arun Maheshwari Group as the anchor. Magnet will be making its first foray into the city and has taken up 60,000 sq ft on the upper basement and ground floors.

 Shopping is not just need-based anymore. With people better travelled and more exposed to global elements, the aspiration level is rising all the time. Europa is an effort to satisfy such high aspiration by creating a feel of Europe with an artistic collage of some of the most abiding memories of the continent, explains architect J.P. Agrawal, who has come up with the design solution.

 Even the interiors will evoke Europe, promises Agrawal. We will create a European streetscape inside through typical signage and elements like lanterns and pedestrian loops with an open-to-sky feel. The design will have a classical touch instead of being minimalist Scandinavian in style. 

 Max Lifestyle of the LMG Group will occupy 25,000 sq ft with its fashion apparel/accessories bouquet, while Raymond will have a 20,000-sq ft outlet for its five brands. Talks are on with top brands like Provogue, Nike, Adidas, Titan and Bata, according to the developers.

 Each of the four theatres of the Fame multiplex will have a distinctive theme, says Daga. An open arena in front will have a giant LCD screen to beam sports, music and other entertainment shows, while there will be multi-cuisine food-and-beverage options both inside and outside.

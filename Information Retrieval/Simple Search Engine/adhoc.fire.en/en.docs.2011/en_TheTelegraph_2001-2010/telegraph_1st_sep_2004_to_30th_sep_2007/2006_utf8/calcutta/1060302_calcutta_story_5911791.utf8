 All about empowering women, That Takes Ovaries, an open-mike story-sharing session, celebrates the gutsy, sassy and often touching true takes of women?s oestrogen-powered deeds. Inspired by a book of the same name by best-selling American author and activist Rivka Solomon, this afternoon?s session will be conducted by Thoughtshop Foundation, in association with West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, to mark International Women?s Day. At the event, women will narrate real-life stories about times when they were bold, courageous or even outrageous, in front of a cheering, supportive crowd, affirming the storyteller?s self-confidence as well as encouraging the audience to discover their true selves. Anchor: Mira Kakkar. The session will conclude with a play-reading by college students.

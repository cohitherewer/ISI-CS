 Mystery death, 2 detained

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 38-year-old man was allegedly murdered on the premises of a highrise under construction on Kailash Ghosh Road, in Thakurpukur, on Sunday night.

 Shyamnath Ghosh?s body was found on a heap of stone chips on Monday morning. It bore several injuries, said witnesses. Two security guards of the building site have been detained for questioning. 

 Local residents alleged the guards often harassed people who walked past the compound after dark.

 Police, however, said Shyamnath was a drug addict and mentally unstable, and that there were no injuries on the body.

 Meghnad Ghosh denied the charges levelled against his elder brother Shyamnath. ?After his divorce, my brother sometimes became unmindful, but he never harmed anybody,? he said.

 Meghnad recounted: ?After watching a television serial, my brother had dinner with the family on Sunday night, before going out for a walk around 11 pm. When he did not return till midnight, we started looking for him. We decided to inform the police early in the morning. It was around 6.30 am that some youths from the area came to our house and said his body was lying near the compound of the building.?

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said the body has been sent for post-mortem.

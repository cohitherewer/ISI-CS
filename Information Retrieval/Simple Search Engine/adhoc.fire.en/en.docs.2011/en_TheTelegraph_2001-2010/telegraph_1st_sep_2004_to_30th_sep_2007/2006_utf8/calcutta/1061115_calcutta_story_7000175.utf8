 Sugar amp; the minors

 - Five per cent kids type I Diabetics

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Six-year-old Namrata Chatterjee was a healthy child till the end of last year, when she started losing weight rapidly. Her parents took her to a doctor, who diagnosed with diabetes.

 Twelve-year-old Saurav Das, a Class VI student from Cooch Behar, was getting thinner by the day and feeling abnormally thirsty. When his father took him to hospital, his blood glucose level was found to be 530 mg per 100 litre.

 Namrata and Saurav, along with many other children suffering from Type I diabetes, assembled at Park Clinic with their parents on Tuesday morning on World Diabetes Day. They interacted with doctors and received gifts from actors Victor Banerjee and Madhabi Mukhopadhyay. 

 A walk for diabetes awareness was also organised to mark the occasion by the state chapter of Diabetic Association of India.

 Juvenile diabetes is a cause of concern among doctors. According to them, nearly five per cent Type I diabetics in the city are juvenile. In this type of diabetes, there is no insulin formation in the body as the beta cells (which produce insulin in the pancreas) are destroyed.

 There is a life threat if juvenile diabetics stop taking insulin, said Sudip Chatterjee, endocrinologist at Park Clinic.

 In most cases, child diabetics are afraid of needle pricks while taking insulin, stated endocrinology head of SSKM Hospital Subhankar Chowdhury.

 In Type II diabetes, common among adults, organs get damaged if insulin is not administered over a long period but the process is much slower, he explained.

 In Type I diabetes, manifestation of the symptoms is immediate. It takes five to 10 years in Type II cases.

 Loss of weight, persistent thirst, weakness and severe illness even after fever are symptoms of juvenile diabetes.

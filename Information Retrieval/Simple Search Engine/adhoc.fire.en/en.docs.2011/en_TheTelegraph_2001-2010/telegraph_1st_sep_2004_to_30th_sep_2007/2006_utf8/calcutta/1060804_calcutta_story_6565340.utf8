 Theatre hall, drama cradle

 RESHMI SENGUPTA

 A drama school affiliated to Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) is coming up at Tapan Theatre, near Kalighat. 

 Niva Arts, which runs the theatre hall on Sadananda Road, will launch Niva Arts Natya Academy with a three-year diploma course on theatre, post-Puja. 

 The course is targeted at theatre aspirants who have passed Madhyamik or an equivalent examination. Stage veteran Manoj Mitra will be principal. 

 We have got affiliation from Rabindra Bharati University. The course curriculum has been chalked out according to RBU guidelines and with help from Manoj Mitra, said Samar Mitra of Niva Arts.

 The authorities are now selecting the faculty members, which will include several theatre stalwarts. Emphasis will be given on performance, as the quality of actors is falling by the day, he added. 

 Niva Arts is renovating the second floor of Tapan Theatre, where theory classes will be held in two batches on Saturdays and Sundays. 

 Though there is space for around 150 students, we wont take more than 50 per batch. The practical classes will be held in the auditorium below, said Mitra.

 A separate theatre-training school for children, Shishu Natya Proshikshan Kendra, is also being set up by Niva Arts, in collaboration with stage actor-director Koushik Sen. 

 Sen will train students from classes III to VIII at Sujata Sadan on Sundays. 

 Tapan Theatre, known to many as Nahabat (the play that ran there for 1,000 nights, before a funds crunch forced a shutdown), got a fresh lease of life when Niva Arts revamped and unveiled it early last year.

 In a bid to revive the commercial theatre format at the south Calcutta address, Niva Arts produced Janani last year, with Supriya Chowdhury and Madhabi Mukherjee heading the cast. 

 Last week, it premiered a new production, Bhalobashi Tai, featuring Santu Mukherjee and Chaiti Ghosal.

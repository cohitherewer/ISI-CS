 He went to Burrabazar police station and sought help from the lawkeepers. But the men in uniform demanded Rs 15,000 to lend him a ear. 

 The poor man left the thana without being heard.

 Ram Sagar Sahni, who used to run a fruit-juice shop on Canning Street, had initially broken down. Later, he mustered courage and decided to seek justice. He lodged a written complaint with the deputy commissioner of police (central division) on Thursday, giving a blow-by-blow account of his experience at Burrabazar police station.

 In his complaint, Sahni said he had been forcibly evicted from his shop a few days ago. ?Seeking justice, I went to Burrabazar police station. There, I encountered three extortionists in uniform. It was a nightmarish experience,? Sahni alleged.

 Sahni claimed in his complaint that he had visited the police station several times, but none of the officers paid any heed. ?One day, I was stopped by an officer of sub-inspector rank on Canning Street and warned not to go to the thana again. I broke down and fell at his feet. But he did not listen to me,? he wrote.

 The two-page complaint to the deputy commissioner says the officer told him that against a payment of Rs 40,000, his fruit-juice shop would be restored to him. ?I told him it was impossible for me to pay such a huge sum because now I am penniless. To this, his response was: ?Go to hell.?.?

 When Sahni said he would lodge a complaint with superior officers, the sub-inspector told him that it would not make any difference.

 Sahni sought help from the local organisations. He sent a copy of his complaint to Burrabazar Nagarik Front. ?We have gone through Sahni?s letter. If the police do not accept his complaint, we shall launch a movement in his support,? said Amit Pandey, assistant secretary of the organisation.

 Pandey alleged that asking for money and taking bribes have become a daily affair in the Burrabazar-Posta area. ?Policemen taking bribes from hawkers is a common sight here. They do not think twice about collecting money in full public view,? he added. 

 Asked about Sahni?s complaint, Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (central), said: ?I have ordered an inquiry to find out whether Sahni?s allegations are true. If they are, the guilty officers will face departmental action.?

 Kumar denied the charge of policemen accepting bribes. ?In most cases, we have found that there are other reasons for which businessmen make such complaints. When we probe the matter, nothing is found,? he claimed.

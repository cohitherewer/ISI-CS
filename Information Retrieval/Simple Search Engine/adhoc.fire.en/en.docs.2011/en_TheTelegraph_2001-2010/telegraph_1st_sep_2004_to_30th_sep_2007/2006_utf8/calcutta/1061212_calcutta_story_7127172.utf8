The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Foreign hand 

 in healthcare foray 

 - $500-million hospital, biotech research centre, medical mall and more

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A 1,000-bed multi-speciality hospital with non-invasive treatment of tumours, a biotech research centre offering stem-cell therapy, serviced apartments for patient families, medical mall, alternative medicine centre, nursing training institute. And all on the same campus.

 Calcuttas private-sector healthcare delivery system is set for a $500-million shot in the arm the Neotia Elbit Healthciti, to be set up by the Ambuja Realty Group in Chak Garia, off EM Bypass, in strategic alliance with Elbit Medical Imaging (EMI) Ltd of Israel.

 The principle agreement for the project was signed on Tuesday at Writers Buildings in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and David Danieli, Israeli ambassador to India, by Ambuja Realty Group managing director Harsh Neotia and EMI chairman Mordechay Zisser. The private sector has a significant role to play in such specialised areas. The hospital will not only boost medical facilities in the city but will also generate a lot of direct and indirect employment in the sector. This kind of a hospital is not only the first of its kind in the city but also perhaps in the entire country, Bhattacharjee said after the signing.

 The first phase of the Neotia Elbit Hospital, with 500 beds and a capital investment of $230 million (approximately Rs 1,000 crore), is expected to be complete by 2010. This is the largest private investment by Israel in India and the fast-growing, carefully-guided development policy of West Bengal was largely instrumental in Calcutta getting the nod, the ambassador told Metro.

 The pact with the Israeli firm is to develop a chain of multi-speciality tertiary hospitals in the country. Zisser felt the city has the IQ, know-how and the biggest need for a project of this magnitude. If the concept works in Calcutta, we will replicate the model in 18-20 different centres across the country, the EMI chairman declared. The total built-up area for the healthcare hub on the 25-acre plot close to Peerless Hospital will be 2.5 million sq ft. It will incorporate the R amp;D benefits from EMIs alliances with healthcare majors.

 We are truly delighted with this joint-venture and hope to be able to bring a world-class facility to Calcutta, said Neotia.

 EMI, which has majority stake in Insightec Ltd, a research and medical devices production company with technology for non-invasive ablation of tumours, will bring that knowhow to the Calcutta centre.

 It also holds controlling interest in Gamida Cell Ltd, a biotech research company, a world leader in the development of technology for expansion of cord-blood stem cells.

 This means Calcutta will become Asias first city to have non-invasive removal of uterine fibroids, liver and brain tumours and breast cancer, said Zissar.

 The biotech research centre, through the Gamida tieup, proposes to utilise stem-cell therapy for haematological malignancies, tissue repair and regeneration and stem-cell multiplication.

 Chinese tech tools, European fashion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta will soon be introduced to Chinese hardware products and European fashion technology, and leading lifestyle stores will open outlets here.

 Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company, a joint venture between the state government and the Peerless group, which is constructing Axis, one of the countrys largest shopping malls (total space more than 500,000 sq ft) in Rajarhat New Town, on Wednesday announced finalisation of deals with a number of national and global giants.

 A memorandum of understanding has been signed between Bengal Peerless and the Shanghai Centre for Scientific and Technological Exchange with Foreign Countries. The Shanghai facility will set up an information technology-related design centre at Axis, on 30,000 sq ft in Block A of the mall. The mall, a Rs 250-crore project, will house three blocks.

 ?All hardware products of various IT and design companies of Shanghai will be displayed here. They have invited us to take software products to Shanghai for sale,? said Kumar Shankar Bagchi, managing director of Bengal Peerless. According to the agreement, Bengal Peerless and the Shanghai centre will jointly organise seminars, conferences and other events. 

 The joint-venture housing company has also signed an agreement with Pyramid Retails, a leading lifestyle department store. Pyramid will set up shop on 50,000 sq ft on the ground floor of Block B. 

 The company, which has a presence in Mumbai and Delhi, among other cities, will sell apparel, fashion jewellery, perfumes and cosmetics, watches, leather goods and sunglasses.

 ?In the past few years, Calcutta?s lifestyle has undergone a sea change, making it one of the most exciting destinations for investment,? M.K. Rai, Pyramid?s head of business development, said over the phone from Mumbai. At least three other department stores in other city malls are planned.

 Globus, another fashion apparel and accessories retail chain, will set up its store at Axis on 15,000 sq ft. 

 ?We are also taking space at Lake Mall, in south Calcutta. The city has enough potential target customers and we will set at least four stores here,? said V. Nadkarni, chief executive officer of Globus. 

 ?Our aim is to provide both high-end and medium-range products at the mall,? Bagchi said. 

 About a lakh square feet will be dedicated to European products. ?French companies are showing interest in showcasing their fashion, apparel and other products,? he indicated.

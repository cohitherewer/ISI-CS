The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of faulty pumps and high tide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What crippled Calcutta throughout Wednesday after a deluge at dawn? A combination of poor pumping and high tide was the verdict at the end of a long hours spent wading through water.

 The city north of Esplanade suffered the most, from Amherst Street to Sinthee, Paikpara to Cossipore, Jorasanko to Bagbazar, Phoolbagan to Dum Dum Road, matched only by the low-lying eastern pockets of Topsia, Tiljala and Kasba, under water till late on Wednesday.

 The failure on the part of the civic authorities to operate all the pumps in its 19 pumping stations was the prime cause for the prolonged waterlogging.

 The Tallah Park-Belgachhia area was inundated for long hours due to the malfunctioning of the Maniktala pumping station, where of the four pumps, only two could be pressed into operation.

 The Bagmari-VIP Road area remained waterlogged for over seven hours as the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) could not operate the pumping station due to ongoing repairs.

 Residents of Chiria More, Dum Dum Road, VIP Road, Tallah Park, Ultadanga and Bagmari were marooned. 

 The cause: malfunctioning of the drainage pumping stations at Ultadanga, Maniktala and VIP Road.

 ?We have never seen such waterlogging in over 50 years that we have been here in the Tallah Park area,? alleged resident Tarun Saha.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who returned to the city late on Tuesday after a 10-day foreign tour, was greeted by harsh words from residents of Bagbazar and Sovabazar, frustrated by the waters refusing to recede.

 The civic officials chose to pin most of the blame on natural causes. The Bagjola canal, they pointed out, was flowing two feet higher than the level of the Bangur and Noapara pumping stations.

 Civic body chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose said pumping operations had been held up for about five hours due to a high tide in the Hooghly, from 9 am to 1.20 pm.

 Irrigation department executive engineer Goutam Chatterjee said the drainage canals of Bagjola, Kestopur and Chitpur ? the backbone of the drainage system in the north ? were all connected either with the Hooghly or the Vidyadhari rivers, that were in high tide on Wednesday morning.

 Con woman in net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman in her mid-40s was arrested on Tuesday on charges of duping several people.

 Parna Guha, a resident of BB Chatterjee Road, in Kasba, was picked up from her office on Manoharpukur Road on a complaint lodged by a businessman. 

 ?We are not sure how many people fell into her trap, but it seems the amount she made from her victims will not be less than a crore,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 The businessman whose complaint led to Parna?s arrest came to know about her from an advertisement she put in a daily. It read: ?Want a loan up to a crore? Contact me.?

 Apart from him, several others came to her office seeking loans. The applicants were asked to submit three per cent of the loan amount as security deposit, which they did. ?But none received a loan,? said an officer working on the case.

 Moments after rounding up Parna, a postgraduate in commerce, officers of the detective department realised she had also duped a jewellery shop-owner of Rs 5.76 lakh. 

 The owner, Sanjay Dugar, had complained that on October 10 last year, a woman had come to his shop on Ashutosh Mukherjee Road and selected ornaments worth Rs 5.76 lakh. 

 She wrote out a cheque for the amount and took away the jewellery. A few days later, Dugar was informed that the cheque had bounced. After interrogating Parna, the sleuths were convinced that she was the woman Dugar had referred to in the complaint.

 Parna had recently opened the Manoharpukur Road office ? M/S New Dynamic Research Centre ? and employed three persons.

 Soon after, she had issued an advertisement offering roles in television soaps and films. ?She used to charge Rs 500 for each audition and this was going on for the past five months,? deputy commissioner Singh said.

 Elaborating on her style of functioning, Singh said Parna carried herself well and could easily earn the confidence of her potential victims. ?She would pretend she was from a rich family. Fluent in English, Hindi and Bengali, she was very articulate and could impress people even during a brief conversation.?

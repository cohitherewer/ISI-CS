The city is to get another lounge bar shortly. But 

its owner insists its different. There is a dearth of serious lounges 

in the city and Calcutta still mixes up the nightclub and lounge concept. We are 

here to focus on the latter, a segment that the city still hasnt mastered, 

says Anjan Kumar Mitra, business head Jasmine Commercials Ltd, (Eastern India 

franchisee, Copper Chimney) talking about their latest venture, Copper Lounge, 

set to open its shutters on November 7.

Set up in Jasmine Tower at 31 Shakespeare Sarani, 

Copper Lounge is right on top of Copper Chimney. Spread over 2,000 sq ft, the 

set-up is clean and classy. After a hard days work, the serious drinker 

can enjoy a good ambience, light talk, good music and savour his drink, 

says Mitra. The target crowd is executive, young and mobile, he adds.

While wooden flooring exudes warmth, the use of glass 

creates the feel of space. The colour story revolves around brick red, pristine 

white and brown with bits of purple here and there. The highlight is thread-like 

cascading curtains.

Cosy off-white sofas and coffee-bean coloured low 

seaters have been thrown in with tables with frosted glass tops. The lighting 

is a rainbow concept, switching from violet to indigo, blue and green. Spread 

over 300 sq ft is the space for private and corporate parties. 

The bar is well stocked with coolers, mocktails, shooters, 

cognac, tequila, wines and liqueurs. The food corner boasts tandoori and Chinese 

options. While individual dishes are tagged at Rs 85-plus, combo meals cost between 

Rs 155 and Rs 175.

The music zone will focus on western compositions. 

DJ Modjo will churn out music three days a week. Currently we are looking 

at a turnover of Rs 5 lakh a month, Mitra signs off. 

Soul sounds

Sporting shoulder-length curls and trendy casuals, 

these two GenX musicians may look really at home in a rock band. But their choice 

of instruments is not the guitar or drums, but the santoor and tabla.

Rahul Sharma and percussionist Bickram Ghosh had much 

in common and yet had never met. Fifty years after their fathers, Pandit Shiv 

Kumar Sharma and Pandit Shankar Ghosh, played together, these new-age musicians 

hailing from a strictly classical background have come together for the first 

time.

The result is Interface The Other Side Of Fusion, 

an album with a new-age sound drawn from a purely classical base.

Interface is a fusion of traditional 

Indian classical music with a lot of pop sounds and an innovative use of drums 

and other percussion instruments, says Bickram. 

The duo performed to a rapt audience at Taj Bengal 

on Monday evening where the album was launched by Sare gama chief Sanjeev Goenka.

The everlasting appeal of classical music gives 

the artist a sense of perpetuity, but it does not allow him to leave his signature, 

points out Bickram.

Trying to dispel myths about fusion sounds, Rahul 

says: It is not about gimmicks but more about creating a distinct sound.

Though new-age music has a lot of appeal among the 

younger generation, classical music has still not lost its charm. While 

we started with the basics before experimenting, the younger generation is hooked 

on to newer sounds before slowly moving on to the classical, says Rahul.

Rahul is not really worried about the future of classical 

music. The tradition will continue as long as there are torchbearers, 

he assures. Now looking forward to his album Ladakh Search for Buddha 

to be released on November 15 and the second part of The Confluence with 

Richard Clayderman, Rahul is poised to score music for a couple of Hindi films.

Bickram is also set to make music for two new Bengali 

films while working on albums like the second edition of Rhythmscape and 

Jams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Help to learn life?s lessons

 MADHUMITA DAS

 In the wake of the Mumbai blasts on July 7, disaster management is a hot topic. It is to address this issue that Scientology Volunteer Ministers (SVMs) will be conducting a training session on disaster management in Calcutta.

 Scientology conjures up images of an obscure cult, with members like Tom Cruise rubbishing post-natal depression. But 20 top men from the state government?s home and civil defence department will be at the course, from July 17-28. 

 Scientology was founded by author L. Ron Hubbard, to arm people to deal with their lives better, reduce dependence on doctors and drugs and aid physical recovery. Disaster management is a significant contribution of scientology, with successful handling of cases from 9/11 to the tsunami. They are now keen to pass on the secrets of their success. 

 ?We primarily ensure that people learn how to learn, so that life?s lessons don?t pass you by,? says Marian Whitta, director of Scientology Goodwill India Tour. Training has been imparted to disaster teams worldwide. In September 2005, Whitta and her team trained 65 personnel from Delhi Police. This caught the attention of minister for home and civil defence Shrikumar Mukherjee. 

 ?Our current crisis training does not prepare officers psychologically. This void was always felt. In 2001, I was involved in the train accident in Gaisal, where 295 people died. I wanted to rescue a man crying for help. We saved many lives, but he died before we could get to him. The incident left a deep impression on me. I want my team to be better prepared,? Mukherjee says. 

 He is sending 18 senior men from civil defence and two Metro Railway officers to attend the sessions and then train other members of their squad. 

 This will be the first time that Metro will collaborate with a civil defence programme. Mukherjee explains: ?Metro is a high-intensity, disaster-prone zone. If there is a blast, Metro Railway will not be able to undertake rescue work for lack of specialised staff. After this training, we plan to instal four expert volunteers at every station.?

 Making it happen is director of scientology, West Bengal, Md Khalil Ullah. He runs free schools, NGOs, as well as a disaster mitigation team of 80 volunteers. ?My tryst with scientology is just six months old. I hope to pass on the knowledge,? he says.

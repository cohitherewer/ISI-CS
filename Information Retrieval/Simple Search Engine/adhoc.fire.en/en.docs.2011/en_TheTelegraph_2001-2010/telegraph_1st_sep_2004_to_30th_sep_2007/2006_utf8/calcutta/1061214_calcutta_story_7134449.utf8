 Portrait of a city

 Capturing the moods of the city of Calcutta, the paintings of Somenath Maity reveal the artists keen observation of the sparkle and gloss of metropolitan areas on the one hand and the dingy squalor of slum-life on the other. His early works, which were drawing based, had a definite expressionist character. Using pen-and-ink and charcoal with occasional smudges of colour, he produced large pictorial surfaces depicting urban anarchy and clutter, yet, with complete, deliberate absence of human figures. His later works, however, show enormous confidence in his application of bold, startling colours. Romantic and luminous, they express, despite their nostalgic, haunting quality, emotions like joy, wonder and ecstasy. The city, abstractly visualised as a many-layered archaeological ruin, nevertheless evokes a calm assurance of abiding reality. The ongoing exhibition of Maitys works binds his old and new paintings together into a pure celebration of forms and colours.

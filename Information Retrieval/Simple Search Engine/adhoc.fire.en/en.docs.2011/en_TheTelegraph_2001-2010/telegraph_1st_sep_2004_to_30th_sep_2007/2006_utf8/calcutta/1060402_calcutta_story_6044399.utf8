The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An all-rounder on a mission

 Shaan, one of the singers for Jamal Shaikh?s label, performs in the city

 He is originally from Dhaka. He is now based in New Jersey. He has an American music label. He composes and writes in Bangla. He has a fashion label based in Bangkok. This may sound straight out of Forrest Gump but then Jamal Shaikh wasn?t born with a box of chocolates!

 Having lost his son to medical negligence in Bangladesh in the early 1980s, Jamal shifted to the US before setting up his own music label, Ocean Records. 

 ?We released a lot of Bengali albums and people there just lapped it up,? says Jamal, passing through town on Saturday. ?Then I thought of coming back to India to set up another base here.?

 Tying up with the Ruia Brothers in Mumbai, Jamal created the Indian arm, Ocean Entertainment, last October. Within four months of its launch, the new independent label has released 10 albums and is set to unleash seven more by April-end.

 ?My whole idea is to bring back the melodies of Hemanta Mukherjee and S. D. Burman, something which has got lost due to modern music,? says Jamal. ?All the revenues generated from my albums are going to the hospital I am setting up in Jessore. I don?t want more children dying due to lack of treatment or wrong treatment.?

 The albums, mostly Bengali song compilations, have been sung by some of the top names in Indian music ? Abhijeet, Shaan, Shreya Ghoshal and Arnab Chakraborty. 

 Arnab, who struck gold with the Khakee number Wada raha was also at The Park on Saturday for the Calcutta launch of Ocean Entertainment.

 ?It?s a great honour and privilege to be singing for a cause,? says Arnab, whose Katra katra track in Family ? Ties of Blood became a chartbuster recently. ?If I can cater to the needs of some unfortunate people through my singing, it?s truly a great feeling,? adds the Bengali boy who is currently working on his first Indipop album.

 For Jamal, his albums are also a creative exploration, writing and composing for most of the tracks. ?When I write my songs, I insist I compose them and similarly when I compose I put the words,? he explains. ?That way, I am in control of my music and do not let other people intervene with their thought processes.?

 After producing a few music videos to promote the new lot of Bengali albums ? the return to roots Phire Esho, the patriotic Bishwa Ekti and the romantic Tumi Ki Bojhona ? Jamal will soon be releasing a Hindi album titled The Lovers.

 ?We have zeroed in on the tunes and will get some known Mumbai artistes to render the tracks,? he says. ?We have been successful with the Bengali albums but Hindi will be a different ball game.?

 When it?s not music, it?s fashion designing for Jamal. ?I have set up an office in Bangkok and we send clothes to places like Vietnam,? he reveals. ?But I really want to set up a boutique in Calcutta since I believe that language is the real religion and I will always be a Bengali.?

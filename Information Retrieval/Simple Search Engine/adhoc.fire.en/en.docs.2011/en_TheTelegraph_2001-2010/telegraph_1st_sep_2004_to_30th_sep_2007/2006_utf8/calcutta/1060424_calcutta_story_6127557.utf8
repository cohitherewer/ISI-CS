 Varsity tips for street lights

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities have tied up with the illumination engineering department of Jadavpur University (JU) for an overhaul of street lights.

 JU has developed a ?road-lighting software? and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has given it permission to use the city?s roads for the field study. 

 The university, after the field study, will send the software for verification to the US and Germany.

 Justifying the tie-up, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: ?The CMC has adopted a policy of involving academic institutions in all development activities. I think any attempt at image makeover will be futile unless it is based on thorough academic research.?

 A group of postgraduate students of illumination engineering, under professor Biswanath Roy, has completed a pilot project at Panchasayar, in Jadavpur, and found wide-ranging deviation in illumination from the national lighting code of the Indian Standard Institution (ISI).

 ?We found out during the field study at Panchasayar that luminance in all categories ? average, minimum and maximum ? was much higher than what the ISI code has specified,? pointed out Roy. The tilt of the fittings, too, was incorrect, resulting in improper distribution of light. In some cases, the ?maximum lighted area? was the grassy strip beside a road, not the road surface. 

 Uneven distribution of light, warned civic officials, causes a ?zebra effect?, which is dangerous for motorists.

 The JU team has also found that street lights glow dimly in evening, when maximum illumination is required, because of low voltage.

 This should be rectified, professor Roy suggested, by installing timers on lamp posts.

 Roy, also a member of the working committee of ISI?s national lighting code, said the code for street lights is 36 years old and should be revised. The software developed by the university, he hoped, would come in handy in the revision exercise.

 Optimum distribution of light on the road surface cuts power bills and helps prevent accidents. If roads are properly lit at night, motorists can drive without switching on headlights.

 Headlights not only consume battery power, but also blind drivers coming from the opposite direction, he pointed out.

 The university team is now broadening its area of study, which will finally cover the entire city. ?We will approach the police commissioner, as traffic diversion for some hours may be necessary in carrying out the luminance study on some busy roads,? he added.

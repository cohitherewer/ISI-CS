 Lunge constable identified

 - Suspension for demanding bribe awaits absconding cop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 One of the Reserve Force constables who had allegedly hurled abuse and made a lunge at 26-year-old Tanushree Ghosh in front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation office for being denied a bribe of Rs 650, is ?absconding?.

 Five days after the incident, senior officers of Calcutta Police on Wednesday identified Swapan Singha of the Reserve Force as one of the two constables. ?Preliminary investigation revealed that Singha was involved in the incident. But his whereabouts are not known since Tuesday night. He will be suspended if found guilty,? stated deputy commissioner (central division) Ajoy Ranade. 

 A senior officer at Lalbazar said departmental action would also be taken against Singha for his ?unauthorised absence?. ?His sudden disappearance indicates his involvement in the case,? the officer observed.

 The deputy commissioner added: ?I had asked the constable to meet me by 5 pm today to find out if he had anything to say in his defence. But he did not turn up. As soon as his whereabouts are known, the complainant will be called for an identification parade. If Tanushree Ghosh recognises him, he will be placed under suspension.?

 According to an investigating officer of New Market police station, Singha stays in a rented room in north Calcutta. ?Our officers went to his house but he was not there. He could not be traced till evening. Singha is absconding as he is guilty.?

 Singha was not among the 11 Reserve Force constables deployed in front the civic headquarters main gate on Friday. ?He was posted at SN Banerjee Road but had gone there along with another constable to get his palms greased,? the officer claimed. He stressed that the other constable was not involved in the incident.

 Deputy commissioner (Reserve Force) H.K. Kusumakar said departmental proceedings would soon be started against Singha. ?I have got a letter from New Market police station and we will produce Singha for an identification parade.? He refused to comment on the constable?s disappearance.

 Cry against crime leaves trader killed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A small-time trader was murdered on Sunday night by a group of goons in Howrah, as the fallout of a quarrel between the gang members and local residents.

 Police said Soumen De, 27, a resident of Chandmari, Netajinagar, was attacked with bricks and razors while returning home from work. 

 His head was smashed and there were several injury marks all over his body, the police later said. 

 Soumen, who used to supply gift items to shops for a living, succumbed to his injuries at Medical College and Hospital at around 2 am on Monday.

 ?Preliminary investigations suggest that an old rivalry was the motive behind the attack. So far, four local youths ? Sujoy Sarkar, Rabi De, Bijoy Das and Nengti Buro ? have been arrested in connection with the case. Five others have been detained for questioning,? Kalyan Banerjee, Howrah?s additional superintendent of police (town), said on Monday.

 According to local residents, trouble started a few days ago when Soumen?s brother Ramen, a member of the local resistance group, picked a fight with a youth while he was on night patrol. 

 He was then beaten up by the goons, said a neighbour. Later, a meeting of the residents of the area was called to resolve the dispute. 

 At the meeting, the family members of the youths who had beaten up Ramen were asked to give undertakings that their children would behave themselves in the future. 

 ?This, perhaps, humiliated the youths and they decided to take it out on the De family,? said an officer of Bally police station.

 On Sunday night, the men reportedly gathered near a football ground of a local club. Around 11 pm, the gang accosted Soumen while he was returning home on his bicycle. They forcefully took him to the spot where they usually gathered to drink.

 Soon, the goons started raining blows on Soumen. ?They smashed his head with bricks and slashed him with razors,? a police official said. 

 Local people heard Soumen?s cries and rushed out of their homes. The assailants fled the spot before they arrived. ?We saw Soumen lying in a pool of blood with his face severely disfigured. He was writhing in pain,? said a witness.

 ?Soumen was a quiet and nice person. He had to pay the price for protesting against criminal activities in the area,? lamented one of the neighbours.

 The slow pace of revamp of the city?s drainage system has prompted mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to set up a task force, in consultation with the state irrigation department and Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP), that will help expedite work.

 The task force will survey the clogged Tollygunge-Panchannagram (TP) channel on Wednesday and identify immediate revamp measures to ensure that it serves its purpose ? draining out water ? during monsoon.

 The CEIP, funded by the Asian Development Bank, had issued a Rs 6-crore work order to the irrigation department four months ago to clean up the 26.5-km TP channel, the main outflow route in south Calcutta. Work has not yet started.

 About two-thirds of the channel is blocked with silt, which the irrigation department is supposed to scoop out. The civic authorities want the clean-up to be carried out before the monsoon to prevent waterlogging in several areas in the south.

 The task force includes chief engineer in the irrigation department Sadhan Biswas, chief civic engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose, special officer of traffic infrastructure development Nikhil Samanta and director-general (project) Uday Sankar Sengupta.

 At the instance of the mayor and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, the irrigation department has also agreed to take a number of short-term measures to prevent waterlogging in low-lying pockets across the city.

 These are:

 Repairing, desilting 

 the old sluice gate in Kestopur canal

 Removal of blockages in 

 Kata khal, beside Basanti Road, in the Dhapa area

 Restoration of normal 

 flow in Tolly?s Nullah by June 15 (Metro Railway has given 

 money for the work)

 Widening of Charial khal, 

 beside Diamond Harbour Road

 Setting up of temporary 

 pumping units along Charial khal 

 Cleaning of Ghusighata 

 khal.

 According to irrigation department engineers, the city would face less waterlogging this year if these measures are taken before the monsoon.

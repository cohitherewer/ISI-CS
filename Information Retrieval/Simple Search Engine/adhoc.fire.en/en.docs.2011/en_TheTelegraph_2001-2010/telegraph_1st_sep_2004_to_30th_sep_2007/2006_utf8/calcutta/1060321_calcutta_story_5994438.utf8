The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To and from sir, with love

 A touch of blush: Children 

 of Nivedita Mission English-medium school, in Behala, 

 celebrated Holi on March 15 with singer Snigdha Mitra 

 The students and staff of our 

 school put up a special programme at the farewell of our 

 principal, M.C. Alexander, on February 10. He served the 

 institution for more than 30 years, from when it started 

 on January 1, 1974. No wonder, for most of us he is still 

 an inseparable part of our lives.

 At the function, the junior school students presented him with flowers and then performed a song and dance item. The school management gifted him a cheque as a token of their love and respect for him.

 The principal in his address recounted how as a child he had faced a lot of difficulties in pursuing studies after the death of his parents. At the end of the programme, he generously donated his gift cheque to the management for the benefit of a needy student.

 We will all miss you Sir.

 Telly terror

 Adie, my 12- year-old brother, is an ardent fan of, or is rather addicted to, a particular television show in which some men flaunting their huge tattooed biceps brutally beat up each other and then get applauded in the name of entertainment. For quite sometime now, an increased level of aggression is discernible in his behaviour. We often receive calls from our neighbours complaining about his conduct. He either comes back home with a scar or sends back his friends with a swell. These traits are, however, found among most children who watch more violent shows on the telly.

 Violent scenes that children are most likely to follow or play out in real life are the ones in which they identify with the perpetrator of the violence. It is a scientific fact that exposure to violent imagery results in increased heart rate and high blood pressure. Researches have also proven that children on a diet of violent entertainment are more likely to get into trouble with the law as teenagers. As adults, they are more often convicted of use of violence on their spouses and children.

 It is rather ironical that the media, which is entrusted with the responsibility of bringing about social welfare, is partly responsible for the present trend. Parents also need to make the children aware of the dangers of being exposed to media violence.

 The Diary

 The end

 Incisive words 

 Sharp as swords 

 A decisive mind 

 One of a kind 

 An impure soul, 

 A finite goal 

 Delirious haste 

 Delicious taste 

 Thoughts astray, 

 Let?s call it a day. 

 Two hearts need mending 

 ....an abrupt ending.

 Class XI, Modern High School for Girls

 An evening in Chandni Chowk

 Choked dry of words, this cold 

 winter day

 It was warm in the subway

 The stifling heat of huddled togetherness

 The cold wind braced me in the street,

 The crowd on the parade ground now dispersed

 Wry faces litter the street, 

 Flags flapping on their sleeves

 Placards in hands, drifting into the mist;

 A frail network of naked twigs

 Black streaks like ink-marks 

 Etched across the distant haze, 

 My senses like frost-bitten flesh 

 Shrink from the prick of things, 

 This discordant junk

 Where nothing to nothing relates; 

 Yet, somewhere beneath the fabric of conscious 

 Some latent force weaves

 A kind of cryptic sense,

 To toss and tumble on dark waters

 Cut across the murk and grease

 Clamber out on hands and knees

 To re-hash dead matter

 To feel the pulse beneath.

 Is it wrong?

 You close doors to me who loves 

 you

 If sound of remembrance at haunting hours of navel night

 Disrupts your sleep

 Is it wrong?

 And you lock doors

 Every neckless night worse than last

 To wait for snake charming sleep

 Of waking nightmares

 And you lock doors

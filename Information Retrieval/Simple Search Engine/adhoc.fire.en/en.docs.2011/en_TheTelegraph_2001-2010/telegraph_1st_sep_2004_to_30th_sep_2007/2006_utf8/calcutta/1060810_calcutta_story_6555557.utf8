 Syllabus shift at IT cradles

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Realising that the information technology (IT) sectors dream run in the state might hit a human resources hurdle, the government is working on a proposal to revamp the IT and software curriculum followed by colleges and universities.

 Topics like enterprise resource planning (ERP) and system analysis are already in the curriculum, but the teaching modules need to be structured to meet industry requirements. The engineering colleges and technical institutes should act accordingly, said state IT minister Debesh Das.

 Das, himself a computer science professor at Jadavpur University, wants to facilitate the process by organising industry-academia interaction.

 Top-notch executives from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) and IBM will sit with academicians from colleges under the West Bengal University of Technology, Calcutta University (CU), Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU), Shibpur, among others.

 The proposals on curriculum change will be forwarded to the higher education department for implementation, added Das, explaining the roadmap he is drawing up to increase employability of the students enrolled in over 50 engineering colleges in the state.

 The first such meeting is scheduled for August-end, where the participants will try and identify areas in which IT education in Bengal needs to be upgraded.

 According to Das, availability of employable engineering graduates is the biggest challenge facing the fledgling industry, growing at a rate of over 72 per cent in the state.

 The government is also joining hands with Infosys to provide technical inputs and resources to improve infrastructure in institutes.

 The government and Infosys will launch an initiative, Campus Connect, through WBUT. Infosys will provide free laptops, digital library resources and access to technology-related information to students in WBUT colleges. We are finalising the list of colleges that will join the programme, said Ashoke Thakur, WBUT vice-chancellor.

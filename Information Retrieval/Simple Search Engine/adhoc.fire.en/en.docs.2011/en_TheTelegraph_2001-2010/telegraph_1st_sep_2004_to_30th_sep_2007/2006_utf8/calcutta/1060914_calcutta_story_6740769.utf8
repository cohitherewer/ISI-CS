The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Its your birthday, so...

 Youre a diligent, independent worker who prefers doing things solo. Neither young nor old, moving steadily, charming everyone, past and present seem to come together in you. Others admire your strengths, your talents, your distinctive style and your good deeds. Youre not scared of splurging because you enjoy good things, but try to stick to a budget. Kusum Bhandari

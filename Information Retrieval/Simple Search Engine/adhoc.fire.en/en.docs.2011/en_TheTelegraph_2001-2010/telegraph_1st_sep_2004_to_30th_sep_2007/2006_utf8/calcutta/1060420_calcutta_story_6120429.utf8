The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City focus in football fare

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two dedicated teams in Germany at each match venue, pre and post-match shows with experts and stars in Singapore, and a team travelling across India to map the soccer craze. 

 That?s the line-up ESPN STAR Sports is banking on to deliver the goods for FIFA World Cup 2006. 

 And soccer-crazy Calcutta will be in strong focus.

 ?It?s an amazing property and since the matches will be beamed on prime time, we expect viewership ratings to be 50 to 60 per cent higher than the last World Cup,? said R.C. Venkateish, managing director of ESPN Software India. 

 ESPN and STAR Sports will beam all the matches of the tournament live.

 Anand Narsimhan, Dave Roberts and Jason Dasey will lead the teams in Germany. ESPN?s Singapore studios will play host to soccer experts like Steve McMahon, Harsha Bhogle and Gerry Armstrong, who will be joined by past and present stars from Calcutta like P.K. Banerjee and Bhaichung Bhutia. 

 Special World Cup programming on the two channels includes Born to Play, profiling some of the major players over the years like Pele and Ronaldinho. FIFA Marathon will capture the best moments and controversies of the World Cup and FIFA Official Films will draw from the FIFA archives.

 ?There will be an emphasis on the weightage of resources as the scale of activities will be larger in the east,? Venkateish said about ESPN?s Calcutta focus.

 The marketing activities will also kick off from the city, with trade shows featuring dance, music and football. Large-scale screenings will be held.

 World Cup soccer will be a prime revenue earner for ESPN STAR Sports, that has not won the rights to Team India cricket for some time now.

 ?But with India travelling November 2006 onwards, we will have a lot of cricket featuring India in the near future. Besides, the viewer looks at the breadth and quality of sports coverage and not just cricket,? Venkateish offered. 

 He also disagreed that sharing the World Cup matches with Doordarshan would have any effect on the ratings.

 ?We?re happy with the list of non-cricket events that the government has put down for simulcasting. But for cricket, we are still pushing for the window of exclusivity,? he added.

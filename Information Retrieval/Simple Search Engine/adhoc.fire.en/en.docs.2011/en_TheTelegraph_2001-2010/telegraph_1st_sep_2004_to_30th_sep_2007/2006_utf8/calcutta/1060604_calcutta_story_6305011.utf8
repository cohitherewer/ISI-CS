 Canvas call at culinary den

 The quaint munch and music stop on Calcuttas food street is set to foray into the finer arts. Trincas, the place that had Pam Craine, Louis Banks and the Uthup sisters performing live in the 1960s, will now showcase the works of Sheila Kapur, Shipra Bhattacharya, Eleena Banik, Shyamasree Basu, Anita Ray Choudhury and other women artists to add to the Epicurean experience.

 So while you chill out with a Bloody Mary or savour a Chicken Stroganoff, you could also debate the finer points of an abstract or a still life.

 The central dining hall at Trincas will have a gallery feel on Sunday with the exhibits at eye level on the wrought-iron divider as well as on the walls and a few up on easels. 

 The diners will not only get a close view of the canvas, they can even interact with the creators.

 For artist Shyamasree Basu, exhibiting at Trincas seems to turn the clock back, with a difference.

 I used to visit Trincas in the 1960s with my husband and hear Pam Craine perform? It would be interesting to see how a centre of western culture hosts such a show.

 Called Art for Sight, the exhibition by women artists has a cause: proceeds will go to HelpAge for eye care of the disadvantaged elderly 

 But it is not just charity that Trincas has in mind this Sunday. Close on the heels of Jamai Shashti, the day of the sons-in-law celebrated in Bengal, June 4 has been earmarked as Boumashtami by the restaurant.

 If the jamais had a time of their lives on Friday, its the turn of the boumas on Sunday, proclaim the Puris of Trincas.

 All the guys in my office asked to be released early on Friday for them to be feted at their in-laws, says Shashi Puri. So we thought it was time for the daughters-in-law to be feted as well.

 A select guest list of boumas, their hubbies in tow, will have a special buffet lunch spread to choose from. And since Trincas can never give music a miss, Jatugriha will take the stage on Sunday afternoon.

 But the idea of Boumashtami doesnt find favour with some of our women artists.

 I do not believe in strident womens liberty. While women are a strength by themselves, they along with men form a strong social fabric, feels Sukti Subhra Pradhan, whose work Strength celebrates woman-power but does not take away her femininity.

 Anita Ray Choudhury also isnt sure women really want a Boumashtami. I agreed to give my work for charity rather than get involved in the celebrations, she said. Her painting Nirjash depicts the essence of beauty.

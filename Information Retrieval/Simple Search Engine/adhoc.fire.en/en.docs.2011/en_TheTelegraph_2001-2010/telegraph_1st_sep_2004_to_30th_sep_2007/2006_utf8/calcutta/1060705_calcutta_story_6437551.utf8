The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mumbai drencher ruled out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 On a day when Mumbai went under water, Met officials said there was ?little chance? of heavy rains in Calcutta and the south Bengal districts in the next two or three days.

 Met officials contacted in Pune and Nagpur during the day said: ?The monsoon became vigorous on Tuesday over Maharashtra after a depression that had crossed over from the Bay of Bengal to Orissa shifted to Chhattisgarh. This moving away of the depression has reduced chances of heavy rain in the city in the next two to three days. But there will be light to moderate rain.?

 Weathermen said though the monsoon over Calcutta was ?active?, the current was not strong enough to cause heavy rainfall.

 ?When the monsoon current is strong in the western part, it is relatively weak in the east. After a few days, when the monsoon current over Mumbai weakens, it is expected to grow stronger over Calcutta,? a Met official explained.

 Flights hit: The Mumbai 

 flight of Jet Airways, scheduled to leave Calcutta at 1.50 

 pm, was cancelled and combined with the 3.40 pm flight. 

 The Jet flight from Mumbai, scheduled to reach here at 7.10 

 pm, was also cancelled and combined with the next flight.

 The Indian (airlines) flight scheduled to leave Mumbai at 6.30 pm was delayed by over two hours, an official said. Air Sahara?s Calcutta-Mumbai 4.45 pm flight was cancelled and combined with the 7.50 pm one. The Mumbai-Calcutta flight scheduled to arrive at 10.45 pm was cancelled.

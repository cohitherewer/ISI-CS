 The black-and-white tone is not the only novelty in Rituparno Ghosh?s Dosar; the director has also deviated from the trademark style of using music in his films. The task to compose the minimalist score for the film largely dominated by silence was assigned to 21 Grams, a newly formed English band.

 ?Rituda wanted to do something totally different for Dosar. It?s a black-and-white film set in today and that is where we came in. We are more into new-age alternative music and so it was a huge challenge for us,? says Sanjoy Das from the music group that took shape just before Dosar happened.

 The band has borrowed its name from the Sean Penn-Naomi Watts-Benicio Del Toro-starrer 21 Grams. ?We liked the name and the concept in the film which says that at the time of death, the heart loses its weight by 21 grams for a few moments, which could be the weight of the soul,? smiles Sanjoy.

 The band features Sanjoy on drums, Rajiv Sunam on vocals, Sumit Ramachandran on guitar, Raja Narayan Deb on keyboards, Nitin Mani on bass guitar and Nirmalya Dey on flute.

 For the band, using silence and controlling emotions formed a big part of learning to score film music. So the focus of the score in this tale of emotional strife between a straying husband and his devoted wife was mainly on the beginning and end titles. The ?third theme? involved the scenes showing Konkona?s internal conflict, for which the group used a monotonous refrain.

 ?While scoring background music for a film, it?s most important to know what the director is thinking,? says Sanjoy. ?For the car crash scene, we were trying something dark, but Rituda suggested that we celebrate life. So we used a kind of music that is neither shehnai nor bagpipe, which gives a very uncanny feel. We used this theme for all the dark scenes.? Guitar, piano and ?a bit of voice? formed the mainstay of the score.

 The team is currently recording the music for Rituparno?s upcoming release Khela, starring Prosenjit, Manisha Koirala and Raima Sen. Following a film-maker zipping through the terrains of north Bengal, the film will have music that is light and has a lot of melody.

 ?It?s groovy, very acoustic and more western. The music of Dosar may fall flat without the film, but Khela can be heard separately,? stresses Sanjoy. One of the two songs, penned by Rituparno and composed by 21 Grams, is ?emotional?, while the other is racy, rhythmic and in sync with the fast-paced journey.

 Up next on the agenda of 21 Grams is a debut public performance and an album of Hindi songs accompanied by a video.

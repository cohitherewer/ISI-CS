 The picture of the pothole-riddled 

 Rajarhat Expressway should have shocked the chief minister 

 as much as it did everyone else (Cry over crater corridor, 

 October 19). The road is almost new and has hardly been 

 used. Not long back, it was a delight to take this road 

 to the airport because it was so smooth and free of snarls. 

 Now, it is nearly useless and dangerous. 

 Roads are a vital part of any development plan. They are the lifeline of a city. Monsoons put the construction of roads to test. It is unfortunate that the expressway, inaugurated in May 2004, could not last even two monsoons. 

 There is no option but to build the expressway afresh. Repair and patchwork will not do. The potholes will keep appearing every monsoon because the basic quality of the road is poor. 

 Leave alone foreign companies and Indian IT majors like Wipro, Infosys and Satyam, even second-grade firms are worried about the alarming condition of the expressway. The craters are not just eyesores but potentially life-threatening. It is surely the first nail in the coffin of New Town, Rajarhat. 

 Calcuttans have become so used to potholes that they only inspire macabre humour. I have heard people say that potholes should be sculpted so that they set right the dislocated bones of people driving over them. We have had enough. 

 Its time for some change now. The chief minister must focus on the basics giving up grandiose plans for the time being. Technology companies can wait, affordable healthcare is the need of the hour. Besides, medical tourism is as promising as information technology.

 Eye candy: A girl 

 in noodle straps invites gapes on the street. Picture 

 by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 The article The Noodle Strap Test, October 22, was marvellous. The expressions of the people staring at the model were worth a thousand words. They were looking at her as if she was from another planet. The photographer must be congratulated for a job well done. The model, too, deserves kudos for maintaining her composure under intense scrutiny.

 Women, hailing from different 

 strata of the society, have blamed men for ogling and passing 

 remarks at them. They should understand that god has created 

 man and woman for each other. How can women be enemies of 

 men? 

 Md. Moinuddin,

 Maybe inside every salwar kurta-clad 

 woman is another wanting to wear a noodle strap top. May 

 be quite a few of these women want to wear a bikini, too. 

 The question is: should they wear it on the street? A person 

 may feel a sexual urge in public. Should he or she fulfil 

 the urge right away? It is wrong to link modernity, development 

 and womens emancipation with wearing revealing clothes.

 Apropos the report Sleuths in black and white, October 21, it is pleasing that detective department officers have started wearing white shirts and black trousers. Their reason for doing so is even more commendable. The white shirt will definitely boost the morale of the force and instil in the officers a sense of responsibility, unity and discipline.

 The judiciary has at last woken up to reality (Clubbed suits for swift justice, October 23). To seek justice in courts has become a costly and frivolous exercise with lakhs of cases piling up. There must be guidelines for disposing of cases within a time frame. Otherwise, litigants will continue to suffer at the hands of greedy law practitioners. The archaic mindset and antique laws need to go.

 It is most unfortunate that being unable to bear the cost of treatment of newborn triplets, a poor father had to take the decision to sell one of the babies (Ailing triplets avert sell-off trap, October 19). Thankfully, an NGO lent him financial support. Acute poverty has robbed the peace and happiness of many families in our society. A handful of NGOs are their only ray of hope.

 Apropos the photograph of Shammi Kapoor (You share your birthday with, October 21), I was astonished to see the physical transformation of the Ya hoo matinee idol. Heres wishing him many happy returns of the day.

 Apropos the report Surprise check for pure gold, October 19, it is good to know that the Bureau of Indian Standards is going to carry out surprise checks at jewellery showrooms. Most of the time, customers buy gold ornaments in good faith. Even now, few shops sell hallmarked gold. This initiative will help identify the honest shops. Ideally, the checks should have been started before Dhanteras, when millions of people buy gold.

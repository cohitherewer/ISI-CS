 What: 

 Launch of new collection Obeisance by designer Rashi Vidhawan.

 Where: Her studio at 22P, Gorachand Road, near Park Circus.

 When: Wednesday afternoon.

 Take a look: A graduate from London College of Fashion in 2005, Rashi recently launched her own label called Vaarish (meaning desert rose). Obeisance is her spring-summer pret line that is influenced by the elemental style of clothing. The line draws inspiration from the five elements of nature and abides by the laws of nature.

 The look is sophisticated yet trendy, with minimal use of embroidery, a bit of texturing and smart cuts. The fabrics are georgettes, chiffons, linens, voile and jacquards. The colours range from sober shades like whites, ivory, beige and brown to brighter splashes of yellow, turquoise, red and coral. A lot of metal embellishments in silver and gold as well as some patchwork adorn the clothes.

 Pocket pinch: The western wear starts from Rs 1,500, while the ethnic range begins at Rs 3,500.

 Voiceover: Its a fresh look that caters to the young and trendy who are always on the lookout for new styles. The comfort factor is a priority and there are a lot of natural fabrics used. The look is simple yet classy, says Rashi.

 Spice route

 What: Goa on a Platter.

 Where: La Terrasse at The Oberoi Grand. 

 When: Till May 21, only for dinner.

 The spread: Hot and spicy, the spread whipped up by Ivo and Tereza Santos, all the way from Goa, is an array of authentic delicacies. Each item with its distinct flavour sets this additional a la carte Goan menu apart. Musicians accompanied by the gumot and guitar sing popular Goan melodies, creating the complete effect. Dressed in colourful printed shirts and hats, they have brought the Goa spirit alive at The Grand.

 One can start with appetisers like Peix-De-Recheado (pan-fried fillet of Bekti marinated with red chilli, cinnamon and clove), Formiyan-De-Verde (melange of vegetables with tomato-flavoured mayonnaise, served in tart shells) and Croquette-De-Galinha (semolina crusted chicken croquettes flavoured with ginger, coriander leaf and green chilli).

 The soup corner offers Calde-De-Verde (a light soup with green pea and spinach), Caldo-De-Cabrito (broth of lamb flavoured with celery and leek) and more.

 Move on to the main course with Galhina-De-Cafrael (pan-fried chicken in a marinade of fresh coriander, green chilli and mint), Xacuti-De-Cabrito (lamb cooked with pan-roasted coconut shaving and spices), Tamdi Bhaji (stir-fried red spinach with green chilli and coconut shaving), Aubergine Caril (brinjal curry with coconut milk, tomato, onion and cumin).

 To end on a sweet note, you can dig into desserts like Bebinca and Dodol.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 100.

 Voiceover: We are dishing out pure Goan food but have cut down on the spice content to cater to the Calcutta palate. To add authenticity, we have brought in spices specially from Goa, said chef Tereza Santos.

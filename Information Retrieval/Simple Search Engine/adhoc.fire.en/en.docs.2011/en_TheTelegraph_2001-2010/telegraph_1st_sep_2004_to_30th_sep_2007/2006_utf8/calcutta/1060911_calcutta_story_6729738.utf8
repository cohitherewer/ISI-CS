 September 11 and global terrorism have become synonymous and this year the National Geographic Channel wants to take you inside the mind of a terrorist through its 10-part series Nat Geo Investigates Terrorism. Premiering on Monday, at 10 pm, the new series will try to reveal the inside story of the deadliest terror attacks in the world.

 It is world war 3 and each one of us is on the frontline, says Joy Bhattacharjya, senior vice president of programming, National Geographic Channel, India. To defeat them first we must understand them and thats what our series focuses on. Our message is that India must fight back by being more alert, aware and responsible.

 Blending real footage, compelling 

 interviews of survivors and a first-hand account from a 

 potential suicide bomber, Nat Geo Investigates: Terrorism 

 features a special four-part mini-series called Inside 

 9/11. Marking five years of the tragedy, the mini-series 

 includes episodes like Bioterror Alert, Suicide Web, 

 Hostage TV and Al Qaeda Calling.

 But the real clincher is the first ever feature programme on the Kandahar episode, IC 814 Hijack, which relives the traumatic and politically explosive events that unfolded on ground and in air. This particular documentary has been produced by Miditech, the production company involved with game shows like Indian Idol.

 There can be so many films on the IC 814 hijack but we decided to concentrate on the trauma the passengers and crew went through on board the aircraft, Nikhil Alva, CEO of Miditech, tells Metro. We all keep talking about the negotiations and why Jaswant Singh had to go to Kandahar and how much money actually changed hands but we tend to forget what had happened inside the aeroplane those days. We met the people and the pilots who were there and their personal accounts make for a great watch.

 IC 814 Hijack, which will be shown on National Geographic Channel on September 18 at 10 pm, uses dramatic recreations, interviews with hostages, government negotiators and intelligence officials to take you back to the horror of January 2001. Many experts feel that the Kandahar episode was a test run for the 9/11 incident, adds Alva. Because at that point of time Osama bin Laden was actually in Kandahar and some believe that he was masterminding the negotiations. So, although one person was brutally murdered on board, we really got away cheaply.

 The channel believes that films like IC 814 Hijack will help viewers get a better view of global terror and stay better prepared. Says Rajesh Sheshadri, vice president marketing, National Geographic Channel, India: We are looking at promoting this series not only on air but also through radio, Internet and various on-ground activities. This series is a landmark event as it touches a topic which is pertinent to all.

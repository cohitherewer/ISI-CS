 Schools advised caution

 - Teachers fear tuition fee hike, pay freeze in DA grants refusal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The freedom versus funds face-off between Anglo-Indian schools and the state government took a fresh turn with teachers urging school authorities to take it easy.

 Teachers of Anglo-Indian schools in Calcutta met on Sunday and adopted a unanimous resolution asking their employers not to take a ?hasty decision? on refusing the dearness allowance (DA) grant from the state government.

 The teachers are opposed to any attempt to refuse DA grants, as that would result in a hike in tuition fees and a freeze on their pay-scales.

 The authorities of some of the institutions are said to be contemplating the refusal route following passage of the School Service Commission Act (Amendment) Bill in the Assembly last month.

 The bill makes it mandatory for state-aided minority schools to recruit teachers through the school service commission.

 A section of prominent Anglo-Indian schools has verbally informed its teachers that their DA will not be increased. ?This is an indication that the schools are heading towards refusing the DA grant, in an attempt to come out of the state government?s grip,? a spokesman for Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools said.

 ?The authorities have till now only expressed their willingness to freeze the DA, but even that is a dangerous signal,? added association president Ismail Nehal.

 At present, DA forms more than 50 per cent of the teachers? salary. ?The authorities of every school should examine the bill thoroughly,? said Dilip Bhattacharya, an ex-teacher of La Martiniere for Boys and the association general secretary. ?They should also talk to the government and clarify whether there is any plan to impose curbs on recruitment of teachers by schools which receive only the DA from the government,? he added.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas had clarified in the House that Anglo-Indian schools had been kept out of the bill?s purview, as they pay only the DA component of their teachers? salaries from the government grant.

 The amendment, he had said, is applicable only to those minority institutions that receive ?full assistance? from the government.

 Teachers of Anglo-Indian schools, however, claim that the bill does not reflect what the minister had said and demanded another amendment to clarify that their institutions will not come under the purview of the bill.

 Biswas has ruled out any further amendment.

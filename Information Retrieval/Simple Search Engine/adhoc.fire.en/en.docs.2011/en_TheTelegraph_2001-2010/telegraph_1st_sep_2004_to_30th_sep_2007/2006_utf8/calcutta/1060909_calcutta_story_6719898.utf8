The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 First fibroid clinic ahead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The citys first super-speciality fibroid clinic will be set up in three months time. 

 Bombay Endoscopy Academy and Centre for Minimally-Invasive Surgery (BEAMS) on Friday announced plans for a 16-bed unit in Calcutta. There will either be a tie-up with a private hospital in Calcutta or we may set up our own unit, said Rakesh Sinha, endoscopic surgeon and managing director of BEAMS. He said talks were on with a few hospitals for a possible tie-up.

 Fibroid, a solid tumour in or around the uterine wall, is a major factor for infertility and miscarriage. The symptoms are abnormal and heavy bleeding, severe pain in abdomen, miscarriage and difficulty in getting pregnant. 

 It is a common disease in women. Although not life-threatening, it can cause health hazards, said Om Tantia, medical director of Institute of Laparoscopic Surgery, Salt Lake.

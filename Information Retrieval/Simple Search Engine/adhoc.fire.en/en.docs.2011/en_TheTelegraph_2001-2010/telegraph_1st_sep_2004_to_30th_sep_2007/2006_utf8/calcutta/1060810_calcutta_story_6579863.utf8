 Plastic to fuel pitch by state 

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 The growing pollution level due to excessive use of plastics has prompted the state government to kick-start a pilot project of converting waste plastic into fuel like diesel or petrol.

 The state environment department has written to Alka Zadgaonkar, head of department of Applied Chemistry of GH Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur, who had invented a reverse process of converting plastic into fuel. 

 In a chemical process, crude oil is processed to produce petroleum goods like diesel or petrol, along with by-products like plastic, petroleum jelly, vaseline and coal tar. A few years ago, Zadgaonkar invented a reverse process of producing fuel from plastic. 

 The project has already been implemented in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The environment department has requested the professor to give a presentation in Calcutta. 

 If we find that the chemical process is feasible on a larger scale, we might adopt it to convert the bulk of waste plastic in our city, principal secretary M.L. Meena said.

 Recently, at a meeting in Writers Buildings, it was decided that the environment department would slap a stop-work notice on all the plastic-manufacturing units. 

 Department officials said the units which will not abide by the notice will be subjected to either a Rs 1-lakh fine or imprisonment, or both, under the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986.

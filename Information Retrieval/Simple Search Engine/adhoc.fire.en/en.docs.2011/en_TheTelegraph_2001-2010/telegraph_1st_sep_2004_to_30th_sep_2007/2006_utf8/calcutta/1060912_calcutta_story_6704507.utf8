 From antique silver designs to 

 contemporary ones, Bhatters at 121 Rashbehari Avenue, 

 alongside Citi Style, has it all. 

 Chandeliers and vases to decorate 

 your drawing room, a puja mandir for deities, jewellery 

 for special occasions, silver candlesticks for the perfect 

 wedding gift, delicate anklets to adorn your feet, carved 

 silver furniture and silver utensils for Dhanteras the 

 store that opened its doors on August 28 is a treasure-trove 

 for every occasion. 

 All our products are 92.5 

 sterling silver and here you will find a good fusion of 

 ethnic and modern designs, says Siddharta Bhatter, 

 joint-director of the outlet. Abhishek Bhatter, the other 

 joint-director, agrees.

 Jewellery jazz

 The forte of Bhatters first 

 outlet on Russell Street has always been silver utensils. 

 But what sets the Rashbehari Avenue branch apart is the 

 introduction of a new range of exquisite silver jewellery. 

 Enter the plush 1,100 sq ft showroom 

 done up in veneer panels with a silver finish and a striking 

 collection of Italian and Victorian jewellery awaits you 

 along with original designer ornaments skillfully crafted 

 by the stores in-house team. 

 Studded into the silver accessories 

 are coloured semi-precious stones, pearls, cubic and zircone 

 stones and imported stones from Bangkok. 

 Baby buys

 The one category that has many 

 young parents dropping in is the wide range of baby gifts. 

 Baby dining sets with engraved 

 alphabets on the circumference of the plate with Mickey 

 Mouse designs, or silver rattles, melt many mothers 

 hearts. 

 Gifts galore

 Corporate gifts are also catching 

 on. Tea sets, wine goblets, peg measures, candle-stands, 

 silver pens and corporate tableware are only some of the 

 items on the professional gift list. 

 To add that personal touch, 

 customised engraving is done on our products, says 

 Abhishek. 

 Silver bowls and table-lamps have 

 filigree work on them and replicas can also be made from 

 samples.

 For the home

 Silver furniture with intricate 

 carving is lacquered to prevent tarnish. Sofa-sets, divans, 

 beds and dressing tables are a few of the furniture items 

 on offer, starting from Rs 1,00,000. 

 Price point

 Tea sets and vases come for Rs 

 15,000, pendant sets range between Rs 1,000 and Rs 4,000, 

 utensils are priced from Rs 250 and five gram pure silver 

 coins are available for Rs 100. Silver utensils have a buy-back 

 value of 90 percent.

 Since a large number of 

 our clients are Bengalis, balas, churis, kundan-jadau 

 jewellery and thala sets for annaprashan are 

 available, says Abhishek.

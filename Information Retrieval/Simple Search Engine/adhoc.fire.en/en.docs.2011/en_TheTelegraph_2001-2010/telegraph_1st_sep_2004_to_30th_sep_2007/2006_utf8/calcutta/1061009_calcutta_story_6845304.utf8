 The City Diary

 A 50-strong mob went on a rampage at National Medical College 

 and Hospital on Sunday to protest alleged negligence of 

 doctors leading to the death of 22-year-old Sheikh Shajahan. 

 The mob ransacked a room and manhandled doctors. In the 

 afternoon, relatives of the patient lodged a complaint with 

 Beniapukur police station, accusing doctors of being responsible 

 for the death and also removing a kidney from the body. 

 Police said Shajahan, a resident of Topsia First Lane, 

 was admitted to the hospital on October 4 with pain in the 

 abdomen. Doctors found he was suffering from peptic ulcer. 

 The next day, he underwent surgery. He died around 11.10 

 am on Saturday. 

 A portion of the verandah of a house on BB Ganguly Street collapsed on Sunday morning (picture above), after one of its pillars was hit by a minibus that lost control. Police said the mishap occurred around 10.15 am. The bus was heading west along BB Ganguly Street. The driver fled. No one was injured. 

 A fire broke out in the kitchen of a bar-cum-restaurant (picture below) on Ashutosh Mukherjee Road around 12.15 pm on Sunday. The staff noticed smoke emanating from the kitchen and informed fire officials. A tender arrived and brought the blaze under control. Officers said an electrical short-circuit had resulted in the fire.

 Babun Majumdar, the prime accused in a murder case, was arrested on Saturday night on charges of threatening witnesses to the crime. Majumdar, a Baguiati resident, had allegedly murdered Sushil Saha, a trader. Sahas wife was an alleged accomplice in the crime.

 A group of porters ransacked a shop in Tripalpatti, Burrabazar, on Sunday afternoon. Trouble broke out when goods being carried by a porter fell in front of the shop. Owner Kashi Ray reproved the porter and a quarrel ensued. The man left, only to return shortly with a group of colleagues.

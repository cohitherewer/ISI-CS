The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Now, bend it like John

Screen On amp; Off

 Wanna play? John Abraham

 Good news for John Abraham fans and bad news for Saif Ali Khan admirers. Vivek Agnihotri?s new film after Chocolate titled Goal will have John ? and not Saif, as was conceived ? playing a ?gladiator footballer?. The film to be produced by UTV will easily be the biggest football film from this part of the world.

 ?Goal is one of the most ambitious projects ever mounted in Indian cinema,? says Ronnie Screwvala, CEO of UTV. ?The entire production team at UTV along with Vivek is working 24x7 to ensure that we get our homework right to do justice to this amazing concept.?

 Speaking from London, John says: ?I have always been a huge football freak and this passion for the game took me all the way to Germany this year to watch the World Cup finals. I am thrilled that my next visit there will be to actually play on the same field as my sporting icons, when I shoot for Goal.?

 For director Agnihotri, it?s a dream come true having planned the movie for a long time. ?I am raring to go on this project. We have worked hard to incubate it and we are now ready to move into the next phase. It is great to have John on board, who himself is an avid football fan and a serious player.?

 To ensure the authenticity of the sport on screen, UTV and Agnihotri will be using the services of Andy Ansah, the football choreographer for most feature films and commercials made on the subject including the celebrated Nike campaigns. Andy has worked with the biggest names in world football including Pele, Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Wayne Rooney.

 Location scouting for Goal has begun and the crew has zeroed in on Spain and the UK to shoot the game and the film in world-class stadiums. 

 Mobile mode: Super Simpoo 

 is available on STAR 7827

 The dynamic vegetarian and fashionably leather-free Simpoo now gets tech-savvy and enters your mobile screens, exclusively from STAR 7827.

 Channel [V]?s Simpoo Sir, one of India?s most popular animated characters, has evolved over the years ? from a passive math teacher to an activist for animals, renouncing all things non-vegetarian in support of PETA. Now, he enters yet another phase in his eventful life as he sets forth on a new mission of saving the school kids from Giggling Gabbar, on the Super Simpoo mobile game.

 Amar K. Deb, head honcho of Channel [V], says: ?We spoke to Simpoo Sir about his foray into the wireless world and in true Simpoo style he jumped at it with the small concern that his students should not spend their math classes playing Super Simpoo, instead.?

 With the launch of the new Simpoo Zone on the WAP site www.wap.star7827.com, Simpoo lovers can now download the animated star on their mobile phones as wallpapers, animations and themes apart from playing the game. The game is exclusively available to BSNL, BPL, Hutch, DWL and Spice telecom subscribers.

 Viren Popli, senior vice-president of STAR India, says: ?In line with our promise to offer a variety of quality and exclusive content to our consumers, we are very excited about the first character from our TV network that is being extended to the mobile screen.?

 ?The next time you buy pirated DVDs of movies, you would have made your contribution to fund acts of terror like 7/11.? Such messages are part of the consumer awareness campaign that has been launched by the VFI (Video Federation of India).

 Says M.N. Kapasi, VFI spokesperson and managing director of Excel Home Videos: ?The huge piracy racket that finds its base in Pakistan is a multi-crore moneyspinner for the underworld.?

 The VFI has made representations to the top brass of the police force and various forums regarding the menace, only to get a lukewarm response. ?We have had to take these concerns directly to the consumer and make them realise that their contribution is supporting the cause of terror in a very big way,? adds Kapasi. ?We are using other modes like raids to curb piracy.?

 The association having representation from various VCD/DVD manufactures and home entertainment companies will be communicating these messages through their products and through other media. These messages are expected to go a long way in countering public apathy and fighting the growing menace.

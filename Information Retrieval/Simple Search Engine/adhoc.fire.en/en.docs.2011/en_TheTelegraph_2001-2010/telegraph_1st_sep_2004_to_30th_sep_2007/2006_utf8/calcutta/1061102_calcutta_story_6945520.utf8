Fresh lease of life

 - Cross-donation transplant surgeries carve new destiny

 At 14, Amarnath Patra would have loved to play football with his friends, write his school exams and do his mother proud. Instead, he was on peritoneal dialysis for the past 18 months to treat end-stage renal failure.

 Debnath Bhattacharya, a middle-aged medical representative, saw his world being shattered by diabetic kidney failure two years ago, forcing him to undergo haemo-dialysis.

 The only hope for both Amarnath and Debnath: kidney transplant surgery.

 Nivedita Patra, a widow, wanted to give her kidney to her son but her blood group (B+) didnt match Amarnaths (A+). In the Bhattacharya household, Saswati wanted to give her kidney to her husband, but she was (A+) and Debnath was (B+).

 The two families strangers in Orissa but bound by a common medical destiny then carved out a way with their will. Saswati Bhattacharya gave her kidney to young Amarnath; Nivedita Patra gave her kidney to Debnath.

 The successful transplant surgeries made possible by cross-donations were performed last week at the Manjulaben Mehta Kidney Hospital of the Armenian Church Trauma Centre (ACTC) in Mukundapur, Calcutta.

 For kidney transplants, law accepts spouses, siblings, parents and children and in case of voluntary donors, a special state-committee permission needs to be obtained. Desperate families are often forced to buy a kidney at an exorbitant price through unscrupulous middlemen.

 This was a very special scenario, where we had two sets of people ready to donate and there blood groups were cross-matching, so they decided to go ahead... A wonderful gesture that should inspire many others in a similar situation, said Dilip Pahari, head of the department of nephrology, ACTC, a unit of Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS).

 The two families were overwhelmed by the turn of events. Im grateful to Saswati for saving my sons life. Hes still so young... There was no way we could have afforded a transplant had she not donated, said Nivedita Patra, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks. We feel we are now part of one extended family, smiled Debnath.

 We cant thank Nivedita enough, he added, hoping to now revive his sagging business fortunes with the small pharmacy in Balasore.

 All four, donors and recipients, are recuperating well after the October 24 surgeries and they promise to stand by each other.

 Without the kidney cross-donation, both Debnath and Amarnath would have had to undergo lifelong dialysis or fall back on the kidney donation racket.

 This situation was particularly heartening and unique, since the voluntary switching has not only increased life expectancy and improved quality of life, but helped in creating a wider pool of donors, explained Deepak S. Ray, chief nephrologist, ACTC, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 The 15-year survival expectancy with kidney transplant is 70 per cent in a diabetic and over 80 per cent in a non-diabetic patient, say doctors. 

 So, for both the Patras and the Bhattacharyas this, indeed, is a fresh lease of life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Partying into the airwaves

Screen On amp; Off

 Fresh face: Sanjeeda

 She was at the right place at the right time and before she knew, she was invited to be the next big thing on Indian television. Sanjeeda, a little known actress on the south Indian big screen, is set to play the role of Nimmo in the new Ektaa Kapoor serial on STAR One, Kya Hoga Nimmo Ka. It was at a common friend?s party where the two ladies bumped into each other and the rest, as they say, is history.

 ?Ektaa spotted me at the party and wanted me to be her new face,? Sanjeeda tells Metro. ?The next day I screen-tested for the role of Nimmo and within a week they called back to confirm the offer.?

 In the new serial, to start in March, Nimmo is a simple and youthful girl who is clumsy enough to trip often and break glasses every now and then. She is part of a close-knit family comprising her mother, father and two sisters. ?Nimmo is a very ordinary middle class girl and she is happy being that way. In fact, she inspires others to be content with their lives,? feels Sanjeeda.

 But doesn?t that sound like Jassi? ?I think the similarity between the two is only in the titles,? Sanjeeda asserts. ?Other than that, the two are completely different.?

 Secretary satire: A moment from Where is Sandra?

 A film festival by women, of women and for everybody. A two-day festival of films by Asian women film-makers started at the India International Centre, Delhi on Tuesday. As many as 25 shorts by women directors of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Taiwan and Malaysia are being screened. The festival, organised by International Association of Women in Radio and Television along with IIC Asia, will next travel to eight other Indian cities. The package will be screened at Nandan here in Calcutta from April 1 to 3.

 The issues are both contemporary and cinematic. Yasmine Kabir?s A Certain Liberation focuses on Gurudasi Mondal who watches her family being slaughtered during the liberation war of Bangladesh. Women of the Holy Kingdom, directed by Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, pans women?s movements in Saudi Arabia. 

 If Sonali Dutta?s For Love or Izzat investigates forced marriages and honour-killings among Britain?s Asian community, Where is Sandra? is a light hearted critique of the stereotype Mumbai secretary. 

 Personal tales are often more powerful. The House on Gulmohar Avenue by Samina Mishra focuses extensively on Mishra?s family and a predominantly Muslim area in Delhi. ?It is a study of the concepts of identity and what being a Muslim in India means,? Mishra tells Metro. 

 A completely different set of films on women will be screened at the American Centre, on Thursday and Friday. The festival starts with Jonathan Kaplan?s Accused, one of Hollywood?s first essays in dealing issues like rape and sexual rights. But then the fare moves on to more mainstream hits like Hugh Wilson?s Guarding Tess (Nicholas Cage and Shirley MacLaine) the hilarious Albert Brooks comedy Mother and Emile Ardolino?s Sister Act.

 Top of the charts: Rohit Roy

 Actor Rohit Roy is all over the small screen. When he is not brooding away in some soap, he is dancing with wife Mansi Joshi Roy at some TV competition. And now, the versatile Rohit will be seen hosting two special episodes of the popular musical countdown show on Zee Muzic, Weekend Countdown. 

 The episodes, which have been shot recently in the beautiful island of Mauritius, will air this Saturday at 7 pm and the next Saturday at 7.30 pm. The second episode also boasts of a heavy celebrity presence in the form of Manisha Koirala, Pakistani actress Meera, Poonam Dhillon, Shiney Ahuja and ashmera Shah.

 The dry Bollywood season is warming up this Friday with Priyadarshan?s ensemble comedy Malamaal Weekly, that brings together two of the best acting talents in India, Paresh Rawal and Om Puri. Apart from Rang De Basanti and to some extent Taxi No. 9211, no Hindi movie has been able to strike it rich at the box-office this year and the ?realistic comedy? will try to add to that list. 

 In fact, you can catch the film a day earlier with INOX organising special paid previews on Thursday. While the Forum shows are at 7.15 pm and 10.15 pm, the City Centre screenings are at 6.30 pm and 9 pm. Not just that, over the next two weeks, watching Malamaal Weekly at INOX can win you loads of exciting prizes such as mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 and DVD players.

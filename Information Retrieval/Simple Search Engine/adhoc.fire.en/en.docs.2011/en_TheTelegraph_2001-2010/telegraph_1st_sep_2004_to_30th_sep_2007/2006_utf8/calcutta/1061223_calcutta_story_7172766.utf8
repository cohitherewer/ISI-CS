 Take a look: The evening kicked off with a song and dance performance by Hope Foundation children. Tollywood celebrities Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Parambrata Chatterjee and Locket Chatterjee dropped in to be part of the fun.

 This was followed by a musical performance by the band Mokam. Actor-singer Arindam Ganguly also belted out a few songs, while the children danced to the peppy beats. 

 The celebrities were called on stage to lend their voice to Aguner parashmoni, followed by another cultural performance by the children.

 In the spirit of giving gifts during Christmas, Monginis donated Rs 500,000 to children from the foundation. Christmas is our best business time of the year and this is a way of giving something back to society, said Arnab Basu, director, Monginis.

 Voiceover: Todays event heralds the Christmas season of goodwill and well-being and also creates awareness about social needs, said Sarbani Das Roy, executive director, Hope Foundation.

 What: Inauguration of Christmas celebrations.

 Where: Hyatt Regency Calcutta.

 Make merry: With Christmas knocking on the door, the lobby at the star address is all geared up to welcome the festival in style. 

 While wreathes and colourful decorations dot the space, sounds from The Calcutta Chamber Orchestra comprising students of The Calcutta School of Music fill the air from 5 pm to 10 pm.

 On December 13, The Calcutta Chamber Orchestra members played for an audience comprising the citys consular crowd. 

 The violinists, bassist and cello player performed popular Christmas carols like Jingle bells, Silent night, Away in a manger, Rudolph the red nosed reindeer and White Christmas.

 Voiceover: The members enjoy playing to set the Christmas mood. Since most of them dont come from sound financial backgrounds, the proceeds will go to them, said Deepika Jaidka, administrator of The Calcutta School of Music and relationship manager, The Calcutta Chamber Orchestra.

 What: 

 Launch of H2O+, a personal care brand from Chicago.

 Where: Health Shoppe at Rowland Road.

 When: April 28.

 Take a look: This marine-based international skin care brand with 500 formulations to its credit blends water, sea extracts, minerals, vitamins and enzymes with latest technology. On offer is an array of skincare, spa, bath and fragrance products.

 The H20+ line at Health Shoppe includes a cleanser that is an oil-free, water composition and toners that are alcohol-free.

 The Hydrating Marine Moisture Mask reduces fine surface lines and replenishes vital moisture. While the Water White Brightening Tonic is for glow and radiance, Water White Cleansing Mousse not only cleanses but also lightens the skin.

 For men you have gels and balms that soothe and tackle dryness and irritation, post-shaving.

 Internationally, H20+ stores are based in the United States, Canada, Australia, China, Chile, Greece, Puerto Rico and more. In India, H20+ can be found in Delhi, Mumbai and Chandigarh.

 In Calcutta, the product will be available exclusively at Health Shoppes Rowland Road address and the forthcoming store at City Centre.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 500.

 Voiceover: The product has done well in other parts of Asia and it should be a hit in Calcutta too. We have brought our bestsellers into this part of the country, keeping in mind the Calcutta climatic condition and skin types, said Siddharth Khandelwal, brand manager, H20+ in India.

 Bday bash

 What: First anniversary celebrations.

 Where: Mama Mia Gelato at Ballygunge Circular Road, New Alipore and Forum on Elgin Road.

 The celebration: As part of its birthday celebrations, Mama Mia has rustled up some special flavours apart from the regular range of sundaes and gelatos that have made the Mama Mia outlets such a hit among the young and not so young. New flavours include Fresh Alphonso Sundae, Nutty Toffee Sundae and Naughty But Nice Gelato.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 30. Also on offer will be one complimentary scoop on purchases worth Rs 200 and above, on April 29 and 30.

 Voiceover: For Mama 

 Mia Gelatos, it was more a case of Vini Vidi Vici. I am 

 absolutely thrilled and overwhelmed by the response from 

 my hometown, which is otherwise only known for its rosogollas 

 and other traditional mithai, says proprietor 

 Natasha Agarwal.

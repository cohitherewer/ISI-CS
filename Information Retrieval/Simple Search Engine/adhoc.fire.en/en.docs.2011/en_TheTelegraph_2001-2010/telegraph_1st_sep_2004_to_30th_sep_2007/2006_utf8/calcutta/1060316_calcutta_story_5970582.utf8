 Deaths at eatery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two teenaged employees of an eatery on Mirza Ghalib Street died under mysterious circumstances in their room on the first floor of the establishment on Wednesday morning.

 Both Kausar Ali, 16, and Mohammad Manawar Hussain, 18, hailed from Giridih, in Jharkhand. They had been employed at Maharaja Snacks for the past few months. Mohammad Qayum, Kausar?s father, is also an employee of the eatery.

 Police have not ruled out murder. Mohammad Nesar, 18, another employee of the eatery, has been detained for interrogation. 

 On Tuesday night, Kausar, Manawar, Qayum and Nesar ate together in the restaurant. ?Manawar and Kausar then went to their room to sleep. Around midnight, they started vomiting. Nesar, who was also in the room, went outside to sleep on the pavement,? said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh. 

 ?There were no injuries on the bodies. The post-mortem revealed that the boys died of food poisoning. We are investigating whether they were poisoned. The leftovers have been sent for forensic examination,? Singh added. 

 After they had closed the eatery, Qayum returned to his rented accommodation on SN Banerjee Road. Nesar told police that he could not bear the stench in the room after Manawar and Kausar started vomiting, and decided to spend the night outside.

 Around 6 am, Nesar returned to the room to find Kausar and Manawar lying unconscious and froth dribbling out of their mouths. He immediately informed eatery owner Rohit Gupta, who lives in Karnani Mansion.

 Gupta rushed to the restaurant and later called the police. The two were taken to SSKM Hospital, where they were declared brought dead.

 Relatives of the boys alleged that blood was oozing out of Manawar?s mouth when they last saw him at SSKM. They also claimed that there were injuries on his left cheek.

 ?The doctor at SSKM told us that Manawar was throttled. It was a clear case of murder,? said Mohammad Manjar, a relative of Manawar?s.

 Not all awards pit people against 

 each other. At least one the International Award for Young 

 People, India encourages the GeNext to be the best they 

 can be. With the motto compete with yourself, the Duke 

 of Edinburghs Award, as it is also known, is a platform 

 for students to discover their own skills through self-development. 

 The award presentation ceremony 

 on November 28 recognised students from schools around the 

 city, between the ages of 14 and 24 years. The award has 

 four sections: physical recreation, skill, social service 

 and adventure. Passing through progressive levels of specialisation, 

 participants graduate from being Bronze to Silver to Gold 

 certificate holders. There is no stipulated time period 

 for students to qualify for the levels. They submit periodic 

 reports of their activities, on the basis of which they 

 are assessed, explained Viral Sheth, president, Award Holders 

 Association.

 This year, 10 students were awarded 

 gold certificates, 42 received silver, while 145 students 

 took away bronze awards. 

 The work does not clash with 

 the school curriculum because often, the skill you select 

 as part of the programme is one you would be doing as part 

 of your school extracurriculars anyway, said last years 

 gold awardee Ruchika Ghosh, now a fourth-year student of 

 the National University of Juridical Sciences.

 The awards have given me an opportunity 

 to go places where I never would have been able to go otherwise, 

 smiled Mohammed Anis, a gold awardee from Sir Syed Group 

 of Schools.

 Trekking, camping and exchange 

 programmes to foreign countries are some of the attractions 

 in the adventure section. I have completed 15 adventure 

 camps, including Sandakphu, Matha and Sushunia in Purulia, 

 and even Panchalingeshwar, says Anis.

 Ruchika, too, has had a blast. 

 I went to the UK on the Swinton Exchange Programme which 

 took us to the Lake District. Students from eight countries 

 were there and we had great fun going rock climbing, dragon 

 sailing (where you lash together a boat made of barrels 

 to sail down a river), and ghyll scrambling where you go 

 down a waterfall, the way they show in Hindi movies, she 

 laughed.

 As chief guest Simon Wilson, British 

 Deputy High Commissioner, said: It is a wonderful opportunity 

 for people from diverse backgrounds to come together. I 

 was very moved by the achievement of the students from Ramakrishna 

 Mission Blind Boys Academy who must have worked against 

 great odds.

 The West Bengal State Aids Prevention 

 and Control Society in association with TTIS organised 

 a slogan writing and a sit-and-draw competition at the East 

 Bengal Club grounds on December 2. 

 The participants were categorised 

 into two groups. While child rights was the topic allotted 

 to participants from classes VI and VII, a senior group 

 worked on HIV/AIDS. The event was an endeavour to create 

 awareness about a sensitive issue like AIDS among the youth.

 Celeb sites on sale

 More geekspeak this week, Im 

 afraid. This one is provoked by a friend who suggested that 

 an easy way to earn money was to register websites in the 

 names of celebrities or would-be-celebrities who had not 

 yet figured out that they were celebrities. We could then 

 sell the domain name to them at astronomical prices when 

 they finally got around to figuring that they were indeed 

 celebrities. Good try, but no cigar. This is one of the 

 oldest Internet scams in the book, but it is surprising 

 how many people still think that it is a smart move to register 

 a website called www.budhiasingh.com and flog it 

 to the poor kid when he stops running.

 On a more serious note, domaining 

 or buying, selling, developing, and monetising Internet 

 domain names is a multi-million dollar industry that has 

 generated an estimated $29 million in 2005. There are about 

 a couple of thousand operators who seem to make a living 

 from buying and selling Internet names. Chief among them 

 is the shadowy and sinister-sounding Yun Ye, who is so secretive 

 that even Wikipedia has nothing to say about him 

 (or her).

 Two contrasting cases will make 

 this clear first, the celebrated instance of Canadian-born 

 Indian, AR Mani, who successfully fought off a challenge 

 from fashion giant Giorgio Armani over the rights of www.armani.com. 

 Armani took Mani to court on charges of cybersquatting 

 the common term for registering and using a domain name 

 in bad faith. Disputes of this kind are arbitrated by the 

 Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), 

 which, in this particular case, ruled in favour of Mani. 

 Those interested in the case may look it up on www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/ 

 2001/d2001-0537.html.

 One of the key elements of Manis 

 defence was that his name was indeed Anand Ramnath Mani 

 and that he had been operating his graphic design business 

 under the name AR Mani since 1981. But this wasnt the case 

 with a Cambridge philosophy lecturer who tried to top up 

 his research grant by buying up the domain names of 130-odd 

 international writers, and then trying to sell them to the 

 writers at a profit. In May this year, he offered to sell 

 the domain name of writer Jeanette Winterson in return for 

 three per cent of her royalties for one year (the fact that 

 Winterson is not exactly your average supermarket bestseller 

 does not seem to have crossed the good philosophers mind). 

 Winterson took the case to the World Intellectual Property 

 Organisation (Wipo) which delivered a landmark judgment 

 in her favour. For Wintersons deadpan account of her encounter 

 with the penurious Cambridge don, see her article Domain 

 Dispute on http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/books.asp.

 I should also report that till 

 date there is no domain called www.abhijitgupta.in. 

 I am obviously not famous enough. On this bathetic note, 

 I will cease.

 Fatal twist to colour festival

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The festival of colours turned tragic for Tarak Sen, 38, and his family.

 Tarak, returning from his in-laws? place in Sodepur, on the city?s northern fringes, met with an accident that killed his wife Rina, 31. 

 The mishap took place on Tuesday, when Tarak?s motorcycle collided with a truck coming from the opposite direction on Sodepur Road, near the Ghola checkpoint. 

 While Rina died on the spot, Tarak sustained serious head injuries and is fighting for his life at a local nursing home. 

 Immediately after the accident, local boys playing Holi nearby came running to the spot and found the couple lying in a pool of blood. Some of them also chased the killer vehicle, but could not stop it. 

 Later, when they shifted the couple to a nearby nursing home, Rina was declared brought dead. Doctors attending to Tarak said he was still not out of danger.

 ?We were busy playing Holi, when all of sudden we heard a crash. We rushed to the spot and found the couple was lying in the middle of the road. Rina?s face and head were completely smashed and blood was oozing out of her mouth and nose. Her husband was writhing in pain,? said Amit Ghosh. 

 Traffic on Sodepur Road was suspended for nearly an hour, as people from the neighbouring areas laid a virtual siege, demanding immediate arrest of the truck driver. The situation could be brought under control only after the senior police officers intervened. 

 ?We have launched a hunt for the truck driver. All neighbouring police stations have been put on alert. We are hoping to trace him soon,? said a district police officer.

 Preliminary investigation reveals that Tarak and Rina had set out for her parents? house in Sodepur in the morning, leaving their eight-year-old daughter with his father, Malin Sen, an employee of the public works department at their house in Madhyamgram.

 After hearing the tragic news , Malin was shattered. ?Tarak and Rina told me that they would be back home by 9 pm and we would have dinner together,? he recounted. 

 ?I was watching a serial on television with my granddaughter. She had been inquiring about her parents since evening, and it is quite difficult to keep her quiet. And now, what should I tell her? I cannot really break the news to her about her mother?s death,? mumbled Malin.

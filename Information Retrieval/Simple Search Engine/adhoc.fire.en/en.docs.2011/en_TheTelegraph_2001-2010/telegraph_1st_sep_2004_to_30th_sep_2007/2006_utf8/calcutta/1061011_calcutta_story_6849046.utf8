The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Aroop Biswas

 President, Suruchi Sangha puja committee

 Since our puja was adjudged the biggest crowd-puller this year by police estimates, there is no way that I can say that there were less people on the streets. But a new trend this year was the spurt in pandal-hoppers in the morning. Earlier, the footfall would plummet after dawn, so we could rest till afternoon. But this time, once the night-time pandal-hopping ended, another batch started streaming in from around 7 am presumably to avoid the evening rush. So the evening crowd got divided. The traffic arrangement was wonderful. But the police must update its list of crowd-pulling pujas.

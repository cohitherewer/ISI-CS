 Revel in the rains

 From indulging in ayurvedic 

 body massages to filling up your home with sweet scents, Shradha 

 Agarwal tells you ways to beat the monsoon blues 

 Monsoon is the best 

 time to indulge in Kerala massages; (above) an A-line

 Ah, aroma

 The first showers bring along a heart-warming hint of aroma. Remember the mushy feel of fragrant, wet soil? Well, two more showers and ideas romantic are replaced by more muddy realities. 

 That repugnant damp smell. Everywhere, right from cars to clothes to cupboards. Washing machine or not, stinking clothes screaming for sun pop out from every nook and corner. 

 Dont forget to air them as much as possible, but in the meantime, a bowl of pot pourri can be placed inside a cupboard for relief.

 Car-related stench can be traced down to either wet floor matting or fungus in the air-conditioner fin, inside the duct. Bacterial formation is common in the fin through which hot and cold air passes? And once the AC is on, the pungent smell fills the car, explains Partho Dutta, service manager at Mukesh Hyundai. 

 This is worsened when you smoke a cigarette with the car AC on, causing nicotine to be deposited in the duct. 

 A quick fix: Take out the mats and sun-dry them. As for the AC stench, get the duct disinfected with a treatment like Air-co Clean system every six months. Car-fresheners can only give temporary relief. 

 And heres a top trick to tease your senses at home: Add a few drops of essential oil, (try lemon grass) to water and then mop the floor. This will leave a tingling aroma all around the house. 

 Wardrobe wow

 Simple silhouettes ? A-line skirts or easy tops ? natural fibres like cottons and muls (a dash of chiffon is okay) and very minimal embroidery. Thats designer Gauri Bajorias recommended look for the rains. 

 Normally beating the monsoon blues is simple. Just toss some happy colours to your wardrobe and thats a sunny statement set. But heres the rainy twist. Gauri says: Instead of wearing bright colours that end up looking like a mess after a shower, sport an already-dirty pastel tone on clothes. Be it light lemons, pretty peaches or pinks, choose a sluggish shade that has a greyish black tinge. 

 These off-coloured tones can then be brightened with happy-hued accessories. Gauri recommends pieces in sequins, stones or beads. The semi-precious and the real jewels can wait for autumn, says Gauri. 

 Skin special

 Sunny one minute and a downpour the next. The weather is not the only unpredictable element this season. Skin conditions feature in the list too. Oily in the morning and super-dry by post-lunch hours. 

 Here are some tips from Kaya Skin Advisory to keep skin hassles at bay this season: 

 Dry skin needs to be kept away from deodorant or antibacterial soaps since they further dry the skin. Use a soothing cleansing gel, which provides a deep cleansing action. 

 Monsoons can mean a de-moisturising effect on dry skin and an over-hydrating effect on oily skin. The skin gets wet often and with the constant wetting and drying, a lot of dehydration (yes, in the rains!) takes place. That explains the itchy feeling one gets during monsoons. Use a non-water-based moisturiser, if you happen to get wet often. Otherwise a water-based moisturiser will do. 

 A sunscreen is a must. Yes, even in the monsoons. 

 A moisturiser is a must to soothe and soften the skin. This leaves a pleasant feeling of freshness and radiant, smoother skin. 

 Dull skin needs regular exfoliation to keep the pores free of hardened oil and to clear dead cells. 

 Humid conditions can cause skin sensitivity in some cases, resulting in rashes. Discontinue use of scrubs and apply a medicated clove mask to soothe. 

 Oily skins can experience some surface dryness after the monsoons. In such cases, use a light, liquid moisturiser. Not a heavy nourishing cream. 

 Indoor pamper

 Rain-timings act as party-poopers almost too often. Enter, indoor activities and a whole-hearted attempt to make them fun. A cuppa giving steaming company to your favourite read; a brain-teasing word game with the kids; piping hot fries providing energy to surf channels? The list is endless. 

 We recommend an ayurvedic Kerala massage. Feel-good properties apart, hot oil ayurvedic treatments are most effective and most benefiting during this time of the year. 

 Dr CM Pradyumna, director of medicine at Vedic Village, says: Ayurveda divides the year into two ? uttarayana (the first six months) and dakshinayana (the next six months). While the first half sees strength of body and digestive efficiency, it gradually begins to taper off by the onset of the second half that coincides with the monsoons. Ayurvedic therapies taken at this time rejuvenate the body while clearing out body channels blocked by humidity. 

 Stress-relieving, strengthening, detoxifying? Try out typical Kerala treats like Abhyangam (body massage), Shirodhara (oscillation of heated oil on the forehead) and Kayaseka (treatment of pouring herbal oil on the body).

 Nothing like taking out some time for yourself in the rains. Go ahead ? indulge yourself!

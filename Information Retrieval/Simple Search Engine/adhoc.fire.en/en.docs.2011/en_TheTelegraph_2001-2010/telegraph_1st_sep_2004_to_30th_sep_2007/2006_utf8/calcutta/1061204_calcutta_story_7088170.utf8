 Police said Ghosh was a resident of Jangipara, Hooghly, 

 and Pathak of Jamalpur, Burdwan. They fell off an overcrowded 

 Howrah-Burdwan chord line local near the Tikiapara car shed. 

 Three others were seriously injured and admitted to Howrah 

 State General Hospital and Medical College and Hospital. 

 Doctors said their condition was critical. 

 A team from the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) is scheduled to visit Calcutta airport on Monday to survey the condition of the eight-seater US plane that overshot the main runway while landing on November 30. Airport sources said the DGCA team would inspect the aircraft before certifying it for flying out of Calcutta. The private chartered aircraft, being flown in from Bangkok on its way to Mumbai, blocked the main runway for over an hour.

Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the government would consider the points raised at the seminar.

 South Eastern Railway is running the Howrah-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Kurla Express from Shalimar, instead of Howrah, from December 1. Officials said this was part of the effort to decongest Howrah station.

 Temporal realities

 Attempting to reconcile the divide between the ideal and the real, art plays an important role in determining and influencing the dominant thoughts and attitudes of its own era. Predicament of Man, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by 22 contemporary artists, highlights current trends in creative expression as an index of the modern human condition in both local and global contexts. Further, it tries to portray the realities of life as they have evolved in our country over the last 50 years. Thus, it features works that examine life from a traditional, conservative standpoint, as well as with a clearly independent, even rebellious approach. While some paintings are socially conscious creations, others explore temporal realities from tragic, satiric or humorous perspectives. Participating artists include Sunil Das, Jogen Chowdhury, Dwijen Gupta, Chitrovanu Mazumdar, Habibur Rahman (a painting by him appears above), Parag Roy and Eleena Banik. The show is dedicated to the memory of Somnath Hore.

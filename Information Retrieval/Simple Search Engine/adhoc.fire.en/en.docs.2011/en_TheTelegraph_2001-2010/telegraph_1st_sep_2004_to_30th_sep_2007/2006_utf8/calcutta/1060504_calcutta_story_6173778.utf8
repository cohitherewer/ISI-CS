 An exhaustive range of coffee experiences, gourmet single-origin coffees and teas, and stylish European bistro fare. An alliance with the worlds largest specialist retailer for infant and toddler care, with international operations across 270 stores in 36 countries, layout rejigs and a more complete departmental store.

 Shoppers Stop, one of the pioneers in setting up large-format stores in India, is now preparing to rev up its retail racks in Calcutta, adding more to the basket and even tingling tastebuds.

 Contrary to what many industry peers had prophesied, Calcutta has embraced our core concept with gusto. Going by the connect we have achieved in this city, we are gearing up to bring all our new formats here by 2008, says B.S. Nagesh, customer care associate and managing director, Shoppers Stop Ltd.

 The two most exciting new offerings in the pipeline from the Rs 6,775 million-turnover chain are Cafe Brio and Mothercare. Both the brands were rolled out in Mumbai last month.

 Under the franchise pact with Mothercare PLC of UK, Shoppers Stop Ltd plans to open over 40 stores, comprising shop-in-shops, shops in departmental stores as well as standalone high-street and mall stores across the country in the next five years.

 Given the recent resurgence, Calcutta will traverse in the next five to seven years the distance some other metros did in 15 years. So we are confident it is ready for all our new offerings including Mothercare, which is undoubtedly the worlds most recognised and respected brand in infants and childrens apparel, accessories and utilities, reveals Nagesh.

 Like the stores in Juhu and Bandra in Mumbai, the Calcutta outlets will have the same design template as Mothercare stores abroad. The UK label offers a wide range of products from baby amp; kids fashion, baby furniture amp; bedding, bathtime/feeding amp; travel products, safety products, toys, and maternity wear for moms-to-be.

 Shoppers Stops experience and understanding of the Indian retail market, coupled with our unique product offering, will help us become the specialist retailer of choice for Indian parents and parents to be, feels Neil Postance, international franchisee manager, Mothercare.

 Brio is the result of a strategic alliance between Shoppers Stop Ltd and Blue Foods Ltd, the name behind Copper Chimney, Cream Centre, Bombay Blue, Noodle Bar and Spaghetti Kitchen.

 It has three distinct areas ? innovative coffees, unique cold drip frozen and iced coffees and tea, fast-service food and a custom-designed bakery.

 We have always believed in helping consumers move up the quality and value chain. And with more and more urban consumers spending on eating out, the F amp;B segment has huge potential, feels Nagesh.

 To go with its exotic cappuccinos, lattes and gourmet single-origin coffees, Brio will offer a range of quick bites, appetisers, salads, fresh sandwiches, hand-rolled pizzas and pastas, besides desserts and an array of oven-fresh breads.

 Brio will bring a unique bistro experience to consumers by offering a wide range of international fare and the experience of a five-star cafe at incredible prices, says Harshita Gandhi, customer care associate and senior manager, food amp; beverage, Shoppers Stop Ltd.

 Shoppers Stop, the only Indian member of IGDS (Intercontinental Group of Departmental Stores), also plans to introduce its 100,000 sq ft-plus hypermarket format HyperCity ? stocking everything from coriander leaves to plasma TV? in Calcutta sometime soon.

 The 1,20,000-sq ft Malad HyperCity opened in Mumbai this week.

 Some of our new formats will surely be launched at our South City property, which will be a more complete departmental store, while Shoppers Stop at both Forum and City Centre will see a realignment of layout to accommodate new brands, including our premium cosmetics wing MAC, explains Nagesh.

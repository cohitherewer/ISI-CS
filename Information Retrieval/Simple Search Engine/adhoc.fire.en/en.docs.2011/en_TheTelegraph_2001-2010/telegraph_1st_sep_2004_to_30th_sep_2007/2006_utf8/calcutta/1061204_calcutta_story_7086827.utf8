The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New cables for better service 

 Salil Kumar Bhaduri, general 

 manager (customer relations and sales), Calcutta Telephones, 

 met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. 

 Participants included Shashi Damani, Mohd Sharique Ehsan, 

 Sourish Mishra, S. Sarkar, Asim Majumdar, Mridul Banerjee, 

 Diptimoy Ghosh, Talat Salahuddin, Sandip Banerjee and Sanjay 

 Agarwal

Asim Majumdar: In some areas, overhead telephone cables hang at such a low height that loaded trucks frequently damage the cables, disrupting services. Can you take some steps in solving this problem? 

 Well, thank you for the information. To avoid such problems, we have decided to introduce an underground cable network. Allotment of equipment for the conversion of overhead cables into underground cables has already started. However, people who are more prone to these problems can use a WLL receiver till our conversions are complete. 

S. Sarkar: You have computerised the billing system. But do you know that in some of the exchanges, despite paying the bill within the due date, a surcharge is getting added to the total bill amount. Can you elaborate why?

 There are around 13.5 lakh customers under the purview of Calcutta Telephones. It is quite a hectic job to deliver the bill at the doorstep of every consumer. At times, maybe the bill gets delayed due to postal disorders. However, in your case, if you are getting a surcharge amount every month, you can contact the area manager for redress.

Shashi Damani: Why cant you take steps like the CESC and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to realise outstanding bills?

 Both the CESC and the civic body have a monopoly in their respective areas. But in the field of telecommunication, following the entry of private agencies, Calcutta Telephones has many competitors. 

 As a result, a client, after surrendering his telephone connection, doesnt care to clear the outstanding amount because private agencies are providing new connections at a lower and affordable cost.

 A plan is afoot to form a consortium with all telecom operators, so that no non-paying customer can get a new connection without clearing the due amount.

S. Sarkar: I am facing a lot of problems while getting connected to the broadband service. And by chance if it gets disconnected, it is far more difficult to get reconnected. The case is the same with your cellphones. Can you tell us why it is so in your case, while other private service providers are doing well ?

 Our cellphone services are improving. We have entered the mobile phone arena 10 years after the other private providers. No operator can offer you foolproof service. However, I hope in the coming months, you will be satisfied with our improved service.

Mridul Banerjee: Owing to road repairs, we often face disturbances in our telephone lines. Sometimes, the private agencies snap the telephone cables for their work. Can you please take some steps? 

 As I have told you before, we have already taken up a scheme of introducing an underground cable network. To implement this, 40 new exchanges are coming up. There are over 500 exchanges under the Calcutta Telephones command area. All the exchanges will have optical fibre connections. We have taken a decision not to lay new copper lines.

Shashi Damani: In the age of cellphones and cut-throat competition among the private players in the telecommunication arena, how many customers have so far surrendered their landlines? What is the trend? Are the numbers rising ? 

 I must point out that if 50,000 customers have surrendered their lines, 40,000 of them have done it owing to non-payment of bills. The rate of surrendering landline telephones has come down drastically.

Shashi Damani: Previously, you gave telephone directories for free. Why have you discontinued the service ?

 Telephone directories are of no use because of their huge size and they are costly, too. Instead of a printed directory, we have started giving CDs. The price of the CD is Rs 100.

 However, telephone directories are still printed. Earlier, we used to print 1.2 million directories, now we print 50, 000 and but they are not distributed free.

 Around 900 students, 8,000 enthusiasts 

 and a sprinkling of stars will come together at Netaji Indoor 

 Stadium for a two-day classical music concert organised 

 by Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty to mark the 10th anniversary 

 of his school Shrutinandan.

 Tabla maestro Pandit Kishan Maharaj 

 and Carnatic vocalist M. Balamuralikrishna will light the 

 inaugural lamps on December 30 and 31 that will see recitals, 

 felicitations, lecture demonstrations, documentary screening 

 and a mingling of the music-minded. 

 Among the star performers are tabla exponent Ustad Zakir Hussain, Balamuralikrishna, Ustad Rashid Khan and Kaushiki Chakrabarty Desikan. Those to be felicitated include Manna De, Girija Devi and Ravi Kichlu.

 But this is essentially a programme revolving around our students. We want to showcase the results of 10 years of our training and hard work, said Chakrabarty, who is expecting listeners from the US, Canada and the UK. Some of them would be his students; a few are also likely to perform. 

 The most distinct feature of the concert would be chorus recitals of several classical forms, like khayal and thumri, by groups of around 200 children. 

 Along with my wife Chandana and daughter Kaushiki, I have been relentlessly training the children for the past one year for this. We have come across a number of talented singers hailing from families without any musical background, said Chakrabarty.

 Around 1,000 students of Shrutinandan will take part in the music recitals in languages as diverse as Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Persian and even English. The range of forms is also wide dhrupad, dhamar, khayal, thumri, tillana, tarana, geet and ghazal. 

 At Shrutinandan, I start taking 

 children from age four. Its very important to start early 

 and for the student to have a congenial background, added 

 Chakrabarty, who encourages the families of his students 

 to take part in the music appreciation classes conducted 

 at the Golf Club Road address.

 Hard-earned victories in court have proved fruitless for city-based primary schoolteacher Pranab Kumar Sengupta, who has been drawing a salary of Rs 21.75 per month for the past 33 years.

 A number of orders by Calcutta High Court has not secured for Sengupta confirmation of his appointment with retrospective effect and dues.

 Moreover, the school education department has recently appointed an assistant teacher in his school, flouting a court order in this regard. The high court had asked the government not to employ any teacher in the school before confirming Sengupta?s appointment.

 ?A teacher named Madhumita Dasgupta has been appointed at Basak Bagan Primary School, in Patipukur, where my client has been taking classes since 1973. According to a high court order, the authorities concerned have no right to make fresh appointments at the school before confirming my client?s appointment,? said Saibalendu Bhowmik. 

 He has been fighting Sengupta?s cases in the high court for the past 12 years.

 The lawyer alleged that the education department had violated the court order in other respects, too. Justice K.J. Sengupta of the high court had asked the state education department not to disburse the salary of the chairman of North 24-Parganas primary school council before the teacher?s dues were cleared.

 ?My client has received Rs 8,000 as salary only for a month. The school education department is, however, regularly paying the salary of the district council chairman, who is responsible for the mess,? Bhowmik stated.

 On being asked whether Sengupta would move a contempt petition against the government, his counsel replied: ?I do not want to create financial problems for anybody. I only want the government to carry out the court?s order and confirm my client?s appointment.?

 Sengupta was appointed by the institution in 1973 for a monthly salary of Rs 21.75. In 1978, the state government declared the school a ?government-aided? one and took over the responsibility of paying teachers? salaries. The school education department, however, declined to pay Sengupta, as his appointment had not been confirmed by the district primary school council.

 After attempts to confirm his appointment did not yield any result, Sengupta moved a petition in the high court in 1993.

 The next year, Justice P.K. Mukherjee in his order directed the school education department to confirm the schoolteacher?s appointment with retrospective effect from 1978. The order also directed the department to pay the dues as per the scale applicable.

 The school education department was ready to carry out the court?s order, but the primary school council moved a petition before a division bench challenging the verdict.

 The division bench upheld the trial bench order. Sengupta had also appealed to the chief minister several times.

 After the primary school council refused to obey the court orders, the petitioner filed a contempt petition against it, as well as the directorate of school education. The court asked the government to carry out the order immediately.

 Council counsel Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said his client would move the Supreme Court.

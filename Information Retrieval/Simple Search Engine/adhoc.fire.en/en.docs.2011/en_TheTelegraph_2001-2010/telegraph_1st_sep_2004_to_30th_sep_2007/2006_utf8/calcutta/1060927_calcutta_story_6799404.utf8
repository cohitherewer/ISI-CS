The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Over the past few years, there is a new craze of theme-based 

 Durga pujas in Calcutta. A lot of clubs and baroari puja 

 committees experiment with themes like diyas 

 and dhunuchis or kites. The club organisers hire 

 rural artisans to build and decorate these pandals. This 

 is quite an innovative platform to display the talent of 

 our artisans from different parts of Bengal and is, of course, 

 a visual treat for pandal-hoppers.

 Despite big promises each year, after every monsoon the 

 areas around Bagjola and Kestopur Canal are submerged by 

 waterlogging. All the roads and lanes in residential areas 

 like Dum Dum Park, Lake Town, Sribhumi are clogged with 

 water for than a week and commuting from these areas is 

 a big problem. But nothing has moved our civic body, the 

 problem is same as ever.

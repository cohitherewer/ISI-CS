 Everybody loves a second glance, 

 says Achla Sachdev. And my job is to ensure that they 

 have it. Model-turned-actress-turned-TV host-turned 

 choreographer is now a makeover specialist. 

 She says it takes her exactly 

 59 seconds to look up anyone from head to toe, 

 and bingo! My mind is all made up. I know what the 

 person should wear colours, cuts, hairstyle, accessories, 

 smiles Achla, who was in town for Westside Motorola Style 

 Showdown.

 We had a great response 

 last year and so the show is back. Calcutta was the seventh 

 stop in a row and we have Hyderabad and Bangalore to cover 

 still, she adds. Nine destinations are fine, but Calcutta, 

 to her, is special. And hectic. 

 Day 1 was dedicated to a Chinese 

 treat at Tangra, Day 2 to the show and Bengali food, and 

 Day 3 (the 24 hours that she extended exclusively) 

 was meant for Continental meals, between chaat-type 

 snacks, shopping, and also a glimpse of the newly-lit Howrah 

 bridge.

 But thanks to Mamata Banerjee, 

 most of her Friday plans flopped. I managed only two 

 hours of shopping in the evening and had to settle for only 

 one Continental meal, she rues. The rest of the bandh 

 day was spent discussing her December 16 show in BILAMS.

 The city is also doubly special 

 because she has a Bengali guru Swami Paramhans 

 Yoganand. I feel that it is essential to be happy 

 from within. Layers of make-up cant make up for the 

 lack of inner peace. Thats why my makeovers try and 

 reach the spiritual side of a person, says Achla.

 After 15 years in the industry 

 spent grooming so many wannabe actors and models, dealing 

 with regular people is a different ballgame 

 altogether. 

 Achla takes into account all lifestyle 

 and professional considerations and then comes up with a 

 plan. If the client thinks the image is too alienated 

 from the self and finds it way too drastic, there is always 

 Plan B, she assures.

 The most common fashion faux pas 

 by people, Achla feels, is picking a wrong shade of lipstick 

 and hair colour. Then comes the problem of piling on jewellery. 

 The idea is to look hatke sounds filmi 

 but it works. Who wants to be run-of-the-mill?

 And here are some tips from Achla, 

 all for that second glance:

 Everyone has a best feature. 

 If its your eyes then play them up with kohl and mascara; 

 if its your lips then touch them with colours and 

 gloss. Accentuate them. Everyday.

 Keep your hair neat. Get 

 a great cut and maintain well. Your hair is your biggest 

 accessory.

 Exercise daily for that 

 natural glow. A flat stomach is a must. 

 Manicured hands and feet 

 are super-important. Colour is optional but keep the nails 

 clean and neat. 

 Believe in brands. Unlike 

 the we-dont-believe-in-brands brigade, Achla is all 

 for the power of big brands. A branded item shows 

 through. Make sure that your jeans and sunglasses at least 

 are branded.

 After Westside Motorola Style 

 Showdown, the city will be seeing more of Achla in the near 

 future. She has just launched her services as a personal 

 shopper and stylist for brides-to-be and their families, 

 and Calcutta as one of the biggest, fattest wedding markets 

 features high on her preferred place list.

 I ask for the clients 

 photograph before hand and then accompany them shopping 

 for clothes, jewellery, make-up demonstrations anything, 

 she says. 

 The charges will depend on the 

 number of people and hours that are involved, very 

 exclusive and very worth it, she signs 

 off.

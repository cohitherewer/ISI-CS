 Here comes the Star

 The renovated Star theatre threw open its doors for cultural activities of which theatre will be a big part under a private company on Friday evening, while Trinamul Congress blocked Bidhan Sarani and protested the governments move to privatise and turn Star into a cinema hall.

 Among those present on the dais in the auditorium, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay stressed that the privatisation move was to ensure proper running of the age-old theatre.

 Theatre cant survive on emotion alone. We need to look for avenues that will make it a commercial success too. We had talks with several theatre personalities about running Star and all of them said they wouldnt be able to shoulder such a huge expense. Hence, we decided to hand it over to a private company which had expertise in running such ventures, said the mayor.

 After almost a year of dilly-dallying, the Corporation handed over Star to Priya Entertainment Pvt Ltd in May 2006 for management through a public-private partnership.

 We ran into trouble while running Star after its renovation. The Corporation was losing Rs 4,000 per hour when the hall was given out on rent. Besides, the civic body doesnt have the expertise and experience to run a theatre. So we called a tender and only two organisations responded. We would have preferred a theatre group but no one came forward. Priya Entertainment was chosen because it had the experience of running Gitanjali in Bolpur and Krishti in Memary, said Bandyopadhyay.

 Among the many conditions that Priya will have to comply with is staging at least 10 days of theatre every month. 

 The Corporation would look after Stars upkeep, while its management is supervised by a 15-member advisory committee comprising the likes of Mrinal Sen, Sandip Ray, Sova Sen, Gita De, Mithun Chakraborty, Sohag Sen, architect Dulal Mukherjee and the municipal commissioner.

 I would have been happier if I could mark the reopening of Star with a performance on this stage, said Sova Sen, wife of Utpal Dutt. This theatre is a testimony to the neglect and insult towards Binodini Dasi. So the auditorium should be renamed Binodini Mancha And if need be, we have to take the help of films to sustain our theatre. Had Utpal been alive, I could guarantee that we would have revived Star.

 The inauguration was followed by a rendition of songs from theatre by Debojit and Riddhi Bandopadhyay. Saturday hosted a music recital by Dwijen Bandopadhyay, Haimanti Shukla, Shampa Kundu and students of Banichakra.

 A five-day childrens film festival has been lined up, starting Sunday. The films to be screened, at 3 pm and 6 pm every day, are Patalghar, Finding Nemo, The Chronicles of Narnia, Jungle Book 2 and Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne. Tickets of Rs 15 and Rs 25 are available at the counter.

 The new extension of Star includes an open-air theatre, a sprawling terrace courtyard with kiosks on one side, a glass-covered dining area and spaces for art galleries and a rooftop cafeteria.

 Calcutta missed this literary giant in Book Fair 2005 when so many authors were flown in from France, the years theme country. But Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio is here, at last.

 I have wanted to come to India for long. I am a Mauritian. For Mauritians, India is a motherland. But I was indisposed last year, a deep bass voice declares as the tall lanky man takes a seat at a city hotel.

 Though hes here for the launch of the English translation of his book Onitsha, Le Clezio says he has another purpose. Calcutta is one of the places where forefathers of the Mauritians migrated from. The boarding place was the junction of Hooghly river and Tollys Nullah. Le Clezio wants to identify that spot.

 But the author of award-winning novels like Le Proces-Verbal and Desert has lived in too many countries France, Mexico, Panama, Thailand, Nigeria, the US (his current address) to believe in boundaries. The French language is perhaps my only true country, he has stated famously.

 India could nearly have been the country of his origin instead of Mauritius, where his ancestors reached in 1792. After the revolution, people were dying of hunger. My forefather started for India in a boat with his wife and daughter. In the five months they were on sea, they nearly drowned, were chased by privateers, by the English, and sometimes they chased a smaller boat themselves. Halfway through, they landed at Mauritius and never set sail again.

 Le Clezio is unhappy with the wedges being driven through peoples, post 9/11. Despite all the boundaries we are trying to create, exchanges will take place. I am very optimistic.

 He is equally hopeful about the future of the novel. Novels started as a refuge for the imagination in the 19th century when people had no television. Times have changed and so has the novel. But there is no such hope for poetry. In Europe, poetry is dead. You have to reinvest poetry in the novel.

 According to Le Clezio, Tagore was one of the first storytellers who used poetry as a general expression. His short stories have a plot, yet you have a feeling that he is dealing with something beyond reality. Maybe Tagore was the inventor of the new novel.

 Le Clezios favourite is James Joyce, who introduces pieces of reality parts of songs, elements heard in streets, extracts from newspapers or advertising Its an interesting way to keep the novel alive.

 The citizen of the world wants to spend some time in India. Calcutta is not so much crushed by the past. I have seen some incredibly old people here. They move with the young and are not kept apart. And the place is full of humour, the 66-year-old smiles.

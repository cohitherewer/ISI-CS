 Concern at the corruption and decadence in society and faith that creativity has the power to supersede all wrongs and redeem it, were the two principal reasons for which a group of young artists founded Calcutta Painters more than four decades ago. Over time, the group drew other contemporary artists as members and became a communion for them to share their creative experiences. Charting new and, at times, rebellious routes of visual expression, they were scrupulous in their avoidance of the formalistic approach. The ongoing 42nd annual exhibition of their paintings, sculptures and drawings represents the renewal of the group?s faith in a world that appreciates the role of art in the building and reformation of society. Dedicated to the memory of Nikhil Biswas, who epitomised the ideals the group stands for, the show features the works of Anita Ray Choudhury, Bijon Chowdhury, Dwijen Gupta (one of his works appears above), Jogen Chowdhury, Prakash Karmakar, Rabin Mondal and Wasim R Kapoor, among others.

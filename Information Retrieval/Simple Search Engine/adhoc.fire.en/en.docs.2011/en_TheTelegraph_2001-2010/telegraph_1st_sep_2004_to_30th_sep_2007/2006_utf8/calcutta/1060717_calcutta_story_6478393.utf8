 Fitness facts 

 What: 

 Launch of certified fitness courses by B.D. Bangur Endowment 

 in association with BFY Sports amp; Fitness.

 Where: Bengal Club.

 When: July 13.

 Take a look: At the launch were present Rajeev Goenka, director BFY, fitness experts Anwar Wahab and Ranadeep Moitra, and Manjushree Bangur, trustee BD Bangur Endowment. The objective, scope and benefits of the proposed fitness courses were discussed.

 There has been a boom in the fitness segment but unfortunately Calcutta lacks professionally-trained experts. The courses should improve their quality and career prospects, said Ranadeep. The courses should help fitness trainers to be on a par with international standards, added Anwar.

 Basic programmes like Progressive Fitness Course and specialised courses like ACE (American Council of Exercise) will teach fundamentals of human anatomy, strength training, cardiovascular training, muscle workings and body composition. The focus will be on topics like exercise physiology, anaerobic and aerobic programmes, nutrition, communication concepts and client motivation, injury prevention and management. 

 Voiceover: The objective is to improve the quality of fitness instructors in Calcutta, an area in which the city is wanting, said Manjushree Bangur.

 In town on Saturday for the launch of two new VLCC centres, Bollywood babe Celina Jaitley spoke to GoodLife about style, fitness and more.

 Fit facts: A strong believer in ?health is wealth?, Celina is a fitness freak. ?In our profession, where you often need to work 48 hours at a stretch, fitness is a priority. My workout regimen depends on shooting schedules. But I exercise for a at least half-an-hour everyday.? Meditation, kick-boxing, Tai Chi and jazz ballet are her tips for that figure so often flaunted in a bikini on screen.

 Fashion mantra: ?Style is a state of the mind. To make a statement you need to be comfortable with your body and what you are wearing.?

 Dress code: ?For formal occasions it is a sari and if it?s chilling out then there?s nothing like a pair of jeans and a cotton shirt.?

 Accessory effect: Celina is passionate about long earrings. And when it comes to bags, only Gucci and D amp;G will do for the girl who began her beauty career in Calcutta.

 Shop stops: ?I love shopping in Mumbai, Los Angeles, London and Melrose.? For the perfect size and fit in jeans, Bangkok is the best.

 Sex siren: ?I have no qualms about being a sex symbol. I love the fact that people find me sexy. The eyes are a mirror of your soul and my sex appeal lies in my eyes.?

 Beauty secrets: When it comes to skin care, the lady chooses to go the old-school way. ?If I am in a hurry it is honey and lemon pack on my face.? For a relaxed indulgence, it?s a nice soak in the tub with sea salt.

 Current look: The long straight hair, now a few inches below the shoulders, is all done in curls. ?This is the new look for my Subhash Ghai film.?

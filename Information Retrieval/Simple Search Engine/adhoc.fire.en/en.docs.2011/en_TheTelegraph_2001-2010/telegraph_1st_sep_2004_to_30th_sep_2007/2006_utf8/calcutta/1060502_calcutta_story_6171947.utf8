 The principal of Sailendra Sircar 

 Vidyalaya, Dr Sahadev Banerjee, summarised the observations 

 of many educators at the panel discussion organised by The 

 Telegraph on April 28 when he said: ?Our children lag behind 

 in administrative services due to a lack of knowledge of 

 English.? 

 Held at The Bengal Chamber of Commerce, the discussion focused on the ?Role of educators in creating all-rounders for the future?. Though the heads of the institutions who attended the meet had vastly different problems at hand, they were unanimous on the all-important role of teachers in creating an interest in any subject amongst students. 

 Pushpa Sharma, headmistress of SS Jalan Balika Vidyalaya, stressed on an educated family background as the key to success for today?s youngsters. On the other hand, the panelists also blamed parents for exerting excessive pressure on their children by expecting them ?to be Sourav Ganguly, Newton and Manna De, all combined in one?.

 Krishna Chowdhury, principal of Mitra Balika Vidyalaya, suggested a solution to the problem. Convincing the teachers of state-run schools to make an extra effort, she said, could make the difference. K.A. Sedat, headmaster of The Park Institution, also put forth another side of the coin.

 He insisted that merits of teachers often remain underutilised due to the sharply deteriorating student quality in vernacular schools. He also blamed the ever-growing number of schools for the trend.

 However, all agreed that the students of vernacular schools face difficulty due to deficiency in English.

Crusade cry

 CRY launched its new anti-child 

 labour campaign at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre 

 on April 28. To mark the beginning of the campaign, there 

 was a screening of a film addressing the subject. It was 

 made by CRY volunteers, all of whom were young people ? 

 from school to college and even MBA students.

 ?This film is a first, because it was made entirely by volunteers. They raised the funds, shot the film and recorded the soundtrack all by themselves,? said Trina Chakrabarti, assistant manager of Youth and Volunteer Action at CRY.

 The film, titled Siraaj, took a look at the lives of the children of unemployed jute mill workers in Kamarhati. The movie illustrated the fact that the root of child labour is the poor economic situation of the parents. 

 The film featured children who earned only around Rs 25 per week, many of whom were unaware that they were working illegally.

 The lack of education opportunities in Kamarhati was also highlighted, with many children unable to go to school because of a lack of resources and infrastructure. ?With our new campaign, we want to raise more awareness about this national problem,? said Chakrabarti, who also pointed out that ?Bengal has a particularly bad problem with child labour, as children either migrate or are trafficked from other states to work here?.

 Child labour is also allowed to exist through numerous legal loopholes within the nation?s judicial system. To tackle this aspect, CRY distributed its new Child Labour Manifesto, which calls for changes in the terminology of what child labour is, in national legislation.

 ?At the moment, it is up to the police to prove that somebody is under-age, and in order to raid a premises suspected of supporting child labour, one must obtain a warrant. Such laws severely impede any progress being made in tackling the issue,? said CRY volunteer and second-year law student Vibhu Sharma.

 At the same event, there was also a reprise of an earlier exhibition, called Contact ? Black and White, comprising photographs by kids on child labour. In conjunction with the manifesto, CRY will also be conducting a signature campaign. After enough signatures are collected, they will be presented to the appropriate authorities.

 Star-struck

 National Institute of Technology, 

 Durgapur, played host to a galaxy of stars at Recstacy 2k6, 

 its annual cultural extravaganza, from April 25 to 28. 

 The day events at the fest (popularly known as Rex) were organised by the Literary Circle of our college, while the programmes in the evenings featured celebrities from the world of entertainment. 

 The first night was a rocking affair with Bangla band Kalpurush. Vineet, the finalist of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa, along with his troupe, kept the feet tapping with all eyes focused on the stage on the second evening. Shreya Ghoshal was arguably the top draw of Rex and she managed to live up to all our expectations on the third day. 

 She belted out some chart-toppers that kept the revellers on their toes. The Krosswindz performance was saved for the final night, turning the dais into a dance floor. DJ Abhishek capped things off in style, spinning out some popular music mixes.

 What: 

 Anniversary celebrations of United Colours of Benetton (UCB).

 Where: Venom at Fort Knox.

 When: Saturday evening.

 Take a look: The 40th anniversary celebrations of the apparel major in Calcutta kicked off with a fashion show that unveiled Benettons autumn-winter collection.

 Models Neeraj, Jessica, Tina, Rusha and others displayed an array of formal, party and casual wear through different sequences. Neo Noir was all about straight trousers, Bermudas with turn-ups above the knee, figure-hugging leather bombers, blazers, simple coats and wool jackets. Large collars with or without buttons and combination yarns were the highlights.

 In Postcards From, one saw trenchcoats, silk dresses, hooded jackets, shrugs and funky casuals. Something Poetic was truly poetic in look and feel silk flowers blended with tweed and herringbone, velvet with wool, tartan with heavy cotton. Corduroy pants and micro minis combined with snazzy belts were impressive. Gangs Of Workers had casual trousers in denims, heavy cotton and those with patch pockets teamed with striped or vintage check shirts.

 Tiny tots created quite a stir with their ramp walk. They flaunted denims, check wool sweaters, padded jackets, minis, legwarmers, boots, tie-up shirts and layered tops. The show was choreographed by Ajit Menon. 

 The audience enjoyed SMS games 

 and impromptu catwalks. Winners walked away with UCB goodies.

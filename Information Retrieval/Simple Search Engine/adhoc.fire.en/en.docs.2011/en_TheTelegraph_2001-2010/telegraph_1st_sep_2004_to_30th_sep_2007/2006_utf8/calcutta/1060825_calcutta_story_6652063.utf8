 Pandals in fix-roads cry

 - Police seek court revival of puja encroachment code

 OUR BUREAU

 An early Puja and a late monsoon mean double trouble for pandals and the traffic police.

 We have told police that unless BB Ganguly Street, College Street and even Nirmal Chunder Street are readied before the Puja, it will be difficult for us to follow the road rules laid down by the cops, said Badal Bhattacharya of College Square Puja Committee.

 Almost in anticipation of a chaotic carnival this late September, police on Thursday urged Calcutta High Court to revive the guidelines for erection of road-encroaching pandals. Last year, the high court, for the first time, had framed rules for pandals that involved a certain road space being left free and no stalls being put up on the streets.

 The guideline framed by the high court had helped the city police maintain order during the Puja days last year. We will request the court to renew that order this year, said advocate-general Balai Roy.

 The division bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya, assured the advocate-general that the matter would be heard in the first hour on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee will be present during the hearing.

 As the police prod various agencies from the CMC to CMDA to the HRBC to make some vital roads motorable before the festival days, the puja organisers are drawing up non-cooperation plans if the stretch leading to their pandal is potholed.

 College Square, Santosh Mitra Square, Simla Byayam Samity and Chaltabagan have joined the chorus of give us roads and we will follow your rules. Unless the roads are patched up, all work, like erection of gates and lighting will be held up, claimed Pradip Ghosh of Santosh Mitra Square Sarbojanin Durgotsav.

 Some puja committees have even demanded proper footpaths. The stretch in front of Lady Brabourne College is covered by huge stacks of stone chips, bricks and sand, pointed out Raghu Dasgupta of Park Circus Puja Committee.

 Police admit almost all major roads leading to north Calcutta pujas are in a mess. We have appealed to civic officials to speed up road repairs, says Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic).

 Tuhin Bera, member, mayor-in-council (roads), blamed it on Nature: We need at least a few days of sunshine for such repairs.

 K. Seetharam, director of Regional 

 Meteorological Centre at Alipore, held out no ray of hope 

 as the monsoon, he warned, could last till the second week 

 of October.

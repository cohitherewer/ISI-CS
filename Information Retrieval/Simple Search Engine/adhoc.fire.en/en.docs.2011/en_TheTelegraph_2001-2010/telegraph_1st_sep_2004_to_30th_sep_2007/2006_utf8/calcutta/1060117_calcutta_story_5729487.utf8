The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Terminal charge decided

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Orix Auto and Business Solutions Ltd (OABSL) on Monday bagged the contract for management of the Dhulagarh truck terminal in Howrah. 

 An agreement was signed between the company and Calcutta Mumbai Truck Terminal Ltd, which has been given the operational charge of the terminal. Orix Auto is a joint venture between Orix Corp of Japan and Mumbai-based Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd.

 After signing the agreement, M. Nakamuri, joint CEO of OABSL, declared the company would start operations from February 1. ?We will use our experience and expertise in running the terminal,? he said. 

 The Rs 60-crore project covers 80 acres and once fully operational, will have the capacity to handle 1,600 trucks at a time. Twenty per cent of the terminal is being utilised at present.

 It will also have warehouses for uploading and downloading goods, service apartments, a cinema hall, a food court and a rest house for drivers. 

 ?There are various reasons why the terminal could not be made fully operational. We expect to make it so within six months,? stated Ram Ratan Chowdhury, managing director, Calcutta Mumbai Truck Terminal.

 State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who was present during the signing of agreement, said the government was planning to bar entry of heavy vehicles into Calcutta. 

 ?Every day, more than 100,000 vehicles ply on city roads. The traffic congestion is steadily increasing. So, we are planning to stop trucks outside the city. Therefore, a number of terminals are being set up on the outskirts,? the minister stated.

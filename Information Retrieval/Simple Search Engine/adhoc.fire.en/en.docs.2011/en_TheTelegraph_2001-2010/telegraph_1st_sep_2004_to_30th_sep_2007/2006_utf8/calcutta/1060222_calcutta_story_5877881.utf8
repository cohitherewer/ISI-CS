The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Number plates cleared

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Vehicle-owners in the state will have to switch to high-security registration plates at the earliest. Legal complications over the issuance of a tender for supplying the plates in Bengal were resolved on Tuesday. 

 Calcutta High Court upheld the state government?s notification cancelling the earlier tender process. There is no legal bar on the state authorities floating a fresh tender, following the ruling.

 All vehicle-owners will have to buy the high-security plates for Rs 700. The Centre amended the Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, to make it mandatory for cars to have these plates.

 High-security plates have a reflective background and reflective embossing visible from a distance of 200 metres.

 They also have a laser coded mark (an alphabet and numbers denoting the name of plate supplier and vehicle manufacturer) on the right side of the plate, the name of country in blue (IND), and chromium-based hologram Chakra above the country name. The rear plate has a snap lock system.

 For four-wheelers, there is a third plate (a hologram) on the windshield, which once removed, cannot be used again. The hologram, in a laser code, bears the chassis number, engine number and the name of the local authority where the vehicle is registered.

 All this will help curb car thefts, government officials said.

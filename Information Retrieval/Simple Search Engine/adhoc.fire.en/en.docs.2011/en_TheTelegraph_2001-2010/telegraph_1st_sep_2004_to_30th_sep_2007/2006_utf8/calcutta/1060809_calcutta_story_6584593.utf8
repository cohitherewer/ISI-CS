 On a roll once more

 Hot kathi 

 rolls at Nizams on display 

 Nizams is set to serve its 

 signature kathi rolls again along and a slew of other 

 mouth-watering dishes from the second or third week of this 

 month, after a three-year closure for non-payment of rent 

 to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 And in its new incarnation Nizams 

 is coming up as a registered brand following a collaboration 

 with Howrah-based software company Algologix Limited the 

 central Calcutta culinary address with 400 covers will stay 

 open till 2 am.

 I am happy that Nizams 

 is going to resume business soon. Its rolls evoke a sense 

 of nostalgia in all of us, said mayor Bikash Ranjan 

 Bhattacharyya. Among those known to have favoured the kathi 

 rolls are Ritwik Ghatak, Jyoti Basu, Siddhartha Shankar 

 Ray and Kapil Dev.

 We will use the same giant 

 tawa used by Reza and Nizamuddin sahib around 

 75 years ago. Once 185 kg-heavy, it now weighs only 80 kg, 

 thanks to prolonged use and wear and tear, said Nizams 

 collaborator Lekhraj Kapoor.

 After it is reopened, Nizams 

 will be the first non-vegetarian eatery in Calcutta to use 

 ghee made from cow milk as the medium of cooking, Kapoor 

 added. The change in the medium will translate into a price 

 hike for food items, ranging from Rs 2 to Rs 5. There are 

 also plans to add a new dish, Prawn Biryani, and have a 

 separate dress code for waiters at the beef counter.

 Nizams is also ready to 

 spread its wings. We want to open outlets in Shyambazar 

 (near the five-point crossing), Gol Park, Behala (near the 

 tram depot) and on Picnic Garden Road in Ballygunge Place 

 (East), Kapoor said. 

 The landmark eatery was started 

 in 1932 by Hasan Reza, a group D employee with the civic 

 body. To please his English bosses, who had a strong dislike 

 for food that left oil in their hands, he introduced paratha 

 and kebab rolled together in a fine piece of 

 paper. Thus was born the kathi roll.

 eased with his innovation, the 

 bosses allotted Reza, then operating from a small stall, 

 a bigger room under a CMC building to the east of the civic 

 headquarters. The outlet was named Nizams after Rezas 

 son Sheikh Nizamuddin. The present actual owner 

 of the eatery is Nizamuddins son Irshad Alam.

 During the Trinamul Congress-BJP 

 regime in the CMC, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had slapped a 

 closure notice on the food stop following non-payment of 

 rent amounting to Rs 15 lakh and snapped its water lines. 

 After the change of power in the civic body, mayor Bhattacharyya 

 and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay allowed 

 the management to clear its dues in instalments, paving 

 the way for the re-opening.

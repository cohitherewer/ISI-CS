 Tikli theft at temple

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A gold ornament, fitted with a two-carat diamond, has gone missing from the forehead of an idol at Sree Sree Sitalnath Swamiji Temple on Badridas Temple Street, in Maniktala.

 The theft was noticed around 1.45 pm on Tuesday, when a huge crowd had gathered to make offerings to the deity as part of an eight-day ritual. 

 Sree Sree Sitalnath Swamiji Temple is among the cluster of shrines referred to as Parasnath Temple.

 Police said the ornament, popularly known as tikli, had been on the forehead of the deity since the 70s. A team of forensic experts has visited the temple and collected fingerprints, said an officer of Maniktala police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Only this Khan can...

 After Dilip Kumar (Devdas) and Amitabh Bachchan (Don), whose shoes should SHAH RUKH KHAN slip into? Heres a birthday wishlist

 Hamlet (Lawrence Olivier) Who better than SRK 

 to portray the tragedy of a man who couldnt make up his 

 mind? Madness and murder come naturally to King Khan having 

 done everything from Baazigar to Darr to Don. 

 And with all those SXP (Shakespeare, silly) monologues to 

 reveal the inner angst of Hamlet, SRK can deliver another 

 knockout performance. At 41, he may not look the 20-something 

 Shakespeare hero but then its all about the willing suspension 

 of disbelief.

 Shree 420 (Raj Kapoor) 

 Removed from the starry environs that Shah Rukh has been inhabiting for some time now, he needs a role where he can return to innocence, the tomfoolery of Chamatkar, Guddu and Karan Arjun. That coy smile, those goofballish gestures, those goggle eyes... SRK will make a great Raju, all over again. Remember Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman?

 Amanush (Uttam Kumar) After Devdas, its 

 difficult to imagine anyone else playing a drunkard better 

 than Shah Rukh. Bachchan fans, of course, still swear by 

 Sharaabi and Hum, but at 64, its a tad difficult 

 for Amitabh to play good/bad ol Madhusudan Roy Chowdhury. 

 As Madhu, SRK will get to love and lose, fight and fret 

 to his hearts delight.

 Mission Impossible (Tom Cruise) Shah Rukh has 

 always wanted to play the smart spy with a license to kill. 

 With Daniel Craig just given the new 007 tux, it may not 

 be a great idea to Bond with Bollywood but Agent Ethan Hunt 

 can be an inspired idea. SRK sure has a few things in common 

 from the dimples to the dynamism. He gave it a shot with 

 Badshah, but the comic vein has to be done away with, 

 Don ishtyle. And with him on the right side of the 

 law, even King Khans worst detractors may not get a reason 

 to disagree.

 Guide (Dev Anand) Yes, Rituparno Ghosh prefers 

 Akshay Kumar as the rahgeer rambler but who can con 

 better than Khan? His Dev Sharan in KANK might have 

 been grey but can there be a more balanced characterisation 

 than that of Raju Guide? The lonely lover, the natural fraud 

 and the spiritual soul Shah Rukh can draw from his existing 

 filmography and blend his many characters to make Guide 

 his very own. And when you have him lip-syncing to Din 

 dhal jaye and Kya se kya ho gaya, Bollywood tragedy 

 will get a whole new name.

 41st year

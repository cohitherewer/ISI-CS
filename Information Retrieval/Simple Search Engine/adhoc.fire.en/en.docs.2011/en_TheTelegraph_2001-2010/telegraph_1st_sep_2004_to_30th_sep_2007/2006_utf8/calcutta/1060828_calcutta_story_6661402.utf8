The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Missing in action, the passion

 Though KANK deals with 

 infidelity like no other mainstream Hindi film has ever done, 

 where is the sound of the heart breaking, wonders Chandrima 

 S. Bhattacharya 

 Infidelity is in the air. Dev and Maya, who have been at it in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (KANK) by Karan Johar (KJo), have plunged the nation into two serious questions.

 One: Is Hindi the official language of New York?

 Two: Since KANK boldly shows adultery as a part of life, has Bollywood arrived?

 The answer to question no. 1 is no, not yet. But Hindi will be instituted in NY officially as soon as Punjabi is declared the national language of Great Britain.

 The answer to question no. 2 is also no, not yet. For the following reasons.

 Agreed, KANK is the first mainstream blockbuster that has said, without stopping to clear its throat, that there is hope of another love post-marriage even if you stray. 

 However, I have some major issues with the way the straying happens. Dev (Shah Rukh) and Maya (Rani Mukherjee) leave partners who are in love with them, are attractive, warm, likeable human beings, while Dev and Maya are equally unprepossessing. Perhaps thats why they are drawn towards each other. But where is the fire?

 If you have to have an extra-marital (EM) for true love, it better show. It should at least sizzle. What is the point of going through all that mess if the heart doesnt go dhak dhak (a phrase used by an ex who left me)? Did the lovers hearts go even pitter patter in KANK?

 Here are a few select cases of burning, hissing, crackling, fierce and passionate cases of infidelity, marital or otherwise, that KJo is well advised to take a look at.

 We will quickly get Lord Krishna and Radha and Meera out of the way, as the blue gods dalliances constitute so much of our cultural and artistic and calendaral landscape anyway. But would Rhett and Scarlett sizzle so much in each others presence R whirling S up the winding staircase if she had not been perpetually married and dying for Ashley inside? Would the air between them have been so taut? Would Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn, be able to capture the vastness of their tragedy so concisely and make hearts bleed through centuries?

 Its significant that Gone With The Wind gets its title from a 19th-century poem called Cynara, a classic text of infidelity. 

 Last night, ah, yesternight, 

 betwixt her lips and mine

 There fell thy shadow, Cynara! 

 Thy breath was shed

 Upon my soul between thy kisses 

 and the wine; 

 And I was desolate and bowed 

 my head: 

 I have been faithful to thee, 

 Cynara, in my fashion.

 The British poet Ernest Dowson, in his 20s, had fallen in love with a 12-year-old girl of Polish origin, the daughter of a restaurant owner. She is Cynara in the poem, but she eventually married one of her fathers waiters and Dowson a few years later died of alcohol abuse, aged 32. 

 Though I have been faithful in my fashion has been the refrain of generations of men before Dowson and after, and its not really clear who he is cheating, who can ignore the triumph of despair and the music of such desolation of soul?

 And you are not turned on even when SRK and Rani make clandestine love in a hotel room. I have forgot much, Cynara! Gone with the wind

 Then there are Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary, who court disasters because they cant do otherwise. Only ruin can bring final satisfaction. But KJo need not look across centuries and continents. Cut to his own illustrious predecessor in Bollywood. 

 It is another thing that Yash Chopra returned the straying couple to their rightful spouses at the end of Silsila, but Rekha and Amitabh, whenever they are in the same frame, scorch the screen. And with A and R abandoned to each other, the look in Sanjeev Kumars and Jaya Bhaduris eyes in the Holi scene. Thats the sound of hearts breaking. The exquisite torture inflicted on the one who does not. That brings to mind Louise Bogans little poem Chanson un peu nave: 

 What body can be ploughed

 Sown, and broken yearly?

 She would not die, she vowed,

 But she has, nearly.

 l the pain, torture and trauma come together in the case of the woman who does it, too, in Whitney Houstons Saving All My Love for You, which has been adopted at all global fora as the Anthem of the Other Woman:

 Ive got to get ready, just a few minutes more

 Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door

 Cause tonight is the night, for feeling alright

 Well be making love the whole night through

 So Im saving all my love

 Yes Im saving all my love

 Yes Im saving all my love for you.

 Would Rani think in such a way about Shah Rukh? No, she would be happy if they just dusted the bookshelves together.

 Has Bollywood arrived? No, not yet. It still lacks the passion or maybe the fashion. Certainly the conviction.

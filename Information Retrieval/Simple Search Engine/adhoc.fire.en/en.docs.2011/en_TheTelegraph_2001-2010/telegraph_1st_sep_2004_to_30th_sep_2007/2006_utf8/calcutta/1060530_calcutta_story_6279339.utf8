 Plot rate key to IT growth

 Unionisation issues, exorbitant land prices, strikes and bandhs and slowdown in exports. Debesh Das, Bengal?s new information technology (IT) minister, has a lot on his plate. Whether wooing Infosys to ink a deal or treading the line carefully between trade unions and the corporate sector, Das has his work cut out.

 Das told Metro: ?With regard to land pricing, it has to be worked out very quickly, since we are in urgent need of plots. I plan to sit down with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Hidco officials soon to sort out the matter.?

 Manab Mukherjee?s successor admitted that the price of land in the state was higher than in other ?rival? IT destinations and that was possibly acting as a deterrent to potential investors.

 ?Bengal has been a late starter and we cannot afford to let these issues slow down progress. A major obstacle has been that most companies prefer land near the airport. We have been trying to convince them to look at other areas as well,? added Das.

 With Hidco standing its ground, leading to a rate war over plots, the IT department has decided to acquire land to the tune of 630 acres in phases. An expression of interest has already been issued for about 300 acres in Jagadishpur. Das said the land acquired by the department would be sold at a price substantially lower than the Hidco rate of Rs 2.16 crore per acre.

 ?The land rate will be lower than the prevailing rate in Rajarhat. We plan to select our associate from the private sector soon to develop the land. I am hopeful that we will be able to accomplish this by June or July,? he added.

 Software giant Infosys has shown interest in setting up its next campus in the city. The company even sent a team to scout possible locations. Despite chief mentor N. R. Narayana Murthy praising Calcutta for its infrastructure and the chief minister for his initiative, the land pricing issue at Rajarhat has been the roadblock to a deal.

 ?We have sent an e-mail to them and expect a reply very soon. The land pricing issue is the main problem. In fact, the Infosys matter was the first point of discussion between the chief minister and me. We are going to sit down with Hidco and try to sort it out soon,? said Das.

 While he would not want a September 29, 2005-like bandh during his tenure, Das also made it clear that unionisation in the IT sector was an issue where he would toe the party line.

 ?According to our party policy, workers have the right to form unions in the IT sector and have a collective bargaining power. However, we understand that work in the BPOs cannot be disrupted. It depends totally on whether they want unions or not? The party will not do anything to hamper investments,? elaborated Das, clarifying that forming a union did not necessarily mean calling strikes.

 He promised to take steps to improve the crumbling infrastructure in Sector V.

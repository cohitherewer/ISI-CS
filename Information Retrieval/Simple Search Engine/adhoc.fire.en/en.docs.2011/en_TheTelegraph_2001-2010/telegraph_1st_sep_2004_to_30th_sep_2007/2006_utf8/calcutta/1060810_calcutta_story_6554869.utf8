The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask, You Answer

 Safe today, sorry tomorrow

 Todays question: Is Calcutta as 

 vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai? 

 More responses will be published next week

 Day of terror: Police officers cordon off an area after 

 the London blast (AFP) 

 Vinay Shreshtha,

 Salkia, Howrah 

 Yes, of course. We are not only 

 vulnerable to terror attacks but also to natural calamities. 

 But Calcutta is safer than the other metros. 

 K akali Mukherjee, 

 Address not given

 I think Calcutta is more vulnerable 

 to terror attacks than Mumbai. Police here are lackadaisical 

 towards public safety. The government acts only after something 

 of the magnitude of the American Center attack occurs. Cinema 

 halls, Metro Railway and shopping malls are easy targets 

 for terrorists. Its time for the authorities to do something 

 apart from chalking out action plans.

 Rimli Datta, 

 Address not given

 Calcutta is a huge, densely-populated 

 city. It cannot but be vulnerable to terrorist attacks. 

 Large-scale immigration into the city from neighbouring 

 states and countries poses a potent security threat. Public 

 places in Calcutta like Metro stations, cinema halls, railway 

 stations and parks are totally exposed to such attacks.

 Md. Sarfaraz alam, 

 Kamarhati

 For the Metro Railway authorities 

 and other Calcuttans, the wake-up call came as early as 

 July 7 last year with the London Underground blasts. The 

 Mumbai blasts were a reminder that mass transit systems 

 are now the prime targets of terrorists.

 P. Pramanik,

 Address not given

 The possibility of terrorist attacks 

 in Calcutta similar to those carried out in Mumbai cannot 

 be ruled out. The states proximity to the international 

 borders makes it especially vulnerable. Unfortunately, the 

 detective department of police serves the ruling party rather 

 than the public. Under such circumstances, terrorist strikes 

 are inevitable. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 I dont think so. But the government 

 should not withdraw the safeguards against possible terrorist 

 attacks. There should be round-the-clock vigil at Sealdah 

 and Howrah stations, places of worship and other monuments. 

 Armed forces should be deployed to bolster security. The 

 men in uniform should be provided with modern weapons, metal 

 detectors and sniffer dogs. The common people and NGOs can 

 also play a vital role in checking terrorist activities. 

 D.P. Bhattacharya,

 Sonarpur

 Anti-terrorism squads cannot prevent 

 terror attacks as was demonstrated by the aeroplane strikes 

 on World Trade Center. Calcutta is a safe haven for terrorists. 

 They often take shelter in the city. They do not organise 

 attacks in Calcutta because they do not want to blow their 

 cover. 

 Udayan Banerjee,

 Bhadrakali 

 Calcutta is as vulnerable to terror 

 attacks as Mumbai. In fact, the city has become a gateway 

 for terrorists from Bangladesh. Moreover, the security arrangement 

 here is not up to the mark. Sometime back, even the chief 

 minister had expressed concern about the mode of functioning 

 of madarsas in Bengal. We are just fortunate not to have 

 faced a major terrorist attack.

 S.N. Mitra, 

 Beleghata

 Poverty is the root cause of terrorism. 

 So many years after Independence, the majority of the people 

 in the state are poor. It is only natural that a portion 

 of this group will take up arms.

 Basant Choudhary,

 Kankinara

 What happened in Mumbai could 

 easily happen in Calcutta. But our government does not seem 

 alive to the threat. Special task forces are needed to pre-empt 

 such attacks. Otherwise, terrorists will turn our country 

 into a graveyard.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 As far as terrorist attacks are 

 concerned, there is no safe place in India. In the past 

 few years, terrorists have laid siege on places that were 

 thought to be well-protected. The attack on American Center 

 a few years back was one such instance. Unfortunately, security 

 measures remain farcical at best in the city. There can 

 be an attack anywhere anytime. Those who think they are 

 living in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees oasis of peace are 

 living in a fools paradise.

 GOPAL KRISHNA BHATTACHARYA

 Director, West Bengal Fire Services 

 Terrorist attacks can happen anytime 

 at any place. Calcutta is no exception. We are quite well-equipped 

 and competent enough to handle such situations. I am not 

 saying that we do not need more men and better equipment, 

 but being a practical man I would rather focus on what we 

 can do with the existing resources. If we can tackle gigantic 

 fires, I am sure we will not be found wanting in dealing 

 with terror attacks. Having said that, the responsibility 

 of dealing with such matters rests more with police than 

 us. Preventive planning is important but one can never predict 

 the outcome of a terror strike. We start co-ordinating with 

 police after something major happens.

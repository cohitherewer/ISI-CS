 Medical students and junior doctors in the city and across the state will take part in an all-India strike against the increase in reservation in higher education on May 25. 

 Students, junior doctors and the state unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) have so far supported the nationwide protests against the hike in reservation with token demonstrations and rallies.

 ?Medical colleges and hospitals in Calcutta and other parts of the state will take part in the nationwide strike in hospitals on May 25. If the Centre does not change its stand, we will have no option but to continue the movement,? declared Sudipto Roy, previous national president of the IMA. 

 The strike is likely to affect services in the hospitals. According to the plan, the outpatients departments will be shut. Emergency services, however, will be rendered.

 ?The strike is for the benefit of the patients. If reservation in medical colleges is increased, the quality of health services will be affected,? reasoned Roy.

 On Monday, more than 2,000 medical students, interns, house staff and postgraduate trainees, along with some senior doctors, wore black badges to protest the hike. Students boycotted classes at Medical College and Hospital (MCH) and Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital, and held demonstrations.

 Elsewhere in the state, there were protests at medical colleges in Bankura, Burdwan, East and West Midnapore and north Bengal. Junior doctors and students wore black badges as a mark of protest against the quota system. 

 ?Services at hospitals were not affected due to today?s protests,? said director of medical education Jayasree Mitra. 

 ?The class boycott will go on for an indefinite period if the authorities do not withdraw their decision,? stated Satyajit Das, a member of Youth for Equality, the forum coordinating the protests. ?We are shocked at the way our colleagues in Mumbai were beaten up by police,? he added.

 The protesting medical students have organised a rally on Tuesday. It will start at MCH at 2 pm and proceed to Esplanade along CR Avenue before turning into Rani Rashmoni Avenue.

 The protesters have sought appointments with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

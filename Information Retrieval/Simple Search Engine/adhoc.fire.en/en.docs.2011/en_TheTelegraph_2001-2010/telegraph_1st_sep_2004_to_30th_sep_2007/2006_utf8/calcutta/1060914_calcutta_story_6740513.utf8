 Murder probe in student death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has formally launched a murder probe into the death of MBA student Joyjit Mukherjee.

 The 25-year-olds body was found by the railway tracks near Dunlop on August 17.

 Officers of Government Railway Police (GRP), who were investigating the matter earlier, had put it down as a case of suicide.

 A medical examination and the post mortem have confirmed that the injuries on Joyjits body were homicidal in nature. His family members, however, have not complained of murder.

 Joyjit was murdered and his body was dumped by the railway tracks to make the death appear an accident, stated D.P. Tarania, inspector general (II), CID.

 We have prepared a list of suspects. All of them were known to Joyjit. Some were his classmates. We are trying to collect evidence against them, he added.

 There was an injury on the back of Joyjits head, and dirt and black spots on his clothes. The medical report mentioned that the student could have been killed by a blow to the back of his head with a blunt weapon.

 Since there was no blood on the spot where the body was found, it appears that Joyjit was killed somewhere else, explained a CID officer working on the case.

 Discrepancies between the statements of the people who had last seen Joyjit alive and the report submitted by the GRP had set the sleuths off on the murder trail.

 Elaborating on the murder motive, an officer of CIDs homicide wing said: It appears that the murder was committed over a trivial issue. Joyjit had an altercation with his friends hours before his murder.

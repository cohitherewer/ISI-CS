 Green whip for wedding houses

 JAYANTA BASU

 Several complaints over the past few months have prompted the state pollution control board (PCB) to clamp curbs on ceremony houses in the city and beyond.

 From now, the houses will have to provide an undertaking that loudspeakers or sound systems will only be used between 8 am and 10 pm and that too, after ensuring that ?no noise escapes the covered area of the premises?.

 Bursting of firecrackers has been banned and generator sets have to be kept within a ?fully-covered area? with adequate pollution control system?.

 The owners of the ceremony houses have been directed to store the waste generated during functions ?in an environmentally-safe and decent manner within the boundary of the premises? (to) be disposed of properly within 12 hours? of the completion of the programme.

 ?We have been receiving complaints from many places in the state, especially Calcutta. Most ceremony houses have become environmental nuisances for the people living in the neighbourhood. Hence, the guidelines have been framed,? explained senior law officer of the PCB Biswajit Mukherjee.

 The majority of the houses are located in congested areas, compounding the problems, he added.

 The complaints registered with the green watchdog generally deal with the noise made by the generator sets, constant movement of cars, bursting of crackers, playing of loud music and washing of utensils. Smoke and dumping of waste around the houses have also irked neighbours.

 ?The most irritating aspect about these noises is that they never cease and usually continue beyond midnight. It is a torment to live close to ceremony houses, especially in winter, when there is an occasion every second day,? stated a complainant.

 Chairman of the PCB Sudip Banerjee said: ?We had to penalise a ceremony house in Belghoria for violating the norms of loudspeaker use.?

 According to PCB officials, strictures ? from temporary closure to fine ? have been passed on a number of ceremony houses on the basis of complaints. The penalised houses include some in Alipore and on Diamond Harbour Road, as well as buildings on the fringes, such as in Ariadaha and Sodepur.

 The civic body is in the process of forming a task force on the matter. Officials of the PCB will be part of the panel. Till it comes up with recommendations, the owners will have to abide by the green board norms.

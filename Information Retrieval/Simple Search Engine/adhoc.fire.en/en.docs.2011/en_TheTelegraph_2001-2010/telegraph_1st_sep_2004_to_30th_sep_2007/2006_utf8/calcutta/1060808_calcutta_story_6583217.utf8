 of Chorabali in Rajasthan.

 Moving away from the usual drawing-room drama, Kaushik Ganguly has chosen the Rajasthan locale for his new megaserial, Chorabali.

 Written and directed by Kaushik, the tale revolves around the parallel lives of two brothers and how marriage unites two families prey to the politics of the India-Pakistan border. Social problems related to health and medical facilities are also woven into the script.

 Im bored of typical family dramas. They dont excite me anymore. Viewers, too, deserve a break from the monotony of local and personal problems depicted in daily soaps and serials, says Kaushik, back in town after the first shooting schedule in Rajasthan.

 Chorabali boasts an impressive line-up of actors like Pijush Ganguly and Parambrata Chatterjee who play the two brothers. Then theres Churni Ganguly, Dulal Lahiri, Saswati Guhathakurta, Rajesh Sharma and Mrinal Mukherjee, plus a host of Hindi theatre actors.

 Parambrata in the serial

 With plans of filming a major part of the serial in the desert state, Kaushik has undertaken an extensive shooting agenda with three more schedules waiting to take off.

 In the first leg of the shoot, the team has captured a vast range of Rajasthan, from the resplendent fort of Pokhran to the sandy village of Dabla. I want this serial to be more like a travelogue where the drama gradually unfolds in the uncharted terrain of Rajasthan and the snow-covered districts of Darjeeling and north Sikkim. These places lend an interesting touch of mysticism and magnificence to the subject, says Kaushik.

 Yung Thang and Rishap are the two snow-covered spots in Sikkim Kaushik has zeroed in on. The indoor shots will be canned in Calcutta where the cast and crew begin work in the first week of August. 

 Kaushik and his team plan to return to the exotic outdoors of Rajasthan in December. I have always preferred shooting at outdoor locations. It feels adventurous and Im comfortable shooting there, he adds. 

 Wife Churni Ganguly, who has been assigned the task of designing the costumes, says: Its difficult to experiment too much while working on serials because of budgetary constraints. But Ive tried concentrating on the colour, texture and cuts in order to demarcate the two different locations and distinguish the characters by the costumes they wear.

 Chorabali is slated to go on air soon after the Pujas. The team is targeting 350 episodes, after which the serial may be extended.

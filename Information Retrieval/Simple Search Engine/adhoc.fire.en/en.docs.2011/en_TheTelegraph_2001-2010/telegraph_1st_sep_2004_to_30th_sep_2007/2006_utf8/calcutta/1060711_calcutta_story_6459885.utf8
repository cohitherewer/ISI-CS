 Bengal has always been the one of the most fertile repositories of artistic talent in the country. Art of Young Bengal, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by some of the better known young painters from this state, is a celebration of the fresh, innovative trends in contemporary art that, at the same time, are natural extensions of the glorious artistic traditions of the eras gone by. The works on show are an attestation of the truth that no single predominant style rules the art scene now, as at any point of time. Instead, many trends co-exist harmoniously and inter-penetrate homogeneously, assimilating to become the style of that generation. Participating artists include Chandra Bhattacharya, Chandrima Bhattacharya, Chhatrapati Dutta (one of his paintings appears above), Debraj Goswami, Gautam Das, Habibur Rahman, Mahula Ghosh, Prasanta Sahu, Rajarshi Biswas, Samindranath Majumdar, Sheikh Shahjahan, Tanmay Samanta and Tapas Konar. Curator: Pranabranjan Ray.

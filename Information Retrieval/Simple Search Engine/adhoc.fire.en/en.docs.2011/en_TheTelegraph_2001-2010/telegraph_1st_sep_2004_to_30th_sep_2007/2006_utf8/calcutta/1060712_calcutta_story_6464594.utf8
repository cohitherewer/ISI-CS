 The iPod: Tech tool turns prize gift

 Imagine waking up to a free iPod in the mail, gift-wrapped, with compliments from school. That?s precisely the surprise pat on the back some meritorious students of Ashok Hall got. The overall and subject toppers from the school in the Class X and XII Board exams found Apple iPod Nanos and Shuffles delivered home, a few days after the results were declared.

 ?Times are changing, the children are becoming more information technology (IT)-savvy. Therefore, we have to change, too, and so do the gifts we give students,? says Meena Kak, principal of Ashok Hall. This year, the school did a first by rewarding toppers of the Board exams with iPods.

 ?We wanted to give them something practical, which they could use. We have been using iPods in the classroom for a year. The music and English teachers are given one from the school, which they use as teaching tools for listening exercises. It has been very popular and successful among students, even in the lower infant classes. So we came up with the idea of gifting students iPods. They were very happy,? adds Kak.

 Almost all schools reward their best students, but the traditional format covers books, scholarships, trophies, stationery or certificates. Birla High School does give toppers watches and The Heritage School gifted its first batch with Parker pens this year, but nothing quite like an iPod, and certainly not through home delivery.

 Encyclopaedias, storybooks, school texts, gift vouchers for books, scholarship amounts for further studies, cups, medals, plaques, certificates of honour ? all traditional tools to reward students who excel in the exams. But now, new tech tools are making slow but steady inroads into prize lists.

 ?The utility of a gift matters most when rewarding children to motivate them. The price of the product is not very important. An iPod is a useful gift,? observes Dr Kedar Ranjan Banerjee of the National Institute of Behavioural Sciences.

 Dangling the iPod as bait, in fact, begins at home. ?The iPod is a hot gift item for parents looking for something to give their children for doing well in exams. The demand is the most for entry-level models like Shuffle and Nano (1 and 2 GB) ? with the price tag ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 11,000 ? from students in Class VI and above,? says Apple dealer Sanjay Chordia.

 As a result, dealers are keen on pushing the product in schools with discounts and deals. Companies, too, are increasingly looking at the iPod as incentive for their employees. ?A software major and an auto company recently placed bulk orders for iPods as incentives for high-performing employees,? added Chordia.

 There couldnt have been a more glamorous 

 start to the first fashion week hosted by the glamour capital 

 of the country. Day One of Lakme Fashion Week kicked off 

 at NCPA, Mumbai, in style on Tuesday afternoon, with a flood 

 of star footsteps.

 First up, Sangeeta Bijlani and Azharuddin, who were among 

 the first-rowers for the inaugural show by Rocky S at 2 

 pm. Then a ramp act by John Abraham in a gorgeous black 

 suit capped the show.

 But the real star shower was saved for the show that followed 

 at 4 pm by young designer Surily Goel of Salaam 

 Namaste fame. Akshay Kumar with wife Twinkle was the first 

 to occupy the star corner, which was pretty soon filled 

 up by Preity Zinta, Ness Wadia, Amrita Arora, Sohail Khan, 

 Arbaaz Khan, Riteish, Chunky Pandey, Gauri Khan, Sonali 

 Bendre, Karan Johar, Dino Morea, Sanjay Kapoor, Neetu Singh, 

 Farah Khan, Ritu Nanda 

 If that reads like a film awards night guest list, 

 a generous sprinkling of Bollywood peppered Surilys 

 ramp as well. The high-voltage act had actress Neelam inaugurating 

 the first of the four sequences. Malaika Arora Khan made 

 an appearance in the final sequence, showing off her shapely 

 legs in a black and orange skirt.

 Salman Khan in a velvety black blazer and a bright red 

 shirt walked the ramp flanked by Neelam and Malaika as a 

 fitting finale to the star-studded show by Bollywoods 

 favourite budding designer.

 Surilys collection inspired by the rose explored 

 the varied moods of a woman in love. The romantic 

 and super-sexy line depicted the transition of a young carefree 

 girl in love to a glamorous woman. Its about 

 romance, be it fun flirtation or mature love. The rose being 

 the central theme brings it out through the prints, embroidery 

 and accessories, smiled Surily.

 A vast spectrum of vibrant hues and heavy embellishments 

 interesting prints, metallic and pearl ornamentation 

 defined the high-glamour look. Mostly georgettes, 

 combined effectively with crochet, lace and satins, formed 

 the fabric story. Skirts of every possible length, from 

 minis to knee-length to mid-calf and ankle, formed the mainstay 

 of the lowers, coupled with sexy tops in sheer fabric. Mid-thigh 

 dresses, slim-fit pants, poncho tops were seen aplenty.

 Its a fantastic, feminine, colourful and 

 highly energetic collection. The best thing about the collection 

 is that its very wearable; I could easily wear each 

 of the garments, smiled Neelam, after her first tryst 

 with the ramp.

 Femininity was the fashion focus of the day, with Rocky 

 having set the mood earlier with his pret line inspired 

 by the intuitive killer instinct of a woman.

 My collection is straight out of a fantasy fairytale 

 with the lovely Lolita as my inspirational muse, 

 said the designer. The colour palette boasted neutrals with 

 deep pastels, varied hues of pink and champagne, cherry 

 reds and forest greens, all highlighted with matte gold.

 Embellished with clear crystals, stones and polished pearls 

 with a lot of lace accents and floral motifs, the look was 

 soft but opulent. Fabrics were soft and flowing, like georgettes 

 and chiffons combined with rich weaves and faux fur.

 The silhouettes were flattering. Skirts, from minis to 

 long asymmetrical flowing ones, sheer tops in unusual shapes 

 often paired with fitted short jackets and shrugs, denim 

 skin-hugging pants, corsets and dresses of various shapes 

 made up the line.

 Its inspired by the 1940s and 70s. Its 

 for a woman who is flirtatious, sexy and a little naughty 

 who loves to socialise and party its my interpretation 

 of the diva, smiled Rocky.

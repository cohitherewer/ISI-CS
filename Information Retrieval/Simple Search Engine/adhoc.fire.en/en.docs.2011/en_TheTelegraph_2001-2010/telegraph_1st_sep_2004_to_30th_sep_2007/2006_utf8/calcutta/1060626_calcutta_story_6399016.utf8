The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Plea to ease water problem

 JAVED AHMED KHAN, Trinamul Congress MLA from Ballygunge and leader of the Opposition, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included Mohammad Ali, Ashok Kumar Hore, Ratan Sarkar, Robin Banerjee, Mohammad Mukhtar Ahmed, Mohammad Sharique Ehshan, Bilal Khan and Kuldip Jassi

Mohammad Ali: Potable water supply has been a chronic problem in the Palm Avenue, Ghasbagan, Camru Khansama Lane areas for over 30 years. The situation has not improved despite the construction of Park Circus booster station and the Kasba booster station. How do you plan to tackle this problem?

 Just after the Assembly election, I took up the matter with the civic officials. But your local councillor prevented me from acting on it. 

 However, if the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) water supply department does not take any step within six months, I will allot funds from my MLA fund and lay down pipes with bigger diameter in the area.

Ratan Sarkar:Waterlogging, unmetalled roads and no street lights are some of the major problems in the slum areas of Kasba. Can we expect some improvement?

 I don?t know what prevents your local councillor from solving these basic problems. New pipelines will be laid for water supply. I have already asked our Rajya Sabha MPs for some funds.

Robin Banerjee: Residents here always wanted a state bus route along Picnic Garden Road. A government bus route, M-10, was started. But within a few months the services were withdrawn to protect the interests of private buses plying on this route. Will you take an initiative to introduce a state bus on this route? 

 It entirely depends on the transport department. However, if you give me a mass petition with possible suggestions on the routes, I will take up the matter with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. I can also raise this question in the Assembly.

Bilal Khan: Residents of the southern side of the railway track have been demanding a college for the past several years. Before every election, the politicians assure us that a college will be built here. But nothing has been done in the past 20 years. You too had promised that a college in the Tiljala-Kasba-Topsia area will be built soon.

 I think you have got enough reasons to be frustrated. Give me a suitable plot and I will construct a college. I have already found a 10-cottah plot. Once the owner agrees, the construction can start. 

 I can assure you that if the state government doesn?t pay any heed to your demand, I will take up the initiative to build one.

Mohammad Sharique Ehshan: A CMC vat in the residential locality of Shamshul Huda Road, has turned the entire area into hell. Every morning, the civic conservancy department uses this vat as the collection point for garbage from other areas. The vat is then cleared around 2.30 pm. People living in the area cannot put up with the foul smell. Can you help us in launching a campaign against this present practice?

 It is a mystery to me why the local councillor has been allowing such a thing in utter violation of all norms of health and sanitation of a residential area. There is a suitable CMC plot nearby for dumping the garbage. I am ready to help you in launching a campaign. But before that I will take up this matter with the mayor and the municipal commissioner.

Kuldip Jassi: The area on either side of EM Bypass connecting Picnic Garden Road is in a shambles owing to lack of proper drainage facilities. There is also no potable water supply in the Bagdipara and Tiljala Road area, close to the Hindu burial ground. Is there any solution to this? 

 People living in these areas are suffering due to the indifferent attitude of the local councillor. It is strange to know that in Punjabipara in the Tiljala area, there are no street lights for the past 15 years.

Mohammad Mukhtar Ahmed: Excavated roads in Jhowtalla Lane are lying unfilled for the past six months. Will you look into the matter?

 I will take it up with the municipal commissioner.

Ashok Kumar Hore: A number of stall owners who were evicted for the construction of Bondel Gate bridge have not been rehabilitated. Will you look into the matter?

 Give me a detailed report on this. I will take up the matter.

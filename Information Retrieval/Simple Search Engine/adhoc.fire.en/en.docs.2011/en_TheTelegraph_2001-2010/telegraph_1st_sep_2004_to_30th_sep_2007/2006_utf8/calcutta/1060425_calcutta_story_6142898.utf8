 The panther returns

 Beyonce Knowles 

 and Steve Martin in The Pink Panther, releasing 

 this Friday 

 Come Friday and the Pink Pather?s gonna get you. Stepping into the shoes of the hilariously inept French detective Inspector Clouseau will be Steve Martin, who storms the Calcutta screens with Kevin Kline, Beyonce Knowles and Jay Reno.

 The legend of the Pink Panther began back in 1963 when Blake Edwards made The Pink Panther with Peter Sellers in the role of Clouseau. Sellers wasn?t even Edwards?s first choice ? it was Peter Ustinov ? but his performance proved to be the film?s lasting legacy and the actor went on to star in several popular sequels.

 For more than a decade, the beloved franchise has remained dormant, waiting for an actor versatile enough to do justice to the hilarious screen persona. According to the new Pink Panther director Shawn Levy, ?The Clouseau character is a homage to silent film comics like Chaplin and Keaton. As imagined by Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers, the character referenced silent film comedy where the humour was physical rather than verbal. What makes Steve Martin the perfect Closeau is his incredible, unique talent as a physical comic.?

 In the latest Pink Pather adventure, the bumbling Inspector Closeau (Steve Martin) takes on his most important case ever. World famous soccer coach Yves Gluant has just led Team France to victory over Team China. Surrounded by grateful adoring fans and his beautiful lover, pop star Xania (Beyonce Knowles), Gluant is felled by a poisoned dart. In the ensuing panic, Gluant?s priceless diamond ring, The Pink Panther, mysteriously disappears.

 Cracking the case falls to Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline), who presses the indefatigable Inspector Clouseau into service. Clouseau and his new assistant, the steadfast, stoic Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), follow a tangle of clues that leads them all over Paris and then New York City. 

 ?When I first got offered the part, I said no. I didn?t think it was right for me,? Martin says. ?But I thought about it and thought about it and I tried writing a few scenes to see if I could get my head around it, and they seemed funny. Still, you need an audience to test comedy and Shawn turned out to be my first audience.? 

 Both Levy and Martin were aware that Blake Edwards?s original movies with Peter Sellers were regarded as classics. ?We?re not trying to compete with or top the original Pink Panther movies,? says Levy. ?Steve and I were appropriately respectful. But while we honoured the history we were inheriting, we were trying to reinterpret the franchise. We were hoping to make something relevant and current but still in the tradition of The Pink Panther movies.? 

 Levy adds: ?I have my Clouseau and it?s Steve Martin. And hopefully I?ve tailored the movie and the style of my film-making to my star. With any luck I will be able to maximise the specific talents of my Clouseau the way Blake Edwards did with his.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 14-hour slog sans food

 - ATC morning shift fights odds to keep flights on course

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They clocked in to work at 7 am and had to slog for more than 14 hours at a stretch. 

 While thousands of Airports Authority of India (AAI) employees shouted slogans against the Centre, the 20-odd Air Traffic Control (ATC) personnel were struggling to keep things normal at Calcutta airport.

 Their only reward: sarcastic remarks from colleagues, who even stopped food from entering the building that houses the regional executive director?s office, from where ATC operates. ?We did not have food for hours,? said a ATC staffer. 

 They had gone through a similar ordeal during the general strike in September last year, when the rest of the staff observed a cease-work. 

 Usually, the ATC works in three shifts, starting 7 am, 1 pm and 7 pm. On Wednesday, there was effectively only one shift. Those who reported for duty at 7 am were relieved after 9 pm, when the union bosses allowed a fresh batch of employees to enter the building. 

 The agitators had blocked the main entrance of the building at 10 am. ?Since then, they were not allowing anyone to enter. Since ours is an emergency duty, we could not leave our seats,? said an employee.

 In the afternoon, they had ordered bread and bananas from outside. But the protesters intercepted the food and some of the packets were thrown away. ?We will not allow these to be taken inside,? one of the protesters shouted. 

 The agitators also allegedly threatened one of the ATC members. 

 Hours later, in the evening, dry food was allowed inside at the instance of CPM parliamentarian Amitabha Nandi.

 ?Despite all the odds, we are trying to keep things normal,? one of the ATC staffers said. 

 The situation was normal for some time after 10 am, when airport employees began a stop-work across the country. It went out of control after fire service personnel withdrew from work. 

 ?Though the state government had sent two fire tenders, they are not equipped to handle an emergency,? an official said.

 ?We could not run the risk of operating flights and it was conveyed to the authorities,? an ATC official said. ?The battle was lost.? 

 Operations resumed around 6.15 pm, when Indian Air Force fire services personnel arrived. ?It was then a mad rush of flights arriving and taking off,? said an official.

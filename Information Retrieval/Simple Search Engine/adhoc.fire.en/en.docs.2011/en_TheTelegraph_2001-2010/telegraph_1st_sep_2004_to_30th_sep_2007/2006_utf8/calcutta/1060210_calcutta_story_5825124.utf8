 From disciplines as diverse as literature, theatre, art, design and anthropology, members of The Creative Commune work together to synthesize composite genres that can provoke the community to think beyond its limits. Their current production takes on two very well-known plays by 20th century American playwright Tennessee Williams, The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire. Performing climactic sections from each of the plays, they look to create a dialogue between the nostalgia evoked by the plays? Hollywood film versions and the present performance. Offering intense experiences that tend to hold the audience on a leash by their sheer dramatic force, the plays represent an attempt to integrate visual art and performance so as to generate an interactive atmosphere for their actors and audience. Greatly influenced by ?50s and ?60s Western pop art and music, the visual design of the plays helps recreate the ambience of their parallel Hollywood classics, besides the acting style and delivery of the actors, which deliberately recall those made famous by Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, who acted in the movie version of the plays. Direction: Trina Nileena Banerjee.

 Event: Performance of excerpts from plays in English, The Glass Menagerie and A Streetcar Named Desire, produced by The Creative Commune 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

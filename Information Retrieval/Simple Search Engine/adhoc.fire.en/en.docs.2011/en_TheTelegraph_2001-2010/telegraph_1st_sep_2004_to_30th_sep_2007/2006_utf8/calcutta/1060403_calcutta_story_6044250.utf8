 They call it the invisible virus and medical science is yet to find a cure. In India, the statistics are staggering. The Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) infects 1,400 Indians daily on an average. There are roughly 25 million people worldwide afflicted with AIDS, of whom five million are in India.

 AIDS is no longer just an endemic, it has assumed pandemic proportions. Yet, knowledge and awareness about the disease in India remain pitiful.

 The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS) and the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society have created The Learning Tree, a unique symposium designed to equip youngsters as well as educators to make safe choices, improve their emotional capability to help them combat HIV/AIDS and to spread awareness about the disease. The Learning Tree, the third symposium of its kind held at Kenilworth Hotel last Friday, saw teachers as well as well-known personalities come together and discuss the importance of life skills, which includes sex education, a subject sorely neglected in our education system.

 The panel discussion, moderated by PR person Rita Bhimani, was quite an animated affair. Panelists Barry O?Brien and Churni Ganguly pointed out that it was the duty of every educationist and parent to teach and inform their ward about the basics of sex and the different biological functions of the human body.

 ?Children have a right to information. Parents as well as teachers have to be extremely transparent with them, as well as empathise with them during their period of adolescence, which can be an extremely trying time for a child,? said O? Brien.

 While the importance of sex education could not be overstressed, all the panelists bemoaned the current sociological situation, which they felt, did not allow frank discussion between the mentor and the child.

 ?The concept of value education is not prevalent any longer in our educational system. In fact more than sex education, we need to discuss sexuality as a whole, which has a far wider ambit,? said panelist Saloni Priya.

 The role of the media, too, came in for severe criticism, with a large number of people attributing the lack of sexual knowledge amongst the youth to the ?twisted and distorted versions of sex? as portrayed by the media.

 ?Television plays a major role in the lives of our children today. Unfortunately, some of the programmes shown on TV do not provide its viewers with the right picture. Social mores and norms are distorted in most of these shows, and that has to be corrected,? said Priya.

 Paromita Chakraborty, faculty, department of English, Jadavpur University, did not refute Priya?s claim, but said media-bashing was not the answer. ?One cannot put a blanket ban on the media. It has its uses and teachers and parents both need to understand the current media scenario and use it to their benefit. One must not forget that the language of the media is the language of the youth.?

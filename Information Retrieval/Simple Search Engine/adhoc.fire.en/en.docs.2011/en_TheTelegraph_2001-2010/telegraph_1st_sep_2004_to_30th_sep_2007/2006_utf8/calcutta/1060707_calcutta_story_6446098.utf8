The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Combat plan in dengue rerun

 OUR BUREAU

 A fresh dengue case was reported at RG Kar Medical College on Thursday, even as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) announced an action plan to combat the disease.

 The RG Kar authorities said the blood sample of a patient, a resident of Ashoknagar, on the northern fringes, had been sent to School of Tropical Medicine. ?The report came today and it was positive,? said superintendent K. Roy.

 With the number of dengue cases rising, the CMC said it would press into service 15 mobile clinics to visit every ward and collect blood samples. ?The clinics will start operations from Monday,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. The samples will be sent to Indian Medical Council for Research for tests.

 ?Since boys and girls up to age 16 are more vulnerable to dengue, we are advising parents to send them to school in full-sleeve shirts,? Bandyopadhyay said.

 The civic body on Thursday released the names of 14 patients who had suffered from dengue since January. It also slammed health department officials for keeping it in the dark about these cases.

 Dengue being a notifiable disease, it is mandatory for all agencies to inform every case to the local health authority. ?The CMC is the local health authority for Calcutta, but was not informed about the cases in time,? said mayoral council member (health) Subodh De.

 ?We were informed only early this week. Otherwise, an anti-mosquito drive could have been launched in the affected areas,? a civic official said.

 The health department claimed the earlier ones were stray cases. ?Dengue season starts from July,? said director of health services K.C. Barui.

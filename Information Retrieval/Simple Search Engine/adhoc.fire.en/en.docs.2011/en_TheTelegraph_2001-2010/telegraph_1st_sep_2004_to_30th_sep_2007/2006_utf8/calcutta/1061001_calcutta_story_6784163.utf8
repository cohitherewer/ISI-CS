 Ad Lib

 AB as hero of the communication

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 At last, there is a campaign where 

 Amitabh Bachchan does not steal the show. He merely supports 

 the brand the hero of the communication. More about that 

 later. As we all know, it takes all kinds to fill the briefcase 

 of an ad man. There is the straightforward category of products 

 where the benefits on offer are apparent and cognisable 

 the taste of a chocolate or lather of soap. For these, 

 the ad man needs to be convincing and hope that it passes 

 the test of consumer experience. Then there is the other 

 extreme where the payback is completely intangible and perceptual 

 perfumes. This is the ad mans forte.

 There is nothing about the aroma 

 in a bottle that can be proven or established. Much like 

 beauty being nestled in the eye of the beholder, it is all 

 in the mind. Hence the challenge for the ad man is to create 

 an aura; some might say an unreal imagery. And then there 

 is a third category of products. This is the tricky group. 

 Here the benefits are apparently measurable dry cells 

 fall into this category. Ask any consumer and he will tell 

 you that he chooses that brand of battery which lasts longer 

 and gives more powerful light or sound. Relevant and rational 

 parameters of evaluation you would say. 

 The problem is the hypocrisy embedded 

 in that apparent rationality. Do you know of many people 

 who note down the date when batteries are bought and when 

 they get exhausted? How else would anyone know how long 

 the set of batteries lasted? Can you think of a way by which 

 a consumer can measure how many lux a torch emits or how 

 many decibels a Walkman pours into your ears when fuelled 

 by Eveready. How then can we sensibly compare that with 

 the performance when the flashlight is pregnant with Nippo? 

 Still, on both counts, we the consumers have very definite 

 views. We also believe that our use experience is scientific 

 enough to justify such convictions.

 This indeed is a tricky area and 

 a bit slippery too. The consumer feels that he is being 

 rational when actually he is not. Tell the consumer that 

 and he will react: how dare you challenge something that 

 I have myself experienced? So advertising has to be cautious. 

 It has to pamper his ego, his irrationality and yet subtly 

 create a perception in favour of the brand on the so-called 

 rational parameters.

 This is where the latest series 

 of Bachchan ads for Eveready has excelled. It is a pity 

 that they are not shown as often on TV as one would like 

 to. Be that as it may, the new series shows highly improbable 

 but very humorous situations in which AB plays the shopkeeper. 

 The toy car that the kid brings in becomes a huge Sedan, 

 thanks to the Eveready inside. The lame man with his leg 

 in a cast starts break-dancing again, thanks to Eveready. 

 And finally there is this Lilliputian who grows full-size 

 after AB hands over a pair of Eveready pencil batteries 

 to him.

 The feigning is perfect; it is 

 a comic situation where the great man acts. There is no 

 pretension of reality. So the consumer is not perturbed; 

 the chastity of his wisdom has not been challenged. Yet 

 when you see the ads many times over, the retained content 

 is a simple three-word phrase about Eveready. Kudos to the 

 makers of the brand and their advertising partners exactly 

 the same phrase can be used about the advertising campaign. 

 Kuch to extra hai.

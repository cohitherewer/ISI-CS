 Research projects are finally set to roll at Calcutta University (CU).

 In an emergency meeting on Monday, the university authorities prepared a proposal identifying the areas in which research would be conducted with the funds recently sanctioned by the Centre and the state government.

 Metro had last week reported on the lack of initiative in undertaking research projects with the grants, to the tune of Rs 220 crore.

 ?We have prepared a detailed report specifying the areas in which our teachers and scholars are going to conduct research with the money given to us by the Union and state governments. The projects will revolve around emerging fields. We are also putting emphasis on social science research,? said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das.

 The research will start with immediate effect. Nano-science and nano-technology, bio-diversity, cancer biology, industrial statistics and modelling, structural chemistry, neuroscience and neurology and environmental science are some of the areas in which research will be conducted, according to Das. 

 Peace studies, globalisation and human security, business history, history of science and heritage studies are some of the social science subjects shortlisted for study. Research projects dealing with intellectual property rights are also in the offing, said an official of the university. 

 The initial instalments of the grants ? amounting to approximately Rs 45 crore ? have been released over the past three weeks. Many research scholars and teachers of the university were unhappy that a research policy had not been formulated.

 Das explained on Monday that CU had not been able to implement the projects under the University Grants Commission?s (UGC) centre of excellence scheme because it had not finalised its nominee for a research monitoring committee. The setting up of the panel is mandatory.The UGC has released Rs 10 crore as first instalment of the Rs 50-crore centre of excellence scheme.

 A considerable portion of the funds has been earmarked for infrastructure development. ?We have to spend money on developing our laboratories and installing modern equipment for conducting international-standard research. The university had not been able to upgrade its laboratories over the past decade due to a financial crisis,? the pro vice-chancellor held.

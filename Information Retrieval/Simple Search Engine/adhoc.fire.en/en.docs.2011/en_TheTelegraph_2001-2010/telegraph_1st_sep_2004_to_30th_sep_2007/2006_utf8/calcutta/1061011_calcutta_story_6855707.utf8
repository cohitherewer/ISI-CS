The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 While surfing the state governments official site (http://www.wbgov.com), 

 I was surprised to see that part of the information was 

 not updated. The state Assembly polls were held in June, 

 but the site continues to feature the old list of MLAs. 

 For instance, it has Satyanarayan Bajaj as the Jorasanko 

 MLA while at present son Dinesh Bajaj is the MLA. It seems 

 babudom bug has bitten our tech-savvy government. 

 Danish Khan, Nil Madhab Sen Lane. 

 This may be an exception. We update the site from time 

 to time. If anyone brings it to our notice, we will look 

 into the matter.

 amp; cultural affairs department.

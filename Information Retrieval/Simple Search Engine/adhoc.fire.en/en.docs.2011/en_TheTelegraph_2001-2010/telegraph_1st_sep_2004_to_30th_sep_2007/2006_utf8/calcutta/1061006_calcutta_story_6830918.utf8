IT TAKES DIFFERENT STEREOTYPES TO MAKE 

UP A VIBRANT GATHERING OF BENGALIS AT AN ANNUAL GET-TOGETHER ABROAD, WRITES ADRITA 

MUKHERJEE

Non-resident Calcuttan

The time of the year is approaching when every Bengali, 

no matter whatever corner of the globe hes in, suddenly becomes conscious 

of a stirring within himself. Puja is around the corner. We, the prabasis, 

may not wake up to the beating of the dhaak or get to see the undulating 

kaash, but our world is changing too. 

The tulips and daffodils are out, the camellias are 

painting the sky red, and theres a hint of spring in the air. This is the 

time when, whether they arrange for a Puja or not in their home from home, Bengalis 

all over the world gear up for their Puja do.

It has been rightly said that wherever a few Bengalis 

congregate, a cultural association is born. We pride ourselves on our rich heritage 

and strive to keep the cultural flag flying high. 

If by any chance we happen to live abroad, however, 

each of us is suddenly catapulted into the enviable position of an unofficial 

cultural envoy. The result is very interesting. I have exchanged notes with a 

few friends living abroad and found that practically anywhere in the world, the 

prabasi Bengali community behaves along similar lines. 

We have a few annual dos. We meet at a hired hall, 

eat butter chicken and rice, and most importantly, make good use of the stage. 

A few familiar types who can be seen during such an evening: 

The Butterfly

Female; age no bar. Main activity: flitting from one 

group to another, displaying the newest sari ordered specially from home. Harmless 

and decorative. 

The Poet/ Intellectual

He is what the insurance companies might refer to 

as an Act of God. He lies in wait for the entire year to spring his 

self-composed poems or philosophical lectures on you on the evening of the do. 

In some extreme cases, he also distributes photocopies 

of his poems (with English translations) or pink pamphlets describing his achievements.

The Silent Worker

Perpetually a part of the audience, the Silent Worker 

arrives early and chooses a seat nearest to the table where the snacks and drinks 

are set out. 

During the programme, when the lights are off, he/she 

makes frequent and quiet trips to the table. The conscientious Silent Workers 

remember to clap after each item, provided their hands are free at the moment. 

The Gossip

Can overlap with any of the other categories. The 

Gossip uses this opportunity to disseminate information and collect it for future 

use. Provides a major distraction from the programmes on stage and is more entertaining. 

The Critic

His discerning eye always finds something in each 

programme that was not done properly. He never offers to do it himself/herself 

the next time. 

The Cultural Emissary

These self-appointed and conscientious keepers of 

Bengali culture insist on singing/dancing/reciting/acting/all of the above, with 

complete disregard to mundane things like time. They cannot be cured, so they 

must be endured.

The Ambitious Mom

By far the deadliest, especially if overlapping with 

previous type. If theres any antidote to them its their own children. 

I have seen a three-year-old kicking her heels in 

and refusing to dance a single step, while the mother growled, pleaded, offered 

bribes and finally retired defeated. 

At the end, I must mention one who doesnt belong 

to the community but is a familiar presence at the functions. He is what I have 

always labelled in my mind as the Bechara Saheb. 

This poor white man is invited by some enthusiastic 

Bengali friend to sample Bengali culture and food. He sits through the programme 

bravely, not understanding a word, claps politely, and throws furtive and yearning 

glances at the buffet table. He is heroic in his fortitude, a lesson in endurance 

and brotherly love. My heart bleeds for him. 

And, finally, there is the real thing. 

Just when youre starting to become glassy-eyed and sink into a stupor, a 

perfectly nondescript man or woman whom youve known so far as a familiar 

dada or didi, goes up on stage and starts to sing. 

In a minute the world is transformed and everything 

else is forgotten. It is such a performance that makes you come to the next programme 

 yes, even at the risk of encountering all of the above types. 

And it is those dadas and didis who 

make you feel even if fleetingly that there is something special in being 

a Bengali, after all.

 Rethink over high road

 - Two ramps for Bypass flyover, southern end to be extended

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

Wiser after its flyover fiasco, the state government has decided to revise the plan for the proposed high road between Parama Island, on EM Bypass, and Park Circus.

 The Rs 400-crore, four-lane flyover designed to avert the perennial traffic bottleneck on the Park Circus connector was to come up between the Silver Spring housing estate, on the Bypass, and the Park Circus seven-point crossing, with no ramps in between.

 But the government is now considering an extension of the southern end of the elevated pathway to the AJC Bose Road flyover and building two ramps leading to Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Park Street.

 The problems posed by the Park Street and AJC Bose Road flyovers prompted the government to revise the original plan, officials said.

 We will finalise the details after talking to experts from IIT Kharagpur, Jadavpur University and Indian Institute of Architects and School of Planning and Architecture, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said. 

 Officials said the Park Street and AJC Bose Road flyovers have not been of much help as they dont have any ramps to distribute traffic. Besides, the Park Street high road would have been more effective had it been extended to Bentinck Street. Now, it only ends up increasing the congestion at Dorina crossing.

 The transport department will now have to spend Rs 34 crore to construct the necessary ramps. A plan is also afoot to build a flyover between Grand hotel and Bentinck Street-CR Avenue crossing at a cost of Rs 40 crore to ease the congestion at Dorina crossing.

 We want to build the Park Circus flyover in a way that commuters from the Bypass end can reach the central business district or take the Vidyasagar Setu without having to cross any traffic signal, said an engineer.

 If the flyover ends near the Park Circus crossing, the area will become more chaotic and the roads will remain chock-a-block during peak hours, said an engineer. 

 But if it terminates near the AJC Bose Road flyover, motorists coming from the Bypass can reach Esplanade or BBD Bag without much hassle. Those bound for Howrah station can take Vidyasagar Setu. The ramps will help disperse traffic, he added.

 About 35 per cent of the funds for the flyover is to come from the Centres National Urban Renewal Mission Fund. The rest will be borne by the state and the CMDA.

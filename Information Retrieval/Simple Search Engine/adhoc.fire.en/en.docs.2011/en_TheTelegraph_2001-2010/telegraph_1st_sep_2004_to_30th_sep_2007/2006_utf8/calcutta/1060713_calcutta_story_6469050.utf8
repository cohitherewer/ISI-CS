 A 

 THOUGHT FOR FOOD

 by Rashbehari Das 

 What: Elish Parbon. Where: Tero Parbon at 49C 

 Purna Das Road.

 When: Till August 15.

 The spread: From the simple fry to the elaborate pulao, 

 hilsa has been used in 18 items on the menu. While there 

 is a simple Elish Bhaja, you can also try the spicier Elish 

 Tel Masala Bhaja. Along with the traditional favourites 

 like Elish Bhapa, Elish Sorshe Jhal, Elish Paturi and Elisher 

 Begun Jhal, there are some lesser-known varieties like Mukhi 

 Kochu Diye Elisher Jhol and Kumror Kachkola Elish Jhol. 

 Among the must-haves are two signature dishes, Sahebi Elish 

 (hilsa cooked with mayonnaise and butter) and Malai Elish.

 Besides offering Elish Pulao, 

 there is also a platter that serves Khichuri with Elish 

 Maachh Bhaja. Also on offer are Elish Maachher Dimer Tok 

 and Elish Raita.

 Pocket pinch: The dishes are priced between Rs 75 and 

 Rs 120. There is also a buffet that serves three hilsa delicacies 

 and is priced at Rs 230.

 Voiceover: Even though there is a fish crisis 

 at the moment, we want to treat our guests to the best. 

 Hopefully, we shall continue the festival till the end of 

 the monsoon, said Subrata Ghose Chaudhuri, director 

 of the restaurant.

 Fish fare

 What: Elisher Mela.

 Where: Oh! Calcutta. 

 When: Till July 22, for lunch and dinner. 

 On the menu: The a la carte hilsa menu offers eight 

 exotic preparations (two of which are Continental and the 

 rest typical Bengali recipes) of Bengals favourite 

 fish.

 Try the Kumro Pata-e-Aam Achar 

 Ilish (boneless hilsa fillet marinated in a mixture of mustard 

 paste and chillies spiked with green mango pickle, wrapped 

 in pumpkin leaves and steamed) or the Grilled Hilsa with 

 Mushroom and Dill Ragout (boneless hilsa marinated with 

 spices, grilled over hot embers served with a creamy ragout 

 of mushroom and fresh dill).

 There are innovations like Shosha 

 Diye Ilish Maachh and Lebu-pata Koromcha Ilish (hilsa stewed 

 in a fragrant tangy broth flavoured with lime leaves and 

 seasonal sour berries).

 Pocket pinch: The dishes are priced at Rs 195-plus.

 Voiceover: Hilsa is a part of our menu all year 

 round but cliched as it might be, no monsoon is really complete 

 without an elish festival. Most recipes used are 

 ancient and we are proud to present it to our clients, 

 said Debasish Ghosh from Oh! Calcutta.

 Monsoon bite

 What: Parathawali Gali.

 Where: Nishidin, the 24-hour coffee shop at The Peerless 

 Inn.

 When: Till July 31.

 The spread: With the arrival of the monsoon in Calcutta, 

 the festival is a good eating-out option. While there are 

 the conventional parathas like Aloo Paratha, Gobi 

 Paratha and Paneer Paratha, you can also expect to find 

 some surprises like Mochar Paratha, Gosht Keema Paratha 

 and Murg Noorjahani. The parathas are served along 

 with curd and pickle.

 Pocket pinch: A meal here would cost around Rs 180 per 

 person.

 Voiceover: Monsoon is the right time to host such 

 a festival since everyone likes to relish hot and delicious 

 parathas, said Sarbendra Sarkar, F amp;B manager, 

 The Peerless Inn.

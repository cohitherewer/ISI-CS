 The transport department has extended the deadline for completing the Kidderpore flyover by three months.

 The new deadline is March 31 next year.

 Earlier, the deadline was set on January 16, 2007. After almost a decade, construction work of the bridge was resumed in January this year. 

 The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), implementing agency of the Rs 34-crore project, has given the contract to Mackintosh Burn Limited, a state public-sector undertaking.

 ?We had formally handed over the project to the contractor in January. But even after seven months, there is hardly any progress. If work continues at a similar pace, the flyover will not be ready even in two years,? pointed out a senior HRBC official.

 State transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, after meeting HRBC officials and the project contractor, has asked them to speed up construction work to meet the new deadline. 

 After visiting the site and analysing the situation, Chowdhury extended the deadline by three months.

 ?We have extended the deadline because of several problems. The contractor had to face some hurdles while construction near Karl Marx Sarani and Pahargunge Market. There were a few traffic-related problems, too. But we have sorted them out. We expect the flyover to be ready within the new deadline. If the contractor fails to adhere to the deadline, we will take penal action, which will include forfeiture of earnest deposit and compensation,?? Chowdhury told Metro on Wednesday.

 Officers in the transport department said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has stressed on completing the project within the deadline. 

 Sources at Writers? Buildings said the chief minister does not want a rerun of the problems faced over the commissioning of Bondel Gate bridge and the Lake Gardens flyover. He has asked the officials to clear the blockades near the construction site and closely monitor the project.

 Bhattacharjee has also asked transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to ensure that all ongoing development projects are completed within the deadline. 

 Apart from the construction of Kidderpore flyover, repair of tram tracks is also running behind the schedule.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Kick-off: go 

 crazy, stay cool

 On Day I of World Cup 2006, Metro 

 offers a survival guide for a month of soccer madness 

 DRESS 

 BRIGHT

 Can you watch Ronaldinho or Messi 

 without donning their country colours? Of course not. The 

 price may be a little steep at Rs 2,700, but Adidas is seeing 

 team jerseys of Argentina, Germany, Spain and France fly 

 off the shelves in city stores. Ditto for Nike jerseys of 

 Brazil, Portugal and Holland, priced at Rs 2,495. And the 

 pop picks are consistent with the soccer craze in Calcutta, 

 where Pele and Maradona are equally revered. ?Brazil and 

 Argentina are going neck and neck in sales with Brazil having 

 the slightest edge,? confirms a dealer. The official Adidas 

 ball (Rs 4,500) is another favourite.

 SIT 

 RIGHT

 The TV set should be at eye level, 

 at a distance of at least five to six feet. Sit upright 

 in straight-backed cushioned chair with head and lumbar 

 support. Sitting at an angle from the TV screen for too 

 long could be a pain in the neck.

 That Calcutta is becoming more 

 conscious of the cramp and the cringe is clear from the 

 queries reaching gyms about what to do during World Cup 

 viewing.

 ?An erect posture should be maintained 

 while sitting for such long hours because if the posture 

 is faulty back trouble is inevitable. Reclining chairs are 

 not advised,? says Divya Himatsingka of Gold?s Gym.

 LIMBER 

 UP

 When your heroes are sweating 

 it out, shouldn?t you do your bit to stay in shape? ?Stretches 

 and lower-back exercises are a must to keep fit through 

 the Cup month. Get up at brief intervals and take a short 

 walk; at half-time do some stretching to prevent stiffness,? 

 says Sabyasachi Roy of Addlife, the gym planning to distribute 

 a special-exercise plan among patrons watching the World 

 Cup.

 TO 

 SIP... 

 Dietician Shalini Agarwal prescribes 

 no more than two cups of tea or coffee for a 90-minute match. 

 ?Too much of tea and coffee will mar whatever chances you 

 have of catching some sound sleep,? warns Shalini. Her recommendation: 

 iced-tea flavoured with ginger or fresh lime with soda.

 If that isn?t your cup of tea, 

 mixologist Irfan Ahmed picks beer as the safest drink to 

 cheer the Cup. ?Or go for Sangria, an ideal summer beverage, 

 red wine flavoured with citrus and fresh juice.? If your 

 team wins, keep tequila shots handy, says Irfan.

 AND BITE

 Dietician Shalini Agarwal lists 

 some finger food to keep munching during the matches while 

 keeping those extra calories at bay:

 Sprouted bhel (puffed rice, sprouted grams, mint 

 chutney, tamarind chutney, onion, tomato and chaat masala)

 Microwave popcorn (low-fat variety, of course)

 Home-made potato chips

 Home-made burgers.

 STAY 

 FIT

 Those not accustomed to prolonged 

 sleep deprivation, watch out for the fatigue factor ? lack 

 of energy and concentration at work, and loss of appetite. 

 Doctors also warn regular smokers not to light up too many 

 in front of the TV. We require at least six hours of sleep, 

 they point out. So skip the matches that do not feature 

 your favourites and ration your energy for the big nights.

 A light and early dinner is recommended, 

 with plenty of water to drink.

 Cardiac patients should be extra 

 careful about going crazy over goals scored ? and missed.

 WATCH 

 IT

 TV sales ? the LCDs and plasmas 

 ? have doubled at most stores around the city. But a projector 

 and home theatre system combo provides the ultimate Cup 

 view. A projector comes for Rs 75,000, with an 8 ft by 6 

 ft screen thrown in. Home-theatre systems start as low as 

 Rs 10,000, but the Rs 30,000 range provides the ultimate 

 stadium atmosphere.

 Strike to hit oil pumps

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fuel supply to pumps will stop from Friday morning, with tanker operators going on an indefinite strike to press for a fare hike. Pump-owners fear an acute fuel shortage if the strike drags beyond two days. 

 Pumps owned by oil firms, however, will not be affected. These are located on the Kasba connector and Shakespeare Sarani, in Garia, Bishnupur, Budge Budge and Dakshineswar.

 Around 5,000 tankers ferrying petrol and diesel from depots to outlets in and around the city will join the strike.

 Our stock will last two days. If the strike continues beyond that, we may have to close the pumps, said Joydeb Sarkar, secretary of Petroleum Dealers Association.

 Representatives of West Bengal Tankers Association met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday and issued an ultimatum. We want the fare of Rs 108 per kl to be raised to Rs 200. We told the minister that unless he convinced the oil firms to revise the fare, we will not ply, said the Tankers Association general secretary Ajit Das.

 The minister urged the tanker operators to withdraw the strike as the festive season is approaching. He promised to talk to the oil firms.

 Oil firms said tanker operators should not have called a strike in the middle of a negotiation process. The north Bengal fare has been raised and talks are on for a hike in south Bengal, said an IOC official.

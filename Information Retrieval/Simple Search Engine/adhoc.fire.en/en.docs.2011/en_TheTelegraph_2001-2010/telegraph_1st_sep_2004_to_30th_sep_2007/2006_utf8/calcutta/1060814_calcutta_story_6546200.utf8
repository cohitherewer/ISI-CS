 Wondering how to spruce up his 

 room? For starters, you can check out the adventurous set 

 of room decors and accessories at Nik Nish.

 Boys love anything that 

 is adventurous and fun. And these have done very well as 

 Rakhi gifts, says manager Harjeet Singh.

 Made of polyresin, the collection 

 captures male and female bikers executing various stunts. 

 John Abraham fans, watch out for a macho man revving up 

 a Dhoom-like bike in electric red that reads Bike 

 Club. And hes dressed to thrill flaming goggles, 

 phoenix belt, silver chains, red bandana, cigar, denims 

 and boots. Whats more, it doubles as a piggy bank. 

 Or go for the all-action hero. 

 Sporting dark shades, a dagger-like neckpiece and zipped-up 

 boots, the biker rides a snazzy orange mountain bike. His 

 left hand is off the handle bar, showing off Hrithik-like 

 muscles.

 Photographs can gain momentum, 

 too. Place them in photo frames that look like tyres. A 

 biker below completes the look. Some frames have a brick-like 

 finish while others go the wood way. Here you find the men 

 relaxing on their bikes, drinking away to glory. One embellished 

 with a rope has an eagle motif on top. Also on offer are 

 CD racks with bikers in chill-out mode.

 If Tomb Raider babe Angelina 

 Jolie is more his kind, then there are lady bikers sure 

 to keep him interested. The women flaunt their hot bods 

 in mini black dresses teamed with stockings and high-heeled 

 boots. Each sports a black shrug, a sailor cap with skull 

 motifs and a heart-shaped tattoo just below the neck.

 From coin holders to decor pieces 

 to photo frames, here too the choice is varied. The pen 

 stands cannot be given a miss either. Male and female bikers 

 seem to spring out from within the stands. 

 Take a look at a set of cool dudes 

 in casual tees and loose trousers. Their face is almost 

 covered with caps. All that is visible is a grin. While 

 one is lost in his own world of music, the other takes pleasure 

 in a skating session.

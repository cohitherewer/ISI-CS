 Glimpses of Abhishek

 Shocking pink and turquoise suede 

 upholstery, a hand sporting a bold Swarovski ring supporting 

 the bolsters or clasping the curtains, a chair with legs 

 resembling the human form and the back shaped like a corset 

 ? glimpses of a flamboyant line of furniture created by 

 fashion designer Abhishek Dutta.

 The designer who debuted at the 

 Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week in April and is gearing 

 up to showcase at the spring-summer edition in Delhi next 

 month, has extended his creativity beyond clothes and is 

 all set to launch a furniture studio at his Ballygunge home.

 I am always into doing things 

 creative, be it my garment collections or decking up my 

 fashion studio with unique furniture and accessories. Many 

 of my customers who visited the studio would appreciate 

 the furniture and request me to do it for them. So I thought 

 of designing furniture professionally, says Abhishek. 

 But he is quick to add: Its not about serious 

 furniture, its about doing fun and funky pieces, home 

 accessories and artefacts.

 Funk being the keyword in the 

 venture, the furniture pieces and accessories draw inspiration 

 from the human form. So, hands, legs and the upper torso 

 are common. My USP is the unusual shapes and materials, 

 says the designer known for the trademark use of leather 

 in his fashion collections.

 From metal, leather, suede, denims 

 and acrylic to wood in different finishes, the materials 

 shaping the furniture are quite unique.

 The hues are metallic ? from golden 

 and silver to pink and blue. Swarovski crystals are used 

 generously, sometimes as knobs and functional fittings and 

 at other times as embellishments.

 The studio, to be unveiled next 

 month, is ready with the first range. On display are a few 

 chairs in unusual shapes and a leather sofa with a pair 

 of hands holding the bolsters from both sides. A glass-topped 

 corner table with the leg resembling a woman waist downwards 

 doubles as a dining table. A metallic gold cabinet is divided 

 into bar counter, book shelf and TV holder.

 The showstealer at the studio, 

 however, is a lounge seating arrangement done up in loud 

 pink and turquoise. A combination of wood and acrylic, with 

 suede upholstery, shapes the divan that can open up to make 

 a queen-size bed when necessary. 

 Bright blue drapes with leather 

 patchwork hang from the four posters, to which is attached 

 a LCD screen.

 This is furniture that would 

 find place in a den or a lounge. It has a very young feel 

 and needs an attitude to be flaunted, explains Abhishek.

 The furniture is priced reasonably: 

 individual chairs range between Rs 3,500 and Rs 10,000; 

 cabinets come for Rs 15,000-plus; the lounge seating area 

 is tagged at Rs 35,000. Cushion covers, mostly foil-printed 

 with leather ruffles, start at Rs 250.

 Abhishek is yet to launch the 

 first line, but the designer has already firmed up plans 

 for the next line of furniture. The next look with 

 be ethnic, while retaining the signature funk. For this, 

 I will fuse wood with copper.

 After launching his own studio, 

 Abhishek is looking at retailing the pieces from lifestyle 

 stores. 

 Ive already tied up 

 with a lifestyle store in Singapore for a promotional show 

 of the furniture. Im trying to tie up with a store 

 in Mumbai to retail the pieces, he reveals.

 Retail apart, Abhishek also plans 

 to offer interior makeovers. I can undertake designing 

 assignments where Ill give a complete makeover to 

 a room within 15 days, in keeping with the clients 

 personality.

 Ghats lit, cages bigger

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The immersion experience on Monday has prompted cops and the civic officials to instal more lights at the ghats and increase the capacity of the enclosures for dumping waste. Wednesday is the final day of the immersions.

 Puja organisers have faced problems in immersing idols due to lack of illumination at some ghats, including Gwalior ghat. At Gwalior, Baje Kadamtala and a few other ghats, the enclosures meant for dumping waste had overflown on Monday.

 The police brass took the decision following a stocktaking meeting on Tuesday. This year, we had illuminated all the ghats well, except at certain points. We have decided to put up more lights to ensure hassle-free immersions, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee.

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said: We have decided to make the enclosures for dumping waste larger.

 The cages were put up at the ghats to prevent pollution of the Hooghly by immersion of flowers, leaves and other garbage along with the idols.

 The bulk of the immersions was completed on Monday and early on Tuesday. The remaining immersions will have to be completed by Wednesday night.

 On Monday, 1,600-plus puja committees in and around the city immersed idols in the river. The figure dropped considerably on Tuesday.

 Sharabi ko sharab chhodne ko keh rahe hain? Ajay Jadeja broke into a dimpled smile as he picked up a bat, took guard and sent the ball soaring over the ropes much to the delight of a motley crowd of wannabe cricketers at the Videocon School of Cricket in Salt Lake on Thursday morning.

 There were 80 youngsters awaiting their turn at the nets for the Cricket Star talent hunt, the first of its kind being conducted in 11 cities by Investors in Cricket, which owns the International Twenty-20 Club Championship. The winner gets to play for Leicestershire for a year.

 There was Sanjay Ramprasad, from an Uttar Pradesh village without electricity, who saw Shoaib Akhtar on a battery-run television and started bowling. Umesh Latwani, a cricket coach from Rewa, in Madhya Pradesh, had enrolled both himself and a couple of his wards. There was a young man who had come to appear for a railway examination in Calcutta and hopped over on hearing of the trial, a 30-year-old army jawan, and even a 16-year-old girl from the city.

 They had all been shortlisted over the past couple of days by ex-cricketers Robin Singh and Rajesh Chauhan. The job at hand was to pick 11 as the zonal finalists who would travel to Mumbai and fight it out to be the cricket star. About 500 aspirants had padded up to be the next cricket hope from Bengal alongside those who had travelled from afar to take a shot at sporting fame.

 The contest, Jadeja insisted, was for the masses who dream of playing for the country. Cricket used to be a rich mans game. Now they all come from lower middle-class backgrounds. Only Sourav (Ganguly) is an exception!

 The in-camera action was steered by a crew from Miditech (of Indian Idol fame). This show is for the cricket-crazy commoner, said creative director Indrajit Ray.

 The final Twenty-20 matches will be beamed on Doordarshan and Zee Sports. By then, Sourav should be taking up a mentors seat, alongside Kapil Dev, to train the chosen 44 players. What if Dada gets chosen for One-Day duty against West Indies? The show may suffer but we all want him to be in the team, said Jadeja with a straight bat.

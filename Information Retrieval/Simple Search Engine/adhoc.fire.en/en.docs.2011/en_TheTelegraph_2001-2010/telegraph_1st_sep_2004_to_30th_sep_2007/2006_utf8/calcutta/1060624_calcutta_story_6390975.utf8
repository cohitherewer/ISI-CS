The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 LRT treads a timeline tightrope

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The state government has succeeded in getting its desired funding agency, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, to agree to pump in money for the chief minister?s dream transport project, Light Rail Transit (LRT).

 But going by the bank?s conditions, money is not likely to arrive before 2008. 

 This has prompted the transport department to scout for alternative sources of funds for the Rs 2,400-crore project, in which the state?s investment will be around Rs 480 crore. ?We are exploring alternative sources of funds,? confirmed transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 Some sections in the government feel that if work starts in 2008, the next Assembly polls will be over by the time the project rolls out.

 The transport department now wants to implement the project with a private company on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. Four companies have already been shortlisted.

 ?They are ready to start work either through a joint venture or on a BOT basis. They will give a presentation on June 27, after which we will choose one,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said.

 A team from the Japan bank, led by country director Mutsuya Mori, has agreed to fund the project after a spot-assessment it conducted over the past five days. ?The bank has asked for a detailed project report and environment impact assessment report prepared by a reputed consultant. The process of granting funds will start after it receives the reports,? Chowdhury said.

 Officials said the bank would need at least four to five months to process the proposal. For the funds to be made available in fiscal 2006-07, the two reports need to be submitted by October. If the government misses the deadline, the funds will be delayed till 2008.

 ?It is not possible to prepare the project report in four months. We need a month to invite tenders for selecting an agency, which will take at least six months to prepare the report. If work starts today, the report will be ready only by January 2007,? said an official.

 The green report, though, will be ready by October.

 ?How will we prepare the project report in three-four months? The bank should have told us earlier to have it ready,? the transport minister said.

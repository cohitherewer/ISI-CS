 - Plexes nearly sold out for Shah Rukh, Bachchan film DVDs fly off racks

 DIWALI BLAST: Shah Rukh Khan and Ishaa Koppikar in a scene from the new Don

 Hes on the television screen, the cellphone screen, the computer screen, and soon hell be on a big screen near you.

 In Donspeak, its not only mushkil (difficult) but namumkin (impossible) to ignore the remake hitting theatres on Diwali Friday. If Don 1978 was dubbed a flop in its first week before Khaike paan Banaraswala turned things around, Don 2006 has left nothing to chance. The advances for the festive weekend with seven shows a day at each multiplex have been huge.

 There is another new release in Jaan-e-Mann with big names like Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, but it is no match for the Don hysteria, says Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum). 

 The Elgin Road plex opened counters on Tuesday evening and by Wednesday evening, 60 per cent of tickets were sold out and nine block bookings registered. Bypass bookings have been similar, with both 89 Cinemas and Fame (Hiland Park) assured of a big opening.

 This is as much a time for fast forward as it is for rewind. If the Shah Rukh Khan army is gearing up to make a Diwali weekend dhamaka, Amitabh Bachchan fans are retuning to the original Don.

 After a spate of reruns on the small screen and a sudden spurt of rentals at video libraries, new DVDs of the Chandra Barot film simply saying Amitabh Bachchan as Don have been flying fast. Says Sidharth Pansari from Crossword: Eagle has come out with a fresh package of the DVD and it is selling like crazy.

 Shah Rukhs latest biography Still Reading Khan has taken a flying start, too, and its no coincidence that theres a separate chapter on Don.

 The Shah Rukh Khan Fans Club will ensure that the new Don gets a grand reception. More than 150 members of the countrys only official SRK club will walk from the club premises off College Street to Star theatre for a special screening on Friday.

 Says fan club secretary Arnab Roy: We will all dress up like Shah Rukh in the movie black jackets and shades. Then, in front of Star theatre, we will smash coconuts, play with abir and have a huge celebration. We are not here to compare Shah Rukh with Amitabh, but to make the release special.

 Don also marks the return of standalone theatres hosting paid previews. Priya will hold a special show on Thursday night. Says Arijit Dutta, owner of the south Calcutta single screen: Paid previews have only been happening at the plexes but with Don, its back at Priya. The response has been tremendous with almost all tickets sold out.

 Talking of tickets, the ones at the plexes are tagged between Rs 200 and Rs 250, while those at standalone theatres are between Rs 80 and Rs 150.

 The drama unfolds in South Carolina in 1776. Benjamin Martin, a French-Indian war hero who is haunted by his past, is a patriot who wants no part in a war with Britain. Meanwhile, his two eldest sons, Gabriel and Thomas, can?t wait to go out and kill some Redcoats. When South Carolina decides to go to war with Britain, Gabriel immediately signs up to fight. But soon, Colonel Tavington, British solder infamous for his brutal tactics, captures Gabriel and sentences him to be hanged. As Gabriel is taken away, Thomas tries to free him, only to be killed by Tavington, in front of Benjamin.

 Seeking revenge for his son?s death, Benjamin leaves behind his other children to bring independence to the 13 colonies.

 A question-answer session on Quality Human Resource amp; The Indian Knowledge Base on Saturday concluded the three-day Knowledge Conclave ? Kolkata Convergence, at Science City. The event was attended by students from different schools, each having contributed a project on various themes.

 The afternoon session was attended by schoolchildren who asked the panel questions that covered a broad range of topics, from cultural diversity to the lack of modern-day job security. The panel comprised five people, including Prof Ashok Chatterjee, distinguished fellow of National Institute of Design (NID) in Ahmedabad. ?This is a good expedition for both teachers and children. You can never overdo dialogue and social commentary of this kind,? Chatterjee said.

 Sister Cyril, principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, who participated in the morning session entitled Road Map to Creative Use of the Rs 6,000-crore Education Cess Fund, was enthusiastic about ?the way the programme encouraged children to think creatively, and I?m particularly impressed with the village schools... this is a new challenge for them?.

 While the adult participants felt that dialogue of this sort was a useful exercise, some felt that there were ways to improve such an event. Sister Cyril said she was ?disappointed that not more industrialists had turned up at the meeting. It would have been better if there were more people here to listen.?

 Prof Vinod Raina, a theoretical physicist and founder of the education organisation Eklavya, agreed: ?It?s good to see children from all schools here, I have been very surprised by the degree of awareness in the sessions. It?s a shame that there aren?t more planners and bureaucrats here to listen to what the children have to say.?

 After youngsters? questions were answered to their satisfaction, Ashok Chatterjee concluded with an anecdote: ?When I was in Karachi, some children not much older than you voted Calcutta as being one city in India that they would like to live in. They said they liked the ?tolerant atmosphere? in this city. You must keep it this way in the future.? 

 While the overall event, organised by New Display Services, in association with Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, drew praise, the common complaint was that the education and value systems in the country must change to encourage more creativity and innovation amongst the youth. ?More interactions in class, philosophy as a subject, small but intensive syllabus rather than large and extensive ? these are some changes we need,? suggested Prof Sisir Sen, former dean at IIT Kharagpur and senior scientist at Jadavpur University.

 As P.M. Bhargava, vice-chairman of the National Knowledge Commission, put it: ?Most Indians today know the names of third-rate actors and actresses, but have no idea who unravelled the structure of the DNA. The fault lies with bad teachers and a bad value system that places a premium on money.?

 Contemporary life, particularly in urban locales, is a chaotic muddle of heightened activity, interspersed with rare moments of quietude. Capturing the pulse of modern civilisation, which offers a strangely skewed mixture of the old and the new, Sketches From Overseas, the ongoing exhibition of digital photographs by world-renowned photographer Toshiki Ozawa of Japan, provides viewers with a taste of life as lived in a cosmopolitan environment. Featuring 40 exhibits, the exhibition brings to focus the sharp dichotomy of class, culture and habits that exists among the modern urban milieu. Awe-inspiring photographs of massive architectural marvels are offset by images of lush, green parks and gardens bathed in sunshine and glowing with the richness of natural vegetation. At the same time, social and moral decay and decadence is symbolised in snapshots of dilapidated warehouses and auction-houses, where relics of bygone days lie forlorn, uncared for and unattended. Monumental structures of churches and towers add dignity, charm and grandeur to the imposing cityscape. Hosted by Photographic Association of Bengal.

 Event: An exhibition of contemporary digital photographs by Toshiki Ozawa 

When: Till today, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

 Freedom of passion

 From the boardroom to the bedroom, womanpower is on a roll. And now, theres more good news for the woman on top. In a populous country plagued by non-usage of contraceptives (the figure is as high as 52 per cent), a woman-initiated barrier method for contraception was unveiled in the city on Friday afternoon. Following its debut in Bangalore this May, Hindustan Latex Ltd launched Confidom Passion Rings, a contraceptive for women, in the eastern region. 

 After two years of research and test marketing, the company has introduced a revolutionary product, targeting the Section A+ women in the age bracket of 18 to 35 years.

 The target consumer of Confidom is the upwardly mobile, educated and sophisticated woman of today who likes to be in control at all times and places. Dual-income families are also being marked as target buyers of the novel product.

 The 17-cm-long tube with an inner as well as outer ring is made of polyurethane and is twice as strong as latex, thus reducing risk of breakage. Besides providing protection against unwanted pregnancies, the condom is an effective shield against sexually transmitted infections.

 There is no risk of any allergic reaction, the pack assures. Dubbed more an experience than just a functional product, Confidom stands for freedom and confidence in todays woman and the liberating effect of a female condom. 

 M. Ayyappan, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Latex, concedes that it is a marketing challenge for the brand. The outlay for the promotional campaigns through print and its website (www.confidom.com) is Rs 2.5 crore. 

 We have decided on an optimum price of Rs 250 for a pack of two after extensive studies with our target consumers, he adds.

 In the first two phases, Hindustan Latex, with sales and distribution rights of Confidom, is importing in bulk from Chicago-based The Female Health Company, sole manufacturer of these condoms worldwide. Subsequently, the packaging will be done at the companys Cochin address and then Confidom will be manufactured in India. The sales target is 500,000 pieces in year one.

 Confidom will be available over the counter at all major medicine shops in town.

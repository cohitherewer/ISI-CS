 ?Can you kiss underwater?? 

Screen On amp; Off

A mouthful of water was just one of the perils of taking 

the plunge into Gangster territory, 19-year-old Manali girl KANGANA tells Pratim 

D. Gupta

 Kangana with co-star Emraan Hashmi in Gangster

When Anurag Basu came to Calcutta to buy the copyright 

of Goutam Chattopadhyay?s Prithibi for his new film Gangster, he 

was also looking around for his leading lady. In fact, he met and screen-tested 

a whole lot of young actresses from Tollywood in the quest for a fresh face. At 

that time, everyone from Shoaib Akhtar to Sanjay Dutt was in the running to play 

the male lead in the movie, loosely based on the life of underworld don Abu Salem.

Finally, Anurag?s quest led to Kangana, a demure yet 

dazzling beauty from Manali, who was just waiting to be discovered. ?After doing 

my schooling in Chandigarh and Shimla, I moved to Delhi to do some theatre. After 

working in a couple of plays for five to six months, I was signed by the Elite 

modelling agency in Paris. Thereafter, I did a lot of modelling and on one of 

my assignments in Mumbai, I got to meet Anurag Basu. He approached me and after 

two rounds of screen-tests, I was doing Gangster.?

But Kangana admits that she would have preferred to 

go slower before jumping on to the Bollywood bandwagon. ?It was all very unexpected 

and I couldn?t prepare myself at all for the big screen,? she says. ?I was, of 

course, interested in acting but I had thought it would take a long time for me 

to bag a movie role. I had just completed 19 years and although theatre and movie 

acting are one and the same thing, I wasn?t ready for it to happen so soon. Anyway, 

I had to jump in at some point of time.?

 Thanks to her director, Kangana wasn?t required to 

be an acting pro. ?Anurag just told me, ?You don?t have to learn anything, just 

come blank on the sets and leave everything to me?,? she reveals. ?And that?s 

what I did and things became very easy. It turned out to be a great learning experience 

as I started to convey exactly what my director wanted.?

Gangster is nothing short of a dream debut 

for Kangana, what with the Bhatt camp having made stars out of everyone from Bipasha 

Basu to Udita Goswami. What?s more, the film revolves around her with the two 

men ? Shiney Ahuja and Emraan Hashmi ? battling it out for her attention.

?I play a very normal girl who has nothing to do with 

the world of crime,? Kangana offers. ?Then this man (Shiney) falls in love with 

her and then it becomes a triangle when another guy (Emraan) comes into her life. 

So, Gangster is basically a journey of this girl and her one dream of starting 

a family.?

But isn?t her character inspired from Monica Bedi 

and how she got involved with Abu Salem? ?I don?t think there is any similarity 

between the two,? Kangana denies vehemently. ?I play a bar dancer in Gangster, 

not an actress. Also, I don?t know anything about Abu Salem or his affair with 

Monica Bedi. There must be some connection. You will have to watch the film to 

decide.?

Shooting for the movie wasn?t that easy, though. ?We 

were in Seoul and it was freezing there,? Kangana reveals. ?And I had to wear 

chiffons and georgettes in that zero degree temperature. So, while mentally it 

was difficult, since I was facing the camera for the first time, it was physically 

tough too. Then, no one can speak English there. In the restaurants they would 

serve dogs and beef. So we would have to explain in sign language that we wanted 

fish or lamb.?

But is there anything more important than ?the kiss? 

when you romance Emraan Hashmi on screen and that too underwater? ?How can you 

kiss underwater?? demands an exasperated Kangana. ?There was so much of water 

inside the mouth. It wasn?t a smooch at all. Gangster is a very clean film, 

very different from what the Bhatts make, and it will change Emraan?s image completely. 

It was, in fact, Emraan, whom Kangana found to be 

more of a gentleman on the sets than Shiney, who was full of pranks. ?Their media 

images are so different from their real personalities,? she laughs. ?They are 

really poles apart.?

Now that she has taken the plunge, Kangana wants more. 

?I have got addicted,? she admits. ?I am also doing another Bhatt film, Woh 

Lamhey, based on the life of Parveen Babi, to be directed by Mohit Suri and 

co-starring Shiney and a new guy called Shaad. Even as I am dubbing for Gangster, 

I am reading the script and getting ready for my second round in Bollywood.?

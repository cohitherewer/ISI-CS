Femme fatale: Nina Manuel and Joey Matthew. 

A great model is all about great attitude. I think Nina is a perfect model because 

she is the straightest of the lot? No natak or nakhra, she walks 

the walk just as it is. Joey is also an equally good model. 

 Hot bod: Nina Manuel. A model looks good when shes well toned. She looks lean but never too muscular. Nina has a perfect body, curvy in all the right places.

 Pretty woman: Michelle Innes, Fleur Xavier and Indrani Dasgupta. All the three faces are so beautiful. And the best part is that they look equally good in both ethnic as well as Western outfits.

 Watch out for: Deepika Padukone and Neha Kapur. Deepika is already doing extremely well for herself. Neha has amazing attitude. She has absolutely no inhibitions, not in terms of clothes but in terms of what shes doing. At the same time, Neha takes criticism well and thats a fantastic signal.

 Model actor: Arjun Rampal. I feel he is so good-looking that any movie he does is worth watching. I dont know much about his acting capabilities but yes, as far as looks go, hes the best model-turned-actor we have today.

 Model actress: Priyanka Chopra. What I like best about her is that she fits the bill perfectly each time. When she was a model, she looked super; now that shes an actress, she manages to look like a filmstar.

 Wrong number (F): Yukta Mookhey. With her height, she should have just stuck to modelling instead of trying films.

 Wrong number (M): Shahwar Ali and Zulfi Syed. God knows why these men switched to films. As models, they are great. As actors? Well, no comments!

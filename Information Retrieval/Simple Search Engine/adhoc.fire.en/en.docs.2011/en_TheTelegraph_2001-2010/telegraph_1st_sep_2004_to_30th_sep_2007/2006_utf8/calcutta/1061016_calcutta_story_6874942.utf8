 Rains ready to retreat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The monsoon is expected to retreat from the city and its surrounding areas within the next three days.

 The rains have already left the western parts of Bengal and parts of north Bengal. It will bid adieu to the city in another two to three days, said deputy director-general of Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore J.V.M. Naidu.

 He added that isolated showers were expected in Calcutta and its adjoining areas over the next few days under the influence of an upper-air cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) that formed over Bangladesh and Gangetic Bengal a few days ago. It has weakened and is expected to dissipate in a couple of days. Naidu ruled out the possibility of heavy rain.

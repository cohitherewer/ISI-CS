 Incidents of violence against women are on the rise in India, with one act of sexual harassment being reported every 12 minutes, one rape every 28 minutes and one dowry death every 67 minutes. And these are just the tip of the iceberg, as most cases go unreported.

 In a situation such as this, we feel its time to actively involve men in the struggle to stop violence against women, said Anuradha Kapoor, director, Swayam, a non-profit womens organisation committed to ending violence against women and children.

 Swayam is organising a campaign in Calcutta to stop violence against women, in association with DRIK India, an alternative media organisation, and International Association of Women in Radio and Television, an international forum for personal contact and professional development among women broadcasters.

 The campaign is part of an international initiative originating from the first Womens Global Leadership Institute, sponsored by the Centre for Womens Global Leadership in 1991. It kicked off on November 25 with a mass awareness programme, including an exhibition of posters and performances by the theatre and music groups of Swayam.

 The campaign ends on December 10, marking International Human Rights Day. This period has a special significance. It coincides with the International Day against Violence against Women, World AIDS Day and World Disability Day, said Kapoor. 

 Swayams campaign will feature workshops by artists and rights activists, photography exhibitions, panel discussions and film shows.

 We have organised the venues in a way so as to reach out to a large section of the population, said Kapoor. 

 Film-maker Goutam Ghosh, writer-activist Maitreyi Chatterjee, actor Rahul Bose, and a host of academicians and journalists will speak on issues like violence against women and the need to involve men in the attempt to eradicate the menace.

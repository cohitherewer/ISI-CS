The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rains in, full force in 48 hrs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta and its adjoining areas are likely to feel the full impact of the monsoon after another 48 hours. 

 The monsoon made its way into Gangetic West Bengal on Tuesday morning. 

 A low-pressure area over Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand and north Orissa on Tuesday dragged the monsoon into south Bengal, explained a meteorological official. The monsoon is now moving north-west. 

 ?There might be drizzles and light rain in Calcutta and its adjoining districts in the next 48 hours, but there is little chance of heavy or very heavy rain,? said G.C. Basu, director of the weather section at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore, on Wednesday.

 Because of the movement of the low pressure, hovering about six km above sea level outside Calcutta, the city received very little rain ? 1.1 mm in Alipore and 3 mm in Dum Dum ? on Tuesday. 

 With the wind from Bay of Bengal bringing a lot of moisture into the city, the sky is expected to remain cloudy. The maximum temperature will hover between 30 and 33 degrees Celsius, predicted the meteorological official.

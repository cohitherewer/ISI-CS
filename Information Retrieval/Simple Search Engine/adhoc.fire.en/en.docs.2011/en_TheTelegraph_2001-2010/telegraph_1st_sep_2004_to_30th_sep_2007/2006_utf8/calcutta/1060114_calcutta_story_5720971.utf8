Our culture, their craft

 A moment from Harvest. Picture by Weiferd Watts

 A Fulbright Fellowship took me on a salubrious sabbatical last semester to Indiana University, researching contemporary American theatre and music. Also teaching in the US again after a gap of nearly 20 years, I was immediately struck by the much greater visibility of South Asian faces in the student community. Bemused, I overheard Mumbai English on the buses, but obviously encountered a far higher frequency of American accents among the ?Indian? population, emanating from mainly second-generation Indian Americans. To my biggest surprise, half the undergraduates in my class on Indian performance came from the latter background, and a few more descended from Indian families in Hong Kong and Malaysia. Only then did I understand how much these youth of Indian origin (YIO) want to learn about ?their? arts and culture ? something not taught to them commonly.

 The number of YIO on American campuses has made it possible for directors to conceive of staging Indian drama with an ethnically accurate cast, rather than the earlier practice of casting colour-blind because most actors belonged to the white majority. I saw direct evidence of this on a Fulbright trip to lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, in November. 

 My host, former Xaverian and Jadavpurian Sudipto Chatterjee, still a part-time Calcuttan but full-time on the faculty of the Department of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies, timed my visit to coincide with his production of Manjula Padmanabhan?s celebrated play Harvest. He had selected its Indian dramatis personae from the large pool of YIO at Berkeley ? though not in the theatre department, they had all answered his audition call.

 Harvest was publicised as the first Indian play staged in Berkeley since the performance of a Sanskrit classic in 1914. It won the Onassis Award for International Understanding, a prestigious scriptwriting contest, in 1997. Like all of Padmanabhan?s work, it has a gripping as well as grotesque quality, firmly rooted in social reality. Using the infamous kidney donor trade to take off, she set it in a Mumbai chawl of the future, where a resident assigns his body parts for a fortune to an American through a US-based organ-buying firm named Inter Planta. In the event that the recipient needs any organ, they will farm it from his body. To ensure that he lives in good health during the interim, they place him and his family under a dietary regimen, 24-hour surveillance and a video link to his American beneficiary who talks to him periodically.

 Unfortunately, the author (invited to attend the premiere) objected to Chatterjee?s treatment, and the controversy snowballed in the media. It recalled the old debate about what is the ultimate artwork, the dramatist?s text or the director?s interpretation, generally resolved by now in favour of the latter, though evidently not in Padmanabhan?s mind.

 Chatterjee?s production did have some blemishes ? it ran too long, and not all the student actors had the experience or maturity required for their roles, over-emoting or dropping their Indian accents at times ? but on the whole he did a service by exposing American audiences to Padmanabhan?s imaginative, warning vision. It will be a pity if she continues to be so prescriptive to Indian directors, for Indians too deserve to get the chance to see her play interpreted by various hands. 

 If a Calcutta son lit up theatre in his own way on the West Coast, a Calcutta daughter did likewise on the East. Metro regulars have read of Mahira Kakkar?s student acting career in New York, but as a professional now she accomplished a major milestone by featuring in Christopher Durang?s Miss Witherspoon, which just completed its month-long run off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons. 

 This is no mean achievement on two counts: Durang is a leading American dramatist and wrote this part especially for Kakkar, described by the New York Times as ?Miss Witherspoon?s sari-clad mentor Maryamma? who delivers most of the ?charmingly off-centre details? in the script. 

 Secondly, Playwrights Horizons is a highly respected company, associated with new playwriting by Durang, A.R. Gurney and others since 1971. Three of its plays have won Pulitzer Prizes: Stephen Sondheim?s Sunday in the Park with George, Alfred Uhry?s Driving Miss Daisy and Wendy Wasserstein?s The Heidi Chronicles. To be part of such company should give Kakkar much reason to be proud, indeed.

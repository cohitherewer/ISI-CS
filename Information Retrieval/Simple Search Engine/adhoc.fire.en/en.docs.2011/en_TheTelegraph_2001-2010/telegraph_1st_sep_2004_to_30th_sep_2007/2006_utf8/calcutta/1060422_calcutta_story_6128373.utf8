 Car crushes three to death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three contract labourers were killed on the spot and another is battling for his life after being mowed down by a speeding Indica car on CIT Road, in north Calcutta, late on Thursday. 

 According to the police, the accident took place around 1.30 am when a group of contract labourers ? employed by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation ? were laying bitumen on a stretch of CIT Road near VIP Market. The driver crushed four of the labourers before hitting a lamp post. A mob later set the vehicle on fire. 

 The victims were identified as Saja Mal, 25, W. Sheikh, 24, and Md. Nasim, 25, all residents of South 24-Parganas. The condition of Md Ashraf, 19, a resident of Kasba, is critical at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital. The driver, Kuldip Singh was arrested. 

 ?It was a clear case of rash driving and Singh was charged under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder),? said deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Vineet Goyal.

 Owner of the vehicle Toni Singh said: ?Kuldip is a friend. He was on his way home after dropping off a friend at the airport.?

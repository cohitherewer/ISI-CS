 - A LARGE CHUNK OF RAJASTHAN

 Popular Rajasthani dancer Gulabo in performance. She will be in Calcutta later this month for a solo performance at an awards function

 Her twirl to the wail of the been and the beat of the duff has won accolades across the globe. And now Gulabo, who has popularised the Rajasthani Kalbeliya dance worldwide, is set for her maiden performance in Calcutta. 

 Come September 20, the Rajasthani folk dancer will perform her famous Sapera and Chari dance forms to a select city audience. 

 The occasion: an awards function organised by the city chapter of Rajasthan Foundation, an umbrella organisation of around 3,000 social, cultural, religious and educational outfits. 

 Gulabo has given tourism in Rajasthan a big boost. Now, we are bringing her to Calcutta to showcase Rajasthani folk dance for people in this part of the country, said Sundeep Bhutoria, secretary of the body. 

 Apart from song and dance, the other attraction of the evening will be an awards ceremony. The foundation will honour some city-based Rajasthanis for their contributions in the fields of art and culture, health and education and social service. Governors of various states, with roots in Rajasthan, will attend the function. 

 A panel of eminent Rajasthanis including social workers Prabha Khaitan and Madhu Neotia and industrialists like R.S. Goenka and Sanjay Budhia has selected this years winners Shyamanand Jalan, Sharda Fatehpuria and Pushkar Lal Kedia. 

 By honouring these people, we wish to set an example for more people to come forward to serve humanity, said H.M. Bangur, president, Rajasthan Foundation. 

 The autonomous body, which operates under the aegis of the Rajasthan government, was set up to give non-resident Rajasthanis a platform to contribute to the progress of their home state. Besides, the foundation also promotes the state and acts as a bridge between Rajasthan and the rest of the world. 

 We had observed Rajasthan Diwas with great fanfare in Calcutta in March and created a mini Rajasthan here. Now, by bringing Gulabo to Calcutta for a solo performance, we want to show the cultural diversity of our state, summed up Bhutoria.

 Abstract explorations

 Bringing together the works of four artists with distinctive, independent styles, Abstract 06 offers an aesthetic exploration of the complex, often contradictory, world inhabited by our subliminal selves. In Biswajit Mukherjees paintings (one of them appears left), structures become fragmented into geometrical shapes, maintaining a constant rhythm in spite of their irregularity. Paint takes on a life of its own in the works of Partha Roy Tom. Characterised by fluid, luminous use of colours, his canvases give the unique impression of being painted on the wall; their graffiti-like effect enhanced by text splashed boldly over layers of colour. Raju Sutars works are more sombre in tone, opaque colours creating intriguing forms even out of partial transparency. A collage-like quality is evident in Mallika Dass paintings, with her subject often being inscribed within a clearly-discernible frame. Almost minimal in her use of colours, inanimate objects appear to take on the form of the animate in nearly all her works.

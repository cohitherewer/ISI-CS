 JU tops in funds task

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jadavpur University (JU) has ranked first among seven state institutes in implementing projects under the World Bank-sponsored Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (Tequip).

 The universitys engineering faculty has scored 622.5 out of 950. Calcutta University stands second with a tally of 617, followed by Institute of Engineering and Management, a private college in Salt Lake, which has notched up 580.

 Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), Shibpur, awaiting the Institute of National Importance status to be bestowed by the Centre, stands fourth with a score of 576.3.

 The assessment was carried out by a state-level unit set up by the Centre to facilitate implementation of Tequip projects.

 Certain parameters were put in place by the Centre to evaluate the progress of projects undertaken with World Bank funds by the seven beneficiary institutions. Jadavpur University has scored the highest marks, confirmed a senior official in the education department.

 Around a dozen factors were taken into account to grade the performance of the institutes. They include the amount of funds spent on networking and community development work. 

 Academic and financial autonomy, staff development plans, faculty status, courses opened and academic reforms are some of the other criteria.

 Also considered were the marks awarded to the institutes during periodic academic audits by state and national-level appraisal units over the past two years.

 A total of Rs 153 crore had been earmarked for the seven institutes under Tequip. 

 JU and Besu have been given Rs 24 crore each, while Rs 30 crore has been allotted for Calcutta University. The remaining five institutes have got between Rs 8 crore and Rs 10 crore.

 Bengal was brought within Tequip in the second cycle in 1998. It was the last among the 13 states selected in the second cycle, thanks to the delay by the ruling CPM in examining the programme conditions. As a result, projects here started two years ago, long after they were initiated in other states.

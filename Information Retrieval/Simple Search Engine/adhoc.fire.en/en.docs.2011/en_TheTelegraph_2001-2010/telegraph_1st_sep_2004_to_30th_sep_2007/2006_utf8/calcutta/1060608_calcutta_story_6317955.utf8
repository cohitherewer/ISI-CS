Life

 Get set

 A cut gone wrong or a colour misfired, 

 tress troubles can crop up in many forms. Shradha Agarwal 

 suggests quick-fix solutions

 Sitting still, peering into the 

 mirror, you imagine your new hairstyle. Your hairstylist 

 begins imagining too: but sadly, its not really the 

 mirror image of your own vision. Something you only discover 

 many snips later? 

 A haircut gone wrong, a fringe 

 cut too short, a colour job that doesnt suit you or 

 a disastrous rebonding attempt. Deal with it right, or better 

 still, avoid such bloopers. GoodLife tells you how. 

 Shade code

 Whether you streak a few strands 

 or colour your tresses entirely, a shade that looked perfect 

 on Preity Zinta isnt necessarily right for you. But 

 the great news, says hair expert Priscilla Corner, is that 

 any colourist can rectify a job. The problem arises when 

 the hair doesnt take colour because of previous pigments. 

 The hairdresser and client relationship is like that 

 of a doctor and a patient. It is important to be honest 

 about previous treatments and henna, says Priscilla. 

 Fix it: Experts say that 

 a wrong choice of colour can be corrected right at the wash 

 basin. You have to deposit the colour of your choice 

 and tone your hair, says Priscilla. 

 While coloured hair will require 

 you to first strip the colour and then deposit, virgin hair 

 can be toned by immediate deposit. The time taken for correction, 

 she adds, is anything between eight and 20 minutes. 

 Hair expert Bridgette Jones suggests 

 the fun use of wigs or switches that are becoming popular. 

 The half scalp wigs are 

 awesome. Imagine getting compliments as your real hair is 

 recovering from damage, she laughs. 

 Avoid it: Be specific about 

 your chosen shade and discuss the matter with your stylist. 

 Ask for a strand test. 

 Bond basics 

 Bonding is not purely cosmetic 

 and should be handled with extra care, consultancy being 

 a major element. If you still land up with a mop of frizzy 

 hair, something has gone amiss. It could go messy 

 if the neutraliser or straightening lotion is kept on for 

 too long. The time recommendation is important to avoid 

 a disaster, says Priscilla. 

 Fix it: Do not parlour-hop. 

 Sort it out at the salon that spoilt your hair. It will 

 also be easier for them because they are familiar with your 

 hair history. Tresses gone frizzy need extra nourishment 

 and care. The client should be given several sessions 

 of hair spas to deep-condition the hair and bring it back 

 to shape. The hair then should be left alone. Never make 

 the mistake to rebond the hair immediately again, 

 adds Priscilla. 

 Bridgette recommends regular snipping 

 to make the hair healthier. The hair must be trimmed 

 every three weeks. The ends look more stressed out after 

 such treatment, she says. Using serum can also help. 

 Avoid it: Being truthful 

 about previous bonding history is important. Also, dont 

 insist on a treatment that your stylist discourages. She 

 is dissuading you as your hair is not in the condition to 

 take in chemicals. 

 Fringe fixer

 The fringe has never been so haute 

 before. Not since the 60s, when Sadhna sported it. But not 

 everyone can carry the short super sexy Sharon Stone fringe. 

 Cut that short, and your only option is to watch it grow 

 back patiently. 

 But hair expert Raman Bharadwaj 

 says that a fringe can easily be corrected, depending on 

 how it was cut. There is ample scope to play around 

 with an asymmetric fringe. Even the bob or the box 

 fringe can be rectified, he says. 

 Fix it: If your fringe 

 is cut too short, experts say that it is best to blend it 

 with the rest of your hair. In cases like this, it 

 is best to flip the fringe and dab some styling product 

 to it, merging it with the rest of the hair. Basically, 

 funkify it, suggests Priscilla. 

 Raman feels that a fringe can 

 be reworked effectively. Try to change the flip and 

 style it asymmetrically. Bridgette suggests you wear 

 cool hair bands or clips as your fringe grows out. Let 

 a few strands lie casually on your forehead, she adds. 

 Avoid it: Be categorical. 

 If you dont want the fringe to go above your eyebrow, 

 tell your stylist before he starts snipping, not after. 

 Cut correct

 A great cut falls amazingly 

 but when its not right, you have a bad hair day everyday, 

 says Bridgette. 

 Raman says: There are two 

 situations, either the client is not happy with the result, 

 or the cut has gone haywire. Talk it out. If shes 

 unhappy, give her a change with some layers, length or work 

 on the front. 

 If the haircut is the stylists 

 fault, he advises immediate apology. 

 Fix it: If your hair is 

 not falling well or if one side is too long or too short, 

 Bridgette suggests taking a good look at the haircut again 

 and redoing it. Balance the cut where it can sit better. 

 Make sure that it is not looking too harsh, close in the 

 gap by blending it well, she says. 

 Experts agree that tackling longer 

 hair is easier and shorter hair is a greater problem. 

 Avoid it: Ask for a visual 

 demonstration to get the right picture.

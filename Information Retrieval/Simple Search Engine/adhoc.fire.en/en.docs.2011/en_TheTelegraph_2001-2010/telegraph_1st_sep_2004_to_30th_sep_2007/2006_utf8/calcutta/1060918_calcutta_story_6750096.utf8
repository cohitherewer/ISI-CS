 Culture call for school teachers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barisha High School, in Behala, was the venue for the states first-ever workshop on culture education for teachers that ended on Saturday.

 A total of 41 schools sent a teacher each for the programme, which was sponsored by Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT), an autonomous organisation under the aegis of the Union ministry of culture. 

 Principal of Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, Swami Suparnananda inaugurated the workshop on Thursday. He said at the launch: We have to combine our desires with love, compassion and sacrifice to achieve culture in its true ideal.

 Headmaster of Barisha High School Kali Pada Jana stated: Among the teachers who attended the workshop, some who are truly interested in promoting our rich cultural heritage can be recommended for attending the CCRT orientation courses to be held in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Udaipur and other places. 

 The primary aim of the training is to familiarise teachers with procedures to acquaint students with the cultural legacy of India, he added. 

 According to the headmaster, the programme highlighted the need for aesthetics, cultural and value-oriented education to make the young generation aware of its roots. The training provided teachers with the opportunity to acquire skills in traditional arts and crafts so that the knowledge could be used to discover the creative potential of students. 

 Sandip Kumar Mondal, one of the participants at the workshop, observed that culture and education are the flip sides of a coin. One cannot work in absence of the other. They are inseparable and demand equal attention for proper development of a student. Cultural progress should be handed down from generation to generation. It goes without saying that to sustain culture, education should be a part of the curriculum.

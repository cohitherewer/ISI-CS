 Tech take for tiny tykes

Chocolates, Barbies, hair accessories, soft toys?You 

can please and pamper your little girl with an endless list of goodies, but making 

your tiny tyke smile can prove to be quite difficult a task.

 Much as you may like to surprise him with something really kewl, the limited choice leaves you with no other option but to choose from a cricket bat/ball, tennis racquet, toy cars and, more recently, Beyblades.

 Wondering what could be the boy thing that you could bowl the little man over with? Hi-tech gadgets from American toy brand Spygear could well be your pick. 

 Priced from Rs 399 to Rs 1,399, there is something to suit every pocket.

 From six year-olds to 20-year-olds, they are a craze with the technology-crazy current generation, smiles Deepa Seth from Queen Of Hearts in City Centre that stocks the stuff.

 Modelled on the lines of super-hot gadgets in James Bond flicks, their look is sleek and smart. Goggles, wallets, watches and playthings ? it all comes in shades of dark steel, with a touch of black adding to the masculine appeal. 

 The Spy Camera kit comes with a trendy pair of shades, the terminals having provisions for holding a real camera. Its pure adventure time with the Spy Vision Goggles that allows you to peer 25 ft into the dark distance. 

 The XP-6 Spy Watch features an alarm, stopwatch, world time, a magnifying lens and a pop-up telescope. Additional features include a capsule-like medicine storage facility.

 In the Wallet Kit there is a leather wallet, a recorder, a coin holder and flashlight.

 With boys armed with all this and more, Spiderman and Superman have competition from Spyman!

 The Spy Tool Kit that comes in a briefcase holds a telescope, a pen and a secret diary. All it takes to hide secrets from prying moms is to pen them down on the secret diary where writings are visible only when a strong light is flashed on them.

 Posters on the doors like Its my room, enter at your risk, are things of the past. Get them the Micro Spy Kit that includes a motion detector for the door. Once activated, it rings the alarm whenever anyone enters the room.

 And if this is not warning enough, the voice scrambler that changes your voice beyond recognition is sure to keep trespassers at bay.

 Keeping an eye on mummys moves while furtively catching a WWF match has never been easier. The Spy Bag features a remote listening device that has two parts, a sonic dish device with antenna and earbuds. All one needs is to quietly place the sonic device where mom is stationed and plug in those earbuds.

 For playtime, its fighting away at a game of Tek Stik. The game played by two has each fighter trying to hit the orange target zone of the four-feet-long stick held by the opponent. The target zone along with a score pad tracks points. 

 A game of Spy Safe Cracker is all about opening up a play safe within the set time. 

 To settle scores with nagging sisters, scare them with the Spy Light Hand. An adjustable wrist strap has flexible cable-like extensions spread through the fingers glowing blood red in the dark.

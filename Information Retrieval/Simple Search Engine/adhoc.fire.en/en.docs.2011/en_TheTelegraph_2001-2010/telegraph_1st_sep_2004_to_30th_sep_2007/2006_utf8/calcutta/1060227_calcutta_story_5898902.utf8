 Raid reveals fake liquor

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Beware. The branded foreign liquor you are buying from a registered off-shop or even a bar may be spurious. 

 Excise officials, conducting a string of raids, recovered nearly 16,000 litres of chemicals, worth Rs 50 lakh, in the Dum Dum area. 

 The seizure of an equivalent amount of acetone and methylated spirit from the shop indicated that fake liquor is already being circulated in the market. 

 The excise wing of North 24-Parganas has stumbled upon the racket dealing in spurious liquor packed in fake cartons of reputed brands. The district administration came to know about the racket last weekend, during a raid by excise department officials. Shop-owner Samit Sadh was arrested for selling and storing the fake liquor.

 ?This is an organised racket, involving people who supply spurious whisky, rum and vodka of well-known brands to bars. Raids are on and we are trying to ascertain how far the racket has spread,? Parvez Siddiqi, additional district magistrate of North 24-Parganas, said on Sunday.

 He claimed that so far, 270 litres of spurious liquor were seized and three persons arrested for storing, transporting and selling fake brands.

 ?The target areas were Dum Dum, Khardah and Habra on the city?s northern fringes. The entire belt is linked to both underground and surface railways,? said an official.

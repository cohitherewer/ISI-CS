The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Forum to teach tricks of the trade

 Telling tales : 

 This Tuesday was time for some fun and learning for 

 the toddlers of Kidz Konclave. Singer Usha Uthup dropped 

 by for a storytelling session. She read with much ado 

 from Pinocchio, Ugly Duckling, Princess 

 And The Frog and a few short stories from Treasury 

 of Best Loved Tales. The next treat was a granny 

 of one of the students narrating her experiences to 

 the little ones. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 Professional Excellence Beyond Academics, is the name of the game. Topping in academics is all well and good, but what purpose does it serve if you can?t get a decent job after? 

 It was to help parents and students figure this out that Emerge Professionals? Management Senate (EPMS), a Mumbai-based progressive self-help forum for students, in collaboration with Development Support Network, a Calcutta-based development consulting organisation, organised a seminar on the subject at Academy of Fine Arts on March 16.

 Nishchal Singh, associate vice-president, Emerge, took the opportunity to launch four of Emerge?s educational programmes ? the National Fellowship programme, Job Trendz, Student Parliament and a postgraduate diploma in Applied Management. 

 Said Singh, the keynote speaker at the seminar: ?Unemployment, one of the biggest problems the a student or a young professional faces today, is directly proportional to irrelevant or mismatched employment.? Stressing on the dysfunctionalities of the Indian education system, he pointed out that the contemporary Indian educational scenario revolves around theoretical learning only, and is lacking in the practical aspect. 

 ?The learning that a student acquires in college does not match with the expectations of the employer and the practical job requirements of the industry,? he explained. Singh then went on to describe Emerge?s basic objective ? ?optimising hands-on skill sets through various modules in career charting?. 

 The aim is to encourage ?professional excellence, facilitate international work place exposure, engender a sense of social responsibility and provide students and young professionals a platform to share network and experience to develop business and management skills for future business owner and managers?. 

 The Calcutta stop comes after centres in Maharashtra, Lucknow, Kanpur and Delhi. A small survey conducted in the city proved there was a potential market for Emerge?s programmes. 

 ?Calcutta has always been known as an intellectual powerhouse, but we felt that there was a lack of application in its education system.? EPMS has had talks with Ramkrishna Mission in Calcutta to launch its programmes through the Mission?s network.

 The Emerge programmes have been designed not only to provide choices to students at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, but also for professionals looking to make a career switch. 

 The National Fellowship Programme is a year round activity to identify deserving students for the Senate and every year, students from all over the country participate in the competition and are presented with an opportunity to earn an annual fellowship grant. 

 Job Trendz is a multi-faceted programme primarily designed to develop self-assessment skills for an overall improvement of professional personality. It encourages a 360-degree approach by a student towards his career.

 ?Job Trendz is the beginning or the starting point of a lifelong learning experience for a student or any young professional to inculcate what we call AAA ? aptitude, approach and attitude. Job Trendz can be defined as a form of learning and development planning toolkit and is intended to assist students in creating their own learning and development plan,? pointed out Singh.

 The concept behind Student Parliament is to promote socio-economic awareness within the student population in India. The main objective of the programme is to focus on the action plan leading to a problem-solving approach. 

 The mission is to enable student collectives to locate out social and economic problems, issues and areas in their own vicinity and through individual as well as group efforts find workable solutions and engage communities to work for sustainable action. 

 Throwing some light on Emerge?s three-month, full-time Applied Management programme, Singh says it is ?the first of its kind? development programme. It aims to provide professional exposure, mentoring and organisational skill sets to train young graduates or postgraduates to become successful professionals. 

 The three months training and apprenticeship programme is designed to teach students various aspects of the modern workplace, by helping them to experience firsthand multi-functionality and multi-tasking.

 Students get a certificate of participation for The National Fellowship Programme, Job Trendz and Student Parliament. For the three-month MBA, they get an autonomous Postgraduate Diploma in Management. 

 ?Emerge is a membership-based forum and has an array of student-centric activities and programmes that are lined up throughout the year in order to mentor students to choose a right career path and develop competency that matches the day to day job expectations of an employer,?Singh summed up.

 Pinter perfect

 It is always heartening to see a low budget theatre production pulled off well, especially a Harold Pinter play, whose works are notoriously difficult to get right. Many a duff, crude production of Pinter has hit English stages, at both amateur and professional levels. Which made it all the more surprising to see a very assured, straightforward performance of The Homecoming at Gyan Manch by the Theatrician collective. 

 It was intriguing to see how a group of young Bengali actors would interpret the work of Pinter, the disturbing wonderboy of post-war English theatre. 

 With the exception of an excellent production of The Birthday Party at the Birmingham Rep, great productions of Pinter are few and far between (at least for quite some time) in his home country. Amateur and fringe theatre are the only other outlets for Pinter?s works, with productions more often than not capsizing in a storm of cast ego clashes and misinterpretation of the script. 

 Director Tathagata Singha and friends do not fit the amateur stereotype. Another interesting aspect of this production is the background of the cast. Between them, they study or have studied a wide range of subjects, ranging from physics and economics, through to English literature. 

 The vast majority of actors in the UK exist only within the rarefied atmosphere of arts subjects. ?I did physics at university, but I didn?t feel as if I was using my brain properly, the thought processes were too mechanical. With the, theatre I feel I am really stretching myself.? said Singha. 

 Funding for small-scale theatre seems to be a persistent problem for actors all over the world. Except for the big budget West End musicals, theatre has definitely become a minority interest in Britain.

 Singha spelt out the obstacles facing the smaller theatre companies in Calcutta, confirming that ?financing plays have always been tough. Also, in performing English language plays, we automatically become a marginal interest within the theatre world.?

 How would The Homecoming, a bizarre, dark, confusing and irrational play, be received by an Indian audience? Many English performances of (among others) The Homecoming, The Birthday Party, Mountain Language and A Night Out have received baffled, stony responses from the audience. 

 It was heartening then, to see an audience that not only understood the humour, but was also notably silent in the more disturbing moments in the play.

 Singha further dispels the notion that drama might not transcend culture: ?I think the themes of The Homecoming are universal, and the humour does translate. A lot of English playwrights have written plays which contain ideas that we identify with and enjoy. We really enjoy absurdist theatre, which was very strong in Europe and America.?

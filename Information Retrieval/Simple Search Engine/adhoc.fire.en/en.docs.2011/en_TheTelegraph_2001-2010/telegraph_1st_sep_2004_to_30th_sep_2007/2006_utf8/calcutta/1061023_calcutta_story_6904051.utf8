 The nuisance of noise has made a comeback in the Festival of Lights. As deafening crackers were burst all across the city and the adjoining areas, Saturday evening brought back the worst memories of the pre-1996 days. The situation turned from bad to worse, as the evening wore on.

 There have been reports of violations in south Calcutta. But the situation was not that bad in other places, claimed Sudip Banerjee, chairman, West Bengal Pollution Control Board. 

 The board received 30 complaints of noise-norm violation stipulated at 90 decibels for crackers and 65 decibels for loudspeakers from Ballygunge Circular Road, Bhowanipore, Kasba, Kalighat, Gariahat, Behala, Jadavpur and Lake Town. 

 Reports of violations well beyond midnight also came in from Salt Lake, Rajarhat, Howrah and Hooghly. 

 We passed on all the complaints to police immediately on receiving them, said a pollution control board official. 

 P.K. Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) agreed. We got reports of large-scale violations in certain parts of south Calcutta, like Alipore and Shakespeare Sarani. 

 On Kali puja-Diwali night, Calcutta Police arrested 645 persons for violation of noise norms. In Salt Lake, police rounded up 80 persons. 

 Banned crackers were burst as the surveillance was lax, complained environment activist Subhas Dutta. Sound limiters, mandated by the environment department to keep loudspeaker volume within limit, were conspicuous by their absence.

 Even silence zones like hospitals were not spared banned crackers or loudspeakers, said Dutta, who visited several hospitals in the city to check the state of sound pollution on Saturday night.

 The authorities at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital filed a formal complaint with Bhowanipore police station as the patients complained of deafening noise around the hospital.

 The neighbouring buildings were the source of the noise and so we made a formal complaint, said B.K. Saha, wardmaster of the hospital.

 This time, we found that in most cases, the major violators of noise norms were the multi-storeyed buildings, said deputy commissioner Chatterjee.

 In July, the pollution control board and police had worked out a plan on how to maintain silence around hospitals. But Kali puja-Diwali night proved the plan is still on paper.

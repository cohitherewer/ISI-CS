 Colleges shy away from varsity offer

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta Universitys plan to raise academic standards by reducing its workload has hit a roadblock, with a proposal to empower colleges to conduct the undergraduate (general) exams being turned down by the principals.

 The principals have expressed their unwillingness to shoulder the responsibility, fearing they would be under pressure from local influential individuals to pass undeserving candidates, leading to a deterioration in academic standards.

 The system proposed by the university cannot work, said K.C. Saha, general secretary of the CPM-controlled college principals council. We will surely be forced to dole out favours to below-average students if we are to conduct the BA, B.Sc and B.Com (general) exams. We cannot accept the proposal.

 The principals have pointed out to the university authorities how the colleges are often forced to admit students beyond their authorised capacity. The same kind of pressure will be exerted on us if we conduct the undergraduate tests, Saha added.

 Taking note of the principals opposition, university registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay said: The proposal is still at a preliminary stage. We will discuss the issue with all college heads before taking a decision.

 The principals who, Saha claimed, are united on the issue will clarify their stand at the next undergraduate council meeting of the university.

 They will also take up the matter with the government and the Left Front education cell, which finalises all major education policies of the state. Some of our members are also part of the education cell. They will table the issue at the next meeting, Saha said.

 The universitys examination-related workload has been increasing by the year, with more and more colleges opening courses in emerging areas and new colleges being set up. 

 The mounting workload, the authorities feel, is taking its toll on the universitys academic quality.

 Around 300,000 examinees appear in the BA, B.Sc and B.Com (both honours and general) exams every year. The university has to engage around 8,000 examiners to evaluate more than 1.5 million answer scripts.

 The authorities feel one-third of the load would be reduced if the colleges are allowed to conduct the undergraduate (general) exams.

 All fans of Bobby McFerrin?s Don?t worry, be happy and Louis Armstrong?s scat solos sit up, a cappella is here! 

 In coming days, Calcutta will witness the first live performance of a cappella music by Penn Masala, a 15-member student band from the University of Pennsylvania. 

 They will present an exciting mix of popular compositions ? filmi songs to classical music ? at Kala Mandir on January 10, 7 pm, and Swabhumi on January 11, 6.30 pm. The programmes, hosted by Hutch and Sangeet Kalamandir, will be open to all. A similar show at National Centre of Performing Arts, Mumbai, got a great response and more radio programmes and collaborations with DJs are in the offing.

 A cappella, an Italian word meaning ?church style?, harks back to the time when musical instruments were not allowed in church. 

 Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, it has established itself as a genre where groups strive to vocally reproduce every sound of a particular composition without the help of instruments. It is a rage in the college circuit, with each university producing its own groups, contests and festivals. 

 Take Penn Masala, formed 10 years back by four freshers as an Indian representation in the a cappella race. ?There are over 10 a cappella bands in our university, but none sings Hindi songs,? explained band member Bharat Mondgil. Today, Penn Masala has to its credit five albums, a music video and 12 original compositions like Ankhon mein tu hai. They have given music to the film American Desi and hold professional shows every month. Their spring show in Philadelphia was a sell-out and in North Carolina, they had a packed audience, 7,000-strong. 

 There is every possibility that they may do more music for Bollywood soon.

 ?Thanks to a lot of support from the university, we can practise 10 hours a day,? said Prateek Surekha, an ex-student who runs a software business in Calcutta but is still part of the band. Prateek was around when the Penn Masala albums began coming out ? Awaaz in 1999, 11pm in 2001, Sound Check in 2003 and Out of Stock and Brown Albumin in 2005. 

 ?We do Hindi film songs, but bits of Arabic, Tamil, Punjabi and English lyrics creep in. It?s the same when we do classical Hindustani or Carnatic music. In fact, nothing remains the same,? said Prateek. 

 Ankit Saha, who is majoring in music and can play the piano, says it is sacrilege for an a cappella singer to bring instruments to rehearsals. 

 ?The most essential part is the breaking up of the arrangement and assigning the roles. There is nothing fixed. A person may be doing lead vocal, base and percussion by turns.? 

 Prateek summed up: ?It?s all about group interaction and understanding and love of music.?

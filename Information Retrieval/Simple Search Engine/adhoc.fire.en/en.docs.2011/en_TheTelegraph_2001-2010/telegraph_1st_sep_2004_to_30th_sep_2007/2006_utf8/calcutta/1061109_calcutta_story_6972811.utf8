 NON-RESIDENT 

 CALCUTTAN

 Interiors of the Reina 

 Sofia Museum in Madrid

 The idea that coming to India 

 would further my artistic growth struck me a few years ago. 

 It was a hot, summer afternoon and I was strolling through 

 galleries at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid. There I came 

 upon a large retrospective of Bhupen Kakkars work 

 that set into motion the first inklings of my journey to 

 India.

 During my New York period, I had 

 questioned the relevance of my own ethnic identity and cultural 

 background to art-making at length. What did my artistic 

 heritage mean to me? Could I incorporate it into my art 

 in meaningful ways? Would it find an audience outside of 

 India? 

 This kind of questioning happened 

 frequently, and although I knew there was a connection to 

 be made, the nature of such a connection seemed beyond my 

 immediate comprehension. Coming upon Kakkars work 

 at the Reina Sofia was like being transported to India. 

 In the midst of everything European, 

 I was suddenly surrounded by dizzying kaleidoscopes of Indian 

 life: rural landscapes, country folk, makeshift huts, stray 

 dogs and stragglers during languorous afternoons, lonely 

 old men hanging over balconies in search of solace, veiled 

 women carrying on with their solemn enterprise, and more. 

 I stayed a long time with those images, allowing a world 

 that was known and familiar, if somewhat distanced through 

 time, to wrap itself around me. 

 The effortlessness of Kakkars 

 Indian-ness seemed to me both seductive and strange. In 

 the presence of his work, I felt, on the one hand, privy 

 to a world I instinctively knew, and on the other, physically 

 remote from the places these images projected. 

 Someone like Kakkar, I realised, 

 would never be preoccupied with his Indian-ness, not simply 

 because he was Indian, but because he was both in and of 

 India. 

 Whereas I would ask Whats 

 Indian about me? Kakkar would simply respond: I 

 am India, India is me. In the absence of questions 

 pertaining to personal claim, Kakkar was free to depict 

 an India he knew first-hand, and his India was a mini-world 

 of private pleasures, hidden desires and undiscovered possibilities. 

 It was a realm of his invention, 

 but one that I could immediately grasp and identify with. 

 The authenticity of rightful ownership coupled with direct 

 experience allowed Kakkar to be present in his life, and 

 by extension, his work. I knew then that I had to go to 

 India. 

 Four years (and many upheavals) 

 later, I write from Calcutta, also the place of my birth. 

 Since I arrived, I have noticed a subtle, but definite, 

 change in my thinking. 

 The old nagging questions (How 

 do I communicate my Indian-ness?) have been supplanted 

 by new ones (How do I communicate my experience here 

 and now?). The shift has been freeing. 

 Instead of searching for images 

 that might best communicate my Indian-ness, I am able to 

 focus more wholly on my response to my immediate environment. 

 Oddly enough, I find myself pulled 

 further into the world of abstraction and preoccupied thus 

 with ideas of light, colour and gesture, than towards any 

 specific imagery. 

 It could be that Ive found 

 my context and that the images that play around me in real 

 life are just waiting to creep in to my work. And even if 

 they dont, for now I am assured that the things around 

 me are my own, and that my claims to them need not be so 

 emphatic.

 and America, Sharmistha Ray is currently getting her feet 

 wet in the Mumbai art world

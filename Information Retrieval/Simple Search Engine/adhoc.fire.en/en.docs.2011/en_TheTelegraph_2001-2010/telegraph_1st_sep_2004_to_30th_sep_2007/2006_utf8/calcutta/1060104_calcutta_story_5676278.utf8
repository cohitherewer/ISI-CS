The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The footbridges built by Calcutta Municipal Corporation at Dhakuria and Ballygunge are redundant. Even during rush hours pedestrians prefer crossing the roads without using the footbridges. In the process, they always flout road rules. The possibility of accidents is also increased manifold because of this practice. Traffic policemen manning these crossings should conduct frequent drives to penalise the offenders. Only then can the chaos on roads be curbed.

 Calcutta Telephones recently brought out an advertisement in a newspaper announcing the opening of BSNL?s state-of-the-art customer service centre on Judges Court Road and of an information and media centre at Telephone Bhavan. The phone numbers of these two centres should also have been provided in the advertisement so that CalTel customers can benefit from these facilities.

 Most areas under Mahestala municipality do not have proper street lighting. From Jinjirabazar to Shyampukurbazar, all residents face severe problems in winter months because of the dimly lit roads. Also, pay-and-use toilets are urgently needed in most areas, including Dakghar crossing and Sakuntala Oxytown. 

 Pintu Samanta,

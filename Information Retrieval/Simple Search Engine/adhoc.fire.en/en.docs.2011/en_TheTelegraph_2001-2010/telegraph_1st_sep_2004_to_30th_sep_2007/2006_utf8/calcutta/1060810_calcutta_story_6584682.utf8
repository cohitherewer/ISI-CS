 The state government has decided to constitute a three-member committee to assess proposals by two companies to take over Behala Flying Club. The earlier plan was to scrap the tender, floated in June.

 The technical committee will comprise one officer each from the directorate-general of civil aviation, Airports Authority of India and Indian Air Force.

 We have decided to form a technical committee as we do not have the expertise to judge the capability of bidders to run a pilot training institute. We will place the offers by the companies before the panel for scrutiny. The committee will make the choice, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb told Metro on Tuesday.

 The committee is to begin work within a fortnight. 

 The government had decided to scrap the tender inviting private companies to restore, renovate and run the pilot training institute as the response had not been satisfactory.

 At least six companies, including Jet Airways, had expressed interest in taking over the flying club, but after the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation floated the tender, only two companies Pailan Group and Manpower Development and Management Private Limited submitted bids.

 Government officials said the tender was initially being scrapped as the companies that had submitted financial bids did not have experience in running flight training institutes. The companies, however, run institutes to train air hostesses and aircraft maintenance engineers.

 We do not want to take any decision on our own. We will go by the technical committees judgment. If the panel selects one of the bidders, we will hand over the flying club to it. If it opines that neither of the companies is eligible to run the club, we will float a fresh tender, explained the chief secretary.

 According to Writers Buildings officials, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had expressed dissatisfaction over the chief ministers decision to scrap the tender. 

 He had made party secretary Biman Bose direct Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to involve some experts in the selection process.

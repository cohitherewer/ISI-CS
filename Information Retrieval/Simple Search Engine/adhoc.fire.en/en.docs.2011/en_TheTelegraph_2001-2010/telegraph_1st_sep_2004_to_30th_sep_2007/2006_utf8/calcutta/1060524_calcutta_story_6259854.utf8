 With a fortnight to go before the world sways to Ronaldinho?s ?elastico? moves and follows the course of Beckham?s curling crosses, World Cup fever has hit a high on Calcutta?s retail racks.

 Be it the ?never-before? 14-panel seamless official match ball by Adidas called Teamgeist, or the History Tees featuring the talismanic number 10 of Maradona and Zidane, or off-pitch lifestyle accessories like wallets, wristbands, socks, bags and caps ? soccer is hot stuff.

 Teenagers form the core customer group, say retailers, with the 14-to-18 age group leading the soccer splurge.

 Girls, too, are getting a kick out of a range of World Cup apparel. 

 ?From tanks to spaghetti tops, sports bras to short-sleeved tees and three-quarter pants, the ladies? line in various team stripes is moving very well,? says Kamal Jain, who owns Nike and Adidas stores at City Centre and on Shakespeare Sarani.

 Calcutta?s eternal love affair with samba soccer is again spearheading sales. 

 ?The Brazil team shirt is the hot cake and Ronaldinho?s jersey seems to be the pop pick at this point,? says Jain.

 If Nike, the US sportswear giant, is playing with a single pivot called Brazil, European major Adidas, official partner of Fifa till 2014, has packed its merchandise midfield with an eclectic spread of official licensed products. 

 As apparel sponsor for Germany, France, Argentina, Spain, Japan and Trinidad amp; Tobago, it has put out all federation shirts.

 It?s time for the Calcutta consumer to have a ball, mostly for souvenir value. 

 ?We expect every single Teamgeist ball to be lapped up by Calcutta,? says an Adidas official.

 ?Even the replicas of the match ball are moving well, as are footballs in the different team colours and those with the Cup depicted on them,? says Madhusudan Binani, an Adidas franchisee.

 ?Calcutta is crucial to all the players in the soccer merchandise matrix, and country plans are often drawn up going by the response here,? observes retail consultant Amit Singh, who predicts a 100 per cent jump in city sales compared to Japan-Korea 2002.

 Minutes away from Bangur Hospital in Tollygunge stands Radha Studio. The two-storeyed building, which came into being as the cradle of Radha Films Company in 1932, is also part of Bengal?s communication history as the first address of Doordarshan Kendra, Calcutta, when it started transmission in 1975. A year away from the 75th year of its existence, the building is again abuzz with cries of ?lights, camera, action?.

 Kolkata Film and Television Institute (KFTI), helmed by screen and stage luminaries of today, has set up base on the ground floor of the building. ?We encourage students to eat, sleep and dream films. What better atmosphere can one expect for classes with a floor that has seen so much shooting??says KFTI?s Anumita Dasgupta. 

 A visit on a working afternoon reveals Indrani Halder in an off-screen avatar ? a tough-talking teacher taking students to task. ?Look at the camera. I will be addressing you at a random order individually. You are to answer facing the camera without turning to me.? In their first class with camera, most students fail the test, instinctively glancing at the speaker. ?Why are you moving so much while speaking? Look at the recording; it seems an earthquake is taking place,? she chides a boy, while explaining how sensitive the camera is. 

 The actress is head of the acting department that includes Soumitra Chatterjee, Ashoke Mukhopadhyay, Debesh Roychowdhury and Chandan Sen. ?We have learnt things on the job ? camera angles, taking the light? They are lucky to be able to step into the industry well-versed in theoretical, technical and practical skills,? Indrani explains. 

 Outside on the courtyard, where stars of yesteryear would play badminton during shooting breaks, Toronto-based choreographer Sukalyan Bhattacharya is taking another batch through the motions. ?I groom their body movement and instil a sense of three basic rhythm structures ? dadra, kaharba and teora ? on which most compositions are based.? 

 The students hail from a mixed background. Some have experience in modelling or bit roles but many, especially from the suburbs, are completely uninitiated. ?The proximity to the reigning names of Tollywood, like Soumitrada or Indranidi, is a huge bonus. I had misgivings about exploitation of women in the industry. I can clear such doubts face-to-face here,? said a student. Some families are also wary of letting their wards join films. ?If I see talent, I speak to the parents myself. I have goodwill; they believe me,? Indrani says.

 Initially, many come star-struck. ?I have to field bouncers to check how passionate they are about joining the profession,? smiles Indrani. No space for idlers here. even if they are ready to pay.

 Some students appeared in the 1000th episode of the serial Tithir Atithi in February. ?They carried off a seven-minute item alongside Indrani with such elan that no one could make out they had no formal training in dance,? beamed Sukalyan. 

 The floor inside, meanwhile, is receiving final touches for the shooting of the weekly TV interview Songe Indrani. The camera is set to roll; the show at Radha Studio goes on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hospitality 

 vs industry

 The flight landed in Bagdogra 

 as per schedule. The car was prearranged, the driver was 

 waiting with an identification board. By the time we reached 

 Darjeeling, it was well past tea time. The lovely lady at 

 the reception was, however, as bright as the morning sun. 

 After settling down, we were escorted to the tea room. The 

 afternoon tea and a buffet of sumptuous snacks had been 

 kept warm, especially for us. This was not the only instance; 

 the remainder of our stay was also pleasantly punctuated 

 by acts of thoughtfulness from the hotel.

 A week later, a trip to Mumbai 

 became unavoidable. The travel agency could not find any 

 room in any decent hotel. Eventually, a room in one of the 

 hotels near the domestic airport was booked. The price was 

 an astronomical Rs 15,000 a night, plus taxes. The room 

 was as antiseptic as any other. 

 By the time one settled down, 

 it was time for a drink. The tray the waiter brought in 

 had a glass of whiskey, a bucket of ice and a tongue to 

 pick up the cubes. No wafers, no nuts, not even a slice 

 of cucumber.

 What was more surprising was that 

 there was no club soda or water on offer. One naturally 

 assumed that this was an oversight and asked for some water. 

 The waiter said he could get me 

 a bottle of water, but I must pay extra. There was not even 

 a hint of apology in the tone. The message was: pay for 

 it or gulp it.

 That Darjeeling and Mumbai are 

 as similar as chalk and cheese is not exactly a revelation. 

 The point to note is that the two experiences happened in 

 two top-of-the-line hotels. At that level one would expect 

 industry best practices to rule rather than geographical 

 location. After all it possibly is not too unreasonable 

 to expect the hospitality industry to be hospitable wherever 

 it be. 

 One understands that a particular 

 hotel may walk the extra mile while another may refrain 

 because it cannot afford the gas. But here one is talking 

 about the hygiene level of hospitality, which one dictionary 

 defines as cordial and generous reception of or disposition 

 toward guests. Perhaps the problem lies with the other 

 relevant term.

 Hospitality is an industry. The 

 hotel in Mumbai, perhaps understandably, construes hospitality 

 as business and does not flaunt it as a genuine reflection 

 of its attitude towards a guest. So when it becomes unavoidable 

 as a dictate of business, its feigns intimacy. 

 In the nights that I was staying 

 there, the business was so good that the hotel did not think 

 it worth its while to go through even the pretension of 

 cordiality.

 Why did the other hotel in Darjeeling 

 choose to behave in an exactly opposite fashion? The most 

 unkind and ready explanation would be that it did not have 

 as good a business as it would have liked on the days of 

 our stay. Hence it had to put on the mask of geniality. 

 That argument falls flat because the Darjeeling hotel did 

 not earn a single rupee extra because of good behaviour. 

 In fact, like the Mumbai hotel the Darjeeling one could 

 have earned a few short-term bucks through consumer insensitivity.

 So the attitude towards us possibly 

 had very little to do with occupancy rate or need to earn 

 more revenue. It is more likely that the Mumbai hotel, like 

 many of its ilk in larger metropolis, treats hospitality 

 as packaging. The real product is possibly the pillows and 

 the linen. And, of course, the halo of belonging to some 

 undefined galaxy.

 For the Darjeeling hotel, hospitality 

 was the product; the very essence of being.

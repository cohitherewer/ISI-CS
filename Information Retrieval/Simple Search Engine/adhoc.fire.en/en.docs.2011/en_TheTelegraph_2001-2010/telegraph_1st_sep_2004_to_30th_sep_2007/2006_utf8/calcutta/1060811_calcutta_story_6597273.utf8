While his Bhumiputra is doing the rounds of 

cinemas, director Raj Mukherjee has got busy delving into the dark recesses of 

a 20-year-olds mind.

Raat Bhor, written by Mukherjee, explores the 

psyche of a young girl from a broken home who becomes obsessed with an elderly 

man.

The mother-daughter duo of Moumita and Rimjhim Gupta 

comes together to play out some of a real-life relation on reel. Krishna Kishore 

Mukherjee plays the doctor who becomes the object of desire of his maniacal patient.

Roopa Ganguly plays the doctors anguished wife, while 

Indrani Halder stars as his college mate who comes down from Delhi.

My role is that of a junior doctor who is a very 

good friend of Krishna Kishores family. Although we seem to have shared a romantic 

alliance in our college days, Im on very good terms with his wife and daughter. 

My outspoken nature and sense of loyalty as a family friend prompts me to take 

a strong stand in trying to save their marriage, says Indrani.

The cast also includes Saheb, Bhaswar Chatterjee and 

Devika Mukherjee.

Rimjhim plays Titir, a whimsical young girl who lives 

with her mother. The impact of her parents separation makes her cynical and obstinate. 

She tries to commit suicide when her parents pressurise her to get married, explains 

Mukherjee, busy shooting at a Bansdroni address.

The drama unfolds when Titir is taken to the doctor, 

who she becomes obsessive about. My character borders on the psychotic, given 

to mood swings and extreme behaviour. Im a little nervous about playing this 

crazy role but since Im a little impulsive, stubborn and sentimental as a person, 

I do identify with certain traits in Titirs character. Maybe that will help me 

sink into the role better, says Rimjhim who has worked in films like Raasta, 

Cheetah, Bhumiputra and Tobu Bhalobashi, apart from a couple of telefilms.

The storyline demanded a logical base for a proper 

understanding of such obsessive behaviour. I sat through detailed discussions 

with psychiatrists and general physicians to get the right insight into these 

sensitive issues that affect youngsters of her age, says the director.

The storyline hasnt been lifted from any Hollywood 

or Bollywood blockbuster, he asserts.

Steering clear of the studios, Mukherjee has chosen 

to shoot at select bungalows and houses around the city.

Raat Bhor is slated for release on September 

29.

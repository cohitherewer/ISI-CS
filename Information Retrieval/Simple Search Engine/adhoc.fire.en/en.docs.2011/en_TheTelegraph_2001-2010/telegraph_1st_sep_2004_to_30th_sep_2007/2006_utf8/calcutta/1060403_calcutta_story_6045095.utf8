 If you think that the Beyblade brigade has stolen a march over gilli danda and marbles that your parents and grandparents grew up playing, it?s time for a reality check. A trip to the toy store will reveal that not only are the traditional games going strong, they hold out the promise to bridge the generation divide.

 The revival route has been charted by organisations like Kreeda. Based in Chennai, the four-year-old group focussed on research aims to bring traditional games back to the retail racks and spread awareness about them through workshops, carnivals and play sessions.

 ?The traditional toys have the ability to bring an 80-year-old man closer to his eight-year-old grandson,? says Vinita Sidhartha, founder of Kreeda. ?They boost mathematical ability and motor sensory skills, and develop decision-making and leadership powers.? 

 Kreeda has compiled a treasure trove of yesteryear games from all over the country. The gems in the collection include Parama Pada Sopanam, a version of Snakes and Ladder, in which the snake squares are named after mythological characters with tragic flaws; Panch Kone, a game of Solitaire; Chaupad, which has evolved into Ludo; and Pallanguzhi.

 Also part of the Kreeda line are modern games with a traditional touch. These include board games like Search for Sita. Priced between Rs 50 and Rs 500, the games are finding fans in the metros and other cities.

 According to sociologists, toys reflect the ideas, desires and concerns of a nation. 

 ?Toys are a mirror to society. That is why children nowadays play with toy computers and mobile phones,? opines Bholanath Bandopadhyay, professor of sociology, Calcutta University.

 ?The revival of traditional toys perhaps owes much to the trend of working parents. Children often play these games with their grandparents. Hence, the toys cement the bond between alternate generations. Moreover, these toys are classier and more innovative,? he explains.

 Sujit Dutta of Wonderland, on Park Street, echoes the academic: ?Ludo and Scrabble develop mental faculties and strengthen family bonds, and can hold their own against computer games and Beyblades.? 

 ?Old-world charm might be the top draw of traditional toys, but anything that appeals to the intellect and has an element of skill will always find takers,? asserts Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark.

 ?We sell 10-12 Kreeda games a month. Even before these games were available, Chinese Checker and Carrom registered steady sales,? he states. 

 Store-owners, however, rue the lack of publicity when it comes to traditional games, especially compared to their electronic counterparts. Parents, on the other hand, would prefer more choice. 

 ?Children are constantly bombarded with advertisements of technology-driven toys and as a result, crave for them. When I go out to buy a toy for my daughter that she can play with the rest of the family members, I hardly find anything beyond Ludo or Monopoly. Whereas, there are new computer games in the store every time,? points out Rachana Banerjee, mother of eight-year-old Piyali.

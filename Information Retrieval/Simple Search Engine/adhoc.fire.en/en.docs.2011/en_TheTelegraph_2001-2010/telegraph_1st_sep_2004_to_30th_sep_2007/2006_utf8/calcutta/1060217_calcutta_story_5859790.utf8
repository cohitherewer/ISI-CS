 City students who wish to go abroad for higher studies can take heart. Princeton Review, a leading US-based test preparation organisation with a presence in 23 countries, has tied up with Manya Education to offer a whole gamut of test preparation and guidance services, ranging from comprehensive teaching programmes, online tutoring, admission consulting services, financing solutions and visa counselling services.

 The educational services organisation which opened its office in Calcutta in 2005 plans to offer academic coaching, as well as counselling services, for students taking the GRE, GMAT and SAT examinations, which have long served as the gateway to both undergraduate as well as postgraduate studies in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.

 Speaking to Metro, Bradley Hoffman of the Princeton Review, said: ?The lack of coaching and support systems for students going abroad has been sorely felt for a while. The standardised tests are not an accurate reflection of a student?s abilities. They thrive on using deceptive language and psychological traps. We aim to help students circumvent these obstacles, and provide them with the much-needed edge.?

 The academic tutorials are of two months? duration, but students can also avail of one-to-one sessions with counsellors. However, all this comes at a price. The tutorials cost Rs 7,500 and upward. ?What the students will be spending here will be inconsequential compared to the overall costs of studying abroad. The employment opportunities will later underwrite the entire expenditure,? pointed out Hoffman.

 India, which sees almost 20,000 students applying annually to the US alone, also has the second highest number of people appearing for the GRE and GMAT examinations, and Princeton Review and Manya Education feel that there is great potential in this field.

 The organisation feels extremely bullish about Calcutta. Aradhana Khaitan Mahna, executive director, Manya Education, said: ?There has been a huge demand for our services from this part of the country. We will be opening our second centre in Salt Lake in April.?

 Mahna said that Manya Education and Princeton Review had already finalised talks with IIT Kharagpur to open a bi-monthly helpdesk on the Kharagpur campus that would provide counselling services of every kind. They are also holding talks with other engineering institutes and schools in Bengal.

 The organisation will be starting 

 training programmes for language-based tests such as, IELTS 

 and TOEFL as well, and plans to have a presence in almost 

 all major cities of eastern India by 2007-08. ?Students 

 from Bangladesh and Nepal have also expressed great interest 

 in our coaching modules and are willing to come down to 

 Calcutta for the classes,? said Mahna.

 Keeping score 

 Examination marking methods are 

 undergoing modernisation with the introduction of the first 

 Optical Marks Recorder (OMR) in eastern India. The recent 

 adoption of multiple-choice questions in the WBJEE has prompted 

 Calcutta?s Pathfinder Educational Centre to adopt the OMR. 

 It has already been used for examinations across the country, 

 including at the IITs. 

 The OMR marks 10 papers per minute. Debdutta Sreemany, founder and director of Pathfinder, confirmed: ?Our OMR machine is accurate and scientific. With it, we are able to guide our students better.?

 The OMR was conceived in the US, where it has been used for evaluation of examination papers for over 10 years. 

 Responding to past criticism of the system, U.K. Som of Pathfinder said: ?For every 1,000 papers marked, the OMR rejects an of average three papers. That too, if the student doesn?t follow the guidelines that ensure that the OMR accurately marks the paper.?

 The Diary

 From Jazz Visions

 And softly she loses her way, 

 she becomes like that blue translucent glass window

 or the blue voice lost in the saxophone?

 I lift her like a song I lift her like the noon river

 the wind smells orange-brown 

 softly someone lifts the saxophone

 and her sweat loses way

 Pebbles of music

 I got these gifts of pebbles from 

 an Angel tonight, 

 Who had come down to hear our music with overwhelming pride. 

 Where the beautiful moon sprinkles pearls on the flowing river?s delight, 

 Where the dews on the grass excel with the glow-worm?s sight. 

 Hush.... my patience murmurs to hear your melody melt in this plaintive riverside; 

 Who says winter is lonely with hardships as its prize, 

 With you beside me my small robin, our song will continue to mesmerise...

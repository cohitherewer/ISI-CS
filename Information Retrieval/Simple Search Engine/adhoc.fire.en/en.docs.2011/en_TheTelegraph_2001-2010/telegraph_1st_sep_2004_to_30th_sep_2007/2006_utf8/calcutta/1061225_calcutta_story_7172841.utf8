 Research to check corrosion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Anticipating a construction boom in and around Calcutta, Jadavpur University (JU) has decided to start a centre for anti-corrosion research and consultation.

 The centre, to be operational from January 1, will promote research in cost-effective ways to prevent corrosion in bridges, highways, docks, buildings and other structures. The knowhow will be provided to industrial units, especially medium and small ones.

 ONGC, Braithwaite, Electro Steel and Balmer Lawrie have decided to collaborate with the centre.

 The need of the hour is to find viable anti-corrosion techniques, as the country incurs an annual loss of Rs 32,000 crore due to corrosion. Our research will help the government and the industry cut down the loss significantly, said Parthapratim Biswas, a teacher in the construction engineering department and member of the universitys executive council.

 The JU centre the country has another similar facility, in IIT Chennai will be run in collaboration with the Association of Corrosion Engineers and other experts in the field. A memorandum of understanding has been signed by the university and the association.

 The state will witness a spurt in industrial growth in the next few years. As a result, more and more bridges, ports, highways and townships will come up. We have to devise ways to prolong the sustainability of these structures at a low cost. Our research in anti-corrosion measures is part of that effort, said Biswas.

 Small and medium-scale units will form the clientele of the centre. Small units incur the maximum loss due to corrosion, as the existing remedial measures are too expensive for them, he added.

 What: 

 My Fair Lady by Calcutta Club members. 

 Where: GD Birla Sabhagar.

 When: Sunday, 6.30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: It was a packed venue with the young, not so young and the old eagerly waiting to catch the play, many of them for the second time. Once you sat through My Fair Lady, put up by Calcutta Club members, you knew why. For the expressions, dialogue delivery and comic timing were quite commendable.

 The play based on George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion was directed by Rena Ghosh. Piali Ray playing flower girl Eliza Doolittle and Partha Ghosh as Professor Henry Higgins had the audience in splits.

 The two central characters were supported by Suman Mukerjee playing Alfred P. Doolittle, Shyamal Kumar Banerjee enacting Colonel Pickering, Deepika Jaidka in the role of Mrs Higgins and others.

 The background score accentuated the performances. The stage set-up, lighting, costumes, make-up and the backdrop in keeping with the scenes had been meticulously planned and executed. 

 Voiceover: Every year we come up with one Bengali and one English play and this year we picked My Fair Lady. We had amateurs performing, but they were in no way less than thorough professionals in the way they went about their task. The play went down exceptionally well with our members the first time we staged it and it had to be repeated on demand, said club committee member Sambhu Mukherjee.

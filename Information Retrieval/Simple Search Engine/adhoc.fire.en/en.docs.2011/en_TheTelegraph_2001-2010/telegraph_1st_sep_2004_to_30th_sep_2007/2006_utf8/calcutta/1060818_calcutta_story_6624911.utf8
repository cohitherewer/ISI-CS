 Apropos the report Ramps to set right high roads, 

 July 12, as a retired railway signal engineer with long 

 experience in design and construction of complex railway 

 traffic systems, I feel addition of the three ramps to the 

 AJC Bose Road flyover move will only lead to a minor improvement. 

 A better arrangement is possible. 

 A ramp should be constructed at the western end 

 of the flyover to lead the traffic bound for Esplanade to 

 the eastern side of the race course. This will save a lot 

 of time of the motorists, who get stuck in traffic snarls 

 The Camac Street ramp will be better utilised in the reverse direction. The traffic from Camac Street towards the eastern end of the flyover is much heavier in volume than the traffic from the western end of the flyover moving towards Camac Street. This ramp should, in fact, be made one-way. The direction of traffic flow can be periodically reversed with the help of a U-turn at Rabindra Sadan crossing, where there is adequate space. 

 Similarly, another U-turn at the junction of Beckbagan Road and a ramp on Gurusaday Road could allow flow of one-way traffic along Gurusaday Road and Sarat Bose Road. 

 It is amazing that the Japanese consultant for the project is now being blamed for the flaws in its design. Is it possible for a consultant to take the final decision ignoring the parent organisation?

 Apropos the report Lawmen in lunge at lady, July 15, it is shocking and shameful that such an incident happened in a civilised city like Calcutta. We must protest against the Left Front governments indulgent attitude towards policemen, who are known to assault women in broad daylight for a few extra bucks. Perhaps, busy with attracting investment, our chief minister has no time to look into these insignificant matters. A probe should be conducted into the incident without delay. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Police are the most organised 

 criminals in India. The honourable chief minister can do 

 all he can to portray the force as friendly, but it will 

 remain nothing more than a dream. Innumerable people have 

 been tortured to death in lock-up by police. The cop guilty 

 of harassing the lady should be sacked. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata. 

 Apropos the report Police lunge 

 buck passes, July 19, it is a bitter truth that during 

 the Left Front rule, the people who are supposed to uphold 

 the law have become tyrants. What is intriguing is that 

 chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee does not run out 

 of praises for the cops, no matter how reckless they are. 

 The diabolical murder of sergeant Bapi Sen is a black mark 

 in the history of Indian police. The chief minister should 

 think twice before he begins one of his paeans in praise 

 of police. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 Women often exploit their femininity 

 for small favours. And maligning police is a favourite pastime 

 for a lot of people. These two factors combined to create 

 an avoidable hoopla over the incident in front of the civic 

 headquarters. The lady is not a damsel in distress; she 

 is an arrogant law-breaker. Unregistered two-wheelers are 

 also not as benign as the media would have us believe. That 

 the two-wheeler managed to reach downtown from Howrah does 

 not reflect well on police surveillance. 

 Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar.

 Urmila Matondkar flew down to Calcutta just to attend the opening ceremony of a Rakhi mela (Endearing bonds, July 19)! She indeed has a lot of affection for Calcuttans. And for a festival on August 9, she flew down as early as July 18! Three cheers to the lady. With Calcutta attracting such fans, we expect better amenities and systematic traffic. 

 T.R. Anand, 

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report Landfill cry confirmed, July 31, the headline reflects that South City has encroached on Bikramgarh Jheel. However, we are not aware of a report by a panel set up by the chief secretary stating that. South City has never claimed that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is squarely liable for encroachment and/or dumping on Bikramgarh Jheel. Vasundhara Foundation, an NGO operating in the area had made the observation, which we quoted in our letter to the state pollution control board. 

 D.J. Chakraborty,

 Manager Corporate amp; PR, South City Projects

 Metro replies: We have 

 one copy of the report submitted to the chief secretary 

 by the panel. The letter written by South City to the state 

 pollution control boards senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee 

 makes no mention of Vasundhara Foundation while claiming 

 that the CMC is liable for encroachment of Bikramgarh Jheel 

 and/or dumping of waste on it. Metro has only quoted 

 from the letter.

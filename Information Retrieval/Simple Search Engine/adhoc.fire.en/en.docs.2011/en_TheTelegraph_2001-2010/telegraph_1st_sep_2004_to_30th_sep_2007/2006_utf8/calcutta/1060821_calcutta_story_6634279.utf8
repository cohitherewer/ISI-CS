The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hard Talk 

 Highrises minus basic facility

 Rainwater stands tall on the streets 

 of Behala after even a brief shower. A Telegraph picture

 Sovan Chatterjee, chairman of Borough 

 XIV, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The 

 Telegraph at his office to answer their queries. Participants 

 included Aloke Saha, Pradip Adhikary, Sipra Ghatak, Shyamadas 

 Roy, Sova Ghosh and Radharaman Ghosh

 Radharaman Ghosh: Several multi-storeyed building projects 

 are coming up in this area. But these projects lack proper 

 infrastructure. These are no sewerage or drinking water lines. 

 How can these projects get sanctioned even after lacking the 

 basic facilities? 

 You have pointed out a very important 

 aspect of these housing projects. There are many buildings 

 which do not have proper drinking water supply or sewerage 

 lines. 

 In that sense, all these construction 

 are illegal and pose a great threat, because the inhabitants 

 of these buildings will be putting an extra pressure on 

 the water supply, electricity and other facilities, which 

 will affect the local residents. 

 But currently, we dont have enough 

 funds to upgrade the infrastructure.

 Aloke Saha: During your tenure 

 as mayoral council member in the water supply department, 

 you had taken a few steps to improve the water supply in 

 the city. Some of the projects are still incomplete. Can 

 you suggest what steps should be taken immediately to improve 

 the water supply situation?

 A lot of work has to be done to 

 improve water supply in the city. I could complete only 

 a part of the whole project. 

 Work on a parallel water carriage 

 line beside Beleghata Canal is yet to be completed. We had 

 already laid the pipeline in Raja Dinendra Street. Just 

 four km of the line was incomplete. But I am surprised that 

 even after 16 months, the new civic board couldnt lay the 

 rest of the line.

 Another 11-km pipeline from Garden 

 Reach was to be laid, so that water from the boosting station 

 can reach the city easily. Of the total, we had laid 10.8 

 km during our tenure. But the present civic body couldnt 

 construct the remaining 200 metres till now. 

 Besides, the depth of Palta Jheel 

 has gone down to 3.5 ft from 18 ft. This has to be checked 

 immediately. The list of such pending works is quite long 

 and unless they are completed, the water supply scenario 

 in the city will not improve.

 Pradip Adhikary: The drainage 

 system in Ramkrishnanagar, Purbanchal and Sarada Pally is 

 in a mess. This situation has not improved even after the 

 area was incorporated in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation 

 (CMC). What is the main reason behind this problem?

 Even after these areas were incorporated 

 in the CMC, the civic board has not taken a single step 

 to upgrade the infrastructure here. A huge corpus is needed 

 to build up the required infrastructure. 

 These places are ideal for executing 

 the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) with 

 Asian Development Bank funds. But sadly, these areas were 

 not included in the ongoing development schemes undertaken 

 by the CEIP.

 Sipra Ghatak: I am the councillor 

 of ward no. 125.There is an acute shortage of drinking water 

 in my ward. Due to some technical problem, we cannot immediately 

 lay the pipes for drinking water. Earlier, we managed by 

 installing a few handpumps. Recently, I was informed that 

 the water supply department has installed three more handpumps 

 without my knowledge. How can they take such a step without 

 informing me?

 It is very unfortunate that the 

 water supply department is installing hand-pumps in a ward 

 without informing the local councillor. 

 This is a gross violation of a 

 standing order in the CMC, where the local councillor has 

 to be informed before carrying out any development work 

 in the area. I will take up the issue in the CMC board meeting.

 It can be possible that the mayor-in-council 

 and the local councillor are from different political parties. 

 And maybe there is a communication gap. For the projects 

 to succeed, a joint effort by both the parties is advisable 

 and required.

 Sova Ghosh: Garbage has piled 

 up in several places across ward no. 131. The stench is 

 unbearable. The garbage is not collected for days and as 

 a result, is polluting the entire locality.

 I am aware of the problem. Due 

 to the ongoing construction work of roads and drainage lines 

 by the CEIP, the vehicles for garbage collection cannot 

 enter these areas. The work will be completed very soon. 

 Till then, we will use the small handcarts to collect the 

 garbage.

 To be concluded

 Monsoon showers clog streets 

 Shyamadas Roy: Waterlogging has become a big problem for 

 the areas in Sabarnapara Road, KK Roychowdhury Road and 

 other areas in ward no. 126. Even after a light shower, 

 the areas get submerged. Earlier, the situation was not 

 that grim. What is reason behind this? 

 It is a low-lying area. Therefore, waterlogging is not unusual. 

 Earlier, we used to pump out the water accumulated in the 

 area. Even this year, we had engaged the pump operators 

 to drain out the water. But the operators were allegedly 

 beaten up and their pumps damaged by a few local youths. 

 As a result, the water got accummulated even after a light 

 shower. I have already informed the present mayor, Bikash 

 Ranjan Bhattacharyya, about the development. But to date, 

 he hasnt taken any step.

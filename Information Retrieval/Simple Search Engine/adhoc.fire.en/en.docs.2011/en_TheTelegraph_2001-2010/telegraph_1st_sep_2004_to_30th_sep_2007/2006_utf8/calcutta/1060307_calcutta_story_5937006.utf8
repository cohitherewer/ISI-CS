 Draped dresses amp; diamonds

 An eclectic cavalcade of glamorous draped gowns and diamonds in a host of colours, peppered with one-shoulder dresses on such stars as Keira Knightley and Naomi Watts, graced the Oscars red carpet on Sunday night (early Monday, India time).

 Sophisticated gathered bodices and draped looks prevailed, harkening back to the elegant early days of Hollywood glamour and class.

 But nominee Charlize Theron cut through the soft, flowing styles with a highly-constructed olive couture gown with an asymmetrical neckline. Theron ?blew everyone out of the water?, said longtime red carpet watcher Joan Rivers.

 Salma Hayek and Jennifer Lopez opted for Grecian-style draped dresses, with the diminutive Hayek in a turquoise Versace satin charmeuse. Lopez wore diamonds with a flowing gown with train in a yellowy shade of olive.

 Knightley, nominated for her role in Pride and Prejudice, sported a youthful ponytail with her deep currant-coloured Vera Wang one-shoulder gown accessorised with an elaborate vintage Bulgari necklace. Watts, a presenter for the evening, wore a ruffled one-shoulder Givenchy in a pale shade of nude. Presenter Nicole Kidman opted for a narrow silhouette in cream by Balenciaga, her long hair and narrow gown accentuating her height.

 Gathered bodices were seen on Hilary Swank and Jessica Alba, both in Versace, with Swank poured into a very tight dark draped gown and Alba opting for a gold embroidered dress.

 Most male stars, including George Clooney and Matt Dillon, opted for the classic black tuxedo, but Joaquin Phoenix rushed past the cameras clad in a steel blue suit, while Will Smith chose a blue pin-stripe.

 As expected, diamonds were everywhere ? on ears, necks, wrists and fingers. But perhaps the most original use of bling was by the team behind nominated song It?s Hard Out Here for a Pimp, from the movie Hustle amp; Flow. In sparkling mouthpieces, the performers wore diamonds covering their teeth.

 Country singer Dolly Parton, herself in diamonds, donned a pale pink gown with beaded waist by her longtime designer Robert Behar. With screams of ?Dolly!? from the crowds, she explained: ?I feel like a winner just being here with these folks.?

 Also stirring up the squealing crowd was heartthrob Clooney, who broke away from the red carpet briefly to sign autographs. ?Matt Dillon has no date tonight, right?? asked Clooney of reporters inquiring about his date for the evening. ?I brought Matt Dillon!?

 Pregnant nominee Rachel Weisz wore a black Empire-waisted Narcisso Rodriguez accented with tarnished silver chain. ?He (Rodriguez) made it loose in the belly,? Weisz laughed.

 Red-headed best supporting actress nominee Amy Adams chose a brown Carolina Herrera with a corset-style top, accented with blue stripes and deep pockets. Adams acknowledged that attending the Oscars was?overwhelming? but said that after the awards she planned to do something far more low-key ??Eat a burrito.?

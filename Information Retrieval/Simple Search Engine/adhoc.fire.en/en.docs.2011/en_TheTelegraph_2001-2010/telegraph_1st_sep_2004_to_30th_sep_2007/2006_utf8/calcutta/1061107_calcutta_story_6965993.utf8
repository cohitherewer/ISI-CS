The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Channel roll for cable eye

 - New 

 Ministry rule 

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 To curb film piracy and prevent adult films from being telecast, the information and broadcasting ministry has decided to make it mandatory to register all channels, including those beamed by the last-mile cable operators, once conditional access system (CAS) is introduced in January 2007.

 According to a senior official of the ministry, a clause to that effect has been introduced in the Cable Television Network Rules. A directive has been issued to multi-system operators (MSOs) prohibiting airing of channels not registered with the ministry, but it is yet to be circulated among all concerned, said the official.

 He added: The proposed order states that all channels that are aired by the MSOs need to be registered with the ministry, including regional cable channels and the channels administered by the local cable operators. We have been receiving complaints from the film industry alleging that the cable operators are involved in piracy.

 The official continued: It is obligatory for the channels to maintain recorded details of the programmes to be aired over the next 90 days. The records should be made accessible to the officials designated to monitor whether the channel is showing unauthorised programmes or not, as and when it is necessary. The order is set to be implemented with the introduction of CAS early next year.

 Veteran cable operator Mrinal Chatterjee observed: The new rule will make life difficult for a section of the city cable operators, but it is necessary to cleanse the system. It is common practice to show a film on cable channels within a day or two of its release. Airing of adult films late at night is also a custom with many operators. In fact, these films are shown on demand by the operators to expand their subscriber base.

 Gautam Biswas, a north Calcutta-based cable operator, stated that the directive, if implemented, would force many cable operators to wind up their channels. They are not full-fledged channels and should not come under the purview of the directive. Regional cable channels like ATN and CTVN can be brought under the scope of the rule, as their income is substantial, he argued.

 LETS 

 TALK ABOUT IT

 When some of the biggest names 

 in Calcuttas design brigade come face to face with 

 the most happening buyers of the region, with the Fashion 

 Design Council of India (FDCI) playing host to the meet, 

 the discussion obviously centres around fashion, fashion 

 and more fashion. At a designer-buyer meet organised by 

 the FDCI on Monday afternoon at The Other Room in Conclave, 

 the fraternity discussed some serious issues about the business 

 of fashion.

 Over the past three years 

 we have been organising such meets with designers in Mumbai 

 and Calcutta. But this is the first time we also invited 

 the buyers to come in so that we could get their perspectives. 

 We spoke about their views on the India Fashion Week (IFW), 

 the FDCI, and our other programmes, said Rathi Vinay 

 Jha, director general of FDCI, in town for the meet.

 In attendance were designer members 

 of FDCI like Anamika Khanna, Shantanu Goenka, Abhishek Dutta, 

 Suman Nathwani, Swapan and Seema Suhasaria among others. 

 The buyer brigade was represented by Espee, 85 Lansdowne, 

 Ekru, Little India, Earthy Myths and more (including one 

 from Bhubaneswar).

 While all those present appreciated 

 the role of FDCI as a catalyst in bringing designers 

 and buyers to the table, they also pointed out the need 

 to make the fashion week more professional. 

 Over the past two seasons we have put in a conscious 

 effort in this direction and we are trying to make the fashion 

 week more of a trade event, though shows will always be 

 there, said Jha.

 Many of the newer designers talked 

 about the need for manufacturing infrastructure support 

 to back them up. For this, we have to get them investors. 

 We can talk to corporate houses that provide manufacturing 

 support to designers as well as banking institutions, 

 observed Jha.

 The leading lady of FDCI also 

 announced a new feature of the forthcoming India Fashion 

 Week Autumn-Winter 2007 scheduled between March 21 and 25 

 in Delhi. A new show called High Five will showcase creations 

 of five new designers from the Preliminary Designer category 

 of FDCI.

 This category comprises 

 designers who are very new and are yet to make a name for 

 themselves. While usually these designers are allowed to 

 showcase from the stalls only, this is the first time they 

 will get to do a ramp show. A jury will choose the best 

 five, she added.

 In fact, Jha stressed the need 

 for more and more established designers to give up ramp 

 space and stick to the stalls, in order to make room for 

 emerging designers who need the platform to establish themselves.

 Ramp space at IFW is limited 

 and so it is not possible for us to accommodate all the 

 applicants. Established designers dont need the platform 

 to get business; that happens from the stalls equally well. 

 So, they should voluntarily give up doing shows, said 

 Jha, before quickly adding: But the attraction of 

 the ramp is hard to resist for anyone. All we can do is 

 ask them in very subtle ways.

 While the FDCI struggles to accommodate 

 as many designers as possible on the ramp from among 80 

 applicants, Jha is concerned about the low turnout from 

 Calcutta. We seriously need many more designers from 

 this city at the fashion week. Im sure there are talented 

 designers here, but somehow the number of applications from 

 the region is very low, she rued.

 About the much-talked-about couture 

 week in Mumbai, Jha revealed that the by-invitation-only 

 show will feature about 10-15 design biggies. We are 

 yet to finalise the dates, but it will be sometime at the 

 beginning of the festive season. It will only be a ramp 

 show, without any stalls, she signed off.

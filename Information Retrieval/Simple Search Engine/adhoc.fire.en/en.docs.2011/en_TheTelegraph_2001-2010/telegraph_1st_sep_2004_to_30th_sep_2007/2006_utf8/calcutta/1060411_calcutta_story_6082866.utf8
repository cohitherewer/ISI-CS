 Bypass acres for book fair

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government has asked the Indian Craft Village Trust to return its one-third share of land at the EM Bypass-Park Circus connector. 

 The trust had spent a crore on erecting a boundary wall and preparing the land, but the government needs to expand the trade fair complex to host the Calcutta Book Fair and other melas shifted out of the Maidan.

 Rajiv Gujral, managing trustee of Village Trust, said: ?We are highly disappointed with the government?s decision. This was entirely unexpected. It?s a 20-year-old project. We don?t know who is the third partner they want to bring in.?

 The 25-acre plot at the EM Bypass-Park Circus connector was initially leased out to the trust in 1994 by Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Later, only one-third of the land was allotted to the trust and the rest went to the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation for a trade fair complex. Now, the existing 18-acre plot is inadequate to host the fairs.

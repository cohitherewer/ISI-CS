The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bond, a special bond

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 10-day-long disability awareness film festival Look At Me, organised by Trinayani, a Calcutta-based trust, in various schools of the city came to an end on November 22. The festival aimed at accommodating the disabled in the mainstream.

 We knew the attack against barriers that separate the disabled from us had to be two-pronged, said Ritika Sahani, singer, activist and secretary of Trinayani. There is a need to prepare the disabled to be part of the mainstream. At the same time, we also need to sensitise the general public about these issues, to make social inclusion possible.

 The films screened included Colour of Paradise (by Majid Majidi), In the Land of the Deaf (by Nicholas Philibert), Colour of the Blind (by Chen Guoxing), Iqbal (by Nagesh Kukunoor), Anjali (by Mani Ratnam) and Chhoo Lengay Akash (by Virendra Saini).

 A major draw was the screening of the audio-described version of Munnabhai MBBS at Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society, in the presence of actor Boman Irani. Students of five blind schools and other regular schools watched the show.

 In the audio-described version, the silent parts in the movies are filled in with appropriate commentaries to ensure the continuity is not lost. This enables the visually-impaired to follow the dialogues, explained Sahani.

 A workshop was organised at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) to raise awareness among future film-makers about the need for proper portrayal of disability in a medium that reaches out to the masses. I am encouraged by the response I got from SRFTI and would like to take this idea further to cover the media schools in Calcutta, said Sahani.

 The festival generated great response with several schools wanting to host such screenings. Many students and teachers volunteered to work for the disabled after the event, added Sahani.

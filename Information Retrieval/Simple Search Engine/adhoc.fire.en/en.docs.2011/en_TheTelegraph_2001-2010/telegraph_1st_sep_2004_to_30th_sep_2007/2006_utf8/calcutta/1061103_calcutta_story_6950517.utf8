 Widowhood woes

 Providing a touching insight into the miserable, melancholy lives of widows of the 19th century, Kananpishir Japamala also attempts to explore the psyche of these unfortunate women, who were barred from leading normal, happy lives. Based on Kalyani Duttas compilation Pinjare Bashiya, the play begins in the present with two friends, Jhinuk and Tinni, who are alone at home after school, surfing the internet. Suddenly, when its connection gets severed, the girls, restless by nature, begin rummaging through old, discarded things that lay in a forgotten corner of Jhinuks house. They chance upon a string of prayer beads (japamala) and upon further investigation, learn that it belonged to her widowed grand-aunt, who lived in that house long ago. Their imagination stirred, the friends make further inquiries into the life of Kananpishi, prompting them to raise a number of questions on the condition of widows in the past. Direction: Suranjana Dasgupta.

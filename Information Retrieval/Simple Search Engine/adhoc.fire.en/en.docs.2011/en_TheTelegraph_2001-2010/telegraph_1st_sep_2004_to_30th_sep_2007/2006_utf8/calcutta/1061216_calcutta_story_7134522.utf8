 Job scam raids on

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will conduct more raids to get to the bottom of the alleged job scam at the Geological Survey of India (GSI). 

 About a fortnight ago, the CBIs anti-corruption wing carried out raids in the GSIs city units, including the organisations national headquarters on Chowringhee, and questioned staff members. The sleuths also seized documents.

 According to a CBI official, the probe has been intensified to find out the root of the corruption. He said: We have started a case. More raids will be conducted and some big fish may fall into our net.

 The alleged malpractice came to light recently after 10 draftsmen and laboratory assistants were found to have been recruited on the basis of forged documents. 

 The men had not cleared their Class X board examinations. 

 The recruitment could not have been possible without the involvement of the GSI top brass, stated the official. 

 The appointment of GSI director-general P.M. Tejale is also under cloud. He might be removed from the post in a couple of days. 

 In 2005, Tejale was appointed director-general, replacing acting director-general Mrinal Mukherjee, who had been appointed in October 2004, after K.N. Mathur retired.

 Mukherjee moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), alleging that Tejales recruitment was in violation of rules. 

 The CAT then directed the mines ministry to remove Tejale immediately. A month after his removal, Tejale was given a promotion and again appointed director-general of the GSI, said former deputy director-general Shankar Majumdar.

 The court asked the ministry to reinstate Mukherjee to the director-generals post. The ministry, however, did not do so. For which, it had to even face a contempt charge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On the run 

Stage On amp; Off

 Barasat Anushilani is a familiar name now on the city?s theatre circuit, staging new plays with regularity.

 Its latest venture, Chhut, 

 spans so many issues, though, that viewers are liable to 

 stagger out wondering what hit them. Social welfare, club 

 rivalries, media hype, communal strife, extramarital relations, 

 children?s rights ? only after the interval do we realise 

 that the very last-named constitutes the real theme. And 

 once that dawns on us, so does the natural reaction to question 

 why we had to sit through much of the first half.

 Taking his cue from the topical incident of Budhia, dramatist-director Ramaprasad Banik sets up a similar situation where a local philanthropist organises a run from this side of the border into Bangladesh by a poor Muslim boy, so as to gain publicity in his continuing one-upmanship with another para club. Such a story can hardly get off the blocks, because after what happened with Budhia, which dunderhead would attempt so risky a stunt again?

 An imposing Rudratej Sengupta nevertheless gives a credible portrayal of this megalomaniac. Each member of the huge cast of 25 (one of Anushilani?s strengths) contributes his or her mite. 

 But my advice to them is what I tell other promising Bengali groups outside Calcutta, echoing what Bernard Shaw told Jamaicans in 1911: ?Do your own acting and write your own plays.? And direct them too.

 For if they have to find or cultivate 

 an independent niche, they must not depend on Calcutta-based 

 stars beyond their first few productions. If they do, they 

 will only catch our theatre?s bad habits, while suppressing 

 their original voice: the exact problem that hegemonic globalisation 

 creates, except on a local scale.

 The premiere this weekend of Love 

 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the new Cirque du Soleil show 

 set to the music of the Beatles, not only offered the closest 

 thing possible to a Fab Four reunion, but it also prompted 

 a gathering of Beatle families, friends and associates that 

 may never be repeated.

 A chummy-looking Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr were joined at the Mirage Hotel by the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison ? Yoko Ono (wearing an all-white outfit and an enormous white hat) and Olivia Harrison ? along with Harrison?s son Dhani, and Lennon?s first wife, Cynthia, and son Julian.

 Love is the first time the Beatles organisation Apple, which is extremely protective of the band?s music, has licensed songs for a theatrical production. The idea grew out of a friendship between George Harrison and Guy Lalibert?, Cirque du Soleil?s founder. 

 Since the two companies reached an agreement three years ago, the Beatles? producer George Martin and his son Giles have been assembling a score that stitches together segments from more than 100 Beatles songs, taken from the original master tapes and remixed for souped-up surround sound. The theatre at the Mirage was rebuilt from scratch for the show, at a reported cost of more than $100 million, including installation of more than 6,000 speakers.

 The 2,000 invited guests included many stars with Beatles ties (Ravi Shankar, Eric Idle, Jeff Lynne), various rock luminaries (Brian Wilson, Deborah Harry, Steven Van Zandt) and celebrity Beatles fans (Billy Crystal, Paul Reiser, Lauren Hutton).

 Cirque du Soleil?s multimedia extravaganzas don?t usually have to compete for an audience?s attention, but on Friday it was easy to be diverted from the stage by the sight of McCartney nodding attentively to his own vocal on Hey Jude or Starr air-drumming along with his part on Tomorrow Never Knows. At the Far Eastern-theme party after the performance, the two surviving Beatles huddled on a sofa, talking quietly. They were joined for a while by Ravi Shankar, 86, who was greeted with a big hug by McCartney.

 Later, McCartney, Starr and others 

 took a victory lap around the stage. McCartney called out 

 to the crowd: ?Just one special round of applause for John 

 and George.? For this night the band?s history of litigation, 

 squabbling and sniping was forgotten.

 The City Diary

 A 30-year-old housewife, Alpana Hazra, died on Sunday morning, reportedly after consuming poison. Police, however, are not sure whether the death was a suicide or murder.

 lpana, a resident of Behala, was taken to the nearby Vidyasagar Hospital on Saturday night after husband Dilip, who owns a cloth shop in the locality, found her frothing at the mouth and groaning in pain. The couple was married three years ago but had no children.

 olice are looking at the case from two angles. Dilip had bought a house for Rs 7 lakh, of which Rs 2 lakh had been taken from a friend as loan. The relation between the Hazras got strained over repayment of the loan. ?Alpana insisted that Dilip repay the loan, but he refused,? an officer said.

 he other angle is that Alpana had an affair with a local youth. ?Apparently, Dilip came to know about it a few days ago and picked a quarrel with his wife,? the officer added. The youth has been held for interrogation. 

 Nothing can be said for sure right now. We are waiting for the post-mortem report,? declared an investigating officer.

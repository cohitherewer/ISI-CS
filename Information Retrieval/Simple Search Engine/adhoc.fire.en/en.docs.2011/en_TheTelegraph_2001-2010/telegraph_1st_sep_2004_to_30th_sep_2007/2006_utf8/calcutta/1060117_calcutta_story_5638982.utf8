 Bias tag on green guard 

 TAPAS GHOSH

 Wanted: guidelines for the guardian of the city?s most precious patch of green.

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta on Monday filed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding the green bench?s intervention in guiding the army about how to play custodian of the Maidan.

 The petitioner has alleged that the army follows a dual policy in allowing political parties to hold fairs and rallies on the Maidan.

 Dutta, who moved the first PIL on the upkeep of the Maidan in 2003, said he had sought a high court guideline for the army regarding use of the Maidan by political parties and other organisations.

 According to the green activist, the army?s role in maintaining the Maidan is not satisfactory. ?The custodian of the Maidan is itself violating the norms laid down by the court,? he stated.

 Dutta alleged that the army has been discriminatory in granting permission to the organisers of events and rallies on the Maidan, thereby creating confusion.

 ?The army is allowing political parties to hold fairs on the Maidan if the state government is seeking approval on their behalf. This should not be done. There should be a uniform policy, ? he said.

 ?Due to political reasons, the army does not want a tussle with the state government and has been surrendering before it,? he added.

 Dutta also stressed how garden-keepers are being allowed to burn leaves on the grounds even though an expert committee of the high court had directed the military not to allow burning of leaves on the Maidan.

 Harping on the dual-policy issue, Dutta said: ?Many organisations have been prevented from collecting an entry fee for accessing areas beautified by them. But one industrial house has been allowed permission??

 Dutta called for the court to decide who is responsible for cleaning up the Maidan and to set up an expert committee to monitor the army?s maintenance of the grounds. The custodians of the greens must keep it free of encroachment, Dutta stressed.

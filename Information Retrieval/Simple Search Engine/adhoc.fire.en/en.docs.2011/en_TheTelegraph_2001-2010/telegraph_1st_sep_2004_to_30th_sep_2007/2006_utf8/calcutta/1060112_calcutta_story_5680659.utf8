 Learn your biz, learn your birdie

 - B-school starts postgraduate course in golf, country club management

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 The Japanese, they say, don?t do business where there is no golf course. That could be stretching it a bit, but there?s no doubt that knowing your birdie from your eagle makes good business sense. No wonder a B-school in town is ready to tee-off a trendy, sporty management course.

 International School of Business, in Sector V, is starting a one-year postgraduate course in golf and country club management from June 2006. 

 What is being touted as ?the first such course in India? will see students covering topics such as contemporary golf and resort development, environmental management of golf facilities, golf and country club operations management, strategic management, quality and customer services and finance for the service industry.

 ?Our students will undergo internships in golf clubs, under the watchful eyes of the city?s premier golfing institutions, such as Royal Calcutta Golf Club and Tollygunge Club. We will also use our 30,000 sq ft of open space for this purpose,? says Suborno Bose, chairman, International Group.

 With golf being billed as the fastest-growing game in India, the maintenance and management of golf and country clubs have come into sharp focus, creating a definite market and demand for professionals.

 Brandon D? Souza, president of Tiger Sports Marketing, has no doubt about the demand, but adds a note of caution about the curriculum. ?There are a lot of opportunities in India for a course like this, but maybe not much scope in Calcutta right now? With the surfeit of golf courses coming up all over India, especially in the north, professional management is definitely needed, but it needs to be carefully structured, since it is such a niche course.?

 Value additions to the new course include a trip to the birthplace of golf ? Scotland ? where students will have a chance to undergo training at the Queen Margaret University College (QMUC) in Edinburgh. 

 The institute has also tied up with Ian Buick, the first to start an MBA in golf management in the UK, and Ron Scott, faculty member of QMUC?s golf management course.

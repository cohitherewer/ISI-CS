 Face rising 

 sun to stir it right 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Facing the east while cooking is considered 

 to be the best position. In this manner, the food that 

 is cooked taps and absorbs the nourishing energy of 

 the rising sun and makes it wholesome and nutritious. 

 If you cannot rearrange the cooking stove, create an 

 illusion of the beneficial energy of the rising sun 

 by placing its picture on the southern wall

Q: 

 My kitchen faces the south and 

 it has windows facing the east. I have to cook facing the 

 south and to the east there is the sink. I have heard that 

 its not advisable to cook facing the south, but I 

 have no alternative. Please suggest a remedy.

 THE SOLUTION: Facing the east while cooking is considered to be the best position as per Feng Shui. 

 In this manner, the food that is cooked taps and absorbs the nourishing energy of the rising sun and makes it exceptionally wholesome and nutritious. 

 If you have no way of rearranging the cooking stove, create an illusion of the beneficial energy of the rising sun by placing its picture on the southern wall.

 Mind matter 

 Q: 

 Our son was born on 20.12.1990 at 11.46 

 am. He will be appearing for his Higher Secondary examinations 

 in March 2007. He lacks concentration and we have to force 

 him to study. His study table is in the north-east corner 

 and he faces east while studying. His computer table is 

 in the south-west corner. He also suffers from skin allergy 

 and wakes up very late in the morning. Please advise.

 Farah Hafiz

 THE SOLUTION: The pillars of destiny of your son reveal that he is a strong earth person. This element was further aggravated in the last 10 years as he was continually under its influence. The earth element is cold by nature and makes a person lethargic.

 This year he has stepped into the favourable metal element, which represents his mind. This will bring his hidden talent, potential and skill into the limelight. This period will strengthen his metal element, which will help improve his skin allergies.

 He should study facing his auspicious 

 directions, either north or east. Do not let him work on 

 the computer facing south-west. 

 Toilet trouble 

 Q: 

 I am residing in a rented flat 

 where there are bathrooms in the south-east and north-east. 

 I have not been able to prosper in life and am also having 

 problems with my kids. My date of birth is 24.01.1949. Please 

 suggest a remedy.

 Ajay Kumar Agarwalla

 THE SOLUTION: Extreme corners of the house are considered enormously powerful according to Feng Shui and should never have toilets. The best remedy would be to place a straight growing plant in a green plate with pebbles around on the windowsill of the south-east bathroom. This will help lift the energy upwards, which would otherwise get drained through the drainage system. 

 A similar arrangement can be done 

 in the north-east toilet as well. Both the toilets can have 

 full-length mirrors placed on the outside of the door panels. 

 This will create an illusion of the toilets not existing 

 in such vital areas.

 Wed woes

 Q: 

 My sisters date of birth is January 21, 1976. 

 My parents have been desperately trying for a matrimonial 

 alliance for her. Several proposals have come but something 

 or the other stops them from materialising. Could you please 

 suggest what to do?

 H.S.

 THE SOLUTION: Firstly, check that the south-west area of your house is intact. This sector has great importance in Feng Shui as it is associated with earth energy, which is considered to be feminine in nature. Hence the south-west part of the house is directly connected with the happiness of the females living there and it blesses them with marital bliss. 

 Missing south-west in the house could be one reason for your sister still being single. You can remedy it with a strong light that is focused on the missing corner if you find it cut.

 According to her pillars of destiny, this year she has come under the influence of strong fire and earth elements. Fire strengthens the earth element, which represents marriage for her. 

 She being a weak water person can easily be captured by the earth element this year. So do not miss the chance this year and shift her to the north-west room of the house and surround her with earthy colours. 

 Energise the south-west corner of the house and her bedroom with photographs of couples or anything that suggests a twosome. You can also enhance her personal marriage direction ? west ? with a couples statue in metal.

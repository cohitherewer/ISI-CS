 Mahima Chaudhary

 You prefer to make your way alone, working happily at a job that allows you freedom, rather than confining routine. You are generous with your affection and invest a lot in relationships. You feel that peoples shortcomings are not as important as their strengths. You enjoy hobbies that engage your mind. Kusum Bhandari

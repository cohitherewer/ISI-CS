 Illness at kidnap recall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Parthapratim Roy Burman of Khadims appeared before the special court in Alipore Central jail on Friday to recount his abduction in 2001.

 However, after providing a detailed account of how his car was intercepted in Tiljala, Roy Burman told the judge he was feeling unwell. The hearing was then adjourned till November 28.

 Roy Burman, in a red-and-white striped shirt, came to the special court around 1.45 pm. It took him 45 minutes to record the statement.

 Roy Burman was abducted on July 25, 2001, from Tiljalas CN Roy Road, allegedly by the aides of Aftab Ansari, a Dubai-based crimelord convicted in the American Center attack case. He returned home after a week.

 Recalling the incident in front of Ansari and the other accused, Roy Burman said he was on his way to his Tiljala factory when his car was intercepted. A few people opened the door and I heard a thud... They dragged me to another car and I saw blood oozing from my hand, public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh quoted Roy Burman as having said.

 The Khadims man said he had been forced to wear dark glasses instead of his spectacles. So, he did not see where he was being taken. Then, he was forced to have a soft drink. After that, he fell unconscious. When he came around, he found himself in a dark room, said Ghosh.

 Youths in van flee with girl 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Priyanka Ghosh, a Class VII student, was abducted by a group of youths on her way back home from school on Monday afternoon at Chaitanyanagar, in Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city. 

 Later, angry neighbours gheraoed Barasat police station, demanding immediate rescue of the girl and arrest of the culprits.

 ?I was returning home with my daughter from her school after her life science examination. Close to my house, some youths in a Maruti van bundled my daughter into the vehicle and sped off before I could even raise an alarm,? recounted Sujata, Priyanka?s mother. The vehicle proceeded towards Bongaon.

 According to Sujata, while two youths forcibly took away Priyanka, three others were sitting inside the vehicle. 

 ?The youths sitting inside urged the two to grab my daughter, who was then screaming for help. As I tried to resist, I was pushed and I fell into a drain beside the road,? said a sobbing Sujata.

 She raised an alarm and went home, barely 500 ft away from the spot where the abduction took place. Some local youths informed Barasat police station about the kidnapping. 

 Priyanka?s father Tapas Ghosh, who runs a transport business, also went to the police station and lodged a complaint. He said one of the abductors had been identified.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boy, can she cook! 

 - Spiral in number of girls opting to be chefs at hotel management schools

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Gouri Basu is 23, pretty and smart. She could have bagged the job of a front-desk executive in a five-star-hotel with her eyes closed. Instead, she is exercising her wrists in the kitchen of a hotel management institute in Salt Lake. 

 Gouri is not alone. She is part of a growing breed of women opting for food production courses in the hotel management institutes across the city. 

 ?Thirty per cent of the girls joining hotel management institutes are specialising in food production. The figure has gone up considerably in the past few years,? says Amitabh Kumar Sen, chef-instructor at the Institute of Hotel Management, Catering and Applied Management in Taratala. 

 ?Earlier, the women used to concentrate only on front-desk jobs or managerial positions, depending on their aptitude. Those who wanted to be a chef were discouraged by friends and family,? he adds.

 Sen attributes the trend to the changing kitchen environment. ?Most of the staff members in a hotel kitchen are now from hotel management institutes. They respect each other and their work, irrespective of sex. The mutual appreciation was missing earlier. Women were considered outsiders,? he says. 

 The advent of the interactive kitchen is another factor that has prompted the girls to don the whites. Such facilities allow them to show off their superior people skills, compared to men, along with their culinary expertise, feel many female chefs in the making. 

 The hotels are welcoming the trend, and for sound reasons. 

 ?The impact of a woman chef is different. The guests are more courteous and in most cases, pay a repeat visit,? states Mukul Sarkar, chef-instructor at the Institute of Advanced Management, Salt Lake. 

 The success stories are not hard to come by, either. ?When I joined a hotel management institute, I had a choice of departments. I became a chef because I thought my abilities were best suited to the kitchen,? reveals Suniti Mittal, in-charge of West View Bar and Grill at ITC Sonar Bangla. 

 ?My job gives me the opportunity to do new things every day. A decade down the line, I know I will experimenting with cuisine,? she explains.

 Women are still at the helm in most home kitchens; then why were they lukewarm to cooking at hotel kitchens for so long? 

 Mittal offers: ?Rustling up something for five people at home and being on your toes in a restaurant for almost 14 hours a day are two different things. Due to their physical limitations, women were not comfortable doing this work.? 

 She adds: ?Things have become easier with advances in technology. Moreover, several star hotels are coming up with multiple dining options, boosting the job-generation potential of food production.? 

 Those waiting to cash in are determined to overcome the odds. ?When I enter the kitchen, I remember I am a chef and forget everything else,? Saraswati Acharya, studying at the Taratala institute, has the final word.

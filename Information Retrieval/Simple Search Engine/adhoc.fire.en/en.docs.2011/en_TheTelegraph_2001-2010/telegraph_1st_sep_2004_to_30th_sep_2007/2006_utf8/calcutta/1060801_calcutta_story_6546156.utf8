The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Out-of-jail solution plan

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 In a bid to lessen the burden on overcrowded jails, the state correctional services department has proposed to the judicial department that cases related to petty offences be sorted out outside the jails.

 The proposal was sent by B.D. Sharma, inspector-general of correctional services department. 

 It suggests ways to address the problems faced by people accused of petty offences, like free-tripping on trains, creating a ruckus on the street or violating traffic rules.

 ?I don?t think it is fair to detain people for two-three days, or even more, for petty offences,? Sharma told Metro on Monday.

 At present, any person detained for these offences is sent to jail on the basis of a court order. But it takes at least two-three days for the court to order the release of the accused. The release may get further delayed if an accused is sent to jail on Friday, because the court remains closed over the weekend.

 Again, there are cases in which petty offenders cannot afford to pay the fine imposed on them by the court. In such situations, they remain in jail till a voluntary organisation comes to their rescue.

 ?Apart from the usual delays, there are also instances of people having to dish out money to court clerks for a copy of the release order,? added Sharma.

 Under the proposed system, officials said, a special court will be set up in jails, where a judicial magistrate can dispose of petty cases based on their merit.

 ?It will, however, depend on the judicial magistrate whether an offender will be released after realising a spot fine from him or he will be sent to jail to serve a sentence,? said additional inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya. ?The jail superintendent?s job will be to put up the cases before the magistrate.?

 The system has already been introduced in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, where people detained for petty offences are released from jails. ?I don?t know why we are lagging behind when other states have implemented the system. It will also save government money,? Sharma said.

 A judicial department official said the proposal is being considered at the highest level.

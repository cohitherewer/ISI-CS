 Labouring with dignity

 Swayam and The Seagull Foundation for the Arts host Visible Work, Invisible Women, an exhibition of photographs by journalist P. Sainath. Specially scheduled to coincide with the ongoing international campaign protesting violence against women, it consists of about 70 black-and-white photographs on women labourers of rural India. The pictures, shot in the poorest regions of 10 states across the country, show the astonishing labour that poor, village women put in everyday and the gigantic yet unacknowledged contribution they make to the national economy. Instead of cliched photographs depicting abject poverty, the images on show are of enormous strength and dignity. Truly representative of the overwhelming majority of the poor, who seek employment and opportunity rather than pity or charity, they place womens labour at the centre of the rural Indian familys survival strategies.

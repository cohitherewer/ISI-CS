The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Weekend pilfer at waterworks office 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) officials are clueless about the theft of gadgets, worth at least Rs 8 lakh, from a store in the administrative building of Garden Reach Waterworks (Phase II), in Rabindranagar.

 The almirahs in the room were also broken and important documents taken away.

 An FIR has been lodged with Rabindranagar police station. The theft was detected on January 24 and officials believe it took place sometime between January 21 and 23.

 The administrative building was closed on all three days but the water treatment plant, on the same compound, was run as an emergency measure. 

 A section of officials feels the burglars could not have gained access to the building without the involvement of insiders.

 Officers of Rabindranagar police station said the gadgets were stored on the first floor of the building. The burglars might have entered the building through the shaft of an exhaust fan.

 According to an initial estimate, the burglars have taken away a few hundred water meters, brass bearings and other gadgets. 

 Executive engineer in charge of operations and maintenance of the plant Indrajit Sen said the exact worth of the booty was yet to be ascertained. ?We are calculating the loss. Right now, we cannot say whether any insider was involved.?

 CMDA officer on special duty Abhijit Banerjee wondered how the gadgets could be stolen despite the round-the-clock presence of guards on the premises. ?Guards both from our organisation and a private agency man the compound. I have asked the security officer to make a thorough inquiry and submit a report,? he added.

 Pran Bandhu Nag, general secretary of the Development Employees Joint Action Committee, pointed out: ?Entry is restricted in Phases I and II. Without help from insiders, no one can enter these areas.?

 The two units, he added, supply 60 million gallons of water to the residents of the city and its adjoining areas.

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said sleuths were working on some ?crucial clues? and hoped that the culprits would be arrested soon.

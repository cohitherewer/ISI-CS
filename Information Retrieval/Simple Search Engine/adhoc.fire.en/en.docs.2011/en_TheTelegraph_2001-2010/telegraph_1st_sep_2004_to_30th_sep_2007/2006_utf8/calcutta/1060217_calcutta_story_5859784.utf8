 The foreign femme factor

 Sameera?s ?Bong connection? with Brick Lane, Shilpa?s exotic appeal beyond borders

 Sameera Reddy and 

 (below) Shilpa Shetty: Hollywood ho! 

 She may not particularly like it, but there?s more than just a dash of Ash on the foreign screen. From her Chaos announcement to her Bond with the best, Aishwarya Rai has smartly positioned herself as the global beauty from this part of the world. So what if the projects never happened, the former Miss World danced her way through Gurinder Chadha?s Bride amp; Prejudice and then became the Mistress of Spices in Chadha?s husband Paul Mayeda Berges?s adaptation of Chitra Divakaruni?s novel.

 Then came the biggie: The Last Legion co-starring Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley, where she played Mira, a Byzantine warrior. And there?s more on the cards for Ash, with Roland Joffe?s Singularity and Racing The Monsoon opposite Michael Douglas.

 But, but, but? Ash is not the only one. There was Mallika Sherawat with a nine-minute cameo in Jackie Chan?s The Myth, and now, more Bollywood beauties are charming their way into foreign projects.

 I am Sam

 Sameera Reddy has been approached to play the Bangladeshi protagonist Nazneen in a British adaptation of Monica Ali?s best-selling novel Brick Lane. ?The makers saw me in Buddhada?s (Buddhadeb Dasgupta) Kaalpurush and offered me the role which is totally author-backed about this woman who struggles her way out of social and personal problems,? the actress tells Metro.

 Brick Lane will be directed by Sarah Gavron, the maker of small films like Losing Touch and This Little Life. It will be produced by Alison Owen of Ruby Films who is adapting other literary works like Zadie Smith?s Oh Beauty. The script adaptation of the book has been done by Abi Morgan, who penned films like Life Isn?t All Ha Ha Hee Hee and Sex Traffic, and Laura Jones, who scripted the Gwyneth Paltrow-starrer Possession.

 Unlike Ash, who?s given many Bollywood projects a miss for a foothold in Hollywood, Sameera isn?t sure whether she will be able to do Brick Lane. ?The producers want 45 days at a stretch in the next couple of months but I have committed to so many projects here in Mumbai. The Brick Lane offer has come at a time when my hands are full. So, even though I would love to do the film, there?s no use talking about it until I sign the movie...?

 Babel babe

 Goodbye Govinda; hello Brad Pitt! Shilpa Shetty is set to appear with Hollywood?s hottest hunk in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu?s Babel. Inarritu had earlier directed the Oscar-nominated Amores Perros (Love?s A Bitch) and then followed it up with 21 Grams, starring Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro.

 Babel, which also stars Cate Blanchett and Mexican star Gael Garcia Bernal, is about the lives of four separate groups of strangers in three different continents. It has been co-written by Inarritu and his long-time writing collaborator Guillermo Arriaga.

 Shilpa is said to be playing the role of an Indian girl Sameera Bakshi, who is on vacation with her family, including sister Sonia, to be played by Mahima Chaudhury.

 That?s not all. Shilpa is also slated to do Joe?s Last Chance, directed by Andrew Bergman, who had earlier made the Demi Moore-starrer Striptease. The film is about a hitman who has to choose between love and duty with time running out. Currently in pre-production stage, Joe?s Last Chance should have Shilpa sharing screen space with Audrey Tatou of Amelie fame. As with most American productions, Shilpa is not allowed to talk about the two projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Space surge, take-off time

 Rajarhat township

 Realty Ride

 If the real-estate boom reached a different level in 2005, with big players coming in or poised to come in, 2006 should see the first phase of concrete development that changes the way the city lives.

 At least three major large-format housing projects are on track for completion. Sherwood Estate in Narendrapur, being developed by the consortium of PS Group, Heritage Group and Srijan Group, will hand over the keys to its 1,200 apartments in February-March. 

 Apart from an in-house medical centre and ambulance on call, another unique feature of this mammoth complex will be lessons for residents in various fields ? from foreign languages to yoga and performing arts.

 Westwind, the signature project of Keventer?s Group in Bagha Jatin, will also see residents moving in. It is the first project in eastern India to obtain the ISO 14001 certification, which helps organisations to better manage the impact of their activities on the environment and to demonstrate sound environmental management.

 Silver Spring on EM Bypass, next to ITC Sonar Bangla, promises to be ready by April-May. The 500-apartment premium housing complex, a venture of SpringField Projects Pvt Ltd, will also have a giant club and an 80,000-sq-ft retail block, Silver Arcade. The G+3 structure will house supermarkets, departmental stores, a food court and speciality restaurants.

 And above all, there is the Rs 2,500 crore Kolkata West International City in Howrah. Work on the integrated satellite township being developed by the consortium of the Salim, Ciputra and Universal Success groups, has kicked off, and the buzz in the long-neglected belt across the river is growing louder by the day.

 The unique, largely horizontal township, comprising 6,100 individual bungalows plus all the allied infrastructure, promises to raise the realty bar, bring in the global township experience with a clutch of best practices, and cause a mini revolution on the west bank.

 New Town, Rajarhat, too will see a flurry of activity in 2006, with many residential and IT projects kicking off construction. This includes three new joint-venture projects flagged off last year in Action Area II.

 Work on Unitech?s 100-acre residential development and Hidco?s 20,000-unit giant mass housing project will also commence.

 Then there?s the tendering process for the Dankuni development, in Hooghly district. A 5,010-acre project, the proposed Dankuni satellite township will also have a 1,000-acre industrial hub, along with all the ingredients of a modern self-sufficient township ? housing, education and entertainment facilities.

 The sprawling satellite township will be just about 30 minutes from the airport, once the new bridge and the connecting expressway are completed. The area would accommodate about 1.5 million people and is expected to be partially completed by 2011.

 And it?s not just residential projects picking up pace this year. Commercial projects such as software technology parks are coming up by the dozens. International project developers like Ascendas and Unitech have already started construction.

 In the next 30 months, almost 14 million sq ft will be added to the current IT workspace arena of 2.5 million sq ft. Where is the demand, ask the sceptics. Developers are quietly confident that the ?industrial resurgence?, steered by a chief minister desperate to boost business in Bengal, will ensure that the demand for quality workspace does not flag.

 While DLF?s IT park across 25 acres will be inaugurated, work on all other IT parks in New Town and Salt Lake Sector V, including Technopolis, The Hub, Infinity II, Globsyn Crystals and Unitech?s 25-acre IT park, will shift gears.

 With close to 14 IT parks in various stages of construction slated to come up in the next 30 months, real estate developers are already drawing up their next project plans.

 Retail Raj

 If there?s anything that can ride the realty bandwagon, it is the retail boom. If 2005 was marked by the coming of big shops and cine stops, 2006 will see their coming of age.

 The South City Mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road, with its one million sq ft of retail and entertainment space ? double of City Centre ? will easily be the piece de resistance in the city?s retail matrix.

 Set to be unveiled before Puja 2006, eastern India?s largest destination mall will have four anchors ? Pantaloons, Shoppers? Stop, Spencer?s Hypermarket and Fame Cinemas, with its six-screen multiplex.

 Top international brands like Marks amp; Spencer, Guess and Next will share rack space with the Benettons and Adidas?s, while Landmark opens its second store at the mall. There will be parking for 1,400 vehicles across six levels with direct walk-in access.

 The Rs 300-crore South City Mall, designed by South African retail space specialists Bentel, based on the overall concept design by local architect Dulal Mukherjee, will have a 20,000-sq-ft food court and speciality restaurants, and a 9,000-sq-ft central atrium.

 Back on the Bypass, Mani Square will be the other big-format mall opening its doors in 2006. Spencer?s Hypermarket (45,000 sq ft) and Westside (30,000 sq ft) are the two anchors signed on till now, apart from the city?s first IMAX theatre seating around 700 and a three-screen multiplex by Adlabs seating 1,030.

 The 600,000 sq ft development will have parking space for 800 cars, 100,000 sq ft of IT and commercial space and a 25,000 sq ft food court.

 Also set to be unveiled around the Pujas is the Lake Mall, the first major instance of the city?s civic body collaborating with a private partner to provide a proper shopping and lifestyle experience by redeveloping an existing municipal market, the Lake Market.

 Promoted by Venkatesh Foundation Pvt Ltd in a joint venture with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the first three floors of the new-age 200,000-sq-ft G+6 mall will house mega tores, superstores and hypermarkets. The fourth floor will house the food court with open terraces, besides entertainment plazas and virtual reality game stations.

 The fifth and sixth levels will be taken up by the four-screen multiplex. There will be parking for 265 cars.

 On Elgin Road, where the mall mania began, Forum will add another 50,000 sq ft of retail space over three levels in an adjacent block. Work will commence in 2006 and the new block is set to be ready by June 2007.

 The annexe will hold a supermarket, a bookstore and high-profile international brands. It will also accommodate a fully computerised multi-layered car park to add another 550 slots to the existing 200, at a cost of Rs 15 crore.

 Plans for the Kolkata West township

 If first-mover Forum is in growth mode, so is City Centre. The Salt Lake mall that emerged as the biggest hangout around, will launch the family entertainment centre across 6,000 sq ft, being done by Time Zone.

 Closer to the city centre, Avani Galleria is the first ladies? mall coming up at 91A/1 Park Street, diagonally opposite St Xavier?s College. The directors of the mall hope to complete the construction and interiors of the mall by the end of 2006. 

 ?The mall is spread over 1.25 lakh sq ft, with G+7 and basement parking. The product mix would range from accessories to garments. The objective is to create a one-stop shopping solution for women,? says Vimal Goel, director, Bengal Avani Projects Ltd, which is building the mall. ?Concept malls are a rage in the West. Avani Galleria would be the first concept mall in Calcutta catering to women.?

 Travel Trend

 The travel industry really soared last year. Malaysia Airlines, Jetstar Asia, Air Deccan, Kingfisher, SpiceJet and other airlines landed at Calcutta airport, while Singapore Airlines, Air India, Indian Airlines ? now Indian ? and more added destinations and flights. And, of course, prices went through the floor, causing airlines to bleed and passengers to be buoyant.

 According to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Lufthansa would start flight services from the city to Frankfurt and Munich, while another American airline will have direct Calcutta-New York services ? both in 2006.

 Blueprint of Avani Galleria

 Emirates, the national airline of United Arab Emirates, has decided to launch its city operations from April 1, 2006. According to sources, Emirates will fly from Calcutta to Dubai six days a week. 

 Around ?five to six big and small domestic carriers? also have Calcutta on their radar, with talk of other international airlines entering the market as well.

 But the industry forecast for 2006 is a relative ?slow-down?, beginning with the Royal Jordanian pullout. Malaysia Airlines has already reduced its number of seats, by replacing its 270-seater aircraft with a 160-seater. 

 According to sources, the Air India London flights aren?t doing too well either. Other Southeast Asian carriers like Singapore Airlines have also had to deal with a drop in passenger numbers in off-peak seasons.

 Although the predicted growth is 15-20 per cent in the domestic and international travel sectors in Calcutta, the news for the new year is a ?reversal of sorts, compared to the optimism of last year?, according to Manoj Saraf, managing director, Gainwell Travels. ?The capacity of last year has become difficult to sustain for the airlines, with good traffic only four months a year.?

 Forum: bigger and better in 2006

 The most significant development awaiting those flying out of ? or into ? Calcutta this year will be the addition of four new bays to the existing 24. According to airport director V.K. Monga, 12 new passenger counters will also be commissioned to tackle the rush.

 The first phase of the state-of-the-art cargo terminal will be commissioned by June 2006. A key to the airport?s projected turnaround, it will also boost the floriculture trade, a thrust area of the state government. The new complex, covering 20,000 sq m, will have the capacity to handle 40,000 tonnes of cargo.

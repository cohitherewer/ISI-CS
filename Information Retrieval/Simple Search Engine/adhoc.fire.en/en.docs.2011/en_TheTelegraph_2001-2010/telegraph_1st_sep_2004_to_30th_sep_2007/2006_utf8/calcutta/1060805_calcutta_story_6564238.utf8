The exhibition will be held at the Taj Bengal till Monday, August 7.

 We cant take the drama out of an Indian wedding. We thought lets just take the stress out, smiles Tarun Sarda, CEO of Vivaha Interactive. And with that as the motto, the exhibition offers one-stop shopping and management solutions for the great Indian wedding.

 A total of 53 labels are vying for potential customer attention over the four days. This includes quite a few city participants like Avinandan Fashions, Ekru Alluring Designs, Bandhej, Rajkriti, Krishnkali, Akriti Creations, Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons, Arham Jewellers, Traditions, PKS Jewellers, SKP Securities Ltd, Swapnil and Mobel furniture.

 The other biggies from across the country are Dar-e-aab by Sonia Mahajan, Movado, Baume amp; Mercier, Talent Inc. among many more.

 Having hand-picked some of Calcuttas finest and showcased them in most of their Delhi exhibitions, Tarun acknowledged that Calcuttas changing spending pattern has led to the growth of the vibrant wedding market.

 Malls have played a great role and so has the increase in disposable incomes of Calcuttans. We are planning to make Vivaha an annual show in Calcutta, he added. 

 Many of the Calcutta-based labels like Avinandan Fashions, Diagold, Vasundhara Mantri and Rupahali will also participate in the Dubai chapter of Celebrating Vivaha 2006 to be held in October.

 Interestingly, children below 15 years are not allowed inside the exhibition. Reasons? Cranky kids get mothers cranky, eliminating real shopping altogether. Moreover, who wants to handle chocolate stains on bridal finery? offered a spokesperson.

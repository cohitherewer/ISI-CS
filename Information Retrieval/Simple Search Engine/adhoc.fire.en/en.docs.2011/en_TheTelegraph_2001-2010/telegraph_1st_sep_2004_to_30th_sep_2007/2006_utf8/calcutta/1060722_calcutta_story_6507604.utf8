 Rain havoc on prices

 - SUPPLY DWINDLES

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The rains over the past few days have sent the prices of essential items, like vegetables and fish, soaring across the city.

 Supply has been erratic, as the rains have flooded farms and severed road or rail links with several pockets in the state. ?Though the supply has drastically come down, the demand remains the same. So, prices are bound to rise,? said Naru Samaddar, a vegetable vendor at Lansdowne market.

 Among vegetables, the prices of 

 parwal, lady?s finger, brinjal, green gourd (jhinga), 

 bitter gourd (karela) and green chillies have shot 

 up. Most of these vegetables grow in low-lying land that 

 is prone to waterlogging.

 ?For example, Kakdwip, in South 24-Parganas, supplies bulk of the green chillies consumed by Calcuttans. But vast tracts of land in the region are now submerged,? said Narayan Poley, a vegetable-seller at the Gariahat market.

 The scene is the same in fish markets. ?Usually, this is the time when the markets are flooded with a large variety of fish. But thanks to the downpour, supply from the districts and other states is down to a trickle,? said a trader.

 Trucks carrying rohu and katla from Andhra Pradesh are either reaching the markets late or not coming at all. Even the season?s special, hilsa, is scarce.

 ?We have no option but to depend on local supply, which is not always satisfactory,? said Asit Das, a fish-seller at Gariahat market.

 General secretary of the College Street market traders? association Samir Pal said the vendors usually fix prices depending on supply. ?As the supply is poor, the vendors are buying the items at higher prices. We are, however, keeping a watch on the traders and will not allow anyone to adopt unscrupulous means,? he said.

 Harass trap nets cop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An officer of Howrah police station fell into a trap, laid by a housewife from Salt Lake and STAR Ananda on Thursday afternoon. He was caught red-handed while trying to molest the woman on Thursday afternoon.

 Sub-inspector Argha Chakraborty was suspended moments after the footage was aired on the channel. Inspector-general of police (south Bengal) Vageesh Mishra said a criminal case had been initiated against the officer.

 The woman said sub-inspector Chakraborty had been ?disturbing? her over the phone for the past year. ?He asked me to introduce him to an NRI and promised me a lead role in a television serial. He also said he would help me earn money if I would entertain his friends.?

 She discussed the matter with her husband and the couple sought the TV channel?s help to expose the officer. The woman told Chakraborty that she would meet him at a house in Sonarpur. The officer agreed. The channel was alerted and the spycams fitted in the room caught him in the act.

 n No entry: The main gate of the Chatterjee International Centre remained under lock and key till late on Thursday evening. Around 8.30 pm, according to security-in-charge Pradeep Dutta, a group of men entered the ground floor of the building ?by force?, through the side gate. Dutta claimed some of the men were armed. 

 The main gate had been locked early on Tuesday by a ground-floor owner, apparently under a court order. His representatives said posting armed guards in the lobby of the building was not illegal.

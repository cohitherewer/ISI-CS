 On a directive from the high court, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to take ?stern action? against house-owners letting out their premises illegally to host wedding receptions.

 According to a recent survey by the CMC, owners of more than 1,000 houses are renting out their premises for marriage ceremonies without taking permission from the civic authorities. The high court, while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) in 2003, had ruled that the owners would have to take permission from the CMC and pay it a fee before letting out their buildings for social functions.

 The court had ruled that the civic body had to follow a guideline for granting such permission and maintain a list of house-owners who let out their premises for social occasions after paying the fee.

 The petition was filed by some residents, who had alleged that the ?environment? of their localities was being affected because of the gatherings. They had also complained that the CMC had declined to act against errant house-owners. 

 ?We have information that many owners are renting out their houses for social gatherings without enrolling their names with the CMC. The norm is that the owners approach us for consent, which we grant after ensuring that they abide by certain rules,? mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said.

 The civic body, he asserted, will take ?stern action? against owners letting out their premises flouting the rules.

 According to an estimate of the revenue department, the civic body is losing around Rs 5 crore a year because of fee-evasion by house-owners.

 Some houses are let out at more than Rs 1 lakh a day. Some owners even charge on an hourly basis. The minimum and the maximum fees collected by the CMC from house-owners are Rs 20,060 and Rs 100,060 annually. 

 The civic rate depends on the size of a building. The rates for houses up to 2,500 sq ft is Rs 20,060 and more than 7,500 sq ft, Rs 100,060. Between 2,501 and 4,000 sq ft, the rate is Rs 30,000, between 4,001 and 5,500 sq ft, the rate is Rs 50,000 and for houses between 5,501 and 7,000 sq ft, the civic body has to be paid Rs 70,000.

 The CMC is also issuing guidelines for the public. ?Those who hire buildings, should demand a receipt from the owners, just as they demand rent receipts from landlords,? municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said. ?I would also like to urge people to come forward with information about buildings being let out for ceremonies illegally.?

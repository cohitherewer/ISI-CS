 From fantasy to history

 RITUPARNO GHOSH updates Reshmi 

 Sengupta about his projects

 Why Debi Chaudhurani?

 You can work with the text of 

 Debi Chaudhurani on different levels. In fact, Satyajit 

 Ray had wanted to do this film with Suchitra Sen. Debi Chaudhurani 

 is a Thugee, a Bengali girl who turns into a dacoit 

 after hitting a dead end. Bankim Chandras novel is based 

 on history The film will show riverine Bengal. I am intrigued 

 because its a saga of adventure and love and the conflict 

 in a woman between domesticity and independence, between 

 valour and the nobility of a housewife. Theres a combination 

 of strength and vulnerability that makes her so complex.

 Is it your next film?

 I have several films in the pipeline 

 and talks are going on simultaneously for many. But it doesnt 

 mean that each new film I am discussing will be my next. 

 Rahgeer will happen a little later; Akshay (Kumar) 

 and Aishwarya (Rai) are working out the dates.

 First, I will wrap up Sunglass 

 and then finish the dubbing of Khela. As of now, 

 I am prepared for Draupadi and Debi Chaudhurani. 

 The background work of Draupadi has been done, but 

 I have to think more about Debi Chaudhurani as I 

 will have to conceptualise it. The film needs a focus I 

 will have to see if I can build a parallel sense of value 

 system around the dacoity. Both films will have elaborate 

 outdoors and are extremely season-dependent. 

 Why Katrina Kaif as Debi?

 For the same reason I took Aishwarya 

 in Chokher Bali. Katrina is young and has classical 

 features, which would suit the role. Nana (Patekar) will 

 play Bhavani Pathak, Jisshu (Sengupta) will be Brajeshwar 

 and Anupam (Kher) the zamindar.

 Are you doing a film with Sushmita 

 Sen?

 Sushmita wants to do a Bengali 

 film because her father has urged her to do one I had written 

 a story some time back. Its about a Bengali girl who has 

 been raised in the army and gets married to a writer. I 

 think Sushmita will fit that character very well. This film 

 can wait for a couple of years as a more mature Sushmita 

 would be better.

 What is Sunglass about?

 Sunglass has an element 

 of fantasy and magic. The moment she (Konkona Sen Sharma) 

 wears the glasses, she can read peoples minds. This film 

 is actually against our tremendous urge to know what is 

 going on in the minds of others. Konkonas character wants 

 to know everything about her husband. Its a kind of intrusion 

 into ones privacy. I havent done a film like this before.

 What does Naseeruddin Shah 

 play?

 Naseer owns the shop from where 

 Konkona buys the sunglass. I told him that it was an unreal 

 character he had to play; he said okay.

 What prompted you to cast Jaya 

 Bachchan as Konkonas mother?

 I wanted two short women as mother 

 and daughter. Both the characters in the film want to be 

 taller Jayadi plays a schoolteacher (picture 

 top) and an emancipated woman. She will be here in 

 November.

 How different is the film in 

 Hindi and Bengali?

 The characterisation has changed. 

 Tota is a classical Bengali gentleman, while Madhavan is 

 todays youth, very fast. Konkona has changed her acting 

 accordingly, which was very interesting. As if she was doing 

 a double role. The pace and tempo of the two versions have 

 become completely different. I think they will turn out 

 to be two separate films.

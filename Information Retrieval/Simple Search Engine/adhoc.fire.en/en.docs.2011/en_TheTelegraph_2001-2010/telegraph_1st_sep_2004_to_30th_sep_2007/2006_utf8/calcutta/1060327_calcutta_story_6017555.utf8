 Reaffirming Calcutta?s status as the quizzing capital of India, over 100 teams turned up at Calcutta Club on Saturday afternoon to participate in the Dunlop Corporate Management Quiz. The club and the management department of JD Birla Institute organised the event in association with The Telegraph. 

 The quiz, one of largest in eastern India, had two-member teams pitting wits to crack questions like what is genetic lettering or the term for the dot on top of the letter i. The corporate knowhow of the participants was also put to thorough test. 

 The format was gruelling, with the quizzers having to clear several rounds, including a written one, to reach the final stage. They even had to face four quizmasters in what the organisers called the stratified rounds. Each quizmaster grilled the contestants on four topics ? marketing, organisational behaviour, human resources and finance.

 ?It was quite taxing. More so because the quizmasters made the participants remember what they had learnt in the B-schools. One had to be absolutely thorough with management principles to answer some of the questions thrown at us,? said one contestant.

 After the qualifying rounds, the eight teams that made the cut were Men at Work, Aditya Birla Management Corporation, ICICI Bank, National Insurance, Citibank, Anthropolace Consultants, Manjushree Infotech and Grasim Industries.

 The participation of both corporate and non-corporate teams resulted in intense competition for points. The audio-visual rounds, despite a few hiccups, excited the finalists the most. The advertising round, where the contestants had to guess the product after being shown a visual clue, was by far the most popular. The organisers did their best to confuse the contestants by putting in red herrings in most rounds. 

 The subject spectrum round saw quizmaster Suman Kumar Mukherjee testing the theoretical knowledge of the contestants to the utmost. From organisational behaviour and strategic management to managerial economics and international business management, the entire gamut of management policies, fundamentals and even ethics were explored as Mukherjee demanded rational and explanatory answers.

 With the audience joining in with gusto and cheering on their favourites, Men at Work, comprising Dipankar Chakrabarty and D. Moitra, walked away with the first prize of Rs 40,000 plus gift hampers. The team had established a comfortable lead from the early rounds itself.

 The second prize of Rs 30,000 and gift hampers was won by Grasim Industries, while ICICI Bank came third. They, too, won gift hampers in addition to cash prize of Rs 20,000. Calcutta Club president Dilip Bose and quizmaster and director of the institute Suman Kumar Mukherjee gave the prizes away.

 ?The quiz was really enjoyable and it was good to see the youngsters competing so hard,? said an enthralled audience member.

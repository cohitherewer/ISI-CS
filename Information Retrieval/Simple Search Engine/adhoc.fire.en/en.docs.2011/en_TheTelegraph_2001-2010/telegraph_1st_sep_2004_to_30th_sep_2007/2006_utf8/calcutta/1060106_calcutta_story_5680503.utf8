 Private colleges in surfeit cry

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Five years ago, private entrepreneurs were making a beeline for the state education department, seeking permission to open engineering colleges, preferably in Calcutta or Howrah.

 Now, the entrepreneurs who had their wishes granted are lobbying with the government not to allow any more private institutions. The reason: mushrooming of such colleges have left them with no alternative but to admit a good number of mediocre students, who lack the aptitude of becoming successful engineers.

 ?If private institutions are to produce good engineers, they must enrol high-performers. But that won?t be possible if the engineering seats keep increasing,? said Satyajit Chakraborty, director of Salt Lake-based Institute of Engineering and Management, one of the oldest private institutions. He is also vice-president of the newly-formed Association of Professional Academic Institutions, set up by owners of the private colleges.

 There are now 13,000 engineering seats in the state. Against these, the state Joint Entrance Examination board publishes a merit list of 26,000 to 30,000 candidates. 

 Government rules stipulate that the number of JEE-qualifying candidates must be at least double the number of engineering seats.

 In the past few years, students ranking between 15,000 and 30,000 were found to be mediocre and had fared poorly in the Plus II examination.

 The toppers, ranking within 3,500-4,000, are absorbed by the IITs (most students sit for both the IIT entrance test and the JEE), Jadavpur University, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, and the other state-run engineering institutions. 

 A few thousand students in the middle order move to other states. Those in the lower grade seek admission to the private colleges.

 ?As it is, the private colleges are getting students ranking low on the list. There is no point opening any new college,? an association source said.

 Pointing out another difficulty, he said: ?Once a student finds a berth on the merit list, he/she has the right to seek admission to any college where a seat is vacant. And the college receiving the application has to admit him/her, if it doesn?t want to be drawn into a legal battle. A shorter merit list would provide an opportunity to have more meritorious students.?

 Manotosh Biswas, a senior official in the state technical education department, admits that there are now enough engineering seats. ?The government is yet to finalise whether any more private colleges will be allowed,? he signed off.

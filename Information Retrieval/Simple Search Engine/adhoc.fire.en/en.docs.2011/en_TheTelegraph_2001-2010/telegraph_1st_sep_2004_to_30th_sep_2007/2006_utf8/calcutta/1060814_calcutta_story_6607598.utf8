 Over 500 Youth Congress and Chhatra Parishad activists, led by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, hit the streets on Sunday to protest the violence on the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) campus, that has claimed the life of a third-year student, Soumik Basu.

 The protesters blocked the Hazra Road crossing for over an hour, demanding exemplary punishment for those responsible for the death. A protester threw a stone at a window screen of a state bus. 

 The activists later marched to Metro cinema, where they formed a human chain. We shall launch a bigger movement if the authorities fail to stop the violence on the Shibpur campus, announced Mukherjee. Our boys will organise a protest at Besu on Monday and will also launch demonstrations at Jadavpur and Calcutta universities Soumik is a victim of campus violence let loose by the CPM.

 The Students Federation of India, a CPM affiliate, has called a strike on Monday. Exams have been kept beyond its purview.

 Security has been stepped up on the Besu campus, where an uneasy calm prevails. We have overhauled campus security to restore peace and boost confidence among students, who are yet to come out of the shock of Soumiks death, said Niraj Singh, superintendent of police (Howrah).

 Singh, who visited the university during the day, said three platoons of policemen were keeping a round-the-clock vigil on the campus.

 He added that though sleuths have arrived at the conclusion that there was no foul play behind Soumiks death, the probe has not been closed. We may have to interrogate some students.

 Vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea, too shocked to comment, said classes would remain suspended on Monday.

 The campus had been rocked with violence between two rival students union through Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. 

 Soumik, a student of electrical engineering, fell off the second floor of a hostel around 11 am on Wednesday. 

 He suffered critical injury to the brain and died on Saturday afternoon, after being on a life-support system for three days. The body was cremated at night after post-mortem at Kantapukur morgue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeout

 Though rarely perceived to be sharing any strain of similarity, both Bengali and Urdu songs have a natural appeal to the emotions. Celebrating this fundamental musical consonance, Goethe-Institut and Indo-German Association jointly host an evening of songs of Atulprasad, Dwijendralal, Tagore and Faiz. To be rendered by Sarmila Bose (picture above), the presentation emphasises the poetic and social content of songs in both languages. It also endeavours to draw attention to the profundity of Urdu lyricism, which has unfortunately been overlooked and forgotten by lovers of Bengali music. The songs of Faiz, similar in tone and temper to the songs of Tagore and other Bengali composers, invoke and inspire feelings of love, unity and brotherhood. In harmony with Faiz?s works, that are raga-based, this concert will feature Bengali compositions influenced by classical tunes only. Exploring the comparative nuances of poetry and melody, the musical weave will effectively establish the mood and message of Bengali and Urdu pieces.

 Event: Bengali and Urdu songs by Sarmila Bose 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Max Mueller Bhavan Auditorium

 Teasers attack brave cop

 - Five men hounding morning walkers at Tallah Park arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The veil of violence descending over morning walkers on Thursday stretched from the Dhakuria Lakes to Tallah Park.

 A voice raised against eve-teasing left a police officer battered and bruised in north Calcutta early on Thursday.

 The additional officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station was beaten up by five goons when he tried to stop them from harassing a young woman out on a morning walk.

 To rein them in, Niren Chatterjee revealed his identity, but that had no effect on the teasers. As soon as he caught one of them, the gang turned violent and started bashing him up. Though outnumbered, Chatterjee fought back.

 Policemen from a housing complex rushed to the spot when Chatterjee raised an alarm and overpowered the goons. Sadhan Talukdar, 33, Ajay Shaw, 40, Sajed Khan, 32, Feroz Khan, 32, and Haidar Ali, 35, were later arrested.

 Sadhan and Ajay run a small shop on BT Road, while Feroz, Haidar and Sajed are unemployed.

 ?A probe revealed that these five men would turn up at Tallah Park every morning and pass lewd comments at women who came in for a morning walk. Feroz, Sajed and Haidar are residents of Belgachhia, while Sadhan and Ajay are from Cossipore,? said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma.

 Two complaints against the tease gang were lodged last week. Plainclothesmen would now be deployed in the park to round up other eve-teasers.

 According to an officer of Shyampukur police station, Thursday?s incident occurred around 7 am. 

 As on any given morning, Chatterjee had gone to the park for a stroll. The five goons were sitting on a bench, ?passing lewd comments and making obscene gestures? at every passing woman.

 ?Suddenly they surrounded a woman aged around 29 and started harassing her. The woman shouted for help and Chatterjee stepped up,? the officer narrated.

 The additional officer-in-charge of Shyampukur thana first told them to stop and then showed them his identity card. But the five continued to tease the woman. Chatterjee then pushed one of them and grappled with another.

 The five ganged up against Chatterjee and rained blows on him. Bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth, the braveheart cop raised an alarm, drawing other policemen to the spot.

 One of the assailants had even snatched Chatterjee?s mobile phone, wristwatch and wallet in the melee. These were later recovered.

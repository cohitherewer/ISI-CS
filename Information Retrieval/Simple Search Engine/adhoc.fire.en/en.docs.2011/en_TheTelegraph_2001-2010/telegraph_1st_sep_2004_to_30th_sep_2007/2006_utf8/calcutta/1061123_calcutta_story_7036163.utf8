 The fire at 33C, Topsia Road, that claimed nine lives early on Wednesday, could have occurred in any building in the locality. And spread to the rest. 

 Illegal constructions with no regard for safety, hazardous commercial activities in buildings without emergency exits, lanes too narrow for fire tenders and even narrower spaces between houses Topsia is a tinderbox waiting to go up in flames. 

 No wonder, the mayor called the zone a jotugriha one that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is complicit in creating. 

 Over the past couple of decades, the civic body has allowed one vertical structure after another to rear up in an industrial belt where tanneries and bag-manufacturing units abound.

 The owner of the building that caught fire owns four identical structures in the area, two of them with a common wall. The remaining two are less than four feet apart.

 The situation is the same in every house in Topsia. The promoters are driven by greed and do not spare a thought for safety. Ill-planned, dingy, stuffed with people only the occupants know how they live here, says Nizamuddin Ahmed, who stays next to 33C. 

 The local legislator and councillor pass the buck to the mayor for allowing the illegal constructions to flourish.

 This isnt the only area where there are illegal constructions. Buildings that violate rules have sprung up everywhere. I have written several times to both the previous mayor, Subrata Mukherjee, and current mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. Nothing has been done, claims local MLA and councillor Javed Ahmed Khan.

 The blaze prompted Bhattacharyya to admit administrative lapses in allowing illegal buildings and illegal factories to come up in a congested residential area. He urged the residents to maintain vigil and alert authorities to prevent illegal structures from coming up. 

 There are other signs of administrative apathy. Topsia was declared an industrial zone in 1976. One of the primary requirements of such a zone is a fire station. In Topsia, there is not even a fire sub-station.

 The two fire stations within an hours drive are on Free School Street and in Gariahat. Tenders from the stations arrived more than an hour-and-a-half after the blaze had engulfed the third-floor of 33C. Local residents were up in arms by then and Rapid Action Force had been deployed.

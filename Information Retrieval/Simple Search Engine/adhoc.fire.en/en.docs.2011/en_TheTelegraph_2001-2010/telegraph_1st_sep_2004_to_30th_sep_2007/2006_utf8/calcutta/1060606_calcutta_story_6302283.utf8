 Focus shift from city to rural areas

 Environment minister Mohanto Chatterjee is barely a couple of weeks into his new assignment but seems to have a clear idea of what he needs to do. The department, he says, will move away from its Calcutta-centric activities to turn its eye to the rest of the state.

 ?I feel the environment department and state pollution control board should have more functional connectivity with the districts and not just focus on Calcutta and its surroundings,? said Chatterjee, first-time MLA from Domjur, Howrah, in an exclusive interview with Metro.

 The minister is also prepared to take a fresh look at the ?industrial siting policy?, being practised since the 90s, that does not allow potentially polluting units to come up in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. Such units, however, can come up in panchayat areas.

 A senior Left Front leader from a district said: ?The greatest fault of the environment department is that it did not do very much to address environment-related problems in the rural areas, where polluting units like brick kilns or sponge iron factories carry on their operations with impunity. During the poll campaign, we had to face several uncomfortable questions from voters in the rural areas.?

 The environment minister admitted that ?there have been environment-related complaints from villages? and stressed the need to adopt ?a balanced industrial siting policy, keeping in mind the imperatives of both green preservation and development?.

 Implementation of green norms, he feels, is as important as formulating them. Chatterjee is also keen to undertake specific green projects for polluted pockets like Howrah and Durgapur.

 ?The roadmap for detailed action will take time, but we have to act in certain areas on priority. There are other issues, like auto emission, that are important but our department has a limited role to play,? said Chatterjee, who had a session with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to discuss the department?s modus operandi.

 Conservation of wetlands and waterbodies figures prominently on the minister?s priority list. ?Not just the East Calcutta Wetlands, we want to conserve all wetlands in the state,? the minister asserted. 

 The statement seems to be a departure from the department?s earlier stand of focussing only on the East Calcutta Wetlands. The sixth Left Front government had tabled a bill in the last session of the Assembly to create an authority that will look after the Ramsar-recognised wetlands, off EM Bypass.

 The minister, however, does not want to see the changes as a policy shift. ?There cannot be any policy shift with the change of minister. We all have to work according to the policy laid down by the government. The only difference may be that the earlier minister was from the city and I am from a village.?

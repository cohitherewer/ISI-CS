 Loves labour found

 Eduardo de Filippos play, Filumena Marturano, exposes male hypocrisy in matters of love and marriage, while making a wry comment on a society that leaves women with little means to lead their lives independently and with dignity. Reminiscent of the satirical comedies of Ben Jonson, the Bengali adaptation of Filippos play, Mrs. Soriano is a burlesque on romance and true love. Through the medium of humour and laughter, the play unfolds the story of Filumena, mistress and housekeeper of the wealthy Domenico Soriano. Having served him loyally for 25 years, she feels shocked and betrayed when she learns about Sorianos intention to marry a young, attractive and socially acceptable girl. Filumena tricks him into marrying her by pretending that she is dying. Soon after wedding ceremony, however, startling revelations, one after another, leave both Mr and Mrs Soriano totally dumbfounded. Despite the plays obvious ironies, the spirit of humanity and moral optimism shines through it, ultimately glorifying a life in which love prevails. Acting, direction and music: Dolly Basu.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Mrs. Soriano, by Choopkatha

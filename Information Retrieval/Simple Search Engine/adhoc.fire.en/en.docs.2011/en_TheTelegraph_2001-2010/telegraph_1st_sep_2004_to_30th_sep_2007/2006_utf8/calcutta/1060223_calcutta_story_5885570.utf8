The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Actor has the last laugh

 Shekhar Suman with Navjot Singh Sidhu and Parizaad Kolah in The Great Indian Laughter Challenge

 It needed just a few episodes alongside Navjot Singh Sidhu for Shekhar Suman to hang up his laughing boots. The new season of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge, to premiere this Friday at 10 pm on STAR One, is likely to be the last time that the ?Amitabh Bachchan of the small screen? will move and shake to tickle the funny bone of people across the country and beyond.

 ?I have decided to quit comedy completely,? says the man who had once made it to the record books for shooting the maximum number of hours on a single day. ?I have carried the excess baggage of humour for quite some time now. Now, I am overburdened and tired. Comedy is after all a very tiny facet of my life but it has become too overpowering.?

 Having failed in movies ? his sensuous scenes with Rekha in Shashi Kapoor?s Utsav notwithstanding ? Shekhar reached iconic status on the telly. ?I have done all kinds of things from playing the messiah of the people in election shows to a GK guy in shows like Dial One to making people laugh,? he explains, ?but I kind of became a funnyman. People failed to understand that there are many layers of masks in an actor. Anyway, I have dropped one, hope they can see the rest now!?

 But before he stops making people laugh, Shekhar is set to enjoy a laugh himself as he reprises his role of the judge in the second season of the The Great Indian Laughter Challenge. ?Comedy in India has always been synonymous with fat gross people trying to make you laugh,? Shekhar says. ?With Movers amp; Shakers, I tried to change the face of humour. Now, shows like Laughter Challenge have been able to pull that off because of the strength of the performers.?

 Shekhar feels that the small-town contestants have made all the difference in the comedy genre on TV. ?People in the metropolis have wealth and health but no life,? he feels. ?It is the thelawallahs and local goons in small towns who are socially and politically more aware and as such have more life in them which audiences can easily identify with. People like Bachchan saab, Shatrughan Sinha and Dharmendra were all small town people and a Shah Rukh Khan lacks the finesse of an Amitabh Bachchan because the latter has a greater study of life.?

 Not just the content but the style of comedy has also undergone a facelift. ?It has become less slapstick and more cerebral and mimicking actors has become passe,? Shekhar explains. ?Having already shot for a few episodes of the new season, I can tell you that the participants this time are a lot more prepared. There are some contestants from Pakistan and their take on life is so very different. They are exceptionally good with one-liners.?

 Shekhar is well aware what his presence on the show brings to the table. ?You know, I am someone who?s been there and done that and so my being there gives a certain credibility to the show,? he says. ?It?s like Sachin Tendulkar judging a cricket match or Muhammad Ali judging a boxing game. When I asked STAR CEO Samir Nair why do you want me to be there on the show, he said, ?When you laugh, the whole country will laugh with you?.?

 But it won?t be long before Shekhar bids adieu to Laughter Challenge. ?I have already quit The Great Indian Comedy Show,? he reveals. ?I want to be a consummate actor and experiment with roles. As I have always maintained, I have never anchored shows, I have ?actored? them. Now, it will be a whole lot of movies, which my production company will make. I have already shot for a very different kind of movie named Moonlight with Perizaad Zorabian. Then my music and writing are also going off well.?

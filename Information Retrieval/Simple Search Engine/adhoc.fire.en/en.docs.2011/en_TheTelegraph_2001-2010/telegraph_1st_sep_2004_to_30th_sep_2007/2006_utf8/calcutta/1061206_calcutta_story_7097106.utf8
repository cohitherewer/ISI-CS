 Beauty, bandh and Bolly

 If bandh culture does stage a comeback, Calcutta might just have a beautiful new resident Deepika Padukone. The ramp scorcher-turned-actress said on Tuesday she wished she lived in Calcutta. Wow, so many bandhs so many holidays! smiled the 20-year-old busybee, in town to tee off Infocom CXO Golf 2006 at RCGC.

 Bandh or no bandh, Deepika had a job to do. And like everything else, she did it in style. Looking just right for a winter golf morning, she came dressed in denims, a white jacket over a white top, large-framed sunglasses, golf shoes, gold clutch and beaded neckpiece in place. GoodLife caught up with Deepika, as she bedazzled everyone on the greens.

 I begin shooting for Farah Khans Om Shanti Om (opposite a certain Shah Rukh Khan) in January Ill be working every single day of my life. Its going to be like a proper job, only worse. I have to start shooting at 5 am and not finish till midnight and double shifts mean 24 hours of work, says Deepika, standing tall all of 5 ft 8 at the crossroads of two careers after two years of modelling.

 Though I did Aishwarya, a south Indian film, we didnt shoot continuously. It was never more than a two-week schedule at a stretch

 Deepika is apprehensive about walking off the ramp shell make an appearance to start or end a show from now on on to reel. I always knew I wanted to do something different and, that too, differently, and thats why I stayed away from the Miss India, Miss World and Miss Universe path. Moreover, I wanted to be known as a super model independently, with no titles and no frills, she adds.

 The daughter of badminton great Prakash Padukone feels life wont change much after filmdom. I am a private person who loves spending time with close friends and family. I am suddenly not going to start attending more or fewer parties than I am used to...

 A jeans-and-tees person, Deepika claims that on a normal day she looks like any other college-going girl. It is difficult to recognise me with no make-up and my hair tied back.

 Make-up is every models must, especially if she happens to be the international cover face for make-up brand Maybelline. Here are Deepikas tips, on make-up and more: 

 Choose the right base shade. If you have great skin, dont dab unnecessarily, use it only under the eyes and on blemishes as concealer.

 Use a lash stylist (from Maybelline, of course!). The brush is fantastic and adds volume naturally. 

 Suck in your cheeks and apply the blush. Make sure the bristles are soft; clean it after use. 

 Evening make-up need not always be dramatic and over-the-top. If you like the natural look, then stick by it at night too, just add more mascara. 

 Never put too many good things together; they all get lost. Let few great things shine through.

 Before she left to take a second round of the golf course before heading for her hotel spa, the million-dollar question: will she talk about her love life? (Read, whats up between her and model Nihar Pandya.) You know I wont talk about my personal life na, she blushed.

 Varsity tips for Sarobar revival

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The Rabindra Sarobar banks having been freed of encroachments, the government has set its sights on a ?complete revival? of the national lake with active inputs from experts of Jadavpur University.

 Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), the nodal agency in the revamp of the 192-acre waterbody, has engaged the university at the instance of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 The first meeting between the CIT and a team of experts from the university to thrash out a ?comprehensive revival plan? is scheduled for Monday. 

 The government has set a three-month deadline for finalising the blueprint and the CIT is scheduled to start work by April.

 ?Every aspect of the proposed revamp is being taken care of,? said Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher of construction engineering and chairman of the five-member team set up by the university to prepare the revival plan. ?It?s clear from the agreement with the CIT that the most crucial area of our study will be optimisation of the freshness of the water,? he added.

 The other areas the university has been asked to provide inputs on include prevention of air pollution in and around the Lakes and protection of the greens that are under threat from the vehicular movement on Southern Avenue and the Lake Gardens flyover. 

 ?We will also suggest steps to beautify and illuminate the Sarobar landscape, improve the condition of the roads within the enclosure and set up walkways and car park zones,? Biswas added.

 ?We are engaging top-class experts of our institution, as the recommendations need to be thoroughly research-based,? said an official of the university, which will be paid a ?reasonable? fee for the job.

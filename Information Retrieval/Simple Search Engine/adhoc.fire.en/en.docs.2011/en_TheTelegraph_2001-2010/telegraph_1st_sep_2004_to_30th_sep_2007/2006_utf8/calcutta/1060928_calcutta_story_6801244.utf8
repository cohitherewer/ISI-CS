 The wait is over. The five days of the year that the city waits for through the remaining 360 are here. And so its time for the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja team to take the field and keep vigil so that the festival of, for and by the people is celebrated in its true spirit.

 This time, an even greater number of pujas have signed up to project their people-friendly face. Of them, 175 have been shortlisted. Over Sashthi and Saptami, their true spirit of sharing and caring, of being conscious of the right and the wrong, of being clean and compassionate would be tested.

 And the organisers are revving up for just that. We have followed all safety and security measures as closely as possible. The pandal has a steel structure and no inflammable materials have been used. We have even avoided using cloth and used plaster of Paris instead, said Arun Lal of Mudiali Club, adding that they hoped to be crowned this year. 

 The urge to improve is fierce. We have been steadily climbing up the True Spirit ladder and after being awarded the Five Star puja status last year, we have done everything to become this years Model puja, said Anjan Chakraborty of Nandana Yuva Sangha of Behala, while brushing aside talk of the luck factor having favoured Behala pujas in 2005. We won because we deserved to and this year we intend to do even better, he announced.

 Preparations are as frenetic on the other side of the Hooghly. Olabibitola Sarbojonin Durgotsav in Shibpur has recreated an old two-storeyed zamindar house complete with a temple which houses the idol, but has not forgotten to take all the necessary measures to make it a True Spirit Puja fire-proofing, drinking water, separate toilets and a special gate for the physically challenged.

 The True Spirit puja contest has brought about a change by developing an awareness of the social responsibilities we have as individuals. In keeping with the spirit, we are distributing clothes to over 150 needy people on Wednesday, said Akhil Bhattacharya. The Three-Star recognition last year has helped the Howrah puja find a sponsor in 2006.

 The increase in the number of participants from 130-odd to 175 has allowed a number of debutants into the fray. One of them is Madhya Calcutta Sarbojanin Durgotsav, celebrating its diamond jubilee showcasing fast-disappearing traditional toys.

 We dont just do a puja, we also help the needy. Bondona Pal, a woman footballer, has made the toys that are on display. She had hurt herself while playing and needs an operation. We have decided to fund that, said organiser Siddhartha Sarkar.

 The safety measures we have taken are not new. But it is true that people are taking extra care about these very essential issues in the hope of winning this contest, he smiled.

 After all, this is all about an award becoming a movement.

 Being presented as part of Hutch Odeon 2006, Gahvar takes a sharp look at the flaws in contemporary society, pointing out total corruption, callousness and lack of accountability as the reasons for social anarchy and lawlessness. The play begins with an apparently common accident in which a boy, hanging from the footboard of an overcrowded bus, slips and falls, and is run over by a passing car. The news naturally makes its way to the inner pages of a local newspaper. Initially, not much importance is attached to it. Soon, however, the question arises whether the occurrence was indeed accidental, or, whether the boy was deliberately pushed out of the bus. Seen in the light of such a possibility, the news suddenly gains in momentum. It expands its circumference to include lapses in politics, administration and accepted precepts of living, exposing dark, destructive holes in our so-called secure and reliable social order. Drama, direction and acting: Soumitra Basu.

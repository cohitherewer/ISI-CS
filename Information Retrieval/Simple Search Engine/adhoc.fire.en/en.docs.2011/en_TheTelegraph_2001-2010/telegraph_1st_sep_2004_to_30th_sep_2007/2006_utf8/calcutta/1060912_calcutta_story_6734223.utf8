The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Comeback kid 

 croons on

 Divakar Sharma 

 Are you among those who needed 

 a towel when the red light came on for Divakar Sharma on 

 September 1 in Zee TVs Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs? 

 The entire audience did. But the 13-year-old himself was 

 the sole exception, handling the expulsion from the contest 

 with grace. Even without eyesight, he could foresee that 

 Mera sangeet khatam nahin hua.

 A lifeline has been thrown to 

 him by way of a chance to bounce back as the best among 

 the pick of those eliminated. After the SMS polling over 

 the weekend, Tuesday will show whether it will be the Delhi 

 boy who will re-enter the talent hunt. 

 But Divakar has already caught 

 the imagination of the nation. Offers are coming to take 

 him to his dream destination Taj Mahal free and to sponsor 

 his eye treatment. His admirers include Atal Bihari Vajpayee 

 and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. 

 Speaking over phone from Mumbai 

 on the way back from the latters residence on Friday evening, 

 the boy spoke about how he sang Dil Hoom Hoom Kare thrice 

 and then Tere Liye from Veer-Zaara to the 

 film-maker who had invited him over. He said he will call 

 me after three-four years, said the boy who has seen 

 and loved Bhansalis Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. 

 The list does not include Black, the film about a 

 deaf-mute-blind, which Divakar reminded Bhansali of. The 

 reason is simple: Black did not have songs, Divakars window 

 to a film.

 Divakars father Sunil, a businessman, 

 was more forthcoming about the boys rise which has been 

 documented in a half-hour film by Doordarshan. The recipient 

 of Saraswati Samman from the home ministry does not have 

 his talent limited to singing. He is a computer freak. That 

 made him come second in the Pogo Child of the Year contest 

 last year. He is good with GK too, proof of that being his 

 reaching the final of the Bournvita Quiz Confidence Championship 

 a couple of weeks ago in far-away Singapore.

 The last round was based on a 

 special talent which Divakar had chosen as singing. He was 

 given two hours to prepare and sing a Tamil song. He was 

 doing fine but forgot the lyrics on stage. His father has 

 no regrets about the missed chance, though. If he had qualified 

 for another round, he would have missed this chance in Mumbai. 

 Kavitaji (Krishnamurthy, one of the Bournvita judges) 

 had told him that God must have planned something special 

 for him.

 The boy who always scores above 

 95 per cent in school (Delhi Public School, RK Puram) has 

 had to miss classes for the past couple of months. But the 

 principal has been very supportive. She has asked him to 

 concentrate on the contest, says Mishra. So it is music 

 first for Divakar, for now.

 The Diary

 A weeks holiday

 The last time there was a poem

 The last time there were words

 The last you spoke left scars

 The last we wrote was of love

 (We wrote differently of course)

 The last that was heard was silence

 Farewells are difficult

 The last was a nightmare 

 a month long

 This was a days death.

Liar

 Trust me! I am a liar,

 I never used to love thee,

 Its your illusive dreams,

 that fabricated what you didnt see.

 I am but a perplexed poet,

 engulfed in my maimed past,

 I needed a Muse to write,

 not a baggage that will ever last.

 Hate me, Stab me,

 Set those trysts on fire,

 I am a fugitive of your love,

 Trust me! I am a liar.

 Archan Bhattacharya, 

 Don Bosco Park Circus

 The Unnameable One

 Beyond the slash and burn manner 

 of calculations

 Beyond the unsteady exchange of indifferent hands

 Beyond the anxious sweat settling unsettled

 Enormous planets on the black-blank space of fate

 A window wide open reveals a blue vision

 That expects the eager throw of your blues

 You comply.

 A thought is an Odysseus

 Casting an unsure glance

 At the eager face of your globetrotting passport.

 A thought rides on the wind

 Of no purpose, birth or death.

 Call it love...

 Call it your soul...

 Call it poetry...

 Subhadeep Paul,

 Chit Chat

 Changing cityscape

 The City of Joy turned 316 on 

 August 24. Concern for Calcutta launched its youth cell 

 on the day with a debate and Powerpoint presentations.

 Many of the 14 debators questioned: 

 How much more will Calcutta expand? The school students 

 were to speak for or against the motion: The bubble of 

 Calcutta surging ahead will burst sooner than later (picture 

 below by Amit Datta).

 Those who spoke for the motion 

 brought up various socio-economic problems that are affecting 

 the city heavy traffic, potholes and growing pollution 

 topped the list of peeves. We have even come upon an incident 

 where a patient in one of the government hospitals died 

 because her eye was eaten up by ants. This is not what we 

 call development, said Rishab Surana of Lakshmipat Singhania 

 Academy.

 The speakers also pointed out 

 how the jute mills were closing down, adding to unemployment. 

 On the one hand, foreign investors are vying with each other 

 to invest in the IT sector here, on the other, it is at 

 the cost of agricultural land. Result: an over-supply of 

 unskilled labour.

 But according to Tania Bhattacharyya 

 of Modern High School, the speakers were digressing. She 

 stressed that before judging whether the bubble will burst 

 or not, we must first determine what is inside the bubble 

 and what outside. Her clarity of thought and speech won 

 her the best speaker award.

 But Calcutta is not just about 

 footpath-dwellers, pollution and potholes. That was what 

 the speakers against the motion elaborated on. Rome wasnt 

 built in a day, and so is Calcutta, said Shaila Jalan of 

 Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, who later emerged the runner-up. 

 Calcutta now has flyovers, malls and the IT sector. Is there 

 any doubt then that Calcutta is developing, they asked. 

 The traffic snarls are also pointers to the fact that more 

 Calcuttans can now afford cars, reasoned Shayak Chakravorty 

 of La Martiniere for Boys.

 The five-minute Powerpoint presentations 

 by students from seven city schools were either on From 

 Netaji to Sourav G or on Jhaalmuri to Kosha 

 Mangsho. Apeejay School was adjudged the best performer, 

 with Modern High School coming in second place. Up next, 

 was a cultural programme in which each group had to express 

 a specific mood and thought about the city. Shri Shikshayatan 

 School topped the contest, followed by St James School.

 Wine wonders

 What: 

 Wine appreciation and tasting session.

 Where: Platinum Lounge, Ivory. 

 When: November 25.

 Take a look: An understanding of your wine would enhance your enjoyment of it. That was the idea behind a wine appreciation session co-hosted by Young Leaders Forum of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Champagne Indage Limited on the fifth floor of the Camac Street dining address.

 Youth leaders turned connoisseurs for the evening as they evaluated different wines guided by wine educator Ajay Gothwal. 

 From the kind of glasses used for serving wine down to the cheese that helps to clear ones palate before changing wines The handful of people that formed the audience learnt it all. 

 The session took the audience through the steps of tasting wine, its health benefits, why the shelf life of red wine is more than its white counterpart, the horizontal placement of wine bottles during storage and the age factor of wines. Before sipping your next glass, make sure to check out its visual clarity, aroma, flavour and taste. 

 An interesting info nugget: France records the highest estimate of wine consumption per person, 16.5 gallons, compared to one-fourth of a teaspoon in India!

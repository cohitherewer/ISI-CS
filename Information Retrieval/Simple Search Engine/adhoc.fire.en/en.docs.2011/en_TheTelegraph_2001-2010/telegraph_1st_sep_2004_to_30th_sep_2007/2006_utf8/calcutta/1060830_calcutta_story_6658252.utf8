 What: 

 The Yang-Chow Food Promotion. 

 Where: Chinoiserie at Taj 

 Bengal.

 When: Till September 3.

 The spread: Start off with Yang Zhou Pob River Fresh Shrimp, Yang Chow Smoked Fish or Tofu Salad with Coriander and Peanuts. Savour a bowl of Seaweed Egg Drop Soup before moving on to the main course. If you want a slight variation from the typical Yang-Chow cuisine, which has plenty of meats and some seafood as well, try Shanyao in White Garlic Sauce (white yam) or Garlic Flavoured Corn Kernel with Song Ren Seeds. Otherwise, you can opt for Fu Rong Fish (steamed egg and fish cake) or Yang Chow Chicken in Oyster Sauce. 

 You can enjoy the main course with noodles or rice; try the Yang-Chow Fried Rice or Triple Flavoured Vegetable Flavoured Noodles. Sadly, for dessert there is just one dish Double Boiled Snow Fungus with Chinese Dates.

 Moving away from the regular August Moon and Chinese New Year food festivals, this promotion with its accent on the cuisine of a Chinese province, sets out to be different. The Yang-Chow cuisine has a distinctly light flavour and a sweet aftertaste, be it the starters or the noodles.

 Pocket pinch: The dishes on the a-la-carte menu are priced between Rs 275 and Rs 800.

 Voiceover: Yang-Chow cuisine, cooked up by Chef Lian, will be a new experience for Calcuttans, said executive chef Sujan Mukherjee.

 Just kebab 

 What: Kebab and Paratha festival.

 Where: Cubes Kitchen and Lounge at 209 AJC Bose Road.

 When: The festival will continue till September 3.

 The spread: In an effort to spice things up, the multi-cuisine restaurant and lounge has a special offering of kebabs and parathas. Though the kebabs feature on the existing menu, the parathas will be served only during the festival. 

 Among the vegetarian kebabs, try Tandoori Bharwan Aloo (soft potatoes stuffed with dry fruits and seasonal vegetables), Charminar Sheek Kebab (cheese and cream stuffing) or Tandoori Shimla Mirch. 

 In the non-vegetarian section, dig into Shammi Kebab, Banjari Kebab or Sarsowali Mahi. Besides the regular parathas like aloo, muli, gobi and keema, try the slightly off-beat versions like Warki (stuffed with butter and cream) and Cubes special paratha (stuffed with paneer and anaardana). 

 The restaurant has also introduced vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis for corporates and office-goers.

 Pocket pinch: While the parathas are priced between Rs 50 and Rs 100, the kebabs cost anything between Rs 120 and Rs 250. The vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis are priced at Rs 85 and Rs 95 respectively.

 Bridging opera worlds

 If Rabindranath Tagore?s Debotar Grash charmed opera audiences in Europe as Snatched by the Gods, a work of Upendra Kishore Raychaudhuri is now being adapted into a children?s opera in London.

 Upendra Kishore?s Boka Jola Aar Sheyaler Katha will take the stage this December as Chincha-Chancha Cooroo or The Weaver?s Wedding.

 Scholar William Radice, who discussed both the works at the British Council on Monday evening, is peeved that Indians ? at home and abroad ? have shown ?very little interest? in either. Radice has written the librettos for both the operas.

 Snatched by the Gods is one of the two one-act pieces (the other being Broken Strings) set to music by Param Vir, an acclaimed London-based composer of Indian origin. The piece is based on Radice?s translation of Debotar Grash and was launched in the Munich Biennial in the 1990s.

 It widely travelled Europe ? Almeida Opera in London, Scottish Opera and Berlin State Opera ? and was later revived in 2003.

 ?Snatched by the Gods had a very shattering effect on the audience. It has entered the standard opera repertoire, which is something very difficult to achieve,? said Radice, illustrating his talk with video and audio clips of the works.

 The music for Chincha-Chancha Cooroo?, based on the folk fable from Upendra Kishore?s popular Tuntunir Galpo, has been scored by Bernard Hughes. The composition has been performed by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, among others.

 While writing the libretto for Chincha-Chancha, meant to be a children?s opera commissioned by W11 Opera in London, Radice incorporated a lot of Indian rhythm which he had absorbed during his stay in the country.

 ?Bernard has tried another difficult task of bridging the worlds of opera, which is more serious, and the musical, which is light and often corny,? observed Radice, who will also be speaking at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park, later in the week.

What: Fish Festival. 

Where: Charnocks, Charnock City, KB-26, 

Salt lake, Sector III. 

 When: Till August 27.

 The spread: No, this is not another hilsa festival. From sardines to soles, there is much more to this 10-day fish fiesta. The menu is an assortment of Italian, Mexican and Bengali delicacies. One can choose his/her fish of choice from a live display counter on the ground floor.

 Not only our master chef, we have women from all walks of life whipping up fish treats that are lesser known today. After all, there are traditional dishes that cannot be replicated by a chef in a restaurant environment, says proprietor Mandira Mukherjee. So you have women like Shanti, a homemaker, cooking up Loitte and Krishnakali Banerjee, a school teacher, showcasing some true-blue Bengali fish preparations. Mandira chooses not to be left out. She will treat foodies to Aam Sorse Diye Catfish and Tangra Machh in Garlic Oil.

 For starters, pamper your tastebuds with Beer Batter Prawn, Garlic Fried Pomfret, Pan-fried Baby Beckti and Garlic Fried Beckti. Move on to the main course with Goan Surmai Curry, Puti Machher Chochchori, Malabari Prawn, Boyal Machher Rasa and Grilled Sardine. Hilsa lovers need not be disappointed. You can have your share of Smoked Hilsa, Aam Tel Ilish and Sorse Ilish.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 90.

 Voiceover: The festival is an opportunity for foodies to taste a variety of river and sea fish. The preparations, some authentic and some innovative, offer local fish in continental or oriental seasonings. It should go down well with our customers, smiled Mandira.

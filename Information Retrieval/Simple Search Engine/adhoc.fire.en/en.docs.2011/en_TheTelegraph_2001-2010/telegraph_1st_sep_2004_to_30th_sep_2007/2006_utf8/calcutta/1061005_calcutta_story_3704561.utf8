 Experts advise regular security audit

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Realising the importance of information safety, Webel the state governments nodal IT agency has issued instructions to all new business process outsourcing (BPO) units to accord highest priority to security audit.

 Every company which has important client information will always take measures to safeguard it. But how efficient is the system? A security audit at regular intervals is the answer, said Susobhan Chattopadhyay, project in-charge, Webel ISP.

 Security audit assesses how secured is an organisations database and information system. From finding data accessed by employees to checking out customised applications, security audit helps plug gaps in the system.

 With reports of hacking and leaking of mission critical information pouring in, Webel had hired an expert team from IIT Kharagpur to conduct security audits at IT and ITES companies at the states IT hub two years ago. 

 Now, we are telling the companies to focus on their e-security and assess their vulnerability at regular intervals, added Chattopadhyay.

 Not just IT and ITES majors, hospitals, tour operators and banks are conducting security audits to ward off any attack on servers, hard disk drives or desktops from the web or any workstation.

 Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which has clients featuring on the Fortune lists, has an internal team to conduct a security audit. We deal in sensitive data relating to clients and we take utmost care to protect such data, said a TCS official from Mumbai.

 Nasscom, the apex body of IT and ITES companies, is spreading awareness on security audits.

 Data theft from call centres in India is getting publicised. Such publicity may go against the countrys interest. We need a robust regulatory environment and security audit is one of them, said a Nasscom spokesperson.

 As business prospect is linked to the issue of security audit, companies are waking up to the new-age need and earmarking a part of the expenditure budget for security audits.

 India is emerging as an outsourcing hub and so we think security audit should be made mandatory, said Rudra Kamal Sinha Roy, senior security analyst at iViZ Techno Solutions.

 iViZ Techno Solutions a Salt Lake-based company specialising in security audits charges Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 for such exercise and its clientele is growing by the day. Its clients include Peerless Hospital and BNKe-Solutions.

 To make the system fool-proof, firms are even taking help from ethical hackers, who try to penetrate the system to check out its vulnerability.

 We have a team that conducts periodical audit to prevent anybody from misusing the data internally. But to counter an external attack, we hire ethical hackers, confirmed Brigadier Suresh Menon, CEO, BNKe-Solutions.

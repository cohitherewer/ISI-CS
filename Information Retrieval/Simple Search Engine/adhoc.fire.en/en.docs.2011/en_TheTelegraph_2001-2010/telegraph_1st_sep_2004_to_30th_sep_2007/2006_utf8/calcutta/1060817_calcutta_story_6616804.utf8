 Social pressures of modern urban living can cause so much mental fatigue as to drive a person to lose his sanity. Roopkatha tells the story of Swapnamoy Mitra, who falls victim to such a psychological disease. The first symptoms become apparent when he fails to recognise an old friend he meets on the street one day. Then, a woman he clearly does not know, comes to him and says that she was a close friend and that she had been cheated by him. His wife, Deepabali, unaware of his illness, begins to suspect that he is a liar and that he is merely pretending not to recognize old acquaintances. Understanding his condition, a doctor asks Mitra to recall memories of his childhood. Through his reminiscences, he begins to behave like a 16 year-old, developing more complications for him and his family. When his wife gets romantically involved with another man, his alienation leads him to attempt suicide. Finally, he leaves home. His crisis is over only when he meets new people and identifies with their joys and sorrows. Direction: Sekhar Samaddar.

 What: The launch of Gold Bank, a savings scheme by A. Sirkar. Where: The Rashbehari Avenue showroom of A. Sirkar. 

 When: Tuesday evening. 

 The scheme: Launched as a part of the golden jubilee celebrations of the brand, Gold Bank offers unique advantages to investors.

 The scheme enables women to carry on saving gold in monthly instalments, leading to purchase of jewellery at the end of the stipulated time frame. Other than the amount of gold they have saved, they also receive a bonus quantity of gold. 

 For example, investments for a period of 12 months fetch an additional return of .75 gm of gold. With separate schemes for 12, 18, 24 and 36 months, each ensures a different pot of gold.

 The unit of investment could be any multiple of one gm of gold. 

 The idea was to free the customer saving in gold, not cash, of any inflationary pressure by blocking their prices. At the end of the stipulated time, they can purchase jewellery from the Wedding Range, Gift Range or the Casuals Range, explained Chiradeep Sirkar, proprietor of A. Sirkar.

 Star spotting: Actress Roopa Ganguly, the brand ambassador. It s a great scheme for people who want to possess jewellery but dont have the means to invest in a single shot. Moreover, because you block the rate, the amount of money saved due to shooting gold prices seems like extra money earned, smiled Roopa, in a red-and-gold sari. 

 Voiceover: This scheme was born out of customer feedback. We always had people enquiring about instalment schemes and this is the best we have ever come up with. Not only are we safeguarding customers against inflation and acting as a custodian of their gold, we are also gifting them with a bonus, smiled Chiradeep.

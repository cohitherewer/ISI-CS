 Jawan shoots intruder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A CISF jawan trying to save himself from two attackers who attempted to snatch his service revolver shot and killed a 21-year-old youth on Sunday inside Calcutta Port?s gate no. 5.

 Senior police officers, including deputy commissioner of police (port) Ajay Ranade, visited the spot. The unidentified youth was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he died. South Port police station is probing the death.

 ?Apart from the youth that died, there were three others. We are looking for them. The gang members had slipped into the heavily-guarded area, intending to lift a few expensive items,? said Ranade.

 Police said on Sunday afternoon, four local youths had entered the Dock-II compound by scaling the 10-ft-high wall on the eastern side, and crossing over the barbed wire fencing. A garbage dump helped the youths scale the wall.

 ?This is the compound that one enters through gate no. 5, near the approach to Baskel Bridge. There is a CISF camp inside and the road leads to an electrical goods warehouse, where expensive items, including stocks of copper wire, are stored. The CISF jawan spotted them,? said a senior officer of South Port police station.

 The jawan raised an alarm and chased the youth. Two of them dropped whatever goods they had stolen and ran. The other two pounced on the jawan, tried to overpower him and snatch his revolver. 

 The jawan managed to wriggle out and fired. One of the intruders was hit by a bullet, while the other ran away. Jawans informed local police, who took the injured youth to hospital.

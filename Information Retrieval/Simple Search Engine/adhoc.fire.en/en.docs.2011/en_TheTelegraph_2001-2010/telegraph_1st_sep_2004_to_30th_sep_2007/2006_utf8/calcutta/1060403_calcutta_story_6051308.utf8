Scoring for Capote was one of the toughest assignments 

for MYCHAEL DANNA. The ace composer tells Pratim D. Gupta how Trumans 

writing style had an impact on the choice of his notes

Capote

Mychael Danna

What made you take up a project like Capote, 

being made by largely unknown people, after having worked with big names like 

Denzel Washington and Ang Lee?

I worked with the producer Caroline Baron on Monsoon 

Wedding, so we had a history from then. She was very excited about the project. 

So I looked at a few early scenes while they were shooting, and I was totally 

convinced that her excitement was justified.

What kind of research went into the movie, set 

in a certain period and more importantly in the setting of a small town like Kansas?

Musically we didn?t want to use any instruments that 

were anachronistic, that would have jumped out from the period mood that (director) 

Bennett (Miller) was creating. So, we kept to piano and a small string section. 

That said, there is nothing period about the writing at all. I was more concerned 

with the internal life of Capote. His external life of a witty and popular man 

about town is obvious from the picture.

What was the basic brief that Bennett Miller gave 

you before you set about scoring the music for the film?

Our goal was very simple: to create music that would 

be the equivalent of the prose that Capote himself wrote in his work In Cold 

Blood. His writing is clean, simple, perfect... Not one word too many or in 

the wrong place. It is a deceptively simple style. 

It is actually much easier to write music for a big 

orchestra with everyone playing at once, but it is way more difficult to write 

a piece that only has five notes. They have to be exactly in the right place, 

exactly played right, and the perfect notes. 

So, what were the primary emotions that you tried 

to bring out in those few notes?

The music is concerned with several things? Creating 

the sense of the call to Capote from this tragic event that happened so far away 

from his life in NYC. A very personal thing that his friends didn?t understand, 

so the music had to be very internal, something that gave the impression that 

only he could hear it. 

Then there is the sense of fate pushing everything 

to a foregone and tragic conclusion; again very, very subtle, not a drum beat 

or anything, but just this circular pattern from the strings that gives that impression. 

Finally there was the sense of recognition, even love, 

that Capote felt in Perry Smith. The rest of the music is very icy and atmospheric, 

but this theme is increasingly warmer and the emotional heart of the film. Overall 

though, the music is very stark, like the cold Kansas prairie landscapes, and 

the autumnal colours that Bennett captured in the cinematography.

Did you read the Truman Capote biography on which 

the film is based or his books or watch In Cold Blood for reference work?

I didn?t watch the film for reference although I had 

seen it before, but I knew it had nothing to do with what we were trying to accomplish. 

The book In Cold Blood on the other hand was absolutely central to our 

goal and I was amazed by the writing. 

It would be impossible to translate. Which is why 

I don?t think Capote is very well known outside of America. I?m not even sure 

if it translates out of American into English! I think it gave me the best insight 

into the man and his work, better than any biography.

What was the most special thing about your music 

and your experience of working in Capote?

It was a very difficult film to write for, and I think 

everyone involved felt the obligation to give everything they had to make a profound 

film. The fact is, writing and working at that level is not fun, it?s actually 

rather painful, and I think we all felt that pain! But the reward is a film where 

all the elements are pretty much perfect and that is a very rare accomplishment, 

and one I am very proud to be a part of.

When you were writing the background score how 

much of an impact did Philip Seymour Hoffman?s Oscar-winning act have on you?

I knew that he went through the same struggle that 

I was going through to get to the place of his outstanding performance, and so 

I was inspired to try to reach as deeply in and reach as high as I could. When 

I met him I realised he was seemingly completely opposite in every way to the 

character he was playing in the film, and didn?t even look anything like the person 

on the screen, so I was all the more knocked out by his work.

Mychael Danna is one of the top composers in Hollywood 

having scored the music for films like The Perfect Storm, 8 MM, 

Kama Sutra, Girl, Interrupted, Monsoon Wedding, The Antwone 

Fisher Story, Vanity Fair and Being Julia.

Life

 A Beatles BLAST from the past

 PAUL MCCARTNEY, RINGO STARR AND GEORGE MARTIN ON LOVE, A SOUNDTRACK COMPILATION ALBUM BY THE BEATLES RELEASED LAST MONTH

 The album features music compiled and remixed for the Cirque du Soleil show. It was produced by George Martin and his son Giles. Heres what the remaining Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and George Martin had to say.

 Paul McCartney: We started off as four kids in Liverpool and we grew together, we evolved together and each year was different. So now its just another year.

 Ringo Starr: The music still carries on. The kids will listen to our music. The songs are strong and the music is solid, you know. So thats why it carries on. Its not our personalities, its the music. 

 George Martin: The Beatles are the best, theres no doubt about it... and they are iconic. I think they are the classical music of our time. I think people will still be listening to what weve been doing in 50 years time. 

 Ringo: George knows our music and George has the credibility and the honesty. And, you know, weve spent a lot of time together and we trust him. He has our trust to do this job... If you just want to play one track to see what its all about Within you without you has got the Tomorrow never knows drums underneath it, which it never had before. So I loved it.

 George: It follows in the line of The Beatles development, you know they have always looked for other ways of expressing themselves.

 Paul: I think we were all amazed at how well it worked. Partly because they did a great job but, partly, because we did too on the original recordings. When I heard the show in Las Vegas and heard the sound quality, I was blown away cause Im listening and thinking: Wow! That snare drum! I cant believe it. I mean its just so clear, its so original. You just dont hear snare drums like that, you know. The strings off Eleanor Rigby... its just like wow you know. Its beautifully recorded and, you know, Im not being immodest to say that we played it well. We had a great team in... The Beatles was a great team. So its four pretty good heads on a piece of music but then we had a great production team.

 George: And I think in fact that if Id had more than four tracks when I was recording Sergeant Pepper I dont think it would have been any better than it turned out. I think the music itself is so good that no matter what you did with it, providing you did it reasonably technically well, it would have survived.

 Ringo: You know I love that were re-enhancing the Beatles music. Youve got the others if you want em, but this is new Its a new experience you know I think the incredible situation with The Beatles is that they still sound now you know. And theres still a lot of bands out there trying to sound like them but you know I think the greatest gift we left was this incredible music that is relevant today, and you know it sounds like today. What a band! What a band! Great! Lets Go! Peace and love.

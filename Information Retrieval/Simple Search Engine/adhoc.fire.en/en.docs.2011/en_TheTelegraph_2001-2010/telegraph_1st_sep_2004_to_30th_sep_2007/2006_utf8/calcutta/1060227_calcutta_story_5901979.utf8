The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Where life is a beach

Screen On amp; Off

 A scene from Vittorio De Sica?s Bicycle Thief

 This is a beach party where instead of booze you bring films, not that you can?t bring the former along as well. In fact, anything goes. You can come with paintings, photographs and guitar, or simply with a thirst for good cinema. The Bring Your Own Film Festival (BYOFF), organised for the third consecutive year, concluded in Puri on Friday. 

 ?This five-day event has no selectors or awards. Since it was conceived by a group of film-makers, it is the way a film-maker wants a festival to be,? Gurpal Singh told Metro from Puri. An FTII graduate, Singh was one of the founding members and says there is nothing like chilling out on the beach, away from the confines of the city. ?One can do anything one likes ? watch films, lie on the sand discussing films, go for a swim, even have a fist fight with another film-maker,? laughs Singh.

 The festival was originally meant to be a travelling one but its first venue Pink House Hotel has been a perfect fit. ?Screenings are held in a tent from 3 pm to 5.30 pm and on a large screen from 6.30 pm to 2 am. Between 5.30 and 6.30 pm there are folk performances or shows by local groups. As many writers and artists turn up, we have exhibitions and impromptu presentations. And all this integrates the sound of sea waves,? said Singh.

 There are no restrictions in the kind of films being shown and there are no last dates. So it is often impossible to know till the last minute what will be shown. So how does one ensure quality? ?We don?t,? said Singh. ?There are no hierarchies here and our most enthusiastic participants are first-time directors for whom this is an important trial run. Sure a lot of trash turns up but which festival doesn?t have it in greater or lesser doses??

 This time there were 150 films and more than 350 delegates including artists and enthusiasts of every genre. Joining the young film-makers and students (FTII, SRFTI, NID) were foreign film-makers and a rock group from Calcutta. Baba Black Beard by Sanghamitra, which has already won the silver conch at Mumbai International Film Festival, Me, Meera by Subhakar, Countdown by Shyamal Sengupta (ex-dean, SRFTI) and 29 Minutes of Loneliness by Calcutta?s Sharmi Sen were some of the films screened.

 This year, BYOFF did a first by screening eight classics like Vittorio de Sica?s Bicycle Thief, Satyajit Ray?s Charulata and Majid Majidi?s Children of Heaven at the local Town Hall, which ran housefull on all days.

 Funds for BYOFF come partly from member contributions and partly from sponsors. There is a screening fee of Rs 200-300 and Rs 250 for entry and dinner on all days. ?BYOFF leaves participants charged. Debutantes gain confidence and many volunteer to be organisers. There are film-makers who make films just to be in time for a BYOFF screening,? said Mukut Roy Chaudhury of Inscreen, a Bhubaneswar-based film society which supports BYOFF.

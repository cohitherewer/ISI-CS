 Wake up at 4 am, step into the boxing ring by the break of dawn and sweat it out there for the next few hours. For most aspiring young boxers, this schedule would be followed by some rest and a heavy breakfast. 

 But these are luxuries that Ram Sahani cannot afford. Instead, the 15-year-old heads for the Taltala market to sell fish and eke out a living.

 Ram came to Calcutta when he was 10 as his parents back in Patna could not afford his education. But hopes of studying in a city school were soon dashed and he had to lend his uncle a helping hand in his fish stall.

 Then, boxing turned Ram?s life around. ?Around four years ago, while I was walking down the road, I saw a few boys boxing in the ring. I stood and watched them for a while and felt I could do this with ease. I decided to pursue boxing,? recalls Ram.

 And the results of his efforts are beginning to show. The young boxer managed a bronze for Bengal in the 21st Junior National Boxing Championship 2005-2006, held in Noida last year. Now, he is happy he did not choose any other sport, because he would not have been able to afford it.

 ?Ram is a very talented young boxer and, thankfully, his financial status is not yet a major impediment in pursuing his favourite sport,? feels Asim Das, secretary of the Bengal Amateur Boxing Federation.

 Ram?s daily schedule sounds almost impossible. Waking up at 4 am at his one-room shelter in Sealdah?s Lebutala area, the youngster leaves at dawn for the School of Physical Culture, at Raja Subodh Mullick Square. After two gruelling hours in the ring, he is at the Taltala market, setting up his uncle?s fish stall.

 Till 2 pm, he is busy serving customers, after which he heads home for lunch. By 4 pm, he is back in the boxing ring. Ram hardly has any energy left after the long hours spent in the boxing ring and the fish market, but the thought of being a school dropout bothers the teenager. ?I would really like to pursue my education. I do not want to regret it later,? he confesses.

 But the hardships have only strengthened his resolve to beat the odds. ?My dream is to represent the country in the Olympics. I don?t know when, and if at all, that will happen. But I do not see myself hanging up my gloves,? is the knockout punch from the determined youth.

 AGM, poll stayed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Academy of Fine Arts managed to avert trouble on Friday as a city court intervened and restrained the proposed annual general meeting (AGM) and the election for the new executive committee.

 In its order, the court restrained the proposed AGM and the election slated to be held on Friday till disposal of the petition for temporary injunction. Police had to intervene so that the Academy grounds did not turn into a battleground of the warring members of the committee. 

 Fearing trouble, I conveyed the courts order to police and asked them to see to it that no damage is done to the Academys properties, said Ashoke Mukherjee, chairman of the Academys trustee board, custodian of the properties of one of the citys oldest culture hubs.

 A team from Hastings police station reached the spot and stopped people from entering the Academy. A scuffle broke out among police and some members of the executive committee when they tried to enter the conference hall, where the AGM and the election were scheduled to be held.

 Later, the executive committee gave a written declaration to police that the AGM and the poll would not be held. Honouring the courts order, we didnt hold the AGM and the election today, said Asoke Krishna Dutta, president of the executive committee.

 We sent a team there. Forces were deployed so that the law was not flouted by anybody. We are keeping a watch on the situation there, which is now under control, said a senior officer of Hastings police station.

 The courts order vindicates our stand. We hope now the executive committee will hold the AGM and the election in a proper manner, said Pradipta Kanungo, executive committee vice-president.

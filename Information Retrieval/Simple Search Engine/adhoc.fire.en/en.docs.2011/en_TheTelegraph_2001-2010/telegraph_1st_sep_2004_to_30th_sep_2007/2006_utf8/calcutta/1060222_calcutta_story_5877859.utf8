The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 After music, printed word

 - National book chain, set for Puja launch, to follow tune store model 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 From melody magic to book buzz. After its tryst with tunes, in the form of MusicWorld, changed the way Calcutta shops for its favourite songs, RPG Enterprises is now readying its book-retail format, Books amp; Beyond, for a Puja launch.

 ?Yes, we are looking at a new national retail chain to be driven primarily by books and Calcutta is the obvious choice for takeoff, since it?s the biggest market for books in the country and there?s still a yawning gap,? RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka told Metro on Tuesday.

 The first flagship outlet of Books amp; Beyond will come up on Rashbehari Avenue opposite Triangular Park in a G+3 property that will also house the group?s Spencer?s Hypermarket on the ground and first floors.

 ?Books amp; Beyond, with its extremely fun and trendy feel, will be much more than just books. It will have myriad items on the racks to light up the leisure hours,? promised Goenka. The chain will follow the same growth model as MusicWorld, with Express outlets and bestseller gondolas dotting city retail spaces for penetration.

 ?The Rashbehari store will be to get our feet wet in the business of books. It?s a high-footfall zone and we are reasonably confident of doing well,? said Sumantra Banerjee, president amp; chief executive, retail group, RPG Enterprises.

 The group, which has already tied up over 200,000 sq ft of retail space in Calcutta, is also shifting its corporate headquarters from Chennai to Duncan House in BBD Bag around April. ?With our entire retail and merchandising team working out of Calcutta, backend logistics will become so much simpler,? Goenka pointed out.

 Banerjee felt the migration would also power the group?s third-quarter launch of the hypermarket format, with its basket of fruits and vegetables, staples, chill amp; frozen, bakery, FMCG food and non-food, garments and linens, shoes and luggage and homeware.

 ?The four Spencer?s Hypermarket outlets planned (at Triangular Park, Mani Square on the EM Bypass, South City on Prince Anwar Shah Road and Rajarhat) will anchor the cluster format on our food retail roadmap,? he observed.

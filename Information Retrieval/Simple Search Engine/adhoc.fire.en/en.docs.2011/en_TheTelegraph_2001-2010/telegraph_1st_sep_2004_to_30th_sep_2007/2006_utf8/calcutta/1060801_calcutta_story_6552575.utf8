 The City Diary

 Sergeant Deepak Lakra of the Reserve Force has been dismissed from service, with effect from July 27, for misconduct. A departmental inquiry was ordered against him five months ago. On February 5, Snehasish Das, a Behala resident, had lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station, alleging that Lakra had tried to extort Rs 5,000 from him after taking a ride in his car from the Bowbazar-CR Avenue crossing to Madan Street. That was around 4 in the morning. Das and his wife were on their way to Behala after attending a party in Barrackpore. Das had alleged that when he refused to cough up the money, Lakra tried to drag him and his wife into a wireless police van that was following the car.

 Six men were arrested in Liluah and Sankrail, in Howrah, on Sunday on charges of stealing a zinc-laden truck on Shibpur Drainage Canal Road on July 15. Police said the truck was on its way to Zinc Corporation of India?s Taratala factory, when it was intercepted by the criminals, who dragged out the driver and his help. The driver and the help, too, were arrested. Goods worth Rs 30 lakh were recovered from various godowns during a daylong raid. 

 The detective department on Monday arrested six persons in two hotels on Free School Street on charges of duping a few youths by promising them jobs in the railway. Police said some members of the gang are from Delhi, Patna and Aurangabad, while one is a resident of Behala. A probe revealed the gang took anything between Rs 60,000 and Rs 1 lakh from a job-seeker. Some fake marksheets were seized from them.

 Pranab Ghosh and Biswajit Das, who had allegedly assaulted a youth and threw him off from a running train at Hridaypur station in June last year, were arrested by a team from Barasat police station on Sunday. Police said 3.5 kg of opium was found in their possession. Police had been looking for the two ever since the train incident was reported in Metro. 

 The city and its adjoining areas experienced intermittent power cuts on Monday evening, as the shortfall in the CESC-served areas increased to 75 MW. The state electricity board supplied about 236 MW in the evening. CESC?s own units generated 970 MW. 

 CESC will carry out repairs on the 6-KV switch board at the Belur distribution station on Tuesday. Power supply will be affected in the Belur, Ghusuri, Naskar Para and Girish Ghosh Road areas in Howrah between 10 am and 12.30 pm.

 A Druk Air flight from Calcutta to Paro, in Bhutan, made an emergency landing at Calcutta airport on Monday morning. The flight, with 61 passengers on board, took off at 9.56 am. Minutes later, the pilot suspected a snag. The plane returned and landed safely at 10.07 am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next car park under Chaplin Park

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A third automated car park, much bigger than the earlier two, is likely to come up in the heart of the central business district to address the perennial problem of parking.

 According to the proposal of a joint venture between Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and a private partner, the plaza will be constructed beneath Chaplin Park, off the CMC headquarters.

 The plan for the automated parking lot is to accommodate 1,000 cars. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 60 crore.

 The private partner will be Simplex Projects Limited, which was involved in the earlier two automated car parks on Rawdon Street and under Lindsay Street.

 After witnessing the trial run of ?the country?s first fully-automated underground parking lot? under Lindsay Street on Monday, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay directed chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose to submit a report on the feasibility of creating a similar, but bigger, facility under Chaplin Park. 

 Bandyopadhyay was accompanied by former councillor Provakar Mondol and councillor Sheila Kapoor on his inspection of the Lindsay Street parking lot, the opening of which has been stalled by protests from New Market traders with political backing.

 The CMC has created roadside parking space for 4,200 cars, but that falls far short of the peak-hour demand on weekdays. According to deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim, the city urgently needs parking space for 26,000 more cars.

 Though the initial plan for the Chaplin Park project had envisaged six to 10 layers, civil engineers in the CMC and Simplex feel that a 10-storeyed underground structure is not feasible, as the soil is not strong enough to support a structure that goes down 114 feet. The Metro Railway tunnel is just about 30-35 feet.

 An option the civic engineers are exploring is restricting the depth, but extending the car park?s width beyond Chaplin Park, up to the CMC headquarters or the new New Market. That would help park around 1,000 cars.

 The Rawdon Street Parkomat has been operational for around three years. It came up at a cost of Rs 9 crore and can accommodate 210 cars.

 The one under Lindsay Street has seen an investment of Rs 33 crore and has space for 281 vehicles. In the first phase, facilities for parking 50 cars have been readied and trial runs are on since June-end.

 ?The Rawdon Street project is working well,? said B.K. Mundra, chairman of Simplex Projects Limited. ?It is only a matter of months before the Lindsay Street project becomes fully operational. Hence, we are ready for a tie-up with the CMC for setting up a third hi-tech parking plaza anywhere in the city.?

 A company official said the annual turnover at the Rawdon Street car park was around Rs 20 lakh. According to the agreement, Simplex will run the project for 20 years before transferring it to the civic authorities.

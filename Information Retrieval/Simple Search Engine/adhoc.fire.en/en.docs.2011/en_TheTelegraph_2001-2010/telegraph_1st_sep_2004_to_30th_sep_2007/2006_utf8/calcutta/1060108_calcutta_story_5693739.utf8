The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Sunderbans

 Late at night, the tiger had started growling. Muktar Hussein, our guide, said it was a male calling out for a mate. The intermittent roars continued through the rest of the night. Before daybreak, we got up and sat on the launch deck to see the tiger. But the sandhead and the mangrove was all that was visible in the first flush of dawn.

 We had set out from Kalas eco-camp and moored near the Kalas Island the previous afternoon. Soon after, a group of fishermen arrived in their powerboats. We followed them to the island. Near the sweet water pond dug by the forest department there were hoof marks of deer and two boars with large tusks. But what thrilled us the most were the pugmarks of a Royal Bengal Tiger on the soft ground.

 The fishermen and Muktar said the marks were fresh and advised us to return to the safety of the launch. We remembered the words of an ex-bureaucrat who had spent a number of years in the Sunderbans. When we had met him before the trip, he had alerted us to the dangers lurking in the wilderness and said though the Royal Bengal Tiger is seldom sighted, its never too far away. 

 This month is the best time to visit the Sunderbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world and a world heritage site cohabited by tigers, estuarine crocodiles and human beings. We had expected a great deal while driving to Raidighi from the city and heading for the eco-camp in the launch. We were not disappointed.

 The Sunderbans ecosystem does not have a parallel in the world. The maze of islands is surrounded by vast stretches of water. The tidal creeks separate habitats as diverse as channel sands, intertidal mudflats and mangrove forests that provide shelter to innumerable species of animals. Of them, the ever elusive Royal Bengal Tiger reigns supreme.

 After the night of our aural tryst with the beast, we sailed for Haliday Island. It is the winter nesting and breeding spot of Olive Ridley Turtles. We were in for another disappointment. We did not see a single turtle, though the soothing green of the mangrove delta and the tranquility more than made up for the journey.

 The archipelago of 108 islands holds visitors spellbound, but life is hard for the locals. Food is scarce, so much so that the tigers venture into villages to feed on livestock. Going into the forests is dangerous. Fishermen and honey collectors are regularly mauled by maneaters.

 Moving towards Netadhopani we entered one of the most dense parts of the Sunderbans. Birds like Mangrove Whistlers frolicked on the sandheads as colourful kingfishers dived in and out of the water. But we were looking for the estuarine crocodiles.

 Close to Netadhopani, our motorman Suresh excitedly asked us to see left. A tiger was crossing the river. It was swift and beautiful. In a flash the blur of yellow had vanished into the forest by the Dakshinrai river. We were too stunned to take photographs.

 At Netadhopani, we made our way to the watchtower along a path protected by a steel net. We spent an hour with the forest guards, but tigers were nowhere to be seen. There we met a man called Gagan Majhi, who has become an exhibit for tourists after surviving a tiger attack, the deep scars on his back a reminder of how lucky he was.

 We anchored at Dobanki for the night. Boys, girls and ladies were standing in knee-deep water to catch shrimps. Muktar told us that poverty had driven them to such a risky task. Risky, because every creek and river in the area is infested with estuarine crocodiles. The giant reptiles are not averse to attacking humans as is evident from the number of limbless villagers around.

 The day broke to the calls of thousands of birds that had congregated around the river. There were Spoon-billed Sandpipers sifting mud for food, green parrots in flight and even singing cuckoos. The mudflats and sand banks were a carpet of crabs of different shapes and sizes.

 We sailed through the deep forest towards Sudhanyakhali. This was tiger territory. We were watching a large family of storks on a tree when Muktar drew our attention to a point near the bank. Initially, we did not see anything, but a closer inspection revealed two nostrils above the water. A crocodile was floating by. It moved away before long, but round a bend, there was a huge one sunning on a sandhead.

 The watchtower at Sudhanyakhali was once again protected by a steel net. The dense forest of sundari, hetal, garan and garjan is home to several tigers but not one came out in the open for us. Our disappointment was somewhat assuaged by a fleeting glimpse of the rare fishing cat. We also saw a large iguana.

 Bali Island was our next stop. After spending a quiet night, we reached Sajnekhali on our last day in the Sunderbans. After checking into the tourist lodge, we visited the Mangrove Interpretation Centre and the crocodile and turtle pond. In the afternoon, we went to Pakhiralaya, the bird sanctuary. It was full of migratory birds from Europe and Central Asia.

 Going 

 Calcutta is the gateway to the Sunderbans. The nature of the terrain does not allow exploration by land. It has to be toured by boat or launch. Several operators conduct tours to the Sunderbans. Some of them are West Bengal Tourism Centre (22485919), Help Tourism (24550917), Pugmark Nature Resort and Himan Chura Travels and Tours. Otherwise, you can hire a launch. It is wise to go in a group of at least four people. Hire a guide from the tour operators

 Staying

 Some of the options are Sajnekhali tourist lodge (West Bengal Tourism Centre), Sunderban Jungle Camp (Help Tourism) and Sunderban Tiger Camp

 Permit

 Indian tourists can obtain permits from The Field Director, Sunderban Tiger Reserve, P.O. Canning, South 24-Parganas

 Behind the scenes

 H e?s a straying husband of today in Dosor slated for a Poila Baisakh release, and he will become Yudhisthir when Rituparno Ghosh?s ambitious epic narrative Draupadi rolls with a huge star cast later this year. Then there?s a slew of masala films with the Swapan Sahas and Haranath Chakrabortys of the world. But what has engaged Prosenjit presently more than anything else is his production company, Ideas. 

 The leading man of Tollywood is now geared up to play a major role backstage, and with a count of five to six films a year, he has found the time to spend on what he wants ? getting involved with the pre and post-production of films under his banner.

 Teen Yari Katha, the first feature film from Ideas in joint venture with Sahara One Motion Pictures, will test the waters when it releases sometime in May-June. 

 ?It?s a different kind of film, which is entertaining yet not run-of-the-mill. It revolves around three aimless young boys who surprise everybody when given a chance to prove themselves. It?s very contemporary, something today?s youths will relate to? We will try and send it to the festivals,? says the king of potboilers who is equally clued into the changing tastes and needs of the young cine-goer. 

 ?At Ideas, we will try and assess the aspects where changes can be brought in. The Bengali film industry has to evolve in order to survive. The college-going crowd in the suburbs frowns on Bengali potboilers these days; they are exposed to trendy Hindi films. I want to make films that will cater to the multiplex audiences,? he adds.

 If this sounds like building castles in the air, it is not. The actor has already got his ground work done, and up on the list are ?four to five films? for this year. 

 ?We will get some new directors and new actors. We will work out in a way that we don?t lose money and we will push the films for multiplexes. For the expenses, I will have to invest my earnings.? 

 Of course, Rituparno tops the list of directors lined up by Ideas. ?We will do a film with Ritu because branding is very important for the company,? he explains.

 Robbarer Bioscope, a jazzed-up telefilm series commissioned by Zee Bangla which is being executed by Ideas, has already given Prosenjit a first-hand feel of the nitty-gritty of production details. That apart, the series is also giving him the chance to observe the work of several new telefilm directors from close quarters. Of them, Atanu Ghosh has caught his eye. 

 ?He is very promising. He should be given a chance to make a feature film... In fact, both I and Ritu monitor their work and are on the lookout for fresh talents. I want newcomers with bright ideas,? stresses Prosenjit.

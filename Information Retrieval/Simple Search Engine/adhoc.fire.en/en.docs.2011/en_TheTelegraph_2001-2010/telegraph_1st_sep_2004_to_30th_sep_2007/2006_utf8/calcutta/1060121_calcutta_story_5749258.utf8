 Two productions from the city have been nominated for a first of its kind stage excellence awards in the country. Ranan?s Crossings and Rangakarmee?s Sarhad Paar Manto have earned nominations for the first Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards (META). Instituted by the Mahindra and Mahindra Group on the lines of the Tony Awards, the awards are dedicated solely to theatre.

 The eight plays nominated from the Hindi and English stage circuits include two productions each from Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Bangalore ? one in the category of established theatre, the other in emerging theatre.

 Crossings has been selected in the first category and Sarhad Paar Manto in the second.

 A festival showcasing the eight plays will be held in Delhi from February 6-9. Crossings will be staged in the inaugural evening and Sarhad Paar Manto on February 7.

 On February 10, awards will be given away in a range of categories including best play/production, best direction, actor, actress, playwright, lighting design, sound track, costume, set design, adapted work, and supporting actor and actress. 

 The grand jury to confer the awards includes Shashi Kapoor, Shabana Azmi, Jaya Bachchan, Soumitra Chatterjee and Amol Palekar. 

 Crossings, a dance-theatre piece, weaves in various dance forms like kathak, Bharatanatyam and Manipuri alongside text-based drama to explore some aspects of Shakespeare?s Lady Macbeth. 

 The project was conceived and directed by Vikram Iyengar. It has toured eastern India, Kerala, London and the Wales.

 Sarhad Paar Manto by Rangakarmee is one of a three-part series on Urdu writer Saadat Hasan Manto. The play has been scripted, narrated and directed by Usha Ganguli combining two of Manto?s stories ? Khol Do and Toba Tek Singh. 

 Both stories harp on the turmoil, torture and torment that the Partition had brought in its wake.

 A moment from Swabak rsquo;s Shasti

 Down south, the land of backwaters and beaches has beckoned a Calcutta troupe to showcase its production. Swabak will stage Shasti (The Punishment) at the Silver Jubilee National Theatre Festival at Thrissur, starting February 11 at Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi. 

 To be inaugurated by theatre veteran Ratan Thiyam, the festival will host troupes from across the country and a variety of performances, workshops and seminars.

 Shasti, an Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre entry from Bengal, will be staged on February 16, to be followed by an interaction with director Neelima Chakravarti. 

 The Rabindranath Tagore play takes a look at the status of women in a family of two poor farmer brothers and their wives in 19th century Bengal under British rule.

Life

 A den of dreams

 Vibrant hues, pretty 

 prints, flowy drapes, comfy cushions and nostalgia define 

 a single womans pad. Shradha Agarwal explores 

 the look 

 HOUSE 

 PROUD

 Comfy cushions. Dreamy drapes. 

 Fresh flowers. Practical, neat and clean, and not to miss 

 the unmissable, signature fragrance. Welcome to a real home. 

 Not just any home though, the pants in this house are worn 

 by the sole dweller ? a single woman, very happy and very 

 much in charge.

 A closer look under the prettiness 

 and the softness reveals another, stronger side. A sturdy 

 security system (maybe a video-door-phone), maximum space 

 utilisation that is evident in each nook and functionality 

 ? all merging well into the beauty aspects. GoodLife 

 tells you more.

 Bedroom basic

 Her bedroom almost tells 

 the story of her life. That explains at least one corner 

 of her childhood articles, stuffed toys, baby pictures or 

 educational degrees, says interior designer Karan 

 Jain. 

 Colour, he adds, sets the basic 

 mood of a single womans home. It could be a 

 rainbow riot on the walls, paisleys on her draped curtains, 

 multi-coloured stripes on her cushion covers or a collage 

 of family pictures ? colour is the first thing that stands 

 out in a single womans home.

 Personal corners, some green plants, 

 lots of family photographs and candles characterise the 

 room further.

 Interior consultant Meenakshi 

 Dutta says: The bed should be queen-sized. Single 

 beds are so hostel-like.

 Brighten up the bed with vibrant 

 bedspreads and lots of fluffy cushions. Dont forget 

 the multi-purpose table by the bedside, to hold everything 

 from the mobile phone, alarm clock, water, medicines to 

 the current read.

 Dressing do 

 A bathroom and dressing area is 

 a single womans favourite zone. Away from mundane 

 and dull bathroom interiors, she does up this space in bright 

 and bold hues. Cheerful shower curtains, co-ordinated towels 

 and bathroom sets, a bathroom scale, a vibrant laundry bag, 

 lots of lighting and a large mirror are essentials in the 

 bathroom. You can indulge in some bath salts and aroma-therapy 

 products and candles.

 Daily beauty products and 

 before and after-bath care essentials can be placed in a 

 tray inside the bathroom. Also, a plastic or a wooden seating 

 area is common near the bath area, says Meenakshi. 

 A dry dressing area is preferred 

 if space permits. Dont forget the full-length mirror. 

 Coming to cupboards, a single woman enjoys the liberty of 

 non-shared closet space. But space, especially for a woman, 

 can never be adequate. Here are Meenakshis wardrobe 

 planning tips on getting most out of the space.

 Divide your clothes into work 

 wear, party ensembles and casual wear. 

 Keep a locked drawer for 

 important bank documents, passport, precious jewellery and 

 extra cash.

 Keep another drawer allotted 

 for expensive perfumes and stocked beauty goodies. 

 Store the bags neatly 

 in the topmost or the last shelf.

 Stash the lingerie, exercise 

 gear and nightwear on a separate shelf. 

 Keep the footwear in a 

 separate cabinet.

 Chill-out zone 

 The weekly girls night-out 

 apart, most women enjoy the comfort of hanging out at home. 

 The living area then forms an essential element at home. 

 The same drawing area acts as a lounge, reading room 

 or a party place ? the set-up has to be flexible, 

 says Karan. 

 Go for a sofa-cum-bed if you feel 

 the need for this zone to double as a guestroom. 

 Fancy technology and surround 

 systems are often not her idea of investment. A television 

 and a simple music system are a single womans best 

 friends, acting as instant pick-me-ups, says Meenakshi. 

 Karan lists some other important 

 features of a single womans den: 

 The furniture is low, 

 sunk-in and fuss-free. 

 Lots of large cushions 

 scattered around double as cosy seaters on the floor. 

 Bright and happy prints 

 ? as curtains, cushion-covers, runners or throws. 

 Set the mood with uplighters 

 and tall lamps. 

 Aroma candles in various 

 hues and shapes make for effective and inexpensive accents.

 Other curios and family 

 pictures add colour and personal charm.

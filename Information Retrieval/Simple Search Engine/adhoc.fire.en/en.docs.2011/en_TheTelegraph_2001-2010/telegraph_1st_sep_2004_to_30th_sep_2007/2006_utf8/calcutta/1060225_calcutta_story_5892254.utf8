 Plea to parents

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The first day of Madhyamik 2006 passed off minus any major complaint from students. Friday?s examination was Paper I of the First Language. 

 To ensure that students do not suffer from exam-related stress, the authorities of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education issued a fresh appeal to all guardians, requesting them to ?cooperate? with their wards and not ?pressure? them unnecessarily.

 ?It is our earnest appeal to parents not to interfere in their wards? preparations unnecessarily and also not to force them to study for long hours,? Board president Ujwal Basu said in the appeal.

 The Board is paying special attention to ensure that students take the tests in ?a relaxed state of mind?, in view of the increasing number of suicides by examinees of major school-leaving examinations.

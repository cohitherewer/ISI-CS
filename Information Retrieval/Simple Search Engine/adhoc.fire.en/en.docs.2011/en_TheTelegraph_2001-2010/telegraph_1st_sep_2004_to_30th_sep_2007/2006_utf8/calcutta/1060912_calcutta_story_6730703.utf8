The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Expressway toll plaza turns private

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the Vidyasagar Setu toll plaza, its the turn of the one on Barrackpore-Kalyani Expressway to go private.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which has built the 35-km road from Sodepur to Kalyani, has handed over the toll plaza at Barrackpore to Pioneer Cooperative Car Parking Servicing and Construction Society Limited. The company started operating the toll plaza on Monday.

 According to an agreement between Pioneer and the CMDA, the company will pay Rs 70,000 daily to the government agency and meet the maintenance and modernisation expenditure of the toll plaza. The toll rate has also been fixed by the CMDA.

 Cycles, two-wheelers, handcarts, rickshaws, rickshaw vans, government vehicles, ambulances and fire tenders have been exempted from paying the toll.

 We had invited tenders from companies interested in operating the toll plaza and selected Pioneer as it offered the highest price. It will operate the toll plaza and bear all expenses for the purpose, stated CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 After toll collection on Vidyasagar Setu failed to rise to the estimated level, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), which is responsible for maintaining the Setu and its approach roads, handed over the plaza to a private company, SMSL-IRD (JV), against an agreement to pay Rs 100 crore over five years. 

 The HRBC never earned more than Rs 10 crore a year from the toll plaza. By handing over its operation to the company, it has ensured double income without any investment.

 As on Vidyasagar Setu, some vehicles using the expressway evade toll by bribing the employees manning the plaza.

 We have just followed the Setus example. It is not possible to earn much revenue from the toll plaza at Kalyani Expressway using the government infrastructure. After handing it over to the private party, a fixed income is guaranteed, said a senior CMDA officer.

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Thailand-based Digital Asia School of Animation (DASA) is all set to open its second Indian campus, after Mumbai, in Calcutta.

 The institute has tied up with city-based Overseas Consultants, an organisation that brings in institutes of higher education from abroad for setting up campuses here.

 DASA will offer various courses in animation, gaming, virtual reality and special effects.

 ?We are ready to start classes from June. We will offer two types of courses ? one of six-month duration and the other of a year?s, which will include internship in Bangkok. Initially, there will be 30 seats, which will be increased on the basis of demand,?? said Sagarika Bhattacharya, spokesperson for Overseas Consultants.

 The fees will range from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh, depending on the subject. ?Though the course fees seem high, those who will pass out from the school will earn a lot by joining an animation firm or running their own business,? Bhattacharya added.

 According to DASA officials, there is a huge market for animation, special effects and related subjects across the world. Hollywood and the Japanese entertainment industry are looking at India to outsource animation and special effects work.

 Besides, the Indian market for animation is growing so rapidly that almost all the studios in the country are eyeing expansion.

 ?As the market is expanding fast, there is a huge demand for trained and skilled personnel. We will provide courses in state-of-the-art animation, special effects, game development and virtual reality development. We will produce high-class animators, who will be trained by national and international experts through the most sophisticated technology,?? said DASA?s chief executive officer in India Sanjay Bardhan.

 ?We have chosen Calcutta because the city has witnessed a rapid growth of the IT industry. In Calcutta, we can cater to students from the entire eastern region,?? he added.

 Bhattacharya said the curriculum and course material will be framed in a way that the students will be able to tackle every challenge after entering the profession.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Maharaj of 

 marketing

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It 

 is one of those funny stories that provoke a thought. The 

 story is about a beggar. That particular day, he had been 

 begging since the morning in front of the biggest place 

 of prayer in the city. His bowl was empty when the sun finally 

 called it a day. Tired, hungry, he slowly left the hallowed 

 precincts and started walking through the city. It was mid-evening 

 when he reached the gates of a prestigious social club, 

 and decided to take a breather. He saw a car coming out 

 of the club and out of sheer habit he uttered his lines 

 seeking alms. The car slowed down, a hand came out and a 

 few hundred rupee notes were thrown at him. The car whizzed 

 past leaving him stunned. He took a closer look at the cash 

 in hand. With tears in his eyes, he looked skywards and 

 muttered ? Ishwar, tumi thako kothay aar amare pathao 

 kothay (Almighty, you stay in one place and send me 

 to another).

 Strangely, I was reminded of this 

 story when I read a report in The Telegraph last 

 week. The headline screamed ? ?Pay amp; Chappell way is 

 yours?. It was about The Australian International Sports 

 Academy (AISA) offering a patented package of a 14-day residential 

 cricket coaching conducted all year around at a resort near 

 Brisbane. The target group is boys of 12 to 20 years of 

 age. The package comes at a price of 2,500 Australian dollars. 

 There is another 400 Australian dollars added on as discounted 

 air-fare to and from Brisbane. The coaching package, the 

 story told us, ?involves running, swimming, games and cricket 

 training sessions peppered with sight-seeing and lectures?. 

 For less than a lakh of rupees, doting fathers could send 

 their sons for an Australian holiday, which is literally 

 fun and games. This is the product on sale that is branded 

 the Chappell way.

 The journalist informed us that 

 AISA is a private company in which Greg Chappell , the current 

 Team India coach, has a stake. That is understandable as 

 the coaching method that lies at the heart of the brand 

 has been developed by him. Ian Frazer, the bio mechanist, 

 is his partner in AISA. Tony Dell, a director of AISA, was 

 quoted in the story saying: ?Right now, our focus is largely 

 India. The growing spending power of the middle class there 

 is a big draw? So far we have had two groups of 14 youngsters 

 from The Kiran More International Sports Academy. Kiran 

 has been here himself. He shares a special relationship 

 with Greg and it is great.?

 What do all these add up to? Greg 

 has a brilliant coaching product. Australian International 

 Sports Academy targets India. Equity of Greg Chappell as 

 a coach is not too high. Coaching an Australian regional 

 team does not allow you to make the greatest advertising 

 statement in India about the brand Chappell Way. So that 

 needed a marketing solution. Greg takes up, indeed wins, 

 the job of the cricket coach in India. He gets his partner 

 in AISA and a part of the Chappell Way product inducted 

 into the support team for Indian cricketers. He develops 

 a special relationship with More, the chief Indian selector, 

 who helps by sending the first batch of students.

 For some strange reason, whenever 

 we think of marketing, we think of soaps and shampoo or 

 fridges and TV. In vain we look for instances of great marketing 

 strategy during the TV commercial break. The brilliant AISA 

 strategy reminds us that the beggar in the story at the 

 beginning of this column is not alone in his bewilderment. 

 Marketing, like Him, is omnipresent.

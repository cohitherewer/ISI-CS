 Balm in bellyful of Bolly laughs

 - Comedy sequel smashes box-office records in rain-starved plexes

 A still from Phir Hera Pheri

 Laughter is the best medicine at the box-office, after all. A city sweltering under a delayed monsoon is turning to a Bollywood sequel for a bellyful of laughs. And even eight shows a day at a given plex are not enough for full families and corporate crowds.

 Phir Hera Pheri is clearly the midsummer hit of the year, smashing many box-office records in town during World Cup time. Sample this: multiplexes are running 30 shows of the Paresh Rawal-Akshay Kumar-Suniel Shetty-starrer every day in its second week, something not even Rang De Basanti could manage. The consolation crumbs are being picked up by new release Alag, and Chup Chup Ke and Mission Impossible 3, both barely two weeks old.

 And this has been possible because Week One saw Part II to Hera Pheri ? though director Neeraj Vora insists this is no sequel ? scoring huge in almost every plex property and on every time band. If 89 Cinemas had 89 per cent occupancy, INOX (City Centre) was 96 per cent full, while INOX (Forum) registered a whopping 99.6 per cent footfall.

 The prime reason: Phir Hera Pheri is a comedy reaching out to every member of the family audience. Unlike last year when a Bunty Aur Babli or a No Entry scored really big and featured in the top three films of 2005, the first half of 2006 hasn?t seen a comic blockbuster. The winners have been patriotism (Rang De) and romance (Fanaa and Gangster).

 Out of the 30 shows first week, almost 10 were block-booked by companies like HSBC, ICICI and Maruti Udyog and even a school (Ashok Hall). ?Phir Hera Pheri is the ideal entertainer if you are looking to give your employees or customers a good time,? is the consensus amongst the companies.

 Also, after the Fanaa gap, multiplexes have a quality product to screen. ?Everyone had expected to watch Fanaa at the plexes but all they got was the month-old 36 China Town,? feels Prashant Shrivastava, vice-president of 89 Cinemas. ?Now, with Phir Hera Pheri, the plex audiences have returned.?

 No real surprises that producer Feroz Nadiadwala is already planning a third part and writer-director Neeraj Vora is crowing about the Hera Pheri humour having enough steam to cruise through to ?sequel number seven?.

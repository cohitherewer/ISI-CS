 Science wonders 

 in the teacup

 From discovering the laws of friction 

 and optics to visiting science laboratories, 39 students 

 in the age group of 12 to 14 years are having a blast at 

 a science camp at Vedic Village, Rajarhat, and at IBIZA 

 The Club, Amtala, from November 20 to 25. An initiative 

 of Jagadis Bose National Science Talent Search (JBNSTS) 

 and The Chatterjee Group, the camp, being attended by students 

 from six city schools, is designed to provoke a sense of 

 wonder about science in everyday life.

 Day One had sessions on geography, 

 activities on centre of mass, stability and friction, and 

 astronomy, while the second day had chemistry with sessions 

 on making hydrometers for measuring density of liquids. 

 We have seen hydrometers before but have never made one, 

 said Aniket Dey, a Class VII student of Pailan World School.

 On November 22, the team left 

 for IBIZA. On the way they visited science laboratories 

 of Chembiotech and Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics.

 The last three days of the camp 

 saw the students attending sessions on floatation and Bernoullis 

 principles under the guidance of the two coordinators of 

 the camp, Henry Ortiz of Global Learning amp; Observations 

 to Benefit the Environment, Los Angeles, and Partha Ghose, 

 former faculty of SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences. 

 They were also introduced to the relation of everyday objects 

 with the science of optics.

 We made sure that the programme 

 is fun for the participants. We also wanted them to make 

 friends and most importantly, set goals for themselves, 

 said Ortiz. You dont always need test tubes for experiments, 

 they are happening everywhere around us, even in your teacup. 

 You just need to have the eye to see it, said Ghose. The 

 participating schools are La Martiniere for Boys, South 

 Point High School, Pailan World School, Calcutta International 

 School, Dolna Day School and Garden High School.

 We are living in the knowledge 

 era where competitive success depends on knowledge creation. 

 But though we have great institutes like the IITs, we have 

 failed in terms of creating knowledge. We hope to reach 

 out to at least two per cent of the school-going population 

 of the country in six to seven years through such events, 

 said Purnendu Chatterjee, CEO and chairman of The Chatterjee 

 Group, and chairman of JBNSTS. The institute is known for 

 its non-formal science education through out-of-class activities.

 On November 25, resource persons 

 have been invited to work out feasibility of future camps 

 and training of people who can hold them. JBNSTS has the 

 expertise to hold such camps and we are supporting them 

 in every way, said Aniruddha Lahiri, managing director, 

 The Chatterjee Group.

 The finals of Simultaneous Chess Display 2006 will be organised 

 by IndianOil at IndianOil Bhavan, in Dhakuria, on December 

 9. More than 100 students from various institutes who clear 

 the selection rounds will qualify for the finals in which 

 they will get to play Grandmaster Surya Shekhar Ganguly.

 Pwned by teh leet

 This weeks offering might 

 make very little sense to most, and who can blame them? 

 Certainly not this columnist who himself is in a state of 

 some befuddlement. For the last one hour, he has been gamely 

 trying to learn a new language called leet, more correctly 

 known as 1337 or I33t. According to the ever-helpful Wikipedia, 

 leetspeak is a sociolect variety used on the Internet, 

 particularly in online games, and is derived from 

 the word elite.

 Most of us who use cellphones use some basic form of leet, 

 such as u r in lieu of you are 

 or b4 standing in for before. 

 So far so good. But the mayhem begins when you consider 

 that leetspeak is mostly written in numbers that 

 is, numbers which vaguely look like letters. So leetspeak 

 (or leetspeek) becomes 133t5p33k, from which one can extrapolate 

 that E=3, S=5 and L=1. Then there are the deliberate typographical 

 errors, the commonest being the misspelt as 

 teh or t3h, as well as the use 

 of z in plural formation (skillz instead of 

 skills).

 Who are the speakers, or rather, writers of leet? (One cannot 

 speak leet, just as one cannot speak Egyptian hieroglyphics.) 

 Obviously communities on the Net, especially the young who 

 do not want their elders to suss what they are up to. Leet 

 is also used to bypass language filters in software 

 in fact, one of the first practical uses of leet occurred 

 in the late 80s when public bulletin board administrators 

 on the Net would try to restrict the use of unsuitable words 

 or expressions. Leet is also used by senders of unsolicited 

 email (technically known as spam) to get around spam filters. 

 So you might get an email offering to sell you W1ndOws 20OO 

 or Ph0t0sh0p, a crude sleight-of-keyboard which will nevertheless 

 fool most computers.

 Are all uses of leet, not to put too fine a point on it, 

 illegal? Well, not always. Leet is routinely used in a perfectly 

 innocent context by Internet gamers in communicating with 

 each other, especially in frantic multiplayer situations. 

 Since you can pretty much make up your own grammar and spelling, 

 it also makes communication possible even if you dont 

 speak each others language. The word pwn, 

 for example, is used to signify a resounding victory in 

 an Internet game (did you see how I pwned him?) and has 

 its own noun formation in pwnage.

 Will someone one day write a novel in leet? Purists may 

 blanch at this, but someone already has. In 1962, a certain 

 Mr Anthony Burgess wrote a novel called A Clockwork Orange, 

 in which the teenage Alex and his friends speak in a language 

 called Nadsat: Alex and his three droogs tolchock 

 an old veck, razrez his books, pull off his outer platties, 

 and take a malenky bit of cutter. Translate that, 

 o ye leetspeakers!

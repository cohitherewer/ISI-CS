 Inmates of Paripurnata, a home for women suffering from mental illness, have a reason to rejoice. From a small building in north Calcutta, they moved to a spacious home on EM Bypass on Wednesday.

 The inmates, who have come to Paripurnata from mental hospitals, greeted their guests at the new home with Tagore songs like Aguner parashmoni and Aji subho dine pitaro bhabane, accompanied by dance.

 Established in 1991 on Maharani Swarnamoyee Road, near Sealdah, Paripurnata treats mentally-ill women and rehabilitates them after they are cured of the ailment. Since inception, it has rehabilitated around 100 patients. 

 ?Paripurnata means wholeness. Our home is halfway between a hospital and the real home,? said Joyce Siromoni, secretary of Paripurnata.The rehabilitation process, which the home conducts free, takes around nine months.

 R.S. Choudhury, administrator of Paripurnata, said the women are made to discuss their problems with each other and take part in activities like shopping, cooking and washing. They are encouraged to express themselves through creative activities like sewing, weaving, music and drama. They also receive non-formal education in yoga and human rights. 

 The new address, at Panchasayar in Jadavpur East, will provide the authorities with more opportunities to pursue all these activities, that help the inmates rediscover themselves.

 ?Even after the rehabilitation process is over and the women are sent home, we keep supporting them for three years so that they do not become a burden on their families. We visit them regularly to assess their progress and ensure their well being,? Choudhury added.

 At the new centre, the home will accommodate 30 patients and have a larger outpatients department. ?We intend to keep male inmates, too,? said secretary Siromoni. Earlier, women from both jails and hospitals used to come to Paripurnata. But since 1995, only inmates from hospitals are taken in. Some of the inmates are also from other states and even Bangladesh.

 The home authorities plan to rope in counsellors and psychiatrists for better rehabilitation of the inmates.

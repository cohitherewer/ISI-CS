 Frown on goonda raj

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Hearing a petition on Monday, Calcutta High Court wondered whether police are allowing the goons to run a parallel government in city.

 The court was hearing a petition filed by a resident of Syed Amir Ali Avenue, in the Park Circus area. His counsel, Dipak Basu, informed the court that even after an earlier high court order, the Beniapukur police had not extended any assistance during the construction of a boundary wall by his client.

 Justice G.C. Gupta, reacting to this, questioned the police commissioner?s counsel: ?What steps has your client taken against the hooligans who had demanded Rs 50,000 as goonda tax from a law-abiding citizen? Is your client (police commissioner) helping the goons to run a parallel government here??

 The angry judge asked the lawyer to file an affidavit on April 24, stating in detail what steps the police commissioner had taken against the persons who had demanded the money from the petitioner.

 ?My client had first moved the civic authorities, seeking their permission for constructing the wall. The authorities concerned informed my client that there was no need of taking permission for construction of a wall below three feet. My client then moved the high court, seeking an order asking the police to be present during construction of the wall,? counsel Basu said.

 The lawyer added that despite Justice P.C. Ghosh?s directive, no policeman was present on the scheduled date of construction. ?Instead of police, some local goons reached the spot and demanded Rs 50,000 from my client before construction of the wall.? 

 ?Did your client lodge a complaint with the police against the goons?? Justice Gupta asked Basu. 

 ?Yes. My client had lodged a complaint on the same date,? replied Basu.

 On hearing this, the judge told the police commissioner?s lawyer: ?What is going on here? Why has your client not arrested the accused named in the first information report till date??

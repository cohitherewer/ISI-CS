 Shreshth Shah?s friends have reasons to complain. 

 While they slog away at school and catch the World Cup on television every evening next month, the Class VIII student of La Martiniere for Boys will be rubbing shoulders with the giants of world soccer in Germany.

 Shreshth emerged one of the four winners ? and the sole one from Calcutta ? of Adidas and ESPN STAR Sports? Fifa Flag-Bearers contest, the finals of which were held in Delhi on Monday.

 Along with Ajiteshwar Singh from Delhi, Sachit Kamlesh Yadav from Mumbai and P.S. Sudarshan from Bangalore, Shreshth will be representing India at the World Cup, carrying the Fifa flag and watching a tournament match with his mother.

 ?I?m very happy... It?s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,? Shreshth told Metro from Delhi. The first hurdle for the ?huge football fan? was an SMS contest, followed by a radio slogan competition. That led to the finals in Delhi, where high scores in quizzing, ?situation enactment? and ball dribbling saw the city boy emerge a champ among the 20 finalists.

 In the final segment, Shreshth was asked to react to a situation where he had missed a penalty and lost the Cup. He showed his disappointment by kicking the air but said: ?What if I don?t have the World Cup, I have Ma.?

 Mom Sanghamitra, who runs an advertising agency, said: ?Forget any chance of winning, I didn?t even know he had participated till the second round.?

 Shreshth and his mother leave for their three-day Germany trip on June 20. ?I can?t wait to get back home and tell my friends,? signed off the Salt Lake boy, who wants to be a detective when he grows up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Take-off, panic and return

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after two aircraft made emergency landings at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport, another private airlines flight returned to Calcutta within an hour of taking off on Thursday because of a technical snag.

 A SpiceJet flight on the Calcutta-Chennai route, carrying over 150 passengers, returned within an hour after take-off as the pressure within the aircraft fell below the required level.

 ?There was a snag in the aircraft, which caused the fall in cabin pressure. It had to return to Calcutta because of this,? a SpiceJet spokesperson confirmed over the phone from New Delhi. 

 The aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, departed from Calcutta airport at 6.25 am.

 ?Soon after it took off, the pilot sent a message to the air traffic control tower that a passenger had fallen ill and he had to return. Medical support, including positioning of an ambulance, was sought,? said an airport officer. The passenger, a doctor, was feeling discomfort and other passengers initially thought he had suffered a cardiac arrest. 

 Soon, the cause of his discomfort was detected. The indicator showed that the pressure within the aircraft had fallen. When an aircraft flies several thousand feet above ground level, the atmospheric pressure drops and optimum pressure within the aircraft is maintained with the help of a compressor.

 ?Pressure falls because of two reasons. Either there is some problem in the compressor or there is leakage,? an officer explained. 

 ?Passengers can suffer from nausea, severe headache or eardrum ache and this can lead to unconsciousness,? he said. Asthma patients can face breathing trouble.

 Once the pilot decided to return to Calcutta, another problem arose. ?The weight of the aircraft was much more than the required landing weight, since it had just taken off and the fuel tank was almost full,? said the SpiceJet spokesperson. 

 The pilot decided to release fuel and the aircraft was flown towards the Bay of Bengal. Fuel was unloaded in the sea and it returned to Calcutta at 7.15 am.

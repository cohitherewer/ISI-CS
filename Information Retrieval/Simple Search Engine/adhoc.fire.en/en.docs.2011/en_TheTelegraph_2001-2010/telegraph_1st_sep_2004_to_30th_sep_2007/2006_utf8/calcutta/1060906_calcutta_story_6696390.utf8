 We Ask, You Answer

 Shun plastic, save sewers

 Todays question: Should vendors be penalised for using plastic containers? More responses will be published next week

 Storm in teacup: Whose fault is using plastic containers, 

 anyway?

 Navin Bothra,

 Kankurgachhi 

 Before imposing any kind of penalty 

 on vendors for using plastic containers, the government 

 should undertake a massive awareness drive. Education is 

 the only means of fighting the problem. The drive should 

 be multi-level, involving the media, educational institutions, 

 social organisations and companies. The support of celebrities 

 will garner more attention. Even puja committees can play 

 a role. 

Saurabh dhanuka, 

 Salt Lake

 Obviously, vendors using plastic 

 containers should be penalised. Shopkeepers and store-owners 

 in shopping malls, too, should be hauled up if they are 

 found to use plastic containers. Keeping food items in plastic 

 containers can cause several diseases. Many people throw 

 plastic on the road thus blocking the drains, which in turn 

 leads to water-borne diseases. It is high time for the government 

 to act. 

 Nidhi Poddar, 

 Salt Lake

 The vendors and hawkers must be 

 penalised under Section 188 of the IPC, which deals with 

 flouting of an order by a public servant. But to what extent 

 these uneducated and poor people can be blamed is debatable? 

 The government should ideally take action against manufacturers 

 and distributors of plastic or come up with a pocket-friendly 

 alternative.

 Rahul Roy, 

 Dum Dum

 Vendors should not be blamed for 

 the spread of the plastic menace as it is the customers 

 who keep asking for plastic containers. The vendors have 

 no choice but to satisfy the demands of the customers. The 

 government has failed in providing an adequate substitute 

 for plastic containers. Paper bags provided by some shops 

 are useless for carrying heavy loads. Penalising vendors 

 will prove fruitless.

Shiv Shanker Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street

 Not only plastic containers, plastic 

 cups and thin plastic bags should be banned. 

Vinay Shreshtha,

 Salkia

 Vendors should certainly be penalised 

 for violating the norms set by the government, which has 

 looked helpless in tackling the plastic problem. Plastic 

 containers, if used, must be recyclable. 

Subhankar Mandal,

 Palta 

 Vendors should not be penalised 

 for using plastic containers. If the government punishes 

 vendors, it should also take to task their customers. If 

 plastic products are banned, shoppers will face great problems. 

 The government must first come up with an alternative for 

 plastic.

 Shilpa Raisurana, 

 Address not given

 The vendors should be penalised 

 for using plastic containers that do not meet the government 

 stipulation. Recycling plastic is very difficult. It decomposes 

 slowly. Burning plastic releases toxic fumes that pollute 

 the environment.

T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge

 Vendors should be penalised for 

 using plastic containers as they cause a great harm to human 

 beings. The drainage system gets clogged by plastic products. 

 There should be a total ban on use of plastic. Developed 

 countries have introduced such prohibitions years back. 

 Why not introduce paper parcels? 

 Saptarshi Das,

 Sinthee 

 Vendors should be penalised for 

 using plastic containers. Until the vendors stop using plastic 

 containers, the customers will keep asking for them.

 H .K. dutta,

 Shibpur

 There can be absolutely no doubt 

 in any sensible and farsighted persons mind that plastic 

 containers should be banned totally. Their continued use 

 will lead to disastrous consequences in the near future. 

 We have already seen this rainy season how plastic can hurt 

 us. This, however, does not imply that only vendors are 

 responsible for the proliferation of plastic. They, and 

 their customers, need to be penalised heavily. The administration 

 should also take to task manufacturers of plastic containers.

 Gods and goddesses, monkeys, elephants, tigers, snakes and palaces tumble out of the head of Olaf Van Cleef and find a place on the bejewelled watercolours of this flamboyant man from Paris. 

 Van Cleef held the first exhibition of his paintings in 2005 in Chennai, followed by shows earlier this year in Pondicherry and Auroville. Next January, he is scheduled to display his shimmering works at La Mre Gallery in the city he still associates with palaces instead of poverty and pollution. 

 Gems, exquisite design, noble metals and perfectly-crafted jewellery, often inspired by Indian flora and fauna, are what Olaf Van Cleef would be associated with. After all, he is the adviser to Cartier on high jewellery. When he took up painting in all seriousness a few years ago, his watercolours looked like they were diamond-studded.

 Snakes slithered and millions of fireflies winked and danced on his kaleidoscopic paintings. At witching hour, he would take up his fine brushes and the finest of fine felt-tip pens. Unable to sleep for more than four hours every day, he would paint, as if in a trance, taking up to 100 hours to complete a single painting.

 Van Cleef has been visiting India from childhood with his grandmother. The first time he dropped by in this city that he admires so much for its vitality and majestic if crumbling mansions was about 20 years. So, he has created a whole range of literally scintillating works for this city. Like a jeweller fitting a gemstone in its collet, Van Cleef often wears three glasses for magnified vision, and with the help of tweezers pastes crystals of varying sizes and shades on the surface of the heavy parchment that he has already painted on.

 At the end of it, a magnificently-spangled surface is created. A single spangle would sparkle as it catches light. He creates a collage with gold paper collected from chocolate wrappers. This is taking the art of decoration to its highest pitch and his new works often remind one of Leonid Baksts masterpieces and the sets in Baz Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge very exotic, but a little cheeky as well. 

 Van Cleef says he mixes reality and dream as he creates a Kali or a Jagannath, a tiger that could have been doodled by a child, an acrobatic child Krishna as conceived by an Inca or conjures up a vision of oil lamps.

 Motifs that often appear in Cartier creations such as ponderous elephants put in an appearance as a fresco on the wall of a palace. Van Cleef steals a beauty in a diaphanous sari from a Kalighat paat and does not hesitate to deck her out with his diamonds.

 Calendar art? Kitsch? It is impossible to classify Olaf Van Cleefs work. Better enjoy the dazzling collage of gold, crystals and rainbow hues the way they were meant to be. You may take a shine to them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Which Umrao? Whose jaan? What ada?

 Pratim D. Gupta watches J.P. Duttas Friday release and then rewinds right back to the Muzaffar Ali film for relief, reason and Rekha

 umrao jaan (1981) vs umrao jaan 

 (2006)

 In the spirit of Arthur Goldens 

 Memoirs of a Geisha, Mirza Ruswas novel was about 

 the life and times of Ameeran, a lovelorn tawaif. 

 It needed the deft hands of a poet like Muzaffar Ali to 

 breathe poetry into just another period piece about a golden-hearted 

 courtesan. His Umrao Jaan not only looked beautiful, 

 it felt the same. And a lot had to do with Khayyam-Shahryars 

 musical gems. Dil cheez kya hai, In aankhon ki 

 masti, Justuju jiski thi and Yeh kya jagah 

 not only captured the myriad moods of melancholy, it 

 actually transported you to 19th-century Lucknow and Kanpur 

 kothas, where Umrao Jaan was oozing ada.

 Isssshhh! What has J.P. 

 Dutta done?! Insomniacs look no further. Pay Rs 200 for 

 three hours of valium-sprayed babel. Bad enough to demand 

 a Sidhuism: No loss, only gloss! Dutta has mixed up a brothel 

 with a battlefield and bombarded us with one listless ghazal 

 after the other. What was he thinking while placing those 

 Abhishek-Ash love songs back to back? Neither do they sound 

 good (sorry, Anu Malik) nor do they take the story forward. 

 Here is where Dutta missed the Farhan trick. A Dil cheez 

 kya hai or In aankhon ki masti could have, maybe, 

 salvaged things at least for five minutes out of the 180. 

 rekha vs aishwarya rai

 A defining scene early on in the 

 original Umrao Jaan was of young Ameeran being rejected 

 as a domestic help in a royal house because she was dark, 

 a subplot Dutta conveniently blacks out because of Ash. 

 This pain of rejection at every corner of life from then 

 on is reflected in every glance of Rekha. She never cries 

 till the very end but behind every turn, every swing and 

 every nod, there is an inner pain that touches the soul. 

 Like her tears, Rekha could hold herself back in every scene 

 of Umrao Jaan. 

 The magic of Rekhas Umrao were 

 woven around her sense of enigma, her perfect body language, 

 her poise, her restraint. And through all her pathos, she 

 made an alluring temptress, playing into Gauhar Mirzas 

 (Naseeruddin Shah) hands, rallying around dacoit Faiz Ali 

 (Raj Babbar), loving the Nawab Sultan (Farooque Sheikh) 

 with all her heart.Much like Taal and Chokher 

 Bali, Umrao Jaan revolves around Ash, with the 

 other characters turned into mere props. From the first 

 frame to the last, Madame Rais green eyes shed copious 

 tears but you hardly feel her hurt. The sense of doom is 

 missing... largely because Ash becomes an object of maudlin 

 pity. There is no zest for life in her character, as if 

 a rudaali ready to burst into tears at the slightest 

 provocation. And how, pray, can a tawaif afford to 

 act like an achyut kanya? She shrieks at every mans 

 touch (apart from Nawab Abhishek, of course). Come on, give 

 us a break! Aishwarya does put in a lot her Urdu diction 

 is spot on and some of her dance moves mesmerising but 

 much like the mystery of the missing ethos in the film, 

 her characters pathos is nowhere to be found. Ash puts 

 it best: Which Umrao? Whose jaan? What ada?

 farooque, Naseer and the rest

 The Nawab-Umrao romance in Umrao 

 Jaan 1981 is an important sub-plot in the film, but 

 not the plot. Beautifully pitched, Farooque and Rekha exchange 

 notes on shayri and there is born the romance that 

 brings the two as much pleasure as it brings pain. It may 

 be the love story of a tawaif (randi in commonspeak, 

 a word used more than once in the film to deliberately dehumanise) 

 and takes place in kothas, but there is an innate 

 sense of innocence in the Nawab-Umrao romance. And thats 

 because Farooque Sheikh doesnt carry any tag with him. 

 The helplessness, the vulnerability, the angst... the love 

 story holds the film together.

 As integral to the film as Farooques Nawab Sultan is the brilliant Naseeruddin Shah as the cheeky charmer Gauhar Mirza. There is a constant inner turmoil between his feelings for Umrao and his struggle for sustenance in the kotha. And who better than Naseer to change colours like a chameleon?

 Even Raj Babbars Faiz Ali is so intriguing. He wants to say so much to Umrao but knows that his dacoit background will be revealed if he opens his mouth or tries poetry. There is a clear character graph from a ruthless dacoit to a platonic lover and that too in just a few scenes.

 What Muzaffar Ali did best was 

 bring the kotha culture of Lucknow alive with his 

 mise-en-scene, a brilliant blend of bright and bleak. And 

 why not? Art director Banshi Chandra Gupta had done Satyajit 

 Rays Shatranj Ke Khiladi just four years before 

 Umrao Jaan.

 abhishek, shabana and the rest

 For J.P. Dutta, Umrao Jaans life 

 has only one focal point her feelings for Nawab Sultan 

 and her life journey has only one destination Nawab 

 Sultan. Maybe Ash and Abhishek were so much in love during 

 the making of the movie that the Ruswa novel read different 

 to Dutta. But where is the love on screen? Forget chemistry, 

 the romantic banter between Abhishek and Ash is perfect 

 material for Scary Movie 5. Its that funny! 

 You soon end up admiring their costumes (stunning work by Anna Singh and Bindiya Dutta) and the ornate sets (the ever-reliable Bijon Dasgupta) rather than bother about what they are saying or doing (they do so little, anyway!).

 After his scorching act in Sarkar and his cool cut in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Abhishek in Umrao Jaan is a huge disappointment. With a body language suggesting hes straight out of the sets of Bluffmaster!, he hopes his glances will do the trick. But alas! Watch out for the scene when he is drunk. A bit of Baap B, a bit of Devdas SRK, Abhishek is like a cow without a cowbell, meandering into mediocrity.

 But then, compared to Puru Rajkumar (Gauhar) and Suniel Shetty (Faiz Ali), Abhisheks performance is worthy of an Oscar. Yes, they are that bad.

 But the one lady who rises above the script is Shabana Azmi. As Khannum Sahib, the brothel owner, she registers a knockout performance. Very differently played from her mother Shaukat Kaifi in the Muzaffar Ali film, Shabana shows what great actors can do from ordinary, repeat ordinary, material.

 Tired after a long days 

 hectic work schedule, back-to-back meetings and official 

 presentations? Want to meet friends over a glass of wine? 

 All set to pamper the Calcuttan looking to just chill in 

 the heart of the city is The Peerless Inn with Ego, a brand 

 new restobar and lounge.

 Designed by Prakash Mankad, the 

 64-cover restobar is the latest address in town for an evening 

 out with friends or simply chilling out with colleagues 

 after work.

 Once you step in, the dim blue 

 lighting with snazzy shades of yellow and red is sure to 

 pep up your spirits. The stark white of the walls complements 

 the glass and steel interiors of the lounge. Across one 

 wall is a row of famous faces ? from Elvis Presley to Michael 

 Jackson. Opposite this is the well-stocked bar with bartenders 

 displaying a trick or two with their nimble fingers.

 There is a long, curved sofa on 

 one side, while on the other there are small sofas and heavy 

 wooden chairs across low glass tables. In addition, there 

 is a series of bar stools along the partition right in the 

 middle of the restobar. A flat-screen television adorns 

 one wall.

 The restobar is located 

 in the heart of the city. Besides hosting a lot of expatriates 

 and consular officials, we hope to attract a major part 

 of the corporate crowd, says Nilanjan Kar, regional 

 sales manager of The Peerless Inn. 

 The music is a mix of techno and 

 hip-hop, with retro, lounge, blues and classics of the 60s 

 and 70s. While a live band will entertain guests all through 

 the week, you can expect to find resident DJ Arjun behind 

 the console on weekends. We have plans to bring in 

 celebrity DJs, adds Nilanjan.

 The USP of the restobar is the 

 wide array of food and beverages. The list of finger food 

 boasts Char-grilled Cottage Cheese served with Pineapple 

 Salsa, Corncoppia (lemon grass-flavoured corn cakes served 

 with tamarind sauce), Vegetable Money Bags (assorted vegetables 

 wrapped in wonton sheets), Vermicelli-coated Butterfly Prawns 

 served with Pineapple Chutney, Chicken Olivette (marinated 

 chicken supreme wrapped around an olive and served with 

 peanut dip) and Chicken Bruschetta (chunks of chicken with 

 basil and tomatoes served on garlic French bread).

 If you are hungry for more, dig 

 into Crispy Prawns, Chicken Peri-Peri (marinated chicken 

 breast served with sweet, medium or hot chilli sauce), Lamb 

 Staranise (pot-roasted lamb with burnt chilli, soya and 

 star anise) along with steamed or fried rice, Vegetarian 

 Hakka Noodles, French Fries or Jacket of Potatoes and Bouquetiere 

 of Vegetables. 

 You can also enjoy a Prawn and 

 Melon Salad, Caesar Salad (crispy lettuce salad served with 

 croutons and Parmesan cheese) or Vegetable Crudites (vegetable 

 fingers served chilled with dill-flavoured pepper yoghurt 

 dip). There is an assortment of pastas, soups, fries and 

 desserts to choose from.

 Among the beverages, you can expect 

 to find the regular whiskies, rum, vodka, gin, tequila, 

 cognac and beer. Also on offer are wines from Argentina, 

 Australia, USA, Italy and France, beside the Riviera, Chantilli, 

 Sula from domestic vineyards. Cocktails include Long Egoland 

 Iced Tea, Martini 007 and Ego Frigo, while a few cool mocktails 

 are called Lavender Orange Lush, Cinnamon Iced Coffee or 

 Minty Haze.

 Ego is open from 11 am to 11 pm.

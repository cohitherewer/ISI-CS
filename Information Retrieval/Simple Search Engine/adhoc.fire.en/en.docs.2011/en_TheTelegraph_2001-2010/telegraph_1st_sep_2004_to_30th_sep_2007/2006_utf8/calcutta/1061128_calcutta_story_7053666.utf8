 Fog delay in flight path

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The winter bulletin from the Calcutta airport runway is bleak.

 Contrary to earlier claims by the airport authorities, flight delays due to fog could remain unaffected by the installation of Category (Cat) II Instrumental Landing System (ILS). The Cat II ILS enables aircraft to land even when visibility is 350 m. The existing Cat-I system allows flights to land in 550-m visibility. 

 The fog is extremely dense at the airport. Sometimes the visibility falls to 50 m. Under such conditions, even the new system would not help, stated A.K. Das, director-in-charge of the airports Met office.

 Dense fog over the airport hangs heavy from late December to early January, from around 2 am to 8 am.

 Installation of the Mid Runway Visual Range machine, a key component of the Cat-II system, on the airports primary runway is complete. Installation is over and we have applied to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for safety audit, said a senior airport official. But the operation of the Cat II ILS will be possible only after the safety clearance. The system is unlikely to be operational in the first week of December.

 Representatives of pilot associations said installation of Cat II ILS constitutes only 60 per cent of the work to combat fog. Although the situation will improve, delays will continue if other measures are not taken, said M.K. Singh, president of Indian Commercial Pilots Association.

 Installation of taxi-in lights is a must. Without these lights, pilots cannot steer the aircraft from the runway to the parking bay in dense fog. In the absence of taxi-in lights, the old system of a pilot jeep with a beacon guiding an aircraft in and out of the parking bay to the runway will continue, said Singh.

 Apprehending delays, several international airlines have changed their winter schedules to and from Calcutta Singapore Airlines from December 1 to February 15, Emirates from December 1 to January 31 and Thai Airways from December 1 to February 15.

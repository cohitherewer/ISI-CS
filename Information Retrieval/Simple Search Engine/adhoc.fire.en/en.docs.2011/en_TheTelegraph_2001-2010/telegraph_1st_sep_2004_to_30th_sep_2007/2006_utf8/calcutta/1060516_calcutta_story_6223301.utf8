 Of canvas and coffee

 Creative canvases and a confluence of forms promising to take you on a journey of visual delight, while sumptuous finger food and fine tea make up the sip-and-bite quotient. That in a nutshell describes a series of art exhibitions planned at By The Way, Taj Bengal.

 This is a consolidated effort to promote art in general. We chose By The Way as the venue because the idea was to create an informal Parisian cafe ambience where an artist, whether famous or upcoming, is best understood, smiles Modhurima Sinha, director, public relations, Taj Bengal.

 Art Beat, the first of the series of exhibitions, was held on April 11. Among the 20 participants were featured big names like Prakash Karmakar, Sanatan Dinda, Shuvaprasanna, Beena Pradhan, Minakshi De, Isha Mahammad, Subrata Gangopadhyay and others. 

 With a mix of casts and colours, textures and tempers, artistic strokes, semi-abstract landscapes, religious illustrations and distorted forms, paintings on display reflected realistic and abstract sensibilities. 

 An exhibition like this displays creativity, reaches art to people and creates awareness. The response was overwhelming and an encouragement to come up with more such shows, says Sahil Desai, proprietor of Masters Collection Art Gallery, who organised the April exhibition at By The Way. 

 On the day of the first exhibition itself, we got booked for almost the whole year, reveals Modhurima.

 By The Way will play host to seven to eight exhibitions in a year.

 The timings should be from 4 pm to 7 pm, the ideal tea and coffee timings to be clubbed with good art, says Modhurima.

 To avoid the space-jam feel, not more than 30 paintings will be put up on the aisles. This allows the visitor to lounge around and soak in the beauty of the paintings, connecting with them spiritually and mentally, feels Modhurima.

 In sync with the exhibitions, the soon-to-be-launched new menu at By The Way will be splashed on a card with artistic touches.

 The June exhibition will showcase Minakshi Des paintings, and a sculpture show will follow in July. In August it will be a sketch session and September will witness a collective effort by artists from beyond Bengal. 

 October will feature works of Sanatan Dinda and November will boast creations by senior artists from Bengal. 

 so on the cards is a live painting session by upcoming artists, spread over a period of about three days.

 This is an effort to provide a platform for budding talent, explains Modhurima.

 FINDS WAYS TO CREATE A SENSE OF SPACE IN THE INTERIORS, BEYOND 

 LIGHT COLOURS AND MIRROR PLACEMENTS

 Space is like money, says interior 

 designer Nisha Agarwal of Interior Design Solutions. You 

 can never have enough. But yes, with a few ideas you can 

 trick the senses and visually expand your existing area, 

 she adds.

 True, shortage of space is one 

 of todays it problems. Talk of space-increasing 

 illusions, and light colours and clever placement of mirrors 

 dominate. GoodLife takes you beyond business as usual. 

 Combine call 

 To utilise space optimally, Nisha 

 suggests combining two or three activity areas effectively. 

 An ideal example is the kitchen, dining area and family 

 room clubbed together. Not such a tough task, with modular 

 kitchens and nuclear families being the order of the day.

 The illusion of space in 

 this activity area can be further enhanced by use of good 

 illumination and lighter colours, both on the cabinet laminates 

 and the vitrified tiles on the floor, says interior 

 designer Karan Jain. 

 Kitchen apart, a small corner 

 of the bedroom can be turned into an informal den for adda 

 with close friends. The decor in such cases should always 

 blend well. Bold contrasts dont do too well here unless 

 very cleverly executed.

 Furniture fact

 Light and airy are the key 

 words when it comes to choosing furniture for a small room, 

 says Nisha. So, that rules out intricate carving and sink-in 

 sofas.

 The trick, she says, lies in picking 

 pieces that have legs. These allow you to see the 

 floor, thus adding a whole new dimension. To add to 

 the drama, Nisha suggests the use of lights strat-egically. 

 Once the floor is lit, the area looks larger, 

 she says.

 Karan lists a few furniture facts 

 to lend a larger illusion to a drawing room or den. 

 Cabinets and other pieces of furniture should not exceed 

 7/10 of the room height. For instance, in todays 

 modern 10-ft-height room, nothing should go beyond 7 ft.

 Opt for low seating; it adds to the sense of space.

 The pieces should be easily movable. This has a huge 

 psychological effect of available space. 

 Stick to sleek and light objects. Switch to a plasma 

 TV if possible.

 Opt for lightweight fabrics and small prints for the 

 upholstery. 

 Lighting

 Right lighting can work wonders 

 to increase space but is best left to experts. More 

 so because lights simultaneously involve a play of shadows 

 ? a very tricky zone, says Nisha.

 Agrees architect and interior 

 designer Vivek Rathore: Lighting should be used so 

 as to cast differential shadows and unique patterns on the 

 walls. This reduces the corners, creating space in the bargain. 

 One can use an interesting light 

 with cut-outs that casts patterns on the wall. This effect, 

 says Vivek, does wonders to eliminate the heaviness of the 

 room.

 The idea is to reduce the 

 ambience light and highlight certain areas with spotlights, 

 he adds. 

 A narrow passage at home can also 

 appear wider, simply with lots of lights both on the floor 

 and ceiling. Says Vivek: Concentrate on the illusion 

 effect by playing up with lights and shadows on the paintings 

 and pictures in the passage. The highlights of the passage 

 should be in focus, rather than the passage itself. 

 Flooring

 Floor space happens to be the 

 easiest area for visual tricks. Here are some pointers to 

 be kept in mind:

 A spread-out pattern on the floor lets the eye travel 

 over a larger area.

 Diagonally placed wooden flooring adds sense of space. 

 Also use different flooring elements when combining 

 two or three activity areas. 

 Visual variety

 Play with tall and short 

 arrangements to add visual variety, says Nisha. This 

 simply means to put together, aesthetically, a melange of 

 objects that are not of the same height. 

 A perfect place to demonstrate 

 this is a cosy corner. With a tall lamp as a focus, arrange 

 a coffee table by the side. The tabletop can in turn be 

 home to a variety of long and short objects ? say a pretty 

 picture frame and some flowers. The difference in the height 

 of objects in the assortment adds to the sense of space.

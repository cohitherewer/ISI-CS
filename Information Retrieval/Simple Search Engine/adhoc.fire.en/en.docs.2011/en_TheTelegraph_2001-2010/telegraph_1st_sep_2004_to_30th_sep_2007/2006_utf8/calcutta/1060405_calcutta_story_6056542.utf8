 An elaborate exercise is on to prepare an inventory, containing both academic and aesthetic details of the works of art, anthropology and archaeology in Indian Museum. At present, only National Museum in Delhi has such a value-added inventory.

 Explaining how the knowledge bank is being prepared, director of Indian Museum S.K. Basu told Metro: ?While entering information about a coin, we are documenting every detail ? the year it dates from, the metal of which it was made and its place of origin. Besides, our language experts, after going through the inscriptions on the coin, are outlining the history of the period when it was in circulation.?

 The project was taken up in May last year, on order from the Union ministry of culture. It is supposed to be wrapped up in a year, but if the authorities fail to meet the deadline ? not an impossibility, given the volume of work and the expertise it requires ? the Centre will be approached for an extension.

 The exhibits in the museum can broadly be classified under six heads ? art, anthropology, archaeology, geology, zoology and botany. The inventory work is being done on the first three categories, comprising around one lakh objects, that are under the direct control of the museum administration.

 ?The project is not just a physical verification of the objects. It encompasses a lot more,? said Basu. ?A number of historians and artists are working on it. They will explain the significance of ancient and mediaeval coins, sculptures and archaeological objects, seals, inscriptions, manuscripts and art objects. Museum staff members are lending them a helping hand to make the project a complete success.?

 He added that the authorities were doing their best to finish the project within the deadline. ?Once ready, the inventory will enrich the knowledge of visitors, who will be able to gather all relevant information about an object culled from various sources,? Basu said.

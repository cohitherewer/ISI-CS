 It was a late start to the evening 

 ? 8 pm instead of the scheduled 6 pm due to a technical 

 snag ? but once the Advertising Club Awards for Creative 

 Excellence, presented in association with The Telegraph, 

 kicked off, there was no holding back.

 The venue was the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC), on Friday evening. The city?s most creative teams had gathered on the lawns. And as the drinks flowed and finger food was passed around, the anticipation was building.

 The battle was between two advertising biggies and their best creations, as Ad Club Calcutta president Sanjay Dutta put it, ?to help the hand onto the shelf and put the product in the shopping trolley?.

 Ogilvy amp; Mather (O amp;M) and Bates India had won 17 and 12 nominations, respectively. In fact, in some sub-categories, each agency was the only one on the nominations list, winning runners-up and award.

 Response India had its fair share of nominations, with 10. But some agencies were denied the award too ? a few sub-categories had no winners at all. 

 The O amp;M team occupied a couple of rows on one side, with a dafli to beat every time the agency?s name was called out. Not to be outdone, the Bates team, taking up quite a bit of space in the back rows on the other side of the aisle, cheered loudly at every nomination and award, often shouting ?dafli ja? at their rivals.

 The Hutch and Steel Junction ad campaigns proved the most popular, winning quite a few awards for O amp;M. Bates did well with its ads for ABP Pvt Ltd and Anandabazar Patrika, as well as one for STAR News. JWT notched up a win with its ?Incomplete? campaign for The Telegraph (CALCU..A)

 The categories were divided into Greeting Cards and Invitations, Folders, Brochures and Newsletters, Public Service, Retail, Services, Consumer Durables and Consumer Products (FMCG). Each had sub-categories for print ads, TV, radio, outdoors, campaigns and point of purchase.

 The grand prize, agency of the year, not surprisingly went to O amp;M.

 Stealing a musical march was Jenny, on her comeback to the Calcutta stage.

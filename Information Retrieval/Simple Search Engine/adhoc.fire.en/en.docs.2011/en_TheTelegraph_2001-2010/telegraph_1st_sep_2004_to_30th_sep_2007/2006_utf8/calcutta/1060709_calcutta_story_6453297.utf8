The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poser for People?s 

 car

 Will the target consumer swear by 

 the Tata dream machine or simply say Ta Ta?

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Who 

 is the Amitabh Bachchan of India Inc? There are many stars 

 in the world of Indian business, much like the Hindi film 

 arena. People can talk about Mukesh the Shah Rukh or Anil 

 the Saif, Narayana Murthy the Naseeruddin or Kumar Mangalam 

 the Aamir. Yet in many people?s book there is only one who 

 enjoys the stature of Amitabh Bachchan. He is Ratan Tata.

 So last week when I saw Graphiti, 

 the Sunday magazine of this paper, carrying a rare intimate 

 interview with the great man as its cover story, I could 

 hardly wait. In the interview Ratan Tata talked about the 

 People?s car that he hopes to build in our state. He said 

 that a family on a scooter is what really drove him to think 

 about this car. It wasn?t just about developing another 

 car. So often you would see guys riding on a scooter with 

 their families; a little kid standing in front, the wife 

 riding the pillion, holding a child. Add to that a wet road 

 and night time and you have a family in potential danger. 

 I hope I can contribute to making life safer for them. 

 A captain of the industry gets 

 moved by a scene on the street and conceives a million dollar 

 project ? this is the stuff that bestsellers are made of. 

 The million-dollar issue is whether this small car of Ratan 

 Tata will remain his personal vision or will it become a 

 dream of the millions. Why the question? Surely a car that 

 will be a four-door, five-seat, rear-engine car and whose 

 factory price will be about Rs 1,00,000 is going to be a 

 super hit.

 There are just two issues that 

 nag. First is this caveat that one lakh is the factory price. 

 We all know about freight, insurance, road tax, dealer margins 

 et al, which gets added on to such prices. Will the on-the-road 

 price as a result inch closer to the 1.5-lakh mark? That 

 might make it merely another car rather than a car for the 

 people that Ratan Tata wants to make. The other issue is 

 a more basic one. The focus of this new car project is the 

 safety need of a family driving a two-wheeler on a wet road 

 at night. The question is whether the man on the wheel or 

 his wife on the pillion knows about the risk. Probably they 

 do. Did the thought of buying a car cross their mind? Again 

 the answer is likely to be yes. Did they find the cars currently 

 available, including Mr Tata?s very own Indica, too expensive? 

 The answer possibly will be in the affirmative. They must 

 have found the prices of the factory fresh cars to be so. 

 But there is also this huge market now for used cars. The 

 on-road price of a second-hand Maruti 800 is now well below 

 a lakh. Why, the price of a decent Ambassador is now quoted 

 in slim thousands. So the Singur car may be the cheapest 

 car that the Indian auto industry will produce but it surely 

 is not going to be the least expensive buying option for 

 the consumer.

 The point to ponder is: why is 

 our man still not buying that used car? Yes, many would 

 have issues with buying a second-hand vehicle. But when 

 safety of the family is at stake can only the unaffordable 

 price of a factory-fresh car tilt the balance towards a 

 scooter? If one could hazard a guess, the more crucial hindrance 

 is in the running cost rather than the cost of acquisition. 

 Running a scooter dents the family budget much less than 

 a car. And the difference is a significant proportion of 

 the monthly outgoing. Would the Singur car be competitive 

 on this count? Ratan Tata said nothing about this in his 

 interview.

 Yet, this lone issue can convert 

 the People?s car from Tata to a car that people say Ta Ta 

 to.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 get through this week without

 Catching the star-studded 

 Omkara

 Vishal Bhardwajs Rs 25 crore 

 adaptation of Othello has brought back the Bard to 

 Bollywood after he made Maqbool one of the most intriguing 

 Macbeths ever. And this time he goes one up, signing 

 some of the biggest names in tinsel town ? Ajay Devgan, 

 Saif Ali Khan, Viveik Oberoi, Kareena Kapoor, Bipasha Basu 

 and Konkona Sen Sharma. If the stars do not interest you, 

 go for the 400-year-old story, because as the director says: 

 Theres an Othello in most of us.

 Rewinding with rain rhythm

 With a Kishore Kumar concert planned 

 in town on August 4, and the pitter patter reminding you 

 of all things romantic, its time to tune in to some 

 retro rhythm. Rain and song-and-dance have long become synonymous 

 in the Bollywood idiom of mush and mirth. From the innocent 

 yearnings of love in Pyar hua ikrar hua to the sensuous 

 pangs of passion in Tip tip barsa pani, theres 

 no better way to romance the rain than purring to the pour.

 Gift hunting for brother 

 dear

 With Rakhi, the pamper festival, 

 on August 9, its high time you hunted down that perfect 

 gift for brother dear. And with discounts raining heavier 

 than the monsoon showers, shopping would definitely be more 

 pleasure than pain. Catch the jaw-dropping discounts at 

 Wills Lifestyle or Benetton if youre going for clothes, 

 or pick a designer shirt from BE:. For other boy stuff, 

 take a look at the end-of-season sale at Pantaloons. For 

 the thread on his wrist, theres nothing better than 

 the rakhi exhibitions around town. You could also 

 raid the racks at Nik Nish and Metro Plaza. All the rest 

 is for the sister.

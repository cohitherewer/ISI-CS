 Students of IIT Kharagpur and NIT Durgapur on Sunday bolstered the anti-quota protests by medical students and junior doctors of the city. 

 The engineering students from Kharagpur even joined the hunger strike by students and interns of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital as it entered its fourth day. 

 The agitation, however, took a toll on the treatment of patients in the hospital.

 Bonny Dasgupta, whose 85-year-old father is admitted to the hospital, complained: ?A pacemaker implant surgery on my father is being postponed repeatedly. I tried to meet the hospital superintendent and senior doctors, but found their rooms locked.?

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who has been asked by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to look into the matter, appealed to the students to call off the stir. ?I have already submitted my report to the government. The students should first end their demonstrations,? Mukherjee said in Calcutta on Sunday. 

 The protests, however, continued undeterred under the banner of the Calcutta chapter of Youth for Equality. A couple of meetings during the day were rounded off by a rally in the Park Circus area in the afternoon. Parents of the students also took part in the rally.

 ?We will seek an appointment with the chief minister on Monday. We would also like to meet a few other state leaders,? stated Kaustabh Das Biswas, a Medical College and Hospital house staff and a protester.

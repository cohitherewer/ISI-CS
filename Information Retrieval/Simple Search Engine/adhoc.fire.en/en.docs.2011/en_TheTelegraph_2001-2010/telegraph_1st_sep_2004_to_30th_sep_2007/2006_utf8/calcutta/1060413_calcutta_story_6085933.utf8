 Light up and stub out in style

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Some keep away from it like the plague, some just cannot do without it, and for the rest it is a reflection of attitude or even intellect. For those who fall into the second and third categories, cigarettes are a way of daily life and the statutory warnings on the puff packets are meant to be given the royal ignore.

 And if you thought smoking is all about lighting a cylindrical white tobacco stick, a match box or at times those squarish plastic lighters, and the mundane little ashtray, its time to get your smoking facts straight.

 An essential element of smoking in style is getting yourself some eye-catching smoking accessories. 

 And Archies at City Centre could be a fun place to start looking.

 The range of imported metal lighters in different shapes and sizes will spoil you for choice.

 A tiny red one resembling a coffee mug is labelled Nesoaee ? not Nescafe ? and you need to press the froth to fuel the flame.

 What 

 Helmet ashtrays and metal lighters

 Where

 Archies, City Centre

 How much

 Ashtrays for Rs 350. The lighters are Rs 175-plus

 The telephone lighters have a 

 Victorian feel to them ? ornate carvings on the base, either 

 in a wood or metal-like appeal, the dial circular in shape 

 with numbers inscribed and the large receiver supported 

 by two sleek loops just like the retro models.

 Press on the middle of the dial and your telephone starts ringing and the flame rises to your cigarette end.

 The showstealer here is a swank golden motorcycle, very macho, very Dhoom. You work the lever, not for smoke to stream out of the tail pipe but for a flame to light your fire. Then there are the fire hydrant lighters in electric red that emanate an emergency buzz or the snooker balls where pale yellow is combined with dark mauve or green.

 It is mostly women who pick them up as gifts for men. Choosing a gift for men can be tough and these smoking accessories can make their task much easier, smiles Gautam Shroff from Archies at City Centre. They not only serve as lighters but also double as table showpieces, adds Shroff.

 From the flame to the flick. You can spruce up your office and home ambience with cool helmet ashtrays. Made of plastic, the flap can be raised or lowered. Once the ash and the burnt-out end are put in, the flap shuts.

 Those in bright yellow have a 

 skull in a long mauve cap ? symbolic of cigarette 

 smoking is injurious to health. Also on offer are 

 jet black ones that come adorned with fire flames all over.

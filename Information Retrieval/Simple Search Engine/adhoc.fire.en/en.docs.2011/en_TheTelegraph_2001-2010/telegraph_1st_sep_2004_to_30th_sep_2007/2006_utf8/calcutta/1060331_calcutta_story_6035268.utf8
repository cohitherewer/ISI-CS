 Speedy route to highway

 - Green corridor with overbridges and rotary flyover on BT Road

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Fifteen minutes from Shyambazar to Delhi Road is the target set by a revised roadmap that hits the highway with high roads flying over the chaos at ground level.

 The speed-up plan hinges on a rotary flyover at the Dunlop intersection and two vehicular humps (mini flyovers) at the crossings of Chiria More and Sinthee More, on BT Road. These will create a ?green corridor? from Shyambazar to National Highway (NH) 2, allowing vehicles to zoom through.

 The Rs 110-crore project (Rs 60 crore for the Dunlop flyover and Rs 25 crore for each of the two humps) will be implemented with financial assistance from the Centre.

 If things go according to plan, the Union urban development ministry will provide 35 per cent of the project cost, while the state public works department (PWD) will pump in the rest.

 The government has engaged Bengal-CES, a joint venture of private consulting agency Consulting Engineering Services and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, to prepare the detailed project report.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Thursday the detailed project report would be sent to Delhi soon. ?Funding from Delhi should not be a problem, but even if it is, we will provide funds from the government exchequer, as it is an important project,? he said.

 ?We are almost ready with the detailed project report and expect it to be complete within a month,?? said Bengal-CES director Samiran Sen.

 Officials at Writers? Buildings confirmed that the move was aimed at ?creating an uninterrupted entry road from the city to NH 2?.

 Officials expect the tenders to be invited and contracts awarded within two months. The project will take a year for completion.

 The Dunlop rotary flyover will have three ramps. The major entry point to the city from Delhi Road remains chaotic and it takes at least 15 to 20 minutes to cross the stretch.

 ?After conducting an in-depth study and taking the opinion of experts, we found that if the three red signals are avoided, vehicles can reach Vivekananda bridge without a hitch. Once the humps and flyover are in place, it will take 15 minutes to hit Delhi Road from Shyambazar,?? said an official engaged in the project.

 According to traffic experts, the purpose of constructing the second Vivekananda bridge would be defeated if traffic congestion on BT Road, particularly at the Dunlop intersection, is not eased.

 The National Highways Authority of India, monitoring the construction of the second bridge, had also raised this point with the state government.

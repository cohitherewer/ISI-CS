 Ready to rock the Rome ramp

 Model Jenny sports creations by designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh 

 Anamika Khanna is quite a regular on the London Fashion Week ramp now. Sabyasachi Mukherjee is all set to showcase at the New York Fashion Week in October. The latest to join the list of Calcutta designers making a mark on global runways is Kiran Uttam Ghosh. The designer will unveil her autumn-winter 2006-07 couture line at the Rome Fashion Week (RFW) next month.

 Rome Fashion Week would be a learning experience. The names that I hear of designers who are sharing the ramp with me are ones I have only read about in Vogue, was Kirans candid confession to GoodLife on Wednesday, a day after her participation in the event was confirmed.

 Kiran is the only Indian designer who has been invited to participate in RFW this year by ALTAROMA, organisers of the event. The designer from Ballygunge will exhibit her line at a solo show at Tempio di Adriano on July 13 evening. The event held between July 10 and 14 showcases couture creations only.

 The collection explores the boundaries and delves into the relationship of both male and female aspects in an individual, shares Kiran. The womens wear line works with pinstripes and mens suiting fabrics.

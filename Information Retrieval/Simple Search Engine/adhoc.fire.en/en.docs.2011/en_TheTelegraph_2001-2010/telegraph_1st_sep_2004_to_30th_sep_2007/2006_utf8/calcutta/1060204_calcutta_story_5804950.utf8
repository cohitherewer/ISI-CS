 The passing of Kajal Sengupta comes as a shock to nearly 40 classes of former pupils at Presidency College and the University of Calcutta, but to a tiny minority like me, it also signifies difficult times for an important tradition in our higher education ? collegiate theatre. 

 She numbered among the last of that rare breed of senior professors who not only actively encouraged student dramatics, but herself participated in her youth. 

 If we look closely into the history of education in this city, we find that virtually every VIP who passed their baccalaureate associated with college theatre in some form. A project cataloguing Shakespeare on the Calcutta stage that I co-directed unearthed these names as actors: Henry Derozio, Kashiprasad Ghosh, Krishnamohan Banerjee, Ramtanu Lahiri, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Rajendralala Mitra, Keshub Chunder Sen, Rajendra Prasad, Suniti Kumar Chatterjee, and many others before 1947. I am not even mentioning those who took to theatre as a career, such as Sisir Kumar Bhaduri or Utpal Dutt. 

 When Kajaldi studied at the University of Calcutta in the early 1950s, she performed in Shaw?s How He Lied to Her Husband alongside the late Sanat Bhattacharya and my father, as well as in Shaw?s charming two-hander Village Wooing and as Raina in Arms and the Man. 

 It was this firsthand taste of the stage that she brought to her teaching, whether of drama or any other text. Significantly, too, she published an edition of that classic comedy, The Way of the World. 

 We had brilliant scholars of English at Presidency, but invariably they confined their lectures to literary criticism, valuable, but to the total exclusion of the theatrical work that was any play?s intended artistic avatar. So whenever a few of us fledgling thespians aspired toward histrionic acts, we turned not to them but to Kajaldi. 

 She took us under her wing, supported us enthusiastically when we suggested recording some plays on cassette: not surprisingly, Arms and the Man, but Wilde?s An Ideal Husband and Ionesco?s Bald Soprano as well. She kept them in her custody in college and supervised listening sessions. Proudly, we heard our voices on the department?s Ahuja cassette deck. 

 We turned to Kajaldi because she was a sport, she was fun ? without which no degree can be complete. But she also had a vibrant presence in many other activities. 

 If the worth of a life is evaluated by the range of people it touched, Kajaldi lived a full life indeed. 

 To an age increasingly given to professional specialisation, she seems like the Renaissance woman.

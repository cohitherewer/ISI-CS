The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On your marks, get set, go

 Participants of 

 Amazing Race Asia; (below) Prashant and Sahil 

 Its one of the most watched reality shows in the world and Mumbai models Prashant Raj Sachdev and Sahil Shroff are the first Indians to be on it. Come November 9, and Sahil and Prashant will be racing against the clock and against nine other pairs to come out on top of Amazing Race Asia.

 I was so fascinated by the original American version of the show that I had actually contacted the producers CBS to enquire if they take Indians, 26-year-old Prashant tells Metro. But then only Americans were allowed on the show. So once Amazing Race Asia was announced, I knew I had to be there.

 The show has 10 teams of two participants each related to each other in some way running across several countries in Asia and undertaking certain tasks. The slowest gets eliminated in every country and by the time the race is over, only one team wins and takes home a cool $ 100,000.

 The Indian duo came together when Sahils sister met Prashant at a conference a year back. We are so similar that my sister was reminded of me when she met Prashant, Sahil says. We met up after that and hit it off instantly.

 When the Amazing Race Asia auditions came up, they had to be together. My friends felt that we two would be great together, says Prashant. So we talked about it and got audition dates in Kuala Lumpur. Once there, we were just fooling around and generally being ourselves.

 Things got tough when the two were picked they couldnt reveal it to their friends and family. While Prashant told his folks at home that he was going for a fashion tour to different countries in Asia, Sahil lied about landing some fashion contract abroad.

 Now that we have told our families, they are quite furious but the rules of the race do not allow us to tell them anything, laughs Sahil.

 The six weeks on the road have not been straight out of television. What we see on TV is just a snippet compared to what we actually had to go through, says Prashant. We lived the experience. We travelled to exotic locations and it was exhilarating since we were always against time and competitors.

 Not allowed to reveal the details of the outcome or the actual locations of the race, Prashant and Sahil did rattle off what they would do if they win the big prize money eventually. I would shop a lot and travel to all the locations I passed through during the race, says Prashant.

 Sahil, though, doesnt want to go back to the race locations. I would rather travel to new countries and new places but, yes, we both would definitely travel after the race experience.

 And it was quite an experience. Our vision has blown up after those six weeks, sums up Prashant. When you go to all these different locations and interact with people from different cultures, you realise theres so much more to achieve in life.

 Amazing Race Asia will premiere on AXN on November 9 at 11 pm.

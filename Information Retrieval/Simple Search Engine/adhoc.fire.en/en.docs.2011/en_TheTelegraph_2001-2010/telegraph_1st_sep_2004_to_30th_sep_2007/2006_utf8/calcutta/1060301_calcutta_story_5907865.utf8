The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Protest hurdle for students

 - Anti-Bush rallies will delay amp; disturb examinees, say parents

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Processions and rallies by the Left Front to protest the US President?s India tour will throw the city traffic out of gear on Wednesday and Thursday. Madhyamik examinees are likely to be inconvenienced by the disruption.

 The CPM-controlled Students Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) will hold their demonstrations on Wednesday, while the other Front allies are scheduled to take out processions the next day.

 As per the plan, the SFI and DYFI supporters will assemble at Shahid Minar around 1 pm on Wednesday and march towards the US consulate office on JL Nehru Road.

 According to the SFI leaders, smaller processions will head for Shahid Minar from different points in the city from 11 am. As the Madhyamik examination starts at noon, the candidates will also start for their centres around that time.

 The guardians of the examinees fear that candidates will be disturbed during the examination if the processions pass the schools. 

 ?The geography examination will be held on Wednesday. The students whose examination centres are by the road are anyway disturbed by the honking of horns. Shouting processionists will definitely disrupt their concentration,?? asserted a teacher of a north Calcutta school.

 ?What can we do? George W. Bush does not visit India frequently. As the US president is landing in Delhi on Wednesday, we have organised the protest on that day,? argued SFI secretary Apurba Chatterjee.

 He continued: ?We are aware that the Madhyamik examination is going on. We could have changed the date of our rally had it been any other issue. But since this is a matter of raising a voice against US imperialism, we have no alternative.?

 Chatterjee claimed that he had urged the SFI leaders to maintain silence while the processions passed schools.

 Other leaders of the organisation said the students would not be held up in traffic snarls, as they would reach the examination centres before the start of the main procession.

 ?Those who will hold the rallies should keep in mind that lakhs of students are sitting for an examination on which their future depends,? said Gopal Chandra Nandi, headmaster of Jodhpur Park Boys? School.

 Headmistress of Bethune Collegiate School Priti Mondal stated that everybody had a right to protest, but it should not impinge on others?.

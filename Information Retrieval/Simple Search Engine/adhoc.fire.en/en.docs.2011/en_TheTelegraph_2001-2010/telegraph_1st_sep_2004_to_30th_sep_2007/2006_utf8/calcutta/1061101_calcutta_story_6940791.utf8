The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

Coffee day, cognac night

Luxury lounge

Way. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

By day, you can savour the Jamaican Blue Mountain, 

lightly roasted to produce that special mellow taste, reputedly the best 

coffee in the world. Or a pot of Monkey Pick, a wonderfully refreshing 

brew of Chinese tea, hand (or rather paw) picked by specially-trained monkeys 

from terrain inaccessible to human beings.

By evening, sip on a glass or two of Hennessy Paradis 

Extra, Camus or Remy Martin, while dragging on a luxurious Bolivar Petit Coronas, 

a Davidoff Special T or a Romeo Y Julieta Churchill cigar. And round the rendezvous 

off with the most sinful desserts.

You can now enjoy the best of both these worlds at 

By The Way in Taj Bengal, which has repositioned itself and re-launched as a speciality 

tea and coffee lounge by day morphing into a cognac and cigar lounge by night.

The key in this repositioning exercise is that 

we have launched over 16 original coffees from across the world and over 68 teas 

from not just Darjeeling, but Nilgiri, Assam, China, Japan, and Sri Lanka. It 

will also offer more than 16 types of exclusive cognacs and some of the worlds 

finest cigars, says Taljinder Singh, general manager, Taj Bengal.

The inspiration is the Sea Lounge in Taj Mahal Palace 

Hotel in Mumbai, and the Empress Lounge in New Delhi. 

The essential idea is to have a place 

where one can have a peaceful business chat or just socialise without the intrusion 

of loud music or the clatter of the usual all-day dining atmosphere.

To carry on the conversation, you can choose from 

the worlds best coffees like Brazilian Cerrado Vintage, Decaf 

Colombian Supremo, Costa Rican Rain Forest, Guatemala Las Nubes or Sumatra Mandheling, 

besides the iconic Blue Mountain.

If you are a tea drinker, there are the finest Darjeeling 

blends including Margarets Hope and the First Flush, the Assam Organic Langai, 

Sri Lankan Waltrim Estate or a traditional Earl Grey. We also have very 

special teas like Black Tea Irish Cream, which has a distinctive cocoa and whisky 

flavour, adds Jyoti Pradhan, guest service officer.

There are Tisanes like Fresh Breeze (a refreshing 

combination of mint and berries, fennel and cactus), Morning Dew (mint and berries 

mixed together to give the freshness of dew), Rosey Red (blend of fruit bits and 

roses) and Fruit Tropical Dream.

The same concept will be replicated for the evening. 

Calcutta already has plenty of loud places, lounge bars and discotheques. 

What we want to recreate here is very subtle. So, By The Way in the evening becomes 

a cognac and cigar lounge, which is very quiet, like a Parisian cafe, smiles 

Singh.

The place already enjoys the atrium, has a sidewalk 

feel, with a verandah and palm trees. It already has most of the elements 

of a typical Parisian cafe. We just need to refine it and with our quest for the 

art of hospitality, present it as a place where you can enjoy a wonderful cognac, 

without shouting to be heard, he adds.

Between 3 pm and 6 pm, the lounge serves ceremonial 

English high tea on a trolley. By The Way, in its new avatar, is also a 

very private and cosy place, the elegant quietude of which lends itself to art 

shows, while you can also flip open your laptop and catch up on your pending tasks, 

says the general manager of the Alipore star hotel.

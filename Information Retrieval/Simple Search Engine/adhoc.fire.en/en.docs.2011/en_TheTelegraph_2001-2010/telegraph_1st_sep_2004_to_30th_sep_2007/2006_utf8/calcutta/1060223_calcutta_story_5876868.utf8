 What: The soft launch of Tress Talk, a Wella salon and spa. 

 Where: 4A, Allenby Road, first floor.

 Take a look: This 1,200 sq ft salon, a joint venture by Naina Badiani and beauty expert Darshni Sanghvi, is cosy and comfortable. It boasts exquisite Italian furniture ? reclining sofa chairs, the functional beauty seats and lazy lounge couches ? well arranged and spaced, complementing the soothing cream and green ambience.

 The overall feel of the salon and spa is soft and quiet, housing various sections like a bridal room and spa, cute kiddies corner and a tattoo section steered by an artist from Thailand.

 On offer: French facials for mature skin using pure lotus oil, a sparkling facial for younger skin with silver dust and mogra oil, an aromatic spa pedicure... a host of exotic beauty treatments is on offer, other than the usual services like hair styling, bleaching, waxing, manicure and pedicure. While the facials are all tagged between Rs 300 and 1,200, services from the Ken and Barbie section (that caters to the below-12 age bracket) are priced between Rs 50 and 200 and the massages are all within Rs 400. One corner also stocks Virginie Aroma Magic, Darshnis own line of aromatherapy products. 

 Voiceover: What sets Tress Talk apart from others is the personal touch that we always offer. All services come with personal consultancy, stresses Darshni.

 Fitness facts

 What: Inauguration of two new centres of VLCC in the city and launch of two loyalty initiatives ? Privileged Family Card and The Way of Life.

 Where: The new centre at 1/432 Gariahat Road, Jodhpur Park.

 When: February 18.

 Take a look: The launch was attended by Vandana Luthra, chairperson of VLCC, and actress Celina Jaitley. My association with VLCC dates back to the days before Miss India happened. I like the holistic way they go about doing things, said the Bollywood bombshell. 

 The new centres, like the existing ones, provide scientific solutions for tip-to-toe wellness. Tailormade programmes help monitor weight as well as manage general fitness and diet.

 The loyalty programme The Way Of Life offers members benefits on a wide range of VLCC services, therapies and products. The Privileged Family Card gives 30 per cent discount on all treatments, complimentary services worth Rs 3,000 and VLCC affiliate discount/voucher booklet from various brands and outlets for a minimum value of Rs 5,000.

 While these are the new offerings from the national fitness chain, an institute imparting training on beauty care, nutrition and ways to manage a salon is in the pipeline. Branches in the UK and the US are also being talked about.

 Voiceover: Obesity is like an epidemic now and we need to deal with it seriously. We at VLCC do not believe in appetite suppressant pills and the like, but in providing services for natural ways to look beautiful and fit, smiled Vandana.

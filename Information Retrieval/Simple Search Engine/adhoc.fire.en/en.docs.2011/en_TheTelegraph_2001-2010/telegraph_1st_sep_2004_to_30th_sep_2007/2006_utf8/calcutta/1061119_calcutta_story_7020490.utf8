The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

 St Marys Hill

 Going 

 Take a bus or train to Siliguri. From there, you can take a Trekker, car or bus to Kurseong. Cars are available on hire to St Marys Hill. You can also take the toy train from Kurseong.

 Staying 

 You can make reservations at White Orchid lodge from Calcutta. Call 9831167537, 24404384 or 22485829.

 Close to Kurseong, at an altitude of about 6,000 ft from sea level, St Marys Hill is fast gaining popularity among tourists who love tranquillity. Dotted with lush green pine and oak, the hill station offers a majestic view of the Himalayas.

 Unlike in Kalimpong and Darjeeling, you will never lose yourself in a crowd at St Marys. Here, the silence is broken only by the distant whistle of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway toy train, which offers the most romantic way to get to the hill station from Kurseong. 

 There are no obstructions north of St Marys. From the balcony of your lodge you will be able to see as far as Kurseong. On a clear day, icy peaks in all their glory, including the Kanchenjunga, rule the view. 

 The variety of orchids in bloom at this hill station alone would make a visit memorable. The grand church and the college adjacent to it are two of the other attractions. Weather permitting, take a stroll in the evening. The lights of Kurseong in the distance make a pretty picture.

 The only lodge at St Marys is the White Orchid. It has been given a log house look. But not at the cost of modern amenities. Sit down with a cup of Darjeeling tea in the impeccably-maintained garden to watch the sun rise over the snow-clad peaks. You will need some luck, though. The sky is generally overcast at dawn. 

 Visit the church after breakfast. The tinkle of the bells and sound of the prayer creates a wonderful ambience. The local people are mostly Christians and are a pleasure to interact with.

 The Makaibari tea estate is quite close and is definitely worth a visit. If you manage to obtain a pass, drop in at the tea processing factory, too.

 Hop over to the forest museum and deer park during the day. Cars are available for local sightseeing. 

 Many exotic birds nest in the pine forests of St Marys. If you have an interest in ornithology, dont forget your binoculars. You can spend hours watching the birds, some of whom fly in from as far off as Siberia and Tibet. For nature lovers, October to December is the best time to be here.

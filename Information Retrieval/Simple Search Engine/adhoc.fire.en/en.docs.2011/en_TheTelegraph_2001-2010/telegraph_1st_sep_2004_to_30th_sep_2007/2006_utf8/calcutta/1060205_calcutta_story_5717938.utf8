 Pet meets baby, nice and easy

PET PASSION 

 Nilanjanaa

 Having a baby is an exciting experience. But go back in time just a little and recall when you first brought home your dog or cat. For every animal lover, their pet is their first ?baby?. So it?s understandable that your pet may experience some sibling rivalry when you introduce a new human baby into your household. Though most pets are very tolerant of small children, it?s important to be aware of potential dangers and take precautions. When I was expecting Sara, my daughter, I read up on babies, pets and their compatibility. Here?s a list of do and don?t for mothers-to-be with pets.

 Before the baby is born?

 Avoid contact with animal faeces. Never clean litter boxes; if you must then wear rubber gloves and wash your hands. This is to avoid toxoplasmosis, which can affect the eyes and brains of unborn babies. Make sure your pet has had his vaccines and has been de-wormed. Keep it?s nails well-trimmed and make sure it doesn?t have fleas.

 Your baby will demand a lot of your time and energy, so accustom your pet to spending less time with you. But make sure another family member develops a closer relationship with the animal and spends time with it. That way, the pet will still feel loved.

 Review obedience skills daily with your pet, so by the time you introduce your baby it will be more likely to adhere to basic training. Sprinkle baby powder/baby oil on your skin so that your pet becomes familiar with the new smell.

 After the baby is born? 

 Before you bring your baby home, make your partner takes home something with the baby?s scent (a blanket) for your pet to investigate. If your pet has a special place to sleep, place the baby?s blanket there.

 When you return from the hospital, your pet will be eager to greet you so let someone else take the baby into another room. Never force your pet to go near the baby and always supervise any interaction. Reward your pet with a treat for appropriate behaviour.

 No matter how well you trust your pet, an infant should not be left alone with the animal. Though new parents are often tired, you should make an extra effort to spend ?quality? time with your pet. Have a positive interaction with your pet when the baby is present.

 Keep soiled diapers in a bin as dogs may be tempted to investigate. Guard against cats urinating/defecating in a newborn?s crib. These are not acts of jealousy. Territorial marking relieves a pet?s anxiety. Do not scold your pet for this.

 Consult a vet and paediatrician if the thought of your newborn interacting with the pet makes you uncomfortable. 

 ADOPTION: Three puppies, light brown in colour, need homes. Call Priyanka at 9830033133.

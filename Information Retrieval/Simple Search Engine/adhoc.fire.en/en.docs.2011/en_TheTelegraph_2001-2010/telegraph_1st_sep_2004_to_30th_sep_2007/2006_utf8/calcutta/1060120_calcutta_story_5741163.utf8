 What: Unveiling of Dyuti Diamond Jewellery, the latest collection from the house of Senco Gold.

 Where: Senco Gold mega shop at Moulali. The collection will be available at all Senco Gold showrooms across Bengal. 

 When: Thursday.

 Star attraction: After a two-hour delay, former Miss India and now Bollywood hot bod Tanushree Dutta turned up to unveil the collection. Looking sexy in a little black dress, the Chocolate girl mouthed some predictable lines ? I am partial towards Calcutta because of my Bengali roots and, of course, Diamonds are a girls best friend ? before signing a few select autographs. 

 The collection: An outcome of a years detailed research, the focus is on wearability. The diamonds sourced from DTC are the Hearts and Arrows. They have been combined with gold to form exclusive rings, neckpieces and wristlets. Elegant neckpieces come with matching earrings. While in some, diamonds are studded in flowery ornate patterns, others have geometric shapes with trimmings at the end. A necklace with rubies in unison with dazzling diamonds is an eye-catcher.

 Sleek and attractive, the rings come in a variety of designs. For the wrists there are beautifully-carved pieces or broad studded ones. For men, theres an array of rings and kurta buttons.

 Pocket pinch: Rs 5,000-plus.

 Voiceover: Simple yet gorgeous, these pieces are perfect for todays women, said Sankar Sen, CEO, Senco Gold.

 Busy bites

 What: An international buffet lunch designed for managers on the move.

 Where: Virgose, the resto-bar at Hotel Hindusthan International.

 When: Till January 31.

 The spread: Very elaborate, with a live Italian counter cooking up imported pastas and crepes, mouth-watering soups like Mushroom Cappuccino, an elaborate seafood platter with squids and prawns and more. There is a south Indian counter serving delicacies like a whole range of dosa and utthapam and also a full course Chinese platter. To make for a perfect sweet ending, there are six varieties of desserts to pick from. The menu undergoes daily variations.

 Pocket pinch: The entire fare comes for Rs 300, including taxes.

 Voiceover: The quick lunch has been introduced for busy corporates who can grab a bite and go back to work without feeling too bloated. It is also a great way to meet up with clients. The cyclical menu is light with a lot of salads and pastas, says HHI general manager Madhushudan Jhingoan.

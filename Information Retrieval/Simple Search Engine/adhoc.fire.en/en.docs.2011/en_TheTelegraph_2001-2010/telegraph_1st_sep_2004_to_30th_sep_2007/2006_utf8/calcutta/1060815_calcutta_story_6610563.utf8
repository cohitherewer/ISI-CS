 Being staged as the concluding show of a drama festival to mark Sundarams 49th anniversary, Munni O Saat Chowkidaar is a story of love and lust, faith and suspicion, simplicity and shrewdness. Dhritikanta Ghosal, a wealthy industrialist, fears that he may be kidnapped for ransom, as he had been abducted earlier, twice, on the eve of the elections. When Sourav, an executive in his company, has to go on a long official tour, Ghosal asks him to let him stay in his flat, as he would be safe there. Sourav is naturally alarmed at the proposal, for, neither can he refuse to comply with his bosss wishes, nor can he agree to leaving his wife, Munni, alone with the boss. After much deliberation, he decides to hire seven guards, who would protect Munni from the boss, as well as from one another, thus ensuring her well-being in his absence. This provides the ground for a hilarious satire, that reveals unknown depths of complex human nature. Drama, direction and acting: Manoj Mitra.

 Takeover time for ailing ponds

 - DETERRENT FOR LANDFILL REALTORS

 Raghu dakater pukur awash in glory after its restoration

 Encouraged by the popular support to its attempt to take over the control of a waterbody on private land in Cossipore, north Calcutta, the civic authorities have decided to adopt some more ponds, irrespective of their title status.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has directed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to prepare a list of small waterbodies that are in poor shape and need to be taken over for immediate revamp.

 The move, Bandyopadhyay pointed out, will act as a deterrent against builders who fill up ponds illegally to construct buildings.

 As a first step towards the goal, also a first in the history of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), the environment department in January had taken over control of a five-bigha pond owned by Singhabari Debutter Estate under Section 17A of the Inland Fisheries Act, 2006.

 Popularly known as Raghu dakater pukur ? the Cossipore debutter estate was founded by Raghu dakat more than 150 years ago ? the waterbody had been almost filled up. The CMC has restored it in less than two months.

 ?We have spent Rs 2 lakh on re-excavating the waterbody, which had remained a swamp for over two decades. The fisheries department will soon start pisciculture in it,? said mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Sharma.

 He thanked the civic conservancy department for removing the 200-odd truckloads of garbage and mud that the pond yielded during re-excavation.

 The success of the Singhabari model has emboldened the civic authorities to replicate it in other parts of the city. Bandyopadhyay said the newly-enacted Inland Fisheries Act allows the CMC to take over the control of any waterbody measuring over five cottahs in the city proper.

 However, amid all talk about rejuvenation of decaying or filled-up ponds, a prominent waterbody in south Calcutta that continues to remain neglected is Bikramgarh Jheel. 

 According to an estimate, more than Rs 20 lakh would be required to beautify the jheel, which had been taken over by the civic body three years ago. Recently, the South City group had expressed interest in beautifying it.

 It was once decided that the waterbody would be tagged with the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, but the earlier Trinamul Congress-BJP board dropped the proposal without citing any reason.

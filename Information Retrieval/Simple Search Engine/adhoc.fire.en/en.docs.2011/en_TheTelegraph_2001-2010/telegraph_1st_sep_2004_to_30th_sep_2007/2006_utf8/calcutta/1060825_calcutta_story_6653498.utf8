 Together we perch: 

 Crows are the sole feathered face of Calcutta now 

 Apropos the report And life flows on, July 25, it was interesting to see the photograph of a flock of crows. Although the number of other birds in and around the city is steadily dwindling, crows are rapidly growing in number. People are sometimes annoyed by the coarse caw, but we should not forget that they keep our surroundings clean by eating garbage. The flourishing of crows also demonstrates that only the fittest survive. The way crows attack other birds is a sight to behold and perhaps explains the demographic situation among the feathered folk.

 Apropos the report Fix-it rap for cratered artery, July 31, and the letter Point-counterpoint, August 4, it is surprising that no organisation associated with New Town Road is ready to take the responsibility for its poor condition within a year of completion. The chief ministers fast track to progress is proving rather bumpy. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road.

 Apropos the report Uniform code to rein in private schools, July 24, the decision by the state government is most welcome. Since the schools are located within the boundaries of the state, the interests of those who join the institutions, as students or teachers, need to be protected by the government. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos police commissioner Prasun Mukherjees statement (Between vigil and laxity, July 26) that Calcutta is vulnerable to terror strikes, why isnt the safety of the people being given utmost importance? Mukherjee must concentrate fully on beefing up the citys security instead of trying to become the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal. Calcuttans can do without cricket, but not without their lives and properties. 

 Hirak Roy Chowdhury,

 Ballygunge Station Road. 

 Apropos the report Next car park under Chaplin Park, July 26, are these car parks profitable? Are the owners ready to keep their valuable cars in such parking plazas? The Rawdon Street car park has already turned out to be a losing venture for the civic body. Is that not lesson enough? 

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge. 

 Apropos the report Retail tale in news hub, August 19, immovable properties at 41A, AJC Bose Road, is under process of sale in terms of a order of the Ld. Presiding Officer, Calcutta Debts Recovery Tribunal No. 1. The offer of Siddharth Fabricators has been accepted by the sale committee for purchase of the property and the sale has not been completed. 

 K.P. Misra,

 Receiver and chairman of the sale committee appointed by 

 the Presiding Officer 

 A.N. Shroff,

 head, Diamond Group, replies: 

 Siddharth Fabricators, through the receiver and chairman K.P. Misra, has agreed to the sale of the property and the balance sum of Rs 13.85 crore will be utilised for the purpose of freeing the property from various encumbrances including that of corporation tax, CESC dues and others. 

 Apropos the report Festive high, July 26, Subrata Sens film Bibar is based on a novel by Samaresh Basu and not Samaresh Majumdar. 

 Arunima Chatterjee,

 Konnagar. 

 Apropos the report Local lad 

 was British ace pilot, July 27, Lieutenant Indra Lal Roys 

 nickname was Laddie. He was good at studies and won a scholarship 

 to Balliol College, Oxford, and was slated to join the Indian 

 Civil Service. But deep within, he cherished a burning desire 

 to fly. Hence, the minute Laddie came of age he signed up 

 for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and after completing his 

 training joined the No. 56 Squadron in France.

 His initial operational experience 

 proved almost fatal after he was shot down by a German plane 

 in November 1917. Despite being relegated to ground duties 

 at Farnborough and Uxbridge, he virtually fought with his 

 superiors till he was posted back with an operational unit, 

 No. 40 squadron RFC at Bryas, France, in June 1918. He soon 

 got into combat flying and created a record of sorts by 

 shooting down nine German planes between July 6 and July 

 19. Laddies favourite fighter plane was the renowned Sopwith-Camel 

 bearing the number B 180.

 Laddie flew his last sortie on 

 July 22, 1918. In a vicious dogfight over Carvin, France, 

 he shot down one German Fokker but his B 180 was riddled 

 with bullets in the process. Since Laddie fell inside the 

 German territory, he was buried by the Luftwaffe at Levil 

 Cemetery, north of Arras. The epitaph on his grave Bengali, 

 which had a French version too, reads: Maha birer samadhi; 

 sambhram karo, sparsha koro na (A valiant warriors 

 grave; respect it, do not touch it).

 Jayanta Kumar Dutt,

 Beltola Road.

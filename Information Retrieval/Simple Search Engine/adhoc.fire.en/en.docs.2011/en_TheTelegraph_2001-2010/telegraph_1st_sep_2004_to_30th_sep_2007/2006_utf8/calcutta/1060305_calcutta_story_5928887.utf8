 Go global with local lingo

 Very, very stimulating is how David Graddol described the Calcutta leg of his whirlwind India tour, which was the last stop on Saturday before his flight back home to the UK. The man from Milton Keynes graduated with a degree in linguistics over a quarter of a century ago from York University, and he hasn?t looked back since.

 Graddol held a workshop for a cross-section of professionals ? Jadavpur University English professor to head of training, PricewaterhouseCoopers ? at the British Council in the morning. In the evening he presented a report on the future of English as a global language. His book, English Next, was also launched on the occasion. 

 Graddol argues that India and China will determine how English will fare as the global language of industry, commerce and, critically, the Internet, in the coming decades. Because, as he explains, ?globalisation is not about uniformity; localisation is an important aspect of globalisation?.

 Regional languages will become more widely spoken, while the bigger languages will cease to be as popular, was his verdict. ?In the search for a lingua franca, English will emerge as a global language, but smaller regional languages will also be more spoken with the greater connectivity, communication and mobility that a global economy brings. So some of the regional languages, like Bengali, are growing very fast, also with the diaspora that exists around the world. English will be a greater threat to a bigger language like Hindi,? predicted the applied linguist, writer, broadcaster, researcher and consultant.

 The managing editor of English books for Equinox Publishing and managing director of The English Company is also on the editorial boards of several journals. On this trip around the country, he visited Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad (?I landed just before President Bush?) before coming to Calcutta.

 In India, he felt, the corporate sector will determine, to a large extent, the future of English. In sectors like BPO, it is no longer just about speaking good English. It is increasingly becoming an issue of communication, to ?promote and present an idea or an argument?. It is a cross-cultural meeting rather than just speaking the same language.

 It is from this multicultural exchange that different types of one language emerge. Like an Indian version of English, or a West Indian one. In Singapore, the debate has gone further to acknowledge and accept ?Singlish?, while China is only just picking up English. Communicating to a local audience means segmenting the market and speaking to specific groups of people.

 ?Maintaining local cultural identities and languages is part of globalisation. Sharing a language creates an identity, and code switching (from one language to another) cements that group unity. Purism is damaging and a waste of time. It cuts off the growth of the language. When a word is borrowed from one language to explain a concept, there is greater transparency because it will mean the same thing to everyone,? explained Graddol.

 Showgirl shifts gears

You may have seen her on the posters of Tauba Tauba, Fun: Can Be Dangerous Sometimes, Men Not Allowed and Mazaa Mazaa. The more daring might have actually sneaked into the theatres to get a more full-bodied view of her. For those who you haven?t, well, it?s an opportunity lost because Payal Rohatgi is not going to feature in any more of those skin flicks. She will only reveal for big banners, you see.

 ?Around eight months back I decided that I would only work with big banners and known directors,? said Payal, in town to perform at Tantra on Saturday. ?It?s not that I regret doing those films. At that point of time, when I came to Mumbai I did not have any platform. Maybe my sensibilities matched with those movies but then eventually I figured out that it was not what I wanted to do all my life.?

 Like many other struggling actors, Payal found a lifeline at Subhash Ghai?s Mukta Arts when she was signed for an important role in Abbas Mustan?s 36 China Town. ?I was finally doing something meaningful,? said Payal. ?Although I have a glamorous role in the film, I feel it is on a par with the roles of Kareena Kapoor, Shahid Kapur and Akshaye Khanna. Since it is a romantic thriller, I can?t reveal anything more (of the storyline, that is).?

 What 36 China Town also did was make industry stalwarts take Payal a tad more seriously. ?Madhur Bhandarkar had already started shooting Corporate when I went to his office looking for work but he immediately signed me on for the role of an actress in the film? Although he has built my character, it?s basically about this one song Oh sikander which I perform. It?s meant to be an item song since the actress I play is famous for her item numbers.?

 In the middle of all that naacha-gaana, Payal had some fun with Virender Sehwag ? shooting a Dabur Dantmanjan commercial, directed by Pradeep (Parineeta) Sarkar. ?When I went to Dada (Sarkar), this was all he could offer me and I just grabbed it,? Payal recalled. ?While I have never been a cricket fan, I could relate to Sehwag as a human being. Despite being such a huge star, he was so humble and down-to-earth and he told me, ?Payal, not just mine, even your job is so tough?.? And you thought Sehwag couldn?t play straight?

 Continuing her winning streak, Payal has been pencilled for a cameo in another Subhash Ghai production, Sangeeth Sivan?s Apna Sapna Money Money. ?It?s more of a special appearance as Suniel Shetty?s girlfriend but as I said, it?s all about the banner and being in the same league,? signed off Payal, before heading off to rehearse her moves for the night.

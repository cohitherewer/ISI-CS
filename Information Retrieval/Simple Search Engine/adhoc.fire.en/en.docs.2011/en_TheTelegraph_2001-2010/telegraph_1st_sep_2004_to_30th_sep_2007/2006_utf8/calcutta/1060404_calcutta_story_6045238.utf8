 What: 

 Third anniversary celebrations at Forum.

 When: March 25 to April 2.

 Take a look: To mark the completion of three years, the popular mall at 10/3, Elgin Road had lots of excitement in store for its customers. 

 The nine-day celebration starting from March 25 gave shoppers an opportunity to win return tickets to Kuala Lumpur/Penang, tickets to INOX, gift vouchers and more. For a crack at the airline tickets one had to shop goods worth Rs 800 from any store and register on the ground floor before 8.30 pm on any of the days.

 A lucky draw chose eight winners for the air ticket. On Sunday afternoon, Indrani Halder, Bikram Ghosh and wife Jaya Seal Ghosh handed out the prizes. 

 The mall has changed the face of the city, our shopping habits and more. It is a value-addition to our lifestyle and I wish the mall has many more successful years to come, said Bikram.

 The winners were Vishal Sureka, Vandana Mohta, Saloni Surana, Prerna Vishnu, Ipsita Sengupta, Madhu Sultania, Suman Gupta and Sharad Jhawar. 

 Also on offer were two vouchers 

 allowing two winners the chance to catch a movie at Forum 

 every week for 52 weeks and 26 weeks, respectively. The 

 lucky cine-goers were Rajiv Mitra and Neelam Agarwal.

 As part of the celebrations, on-ground activities saw Shoppers Stop gift vouchers worth Rs 500 and 100 couple tickets at INOX being given out every day.

 Voiceover: I am glad at Forums success. With construction starting on Forums extension on the Lee Road side later this year we will provide a greater variety of fashion brands. We also hope to address the parking issue by constructing a multi-level space, said Rahul Saraf, managing director, Forum.

 Kids calling

 What: Third anniversary at Little Shop.

 Where: The outlet at Forum.

 When: April 2, 5 pm onwards.

 Take a look: Be it the colourful balloon decor or giant-sized Tweety and Mickey Mouse shaking hands with kids all around, the store was all set to celebrate its third birthday in style. The theme of the decor being underwater, ensembles in splashes of blue ruled the store windows. Small fish here and there accentuated the look.

 Free gifts, chocolates and candies were distributed among children attending the party. 

 While tiny tots looked amazed at the tricks the magician showed, the tattoo corner saw girls getting flowers, Mickey Mouse and aquatic tattoos done. The birthday bash also marked the launch of a new summer collection.

 Capris, skirts, frocks, cotton printed shirts? There was a variety to choose from. 

 For girls, the colour palette was magenta, pink and turquoise green and for boys it was parrot green and pink. 

 Also available was a full range 

 of baby items, pram walkers, bouncers, sterilisers and toiletries.

 Voiceover: We have received an overwhelming response here because of the variety and reasonable price range. A shop in South City Mall on Prince Anwar Shah road is in the pipeline, smiled Shiv H. Daswani of Little Shop.

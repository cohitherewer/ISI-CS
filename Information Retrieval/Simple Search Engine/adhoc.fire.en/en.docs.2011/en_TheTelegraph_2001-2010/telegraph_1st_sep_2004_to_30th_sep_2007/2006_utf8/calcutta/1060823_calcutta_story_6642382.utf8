 Buddha wields broom

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 What Bangalore did yesterday to keep clean, Calcutta hopes to do tomorrow.

 Leading Calcuttas fight against filth is chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has unveiled before the mayor his vision of a greener and cleaner city. Plan Buddha calls for the involvement of local clubs, NGOs and private companies.

 Under mission clean-up inspired by the Fund for Your Own City model followed in Bangalore private parties will be urged to clean and green filth spots and earn the right to prime billboard space there.

 Officials said the target areas for the chief minister are broken pavements, overflowing vats, vacant plots overrun with weeds, ill-maintained parks and gardens, neglected school buildings and decrepit ghats lining the Hooghly.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has identified a dozen such sites that will be handed over to private concerns for beautification under the development-against-billboard scheme.

 We want to involve the people in our drive to beautify the city, which includes proper upkeep of public utilities. If local residents, clubs, NGOs and industrial houses come forward, we can certainly effect a real makeover, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 There are several playgrounds in the city that are not maintained properly. If a club or a company cleans one such patch, builds a wall around it and instals lights, it will be allowed to put up a billboard of a reasonable size on the plot. The CMC will not demand any money for the billboard, explained municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 A tax, however, will have to be paid if anyone wishes to use a vacant and neglected plot for commercial purposes.

 Many advertising agencies have expressed interest in beautifying public toilets and many clubs and other organisations have proposed to take the responsibility of maintaining parks in lieu of billboard rights. The size and shape of the billboards will be decided by us, said Bandyopadhyay.

 Those willing to avail of the scheme will have to submit proposals to the civic body. A five-member committee comprising three civic officials, artist Ramananda Bandopadhyay and author Buddhadeb Guha will scan the proposals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Movie 

 Meter 

 Gangster

 Written and directed by 

 Anurag Basu, the film follows the romantic yearnings of 

 Simran (Kangana), who falls in and out of love with two 

 men, gangster Daya (Shiney Ahuja) and singer Aakash (Emraan 

 Hashmi). Her eventual choice tears apart all three lives.

 A 

 gripping (and original) story told with great flourish by 

 the

 Murder maker. Apart from 

 a tight structure, the flash forwards at the beginning and 

 at the half-way mark, and the well-disguised twist in the 

 tale keeps the viewer on the edge.

 Real and believable performances mark the high energy levels 

 of the film. Emraan kisses (of course, he does) but this 

 time he deserves the lip service thanks to his charmingly 

 restrained demeanour. Even though her dialogue delivery 

 grates at times, Kangana makes an assured debut as the madam 

 in the middle. Searingly silent, Shiney comes up with the 

 perfect follow-up to his stunning debut in Hazaaron Khwaishein 

 Aisi.

 Pritam?s music works wonders. Whether it is the sugarcoated 

 Lamha lamha, the lyrical Tu hi meri shab, 

 the angst-filled Bheegi bheegi or the haunting Ya 

 ali.

 Cinematographer 

 Bobby Singh makes some use of the virgin locations of Seoul, 

 from the rooftops of skyscrapers to the bustling bylanes.

 There 

 are major continuity lapses at several places in the film 

 and the last shot, straight out of Yash Chopra?s mustard 

 fields album, is so unnecessary.

 Last word: A blockbuster 

 of a budget movie.

 Washington and Owen in Inside Man, releasing 

 end-May

 Inside Man

 Spike Lee returns with 

 a Dog Day Afternoon for tomorrow. Dalton Russell (Clive 

 Owen) and his team have ?around 50? hostages inside a bank 

 but as Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) finds out, 

 they may not be interested in robbing the bank. Also, the 

 bank owner (Christopher Plummer) assigns specialist Madeline 

 White (Jodie Foster) to fish out ?something important? from 

 one of the lockers in the bank.

 A great middle-of-the-road film from Lee. While he ventures 

 into commercial terrain after years, he doesn?t muzzle his 

 inner voice. The format may be mainstream and thrilling 

 to say the least but he does raise questions of race and 

 gender during the hostage interrogations.

 Delightful performances by the entire cast keep you glued 

 to the otherwise familiar basic plot. Lee-favourite Washington 

 is a treat to watch as the very human sleuth on a mission. 

 Owen, who has a mask hiding his face for a major part of 

 the movie ala Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta, is 

 at his ruthless best. It?s a relief to see Foster not playing 

 the harried and horrified mom for a change and living the 

 role of a no-nonsense professional problem-solver.

 In a big victory for Bollywood, the film opens and closes 

 with two versions of Dil Se?s Chhaiyya chhaiyya. 

 While the film really does nothing to justify the usage, 

 with Lee, you do not look for explanations.

 The film does not take off until the negotiations start 

 between Owen and Washington and also tends to become repetitive 

 at certain stages, redeemed by the twists in the tale.

 Last word: Later this month, 

 watch an elaborate bank robbery where not a buck is robbed.

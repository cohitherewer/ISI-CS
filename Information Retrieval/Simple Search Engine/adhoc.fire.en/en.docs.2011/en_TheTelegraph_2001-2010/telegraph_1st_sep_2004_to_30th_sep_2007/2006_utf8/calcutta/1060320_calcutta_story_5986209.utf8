 Cop flip-flop over death of woman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A week?s probe had convinced the police that Sheela Roy?s ?suicide? more than a year ago was actually a murder, committed or masterminded by her husband. 

 But the post-mortem report having established that the injuries were ?accidental in nature?, the sleuths have backtracked.

 Officers are certain that of the two charges brought against husband Tarun, a resident of Barasat, abetment to suicide would not stand. They are now trying to establish the other ? torturing wife.

 ?As the post-mortem report suggests that the wounds on Sheela?s body were accidental, the abetment charge does not stand. Now, we will have to prove the torture charge,? declared an officer of Barasat police station. 

 Sheela, 29, who taught at a school in central Calcutta, was hit by a train near Ultadanga station early on January 13, 2005. She was brought to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where she died the next day. She was five months? pregnant.

 Days before, she had lodged a police complaint, accusing her husband of having extra-marital affairs and assaulting her. The complaint had led police to suspect that the death was a suicide.

 But within a week, based on the statements of the witnesses to the ?mishap?, the sleuths claimed that the woman was murdered. And they suspected Tarun to be the killer. 

 ?He was our suspect because he reached the hospital eight hours after being informed about the mishap. He claimed that he was too nervous to step out,? said an officer of Barasat thana.

 ?We found out that he was at home when the mishap occurred. That led us to suspect that he had hired a killer. But the post-mortem report has debunked the possibility. Going by the findings, we cannot even claim that the woman had committed suicide,? the woman added. 

 Asked about the flip-flop, Praveen Kumar, superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, said: ?The first statement ? that she committed suicide ? was on the basis of what our officers came across at the mishap site. But in a week, statements of the witnesses prompted the sleuths to call the death a murder. Everything, however, changed dramatically when we got the post-mortem report.? 

 Asked if the torture charge will bear out, an officer said: ?The woman herself had lodged a complaint a few days before her death. We are proceeding with the document.?

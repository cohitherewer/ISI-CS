 Creative choreography

 Upasana Centre for Dance presents a programme of innovative choreography based on Kathak. Blended with elements of martial arts, as well as folk forms like chhau, it promises to offer a remarkable spectacle of rhythm and motion, grace and balance. The show will commence with an invocation, Abahanan Mangalgeeti, followed by Kalpaloker Chhabi, an item based on Tagores poems. Tarana is a rich musical piece, composed of a synchronous fusion of classical and modern melodies. Naba Chhanda, as its name suggests, is a performance grounded in typically modern styles and techniques. It celebrates life in the present and anticipates the future with eager enthusiasm. The concluding piece of the evening will be Jhansi ki Rani ki Amar Kahani, a historical ballet paying tribute to the courage and valour of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi. Participants include Ritwika Som Chowdhury, Saswati Mukhopadhyay, Subhadra Basu Roy, Nibedita Chattopadhyay and Luna Poddar. Choreography and direction: Ashimbandhu Bhattacharjee.

 Ray juggler off on jaunt

 - NEW ZEALAND BECKONS

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Abhay Mitra of Joy Baba Felunath fame displays his skill at jugglery. A Telegraph picture

 From Varanasi to Wellington. The dagger-wielding hands that had made Lalmohan Ganguly skip more than a heartbeat in Joy Baba Felunath will take aim 28 years on in the New Zealand capital. 

 If Abhay Mitra was doing the bidding of Maganlal Meghraj on screen and Satyajit Ray off it, this time it is the government of India that is calling the shots for his 10-day trip Down Under. 

 The governments Indian Council for Cultural Relations handed me the invitation. I must be the first Bengali juggler to be performing there, says the 69-year-old, who will be accompanied on the tour by his son Abhishek. 

 No surprises there, because as many as seven members of the Mitra family have embraced the art. Even my two daughters, grandson and granddaughter are jugglers.

 Mitra will be felicitated by the Bengali Association of Wellington on October 19. The juggler, who retired as a bank manager, ascribes his fame overseas to the Feluda film. 

 Satyajitbabu was fond of me. Even before my last trip to Paris, I had sought his blessings, Mitra recalls.

 The film-maker who made him may be no more but the memories are just as fresh. The shoot was at Indrapuri Studio. He was making a point with a pencil and I was to aim the dagger at that target. The bhojalis were very heavy but I had no problems finding my mark. Well done, well done Satyajitbabu would tell me every time. It was only after the camera rolled that Santosh Dutta took position for what proved to be the only take.

 Mitra, who has performed for Doordarshan in almost every state from the Andaman Islands to Kashmir, counts Apna Utsav in Mumbai in 1990 and Lok Utsav in Delhi in 1991 among his biggest moments. 

 But his most memorable is an impromptu show in a mental asylum. I had gone to Ranchi for an event on condition that I would be taken there. When I was, I carried some sticks on the sly. On seeing the inmates, I got busy performing Indian stick jugglery. Suddenly, they came running at me, dancing, clapping... and then hugged me tight, Mitra gets breathless in excitement of reliving the moment. This proves how jugglery can impress even the mentally challenged.

 But the day before departure from Uttarpara, his target is winning over audience in uncharted waters. And no, his hand does not tremble in nervousness. I am still a young man, he affirms, with the zest of the children he trains on the Maidan and his district home.

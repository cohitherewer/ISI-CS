 Boost for knee change

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There is hope of quick recovery for those who need to undergo a knee replacement surgery. 

 In a week, Peerless Hospital will instal equipment that will allow minimal invasive surgery for complete knee replacement. 

 ?The equipment has arrived from the US. We are planning to instal it next week,? said P.K. Banerji, head of the orthopaedics department at the hospital. The hospital would be the first in the country to instal the equipment.

 In normal surgery for knee replacement, an incision of 10 to 12 cm is required. But in the minimal invasive technique, the incision would be less than 10 cm.

 ?Usually a patient takes two to six months to fully recover. In a minimal invasive operation, the period would be less than two months and with much less pain,? Banerji explained. 

 And with the computer-assisted navigation (CAN), minimal invasive surgery would be 10 to 15 per cent more accurate than conventional methods. 

 ?The computer helps in perfect alignment of the hip, knee and ankle centres. Better the alignment during the replacement, the better would be the post-operative knee movement and there is less wear and tear of the implant,? the orthopaedic department chief said. 

 ?Minimally invasive surgery with computer assistance can exactly tell the placement of bone cuts. This kind of surgery for the hips has already been done,? said Buddhadeb Chatterjee, orthopaedic surgeon at the city?s Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. 

 Peerless Hospital has also announced the launch of Intelligent Knee Surgery Course (IKSC), aimed at updating surgeons about advanced technologies.

 One of the main features of IKSC is the rotating platform high-flexion implant. It has been developed to increase bend and rotation of the knee and also ensures stability and longevity of the implant.

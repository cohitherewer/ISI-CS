 I?ll have to go with the majority and say Brazil. They are a mature side and are improving as the tournament progresses. They have a good blend of youth and experience. Their shooting capabilities are also the best. I doubt how far England will progress. As for Argentina, it is playing well but I fear it is too inexperienced. That is why it peaked before time. I will back them four years later in the next Cup. After Brazil, my next horse is Germany. They are the home team and have a tradition of playing solid football.

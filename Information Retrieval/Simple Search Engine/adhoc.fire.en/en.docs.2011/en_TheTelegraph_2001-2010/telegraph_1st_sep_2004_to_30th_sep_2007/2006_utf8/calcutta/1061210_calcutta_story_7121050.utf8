 From the talent and temperament, skill and stamina on display at Sona Chandi The Great TTIS Challenge, the children from 123 schools sure have what it takes to make the world a better place for you and for me. For three bright days, Swabhumi was the stage for competition and camaraderie befitting the biggest school carnival in this part of the world

 The true spirit of participation and the joy of winning marked the third and final day of Sona Chandi The Great TTIS Challenge at Swabhumi. There were many in the sea of uniforms who had been eliminated in the preliminary rounds; they were all there on Saturday, cheering and clapping. Here is what they saw and loved...

 Fusion Dance

 The blindfolded girls from St Josephs and Marys School impressed with their synchronised steps set to the title song of Taal. The cheerleaders of Don Bosco School Liluah were the loudest as their boys put up a power-packed performance of moonwalking, break dance and robot dance, but exceeded the time limit. Don Bosco Park Circus impressed with innovative choreography symbolic of the light and dark shades of life.

 Participants: 18

 Winners: Springdale High School Kalyani, South Point High School, Don Bosco Park Circus

 Fashion Parade

 Style was substance as the schools put their most creative foot forward. St James got a pat on the back from judge Snehasish Bhattachharya for the Don look. A girl from Shri Shikshayatan showed off a maroon mini with red and cream checks as a smart option to do away with the run-of-the-mill uniforms. Students of Springdale High School Kalyani showcased a stunning collection of garments and accessories made of jute designed by their teachers. Girls from Rajasthan Vidya Mandir with kohl-lined eyes turned out in style, wrapped in blankets and shawls, spears in hand, inspired by the land of the pyramids.

 Participants: 17

 Winners: Springdale High School Kalyani, North Point Day School, Methodist School.

 Western Group Music

 First-time visitor to the fest, Teresa Ali of Class XI, St Pauls Mission School stole the spotlight despite not being on stage. She gave an impromptu performance of the Cranberries song Zombie and drew the loudest cheers.

 The contest saw Don Bosco Park Circus and Salt Lake School belt out popular numbers like Blood Brothers and Hotel California. But vocalist Ishita Chakraborty of The Frank Anthony Public School, blew away competition with Tourniquet, an Evanescence number. St Augustines Day Schools (Ripon Street) head-banging with For Whom The Bell Tolls (Metallica) had the crowd rocking.

 Participants: 12

 Winners: Dolna 

 Day School, The Frank Anthony Public School, St James School.

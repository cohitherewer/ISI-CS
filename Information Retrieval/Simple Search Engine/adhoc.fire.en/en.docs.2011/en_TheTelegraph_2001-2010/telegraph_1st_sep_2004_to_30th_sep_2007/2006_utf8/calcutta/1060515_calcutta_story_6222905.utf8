 Awareness key to wastage check

 Md. Aamiruzzaman: Standpipes are a major source of wastage of filtered water. Why aren?t you stopping supply of water through standpipes?

 I admit that the wastage of filtered water is a serious problem. An awareness of the consequences of water wastage can solve the problem. Abolition of standpipes or roadside taps is a critical decision and has to be thought over carefully. 

 We have taken up a plan to supply filtered surface water to 95 per cent of the city population. A Rs 300-crore proposal has been drawn up for the purpose. It will be implemented as a joint venture project with private parties.

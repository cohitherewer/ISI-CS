The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New bus services

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation has tied up with city-based transport company Kaushik Logistics to operate airconditioned buses between Calcutta and destinations in north Bengal and Assam. 

 Inaugurating the service, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said his department was keen to run more buses in collaboration with private partners. 

 We will start with a pair of buses each on the Calcutta- Jaigaon and Calcutta-Dhubri routes. The Jaigaon bus will ply through Siliguri and Cooch Behar. The fare for Jaigaon and Siliguri will be Rs 930 and Rs 700, respectively, said Gautam Banerjee, executive director of Royal Cruiser, which is handling the bus services on the route.

 We are developing a website to offer ticket reservation through the Internet. We have also arranged for food and refreshment for the passengers during the journey, Banerjee added.

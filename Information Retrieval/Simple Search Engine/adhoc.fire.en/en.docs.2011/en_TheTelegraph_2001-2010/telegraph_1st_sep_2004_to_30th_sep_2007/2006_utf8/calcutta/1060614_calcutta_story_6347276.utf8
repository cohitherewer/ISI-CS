The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rs 20 crore for a score of roads

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

The state government has taken up a Rs 20-crore scheme to improve traffic management on a score of Calcutta roads.

 The transport department plan envisages median dividers on all these roads. Their width will decide whether the dividers will be concrete slabs, grilles or lights. White paint or lights will demarcate the lanes.

 In addition, automatic signals will be installed at the intersections and guard rails, painted gold and black, will be erected along the pavements.

 Transport department officials said the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has been repairing the roads, and many have already been done. The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners has started repairing and dereserving the tram tracks.

 According to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, the CMC has started repair of pavements of all major roads. Interlocking tiles, instead of concrete, are being used.

 The traffic and transportation engineering department has prepared the blueprint for the installation of traffic signals and guard rails. The Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) will take up the work.

 ?The move is aimed at making vehicular movement smoother on city roads and, at the same time, restoring traffic discipline,?? stated transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 An official of his department, however, expressed doubts over the success of the scheme. ?Most drivers do not pay heed to road markings and median dividers, while pedestrians are found walking on the road, and no action is taken,? he said.

 The TIDC has urged the civic body to provide funds for the repair and maintenance of the guard rails and dividers, as the government does not foot the bill.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim said police also have plans to put up traffic signals.

 Tom Brook, the presenter of BBCs Talking Movies

 It is the offshoot of a voyeuristic culture. Tom Brook sounds disturbed on the phone from New York. He is thinking paparazzi, he is thinking reality shows. The British presenter of BBCs Talking Movies is talking about where celebrity-driven Western popular culture is going.

 There is a commercial repercussion. Publishers and TV producers realise that if they have a celebrity in their content, things become easier to market. If Brook can call a spade a spade, it is because his show has been moving in the opposite direction, aimed at an intelligent, cinema-literate audience.

 Brooks journey in the anchors seat of Talking Movies started in January 1999. My first guest was Dame Judi Dench. Since then, his interviewees have included every actor and director worth his or her script Dean Martin to Gregory Peck, Robert De Niro to Sir Ben Kingsley, George Clooney to Jim Carey. The other day, a colleague pointed out that the show was turning 400 (on November 8). I hadnt even noticed, he says.

 A man who works with the biggest Hollywood names is impressed only by authenticity. Michael Caine (down to earth) and Tom Hanks (engaging) make the cut in top-of-the-mind recall. But the interview with Christopher Reeve, just before the wheelchair-bound actor passed away, remains his most emotional experience. Reeve was a compelling individual. It was inspiring the way he reflected on the meaning of life, what it was to play Superman despite losing mobility.

 Brook has often been on the Oscar red carpet. It is a privilege. But the event is incredibly Hollywood-oriented. Brook is happy with the increasing impact of non-English language movies. India is so resilient to Hollywood. About 95 per cent of the movies are indigenous. Yet Indian and Chinese films are judged in terms of cross-over success. Brook fires a question at the Indian audience Why should it be important to make a mark in the West if a film does well at home?

 The presenter was in Mumbai recently and is clued into multiplex films Maqbool by Vishal Bharadwaj, Monsoon Wedding by Mira Nair Nair has been the most successful with the cross-over. Monsoon Wedding was a bigger hit in Britain and North America than in India. And The Namesake has brought together an international cast.

 Another film-maker he talks of is Karan Johar. He transmits a kind of Indian cool. This, Brook feels, has social implications. In my childhood, the attitude of the British towards immigrants made them feel ashamed of their roots. Now after Indias economic boom, they are feeling good about themselves. This feel-good factor comes from art and culture too. Brook cites Jhumpa Lahiri and Kiran Desai. Sony is even making a film for an Indian audience, he points out.

 Brook had been to Calcutta when he was 17. I travelled to Patna and Bangalore by train as a hippie, with long hair, he laughs.

 The hippie has since gone on to host each one of the 400 episodes of Talking Movies.

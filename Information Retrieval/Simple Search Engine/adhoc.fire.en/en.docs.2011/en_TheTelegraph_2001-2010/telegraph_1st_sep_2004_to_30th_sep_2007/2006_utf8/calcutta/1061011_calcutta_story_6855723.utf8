 Birthday bouquets and bumps for Big B

 WHAT WE WANT AMITABH BACHCHAN TO 

 DO THIS YEAR

 Use 

 your brand better

 When you represent Bollywood at the IIFAs every year, you take Indian cinema so many notches higher every time. A certain Khan may call himself King and a certain Miss World may feel she is Indias gift to the globe, but you are the face of our 100-year film legacy. 

 But when every major star around the world uses his status to help humanity at large, whats stopping you from taking the plunge? If a Richard Gere can fight AIDS in India, what stops you from coming forward and making a difference? You supported Aamir by saying that in a democracy everyone has the right to say but dont you have anything to say about any issue from Narmada to nuclear proliferation?

 Yes, we remember your polio campaign but what we remember most is how effective it was! Why not do more? One ishaara from you and you know the Bollywood world will follow. You have been associated with Unicef for the last four years but have you used your star power to illuminate the lives of millions of children as stated?

 Its really cool to be called the Hottest Vegetarian Alive but there is so much more meat to dig into, so many pressing problems to address. You are set to play Genie (to Alladin) on reel, why not weave your magic in real too?

 Wanted, a bit more social commitment from the biggest B of them all.

 Go 

 international

 Why do you have to wait for a Deepa Mehta to make a Komagatu Maru with you? Assign an agent and tomorrow you will land yourself the biggest of Hollywood ventures. Dont your fans deserve to see you romance a Meryl Streep or exchange verbal volleys with an Al Pacino?

 Come on, you were voted the Greatest Star of Stage or Screen of the Last 1,000 Years by the BBC poll ahead of Sir Lawrence Olivier, Charlie Chaplin and Robert De Niro. You can surely do better than a Bhojpuri film with Ravi Kishen.

 One can understand you signing a series of inane movies to get rid of your debt pile but now that you have reached the pinnacle all over again and look so much at ease at the top, why do you have to sign on crooked dotted lines? Doing films for friends is fine, bud doing bad films for friend or foe is just not the done thing.

 Yes, roles are being written for you here in Bollywood but when will you do a Scent of a Woman or a Million Dollar Baby?

 Its now or never.

 Come 

 back to Calcutta

 You belong here. From the time you worked at Bird and Co. to the time you celebrated the premiere of Zanjeer to the time you danced to Chhukar mere mann ko at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, you have always belonged here. 

 In so many of your interviews, even in the ones with us, you have claimed that you are our jamai. So why not return to your sasural? You surely owe us one film here. It can be the Rituparno Ghosh film you have been looking forward to for so long or even a masala Bengali potboiler like Anusandhan. We are not complaining.

 Sorry, but we cannot be content with your Parineeta voiceover describing the many beauties of Calcutta. We want you here. You know what, the city still goes on a garland binge at Basusree when your films release here. A couple of chocolate bombs still go off around Priya when you arrive on a Friday. Its time to come and retrace your roots.

 Romance 

 Rekha

 On screen, that is. Why not, once and for all, complete the celluloid commitment you made in Silsila? Yes it may lead to some tension around Jalsa and Pratiksha but you are a hardcore professional, arent you? And you, of all people, should know the box-office impact if the two of you come together on screen again.

 You and Hema looked fab in Baghban but as an old couple made for each other. Sorry, but you and Jaya cut a sorry figure in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. And lets not talk about the Revathys and Supriya Pathaks. 

 If theres one lady in the industry 

 who can still set the screen on fire opposite you, it is 

 Rekha. Why not get friend Yash Chopra to make an all-new 

 Silsila with you, Rekha and a twist in the tale?

 WHAT WE WANT AMITABH BACHCHAN 

 NOT TO DO THIS YEAR

 Be 

 oh-so humble

 I am an ordinary man doing a job I consider myself extremely fortunate to get work at this age I am just an actor doing what the director tells me to I was ready to clean floors if I was paid

 It sounds like nails scratching the school blackboard So, can someone please ask Mr Bachchan to stop being so sickeningly humble.

 Why dont you just come out and say it as it is, sir, or should we say Dr? We know the worlds largest film industry shoots and shelves at your whims and wishes, dates and breaks.

 Come on, give us a break from that boring, grating interview routine of you being a nobody.

 Sell 

 every product in town

 We dont want you to sing praises of a certain tel malish, with as much passion as you used to woo a certain Miss Rekha in Silsila. Its like zor ka jhatka and that too zor se lage!

 Right after watching Black one more time, when we find you lecturing us on how white a washing powder can make our clothes, we change colour.

 Come on, there are temples in your name here in Calcutta. Who would want their god to sell hair oil and washing powder?

 Yes, you look charming in your Reid amp; Taylor suit and smart with the Parker pen in your hand but do you have to get into the unknown depths of digestive capsules? Sorry, thats a little difficult to digest.

 Look at Abhishek; say Hello Moto! Why not take a leaf out of juniors endorsement book?

 Be 

 seen with Amar Singh

 Every step you take, every move you make, hes there with you. What next? Amit and Amar doing a Yeh dosti number on a bike down Marine Drive?

 Yes, we know that Amar Singh has been a friend in need for you. But that does that mean you must be seen with him, everywhere.

 Your fans want to see you the actor, you the superstar, not you the Amar Singh shadow.

 And it that was not enough, you the screen demigod for millions go ahead and hail Mulayam Singh Yadav as a saintly, divine figure.

 If you have always been able to draw such a clear line between your personal and professional lives, why inflict your non-filmi friends on your filmi fans? Yeh dil maange no more.

 Be 

 the badman

 Just because certain film-makers have gone nuts, must you follow suit? Even if you bring a fresh twang to Kitne aadmi the? we will choose to remember Tumhara naam kya, hai Basanti? You were, are and will always be Jai for us.

 Today you are playing Gabbar, tomorrow they will ask you to play Loin and day after you will end up playing Shakaal. If RGV says your Gabbar is the hero, does it really make you that? Remember what happened to Family? Whats that, you ask? Precisely our point: who wants to remember Bachchan the badman no one.

 In the Bollywood scheme of things, villains are the bad guys who finish last. Prem Chopra, Amrish Puri, Shakti Kapoor... Amitabh Bachchan? Eeeks!

 Why do you have to tarnish your image in the name of challenging roles? Why not remain Vijay, forever young?

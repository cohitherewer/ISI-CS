 Motorist crushed by buses

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A 30-year-old motorist was killed after his car was trapped and crushed between two state buses on the eastern slope (Calcutta side) of Howrah bridge on Tuesday morning.

 The victim could not be identified till late in the evening. He died on the way to hospital. 

 Police said the driver was rushing towards the city with documents, packets and other articles, despatched by a courier company. Caught between the two buses, he lost control and collided with both before coming to a halt.

 The windshield was shattered, the headlights were smashed and the man lay slumped in a pool of blood. Almost immediately, vehicles on the stretch stopped. Passers-by rushed over and extricated the driver from the mangled remains of the car.

 ?He fell unconscious soon after he was brought out of the vehicle and died while being taken to hospital. It was pathetic,? recounted a witness. 

 Howrah police soon reached the site and cordoned it off. Traffic on both flanks of the bridge was disrupted for some time.

 In another mishap, a 59-year-old employee of the office of the accountant-general of Bengal, Monoranjan Das, died after a vehicle knocked him down in front of Netaji?s statue, off Eden Gardens. Traffic constables rushed to his help and sent him to SSKM Hospital, where he died.

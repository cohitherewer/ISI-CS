 Screen bane for young eyes

 - Spurt in vision problems among urban children

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 All work and no play not only make children dull, but might also damage their vision, say eye experts in the city.

 According to ophthalmologists, a spurt in the cases of myopia and lazy eye among urban youngsters can be traced back to long hours in front of the computer or television screen. Severe headache, eye fatigue, blurred vision and dry eyes are the telltale signs of ophthalmologic problems in children.

 The symptoms are not hard to come by. Four-year-old Arpan was attending school regularly when his mother Sumana Chakraborty noticed something unusual ? while reading books, playing games on the home computer or watching television, the child would tilt his head to one side and frown. 

 Raunak, a Class II student, one day returned home from his south Calcutta school with a severe headache. He complained of blurred vision and told his mother Nina Burman for the first time that for six months he had been finding it difficult to see what the teacher wrote on the blackboard. 

 ?On seeing Arpan behave in this unusual manner, I sensed trouble and took him to an ophthalmologist. He diagnosed the problem as that of lazy eye. Arpan would not use his right eye and strain his left one. That is why he would tilt his head and frown. The muscles of the right eye were becoming weak in the process, affecting his vision,? recounted Sumana Chakraborty. 

 For two years, Arpan?s eyes were alternately kept shut for periods of three months. The treatment is known as occlusion therapy.

 Raunak?s problem was somewhat similar. ?He was diagnosed with eye fatigue and myopia. He can see clearly only with glasses. The doctor asked me not to let him study or watch television for hours at a stretch,? said Nina Burman.

 Both boys were lucky that their problems were diagnosed early enough for their visions to be restored. A delay could have resulted in irreparable damage. 

 ?It is not that every child who complains of these symptoms have either lazy eye or myopia. But incidences of such diseases are on the rise among urban children,? observed P.C. Dey, a south Calcutta-based ophthalmologist. 

 ?With children spending long hours studying or in front of computer monitors or television sets, symptoms such as these have become commonplace,? Dey added.

 Eye surgeon Dwivesh Shah opined that the problem of lazy eye is inherited, but it gets aggravated due to long hours in front of the computer screen or reading books from too close. 

 The relation between myopia and extended hours of study and computer use is more direct. ?All over the world ophthalmologists are trying to find out whether the spurt in myopia among urban children is a result of work from close proximity,? Shah stated.

 ?It is important to take children for eye examination from time to time. Eyes get strained as the lachrymal fluid dries up, causing redness, infection and severe headache,? explained Dey.

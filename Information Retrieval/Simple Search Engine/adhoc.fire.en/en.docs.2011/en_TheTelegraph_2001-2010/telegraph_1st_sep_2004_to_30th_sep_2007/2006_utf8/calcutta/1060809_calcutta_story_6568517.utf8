 Chartbusters to chants

 - Devotees convert dance floor tracks into paeans to gods

 Reshammiya: Just sing it out loud

 Festive fare: start off with Jhalak dikhla ja, pump up the tempo with Zara jhoom jhoom, and rewind with Huzoor not the console count at a city disc, but the play list of bhajan mandalis in town.

 After winning over the drawing room and setting the dance floor on fire, Himesh Reshammiya is turning out to be religious rage, as well.

 The citys bhajan bastions are converting the chartbuster tracks of the Bollywood music director-cum-singer, with more than 30 films under his belt and no studio time for the next three years, into devotional ditties.

 Love him or hate him, you cannot ignore Himesh Reshammiya, says Champa Adiani, of Brindavan Kirtan Mandali in Brindavan Gardens, off EM Bypass. He is playing on TV, on FM channels and even in autos and taxis.

 Adiani feels it makes perfect sense to lift Reshammiyas popular tunes and turn them into bhajans, as the nasal crooner is a hit among both youngsters and the elderly. Many teenagers have joined our group as the tunes are catchy, says Adiani.

 Bhajan singer Deepak Sareen feels Himeshs tracks also have a Sufi appeal. 

 Explaining the trend of borrowing his Bolly tunes, Sareen says: Its a consumer-driven society. Whatever consumers want will be dished out to them. Besides, it also helps new bhajan singers, as they get more work.

 Though the phenomenon of lifting Bollywood tracks is not new, a song must have that extra something to be converted into bhajans and aartis. In the past, numbers like Chhaiya chhaiya and the title track of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham were a big hit with the bhajan and kirtan mandalis.

 According to DJ Akash, anything Himesh Reshammiya hums now turns into a blockbuster. Of the 20 tracks we play in the disc, 15 are his. Its only natural for his tunes to be lifted for other musical activities.

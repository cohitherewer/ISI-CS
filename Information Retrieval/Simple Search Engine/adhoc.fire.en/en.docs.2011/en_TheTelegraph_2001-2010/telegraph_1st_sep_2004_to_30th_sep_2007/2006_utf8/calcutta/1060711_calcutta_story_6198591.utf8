The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 An option of world course

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 School students in east India seeking to pursue International Baccalaureate (IB) programmes are often forced to shift to faraway Mumbai or Pune, which can be quite expensive. Oakridge International School is ready to offer an alternative.

 The IB, initially designed to enable international students to carry qualifications from country to country, was created in 1968 by the Geneva-based International Baccalaureate Organisation.

 The school in Hyderabad is launching an IB programme that is being pitched as the cheapest in the country. The annual cost of an IB at Oakridge will be Rs 4 lakh for boarders. The annual fee elsewhere is in the region of Rs 12 lakh.

 But will the quality of suffer in the bid to keep the costs down? The principal, Janajit Ray, doesn?t think so. 

 ?We don?t import teachers from abroad. Instead, we train the teachers. The IB inspectors will frequently make trips from Geneva to check if we are maintaining the standard,? he elaborated.

 Ray pointed out: ?Although there are many foreign students in the IB programme, a significant number of Indians will be part of the Oakridge course.?

 When asked why the school had opted to open an IB course, Ray replied: ?So many of the traditional educational institutions are very good at turning pupils into photocopiers. The IB system encourages creative thinking and life-long learning.?

 Ray expects a large number of students from West Bengal and the Northeast. ?Some of our best teachers and students are from Bengal. We want to tap into this potential market.?

 The school is building a hostel to accommodate students from outside Hyderabad. 

 Somie Das, who has had a long and distinguished career in education, is part of the team at the helm. Das taught at Gordonstoun School in Scotland, which is well-known for following unique teaching techniques. He was also Prince Charles?s tutor in 1963.

 Das then came back to India to be the headmaster of Doon School. He is associated with Vikas Educational Institutions Limited, the parent body of Oakridge International School.

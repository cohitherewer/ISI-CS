 Narrating a grim and ghastly true story taken from the court files of Bihar, Naba Mayukh Nattya Sangstha?s production, Waarish, unfolds the terrors that result from human vices like lust, depravity, abuse of power and superstition. Chiranji Chowdhury, a wealthy, childless landowner, wants Gulabi, his wife?s maid, to fulfil his obsession about producing an heir. Besides offering her impoverished father property and monetary gains in exchange, Chowdhury also promises that after the birth of his child, he would marry off Gulabi with Raghu, a motor mechanic with whom she is in love. Gulabi, however, is aware that she will suffer a fate similar to that of several other girls of the village, unless she accedes to Chowdhury?s desires. The superannuated landowner also tries to get back his long-lost virility by offering an infant-girl as human sacrifice. Meanwhile, Gulabi gets pregnant by Raghu, and they both flee to save themselves from the wrath of Chowdhury. Direction: Rishi Mukhopadhyay.

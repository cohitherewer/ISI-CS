 Gang rape trio evades police net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The three armed men who allegedly raped a 26-year-old woman in a Baruipur shanty on Sunday night are still at large. Police claimed to have identified the men, but could not arrest them. 

 ?One of them has a criminal record and was involved in a number of dacoities and murders. We are looking for him. He could not be arrested as he changes hideouts frequently after committing a crime. We are collecting more information about the other two,? said an investigating officer.

 The statement of the woman was recorded by police in front of a magistrate of Alipore court on Monday.

 ?We also made arrangements for her medical examination and are awaiting the report. We will leave no stone unturned to arrest the culprits at the earliest,? said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta.

 Members of a local club and neighbours of the woman, who used to work as an ayah in a Park Circus nursing home, have been interrogated in this connection.

 The woman and the child who were in the shanty when the men raided it were also questioned. They were allegedly held at gun-point while the men raped the 26-year-old shortly after the World Cup final started.

 ?We are conducting raids at different places to arrest them. We conducted several raids last night and will continue to do so till the criminals are arrested. We have alerted thanas in the area and provided a description of the men, obtained from different sources. We have found out that the trio lives in the area. They are absconding,? said additional superintendent of police (rural) of South 24-Parganas A.K. Ghosh. 

 The woman had identified one of the men, while police have found out about the other two. All three wore masks, but one of them removed it while leaving the room. The woman identified him. 

 She had been deserted by her husband, a small-time trader in Raidighi, about four months ago. Leaving their son with her mother, she came to Calcutta in search of work. 

 She used to live with 20-year-old Mamata Moira, another ayah, in the Baruipur shanty. Barun, the 12-year-old son of shanty-owner Rajkumar Naskar, was with them on Sunday night.

 According to police, criminals used to frequent the local club. Police on Monday morning demolished the club office, made of tin and bamboo. The club members had provided information about the three rapists, said an officer.

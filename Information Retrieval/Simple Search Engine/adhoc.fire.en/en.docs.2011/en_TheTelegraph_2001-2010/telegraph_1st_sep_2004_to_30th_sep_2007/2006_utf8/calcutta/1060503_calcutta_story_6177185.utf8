The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Bye bye to brace amp; beautiful

Screen On amp; Off

 End credits: Mona Singh 

 as Jassi

 It?s finally time to bid adieu to the original ugly duckling of our small screen who took her own sweet time to emerge as the beautiful swan. May 4, 10 pm, will be the last time Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin will beam across the national airwaves bringing to an end an entire generation of TV viewing. 

 Premiered on Sony on September 1, 2003 as a daily soap, every Monday to Thursday, Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin succeeded in generating tremendous TRPs straightaway and in no time, Jassi with her braces and spectacles was the talk of every town. It was her simplicity and never-say-die spirit that made an icon out of her. 

 ?It will take me another three years to believe that the show is concluding,? said a visibly sad and restless Jassi aka Mona Singh. ?I have lived this character every single moment and right from the crew members and spot boys, all still call me by this name. It is sad that Jassi will no more rule the television screens, but I am confident that the good news that she will leave behind for all her fans (on Thursday) will linger forever.?

 In the final episode, both Jassi and Armaan (Apoorva Agnihotri) go down memory lane and remember the most memorable incidents that punctuated their lives. For the first time, the viewers will get to see the real family of the real Jassi. The other important characters of the show (Mallika, Bebe, Illa, Nandu, Pari...) will share their memories of the show before Jassi springs a big surprise at the end of it all.

 ?Jassi... was a refreshing change from the traditional fare of typical love stories and family dramas,? said N.P. Singh, COO, Sony Entertainment Television. ?The story of Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin is modern, aspirational and captures the simple middle-class world of the plain Jane Jassi.?

 Speaking on the big bye, producer-director Tony Singh said: ?When Sony approached me with the concept of Jassi, I saw it as a sure winner and was more than happy to take on the project. It is unbelievable that we have completed three years in which the show has won accolades and awards and will always be remembered as a path-breaking show on Indian television.?

 Be part of the farewell finale of Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin, this Thursday, 10 pm, on Sony.

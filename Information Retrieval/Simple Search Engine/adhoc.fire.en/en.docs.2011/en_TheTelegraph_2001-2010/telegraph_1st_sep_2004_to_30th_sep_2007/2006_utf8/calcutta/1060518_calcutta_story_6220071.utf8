 The humble cotton acquires special status every summer as the city seeks refuge from the searing heat. Cotton saris, a prime example of the grand and innovative possibilities of the thread, are in great demand at this time of the year.

 Every state of India has its own indigenous speciality in cotton fabric, each different in weaves, textures, motifs, printing techniques and colours. But rarely does one get to see the entire range and even if we do there is no guarantee to their authenticity. That may be one of the reasons why our annual exhibition Summer Cool is so well-received, says M.K. Sengupta, in-charge of the Calcutta branch of the Central Cottage Industries Corporation of India (CCIC).

 Summer Cool, being hosted by the CCIC emporium from May 17 to 26, promises quite a display of handloom saris gleaned from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Bengal, Chennai, Gujarat and other places.

 According to Sengupta, the craftsmen of Rajasthan are leading in terms of variety and skill, followed by those from Bengal. At the exhibition, Rajasthan-style Kota (block hand-printed and zari bordered), tie-and-dye, Bagru, Sanganir and rapid print will vie for attention with Tangails, batiks, block-printed muls, Dhoniakhalis and kantha-stitch saris.

 While the Rajasthani saris range from Rs 776 to Rs 1,320, the Bengal cottons vary between Rs 280 and Rs 3,000.

 A hit every year is the traditional Bagh sari from Madhya Pradesh. Hand-printed with vegetable dye, these are priced at Rs 556. The cotton cutwork saris from Varanasi with elaborate woven patterns catch the eye (priced between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,200), while the traditional Gadwals from Gujarat offer an unbeatable touch of glamour with silk threads used on the borders and aanchal (Rs 2,800-3,000).

 There are Mangalgiris from Andhra Pradesh, Maheshwari from down south, 100 per cent cotton with slight zari work on border and body. Orissa is represented by Sambalpuri, Bomkai and Bichitrapuri, all priced upwards of Rs 1,000. Offbeat mul printed saris from Delhi priced around Rs 600 were a big draw last year and will be on display this year too.

 Another special attraction will be the Summer Cool ensemble. These are hand-printed Tangails and muls designed and created by CCIC. This year we have more designs to choose from, adds Sengupta. 

 Traditional patterns are still what the customer comes looking for at CCIC, but with innovations in fabric, colours and textures. As a result, patterns once typical of Bengal are now being used effectively by weavers of south India, and vice versa. With an eye on comfort and convenience of todays woman, weavers are trying to make the sari light but hardy.

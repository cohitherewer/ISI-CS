 Church snubs school bill

 - Diocese refuses to furnish data for move to monitor working

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The state governments attempt to regulate the functioning of private schools, including those run by Christian missionaries, has hit a hurdle with the Church of North India (CNI) opposing the proposed legislation. 

 A group of CNI members feel the bill will infringe on the minority rights guaranteed to Christians in the Constitution.

 A delegation of the church members met school education minister Partha De at Bikash Bhavan and urged him not to table the bill.

 The minister maintained that the government would not force any school to come under the act.

 Most of our schools are very old. They are regarded among the best in the country, for offering holistic education and maintaining high academic standards. There is no need to bring these schools under any act, as they have always maintained transparency, stated Reverend P.S.P. Raju, bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI.

 Officials of the school education department said the dioceses opposition has worried the government, since it controls several reputed English-medium schools, including the La Martiniere and St Thomas schools, Pratt Memorial, St James, Scottish Church Collegiate and St Johns Diocesan. 

 We had written to the 69 founding bodies of the Christian missionary schools, including the CNI, requesting them to provide their views on the governments decision to frame the bill. Some of the organisations expressed unwillingness to submit their opinion. We have requested them to cooperate. We will wait for their response, said De.

 The government had announced its decision to table a bill to regulate private schools in June this year. 

 It recently sought suggestions from the founding bodies of the church-run schools and promised to frame the bill entirely on the basis of the recommendations.

 According to Bishop Raju, he has made it clear to the government that the schools under the CNIs Calcutta diocese would not submit their suggestions to the education department in connection with the act. We cannot be forced to come under the control of an act, he asserted.

 He claimed that bishops of the other dioceses of the CNI, including the Durgapur diocese and the diocese of eastern Himalayas, which controls several sought-after schools in the hills, were against the act.

 The Barrackpore diocese of the CNI, controlling schools under the church in North and South 24-Parganas, however, is in favour of the bill, said church sources.

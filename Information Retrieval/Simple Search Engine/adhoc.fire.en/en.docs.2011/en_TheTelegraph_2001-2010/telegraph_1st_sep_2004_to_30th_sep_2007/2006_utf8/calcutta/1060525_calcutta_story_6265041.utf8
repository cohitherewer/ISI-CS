 From catching the matches on television and mobile screens to contests for everyone? The city sure is in the grip of World Cup fever.

 Cellular service provider Airtel launched a slew of services and specials revolving around ?the greatest soccer tournament on earth?, while ESPN Software India reiterated its connect with the Calcutta audiences on Cup-eve.

 Airtel subscribers stand to win a trip to their favourite football country this season by dialling 646 and screaming ?goal, as crazily as they can?.

 World Cup content available from Airtel includes match updates and alerts, predictions from ESPN STAR Sports presenters, wallpapers, video clips and ring tones.

 The mobile version of FIFA World Cup 2006 game will also be available on Airtel.

 ?Sports is a key engagement area for us where we can connect with the target group,? said Vivek Bali, senior vice-president (marketing) for Airtel.

 The company plans to add 6,000 base stations in the east this financial year and invest around Rs 200 crore in the Calcutta circle and Rs 400 crore in the West Bengal circle, Bali added.

 Airtel?s special activities for Calcutta include roadshows, vans with screens doing the rounds of the city and screenings at malls and highrises during the World Cup.

 With the kick-off only weeks away, TV sales have picked up as well. ?Sales have already doubled. The entry level has gone up from 21-inch to 29-inch with a preference for LCDs and plasmas,? said Jiten Chawla, an LG dealer.

 ?We expect viewership ratings for the World Cup to match those of Test cricket featuring India,? Nirmal Dayani, director-marketing for ESPN Software India, told Metro.

 ESPN STAR Sports, Cup partner of Airtel and Adidas, will beam ?all the matches? of the month-long tournament live.

 ?Calcutta is certainly a thrust market for us and there will be an explosion across all media. Taking the Gyarah Hindustani contest forward, we will show the World Cup through the eyes of the 11 Indian winners,? Dayani added.

Be at your ethnic best

Lifestyle Zone

RIDDHIMA SEAL

Ethnic is the look that suits you best and youre 

bowled over by the kurtas sported by actors in period films. If thats your 

style preference, then the recently opened Gatha showroom at The Gariahaat Mall 

is your place to be.

At the third Gatha outlet in the city, the first thing 

that catches the eye as you enter the 5,000 sq ft one-stop ethnic shop is the 

riot of colours in kurtas, ethnic shirts, stoles and headgear for men.

Vibrancy is the name of the game this season. 

Men are willing to experiment with bold colours like red, maroon and deep yellow, 

says Raju Dugar, proprietor of Gatha.

Basic buys

The basic kurta section houses the uppers in solid 

colours like red, maroon, green and blue with minimal embroidery. 

And of course there are the eternal favourites in 

white and beige with embroidery on the collar and around the button lines. 

There is no substitute for these plain kurtas. 

Simple but elegant, they have an appeal of their own. While you can wear one to 

work over a pair of casual denims, you can also lend yourself a dressy look by 

pairing them with pyjamas and matching footwear, says Dugar.

Prices of the kurtas in this section start from Rs 

295. The section also boasts a whole range of newly-introduced vegetable-dyed 

ethnic shirts in cotton, khadi, linen and silk. These are priced at Rs 599-plus.

Dressy digs

Chikan-work and hand-embroidered kurtas in 

silk and satin are the pop picks in the dressier variety. The palette here comprises 

maroon, fuchsia and earthy tones like mustard and brown.

A lot of hard work goes into creating each piece 

here as we dont use machine embroidery at all. And every piece is one of 

its kind, says Dugar. These heavier kurtas start at Rs 1,200 and go up to 

Rs 6,000.

Grooms garb

The wedding section at Gatha steals the show with 

complete wardrobe solutions for D-day.

Heavily embroidered silk sherwanis come in 

rich tones of beige, cream and maroon and each piece is worth a look.

The embroidery is mostly done in gold and silver thread 

with generous doses of zari and sequin work thrown in for the ornate effect.

We have an in-house designer always present 

at the store to assist to-be grooms in choosing their attire. And this service 

comes at no extra cost. Its our effort to ensure that our buyers get the 

best, smiles Dugar. 

The bridal collection is priced at Rs 10,000-plus.

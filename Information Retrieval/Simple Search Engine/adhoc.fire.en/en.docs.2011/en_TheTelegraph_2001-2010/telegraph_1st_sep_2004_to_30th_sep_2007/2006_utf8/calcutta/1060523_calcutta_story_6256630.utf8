The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Held for murder 5 years on

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Nearly five years after the murder of Sailen Das, former Dum Dum municipality chairman, the police netted four men at Raigachi, near Rajarhat, on the city?s northern fringes, on Sunday.

 Das was shot dead in front of his Dum Dum home on August 13, 2001, when he was about to leave for the municipality office. 

 Three men on a motorcycle pumped bullets into the former municipality chairman, leaving him dead on the spot.

 There was a furore after the arrest of Sudhir Bhattacharya, a key CPM functionary in the Dum Dum area and Das?s predecessor in the municipality, when it was found out that he had masterminded the murder. 

 Those arrested on Sunday night include Arpan Roychowdhury, Amit Chakraborty and Shivaprasad Das, all in their 20s. The fourth man, Tapas Roychowdhury, 32, who was out on bail, was picked up as he had not appeared before the police station, as directed by the court.

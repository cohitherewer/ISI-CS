The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Jawed shamim

 Deputy commissioner, traffic, Calcutta Police

 This year, the crowd was significantly less in the daytime. The major part of this morning crowd comes from the outskirts of the city, be it Baruipur or Kalyani. But this time they could not make it due to the rain that hit the city on all three days. Many of these people came at night this time. There was an increase in the volume of pandal-hoppers from late afternoon itself. Usually, the evening crowd comprises only the city folk. But this year it was a mixed crowd that was out in the streets.

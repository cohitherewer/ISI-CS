 Convicts on fast in jail 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Demanding humane treatment from the Presidency jail authorities, the four convicts of the American Center attack case have been on a hunger strike for the past 72 hours. 

 They allege that they are being provided sub-standard food, denied medicine and regular medical check-ups and are not even allowed to take daily baths.

 According to a jail officer, the four convicts ? Hasrat Alam, Musarrat Hussain, Rehan Alam and Adil Hasan ? have been fasting since Wednesday morning, to protest the ?sub-human? treatment meted out to them in the jail. 

 The four, along with three others, were sentenced to death last year by the special court at Presidency jail.

 ?As usual, food was served to them on Wednesday morning but they refused to eat. Soon after, they announced that they were on a hunger strike and would break the fast only after their demands were met. They often misbehave with jail staff and we have informed the jail superintendent about it,? an officer said on condition of anonymity.

 Another jail officer said Musarrat complained of a stomach ache at night last week. 

 ?Since there were no doctors in the jail hospital, we asked him to wait. He was taken to hospital early next morning and was treated. Later, he got enraged over the delay in treatment and made a scene and abused us,? the officer added.

 ?The four convicts often misbehave with jail staff. Last Saturday, Rehan abused an employee and even threatened to hit him when he was being taken out for a bath in the morning. Next day, he was not taken out and he made an issue of it,? he said.

 Kamal Kumar Mukherjee, superintendent, Presidency jail, said: ?I will look into their allegations.?

 He said extra security bandobast was made in and outside Presidency jail after some Maoists, including Sushil Roy, who were convicted recently, were brought in.

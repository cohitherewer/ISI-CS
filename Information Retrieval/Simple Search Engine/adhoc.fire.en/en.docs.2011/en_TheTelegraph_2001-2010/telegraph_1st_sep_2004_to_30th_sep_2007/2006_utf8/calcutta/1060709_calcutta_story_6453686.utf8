The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 THE CALCUTTAN?S 

 CUP

 June 9. Germany vs Costa Rica, 

 9.30 pm IST. The magic month had kicked-off. The quadrennial 

 showpiece Calcutta waits for so eagerly was underway. Thirty-two 

 teams, 64 matches, 30 days. Time to root for and rant, cry 

 for and curse.

 As the tournament progressed, 

 the triumphs and tribulations in Germany triggered tectonic 

 shifts in Calcutta ? shameful switching of sides, dramatic 

 changing of colours.

 Monada in the para ? still 

 sporting a Ronaldo jersey on Saturday ? labelled us ?subidhabadi 

 (opportunists)?. But we turned a deaf ear. After all, what?s 

 worse than having the team you?ve backed being knocked out 

 of World Cup 2006? Being mute spectators and not rooting 

 for a team in the running for the Cup, of course.

 So when our favourites fell by 

 the wayside, we mourned through the night and then moved 

 on to pick another team to cheer and champion?

 On the eve of the France vs Italy 

 final, Metro tracks the mood swings of the soccer-crazy 

 Calcutta supporter through a month of midsummer madness 

 ruled by Teamgeist, a sphere no more than 70 cm in diameter 

 and 450 gm in weight

 KICK-OFF

 Time to drown in a sea of green 

 and yellow ? again. They are called Brazil. They wear the 

 crown of defending champions. They have Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, 

 Kaka and Robinho. There was no doubt with which team Calcutta?s 

 heart lay in distant Germany.

 ?Hexa? hurrah was the mood from 

 Golbari to Gol Park. ?Brazil dada, Brazil?. Orai cup 

 niye jabe?? were the words spoken by the wise men of 

 soccer support in almost every para. Yes, what ?PK? 

 and ?Chuni? were saying the day after, Pappuda and 

 Chintuda had said the night before.

 The sea of green and yellow was 

 punctuated by islands of blue and white. In the Brazil vs 

 Argentina, Parreira vs Pekerman support showdown, Riquelme 

 was pitted against Ronaldinho, Crespo against Ronaldo and 

 Messi against Robinho.

 South America held sway everywhere, 

 be it Harish Chatterjee Street (Mamata Banerjee?s para 

 was all for Argentina) or Harish Mukherjee Road (the 

 writing on the wall was all Brazil).

 As giant flags, colourful streamers 

 and confetti dotted shabby buildings in Calcutta north and 

 south, the Latino campaign got off to contrasting starts. 

 The Brazilian big guns didn?t fire at the start, hardly 

 hitting the target till the second half of its last group 

 match against Japan. ?Brazil ekhon warm-up korchhe? 

 Knockout ta ashte de? ? waiting for the knockout 

 matches was the name of the game in the Brazil camp.

 Argentina?s incredible 24-pass 

 mass move that capped the 6-0 demolition of Serbia and Montenegro 

 got the blue-and-white brigade in Calcutta crowing: ?Argentinar 

 moto bench strength karur nei; Maradona ke 

 dekhli??

 The supporter pie had a few novel 

 ingredients ? ?I am with England for Beckham?; ?We are with 

 Ghana?; ?Klinsmann has really turned this German team around? 

 it?ll be great if the home team wins?.

 The loyalties were defined, the 

 battle-lines were drawn, the favourites had all made it 

 to the knockout round.

 City Odds: Favourites Brazil, 

 followed by Argentina and England.

 KNOCK 

 OUT

 The pre-quarters went according 

 to plan. An ageing France provided the only surprise spark 

 with a rejuvenated Zidane-Viera-Henry combine sinking the 

 Spanish armada. ?Jab tak Zidane hai, hum 

 France ko support karenge,? became an 

 audible murmur within the city support base.

 The quarter-finals broke most 

 hearts, upset every calculation, changed every equation 

 and forced a return to the loyalty drawing board.

 Both the ?Calcutta? teams were 

 ambushed in the quarters. One by Zizou?s genius in his twilight 

 zone and Brazil?s abject failure to play the game, forget 

 the beautiful one, and the other by Jose Pekerman?s momentary 

 lapse of reason (imagine being kicked out of the Cup with 

 Riquelme, Saviola and Messi on the bench!) and Germany?s 

 fighting spirit.

 ?Shob shesh?? was a refrain 

 reverberating around town. Suddenly, the groggy mornings 

 after didn?t seem worth the bleary-eyed late nights anymore. 

 And the beer-burger combos didn?t taste half as crisp.

 But then life must go on and the 

 Cup has to reach Berlin.

 So we started scanning the line-up 

 and came up with our proxy ? Portugal, of course! Why? Why 

 not? The man at the helm, ?Big Phil? Scolari, himself was 

 Brazilian. His team would surely satiate our samba craving. 

 Then there was Deco, Brazil-born. Cristiano Ronaldo and 

 Luis Figo were both household heroes, thanks to Man-U and 

 Real. And yes, their colours reminded us so much of Mohun 

 Bagan.

 Ricardo?s heroics in goal had 

 seen Scolari?s squad scrape past a lacklustre England in 

 a bruising encounter. Beckham?s Cup had ended in tears, 

 Rooney?s in the red.

 Some Argentina supporters, who 

 went into hiding after being beaten by Klinsie?s men, zeroed 

 in on Zizou?s team. ?They have beaten Brazil. Let?s go with 

 them.? The same logic ? enemy?s enemy is the best friend 

 ? saw some Brazil supporters rallying around the home team, 

 Germany.

 City Odds: Favourites Germany, 

 followed by Italy and France.

 FINAL 

 COUNTDOWN

 The semis sent Ballack?s boys 

 and Figo?s fans crashing. One by a solid all-round performance 

 by Lippi?s lads, the others to Zidane?s pinpoint penalty 

 and Thurram?s dour defence.

 ?Ja, aar kauke support 

 korbo na?? was the miffed verdict from the majority. 

 The rest were divided by head (Italy) and heart (France).

 So it?s D-Day (er, night) under 

 the brilliant ?ring-of-fire? lights of the history-steeped 

 Olympiastadion in Berlin. The beers are in the chiller, 

 TV dinner stacked in, friends invited over.

 Yet, something?s amiss ? no Brazil, 

 no Argentina, but surely we can?t sit through a World Cup 

 final on a Sunday night without lending our lungs to one 

 team?

 We are sentimental souls, aren?t 

 we? So Zizou?s Les Bleus it should be. A few mesmerising 

 moves from the midfield maestro on his swansong can still 

 salvage the climactic hour for Calcutta and place Zidane 

 on Maradona?s pedestal ? well, almost.

 Any takers for Italy? Those who 

 vote for history over high drama, professionalism over passion.

 That includes the bookies, we 

 see.

 City Odds: 90 minutes 

 ? Italy victory (207:100)/stalemate (285:100)/France 

 victory (355:100).

 FAN FOLLOWING

 Chiraag Paul, 17, training 

 in Birmingham City Football Club academy to be a professional 

 footballer in England

 ?My love for Brazil?s football 

 was enhanced after I went to train in a Sao Paolo academy. 

 It?s an amazing country with amazing people. I?m an out-and-out 

 Brazil fan, for their flair and great technique. They are 

 also very tactically aware usually, but in Germany, they 

 were all over the place? They just didn?t fire.

 One can?t really switch allegiance 

 overnight. However, once Brazil got knocked out in the quarters, 

 I found myself leaning towards Portugal somewhat, maybe 

 because of Deco and Scolari, and perhaps more so due to 

 Cristiano Ronaldo, since I?m an avid Man-U fan.

 The final is a difficult call. 

 My heart says France, but my head says Italy.?

 Preeti Jhawar, 

 fashion designer

 ?I was supporting Brazil from 

 the start since they are always the leaders and the obvious 

 favourites. After they went out, I started supporting Germany. 

 The German team really came up in a big way this time; there 

 were quite a few good-looking players as well. Between Italy 

 and France, I?ll support the Italians. I feel the Italian 

 team is better than the French and most of the guys are 

 very hot!?

 Sreshthaa, model 

 ?Everyone was supporting Brazil 

 passionately so I began by cheering for the hosts, instead. 

 Now that Germany?s out, frankly I am not really supporting 

 anyone. Why? Well, let?s say I haven?t thought much about 

 these two teams!?

 Jisshu Sengupta, 

 actor

 ?All my support went to Argentina 

 because of my childhood crush on Maradona. After their exit, 

 I started rooting for Portugal, a team I must admit I have 

 never before seen play so brilliantly. I also developed 

 a special corner for Ghana somewhere along the way. Now, 

 for the final game, my vote goes to France, but for no particular 

 reason.?

 Vicky, DJ 

 at Venom

 ?I was harbouring a predictable 

 soft spot for Brazil all the way. Then I was rooting for 

 Portugal. But with both out of the tournament, I am now 

 supporting France. Honestly, I don?t care much about the 

 French but I am looking forward to Zinedine Zidane?s last 

 game. He?s been my favourite soccer star for quite some 

 time now. Moreover, I don?t think there?s too much to look 

 out for in Italy.?

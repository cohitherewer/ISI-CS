 Based on a mediaeval Bengali literary piece by Chandrabati Devi, this play takes off from a famous episode from the Manasa-Mangal verses. Yashodhara prayed fervently for a son and Goddess Manasa fulfilled her wish by granting her a son. An indebted Yashodhara named her son Kenaram (a gift from the goddess). However, Kenaram was an ill-fated baby who lost his mother within seven months. His father took him to his maternal uncle, who gladly accepted the responsibility of bringing up the child. After some time, Kenaram?s father deserted the child and went missing. Soon after the clouds of famine loomed low over the land and Kenaram?s uncle sold him off to a man in lieu of food. The man had seven sons, all of them were infamous dacoits. As he grew up among them, Kenaram, too, turned into a dacoit, but of a different kind! He was brave, notorious and really good at his work but he had a philosophy, strange though it may sound, that was all his own.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Dashyu Kenaram, produced by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

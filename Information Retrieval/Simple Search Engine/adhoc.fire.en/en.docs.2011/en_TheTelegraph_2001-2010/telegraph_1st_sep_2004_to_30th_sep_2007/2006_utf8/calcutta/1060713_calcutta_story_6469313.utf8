 A young amateur theatre group 

 called The Hobbits will present a dramatised version of 

 Matilda by Roald Dahl at Gyan Manch on July 13, 6 pm. Directed 

 and produced by Abhik Bhattacherji, Kevin Shah and Dipawnita 

 Das, the play attempts a modern-day take on the old story. 

 Shreya Bhattacharya and Arpita Elias will be the two female 

 leads, Matilda and Miss Honey. Priyanka Sinha will play 

 the evil Miss Trunchbull, while Shubhanker Bhattacharya 

 and Poushali Saha will take on the roles of Matildas 

 parents. Ria Arora is Matildas best friend Lavender. 

 Aman Shah will be Bruce Bogtrotter who ate the chocolate 

 cake.

 The Hobbits aims to be as adventurous, adorable and fun-loving 

 as the characters of J.R.R. Tolkiens book from which 

 it takes its name. As one group member put it: The 

 Hobbits may be extremely little, but they possessed immense 

 creativity. In their true spirit, we endeavour to continue 

 their race by incorporating their love for spectacles.

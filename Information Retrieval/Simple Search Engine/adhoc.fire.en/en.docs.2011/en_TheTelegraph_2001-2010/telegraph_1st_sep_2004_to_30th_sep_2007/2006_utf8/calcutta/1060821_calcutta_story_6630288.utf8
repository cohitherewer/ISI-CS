The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A task force for tech town

 - Security, infrastructure key concerns

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 A task force has been constituted to tackle the security and infrastructure issues affecting the information technology (IT) industry in the city. The team will work towards making Sector V more attractive to foreign investors. 

 The task force, comprising representatives of the industry, police and the civic authorities, will act as a bridge between the IT companies and the government. One of its primary aims will be to revamp the image of Brand Bengal in terms of security, planning and infrastructure. It will also highlight the requirements of small and medium-scale enterprises. 

 We decided to form the task force following a workshop on security and infrastructure problems plaguing the industry, organised by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on August 12. The industry, police and the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority will be represented on the team, said the task force head and managing director of DataBazaar S.P. Mukherjee.

 The other members of the task force include CEO of VisionComptech Prabir Dasgupta and managing director of Acclaris Kalyan Kar. 

 The investors have to feel safe before they come here. Sector V has to be an attractive place in all respects. The task force will chart out a roadmap to achieve this, stated S. Radhakrishnan, vice-president of Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 

 The task force will strive to improve security in the township and upgrade its infrastructure. The industry is looking at the safety aspect closely, after some IT workers in Bangalore recently became victims of crimes.

 It is our duty to provide a safe environment to employees. Security tops our priority list. We are contemplating many steps, added Mukherjee. 

 According to industry sources, the task force will initially focus on an orientation programme for Sector V cops, a pre-paid taxi stand where the antecedents of the drivers will be known, more street lights, beautification of the area and controlled access to the township. Infrastructure issues, like widening of roads and a private transport system, will also be taken up. 

 The roads are so narrow that most of the intersections become bottlenecks during rush hours. Buses stop wherever they wish to, adding to the chaos. The vendors occupy space where they cannot. The township is being promoted abroad as investor-friendly, but such key aspects are being ignored. This has to stop for Sector V to become investor-friendly in the true sense, asserted a senior IT executive. 

 A website called www.nabadiganta.org has been started to enable all stakeholders track the developments in Sector V. The findings of the task force will be put up on the website.

 We will have to predict the problems we might encounter and find solutions to them. Infrastructure is the first thing that comes to mind, said D.K. Chaudhuri, chairman of the recently formed Salt Lake-Rajarhat Committee.

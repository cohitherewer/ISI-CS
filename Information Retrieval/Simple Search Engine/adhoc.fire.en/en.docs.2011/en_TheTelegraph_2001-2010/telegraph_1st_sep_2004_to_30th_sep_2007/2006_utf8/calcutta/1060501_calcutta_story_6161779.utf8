 The Palladian Lounge and Spandan Art Gallery present Art for Giving, an exhibition of art and sculpture showcasing the works of over 30 artists, including veterans like Suhas Roy, Kartick Pyne, Shyamal Dutta Ray, Atin Basak, Wasim Kapoor, Sanatan Dinda, Keshav Roy (one of his paintings appears above) and Partha Bhattacharya. Also on display are creations by stalwarts of the Bengal school like Biren De, Sukhen Ganguly and Shantanu Ukil. Sculptures in bronze, some of them by renowned master Suren De, and other Art Deco? pieces like busts of famous personalities, animalaire and figurative studies and surreal abstracts occupy pride of place at the show. A key attraction of the exhibition is a terracotta sculpture by the legendary Ramkinkar Baij. Offering some of the best in modern, abstract, figurative, folk and representative art, each having its own distinctive mood, theme, style and chromatic treatment, the show is being held in aid of Hope Foundation Calcutta, an organisation devoted to the cause of the underprivileged.

 Fever plus sniffle? Viral

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Viral fever is back and people of all age groups are at risk.

 For the past two weeks, hospitals across Calcutta have been receiving a steady stream of patients with medium-grade fever, body ache, headache, nausea and other ailments.

 We are getting lots of patients with symptoms of viral fever. They are mostly running temperatures between 100 and 102 degrees and suffering from headache, chest infection, cold and cough. Dengue and malaria, too, are being detected, said Milan Chetri, consultant physician of internal medicine at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.

 According to doctors, patients in Calcutta are showing symptoms of four types of viral fever. The most common causes pain in the joints, headache and lethargy. Another type, Allergic Rhinitis, is accompanied by severe cough and cold. This type, too, is quite common, added Chetri. 

 The symptoms of the first two types are common to the third type, apart from loose motion, vomiting and stomach ache.

 There is yet another type of viral infection, Japanese encephalitis, which affects the central nervous system. This, however, is not very common, Chetri stated. 

 Symptomatic treatment is generally recommended for viral fever. The main objective is to keep the body temperature under control with medicines, opined N.B. Debnath, head of the medicine department of SSKM Hospital. Usually, the fever stays for four to five days. Things can turn worse if the patient is suffering from respiratory distress. 

 Children are falling prey to viral fever as much as adults. 

 At BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, about 45 of the 55 patients admitted daily on an average are suffering from viral fever. Most of the children are suffering from fever and acute respiratory infection. We had to set up a special nebuliser unit for treating them, said M.K. Chatterjee, medical superintendent of the hospital.

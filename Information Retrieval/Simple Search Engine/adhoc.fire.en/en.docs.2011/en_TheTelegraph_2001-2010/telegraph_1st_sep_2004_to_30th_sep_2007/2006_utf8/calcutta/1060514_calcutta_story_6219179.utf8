 What: 

 Haveli, a Rajasthani theme party. 

 Where: Hyatt Regency, Calcutta.

 When: Friday night.

 The party: The ballroom was done up along the theme of the evening. There were women selling bangles and men tying turbans on the heads of the guests. The entertainment menu had nine types of traditional dance forms from Rajasthan.

 The guests were treated to lip-smacking varieties of chaats, Chicken Biryani, Mutton Roganjosh, Mango Rabri, Moong Dal Halwa and jalebis.

 After dinner, the crowd took the dance floor and jived away to tracks like Aashiq banaya aapne, Aapki kashish, Kajra re and Bin tere sanam. 

 Voiceover: Parties without themes tend to get boring after a point of time. So we decided to have a theme-based party where there was ample scope for various musical and cultural activities, over and above the tracks being played by the DJ. People enjoyed the party and the food was a big hit. The idea seems to have worked, said a spokesperson for the hotel adjacent to the Salt Lake stadium.

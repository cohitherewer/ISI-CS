 Melody mix

Sananda Tilottama epitomises a modern woman 

who has deep-rooted values. Class Apart is a fusion band that blends classical 

vocals with a Western groove and hence the two brands fit perfectly, assures 

Neel Adhikary, western vocalist of the band commissioned to compose a signature 

theme for Sananda Tilottama.

 The signature theme of eastern Indias largest beauty pageant is about some percussion, lots of hip-hop rhythms and a definite leaning towards world music.

 This year, Class Apart takes the story forward with a new, revamped version. Revamped enough to lend an exciting updated feel, yet very much on the same lines to retain signature elements.

 Santanu Bandyopadhyay of Bishnupur Gharana, the eastern classical vocalist of the band, confirms that though the basic hook remains the same, there is a definite change in the Tilottama piece.

 There is a touch of more percussion, stronger beats and this year, apart from Sirs (Bandyopadhyay) voice we have used my voice as well, explains Neel, also the lead singer of rock band Span.

 ass Apart, the teacher-student band, was formed almost four years ago when Neel in the midst of some hip-hop and house was asked to do some programming on raag Malkauns.

 Once Sir sang it we knew that we had a winner. Class Apart was born as we began a journey of experimentation, Neel recalls. 

 Their journey, a true balance of east and west, has so far been fruitful. Apart from a five-city-six-show US tour, they also have to their credit an album ? Class Apart One. 

 The association with Sananda goes back to 2004 when Class Apart played at a Sananda Carnival in Nalban.Tilottama followed the next year where along with the catchy theme they composed, the band also provided the catwalk music. 

 This year too, we have done the music for the western round at the contest, adds Neel.

 The eastern round, on the other hand, boasts interesting Indo-fusion by Debasis Sen, world music composer. 

 I have used the sitar differently and with that I have combined trance music with classical raags, reveals Debasis, in the music arena for 10 years now.

 So, next Saturday night at the Tilottama finals, keep your eyes and ears open.

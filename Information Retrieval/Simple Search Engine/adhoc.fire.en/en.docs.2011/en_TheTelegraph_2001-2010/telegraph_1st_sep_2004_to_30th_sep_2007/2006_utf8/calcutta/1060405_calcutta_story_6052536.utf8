The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buoyancy over embassy school

 - CITY?S GROWTH WELL-ROUNDED

 A city on the cusp of reaping results, having invested time and energy in self-scrutiny and towards changing perception. A city now confident and keen to engage as equals, a city that offers a ?fascinating montage? of South Asian and European cultures. A city that?s poised to embrace the Wal-Marts and the Microsofts.

 That?s Calcutta in snapshots for Henry V. Jardine, who assumed charge as US consul-general in town on August 11, 2005, after having served as management officer at the US consulate-general in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and as consular and political officer in Dhaka and in Bridgetown, Barbados.

 ?Much of the perspective of Calcutta has been set by outsiders and that external perception doesn?t always do this unique city justice. Yes, Calcutta has taken a few knocks, but it functions and now seems to have a greater sense of pride and identity, that has resulted in well-rounded growth, and not just in IT, as is often purported,? Jardine tells Metro.

 The consul-general is buoyant about the setting up of the American International School later this year. He confirms that the international school in town has been approved by the US embassy and hopes to roll it out by August this year.

 The product of a bilateral pact between the US state department and the Union ministry of external affairs (MEA), the school will be administered by the US Embassy School in New Delhi as a satellite project.

 ?It?s a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, really, and the demand may or may not be there. We will kick off with the 5-7 age group as a pilot on the consulate campus (5/1, Ho Chi Minh Sarani) itself, and going by demand, shift to a bigger premises later,? he points out.

 Aimed at facilitating a ?seamless transition? for expatriate students, the eligibility criteria for admission are possession of green card/foreign passport for parents/wards or a special nomination by the MEA.

 ?The embassy school will fill a niche need, offering a US curriculum for the first time in this city, and it won?t be in competition with any of the established institutions of Calcutta,? Jardine clarifies. From a purely diplomatic perspective, he also hopes the school will in future offer the consulate office ?a broader pool? of talent to recruit personnel from.

 Jardine is bullish about US business coming to town and about the American Chamber of Commerce. ?Biggies like Cisco, Dell and Microsoft are looking at investing billions of dollars in India and they can?t write off a third of the country by ignoring Calcutta and West Bengal,? he stresses.

 ?And the fact that AmCham is here shows there?s a critical mass that justifies a chapter in Calcutta. The chamber can work towards improving perception and showcasing the business opportunities that exist in these parts.?

 The US diplomat is hopeful the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regime will soon open the door to Wal-Mart and other US retail giants.

 ?We understand there?s still some hesitation and jobs is clearly the main issue, but those doubts should soon dissipate as Wal-Mart would enable the farmers to fetch better price for their produce, while ensuring more competitive rates for the consumers,? he adds.

 Jardine, who is in ?constant touch? with Washington over facilitating business and cultural ties, feels the timing has to be right for the entry of US players, who always prefer ?doing their homework? rather than following the herd.

 Not just embracing new enterprises, Calcutta, with its ?strong sense of scale, potential and raw material?, can create special neighbourhoods by restoring its ?splendid old quarters? and putting those to judicious adaptive reuse, Jardine also observes.

 Laser therapy cuts loss of blood 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 With the newly-introduced laser technology in the city, kidney stones or prostrate tumours can now be easily removed with minimum or no blood loss, claim doctors. 

 The new laser treatment facilities, now available at some of the hospitals, are also used for treating prostrate enlargement, bladder tumours, kidney and ureteric stones. The therapy can also be used as a laser knife in uro-lap surgery and uro-oncology surgery. 

 The most advanced laser technology reduces the trauma by virtually no blood loss. In addition, it also saves your valuable time by reducing the hospital stay, said Shivaji Basu, chief urologist of Wockhardt Hospital and Kidney Institute, Calcutta. The hospital on Thursday launched the comprehensive laser programme for urology.

 Patients with heart disease can also undergo laser surgery. For a cardiac patient, who had undergone cardiac bypass surgery and is on anti-coagulant therapy, any kind of surgery can be a big risk. Because, if the therapy is stopped, there can be a huge loss of blood during a surgery as it stops coagulation of blood.

 However, with the new laser techniques, there is no such risk, as the blood loss is minimum. So, the anti-coagulant need not be stopped, explained Basu.

 At present, the hospital is using two types of laser therapy Holmium and Thulium for operating both kidney stones and prostrate tumour, which can be benign and malignant. The Holmium laser can remove kidney stones while the Thulium laser can treat both stones and prostrate tumours. 

 During surgery, a laser fibre is passed through a nephroscope, cystoscope or ureteroscope and reaches the site of surgery to vapourise the stone and remove the prostrate tumour, so that the biopsy can be done. 

 According to R.K. Gopala Krishna, member of Wockhardt Hospitals urology team, the technology can also be used as a laser knife for laparoscopic and oncology surgeries. 

 Each year, we spend around Rs 1.5 crore to 3 crore at the Calcutta unit for upgrading the technology, said Vishal Bali, chief executive officer of Wockhardt Hospitals. 

 Sumedha Sen, chief executive officer of Woodlands Hospital, said the German Revolix laser is being used at the hospital and has given excellent results.

 Consultants experienced in prostate surgery have been specially trained in Germany. The patients have reported satisfaction with the results in comparison to other conventional methods, claimed Sen.

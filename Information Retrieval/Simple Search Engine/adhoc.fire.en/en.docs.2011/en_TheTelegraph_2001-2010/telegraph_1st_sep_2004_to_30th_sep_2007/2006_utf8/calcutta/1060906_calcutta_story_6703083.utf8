 After Greg, Bagmundi ban

 - Organisers told to tone down festive illumination

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The ban on the portrayal of Greg Chappell as Mahisasura has been followed by a diktat that the Bagmundi trekking tragedy cannot be recreated in the Durga puja illumination.

 The retelling of the mishap, the police argument goes, will trigger an unsavoury controversy, just as the Indian cricket coach as demon may ve provocative in the hometown of Sourav Ganguly.

 We do not want the tragic episode to be displayed in Puja lighting, said deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee. It has created a lot of controversy and hurt the families of the three students who died in the mishap. Besides, an accident should not be a source of entertainment.

 The request to Puja organisers has come with a word of caution, that any act of violation will invite action. We will definitely intervene if an organiser ignores our plea. No one has the right to trigger a controversy or play with a persons sentiments, Chatterjee added.

 CID officers have probed the death of the three students, including two girls, who had gone to Bagmundi, in Purulia, with two others for a trek. It was an accident caused by a flash flood in a rivulet. Still, people are raising a lot of questions, said an officer.

 What had fuelled the row was the condition of the girls bodies they had no clothes on, he added. We fear if an organiser chooses to depict how the girls bodies were being swept away, it might give rise to another round of controversy and shock the victims families. Chatterjee feels police will not have to intervene, as no one wants to mar the festive spirit.

 Not just Chappell or the Bagmundi deaths, police do not want portrayal of any event that may stir sentiment.

 So, banned is the portrayal of former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh playing a role in the release of the passengers of a hijacked aircraft in exchange for three terrorists. It could create a political controversy, warned an officer.

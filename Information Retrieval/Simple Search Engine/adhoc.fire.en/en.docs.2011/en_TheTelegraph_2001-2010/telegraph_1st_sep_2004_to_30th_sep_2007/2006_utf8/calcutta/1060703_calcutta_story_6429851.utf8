 Bard buffet: as you like it

 Vishal Bhardwaj?s much-awaited Omkara is yet another example of the enduring appeal that Shakespearean drama has on celluloid, writes Pratim D. Gupta

 Cassio becomes Kesu. Emilia is Indu. Iago is changed to Langda. Desdemona is Dolly. And Othello is Omi Shukla. Vishal Bhardwaj?s Bollywood adaptation of William Shakespeare?s Othello may be on the other cinematic end of a Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, but Omkara could well be the movie that can?t go wrong.

 Apart from the stunning cast including Ajay Devgan, Saif Ali Khan and Viveik Oberoi, Kareena Kapoor, Konkona Sen Sharma and Bipasha Basu, not to forget Naseeruddin Shah, it is Bhardwaj?s understanding of the Bard?s work that makes Omkara so special.

 His earlier Maqbool raises Omkara?s promise quotient. Punctuated with some of the most natural performances in recent times, Bhardwaj?s film was a definitive study of the Macbeth mindspace delightfully depicted against the backdrop of the Mumbai underworld.

 The music director-turned-director?s devotion to Shakespearean material does not date back too far. It was only during research work for Makdee that Bhardwaj was exposed to Shakespeare. ?When I first read them, I found the stories extremely humane and emotional,? he says. ?What also struck me was how they don?t belong to any era or any century. They have the potential to be adapted to any situation and any backdrop. And that is what inspired me to make Maqbool first and now Omkara.?

 Bhardwaj is not the first film-maker to have adapted and interpreted Shakespeare on more than one occasion. In fact, what?s striking with Shakespearean content the world over is that almost every director or actor who gets involved with one of his creations keeps going back to the Bard for more.

 Take Laurence Olivier. He started out as Orlando in the 1936 version of As You Like It before finally playing King Lear in 1984. He directed and acted in every big Shakespeare adaptation, from Henry V and Hamlet to Othello and Merchant of Venice. No wonder English playwright Charles Bennett said: ?He (Olivier) could speak Shakespeare?s lines as naturally as if he were actually thinking them.?

 Kenneth Branagh seems to have taken on the mantle from Olivier, directing and acting in several Shakespearean adaptations ? Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, Hamlet, Love?s Labour Lost and As You Like It.

 Other acting legends like Richard Burton and Al Pacino, of course, have done their bit of Shakespeare in big-screen versions of Hamlet and Merchant of Venice, apart from enacting Richard III and The Taming of the Shrew on stage.

 Orson Welles, better known as the Citizen Kane man, dabbled in the Bard bibliography making Othello and Macbeth. But it was Japanese master Akira Kurosawa who came up with the two most original adaptations of Shakespeare in Throne of Blood (Macbeth) and Ran (King Lear).

 While most makers have kept going back to Shakespeare for inspiration, some directors have chosen to venture just once into the Bard?s domain. Roman Polanski made a scary Macbeth in 1971. Charlton Heston directed Antony and Cleopatra in 1973. Even Jean Luc-Godard gave a new wave to King Lear in the late 1980s.

 Baz Luhrmann of course twisted Romeo and Juliet hard enough to make William Shakespeare?s Romeo + Juliet look and sound stunningly different.

 Back home, Bollywood has had its own shot of Shakespeare in love, not forgetting Gulzar?s comedy of errors in Angoor.

 If not in graphic detail, almost every second romance made in Mumbai is an offline adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. From Bobby and Ek Duje Ke Liye to Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Maine Pyar Kiya, warring families have always provided the backdrop for a budding ? and occasionally doomed ? romance.

 Even Andrew Lloyd Webber?s staggering tribute to Bollywood in Bombay Dreams had a strikingly similar story line to the Montague-Capulet saga. As Naseeruddin Shah, who has done Shakespeare on stage many times and has starred in both Maqbool and Omkara, says: ?The roots may look lost but every big story in the Hindi film industry is from Shakespeare.?

 Of course, there?s more to come. While Vidhu Vinod Chopra?s Eklavya is rumoured to be an Indian period interpretation of Hamlet, My Brother? Nikhil-maker Onir is actually adapting Hamlet for his next directorial venture. He plans to cast Hrithik Roshan in the title role. As Onir puts it, ?Shakespeare?s plays explore the human psyche and thus are not time-bound. You can take the basic story and reinterpret it to your requirements.?

 As you like it.

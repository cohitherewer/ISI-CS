Celeb chef flies high

Mouthful Of Sky

 Chef Sanjeev Kapoor 

Tandoori Prawns in a bed of Roasted Pepper Jam or 

Paneer in Green Makhani for the main course. A fusion dessert featuring Rasmalai 

and Black Forest or Malpoa with Mangoes and Fresh Berries

These are some of the delicacies you can savour in 

the sky if you are flying Singapore Airlines First Class. For, the carrier has 

introduced culinary celebrity Sanjeev Kapoor as the new member of its International 

Culinary Panel (ICP) of famous chefs featuring the likes of Gordon Ramsey of the 

UK and Murata of Japan.

The airline has also announced the launch of its new 

Indian in-flight cuisine Shahi Thali, a unique meal specially designed by Kapoor, 

showcasing the best of both northern and southern Indian cuisine. This Indian 

meal was made available to Singapore Airlines First Class customers from August 

1.

Its a great honour to be inducted into 

the august panel, which comprises nine of the worlds most celebrated chefs. 

I have been working on the Shahi Thali concept since April, and the formula has 

evolved based on an extensive study of customer preferences, Kapoor tells 

GoodLife from Mumbai.

The survey, conducted among frequent fliers on the 

India-Singapore sector covering various Indian cities, revealed that most passengers 

would settle for South Indian for breakfast and North Indian for the main meals.

The idea of the Shahi Thali is to replicate 

the home dining experience to the extent possible on board an aircraft, with ample 

choices to suit different palates, with a twist here and there to spice things 

up, Kapoor explains.

So, while the non-vegetarian section will serve two 

meat dishes, a prawn option, pickle, dal and a vegetable dish, vegetarians 

can enjoy two main courses, dal, dahi/raita and pickle. A 

little twist like using green tomatoes for Paneer Makhani can go a long way, 

he reveals. The crack chef is trying out some fusion twists for sweets in the 

sky as well.

The Shahi Thali might later be introduced in Business 

Class too, adds Kapoor, who is also working on possible upgrades once Singapore 

Airlines starts its Airbus 380 service, the worlds first airline to 

do so.

Now, Indian meal options are available to both Business 

and Economy class passengers. The Indian meal option comprises North Indian and 

South Indian fare on Singapore Airlines services, ex-India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dupe groups out in name of NGO

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 If a CRY agent comes calling:

 Ask for the photo ID card with the phone number 

on it

 Pay only through cheque or demand draft

 Make sure that you sign on three forms ? donor, 

agent, CRY

 Contact CRY at 511, Jodhpur Park (phone: 24148118) 

for clarifications

Case I: A smart young couple drops 

in at the Bose flat on Mayfair Road. They claim to be from the NGO Child Relief 

 amp; You (CRY) and ask the elderly couple for a donation of a few thousand rupees 

in cash. The Boses get alarmed at the pressurising and lack of proper identification. 

When challenged, the duo flees.

Case II: Two young men approach the Bhowanipore 

office of an NGO claiming to be CRY volunteers. They keep badgering the staff 

for an immediate donation but fail to show clear identification. The NGO staff 

ask them to leave the donation forms and come back later. They exit without doing 

so.

 From highrises in central Calcutta to NGOs involving foreigners functioning in south Calcutta, a gang of dupesters is on the prowl, trying to take advantage of those looking for ways to help the poor.

 ?A smartly-dressed young couple visited us a few days ago. They said they were from CRY and asked us to donate. They started by asking for Rs 3,600 but when I said I?m not in a position to pay that much, they came down to Rs 1,200,? recalled Mrs A. Bose, a resident of Mayfair Road and a retired teacher of a girl?s school.

 ?They also insisted on cash and added that receipts would arrive after a few days from their Delhi headquarters,? she added. When the couple kept insisting that she make the payments immediately, her husband came out and confronted them. ?And they just ran away,? said Mrs Bose.

In case of the Bhowanipore NGO, the demand from the 

?volunteers? started at Rs 6,000 and later came down to Rs 1,200. ? As identification, 

they showed a card with only ?student? written on it and no institution name. 

They said that was because they were student volunteers. They did not leave any 

contact numbers either,? said Trisha Sen Sarma of Environment Governed Integrated 

Organisation. The pressure from the duo was even more on a German guest of the 

NGO present there.

 The impostors seem to be taking advantage of CRY?s practice of outsourcing the donation collection process. ?We do not have the staff strength to collect donations ourselves so we have outsourced the process to an agency,? said a representative of CRY.

 ?But a list of volunteers is given to us from the agency every month. Every agent is given a photo ID card with a phone number which the donor can call and verify.? Cash donation is a strict no-no for CRY agents and only cheques or demand drafts are accepted, the representative added.

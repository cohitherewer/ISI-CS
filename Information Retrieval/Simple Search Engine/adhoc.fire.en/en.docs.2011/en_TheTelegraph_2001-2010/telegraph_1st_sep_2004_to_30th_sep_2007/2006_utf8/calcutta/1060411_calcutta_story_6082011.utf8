 When is Jhulan this year? Which season does Nabanna take place in? The questions are likely to leave most youngsters fumbling for answers. Neither are they acquainted with the rituals and festivals that are a part of their roots. In a bid to help GeneratioNext keep a date with our cultural heritage, Sanskar Bharati Paschimbanga is bringing out a calendar on the Bengali new year that focuses on traditional festivals, here and elsewhere in India.

 So Baisakh, for instance, is the month of Bizu in Tripura, Baikho Puja in Assam and Baisakhi in Punjab and Haryana, other than hailing the Bengali new year. ?The idea was mooted by our president Victor Banerjee while the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) is our biggest backer,? says regional chief of Sanskar Bharati, Bikas Bhattacharya. 

 The calendar, to be released by the Governor on Friday at Kala Mandir, is in its second year. ?At EZCC?s request, we have added captions in English this year to explain each of the festivals. They have helped us in the research as have culture affairs departments of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.?

 ?The calendar is a close fit with our task of showcasing India?s cultural diversity. It has tourism potential as well,? points out Ranajit Samaddar, deputy director of EZCC, adding that it will be distributed among its six counterparts across the country.

 The main visual on each page is an original illustration while four other festivals are introduced through photographs. ?We have featured 11 little-known artists,? says Bhattacharya. According to Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, the only big name who has lent a painting for Baisakh: ?In the city, we have lost touch with roots because of our tendency to borrow. That is why Bengali calendars have lost relevance here.?

 The calendar, with limited circulation, may not put everything right, but at least it is a start.

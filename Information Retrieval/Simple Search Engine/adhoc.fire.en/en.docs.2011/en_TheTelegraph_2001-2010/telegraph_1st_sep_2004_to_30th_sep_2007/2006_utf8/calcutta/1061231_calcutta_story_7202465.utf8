 What: Launch of Tea Lounge at The Peerless Inn and introduction of Filipino band Evolution at Ego.

 When: Thursday.

 Take a look: A quick business meet, catching up with a dear friend or just any tete-a-tete over a cup of tea or coffee beckons at the latest beverage destination in town.

 A part of The Peerless Inn lobby has been converted into the Tea Lounge, spread over 500 sq ft.

 The decor is simple and the colour code brown, pastels and ochre. The seating arrangement is all about cosy sofas and seaters. 

 The beverage corner boasts 25 tea varieties Kolkata Street Cha, Assam Tea, flavoured ones like Lemon, Apple, Banana and Cinnamon; for the health conscious, there is Herbal Tea. 

 If you like your tea iced, try varieties like Mango Ice Tea and Passion Fruit Ice Tea. Go the mocktail way with Tea Margarita. 

 The Coffee corner offers 12 choices freshly brewed, decaffeinated coffee, espresso, cappuccino, mocha and more.

 The lounge extends further with a pastry shop that houses an array of cookies, cakes, pastries, savouries and chocolates.

 Moving to music, Evolution is a three-member band Max, Angelene and Evol all set to entertain the crowd at Ego for the next three months. 

 The performances will be accompanied with choreographed dances. Rock, pop, soft numbers the Evolution repertoire promises it all.

 Voiceover: Though our target group is essentially the corporate crowd, guests waiting at the hotel will have something to keep them busy, too, says Nilanjan Kar, regional sales manager, The Peerless Inn.

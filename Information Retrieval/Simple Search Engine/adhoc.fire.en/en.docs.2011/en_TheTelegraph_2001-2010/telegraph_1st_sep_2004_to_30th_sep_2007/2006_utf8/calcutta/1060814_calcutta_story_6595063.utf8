 - Contamination 

 report shakes students

 NABAMITA MITRA

 While the governments both at the Centre and in the state are yet to act on the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) report on pesticide contamination in soft drinks, the GenX seems to have given its verdict.

 Students at Presidency College have been enforcing a ban on sale of soft drinks on the campus since Thursday.

 The sale was not hampered the first time when the contamination claims came in. But this time, some students have requested us to stop selling aerated drinks till the controversy is settled, confirmed Pramodda, who runs a canteen at Presidency College.

 The students union, however, has distanced itself from the ban. The request has been made by some students. The college union is not involved in it. Nor has it spoken to the authorities on the issue, said Sayantan Saha Roy, general secretary of the college students union.

 While the canteens at St Xaviers College are still selling soft drinks, the college authorities are waiting for orders from the government on the issue. 

 We have not received any notification from the state government in this regard. We will go by the state law, said principal Father P.C. Matthew.

 But the city schools have been quick to enforce cola ban on their premises.

 South Point High School was among the first to react to the reports of pesticides in soft drinks by imposing a ban a couple of weeks ago. La Martiniere for Girls and MP Birla Foundation followed suit.

 Aerated drinks are not healthy. But as the management has not issued a formal notification, the ban in our school is temporary, said Herbert George, principal, MP Birla Foundation.

 Assembly of God Church and MP Birla Foundation had banned the drinks a couple of years ago when the allegations of contamination first came to light. 

 But with the state government not taking any stance, they withdrew their ban.

 Many CBSE schools in the city banned soft drinks on their premises almost a year ago after an order from the Delhi headquarters of the board. Some of the schools that dont have canteens like Auxilium Convent Dum Dum have disallowed entry of aerated drinks in the premises.

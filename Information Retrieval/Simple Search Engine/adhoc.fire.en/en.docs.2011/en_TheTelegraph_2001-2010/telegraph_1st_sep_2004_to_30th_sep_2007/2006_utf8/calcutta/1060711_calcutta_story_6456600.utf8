 Saturday evening at Nazrul Mancha was party time ? the third birthday bash of the only teen Bengali magazine in eastern India, Unish Kuri, and of Unish Kuri Club, a group of the magazines young readers. 

 Though the rain played hide-and-seek all afternoon, it couldnt dampen the spirits for the evening ahead, and the crowd turnout was handsome. The trendy and the young turned up in their best party clothes, so what if a few pants were folded up to the knees and some feet were in floaters?

 Unish Kuri lovers had waded through puddles, heavy traffic and muddy lanes to be part of the evening, as Bangla bands Fossils and Cactus took the stage.

 Crowd count

 Outside Nazrul Mancha there was a large crowd waiting eagerly to catch their favourite bands on stage. The inside was packed with youngsters. 

 Many had dressed with music in mind. There were girls in black tees that read CACTUS in glittering pink, with a painted guitar splashed on, bold and bright. 

 The boys tried to make rockstar statements with bandanas, wristbands and hair in ponytails. The spirits were high. The crowd clapped, cheered and danced, hardly taking their seats for a moment. Each knew the band numbers at the tip of their fingers, singing and screaming requests all through. 

 New friends were made and cell numbers exchanged. For the Gen X Romeos and Juliets it was holding hands and stealing occasional glances in between the hip hop. For 21-year Soham Ghosh studying in Singapore, the event was a great value-add to his holiday back home. When in Calcutta I never forget to catch the latest edition of Unish Kuri. The Unish Kuri spirit was carried on to the event as well. I am a big Fossils fan but enjoyed Cactus as well. I wished they had played a bit more, he said.

 Music magic

 First it was Cactus on stage, amid claps and whistles. After wishing the magazine and the club Happy Birthday, they got on to what they are best at ? hardcore Bangla rock. Tracks like Buddha heshechhe had the youngsters breaking into impromptu jigs. Bands Ishan and Prithibi joined Cactus on stage for the song Aamra haari na. 

 Then there were some soft rock numbers ? Phirbe na and Aami sudhu cheyechhi tomaye. As the band rounded off their performance with Bhalo theko, the audience lit candles and swayed along. 

 I am an avid reader of the Unish Kuri magazine and I love its attitude. This is one of the best crowds we had, smiled lead vocalist Sidhu. The cake was cut as everybody crooned Happy Birthday. 

 Music returned full-time on stage with Fossils. It was time to groove to heavy metal and punk. The audiences enjoyed the jam on guitar in between tracks like Shono amra ki shobai and Tomaye bhalobashbo na bole. 

 Later in the evening it was crowd favourites like Etota poth periye and Na na bhabchhina.

 Quiz quotient

 There was even something to tease the brain. A quiz session was held in between the band performances. Bollywood, politics, soccer? questions were asked from all walks of life.

 Try this: What is Bipasha Basus character called in Corporate? What is the cover story of the June 12 Unish Kuri edition?

 A lucky draw gave away a host of prizes. Unish Kuri T-shirts were also distributed.

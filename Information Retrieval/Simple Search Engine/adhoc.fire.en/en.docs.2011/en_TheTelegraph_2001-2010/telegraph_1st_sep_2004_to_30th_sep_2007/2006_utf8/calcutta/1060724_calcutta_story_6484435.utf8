The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Criminal tag on 71 men in uniform 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 An assistant sub-inspector was suspended in May this year 

 for trying to extort money from the daughter of a former 

 IPS officer in the Burtola area while she was returning 

 from a party late at night

 In April 2004, three policemen were found to be involved 

 in a heroin racket in Barasat, on the northern fringes of 

 the city. A Calcutta Police constable was later arrested

 In May 2004, Md Younis Khan, a constable with the Special 

 Branch, allegedly raped a girl and fled. He was later arrested 

 from his residence in Dildarnagar, Bihar. 

 Well, it?s too early to conclude whether Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s police are people-friendly or not. The statistics available portray a picture of the force that can be anything but friendly.

 According to records, 71 policemen are being interrogated for their involvement in crimes like extortion and cheating and also more serious offences, like molestation and robbery.

 ?Over the past two years, we have received complaints against 71 cops and departmental proceedings are on against them. Twenty-three of them are under suspension,? an officer in the Enforcement Branch said.

 ?Complaints like these are nothing but a blot on the image of the entire force. And therefore, the need to take punitive action against such personnel becomes a priority,? the officer said.

 A total of 29 cases ? eight of extortion, seven pertaining to murder or attempt to murder and three cases of involvement in petty crimes ? were registered against policemen in the past year.

 ?We investigate the matter once a complaint is lodged against any cop. If he is proved guilty, he is either suspended or put under a ?secret list? (if the offence is serious and sensitive),? the officer added.

 ?A dossier of all the guilty policemen is prepared and reviewed every year,? disclosed deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee.

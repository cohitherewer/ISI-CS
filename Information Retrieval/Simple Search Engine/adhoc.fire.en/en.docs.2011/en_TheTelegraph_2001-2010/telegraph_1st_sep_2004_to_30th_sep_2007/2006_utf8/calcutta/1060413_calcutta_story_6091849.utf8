 Getaway shot left boy dead on train

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The probe into the death of a 12-year-old boy in a Diamond Harbour-Sealdah local train on March 24 has revealed that the shot which killed him was fired to scare the passengers. 

 Officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have concluded that the alleged murderer fired his gun to ensure a smooth getaway for himself and his three accomplices. The bullet grazed the shoulder of a passenger before lodging itself in Class VI student Somnath Majumdar?s head.

 The development follows the arrest of two persons at Baruipur on Tuesday. Manzar Khan, alias Bhikari, and Sheikh Motaleb were held on the basis of the tip-offs provided by Azim Sheikh, mastermind of the operation on the train. Azim was arrested earlier.

 Manzar drove the red Tata Sumo hired by Azim and three others to reach Kalyanpur station from Baruipur on the afternoon of March 24. 

 ?Barely a fortnight earlier, Azim had been released on bail. He was looking for ways to earn easy money. He learnt that his uncle, Mohammad Golam, a dealer in cows, would be sending Rs 96,000 to a creditor through a person named Ashraff Gazi and he would be travelling on the local train on March 24,? said deputy inspector-general, CID (operations), Rajeev Kumar.

 ?Azim worked out a plan of robbing Ashraff. He killed the boy in the attempt to execute the plan,? Kumar added.

 Interrogation has revealed that Somnath was sitting beside his mother Snigdha. On his other side, next to the window, was a person named Haran Mondal. 

 Within seconds of the train stopping at Kalyanpur station, three men ran past Snigdha?s seat, down the aisle. Another man was running behind them.

 ?I remember telling Somnath that they were probably running away from a travelling ticket examiner. Seconds later, the fourth man had whipped out a revolver. Before I could make out what he was trying to do with the weapon, there was a flash, followed by a loud sound. I turned towards Somnath to say, ?Let?s leave.? His face was covered in blood,? recounted Snigdha.

 The bullet had grazed Mondal?s left shoulder, and he, too, was bleeding.

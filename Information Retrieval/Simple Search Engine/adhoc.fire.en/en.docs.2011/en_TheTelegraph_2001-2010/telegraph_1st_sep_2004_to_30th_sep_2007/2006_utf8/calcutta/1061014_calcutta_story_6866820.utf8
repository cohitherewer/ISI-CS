 The name could be Bond, Jane Bond or may be, Bose, Jhumpa Bose. For, the new breed of she sleuths is hundred per cent homebred.

 Detective offices in town are recording a spurt in young women turning up to be undercover agents. Fresh out of college, they are raring to draw up gameplans, scan profiles and do a Nancy Drew. 

 What was considered a mans domain till yesterday, is now attracting more and more women. We receive e-mails and postal applications every day from aspirants, most of whom are just out of college or still pursuing higher education, says Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, CEO, OSDA Security Group, where 45 per cent of the sleuths today are women.

 So, what is driving city girls to be Natalie, Dylan or Alex? Books and movies mainly, reveal the local Charlies Angels. While some fictional female detectives are stuff of legends, many films and television serials nowadays have women playing detectives or cops.

 I would read a lot of thrillers during my school days and dream of solving mysteries. After completing my graduation, I joined an agency as a trainee detective, reveals Preeti Das, currently with Globe Detective Agency. 

 And what do you need to be a girl sleuth? Common sense and the ability to take instant decisions... The advantage girls have over boys is that they do not arouse suspicion, adds Preeti.

 Its clearly a win-win for girls wanting to have some fun in the serious business of sleuthing and detective agencies desperate to use moles.

 It is very easy to plant girls, says T.K. Das of Globe Detective Agency. They are more acceptable in any circle and can easily mingle in a group, from where they can pick up good leads. They are particularly effective in an office or a disc. Plus, they are far more likely to pick up gossip than their male counterparts.

 The nature of cases coming to a detective agencys door is also driving the need for a bigger girl gang. 

 With a boom in the BPO sector and the mushrooming of nightclubs, more and more parents approach private detectives to keep an eye on their children. For this, agencies often depute women from their ranks.

 And there are the growing cases of pre-nuptial checks and post-marital suspicion. Such cases have to be handled with a lot of patience, for which female detectives are well-suited, feels Vinita Berry, trainee detective at OSDA Security Group.

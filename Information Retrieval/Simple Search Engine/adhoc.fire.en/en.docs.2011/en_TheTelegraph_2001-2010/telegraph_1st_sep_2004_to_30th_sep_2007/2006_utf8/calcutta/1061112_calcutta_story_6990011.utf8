The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Balance of a busybody

 TITHI SARKAR

 Fashion is too much of a strong 

 passion to live without it, says Rohit Bal (in picture 

 above by Rashbehari Das). I just --v-e designing.

 In town for a charity event at the Hyatt Regency Calcutta, the designer from Delhi points out that it is the first time he has come down for such an occasion. Designers need to retain some exclusivity. Thats exactly why I dont take part in every other show across the world, he maintains. 

 But Rohit will be back in Calcutta for Stylefile early next month. And there are more Calcutta plans in the months to come.

 Yes, I have plans to enter the Calcutta market and my own store makes more sense. Though I havent started scouting for space, I plan to come here by March-April, reveals Rohit.

 Even if that doesnt go as planned, Calcutta can surely expect to see more of his label, Balance, at 85 Lansdowne.

 Rohit labels the Calcutta buyer more sedate but with good taste, and his clothes a bit too expensive for the city.

 People like Sabyasachi (Mukherjee) and Shantanu (Goenka) can sell their creations at these prices because workmanship and other charges are definitely much lower than in Delhi or Mumbai. If I had my factory in Calcutta, my prices would have been lesser. So if people can get that much more at the same price, why me? he asks, in a matter-of-fact manner.

 Work has kept Rohit busy for the past year and it is quite a revelation when he says, No parties for me!

 He has just launched two stores in Delhi and one in Saks Fifth Avenue. Thats really a big store and its bang opposite D amp;G and Prada with Issey Miyake beside it. 

 At the India Fashion Week Fall-Winter 2006 in April, Rohits label attracted many international buyers and volumes jumped manifold. There have been back-to-back shows in Dubai, Mumbai, Bangalore and, of course, Delhi.

 Another interesting assignment that Rohit is upbeat about is Madhur Bhandarkars next film, Fashion, for which he has been roped in as the design consultant.

 Is Bollywood beckoning, big time? I want to do films that will have some research and authenticity; a costume-based drama perhaps, he says. While he would like to do Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Bajirao Mastani, he has already refused Bhansalis Saawariya and Sajid Khans Hey Baby.

 The budget didnt suit Sajid; Sanjay has already told me that Bajirao will have no such problem with budgets. Besides, actors have to believe in me; they cant say Ill wear this and not wear that, he adds.

 While on actors, talk turns towards beauties from Bengal. There are so many Bipasha, Koena. I think Riya Sen is one of the most beautiful girls, but sorry, she cant act, he laughs.

 I think Indian women are quite well-endowed and curvaceous. Besides, you can advise people but cant ban any human attribute, he says of the skinny model controversy.

 When it comes to models, Rohit picks his favourites: After Arjun (Rampal), I think Kamal Gill is the most incredible man on ramp. Arjun will always be my favourite; Muzammil is also very good. Among the girls, Carol Gracias (and not because of her wardrobe malfunction), Sapna Kumar, Nina Manuel and, of course, Mehr Jessia.

 On balancing creativity and commerce, Rohit is clear: I dont like factories, money and the business side of fashion. I have great people to look after all that, but at the back of my mind I know that I have to earn to sustain the business... A few years down the line, I want to buy a villa in Goa and only design.

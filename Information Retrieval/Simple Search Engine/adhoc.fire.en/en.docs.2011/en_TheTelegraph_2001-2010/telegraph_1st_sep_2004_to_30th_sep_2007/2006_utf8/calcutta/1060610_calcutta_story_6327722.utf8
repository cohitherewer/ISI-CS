 India as a business destination has become increasingly attractive over the past few years. Keeping this in mind, Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), in association with DeSales University, recently organised a daylong video conference at the American Centre on ?Doing Business in India?. 

 Inaugurated by US consul-general Henry V. Jardine, the seminar aimed at projecting India as a business destination. Alok Mookherjea, president, Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, opened the discussion with a talk on India and the global economy. ?Today is India?s moment. The country is fast emerging as the knowledge centre of the world. There has been a paradigm shift in the perception of India?s role in today?s global economy and we have to use to it to our advantage,? he said. 

 The seminar, described as the ?first management development programme through video conferencing?, explored the viability of doing business in India through joint ventures, foreign direct investment and memorandum of understanding. 

 Subrato Roy, company secretary, MSTC, dealt with the legal aspects to facilitate the setting up of operations by multinationals. The capacity of the country?s legal framework to support and meet the demands of international trade came under scrutiny. 

 The discussion on the energy situation in India aroused interest. The use of renewable energy and energy generated from waste, the government?s plans to provide power to rural India and investment opportunities in the sector were debated.

 ?There are plans for a national grid and since the calorific value of solid waste in India is low, its conversion is not as useful. We also plan to retire some of the low power producing units and upgrade and increase production by 2010,? explained Asim Barman, chairman, Damodar Valley Corporation.

 While IT has been a major economic growth driver in recent times, infrastructure investments by state governments have helped propel the sector as a major export revenue earner. Principal secretary of IT G.D. Gautama added: ?The Bengal government has declared IT a public utility service, enabling it to run on a 24x7 basis. In today?s wireless economy, governments have to take decisions that ensure services are not interrupted. Policies have to be structured accordingly. Public policy and corporate policies have to merge seamlessly for the best results.?

 Gautama felt that factors like low attrition rates, a strong education system and low labour costs have made India an attractive proposition for global corporations. Faculty members of DeSales University and representatives of corporate America attended the seminar that carried on late into the night. The consensus ? technology had to be the major resource in bringing business to India and public policy had to be structured accordingly.

 HR horizons

 Six MBA students from Eastern Institute of Management (EIM), Calcutta, headed for the Salaam Managers HR Meet at IIT, Kharagpur. Sunando Chakraborty writes in...

 ROADMAP

 The EIM team ? consisting of Sujoy Ghosal, Anirban Saha, Anirban Chakraborty, Amit Agarwal and I ? took the train to Kharagpur, excited at the prospect of attending our first major national conference. At Kharagpur station we were received by an HR researcher who escorted us to the IIT campus. 

 PERFECT PLATFORM

 Salaam Managers, we discovered, has emerged as one of the leading events for human resource personnel in the country. What I found interesting was that it not only aimed at presenting a holistic view of the status and future of HRD in India, but also provided a platform for interaction between students and corporate houses. 

 The inauguration of the three-day programme began with a Sanskrit chant, followed by speeches. The preliminary round of the Best Manager competition had managers walking the ramp, which attempted to usher in a trend that future generations would believe more in corporate celebrities than media and celluloid stars. 

 SMART TALKING

 ?So long as we live among men, let us cherish humanity,? Andre Gide had said. Salaam Managers underscored this sentiment and highlighted the varied dimensions of ?people skills?? through JAM, panel discussion, seminar and innovative thinking. 

 AD Gyapan tested the on-the-spot advertising creativity of the participants. The preliminary round called for the submission of an ad film campaign of up to 30 minutes. The EIM team created a storyboard for a toothpaste, which won kudos from the jury. 

 LESSONS LEARNT

 We were in seventh heaven when EIM was declared runners-up in the prelims. EIM?s Anirban Saha also made it to the final round of JAM, which constituted coming up with ideas on three topics in three minutes. Although we didn?t emerge winners, it was a great experience and we learnt valuable lessons on teamwork and team play. 

 THE END

 The event taught us a lot, including the importance of knowledge, confidence and group commitment. Theory intertwined with a practical approach extended our horizons.

 TU war shadow on death

 - Jharkhand police to probe suicide in hotel room

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A police team from Jharkhand is scheduled to arrive in the city to probe the death of Hari Om Jha, who was found hanging in a central Calcutta hotel on Sunday afternoon.

 Jha, 38, a prominent trade union leader, was private secretary to Madhu Koda when he was a minister in 2000. He continued to enjoy a cordial relationship with the Jharkhand chief minister.

 Jha was wanted in connection with an attempt to kill rival trade union leader Rama Pandey in July.

 His body was discovered after police broke into the hotel room on Sunday.

 Jha had been named for trying to shoot Rama Pandey. Trade union rivalry could be the motive, Naveen Kumar Singh, superintendent of police, East Singhbhum (Jhas home district), told Metro on Monday.

 If he committed suicide, it could be because he had lost all hope. He was very ambitious, plotting unchallenged supremacy for himself in the trade union movement and the transport sector, he added.

 The Jharkhand cops will arrive soon and take stock of the situation, said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (central). They are aware of the mans background and are better equipped than us to probe his stay and activities in the city. We will cooperate with them.

 Jha checked into the hotel after arriving here on October 4, apparently to meet some business associates. He was chairman of Ashirwad Enterprise, a transport company in Gua, Chaibasa.

 Police said Jha would step out of the hotel every morning and return late. But he was not seen after his return to the hotel on Saturday night.

 On Sunday, after repeated knocking on his door by the hotel staff failed to elicit a response, the authorities informed police.

 We have found a diary in which Jha had penned his thoughts about how he wanted to step out of the trap he had apparently walked into and that he saw no future for himself in the transport business. He also wrote that he had been suffering from depression ever since an astrologer predicted doom for him in the business, said a senior police officer.

 A trade union leader of Gua for decades and president of a Mazdoor Sangh, Jha was once close to Pandey, president of Gua Chiria Supply Mazdoor Sangh. 

 But the two fell out a few years ago and their relationship steadily worsened.

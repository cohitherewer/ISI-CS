 Techies talk security with police top brass

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Representatives of information technology (IT) companies in Sector V met the police top brass on Monday evening to discuss security measures in the tech township. 

 The meeting was held in the Webel office in Sector V.

 It was a routine meeting that we hold once every two months. The occupants of Sector V and police take part in the interaction. We inform the companies about the meeting by writing to them. The companies that want to participate send their representatives and discuss the problems they are facing with the cops, said an official of Webel.

 Mondays meeting was attended by executives of more than 40 companies that have offices in Sector V.

 Police superintendent of North 24-Parganas Praveen Kumar said: At todays meeting, we informed the industry people about the work that we have done since we last met. We distributed some forms to collate information about the antecedents of the drivers and security personnel working in the IT companies. We have also decided to put up traffic signals at spots like Bowlers Den, Technopolis and College More.

 The cops also gave out their email IDs to the company representatives to facilitate communication.

 Another form that was distributed by police can be used to report misbehaviour by drivers and workers of buses, taxis and autorickshaws.

 If the industry has to grow, security must be in place so that we can attract more investment. The advantages of these meetings are that we come to know what police are doing or at least what they are planning for the township. The steps they are taking seem to be quite assuring, said Piyush Goenka, who represented Infinity at the meeting.

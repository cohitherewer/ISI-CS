 Alls fair in war game

 Its a spoof on typical thrillers complete with gun wielding men in black, rival dons, conspiracy, murder, vamps, music, dance, the conscientious but quickly suppressed policeman... Bratya Basus play introduces viewers to the less familiar face of our city, the world of Page 4, where everything is a game for power. Where the celeb dinners, cultural dos, awards, even the annual Puja sharodias are part of a war. The individual is no longer safe, his expressions artistic or otherwise are under constant censor and threat. In the backlanes the silence is repeatedly broken by flashes of AK 47s, grenades and knives as dons Giridharilal Gurguria and Mohandas Dibakar Haptulla clash for total control. But just how safe are the dons and their companies? Are they really in control of all the strings or is there someone else manipulating them? Who caused the explosion in Giridharilals godown? Who initiated the police raids? Just what is or isnt fair in this game?

 Event: Play in Bengali, Page 4 Its Also a Game, produced by Lok-Krishti 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Girish Mancha

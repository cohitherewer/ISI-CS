Tulip in full bloom

Screen On amp; Off

 Tulip Joshi, who debuted in Mere 

 Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai and followed it up with the smashing 

 Matrubhumi, will be making a comeback in Arindam 

 Mitras Shunya opposite Nasseruddin Shah. And then 

 she will be seen in a glamorous role in Hostel directed 

 by Manish Gupta, the writer of Sarkar.

 But the icing on the cake is the multiple film deal Tulip has signed with Sanjay Guptas White Feather Films. She will first be seen in one of the stories in Dus Kahaniyan.That will be followed by another big project early next year.

 Says Tulip: I have an unusual face, being of mixed origin (her father is Gujarati, mother a Lebanese-Armenian). So, I can carry both an Indian and a non-Indian look. I want to cash in on this.

 But working in Sanjays film does not mean that Tulip will indulge in skin show like the Sameeras and Koenas. I dont believe in nudity. But if the character is important, I would try and figure it out. Hmmm!

 INOX has a treat in store for its little patrons on Childrens Day. The Elgin Road plex at Forum will host an exhibition-cum-sale of paintings by children, in association with Sahay, an affiliated agency of Children International which helps children in areas of health, education, nutrition, family assistance and value formation. 

 INOX and Sahay will join hands again on the same day at the plex property in City Centre by staging a folk dance and drama to be enacted by the children from Sahay. In addition, CRY will set up a stall at both the plexes selling articles prepared by children.

 Moreover, children visiting INOX that day will have the opportunity to win movie tickets to special shows. There will also be a special screening at 7.45 pm of Shadows of Time (presented by ABP, Kaleidoscope Entertainment and Apne Aap Women Worldwide) in an effort to highlight global issues such as child trafficking, child abuse and child labour.

 Syd Field, the numero uno script guru in Hollywood, is coming to India. UTV will exclusively bring Syd to the country to host screenplay writing seminars and workshops in Mumbai in January 2007.

 Field is regarded by many Hollywood professionals as the leading authority in the art and craft of screenwriting today. He is responsible for pioneering some of the rules of storytelling and screenplay writing such as the classic 3-Act Structure. 

 The Indian film industry is on a par, if not better, in the technical and visual aspect of film-making. But scriptwriting in India has not progressed in the same direction, says Ronnie Screwvala, CEO of UTV. We have to tell engrossing stories, which captures peoples imagination.

 During his India trip, Field will undertake a 10-day workshop and a two-day seminar with emphasis on updating classic storytelling conventions using contemporary tools of the craft.

 A traditional number plate: On way out

 After running into rough weather for over a year, introduction of High Security Registration Plates (HSRP) for vehicles is set to sail through.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had asked transport department officials earlier this week to complete the formalities soon, including selection of suppliers.

 Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) had invited tenders to supply the HSRP. Eight companies had submitted bids ? Shimnit Utsch, Hind Industries Ltd, Sun Bio-tech Ltd, Cellex, Arch promoters, Paceman Marketing, Utsav Security Systems Ltd and Subba Microsystem. 

 TIDC could not award the contract following a petition filed by Shimnit Utsch in the high court challenging the tender process. Last week, the court ruled that the process was in order.

 Work to introduce the number plates has started in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Goa, Sikkim and Mizoram 

 According to officials at Writers? Buildings, despite the court case there was no bar on opening the bids. The chief minister, however, had asked the transport department to keep the matter pending.

 ?We have to introduce HSRP as it is the directive of the Supreme Court. We ran into several problems, but they have been cleared. We will introduce the new number plates soon,?? chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Friday.

 TIDC officials said it would take around two months to complete the preliminary work, including the tendering process. The launch target is January 2007. 

 ?It is not easy to make and fix number plates on 35 lakh vehicles in the state,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said.

 According to the system, two number plates fitted with computer chips will be fixed to the front and rear of vehicles. The aluminium plates will have the registration number embossed and laser printed. A hologram will be fixed on the windscreen of the vehicles. The approximate cost of all three will be Rs 400.

 The Centre has fixed the specification of the number plates and hologram including shape, size and thickness.

 Movement of any vehicle can be traced through computers to be placed at the police control room and public vehicles department. Officials claimed that the hologram and the number plate cannot be tampered with or replaced.

 A committee comprising experts in automobiles and computers will oversee the work. The company that will get the contract will have to obtain a clearance from Automotive Research Association of India or Central Road Research Institute or Vehicles Research and Development Agency.

 The Centre has asked the state governments to ensure that the owner and employees of the company awarded the contract for supplying the HSRP do not have any criminal background.

 Rathin Chatterjee,

 The crowds were thinner this Puja due to rain caused by depression. The Met office had warned of isolated to heavy rain during the Puja. The alert cast a shadow on the festive spirit. 

 A.F.K. Ahmed, 

 Bandpur, Hooghly

 No. The crowds thronged to 

 the pandals braving inclement weather and waterlogged roads. 

 There was no dearth of enthusiasm among the people. However, 

 the heavy rain made some pandals virtually inaccessible. 

 The thin attendance at those pandals did not indicate lack 

 of interest in Puja. 

 Sarbani Sarkar, 

 Howrah

 Durga puja is the biggest festival of the region, so it will always be well attended. Some people leave the city during the Puja taking advantage of the vacation in schools and colleges. Heavy rains and waterlogging prevented some others from venturing out. Most people, however, pandal-hopped early in the morning and late at night.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake 

 The crowds were thinner this Puja due to rain. Many people from the districts could not make it to the city due to the downpour. Even the city residents were trapped indoors as a result of waterlogging.

 Rima Chatterjee, 

 Dum Dum

 Crowds were thinner this Puja because of television. With channels beaming pujas round-the-clock not only from the city pandals, but also from those in Delhi, Mumbai and even Europe, people preferred to stay home.

 Suchanda Sen,

 Address not given

 The crowds were thinner this puja because of the whims of the rain god. The puja organisers did not do their bit to make things easy for the pandal-hoppers. I had to wade through dirty water to view the goddess at one pandal. At another pandal, I had to negotiate a perilous muddy stretch near the entrance. Many also fell sick during the festive days. 

 D. Mukherjee,

 Behala

 The crowds were thinner this Puja. There was rain during the festive days, followed by waterlogging. The floods in neighbouring districts brought down the number of visitors. The threat of terrorist attack kept away some pandal-hoppers. The poor condition of the city roads played its part as well.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake 

 People only stayed away from the simple pujas. Unique theme and decoration are the only way to attract people to pandals these days. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 There was a crowd crush at all the Durga pujas in my locality. The flow of pandal-hoppers continued right through the night and even at dawn. The rain did not dampen the spirits. Many people from the suburbs, too, visited the pandals. In fact, the volunteers found it quite difficult to control the crowd.

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 The mere mention of Durga puja generates excitement among people. Everyone, irrespective of age and religion, enjoys the festival. The question of crowds becoming thinner during Puja does not arise.

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 There were a few spells of rain during the Puja this year. The weather forced many to skip pandal-hopping. There was also a rumour that there will be a terrorist strike in Calcutta during the festival, scaring away people.

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

 No Bengali can resist taking part in Durga puja. So, this year too innumerable people visited the pandals in the city and its adjacent areas. They not only braved torrential rain, but also the threat of terrorist attacks.

 P.B. Saha,

 Salt Lake

 The Puja crowds were not thinner. At least it did not appear so to me. Despite the devastating floods in the district, people flocked to the city in huge numbers. The threat of rain did not deter them. The comparatively pleasant weather during Puja kept everyone in good humour.

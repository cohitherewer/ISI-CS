The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 TV tie-up debut in August

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 The direct-to-home (DTH) television market is about to get more competitive, with the entry of Tata Sky, an 80:20 joint venture between the $17.6-billion Tata group and Rupert Murdoch?s Star Network.

 The company has planned to roll out its DTH service by August. It wants to ?revolutionise the Indian digital entertainment scenario through a wide array of programming and interactive features?.

 Although bullish on Bengal, Tata Sky personnel are tight-lipped about whether they will tie up with local pay channels. However, they stressed that they are quite positive about the market scenario in the state, which has a cable subscriber base of almost four million.

 ?The pay television market is under-served by the limitations of the current analogue cable systems. New technologies like DTH are expected to change this. We expect to grow rapidly,? said Vikram Kaushik, managing director, Tata Sky.

 The newest entrant on the DTH platform has received the necessary approvals from the government and plans a rapid roll-out of its operations leveraging the Star brand. 

 ?Managing the individual needs of millions of subscribers requires a lot of expertise, high-end technology and large investments. Very few companies in the world can claim to have this expertise. The biggest of them is Newscorp, with its DTH services across the UK, the US, Australia, Italy, Brazil, New Zealand and Chile. All of which are successful operations, with millions of customers and growing,? pointed out Kaushik.

 In order to make subscription payments easier, Tata Sky will introduce prepaid cards. The hardware will also be available in consumer electronic stores. The company will bear the responsibility of installing the hardware at the subscribers? homes.

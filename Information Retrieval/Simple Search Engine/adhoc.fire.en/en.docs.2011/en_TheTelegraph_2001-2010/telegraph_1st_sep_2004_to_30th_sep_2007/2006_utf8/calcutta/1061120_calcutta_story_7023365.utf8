 Stardom after fatal soiree

 - Hatkata Dilip shooting at show turns performers fortunes

 PRONAB MONDAL AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A drunken brawl that led to two persons being shot at her show changed her fortune. Two years ago, she used to earn Rs 8,000 for a three-hour song-and-dance routine. She now commands between Rs 40,000 and Rs 1 lakh for a show.

 Meet Suparna Adhikary, better known as Laila. It was at her show in Salt Lake in June 2004 that Hatkata Dilip and his associates killed two men.

 Dilip and three of his associates were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime. Laila, too, was arrested before being acquitted.

 The shooting was the performers ticket to popularity. Clubs and other organisations, including educational institutions, are making a beeline to her house for dates.

 My schedule for December is packed. Organisers are seeking appointments to book me for programmes, says Laila. I am even receiving invitations from Tripura and Orissa. But I have not decided about going. If I go, my 62-year-old father will have to stay alone at our Ultadanga residence.

 The 26-year-old began singing at a young age: In 1990, I had taken part in the competition for the RD Burman Award. I won the prize among 1,000 participants. Since then, I have been regularly doing riwaz at home, she recalls.

 I started singing professionally in 1997 after my fathers business in Assam ran into financial trouble. I would sing at small local soirees. Most of them used to be organised by neighbourhood clubs, Laila adds. 

 Last month, the singer performed at a Barasat college. She was paid Rs 10,000 for the performance. It was a morning show. Thats why she took less than her normal fee. Had it been a night programme, the amount would have been far higher, explains a member of her troupe.

 Uttam Chakraborty of Barasats Balak Sangha, which recently organised a soiree starring Laila, says the presence of a controversial artiste pulled in the crowds and helped the club collect subscriptions. We have a plan to organise another function in December at which Laila is expected to perform.

 According to North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar, there is no restriction on Laila performing. She has been acquitted of the charges. How she will earn her bread and butter depends on her, he says.

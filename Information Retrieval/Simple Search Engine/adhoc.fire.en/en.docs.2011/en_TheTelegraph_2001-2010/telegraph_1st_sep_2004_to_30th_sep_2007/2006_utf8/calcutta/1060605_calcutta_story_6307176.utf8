 Traditional impressions

 A return to conventional themes and techniques marks the works of some of the most promising artists of the present generation. Besides an instinctive urge to express personal emotions, their paintings are also reminiscent of a style that was prevalent in an era prior to that of post-modern impressionistic art. The ongoing exhibition of recent works by Inner Space, a group of young painters, bears testimony to this trend. Landscapes, portrait-studies and images of flora and fauna abound in their works. Traditional motifs and symbols are used not only to heighten the impact of the paintings; in fact, they are integral and organic to them. Kajori Ghosal?s paintings are in the style of Rajasthani miniatures and have a quaint, old-world quality. Kumar Singha (Naree; picture above) depicts women in their many moods, aspects and dimensions. Also featuring the works of Avijit Soren, Ranjit Roy and Raju Sarkar.

 Freedom festival

 Forum Theatre as a performing genre has treaded a long and arduous journey since its inception in Brazil three decades ago. Introduced in India by Jana Sanskriti, its performances in the rural heartland have generated consciousness on a wide range of issues like displacement, communalism, exploitation of labour and domestic violence, among the unlettered masses. Its success in this regard was clearly borne out when more than 10,000 people from rural areas came to Calcutta of their own accord to take part in a Jana Sanskriti rally on October 22. Celebrating the empowerment and emancipation of the oppressed classes, which is given expression in this form of theatre, Jana Sanskriti hosts Muktadhara II: An International Forum Theatre Festival, a four-day event comprising seminars, forum theatre performances (with participating teams from Austria, Brazil, Pakistan, Palestine and several Indian states including West Bengal), folk music and dance. Inauguration today at 2.30 pm.

 What: 

 Peter England Fashion Show.

 Where: Grain of Salt Terrace.

 When: Tuesday evening. 

 Ramp watch: A last-minute venue change coupled with some technical issues pushed the show one-and-a-half hours behind schedule, but the brisk choreography of the show, when it finally did begin, made up for lost time.

 The evening that began with a dance troupe moving to flavour-of-the-season Himesh Reshammiyas Jhalak dikhla ja and Aashiq banaya, went on to showcase Peter Englands latest collection.

 The first sequence, The Festive Collection, saw Shahwar Ali opening the show in a black suit. What followed was a formal range of suits ? textured, pinstripes and solids ? combined with formal shirts and some cool, contrasting ties. Light-hued suits for summer were also seen.

 The Festive Collection showcased a new range of formal shirts in a wide palette, ranging from blues to rusts to lilacs.

 The second sequence titled the Party Collection showcased casual shirts. Cool checks in lime, sea blue, orange and red, these were teamed effectively with white linen drawstrings, denims or brick-red pants.

 The third sequence showcased Casual Wear by Elements, a Peter England sub-brand. The highlight of this line was a range of T-shirts in stripes, solids and graffiti. The next round, T-shirts by Peter England, was bright and colourful.

 The final sequence was titled Party Wear by Elements. This line saw some funky prints, both psychedelic and retro. A splash of self-prints in floral and neat cargo pants was on display.

 The glamour quotient was upped by models Anchal Kumar and Candice Pinto, who breezed through two sequences, once in saris for the Festive Collection and once in denims during the Casual Wear round.

 Voiceover: Our theme More is Less perfectly suits the ideology of the current generation that dares to dream big. Peter Englands new collection is designed specially to appeal to this generation, our younger consumer segment... East India contributes to 22 per cent of our total sales and Calcutta being the gateway to the east is a critical market, said R. Sathyajit, brand head of Peter England.

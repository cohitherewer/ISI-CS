What: Fashion: A Way Of Independence Or Commodisation 

Of Women, a panel discussion.

 Where: The FI outlet at City Centre.

 When: August 22.

 Listen in: Speakers included music director Debajyoti Mishra, danseuse Alokananda Ray, Delhi Public School (Ruby Park) principal Indrani Sanyal, actress Rimjhim Mitra, FI executive director Jyoti Nawalgaria, FI head designer Asha Avadhani and model Tina.

 She is an independent woman. Independent in the ways of fashion. But has this freedom commercialised her femininity, her womanhood? 

 The discussion kicked off with Indrani putting forward her views: Fashion today has reached the streets. I personally prefer style to fashion and also feel that fashion is not only commodisation of women, but men as well.

 Agreed Debajyoti: No field is divorced from marketing. Marketing today does not spare anything or anyone.

 Then came a feminist twist to the tete-a-tete. Alokananda and Indrani pointed out how a woman cannot be judged by the clothes she wears. If a woman has the right to vote, she has the independence to choose her clothes too. Woman today are conscious like never before and they definitely know where to draw the line, pointed out Indrani.

 Why are women always targeted? Arent men and children also used to promote products, asked Alokananda. Her fashion tips: It is important to remind yourself that fashion is not to create shock value, but to look aesthetic and charming, within certain parameters of society.

 Tina carried the point forward with ramp talk: A model might be sashaying a pretty sari with an itsy-bitsy choli and a feather on her head, to add an element of drama. The buyer has the freedom to choose the sari and get a choli done according to her liking.

 Actress Rimjhim raised the pitch further as she pointed out: There is nothing wrong in fashion. I have no qualms in accepting that I always feel confident when well dressed. And everything that is revealing is not fashion; arent spectacles a fashion fad?

 The discussion ended on a lighter note with Tina playing the word game. The commodity tag is not that bad after all; I checked the meaning of commodity in the dictionary, and it means something that is useful!

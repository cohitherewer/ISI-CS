A wardrobe must-have of the moment, theres 

no way you can ignore the dress. Designer Sayon Mitra tells you how to make the 

most of the trend 

 Tupur Chatterjee, Bhavna Sharma, Nina Manuel 

flaunt dresses of various kinds 

The fashion week reviews tell you it is the 

must-have for the coming seasons. You have been bombarded by a plethora of new 

terms trapeze, balloon, shirt, pleated, sack, shift, empire, baby doll, pinafore, 

maxi, tent Yes, the dress isnt a simple slip-on any more.

On the one hand, you cant turn a blind eye to 

the dress diktat. On the other, youre just not sure which dress will show 

what you want to and hide what you need to.

GoodLife gets designer Sayon Mitra to prescribe 

the dress dos for some common body types. The perfect dress to flaunt on not-so-perfect 

bodies. 

1. Perfect 8

Neckline: Everything from closed Chinese collars 

to a boat neck, from a Mandira noodle strap to a cutaway halter, from a structured 

bandhgala to a curvaceous corset.

Fabric fact: Silk, wool blends, georgette, 

chiffon and crepe.

Colours and prints: Anything and everything 

will look great on a size 8. Try light colours or bold prints, maybe even a combination 

of prints.

Cutting edge: Empire lines or bias cuts. Well-tailored 

and structured styles will look good.

Style right: A string of beads, jewelled, pointed 

heels, big belts, everything strategically placed.

2. Top-heavy

Neckline: Wider necklines complement a bigger 

bust line. Choose from a plunging V, a wide U or a sweetheart. The less amount 

of fabric around the neck, the better.

Fabric facts: Choose fluid fabrics. Combine 

two fabrics to make a structured bottom with flowy upper.

Colours and prints: The idea is to take attention 

away from the upper body. A tone-on-tone print or embroidery will look nice. Stay 

away from very bright colours to tone down your body, visually.

Cutting edge: A semi-tailored look. Stay away 

from a very contoured silhouette, but make sure it isnt very tent-like either. 

Avoid too much volume.

Style right: Large earrings but less fuss around 

the neck; stick only to a delicate drop pendant. A clutch bag instead of a big 

one, resting on the body.

3. Pear-shaped

Neckline: A cowl or a scooped neck. Focus on 

an attractive neckline to draw attention away from the problem area, the hips.

Fabric facts: Stiffer fabric for a structured 

top, fitted till the hips and then flowy like a georgette or crepe to draw attention 

away from the hips.

Colours and prints: Stay away from prints. 

Choose from darker colours and if nothing works, go with the style Bible: When 

in doubt, wear black.

Cutting edge: A-line. It has to be fitted at 

the top and flaring towards the bottom.

Style right: Create a focal point in the upper 

body by wearing pretty neckpieces. Opt for open, sleek sandals.

4. Size 14

Neckline: A boat-neck or simpler, cleaner lines 

because a balanced, larger frame can carry off most designs. 

Fabric facts: Use stiffer fabric, but cut it 

like a flowy one. A woollen blend will look good.

Colours and prints: Experiment with bigger 

prints. Choose bright, happy colours. 

Cutting edge: Straight cuts. Stay away from 

tapered styles and overtly flowy designs.

Style right: Stay away from OTT (over the top) 

accessories. Keep it delicate and add on a scarf.

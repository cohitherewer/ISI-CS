The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

In the K-team

Screen On amp; Off

 Seventeen years after she shot to nationwide fame as Draupadi in BR Chopras megaserial Mahabharat, Roopa Ganguly is returning to the world of Hindi serials in a big way. Ektaa Kapoors Balaji Telefilms has roped her in to play a stylish socialite writer in its new family drama Karam Apna Apna.

 I play Sugna, a famous writer and also well-known in the social circuit. She is very dedicated to her family but is misunderstood by people. The character has been modelled after Shobhaa De. My look would be something like Shabana Azmis, says Roopa.

 I did serials like Parivartan and Parampara after Mahabharat but discontinued after that. I have been coaxed into this project after two-months of persuasion by Balaji, she adds.

 Karam Apna Apna, earlier named Kastoori, will have its share of intrigue and high-voltage emotional drama like other K-serials. As the story begins in Calcutta, the Balaji team will camp in town for a few days this month to shoot some scenes. 

 Roopas Mumbai schedule begins in September, with five to six days shoot a month. 

 From November onwards, I will be working in Mumbai 15 days a month. The working atmosphere in Mumbai is very congenial. I remember being very well treated on the sets of Mahabharat when I worked with Ravi Chopra, says Roopa, who is also working in Amol Palekars TV serial Krishnakali. 

 Among her other assignments is a string of feature films Raj Mukherjees Raat Bhor, Shibo Prasad Mukherjees Ichhe, Raja Mukherjees Bidhatar Lekha co-starring Jeet and Dia Mirza, and Raj Basus Piyalis Password, to be shot in Washington.

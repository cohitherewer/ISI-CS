The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 get through this week without 

 Scouting the bridal bazaar 

 So what if you are not the bride 

 or the groom, bridal bazaars are a great destination as 

 long as at least half a person you know is likely to say 

 I do soon. Use the seasons marriages as 

 an opportunity to update your wardrobe.

 Shop for a silk sari, an elegant 

 kurta or buy the earrings youve been eyeing forever. 

 And while you are at it, dont forget a wedding present 

 for the couple-in-question!

 Busying the blog

 Its about time you started 

 voicing your opinions on the Internet. And if you shy away 

 from being vociferous, you can still be part of it all without 

 writing a single word. Just read up, because there is plenty 

 written around.

 From what people really feel 

 about Mamata the menace and Maharajs 

 comeback to nagging in-laws to a great recipe There 

 truly is something for everyone. 

 Cheering for Dada

 Watch the Prince of Calcutta battle 

 it out against the South African quicks in the first Test 

 at Johannesburg. Will the comeback be as majestic as his 

 cover drive used to be? Be glued to the TV from December 

 15 to find out.

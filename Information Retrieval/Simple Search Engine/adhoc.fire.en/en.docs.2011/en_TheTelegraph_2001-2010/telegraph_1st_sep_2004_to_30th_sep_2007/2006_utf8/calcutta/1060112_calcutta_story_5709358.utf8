 Wannabe heroines sent home by cops 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two teenage girls? quest for Tollywood stardom ended in a real-life drama on Wednesday.

 Classmates Srabani Adak and Chandana Manna had left their Hooghly residences to become heroines, but were traced by cops to a producer?s house and sent back home.

 The Class IX students of Noiti High School dreamt of becoming filmstars, so on seeing a newspaper advertisement seeking a heroine for a Bengali film, they chalked out a plan to fulfil their ambition.

 The advertisement also mentioned that the candidates must undergo an acting course before being eligible for selection. The admission fee for the course was Rs 2,000.

 ?Both girls obtained the money from their parents before fleeing their residences at Janai, in Chanditala, on Monday afternoon,? said Debasish Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of Chanditala police station.

 Srabani left a note at home, saying she would be back only after establishing herself as a heroine. She asked her parents not to look for her or inform police.

 The two headed straight to the institution on Deshapran Sashmal Road where the acting course was due to be conducted and enrolled their names. ?In the evening, the girls told the other students that they had no place to go and wanted to speak to the producer who ran the institute,? added Chakraborty.

 After obtaining the address of Narayan Bhowmik, the producer, Srabani and Chandana reached his Teghoria residence. ?Bhowmik was in Krishnagar then,? said an officer of Charu Market police station.

 By then, the girls? parents had lodged a missing diary with Chanditala police station. ?After examining the caller line identification records of Srabani?s residential phone, we found that she had contacted Bhowmik before leaving home,? stated Chakraborty.

 The producer confirmed that the girls had visited his residence and promised to hand them over to the cops.

 ?Around midnight on Monday, Bhowmik brought the girls to the police station,? said an officer of Charu Market thana. 

 A team from Chanditala police station later took the girls back to Janai on Tuesday morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Drill for Metro disasters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civil defence department has chalked out a programme to train 20 officers of Metro Railway in disaster management. Sharon Nilson, chairman of an UK-based NGO that participated in the rescue operations after the London Underground blasts last year, will impart the training. 

 ?This is the first time such a programme has been planned. It will focus on technical aspects, like the best ways to carry out rescue operations in a tunnel and identification of electrified and neutral railway tracks. The NGO has agreed to conduct the programme for free,? said civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee.

 Last Friday, Mukherjee met Nilson, who is in the city for personal work. He asked her to conduct the training for Metro Railway. 

 Metro Railway will spend Rs 10,000 on books and equipment needed for the training, which is expected to begin next week. It will continue for a month. The officers will have to attend a three-hour class five days a week. Practical sessions will be conducted in the stations.

 ?Though there has been no major mishap in the Calcutta Metro so far, we must be prepared to fight emergencies, like an explosion or a stampede. Since the trains ply in a tunnel, our concept of the operations is not very clear.,? added Mukherjee.

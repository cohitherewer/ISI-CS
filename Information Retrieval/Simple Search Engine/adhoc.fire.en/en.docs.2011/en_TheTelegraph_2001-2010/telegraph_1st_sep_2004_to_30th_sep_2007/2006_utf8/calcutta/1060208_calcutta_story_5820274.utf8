 Finally, something for kids. Toon Disney presents the biggest kid?s contest on Indian television with Power Your Rangers Contest.

 The story goes something like this: The Rangers are calling on all kids to save them from trouble as Mesagog, the villain, has hidden the Dinogems, the source of the Rangers? powers, in the sinister Fortress of Evil. Mesagog has even destroyed the map to the Fortress.

 Now you can be part of the Power Rangers team by getting hold of the lost map. With every pack of Britannia Treat, you can get your hands on one part of the map. You have to collect all four pieces and complete the map to identify and locate the Dinogems.

 Starting January 23, the Fortress of Evil opens everyday on Toon Disney on Power Rangers Dino Thunder at 4.30 pm, revealing the location of one Dinogem. Six Dinogems have to be located, with the sixth being revealed on the 12th of February in a Power Rangers Marathon.

 Kids have to identify the locations and send their entries, either by SMS, snail mail, phone calls, or e-mail on the website www.toondisneyindia.com. Five lucky winners win a trip to New Zealand with their families. Also, 55 other kids can win Play Station II Consoles and Power Rangers game. That?s not all, 10,000 of the fastest correct entries will win Quick Gun Prizes: Power Your Ranger Bravery medals.

 ?Power Rangers is a superhit and kids across India relate to this genre of action and adventure just the way it has been a phenomenon in 140 countries. This contest promises to take our young viewers on a dyno-trip to the world of their favourite heroes,? feels Nachiket Pantvaidya, director programming and production, Walt Disney Television International (India).

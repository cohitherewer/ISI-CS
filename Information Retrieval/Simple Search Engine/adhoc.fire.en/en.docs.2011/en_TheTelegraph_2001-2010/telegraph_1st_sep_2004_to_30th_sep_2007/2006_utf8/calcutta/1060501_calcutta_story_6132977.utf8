Glass is a timeless medium, creating an effect that 

cannot be duplicated by any other form.

 Niche, novel and neat, it enhances art in any cast or mould. It forms your favourite crockery, fashions your living room show-cabinet, accentuates the look of your modish wardrobe and, of course, makes for eye-catching showpieces to treasure.

 Yet, you never seem to have enough of this transparent medium and must already be wondering what your next glass pick could be.

 Stunning boot, bag, basket, hat and umbrella-shaped glass showpieces from Nik Nish at 22 Camac Street, are sure to carry forward your glassy affair in style.

 Imported from Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Turkey and China, they seem to draw inspiration from the current fashion week fads.

 So if you have indulged in a brand new pair of biker boots, let your home also put its best foot forward.

 Boot-like vases are definite eye catchers at Nik Nish. Smart and trendy, these life-size pointed boots with black heels come in cheetah prints, zebra stripes, a blue and black blend and red-black stripes, allowing you to co-ordinate with the interiors of your house.

 The merchandise is from places believed to be destinations where fashion is born and breeds. The items stand out for great looks, fine finish and the utility quotient. Buyers today believe in intelligent gifting and these items fit the bill as great gifting options. For many, it is a suitable pack-in for their own home decor too, smiles Ranjan Purkayastha, general manager, Nik Nish.

 The glass gala is more popular with homemakers, adds Purkayastha.

 Vases that look like hand baskets are broad at the base and narrow towards the neck. 

 Each has glass handles pointing upwards. Black vases with ochre spots look sober. Fluorescent green ones with white and blue polkas catch the eye. 

 While tucking in flowers brings in a breath of freshness, you could add a touch of your creativity by entwining the handles with some fresh climbers.

 Hand-purse vases are smaller in size, very yesteryear in style and form. But the colour palette and patterns strike a contemporary note. 

 They come in electric combinations of black-blue, yellow-white, black-white and white-blue, peppered with shades of oranges and browns. Dot your dining table with hat-shaped fruit bowls in the middle. 

 While some are decorated with ribbons and flower attachments, others showcase a neatly tied bow. You can choose from cheerful flower illustrations, stripes and abstract patterns.

 Upturned umbrella showpieces remind you of the must-carry summer essential, outdoors. With spiral handles, they come in various colours.

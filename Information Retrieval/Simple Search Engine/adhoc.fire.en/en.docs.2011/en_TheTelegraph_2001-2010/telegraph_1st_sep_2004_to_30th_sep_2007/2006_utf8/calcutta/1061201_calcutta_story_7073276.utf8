 What: 

 Festa Italiana food festival. 

 Where: Fire and Ice Restaurant 

 and Bar, Kanak Building, JL Nehru Road.

 When: Till December 3.

 Take a look: As part of Festa Italiana 2006, the annual showcase window of the best of the made in Italy, an Italian food festival is being hosted by Fire and Ice. Agostino Pinna, consul general of Italy in Calcutta, inaugurated the festival.

 The spread: The menu travels miles from the Lombardia region of Italy. For starters, theres Antipasto Misto mini caprese salad, tomato bruschetta, imported black olives, pickled carrots, artichokes focaccia bread with a choice of salami or egg. An Italian meal would be incomplete without Risotto Alla Milanese (imported arborio rice with saffron, sauteed in butter and olive oil with onion and parmesan). For desserts, theres an owners special recipe called Stefanos Tiramisu (layered light and fluffy sponge-based dessert with coffee and chocolate cream flavours).

 Voiceover: Italian cuisine is much more than just pizzas and pastas. The Italian week is a celebration of authentic Italian cuisine, bringing the best from Lombardia region in Italy, said Pinna.

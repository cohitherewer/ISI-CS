 The City Diary

 A fast-track court on Wednesday sentenced a 53-year-old 

 teacher of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sinthee, to two years rigorous 

 imprisonment for molesting a nine-year-old student. Police 

 said Rajendra Gayen had molested the child in December last 

 year in his house. The girl used to go over to his house 

 for tuition. 

 Her parents felt suspicious after she almost stopped eating 

 and talking to them. But their repeated queries drew a blank. 

 They took her to a psychiatrist, who could finally persuade 

 the child to narrate what had happened to her. A complaint 

 was then lodged and the womens cell of the detective department 

 started a probe. 

 Three armed criminals robbed Rs 18 lakh from a collection agent of gold merchants late on Tuesday. Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south), said Atul Kateria was returning home with the money in a polythene bag when the criminals intercepted him on Ashu Biswas Road, in Bhowanipore. They snatched the bag and fled. No one has been arrested.

 A criminal case has been started against a doctor of a south Calcutta nursing home on the basis of a complaint alleging that his negligence had led to the death of a patient. Police said on Wednesday that the relatives of the patient, Subhra Guha, had alleged that the doctor, Anupam Dey, had been negligent while treating her. The relatives had even ransacked the nursing home.

 V.K. Thambhi, a passenger of a Bangladesh-bound plane, was detained by the officials of the Customs and directorate of revenue intelligence for his alleged links with sandalwood smuggling.

Traffic snarls were reported from GT Road, Howrah Police Station Road and Biplabi Haren Ghosh Avenue, as the protesters marched their way to the bungalow.

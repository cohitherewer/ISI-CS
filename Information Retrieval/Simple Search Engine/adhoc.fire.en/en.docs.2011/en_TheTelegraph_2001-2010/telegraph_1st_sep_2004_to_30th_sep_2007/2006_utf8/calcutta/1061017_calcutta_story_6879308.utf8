 Duel fought in CM yard

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Two groups of youths clashed and even threw stones near the chief ministers residence, off Bondel Road, on Sunday evening.

 The fight started around 7.30 pm and continued for two hours, till police reached the spot. The windscreen of a taxi was smashed and some local residents were injured in the violence. No one has been arrested yet.

 According to police, a fight between two drunks led to the violence. Local residents, however, said the clash started when some youths from a neighbouring locality tried to extort Rs 50 as Kali puja subscription from a stall-owner at Bamonpara.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

When writing?s all wrong

The chief minister obviously has words to spare. But 

Metro suggests that he save his pearls for public good instead of wasting 

them on graffiti 

 GET IT WRITE: (Top): Writers? Buildings 

had been misspelt as Writer?s Building on the overhead signboard as one descends 

from the AJC Bose Road flyover on Hospital Road. The correction was carried out 

in haste and complete slipshod manner. (Center): There?s no bypassing the erroneous 

EM Bye-pass signboard on the Park Circus connector. (Above): Even the Calcutta 

Municipal Corporation ward office bears the wrong spelling of Prinsep Street on 

its signboard. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

Spell check

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should at once correct the 

spelling errors for which his government is responsible.

Eastern Metropolitan Bypass has been ?Bye-pass? for 

quite some time on the overhead sign as one approaches the bypass connector from 

Park Circus. It might be risky, as would-be foreign investors will pass under 

it.

Prinsep Street ? named after James Prinsep, scholar 

and antiquary ? was officially renamed ?Princep? long ago and accepted without 

question by every shop on it.

Mangoe Lane is generally promoted as Mango Lane.

Is correct spelling superfluous to good governance? 

Road signs 

Instead of ?joler tankies? as landmarks ? and 

the 1 on water tank No. 10 often vanishes ? Salt Lake could do with a few road 

signs. They would be particularly helpful after dark, when every street, every 

office building and every residential area looks like the other, straight out 

of a nightmare maze in a video game in which the driver gets lost.

New Alipore and Behala are also crying out for some 

lettering on their roads. And north of Shyambazar and south of Jadavpur are quite 

signage-free.

The powers that be could also use some lettering on 

a necessary public utility: toilets. Even if they exist, there is no indication. 

There are three public toilets in Esplanade, but when nature calls, where are 

they? (Answer: In Curzon Park, near Shahid Minar and adjacent to Bhawanipore tent.) 

No way out 

We demand more one-way signs. Navigating the Park 

Street-Wood Street-Camac Street stretch, thanks to signs that are probably hidden 

in foliage or kicked away into a corner, is a particular challenge. The no-entry 

sign at the Mullickbazar-Park Street crossing doesn?t have timings on it.

Parking puzzles

First, we would like to have the car parking signs 

in place. Then, also, information on whether it?s free or paid, please.

Landmark-less

Historical structures need an introduction. It has 

begun, but we could do with more (and correct) information.

The road sign says that the abandoned building on 

Nimtala Ghat Street was Rajabagan thana, but does not mention that it was 

originally Duff School, started by Alexandar Duff, Scottish missionary and educationist.

We pass the Metro cinema building every day without 

realising that it is one of the first art deco buildings in Calcutta, a trendsetter 

in the 50s.

But words may not be enough to describe the horror 

of the Adi Brahmo Samaj building in Chitpur turning into a marble chip godown.

History ahoy

It may be asking for too much, but there should also 

be signs leading to a landmark. 

There is little to indicate that the Tagore memorial 

is located at Nimtala Ghat. How many Calcuttans know that the State Archaeological 

Museum is in the same compound as Behala tram depot? 

And how many are aware of an industrial museum, showcasing 

Bengal?s industrial heritage, on Ganesh Chandra Avenue?

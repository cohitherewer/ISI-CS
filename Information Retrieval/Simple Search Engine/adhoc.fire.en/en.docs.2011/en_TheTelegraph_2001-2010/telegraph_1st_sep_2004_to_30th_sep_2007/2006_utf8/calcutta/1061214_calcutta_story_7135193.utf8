 Coin corridors of crime

 KINSUK BASU

 A mesh of winding lanes, rows of highrises with shops dotting every floor, pigeons seeking cool shades, gutkha, gold bars, chaandi coins and NSE terminals welcome to Sonapatti in Burrabazar. 

 Crime here thrives under rugs in the cover of darkness. For, Sonapatti is not just about sona. Its as much about dollars and silver coins, old gold ornaments and gold bars, and bets on everything from cricket to weather.

 Krishnapada Mondals murder early on Wednesday in an hour when Sonapatti is alive to the shady sights and hushed sounds of illegal transactions threatens to turn the spotlight on a dark pocket in the heart of the city.

 Traders say business worth Rs 20-25 crore is transacted on any given day from around 200 shops in Sonapatti. 

 As dusk descends, the narrow lanes metamorphose into corridors of corruption. First, women from the villages of North and South 24-Parganas flock the area as prostitution takes centre stage.

 That continues till around 11 pm, when the flesh trade fades out and the coin trade starts jingling.

 A section of traders operates only between 11 at night and 3 in the morning. All of them deal in coins that are sold off to traders who in turn take it to markets in New Delhi, Varanasi and even down south. Here, they are melted to extract copper or other metals, reveals a trader.

 The coins sell for anything between Rs 340 and Rs 350 a kg and for every kg sold, the margin is over Rs 10. At least two to three tonnes of such coins are traded on an average, every day, he adds, sitting in a room quite like the one Mondal was murdered in.

 That room on Manohar Das Street encapsulates the world of Sonapatti a partition, a television set, a rug and a small vault in front, an electronic weighing scale amidst heaps of gunny bags and dumps of coins behind all that. The labourers work through the night loading these gunny bags on trucks that carry the coins far and wide. The transactions are always in cash, says a trader.

 The traders are to blame for the state of affairs at Sonapatti. Once you decide to trade in coins and dollars, you draw dubious customers from as far as Murshidabad, Malda and Basirhat to Sonapatti, observes Hari Prakash Soni, secretary of Bangiya Swarna Shilpi Samity. 

 Police, however, refused to label Sonapatti a crime zone. The murder is an isolated incident. We keep vigil at night, claims an officer.

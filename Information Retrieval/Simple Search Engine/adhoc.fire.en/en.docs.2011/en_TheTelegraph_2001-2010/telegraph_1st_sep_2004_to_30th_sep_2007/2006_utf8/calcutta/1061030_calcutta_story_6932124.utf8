The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green buses for clean air

 Ashoke Bhattacharyya, managing director 

 of Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC), met readers 

 of The Telegraph and answered their queries. Participants 

 included Diptimoy Ghosh, J.N. Das, Mohd. Sharique Ehsan, 

 Chandrima Ghosh, Bidyut Banerjee and Sandip Banerjee

 Diptimoy Ghosh: Most of the CSTC buses are in a very bad shape. Apart from emitting harmful smoke, the carriers are broken and do not have proper seats and windows. Are you planning to improve the condition of these buses?

 I agree with you and admit that many of our buses are pretty old and should be replaced. 

 The CSTC is a heritage corporation. 

 Nearly 35 per cent of our buses are old and are phased out 

 at regular intervals. Recently, a few new buses of BS-II 

 and BS-III standards have been introduced, replacing the 

 carriers, which were over two decades old. Plans are afoot 

 to phase out a few more buses. We are chalking out the proposal 

 and we are also planning to buy environment-friendly vehicles 

 because pollution control is the need of the hour.

 Diptimoy Ghosh: But the bus fare of the new carriers is quite high and the common man cannot afford it. Can you look into the matter and reduce the fare? 

 So far as the fare of the new-look buses are concerned, it is the same as before. I think you have boarded our luxury buses by mistake . 

 Some private and chartered buses are also plying on the roads. These buses dont have standing facilities for passengers and are run by private entrepreneurs. We are only providing them with the licence to operate the buses after inspecting their infrastructure for the service.

 Besides, route plans, based on a geographical information system to determine the need of bus services in specific routes, are also on the cards. 

 Mohd. Sharique Ehsan: A few more buses from the Park Circus area to BBD Bag are needed, especially during peak hours. Presently, the buses on this route are unable to tackle the rush and as a result we are late for work. 

 We will look into the matter. 

 If you can send us a detailed letter stating your demands 

 and the current crisis, we will definitely take steps at 

 our board meeting.

 Chandrima Ghosh: Do you feel the CSTC drivers are properly screened before a driving licence is issued to them?

 I realise the point you are trying to make. Our drivers need some special training before taking up the job. 

 Plans are afoot to start a driving training centre run by our corporation, where we will impart training to the drivers. We will also try to create real-life situations for the trainees and teach them how to handle it. We will test the skills of the trainee before offering him the certificate. We are also preparing the logistics to establish such a centre and hope to open its doors by the end of next year. 

 J.N. Das: Why cant you reserve a few seats for senior citizens, women and the disabled in the bus and also offer some concessions ?

 This is a very good proposal. But we will incur some financial loss while incorporating your plan. However, we are working on an earlier proposal to reserve some seats for the disabled. 

 As far as concession for senior citizens is concerned, we are not in a position to offer such schemes immediately. Instead, we are planning to introduce passes on CSTC buses. This will be similar to the monthly tickets on trains. I think it will be cheaper in comparison to other means of transport. 

 We also have a plan to introduce a single pass for both the state buses and the passenger trains. 

 Sandip Banerjee: You have introduced several luxury buses for places like Ranchi and Puri. Do you have plans to introduce more buses on other routes?

 These luxury buses are being operated 

 on surplus operation schemes through public-private partnership. 

 We have got a good response from the passengers, especially 

 on the Calcutta-Puri route. We are planning to introduce 

 a few more services to Vizag and Varanasi. The buses will 

 start from the Esplanade terminus. You may even book your 

 tickets online.

 Bidyut Banerjee: CSTC buses on the Salt Lake route are withdrawn after 11 pm. Can you introduce a late-night service ?

 I will look into the matter and 

 will discuss it with our operating officers. We will have 

 to examine the situation and see whether with our financial 

 limitations, we can extend our service by an hour.

 Concluded

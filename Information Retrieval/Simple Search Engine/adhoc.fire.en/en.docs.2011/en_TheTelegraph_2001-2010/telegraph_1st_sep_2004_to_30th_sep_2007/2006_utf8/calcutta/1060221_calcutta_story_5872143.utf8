 Police help to throw out tenants

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tension ran high in the Burrabazar area on Monday afternoon, when a large police contingent gathered in front of a three-storeyed building on Rabindra Sarani to execute a high court order to evict 34 families from it.

 The police clashed with some local residents who had put up a blockade at the entrance to the building. Before forcing their way into it, they lathicharged the crowd to disperse it.

 According to the police, the landlord of the building had moved the high court seeking their intervention to evict the tenants. The court passed its order in favour of the petitioner and directed police to provide all assistance in the eviction.

 ?We went there to execute the court order. A scuffle broke out when we tried to enter the building and local people resisted. No one was injured in the operation but 18 people were arrested for obstructing the police,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (central). 

 He directed that barricades be erected to stop traffic movement on a 200-metre stretch of the road.

 Police began to make preparations from noon. Officers of Posta police station gathered in front of the building near Ganesh Talkies, and took up position on Rabindra Sarani.

 The situation took a turn for the worse when the tenants bolted the main door from inside. Local people, too, assembled there and raised slogans against the police. Police waited for over half-an-hour.

 ?The people of the locality were raising their voice, saying the tenants had nowhere to go to after being driven out,? said an officer of Posta police station.

 Police marched towards the building, that houses business establishments on the ground floor and residential flats on the first and second floors. 

 ?We had to make a lathicharge, as the local people blocked the road,? said another police officer, adding: ?As soon as those who put up obstruction dispersed, we broke open the entrance to reach the first and second floors.?

 The tenants had been told to vacate their places for the past two days, police added. But they did not heed the warnings. ?We entered the rooms and took out their belongings. We kept these on the pavement and asked the tenants to shift them as soon as possible,? said the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Their plays on our platform

 The Beatles: Resurrected

 Drama group Theatrecian and Dialogue 

 Club joined forces at Oxford Bookstore to address an enduring 

 dilemma of Indian dramatists working in the English language 

 on Wednesday. The panel consisting of Suman Mukhopadhyay, 

 Vinay Sharma, Tathagata Chowdhury, Shuktara Lal and Katy 

 Lai Roy discussed why Indian theatre groups gravitate towards 

 plays written by American and European authors instead of 

 works by Indian writers. Titled Our Plays, Our Stage, the 

 talk was moderated by Trina Nileena Banerjee.

 The discussion, which threw up more questions than answers, was organised as a preface to Shuktara?s upcoming production of Goa at Gyan Manch on April 27. The play by Asif Currimbhoy is set in Goa when it was still a Portuguese enclave, and raises questions of nationality and independence.

 ?There are so many Indian plays that we haven?t heard about; I don?t believe there is a dearth of contemporary Indian playwrights in the English language. The themes that Goa addresses are still very relevant today. Yet, Currimbhoy?s work is more lauded abroad than it is in India,? said Shuktara, explaining her choice of the play.

 Katy Lai Roy, a veteran on the Calcuttan stage, agreed that there is a ?problem with accessibility? of Indian plays. ?For years, our main source of plays was the British Council Library, which stocked mainly contemporary English and American plays. It is lucky that we now have such places as Seagull. There is also the additional problem of seeking permission from playwrights,? stressed Katy.

 Suman Mukhopadhyay, director of Tritiyo Sutra, said: ?Everybody is working within their own spheres. There is a fundamental isolation. There is no single platform or sense of togetherness.?

 Tathagata Chowdhury of Theatrecian 

 attributed the Euro-centricity of many dramatists to education: 

 ?The CBSE and ICSE syllabuses are heavily based on European 

 and American plays. We simply don?t know enough about our 

 own plays.?

 Sad act

 Weird productions fly into town 

 sometimes. Shararat, subtitled ?A Hilarious Out and 

 Out Hindi Comedy on Romance? (the subtleties of vocabulary 

 would take quite a while to sort out), made one shudder 

 with its conservatism masquerading as freedom of choice 

 and its ethnic stereotyping in the guise of humour. 

 Shweta Tiwari and Vinay Jain play two young strangers escaping from their families? desires to arrange their marriages. They land up in the same hotel room, take an instant dislike to each other, but have to figure out how to spend the night together. The only other character, a Sikh, totally redundant, enters the room periodically for no other reason than to inject tasteless farce based on the myth of brainless Sikhs. 

 Meanwhile, the couple ? no surprise here ? begin to see eye to eye, fall for each other and discover that their families had actually intended to marry them off. The orthodox status quo prevails. No wonder the author wishes to remain anonymous.

 Of the two TV stars, Tiwari reveals 

 some semblance of acting skills, but Navin Kumar?s direction 

 suits television better anyway, which is where Shararat 

 belongs.

 Fab four unplugged

 Unreleased music by The Beatles 

 is set to appear in a show by Cirque du Soleil, the famed 

 French troupe of acrobats, at Las Vegas?s Mirage hotel, 

 later this summer.

 The songs are being reworked for the soundtrack of the circus show and an accompanying album. Legendary producer George Martin, who worked with The Fab Four on most of their albums, is overseeing the music for the show. Outtakes from various Beatles albums are being worked on to assemble new forms of old songs. The surviving band members, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, are also overseeing the project along with the families of John Lennon and George Harrison. The new music will come 36 years after the rockers broke up, 25 years after the death of John Lennon and more than four years after the death of George Harrison, who thought of the Cirque project idea. 

 The announcement of new music from the show accompanies reports of Apple, the group?s label, remastering the entire Beatles catalogue for eventual reissues. The remastered tracks will become available for digital downloads on services like iTunes.

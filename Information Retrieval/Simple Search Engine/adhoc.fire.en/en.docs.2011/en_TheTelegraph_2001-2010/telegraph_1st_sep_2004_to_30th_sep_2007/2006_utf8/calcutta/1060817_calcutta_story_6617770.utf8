 Research institute opens doors

 Bikash Sinha: Grooming talents 

 Nearly a month after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone of Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi formally inaugurated the institute on Wednesday. 

 Following the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, the Centre decided to set up two high-calibre research institutes (the other IISER will come up in Pune) to integrate science education and research. 

 If you tell someone you are studying B.Sc with physics honours, you are considered out of your mind. This disenchantment with the subject has to go. We cannot afford this anymore, said Bikash Sinha, governing body member, IISER, and also director, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP).

 The institute is modelled on Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and will conduct both standard and integrated masters and doctoral programmes. 

 But the mandate for IISER is to promote flexible and border-less curricula in all disciplines of basic sciences. Besides classroom instructions, the institute will develop skills in areas such as scientific inquiry, problem solving, communication skills, computational sciences and electronics and instrumentation. 

 The first academic session will commence with 40 students from Thursday. 

 Marrying research and education being the focus of the institute, the emphasis will be on getting the right faculty, both permanent and visiting. 

 Indian scientists from all over the world are keen to teach at the new institute, which doesnt have a bureaucratic legacy, observed Sushanta Dattagupta, director, IISER. 

 Not just top scientists and researchers from Indian institutes like SINP, IIT Kharagpur, SN Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Bose Institute, IISER will also draw faculty from leading academic centres across the world. 

 Eminent people from University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, University of California, Cambridge University, University of Mainz in Germany, Chalmers University, Gotheburg, Sweden, Ohio State University and Harvard University are willing to join, added Dattagupta. 

 The first batch of students will start attending classes on the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research campus in Salt Lake. But by 2008, IISER will have its own campus in Haringhata, for which the state government has earmarked a 250-acre plot in Kalyani. The financial outlay for each IISER is around Rs 500 crore for the first five years. 

 Referring to a recent study conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research that revealed only three per cent of school students want to pursue a career in science, Sinha summed up the role of IISER: This is disconcerting. This is where IISERs come into the picture; in grooming science talent fresh out of school.

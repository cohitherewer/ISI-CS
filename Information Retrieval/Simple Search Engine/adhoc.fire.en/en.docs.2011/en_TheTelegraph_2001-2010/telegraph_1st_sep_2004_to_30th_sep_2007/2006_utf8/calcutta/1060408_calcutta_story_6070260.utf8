 Swipe cards for Lalbazar babus

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Come June, 600 employees of the Lalbazar police headquarters will be issued smart cards, to check latecomers 

 In an attempt to discipline the babus at the headquarters, a separate gate is being built near the central lock-up, where the employees will have to swipe their smart cards to enter Lalbazar. 

 ?Smart cards will be issued to all the 600 employees to instil a sense of discipline among them. A separate gate is being built for the purpose and they will have to enter the gate by swiping their cards. The new process will start after the election. Once introduced, the date and timing will be registered automatically,? said Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner of police (administration).

 At present, these employees use the same gate used by other IPS officers, policemen and visitors to enter Lalbazar.

 A senior IPS officer said the decision was taken recently, after a meeting with all senior officers, including police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. It was observed that most of the office staff come late to work and leave early. 

 ?Certainly, the move will help in improving work culture at the police headquarters. Several employees, especially those in the finance and accounts sections, are not punctual. This has affected work, as these are crucial departments,? the officer added.

 Meanwhile, the move has triggered resentment among a section of the office employees. A fortnight ago, they had even protested against the new system, saying the new gate is being built near an unhygienic place where drains are always overflowing.

 ?There are times when we have to be in office till 8 pm. What is the harm if someone comes at noon and leaves at 8 pm?? asked an employee with the traffic account section. 

 Joint commissioner Singh said after the new system is adopted, a late arrival will have to be accompanied by a written application justifying the delay. ?Over the past few months, we have introduced many plans to modernise the force. The smart card is one of them and it has dual advantages. We can keep a tab on the staff, and this will make them more responsible when under pressure,? Singh explained.

 Repeat Cast: Abhishek Bachchan in Shaad Alis 

Bunty Aur Babli

 You wouldn?t expect a veteran of two Bollywood blockbusters to go back and assist his mentor. But that?s what Shaad Ali has done, shooting off to Turkey to be beside Mani Ratnam as he directs Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai in Guru. Before making Saathiya and Bunty Aur Babli, Shaad had assisted Mani Sir on Dil Se and Alaipayuthey.

 It?s not that Shaad hasn?t been planning his own directorial venture. Slated to be another Yash Raj production, his next film has been tentatively titled Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. As the name suggests, it will be yet another masala movie with a whole lot of music.

 Going his producer Aditya Chopra?s way, Shaad has taken a stance of keeping mum about his projects. He didn?t talk about Bunty Aur Babli and he has no plans of talking about Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. 

 When Metro contacted him to know the details of his new directorial venture, Shaad said: ?I am still writing the script and it?s a bit early to talk about the film. Of the cast, only Abhishek and Bobby (Deol) have been finalised.?

 While the strong buzz was Preity Zinta being signed as the leading lady for Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Shaad didn?t confirm the speculation. He did mention that Abhik Mukhopadhyay, who had shot Bunty Aur Babli, will not be the cinematographer for Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.

 After its rich exploits at the box-office, the celluloid version of C. S. Lewis?s The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe now reaches drawing rooms through Excel Home Video. The recently launched DVD has loads of add-ons to make the viewing extra special.

 Apart from following the fascinating story of how four ordinary children chance upon the magical land of Narnia through a professor?s wardrobe, you can check out the hilarious movie bloopers. There is a separate section on Narnia?s fun facts that traces back to the times when Lewis wrote the story. And finally, there are cast and crew commentaries to help you go behind the scenes.

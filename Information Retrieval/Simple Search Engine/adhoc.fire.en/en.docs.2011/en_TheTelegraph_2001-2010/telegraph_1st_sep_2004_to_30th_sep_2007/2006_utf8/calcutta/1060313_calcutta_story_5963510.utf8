The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The real Rambha

 She is shy, soft-spoken and very modest. Parties and late nights are not her style because her heart is where her home is. And mother keeps her company at every shoot, no matter where. Yes, this Telugu star known for her dare-bare image stumps you with her goodie girl ways.

 In Paradip, Rambha is bar dancer 

 Julie, in love with Shiva, played by Prosenjit.

 Before signing Refugee, Rambha had starred in two Bengali films ? Krishna and Cheetah ? both opposite Mithun Chakraborty. But neither has she seen any of these, nor did she ever travel to Calcutta to shoot for them. But Refugee may see her camping in town some time next month.

 ?My role in this film is a little different from what action films have for heroines, and so I took it up. Also because of the producer, the director and Prosenjit whom I had seen in Biyer Phool, which also had Rani Mukherjee, and Chokher Bali,? Rambha smiles charmingly, dressed in a green salwar kameez. Sitting beside her mother under a fishermen?s tent on the beach crowded with fans gaping at her, Rambha waits for her cue in a fight sequence with Prosenjit only a few yards away.

 Down south, Rambha has found favour in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada films. Apart from Bollywood, there have been Bhojpuri and now Bengali films. ?People tell me that I am like water and can fill any vessel,? says the Chennai-based actress with a second home in Hyderabad.

 ?I am not very ambitious career-wise,? she states. ?I am happy with what comes my way. Earlier I used to do 11 to 12 films a year, now I have cut it down to seven or eight... In Telugu, I have been accepted as a glamourous actress, while in Malayalam films they see me more as an actress of sentimental films.?

 Rambha, who starred in Gharwali Baharwali, Judwaa, Bandhan and Kyun Ki Main Jhooth Nahin Bolta, is not too keen to park herself in Bollywood. ?I am happy that the David Dhawan films did well? I prefer to work with some select groups only. You need to settle in Mumbai if you want to make it big in Bollywood and I didn?t want to do that. After every shoot, I would be homesick and want to go back to Chennai? I don?t have many friends and I don?t go partying, but I do attend my film premieres!?

 And yet this homely heroine revels in her sex kitten image and consciously steers clear of the few offbeat roles that occasionally come her way. ?The trends in Hindi films are changing and I have turned down some offers because I don?t want to experiment. I want people to remember me as a very pretty actress and a good dancer.?

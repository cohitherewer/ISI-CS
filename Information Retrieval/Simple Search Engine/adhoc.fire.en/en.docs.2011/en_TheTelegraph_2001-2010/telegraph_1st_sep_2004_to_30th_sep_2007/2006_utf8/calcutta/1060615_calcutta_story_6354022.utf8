 The City Diary

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Wednesday requested assessees living in 13 wards (66, 67, 89, 91-100) to ignore the outstanding property tax amount shown along with penalty and interest in the current demand notice. The errors resulted from a snag in computers in the Gariahat office of the civic body. The commissioner, however, said the present property tax amount shown in the upper part of the bill is correct. Revised bills will be issued later. 

 The CBI on Wednesday arrested Gopalji, a section officer in the office of the controller of defence accounts, for accepting a bribe of Rs 20,000 from a contractor for clearing his pending bill of Rs 8.42 lakh.

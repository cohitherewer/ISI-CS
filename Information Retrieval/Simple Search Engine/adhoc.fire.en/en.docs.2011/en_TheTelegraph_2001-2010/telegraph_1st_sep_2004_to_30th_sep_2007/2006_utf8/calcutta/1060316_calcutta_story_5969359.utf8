 Dealing with the heritage, aesthetics and values of Indian culture, the Rang-Roop production Hey More Debata makes an exemplary statement in support of universal tolerance and world peace. Textually based on folk form and dialects, the core of the drama is redolent with the everlasting and infallible fragrance of love. Seen through the perspective of the Turkish invasion, it projects human fears and insecurities and the complexities of our inter-personal relations, that lead to insurgent attitudes and racial conflicts. In the play, Pagol, the madman, symbolises God?s rejoicing in his own creation, in spite of all the troubles and uncertainties of the mortal world. The character of Bhavananda restores our belief in the fact that we must not lose faith in humanity under any circumstance. Although the play ends on a note of tragic estrangement, it is clear that love shall finally triumph over all antagonistic forces. Written by Deborshi Saroghee. Direction: Seema Mukherjee.

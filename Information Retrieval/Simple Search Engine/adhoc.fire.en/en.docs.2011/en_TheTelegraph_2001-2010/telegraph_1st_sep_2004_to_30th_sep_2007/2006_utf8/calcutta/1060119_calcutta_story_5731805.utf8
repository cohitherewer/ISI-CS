 RAISE A TOAST TO TEA: The Bangalore tea bar-cum-restaurant

 Green Tea, Earl Grey, Lemon, Masala, Ginger, Elaichi and Peach? If you think you know your tea, step into a chain of tea-rooms-cum-restaurants opening this March with 89 varieties of your favourite drink.

 Infinitea, a brand from the century-old Gopaldhara tea plantations of Darjeeling, has been successfully running a tea room on Cunningham Road, Bangalore, since 2003. And now, it?s time to raise a toast to tea closer home and take the beverage battle to the coffee shops and lounges.

 The first restaurant will open at Poddar Court Gate 2 in March, followed by one in Sector V, Salt Lake, in August. Two others will turn on the tea tap at the South City Mall, on Prince Anwar Shah Road, by Durga Puja ?06 and then the ladies? mall Avani Galleria on Park Street (?because ladies have always been keen on tea?) in 2007.

 But why did Infinitea debut in Bangalore? B.K. Saria, owner of Gopaldhara plantations, says: ?We knew that Bangalore being a land of coffee drinkers was a tough terrain and if we could make a good impression there, we would survive anywhere. We are now confident about Calcutta because the Infinitea tea bags retailed through various malls over the past three years have done well. People here are obviously ready for more flavours.?

 Like in Bangalore, sip and bite will remain the combination but the focus will be sharper in Calcutta. The Poddar Court address, for instance, will be open from 8 am to 11 pm on weekdays. ?We have seen a paucity of good breakfast places and we will be offering everything from corn flakes, hash browns, pancakes with maple syrup and baked beans on toast,? said Saria, whose son Gaurav is a trained chef and heads the Infintea project. For lunch, tea and dinner, there will be a spread of continental cuisine, with ?street food hygienically prepared? thrown in to pamper the Calcutta taste bud.

 The top Infinitea draw, however, will be tea. Darjeeling, Assam and Nilgiri tea will appear in various avatars and flavours like Kashmiri Kahwa or Peony Rosette, Avongrove Stupa or Dragon Pearl, Elixir on the Rocks or Pearls of the Mountain. And then there?s the Chilled Chilli Chai!

 Park Circus market is set to be the fourth civic market in Calcutta to be revamped through public-private partnership.

 According to the plan, the 76-year-old market, standing on 5.72 bigha on Karaya Road, will be replaced by a five or six-storeyed shopping mall with modern facilities, including underground parking.

 During reconstruction, the 400-odd stall-owners will be relocated at the nearby Park Circus maidan.

 The civic body had earlier approved the revamp of New Market, College Street market and Entally market through public-private partnership.

 The decision to revamp the Park Circus market was finalised at the official level on Wednesday, at a meeting called by municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. Civic engineers and officials in the public-private participation (PPP) cell of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) discussed the ?technical feasibility and market viability? of the proposed revamp. 

 The proposal will be tabled in the mayoral council meeting for approval this month. 

 The CMC recently decided to privatise its 21 markets but before leasing them out, the civic authorities have a plan to renovate them, said Bandyopadhyay.

 The civic body, which incurs a loss in running the Park Circus market, expects to earn Rs 20 crore from the deal. It will also get 10,000-sq ft floor space from the private partner. By selling the space at the market rate, the CMC can earn about Rs 50 crore more.

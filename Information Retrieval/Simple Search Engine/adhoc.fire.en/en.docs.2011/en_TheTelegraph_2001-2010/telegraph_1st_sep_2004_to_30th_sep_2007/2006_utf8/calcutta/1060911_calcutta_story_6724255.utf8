 What: 

 PC Chandra Swapnopriya 2006, in association with 93.5 Red 

 FM.

 Where: Science City auditorium.

 When: Friday evening.

 Take a look: Six women, some homemakers and others professionals, walked the ramp showcasing their talent, grace and poise. They were the finalists of the PC Chandra Swapnopriya 2006, a six-week activity held between the first week of July and the second week of August. Participants had to call in to the Red Adda show and describe their dream attire and jewellery while attending a wedding.

 Each day announced a winner who walked away with a 15 gm silver coin medal. Men could call in, too, and describe how his partner should dress up. Daily winners were interviewed to hunt out a weekly winner. The six weekly winners made it to the finals, where they flaunted their dream attire and jewellery on stage.

 The judges for the evening were actress Indrani Halder, deputy managing director, PC Chandra Group, Prashanta Chandra and Jimmy Tangree, the voice of Red FM.

 Smiles in place and feeling confident with their spouses by their side, the women looked gorgeous in lehngas, chiffons, Kanjeevarams, Benarasi tissues and a host of jewellery. The dumb charade session was fun. In the question-answer round, questions like it is said that jewellery is a womans weakness. How will you explain it as a strength? and which one quality of your man will you compare to pure gold? were answered with aplomb. Later in the evening, each participant had to explain why she had chosen her attire and jewellery.

 Finally, it was time to announce the winner. While all finalists received gold earrings, Swapnopriya 2006 Hazel Philips walked away with a PC Chandra wedding necklace.

 Voiceover: I come from an industry where we play with dreams. Its great to be at a programme where dreams come true on stage, smiled Indrani.

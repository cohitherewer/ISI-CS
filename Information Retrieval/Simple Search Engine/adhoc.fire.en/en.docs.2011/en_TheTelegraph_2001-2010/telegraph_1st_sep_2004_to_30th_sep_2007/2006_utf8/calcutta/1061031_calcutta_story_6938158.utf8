Story scripted by nature

Happy Feet maker GEORGE MILLER tells Pratim 

D. Gupta how a tale of penguins becomes a human fable

 A moment from Happy Feet 

After making action blockbusters like Mad Max, why did you venture into 

animation movies?

It was not a conscious move. I am basically led by 

my curiosity. With Babe, I got the taste of CG (computer generated) film-making. 

After the advent of sound, I think Computer Generated Imagery is the biggest advancement 

in cinema. I never intended to make an animation movie. Its just that when I 

decided to tell a story of the penguins, the only way to do it was through CG 

animation.

As a director, how different is it to helm a CG animation film as opposed to a 

live action film?

The biggest change is that everything takes a lot 

longer. You have to break down all the processes while making a CG film. In live 

action films, everything happens at the same time in one moment capturing the 

body movements, the facial expressions, recording the sound, the voices, the wardrobe, 

etc. In CG animation films, each one of those processes happens at a different 

time. That allows you to think a little bit more.

Most of the film-making process is done by instinct 

when you are in the throes of making. When you are doing animation, you have time 

to reflect and analyse your actions. You can think about camera movements, change 

it digitally if you like, think about the lighting, change the expressions on 

a characters face Animation film-making is like a painting you start with 

a sketch and then keep layering and layering it.

Do you think there is an overkill of animation films these days?

Yes, theres no question of that. After the success 

of Pixar and the Shrek films from Dreamworks, every major American studio 

and a lot of other studios around the world have realised that making animation 

films is a quick way to make a buck. So they are no longer unique. Animation movies 

are going to be like every other movie. Some are going to be good, some not so 

good.

But Happy Feet is the biggest animation film from Down Under

Yes it is in the sense it was done in Australia. 

But it was made with American money and the thousands of people who have worked 

on the film came from every country of the world. There were several people from 

India. The animators came from everywhere China, Iran, Israel, all over Europe, 

every state of North America. But the fact is Sydney is where I live and so the 

film is called Australian.

Why make a film on penguins in the first place?

I have always been intrigued by Antarctica because 

it is such an extraordinary landscape. And then about 10 years ago I saw the BBC 

documentary Life in the Freezer. It chronicled the natural history of the 

Emperor penguin in particular. When I saw the way they lived its only as a community 

that they survive such a harsh landscape. I just thought nature has written a 

great story there. Then I saw that they sing to each other with each one having 

a unique song and that is how they find their soul mates. And one of the penguins 

cant sing but he can dance and there I was in the middle of a musical! I never 

intended to make a musical but there I was. It all started with me realising how 

extraordinary creatures penguins are. 

Does the Oscar win by the documentary March of the Penguins help the prospects 

of Happy Feet?

Yes. We started making Happy Feet some time 

before the March of the Penguins. Warner Brothers, who were making Happy 

Feet, were aware how wonderful the penguins were. So when they saw March 

of the Penguins, they said ok, well take it up for distribution in North 

America. In a way it was very good for that film but what is good for us is that 

it did create awareness about the penguins.

What do all the familiar star voices in your film Robin Williams, Nicole Kidman, 

Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman bring on board?

It depends on the film. When we made the Babe movie, 

I wanted not to have stars because I didnt want people to look at a pig or a 

dog and say thats a famous actor talking. When it came to the penguins, because 

they all look so similar, I wanted the voices to be distinct and because the penguins 

in the film were representative in so many ways it is a fable about us basically 

 I wanted as many recognisable voices as possible. Also, the penguins differentiate 

themselves by voices and songs. So we did the same with stars.

Is Happy Feet made for the adult in a kid and the kid in an adult?

Thats the perfect way to put it. I would want an 

80-year-old to remember what it was like as a child. The purpose of every story, 

apart from the entertainment, is to have some nourishment. All the enduring stories 

in any culture are a way to learn how to live in this world and I think thats 

a value particularly for children who are still learning how to be in this world. 

Its through stories we confront the joys and sorrows of life, almost like a dress 

rehearsal. There has to be a sense of enchantment in the story to try and export 

the persons who are watching the story, to engage them.

While Happy Feet is coming to India in December, in the US, you are coming 

with Casino Royale

Yeah, it will be interesting to see whether James 

Bond stomps on the penguins or the penguins outdo James Bond! Nah, they are completely 

different films of different genres.

What are you making next after Happy Feet?

One thing I was able to do during the making of Happy 

Feet was to finish all the screenplays I have been writing for a long time. 

The next film I want to do is Digital Intermediate (DI) with real live actors. 

And after that I have another Mad Max film which I had postponed for Happy 

Feet. I dont want to get on to that straightaway, so after the DI film.

Have you been exposed to Indian cinema?

You cant help but see Indian movies. I think what 

India is doing so well is exporting its culture through cinema. Indian cinema 

has made a significant impact on world cinema Moulin Rouge was made in 

Sydney but has a whole Bollywood-inspired climax. In fact, the moment I finish 

the publicity tour of Happy Feet, my children and I are going and spending 

a month in India. I have always wanted to go there.

 What: 

 She Rocks, a music concert conceptualised by Oindrilla Dutt.

 Where: Tollygunge Club.

 When: April 7, evening.

 The show: She rocked, but did they? 

 A startled silence. That seemed to be the general reaction of the 400-strong audience watching the women rockers delivering Led Zeppelin, Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette and others. 

 And the singers seemed to have come prepared for that. What resulted was a short course on rock for those tuning in.

 Some singers stopped between songs to introduce the original singers and composers.

 Anjum had this to say about Janis Joplin: People think of her as someone wild and uncontrolled, yet few realise just how much control she actually had over her music? 

 Others like veteran rocker Jayashree of Skinny Alley conveyed the intricacies of rock and encouraged accompanying band Krosswindz at every beat.

 In fact, Tuki (guitar), Ratanjit (keyboard), Osi (bass), Rajiv (rhythm guitar and backing vocals) and Nigel (drums) were the ones to draw the first encores.

 Chandrani crooned One Hand In My Pocket, Free Man in Paris, Every Day Is A Winding Road and Zombie.

 Anjum in a black dress singing Move Over and A Little Piece of My Heart, Tall In The Saddle with lots of gusto got heads nodding to the beat.

 But it was left to Ananya to really draw out the cries of Go, Ananya, go! 

 When she sang Whats Up she really seemed to believe in getting a toehold and making her way up the hill of hope.

 As she obliged a request for Hey Jude, Ananya called on the audience to dance, but no one did. 

 Not even when her rich husky voice belted out Proud Mary and Its Been A Long Time Since.

 Jayashree concluded the show displaying technical finesse in her renditions of Tigers and Sex Kills, Justice.

 The show ended well past 10 pm with all four ladies getting together to sing John Lennons Imagine.

 Voiceover: It was a unique experience for us because we were singing together for the first time, something we had always wanted to do and the crowd did not disappoint, smiled Chandrani of Krosswindz.

 Holly tribute 

 What: The Hollywood Maidens on stage. 

 Where: Bengal Club.

 When: April 8, 7:30 pm.

 Take a look: It was a nostalgic evening for the ICFAI B-school boys and girls ? meeting old friends, catching up and recounting the past, having a musical blast and then digging into dinner.

 The event was carried forward by a musical performance conceived by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. Called Hollywood Maidens, the concert had performers Gopa Ghosh, Shalini Gupta and Paul Verma (from Australia) on the vocals and Jeff Menzez and Carlton Pereira on the keyboards.

 The concert kicked off with Rita Bhimani introducing the show as a step away from Bollywood to savour the excitement and effervescent beauty of the Hollywood belles.

 Shalini began with Yesterday Once More, her way of paying tribute to the nostalgic Calcuttan. Next, Gopa took the stage to set the mood for Hollywood Maidens.

 She belted out favourites like Somewhere Over The Rainbow, Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend, I Could Have Danced All Night, Pretty Woman... 

 The songs were a tribute to yesteryear stars like Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn, Mitzi Gaynor and current Hollywood queens Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson. A cheerful duet of The Lady Is A Tramp by Gopa and Paul and songs like Doe A Deer had audiences clapping and cheering.

 Voiceover: The evening is an effort to celebrate the completion of 10 years of this leading business school. The musical programme was a great entertainer, smiled Raghab Prasad Panda, manager, corporate and alumni relations, ICFAI.

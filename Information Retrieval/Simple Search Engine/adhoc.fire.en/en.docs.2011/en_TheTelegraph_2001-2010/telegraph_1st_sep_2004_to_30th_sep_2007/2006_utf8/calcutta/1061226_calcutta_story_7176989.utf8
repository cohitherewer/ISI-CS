 What: 

 Winter Carnival presented by The Telegraph.

 Where: City Centre. 

 When: December 22 to January 1. 

 The bash: The Salt Lake mall was all decked up to welcome the 11-day carnival with posters in the shops and a big Christmas tree in the atrium. On Friday, the front porch overlooking the mall was turned into the carnival venue. The youthful crowd was huge.

 As a live remix show by the Red FM team pepped up the mood, the RJs interacted with the crowd, giving away on-the-spot prizes to anyone with an all-red dress code and more. Soon, Santa Claus made a grand appearance amidst claps and whistles. Good ol Santa was in full form, entertaining the audience with jhatkas and matkas as foot-tapping music played in the background.

 Members from the crowd were called on stage to dance, give Christmas/New Year messages, and walk away with gifts.

 A kids event by Delhi Public School, New Town, involved quiz, game shows and performances. Carol singing added to the Christmas feel. Saturday and Sunday were all about spot quiz shows, game shows and auctions. 

 Santa Claus gave away chocolates and gifts to the children in the mall. From December 26 to 29, the mall will be home to an exhibition of paintings and sculptures. Artists on stage will paint through the day. 

 On December 31, Red FM will conduct Most Wanted live from City Centre. Also lined up is a musical performance by DJ Ritesh. A pipe band performance will usher in New Year. 

 Voiceover: This is the second year we are hosting a winter carnival, and it is on a bigger scale. Such events definitely help the crowd know our mall better, smiled Vivek Banerjee, marketing and events head, City Centre.

 Just for kids

 What: Dabur Chyawanprash Anandamela Carnival 2006.

 Where: Nicco Park.

 When: December 24 and 25.

 The bash: While competitive events like quiz, dumb charades, drama and dances were being held for schools, a number of games were also open to anyone walking in and taking a look. Hot favourites were Help Mummy, Tug-of-war, Basket-the-ball and family antakshari. Talent hunts like Shining Star turned the spotlight on would-be singing sensations, orators and even mental math whiz kids.

 My favourite was the dumb charades round where the participants explained the film Kuch Kuch Hota Hai using the clapping game played by Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, smiled Madhurima Mallick of Bidhannagar Government High School. Her friend Jayita Chakraborty noted how the quiz teams were named after her favourite Anandamela heroes Tenida, Tintin, Ghonada, Gablu and Feluda.

 The big draw was the shadowgraphy show by Amar-Sabyasachi on Day One and the musical performance by Babul Supriyo on Christmas evening.

 Voiceover: This fest was planned on a very large scale this time. It has drawn lots of children and their families to come spend their Christmas with us, smiled Paulami Sengupta Sarkar, editor Anandamela.

 Merry mood

 What: The Telegraph Christmas Carnival.

 Where: Space Circle.

 When: December 24 and 25.

 The bash: Snacks, Santa Claus, song and dance The Telegraph Christmas Carnival was a fun-filled mixed bag. The big lawn tennis court was converted into the carnival venue. Colourful balloon decor created the festive ambience.

 Santa moved around shaking hands and giving away Christmas goodies. Live cartoon characters Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse were a huge hit with the kids. 

 At one end were game stalls Hit the Noddy, Kill the Rat, Enter the Car, Bucket the Ball and Battle of the Beyblades. The more adventurous took pleasure in going through the Giant Air-Filled Caterpillar tunnel. Others were busy jumping on the Air Castle. Most kids also loved getting into dance mode, shaking to the tunes of DJ Nishit.

 The highlight was a Manipuri festival that showcased martial arts, dance, food, art and craft.

 Voiceover: The Manipuri festival adds to the culture quotient. The audience loved seeing the Manipuri dance spectacle and gorge on Manipuri specialities that they do not get to experience otherwise, smiled Suman Mukherjee, food and beverage manager, Space Circle.

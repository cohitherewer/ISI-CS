The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Theyve got the look, and how!

 Screen On amp; Off 

 We begin the last week of the year on a stylish note. The results of the Best of Bolly 2006 Poll are in, with the SMS count crossing the 1,000 mark. Hrithik Roshans cool quotient in D:2 has helped Anahita win the best designer of the year 

 Anahita Shroff Adajania wins the best film designer of the year in our year-end poll because of her fabulous work on Hrithik in Dhoom:2. And she wins with a whopping 52.5 per cent of votes. There rsquo;s not a single soul who rsquo;s seen the film and not gone raving about Mr A rsquo;s smashing look in the movie. Distressed is the key word if you look at Hrithik rsquo;s style statement in the film. The loose denims, the large glasses, the tanned skin tone, the out-of-bed hair... the man rsquo;s never looked better and Anahita should sure take a bow. While she did wonders with Aishwarya Rai and Bipasha Basu too, for the film, it is the Hrithik effect that did maximum damage for sure ldquo;

 It was a big challenge to recreate the Don magic since the original was a highly stylish film, rdquo; admitted Aki Narula who designed Shah Rukh Khan rsquo;s outfits for the Farhan Akhtar film. And he sure got it right as 14 per cent of the readers voted for him and placed him second on this list. ldquo;It was a tribute and so I borrowed the elements like paisleys and florals, the clove motif and played around with the tie, rdquo; Narula added. 

It was the big comeback of the year. Kajol faced the camera for Kunal Kohli rsquo;s Fanaa five years after she had danced around the pyramids for Karan Johar rsquo;s Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. And she didn rsquo;t disappoint. While her performance was predictably spot on, it was her look, designed by Manish Malhotra, that had everyone raving. In our poll, Kajol rsquo;s look has been chosen third with around 7 per cent votes. ldquo;She played a simple girl in the film and I couldn rsquo;t give her something grand and over the top, rdquo; said Manish. Staying true to the script, Manish gave Kajol a lot of fitted kurtis and flared long skirts. The embellishments were minimal and the silhouette clutter-free. The colours, though, were varied and Kajol flitted from pink to blue to white with equally effective ease 

Two Rani Mukherjees, one designed by Manish Malhotra for Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and the other designed by Sabyasachi Mukherjee for Baabul, were voted fourth and fifth respectively. The KANK Rani look was classy, chic and sophisticated, whether she was wearing those jackets and trousers or sporting saris. With Rani in Baabul, Sabyasachi made his first foray into mainstream Bollywood, retaining his signature prints, colours and textures, yet adding a dash of tinsel bling

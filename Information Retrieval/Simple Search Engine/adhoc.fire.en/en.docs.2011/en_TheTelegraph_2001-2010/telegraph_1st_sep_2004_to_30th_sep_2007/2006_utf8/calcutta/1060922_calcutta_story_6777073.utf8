 Currently, around 700 employees work at the facility at DLF IT Park in Rajarhat. It will accommodate 3,000 people once the set-up is fully staffed. 

 We have noted the chief ministers suggestion and we will approach him with a proposal, said Amitabh Roy, vice-president, consulting and application services, IBM India.

 The attrition rates here are one of the lowest in the countryWe have experienced rapid growth post PricewaterhouseCoopers and Daksh acquisition, said Shanker Annaswamy, managing director, IBM India.

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Rishyap

 Bordered by primitive forests 

 of pine and rhododendron, Rishyap is a captivating corner 

 of the eastern Himalayas. It is a quiet getaway tucked away 

 behind the mighty ranges. Being here is like being in the 

 lap of nature.

 Perched over the Neora valley at an altitude of 2,360 m, this hill station at the foot of Tiffin Dara comprises a Lepcha hamlet and a few resorts. The name is derived from the local language, in which ri means lofty and shyap means a forest with age-old trees.

 Kanchenjunga dominates the backdrop at Rishyap. The blue mountains of Sikkim by its side are also breathtaking. Nathu La and Jalep La are clearly visible from here. Sunset turns the snow-capped pinnacles into pink and gold.

 Rishyap is just four km from Lava by foot, and 12 km along the metalled road. Enjoying the serenity of the surroundings, strolling down the trail to Lava and enjoying cups of hot tea on the hotel lawn are some of the prime draws for tourists.

 Those with an interest in the flora and fauna will especially enjoy the trek to Lava. Bird-watchers flock here for sightings. Dawn is the best time to undertake the journey. One might encounter jungle cats, Himalayan black bears and red pandas on the way.

 An early dinner is the norm in Rishyap, but you can always venture out after the meal. Evening excursions would, however, be difficult in winter, when it is so biting cold that even the dew freezes on the grass.

 At night the sky is dazzling bright and clear. It?s as if the Milky Way is reflected in an aerial pool between the mountains. Far below, the lights twinkle in the towns and villages. The golden orb of the moon rises swiftly over the jungle of Rechi La, bathing the village in a bewitching light.

 Above the forests that encircle Tiffin Dara, there is a raised, cemented ground. From there you can see half of Sikkim sprawled at your feet, and Kanchenjunga standing tall and proud in front. 

 Southeast of Rishyap is the Lava monastery. Just where the motorable road sweeps into the hill station, there are a handful of resorts and houses. The village is further up the road, but down the slope. You have to walk to the village.

 Since the hill station is still not overrun by tourists, most residents depend on agriculture for a living. Maize and potato are cultivated on the slopes that have been carved into steps. Occasionally, one might come across apple and pear trees.

 An eco-tourism committee was 

 set up here so that the village could be properly developed. 

 Since then, more resorts have come up at Rishyap to cater 

 to the growing number of visitors.

 Going 

 From Siliguri, there are buses 

 to Lava and Kalimpong. You can hire a car to Rishyap from 

 either of these places. A trek from Lava is more enjoyable

 Staying 

 There are resorts to suit every 

 budget. Food is available at reasonable rates

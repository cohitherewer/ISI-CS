 Placement cloud over CU course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A much-publicised move by Calcutta University (CU) to start a training course for the recruits of Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) has set the campus on the boil.

 According to a section of the students, the memorandum of understanding (MoU) recently signed between the university and CTS to offer training to the company?s employees has jeopardised the careers of CU pass-outs. A number of IT companies have, apparently, stopped holding campus interviews for CU students following the MoU.

 ?Are the authorities aware of the attitude of other IT companies after signing the MoU with CTS?? the students asked in a questionnaire submitted to CU vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee recently. 

 ?We have information from reliable sources that many IT companies have declined to hold campus interviews after the MoU,? stated the students.

 In the questionnaire, the students also sought to know the reasons behind signing the MoU. ?There is immense confusion among the students concerning the MoU. The students should have been consulted before the authorities made the move,? said Santadeep Das, general secretary of the Rajabazar Science College. He is a member of the CPM?s students? wing Students? Federation of India.

 The MoU is ?of no use to students and they will not benefit in any way. The university authorities have not given us any assurance that the company would offer jobs to CU pass-outs?, pointed out a student. 

 The MoU was signed early this year as part of CU?s industry-university interaction. The training is meant exclusively for young engineers who are recruited by CTS through campus interviews in various engineering colleges in eastern India.

 The dissenting students have argued that the university need not have taken on an additional responsibility at a time when there is a shortage of teachers, non-teaching staff, space and laboratory facilities. ?Will the university earn extra revenue by running the course? If so, then how will the university spend this amount?? the students quizzed in the questionnaire.

 University registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay said the training course is currently being conducted. ?We are examining the grievances of students,? he added.

 Siddhartha Mukherjee, vice-president of the Asia-Pacific operations of CTS, said he was unaware of the students? protest.

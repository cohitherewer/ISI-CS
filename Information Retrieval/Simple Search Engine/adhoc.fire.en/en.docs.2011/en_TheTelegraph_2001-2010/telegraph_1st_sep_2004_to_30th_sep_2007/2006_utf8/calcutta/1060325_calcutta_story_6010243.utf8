The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Selling fish, playing fairy

 RESHMI SENGUPTA

 Tapan Das: Stage-crazy

 Reaching Sealdah market at 4 in the morning to fetch his daily share of rohu and bekti, selling them in the Khardah market, wrapping up by noon and heading straight for his rehearsals.

 That used to be a day in the life of Tapan Das till last winter. This summer, the fisherman with a passion for theatre will be making his way not to Sealdah, but to Swan theatre at Stratford-on-Avon.

 And not as a fishmonger, but as a fairy. For that?s the role assigned by British theatre director Tim Supple, who chanced upon Tapan late last year while talent-spotting for A Midsummer Night?s Dream.

 The cross-cultural Indo-UK production commissioned by the British Council will tour the four metros before being staged mid-June at Swan theatre as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company?s The Complete Works of Shakespeare Festival. 

 For Tapan, who has studied till Class IX and ?never liked Shakespeare much? from the little he had seen on the Calcutta stage, this truly is a dream ? a midsummer one at that. ?Ekhon Shakespeare darun laage... (I now love Shakespeare). His work is fun and serious at the same time,? smiles the 33-year-old, who had to play Puck and Demetrius during the auditions.

 A far cry from the years spent in the slums along the railway line in Khardah, getting involved in the satta racket, dropping out of school and idolising Mithun Chakraborty. The turning point was meeting Prabir Guha of Alternative Living Theatre and being drawn to the stage. From then, it was all about fish and a few roles. Till Shakespeare made an entry.

 ?The students made a request, and I felt we should listen to them. They begged and pleaded, so I thought about it and decided in their favour. I wanted them to know that their requests are taken seriously,? smiled Reeta Chatterjee, principal of Apeejay School, Park Street. 

 So, Monday is a holiday in the school, because of the World Cup final on Sunday night.

 She added that the teachers are happy, too, and so is she. ?There will be no bleary-eyed teachers and students in school on Monday. And I?m looking forward to the match as well.?

 The St Xavier?s Collegiate School authorities caved in to repeated requests from students and declared a holiday on Monday. ?They didn?t want to give us a holiday, because the fest is coming up. But the boys kept pleading with Father and he finally gave in,? said Class XI student Tanmoy Das Lala.

 St Joseph?s has declared a holiday, while La Martiniere for Boys has compromised, opening school a couple of hours late, at 10 am.

 Don Bosco Park Circus, too, has a holiday on Monday. While the authorities say it is because the school fest ends on Sunday, it?s the perfect opportunity for students and staff to catch the Cup match without worrying about the morning after. But Thursday will be a working day.

 And so, Calcutta stays up and cheering on Sunday night to catch the Cup final on television.

 For a few lucky ones who got to see the real thing, it was an unforgettable experience. Deepankar Nandi went to Germany on an 11-day soccer pilgrimage with tickets for five matches. He ended up watching seven. The most memorable moment was shaking hands with football legend Franz Beckenbauer. ?He was so friendly and approachable. I told him this was the best World Cup, amazingly well-organised. He smiled, shook hands and signed my match ticket. It was a wonderful experience,? recalled the CEO of CC amp;FC. 

 Thanks to Peter Velappan, secretary of the Asian Football Confederation, Nandi and friend Amit Sen got VIP passes for two matches in Hamburg. During one game, the two were overwhelmed to be seated near Beckenbauer, Lennart Johansson and Sepp Blatter.

 For Selvel man Noomi Mehta and son Jahan, going to Germany was ?worth every penny?. ?It was one giant party. What politicians couldn?t do, the beautiful game did ? uniting the world. The fans are the real heroes of this World Cup. There was plenty of passion and fervour, but no hooliganism or rowdiness. It was a celebration of soccer,? summed up Noomi.

Heavy rain lashed the city and its adjoining areas for more than an hour, throwing traffic out of gear on Tuesday evening.

 Officials at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore predicted more rain in the next 48 hours.

 Met officials said an already-active monsoon current was further strengthened following development of a low-pressure area over Bangladesh and adjoining Gangetic West Bengal.

 ?The monsoon over Gangetic West Bengal is now vigorous. We have issued a warning for heavy rains in Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal for Wednesday and are expecting more rains in the next few days,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Met office. The rainfall on Tuesday was more intense in the southern parts of the city, he added.

 The downpour that started before 6 pm in north Calcutta and a little later in the south, left many arterial roads waterlogged, bringing evening traffic to a halt. 

 The evening rainfall was pegged at 57.6 mm.

 Arterial roads like BB Ganguly Street, Amherst Street, Bidhan Sarani, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Ganesh Chandra Avenue, College Street and a few stretches in BBD Bag and on CR Avenue were under knee-deep water.

 Waterlogging was also reported in parts of Kidderpore, Chetla, Southern Avenue, Lake Road, Dhakuria, Ballygunge, Bondel Road, Picnic Garden, Palm Avenue, Sealdah, Narkeldanga, Maniktala, Ultadanga, Bagbazar, Paikpara, Chitpur, Cossipore and Sector V in Salt Lake. 

 ?This was the highest rainfall recorded in a day in the city this year. The city?s present drainage capacity is 6 mm per hour. So, it will take about six to seven hours for the water to recede in the low- lying areas,? said S.R. Samanta, special officer, transport infrastructure department, Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 Train services were also affected. Eastern Railway officials said tracks were submerged in both Howrah and Sealdah divisions, causing failure in signalling system. Local trains ran late.

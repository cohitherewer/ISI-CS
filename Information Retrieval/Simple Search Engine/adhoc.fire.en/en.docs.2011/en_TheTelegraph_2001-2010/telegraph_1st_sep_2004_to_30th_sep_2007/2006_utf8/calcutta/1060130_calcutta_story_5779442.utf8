The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Suburban trains halt at stations only for 30 to 35 seconds. This does not allow 

commuters enough time to get off or board the crowded EMUs during office hours, 

especially with vendors often blocking the entrances. Why isn?t it possible to 

stop the trains for at least a minute at each station?

 On January 12 evening, there was a four-hour power cut in Dum Dum Park and 

its adjoining areas. Four power cuts of shorter durations followed at night. Fans, 

air-coolers and airconditioners are seldom used in winter, considerably lowering 

the power-consumption. Hence, power cuts in January are difficult to fathom.

Dum Dum Park. 

 With Saraswati puja knocking on the door, ordinary people are once again being 

milked for puja subscription. Some puja organisers are even stopping vehicles 

to collect the subscriptions, caring little for mishaps or snarls. Victims pay 

up for fear of harassment. Will the police remain mute spectators? 

 Govinda Bakshi,

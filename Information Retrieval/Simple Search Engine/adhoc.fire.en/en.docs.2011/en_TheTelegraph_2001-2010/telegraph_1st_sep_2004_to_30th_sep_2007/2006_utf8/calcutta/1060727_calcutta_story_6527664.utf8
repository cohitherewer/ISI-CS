Life

 Customised is cool

 Baby's Day 

 Out

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 For gulping annoying doses of 

 milk, that Superman mug is a must; nothing but a Tweety 

 T-shirt at tuitions; parties or playtime, the Tom and Jerry 

 timepiece enjoys permanent settlement on the little wrist. 

 Accessories, clothes or stationery, toons and animation 

 heroes are an integral part of a childs life today.

 While the stores and malls are 

 flooded with Krrish, Superman and Barbie merchandise, 

 for customised goodies featuring your childs fancies, 

 a visit to Personalized Funda in Forum would be a good bet.

 The tiny stall on the third floor, 

 beside Toy Planet, doles out printed images on anything 

 and everything that your kid ever wanted ? mugs, tees, clocks, 

 mouse-pads, cushions, key-rings and much more. Not just 

 toon motifs, you can surprise your little one by flashing 

 his/her cutest photograph on any object.

 From Rs 50 to Rs 20,000, prices 

 vary according to the size and item chosen.

 Birthday, festival or any 

 other occasion, these printed articles with a touch of innovation 

 serve as great gift items. Currently we are getting a lot 

 of orders for Rakhi, says Vinay Dalmia from Personalized 

 Funda.

 A process called sublimation 

 is used to transfer ink to the product. Hi-tech gadgets 

 like mug press and flat press have been imported from Singapore. 

 To incorporate photo prints, all you require is a snap, 

 explains Vinay. 

 Once the illustration is chosen 

 from the catalogue or the photo is submitted, your takeaway 

 tee or mug is ready within 15 to 20 minutes.

 Spiderman fans can replace their 

 heros face with their own inside a Spiderman mask 

 on a mug. Little girls can share tee space with style icon 

 Barbie. They can also choose from Winnie the Pooh, Mowgli, 

 Noddy and good ol Santa.

 The slightly older ones have the 

 option of placing a thoughtful picture of themselves surrounded 

 by cool cars or hot heroines. The words below read Just 

 a minute mom, Im trying to make a choice here!

 There are cool photo frames with 

 catchy captions where you can put in your photographs with 

 friends, with ribbons and cartoon characters as add-ons.

 You can also customise home decor 

 items with your childs snaps. Be it tiles, cushion 

 covers or clocks, your childs face or pictures of 

 family vacations or birthday parties can be splashed around.

 Theres a whole lot on offer 

 for Rakhi. Brothers can pamper sisters by giving them an 

 opportunity to pose with John Abraham, no less.

 German stamp for B-school

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) is set to be the first Indian B-school to earn a German accreditation. 

 A three-member committee of Foundation for International Business Administration (FIBAA) is currently assessing the facilities of the country?s oldest management institute. The panel is expected to present its final findings by September.

 ?We have examined the syllabus, administration support functions, faculty and student responses. In total, 120 criterion have to be satisfied before an institute is accredited,? said Daisuke Motoki, head of the German committee. 

 The ?dedicated faculty? and ?highly motivated? students of IISWBM have created an impression on the panel, added Motoki.

 A two-year, part-time MBA in international management consulting, in collaboration with International Institute for Management Consulting (I-IMC), Ludwigshafen University of Applied Sciences, will be started at IISWBM if the FIBAA report is favourable.

 The course is aimed at students with full-time work experience. On completion of the course, the students will be allowed to work in Germany without a work permit.

 ?The programme has been divided into four semesters, of which the students will have to spend the final two in Germany. They can work there without a permit to recover the educational expenses. The programme has been structured to allow students to work and study at the same time,? said Ashoke K. Dutta, director, IISWBM.

 The programme is expected to be launched in December. The pilot batch will consist of about 25 students. The tuition fee will be about 5,600 Euros (approximately Rs 3.5 lakh).

 ?The degree will be awarded by Ludwigshafen University and presented jointly by IISWBM and I-IMC. This is a need-based programme for professionals without an MBA degree or diploma,? explained Datta.

 IISWBM will conduct an admission test for the programme, followed by personal interviews in September.

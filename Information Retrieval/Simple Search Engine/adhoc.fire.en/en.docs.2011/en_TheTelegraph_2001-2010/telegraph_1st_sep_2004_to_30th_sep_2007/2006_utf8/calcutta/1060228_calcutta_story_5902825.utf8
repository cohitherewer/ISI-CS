 Palmtops to slap notices in a jiffy

 - Traffic rule offences will be notified in 48 hours

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Motorists will not have to rack their brains any longer to recall what traffic rule they had violated two months ago. Traffic police will notify them within 48 hours of committing an offence.

 In a bid to clear motorists? confusion, the city police authorities are going to make the process of sending compound letters faster, unlike the present practice of informing a traffic rule violator two months after his offence was detected by a traffic policeman.

 As part of making the process faster, the authorities will provide palmtops to 200 traffic sergeants. ?This measure is going to be initiated against those who violate traffic norms and escape. To date, we take at least two months to write to the offenders from the traffic department of Lalbazar police headquarters. As a result, most of the offenders forget what rule they had violated and refuse to accept the charges, countering that they had not travelled on a particular stretch on the date and time mentioned in the letter,? said Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner of police (administration). 

 Singh claimed that once the new system is in place, there will be no room for confusion. ?Motorists will not have the excuse that they have forgotten the incident. We will inform them within 48 hours of their committing the offence,? he stated.

 Elaborating on how two months will be reduced to 48 hours, Singh, said: ?If a traffic sergeant notices you speeding away after violating rules, he will promptly store information like the number of the car, place of occurrence, date and time of the offence in his palmtop.?

 The sergeant will reach the traffic guard office concerned and transfer the data to a computer linked with the police department?s central server. ?There will be a printer linked with the computer. The printout of a compound letter will come out within a minute and it will be posted the next day. The violator will receive it within two days of committing his offence,? said an officer of traffic department.

 Singh said in the first phase, of the 280 traffic sergeants, 200 will be provided palmtops. ?The rest will be equipped as soon as possible,? he stated, adding: ?Apart from carrying palmtops, sergeants will also be given a portable printer that will be connected with the palmtop. If an offender is caught on the spot, he will be issued a compound slip within seconds. Now, issuing a letter on the spot takes at least 10 minutes, as the officers have to fill up a lengthy format manually.?

 Motorists will be able use their debit or credit cards to pay the penalty for violating norms in the near future.

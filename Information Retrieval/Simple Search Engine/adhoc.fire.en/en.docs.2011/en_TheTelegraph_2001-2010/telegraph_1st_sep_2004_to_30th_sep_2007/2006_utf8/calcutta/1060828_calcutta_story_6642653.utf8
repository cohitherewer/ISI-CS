The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safety screen around mosque 

 - Countrywide terror alert sparks precautionary measure

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The terror alert across the country has put a 40-year-old mosque on the Calcutta Port Trust premises out of bounds for outsiders.

 The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is in charge of security at the countrys oldest port, has prohibited entry of outsiders into the compound citing safety concerns. 

 Security measures in all ports in India have been tightened in the wake of terrorist attacks. We, too, have restricted entry of outsiders into the premises. That is why outsiders can no longer offer prayers at the mosque. Port employees, however, are free to visit the mosque, Anup Chanda, chairman, Calcutta Port Trust, told Metro. 

 Therefore, only a handful are offering prayers in the mosque on Fridays. We did allow some outsiders, but not everyone, stated Chanda. 

 Till a few years ago, the mosque was open to outsiders for 24 hours. Recently, the port authorities decided to allow outsiders to visit the mosque only for Friday prayers. 

 The clampdown on outsiders followed soon. The move has not gone down well with members of the minority community. The matter has even reached the chief ministers office. 

 In a bid to resolve the issue, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked West Bengal Minorities Commission chairman Syed Sajjad Zaher Adnan to visit the port area and hold meetings with the security agencies and local residents. 

 I requested the authorities to allow outsiders to offer namaaz by providing elaborate security arrangements. But they are defending the decision, saying that the security of the port is a serious matter and the government cannot pressure them regarding this, said the commission chairman. 

 An official of the state minority affairs department stated that efforts are on to work out a solution. 

 The chief minister has discussed the issue with Calcutta Police and also directed the minorities commission chairman to sort out the problem without compromising on security, revealed the official, on condition of anonymity. 

 The proposal doing the rounds is to adopt a model similar to the one at the airport, where the CISF has issued special passes to members of the minority community for visiting the mosque on the premises and offer namaaz. 

 But as far as the port mosque is concerned, the CISF doesnt have any plan to tone down security measures, introduced after the serial blasts in Mumbai and bolstered following the terror alert across the country. 

 Allowing outsiders entry into the port premises can be risky. We do not want to take any chances and are trying to explain our stand to members of the minority community, said a CISF official.

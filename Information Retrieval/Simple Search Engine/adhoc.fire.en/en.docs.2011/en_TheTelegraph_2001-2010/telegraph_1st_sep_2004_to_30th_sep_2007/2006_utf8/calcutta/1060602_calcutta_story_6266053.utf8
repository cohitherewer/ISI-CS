 Justice denied: 

 The Sinha family. (Below) The home they lost to the 

 hooligans 

 The report ?Poll assault on campus?, April 29, highlights 

 the carelessness, irresponsibility and incompetence shown 

 by the poll officials in cleaning a seat of learning after 

 Assembly polls. 

 The photograph along with the 

 report showed a large number of cardboard boxes, papers 

 and food packets strewn on the BT Road campus of Rabindra 

 Bharati University. A signboard asking people to keep the 

 compound clean has been dumped among the garbage. 

 From the photograph it is apparent that the polling officer concerned has failed in his duty to keep the campus clean to enable classes to resume as soon as the election is over. Such lackadaisical attitude should not be condoned. 

 In future, the education institutions should charge a hefty amount to allow elections to be held on the campus. Otherwise, the Election Commission should take the responsibility of keeping the campus clean. Failure to do so must attract a penalty. 

 The incident is perhaps indicative of the fact that most of us do not care about keeping our surroundings clean. There should be large bins in every election booth. The poll officials should be provided a guideline on ways to keep booths clean. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum. 

 The report ?Crime free, citizens cower?, May 5, shows the arrogance of the leaders in the lower echelons of CPM. The spineless administration, too, is untroubled by any sense of duty or prick of conscience. Normally violence of the kind faced by Saraswati Sinha goes unreported, but the lady had the guts to stand her ground. 

 The public outrage did not shake the sloth out of the guardians of law and order. The defiance shown by Swapan Saha and his cohorts is not unheard of. But that a puny leader like him could not be disciplined by the party proved the erosion of its authority. It is time for CPM to consider why police cannot restrain such desperados and people at the highest levels have to get involved to bring them to book. 

 P.K. Bhattacharjee,

 Address not given. 

 The real face of the CPM has been 

 exposed once again (?Family forced to flee home?, May 2 quot;). 

 However hard Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tries to control the 

 party cadres, he can?t. Three decades of uninterrupted power 

 has created hooligans. The pity is that these unruly elements 

 are patronised by the chief minister?s colleagues. It will 

 not be surprising to find that Swapan Saha is an aide of 

 Subhas Chakraborty, Tarit Topdar or Amitabha Nandy. 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street. 

 The role of police in the assault 

 on a family by a CPM councillor and the ransacking of their 

 house is shameful. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report ?Terror team 

 in net?, May 4, the assault on the Sinha family proves the 

 ruling party has abandoned all ideological considerations 

 and the law and order situation in the state is in ruins. 

 There aren?t words strong enough to condemn the incident. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur.

 The assault on the Sinha family 

 makes us wonder whether we are living in a civilised society 

 or not. Human rights have become playthings in the hands 

 of politicians. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata. 

 That CPM leaders can get away 

 with almost anything is obvious from the Dum Dum incident. 

 How long this will continue is anybody?s guess. 

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park. 

 The report ?Art teacher was rickshaw-puller?, May 1, was inspiring. Those who are talented yet lack the scope to hone their skills should draw hope from Biswanath Nag?s life. His passion and perseverance sets him apart from the crowd. 

 Arindam Basu, 

 Birati. 

 Apropos the report ?Band helps doctors unwind, connect?, May 5, the medicos can strike a rapport with patients through music. May be they can donate the money earned through music to charity. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 It is heartening that the civic body has found a humane way to capture stray dogs (?Lasso to check canine count?, May 2). The sterilisation programme needs a boost given the rate at which the canine population is rising. 

 Abhijit Chakraborty,

 Howrah. 

 Apropos the report ?Centre for lonely children?, May 1, kudos to the NGO for giving some unfortunate kids a lease of life. The government should work to ending child labour. 

 Anil Kumar Sen,

 RC Chatterjee Lane.

 Car blare can deafen kids 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The blare of horns and snarling traffic around schools affect a child?s attention span and concentration power, and can even induce hearing disability in them.

 This is clear from preliminary findings of the study Effect of Traffic Noise on Hearing Ability of School Children in Calcutta, conducted by researchers from Indian Statistical Institute (ISI). 

 In all, 1,070 Class IX students from 12 schools across Calcutta were studied between August 2004 and March 2005. Around 400 were short-listed for a second study.

 ?The results show that 25 per cent of the students are in the high-risk category,? said Somnath Mukherjee, audiologist and speech language pathologist at Peerless Hospital and Woodlands, who assisted the study.

 ?Which means, their ability to hear high-frequency sound is already affected. About 40 to 45 per cent of those studying in high-noise neighbourhoods were similarly affected,? he added.

 Students were selected from three kinds of schools. Five schools were selected from high-noise zones, like BT Road, Shyambazar, Surya Sen Street and Rashbehari Avenue; five from medium-noise zones, like Bagbazar, Sealdah and Southern Avenue; and two from Salt Lake, a low-noise zone.

 ?We wanted to see if different noise levels affect children differently,? explained Anup Dewanji, of ISI?s Applied Statistics Unit, who spearheaded the study. 

 Dewanji was assisted by a team of audiologists and experts from National Institute for Hearing Handicapped, and also from ISI?s faculty of psychometry.

 The team first visited the schools and conducted attention span tests on 1,070 Class IX students.

 ?It was clear that students studying in noisier schools had trouble concentrating over a period of 30 minutes. For the next round, we shortlisted around 400 children, who have studying in a particular school for the past seven years,? said Dewanji.

 Twelve children had demonstrated complete hearing loss, but they were excluded from the second test as the researchers were looking only for noise-induced hearing problems.

 The 400-odd children were brought to ISI and subjected to pure-tone audiometry tests and TTS (Temporary Threshold Shift) tests to check the range of sound frequencies they can hear. The tests revealed that 105 had trouble hearing high-frequency sound.

 ?This means that their inner and outer hair cells in the inner ear have started getting damaged. For them, hearing loss is likely to set in by the time they are 30-35. As shown by their speech discrimination score, these children are also likely to miss out syllables from what they hear,? said audiologist Mukherjee.

 The intensity of the disability, he said, would depend on the length and levels of noise exposure, their health and genetic background.

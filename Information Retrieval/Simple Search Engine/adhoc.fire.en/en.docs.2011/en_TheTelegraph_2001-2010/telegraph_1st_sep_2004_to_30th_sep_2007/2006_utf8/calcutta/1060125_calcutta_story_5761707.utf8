 Jazz biggies play to step up AIDS fight

 - FRIDAY MELODY BLOCKBUSTER

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Close on the heels of the eclectic spread at the Congo Square Jazzfest 2006, with its sprinkling of Latino and French fare, comes another big-bang jazz show this Friday, with the Americans calling the tune this time.

 The BET (Black Entertainment Television) and Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz artists ? Kenny Garrett (alto sax), Nicholas Payton (trumpet), Lisa Henry (vocals), Ronald Brunner (drums), Kristopher Funn (bass) and Carlos McKinney (piano) ? will perform at the Dalhousie Institute on Friday, (January 27, 7.30 pm).

 Hosted by the American Center, under funding from the US state department, the blockbuster concert is being presented in collaboration with jazz support group Congo Square. The US group?s tour of India is to emphasise the efforts of Indians and Americans working together against HIV/AIDS.

 The BET ensemble, the first and only 24-hour television programming service in the US, is dedicated to jazz music and culture. The Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz is a non-profit education organisation established in memory of the legendary jazz pianist and composer.

 While in town, the BET musicians will give a master class at the American Center for musicians and students, and meet with jazz-lovers and media representatives. They will also visit local facilities with HIV/AIDS programmes. 

 Saxophonist and multi-Grammy nominee Kenny Garrett will clearly be the cynosure at Friday?s show. Described by Billboard magazine as ?one of music?s most dynamic and adventurous players?, he has performed alongside jazz icons like Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Woody Shaw, Sting and Peter Gabriel.

 Trumpeter Nicholas Payton, prominent among the ?young lions of jazz?, was born and raised in New Orleans, where jazz resounds regularly from the streets and clubs. 

 Observers have noted that Payton?s musical style, as well as his looks conjure memories of the legendary Louis Armstrong.

 Vocalist Lisa Henry has been described as ?a winner at home and abroad?. Her showing at the 1994 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in Washington DC?s prestigious Kennedy Center, earned her the ?Jazz Ambassador? award.

 ?At the end of the tour, everyone ? jazz aficionados included ? will surely feel convinced to join the global campaign on HIV/AIDS. All of us, from the artists in the US, to members of the network of people afflicted with the disease, the corporate sector, the government and NGOs must lend support and make the mission a true example of public-private partnership effort,? says American Center director Susan M. Shultz.

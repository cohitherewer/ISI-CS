 Lottery debt to cell swipe

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA

 What brought fortune to one, landed another behind bars.

 The online lottery made Jay Prakash Jaiswal richer by more than Rs 15 crore, but pushed Nitai Ghosh, a courier firm employee, into a debt trap that forced him to steal mobile phones in bulk to pay back his dues.

 Nitai, a Dum Dum resident, and eight others were arrested late on Wednesday, after police used a sophisticated cellphone-tracing technique to locate the users of the stolen phones. Nitai has reportedly confessed to the crime.

 Among those held was Babloo, owner of the lottery outlet in Dum Dum, from where Nitai used to buy tickets. It was Babloo who instigated Nitai to steal the phones, realising he could otherwise never clear his dues.

 Nitai used to play the online lottery regularly and mounted a debt. Babloo was pressing him for the money, but Nitai was in no position to pay back. Babloo knew Nitai handled consignments of mobile phones on behalf of his courier firm at the airport and prodded him to steal a few handsets, said an investigating officer.

 Nitai handed over 20 cellphones to Babloo, half of what he had stolen, and also paid him Rs 20,000.

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said Nitai stole the phones from a consignment that his courier firm had brought to Calcutta from Delhi.

 When the local agent of the company that sent the consignment went to the airport to receive it, he found 40 phones missing. He lodged a complaint with NSC Bose Airport police station and we launched an investigation, said the superintendent.

 A group of officers is trying to recover the stolen sets, said Kumar.

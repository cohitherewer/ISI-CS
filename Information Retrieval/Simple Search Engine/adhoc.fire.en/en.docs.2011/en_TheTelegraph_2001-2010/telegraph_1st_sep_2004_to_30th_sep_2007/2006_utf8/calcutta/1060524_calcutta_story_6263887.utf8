The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Probably, the Calcutta pavements were made for the hawkers 

 and not for the pedestrians. Before the Assembly elections, 

 in an attempt to win the vote bank, the politicians had 

 promised that the hawkers won?t be evicted until the Left 

 government resettles them. But what about pedestrians like 

 us? Is there any solution to this decade-old problem of 

 encroachment on pavements?

 P. Pramanik, Santoshpur Avenue. 

 Of late, I have noticed that private buses and other heavy 

 vehicles, like trucks and Matadors, are plying on Nalini 

 Ranjan Avenue in New Alipore. There are four schools on 

 the same road. But despite this, I have never seen any traffic 

 sergeants in this area, even during the peak hours. I request 

 the traffic department to take adequate steps.

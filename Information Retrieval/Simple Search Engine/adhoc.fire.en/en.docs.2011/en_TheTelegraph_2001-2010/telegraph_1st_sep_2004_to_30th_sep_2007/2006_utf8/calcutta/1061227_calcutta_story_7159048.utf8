The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flagship cord blood facility

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Calcutta will have the countrys first AABB-standard cord blood banking facility, with full processing and cryogenic storage capabilities to preserve at least 40,000 cords, by the second quarter of 2007.

 The greenfield project, being set up by CordLife Sciences (India) Private Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore-based cell-therapy major CyGenics Limited, will come up on Diamond Harbour Road, about five minutes drive from IIM Calcutta.

 Calcutta will be our flagship referral point in cord blood banking and hence, the centre here will be the groups showpiece facility, at least four times the size of Camden Medical Center (CordLifes Singapore facility), with scalability to grow three-fold, Jeremy Yee, managing director and CEO, CordLife, told Metro.

 Yee was in town with his team of top-level officials for internal strategy meetings to put on track the groups quest for strategic scientific collaborators in India. 

 We want to study the demographics and disease pattern, with special reference to West Bengal and the East, said Jonathan Liau, executive, business development, Cygenics.

 CordLifes announcement of its Calcutta roadmap a value addition expected to propel the city towards the mainstream of stem-cell therapy comes in the wake of a major feather in the groups cap, which has placed it on an equal tech-excellence plane as Encore Software, Google and Napster.

 CyGenics was recently awarded the prestigious Technology Pioneer status by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum for advancing the field of adult stem cell cellular therapy, cord blood banking and technologies.

 The rare recognition was accorded to 47 companies worldwide from a pool of 225 nominees and CyGenics is one of only three companies in Asia to be awarded, said Simon Hoo, corporate finance amp; business analyst, Cygenics.

 Technology Pioneers are companies from around the world that develop and apply the most innovative and transformational technologies in the fields of cord blood banking, information technology, renewable energy and healthcare.

 This award is another validation of our efforts in this new and exciting field of adult stem cell regenerative medicine. It is also recognition of the achievements of the company in advancing cell therapy through its AABB-accredited cord blood banking services and the out-licensing of key technologies to select institutions for clinical use, said CyGenics Group CEO Steven Fang.

 The benefits of the groups R amp;D efforts and its key technologies will be manifest in the city soon after the Calcutta facility starts rolling, Yee promised.

 We look at ourselves as equity partners in the development of healthcare in India, and Calcutta will be our nerve centre, he stressed.

 40-plus and stroke-prone

 KINSUK BASU

 Hypertension, obesity, diabetes and stress. A survey by Bangur Institute of Neurology has zeroed in on these four factors being responsible for most neuro-ailments, including stroke, in the citys 40-plus population.

 The study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in August has also revealed that people in the 40-49 age group are more susceptible to stroke than those in the 60-69 age group.

 In 1990-93, the prevalence of stroke was 150-200 per 100,000 people. A decade later, the figure has shot up to around 624, said Shyamal Kanti Das, of Bangur Institute. Most of us fail to realise how erratic lifestyle in the 40s takes its toll in the 60s.

 Rattled at the findings, the Indian Council of Medical Research has set up a team of experts to study the prevalence of stroke among Calcuttans. The three-year project will focus on the long-term impact of stroke on patients and the suffering of their families, among other factors.

 This will be the first official survey exclusively on the incidence of stroke in an urban population group, said Bangur director Trishit Roy.

 Our team of field workers will collect data by visiting houses in all wards twice a year. The data will be analysed by experts at Indian Statistical Institute, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, National Neuroscience Centre and Medical College and Hospital, he added.

 Studies so far suggest diabetics are twice more prone to stroke than non-diabetics and those suffering from hypertension are 10-20 times more susceptible than those not suffering from the disorder. Women with hypertension seem to be most susceptible.

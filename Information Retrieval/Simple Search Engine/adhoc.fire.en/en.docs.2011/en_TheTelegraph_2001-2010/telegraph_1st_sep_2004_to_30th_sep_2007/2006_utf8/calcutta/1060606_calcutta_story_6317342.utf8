 Matondkar on Boogie Woogie

 Come Friday and the small screen?s favourite dance show is returning with a bang. Only this time Boogie Woogie will be a one-hour extravaganza on Sony, replacing Fear Factor on Fridays at 9 pm. And if there are doubts as to how big the new avatar is going to be, well, Urmila Matondkar will be the celebrity guest on Episode One and no, she will not be sitting still.

 ?We tried Kaboom on STAR in the middle, but Boogie Woogie is the real thing,? one of the producers Naved Jafferi, who also hosts the show along with brother Jaaved and friend Ravi Behl, tells Metro. ?Now it becoming one hour, it will be bigger and better for sure. We haven?t changed the popular format much and people will get to enjoy the same ol? show.?

 Apart from Urmila, some of the other stars to make an appearance on the new Boogie Woogie would be Himesh Reshammiya, Sajid Khan and Helen. ?Also, like before we will have separate specials, like housewives and children and even families,? reveals Naved.

 What?s more, if the second innings of the show goes well, Boogie Woogie may even go international in the near future.

 After Supriya Pilgaonkar ? actor-director Sachin?s wife and Nach Baliye partner ? raked in the highest ever prize money on Heart Beat ? Dil Thhaam ke Khelo last week, the STAR One show is rising on the popularity scales. This week will see noted cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle (till Tuesday), actress Ratna Pathak Shah (Tuesday and Wednesday) and TV actor Rajeev Paul (Wednesday and Thursday) pacing their heartbeats trying to find answers to the multiple-choice questions on the show, produced by Siddhartha Basu.

 Catch the familiar faces hooked on to their heartbeats on STAR One weeknights till Thurday at 9.30 pm.

 After topping every TRP chart for the last 12 months, STAR Ananda, the country?s first 24-hour Bengali news channel, celebrates its first anniversary. Both viewer response and market-share suggest that STAR Ananda has been able to introduce a paradigm shift in the broadcast of regional language news on the foundation of viewer relevance and trail-blazing leadership. 

 Says Uday Shankar, CEO and editor of Media Content and Communications Services India, which runs STAR News and STAR Ananda: ?Last year with STAR Ananda we offered to the viewers of Bengal a news channel that does justice to their news needs and requirements. The response has been overwhelming from the people of Bengal. But more importantly, the channel has gone to create a new benchmark and standard in language news broadcasting.?

 Leading the Bengali television news space currently with close to 60 per cent market-share and a recent milestone reach of 34,14,000 with a whopping 138 per cent growth in West Bengal since its launch, the channel has also pulled its weight with general entertainment channels. 

 On Counting Day in the recently concluded Assembly elections viewers ?voted? for STAR Ananda as the undisputed numero uno TV channel in ?any category? in the city with a 30 per cent marketshare, ahead of ETV Bangla and Aakaash Bangla. On the important parameter of ?time spent? too, STAR Ananda emerged at the top of the list at 54 minutes, ahead of ETV Bangla, thus consolidating a fast-building legacy.

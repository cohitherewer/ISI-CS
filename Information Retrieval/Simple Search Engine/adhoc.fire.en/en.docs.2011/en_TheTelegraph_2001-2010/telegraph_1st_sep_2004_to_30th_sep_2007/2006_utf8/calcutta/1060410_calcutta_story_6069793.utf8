From the most expensive of moisturisers and body lotions 

to spending hours in parlours and spas, there is simply no end to the pampering 

that your skin needs for it to glow.

 With the summer sun beating down, your skin cries for that extra care this season. But the secret to keep yourself shining through could be doing what comes naturally.

 Going organic seems to be the order of the day for celebrities like Madonna, Elizabeth Hurley and Alicia Silverstone and for wellness gurus like Deepak Chopra.

 GoodLife takes a look at the latest range of organic skin care treatments available near you and the wonders it can work on your skin.

 Product pick

 The one thing thats fast making organic products the choice of many is the all-natural base without the use of any synthetic chemicals.

 Herbal products are a balanced mix of natural elements as well as chemicals. But when it comes to organic products, the ingredients are all natural. With people having rediscovered the benefits of using natural products, organic products are fast becoming the popular choice of many, says Carol Ann of Solace.

 For instance, the Eminence range of products launched at the Solace spa (4, Sunny Park), brings together high-quality Hungarian ingredients with an old-world knowledge of herbs and fruits. 

 This skin care line offers a truly exquisite experience with products that are so natural that one can see the fresh fruit pulps, seeds and also smell the real herbs. The products are all handmade in Budapest with no mass production and without any heating or hydrogenating process. To preserve their naturalness, they also have to be stored in the right temperature, says Vandana Sundra, marketing head, Eminence Organics.

 The Skeyndor range of organic products available for facials at June Tomkyns also boasts fresh plant and vegetable extracts. The best thing about these products is that there is something to suit every skin type, says skin analyst Sharon Rodrigues at June Tomkyns.

 Skin shine

 With its high fruit and vegetable content, the best thing about the organic range of skin care products is that one can feel the difference within a short span of time. 

 At Solace, one can try out the Aha exfoliating treatment for the face or the anti-ageing and anti-pigmentation programmes with the Eminence line. Since the vitamins are captured in their natural fresh base in the form of actual seeds, pulps and peels, they begin their regenerative and healing powers very fast and the effect begins to show on your skin in two to three sittings, says Carol.

 The process is, however, quite long drawn as it requires in-depth analysis of your skin type before treatment begins. It is very important that we analyse the skin type early on, to get the desired effect of a glowing skin, Carol adds.

 At June Tomkyns, organic facials are popular, with the orange extract facial treatment for younger skin in great demand. 

 Todays youngsters want immediate results and this facial works wonders for their skin. The results show very soon, says Sharon Rodrigues of June Tomkyns.

 Price pinch

 Treating your skin naturally, mind you, doesnt come cheap. Each sitting at Solace with the Eminence line could cost anything from Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,500.

 Since organic products are natural, the production cost goes up. But with women becoming more conscious and the results very effective, most dont mind spending the extra buck, offer Carol and Sharon.

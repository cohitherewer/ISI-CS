Life

 Bond with the best

 Impeccably styled suits, solid shirts in pastel hues, pristine white chikankari kurtas... a few wardrobe essentials of the classic dresser. Shradha Agarwal takes a peek

 That impeccably cut suit worn with that perfectly teamed shirt. Superbly styled collars, the look complete with the finest of accessories. Add to that a finishing touch in the form of a whiff of cologne that wafts through the air? regal, elegant and classic.

 Taking the dressing dossier series forward, GoodLife takes a peek into the wardrobe of he, the classy dresser.

 Who is he?

 Lucky are those few good men to whom this kind of style comes effortlessly. According to mens wear designer Medhavini Khaitan, the classy look is essentially about a worked-on image that is intelligently built over the years. The aura of a classic person extends beyond his choice of clothing. It is more about his feel and personality, she says.

 While the basic characteristics remain consistent, an exception here or there does not detract from the general ? often larger than life ? image. (Think Amitabh Bachchans leather jacket avatar in KBC Dwitiya, a couple of films and some public appearances ? they do little to dilute his suave and classy image).

 Designer Sayon Mitra says: A classic dresser is usually a slightly mature person who is conscious of who he really is, his topmost quality being abundant charm. He has to be someone who is very well-groomed, immaculately dressed with co-ordinated well-fitted clothes, the details ranging from accessories to after shave. 

 Looking up

 India or abroad, there is no dearth of men dressed in true class and style. Suave actors or pleasant politicians serve not only as great eye candy but also go a long, long way in setting classy style trends for so many to follow. 

 Heres a look at some of the hottest male role models who have managed to define class and redefine cool.

 Theme talk

 There are two distinct classic looks ? casual and professional formal. Says Medhavini: The classic casual look is about thin undershirts or standard cotton white tees. Fitted white T-shirts never go out of style, mostly because of their year-round versatility. He can team it with a pair of blue denims, anything from Levis to Diesel. The look is complete with a pair of black loafers and a stylish pair of shades in a simple, oval frame.

 The formal classic look is further styled by Zegna or Ferragamo ties. Watches for the classic man, says Medhavini, need a round dial with subtle numberings and colours. His preferred brands are Cartier, Omega and Rolex. A bi-fold leather wallet and a slim, black boxy briefcase by a luxury brand like Goldphil rounds off the classy image.

 Must have

 With both the contemporary and traditional wardrobes in mind, his style basics are elaborate. Mix and match is not a classic mantra. Likewise, classic and trendy dont go together, explains Medhavini.

 Sayon lists some important items to get the right look: 

 Well-tailored suits in basic black, navy blue and a pinstriped in charcoal grey

 Button-down shirts in solid pastel colours or stripes

 A beige sherwani, with an antique jamevar shawl

 A white chikan kurta with churidaar 

 Slightly pointed shoes in black and tan with co-ordinated belts

 A pair of traditional embroidered jutis

 Cufflinks in sterling silver

 A neat set of basic handkerchief 

 A sober collection of medium-width ties

 A cravat

 Scent by Giorgio Armani or Davidoff.

 Shop stops

 A shopping man rarely makes a pretty sight, but a classic man, at least based on what he comes across, just has to be an exception to the rule. Perfectly fitted outfits, keeping tailors appointments, matching and contrasting the colours? the test of patience in the truest sense of the term. 

 But the classic man, thank god, is far from complaining! His tastes are definitely expensive and his wallet seems to be doing a decent job of matching up. Some of his favourite haunts abroad are branded stores like Hugo Boss, Armani, Burberry, Zenia and Ralph Lauren.

 Specialists like Thomas Pink and Saville Row serve his purpose of classic tailoring. Back home, the classic gentleman can have his happy pick from Rajesh Pratap Singh, Shahab Durazi, Raghavendra Rathore and some of Ravi Bajajs lines.

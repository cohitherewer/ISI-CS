 Who can trust the politicians? Things might change after the election results. There is enough space left for pedestrians to walk by. We do not come in their way. I have been selling albums on the pavement here for 20-25 years now. Earlier, the police did evict us a number of times. That meant our goods being confiscated for a week or so, holding our business to ransom. But ever since Mamata Banerjee took up our cause at Gariahat, no one has bothered us.

 Scar of acid, 

 salve of books 

 - Tannery torment or hostel comfort, teenager studies on

 Phoolmani Khatun is not 14 years old yet, but she has already learnt to juggle job, school, family and household work. Less than a year ago, she had to do all that and more; the physical scars are beginning to fade, but the ones on the mind are indelible.

 The youngster lived with seven sisters, one brother and her parents in a tiny makeshift tent that they called home in the slums of Topsia. She worked in a leather tanning factory nearby, hands and feet immersed in acid along with the leather every day. That was her job ever morning, from about 5 am to 7 am. The acid left her skin scarred. The pay was a barrel of scrap leather per hour. ?When sold, it comes to about Rs 40,? says Phoolmani.

 After work, it was back home for household chores like cooking and cleaning. From 11 am to 4 pm she was in Modernland Girls High School, Santoshpur, followed by study time till darkness descended. More housework and then to bed, curled up under the cot where her brother slept.

 And still, Phoolmani managed to rank in the top three in class every time. ?I had some help,? the talkative girl smiles shyly. ?My ?aunty?, Uma Roychowdhury, worked in a coaching centre for underprivileged children nearby. She would help me after school with subjects that I found difficult.?

 Determination, this teenager has dollops of. In the admission test to Modernland, she failed in mathematics. So she worked doubly hard and came first in class by the end of the year. Now, at Al-Ameen Mission, math is her favourite subject.

 Last year, some months after classes began, Phoolmani was brought to Al-Ameen Mission to be admitted in Class VII. The madarsa in Howrah district that also runs a hostel for underprivileged meritorious students, is a regular at The Telegraph Education Foundation?s annual School Awards for Excellence.

 Now Phoolmani has a bed to sleep on, electricity, clean drinking water and nutritious food. Even the scars have started to heal.

 Getting here was a struggle, though. ?My parents thought I might be sold. So my mother, brother and ?aunty? came with me to see this place, along with a few others.?

 Forgetting the past in not an easy task. Phoolmani won?t discuss her final exam results because she?s not satisfied with them ? she didn?t rank in the top three. ?I have to get used to being in Al-Ameen Mission. I suddenly have so much. I?m afraid I will lose it all...? 

 So afraid, in fact, that she won?t even dare to dream of the future ? ?I can?t think of what I want to be. What if I suddenly have to leave this place and go back home and back to work??

 The weight of expectations is heavy. ?My father doesn?t do anything, my mother and sister still work in the factory. I want my siblings to be educated, but they don?t study anymore. When I was home, I would make them sit and study with me. But now they have no one to guide them?? she trails off, guilt writ on her face at her own good fortune.

 ?Phoolmani?s story is an inspiring one,? says Nurul Islam, the man who started the Mission. ?She is capable of going far.?

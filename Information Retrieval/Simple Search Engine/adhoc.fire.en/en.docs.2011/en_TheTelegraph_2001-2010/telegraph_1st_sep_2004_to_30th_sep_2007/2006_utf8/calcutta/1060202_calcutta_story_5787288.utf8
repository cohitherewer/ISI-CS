The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Trade greets ban with recycle cry

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The state government has decided to ban plastic bags and cups in the city and the rest of the state, a move being opposed by a section of the industry as unrealistic. 

 ?We have decided to ban plastic bags and cups of all shapes and sizes across the state,? chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb told Metro on Tuesday. Officials at Writers? Buildings said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had asked the chief secretary at a recent meeting to take steps to root out the plastic menace.

 ?As for Calcutta, we plan to make it a no-plastic city in phases. Initially, we will ban plastic bags below 20 micron in thickness and cups below six inches in height. In the next step, we will ban all kinds of plastic bags and cups, and finally, the curb will be extended to small pouches used for packing shampoo, pan masala, khaini, snuff, detergents and toiletries,? he added.

 The chief secretary said that before the ban order is promulgated, the manufacturers will be given two months to wind up their business. 

 ?Our strategy is to achieve the goal slowly. If an ordinance is promulgated right now, it cannot be implemented and we do not want to make a move that will not be successful. We want to give plastic bag manufacturers and traders enough time to wind up their business and make people aware of the need for shunning the items,? the chief secretary said.

 According to his estimate, the city could be made free of plastic in three-four months.

 The civic body has been demanding such a step. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has submitted a report to the chief minister, stating that the drainage system could not be improved unless plastic bags and cups are banned.

 R.A. Lohia, chairman of the environment committee of Indian Plastic Federation, said: ?We have requested the government not to take such a decision, as nearly 30,000 people are directly involved with the plastic industry. It?s true that plastic bags are unhealthy and that they block the drainage system, but a ban is surely not a solution. We have to think of an alternative, like plastic recycling.?

 The Centre for Quality Management System, Jadavpur University, has developed a system to recycle plastic items. 

 A committee, comprising representatives of the pollution control board and various stakeholders, is studying the issue and will soon submit a report to the government.

 Last October, the Maharashtra government had issued an order banning plastic across the state.

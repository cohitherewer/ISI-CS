The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From bungalow to Bypass sprawl

 - Wish-come-true 

 campus

 From a quaint bungalow on Lee Road to a sprawling campus on the Bypass. The students and staff of Calcutta International School have got more than they bargained for at their new address in Anandapur, near Ruby General Hospital an atrium, spacious classrooms and laboratories, a deck on the third floor with a wonderful view of the city, a cafeteria and a huge playground. 

 A total of Rs 14 crore has been spent on this new campus. And the work is still going on, said principal Anuradha Das. We moved in on October 30. We are in awe of this campus, although we were very sentimental about the old one. But I am amazed that we have settled down comfortably so soon.

 The campus, all of 121 cottahs, is thrice as large as the old premises adjoining Forum. Work on the new building started last year after the 53-year-old school purchased the plot from the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. 

 The pre-school classes have attached toilets, the biology laboratory extends into a botany and rock garden, the music room opens into the assembly area so that the piano can be wheeled in for the morning congregation, the doors have been built adhering to fire-safety rules.

 An auditorium is on the cards in the second phase of the project, due to begin in January, when the campus will be formally inaugurated. 

 This place reminds me of schools back in the UK. I like it. Its just that at times I get lost here, smiled Hollie Thrasher of Class IX.

 For the teachers, each of the three staff rooms is equipped with a microwave, refrigerator and a months stock of tea, sugar and more. I am enjoying myself thoroughly, though it will take a while to make this our home, said Piali Dey, a teacher with the senior section of the school.

 For ex-student and now history teacher Tina Servaia, the new campus is a wish come true: I have been waiting for this since I was studying on the Lee Road campus.

 To retain the charm of the previous campus, the old wooden furniture has been brought along. For the cafeteria, we plan to have steel furniture (from Steel Junction). Some guardians have volunteered to chip in with saplings to sow on the campus and care for, said the principal.

 Despite the sprawl, the school intends to stick to the upper limit of 22-24 students per class to maintain the teacher-student ratio of 1:9. 

 A big school doesnt mean more students, it means higher standards and better facilities. Now, we have 500 students and that can at most go up to 650 in the future, but not more, stressed Das.

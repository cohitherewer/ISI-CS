 Fragrance for the trendy tot

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 BABY'S DAY IN 

 Little girls love to doll up as much their moms do. And so slipping into oversized dresses, putting on lipstick and dabbing expensive perfume would rank among their favourite pastimes.

 If thats what you think, youve gotta be kidding. Revelling in oversized dresses and borrowed lip colours have been replaced with repeated trials of well-fitted new add-ons to the little-girl wardrobe and trendy lip-gloss.

 And if looking good is a must, smelling good is also a priority. But the fragrances must match age and attitude.

 So, take your little ones to the City Centre outlet of Shoppers Stop, and let them choose from a treasury of baby perfumes and body sprays.

 Perfumes and sprays are popular with all ages. But when it came to kids there was a gap in the fragrance section that these items have helped fill up, says Santanu Ghosh, customer care associate and manager-operations of the store.

 On entering the wide perfume section on the ground floor, children can never miss these neatly displayed items in attractive and colourful packages. The range has been in the store from mid-October. Initially we gave them a small space, but then the response prompted us to give them more visibility, adds Santanu.

 l imported, the variety shall spoil you for choice. In the My Scene range of perfumes from the house of Barbie there are three fragrances ? My Scene Barbie, My Scene Chelsea and My Scene Madison in very distinct fruity essences.

 In sync with the names, the bottles and cases come adorned with cool girls Barbie and her friends Chelsea and Madison on them, each sporting equally cool outfits.

 The 100 ml bottle costs you Rs 580 while the 50 ml comes for Rs 425.

 The Barbie range also has six fragrances of body sprays to choose from ? Watermelon, Blueberry, Ginger, Lolly Pop, Funny Fruits and Vanilla Cake. The price tag: Rs 290.

 Gift your little angel a Barbie perfume gift pack and see how she loves it. A pretty perfume bottle with a flower-shaped cover and a notebook with mirror, all in pink, make up one gift pack. The other is a rectangular see-through pink bag with a perfume in it. The price tags: Rs 450 and Rs 580.

 With Barbie being a style icon for girls, the brand is popular with the young brigade. Moreover, the range is also pocket-friendly, points out Ghosh.

 The store is also home to a high-end range from Clayeux. The Moi Bebe range from this French brand is clinically tested and alcohol free.

 Other options include Maelle Fleur that smells citrus, Maelle Libellule that emits a soothing flowery fragrance and Maelle Coeur with a mild essence.

 The bottles come in colourfully striped knitted covers with bright round caps popping up. Each comes with free rubber bands encircled at the neck.

 From a sweet little teddy, to a heart stylistically curved at the end, from beautiful flowers to a sequinned butterfly, the bands are embellished with cute little motifs.

 A 50 ml bottle would cost you Rs 900 while the 100 ml ones are priced at Rs 1,275.

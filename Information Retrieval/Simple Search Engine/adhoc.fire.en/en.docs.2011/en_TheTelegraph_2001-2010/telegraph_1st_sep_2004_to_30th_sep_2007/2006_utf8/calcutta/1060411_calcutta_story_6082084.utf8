 Walk up a bridge that resembles Rabindra Setu while admiring masterpieces that look like Town Hall or Victoria Memorial. Catch a movie at the multiplex above after a meal at the food court. All at Ffirangi Bazaar, on EM Bypass, opposite Salt Lake stadium, in the fourth quarter of 2007.

 ?Concept-driven malls are common in the West. When we were planning the mall, we decided to weave it around a popular concept, that of the colonial architecture in Calcutta,? says S.K. Jhunjhunwala, managing director, JJ Group of Companies.

 But why call the 180,000-sq-ft address Ffirangi Bazaar? ?In Bengal, the English were called firangi. That is why we decided to name the mall with a colonial touch the Ffirangi Bazaar,? explains Jhunjhunwala.

 The mall would be spread over six floors, with the basement reserved for parking. ?The lower ground floor, upper ground floor and the first floor will be reserved for the anchor store. The second floor will house other shop stops. The third and the fourth floor will be exclusive for entertainment and food, with three bar-cum-restaurants and the food court. The fifth and the sixth floors would be for the multiplex,? said Jhunjhunwala.

 What about big names on board? The man steering Ffirangi Bazaar rattles off a list of heavyweights ? ?Lifestyle Max, Levis, Reebok, Adidas and Lee Copper, with Delhi-based M2K bringing in the multiplex?.

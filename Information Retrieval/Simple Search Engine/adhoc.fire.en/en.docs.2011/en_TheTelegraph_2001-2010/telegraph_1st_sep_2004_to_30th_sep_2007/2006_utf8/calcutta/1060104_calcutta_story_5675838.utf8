 Gas kit dealers cry for cost sops

 Lack of demand has prompted dealers of LPG kits to demand subsidy or incentives from the government to get vehicle-owners to switch to the green fuel.

 In a memorandum submitted last week to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, the Greater Calcutta Gas Kits Dealers? Forum urged the government to grant subsidy either on the price of LPG kits, VAT on kits or sales tax on auto LPG. 

 Withdrawal of cess and a concession on road tax are the other proposals the forum wants the state to consider.

 ?We explained to the minister that vehicle-owners will be encouraged to opt for LPG if the government allows some financial concessions in the form of subsidy or incentive,? said forum spokesperson Sharad Jhawar.

 The government had ordered that pre-1990 vehicles had to be withdrawn if the owners did not switch to green fuel by December 31. Following intervention by the high court, the deadline was extended by seven days.

 Jhawar feels the government has washed its hands of the issue by making the announcement. ?Unlike in other metros, the authorities here have not followed it up by encouraging owners of old vehicles to opt for LPG,? he said.

 Of the 65,000-odd autorickshaws plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (40,000 are more than 15 years old), only 750 have switched to LPG. The number of taxis and cars now running on green fuel are 100 and 700, respectively. 

 Despite the government order and the fact that even the revised deadline will lapse soon, very few vehicle-owners are showing interest in LPG kits.

 The scene is in stark contrast to that of Chennai, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Bangalore and Hyderabad, where 60 to 90 per cent of old vehicles are running on LPG. The reason for the success there is the governments? willingness to provide subsidy and incentives. The most tangible outcome of such concessions is the low price of the fuel, compared to that in Calcutta.

 In fact, auto LPG and LPG kits in the city are the costliest in the country, as the state government charges 17 per cent sales tax and Re 1 cess on the fuel and 12.5 per cent tax on the kits. The price of auto LPG, which cost Rs 19 a few months ago, is Rs 29.55 ? cheaper than diesel by a mere Rs 2.50. The kits cost Rs 22,000.

 In the other metros, the government offers eight per cent subsidy on tax on the kits. 

 The Tamil Nadu government, in addition, provides 25 per cent subsidy on the cost of the kits and also arranges for bank loans.

 ?The conversion pace has picked up over the past two months, yet the rate is far from desirable. Unless the government comes forward with concessions, Calcuttans will not be spared poisonous fume,?? said J. Khara, who runs an LPG kit centre in south Calcutta.

 Forum representatives fear that most of the 75 LPG kits centres in the city will have to down shutters if the conversion rate does not rise. 

 The transport minister said he had taken up the matter with finance minister Asim Dasgupta, but could not commit anything now. 

 ?I will have a detailed discussion with the dealers and try my best to sort out the problems,?? Chakraborty said.

 Home truth worth 80 lakh

 - Bank loan granted against photocopied documents

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Smart, suave and in his mid-30s, Sanjeev Aurora walked into a private bank and placed an application for a house loan for about Rs 80 lakh. 

 That sum, he claimed, was needed to buy a house in Swinhoe Lane, and, accordingly, he submitted documents justifying his claim. This happened in June last year.

 Six months later, it dawned upon the bank that it had been duped and in what is one of the biggest frauds in recent times involving an individual seeking a home loan from a private bank, a complaint was lodged. 

 On Monday evening, detective department officers arrested Sanjeev at his McLeod Street residence. Sanjeev was produced in a city court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till January 12.

 ?In his application to the bank, Sanjeev claimed that the property was being promoted by one Fauzdar Shah. The person whom he named is real and is into promoting real estate. But Sanjeev wasn?t implying him. He presented another individual of the same name and convinced the bank to sanction the loan, which he pocketed himself,? said Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief.

 After going through the documents ? all of them photocopies ? the bank cleared the application and even sanctioned the entire loan amount of Rs 79.78 lakh. 

 Of this, Rs 53 lakh was handed over to the promoter Fauzdar Shah ? the one whom Sanjeev presented to the bank ? and the remaining Rs 26.78 lakh was handed over by cheque to Sanjeev. 

 Detective department officers have yet to figure out why this was done.

 ?How can a bank clear the entire amount only on the basis of photocopied documents? No original document was submitted and yet the applicant was handed over a cheque? These are some areas that need to be clarified,? said a senior officer of the bank fraud section of the detective department.

 Soon after receiving the cheque, Sanjeev opened an account in a bank in the name of a private company and encashed it. Police are not sure what he did with the other amount, except that a part of it was spent on paying the man who went by the name of Fauzdar Shah. 

 After six months, while going through the transactional details, the bank top brass stumbled upon the loopholes and lodged a complaint with Hare Street police station on December 29. The detective department took up the case on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crores for new water plant

 - Joint venture to feed proposed township in Dankuni

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) has decided to join hands with a private partner for a Rs 100-crore project to supply filtered surface water to the township coming up in Dankuni from the Hooghly in Serampore. A 15-km-long pipe will be used for the purpose.

 ?It will be a 50-million gallon water treatment plant and will be commissioned in less than three years,? said CMWSA chief engineer Rajat Mohan Chatterjee on Tuesday.

 Once completed, the project will be the first in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area to supply filtered surface water to a township not on the bank of a river.

 The proposed plant will be located near the Palta waterworks, but on the opposite bank of the Hooghly, between Serampore and Seoraphuli.

 The site has been selected after surveying the stretch between Uttarpara and Serampore, on the western bank of the Hooghly. It was found that the river would be able to provide uninterrupted supply of 50 million gallons of water even during the lean period in June, only at Serampore. 

 According to Chatterjee, a dedicated big-diameter water mains would be laid under Delhi Road (National Highway 2) to supply water to Dankuni. The township will be spread over 5,010 acre and house about 1.5 million people.

 ?We will sell treated water in the proposed township and, hence, there is a scope for investment by private parties,? explained the chief engineer.

 Keeping in mind the logistics hub and super expressways coming up in and around Kona, the CMWSA expects good business from Dankuni.

 The township will have bungalows and housing estates, hospitals, schools and colleges. Multiplexes, entertainment parks, swimming pools and residents? clubs will also be set up there. A 1,000-acre plot will be kept reserved for an industrial hub.

 Last November, representatives of the Indonesia-based Salim and Ciputra groups had toured the township site.

Life

 Prim and propah, the way to be

SHRADHA AGARWAL

Marilyn Monroe was so paranoid about her restroom sounds that she put on all the taps to drown it all out Only for her boyfriends mother to be shocked son, do you have a horse for a girlfriend... Who wouldnt be interested in such trivia, especially if its coupled with Mumbai-based grooming expert Chhaya Momayas how-not-to-make-any-sound-in-the-restroom tips!

Welcome to Quick Starts On Image And Grooming, a one-day workshop by FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), Calcutta chapter, held at The Park on Saturday.

 The three other speakers were beauty expert Bridgette Jones, fashion designer Anamika Khanna and image consultant Lata Goenka of Maximum Effect from Singapore.

 The day began with Chhayas session. Combating body and mouth odour (the eat-right-bathe-right routine), menopause mantras, body brushing and pigmentation All found a place, with the highlight being her recommended checklist for every woman.

 Take a good look at the mirror before stepping out of home. Check: 

 Ironed 

clothes. 

Snip off hanging threads from your attire. 

Brush the ends of your hair well and shake off fallen strands and dandruff. 

Wipe off excess lipstick to prevent bleeding. Touch up with gloss.

Dust off extra make-up with a compact or ear bud.

Keep two sponges one to wipe off dust from tip of shoes, other for your bag.

Check for body odour. 

Keep eyewear sparkling clean.

Groom eyebrows with old mascara wand dipped in baby oil. 

Must-haves for a womans bag facial tissue, hand sanitiser and mouth freshener. 

Next up, personal hygiene, a topic that was twisted by Chhaya to include language 

because it is unhygienic to use dirty or strong words. Try sensual 

for sexy and dont trick me for lie, she urged.

Bridgette took the stage next and she led the crowd 

through the basics of hair care and easy hairstyles. The highlights: 

Oiling is out, hair spa is in. 

Henna is out, colour is in. 

Straight is out, curls are in. 

She also shared tricks to hide a bad hair day. Tie 

it all back or maybe try a switch, she said.

Anamikas talk touched upon a variety of topics 

from travelling wardrobe to business dressing, festive trends to colours 

 There is no need to follow trends. Who decides them anyway? asked Anamika, explaining the forever-in-rotation cyclical nature of fashion. Study the trends and adapt only that which can fit into your lifestyle not volume that makes one look like an elephant! Some elements, she added, are forever in.

 Anamikas key points:

Elegance, elegance, elegance. There can never be enough of it.

Underdressed is better than overdressed.

Take one piece off, just before leaving home. This is what Gudda (Rohit 

Bal) taught me years ago. I still abide by it.

Make one thing stand out, have a single point of attention. 

Opt for cleaner lines, no clutter. 

Have fun with your wardrobe. 

On a holiday, wear what youre comfortable in. You dont have to wear 

only jeans abroad.

Accessorise with one highlight piece. Dont let 20 other things drown it.

Mix. But mix well. 

 The dressing crash course over, it was over to a more holistic idea the total image. It takes exactly six seconds to make an impression, said Lata, the fourth speaker for the day. 

 And most of it happens before you open your mouth. In fact, 93 per cent of an impression is attributed to your appearance, actions and tone of voice and only seven per cent is about the words. Sadly, not much of how one can make the right impression was discussed in detail.

 The post-lunch session covered everything from the right tone to speak, body language and table etiquette. And most of the segment was interactive.

 You can make absolutely anything look elegant if you decide to, said Chhaya. There was adequate proof of that with a host of ladies coming up on stage to be given marks on their body language and speech skills, with emphasis on how to hold attention.

 And you thought it was a cakewalk?

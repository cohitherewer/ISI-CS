 Bloom bane for waterbodies

 Sourish Misra: Waterbodies are polluted with toxic chemicals due to immersion of idols. Can?t you prevent this?

 The maximum number of immersions take place in a two-km stretch in Chandernagore. About 300 huge Jagaddhatri idols are immersed here. The PCB has measured toxicity levels in the up and downstream of the Hooghly at Chandernagore during immersion, but nothing alarming was revealed. It is the used flowers that cause serious harm to waterbodies.

 The PCB has directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and other civic bodies to make arrangements for retrieving the remnants of the images after immersion. In Calcutta, special enclosures were set up at the ghats by the civic authorities to that end.

 Tonnes of raw and finished bales of jute, worth a few crores, were reduced to ashes when a fire broke out in Howrah Jute Mill ? one of the oldest in the town ? on Foreshore Road on Sunday afternoon. 

 he fire broke out around 4.10 pm in the middle of a sprawling hall housing four departments, including the sewing and baling units, before spreading. It took about 14 fire tenders from both Howrah and Calcutta over four hours to bring the blaze under control.

 ire fighters said the operation would continue all night since the entire hall was littered with inflammable materials, including oil and plastic.

 ith crowds gathering to have a look at the inferno, police had to resort to a lathi-charge. ?We have asked other police stations to pitch in, in case there is a law-and-order problem. A message has also been sent to the central headquarters of the fire services seeking more engines,? said a senior officer of Shibpur police station.

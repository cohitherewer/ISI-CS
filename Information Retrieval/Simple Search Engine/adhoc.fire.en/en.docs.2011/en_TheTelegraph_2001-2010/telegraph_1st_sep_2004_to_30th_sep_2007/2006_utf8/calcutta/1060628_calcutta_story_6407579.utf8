 College agenda: course upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, announced a host of initiatives that it plans to undertake after the new academic session gets underway on July 1, the day the college officially declares its autonomous status.

 Principal Father P. C. Mathew said on Monday that the autonomous status would help the college in restructuring its curriculum, updating the syllabus and applying for the deemed university status in future.

 ?With the autonomous status, we plan on defining higher education in Bengal. The changes in syllabus will be subject-based and will come into effect from July 1. We also plan to update our curriculum on a regular basis and, at the same, time bring in a number of initiatives that we have chalked out considering the demands of industry,? said Father Mathew.

 He added that the college had been in consultation with academic experts for reshaping the syllabus.

 The college will be introducing the credit system for academic assessment and will also offer specialisation in particular subjects.

 ?The changes will be made taking into account the need, capability, time-frame and the standards existing in other universities in the country. These changes are for the new students who have taken admission this year. The rest of the students will continue studying under Calcutta University regulations,? pointed out Father Mathew.

 He added that the college authorities are confident that the proposed new postgraduate campus, coming up off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, would be complete by 2010, coinciding with the college?s 150th year.

 ?We have six acres of land, but will require more in order to accomplish what we have planned. The new campus will have postgraduate courses with more emphasis on research and consultancy. We will be stressing on media studies, biotechnology, information technology (IT) and management studies,? explained Father Mathew.

 The college authorities also pointed out that the autonomous status had led to a certain amount of financial largesse. 

 Funds to the tune of Rs 12 lakh per year for postgraduate courses and Rs 7 lakh per year for undergraduate courses have been allocated. 

 In addition, Rs 1 crore would be disbursed over a period of five years by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

 Father Mathew said that to achieve deemed university status, the college corpus would require funds amounting to Rs 20 crore.

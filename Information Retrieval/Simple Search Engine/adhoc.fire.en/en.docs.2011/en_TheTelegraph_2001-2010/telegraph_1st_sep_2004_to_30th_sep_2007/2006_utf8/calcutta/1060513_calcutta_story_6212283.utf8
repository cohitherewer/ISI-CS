The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Accidental 

 hero of urban folk sound

 Singer SIMON WEBBE tells 

 Pratim D. Gupta how he started out as a soccer 

 player before stumbling into the music arena, strumming with 

 Blue and then going solo 

 MUSIC 

 ZONE

 As a child when he visited the 

 neighbourhood church, Simon Webbe (in picture left) 

 had no clue that the free-flowing gospels would lay the 

 foundation for a glorious career in music.

 The man who went on to become 

 an integral member of the chartbusting boy band Blue has 

 now successfully launched an independent musical career 

 on the wings of his debut solo album Sanctuary.

 I remember going to the 

 church four days a week and we would all pray together singing 

 the hymns, recalls the 26-year-old Brit in a phone 

 chat with The Telegraph.

 I used to join in the songs 

 but that was mostly fun. In fact, at times I would be shy 

 enough not to sing and just move my lips to the words.

 With the shyness fading away, 

 Simon took a liking to something else altogether ? football. 

 While he continued to love music and listen to a lot of 

 Bob Marley, he thought soccer was his true calling. 

 From the time I was 10 years 

 old, football was my life, whispers the baritone, 

 with more than a sigh.

 Simon makes no bones about the 

 fact that he could have made it big in any field but someone 

 had to decide the right path for him. 

 Yes, I was confused because 

 I was good at most things, he admits.

 It was getting hard to decide 

 but my mom made it easy for me when she said I cant 

 send you to everything from kung-fu to judo to dancing, 

 you choose any one. I chose soccer.

 After a four-year stint at the 

 Port Vales School of Excellence, when Liverpool and 

 Aston Villa were taking note of Simons ball skills, 

 tragedy struck.

 He was 17 and a torn ligament 

 at an insignificant match ensured that he could never play 

 football professionally again.

 Soccers loss was musics 

 gain. It was a massive blow at that time but I was 

 always raised with the saying that you cant always 

 have what you want, Simon sounds philosophical.

 So, when I was told that 

 I would never play again, I just thought of getting out 

 there and expressing myself in some other way.

 Despite the intention, things 

 didnt fall into place too soon. It wasnt 

 that easy but luckily I was pushed into singing, reveals 

 Simon. My best friend Hannah got me singing in front 

 of people and soon I was singing everywhere.

 The big breakthrough happened 

 with the united colours of Blue. Simon found the association 

 with fellow audition-circuit musicians Duncan James, Lee 

 Ryan and Anthony Costa infectious and soon they 

 were jamming together. 

 Blue was accidental, yet 

 it was something that was meant to happen, he describes.

 It was after six months 

 that we started to perform and play cover versions of other 

 songs. It also didnt have to be R amp;B as we used 

 to listen to all kinds of music.

 With Blues debut single 

 All Rise hitting the high notes, the group was in 

 business and Simon was soon penning hits like One Love 

 and Fly By. 

 Blue was the be all and 

 end all for me and at no point of time did I think of going 

 solo when I was performing with the band, he confesses.

 In fact, it came as a shock 

 when we had to take a break. We had the option of taking 

 up the guitars and jumping around like it is done. But we 

 couldnt do that and we took a step back by taking 

 a break.

 Three months later, Simon was 

 on his own. He got a recording label and got busy devising 

 a new genre of music.

 I call my solo music urban 

 folk. Its a natural connection of the two forms. The 

 reason I didnt sing R amp;B was because I wanted to 

 separate myself from Blue. I am still very proud of the 

 band but it was what it was. I wanted to try and create 

 something different by myself. Hopefully, other people will 

 join the urban folk genre, one by one.

 That different feel was an instant 

 draw as Simons debut single Lay Your Hands became 

 a massive hit everywhere followed by the release of his 

 first album Sanctuary.

 The album did better than 

 all of our expectations and estimations in the UK, 

 he smiles.

 Such a success wasnt 

 even on our wishlist. And now, I am in a comfort zone where 

 I can really try a lot of other things.

 Apart from these various things 

 within music, Simon has dabbled in movies and modelling 

 too.

 The Truth About Love finds 

 Simon playing a professional footballer opposite Jennifer 

 Love Hewitt, while Rolling With The Nines has him 

 sharing screen space with Jason Flemyng and Billy Murray. 

 I have also done the soundtrack 

 for a good friend of mine who is directing a film called 

 The Sixth Commandment, Simon adds.

 Its surprising Im 

 a musician, Simon had said halfway into the chat. 

 By the end of the chat with the all-rounder, one realised 

 just why.

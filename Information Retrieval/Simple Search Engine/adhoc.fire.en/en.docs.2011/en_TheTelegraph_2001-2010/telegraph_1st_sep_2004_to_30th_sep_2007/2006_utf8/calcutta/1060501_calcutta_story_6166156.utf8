 Portrait of an angry loner 

Well-built and feared

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ananda Mazumdar, the 42-year-old who jumped to death from his fifth-floor apartment after murdering mother Nandini on Sunday, was obsessed with body-building. 

 Neighbours claim he fantasised about slugging it out with none other than Muhammad Ali.

 Ananda was scary enough for the other residents of Kanchenjunga, the 13-storeyed building at 5B, Robinson Street, in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area, to give him a wide berth.

 Most residents of this highrise never expected good-neighbourly behaviour from this well-built man. On the contrary, they were always afraid of him and hardly ever interacted with him because of his belligerence.

 Rashbehari Ganguly, architect of the building constructed in 1977, said: ?We would never step into the lift if he was inside. He was not mad but his attitude and body language were scary enough.? 

 Ganguly confirmed that the Mazumdars had been living in a rented flat in the building since it came up in 1977.

 Ananda might have been feared by his neighbours, but they always sought the help of his father, a noted chartered accountant. 

 ?He was a prominent tax consultant and financial adviser. The owner of the apartment had filed an eviction suit against mother and son. But a number of people, who had been helped by Ananda?s father, Sankar Chandra, provided the family financial aid to fight the case,? said Ganguly.

 The police agreed with the highrise residents that the Mazumdars were loners. 

 ?The family hardly interacted with the neighbours. They used to remain cooped up in their flat,? said Gananath Mukherjee, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 ?Whenever Ananda would talk to people, it used to be about his physical prowess. He would show off his biceps to the security guards and brag that he could eliminate anybody with his bare hands. He even claimed that his intelligence quotient matched Einstein?s,? said another resident.

 Ananda had set up a small gym in his flat where he used to lift weights and exercise.

 Corroborating Mukherjee?s statement, Ananda?s next-door neighbour Radha Ghoshal said: ?The only son of the family was not mad, but he was extremely short-tempered and infamous for his fits of anger. I heard him shout at his mother around 12.30 pm today, one hour before the incident took place. But what he was saying, I could not hear.? 

 Ghoshal added that she had interacted with the family only twice or thrice and ?Nandini did not allow anyone to enter her apartment when her husband died 10 years ago. She would change domestic helps after every two months?.

 She felt Nandini never accepted the fact that her son had some sort of psychological disorder.

 Best described as conceptual, the paintings of Swapan Kumar Mallick offer a number of visual-image combinations of two opposite forces of nature, as well as direct symbols mainly suggesting procreation. Cerebral Procreation: conjugating binaries, dissecting time, the ongoing exhibition of his works, finds him reconciling everyday culture with artistic avant garde, as he transposes old and new images as elements of his statement. Besides traditional symbolism associated with snake, fish, flower and fruit, his repertoire also includes modern-day cult objects like jeans, computers and Barbie dolls. Showcasing his artistic eloquence, the exhibition also portrays his daring use of colours, complementing red against green and yellow against violet, to give his paintings a metaphysical or surrealistic identity. In an expression of meticulous technique, his presentation of incongruities, besides matching his themes, allows his works to have a remarkable surprise effect.

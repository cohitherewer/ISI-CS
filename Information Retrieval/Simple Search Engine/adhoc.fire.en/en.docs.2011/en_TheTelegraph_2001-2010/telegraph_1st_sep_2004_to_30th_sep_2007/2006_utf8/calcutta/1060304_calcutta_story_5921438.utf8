 Germany and Bengal moved a significant step closer on Friday with a 45-member German business delegation passing through town.

 At the end of the daylong visit of the largest German delegation to touch down in Calcutta, Bengal had managed to bag a dedicated platform for special presentations on information technology (IT) and industry at CeBIT next week and then at the Hannover Fair in April.

 There was also serious talk of the Germans setting up an automobile component manufacturing unit in the state.

 ?Petroleum, automobiles, textiles, electronics and IT are some of the sectors we would like to grow exponentially in. And I strongly believe that Germany, one of the great manufacturing nations, can offer us a lot of expertise on how to go about it,? observed minister for industry, trade and commerce Nirupam Sen.

 ?This delegation, which included representatives from a wide variety of industries, came with the objective of exploring the business potential of Bengal and to have meetings with the local business units for joint ventures and strategic alliances,? added Sen.

 According to team leader Walter Hirche, minister for economics, transport and employment, state of Lower Saxony, Germany, the delegation represented almost every facet of the Lower Saxony economy.

 ?Bengal is re-emerging as an industrial hub and also serves as the gateway to immensely resource-rich areas. These meetings will serve as great fact-finding missions for us,? he observed.

 At their meeting, Sen is learnt to have highlighted the possibilities of tie-ups in the automobile components manufacturing sector. The discussions would be carried forward by industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen at the Hannover Fair to be held late next month.

 The delegation also met IT minister Manab Mukherjee. With India being a partner country for CeBIT 2006, the world?s biggest information, communication and technology exposition to be held at Hannover from March 9, the meeting assumed greater importance.

 ?We had a very meaningful discussion regarding trade and joint ventures in IT in the near future. The delegates have promised that these discussions will be continued at Hannover,? said Mukherjee.

 Gunter Wehrmann, German consul general for Calcutta, summed it up: ?The face of this city is changing rapidly in favour of business. The visit of this delegation will be of benefit for business between Germany and India.?

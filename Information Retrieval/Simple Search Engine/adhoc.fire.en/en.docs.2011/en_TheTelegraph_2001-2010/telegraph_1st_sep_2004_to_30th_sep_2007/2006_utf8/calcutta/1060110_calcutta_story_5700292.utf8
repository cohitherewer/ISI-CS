The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chilly times in the offing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Good news for those complaining that it is not cold enough. The Met office on Monday predicted a drop in the temperature from Tuesday.

 Calcutta will soon feel the impact of the ongoing cold wave in the northern regions of the country. ?From tomorrow, we expect the temperature to dip. After 48 hours, we expect the minimum temperature to hover between 10 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

 On Monday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 12.9 degrees, which is normal. This winter, the coldest day so far has been December 31, when the mercury dipped to 12.2 degrees.

 ?It takes some time to receive the impact of a cold wave in north India. But, there is a smooth passage for the North Wind. We have already issued a cold wave warning for isolated pockets in Bihar and Jharkhand during the next 24 hours,? said Debnath.

 Officers said the next three or four days are going to be cold by Calcutta?s standards.

 ?The wind pattern is favourable. We are receiving the wind from the northern and north-western parts of the country, where it is extremely cold now. Also, there is no incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal, leading to a dry atmosphere. The chill is likely to prevail if no low-pressure forms on the sea or land affecting Calcutta and the districts,? an official said.

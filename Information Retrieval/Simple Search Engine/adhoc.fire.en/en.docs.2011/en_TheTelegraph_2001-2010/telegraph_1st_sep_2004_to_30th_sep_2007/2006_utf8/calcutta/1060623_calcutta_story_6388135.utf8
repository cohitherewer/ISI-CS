 Forward Bloc supporters who assembled near Netaji?s statue on the Maidan on Thursday morning to celebrate the party?s foundation day were greeted by the sight of the flags, festoons and posters ?being torn down? by armymen.

 The incident was seen by Bloc leaders as a fall-out of last Friday?s demonstration by Chhatra League, the party?s student wing, against defence minister Pranab Mukherjee when he visited the city. The demonstrators demanded a discussion in Parliament over the Mukherjee Commission?s report on Forward Bloc founder Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose?s disappearance.

 The army, however, said the party had not taken the permission necessary for holding a programme on the Maidan.

 The Bloc supporters chanted slogans against the army, custodians of the Maidan. Newly-elected MP Barun Mukherjee, along with other party leaders, met the deputy general officer commanding (GOC), Bengal Area, to discuss the matter. The group also marched to the army headquarters at Fort William and met senior officers to express their displeasure.

 ?Around 6 am on Thursday, army personnel arrived on the spot in two vans and tore down the party flags and festoons. It is a serious and unprecedented act. No self-respecting political party can allow an assault on its flag. The act is an infringement of civil rights and a gross violation of the people?s right to pay respect to Netaji,? asserted Mukherjee.

 ?We were not organising any function on the Maidan, so there was no question of taking permission from the army. The deputy GOC, Bengal Area, assured me that an inquiry would be conducted. We will raise the issue in Parliament and even inform the Prime Minister,? the leader claimed.

 The army, however, stuck to its stand. ?The Forward Bloc had not intimated us about the programme. During a routine check early this morning, our officials found a large number of flags, festoons and posters on the Maidan. They removed the festoons and kept them near Netaji?s statue,? a senior officer told Metro. 

 According to him, the matter was sorted out amicably.

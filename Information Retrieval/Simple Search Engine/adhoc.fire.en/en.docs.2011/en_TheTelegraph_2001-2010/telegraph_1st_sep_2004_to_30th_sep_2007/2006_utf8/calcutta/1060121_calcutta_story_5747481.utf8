The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ire over cancelled flight

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trouble broke out at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Friday after a flight to Dimapur was cancelled owing to bad weather there.

 Indian Airlines? flight CD 7701 on the Calcutta-Dimapur route was scheduled to take off at 10 am. The ATR aircraft was carrying 33 passengers.

 However, ?the weather has been bad for the past few days at Dimapur and flights have been disrupted,? said an Indian Airlines spokesperson.

 As the airline authorities were waiting for the weather to clear at the airport in Nagaland, passengers sat in the Calcutta lounge. Around 2 pm, it was announced that the weather was better and the flight could take off. 

 Relieved, passengers underwent the security check and boarded the aircraft around 2.30 pm. ?But weather conditions at Northeastern airports fluctuate quite frequently and we received reports that conditions have worsened,? the airline spokesperson said.

 The ATR aircraft requires a minimum visibility of 3,600 metres to land at any airport, and the visibility range at Dimapur airport at that time was 3,000 metres. ?However, instead of cancelling the flight, the pilot decided to wait. If the weather improved, he could take off,? the officer said.

 But the weather deteriorated and visibility dropped to even less than 2,500 metres. By then, it was also evident that even if the flight had taken off, it could not make it to Dimapur before the sunset limitation time of flight operations was clamped. 

 At Dimapur, Imphal and other Northeast airports, aircraft can land and take-off till 4.34 pm. When it was announced that the flight could not take off, some passengers, including senior government officers, refused to leave for the lounge. Finally, they agreed to leave for a city hotel after 5.30 pm.

 Mixing business with social work, Ian McCartney, British minister for trade, investment and foreign affairs, visited Nijoloy, a home set up by the Womens Interlink Foundation (WIF), in Madhyamgram on Friday.

 McCartney is on his first Indian tour from November 23 to 27. His first stop was Calcutta, where he met the chief minister and trade and industry leaders.

 McCartney visited Nijoloy to unveil a plaque and launch a training-cum-income generation project for street children and children of sex workers and HIV/AIDS victims, funded by the British deputy high commission.

 I am overwhelmed by what I have seen here today. It is amazing how, even after going through so much, one can still give so much love, said McCartney. It is time for us to speak up and speak out against trafficking. The children staged a cultural programme for the minister and British deputy high commissioner to eastern India Simon Wilson.

 The silk screen and block-printing project is the second that the British deputy high commission is sponsoring for the WIF. The first was a stained glass painting project. Young adults in the age group of 15 and above have earned between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000 by selling their work.

 I am impressed by the work that the organisation is doing and I will see how we can continue providing funds to it, stated McCartney.

 When asked about his meeting with the chief minister of a communist state, McCartney said: Well, we did not talk about Marx and Lenin but I am very encouraged by the meeting. We talked about prospects of investing in infrastructure, deep-sea ports, health and education, especially as part of a public-private partnership.

 The minister has plans to come back next year with a business delegation from the UK.

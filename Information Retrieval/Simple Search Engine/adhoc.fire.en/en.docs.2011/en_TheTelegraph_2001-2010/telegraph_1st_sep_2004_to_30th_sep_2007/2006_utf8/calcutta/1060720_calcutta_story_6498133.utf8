 Her Calcutta connection goes back 25 years when a young Kavita got married into the Bhartia family of Alipore. At a time when her in-laws were on their way out to settle in Delhi, Kavita found the time to soak in the Calcutta flavour, something that still never fails to inspire her and always manages to revive her energy.

 In town to attend a Ladies Study Group (LSG) programme on Tuesday, Kavita traces her design roots to 1989 when she set up Ogaan. Aesthetics were a big part of my growing years and after I went on to study textile design, launching my label was the next obvious thing to do to nurture my love for creation, smiles Kavita.

 Her other loves include spending time with her family and friends. I also really enjoy exercising and eating healthy food, she admits. Not surprising, given her unmissable glow and petite frame.

 Ogaan apart, a lot is happening on the fashion front for Kavita. She is back from an important show in Tokyo last month where she was invited by the CII. And come September, Kavita is all set to showcase in Paris.

 I will be displaying my look for summer 2007 ? lots of neutrals and blacks ? splashed of course with brighter, typical Indian hues, says the designer, who was among the first to exploit the colour riot in fashion. 

 Though that was quite some time ago, Kavita believes colour remains her forte. Another thing I have mastered over the years is the combination of various fabrics to my advantage. Once that happened, fittings and immaculate styling naturally fell into place, says Kavita. 

 Another thing that she never fails to count as a blessing is her smooth access to karigars.

 But learning, she insists, is 

 a forever process. I still need to pick up the ropes 

 of marketing. Also, having stepped into the international 

 scene, I only wish I had done so way earlier.

 Cassinis Division depends on him, so does good old Hip Pocket. He is indispensable for Orient Express and the lifeline for Bhoomi, Cactus, Lakkhichhara and just about every other band in town that you can think of. 

 Meet Gautam Das, the man behind 

 Gautam Music (in picture), the one-stop shop for 

 percussionists. 

 From basic drum kits to gear for professional musicians, from darabukas to timbales an array of percussion instruments find space at Dass Sitaram Ghosh Street address in north Calcutta. 

 My customers are mainly from the popular music bands and students of drummers like Monojit Dutta and Nondon Bagchi. But I also get orders from studio musicians and other local bands, says Das, who learnt the tricks of the trade while working as an apprentice in a factory manufacturing parts of musical instruments. 

 By 1994, Das had had enough. Along with brother Abhijit, he started his shop. There has been no looking back since then. 

 I get at least five to six orders a month and am really happy with the response, says Das, pulling out a custom-made drum from a heap of instruments strewn all around the 8ft x 5ft room. 

 He specialises in drum kits and other percussion instruments like the bongo, conga, djembe, dhol and darabukas and timbales. Sold under the Gautam Music brand name, the range starts at Rs 5,000 and goes up to Rs 25,000, depending on specifications. Gautam even makes cases for the instruments. 

 We have very high, international-standard specifications and he is the only one around who comes close to meeting those, explains Monojit Dutta of Orient Express. 

 Dass reputation has spread far and wide, via word-of-mouth. Orders have started trickling in from Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Mumbai. With musicians from the US and Dubai also buying instruments from him, Das has started looking at markets beyond the shores. 

 According to Nondon Bagchi of Hip Pocket, Gautams instruments are better than the ones available in the music shops at Lalbazar. His kits are definitely better than what is availalbe off the shelf. In fact, if one is ready to pay and give him enough time, Das can deliver drum kits with international-quality sound.

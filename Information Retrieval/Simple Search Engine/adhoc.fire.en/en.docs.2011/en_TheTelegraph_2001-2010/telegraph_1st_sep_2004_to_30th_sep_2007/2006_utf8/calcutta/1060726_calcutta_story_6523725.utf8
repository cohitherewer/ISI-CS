 Mixed music in anniversary array

 Members of Indian 

 Ocean in performance

 The only live-music stop in town is turning 12. And the month-long celebrations at Someplace Else (SPE) will feature acts from around the country treating city music fans to a cocktail of rock, jazz and fusion.

 Every year we try to present a mix of popular and new bands on our anniversary. This year is extra special, offered Namrata Ray, manager, events and entertainment, The Park.

 Fusion outfit Indian Ocean will kick off the proceedings on July 29. The quartet of Asheem Chakroborty, Sushmit Sen, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam have played a few times before at SPE.

 Madhav Chari

A performance by jazz pianist-musician-composer Madhav Chari, supported by musicians Karl Peters and Adrian DSouza, would be up next on August 5. The virtuoso pianist had regaled the audience at Calcutta School of Music earlier this month and is set to return to Calcutta again in October, as part of his India tour.

 Bangalore-based rock outfit Thermal And A Quarter rounds off the out-of-towners list, with a performance on August 12. It will be the maiden city performance for the group comprising Bruce Lee Mani (guitars and vocals), Rajeev Rajagopal (drums), Rzhude David (bass and vocals), David Pascall (vocals) and Tony Das (guitar and vocals).

 Madhav Chari would be the first ever pianist weve hosted at SPE. It will be a by-invitation-only affair for a select audience. We had received several requests for Thermal And A Quarter from our regulars and this is a great opportunity to have them playing in Calcutta. Indian Ocean, of course, is a huge hit with the SPE crowd, Ray explained.

 A night with the best bands from the city is also on the cards, as are special T-shirts, coasters, cocktails and the customary cake-cutting to mark the occasion.

 Weve heard wonderful things about SPE from our friends in Skinny Alley. Weve also been told that the Calcutta crowd is great to play for. Were really looking forward to our first concert in the city, Bruce Lee Mani, vocalist and guitarist of Thermal And A Quarter told GoodLife from Bangalore. The 10-year-old band, with three albums to its credit, has just returned from a tour of the UK.

Hail, Helen the great 

Screen On amp; Off

 Helen at the Boogie 

 Woogie show: Down memory lane

 A kaleidoscope of colours, foot-tapping music, pulsating dance and a very special guest. The dancing queen of yesteryear, Helen, is the judge of the Cabaret Special episode of the popular dance show Boogie Woogie on Sony Entertainment Television.

 As the participants dance to her sizzling songs like Piya tu ab to aaja and Yeh mera dil, Helen takes a trip down memory lane, recounting the shooting of the song Yeh mera dil from Don. She had to go on a 15-day diet to fit into the costume specially designed for the dance number!

 Helen also clarifies some wrong notions about cabaret dancing. To her, cabaret dancing has a story to tell, a narrative that?s interesting and gripping. ?Dance must come from within. You start with a bang and end with a bang,? were her words of wisdom for the young performers.

 Boogie Woogie will rekindle memories of Helen the great on Friday, June 16, at 9 pm on Sony Entertainment Television.

 Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra: 

 Vote for the best

 Three Bollywood beauties battling for a crown and all it takes is a click of the mouse to get them to it. Online marketplace eBay India has recently launched eBay India Style Diva 2006, its maiden fashion and lifestyle contest. eBay India?s online community will decide the winner from among Kareena Kapoor, Bipasha Basu and Priyanka Chopra, through an online poll.

 To participate, one needs to log on to www.eBay.in and shop or sell any product from the various lifestyle categories using PaisaPay. After casting the vote, five lucky winners stand a chance to meet the eBay India Style Diva in person at the award function finale to be hosted in August in Mumbai.

 eBay India buyers can also win special merchandise of the contest for every purchase made during the promotion. The portal is seeing an increasing demand for lifestyle products bought online, as it currently averages the sale of a piece of jewellery every six minutes, a mobile handset every seven minutes, a piece of fashion apparel every 13 minutes and an MP3 player every 17 minutes.

 Red raja: Eveready brand ambassador 

 Amitabh Bachchan hits the small screen in a new avatar 

 to touch base with the product?s rural customers. The 

 newly-launched TV campaign, Kuch Hai Extra, has a set 

 of four commercials in different situations. Directed 

 by Parineeta maker Pradeep Sarkar, the ads find 

 innovative ways to exploit the enduring on-screen magic 

 of Amitabh.

 After a run at the box-office, Ghoom, MTV?s first film, will premiere on the channel on June 17, at 8 pm. Produced under the banner of MTV Fully Faltoo Films, this 45-minute comedy-action is a gag-a-minute spoof.

 Ghoom, with its wickedly twisted comic plot, has a stellar cast comprising Sumeet Raghavan known for his role in Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai, Ajay Gehi of Maqbool fame and Gaurav Kapoor, who?s done shows like Dil Kya Chahta Hai, along with Benika and Purbi Joshi.

 The plot, as close to Dhoom as it gets, is a riotous roller-coaster packed with funny cops-and-robbers chases, absurd wardrobe changes and silly romantic scenes. Ghoom is about this super-cop (read, blooper-cop) who wants to nab a gang of five biker thieves, who also double as pizza delivery guys, to hide their real vocation. He bullies a mechanic, who is as fast as them on the bike, into joining him. The mega robbery finally turns into a riot of idiotic incidents.

 Sony channels will finally be available on the direct-to-home platform, with SET Discovery announcing a distribution tie-up with Dish TV (the Zee-backed DTH service). With this arrangement, a number of channels from The One Alliance bouquet ? SET, MAX, Discovery Channel, Ten Sports, SAB, Discovery Travel amp; Living, AXN, Animax, MTV, PIX, Animal Planet and Nick ? will be available on the Dish TV DTH platform.

 Kunal Dasgupta, CEO, SET India, and chairman, SET Discovery, said: ?We expect significant growth in the subscriber base for Dish TV and for the DTH market in India due to this tie-up between SET Discovery and Dish TV.? Elaborating on the SET Discovery-Dish TV tie-up, Deepak Shourie, EVP amp; MD, Discovery Networks India and director, SET Discovery, said: ?This arrangement would enhance a Dish TV consumer?s television viewing experience and take it to a new level.?

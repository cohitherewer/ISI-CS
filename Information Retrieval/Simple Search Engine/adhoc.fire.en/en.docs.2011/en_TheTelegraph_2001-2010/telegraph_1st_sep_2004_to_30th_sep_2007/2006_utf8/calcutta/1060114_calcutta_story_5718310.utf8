The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam major makes a recce

 - MSO eye on cable pie via partnership with existing players

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 In January 2005, the Sun tried and failed to rise on the Calcutta cable scene. In January 2006, it?s time for Hathway to say Hello Calcutta.

 A team from the Rajan Raheja Group-controlled Hathway Datacom ? one of the largest multi-system operators (MSO) in the country ? met representatives of upcoming MSOs in the city on Friday with business plans for the city.

 The Maran-owned Sun Network from down South had made a similar attempt at entering the cable distribution business last year with an offer to buy out RPG Netcom, the then largest city MSO. But the deal fell through and RPG Netcom was taken over by the Zee-backed SitiCable, in May.

 Hathway, which has a presence in 10 Indian cities, however, is looking at forging partnerships with MSOs in the offing rather than buying into old ones.

 Though Hathway officials refused to divulge details, they did not deny the Calcutta recce. ?We are not planning an immediate entry into Calcutta, but a future foray cannot be ruled out,? said K. Jayaraman, CEO of Hathway Datacom. When asked if the company would buy out an existing MSO or start afresh, Jayaraman said: ?It is always better to start something new than go for existing set-ups.?

 At least three breakaway groups of cable operators ? cablemen from MSOs SitiCable, Manthan and CableComm ? in different parts of the city are planning MSO ventures of their own, including Kolkata Cable amp; Broadband Pariseba, Metro Broadband Services and Srishti. The three players plan to cover almost three lakh of the total 18 lakh cable households in the CMDA area.

 According to sources, Hathway has offered to make capital investment in at least one of the three MSOs and leave the management to the current promoters. Hathway is also promising a ?no switch-off policy?, something for beam-block wary Calcuttans to cheer about.

 The development is also significant since broadcaster STAR TV ? whose four channels are off-air on the SitiCable network owing to a dues dispute ? has a 26 per cent stake in Hathway.

 Sohini Haldar Sengupta in Nandikar?s production Bappaditya

 Day Ten was a fitting finale to the Nandikar National Theatre Festival. There had been quite a few brilliant performances from remote parts of the country and abroad, there had been a thought-provoking seminar and the exhibition held up many unknown sides of the national greats to whom Nandikar paid tribute. But the best was apparently saved for last. 

 Anyone wondering how effectively folk elements can be incorporated into contemporary productions needed only to see Binodini presented by Nasiruddin Yousuff of Dhaka. The Dhaka Theatre group has been making the most of folk narrative forms and music for some time, but here the blend was most attractive. They had used the kathakatha style of narration, but the words used were those from Binodini Dasi?s original autobiography Amar Katha. 

 The sole actor took turns narrating and acting the roles, stopping only to change costumes on stage. The play used minimal but suggestive props and a lot of folk music. The result was an amazing theatrical exercise and a glimpse of the continuing travails of actors.

 Swapnasandhani?s Bhalo Rakhosher Galpo was perfectly suited to the Christmas spirit. Based on a story by Jaya Mitra, the children?s play was a delightful interpretation of major environmental problems. Adults and children watched spellbound as the little good ogre went in search of Nadi (river), stolen by Shobchai Doitto (want-all giant). The masked scientist offering fruits and vegetables many times the original size, with golden threads inside to keep people from worrying about the missing Nadi, were clever pointers to the genetic engineering, freebee-loving modern age. 

 The play ends on an optimistic note with Bhalo Rakhosh flying away with the sick Nadi to a land of greenery. Veteran actress Chitra Sen as the know-all Jhinjhi Buri gave a memorable performance. The production proved once again how a large-scale use of gadgets is not necessary for a sophisticated multilayered presentation.

 The curtains came down with Nandikar?s own production Bappaditya, directed by Goutam Haldar. The play based on Abanindranath Tagore?s classic tale featured Sohini Haldar Sengupta in a solo act. With help from a chorus, Sohini flitted in and out of four roles: Bappaditya and the three women he loves. She breathed life into the charismatic character of Bappaditya, the charming prince who exudes both masculine vigour and feminine softness. Tapas Sen?s lights heightened the magical quality of the royal household and the meadows.

 Delhi is at present seeing a lot of Calcutta theatre. The 8th Bharat Rang Mahotsav from January 2-14 has many Calcutta entries. Rangakarmee staged Sarhad Paar Manto on January 4 at SRC and then with Naya Theatre premiered Visarjan at Kamani on January 5. Speaking to Metro from Delhi, Usha Ganguli said it had been ?Bhishon, bhishon bhalo.? 

 Nabamayukh Natyasangstha staged the musical Bhadreshwarir Galpo directed by Rishi Mukhopadhyay on January 5. 

 Coming up, on January 10, Apni Kon Dike directed by Arun Mukherjee will be staged. The production, which has had a couple of shows in Calcutta, is an adaptation of a Ronald Harwood play about a music conductor who took no sides during the Nazi era but was tried because he had stayed on in his hometown. 

 Saonli Mitra will perform Chandali on January 7 at Sammukh. On January 11, Bijon Theatre Samabay Prayas will present Kashmir Princess, directed by Bhibhas Chakravarty. 

 Nandikar will dominate with Gotraheen, Borda and Pata Jhore Jaye, all part of its regular repertoire, on January 12, 13 and 14. Natyaranga is scheduled to put up Agantuk directed by Swapan Sengupta on January 12.

 In Mumbai, Theatrecian, Calcutta?s English theatre troupe, performed Eugene Ionesco?s The Zoo Story at Prithvi theatre?s Yatri festival on January 3 and 4. Directed by Tanusree Das, it has third-year NUJS student Deborshi Barat and Tathagata Chowdhury in the lead.

 A perfect ensemble

 - GRAND PIANO WORKSHOP

 ?Did you know that Mozart was just nine when he composed this piece of music?? Nadia Lasserson asks the young girl, who has just played Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on the grand piano of Sandre Hall at the Calcutta School of Music (CSM). 

 The youngster, like the other participants of the workshop, is nervous. Nadia, organising secretary of the European Piano Teachers Association, from the UK, has quite a reputation both as teacher and performer.

 Having debuted in the Festival Hall at 16, Nadia has to her credit a wide repertoire of concertos and chamber music. With violinist Peter Fisher, she has played at various prestigious venues in Britain and elsewhere.

 She possesses the rare ability of making students feel at ease. Heaping praise on the participants, she leads them through variations in technique. By the time the group finishes exploring Hassler, it is an excited lot, ready to try out new things. And what Nadia is here to introduce ? Two Pianos, Four Hands ? was certainly new.

 Nadia believes that playing the much-neglected piano can be fun. From somewhat straight-jacketed recitals by isolated musicians, she is bent on making piano-playing a boisterous group experience. She has proved that there can be two, three or four musicians at one piano playing the same piece and one can keep on adding pianos to make a perfect ensemble. 

 Her book Piano Needn?t be Lonely ? a guide to over 400 pieces of chamber music and multi-piano repertoire ? is now in its second edition. She has produced a CD of all new works composed especially for the ensemble Piano 40 founded by her. To date, Piano 40 has a repertoire of 27 works, composed for eight hands on two pianos.

 At the CSM, Nadia has three teachers and three students to play together on two pianos. Starting hesitantly, the group soon learns how to collaborate and allow their individual playing flow together and create a colourful tapestry. ?This is something we have never seen before,? says one teacher.

 ?She explains music differently, making things so picturesque that they know exactly how the music should be,? says another. 

 A passing student sauntering into the hall, however, murmurs: ?Hey that?s so cool, man!? 

 Perhaps the three-day workshop will convince more youngsters to try out the instrument.

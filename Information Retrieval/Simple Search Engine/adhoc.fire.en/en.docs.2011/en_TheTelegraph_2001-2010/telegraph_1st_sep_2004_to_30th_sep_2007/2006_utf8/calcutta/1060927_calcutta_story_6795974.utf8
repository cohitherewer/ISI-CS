 Harvesting animosity

 Presented in the form of a folk narrative, Tritiyo Juddha tries in vain to make sense of the causes of war and bloodshed. The play begins on a note of joy and festivity, with villagers celebrating a harvest ritual. They worship the god of crops and dedicate their golden harvest to Him, after which they begin feasting and merry-making. During the celebration, a stranger appears in their midst. The hospitable villagers invite him to their feast. When they begin dancing, he feels that he cannot mingle with the crowd. He asks for a mask similar to the ones worn by the villagers. Soon, he mixes easily with the crowd and amuses the people with his activities. But he is found to be a miscreant as he kidnaps one of the villagers while they are celebrating. He also devours all the food meant for the feast, so that the villagers go hungry. As the villagers search for food, a strong hand appears and gives them bombs, initiating a fight amongst them. Direction: Probir Guha.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Tritiya Juddha, produced by Alternative Living Theatre 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

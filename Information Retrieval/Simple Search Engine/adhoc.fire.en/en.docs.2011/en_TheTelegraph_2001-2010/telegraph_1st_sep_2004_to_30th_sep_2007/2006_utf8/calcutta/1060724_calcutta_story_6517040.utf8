 What if... write or wrong

 Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota writer 

 UTTAM GADA claims that his entire script has been rewritten 

 by Naseeruddin Shah with atrocious consequences, writes Pratim

 His first film is being hailed 

 across the country but out of nowhere, Naseeruddin Shah 

 has found an unlikely adversary ? the writer of his directorial 

 debut Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota. Little-known Gujarati 

 playwright Uttam Gada is busy dashing off open letters claiming 

 that ?the incompetent, unaesthetic and at times atrocious 

 writing that has gone into Yun Hota?? is not his.

 ?He (Naseeruddin) has changed 

 more than 80 per cent of the script written by me and although 

 I was promised by the producer that the writing credits 

 would be shared by Naseerbhai and me, it reads ?Written 

 by Uttam Gada?,? the fuming theatre veteran tells Metro 

 from Mumbai.

 ?I do not want to sue him or anything. 

 I just want to clear my reputation that has been built on 

 years of hard work. I have to let people know that I did 

 not write that stuff,? he adds.

 Uttam, who has been doing plays 

 for years now, got into screenwriting a couple of years 

 back with Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota. ?Ketan Mehta was 

 quite keen to do my script but he couldn?t take out time 

 then because of The Rising,? the writer reveals. 

 ?Now Paresh is a dear friend and the two of us have been 

 working together for a long time. So through him I learnt 

 that Naseerbhai was contemplating doing a film and 

 was looking for a script. I sent him mine and he called 

 back saying that he loved it and was definitely making it.?

 The two then spent some time together 

 discussing the finer details of the script. While Shah had 

 told Metro that he ?developed? the script, Uttam 

 claims that his was a ready script. ?It was not an idea 

 or a brief synopsis,? he stresses. ?It was a bound script 

 with dialogues and everything. I am not saying that it couldn?t 

 have been tweaked around. I am sure there was scope for 

 improvisation but you can?t possibly develop or rewrite 

 the whole script.?

 But why did he agree to such modifications 

 in the first place? ?Initially, Naseerbhai suggested 

 some changes, which, I told him clearly, wouldn?t work because 

 they were not jelling with the characters, the subjects 

 and the storyline,? Uttam says. ?I would have loved it had 

 he taken my script five degrees higher but he was obviously 

 on a different plane. I did object and resist, and eventually 

 told him that he was damaging the script.?

 It was at this stage that the 

 gulf between writer and director deepened. Says Uttam: ?He 

 told me, ?Now you have done your job. Let me take over as 

 the director. Let me make the film from my point of view. 

 I have handled more than 200 screenplays. So, just rest 

 assured, I know what I am doing?.?

 Uttam stayed mum. ?I hoped, just 

 hoped, that something better would emerge out of it,? he 

 says. ?I have a lot of respect for him as an artiste and 

 I really thought that he would be able to do the job. Even 

 when I was on the sets a couple of times, I didn?t say a 

 thing.?

 But when Uttam finally saw the 

 film a week back, he ?was shocked?. ?The content, the characters, 

 even the stories had completely changed,? he sounds violated. 

 ?The entire structure had fallen apart. The four separate 

 stories were designed with an objective in mind and with 

 them running parallel it was a very delicate balance. That 

 is completely lost in the film.?

 Uttam feels there are so many 

 changes that he can go on talking about them all day but 

 he does pick a couple of examples to rest his case. ?What 

 was the need to replace a middle-class Marwari mother-in-law 

 with an American woman (in the Jimmy-Konkona story)? And 

 change the stockbroker from a regular north Indian to a 

 drug-snorting Muslim (in the Irrfan-Saroj Khan story)?

 ?I always felt that Naseerbhai?s 

 directorial debut was an important event for the film industry,? 

 says Uttam. ?I felt that the structure would work even if 

 some of the bricks were removed. But having seen the film, 

 I can tell you that the impact is not there. When I used 

 to just read my script to prospective producers and directors, 

 the impact was stronger. It?s all lost.?

 As Uttam now sets out to write 

 for Priyadarshan and Ketan Mehta, he just can?t get rid 

 of the bitter Yun Hota... experience. ?I want to 

 set an example for other writers so that they can protect 

 their rights in the future,? he proclaims. ?Steven Spielberg 

 once said that if the writers stop writing, the whole of 

 Hollywood will be jobless. In our Rs 15,000-crore industry, 

 is there any importance given to the writers??

 Naseeruddin Shah and Uttam Gada 

 had met a couple of days back at a press conference for 

 the film and the two, expectedly, didn?t exchange a word. 

 And the first-time director, expectedly again, didn?t want 

 to talk about the writing row. 

 But when he had spoken to Metro 

 about the movie, he had mentioned: ?After Yun Hota... 

 I know my weak links and would certainly rectify them 

 before making another film. I will need better advice on 

 the scripting, for one.?

 Yun hota toh...

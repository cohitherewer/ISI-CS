 Families suffer as flesh trade spreads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Raja Mukherjee, 19, is a first-year B.Com student. He broke down before the detective departments deputy commissioner while describing how his family has been ostracised. He said even his private tutors have refused to visit his home. All because the building next door will turn into a brothel.

 Raja is not alone. Many other residents of Sonagachhi have been suffering due to the spread of the flesh trade in the area. The student, whose family has been staying in Sonagachhi for almost a century, has been forced to seek help from police, the chief ministers office and the local MP.

 Problems for the family started after brothel-owner Sushila Singh purchased a four-storeyed building in the area. Families used to reside in the house even six months ago. Singh announced recently that a high-profile brothel would be started there on January 1.

 The brothel-owners have been steadily expanding their business. One of them has bought a building next to our house. Soon, we will not be able to open our windows, rued Raja.

 Neighbours have joined hands with the family in seeking help from the authorities. A group of 40 local residents submitted a memorandum to local MP Sudhangshu Sil, the chief ministers office and the local police station, requesting steps to curb the spread of the flesh trade.

 There are buildings in Sonagachhi where prostitution rackets are being run for decades. We havent ever protested against the activities there. But we are against the spread of the business. The few families that have not left the area are at the mercy of the brothel-owners, said a local resident.

 The buildings occupied by families have boards hanging at the entrance, proclaiming: Grihasta bari, probesh koriben na (Household, do not enter).

 We do this to prevent drunks from entering the house thinking it is a brothel. It is difficult to imagine how unsavoury the situation is, explained another resident.

 Raja, who met deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh with his grandmother Namita, told him: There are students from Class II to the graduation level in the house. We will suffer when the building next door turns into a brothel. Our private tutors have categorically said they will not visit us then.

 Singh promised assistance to Raja. We will do the needful for the families in the area. They have every right to live there, he said. 

 The chief ministers office has also responded favourably to the memorandum.

 Uttam Pramanik, office secretary 

 of RSP-backed Paschimbanga Kararakshi Samity, has been serving 

 as a warder at Presidency jail since 1990. A couple of months 

 ago, he was seriously injured in a gang fight inside the 

 jail. A probe revealed that the warders have formed two 

 groups and are in touch with criminals lodged in the jail 

 Ranjit Biswas, warder and vice-president 

 of RSP-backed Paschimbanga Kararakshi Samity, has been posted 

 at Presidency jail for over 10 years

 Abdul Wahab Dhali, warder and 

 joint secretary of CPM-backed Kararakshi Samity Paschimbanga, 

 has been posted at Presidency jail for more than 15 years

 In violation of a government notification, eight warders at Presidency jail have not been transferred for over 10 years. They are backed by unions affiliated to the CPM and the RSP, state jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury?s party. 

 In an attempt to weed out corruption, the state government had issued a circular in 2001 stating that nobody should be posted at one jail for more than five years. 

 According to a senior jail official, the warders serving at a jail for longer than the stipulated period often call the shots and indulge in malpractice. ?They are backed by the unions and have formed groups in connivance with the criminals lodged in the jail. But the administration has turned a blind eye to the problem,? he said.

 ?The notification was the right step towards cleansing the jails, but it was never enforced,? the official added. 

 Jail minister Chowdhury said: ?I have asked for a detailed report from the inspector-general (prisons) regarding each jail employee and the duration of his/her posting at a particular jail.? 

 Asked why warders owing allegiance to the CPM and the RSP unions have been posted at Presidency jail for several years, Chowdhury said: ?I recently came to know about this. The union leaders always request us not to transfer them since it will affect the office work. But nobody would be spared now.? 

 B.D. Sharma, inspector-general (prisons), refused to comment.

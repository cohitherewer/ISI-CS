The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green glory, fairway fun

 Club sandwich

 Brandon D Souza, who heads 

 Tiger Sports Management, driving the Indian Golf Tour, speaks 

 to Subhro Saha on the evolution of the Merchants 

 Cup Golf tournament.

 What prompted you to come forward and promote this meet?

 As far as inter-company events 

 are concerned, golf is the oldest discipline, and this meet 

 was started way back in 1906. Apart from the two World Wars, 

 this event has never not happened. Six years ago, when 

 we were approached to get involved, I took it gleefully. 

 Being a Calcutta boy, I had a selfish reason, because I 

 had honed my skills as a golfer here and my entire family 

 plays golf. But in the larger context, I always believed 

 in the product.

 How has this Merchants Cup evolved over the years?

 The beauty here is traditionally, 

 every major corporate always had four people on the rolls 

 who played golf, because Calcutta was a corporate city. 

 This has all been eroded and then we went to companies who 

 said hey, we dont have four guys, we have three or two. 

 So we took the format and tweaked it in the last six years. 

 It has increased the number of teams, increased the involvement 

 of small, mid-cap and big companies and I think eventually 

 we are on the right track again.

 Can you elaborate on the technical changes made in the tournament 

 format?

 At one stage, there was only one 

 category, called the Merchants Cup, split into three divisions. 

 You had to have four guys who had to be full-time employees 

 and they would have to go out and play a full 18 holes of 

 golf. Over a period of time, we have modified it and also 

 tried to bridge the gap between teams. One is we made it 

 three out of four scores. But the biggest difference we 

 have made is to have the handicap enclosure up to 6. You 

 are allowed to discard your worst hole and go back to par 

 on that hole. From 7 to 15 handicap, you are allowed to 

 discard your worst two holes and from 16 to 24, you are 

 allowed to discard three holes and go back to par.

 What is the ultimate objective of all this rule juggling?

 The ultimate objective is to go 

 back to the glory days when it was a wanted event to get 

 invited to, it was a black-tie dinner, you went there in 

 your tailcoat with your bow-tie on. Maybe, we are still 

 some distance away from that, but at least a semblance of 

 respectability has returned to the event. We have been fortunate 

 that someone like B.M. Khaitan has fronted the effort. At 

 the end of the day, it has helped because this is definitely 

 an influence on companies like Tata Steel, Tata Tea or ITC 

 companies we need involved. Along with it, this year, 

 when we see an entrant like Cognizant (Technology Solutions), 

 its exciting, not because they are great golfers, but because 

 Cognizant is tomorrow.

 Has the field been diluted over time?

 Look at the history of the best 

 amateurs of the country. Besides Lakshman Singh (picture 

 above by Santosh Ghosh) and Alan Singh, we also had 

 Vikramjit Singh, Manjit Singh and Billoo Sethi. They were 

 all part of Calcuttas corporate structure, playing for 

 companies like Tatas, Duncans, Phillips Carbon Black, Metal 

 Box, ICI Why cant their replacements in their respective 

 companies take their positions in the Merchants Cup too? 

 We are leaving no stone unturned to ensure everybody is 

 in the loop. What I worry about is what Vijay Amritraj says 

 about our tennis: why cant we produce a second line of 

 golfers?

 But is the outlook bright, nevertheless?

 Im excited the Asian Junior Masters 

 is happening at the Royal (RCGC). But eventually, if my 

 corporates dont get back into the game and my corporate 

 managers are not playing, I dont have a hope in hell. Its 

 a chicken-and-egg story. Every sport in India cannot be 

 cricket. Why cant golf be a second substitute, which is 

 what Im aiming for. That is why when we spread the good 

 news of a Jeev (Milkha Singh) doing well or a Shiv Kapur 

 doing well, or a Jyoti (Randhawa) doing well, we believe 

 its because they need to be glorified and made household 

 names.

 What to you were the highlights of this edition? Are the 

 changes working?

 The highlights this time were 

 McLeod Russels stranglehold being broken by Madhya Bharat 

 Papers, Oil India entering the fray, and lots of lady executives 

 coming to the party. Thats a good sign because we want 

 it to become a unisex event.

 The biggest difference we made 

 in the format was for companies who couldnt put up four 

 players, we started a Challenge Cup, where there could be 

 two people from one organisation nominating two others. 

 You suddenly have a single businessman, a sole proprietor, 

 playing for his friends team, feeling part of it and coming 

 to the party. Winning is important, but you cant miss the 

 focus of having fun. Thats what the Merchants Cup is all 

 about.

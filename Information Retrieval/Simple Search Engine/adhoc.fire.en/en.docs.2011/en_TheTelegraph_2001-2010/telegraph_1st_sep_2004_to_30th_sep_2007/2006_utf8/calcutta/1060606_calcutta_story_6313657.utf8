The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Glad beeline for helpline

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An anxious Deboshmita Das called up The Telegraph Higher Secondary Helpline at 10.15 am on Monday. When she rattled off her roll number, the friendly operator promptly told her the aggregate: 906.

 ?The service was very prompt. I got through in the second attempt and found out my total without even having to head for the nearest cyber cafe,? said the student of Bidhannagar Government High School.

 Deboshmita was among the 16,000 students (till six in the evening) who dialled the 20 dedicated lines set up by The Telegraph to assist Higher Secondary students.

 All that the students needed to do was dial one of the 20 numbers and state his/her roll number to the operator who, in turn, would give the division and the aggregate with the click of a mouse.

 ?Both my friend and myself called up The Telegraph Helpline to know our results. We called as soon the lines opened at 10 am. We did not face any difficulty,? declared Zeenat-ul-Firdausi of Bhangar Higher Secondary School, South 24-Parganas.

 On June 2, more than 25,000 students had dialled The Telegraph Madhyamik Helpline to know their results.

 ?I read about The Telegraph Helpline when the Madhyamik results were announced. I decided I would also use the same hassle-free Helpline to know my Higher Secondary results. I called up one of the numbers at 11 am and got to know my results,? said Anandarup Ghosh of Bangur Boys High School.

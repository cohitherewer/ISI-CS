The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Off to Europe for Christmas

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Better connectivity, lesser visa hassles and cheaper fares are luring Calcuttans to Europe for a White Christmas.

 Sources in the travel industry expect a 18 to 20 per cent jump, compared with last year, in the tourist flow from Calcutta to Europe this Christmas. Last year, around five per cent of the tourists flying abroad from the east had opted for Europe.

 Southeast Asia continues to be the biggest attraction, but a lot of tourists are preferring Europe this winter, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 According to Punjabi, introduction of Lufthansas direct flight from Calcutta to Frankfurt is one reason for the spurt in the tourist flow to Europe. For the past few years, London was the only European city connected directly from Calcutta. 

 Earlier, a tourist would require a UK transit visa for flying to other European cities from London. But now they can travel directly, he pointed out.

 Competitive fares and packages are providing tourists with an opportunity to experience a White Christmas in Europe. Tourists are also showing interest in winter sports, said Sanjoy Sett, managing director, Globe Forex and Travels. 

 Lufthansa has announced a special introductory return fare of Rs 19,900 (plus taxes) on the Calcutta-Frankfurt route. A boarding incentive of Rs 2,000 is on offer for those buying tickets till November 15 for specific destinations. 

 Since the airline connects 143 cities in 39 countries across Europe, it is expected to draw good traffic from this part of the country, said C.A. Nanjappa, Lufthansa general manager, passenger sales, eastern India. Bookings for December are picking up and for January, its already 80 per cent.

 Lufthansa is also offering a special package for its first-class passengers. They will get a limousine pick-up from the aircraft to the terminal in Frankfurt, Nanjappa said.

 Emirates has registered encouraging bookings from Calcutta to Europe, Africa and the US. British Airways flights to London for December and January are almost full, sources said. The airline is offering a return fare of Rs 21,000 (plus taxes) for Europe and Rs 20,000 (plus taxes) for London.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell first, death can wait

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Motorcyclist Surojit Bhattacharjee, 

 35, was reportedly talking on his cellphone when a bus crushed 

 him to death at the Jawaharlal Nehru Road-Exide crossing 

 on Tuesday afternoon. His death has not deterred pedestrians 

 and motorists from flouting the law and risking their lives, 

 by using cellphones on the road. Metro 

 revisited the accident site 24 hours later to find little 

 had changed.

 Scene I: A middle-aged woman crossing the road, talking on her cellphone. She is so engrossed in conversation that she does not notice the traffic light turn green. Vehicles whiz past her. In desperation, she makes a dash for the footpath.

 When Metro caught up with her, she said: Look, I am in a hurry. I am going to Nandan for a (film festival) movie and cannot talk to you now.

 Scene II: A father crosses the road with his six-year-old son. Halfway, he receives a call on his cellphone. Regardless of the risk, he lets go his sons hand to take the call (picture above by Bishwarup Dutta). A traffic constable watches them, but does not react.

 When Metro stopped him, he retorted: What can I do? I got a call from office and had to take it. But when told he should have been fined for flouting a road rule, he said: I was not aware that talking on the cellphone attracts a fine. I will never do this again. 

 The constable who had watched them wasnt so sure. We used to fine drivers and pedestrians for using a cellphone on the road, but nobody cares. This is a busy crossing and I have to manage traffic. Offenders argue a lot if they are asked to pay a fine. It is a waste of time, he shrugged.

 Scene III: Over to traffic sergeants. At 2.20 pm, around the time of Tuesdays mishap, a sergeant of South Traffic Guard speeds down the crossing on his motorcycle, cellphone glued to ear.

 When Metro asked him why, he shot back: I have to be in touch with other sergeants. 

 The danger posed to him and others by being mobile on the mobike be damned.

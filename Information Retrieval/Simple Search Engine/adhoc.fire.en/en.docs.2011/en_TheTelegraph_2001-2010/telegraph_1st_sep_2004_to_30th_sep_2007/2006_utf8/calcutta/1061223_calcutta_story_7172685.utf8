 Realm of darkness

 The first women to have stepped on the Bengali stage were from the citys red-light areas, who contributed much to the blossoming of theatre. With time, the attitude towards women acting on stage changed for the better. Today, women actors are a part of mainstream society, and live with honour and dignity. Yet, the darkness and prejudice shrouding red-light areas continues as before. Written by Leena Gangopadhyay, Lalbati Nilbati focuses on the pathetic lives of the women who live and work here. Unfolding the daily trauma of their existence, it presents a starkly realistic portrayal of their survival and optimism for a better future in the midst of the torture, exploitation, abuse and violence that they are subject to, everyday. Often forced into joining the profession, they are not only looked down upon by society, but also disowned by their families, who find them an embarrassment to their respectability. Their personal tragedy is also made deeper by an organised social hypocrisy. Direction: Kabir Sen Barat.

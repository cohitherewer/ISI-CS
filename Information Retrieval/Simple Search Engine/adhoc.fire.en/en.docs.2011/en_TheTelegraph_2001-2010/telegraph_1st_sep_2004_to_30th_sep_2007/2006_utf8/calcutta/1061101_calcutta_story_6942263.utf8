 Con duo netted for shoplift

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A city couple that tried to do a Bunty Aur Babli ran out of luck on Monday. The two had stolen two diamond bangles worth Rs 1,11,900 from a showroom on Park Street. 

 The owner had no inkling about the theft, but the closed-circuit television in the shop caught the two in the act, leading to their arrest.

 According to police, the con couple Navjot Singh, 26, and Nisha Singh, 23 had been involved in several thefts in city shops. 

 Both had a lavish lifestyle and were regulars at discotheques. They footed their bills by stealing, said an officer of Park Street police station.

 Clad in jeans and T-shirt, the two visited the store on Park Street on October 28. They remained inside for over half-an-hour and browsed around. They asked the attendant to show them bangles. When he was not looking, Nisha lifted two diamond bangles and put them inside her handbag. Some employees later noticed that the bangles were missing and told the owner, said another officer. 

 Nisha was arrested at a five-star address on EM Bypass on Monday night, while Navjot was later taken into custody at a Free School Street hotel. 

 We have found out that Nisha was from Mumbai. She met Navjot, a resident of Howrah, at a discotheque about a year ago. They soon started living together. The diamond bangles and other gold jewellery were seized from them, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee.

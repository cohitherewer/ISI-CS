 Sapphire Creations, along with Saathii, Sparsha, Prantakatha and Sanlaap, observes International Candlelight Memorial Day to honour the memory of those lost to HIV/AIDS and those living with this deadly disease. Besides a candlelight ceremony and an interactive session with victims, Sapphire Creations will present the Calcutta premiere of Positive Lives, a dance-visual montage that seeks to eliminate the stigma associated with this life-threatening condition, allowing those afflicted to lead lives with dignity. An abstract dance composition, it was inspired by real-life stories, anecdotes and case histories of courageous individuals who have perfected the art of survival despite agony, alienation and severe trauma. Through a unique blend of dance, music and photography, the performance traces the growth of positivism in their minds, which enables them to live wholeheartedly when death seems the only answer to life. Also, a dance presentation on HIV/AIDS issues by Sanlaap.

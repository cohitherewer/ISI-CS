 Angelina Jolie with Anderson 

 Cooper: Time to talk

 In her first television interview since the birth of her daughter, Angelina Jolie speaks with CNN?s Anderson Cooper about her work with refugees in Africa and around the world, as well as the birth of her daughter in Namibia last month. The exclusive interview airs at 7.30 am on CNN International on Wednesday, June 21, as part of a special edition of Anderson Cooper 360? marking World Refugee Day. 

 The star, whose daughter Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt was born on May 27 in Namibia, speaks about her plans of adopting more children. Jolie?s adopted 15-month-old daughter Zahara is from Ethiopia, and son Maddox, 4, is from Cambodia.

 Jolie said she had given birth in Namibia because she loved Africa and had wanted to bring Zahara back to Africa. ?My other daughter?s African. And I wanted to take her back to Africa,? she said in the interview to be aired on the CNN programme. 

 Jolie said she was frightened during the birth, which was by Caesarean section because the baby was in a breech position. Partner Brad Pitt was in the operating room for the delivery, she said.

 ?And you know, because you?re there for the birth, which I wasn?t for my first two kids, you?re just suddenly terrified that they?re not gonna take a first breath,? she said. ?That was my whole focus. I just wanted to hear her cry. And I was sure everything would go right at the last minute I became the mother that was sure everything was gonna go wrong. And she?s healthy, and it was amazing.?

 The Oscar-winning actress, who gives a third of her income to refugees and other causes, is a goodwill ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. ?I had a stupid income for what I do,? she said.

 The money does make a difference and Jolie does see change. She said she feels ?lucky? because she is able to visit the places that receive her money.

 ?I can meet some people who say, ?God, we really need a well, or these cars are broken. And I can go back a year later and see it built or see the cars.?

 When: Saturday noon.

 Take a look: While the entire city gears up for the Pujas, Saturday morning saw this star hotel preparing for Christmas. And the XMas cake mixing ceremony at the hotel had a very special guest, tennis star Sunitha Rao, who joined general manager Ranvir Bhandari, area manager (east) Kuljit Rekhi and chefs to prepare the mix.

 Donning an apron, a chefs cap and gloves, Sunitha was ready for the role. I am enjoying every bit of it, smiled the sporty siren.

 Fruits, nuts, dried spices, essences and liquor like brandy and dark rum went into the mix.

 Fashion gala

 What: Gala night of AET (formerly known as American Eagle Tankers) seminar.

 Where: Pala at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers. 

 When: Friday evening.

 Take a look: The three-day seminar ended with a gala featuring a fashion show and a performance by VJ Anouskha and Samrat. The evening kicked-off with the fashion show choreographed by Nicola Gomes. In sync with the theme Brides of India designers Anita Sureka, Rajashi Mukherjee and Kishore Punjabi showcased bridal drapes from Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Bengal and south India. 

 Models Jessica, Priyanka, Tanushree and others sashayed pretty saris, salwar suits and lehngas worked upon with intricate embroidery, sequins and stonework. There was also a line of smart cocktail dresses. In between, Foot Tappers entertained the audience with their dance movements.

 VJ Anoushka, the former VIVA hottie, hit it off with the crowd instantly. She belted out chartbusters like sharabi, Parde mein rahne do and the Abba hit Mama mia. Next, Samrat sang a few Punjabi hip-hop numbers. Then Anoushka was back on stage and got the crowd grooving to Bidi and Dus bahane.

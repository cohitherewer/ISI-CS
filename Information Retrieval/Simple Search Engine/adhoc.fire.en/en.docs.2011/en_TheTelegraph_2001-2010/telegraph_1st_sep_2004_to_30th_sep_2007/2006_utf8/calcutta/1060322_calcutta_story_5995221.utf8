The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bus, auto and poison air

 - ADB environment study pins blame on tailpipe emission

 JAYANTA BASU

 The poison that Calcutta breathes is mostly the gift of buses and autorickshaws. This fume fact has been borne out by figures in a study supported by the state government.

 While belching buses account for 35 per cent of the city?s overall vehicular pollution, the auto is the villain in a supporting role, with 32 per cent of the foul figure.

 Experts from the country and abroad, along with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), had carried out the study, titled Strengthening Environmental Management at the State Level ? Air Quality Management.

 These findings had been submitted 

 to the government in March 2005, in the form of an interim 

 report.

 Based on data collected in 2003, the study points out that buses and autos together breathe more than 20,000 metric tonnes of pollutants into the air every year.

 While buses contribute 67 per cent of the respiratory particulate matter (RPM) and 73 per cent of the nitrogen oxides to the ambient air, autos lead the polluting pack in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission, at 69 and 43 per cent, respectively.

 The ADB report is in line with the findings of a recent Central Pollution Control Board study, which points out that the nitrogen oxide levels in certain pockets of the Calcutta Metropolitan Area rank among the toxic toppers in the country (published in The Telegraph on Monday).

 ?The nitrogen oxide levels are increasing consistently over the past few years, indicating a rise in pollution caused by diesel-run commercial vehicles,? says an environment department official.

 And the blame lies largely with the tail pipes of buses and autos, with the government fighting shy of forcing them to switch to a green fuel and spare the environment.

 The annual emission of respiratory particulate matter (RPM) in the city, as revealed by the ADB study, is 15,810 tonnes, about 10 times higher than the Pune figure of 1,501 tonnes, where a similar exercise was carried out. 

 The report spells doom for the city if effective measures are not taken immediately to control RPM tailpipe emission. Unchecked, the emission may turn Calcutta into a gas chamber by 2014, experts warn.

 And what do all these figures mean for the health of the Calcuttan? More malady, more mortality. The report estimates that more than 2,100 people will die prematurely by 2014 because of vehicular pollution.

 Viewing photography from a social perspective, Shibnath Basu strongly believes that images of real-life as captured by the camera present an authentic reflection of contemporary life and society. Being inaugurated this evening at 6, Life is Beautiful, an exhibition that marks the silver jubilee of his endeavours with the lens, offers a kaleidoscopic view of a vast and vibrant India with its diverse traditions and cultures. Comprising 65 20 in. x 30 in. colour prints aesthetically mounted on frames, it promises to provide a unique experience combining thoughts, stories, cinema and even music. Images of lush landscapes, majestic mountains and golden sands are beautifully complemented with pictures of lively youths and maidens, as well as festivals and rituals that offer a glimpse of the peoples lifestyle. Besides, there will be three slide shows daily from 6 pm onwards that brilliantly capture the soul of India.

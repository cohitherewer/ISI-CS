 Arya Vaidya Sala, the century-old ayurveda hospital of Kottakkal, is set to open a multi-speciality clinic and research centre in the city. The 300-bed hospital, the first of its kind in eastern India, will come up on a 24-acre plot near Joka. The Arya Vaidya Sala has another facility in Delhi.

 ?Work is on in full swing. We expect to open the hospital in May,? hospital spokesperson T.P. Ravindran told Metro.

 ?On an average, about 1,000 people from Calcutta visit our Kottakkal centre every year for ayurvedic treatment. We are establishing a hospital in the city so that people here don?t have to spend time and money travelling to Kerala,? Ravindran added. Patients from Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa, Assam and Bangladesh will be able to avail of the Calcutta unit, observed the spokesperson.

 Officials of Arya Vaidya Sala said patients often need to wait a couple of months to gain admission in the Kottakkal hospital. The kin are, thus, forced to spend a long period away from home in hotels.

 According to the plan, the Calcutta clinic will have airconditioned and non-airconditioned rooms, cottages and special wards, in addition to a medicine centre, canteen, travel desk, cyber caf?, conference hall, library, an indoor games room and transit facilities to the airport, rail stations and patients? homes.

 There will be an outdoor department, where specialists will be available for consultation. The hospital will also organise camps on different diseases. Specialists from India and abroad will be part of the research team. 

 ?We could have set up the hospital in the heart of the city as we do not have a dearth of funds or specialists. We chose Joka as such a facility needs to be surrounded by greenery and located at a place free from pollution,? explained Ravindran.

 Ayurveda specialists claim that paralysis, rheumatism, arthritis, spondylosis, hysteria, neurological disorders and age-related ailments can be cured by ayurvedic treatment. 

 The medicines are cheaper than allopathic ones and do not have side effects.

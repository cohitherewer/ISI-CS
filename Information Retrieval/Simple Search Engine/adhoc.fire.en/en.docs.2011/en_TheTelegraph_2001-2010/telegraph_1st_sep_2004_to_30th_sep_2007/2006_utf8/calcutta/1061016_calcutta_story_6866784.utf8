 Heres to a hookah high

 1775: English author William Hickey arrives in Calcutta and writes in his memoirs: Here everybody uses a hookah, and it is impossible to get on without (I) have frequently heard men declare they would much rather be deprived of their dinner than their hookah.

 2006: The legacy lives on at 22 Camac Street as Shisha The Hookah Bar celebrates three years of partying, lounging and having a good time.

 On Thursday night, too, as Hickey would have surely noted, it was impossible to get on without a spell of shisha (hookah in Arabic).

 It would otherwise be impossible to imagine hundreds of party people doing their thing till the small hours of Friday the 13th, but then this was a special Shisha night.

 From Hotel California to California Dreamin, the birthday night saw the very best of party music flowing from the 1970s to the today variety before settling into the grunge groove. DJ Girish juggled his act in musics mission impossible keeping everyone from Bhangra addicts to soul devotees to Bollywood buffs going on the same floor.

 Indulge in the finest read the invitation card and it was difficult to do otherwise, with Jack Daniels and Chivas Regal for company. Spirits flowed smooth and soared high as guests trickled into a gush for the good ol Shisha family to make it a night to remember.

 If the wine list at Shisha did not disappoint, the midnight buffet at Ivory (Grain of Salt by a new name) hit bulls eye. From Tom Yum Soup and Prawn Cocktail to Betki in Lemon Butter and Lamb in Hoisin Sauce, the spread was sumptuous with a capital S. Rounding it off was Chocolate Mousse and Ginger Peach Ice Cream, but nothing tasted better than the birthday cake a rich chocolate gateaux with more than a smack of strawberry.

 Calcutta nights have surely never been the same ever since Shisha got us hooked to the hookahs. Ask Abhishek Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan

 The indulgence goes on. When Thursday night is called a curtain raiser, what do you do? Just take up the diary or PDA and book your New Years Eve with the hookah haunt. As manager Sovan Mukherjee whispered: We have already started planning and this December 31 is something you have never seen before, as Alibabas 40 Thieves visit us after dark.

 Open Shisha, did we hear you say?

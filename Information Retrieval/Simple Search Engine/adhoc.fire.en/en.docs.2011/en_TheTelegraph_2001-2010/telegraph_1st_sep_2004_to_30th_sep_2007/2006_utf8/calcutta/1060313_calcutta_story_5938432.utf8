 Pond-fill rap on realty

 The landfill net cast by the civic authorities just got wider with a 150-cottah waterbody as the latest catch.

 Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has alleged that the pond at 3 and 4, Mahendra Roy Lane, off the EM Bypass, is being filled by a private company despite being served a notice under the Town and Country Planning Act.

 The Topsia plot ? the biggest in recent records to be filled up and with a market price of Rs 20 crore-plus ? has been barricaded with corrugated tin by the promoters and a security agency appointed to guard it. A board reads: ?This property belongs to M/s Bharat Overseas Private Limited. Mrs Poornima Jain, 6B, Clive Row (ground floor)?.

 Poornima Jain?s husband Aloke Jain, however, denied any attempt at landfill. ?We are only protecting our property from encroachment. If allowed, we will construct a 20-storeyed building after the Assembly elections,? he said.

 Jain asserted that the plot was never a waterbody and has been marked as a ?low-lying area? in the civic body?s inspection book.

 Chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma refuted Jain?s claim: ?We need not consult our records when the waterbody, full of fish, is visible to the eye.?

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Thursday that CMC would soon take over the ?management and control? of the waterbody under Section 17A of the Inland Fisheries Act, 2006. It would then be re-excavated, for the fisheries department to start pisciculture.

 Local councillor and CMC leader of Opposition Javed Khan pointed out that the waterbodies at East Calcutta Boating Club and Captain Bheri are identified as low-lying areas in the civic records. ?If the Topsia pond is filled up, others can?t be saved,? he warned.

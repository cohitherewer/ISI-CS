 Isolated incidents of violence marked Mondays 12-hour bandh called by Trinamul Congress. A woman and a CSTC bus driver were injured in attacks by bandh supporters. 

 Air and rail passengers suffered the most due to the shutdown. Many were stranded at the airport and railway stations due to non-availability of public transport and overcharging by taxis.

 Participants of a bandh procession by Trinamul and Samajwadi Party started throwing bricks at a CSTC bus near the crossing of Canning Street and Brabourne Road around 11 am, breaking its windscreen. The driver sustained an injury on the chest but managed to drive the bus to Burrabazar police station. Two people were arrested on the spot. 

 Kumkum Chatterjee, 54, of Banamali Naskar Road, in Behala, was injured when bandh supporters threw stones and bricks at the minibus she was travelling in. She was admitted to a private hospital.

 According to police, about 2,000 people were arrested in different parts of the city and its suburbs for trying to enforce the bandh. 

 The attendance at Writers Buildings was dismal on Monday, with less than a quarter of the workforce turning up. Government officials, including home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray, pegged the attendance at 40 per cent. 

 Flights at the airport were not disrupted, though passengers arriving complained of cabbies fleecing them. I have been waiting here for four hours. The taxi fare to my destination in Behala is about Rs 200, but the drivers are asking for more than Rs 500. There are no taxis at the pre-paid booth, said Ashok Sen, who landed in the city from Houston, US.

 The situation was almost the same at the railway stations, though train services were disrupted only sporadically. At Rishra, on the Howrah-Bandel section, Trinamul supporters disrupted services for about four hours in the morning. 

 Metro services were normal through the day, though fewer trains were run because of lack of passengers.

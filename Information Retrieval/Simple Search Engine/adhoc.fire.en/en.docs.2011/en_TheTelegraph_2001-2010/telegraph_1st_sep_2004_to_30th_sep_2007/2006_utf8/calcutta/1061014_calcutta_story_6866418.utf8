 Chorus of colours

 Music and nature are the main sources of inspiration for artist Vinitha Anand, who has come all the way from Trivandrum to exhibit her works in the city. Reflecting the cosmic interplay between nature and music, each of her paintings enkindles positivism and encourages soulful conversation with the inner self. Layam, a collection works in watercolour and mixed media, presents a harmonious union of music, imagination and colours. Abstract on first impression, they appear to portray a state of mind that is sublime and ethereal, when the soul is at peace with its surroundings. Characterised by a skillful mix of colours and vibrant lines, her works are filled with rhythm, grace and energy; qualities clearly derived from a keen understanding of life and art. Anands paintings also possess a serene sensitivity that allows viewers to go into a meditative mood. Nature is expressed with spontaneity in her paintings, but always with a sense of symmetry and proportion, as if to convey the balance and equilibrium of nature.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Vinitha Anand 

When: Till October 15, 2 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

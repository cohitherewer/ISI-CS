 Couture chronicle

 TITHI SARKAR

 If you 

 are looking for a definitive book on fashion, this is it. 

 Coffee table meets history in Colin McDowells Fashion 

 Today, a 512-page treatise on 20th century fashion. 

 Time Out calls it the new fashion bible, 

 although its more than just that.

 Dress 

 is servant and messenger to society. Whether speaking in 

 whispers or shouts, it is always heeded because it presages 

 a desire, a need, an imperative of society. Frequently, 

 it articulates that need before other areas of life dare 

 give it voice, reads the introduction.

 All the 

 names that you have heard of, albeit in passing ? Coco Chanel, 

 Christian Lacroix, Isaac Mizrahi, Claude Montana, Franco 

 Moschino, Emilio Pucci, Yves Saint Laurent and many more 

 ? get plenty of space in black and white. Along with the 

 oh-so-long write-ups on the defining moments of fashion 

 history, there are some amazing illustrations and photographs. 

 Fashion, 

 as it stood at the beginning of the century and as it stands 

 today, has been discussed at great length. ?the century 

 which began with fashion as an elitist pleasure ends with 

 decorative dress as not only a central prop of life, available 

 to all, but also something much deeper than the age-old 

 urge for self-adornment. From the indulgence of turn-of-the-century 

 fashionable life, when clothes were changed several times 

 a day for no reason other than the joy of parading social 

 power through endless display, we now have round-the-clock 

 fashion, acknowledging no change in time of day or, increasingly, 

 even of season. Furthermore, fashion becomes less sexually 

 specific with each passing decade as men and women assume 

 clothing common to either sex.

 The book 

 chronicles the socio-political as well as cultural upheavals 

 of the last century and their influences on the world of 

 fashion. From having been dismissed as trivial and 

 nothing more than a female diversion, fashion has become 

 the single creative force most likely to influence us all.

 Starting 

 off with the New Looks (the debut collection of Christian 

 Dior in 1947 that made women feel feminine again), 

 the book goes on to talk about the youth revolution in fashion, 

 the designer assuming the role of the superstar, ethnic 

 influences, how retro made a comeback on the fashion scenario 

 and the role fashion played in protest and other ideological 

 battles.

 McDowell, 

 a visiting professor at London Institute and senior fashion 

 writer of the Sunday Times (London), is a fashion 

 historian who writes and broadcasts about both contemporary 

 and historical costume.

 It may 

 seem an over-indulgence to buy the book, considering its 

 price (Rs 2,090) and the not-so-good-looking cover, but 

 putting your money on it is no harm, even if you dont 

 have any remote connection with the fashion arena. Read 

 it to know all that has gone into the making of haute couture 

 as it is today. If the volume bogs you down, browse through 

 just for the sheer delight of some timeless pictures.

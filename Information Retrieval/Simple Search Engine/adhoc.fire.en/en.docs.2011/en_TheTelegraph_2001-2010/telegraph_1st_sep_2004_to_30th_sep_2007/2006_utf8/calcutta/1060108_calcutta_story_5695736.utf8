 A premiere and a party

 The journey that Aparna Sen began last winter on the windy valleys of Paro in Bhutan ? in search of an address that never existed ? ended at 89 Cinemas on Friday. The film is Sen?s third English project after 36 Chowringhee Lane and Mr amp; Mrs Iyer.

 Starring Shabana Azmi, Konkona Sen Sharma, Rahul Bose, Waheeda Rehman, Dhritiman Chatterji, Soumitra Chatterjee, Kanwaljit Singh and Shefali Shah, 15 Park Avenue was released in the city with a star-studded premiere at the Swabhumi multiplex.

 With faces new and veteran, plus a sprinkling of Bollywood stars, 15 Park Avenue explores a schizophrenic girl?s (Konkona) make-belief world, where she lives with her husband (Rahul Bose) and five children. 

 A caring but domineering sister, a vulnerable mother and a former fiancee who walks into her life for a second time, form Meethi?s physical world, which always threatens to disrupt her fantasies.

 The Friday premiere of 15 Park Avenue, produced by Bipin Vohra, found the Calcutta cast and crew turning up in full force. Missing in action were the out-station actors ? except Shabana, who plays Konkona?s elder half-sister and who flew in from Mumbai to add glamour to the event.

 Nana Patekar, in town to shoot for Goutam Ghose?s Yatra, dropped in to catch the show with his Ab Tak Chhappan co-actor Nakul Vaid.

 The screening was also attended by MP Mohammad Salim, Sandip Ray, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Shuvaprasanna, Ranjit Mullick and daughter Koel, Harsh and Madhu Neotia, Sohag Sen, Abhik Mukhopadhyay, and several TV actors including Deboleena Dutta and Arunima Ghosh.

 ?We have made the film with deep passion and love and I think it is the best of Aparna Sen,? said Shabana Azmi, before walking in for the screening. 

 The premiere was followed by a cocktails-and-dinner party hosted by producer Vohra and director Sen at B.E.D. Among those spotted at the do were Roopa Ganguly, Piu Sarkar and Kushal Chakraborty.

 Playing around with Bard

 Cardenio, Shakespeare?s long lost play, or rather something close to it, is coming to Calcutta. Nandikar, in tandem with an international project launched by Shakespearean scholar Stephen Greenblatt, will begin work on it this September.

 The last time the original Cardenio or Cardenna took the stage was in 1613, just before flames engulfed the Globe theatre. Manuscripts of this play written by Shakespeare ? or jointly by Shakespeare and Fletcher ? were also destroyed in a later blaze at the Covent Garden Playhouse Library.

 Stephen Greenblatt (of Will in the World fame), has recently collaborated in writing a new Cardenio inspired by Shakespeare?s lost play. In a recent announcement, Greenblatt said: ?I have recently completed writing a play in collaboration with Charles Mee. The play is inspired by a lost work of Shakespeare?s, Cardenio, which in turn was inspired by an episode in Cervantes?s Don Quixote (published in English in 1612). Mee and I have recast the plot in the 21st century and reversed the relationship between the fiction and reality that Cervantes had cunningly interwoven.

 ?I am particularly interested in what happens when cultural material, such as the story of Cardenio, gets moved from one language to another, one society to another, one age to another? The play is being readied for a US production. I have also been in contact with theatre companies in India, Japan and elsewhere. Ideally, I will be able to track the movements in which I am interested across cultural boundaries.?

 Partnering him in his quest in this part of the world is Nandikar. ?It is an academic-dramatic exercise to take off worldwide in 2006, an experiment into the geographical, cultural and social transformations that take place in the presentation of the same play in different parts of the world,? stage veteran Rudraprasad Sengupta told Metro.

 ?Sukanta Chaudhuri, who has adapted Cardenio for Calcutta, has made a very interesting connection with Tagore. He has sought out those episodes of sexual promiscuity and flamboyance in the writings of Tagore which seem Shakespearean,? added Sengupta. Unwilling ?to give out all the secrets?, he said it was a complex Bengali play to be done in a contemporary manner.

 Then it isn?t Shakespearean, is it? ?Ah! But Shakespeare is a very modern playwright; he wouldn?t have survived otherwise. Every actor worth his name just dreams of the time when he or she can play Shakespeare,? points out Sengupta, who intends to give shape to this play with a cast of 12 actors.

 Ashalata spells awe and shock

 Raima Sen has bagged the female lead in Jijy Philip?s Shock. The actress stars opposite Mohit James Ahlawat in the RGV production. ?Ram Gopal Varma told me he had seen parts of Chokher Bali and wanted me to play the lead... The film?s a thriller but there?s some emotional drama,? Raima told Metro from Mumbai. Moon Moon?s elder daughter will soon be in town for Anjan Dutt?s The Bong Connection.

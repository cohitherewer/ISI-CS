 A workshop being conducted at the Calcutta School of Music (CSM) puts over 100 eight to 16-year-olds in a room with a piano, a synthesiser, drums, xylophones, marimba (a deep-toned xylophone with African roots) and various other instruments. Much to their joy, the youngsters are then asked to come up with something original instead of just following musical notations.

 It is hardly a surprise that the participants are turning up more than an hour ahead of the starting time (10.30 am) and staying far beyond the scheduled close of the workshop (1 pm). 

 Sarmistha Som and Ranjan Ghosh, both teachers at the CSM, say the three-day programme is inspired by a recent workshop conducted at the institute by Guildhall School of Music and Drama, UK. They hope to provide an impetus to latent creative talents through the event.

 ?About 60 per cent of the participants are our students or those who attend music classes. So, they have a basic sense of rhythm. What surprised us was their ability to innovate, blending classical, tango and bossa beats,? remarks Som.

 The workshop has not only exposed youngsters to various genres of music, but has encouraged them to express themselves through actions. 

 The participants, divided into four groups, will perform original melodies, lyrics and skits on selected themes on Wednesday, the final day of the workshop.

 Navneet, Rishav, Sayantan, Ishan and friends, all from different schools, are, for instance, busy deciding whether Fields, Flowers, Battlefield or Haunted House with Ghost is the best theme.

 ?We have a lovely beat so all we need is to write a lyric about a ghost,? observes one young lady. ?But don?t you think the beat is too lively? for a ghost, I mean,? interjects another, as the group dissolves into laughter.

 ?My team?s theme is Bright Night, about a night lit up by stars. There will be singing, narration and acting,? explains Andrew, a Class VI student of St Xavier?s. ?We intend to follow this up with another session six months later,? discloses Som, as she escorts reluctant children out of Sandre Hall, the venue.

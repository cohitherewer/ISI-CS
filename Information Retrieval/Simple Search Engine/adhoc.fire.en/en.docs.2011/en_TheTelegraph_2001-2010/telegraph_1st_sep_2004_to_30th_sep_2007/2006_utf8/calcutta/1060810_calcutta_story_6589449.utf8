 And a dream gets bogged down 

 - How in 27 minutes, Buddhas Venice waterway ran aground

 4.20 PM, TUESDAY. CHITPUR LOCK GATE. Trial run of the waterway that would link vital pockets of the city with a commercial ferry service. It was one thing that both the launches got stuck in the silt. But a boat ride down Calcutta is not too bad, provided one knows how to select his sights and sounds. 

 From the shaded deck of MV Niharika, the smaller of the two launches, the hot afternoon seemed slightly distant. The breeze rose gently, synchronised with the leisurely pace of the boat. The view ahead was pretty. A canal stretching ahead, under rows of bridges, till the eyes could see. In the very heart of Calcutta. 

 What if the waters were so muddy that they had a solid feel? What if the promised beautification and entertainment zones along the route seemed planets away? There were other pleasures. 

 The crowds, mostly bare-bodied, lungi-clad workers at local factories and residents of slums lining both banks, hooted as the launches left Chitpur Lock Gate. The children some adults, too waved and jumped up and down. 

 BT Road, with its bristling traffic. First time crossing it smoothly, if from under it. A few minutes later, Tallah Tank bridge. Mild surprise in the form of a powerful spray of water from above. Its only the air valve of the Tallah Tank pipes, releasing extra water, says the employee of one the engineering firms that rebuilt the lock gates. Perhaps such a spray wouldnt be as welcome to office-goers. 

 The employee holds forth in the absence of government officials, who are all in MV Durga. The first station along the waterway will be at Bagbazar, from where we started, he said. The next stations are likely to be at RG Kar, Sribhumi, Baisakhi in Salt Lake, 206 bus stand in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Kestopur, and so on. 

 The third bridge, near RG Kar. But the embankment work has been done only till this point. Work has stopped from near Calcutta Terminal, the long-distance train terminus. 

 As the boats near the terminal, which falls on the left, the view changes. No longer the concrete look of sloping embankments. Ahead is a green canopy of trees, through which the still, brown water gleams. 

 But the sights on both sides have also changed. Instead of factories, shanties dot the kuccha banks. From the smell pervading some stretches, it is clear that they are huge open-air toilets. You must stop defecating here now, shouts one of the men from the launches at the slum-dwellers. They should have all been evicted. 

 They were, but they came back, says the engineering firm employee. 

 4.27 pm. Ultadanga. At this point, MV Durga, the bigger launch carrying all the VIPs, tries to turn back and gets stuck in the silt. The heavyweights tumble out into the slums and take the car back. MV Niharika gets stuck in the silt, too, on its way back near Bagbazar.

 Its a difficult journey ahead for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose Venice dream the waterway is.

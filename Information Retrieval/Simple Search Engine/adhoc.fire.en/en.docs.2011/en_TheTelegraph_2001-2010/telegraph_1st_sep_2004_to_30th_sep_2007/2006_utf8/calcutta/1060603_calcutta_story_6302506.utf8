 Gandhar celebrates its 45th anniversary with a festival of plays from its current repertoire. Being staged this evening is Jaara Brishtite Bhijechhilo, based on a long poem by Joy Goswami. A poetic rendition of an ordinary womans life with its joys and sorrows, it makes a poignant statement of the secret sufferings of women in our society. Enacted solo by Bijoylakshmi Barman, it unfolds the daily drudgery of its protagonists monotonous existence. Wed into a middle-class household, her life is just a passive acceptance of what fate has doled out to her. No personal achievement or aspiration lights up her life. Lonely from the core of her heart, she finds companionship in trees, birds or in the sweet memories of melodies from the days of her childhood. She seeks solitary refuge in lonely and forgotten corners of her home. Yet, there comes a time when she can endure her plight no more. The apparent calm of her demeanour breaks up with a sudden crash of thunder, and after the fury of the storm, the rains come to wash away her pain. Direction: Goutam Halder.

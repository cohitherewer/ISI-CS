 The myths and truths of Narnia

 A moment from The Chronicles of Narnia

 When Andrew Adamson first read The Chronicles of Narnia as an eight-year-old growing up in his native New Zealand he was entranced by a secret world, empowered by an epic saga of courage and forgiveness, of honour and friendship.

 ?Just like thousands upon hundreds of thousands of other kids all over the world,? he notes. First published more than half a century ago, the Narnia stories by CS Lewis are universally acknowledged as some of the finest literature of 20th century.

 ?The Narnia stories have endured because there are some universal truths in them,? says Adamson. ?The themes of forgiveness and sacrifice are very noble and honourable themes and ideals that we all relate to. But more than anything else, I think, for children the books are very empowering.? They are also full of the most fantastic array of characters, from Fauns and Centaurs and giants and majestic lions to a wicked White Witch, who rules the amazing world of Narnia which four young children accidentally discover through the back of a wardrobe in an old, enchanted country house.

 Those four ? Lucy, Peter, Edmund and Susan Pevensie ? are swept up in a classic battle between good and evil and the very future of Narnia rests upon their young shoulders. 

 Adamson, 38, is the highly talented young director of Shrek and Shrek 2, charged with bringing the wonderful world of Narnia to life on the big screen. And yes, he admits, directing The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe has been an incredibly daunting challenge but a richly rewarding experience, too. At first, though, he was hesitant to take on such an enormous project. 

 ?At first there was a reluctance of getting into something of this scale,? he admits. ?But at the same time I couldn?t really imagine letting someone else do it and then having no one to blame but myself if I wasn?t happy with the movie.?

 At the outset, when he first met with the producers and Douglas Gresham, the step son of the late CS Lewis who represents the writer?s estate, Adamson declared that he wanted to make a faithful adaptation of this much adored work. Any plans to update the story in a radical way ? such as change the location of the house from World War Two England to a contemporary city in America ? and he simply wasn?t interested.

 ?There were rules that I put on myself and rules that the estate probably would have put on me if I had differed from them too far,? he says. ?But I loved the books so much that I didn?t see there was a good reason to change them significantly. Interestingly enough the door had been somewhat opened by the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter films. The studios became aware that you could actually make a piece of British literature that was true to the material and it could still be commercially successful.?

 Adamson recruited a superb cast including international stars Liam Neeson, who provides the voice of Aslan the lion and Tilda Swinton as The White Witch and evil ruler of Narnia who has plunged the land into a permanent winter. Rupert Everett provides the voice of the Fox and Ray Winstone and Dawn French are Mr and Mrs Beaver. 

 Adamson was at the head of an international search to find the young actors who would play the Pevensie children. ?I must have seen about 2,500 children on tape,? he recalls. 

 ?And I probably saw about 700 of those and had workshops with about 400 of them in smaller and smaller groups.?

 He is delighted with the performances of the youngsters ? Georgie Henley as Lucy, William Moseley as Peter, Skandar Keynes as Edmund and Anna Popplewell as Susan. ?They were fantastic. Everything I hoped they would be,? says Adamson.

 Filmed mostly in his native New Zealand, Adamson has harnessed the talents of some of the film industry?s leading exponents of special effects, make up and animatronics and has blended CGI with live action footage.

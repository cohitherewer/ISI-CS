The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Graffiti bar act amended

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The debate over defacement of walls rages on, but the deed has been done.

 The state Assembly on Monday repealed the earlier West Bengal Prevention of Defacement of Property (1976) Act and incorporated a number of new provisions related to political graffiti in the amended act.

 For once, leaders of diverse political hues were united all desperate to deface private walls, a right severely curbed by the Election Commission in the last Assembly polls.

 On the face of it, some of the amended provisions may appear to favour the landlord, but a closer scrutiny reveals no respite from political might.

 Lip service for landlord

 Political parties will have to seek consent, in writing, from the owner of the building.

 Non-adherence to the above rule will be an offence and those found guilty will be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend up to six months, and with a fine not exceeding Rs 50,000.

 Loopholes for leaders

 No punishment if the leader can prove the offence was committed without his knowledge.

 No punishment if the leader can prove that he/she had exercised due diligence to prevent any such offence.

 Bottomline

 The writing is on the wall.

 Tiny dreams: Host Hussain 

 with Manoj Mondol

 The second season of Orange County premieres this Friday night, at 10 pm on Zee Cafe. The highest-rated drama of 2003-2004 in the US among

 adults (18-34) and teens (12-18), O.C. was launched in India last December.

 Announcing the start of Season Two, Neil Chakravarti, business head of Zee Cafe, said: ?We received innumerable requests from viewers across the country to air the second season and we are indeed happy to be able to respond to those requests.?

 The first season saw Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) fall in love with the girl next door, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton). Their romance, however, is constantly tested by the young lovers? inability to escape from their pasts. As the tumultuous summer comes to an end, both Ryan and Marissa must make decisions on their futures in the county. The adults in town face fresh challenges as well in this second season.

 Pop pair: Mischa Barton and Benjamin 

 McKenzie

 Vijay Sharma from Nagaland can pass his body through a hollow badminton racquet. Reshma Lalwani from Mumbai can survive 50 motorcycles vrooming over her stomach. Anand Kumar from Rajasthan has devised a 25.25 gm working gas cylinder? 

 Zee TV is showcasing extraordinary feats by ordinary Indians called Shabaash India, being beamed Monday to Wednesday at 10.30 pm. It is hosted by Hussain.

 Those who fear to find Bengal missing from the bravado list, tune in on Tuesday to see Manoj and Mihir Mondol from Subhasnagar in Nadia district cook their way to national focus with a mini pressure cooker.

 ?Our cooker is big enough to steam 10-12 peas. It is equal in height to the safety valve of a normal pressure cooker,? Manoj tells Metro. The two brothers, who earn a living through tuitions in the locality, are gunning for a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.

 ?We have also prepared a small oven,? says the science dropout from Ranaghat College, adding that their mini cooking wonder has made it to the Limca Book of Records in 2001. Another Limca Book entrant from Bengal on the show is Joginder Kumar Yadav of Burnpur. The 18-year-old martial arts student will have 220 needles pierced into his body in the July 11 episode.

 ?I am aiming for 1,000 needles with him,? announced his teacher Ajay Kumar Singh, over telephone from Asansol.

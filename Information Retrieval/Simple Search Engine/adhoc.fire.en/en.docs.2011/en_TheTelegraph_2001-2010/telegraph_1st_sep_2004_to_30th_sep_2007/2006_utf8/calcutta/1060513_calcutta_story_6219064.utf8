The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

The young are at play

Stage On amp; Off

 A moment from Silence! The Court is in Session

 Thirty years ago, The Red Curtain took upon its young shoulders the responsibility of grooming school-leavers in the art of theatre, placing them in the public eye with full-length productions. It would be an eye-opener to put together a list of Red Curtain alumni still connected to theatre in one way or another. The resurrected Red Curtain continues in this praiseworthy activity with its latest venture, Vijay Tendulkar?s Silence! The Court is in Session (Gyan Manch, May 6), the cast and crew sourced from St Xavier?s College, a new generation learning the ropes of hoisting the ubiquitous russet drapes, down to the trademark curtain call.

 First-time director Ronaan Roy succeeds beyond normal expectations with this feminist classic, given that most novices would balk at the tough task of holding audience attention for nearly three hours. He handles the text respectfully, paying careful heed to the smallest stage directions. He does not try any smart-alecky stuff ? that passes in the name of post-modern directorial eclecticism or imposition nowadays ? and resists the urge to fancifully interpret. Only in the case of the ?experimental actor? Karnik does he get carried away by parodying a prolific Calcutta-based director.

 True, he presents the play as a ?satire?, which misses its deeper significance by showing the characters as cardboard figures, and forcing us to take some time to get used to the two-dimensional style. But this can be easily excused, because it is utterly unreasonable to expect professional training from rank amateurs, Stanislavskian psychological realism from 20-year-old college students. Even in the West, young actors do not come of theatrical age until they complete at least their Bachelor?s of Fine Arts in the discipline.

 Under these circumstances, the performances of Agnidev Roy as the prosecutor and Purti Simon as the accused struck me the most. The former carried off his sadistic crusade, Indian accent and vocal modulation remarkably well, while the latter achieved more with her face during speechless spells as a victim. The others revealed various levels of high-school histrionics but, like I said, this is just the beginning; they can learn.

 Debt twist in staged abduction

 MUZAFFAR RAINA IN SRINAGAR AND IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI IN CALCUTTA

 Atul Choudhury, the share broker who went missing on Friday evening with a laptop and Rs 2 lakh, was found in Srinagar on Saturday night. The laptop and the cash were intact.

 Police in the Jammu and Kashmir capital said Choudhury, 26, a Howrah resident, had left Calcutta on his own, to stage an abduction drama that he thought would force two of his fellow-traders to return the several lakhs he had lent them.

 Atul told us he had lent the money to Amit and Prakash, who were refusing to repay, said superintendent of police, (Srinagar East) Anand Jain. 

 The duo even reportedly threatened him with abduction when he pressed for repayment. That probably gave him an idea to fake an abduction. He thought the blame would ultimately fall on the two, who would then be forced to pay up, Jain added.

 Choudhury, however, admitted that he himself owed a substantial sum to three other persons L.K. Jain, Joginder Singh and Namit Benari.

 Premabrata Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Hare Street police station, said: Apparently, he has taken loans from his friends and staged an abduction drama. Our team has left for Kashmir and everything will be clear once Choudhury returns and we interrogate him.

 Choudhurys family had lodged a complaint on Saturday morning with Hare Street police station, as he was last seen in an area under the thanas jurisdiction.

 Shantanu Sinha Biswas, an officer of the police station, has reached Srinagar with a team to bring the youth back. We will take him back tomorrow, Biswas said on Sunday.

 To make his kidnap story seem plausible, Choudhury had called his family around 6.30 pm on Saturday and claimed that he had been abducted and taken to Srinagar, where he was put up in a hotel.

 He told officers at Ram Munshi Bagh police station, where he had to spend the night after being rescued, that he had no clue why I came here and how all this happened.

 The youth had left Calcutta for Delhi on a Kingfisher Airlines flight on Friday. He checked into Hotel Airport in the Capital. The next day, he left for Srinagar on an Indian airline flight.

 Once in Kashmir, he procured a new SIM card for his mobile phone and called his family. Calcutta Police then contacted us and we found him at Imperial Lake View Hotel, said superintendent of police Jain.

 What: Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2006, presented in 

 association with The Oberoi Grand.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand ballroom.

 When: Friday evening, 8 pm onwards.

 The show: The fifth edition of the multi-city fashion 

 series kicked off in Calcutta on Friday. 

 The opening evening saw shows by design biggies Tarun Tahiliani and Rocky S. And Tarun clearly was the winner of the evening, with Rockys show dubbed boring by most in the crowd.

 The much-awaited show started off a little past 9 pm with Taruns fall-winter collection. The collection unveiled at the India Fashion Week 2006 (fall-winter) in April in Delhi was titled Ode to Autumn and comprised mens wear pieces alongside the womens line.

 The super-glam line screamed out Taruns signature digital prints and jewelled ornamentation. 

 The highlight was the use of Victorian lace and jamewar. Structured jackets, kurtas, kaftans, tops, cigarette pants, skirts and evening dresses of every shape and size made up the collection.

 Sun-kissed bronze, rust, ochre and antique gold highlighted the ivory and the colours of the night. The show wrapped up with a sequence of saris, the orange number made famous by Shilpa Shetty at the fashion week as the final show-stealer.

 Show over, Tarun took the stage to explain to the audience how he has globalised and contemporised Indian clothes, an exercise quite unique and unnecessary.

 Next up was Rockys pretty, girlie line of pastels a transitional collection between fall-winter and spring-summer. The look, though, was very summery, much like his spring-summer line at IFW in Delhi last month, with fresh additions of course. 

 The collection from Rockys higher pret line Noir, had a dreamy feel to it. Soft, flowing, body-caressing silhouettes were embellished with laces, applique, embroidery and cutwork.

 Ivory, ecru, beige and nude, pastel pink, blue, green, peach and lemon coloured the clothes. Dresses of varying shapes and lengths were the mainstay of the line, with skirts coming a close second. There were a variety of tops, mid-length pants, tunics...

 The restricted palette and the repetitive silhouettes were oh-so-boring. Add to this the slow-motion catwalk and the show just failed to fire.

 Gang hand in cell shop robbery

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The day after a robbery at a cellphone showroom on Park Street, officers of the detective department have concluded that it was work of a gang of youths from outside the state. 

 The gang members used a child to gain access into the shop early on Tuesday, said the sleuths. 

 According to the detectives, the operation, carried out before dawn on Tuesday, saw the gang decamp with 32 high-end cellphone sets, worth around Rs 2 lakh. The robbers even emptied the cash register of Rs 3.25 lakh. 

 The robbery is the biggest in recent times, barring the robbery at a mobile phone store in Bowbazar.

 The gang had probably used a crowbar to lift the middle of the shop shutter and create a gap. A child slipped through the gap, while the other members of the gang stood on guard, explained a detective. The work was carried out so well that it was difficult to make out at first glance that someone had broken into the shop, he added.

 It appears that a gang from Rajmahal, in Jharkhand, is behind the robbery. It has boys in its ranks. The children slip into the shops and steal cellphones. The gang generally goes for high-end handsets that fetch a good price in the grey market, claimed a senior officer of the detective department. 

 The modus operandi of the gang suggests that the cellphones lifted in the city will be sold in Bhagalpur and Patna in Bihar. 

 The sets even find takers in Malda, from where they are smuggled to Bangladesh.

 The demand for stolen sets exists throughout the year, but it peaks before Diwali and Id. 

 In some cases, the gang members use software to change the International Mobile Equipment Identity number of the cellphones to make it difficult for the cops to track them down. 

 A robbery in a cellphone shop on APC Road, near Sealdah, on June 16 this year put the cops on the trail of the gang. The gang members had cut a hole in the iron grille at the back of the shop, on Kaiser Street, allowing a boy to enter it and steal handsets. 

 The detectives believe that the gang is not targeting only cellphone shops. Stores selling expensive garments are also on its radar.

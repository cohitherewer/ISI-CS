 A disillusioned mind

 Offering an incisive study of complex human psychology, Megh (written by Utpal Dutt) lays bare the crisis of humanity in modern urban civilisation. It unfolds the tragic story of its schizophrenic protagonist, Samaresh Sanyal, a writer who has lost his sanity and his faith in mankind, having been betrayed in love. In his frustration, he begins to write thrillers, instead of classics. He decides to write a story in which a murderer is portrayed as a real hero because he commits a perfect crime, leaving no clues. This seems to be Sanyals way of expressing his total disgust with the prevailing social order. His writings urge thinking people to disrupt and demolish the present system, so that a new one can be created in its place. His belief in his theory is so strong that he even kills Sujata, his former lover. Finally, he realises that violence and hatred cannot be the means to combat social evils. A congenial social synthesis can only be achieved through restoration of faith and love. Direction: Anish Ghosh.

 With Monday being D-day for Delhi High Court?s conditional access system (CAS) implementation deadline, cable operators, multi-system operators (MSO) and broadcasters are looking to the Centre for the next move in the CAS case.

 On March 10, the high court had ordered a CAS roll-out ? means to watch and pay for only those channels the viewer wants ? in the four metros ?within four weeks?.

 The information and broadcasting ministry has since then conducted a series of meetings with broadcasters, MSOs, operators and other ?stakeholders? of the cable and satellite industry to ?thrash out? various issues. After the last meeting, on April 7, the government said it would take ?appropriate action? on the matter.

 ?We are waiting to see what action the government takes before making any move,? said Ashok Mansukhani, executive director, corporate services of Mumbai-based IndusInd Media amp; Communication that manages MSO InCable Net, and president of the MSO Alliance. It was on a petition filed by INCable Net, Hathway and Calcutta-based RPG Netcom (now Indian Cable Net) that Delhi High Court announced its CAS roll-out judgment.

 ?Our plea to the government is that if you?re bound to implement CAS, please implement it,? said Mansukhani. Depending on the Centre?s stand, the petitioners will decide whether they would move court against the government. With Delhi High Court closed till April 16, an appeal will have to wait till after that.

 MSO SitiCable is also supposed to submit its proposal of a CAS roll-out calendar to the ministry on Monday.

 Broadcasters and MSOs. disagreeing on some crucial points, have failed to clear the confusion on CAS. The Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF), a representative body of broadcasters, has refused to yield to the MSO demand for a fixed price for the channels. ?We believe that for CAS notified areas, there should be no price fixation,? reads a letter submitted by the Foundation to ministry secretary S.K. Arora at Friday?s meeting.

 Another issue of contention is MSOs asking for channels to be offered on an a la carte basis rather than in the present bundled form. ?Bundling actually proves to be advantageous for the consumer since we?re able to offer a discount,? said the head of a sports channel and a director of IBF.

 In the letter, broadcasters have raised several other CAS-related concerns such as piracy, resolution of pending litigation and mandating other platforms like DTH, IPTV and Broadband.

 Art and altruism

 Both Kazi Nazrul Islam and Maharaja Sir M.N. Roychowdhury of Santosh were great patrons of the arts in pre-partition Bengal. Kazi Anirban and Keshav Roy, grandsons of these two legendary personalities, come together this evening to share a continuing tradition of art with present-day art-lovers. Perhaps the first of many such shows they plan to hold around the world, Art For Giving, the exhibition featuring works by these two artists, showcases paintings on the theme of the timeless woman. Kazi Anirbans dark blues and moody reds depict contemplative women staring wistfully at patches of empty space. The works of Roy (a painting by him appears above) are excellent studies in expressionism. His powerful drawings in rich-coloured inks are striking commentaries on the force of feminity. Hosted by The Park, Calcutta and Spandan Art Gallery, in aid of charity.

 Event: An art exhibition by Keshav Roy and Kazi Anirban 

When: Today at 7.30 pm 

Where: The Park, 17 Park Street

 Triple jinx for traffic cops

 - Fuel exhaust, high-intensity headlights and honking horns have wrecked the health of city?s policemen

 What they breathe, what they see and what they hear have taken a heavy toll on the health of our traffic policemen. 

 Diagnostic tests on a group of cops have revealed that over 75 per cent of them suffer either from lung disease, vision problem or hearing impairment. The trio of tormentors: air pollution, dazzling headlights and blaring horns.

 The tests were conducted recently on 200 traffic cops, including those who serve at Sealdah, Maniktala, Shyambazar, Gariahat, Moulali, Camac Street and AJC Bose Road, at the Police Training School by doctors from Peerless Hospital.

 ?Apart from determining the blood sugar and blood pressure levels, we conducted ECG and some special tests to ascertain the condition of the lungs, eyes and ears of the policemen. The results were alarming. We have submitted a report along with the results of the tests and our recommendations to the home department,? said Shyamal Basu, managing director of Peerless Hospital.

 According to the tests, at least 100 policemen have lung problems and breathing trouble. About 10 have an asthmatic tendency. Forty suffer from night blindness and weak vision. Hearing problems afflict 30 policemen. A score were found to have high blood pressure. Many are grappling with more than one medical problem.

 ?We are going through the report and recommendations and will definitely take steps. The policemen suffering from acute bronchial or other diseases will not be deployed on the road. The transport department is looking into the issue of auto-emission. We have initiated a move to curb honking of horns and use of dipper lights,? stated deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 Chest specialist Parthasarathi Bhattacharya said several lung diseases might occur due to polluting car fumes. ?The chemicals in fuel exhaust directly affect our lungs. Those who work at busy intersections are vulnerable to lung disease.? High-intensity light, too, has the potential to affect vision, observed eye specialist Ranabir Mukherjee, while ENT specialist Partha Sikdar corroborated the possibility of hearing loss due to sustained exposure to honking.

 WE BRING THE CURTAINS DOWN ON OUR BOLLYWOOD POLL 2006 WITH RESULTS IN THE BEST FILM CATEGORY. PATRIOTISM TO GANDHIGIRI, REMAKES TO SEQUELS, HERES RAISING A TOAST TO THE YEAR GONE BY

 The box-office said Lage Raho Munnabhai. But you said Rang De Basanti. And so many of you; 34 per cent of the total SMS votes came in for the Rakeysh Mehra film. That too in a year when you were indeed spoilt for choice. Runaway blockbusters, musical hits, sleeper successes... 2006 saw it all.

 This year showed that there was no longer any formula to a hit film. Comedies worked mdash; Malamaal Weekly, Golmaal, Phir Hera Pheri. Comedies failed mdash; Shaadi Se Pehle, Pyare Mohan, Apna Sapna Money Money..?. Romance worked mdash; Pyaar Ke Side Effects, Fanaa. Romance failed mdash; Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, Jaan-e-Mann. Adventure worked mdash; Taxi No. 9211. Adventure failed mdash; Naksha. Remake worked mdash; Don. Remake failed mdash; Umrao Jaan. Real life worked mdash; Gangster. Real life failed mdash; Ankahee, Woh Lamhe.

 Sequels, though, had a 100 per cent success rate. Phir Hera Pheri, Lage Raho Munnabhai and Dhoom 2 all did better than their successful predecessors. No wonder the other hits this year are having their own Part IIs mdash; Malamaal Weekly, Golmaal, Don.

 The NRI audience became more important than ever in the year gone by. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Don, Dhoom 2 made more at the North American box-office than in north India. But the man in the small towns made a big difference. Fanaa, Krrish and Vivah showed that the aam janta and the single-screen theatres still have a telling effect on the box-office.

 The critics didn rsquo;t matter anymore. They killed Don the moment it touched down and the film went on to make Rs 45 crore and more. They panned Vivah and the film slowly gathered momentum to emerge a big hit. They hailed Omkara but the film couldn rsquo;t bring in enough audiences. 

 So, as Time magazine rightfully declared, it was your year. And it was you who voted Rang De Basanti as your favourite film of the year.

 You laughed and cried with them, partied and prayed with them, lived and died with them. And you went home stronger and yet more sensitive.

 So, Bollywood 2006 belongs to DJ and gang.

 Here rsquo;s to the awakening...

 Lage Raho awakened us, too. If Rang De was Netaji style, Munnabhai 2 was the Bapu effect. And literally so. Gandhism became Gandhigiri as get-well-soon cards started flying off the racks. The most successful film of the year in terms of box-office returns, not only in the city but nationally, Lage Raho Munnabhai also became the first full-length Hindi feature film to be screened at the United Nations. The 19 per cent votes for the movie put it in second spot, even though its actors Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi scored low in the Best Actor category. There rsquo;s, of course, more of mamugiri to come with Munnabhai 3 taking Munna and Circuit to USA.

 Manmohan Desai knew it. Subhash Ghai knew it. Rakesh Roshan still knows it. The exact ingredients for the big masala potboiler. So, while he spent a lot on cutting-edge action stunts, at the heart of Krrish was the age-old Bollywood revenge story, the running-around-trees love story and dekho-aami-parchhi-dadi growing up story. And boy, Hrithik was a born superhero! Sorry, Brandon Routh, you can return to Iowa. Had our poll been open to letters and phone calls, it might have been a different line-up altogether because Krrish dug in wide and deep. And whatever Rakesh Roshan might want to make next, he has to take the Krrish story forward. A sci-fi film had a superhero sequel. What next?

 Yes, it rsquo;s fresh on the minds as it rsquo;s still running in the theatres but really, there rsquo;s no escaping Dhoom:2. No wonder, after the best look and the best actor, you have voted D:2 the fourth best film of the year. From the moment Hrithik perched on that train, you strapped up for a roller-coaster ride. There have been times in cinema history when your heart backs the bad guy. John did it in Dhoom. And now, Hrithik. That too in the same franchise of Sanjay Gadhvi. Good he didn rsquo;t jump off some cliff rsquo;cause Mr A is sure coming back for more. Will Ash be there again in her hot pants? Seems likely but there is also talk that Shah Rukh may replace Abhishek as Jai. SRK vs Hrithik? Wah, dhoom ho to aisa!

 Zaara dekho kaun aa gaya hai... This man loves challenges and he pulls them off in his inimitable style. After making Devdas his own in 2002, this year Shah Rukh made sure that you think of him every time you say Don. Even as the oldies grumbled, the kids absolutely loved Don, from the smoke swirl to the mid-air dive, not forgetting the no-steps-back Khaike paan dance. The Farhan Akhtar non-stop hungama might have garnered all of nine per cent votes, but that rsquo;s enough to put Don in the Top Five ahead of Fanaa, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Gangster, Corporate and Omkara. Here too, a sequel is definitely in the offing as the King will return once Boman Irani rsquo;s Vardaan breaks free

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Key road caves in

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the wake of Wednesday?s downpour, a portion of the road in front of 98, Canning Street, caved in on Thursday morning after the brick sewer underneath collapsed. No casualties were reported. 

 Traffic movement on the stretch will remain suspended till the ditch, eight-foot-three inch-deep and six-foot-three-inch wide, is filled.

 According to a witness, the cave-in occurred around 6 am and resulted in a sand-laden truck falling into the ditch. 

 ?It happened in a fraction of a second. Before the driver could slam the brakes, the vehicle had plunged into the crater. Luckily, no one was injured. Two wreckers removed the truck from the ditch,? he said.

 ?The cave-in was caused by the collapse of the brick sewer under the road. The brick sewer is about 100 years old and dilapidated,? said Calcutta Municipal Corporation chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose. 

 A portion of the same stretch had caved in about nine months ago, said an official of the drainage department. 

 ?After inspection, we had found that the underground brick sewer was in bad condition. We had planned to carry out repairs, but did not get the necessary permission from the traffic police,? he added.

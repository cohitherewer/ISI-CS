 Sivabrata Chatterjee: The Calcutta 

 Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to regularise illegal 

 constructions in the city. Can you tell me under which provision 

 of CMC Act,1980, will the mayor legalise the unauthorised 

 constructions?

 In 1984 about 85 sq km of municipal 

 and panchayat land in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur 

 was made a part of the city. 

 The civic body is not sure whether 

 the buildings in the added areas, which came under the purview 

 of the CMC building department, have sanctioned plans. 

 The houses were built according 

 to rules which are different from those of the CMC. As a 

 result, the house-owners in the added areas are facing problems 

 in getting permission for renovating their buildings. The 

 civic body can only grant permission if the structure is 

 a legal one. 

 The house-owners are hesitant 

 to come forward due to the provision of high penalty. The 

 civic assessment department, on the other hand, is losing 

 out a major chunk of the property tax revenue. 

 The civic authorities have decided 

 to offer the house-owners in the added areas and in some 

 other pockets of the city a one-time exemption, for a limited 

 period, from paying penalty if they legalise their constructions. 

 The exemption will be granted 

 under Section 400 (1) of the building rules.

 K.N. Jha: I own a building 

 on 148, MG Road, under ward 42. There are some unauthorised 

 constructions in the building. When will you announce a 

 scheme allowing us to legalise illegal constructions without 

 paying a penalty?

 An amnesty scheme will be announced 

 in a month or two but I am sorry to inform you that the 

 Burrabazar area will not come under the purview of the programme. 

 However, if you have a sanctioned construction plan you 

 will be given permission to repair the building.

 S. Agarwal: I have bought 

 the first floor of a 90-year-old four-storey building on 

 10/1/2, Syed Sally Lane, in central Calcutta, near Mohammad 

 Ali Park. The other three floors have been purchased by 

 three brothers. They have illegally constructed rooms on 

 the roof and have modified the parking space. I have been 

 complaining about the problem for five years, but nothing 

 has been done. Whenever I met civic officials in this regard, 

 they discouraged and insulted me. Please tell me what I 

 should do now ?

 This is a personal property dispute. 

 However, I will look into the matter and inspect the building. 

 I will soon fix a date for the visit.

 I would like to point out that 

 there are several illegal constructions in Burrabazar and 

 central Calcutta. People seem to think that immediately 

 after lodging a complaint, building department officials 

 will arrive on the spot with a demolition squad and raze 

 the illegal structures. 

 It is not that simple. Before 

 demolishing a structure, the CMC will have to undertake 

 an inspection, issue a showcause notice to the offender 

 and give him or her a hearing. The offenders often move 

 the court and get a stay order. 

 Anil Bavishi: Past 10 years 

 I have been complaining against an irregularity in sanctioning 

 a construction proposal on 81, N S Road, but nothing has 

 been done. It is a 21-cottah plot, but the construction 

 proposal passed by your office has recorded it as a 23-cottah 

 land. As a result, the plot owner is enjoying the floor 

 area ratio for 23-cottah area and cheating people. What 

 should I do now? 

 I think the plot owner once had 

 obtained an injunction order from court against any action 

 by the CMC. Please come next week. If there is no legal 

 binding for the CMC, I will send a notice to the plot owner. 

 If the notice has already been served, I will send a demolition 

 squad. 

 Rafique Sarkar: Is the 

 CMC doing anything against the growing number of illegal 

 structures in the Topsia-Tiljala area? One such illegal 

 construction, is coming up at 30/1, Kustia Masjid Bari Lane.

 It is an open secret that the 

 Garden Reach, Park Circus, Raja Bazar, Kidderpore, Garden 

 Reach areas are full of illegal constructions. Now if you 

 ask me why it is happening, the answer is very simple: there 

 is a space crunch in Calcutta. However, I can send a demolition 

 squad with you to the site. 

 Talat Salahuddin: Do you 

 think concentration of illegal constructions is more in 

 the Muslim pockets in the city? If yes, then why?

 I think there are two reasons 

 for this. Firstly, people belonging to the Muslim community 

 prefer staying with their community. Secondly, the nature 

 of the land encourages illegal construction in those areas. 

 Most of the lands are thika lands, which have now 

 turned into no man?s land.

 Action plan 

 for unsafe buildings

 Divya Mishra: Recently, 

 a part of a building had collapsed on Chetla Hat Road. What 

 is your action plan against such unsafe buildings in the 

 city?

 The building department has served notices to 700 such buildings 

 in the city. The owners of these buildings have been asked 

 either to repair their structures or demolish them. The 

 part of a building, which had collapsed at Chetla Hat Road, 

 belongs to the CMDA. We had slapped a notice on the officer 

 of the housing complex in December 1999.

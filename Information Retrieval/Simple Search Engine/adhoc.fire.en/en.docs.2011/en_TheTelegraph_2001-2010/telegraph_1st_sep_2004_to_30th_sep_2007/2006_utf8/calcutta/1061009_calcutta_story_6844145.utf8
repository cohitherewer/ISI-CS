The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On holiday, 

 America all the way 

 - US visa delay no deterrent to city tourists dream destination travel plans

 Militancy might have cast a shadow over the beauty of the Kashmir Valley and obtaining a visa might stand in the way of a holiday in the US, but a majority of the citys tourists would rather head there than anywhere else. 

 A recent national survey by travel agency Thomas Cook has also found that the number of tourists from Calcutta planning to travel out of the country for a holiday has doubled compared to last year.

 Switzerland is the most favoured destination abroad after the US, followed by Singapore, London and Australia-New Zealand. Mauritius-Seychelles, Dubai, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand also figure on the list.

 Leisure travel at the domestic and international levels has witnessed a sharp increase over the past few years due to impressive increase in income levels, stated Madhavan Menon, managing director, Thomas Cook (India). 

 Other travel agents in Calcutta confirmed the draw of the US and Europe among tourists. According to the companies, stringent visa regulations in the US and the expenditure involved in travelling across Europe act as deterrents. 

 The US and Europe are dream destinations for Calcuttans. But till recently, one had to wait for at least three months to get a visa appointment for the US. Getting a US visa has become easier now. This will boost tourism in this sector, explained chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India Anil Punjabi. 

 High cost is the most important factor when it comes to Europe tours, added Punjabi. 

 A 10-night tour of the continent costs approximately Rs 1.5 lakh per person. In comparison, a Southeast Asia package of the same duration costs Rs 50,000. 

 Among domestic getaways, 26 per cent of tourists have rooted for Kashmir. 

 Shimla, Goa, Rajasthan and Kerala are the other favourite destinations. Many have also expressed a desire to tour Delhi and Mumbai.

 The survey has further revealed that 53 per cent of the international tourists prefer travelling between October and December. Friends are overwhelmingly the most trusted source of information when it comes to planning a holiday, with 61 per cent of the respondents advocating the method. Only 26 per cent of the respondents go to travel agents for information.

 Among those surveyed, 70 per cent said sightseeing was their favourite activity on a holiday, followed by shopping. 

 Spa trips and adventure and water sports make up the rest of the list.

 Italian elegance for your walls

 A new range of Italian 

 wall finishes 

 Creating exotic textures, stencilling motifs, splashing cool graffiti?Just a few ways of decking up your walls.

 No longer are walls just about sober pastels or vibrant hues to break the monotony of the room. Wall effect is the new way of adding life to your interiors.

 And while theres no end to themes that you can splash on your walls, a brand new line of effects from the house of Pidilite Industries Ltd, the makers of Fevicol, goes back in time for some elegant retro looks. Called Renaissance, the range boasts some exclusive Italian effects.

 People today are becoming very individualistic when it comes to home decor. The need of the hour is personalised look and theme for their private space. Boasting five distinct looks, Renaissance caters to people looking out for exclusivity, says Anand Kale, marketing head of Paints, Fevicol Division, Pidilite Industries Ltd.

 Launched in India five months ago, Renaissance came to Calcutta in May. Marketed as a premium product, Renaissance aims to give a whole new look to Indian homes. 

 The line offers five distinct finishes: 

 Stuccomarma: A marble-like glossy or translucent finish typical of a Renaissance villa. It comes for Rs 90 per sq ft.

 Caravaggio: It combines the precious features of Venetian Stuccoes with softness and light effects of ancient wall fabrics, used in the Renaissance period. It creates the velvet effect coupled with a sweet smell. Also suitable for restaurants and pubs, this is available for Rs 120 per sq ft.

 Ceralux: It boasts an iridescent finish with a dash of pearl. Ceralux can also be worked in a number of ways like padded, spatulated, dripped, painted and sponged. It comes for Rs 90 per sq ft.

 Velatura: Is a system of application where light and shade effects are highlighted. It is ideal for recreating the classic, antique feel, all for Rs 65 per sq ft.

 Decora: A veiled surface dotted by small particles that looks like painting and feels like low-relief to touch. Promising to infuse serenity into the bedroom, Decora is available at Rs 65 per sq ft. 

 Select applicators of Calcutta are chosen and trained by Pidilite for the application of these speciality wall finishes. Before going in for the finishes, it is advisable that you consult an architect or your interior designer who will be able to guide you as per your home design and lifestyle needs, suggests Anand Kale.

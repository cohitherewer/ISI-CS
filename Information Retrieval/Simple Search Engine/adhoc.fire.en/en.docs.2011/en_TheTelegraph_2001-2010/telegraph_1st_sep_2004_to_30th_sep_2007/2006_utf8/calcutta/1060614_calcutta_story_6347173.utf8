 Timeout

 The trials of time and lessons learnt from experience can bring about a complete change in human values and ideals. Written by Chandan Sen, A Parabasey traces such an ideological transformation in Samit, a former revolutionary, through a span of three decades. Having witnessed the turmoil and turbulence of the Seventies in his youth, and the paradoxical twists and turns of succeeding eras during the 30 years of his self-exile in Germany, Samit is initially confused about life. However, he gradually begins to understand why people in his own homeland have changed so much since he had left the country. The realisation dawns upon him that as society encounters the uncertainties brought about by a capitalist way of life, people must adapt themselves to the new philosophy, or perish. Viewed from several conflicting perspectives, the play depicts hope and despair walking hand in hand. At the same time, it re-lives memories and incidents of the past and tries to reconcile them with the needs of the future. Direction: Sarbadaman Som.

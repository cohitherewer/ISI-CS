The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Young Metro

 What?s on your mind this week

 The little kindergarten 

 boys looked rather convincing in the guise of beautiful 

 belles in an Arabian dance staged at the annual concert 

 and prize-giving ceremony of Birla High School for Boys 

 (junior section) held recently 

 Poll pain

 During the Pujas, there is such 

 a hue and cry over organisers violating the decibel limit 

 set by the state pollution control board. The police, too, 

 cracked down on many such cases last year. 

 But in the run-up to the Assembly elections, in many wards of the city political party workers have been yelling incoherently into microphones well past bedtime. The speakers are turned on to such an obscenely-loud volume that the residents of the area are compelled to listen to the hollow, hilarious and often-bordering-on-ridiculous promises of the politicians.

 Where are the policemen now? Or is campaigning for elections reason enough for them and the pollution control board officials to turn a blind eye to the flouting of norms and a deaf ear to residents? pleas?

 Hundreds of voters in Howrah?s 

 Uluberia constituency boycotted polls on April 22 and went 

 on a picnic. The literate youngsters in Calcutta, too, may 

 follow suit in the next elections. 

 Most students seem to have little interest in the Assembly elections since they feel that it would make no difference to their lives. They would rather focus on getting good jobs than queuing up at polling booths.

 They cannot be blamed entirely for their indifferent attitude as they do not foresee a very bright future for them in the state.

 Blind faith

 When youth is just a memory;

 will you be in it?

 When age is just a number;

 will you be counted?

 I know that everything can change

 I feel everything I?m not today

 They?ve sold me lies, I kept buying

 They sent me truth, I never replied

 Faithlessness lays by my side

 Vengeful hate idolised;

 It?s all they play, a constant tune

 echoing in the abyss of time; 

 Lonesome angels in the clouds

 they await conscience, await truth

 The temples? candles remain unburnt,

 the lights are on, deranged stools...

 Unrelate to a world of hate,

 become a derelict...

 CHIT CHAT

 Tongue trial

 Students and teachers of vernacular-medium schools took part in a panel discussion on ?Role of educators in creating all-rounders for the future?, organised by The Telegraph, at The Bengal Chamber of Commerce on April 21.

 Presenting varied views, the participants agreed that the students of vernacular schools were at a disadvantage due to a lack of fluency in English.

 Anusuya Chaudhari of Baranagar Memorial Girls? High School and Debjani Dutta Roy, headmistress of Surah Kanya Vidyalaya, stressed that ?it is not the language itself, but the communication skills in it that are more important?. 

 The headmistress of The Park Institution of Girls, Sampa Chakraborty, emphasised that the lingua franca doesn?t have a substitute, especially in interviews and competitive exams. 

 The panelists agreed that the students of vernacular schools suffer from English-phobia, thanks to the ?flawed syllabus? of the state board. Also to blame were inferiority complexes, low general knowledge, the lack of enthusiasm on the part of teachers in state-run schools and the vast syllabus.

 While Sohini Halder, a theatre personality and teacher of Rajkumari Girls, held the students? mindset partly to blame, headmistress of Brahmo Balika Shikshalaya Kajal Sarkar accused parents of creating unnecessary pressure on their children.

 Newspaper-reading in schools and teacher-orientation workshops, the educators believed, could help the students master the English language.

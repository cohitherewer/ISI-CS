 The City Diary

 The dengue death toll in Calcutta rose to five on Wednesday, with the death of Peali Mukherjee, 12, at Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan. Officials in the civic health department said Peali was a resident of Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city.

 The two fake profiles of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee displayed on Orkut, a social networking website, was deleted on Wednesday. Police said senior officers of the CID and the detective department had approached the Orkuts US-based headquarters a few days ago to block the profiles. Sleuths are, however, yet to know the details of those who created the profile. 

 Snehasish Saha, 6, was reunited with his mother minutes 

 after he got separated from her on Wednesday morning, thanks 

 to the promptness of a traffic sergeant. 

 Snehasish, a student of Scottish Church School, boarded 

 a private bus near Khanna cinema. But before his mother 

 could get in, the bus sped off. The woman then turned to 

 sergeant Tribhanga Ghosh, who was standing nearby, for help. 

 Ghosh took her on his motorcycle and followed the bus. On 

 reaching Maniktala, he stopped the bus and reunited the 

 child with his mother. 

 A few invitees to the ongoing Calcutta Film Festival held a demonstration in front of New Empire cinema on Wednesday evening, protesting non-availability of seats.

 Rinki Das, 34, a housewife, committed suicide at her residence in Barrackpore, on the northern fringes of the city, on Tuesday night. Rinkis mother has lodged a police complaint, alleging that she used to be tortured by husband and in-laws for dowry. No one could be arrested as the in-laws and the husband have fled, police said.

 The body of Ganga Thapa, 55, a constable of the state police, was found near Ballygunge station early on Wednesday. Thapa, a resident of Jagaddal, on the northern fringes of the city, was attached to Alipore Police Lines. A preliminary probe revealed that Thapa was drunk. Police have ruled out foul play. 

 Remhat Hussain, 22, sustained a bullet injury in a leg during a brawl with his accomplices on Tuesday night. Police said Hussain and his three accomplices, all with criminal antecedents, gathered on Crematorium Road, in Beniapukur. Soon they split into two groups and began a fight, during which one of them fired a shot. Local residents rushed to the spot on hearing the gunshot and took Hussain to SSKM Hospital. His accomplices fled.

 More than 100 children took part in various contests and cultural programmes organised by the Eastern Railway at its orthopaedic hospital in Howrah on Wednesday to mark Childrens Day. Forty children were administered vaccines.

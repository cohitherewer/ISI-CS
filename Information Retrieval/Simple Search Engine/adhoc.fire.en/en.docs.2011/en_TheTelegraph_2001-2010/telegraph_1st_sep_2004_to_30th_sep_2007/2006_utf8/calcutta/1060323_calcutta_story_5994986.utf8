 Precious pretty packs 

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Be it birthday, engagement, anniversary or Valentines Day, nothing can be more romantic than surprising your lady love with a dazzling ring.

 But if this precious little present comes packed in an oh-so-common red velvet box, a blue plastic case or sometimes even in those far-from-cool cloth pouches, then youre delivering the dazzler in a dud.

 So what do you do to make your priceless token of love more appealing? Wrapping it with gift paper is a cliche. To take a step closer to creativity, drop into Quality Display at 29 A, Allenby Road that opened its doors last month.

 The 200 sq ft shop, beside Gujarati Bal Mandir, stacks exclusive window displays and counter trays for jewellery houses. From acrylic ornament displays that look like dainty hands and figurines in pristine whites to leather stands to spacious boxes for storing home jewellery, there is quite a variety to choose from.

 But pretty little ring boxes in bright cheerful splashes are the real eye-catchers here.

 The packaging counts. When you buy a ring that is precious, you definitely want the packing to be worth it. These ring boxes match the mood of a valuable ring. I would suggest even jewellers to replace the age-old square boxes with these, smiles proprietor Bhavesh Damani, whose clientele includes jewellery houses like Diwansons and RR Agarwal.

 Quality Display, 29A, 

 Allenby Road, Ground Floor.

 How much

 Rs 30-plus

Made of flock, these cute little ring boxes have been imported from Hong Kong and China and come in a variety of shapes. A pink teddy bear has a red Santa cap with a tiny red bow on its neck. A tiny orange case resembles a Halloween pumpkin, while the silver one is like a flower trolley with bright flowers. Red, blue and pink roses, in sizes big and small are accentuated with green leaves and stems. Others include a pink peach, a green star and ornate butterflies in florescent green and blue.

 As the name of the store suggests, we promise quality and durability, adds Bhavesh.

 If nature has been an inspiration, science, technology and sport are not far behind. So you have a telephone replica, a golf ball and even a helicopter with silver blades. Also available are windmill lookalikes. 

 Those in electric red are embellished 

 with a portrait of a French-looking lady. Ones that look 

 like caskets have tiny golden handles on top.

 OCs rapped for taxi assault case

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ten days after 32-year-old Krishna Kumar Pandey, who works in a stockbroking firm, was made to do the rounds of three police stations late at night for lodging a complaint, the top brass of the force on Tuesday censured two officers-in-charge for their role in the matter. 

 Around 11 pm on November 3, four youths stopped Pandeys taxi near Ho Chi Minh Sarani while he was on his way home. They took Pandeys gold chain and Rs 8,000 in cash before beating him up and throwing him off the taxi.

 A profusely bleeding Pandey first approached the police kiosk at Minto Park for help. He was asked to go to Bhowanipore police station. An officer of the thana took him to SSKM Hospital for first-aid and then to the site of the attack, only to say that it was under the jurisdiction of Ballygunge police station. The cops there repeated the routine to direct Pandey to Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 There, too, officers made Pandey visit the place where he was thrown off the taxi. It was past 3.30 am and he was almost unconscious from loss of blood. His colleagues, who had accompanied him, took him to hospital.

 After the incident came to light, a probe was initiated. The outcome of the investigation resulted in the censuring of the officers-in-charge of Bhowanipore and Ballygunge police stations. The censure will be put on the service records of the officers-in-charge and would come up for discussion before they are promoted or rewarded.

 The idea is to make officers aware that their primary responsibility is to attend to someones complaint before worrying about where the incident occurred, stated deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chattopadhyay.

 A senior officer claimed Pandeys harassment had dealt a blow to the polices efforts to project a friendly image.

 The officer-in-charge of a police station should help the victim of a crime, even if it has occurred under the jurisdiction of another thana, asserted the senior officer.

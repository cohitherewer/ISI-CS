 Rang De Basanti showed how multiplexes have taken over our viewing habits. Fanaa reversed the trend and brought the audiences back to the single screens. Now Karan Johar has bridged the divide.

 Breaking first-week collection records at Menoka and INOX (Forum), Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna has turned out a winner at both standalone theatres and plexes, emerging as the highest box-office grosser for any Hindi movie in Week One in Calcutta. 

 The gross collection in the city has been more than Rs 1.2 crore in the first week, says KANK Bengal distributor Kushagra Jalan. It has bettered Mangal Pandey which also had a huge opening in the same week last year. Karan has made a very urban film and it has done much better in Calcutta than in the suburbs and other Bengal centres.

 INOX (Forum), which opened advances the evening before KANK hit the theatres on August 11, has had almost all of its daily six shows go house-full at Rs 250 per ticket in the first week. The increased ticket pricing might have helped in setting the record but a Karan Johar movie coming after five years was irresistible for the huge family crowds, says Vikas Syal, general manager of the Elgin Road plex.

 Further south, the Shah Rukh Khan-Rani Mukherjee romance was writing another record in Menoka. No single screen in Calcutta has ever grossed Rs 16 lakh in its first week and that, too, with KANK releasing in all the four plexes, says Pranab Ray, owner of Menoka. The 28 shows in Week One saw 97 per cent occupancy with noon shows starting at 11 am and night shows ending at 12.45 am.

 While Week Two has seen an expected dip in the KANK wave, the KJo magic however real it may have become has already done its trick. I am really happy that it has done so well in Calcutta, Karan tells Metro from Mumbai. Coming from me, the subject may have come as a surprise to many, but now most are accepting it.

 While Karan continues to break new ground, KANK should continue breaking records till a certain Munnabhai comes calling with Circuit in tow on September 1.

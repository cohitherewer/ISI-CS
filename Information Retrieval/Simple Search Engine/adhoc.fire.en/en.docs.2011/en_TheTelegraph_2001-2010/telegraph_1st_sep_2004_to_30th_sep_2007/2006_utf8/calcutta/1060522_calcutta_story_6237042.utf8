The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Aesthetics think tank

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) organised a meeting last Wednesday at which the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), along with architects, historians, artists, members of the heritage commission and institutions such as Intach and Bengal Engineering amp; Science University could interact with members of the Delhi Urban Commission to set up an urban arts commission in the city.

 This allowed those concerned with the way the city develops and looked to share their experiences with their counterparts in Delhi.

 At the end of the meeting, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the nascent commission will be more of a thinking forum which would enable various groups to brainstorm on economic as well as aesthetic issues beyond the scope of the building department and the heritage committee.

 He clarified that the recommendations of this think tank will not be legally binding and will be outside the constraints of bureaucracy, unlike the directives of Delhi?s Urban Arts Commission. 

 As a first step, the Calcutta group will try to standardise the designs of gantries and railings and dividers of roads in keeping with the architectural style of neighbourhoods. 

 If nothing more, it will provide a platform where the public can discuss various issues, an opportunity it never got earlier.

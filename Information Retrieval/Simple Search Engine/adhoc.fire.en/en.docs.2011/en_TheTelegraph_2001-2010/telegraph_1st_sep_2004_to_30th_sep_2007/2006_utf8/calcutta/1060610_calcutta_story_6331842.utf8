 Vaccines to check infant mortality 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A state-of-the-art laboratory has been set up in Calcutta by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Unveiled on Friday, the laboratory will help control the rising infant mortality rate owing to diarrhoeal diseases and provide more efficient vaccines for cholera and other enteric diseases. 

 The new research lab, set up in technical collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), was inaugurated by Union health minister A. Ramadoss.

 The Japanese government has provided Rs 92 crore to set up the lab. Of this, Rs 62 crore was spent on the new building on the Beleghata Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital campus.

 Stressing the need for setting up a modern laboratory, Ramadoss said the infant mortality rate owing to diarrhoeal diseases is second highest in the country, after respiratory diseases. 

 ?The Centre is laying more stress on preventive measures rather than cures. Such labs will help fight enteric diseases,? he said. 

 ?With advanced equipment, we will be able to conduct research on molecular microbiology, immunology, biochemistry and patho-physiology. This will help us improve the vaccine quality,? said a senior scientist of the lab.

 Another important feature of the lab is its state-of-the art animal farm. ?Bacteria-free animals will be kept in special cells for research. Before using the vaccines on humans, they will be tested on these animals,? an official said. 

 ?The cages are specially designed, so that virus from the infected animal doesn?t get transferred to a human,? he said. The school of public health laboratory was opened in March 2005. The government had given 50 cottahs at the Beleghata ID Hospital for these buildings.

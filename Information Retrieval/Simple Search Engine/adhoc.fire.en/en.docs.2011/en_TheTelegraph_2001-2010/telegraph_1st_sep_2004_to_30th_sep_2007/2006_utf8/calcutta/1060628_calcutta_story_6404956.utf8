 We Ask You Answer

 Brazil amp; rest of the world

Today?s question: Which team is your favourite 

to win the football World Cup and why?

Yellow fever: Brazil dribbles through the qualifying matches 

with ease

Kanai saha,

Address not given 

Brazil has played 87 games in the World Cup, out of 

which it has won 74. The team spirit of the Brazilians is exemplary. Their professionalism, 

skill, mental strength and consistency are outstanding. And they have a good coach 

to guide them. Its chief opponents ? namely France, Italy, England and Argentina 

? lack these qualities. 

Ramit Das, 

Achena Park 

It is difficult to pick one potential winner of the 

World Cup. Traditionally, the favourite does not fare well in the tournament. 

The exit of erstwhile champions France and Argentina in the first round of the 

Cup are cases in point. On the other hand, Brazil which had barely managed to 

squeeze through the qualifying rounds last year, came up with a superlative display 

to lift the trophy. This time, too, the team that plays well through the tournament 

stands the best chance.

A. Chatterjee, 

Lake Town 

All-time favourites Brazil is my pick for this year?s 

World Cup. They have five players with the potential to win the tournament on 

their own ? Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Adriano, Kaka and Robinho. They cannot easily 

be marked out of a game. In addition, the squad is energetic and is led by an 

able coach. 

Sudipta Sur,

Ramgarh 

Italy looks the best bet to win. The team has recently 

been hit by allegations of match-fixing and gambling in the domestic league, but 

it still has the firepower to lift the coveted trophy for the third time. Marcello 

Lippi, a master strategist, has on his rolls a wonderful blend of youth and experience. 

An array of striking options ? Totti, Del Piero, Gilardino, Toni, Inzaghi, Iaquinta 

? and creative midfield players in the form of Pirlo, De Rossi, Gattuso and Camoranesi 

backed by the defensive ability of Nesta and Cannavarro. Add to that the irrepressible 

Buffon in goal. The Azzurris, indeed, have a strong foundation. There isn?t a 

shadow of doubt that they are one of the favourites in the Cup.

Sahid Pervez, 

Lake Gardens 

I?ll cheer for Argentina in the World Cup. With attacking 

players like Messi, Crespo, Saviola and Riquelme, the team will pose a potent 

threat to Brazil?s dreams of retaining the Cup. The Argentinian defence, consisting 

of the likes of Ayala, Sorin and Heinze, will also be difficult to breach. A clash 

between Brazil and Argentina would be the battle royale.

Rahul Roy,

Dum Dum 

Brazil is the foremost contender for World Cup 2006. 

The agility of Ronaldinho, the skill of Ronaldo and Adriano and the experience 

of Roberto Carlos and Cafu make the squad virtually invincible. It is Brazil versus 

the rest of the world. 

Veena Sreelalan,

Gol Park 

My favourite team is Brazil. The team members are 

energetic and focussed and constitute a cohesive unit. I don?t think there is 

any team that can stop them from winning the world title for the sixth time. 

Pampa Guha Roy,

Haldia 

The small countries are doing well in this edition 

of the World Cup, but I believe that Brazil will eventually triumph. It is apparent 

from the way the team is playing that they have worked hard on its game. 

Samyak Nandy,

Bangur Avenue 

Germany is a strong contender for the World Cup. Not 

only is it improving match by match, the team also has the home support. There 

is excellent understanding up front between Klose and Podolski, along with a solid 

midfield and defence line-up.

Satyen Biswas,

Behala 

It is difficult to predict the outcome of sporting 

competitions. There are a number of teams that are very good, but I will support 

Brazil because it plays the most attractive football.

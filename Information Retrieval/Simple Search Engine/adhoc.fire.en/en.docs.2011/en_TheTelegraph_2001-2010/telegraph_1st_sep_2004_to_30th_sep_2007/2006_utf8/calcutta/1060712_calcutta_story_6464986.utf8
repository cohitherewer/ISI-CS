 Hospitals in crisis recruit male nurses

 SANJAY MANDAL

 A severe shortage of female nurses has prompted some private hospitals in the city to appoint male nurses. 

 With new hospitals mushrooming and the old ones expanding their services, the demand for nursing staff has increased over the past few years. In order to meet the demand, trained male nurses, mostly from the southern part of the country, are being appointed in the emergency and other wards, operating theatres and ICCUs.

 The first batch has already arrived and has been appointed by Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra (EEDF), AMRI and CMRI, among others.

 Every year, more than 1,000 nurses pass out from various government and private institutes in the state.

 ?But the supply falls short of the demand by at least 20-25 per cent in most big hospitals,? said Pratima Chatterjee, registrar of West Bengal Nursing Council (WBNC).

 ?The problem will aggravate further, as more hospitals with specialised units are coming up,? she pointed out. Besides, lucrative offers from other countries ? particularly the US, UK and some in West Asia ? have also created a vacuum in the country.

 ?Our demand is very high and still rising, while the supply is static,? explained S.B. Purkayastha, president of AMRI Hospitals. The hospital has added 200 beds but the nursing staff strength is the same. ?We had to search for male nursing staff in training institutes of other states,? Purkayastha added. The first batch of 20 male nurses has joined the hospital recently. 

 Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) has also added 20 beds in the critical care unit. ?In ICCUs, each bed requires one nurse every shift. For the three shifts, we require 60 more professionals,? said Rupak Barua, of CMRI. The hospital recruited its first batch of 50 male nurses earlier this year. 

 From feeding a patient, administering injections or giving medicines, the male nurses have proved to be on a par with their female counterparts. ?Male nurses can handle bulky patients with ease,? said Arindam Chanda, medical superintendent of Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra, which has recruited 17 male nurses last month.

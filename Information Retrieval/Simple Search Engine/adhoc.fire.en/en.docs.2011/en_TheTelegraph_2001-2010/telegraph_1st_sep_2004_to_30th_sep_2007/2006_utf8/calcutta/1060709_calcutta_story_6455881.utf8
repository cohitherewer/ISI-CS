 Superhero cape amp; ring

 The Superman toy 

 and the D?damas ring from Krrish

 Look, up in the sky, it?s a bird... 

 it?s a plane... it?s Superman!?

 If not in the sky, Superman is definitely on the racks and is all set to fly off it. Inspired by Warner?s blockbuster movie, Mattel Toys has launched a range of Superman Returns action figures and accessories. This super line of merchandise gives kids the power to control ? and in some cases even ?become? ? the Man of Steel. The range, targeting four-plus children, features dynamic role-play and action figure toys, accessories and play sets that enable little players to demonstrate super powers.

 ?Films target a child?s imagination and toys fuel it. Movies have started to become big in India, hence Superman Returns is a good opportunity for us to create and leverage content,? says Nanette D?Sa, vice-president, marketing, Mattel India.

 The Superman range has already reached the racks of Crossword, the bookstore conveniently placed a leap away from the INOX multiplex screening five shows of Superman Returns this week. 

 ?The Spiderman mask had been a big hit when the film was launched. We are expecting Superman toy sales to pick up as more and more children watch the movie,? said a representative of the Elgin Road store.

 There?s the Punch N Crunch glove with two moulded forearm pieces, fabric half-glove and palm sensors to give kids the crunch-punch power of Superman. A special sensor in one glove lets them bend a ?steel? bar that comes with the set, to the sound effects of metal-crunching. A Heat Vision Headset headpiece can re-enact the eye-blasting power of Superman. There is of course the Superman gear, complete with a cape, the iconic ?S? shield, and a ?steel? chain to snap.

 Look out also for Superman himself, in a variety of sizes from 5? inches to 30 inches, costing Rs 299 to 1,799. ?The most popular is a 14-inch figure which has a remarkable 35 points of articulation to make the figure bend and move the way one wants to,? D?Sa adds. Another hot pick, according to her, is the Kryptonite, the magic compound found in Superman?s home planet.

 The green compound can be moulded, thrown, bounced or stretched and comes in a plastic-moulded case similar to the Kryptonite crystals in the film.

 Krrish

 The ring that pledged Hrithik Roshan?s love for Priyanka Chopra in Rakesh Roshan?s answer to Superman, and the loss of which sent Hrithik flying across Singapore skies to pick up a fight, is set to reach jewellery stores around town. Gitanjali Gems has launched the D?damas-Krrish Commitment Range as part of its tie-up with the superhit movie.

 ?We have a range of open-ended rings in 18-karat gold with two different-coloured stones in bezel setting on both ends, designed on what we have made for the movie,? says Philip Anthony, vice-president, marketing. ?Jewellery is heavily used in Bollywood movies but not many use ornaments as a part of the storyline like Krrish does.?

 To go with the ring, the product portfolio includes danglers, chandeliers, hoops, pendants, necklaces and bracelets. July is being celebrated as the Commitment Month at all D?damas outlets. ?The context in which the ring has been used in the film takes it beyond the normal association of wedding and engagement. In fact, it can stand for any sort of commitment. Hence we expect it to do well,? Anthony adds.

 Priced at Rs 2,200-Rs 4,000, the ring is yet to reach the city. ?Our stocks have been delayed by the rains in Mumbai. But we expect to get them very soon,? says Pankaj Soni of Shree Shringar Jewellers.

 All in the family

 The contemporary Indian urban middle-class family is under stress. The symptoms are staring us in our face as more and more families become dysfunctional owing to high-pressure jobs, work-induced mobility, work-home imbalance and other such factors. As more and more women join the workforce and work long hours, it is their families that bear the brunt. But then again, women are better off today working and earning their living than they were ?in those good old days? when they stayed back to look after home and hearth.

 So then where does the solution lie? Will the great Indian family become extinct? Will the very basic foundation of our society disintegrate? Gitanjali Prasad, in her first non-fiction, The Great Indian Family: New Roles Old Responsibilities, probes the conditions and causes that have endangered the family fabric.

 At the launch of the Penguin book at Oxford Bookstore and a day later at a panel discussion organised by the Ficci Ladies Organisation, women talked freely on family matters.

 Prasad was unequivocal in her condemnation of the Indian working conditions and work hours that she believed caused the most stress to the family. ?Companies,? she said, ?operate on a ?buy one, get one free? syndrome wherein the employer hires not just the employee but his family as well, who will take care of him so he?s able to give those punishing 12 or even 14 hours a day.?

 Much as the book blurb exhorts working women to read this book, it should also be prescribed text for HR professionals!

 The institution of family, Prasad says, is under threat as the workplace goes contractual and job security virtually disappears. ?Ek biwi or ek naukri ka zamana gaya,? says an interviewee in the book.

 The book thus traces shifts in Indian marriage and family life, the change in power structures within the family, the priorities and the problems; problems of long-distance marriage, of single-parent families, of desperate housewives, of single young things and of married working women.

 Liberally interspersed with interesting and insightful anecdotes, the text is engaging without being pedantic. 

 The author quite candidly confesses in her introduction, ?it?s a popular book? written on a hugely popular topic.

 At the end of it all was Prasad?s pointed query: where, from here? The answer she says lies in a return to the joint family or what she calls the ?multi-generational family? as most of her interviewees would rather have their parents stay with them and help them cope with the rigours of modern-day life.

Enjoy life the healthy way that was the message 

given out at The Telegraph GoodLife Talk Show, the grand finale of The 

Health and Lifestyle Show 2006 organised by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry 

and the state government in association with The Telegraph.

The event, held at Crystal Room of Taj Bengal on Sunday 

evening, discussed a new focus on lifestyle. At the event co-anchored 

by Amit Ghose, chairman of health sub-committee of the chamber of commerce, and 

PR veteran Rita Bhimani, experts in the field of lifestyle disorders formed the 

audience.

Starting with muscle power, Vesna Jacob, a fitness 

instructor, demonstrated several routine exercises on a machine called a performer 

that promises overall wellness of the body.

When I first started my company, my objective 

was to get the best equipment in the world to India, said Deepak Dewan, 

chairman and managing director of LifeFitness. 

Smoking topped the list of lifestyle problems. High 

blood pressure, a family background of heart diseases, lack of physical exercise 

and obesity were the other risk factors highlighted. 

It was then time for some interaction between celebrities 

present at the show as moderator Amit Ghose threw a question at percussionist 

Bickram Ghosh on stress management. I was a smoker and I used to take in 

tobacco pretty much in any form you can imagine, said Bickram. Your 

mind becomes a block and you lose focus. So I decided to put a stop and quit smoking 

in a day, he added.

Bickram also spoke about the role of music in stress 

management, a notion seconded by danseuse Priti Patel. Dance is an amazing 

form of therapy. It takes you to another plane of expression, she explained.

Referring to stress as a killer, experts 

classified stress into positive and negative formats. Stress that contributed 

to achievements was labelled positive. On a lighter note, a stress-free job was 

brushed away as a fable, because no stress in ones job would be reason enough 

to generate some! 

While thousands were tuned into the cricket match 

between Australia and India on Sunday evening, cricketer Devang Gandhi chose to 

touch upon the correct fitness regimen of balancing diet and training. 

But not before adding that cricketers now put too much emphasis on fitness 

and less on skills.

The next bit of advice came straight from the doctors 

mouth. Diabetes is directly related to ones lifestyle, said 

Dr Subhankar Chowdhury. At least 50 per cent of diabetes risk is reduced by proper 

diet, exercise, less stress and no tobacco. Awareness trends seemed to be the 

hope for tomorrows India. 

I think people are starting to take note of 

their health in India, although Calcutta still witnesses an off-gym season during 

festivals, observed Preetom Mukherjee-Roy, a fitness expert. Finally, if 

youre one of those who proudly say that you dont drink alcohol, you 

just drink beer theres news for you. Two bottles of beer have more alcoholic 

content than two pegs of whisky!

The talk ended with a vote of thanks by Ghose, but 

not before a trial of the performer by the chamber of commerce president 

Aloke Mookerjea, helped by fitness instructor Vesna. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya 

and his wife also attended the talk show. A good health dinner followed the fitness 

session.

 Two of the three men who had allegedly 

 raped a 26-year-old in Baruipur?s Pirpukur, on the southern 

 fringes of the city, on Sunday night have been arrested. 

 Police have stepped up the search for the third.

 Jabbar Sheikh and Shamsuddin, 

 both in their 20s, were picked up from their hideouts in 

 Dutta Para, close to the victim?s house, on Thursday morning. 

 Shamsuddin was also wanted in a number of dacoity and murder 

 cases.

 ?We knew we would crack the case 

 soon. Now, we are looking for the third accused,? said A.K. 

 Ghosh, additional superintendent of police (rural), South 

 24-Parganas. ?We are grilling Jabbar and Shamsuddin for 

 details of their third partner in crime. A team is keeping 

 a watch on the places he frequents.?

 The victim, who is an ayah 

 at a Park Circus nursing home, came to the city in search 

 of a job after being deserted by her husband four months 

 ago. She left her son with her mother in Raidighi, South 

 24-Parganas. 

 On Sunday night, while the neighbourhood 

 was watching the World Cup final, the three armed youths 

 had entered the shanty that the victim shared with another 

 woman, also an ayah. One of accused dragged out the 

 second woman and a 12-year-old child who was present, while 

 the other two raped the victim.

 After the incident, the criminals 

 went into hiding. Police looked for them in various areas 

 and interrogated a number of persons, including members 

 of a local club. The three were reportedly members of the 

 club, which police demolished a day after the crime.

 ?Jabbar and Shamsuddin had been 

 changing hideouts almost every day. On Wednesday night, 

 acting on a tip-off, we picked up Jabbar from his house. 

 Interrogating him, we got to know Shamsuddin?s hideout and 

 arrested him,? Ghosh signed off.

 Labour of love from afar

 As dusk sets in over Joka, five pairs of gloved hands get increasingly busy arranging bricks, grinding pebbles and spreading them out on a pathway while keeping up a slapping match with the gathering army mosquitoes.

 This is the first road we have made in our lives, Jessie Huen beams. She is one of the 29 students to come from Nanyang Girls High School in Singapore to work with and for the children of Hope Home Calcutta, a low-profile NGO that rears the orphaned and the abused.

 Most have a background in sports. Noelle Tam plays softball; Choo Chang-e excels on the track and Tay Ruiqi is a shuttler. Yet nothing could have prepared them for this labour.

 This visit is part of their service learning programme. This is one of the options under our schools Global Classroom course. They could have gone to New Zealand, Beijing or the US as tourists. But they chose to come here and work, school dean Neville Ellis surveys his troop with evident pride. 

 But the girls themselves laugh off the halo. You can have fun any time. And we have taken malaria pills, Choo says brightly, scratching her arm. 

 In a shed at a corner of the little grassy compound, others are giving music lessons. This follows an hour of science, English and hygiene lessons. As the clock strikes six, the classes give over. Dindika subhopa, Rahul, a frail boy, greets from afar, adding that it means good morning in his newly- acquired tongue. Dandike-bandike, his teachers return in equally adept Bengali. 

 The girls from Singapore have painted the wall of the home in bright colours, with motifs describing the words love, joy, peace and patience. Before being allowed to take up such a trip, they work in a hospice or a childrens society. Coming from an affluent country, this shows them what it means to share and care, reflects team leader Kah Suan Chu, who set up the schools contact with Calcutta.

 Dev Sarkar, president of the three-year-old home, is happy to see the inmates smiling. They are from difficult backgrounds. Some have been deserted while one saw his father being butchered. This mainstreaming is vital for them. Also, by being exposed to a different culture, they are learning the sanctity of hard work, Dev said, standing in front of a structure which he hopes would take the shape of a home for his 23 children if the funds materialise.

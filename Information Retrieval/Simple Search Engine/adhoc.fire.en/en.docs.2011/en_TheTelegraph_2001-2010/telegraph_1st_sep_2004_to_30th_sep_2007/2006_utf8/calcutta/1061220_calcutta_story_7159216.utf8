 CU sent on student hunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University, acting on an order from Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, is desperately trying to locate a failed student suffering from severe depression and even contemplating suicide.

 The governor, also chancellor of the university, wants the authorities to arrange psychological counselling for the student, who had failed in B.Sc Part I 2006.

 University sources said the students father had written to the governor, saying his son, a good student, was shocked to learn that he had been awarded unexpectedly low marks in mathematics.

 The father wrote that his sons mental condition was deteriorating by the day and that he could commit suicide anytime.

 He, however, did not give any details of his son name, address, roll number or the college in which he studies. The letter bears only one specific information the name of the examinees father.

 We first need to identify the boy and then arrange psychological counselling for him, so that he overcomes depression. Were trying our best to locate the boy. But the task is undoubtedly difficult, as we dont have any details, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 We have asked our examination and results sections to take all possible measures to identify the boy and arrange psychological counselling for him, as desired by the chancellor, he added.

 At a recent meeting, the governor had asked the vice-chancellors (VCs) of all state universities to arrange psychological counselling for their students on a regular basis. The governor, in his letter has reminded Calcutta University, that the issue of counselling had figured in his talks with the VCs.

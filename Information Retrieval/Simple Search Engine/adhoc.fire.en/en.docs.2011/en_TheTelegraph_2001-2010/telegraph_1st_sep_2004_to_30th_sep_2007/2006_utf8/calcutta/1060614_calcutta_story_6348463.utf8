 CID to probe boy death

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the deputy inspector-general (DIG) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to probe the murder of 13-year-old Hassan Iqbal. The boy?s body was found in the septic tank of a building in Tangra more than seven months ago.

 Justice G.C. Gupta also directed Calcutta Police to hand over papers related to the case to the CID within two weeks.

 ?The DIG, CID, is directed to appoint an officer not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police to conduct the inquiry,? the order stated.

 Hassan, a resident of Mir Meher Ali Lane, under Tangra police station, was kidnapped on November 11, 2005. On the same night, the kidnappers telephoned his father Mohammad Islam and demanded Rs 5 lakh as ransom. 

 Five days later, Hassan?s decomposed body was found in the septic tank of a house in the neighbourhood. An inquiry was initiated into the incident after Islam lodged a complaint at Tangra police station. Initially, he did name anyone as suspect, but later said six neighbours could have been involved in his son?s death.

 Tuesday?s court order followed a petition by Islam, who alleged that those probing the case were not trying to find out the culprits. ?Since November last year, police have not arrested even one person in connection with the case,? Islam?s advocate Moinoor Rahaman told the court.

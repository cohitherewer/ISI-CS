 Turning tables out of town

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Next time you find your favourite DJ missing from the console of your favourite nightclub, dont think hes quit the job. He is sure to be making music elsewhere, most likely in one of the neighbouring cities of Calcutta.

 DJs from Calcutta are topping the demand list of the party people in cities like Guwahati, Shillong, Ranchi and Bhubaneswar.

 People from those places travel to Calcutta very often. Here they get a taste of the rapidly growing party culture. When they go back to their own, they arrange for such dos and invite Calcutta DJs to play, says DJ Akash, who is on the must-play list of at least eight such parties a month.

 And the sound from the Calcutta console is even travelling beyond boundaries, to Dhaka, Chittagong and Kathmandu. Dhaka is one city that is emerging as one of the biggest markets for the DJs of Calcutta. It is as cosmopolitan as Calcutta and people there love songs from Hindi movies. Most of them know the DJs of Calcutta because they keep coming here, says DJ Harish.

 Most of these parties are hosted on big, open grounds, with footfall comfortably crossing 1,500.

 These cities give a lot of respect to the DJs playing for them. You do not have to wait for people to hit the dance floor, says DJ Harish. 

 And its not just the respect. Playing at such parties means big money too. An established DJ can pocket anything between Rs 40,000 and Rs 70,000 on any weekend night. 

 On special nights, like Christmas or New Years Eve, the amount can even go beyond Rs 100,000. And this is just the fee, with all other expenses paid by the hosts.

 The moolah is of course an important part of the whole deal but the exposure it gives to the DJ is invaluable. The crowd in one city is completely different from another. On his visits to different cities, a DJ is exposed to various cultures, likes and dislikes. This educates him to change his music according to the moods of the people, says DJ Vicky of Venom (in picture above by Rashbehari Das). So, the travelling helps todays troubadours to not only expand their repertoire but also their market.

 Mayhem in school

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A gang of youths barged into an English-medium school on Dent Mission Road, off Circular Garden Reach Road, on Thursday morning and smashed furniture and windowpanes. They were reacting to alleged negligence by teachers of the school that had resulted in a serious injury to a student. The mayhem continued for 40 minutes, till the police reached the campus.

 On Wednesday, Class VIII student Khush Nawaz reportedly beat up classmate Wasim Akhtar after not being allowed to ?copy? from the latter?s answer script during an examination. Akhtar lost consciousness and had to be admitted to hospital. His father lodged a complaint with Watgunge police.

 On Thursday, the youths turned up to look for the teachers who invigilated in the examination. They felt the teachers could have stopped the fight between the two boys. They refused to discuss the matter with the school authorities.

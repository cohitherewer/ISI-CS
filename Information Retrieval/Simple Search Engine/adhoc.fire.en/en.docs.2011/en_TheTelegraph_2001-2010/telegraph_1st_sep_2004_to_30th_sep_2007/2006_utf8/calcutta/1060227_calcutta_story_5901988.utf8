 STAR GUEST: Will Smith with the Indian Idol finalists

 When he was not partying at Salman Khan?s place or shaking a leg with the Bollywood hot bods in Shah Rukh Khan?s bungalow Mannat, Will Smith was seen having a blast with the Indian Idol 2 finalists at the Kamala Mills set in Mumbai.

 ?I have fallen in love with Indian cinema!? he exclaimed. ?It is difficult for me to understand and pronounce the Hindi words but I love Indian music,? said the man who?s taken over the country in the last few days. 

 Not just that, Smith went on to give excellent vocal tips to the Idol finalists. ?Letting go off the fear to perform in public is very essential for a performer. Thus my remedy is to once in a while scream out loud in public or do something crazy,? he revealed.

 As a token of love and appreciation of visiting the sets, the two Indian Idol female stars, Calcutta girl Antara Mitra and Meenal Jain presented Smith with a royal turban, which the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star carried off in style.

 To catch more of Will mania on Indian Idol, watch the show on Sony, Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 pm.

 Three is company: Ayesha, Arshad and Maria

 Movies and politics have always gone hand in hand. No wonder STAR TV is dubbing the polling process of its popular Sabsey Favourite Kaun Awards as Bollywood Ka Sabsey Bada Election.

 Arshad Warsi, Maria Goretti and Ayesha Takia recently flagged off the Election Express at Filmistan Studios in Mumbai. The Election Express is set to cover 17,000 km throughout the country, travelling to more than 50 towns over 14 states, collecting votes from fans. 

 Like always, this time too Sabsey Favourite Kaun awards will be for popularity and not performance. ?This will be my third year as the host and I enjoy it so much that I will come back from Bangkok just to shoot for the show,? said Arshad.

 Ayesha finds the awards special, too. ?I won the Sabsey Favourite Naya Heroine of last year and it was so encouraging to know that all of India voted for me,? she smiled.

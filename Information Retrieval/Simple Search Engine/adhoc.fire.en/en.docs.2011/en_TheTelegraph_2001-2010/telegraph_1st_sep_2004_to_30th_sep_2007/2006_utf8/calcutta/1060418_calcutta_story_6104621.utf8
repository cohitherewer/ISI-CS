 What: 

 Kolkata Kolkata, a carnival hosted by Concern for Calcutta.

 Where: Vivekananda Park, on Southern Avenue.

 When: April 15 and 16.

 Take a look: As the city celebrated Poila Baisakh with food festivals, cultural programmes and neighbourhood functions, the carnival was an effort to pay tribute to Bengals rich culture, tradition and heritage. 

 A packed venue on Saturday had the young and not-so-young taking a stroll through the stalls set up by rural artisans and enjoying the entertainment on stage.

 From flutes to batik wall hangs to pretty terracotta jewellery? The stalls had artisans from Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum, Burdwan and the suburbs of Calcutta showcasing their talent.

 Children enjoyed themselves at the puppet corner. A potter making diyas and pitchers at the potters wheel had curious onlookers surrounding him. One could take a pick from ceramic jewellery: chunky neckpieces and earrings.

 Masks resembling Chinese emperors were definite eye-catchers. A bahurupee dressed as Shiva drew many curious onlookers. Dhakis playing at regular intervals added to the traditional charm. 

 Table lamps, dish racks and kite-shaped wall hangs in wrought iron were on offer. Also on offer were handmade paper notebooks that had passages from Bob Dylans Blowin In The Wind inscribed on the cover. Then there were cane ware, chatai, jute bag, trendy T-shirt and taant sari.

 On Saturday, an informal chat session moderated by Satinath Mukhopadhyay had musician and food critic Nondon Bagchi, magician P.C. Sorcar (Jr) and singer Swapan Bose holding forth on adda being an integral part of Bengali culture.

 Next up, a chhau dance performance that captivated the audience. Typical big masks, colourful dresses, swift turns and synchronised martial movements matching drum beats? the dancers were a treat to watch.

 The first performance depicted goddess Durga winning over the asuras, the audience applauding as the battle reached its climax. The next, straight from the pages of Mahabharata, showcased Abhimanyu badh.

 Singer Swapan Bose enthralled the audience with tracks like Aage ki sundar din kataitam, Phire phire dak dekhire and Nandalal debdulal. Later in the evening, the band Jowar kept the carnival mood going strong.

 On Sunday, the audience was entertained to Santhal dance performances, Bharatanatyam recitals, the one-act play Noti Binodini and a rocking performance by Cactus. 

 Sip n bite: 

 The food spread included Bengali quick bites like Mochar 

 Chop, Prawn Cutlet, Bhekti Fish Fry, along with some Gujarati 

 and south Indian snacks. 

 Voiceover: In this 

 age of science and technology, the carnival strives to treasure 

 our roots. Children along with their parents can have fun 

 and catch a glimpse of traditional art forms and culture, 

 smiled Tapan Gooptu, president, Concern For Calcutta.

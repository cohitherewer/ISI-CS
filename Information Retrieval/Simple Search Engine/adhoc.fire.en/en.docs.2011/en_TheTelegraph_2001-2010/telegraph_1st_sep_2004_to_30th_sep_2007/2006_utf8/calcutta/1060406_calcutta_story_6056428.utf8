 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Set up in January 2002, this two-storied 

 lifestyle address is home to furniture and accessories marked 

 by style with a capital S. Once you enter the 

 sprawling 11,000 sq ft of Taag Lifestyle at 77B amp; 

 C, Block E, New Alipore, what strikes you first is the flooring 

 that is an eclectic mesh of slate, marble and wood. While 

 some sections have complete wooden flooring, thin panels 

 of wood set in off-white marble and pale slate make quite 

 an impact. 

 There is a wide range to 

 choose from and customer service is top priority. We guarantee 

 quality and attend to complains even after three to four 

 years of purchase, smiles manager Lovely Chowdhury.

 The fare on display has been imported 

 from Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia, Thailand and 

 Indonesia. While the second floor houses high-end furniture, 

 the first floor offers a pocket-friendly range. As you climb 

 the wooden stairs, statues by the sides add to the ambience.

 Bedroom buy

 Different sections of the store 

 that display bedroom sets have been set up to give you a 

 room-like feel ? beds with cheerful bedcovers and cushions, 

 big vases and decor pieces dotting the corners, and table 

 lamps on the side tables. It is not mandatory to go 

 for the complete bedroom set, one is free to pick up single 

 pieces, points out Chowdhury.

 A bedroom set comprises a king-size 

 bed, side tables, a dresser and the wardrobe. Those with 

 metal-finish fittings and simple wood carvings have a Victorian 

 touch, others with straight lines and geometric patterns 

 look very contemporary. 

 From dark teak to pale pine to 

 vintage chestnut to antique cherry, the colour palette will 

 spoil you for choice.

 Sets with queen-size beds, wardrobe 

 and multi-drawers are just right for the guestroom. But 

 the show stealers here are the furniture sets for the childrens 

 room. Made of MDF (medium density fibreboard), space utility 

 is at its best in this section.

 Study-cum-computer tables, modish 

 wardrobe, TV trolley with CD racks, DVD player space and 

 a bed make a complete set. Beds with headboards with a backrest 

 in rexine or fabric ensure the comfort factor.

 Then there are bunk beds where 

 the steps to the higher bunks double as drawers. In a triple 

 bunk bed, the last bunk is detachable. A study table can 

 be extended to create study arrangements for two. The wardrobe 

 in wood and patches of green fibre looks chic.

 Prices start at Rs 51,000.

 Sofa see

 In the sofa section you have fabric 

 ones in sober shades co-ordinated with low centre tables. 

 Some become day beds when required. Those in rattan with 

 a distinct weave and texture have a definite character of 

 their own. While some are in off-white, others peppered 

 with dark tan stand out.

 They come with high pyramid-shaped 

 side tables. A circular centre table with a triangular dent 

 in wood is worth a mention. Also available are recliners 

 in black, brown and cherry and broad low TV units in glass.

 Dining sets come in combinations 

 of wood and rattan. Some with self-embossed glass tables 

 have chairs that are adorned with striped fabric. A card 

 table has additional space for glasses, ashtray and cash. 

 A wooden cover when placed over it makes it look like a 

 normal dining table. The store also offers interesting bar 

 counters, bar stools, CD racks in combination of wood and 

 cane, and magazine holders.

 Prices of the sofa sets start 

 at Rs 26,000.

 Accessories

 The home decor spells elegance, 

 too. Life-size Buddhist monks in black and golden can be 

 placed at the entrance, on the stairs or even in the corners 

 of the room. In lamp shades there are those with cane-like 

 embellishments and ones with wrought iron stands with rams 

 carved at the upper end. 

 Murals, statues, masks and busts?Buddha 

 comes in many forms. Prints placed behind glass and then 

 framed with paper background look cool. 

 Then there are the polyresin swan-like 

 candle stands and ceramic vases in abstract shapes. Paintings 

 include nature and abstract illustrations drawing inspiration 

 from all walks of life.

 Prices start from Rs 700.

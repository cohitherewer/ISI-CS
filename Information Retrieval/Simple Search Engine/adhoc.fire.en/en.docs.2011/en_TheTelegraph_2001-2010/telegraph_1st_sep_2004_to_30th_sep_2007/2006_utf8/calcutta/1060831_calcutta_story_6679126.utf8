 Assault FIR filed by family

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Social worker Rumki Chakraborty on Wednesday filed an FIR at Keorapukur police outpost, alleging an attack on herself and her family members by a neighbour near their Haridevpur residence.

 On Saturday, Goutam Bhattacharya had allegedly hit Rumkis father Rabin on the head with an iron rod. When the 24-year-old and her sister Tamali, 17, tried to protect their father, they, too, were assaulted. A tuft of hair was pulled out of Tamalis head.

 Later on Saturday, both Rabin and Goutam had lodged complaints against each other at the outpost.

 On Monday, Rabin and his daughters met the additional superintendent of police (industrial) D.P. Singh. He advised them to lodge an FIR at the outpost. The sisters also underwent a medical examination at MR Bangur Hospital on Wednesday. A private doctor had examined them earlier. 

 It appeared that the matter was resolved on Saturday, but Goutam continued to threaten us with dire consequences. We cannot move out of our house freely, said Rumki.

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta stated: I have come to know that members of both groups received injuries. I shall meet them to find out what happened and then take action.

 President of the Federation of Consumers Association of West Bengal Mala Banerjee has assured the family of help.

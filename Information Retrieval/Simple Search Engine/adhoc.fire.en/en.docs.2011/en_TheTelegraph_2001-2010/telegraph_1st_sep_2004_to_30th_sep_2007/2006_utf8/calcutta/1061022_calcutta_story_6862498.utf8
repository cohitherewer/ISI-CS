The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pay-cut peeve, no-award anger

 Blog Log

 The European Union court dictum 

 that women taking maternity leave are no longer entitled 

 to equal pay as their male peers has divided the world of 

 bloggers.

 While it is not quite a battle 

 of the sexes, many have welcomed the verdict, while women 

 on both sides of the Atlantic have been vociferous in its 

 denunciation.

 Txfeminist (http://redstatefeminist.blogspot.com) 

 asserts: Mothers shouldnt earn less than their colleagues 

 because they take a maternity leave, because theres no 

 equivalent biological scenario for men and because men partake 

 in the creation of a pregnancy to begin with. Women bear 

 children for both the sexes and procreation is necessary 

 for the survival of the species, therefore to punish women 

 monetarily for her biological part in procreation is obscene, 

 and absurd. She fears that this kind of biological backstabbing 

 would force women to operate like a man (i.e. not bear 

 children).

 Bitch Ph.D (http://bitchphd.blogspot.com) 

 is more circumspect. On the one hand, seniority pay seems 

 reasonable to me. On the other, the simple fact is that 

 men do not take, and are not eligible to take, maternity 

 leave. If a company (or a country) provides maternity leave, 

 but not paternity leave, then paying less to women who take 

 it is, I think, clearly discriminatory. On the other hand, 

 if they offer both maternity and paternity leave, and if 

 the paternity leave is as long as the maternity leave, then 

 Id say fine, legally.

 Back home, J. Alfred Prufrocks 

 public consolation of his blog (and his ego) (http://sadoldbong.bl

 ogspot.com) after not making it 

 to an award shortlist has garnered attention.

 I freely admit that my blog isnt 

 the biggest thing since Desibaba, it cant even claim a 

 wardrobe malfunction. But even so, its my blog and I love 

 it even if its ugly and cross-eyed and I dont want it 

 to suffer from feelings of rejection. So when I find that 

 it has not been shortlisted for the Best Indian Blog by 

 the Asian Blog Awards I feel like a father whose child has 

 been left out of the cast for the school play.

 The Bong blogger is unhappy with 

 the award panel, but Jacqui Cheng (http://arstechnica.com) 

 has pointed out a far more disturbing trend in blogosphere: 

 What you say on your blog or in an online forum could get 

 you sued for libel, and you might not be ready for it. Over 

 50 libel lawsuits have been filed (in the US) in the last 

 two years against those venting their thoughts online, with 

 one lawsuit being successful and resulting in the blogger 

 paying a fine of $50,000. The lawsuits so far run the gamut 

 from bloggers being sued over public gossip about intimate 

 events, to warning others not to date certain people, to 

 unauthorised photos posted on MySpace, to religious criticism, 

 and more.

 Not that its stopping Indians 

 from going online with gusto. Rashmi Bansal (http://youthcurry.blo

 gspot.com) points out that 

 even the Mumbai dabbawalas have launched their website 

 (www.mydabbawala.com), making it easier for prospective 

 customers to contact them. Not a very well designed or 

 functional site but a small step forward. You can apply 

 dabba online which currently means you can email 

 them your interest in their services. She suggests that 

 the dabbawalas put up a payment gateway.

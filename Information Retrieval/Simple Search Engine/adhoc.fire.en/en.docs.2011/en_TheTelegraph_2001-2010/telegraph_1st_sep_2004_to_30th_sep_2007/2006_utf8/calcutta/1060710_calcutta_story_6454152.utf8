Life

 Shes 

 going, going, gone... not again!

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 

 WONDERS WHY WOMEN IN THE MOVIES DONT DEMAND A DIGNIFIED 

 DEATH OR, BETTER STILL, LIFE

 SEX amp; THE 

 CITY

 I watched Krrish, the sequel 

 to Koi... Mil Gaya, the other day. I am disturbed. 

 Not because Hrithik Roshan is so perfectly proportioned 

 that he looks computer-generated. Not because though he 

 takes giant leaps through special effects to land on the 

 tallest buildings in Singapore, when it comes to seeing 

 the future ? Hrithik Senior, the ongoing Hrithiks 

 father and the hero of Koi... Mil Gaya, had invented 

 a time machine that can do that ? it is a pretty scene of 

 domestic bliss in flashback, where Preity Zinta, Hrithik 

 Seniors wife, nestles at her breast her newborn who 

 is going to turn into Hrithik Junior. 

 If that is what the future means 

 to an India, what happens to the investors of Infosys?

 There was much greater reason 

 for concern. It had to do with two photographs. One Hrithik 

 Seniors, one Preity Zintas. Both were garlanded 

 from the beginning, because the audience was told that they 

 were dead. 

 Hrithik Sr was apparently killed 

 just after inventing the machine by a madman dreaming of 

 world domination, and Preity died of heartbreak on hearing 

 the news. 

 But towards the end of the film 

 it is revealed ? sorry for giving away the end, but this 

 wasnt exactly a thriller ? that Hrithik Senior isnt 

 dead at all. 

 He is in the clutches of the madman 

 and in very bad make-up, but is eventually rescued by Hrithik 

 Junior.

 To come together in a Kodak moment 

 on the balcony, with the two Hrithiks, Rekha, Hrithik Seniors 

 mother and Priyanka Chopra, Hrithik Juniors sweetheart, 

 with Jaadu, the ET character from Koi... Mil Gaya, 

 twinkling in the sky.

 Even he has a place. But Preity 

 remains the photograph that she was. Presumably with a fresh 

 garland.

 The future may have been reinvented 

 in the popular imagination, but its moorings remain the 

 same. The woman is got rid of as easily.

 It is not only a question of Preity 

 Zintas expensive dates. The woman can be easily bumped 

 off from the scheme of life, whenever it is necessary.

 It happened spectacularly in another 

 fairly recent Hindi film landmark: Dil Chahta Hai. 

 Otherwise tolerant of women ? it showed women sipping on 

 wine unselfconsciously with the men ? DCH had to 

 just kill Dimple Kapadia off.

 The poor, beautiful womans 

 only crime was that a man young enough to be her son had 

 fallen in love with her, with every intention of marrying 

 her. 

 Now that is a threat to society 

 like no other ? and the guilt induced in her must have been 

 enough to lead to cancer, or whatever terminal disease she 

 dies of. She dies quietly, without any fuss. 

 But the film doesnt end 

 before lover boy finds the right girl the right age, wandering 

 like a waif on a lonely beach in Goa, a romantic image.

 The social fabric is mended; the 

 correct man-woman relationship resumed. Even MLA Fatakeshto 

 with the redoubtable Mithun at its helm can remedy many 

 social evils, but not this. Debasree Roy, who plays his 

 wife, has to go up in flames in an instant when the bad 

 guy sets the basti on fire. Dead. Kaput. Finito. 

 (But the boy-child survives. So he does in Krrish. 

 Would a sequel have been possible if it were a girl?)

 But the men have been so privileged 

 in their deaths, moving longingly, lingeringly towards their 

 end, the camera loving every moment of it, the slow destruction 

 of a man a terrific build-up to the ultimate orgasm: death.

 In Renaissance literature, to 

 die could mean to have sex. Hamlet is 

 one long death-wish by a man.. To die: to sleep;/ 

 No more; and by a sleep to say we end/ The heartache and 

 the thousand natural shocks/ That flesh is heir to, tis 

 a consummation/ Devoutly to be wishd, says Hamlet. 

 Does he really mean what he says? 

 Remember Devdas, now more 

 famous as Shah Rukh Khan? He couldnt make up his mind 

 and took it out all on his women; he drank and he drank 

 and killed himself. 

 Guru Dutts characters ? 

 except for the lady who did in Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam, 

 virtually directed by Dutt ? had the same shades, 

 leading to immense lengths of celluloid. Such wallowing 

 in self-pity, leading to such alcohol problems, is an extreme 

 form of narcissism, permissible only in men. If women do 

 it, they will be called rotten. 

 Actually Hamlet started it all. 

 He showed how men and women should die. The Prince of Denmark 

 suspects his uncle has killed his father and is sleeping 

 with his mother. He loses it and takes it all out on the 

 petite Ophelia, whom he supposedly loves. 

 He calls her names and abuses 

 her terribly. The girl has a nervous breakdown and her body 

 is discovered floating on a stream, surrounded beautifully 

 by flowers called dead mens fingers.

 She has become a decorative piece, 

 which a pre-Raphaelite later made into a pretty picture. 

 But Hamlet, luxuriating through his vacillations and tendencies 

 towards self-annihilation, went on to become one of the 

 finest insights into the human mind ? in five long acts 

 ? and also probably led to Freud.

 Then came Rajesh Khanna, who became 

 a superstar in the 70s because of the way he was indulged 

 to die. He did it in Namak Haram, he did it in Safar, 

 and he did it best in Anand. In Anand, the 

 chants from all Indian mainstream religions mixed with his 

 dying gasps remains one of the most rousing crescendos of 

 Indian cinema, a statement of courage, hope and the human 

 spirit, till the life support system gives way.

 Thats the power and the 

 glory of tragedy, which eludes women. Then Anands 

 spirit came back in the form of Shah Rukh Khan in Kal 

 Ho Naa Ho. We all know even in this age of shorter, 

 smarter films, he took three hours to die. 

 Only one other woman from Hindi 

 films comes to mind who received this honour: Mili. And 

 Radha, Lord Krishnas paramour, often got mixed up 

 between the blue god and death and longed for both. She 

 got one, but didnt get the other, but does anyone 

 really know what happened to her after Krishna turned politician?

 And I will not even begin to talk 

 about the countless times the vamps, Bindu and Helen, took 

 a bullet on their chests to save the hero, just after having 

 changed their heart to gold. 

 Why didnt the women turn 

 back and demand a longer, more dignified death? How could 

 they? To give them significance in death is to give them 

 significance. What will we do with this pile of dead women? 

 They threaten to haunt our futures, whatever it is.

 Roof rules for sound sleep 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 If you have a split or a sloping ceiling, then it is always advisable to sleep under the highest point. if you sleep under the lowest point, the Chi flowing above is suppressed and may cause a lot of pressure on you. This will cause headaches and uneasiness

Q: I am about to get married and my room has been newly renovated. It has been designed in a way that there is a false ceiling that is sloping. My bed is under the lowest point of the ceiling and I cannot move it from there. I have not been comfortable while sleeping ever since the renovation and I think it could be because of the false ceiling. Can the ceiling have any effect on my sleep?

 Ashish Gupta

 THE SOLUTION: If you have a split or a sloping ceiling, then it is always advisable to sleep under the highest point. Since you are sleeping under the lowest point, the Chi flowing above is suppressed and may cause a lot of pressure on you. This will cause headaches and uneasiness. 

 If you cant relocate your bed, then paste a wallpaper on the ceiling that depicts stripes going up. These help lift the energy upwards and rectify the problem to a great extent. You can also try placing a picture or painting of growing trees or flowers on the wall behind the bed.

 Tuition trouble 

 Q: My date of birth is October 25, 1979. I give tuition to a few students at my residence. The problem is that the number of students is not going up at all. Please advise. 

 Name withheld

 THE SOLUTION: It is important that the room you use for giving tuitions is in the eastern part of the house. East is filled with energy of the rising sun and this represents growth. 

 Face east while teaching and energise the north-west of the room with pictures of children studying. These will help to spread the word, which will automatically increase the networking and multiply the number of students. 

 Another powerful tip is to stand in front of the north-west corner and visualise that the students are increasing in numbers. Place something heavy made of earth in the south-west to give stability to your chosen profession. 

 Picture perfect 

 Q: We have recently got three big photographs clicked of the family. The first one has my wife and me with our three children, the second one is that of the three children together and the third is a photograph of the two of us. I am a little confused about the right placement of these photographs according to Feng Shui and would like your tips on how and where to keep them. I am a practicing chartered accountant.

 Ajit Jain

 THE SOLUTION: East is the family area and displaying the photograph of all of you together here will help strengthen bonding in the entire family. West is the childrens area where the picture of the three kids can be placed. This will help enhance their future, as the sun sets in the west. 

 South-west is the best area for energising your marriage with photographs of just the two of you. 

 Success steps 

 Q: My date of birth is 08.10.1987. I am a college student and am not experiencing any notable success in academics, however hard I try. Its not that I fail in all competitions, but I can never achieve what I desire. I face west while studying and I also dont really pile up books on the table. I will be glad if you tell me what I should do to see some success.

 Samik Mukherjee

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong metal person and are presently going through the period of metal itself, which is making you a little uncomfortable. Your life will take a positive turn from the year 2007.

 Water element represents your intelligence, which means that any profession connected with this element will help you generate money. The options are media, communication, banking, finance and management. 

 Do not study facing west as this direction is afflicted this year and, moreover, you belong to the east group where north, south, east and south-east happen to be your good directions. Tap energy from water and wood elements by surrounding yourself with a blue-green colour scheme.

 Fishy facts

 Q: Please suggest an ideal placement for fish aquariums in the house.

 Arun Kumar Panjani

 THE SOLUTION: Aquariums are best placed in the north of the house to enhance career and business opportunities. To maintain harmony among family members, they can be placed in the east. 

 To enhance your wealth, aquariums can be placed in the south-east, where continuous movement of fish will help in rolling the finances and multiplying them. Please ensure that the aquariums are not placed in the bedroom.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hawkers hog roads

 KINSUK BASU

 Planning to step out for Puja shopping? Make sure to keep extra hours and oodles of expendable energy in hand and to keep the car at home. This is the statutory warning against pre-Puja snarls, sounded by the traffic police.

 As the countdown calendar to the late-September celebrations shows less than a fortnight to go, traffic on some of the major arterial roads in the city centre has slowed down to a crawl.

 As if the rising car count and the paltry road space werent bad enough, the hawkers making a grand comeback has forced pre-Puja pedestrians off the pavements and on to the streets.

 The area around Burrabazar and Canning Street is in a mess, as all major wholesale markets are located in that zone. With hand-pulled carts, rickshaws, vans and other vehicles clogging the chaotic streets, there is hardly any space left for vehicular movement, claimed a senior officer of the headquarters traffic guard.

 With Puja buyers on the prowl and hawkers desperate to cash in, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Brabourne Road, Kalakar Street, Burtola Street and Cotton Street have been overrun by frenzied feet.

 And then there are the road repairs. Work on concretising the tram tracks along Bidhan Sarani is yet to be completed and to make matters worse, you have a large market along this street. With the pavements encroached upon by hawkers, where do the pedestrians go? And if the roadspace is used by them, what about the vehicles? wondered a traffic sergeant.

 So, from Hatibagan to Shyambazar, traffic has moved in slow motion this week. Rush-hour traffic was really bad on Tuesday, as a tram jumped the rails on RG Kar Road and two other trams were stuck behind it. Traffic along the stretch was hit between 10 am and 10.45 am, the sergeant added.

 The streetside story is only slightly better down south. Tollygunge Circular Road is badly hit and the Gariahat-Ballygunge stretch is getting there.

 So, what is the way out? Avoid taking your car for shopping; when not shopping, avoid roads leading to major markets, summed up Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic).

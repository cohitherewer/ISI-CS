Life

 Lone lady on a house hunt

Back in the city after a few years, Chandrima 

S. Bhattacharya faces everything from the grumble to the gape while looking 

for a rented place as the bhadralok and the landlord come together

 The bhadralok is a privileged social class that emerged in Bengal under the impact of British rule. The landlord goes back to earlier times. When they come together, which is often, the effect is deadly, especially for a woman house-hunting alone. 

 I am just back to Calcutta after a few years in Mumbai. I wanted to rent a house. Heres what I got.

 As I pushed back the iron gate that led to the apartment block in EE Block in Salt Lake, I was greeted the usual Calcutta way. The watchman stretched his hands and yawned hard, to show how deep the dark cavity of his mouth was, and pointed upwards to the first floor.

 It was a hot April afternoon. I was meeting my first prospective landlord in Calcutta. I pushed the doorbell. A middle-aged woman wearing a nightie with a dupatta draped around her upper body opened the door. Ashun didimoni, she said. (It roughly translates as Come in, madam, but not quite. Didimoni is what the tea-stall owner calls you. It made me uncomfortable. They owned a two-roomed flat in Salt Lake. The biggest thing I own is a fridge. Was it deference to my jeans?)

 But I soon got to know who the boss was. The landlord motioned me with a grand sweep of his hand to sit down on the mat opposite him.

 He seemed to be in his early forties. He was plump, extremely fair and his bare upper body was glistening with sweat. He had the look of someone who has just been disturbed in his sleep. 

 We had a brief discussion about the rent and maintenance and I agreed readily to all his terms. 

 Then, because some of my journalist colleagues have suffered at the hands of landlords because of their odd hours, I decided to come clean. 

 One thing. I will come back home at very late hours, I said. 

 How late? 10 clock? the landlord demanded. 

 No, it could be much later, I answered. 

 How late? he asked again.

 Well, on certain days, it could be 2.30 in the morning, I said, trying to figure that would not be very late, yet not too early either.

 2.30! the man exclaimed. The woman looked grim.

 Why? the man asked. 

 Because I work for a newspaper, I said. I was losing my fear.

 Since most of my friends are journalists, they will also drop in from time to time, very late, I added.

 How late? the landlord asked again.

 2.30. Or even later, I said. 

 Do you have boyfriends? it was the woman. 

 I had told her I was married. I told her what I had told her. 

 Yes, but you are talking about strange things. All sorts of friends. I want to know if there will be men here. Suppose, her voice was gentler, one particular man comes back home with you. Suppose for five days. Everyday after 10 in the night. How will I face my neighbours?

 I said that my friends neighbours were not known to complain very much.

 Do you also visit your friends at 2.30? the man asked. 

 I suddenly felt that they would have liked me better if I had a dupatta thrown on my shoulders, too.

 Yes, I do, I said. 

 The man was holding his breath. Something important would come out of him now. 

 Can I ask you something? I want to know this because I am really very curious, he said.

 He lowered his voice but thrust his head forward. I really want to know because I have never met anyone like you, he repeated. But when your friends drop in at 2.30, what do you all DO? 

 I ran away and oiled my hair. I eventually found a house, but not before encountering a few more would be landlords, who asked probing questions. 

 Last week, I eventually signed the agreement with the gentleman who finally agreed to take me in as a tenant.

 But our lawyer does not approve of me whole-heartedly. I found that my surname was replaced by my husbands on the agreement. (My husband is away mostly; which explains my lone battles.)

 But when I told my lawyer that I didnt like it one bit, he looked at me strangely and said that it was legally binding on me as a married Hindu woman to use my husbands surname. 

 In Mumbai, I had come across severe problems. A broker had asked me what my caste was. Hindu, or Muslim? he had prodded, when I had looked bewildered.

 Good, madam, if you were Muslim we wouldnt have been able to help you. I was looking for a house in Kandivli, where Muslims are not allowed. It was also extremely embarrassing for me when I failed to find a Muslim friend a house in my locality.

 But then the brokers didnt claim to be bhadraloks. And when I told my first broker that there would be friends, sometimes parties, she had said: Invite me. 

 My last landlord in Mumbai, though, has accused me of running away with a fluorescent light and its holder. But I am sure that is not because of my gender. 

 I wish myself the best in Calcutta.

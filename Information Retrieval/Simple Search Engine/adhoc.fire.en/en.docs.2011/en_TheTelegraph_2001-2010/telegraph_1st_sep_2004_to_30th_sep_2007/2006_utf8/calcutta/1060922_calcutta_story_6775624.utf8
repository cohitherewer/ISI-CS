 Mahalaya amp; eclipse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With an annular solar eclipse coinciding with Mahalaya, Friday will present the devout an especially auspicious occasion to offer tarpan in the Hooghly. The priests are hence preparing for a rush.

 According to them, tarpan should be offered before noon, during the new moon.

 The Sun, Jupiter and the Mars will be in perfect alignment on Friday. The planetary positions will be perfect for seeking blessings from ones ancestors as well as from the gods and goddesses, explained Nitai Chakraborty, president of Vedic Pandit O Purohit Mahamilan Kendra.

 There was an annular eclipse on Mahalaya last year, too, but the positions of the other planets were not as propitious.

 Astrologers believe that even though the eclipse will not be seen in India (or the rest of Asia), it will have a positive impact on the country.

 The positions of the Sun, Jupiter and the Mars will bring progress, success and joy to India for the next three years, stated astrologer Pankaj Ganguly.

 Films, like pictures, convey a thousand messages. And they are, indeed, the best media to reach the masses. 

 In an attempt to sensitise people to issues pertaining to the physically challenged, Look At Me, a disability awareness film festival, is currently on in the city.

 Organised by Trinayani, a Calcutta-based trust, more than 15 movies, short films and documentaries will be screened at 10 schools and colleges across the city. 

 Most of us are ignorant about issues related to disability. Our reactions are the outcome of this ignorance. We are attempting to expose the common man to a world which he is not aware of, said Ritika Sahni, singer, activist and secretary of Trinayani.

 The 10-day festival started with the screening of Iranian film Colour of Paradise, by Majid Majidi, at RN Singh Memorial School on November 13. 

 The festival will also feature a few famous films, like In the Land of the Deaf, Colour of the Blind by Chen Guoxing, Iqbal by Nagesh Kukunoor, Anjali by Mani Ratnam and Chhoo Lengay Akash by Virendra Saini. 

 The world over, disability awareness film festivals have become a popular and effective medium for breaking down stereotypes, explained Sahni. 

 Students attending the screening were touched by the movies. 

 I am really moved by the story of Kamal, the boy who transcribed Wings of Fire, written by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, into Braille. He achieved something that we cannot even think of, said Sayani Paul, a Class X student of RN Singh Memorial School. 

 The trust is also celebrating Childrens Day with a difference. In association with Calcutta Metropolitan Round Table 41, Calcutta Metropolitan Ladies Circle and the National Association of the Blind, the trust has managed to rope in Bollywood actor Boman Irani for a special screening of the Sanjay Dutt-starrer Munna Bhai MBBS. 

 We are going to screen an audio-described version of Munna Bhai MBBS for blind students from five schools, along with other students, said Sahni. 

 Besides screening the films in the schools like Akshar, Apeejay, National Gems Higher Secondary School and Heritage School, Trinayani is also organising workshops on understanding disability at Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute and National Gems Higher Secondary school on November 18. 

 The workshop and the festival are attempts to remove the social barriers and bring the physically-challenged people to the mainstream, signed off Sahni.

 Naveen Andrews plays Sayid in Lost

 The multiple-award winning mini-series Lost returns for a second season of action-packed mystery and adventure on Thursday, at 9 pm on STAR Movies. The story continues from where the last season ended after Oceanic Air Flight 815 was torn apart in mid-air and crashed on a Pacific island. 

 By now, the survivors have got accustomed to living on the island. Indian actor Naveen Andrews (Kama Sutra, Bride amp; Prejudice) also returns as Sayid in Season Two of Lost and this is what he had to say about his second outing.

 Were you disappointed 

 by the lack of information given in Season One?

 We have to sustain the audiences interest. You cant give the audience too much. You have to keep them wanting more. Its frustrating Im sure, and sometime its frustrating to play, but thats TV.

 Whats the toughest part 

 of being on the show?

 The fact that you have to sustain a performance over 10 months playing the same character. Its a discipline. Theres a temptation to try and come up with new, fresh ways of playing the character that may not necessarily be true to the character.

 Have things changed a lot for 

 you with the success of Lost?

 One of the nicest things about being in Hawaii is that were away from all that bullshit. Were not really aware of it in the same way as we would be if we were in LA. 

 Are you getting better opportunities?

 Oh yeah, definitely. And I have to face the fact that a lot of people watch television. Its a different level of fame. Its not like an arthouse movie kind of thing. You literally are in peoples homes. 

 Do the makers keep you in the 

 dark?

 For me personally Im pretty much in the dark. If I have an episode that features the Sayid character then I will know something about whats going to happen, but generally no. I dont really know whats coming around the corner. 

 Im very pleased with the work that we did last year. It seemed to have some kind of real resonance and with Sayid in particular, Im pleased. There seems to be a real human being there and I just feel that we only touched the tip of the iceberg. The kind of character that he is, theres so much more that he has to reveal.

 Whats been the most rewarding 

 part of playing Sayid?

 Discovering that he has a real romantic side to him that was not immediately apparent with someone whod been involved with torturing people and brutalising them. He is capable of great tenderness that you dont see that much in this show. 

 Youve emerged as a sex 

 symbol...

 Well, its flattering that the character is perceived in that way, but thats what it is. Its a character. Im an actor. I play a role and thats not me. What Im doing is a character.

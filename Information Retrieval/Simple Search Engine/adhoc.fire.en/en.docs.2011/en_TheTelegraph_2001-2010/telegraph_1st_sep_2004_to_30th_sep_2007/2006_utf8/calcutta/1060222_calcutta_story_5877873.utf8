 Minister firm on bill block

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Without naming environment minister Manab Mukherjee, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah on Tuesday clarified that he will not withdraw his objections to the East Calcutta Wetlands Bill recently tabled by Mukherjee in the Assembly.

 ?I am not going to backtrack. I have instructed my joint secretary, who has written to the environment department. The matter is in the Supreme Court. But I haven?t given up,? Mollah asserted. He was replying to a query raised by Trinamul Congress MLA Tapas Roy. 

 Mollah had objected to a change in the character of dags 771 to 775 in Dhapa Manpur mouza, shown as urban/ rural settlements in the wetlands bill . According to Mollah, the bill describes the plots as urban/rural settlements, whereas the Institute of Wetland Management had found these to be waterbodies, following a spot inspection. 

 The state recently contested the claims of some promoters in Calcutta High Court and won the case. The promoters have now moved to the apex court. The bill has been referred to an Assembly standing committee, which will submit its report by March 9 and discussions will be held on March 10.

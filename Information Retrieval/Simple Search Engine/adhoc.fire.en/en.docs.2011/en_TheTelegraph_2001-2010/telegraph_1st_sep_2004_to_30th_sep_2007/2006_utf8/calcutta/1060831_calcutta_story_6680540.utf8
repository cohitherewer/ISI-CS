The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Men should be powerful amp; women sexy

 No one fits the tag of Sarkar better than RAM GOPAL VARMA himself. Pratim D. Gupta brings a clutch of quotable quotes from the mans first city trip

 After watching Amitabh 

 Bachchan perform in Sarkar and now in Nishabd, 

 Varma doesnt know what acting means

 This is my first visit to 

 Calcutta. I have never been here. And this time 

 also, I couldnt see the place. I came in the morning. I 

 am off to Patna in the evening.

 Shiva is the remake of 

 my first film. That was set in the college campus. This 

 one has the same premise but is set in the police station. 

 I wanted to explore what happens to a man who finishes 

 his police training and becomes a sub-inspector in Mumbai, 

 the clash between the idealism of a police academy and the 

 practicality of a big city police station.

 Shiva is what you call 

 new wine in old bottle. I wanted to make the same story 

 with contemporary techniques like surround sound and new 

 editing patterns which I didnt have in 1990-91. Also, I 

 wanted to go back to my roots. See, we are no longer the 

 same people. So even if we treat the same subject it will 

 be different after 15 years. Then I was younger, my experience 

 was lesser. Making Shiva all over again was a 

 nostalgic trip.

 The genre of action movies has 

 disappeared in the last few years. I want to bring back 

 that raw and realistic action of the 1970s when the best 

 of Mr Bachchans films were released. When Mr Bachchan 

 took the five-year sabbatical, heroism ended. When he 

 came back, he was the superhero. There was no more realism 

 in films like Shahenshah. Then the music companies 

 took over and used movies as vehicles for their music videos.

 Every film is the reflection 

 of a state of mind. Satya and Company were 

 essentially relationship films. Shiva brings back 

 the hero-villain divide. The honest cop against a corrupt 

 system has been done to death since Zanjeer and at 

 least 100 films have been made on the topic. I myself 

 made Ab Tak Chhappan and Shool. So they 

 are all the same story, its how you shape up the characters.

 Mohit Ahlawat is someone whom 

 I have liked from the time he walked into my office. I 

 liked his stare. Initially I thought of him as a negative 

 character. But then I changed my mind and looked at him 

 in the action hero mould. Yes, he did James, which 

 flopped. But in Shiva his character has been developed 

 differently.

 Shiva is the new girl 

 in my life.

 Viewers are not animals. 

 They can be divided into romantic film viewers and action 

 film viewers. You may say that people today are not watching 

 action films. I may say that directors today are not making 

 action films. So it is a question of whether they are watching 

 or we are making. If personally you dont like action 

 films, you dont have to watch Shiva.

 Stars can be good or bad. 

 Sometimes their experience or image can help the film. Sometimes 

 the baggage they carry can be irritating. 

 No actor is trained. Ninety 

 per cent of actors in our industry are not trained. 

 The clarity of the characters matters.

 Unlike my other films, Shiva 

 does have songs. There are two-and-a-half songs, composed 

 by Illaya Raja. Thats because Shiva is a formula 

 film.

 Sholay does not have any 

 flaws. It is like Ramayana. Just like you 

 like to hear Ramayana again and again, you like to 

 see Sholay again and again. Ramayana comes 

 in different forms to you. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Sholay 

 is my form of Sholay.

 Picture by Aranya Sen

 I have never done anything 

 original. Every single shot in my films is copied from 

 somewhere. Ive copied from Spielberg, Shyam Benegal, Ramsay 

 brothers, etc.

 The opening shot of Company 

 has eagles flying over the city of Mumbai. Thats copied 

 from Mackennas Gold. It wasnt in the original script. 

 My cameraman just found it in the sky. While watching the 

 rushes, I thought of Mackennas Gold. To incorporate 

 the shot, I had a voiceover saying: Very few people know 

 that eagles wait for a month for their prey. Few people 

 know it because I made it up.

 I would like to have Shivas work 

 but not be like him. I am a big conman and I dont stand 

 up for anything.

 Cinema is not about storytelling; 

 it is about manipulating emotions. Why are bestsellers 

 made into movies? Because they just love the action in the 

 plot, or something sensual or something that scares you, 

 not the story. The idea is to create an atmosphere. It has 

 a lot to do with the moods.

 My all-time favourite film 

 is Sholay and it is indeed a dream job to remake 

 it with my chosen cast.

 Apart from Sholay, I grew 

 up watching Shyam Benegals Kalyug and Ankur, 

 Ramsay Brothers Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche, Gulzars 

 Angoor. These are Hindi films. Then I liked Spielberg, 

 and films like Mackennas Gold

 My cinema is about larger-than-life 

 people. My cinema is about heroes. For me, men should 

 be powerful, women should be sexy.

 The reason Ram Gopal Varma 

 Ki Sholay hasnt happened yet is because things got 

 delayed after Mr Bachchans illness. Now it is time 

 to take it forward. In the middle I got time to make Shiva 

 and Nishabd. 

 What is the story of Sholay? 

 Sholay is about a cop who hires two people to kill 

 the man who wiped out his family. With my Sholay, 

 I am trying to visualise the same story in 2006 Mumbai. 

 Here, an encounter cop hires two goons to kill a gangster 

 who finished his family. So the plotline is the same. But 

 when you bring the Mumbai underworld into the whole set-up, 

 the dynamics change.

 Sarkar may have not looked 

 like Godfather, but I can tell all Sholay fans 

 that my version will be like the original Sholay. 

 They will be able to find all the reference points from 

 the original film.

 For the first time I want to break 

 rhythms with Sholay. I have always cast people according 

 to their images. But here I am doing a reverse casting. 

 Ajay Devgan doesnt look or sound like Dharmendra from any 

 angle but he is my Veeru.

 I believe in surprising audiences. 

 I think if you surprise them at the theatres, then the plan 

 may go wrong. But if you acclimatise them to the surprise 

 through TV campaign before the release, then they will accept 

 the change. You have to give the audience some time.

 I wont say anything about Karan 

 Johar anymore. He is James Cameron and KANK his 

 Titanic.

 Nishabd is not Lolita. 

 Lolita is about a man obsessed with a 14-year-old 

 underage girl. My concept of Nishabd is bodies 

 age, but feelings dont. So it is more of a modern 

 conflict in the mind of an old man. When you lust for someone, 

 the sense of responsibility holds you back. But what happens 

 when the attraction is bigger than the feeling of responsibility? 

 Thats what Nishabd is about.

 Mr Bachchan is very difficult 

 to define. After watching him I dont know what the word 

 actor means. With him, acting is not just emoting. When 

 he is given a situation, he tries to grab the emotions from 

 his observations of real life and then feeling that intensity, 

 he delivers the performance for the camera at my cue of 

 Action!

 Im an illiterate. I dont 

 know Shakespeare. All I have read is Frederick Forsyth, 

 Alistair Maclean and a few comic books. I havent seen 

 Satyajit Ray. I havent seen Eisenstein. Thats why 

 I remake the films I have seen Godfather, Sholay 

 and even Shiva.

 DNA tests to net culprits

 - DEAD INFANT DUG UP

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A DNA test will be carried out on the samples collected from the body of a newborn boy found buried in the compound of a Jodhpur Park house on March 22.

 ?A few individuals are under our scanner. The DNA test will help us ascertain if any of them was involved in burying the child,? said N. Ramesh Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south). The report, he added, will come in a few days.

 The body of the 10-day-old was buried in a narrow stretch of soil on the southern side of the two-storeyed house at 285A, Jodhpur Park. 

 On landlady Bithi Ghosh?s orders, family gardener Yudhisthir Koyal was levelling the stretch when he stumbled upon the baby in a large rat hole.

 The post-mortem report has pointed out that the baby died after suffering an injury on the left side of the head.

 Officers of the Lake police station have decided to inquire about the domestic help of the tenant. 

 Sleuths think the culprits had frequented the house before, as they were certain about two things ? that there was a loose stretch of soil on the southern side of the house and that the western side would not be safe for burying the child.

 The loose stretch existed as the garden on the southern side had not been attended to for days. 

 It was a coincidence that Bithi Ghosh had asked Yudhisthir to level the ground on March 22 morning, leading to the discovery. 

 Had she not done so, the culprits might have taken out the body that night and dumped it in a dustbin next to the house, opposite a nursing home.

 ?There was another reason for choosing the house. The culprits avoided the lawn of the house next door because they knew it would be difficult to get past the guard who slept near the iron gate,? said an officer of Lake police station.

 ?Ghosh?s house was an easier target. Besides this was the only house in the vicinity that had a garden,? the officer added.

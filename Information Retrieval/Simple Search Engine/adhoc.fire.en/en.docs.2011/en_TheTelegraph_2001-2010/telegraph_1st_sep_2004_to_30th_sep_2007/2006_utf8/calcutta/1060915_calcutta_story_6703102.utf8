 Empty your bags, step through a metal detector, remember that every move you make is being watched by private security guards or a spycam no, you are not in the airport departure lounge; you are at your para pandal.

 This Durga puja, several pandals might resemble high-security zones, thanks to a rare public-private partnership. Following the serial blasts in Mumbai and the tension in the air over terror attacks, police and puja organisers are gearing up with several safety-first measures for the five-day festival.

 If police are raring to train volunteers of popular pujas to spot troublemakers and tackle an emergency, organisers with big budgets are roping in private security agencies for machine and manpower.

 Police are particularly worried about a rumour or a bomb hoax causing chaos at a congested pandal. This year, we must have a safe and hassle-free Puja, said Pradip Kumar Chatterjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 Among the police-public plans being drawn up is the training of volunteers in how to profile suspicious elements in or around a pandal, how to carry out spot checks and how to tackle a crisis like a hoax call.

 If a crash course in criminal profiling may sound slightly fanciful, more pragmatic steps are being taken by individual puja committees. Many are hiring private security guards, installing metal detectors and hand-held scanners to rein in rowdy revellers and mischief-makers.

 At some pandals, the police-public partnership will peak. With Calcutta Police, we will be installing close-circuit cameras everywhere. These will transmit pictures directly to the Lalbazar headquarters. We will also have more than 200 volunteers manning the crowd, says Dinesh Bajaj, vice-chairman of the Mohammad Ali Park puja.

 Suruchi Sangha in New Alipore has decided to deploy 200 private security guards and set up close-circuit cameras right from the pandal to Chetla Pumping Station. Netaji Sporting Club in Lake Town will depend on metal detectors and special security cover.

 Some organisers have approached us for a security blueprint. After inspecting their pandals, we will guide them on positioning volunteers, entries and exits and other security matters, say Satnam Singh Ahluwalia, CEO, OSDA Security Group.

 The flip side of heightened security measures is, of course, a slowdown in footfall. People hop, skip and jump from one pandal to another; can you imagine the chaos if they are held up by bag checks and metal detectors? said one organiser shunning extra security.

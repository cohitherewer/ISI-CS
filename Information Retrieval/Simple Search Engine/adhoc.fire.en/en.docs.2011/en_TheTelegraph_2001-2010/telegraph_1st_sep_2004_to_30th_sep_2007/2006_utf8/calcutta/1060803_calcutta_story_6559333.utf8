 SHAUN KENWORTHY

 Is Mr Willy Wonka really the cleverest 

 chocolate-maker in the world?

 My dear boy, said 

 grandpa Joe, raising himself up a little higher on his pillow, 

 Mr Willy Wonka is the most amazing, the most fantastic, 

 the most extraordinary chocolate maker the world has ever 

 seen! I thought everybody knew that!

 And that, at least for me, was 

 how it all began! Charlie and the Chocolate Factory still 

 conjures up magical memories for me. My life was never the 

 same after reading that book. Even now when I think of it, 

 I have tingles going down my spine.

 I suppose the day was going to 

 come when Id feel the urge to get down and dirty and 

 tell you as much as I can, at least over the next three 

 weeks, about the stuff that I just couldnt imagine 

 life without. 

 l manner of words spring to mind 

 when I think of the melted rude stuff, naughty, sinful, 

 vulgar, filthy but even words like that just cant 

 express what chocolate really is. The industry is huge and 

 now even Asia is starting to catch on to just how life-changing 

 chocolate can be if you allow it to seep into your lives.

 The story of what we know as chocolate 

 today begins in Mexico, sometime in the early 1600s with 

 a royal drink called Chocolatl, meaning warm liquid. The 

 Aztecs had been drinking this for thousands of years, but 

 it was so bitter that the Spaniards hated it. When they 

 took the cocoa bean and the idea of the drink back to Spain, 

 they added vanilla and honey and decided it tasted far better 

 hot. It became a hit and the Spanish planted cocoa in all 

 their overseas colonies. It was a secret for many years 

 until the Spanish monks somehow accidentally told the rest 

 of Europe (and thank the heavenly Father they did). The 

 steam engine mechanised cocoa grinding by 1730 and the invention 

 of the cocoa press in the 1820s reduced the price and removed 

 the cocoa fat, which made for a much smoother drink. 

 The next two big revolutionary 

 changes in chocolate came with the introduction of solid 

 eating chocolate in the 1840s. We British are famed with 

 giving the world its first chocolate bars, but unfortunately 

 for the Brits, the French and Swiss really got it together 

 and made chocolate, internationally at least what it is 

 today.

 Its amazing how far chocolate 

 has come over the ages. It first cropped up in culinary 

 recipes and writings by the early 1700s and its use has 

 increased by the day since. Chocolate is used either on 

 its own or in cakes and desserts but you find the occasional 

 recipe where chocolate is sometimes used to finish a sauce 

 in savoury cooking. These sauces generally crop up in Mexico, 

 but I, too, have used chocolate in many sauces and it goes 

 well with game.

 Next week Ill tell you a 

 little bit about the process of making chocolate from bean 

 to the bar but in the meantime, Im giving you a recipe 

 for this extremely rich flourless chocolate cake just 

 to keep you going.

 Chocolate Decadence

 Butter an eight-inch cake tin, 

 line the bottom with a circle of greaseproof paper, butter 

 the paper and the sides and set aside. Next melt 450g dark 

 chocolate and 150g butter over low heat and mix well together. 

 Set aside and allow to cool slightly. Whisk four eggs and 

 1tbs of sugar until light and fluffy and at least tripled 

 in volume. Slowly fold together the egg and chocolate mixtures. 

 Then scrape the batter into the cake tin and bake in a preheated 

 oven at 180OC for around 15 minutes. Remove and allow to 

 cool fully.

 For the topping, whip 400ml cream, 

 1tbs sugar, and tsp vanilla essence until stiff. Remove 

 the cake from the tin and spread all over the top and sides. 

 Scatter over some chopped chocolate or chocolate shavings 

 and dust with a little cocoa. Return to the refrigerator 

 maybe in another hour and serve. This chocolate cake is 

 very rich so a little goes a long way. You could serve this 

 with a few fresh raspberries to add a little sharpness or 

 maybe a drizzle of almond liquor.

 Cloud on insurance for cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The medical insurance scheme for Calcutta Police employees, that was launched with fanfare last year, is in the doldrums. 

 Some policemen have been misusing the scheme. They are admitting themselves in nursing homes feigning illness. Following complaints by the insurance company, senior officers are planning to increase the monthly insurance premium or scrap the scheme. 

 ?The health insurance scheme was started keeping in mind the healthcare problems of the force. But a section of policemen is faking illness and getting admitted to nursing homes. They are doing this in connivance with doctors and enjoying holidays,? stated joint commissioner of police (administration) Kuldiep Singh.

 The scheme was inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in August 2005. 

 Under the scheme, hospitalisation and surgery cost and other medical expenses up to the sum insured are covered. The spouse, two children and parents of the policy-holder can be protected under the scheme, against an annual premium of Rs 1,200. Cash-less treatment can be availed of in hospitals or nursing homes on the insurance company?s list.

 The misuse of the scheme was brought to light recently by the insurance company. ?It is a matter of concern. The insurance company has asked us to increase the monthly Rs-100 premium. We have to do something to make the scheme work,? another senior officer said. 

 A large number of policemen had protested the introduction of the scheme. They organised a rally inside the Lalbazar police headquarters after Rs 100 was deducted from their salaries. The matter was resolved on police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee?s intervention. 

 Joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfikar Hassan observed that the scheme was initially a success and a large number of policemen had benefited from it 

 An officer pointed out that the modernisation plan of the Calcutta Police Hospital was shelved after the introduction of the scheme. 

 ?The police hospital is in a shambles. It now seems that we have to upgrade its infrastructure before the insurance company withdraws the insurance scheme,? said the officer.

 port trusts maritime museum taking shape

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A huge array of rare documents dating back to the 1870s, throwing up unknown facets of history, a splendid collection of rare photographs, old models of clippers and some carefully-preserved maritime maps all displayed across a sprawling, 15,000-sq-ft space on the Hooghly banks. 

 The first maritime museum of the country, being built by Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) on Strand Road (as reported in Metro on June 21), is on track. At an estimated cost of over Rs 1 crore, this museum, conceived on the lines of the one in London, will have a digital archive containing over 10,000 files with records dating back to the times when maritime trade started in Bengal.

 The CPT has sought the help of the state archives and expertise from the National to set up this museum that will highlight, among other things, the story of the construction of Howrah bridge.

 There is a fascinating history behind the evolution of Calcutta Port and it is so vast and rich that unless it is preserved, the heritage might just get lost. So, we have decided to collect the entire panoply of the port history lying scattered and bring it under one roof, explains Anup Chanda, CPT chairman.

 The CPT authorities are collecting old historical testaments and records scattered all over the place, including those available with the state archives. These include the entries in the visitors diary dating back to 1870 at the small port in Sagar Island, documents containing important decisions on policy matters by the British government and reports of different committees set up from time to time to look into the functioning of the port.

 Besides, efforts are on to put together manuscripts that capture the involvement of some great personalities in maritime trade, including Prince Dwarkanath Tagore.

 We have found tremendous support from the state government in receiving copies of rare documents on the management of the Calcutta Port when the state was in charge between 1870 to 1937. Besides, we have collected rare documents on maritime trade during the reign of the East India Company, says a senior CPT officer. 

 We are also trying to preserve the documents of Emperor Aurangzeb, granting trading rights to the British settlement in eastern India, he adds.

 While a lot remains to be done, CPT officers decided to publicise this project in a newsletter scheduled to come out soon. Ballads of Time, as the newsletter will be called, will contain details of the work done so far.

 Shades: Mithun Chakraborty 

 with son Mimoh

 Mi for Michael Jackson and Moh for Mohammed Ali, are the two stars that add up to make the name Mimoh. Quite a filmi touch for Mithun Chakrabortys eldest son who is all set to join the Bollywood band of star sons.

 My father has always been a great admirer of both these legends who rose from the grassroots, and he decided to name his first born after them, says the 22-year-old whose actual name is Mahakshay, meaning immortal in Sanskrit.

 Back in Calcutta with his entire family after seven long years for the unveiling of a fashion leather accessories store, Mimoh rewinded to some childhood memories in Calcutta, which he would frequent with his father. I love Bengali food and have only been gorging on aloo posto for the past two days, smiled Mimoh.

 A complete entertainer is what he wants to be. As a newcomer my priority is to gain acceptance first. I want to do comedy, action, emotional sequences and my first film Jimmy is a complete package where I get to portray all these different shades, he said.

 Apart from his debut film Jimmy, where he plays the title role of a DJ, Mimoh has The Murderer, to be directed by Raj Sippy years after he directed dad Mithun in Boxer. My father is a multifaceted actor and Im trying to follow in his footsteps but I dont feel pressurised, pointed out Mimoh who has attended classes on acting, direction and scriptwriting at the New York Film Academy. 

 Ive picked up most of my dancing skills from watching him perform. Im comfortable doing the disco, hip-hop and a little bit of Indian style of dancing as well, said the son.

 Although Mimoh rues that his father dismissed his dancing abilities at the first go, Mithun chooses to differ: Mimoh is a much better dancer than me. In fact, these days you can catch me following his fashion fundas. I dont feel the need to instruct him. Im more like his buddy who he can fall back on for help, anytime.

 After an end-2006 release of debut film Jimmy, Mimoh will also appear in Dhanrajs He The Only One, the remake of a Telugu film. 

 The GenX hopeful is not averse to Bengali films either, having quite enjoyed watching MLA Fatakeshto and Abhimanyu. Once I gain recognition in Bollywood Id surely like to try my hand at Bengali films, too. I understand Bengali very well but need to speak the language more, said a reticent Mimoh who dreams of working with Mrinal Sen one day and is looking forward to catch Buddhadeb Dasguptas Kaalpurush.

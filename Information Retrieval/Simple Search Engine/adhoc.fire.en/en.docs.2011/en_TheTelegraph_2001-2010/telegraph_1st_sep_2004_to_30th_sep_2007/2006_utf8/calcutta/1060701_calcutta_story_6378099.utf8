 Design dreams, not clothes

 KIRANS CALL 

 Far from being trivial and frivolous, fashion actually 

 defines who we are and who the world thinks we are, 

 says Kiran Uttam Ghosh

 Its been a years break. As I gear up for yet another fashion week, its time for introspection. Im putting together another collection. Clothes that fit Sophia Lorens opinion that a womans dress should be like a barbed-wire fence: serving its purpose without obstructing the view.

 Why does fashion have such a hold on consumers hearts and wallets? I look around my studio. These are clothes that hardly make any sense to some, but will be carried by beautiful models down the runway, clothes that, hopefully, the A-listers will put their hands together for. The photographers will get their gates, the cameramen their footage and those who pick up the clothes will get a better table the next time they dine out.

 Thats what fashion is about. It defines who we really are, and who the world thinks we are. Yet so many associate fashion with the trivial, frivolous and materialistic. A wrong notion.

 Few realise that all clothes are fashion. They make a statement. Even those who often state that they wear the first thing they reach for are making a fashion statement of sorts. Dressing, as Yves Saint Laurent said succinctly, is a way of life, the external expression of how you feel and who you are.

 I believe a great outfit not only makes me happy but radically revises my sense of who I am. Suddenly, I look into the mirror and feel confident, and the world is filled with new possibilities.

 Im often asked, does the bizarre stuff on the ramps ever sell? Why do designers make them? And then again, why do we want more new clothes? Why are we not satisfied with what we have? Why isnt last years shirt just not good enough anymore? Why is the latest latest in fashion of interest to so many?

 Because these are the people who are aware of the difference between looking good and feeling bad. They know that what they wear is less about what proportion of the anatomy is covered and how, and more about what they feel like while wearing it.

 When a small per cent of those zany designs shown on the ramps trickles through to shops, magazines and newspapers, suddenly our old clothes are just not good enough.

 Look good, feel great

 Fashion is not just about clothes. Those who endorse fashion understand what Coco Chanel meant when she said: Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.

 Or it is a symbol of who we are or hope to be? It is about personality, an entire language that speaks wordless volumes. In these individualistic times, nobody wants to look like cookie-cutter pieces. 

 Some of the misnomers about fashion include a blinkered belief that fashion interests only women. Not true. I know that from the amount of requests from men hoping for better menswear in our city. 

 In fact, history shows us that fashion has primarily been a man thing. Its only for the past 200 years in history that womens fashion has come into its own, and thats also when men have been largely confined to a uniform: the suit. 

 Even I, often dressed most shabbily while moving from printing table to dye area to client meeting with dye stains on my white shirt, sweaty measuring tape hanging around my neckline, realise that a great outfit raises self esteem.

 The other day, I walked into a store in similar mode, looking for fabric for an entire show, only to be told when I asked the price of meterage of fabric: Yeh bahut mehnga hai (This is very expensive).

 As they say, keeping your clothes well pressed keeps you from looking hard-pressed. Im learning how much it matters when were making our way in the world. The deception of appearance is one of the tools one needs in society.

 It just reinforces my many beliefs that include respecting elders and eating a balanced diet, that a great outfit makes you look good and keeps you happy.

 So, the next time Im asked the why and wherefore of my passion for fashion, Ill remind them, I dont design clothes, I design dreams.

 Flag-hoister denied raise

 - Writers man has unfurled Tricolour every day for 28 years

 The Tricolour atop Writers Buildings

 Bengal has come out of its financial mess, judging by the generous grants announced by finance minister Asim Dasgupta in recent months.

 Bengal is still steeped in a financial mess, judging by the decision of Dasguptas department to deny a paltry increment to an employee who has to work, mandatorily, all 365 days a year.

 Meet Dayanidhi Das, 50, who for the past 28 years has been unfurling the Tricolour at Writers Buildings at dawn and bringing it down at dusk. This, in addition to his duty of cleaning the secretariat and keeping its keys.

 The PWD, to which Das is attached, recently pleaded with the finance department for a Rs 50 increment to the Group D employee. But Dasguptas office has turned down the plea. It pointed out that an increment of Rs 20 had been allowed in 2004, when the flag allowance was Rs 30. Another hike so soon was ruled out, said an official.

 The flag duty allowance was Rs 15 till 1982, when it was increased to Rs 30. The next revision came 22 years later, in 2004.

 At 6 am every day, Das climbs to the third-floor terrace and clambers up a 34-ft iron ladder (without railings) to where the flag mast is fitted. He then crawls some 15 ft under four iron crossbars to reach the Tricolour.

 On a stormy evening five years ago, he had broken the little finger of his right hand while trying to prevent the flag from being blown away.

 I dont want this assignment any more. I cant take leave because of this time-barred responsibility. The past week, I got drenched every morning and evening. I am also getting old, rued Das.

 In July, he wrote to his superiors, praying for an increment. The PWD endorsed his plea, but the finance department was not impressed. The PWD, however, has not given up hope. It will write to the finance department again and send a sketch of the building to drive home the perils of Dass work.

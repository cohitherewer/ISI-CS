 Tags to tackle disaster

 A STAFF REPORTER

 From a bar of soap to a Royal Bengal Tiger, books in the library to fishermen out in the high seas, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags can help track all of them.

 A two-day workshop entitled ?Tracking of Objects Anytime Anywhere? got underway at Tollygunge Club on Friday. Organised by research and consulting firm Pervcom Consulting, the workshop was inaugurated by IT minister Debesh Das and had speakers from various software companies and IIM Calcutta.

 ?The workshop offers a basic overview of RFID technology with a glimpse of future trends. The workshop will help participants judge the applicability and effectiveness of RFID systems in different business contexts,? said S.K. Banerjee, managing director of Pervcom Consulting.

 ?Much research and time has been spent in tracking objects. RFID is the most promising technology among them,? said Das. ?Developments in the past 10 years have helped the growth of RFID. These include efforts at a global standardisation, costs of RFID tags and scanners coming down, and IT companies providing the backbone and structure for the technology,? Das said.

 The government is looking at using radio frequency-based technologies in disaster management areas like tracking fishermen and checking flood levels, the minister added. 

 ?We must analyse how this can benefit our country, but must also think about the privacy and security issues,? minister Das said.

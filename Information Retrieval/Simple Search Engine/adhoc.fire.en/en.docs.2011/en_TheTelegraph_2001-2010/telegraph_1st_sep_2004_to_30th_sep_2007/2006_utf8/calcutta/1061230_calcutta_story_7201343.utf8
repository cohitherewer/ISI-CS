The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hrithik the 2006 superhero

 Both Mr A and Krrish feature in the Top Five of our readers choice for Best Actor in the year-end poll

 Hrithik Roshan

 2005 was all Bachchan, from Black to Bluffmaster! 2006 has been all Roshan and Khan. Hrithik with his two nominations for Dhoom: 2 and Krrish has garnered more than 40 per cent of the total votes messaged in by the readers. But it is his Mr A in D: 2 that wins Hrithik the Best Actor honours, with a handful votes more than Aamir. Hrithik for Krrish is not far behind and leaves the fourth-placed Shah Rukh far behind in the race. Reason enough for Roshan Jr to command a market price of close to Rs 12 crore for a film. The man will be seen next in Ashutosh Gowariker rsquo;s magnum opus Jodha Akbar, where he will again be paired opposite Ash. Will the kiss be given a miss because of the 16th century time tag?

 Aamir Khan

 Raking in almost 22 per cent of the votes, Aamir Khan is sandwiched between the two Hrithiks in second spot. As DJ aka Daljit in Rang De Basanti, Aamir struck the right chord with the masses and classes yet again after the disappointing Mangal Pandey. He shared the spotlight with newcomers like Siddharth, Kunal Kohli and Sharman Joshi, and yet stood out. He followed the RDB rage with the successful Fanaa and will appear opposite Kareena Kapoor next year in Mani Ratnam rsquo;s Lajjo 

 Shah Rukh Khan

 He had come third last year for Paheli, but this year despite Don turning out to be a much bigger hit, Shah Rukh Khan finds himself in fourth spot. But he should take heart in the fact that Amitabh Bachchan, whom he is replacing as the KBC host, was ninth in the pecking order for his Sexy Sam in KANK. Om Shanti Om and Chak De India should see SRK move up a couple of notches next year. 

Saif Ali Khan slips one spot too, but his Langa Tyagi in Omkara will be remembered far longer than his Nick in Salaam Namaste. With Eklavya and Ta Ra Rum Pum in the pipeline, Saif can only go up the ladder

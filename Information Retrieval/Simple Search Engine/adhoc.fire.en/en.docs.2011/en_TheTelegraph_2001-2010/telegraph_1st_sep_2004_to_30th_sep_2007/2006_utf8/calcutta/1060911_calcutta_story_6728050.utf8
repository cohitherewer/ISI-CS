 Girl death sparks mob fury

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tension erupted in the Canal Circular Road area of Phoolbagan on Sunday morning after Radha Sharma, 20, was found dead at her maternal uncles house. Neighbours went on the rampage, alleging that she had been murdered by her relatives. A 200-strong mob ransacked the house she lived in.

 Demanding immediate arrest of the deceaseds relatives with whom she lived, the local people did not allow the police to remove the body for over six hours. Later deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) Partha Sarathi Ghosh intervened and assured them that justice would be done.

 According to police, around 9 am, residents of the area got to know that Radha had died at the house of her maternal uncle, Munna Sharma. Radhas parents had died a few years ago and since then, she had been staying with Munna. Neighbours found Radhas body, which bore no mark of external injury, on the floor. 

 Munna, who owns a lathe workshop, could not explain how she died. There must be foul play. We know Munna and his wife used to torture Radha regularly, said Naresh Yadav, a resident of the area. Police had to come to the rescue of the Sharmas.

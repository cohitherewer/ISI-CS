 Interface 2006, the week-long festival that wonderfully encapsulated a diverse variety of art forms, concluded in a triumphant style at Science City on April 22. 

 Jointly organised by Young Indians (Yi), which is a part of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop, the festival aimed at building India as a global brand and ensuring that events like this will be held in future. 

 Sapphire Creations is the embodiment of all that Yi seeks to develop, and was also the face of eastern India in the international festival that saw participants from the US, Canada and Japan.

 The final night?s festivities kicked off with a performance by the French Mezcal Jazz Unit. The group, led by bassist Emmanuel de Gouvello, hails from Montpellier in France. It played music that was fundamentally jazz, but with many fine blends of other styles of music, which included rock, eastern music, and a more traditional American Bebop jazz sound. The group also ventured into abstraction, with myriad percussion variations and some clever use of the baritone saxophone.

 However, the festive mood was disrupted for a few minutes, when an advertisement by one of the sponsors struck a jarring note. 

 But the fun and zeal of the festival were restored when Sapphire Creation Dance company took over the stage with a flourish and in dramatic style. 

 Their music and dance were a reflection of what Sapphire terms ?the meeting of the worlds of traditional dance and jazz?. The production was called Once Upon a Time, with the performance heavily influenced by the natural world. 

 The festival also featured the famous Japanese dancer Shakti, whose performance particularly was par excellence. 

 Sudarshan Chakravorty, founder and director of Sapphire Creations, was elated with the festival?s success. ?We were going through the same phase of tensions and anxieties that everyone has before any festival, especially of this magnitude. But in the end, I think we succeeded in making Interface one of the most exciting festivals of its kind in this part of the country.? 

 He pointed out how such festivals play an important role in nation-building. ?We wanted to finish the festival with a real patriotic zeal, a tribute to India. I am sure every viewer, spectator and even the participants have left with new inspirations and aspirations, and are now more willing than ever to explore new cultural directions.?

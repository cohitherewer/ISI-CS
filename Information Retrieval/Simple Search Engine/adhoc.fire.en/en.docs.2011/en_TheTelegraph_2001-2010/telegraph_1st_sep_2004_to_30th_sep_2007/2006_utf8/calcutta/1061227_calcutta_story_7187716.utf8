 Policing in seven cities

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee will be part of a central committee to suggest measures for improving policing in seven cities, including Calcutta. 

 The committee will go through an action plan and concept paper prepared by the Bureau of Police Research and Development and the home affairs ministry and submit its recommendations in six weeks, said Union home secretary V.K. Duggal. 

 He was speaking after chairing a meeting of the Calcutta Police top brass and police commissioners from other cities, including Mumbai and Chennai, on Tuesday.

 There are several key installations in these cities that constitute the backbone of the countrys economic and development activities. It is necessary to strengthen the policing in these cities to meet the challenges posed by outfits engaged in subversive activities, said the home secretary.

 In keeping with this vision of advanced policing, the Union government has sanctioned Rs 86 crore for the seven cities where the Megacity Project will be implemented.

 We want to see Calcutta ready to take on the challenges that will emerge in the next 10 years. The same holds true for the other six cities. Money is not a constraint. We have, in fact, earmarked Rs 500 crore for the next five years under the Megacity Project. But before that, the format for development should be ready, added Duggal.

 According to the plan prepared by the home affairs ministry, the police departments in the seven cities Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Hyderabad need to share their best practices. 

 The thrust will be on upgrading the police stations and the police headquarters, in addition to the skill and efficiency of the constables.

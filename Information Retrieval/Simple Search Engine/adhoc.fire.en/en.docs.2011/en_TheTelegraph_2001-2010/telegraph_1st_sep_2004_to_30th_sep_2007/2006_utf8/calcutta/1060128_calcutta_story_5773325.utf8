 Realtor killer chased, arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A chase on the night of January 26 ended with the arrest of Pinaki Mitra, supari killer who had murdered Pranab Deb, a small-time realtor and brother-in-law of Party for Democratic Socialism (PDS) supremo Samir Putatunda, a month-and-a-half ago at Baguiati.

 Pinaki, a criminal operating in the Baguiati-Dum Dum-Lake Town belt, who had allegedly thrived under CPM patronage and was once close to state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, had plotted Deb?s killing and supervised its execution.

 An officer of Lake Town police station said: ?Pinaki confessed that Deb?s murder was a fallout of the real estate boom in the Baguiati area and rivalry among promoters.?

 A day after Pinaki?s arrest, minister Chakraborty said at Writers? Buildings: ?I have known him since the 70s. I heard that he used to be a short-tempered person, but have no clear idea about him.? 

 Asked whether he knew him personally, the minister quibbled: ?I cannot say that I do not know him.?

 Deb, elder brother of CPM?s former MLA Anuradha Deb, went missing from a musical soiree in front of his Shyamnagar apartment on November 13. His bare body, bearing multiple injury marks, was found in a dumping ground a km from his home. 

 During the course of investigation, Manoj Guddu and Surajit were arrested in Bhubaneswar on November 25.

 ?The next day, we arrested four others ? Piku Mahato, Manoj Mahapatra, Gadai Das and Aparna, wife of another extortionist, Rajesh. All of them admitted that Pinaki had plotted Deb?s killing,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 The first lead to Pinaki?s whereabouts reached police around noon on January 26. A police team left for Lakshminarayan Mandirtala, in Nimta, off Birati.

 ?After a long chase, we finally managed to intercept him at Green Park, in Lake Town, where he lives,? said one of the officers. 

 Pinaki was produced in Barasat court and remanded to police custody for four days.

 After interrogating Pinaki, police came to know that Deb had been trying to set up a common platform involving local promoters to fight extortionists.

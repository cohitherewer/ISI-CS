 Serial kisser: Emraan Hashmi with Celina Jaitley in Jawani Diwani, and (below) Hrishita Bhatt

 Bo Derek did it in 10. She did it again for Amitabh Bachchan in Boom. Ursula Andress did it in Dr No and Halle Berry followed in her foam-swept footsteps in Die Another Day. Closer home, Neha Dhupia did it in Qayamat and now, it?s time for Celina Jaitley to emerge from the waters in a bikini.

 Come Friday and the former Miss India will take the audiences for ?a youthful joyride? in Jawani Diwani with Emraan Hashmi in tow and Hrishita Bhatt keeping a close eye on the two. 

 ?Celina in a red bikini coming out of the blue waters on to the green island. What more do I say?? laughs director Manish Sharma, who makes his solo debut with Jawani Diwani, having earlier co-directed Muskaan. 

 Having assisted director Raj Kanwar from his college days for films like Deewana and Judaai, Manish knew that he was always going to make movies and it had to be for the youth. ?It may be an entertainer on the surface but what Jawani Diwani does is tell the youth to take life a bit seriously,? he explains.

 So, enter Emraan who wants to make it big as a singer and would do anything to fulfil his dream. ?Emmi was my only choice for the role because he has this shady image about him which is perfect for the film. With him as my leading man, things became very easy,? says Manish.

 And Celina is, of course, the girl Emraan meets on the beaches of Mauritius and falls in love with. ?It is Celina, who takes him on this amazing ride,? the director says. ?My film is not about 17 or 24 kisses... It is an entertainer meant for family viewing. Yes, there are kisses in Jawani Diwani, but there?s only three of them.?

 But isn?t Hrishita Bhatt a part of the film too? ?Yes, she is the girl Emraan is seeing before Celina comes into his life,? Manish says. ?The reason why you don?t get to see Hrishita so much in the promos is because she has a much smaller role compared to the other two actors.?

 Scheduled to hit the halls in December 2005, Jawani Diwani was pushed back for January to beat the rush, but still finds Pooja Bhatt?s Holiday and Aparna Sen?s 15 Park Avenue releasing on the same day. 

 ?My film is an out-and-out romantic comedy,? claims Manish. ?If either of the other two releases would have been a comedy, I would have been really scared. But Holiday is more of a dance film and 15 Park Avenue a serious film in English. So, hopefully all the three films should do well and none of us would eat up each other?s business.?

 Regardless of the fate of Jawani Diwani, Manish is making another film with the movie?s producer N. R. Pachisia. ?It?s another comedy called Jhamela,? says the young film-maker. ?It will have two heroes and four heroines. Of the six, only Emraan has been finalised till date. We plan to shoot the film in New York.?

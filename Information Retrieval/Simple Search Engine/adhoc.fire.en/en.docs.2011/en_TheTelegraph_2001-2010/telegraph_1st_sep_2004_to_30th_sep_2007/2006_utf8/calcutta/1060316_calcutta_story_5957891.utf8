And what better place to launch this than in Calcutta, the mecca of football, said Naveen Misra, unit head, Shoppers Stop. 

 For the ladies

 What: Fashion Fusion.

 Where: Saturday Club.

 When: March 11, 6 pm.

 Take a look: The ladies coffee meet at the club hosted every month took a whole new turn this Saturday with some fashion, a hair styling session and more.

 The fashion show divided into six sequences showcased collections of designer Richa Kanoria, Gita Tiwari, Mayur Saraogi, boutiques 14 Plam and Oxygen, and jewellery boutique Traditions. 

 On display were pretty saris in georgette, crepe and organza, ponchos, kurtis and cocktail dresses.

 Summer colours like ice blue, peachy pink and earthy red ruled the colour palette at the show.

 In jewellery, it was traditional earrings and maangtikas. 

 Precious and semi-precious stones set in ornate patterns were attractive.

 The hair-styling session conducted by Squeeze, the salon at 2/7 Sarat Bose Road, had Brenda, a Keune technician highlighting various aspects of artificial coloured extensions.

 Hair styles for boys and girls were also demonstrated.

 Voiceover: The idea 

 was to address subjects that are of interest to the ladies. 

 The turnout was great and we plan to come up with more such 

 sessions, smiled Renu Roy, convenor of the entertainment 

 committee at the popular Wood Street club.

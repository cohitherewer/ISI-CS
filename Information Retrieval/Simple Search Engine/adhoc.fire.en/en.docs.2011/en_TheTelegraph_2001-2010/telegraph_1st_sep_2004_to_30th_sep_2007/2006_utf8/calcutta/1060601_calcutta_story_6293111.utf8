The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chasing crime on a chopper

 - Calcutta Police sets sights on a helicopter, Scotland Yard-style

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 After motorcycles and bullet-proof vehicles, Calcutta Police has set its sights on a helicopter. 

 The proposal for the city police to take to the skies has been cleared by the state government. If a chopper does join its ranks, Calcutta Police will be the first police force in the country to have a helicopter.

 ?We have a list of things for the next two years and a helicopter figures on it. It will cost around Rs 10-15 crore. Talks are already on,? joint commissioner of police (administration) Kuldiep Singh told Metro. 

 Police will use the helicopter to handle major disasters or terrorist strikes. ?During floods or other natural calamities we will be able to conduct an aerial survey and trace affected areas. We will also be able to monitor relief and rescue operations,? explained Singh.

 In charge of modernising Calcutta Police, he visited London last month to train with Scotland Yard and took a fancy to their use of a helicopter. ?They zero in on criminals fleeing in vehicles on a helicopter. After my return I proposed it at a meeting of senior officers and everyone agreed.? 

 The chopper, Singh said, would be equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and serve as an airborne police control room. ?In case of a terrorist attack we can keep an eye on an area and movements there. We can even keep tabs on political meetings and pass on messages to officers on the roads.? Snipers and rapid fire pistols will also be added to the Calcutta Police arsenal, mainly as a measure against terrorism.

 As part of the megacity scheme, the Centre has been releasing funds to Calcutta Police over the past two years. Every year, the state also contributes 25 per cent of the total grant sanctioned by the Centre. Till May this year, Calcutta Police has received Rs 18 crore from the Centre. The money was spent on bullet-proof vehicles, jackets and helmets, and sophisticated arms.

 ?We will get Rs 22 crore from the Centre. We have to use it within a certain period or return it,? explained Singh.

 Whats new about a celebrity bash in the heart of the Calcutta winter? All you need to do now to host a blast is draw up your guest-list and then turn up at party time. No, were not planning to sabotage your party. Were just introducing you to the brand new concept of Beer and Barbecue bashes being arranged by Australian beer label Fosters.

 From sending out invites to deciding on the menu to choosing a venue, everything is taken care of by Fosters. Ask star couple Arjun and Nilanjana Chakraborty and GoodLife columnist Nondon Bagchi, who hosted the first two afternoon Beer and Barbecue parties of the season.

 When you think of Australia, the things that come to mind are beaches, babes, volleyball, cricket, and, of course, pitchers and pitchers of beer. Barbecues are also very common there, with most houses having a complete set-up in their backyards. We decided to replicate the same kind of concept out here in the city, says Sukanta Banerjee, regional business manager, Fosters India Limited.

 All our bashes will take place outdoors, be it at the poolside or on the lawns where people can laze about under the open sky, he adds.

 Step one: tapping celebrities in town who would love to play host. Ours is a premium brand and we are very clear about the kind of clientele we want to cater to. We are thus getting in touch with city celebs who are known for their love for good lifestyle, explains Banerjee.

 While the leisurely Sunday afternoon party helps the hosts catch up with friends, it helps Fosters promote the brand among those who count. We give the hosts complete freedom to draw up their guest lists and also take into consideration the kind of food they want to treat their guests to. There is absolutely no interference on our part. We stick to what the hosts want, clarifies Banerjee, who has also organised barbecue bashes in Delhi and Mumbai this season. If Vinod Khanna, Jackie Shroff and Prahlad Kakkar were the hottest hosts in Mumbai, it was Suhel Seth who played Fosters fave in Delhi.

 When they first approached me to host a party of this kind, I was a little unsure. But then I decided to go for it and it has been a great experience. The atmosphere was such that everyone around felt at home. I went about looking after guests just the way I would if the bash was happening at my place. Not for once did anyone feel that there was such a big name behind the party, smiles musician and foodie Nondon Bagchi, who hosted the barbecue lunch at The Park Poolside in December.

 Jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty, who hosted the first Fosters afternoon bash of the season on the lawns of the Princeton Club, is all praise for the concept. This is the season to party. With both our birthdays and anniversary around the corner, we were just about planning a party when Fosters approached us. At first we were not very keen as we thought it might not have the personal touch, but then we decided to give it a shot, says Nilanjana. It was so well organised? And it was our party from beginning to end.

 ans are on to rope in celebrities from different walks of life ? films, music, sports and fashion ? for the Fosters forum to reach out to a varied clientele.

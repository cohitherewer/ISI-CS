 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re fair and noble and won?t cheat anyone to get your way. You?re an effortless crowd-puller. Your independence is of utmost importance to you. You?re a wonderful co-worker ? understanding, cooperative and efficient. You know how to look good and live in style. You believe in the present and prefer not to fret about the future. ?

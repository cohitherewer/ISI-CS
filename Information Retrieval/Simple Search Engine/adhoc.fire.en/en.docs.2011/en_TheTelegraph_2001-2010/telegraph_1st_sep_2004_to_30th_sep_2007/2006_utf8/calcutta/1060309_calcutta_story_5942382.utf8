 For a fort feel and fusion flavours

 From films to poetry to paintings and sculptures, tales of love continue to be the creative inspiration behind many an artistic endeavour. But its quite rare for a love story to be the inspiration behind a restaurant. Saffron Fort, an eatery off the EM Bypass that raised its shutters on Tuesday evening, boasts such an inspiration.

 Brainchild of Sanjeeb Gandhi, Saffron Fort recreates the ambience of a monument to love of the 1820s. As the legend goes, Chandra Mohan Roy, the zamindar of Chinsura, lived in Roy Kella and would often invite French army official Stephane Sorbone and his sister Saffrone to lavish get-togethers. Lady Saffrone with a knack for cooking took a great liking to Indian food and Chandra Mohan, a connoisseur of food himself, would satisfy her inquisitiveness on Indian recipes. They soon fell in love and got married and Chandra Mohan renamed Roy Kella as Saffron Fort.

 The structure of the fort has been recreated at the restaurant on the edges of Basanti Highway en route to Kolkata Leather Complex, just behind PC Chandras Green Project.

 What could have been a better influence for a restaurant than a love affair that was born of a passion for food and cooking? Some of the specialities on the menu have been handpicked from the pages of Lady Saffrones cookbook, smiles Sanjeeb. 

 A one-and-half-km stretch of a dimly lit, uneven road from Science City to the restaurant might make you sceptical, but once you reach the destination, the appearance is sure to make an impression. 

 A dining experience away from the hustle and bustle of the city is always refreshing. With the IT Park and the leather complex around, the area has favourable business prospects, observes Sanjeeb, who has dabbled in the catering business for quite sometime now.

 My clientele from the catering days would request for a place where they could enjoy my food everyday. They are the obvious force behind this venture, he adds.

 Fort-like huge brick walls surround the restaurant. Spread over a sprawling 3,000 sq ft, the inside walls are adorned with pentagonal mirrors. Tiny lamps and a waterfall accentuate the regal yesteryear ambience further. As you enter, a statue of Lady Saffrone at her balcony engaged in conversation with Chandra Mohan catches the eye. 

 The majestic aura is carried forward in the interiors as well. The entrance is flanked by statues of two French guards. Painted on the walls are portraits of Lady Saffrone and her brother Stephane. Also illustrated are beautiful landscape paintings that the lady would send Chandra Mohan. 

 The air-conditioners have been enclosed in archaic wooden boxes and the dance floor has a backdrop of a yesteryear courtyard. The tables are laid with sparkling silverware and the chairs flaunt Victorian-look upholstery.

 The food offered is an assortment of Indian and western cuisine. The premises with quite a lot of open space boasts live Mongolian and kebab counters. Chandra Mohans Passion, Stephanes Favourite, Lady Saffrones Choice? the spread on the menu has been interestingly named in sync with the theme. Delicacies include Mille Feulle Of Fish, Chicken Roulade, Dum Aloo Benarasi, Subz Nut Khut and many more. 

 It will take about a month for the footfall to pick up. The theme-based ambience and the quality of food will be the draws, feels Sanjeeb. 

 The eatery is expecting to get a bar license soon and plans to celebrate every festival in style. For Holi, a Chaat and Thandai Evening is on the cards. 

 Adjoining the restaurant is a hall where one can host birthdays, kitty parties and corporate events. You can book the restaurant for occasions too, adds Sanjeeb. 

 There are pick-up facilities from the Science City island with prior booking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 PUTTAR OVER POTTER

 The plexes are plush and the hype is huge. Yet, Calcutta is so bitten by the Bollywood bug that it refuses to queue up for new English releases

 The plexes are plush and the hype 

 is huge. Yet, Calcutta is so bitten by the Bollywood bug 

 that it refuses to queue up for new English releases 

 Julia Roberts pulling up the black 

 stockings in her introductory scene of Pretty Woman. 

 Anthony Hopkins enjoying the notes of Bachs Goldberg 

 Variations in The Silence of the Lambs. Kate 

 Winslets heart-shaped pendant dangling against her heaving 

 bosom in Titanic. There was a time Calcutta would 

 queue up for these images to unfold on the ill-lit big screens 

 of musty movie halls.

 Not anymore.

 Calcuttans have stopped romancing 

 the English movie. They may keep asking Anthony Kaun 

 Hai? but they dont care much about Johnny Depps Cockney 

 accent in Pirates of the Caribbean. They are more 

 intrigued by Aamir Khans Punjabi accent as Daljit (DJ) 

 puttar in Rang De Basanti than by Ron Howards 

 cracking of The Da Vinci Code.

 Whats gone wrong? Why does Calcutta 

 contribute just five to seven per cent of the national gross 

 revenue when cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore account 

 for 30 per cent each? Why has the multiplex boom spelt further 

 doom for Hollywood here when it has opened up the English 

 movie market dramatically in other metros?

 Why does the most successful Hindi 

 movie in the last three years, Rang De Basanti, run 

 for 220 shows more than Harry Potter and the Prisoner 

 of Azkaban the most successful English movie in the 

 same period and draw in more than double viewers at the 

 citys most popular multiplex, INOX (Forum)?

 The answer is indeed blowing in 

 the wind. The multiplex boom in Calcutta has not been an 

 explosion like in Delhi and Mumbai and so the market for 

 English movies is still very small compared to Hindi movies, 

 says Kushagra Jalan who distributes Warner Bros. films apart 

 from Yash Raj movies here. In the other metros, a big English 

 film would release with 30 to 50 prints. In Calcutta, if 

 the number is 10, it is a big thing. The audience base can 

 only increase if the market increases.

 Even when films like King Kong 

 do well in the city, its the dubbed Hindi version because, 

 as Jalan puts it, it may be difficult to follow Biblical 

 references but it is a visual treat when a movie is packed 

 with state-of-the-art special effects.

 Exhibitors like Arijit Dutta blame 

 it on the great language divide. In Calcutta, Hindi movies 

 have completely dominated English films in the past five 

 years... For a city touted as a lover of English films, 

 why would all-India winners like The Da Vinci Code and 

 Pirates of the Caribbean fare comparatively poorly 

 here? Because we may sermonise that we should watch English 

 movies but when it comes to paying for the tickets, all 

 the culture talk goes out of the window.

 Its simple economics, stresses 

 Vikramjit Roy, head of publicity of Sony Pictures India. 

 The Bengalis loved going to Globe or Chaplin a decade back 

 because of the low cost involved. But today, they are intimidated 

 by the multiplexes because of the associated cost factor 

 that involves everything from shopping to eating to even 

 parking cars.

 Echoing Duttas line, Roy elaborates: 

 The box-office collections clearly suggest that the verbal 

 drive of the Bengalis to watch English films has not translated 

 into action... As far as the non-Bengalis in Calcutta go, 

 they would watch their Fanaa and Kabhi Alvida 

 Naa Kehna any given day and not mind the pocket pinch.

 The push factor becomes a pull 

 at Nandan, where comfort is combined with low cost. Da 

 Vinci Code did very well at Nandan. The reason is the 

 affordable ticket rate, the maximum being Rs 50, says Nandan 

 CEO Nilanjan Chattopadhyay.

 The delay in the prints coming 

 to Calcutta also hurts. Says Vikas Syal, general manager 

 of INOX (Forum): Apart from the wide releases, most English 

 films come to India at least a couple of months after their 

 American arrival. And then they take another couple of weeks 

 to come to Calcutta.

 Case in point: Asterix and 

 the Vikings refusing to come to Calcutta shores. When 

 asked why, Jiten Hemdev, director of Star Entertainment, 

 had told Calcutta: See more English films and we will definitely 

 come here first.

 By the time the new releases make 

 their way to the plexes in town, the niche audience has 

 either seen the film on pirated DVDs or rented them from 

 the neighbourhood library, feels Syal, for they do not want 

 to be left out or wait in queue.

 Syals home theatre theory hits 

 bulls eye. The two most popular DVD lending libraries in 

 Calcutta Cinema Paradiso and Raja Electronics agree 

 that the new English movie section is the most sought after. 

 Of the 1,200-odd movies we rent out on an average every 

 month, most are new English films that fly off the shelves 

 the moment we get the original DVDs, reveals a spokesperson 

 for Cinema Paradiso. By the time a Capote or a Crash 

 hits the theatres, most of our members have seen it 

 at home.

 Calcutta, yet again, is picking 

 up the crumbs and starting to play catch up. Yes, the pick-up 

 has been faster in Delhi and Mumbai but we are trying to 

 catch up, says Syal. This year we have had Oscar-nominated 

 films, which are not commercial releases, coming to Calcutta 

 in the same month as in the other metros. Thats a start. 

 Once we have more multiplexes, the market will surely pick 

 up.

 Jalan believes that the studios 

 would make sure that Calcutta doesnt get left out. They 

 are now releasing their movies through local agents who 

 are conversant with the distribution of Hindi and regional 

 films in the area, he says. So there will now be more 

 access to the territory and they will be able to play around 

 with the huge plans they have for the eastern region as 

 a whole.

 Multiplex chains across the country 

 are also doing their bit to promote English movies. They 

 have started segmentation, breaking up films into genres 

 and going in for innovative programming, says Sony spokesperson 

 Roy. English film marketing has become much more in-your-face 

 and perhaps all they need to do is target the niche Calcutta 

 crowd that is staying away from the cinemas. 

 Like most things in Calcutta, 

 time is the main hope. The entertainment industry works 

 in cycles, muses Dutta. There was a time when Calcuttans 

 would queue up to watch an English film; maybe that day 

 will return soon. Amen.

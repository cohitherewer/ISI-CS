 Sipping chai in fields of gold

 Magic mix : Kids

 the launch of a series of four Hindi books for pre-schoolers

 About 15 km from Anand, in Gujarat, 

 is a largish village called Vadod, whose best feature is 

 the railway station. It is the prettiest in my experience, 

 comprising just two platforms elevated some three feet off 

 the ground. On one there are always cows grazing, the other 

 has a spanking clean station master?s office with a ticket 

 counter painted bright blue and wooden chairs inside which 

 are close to 150 years old, but undoubtedly sturdy.

 Not more than six of the slowest passenger trains stop here in a day, each of which is heralded by the loud clanging of a polished brass bell. The two brick signposts at the end of each platform with yellow faces and bold, black lettering spelling Vadod in three languages are in perfect condition and as bright as the ticket counter, simply because there is no one to tarnish them.

 To a bunch of us in college here, this is a strangely magical world. Ours is the world of being fashionably late, or lazy, for every class, lab session, assignment, submission, or even a test. Yet, we have committed ourselves to hitting the road at 6 o?clock every morning to pedal insane distances.

 Though it gets unbearably hot during the day, it?s very pleasant in the morning. The sky is bathed in brilliant shades of pink, purple and blue, and it?s an awesome feeling to have the lively breeze blowing against your face.We cycle along a road laid between hedges of hollyhock and other wild plants. Beyond these are vast stretches of fields, alternating patches of green and brown fenced by chicken wire. I never cease to be amazed by the simplicity of rural life. There is so much beauty and peace.

 As we enter the village, the road is replaced by a dirt track with three inches of sand, which makes cycling a slightly strenuous task. The mud huts, crooked iron gates covered in creepers, and a goat or cow tethered to a post are common features.

 What is most wondrous is that there is a school with a shabby building, and I imagine somewhat unfriendly school teachers, but with a massive playground with the occasional blade of grass. When I think of schools in Calcutta that lack a playground or have a cemented compound to compensate, I can?t help thinking that these children are the privileged ones.

 We do nothing at the Vadod station other than watch trains pass, count the number of carriages or calculate their speed. We arrange stones on the tracks in a line and watch them splinter into fragments when a train runs over them, examine the mechanism by which the tracks change, explore an abandoned outpost, or simply count cows.

 Beyond the station is a tea stall where the tea is brewed over a coal stove and is served out of an aluminium kettle. We brag about being the first customers, ordering a ?cutting? of chai.

 To those of us who are average gadget obsessed college students who don?t know how to appreciate the simple pleasures of life, we find immense joy in coming here every morning and doing nothing constructive. We behave like six-year-olds waving at the trains or balancing ourselves on the tracks.

 Anand is not a very big place. There isn?t much scope to ?hang out? or party at night. There is a dearth of bookstores, libraries, plays, movies or anything that could provide some sort of intellectual stimulation, or even the opportunity to have ?fun?. This is a dry state where alcohol is available only illegally. There are no nightclubs.

 Yet, I?m glad I?m not in a metropolitan city. That despite having to do some eight hours of classes (or at least expected to do so), we don?t lose ourselves to a commercial world. I?m glad that we can breathe, that we get unlimited space to do whatever we want. We are comfortable being our uncool selves. We don?t need a multiplex or a shopping mall to amuse or entertain us. At times like these, I am glad that we lack state-of-the-art urban facilities. I wouldn?t trade places for anything in the world.

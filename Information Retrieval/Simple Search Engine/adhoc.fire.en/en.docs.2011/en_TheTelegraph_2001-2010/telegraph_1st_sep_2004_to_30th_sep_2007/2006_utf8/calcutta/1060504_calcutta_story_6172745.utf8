Life

 Matching steps with his hero 

 Salmans Maine 

 Pyar Kiya patchwork jacket or Hrithiks Kaho Na... see-through 

 vest, the filmi dresser keeps updating his wardrobe with every 

 passing screen fad. Shradha Agarwal explores 

 this style mantra 

 Filmi men live on a staple diet of movies. They are young, restless and well, happening, if you go by todays trends. They love Shah Rukh, adore Hrithik, admire Saif and worship the Big B. Not just as screen gods but also as style icons. 

 Mouthing paisa vasool dialogues is no more the sole way of showing solidarity with the heroes, todays star-struck youth have taken a fashionable step further. 

 GoodLife figures out the filmi mans style statement.

 Who is he?

 Someone young and yuppie, is how Bollywoods favourite designer Manish Malhotra describes the filmi male.

 Picking up intricacies of styling and loads of fashion gyan from his hero, these dressers are showstoppers wherever they go ? in a good sense or a not-so-good sense is up to others to decide.

 They have the power to popularise a one-frame outfit and the skys the limit when their favourite icons sport a signature style or garment in a flick. Remember Salmans stamped leather jacket in Maine Pyar Kiya? 

 The other day, someone wore a tee that was ripped off on the sides to show off a perfect six-pack. That I would define as super filmi, says mens wear designer Snehasish Bhattacharya.

 Reiterating a fashion point, filmi men always manage to attract attention, quite like their screen gods they clone.

 Looking up 

 Shah Rukh Khan

 Abhishek Bachchan 

 Saif Ali Khan

 John Abraham

 Hrithik Roshan 

 Aamir Khan

 Salman Khan

 Must-haves

 Amitabh Bachchans suave 60-year-old look, Govindas vibgyor effect, Hrithiks transparent black vest or Saifs metrosexual look in all his recent films? The filmi man is sure one busy person, updating his wardrobe with each box-office bonanza. 

 Nevertheless, some styles scream filmi like nothing else. Manish lists the essentials, for the contemporary filmi dresser. 

 Boot-cut jeans

 A collection of fitted tees

 Well-tailored blazers and jackets

 Large belts

 Nice accessories like bracelets and wrist chains

 Theme talk 

 These dressers like to emulate their style icons blindly? So it doesnt matter if their wrist is narrow or broad, if their hero is wearing a thick silver chain around his wrist, so will they, observes Snehasish, who did his bit to dress Sanjay Dutt and Saif in Parineeta.

 They favour a wide range of glasses ? both night glasses or loud shades for the day. All their accessories are meant to be attention-grabbers, for better or for worse.

 Another essential characteristic of these men is that their sense of time (of day or year) tends to fail them more often than not. Dont be surprised to catch a filmi guy sporting leather trousers for a Sunday brunch, laughs Snehasish.

 Shop stops 

 These filmi men, as their look suggests, love shopping. Branded or fake labels, customised from their local tailors or street markets. 

 They can be spotted at malls like Sreeram Arcade, Fancy Market, New Market, Vardaan Market and Metro Plaza.

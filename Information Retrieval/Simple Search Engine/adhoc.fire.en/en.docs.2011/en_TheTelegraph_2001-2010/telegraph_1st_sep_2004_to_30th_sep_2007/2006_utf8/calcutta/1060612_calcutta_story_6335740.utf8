The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Second stop 

 After the success of its first salon on Wood Street, Eyecatchers opened its second outlet on Friday at 59, Ballygunge Circular Road, next to Mama Mia and Cafe Coffee Day.

 The client list of Eyecatchers boasts a host of Pakistani cricket stars, with its first outlet having been inaugurated by Shahid Afridi in 2004. 

 The swank 1,000 sq ft new salon boasts wooden flooring and the interiors have been done up in white to maintain complete cleanliness.

 Youngsters in Calcutta are becoming increasingly cautious about the salons they visit. There is a definite need for lifestyle salons in the city, feels owner Srivardhan Daga. 

 Football fever being the flavour of the month, we have come up with cuts replicating the hair styles of football stars. The bold Calcutta youth is going in for the hairstyle of his World Cup soccer icon. David Beckhams style is an eternal hit, says Sheikh Aminuddin Haidar, unisex hairstylist at Eyecatchers.

 We have more than 40 clients at our Wood Street salon every day and the number goes up during festivals and other special occasions, reveals Daga. So the last appointment at the Ballygunge Circular Road outlet will be allowed as late as 9 pm.

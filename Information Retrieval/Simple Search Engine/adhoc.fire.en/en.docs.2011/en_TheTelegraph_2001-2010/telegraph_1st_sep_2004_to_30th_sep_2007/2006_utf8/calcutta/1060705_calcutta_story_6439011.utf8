 Oliver Stone?s new film World Trade 

 Center seeks truth in the rubble

 Berenger at the 20th anniversary of Platoon

 Inside a flimsy temporary office 

 on a dusty movie lot, a young man sits in front of a computer, 

 showing off a three-dimensional rendering of the collapse 

 of the World Trade Center. It was assembled by merging the 

 blueprints for the twin towers ? the before-picture, you 

 might say ? with a vast collection of measurements, including 

 some taken with infrared laser scans from an airplane 5,000 

 feet above Lower Manhattan, just days after 9/11.

 With a few clicks, Ron Frankel, 

 who is the title pre-visualisation supervisor for Oliver 

 Stone?s new 9/11 film, begins to illustrate the circuitous 

 path that five Port Authority police officers took into 

 the trade center?s subterranean concourse, until the towers 

 above them fell, killing all but two ? Will Jimeno and Sgt. 

 John McLoughlin.

 Only a movie budgeted as mass 

 entertainment, though, could harness costly information 

 to reconstruct the point of view of two severely injured 

 and bewildered men, who didn?t even know the twin towers 

 had been flattened until rescuers lifted them to the surface 

 many hours later.

 Their story, and those of their 

 families, their rescuers and the three men killed alongside 

 them, is the subject of Stone?s World Trade Center, 

 which Paramount plans to release (in the US) on August 9.

 Nicolas Cage, who plays the taciturn 

 Sergeant McLoughlin, says the movie is not meant to entertain. 

 ?I see it as storytelling which depicts history,? he says. 

 ?This is what happened. Look at it. ?Yeah, I remember that.? 

 Generation after generation goes by, they?ll have United 

 93, World Trade Center, to recall that history.?

 Whether Stone set out to make 

 a historical drama or a dramatic history isn?t entirely 

 clear. There are many people who have been driven crazy 

 by some of Stone?s more controversial films, JFK, 

 Natural Born Killers and Nixon chief among 

 them. But in several interviews, sounding variously weary, 

 wounded and either self-deprecating or defensive, Stone 

 spoke as if his days of deliberate provocation were behind 

 him. 

 ?I stopped,? he says simply. ?I 

 stopped.?

 His new film, he says, just might 

 go over as well in Kansas as in Boston, or, for that matter, 

 in Paris or Madrid. ?This is not a political film,? he insists. 

 ?Why can?t I stay on message for once in a while? Why do 

 I have to take detours all the time??

 He said he just wants to depict 

 the plain facts of what happened on September 11. ?It seems 

 to me that the event was mythologised by both political 

 sides, into something that they used for political gain,? 

 he says. ?And I think one of the benefits of this movie 

 is that it reminds us of what actually happened that day, 

 in a very realistic sense.?

 ?We show people being killed, 

 and we show people who are not killed, and the fine line 

 that divides them,? he continues. ?How many men saved those 

 two lives? Hundreds. These guys went into that twisted mass, 

 and it very clearly could?ve fallen down on them, and struggled 

 all night for hours to get them out.?

 By contrast Paul Haggis (Crash 

 director) is directing the adaptation of Richard Clarke?s 

 book on the causes of 9/11, Against All Enemies, 

 for producer John Calley and Columbia Pictures. Asked if 

 that weren?t the kind of film he might once have tried to 

 tackle, Stone first scoffs: ?I couldn?t do it. I?d be burned 

 alive.? 

 Stone says he particularly owes 

 his producers for taking a chance on him at a time when 

 he had gone cold in Hollywood after a string of commercial 

 and critical disappointments culminating in the epic Alexander 

 in 2004. ?They believed in me at a time when other people 

 did not, frankly,? he says. ?Alexander was cold-turkeyed 

 in this town, I think unfairly, but it was, and I took a 

 hit. Nobody?s your friend, nobody wants to talk to you.?

 Stone came forward asking to direct 

 World Trade Center just about a year ago. He decided 

 it would require a different approach from, say, JFK. 

 The Kennedy assassination was 40 years ago, and look at 

 the heat there, a tremendous amount of heat,? he says.

 ?I was trying to do my best to 

 give an alternative version of what I thought might have 

 happened, but it wasn?t understood. It was taken very literally. 

 Platoon, I went back to a Vietnam that I saw quite 

 literally, but it was a twisted time in our history. This 

 ? this is a fresh wound, and it had to be cauterised in 

 a certain way. This is a very specific story. The details 

 are the details are the details.?

 Jimeno and John McLoughlin in World Trade Center

 Reality can be as gushingly sentimental 

 as the sappiest movie, Stone acknowledges, especially when 

 the storytellers are uniformed officers in New York who 

 lived through 9/11. And particularly when it comes to Jimeno 

 and McLoughlin, who have struggled with the awkwardness 

 of being singled out as heroes when so many others died 

 similarly doing their duty, and when so many more rescued 

 them. 

 ?You could argue the guys don?t 

 do much, they get pinned, so what,? Stone says. ?There will 

 be those type of people. I say there is heroism. Here you 

 see this image of these poor men approaching the tower, 

 with no equipment, just their bodies, and they don?t know 

 what the hell they?re doing, and they?re going up into this 

 inferno, they?re like babies. You feel saddened, you feel 

 sorry for them. They don?t have a chance.? 

 Cage says he once mentioned to 

 Stone that their audience had lived through 9/11: ?That 

 it?s not like Platoon, where most of us don?t know 

 what it?s like to be in the jungle.? ?He said, ?Well what?s 

 your point??? Cage says. ?And my point is that we all walk 

 into buildings every day, and we were there, and we saw 

 it on TV, so this is going to be very cathartic and a little 

 bit hard for people.?

 ?It?s not about the World Trade 

 Center, really. It?s about any man or woman faced with the 

 end of their lives, and how they survive,? Stone says. ?I 

 did it for a reason. I did it because emotionally it hit 

 me. I loved the simplicity and modesty of this movie.?

 ?I hope the movie does well,? 

 he adds, ?even if they say ?in spite of Oliver Stone?.?

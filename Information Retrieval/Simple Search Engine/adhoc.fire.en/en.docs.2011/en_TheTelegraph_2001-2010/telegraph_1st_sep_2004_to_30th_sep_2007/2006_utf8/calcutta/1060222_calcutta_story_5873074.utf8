 - TO EXPERIENCE, EXPLORE GOOD MUSIC

 ?We have about 800 students on our rolls, of whom the majority are young people, but think how many more you will find hanging around malls and discotheques and what music do they hear? Kajra re?!? asked an exasperated Deepika Jaidka, administrator of The Calcutta School of Music. 

 ?We host so many beautiful sessions of classical music and they are free, but the crowd that packs Sandre Hall is hardly young. I think most youngsters are not even aware of what good music is,? continued Jaidka. 

 In a bid to correct the situation, The Calcutta School of Music and British Council are hosting a three-day workshop on ?Transforming Musical Leadership? at Sandre Hall from February 21 to 23 (10am to 1 pm). The workshop, being conducted by Sean Gregory of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, UK, has drawn a sizeable response. 

 The selected team of 30 participants include teachers, music students and musicians, some hailing from Darjeeling.

 Gregory, a performer, composer and creative producer in his own right, says that Guildhall?s Connect programme in east London aims at ?putting more instruments in the hands of young people?. 

 Connect has, for over a decade, been reaching out to children from different backgrounds and learning levels. Motivated students keep returning for the informal training workshops (held over weekends and on school holidays) and move on to music careers. 

 Musical notations and classes are not a part of Connect. Students are encouraged to experience and explore music, they form ensembles learning not only how to play instruments but also to compose music and lead groups. 

 Anyone below age 18 can join and bring whatever musical instrument he or she can play, even if it is something non-European like the tabla or sitar. If nothing else, Guildhall seems to have succeeded in some measure to convince the young that ?music doesn?t only come from iPods?.

 Today, numerous other organisations are also working towards widening the parameters of music education in the UK. Apart from the new, government-funded Youth Music, revered institutions like the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London Symphony and Royal College of Music are opening up. Music has been made compulsory in schools and more government funds are available. Western Classical music is no longer seen as the top of a pyramid, with all other kinds of music below it, said Gregory.

 A similar venture would not be out of place in India, agreed many teachers and musicians of Calcutta. ?Music must be taken to schools and colleges in a big way. Parents must be made to understand the musical needs of a child,? said Abraham Majumdar, director, Sangeet Research Academy. Perhaps they may be convinced if music is not only made compulsory, but also something that brings grades.

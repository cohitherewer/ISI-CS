 Irfan 

 Ahmed 

 Age: 36

 At it since: 1989

 Find him: By appointment

 Starting point: 

 I was into machine mechanics and soon realised that 

 was not where my heart lies. So I joined Taj Bengal as a 

 food and beverage executive. The general manager and F amp;B 

 manager spotted talent in me and sent me to Taj Mahal, Mumbai, 

 for a six-month training period. During the training it 

 dawned on me that this was something that I wanted to do.

 apricot brandy sprinkled with cinnamon powder, topped with 

 double cream. Add a dash of Baileys Irish Cream and finally 

 garnish with grated chocolate for the complete effect.

 Craziest concoction: Suicide. Inspired by the several courses that a classic French meal comprises, it has seven glasses balanced one on top of the other. The first contains wine, the second any form of spirit like vodka, the third whisky followed by brandy and other liquor.

 Celebs served: Russi Mody, Shabana Azmi, Soumitra Chatterjee, Konkona Sen Sharma, Ravi Shastri and more.

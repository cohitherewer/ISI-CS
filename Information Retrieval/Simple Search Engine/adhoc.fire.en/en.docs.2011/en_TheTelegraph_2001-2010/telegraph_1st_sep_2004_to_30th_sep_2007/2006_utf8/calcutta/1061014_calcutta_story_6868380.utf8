The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 NGO agent in fraud net

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested an employee of a city-based NGO late on Thursday on charges of misappropriating 200,000 euros, roughly Rs 1.2 crore.

 Shaukat Ali, in his mid-30s, was arrested in a south Calcutta hideout on the basis of a complaint by a German national who had made the donation to the NGO for a child welfare project. D.P. Tarania, inspector-general (II) of CID, said the complainant was shocked to see that his funds had been withdrawn but not used for any welfare programme.

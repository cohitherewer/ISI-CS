 The waterbody opposite Sanjha Chulha, between Science City and Ruby Hospital, has been restored, though not fully. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has accused the eatery at 88, Uttar Panchanna Gram of illegally filling up a waterbody across the EM Bypass.

 The restaurant is reportedly planning another outlet in a building there, the approach to which is blocked by the patch of water. Last Friday was the CMC deadline for the eatery to restore the ditch.

 ?We saw people from Sanjha Chulha supervising the restoration of the ditch on Friday. But it has not been levelled properly. They have also not filled up the waterbody with adequate water,? said a local resident.

 Peeved at the slow rate of restoration, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has directed chief municipal architect and town planner Anidya Karforma to take photographs of the waterbody on a daily basis. ?The owners of Sanjha Chulha must restore the waterbody immediately or face bigger losses,? Bandyopadhyay warned on Monday.

 When Metro had spoken to the owners of the restaurant last week, they had given two completely different versions. One of the partners, Asif Ahmed, dissociated Sanjha Chulha from both the property across the road and the landfill.

 The other partner, Md Aminuddin, admitted that Sanjha Chulha owned the property in question but claimed the waterbody had been filled up by ?some local residents?.

 Meanwhile, director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol on Monday submitted his report on the illegal constructions detected in the two buildings of the eatery on either side of the Bypass.

 Five cottahs of land had been reclaimed by the owners of the 88, Uttar Panchanna Gram restaurant by filling up part of the waterbody lying between the building and the EM Bypass. ?I think they have filled the waterbody with an intention to create a direct means of access to the proposed eatery,? said Mondal.

 A staircase has also been found in the building housing the existing Sanjha Chulha address on the eastern side of the Bypass. This apparently involves ?amalgamating the two buildings illegally?.

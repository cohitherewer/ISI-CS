 Move over French manicure and 

 patterned nail varnish. Theres a lot more happening 

 on the nail block. From nail tattoos to extensions to computerised 

 instant motifs, this segment of the beauty scene is happening 

 like never before.

 Nails create much more of an impression than we think they do. They reflect your taste, temperament and style. Internationally, they innovate with nail fashion like they do with clothes. It was high time that we geared up and the results have been encouraging, says beautician Darshini Sanghvi, co-owner of Tress Talk at 4A, Allenby Road.

 Fix em up

 From acrylic to gel to the quick-fix ones, concealing nail flaws has never been easier than with these artificial nail forms. Not just hiding bad nails, these artificial ones can give the hand a complete makeover with the perfect nail size and shape for special occasions, smiles beautician Bridgette Jones.

 A range of artificial nail extensions from VNS Marketing was launched at Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon on Sarat Bose Road last week. Made in China, these quick-fix extensions come in three different colours to suit the skin tone ? pink, yellow and pearly white. 

 These come in boxes of 24 nails in different sizes, costing Rs 299 per box. One set lasts a maximum of two weeks and its advisable to get the first setting done by an expert.

 For this, the nails are painted with special nail glue and then the false nails are fixed, covering the real ones perfectly. A French manicure appeal eliminates the need for nail polish. 

 They look natural, are easy to maintain and are odourless during application, points out Bridgette.

 For removing the nails, the fingertips have to be placed in a bowl of acetone and after the nails dissolve, application of vegetable oil ensures moisturisation of the skin and nails. A manicure leaves the real nails in prime condition.

 A popular pick at June Tomkyns on Ballygunge Circular Road is the gel variety of extensions. This promises nail enhancement, protection of brittle nails and an overall fashionable look for your hands. From models to actresses to corporate professionals to homemakers, they all love the gel sessions for the natural look and long-lasting advantages, says Sharon Rodricks from June Tomkyns.

 A nail specialist determines the suitability of the length, keeping in mind your daily routine. After the initial cleaning and buffing, a primer is applied that protects the original nail. This is followed by fixing the semi-hard artificial nails with the help of a mild gum. Then the nails are cut, shaped and filed. A gel is applied after this and the fingers are placed under the UV filter machine. Application of white gel at the tips and pink gel on the base gives a French manicure effect. Follow it up with a refill session as and when required.

 A gel nail session for both hands comes for Rs 1,400 at June Tomkyns.

 The third variety of artificial nails is the acrylic one. At Tress Talk, imported acrylic nails from Bangkok are fixed with eco-friendly glue that allows the natural nail to breathe. Filing and buffing ensure a natural look. Nail varnish application makes for the complete effect.

 Acrylic nails stay for six to seven days and as Darshini says, is apt for weddings and holidays. Once the nails are off your hands, Darshini advises application of hot olive oil. It is also advisable not to put polish for the next one-and-a-half days.

 An acrylic nail session at Tress Talk costs Rs 250.

 While you revel in the beauty of your brand new nails, after care is important to maintain the look, insists Bridgette.

 She draws up a do and dont list to keep them nice and safe:

 Use rubber gloves when 

 cleaning or washing.

 Do not use the fingernail 

 as a tool.

 Keep away from acetone 

 that softens artificial nails.

 Caution should be exercised 

 when near any naked flame, including cigarettes, as nail 

 adhesives are inflammable and plastic nails can melt.

 Arty appeal

 After the basic look is taken care of, its time for the add-on appeal. Piercing, painting, surface embellishment and every other form of nail decoration is happening for quite some time now and most salons across the city will help you flaunt them to the fullest.

 From sober designs in soft colours to jazzy illustrations in electric hues, the range is varied. Nautical prints, dice illustrations, nature paints, you name it and its on your nails.

 For the corporate crowd, a French manicure with a small flower at the transparent base and a touch of transparent shimmer does the trick. It looks simple and smart, says Darshini. 

 For an extended wedding celebration, matching nail varnish with every apparel might not be an easy task. So, Darshini suggests multicoloured flowers on a white base. The adventurous partygoer can get her nail pierced at a salon and flaunt small dangling baubles in cute little shapes. Crystals, sequins and silver, gold and bronze glitter are the other embellishments. 

 Tech tale

 Creative manual nail art now has competition from computers. A few clicks on the mouse and you have the whole world of colours and designs painted on your fingernails.

 Available at the Nik Nish outlet in Forum, the digital nail art painter has been imported from Korea. This allows you to customise a design for yourself, takes just a few minutes and is pocket friendly. Reasons that make the computerised nail art corner at our store a popular haunt for the young and not-so-young, says Vinita Francis, the nail art expert at Nik Nish. Occasionally you have men trying it too, she smiles. 

 From flowery to funky, from landscapes to cartoons, you can choose from the catalogue of 2,000 designs and some illustrations that have been downloaded.

 Barbie faces, fruity patterns and smiley faces are popular with tiny tots, while scary masks score high with men. Movie buffs can choose from Bollywood babe Aishwarya Rai and Hollywood hottie Angelina Jolie. 

 For your own face to be flashed on your nail, all you need to do is bring along a scanned personal snap.

 The base can be transparent, white or colours that match your attire. While for white and other colours the base is formed by a coat of nail varnish followed by the application of gum, for the transparent base just the gum is applied. Once the gum dries, the fingers are placed on the stand. A click of the mouse and you have flowers, hearts, butterflies, waves and more printed pretty and neat. 

 Following this up with transparent varnish is a must. This locks the print that lasts almost a month. An application of transparent varnish once every two or three days ensures the nail art remains intact.

 The price tag reads Rs 75 per hand. You can book the machine and a specialist for parties too.

 Shakir Nawaz has topped his school with 75 per cent marks in ICSE 2006. If you think this is a poor reflection on Shakir and his school, think again.

 For the shy, lean boy lives in a dingy lane off Alimuddin Street, where he studies solely by candlelight ever since his father, the family?s sole bread-earner, lost his job a year ago. And his school, Calcutta Emmanuel, is the only ICSE institution offering free education to the underprivileged.

 ?It was difficult studying by candlelight, but there was no alternative (the electricity connection was snapped a year ago, as the bill could not be paid). I am happy that the apparent adversities did not lessen my determination? I expected better marks,? said Shakir.

 The spirited youngster is one among eight bravehearts ? the first ICSE batch of The Calcutta Emmanuel School, in Jadavpur. Founded by V. Pavamani and wife Premila, the school is on a rare education mission.

 All for students like Reena Prasad, Sudipto Sarkar, Ashim Das and Rahul Bhowmik.

 What Reena calls home is a small flour-mill shop in Jadavpur that her mother runs. She lives there with her mother and four siblings. ?I studied for my ICSE in the shop. At times, I could not concentrate because there would be so many people around. But I am happy that my hard work has finally paid off,? said Reena, who scored 57 per cent marks.

 Ashim, who was picked up by an NGO from Sealdah station, wants to study commerce, having got 55 per cent marks. Classmate Rahul, son of a mason, cannot dream of having a computer at home. But he scored 65 per cent marks and is the school topper in computers. 

 Sudipto?s father is a cancer patient. Whatever little money the family earns is spent on his treatment. But that didn?t stop Sudipto from scoring 61 per cent.

 At The Calcutta Emmanuel School, marks and merit matter less than holding out the hope of a better future.

 ?These students are extremely helpless,? said principal Jhelum Reza. ?Most students are from uneducated families and some lost their parents at a very early age. We had to arrange extra classes for them. Our library, laboratories and the computer room are always open for the students. Besides, teachers are always there to help them.?

 The school with a playground near the Jadavpur telephone exchange is constantly being upgraded, with computer laboratories being added late last year. But what worries the students the most is that the school does not have a Plus II section yet. The class of ?06 is not sure it can study further, as most ISC schools in the city charge high tuition fees.

 ?Our school will have a Plus II section within two years? Hopefully, some sponsorships will work out before that and the students will not have to drop out,? said the principal.

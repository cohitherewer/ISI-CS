 Fun for funds

 What: Thai Tonite, organised by the Punjabi Ladies Cultural Organisation.

 Where: Rotary Sadan.

 When: Sunday evening.

 The event: The annual fund-raiser of the Punjabi Ladies Cultural Organisation started with a fashion show that saw daughters and daughters-in-law ? former beauty queen Jyoti Brahmin among them ? of the members walking the ramp. They paraded saris, lehngas and Indo-westerns to the tunes of Right here right now, Kaisi paheli zindagani and Gur nal ishq mitha... Games and lucky draws followed soon after. 

 What the event lacked was anything to do with the title ? Thai Tonite. From the music to the food and the ambience, there was nothing Thai about the whole affair!

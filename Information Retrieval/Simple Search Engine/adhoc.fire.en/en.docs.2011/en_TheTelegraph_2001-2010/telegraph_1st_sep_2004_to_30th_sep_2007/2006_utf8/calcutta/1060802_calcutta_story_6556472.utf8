The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fresh funds offer for LRT

 - Anil Ambani team to place proposal after visit next week 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Infrastructure finance company SREI has made a formal offer to the state government to implement the Rs 2,400-crore Light Rail Transit project on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and finance secretary Samar Ghosh met SREI representatives at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to discuss the offer.

 We talked at length about the project. Siemens of Germany will provide the technology, while SREI will supply the funds and be responsible for the operations. It is a good offer and we are examining it, Deb said after the meeting.

 Managing director of SREI Hemant Kanoria said the government had chosen Siemens technology for the project.

 Anil Ambani, who had verbally expressed willingness to the chief minister to fund the LRT project, is expected to send a team to Calcutta next week.

 Anil Ambanis company has tied up with French firm TGV and wants to take up the project. So far, the company has not made any formal offer, so we do not know the financial implications, pointed out the chief secretary.

 He added that the selection would be made after the Ambanis make the offer.

 With new entrants in the fray, the government will have to modify its earlier tender through which Siemens and Amex had been shortlisted, said transport department officials. They did not foresee any problems in the process, as none of the companies that had responded to the earlier tender had agreed to take up the project on a BOT basis, which was the primary condition.

 Last week, representatives of Konkan-Essar, a joint venture of Konkan Railways and Essar Construction, met government officials and offered to introduce a sky bus in the city. Konkan Railways has introduced the sky bus in Goa.

 The transport department is not in favour of introducing the sky bus in Calcutta. According to the engineers, this mode of transport is not suitable for a congested city. The fare, too, will be on the higher side (Rs 4 per km).

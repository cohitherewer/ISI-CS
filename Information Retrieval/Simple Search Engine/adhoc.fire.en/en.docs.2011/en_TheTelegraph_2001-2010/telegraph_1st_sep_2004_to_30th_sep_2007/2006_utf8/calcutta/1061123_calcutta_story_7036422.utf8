 Shirin Ebadi, Nobel laureate, has two dress codes. One in Iran and another abroad. 

 Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace prize in 2003, the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to do so, is in town for two days. Arriving on Monday from New Delhi, she visited the NGO Apne Aap Women Worldwide that works in the red light district of Kidderpore. The NGO is hosting her visit to the country.

 It is difficult to imagine the robust and brisk Ebadi, lawyer and human rights activist, who overcame clerics and hardliners to effect changes in the law of her country, who looks at home in her short Indian kurta and loose pants, wears her silvery hair short and speaks animatedly on every issue, with her head covered by a hijab. But she does that at home. 

 I wear the hijab in Iran because there, its mandatory. But outside the country, I dont wear it. Some people object to it, but many people admire me for it, says the 59-year-old Ebadi, who speaks in Persian and is accompanied by an interpreter.

 Some European countries like France and Germany have forced the women to take off the hijab. Some Islamic countries have forced it on its women. Why dont we let the women decide? she asks. 

 She is equally forthright on Iran and its nuclear agenda. No country needs nuclear weapons. Not Hindustan, not Pakistan, not America, not Iran, she said. But the US has double standards. It remains close to Pakistan, which has atomic power, she said. 

 She told the women, several of whom were trafficked and taken to red-light areas, and their children, how she started work on child rights. 

 She took up the case of a divorced mother who had lost her nine-year-old daughter. The girl was tortured to death by her father and his new wife. I told the court what happened was sad, that such things should not happen again. The law was amended to give a mother custody of a child up to 10 years old in case of a divorce. 

 Ebadi said Saddam Husseins trial should have been held long before when the Western powers were selling sophisticated weapons to Iraq to attack Iran and the Kurds. 

 She held out hope. You can be anything you want. But its up to you to make a beginning, she told her audience. 

 For some in the audience, meeting a Nobel laureate from abroad was overwhelming. A woman, ready with a speech, broke down. A mother-daughter duo was to act in a skit on the evils of alcohol, but it ended abruptly with the two forgetting their lines.

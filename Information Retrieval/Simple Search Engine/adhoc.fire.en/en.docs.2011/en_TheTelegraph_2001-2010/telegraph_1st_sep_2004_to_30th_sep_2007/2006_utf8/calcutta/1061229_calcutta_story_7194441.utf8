 Flap over Part I flop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A dismal performance in the Part I (undergraduate) exams of Calcutta University (CU) under the new 1+1+1 system has prompted the authorities to undertake an appraisal of the teaching technique followed by its affiliated colleges.

 More than 40 per cent of the 83,288 examinees in BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I the results were declared on Thursday have not been able to clear all five subjects.

 The highest number of failures is in mathematics around 31 per cent of the students with maths as an elective subject have failed to score the minimum qualifying marks of 23 out of 100. 

 The trend is alarming. We are extremely disappointed with the results, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 Its strange that so many examinees have failed to score the qualifying marks. We must find out whether the colleges are maintaining proper teaching standards, he added.

 The subjects other than mathematics in which the percentage of failure is high are physics, chemistry, computer science, botany, economics, microbiology, Hindi, Bengali, geology, philosophy and political science.

 The university had replaced the 2+1 pattern with 1+1+1 last year to improve the standard of its undergraduate education system.

 A preliminary analysis of the results revealed that one reason for the large number of failures this year is the rule that a student under the 1+1+1 system has to score at least 23 in each of the papers.

 In the 2+1 pattern, a student was required to study three papers, of 100 marks each, in an elective subject and score at least 90 out of 300 to clear that subject. Marks in individual papers did not count.

 The present system is better, as it leaves no scope for selective study. But we are worried to note that so many students have failed to score even the qualifying marks, pro vice-chancellor Das said.

 However, students who have failed to secure the qualifying marks in two subjects will be able to appear for the Part II test next year. 

 They will have to simultaneously clear the subjects in which they have failed in the Part 1 exams.

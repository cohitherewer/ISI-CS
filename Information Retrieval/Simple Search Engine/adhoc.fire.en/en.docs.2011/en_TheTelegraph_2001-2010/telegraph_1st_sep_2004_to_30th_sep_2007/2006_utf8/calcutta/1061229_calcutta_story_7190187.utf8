 City tops in dengue cases, says report

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Giving a lie to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas claim that anti-dengue measures in the city are the best in the country, a state health department report has stated that occurrence of the disease in Calcutta is maximum, compared with all districts in Bengal.

 According to the civic health department, only 50 people have suffered from dengue in 2006. But the government report has put the figure at 571, which is 53.7 per cent of the 1,062 people found to have been infected with dengue across the state.

 The list, released on Tuesday, was compiled with figures collected from January 1 to December 26.

 Last year, 3,234 people had suffered from dengue in Calcutta and 12 had died. This year, there has been one death. Two dengue deaths have been reported from Howrah. 

 Mayoral council member (health) Subodh De argued that the civic body had not understated dengue cases. 

 Since the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) does not have facilities to detect the dengue-causing virus, it has to depend on the state health department for the report. Unfortunately, the department has never been regular in updating us on the number of people contracting the disease. What we call the latest report is actually two-three months old, he added.

 The government report shows that dengue has been prevalent in Calcutta and its suburbs in North and South 24-Parganas. Among the most dengue-prone localities in the city are Dhakuria, Tollygunge, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Golf Green, Lake Gardens and some pockets on the eastern fringes, where big construction projects are on.

 Chief medical officer of health in the CMC D.D. Chattopadhyay said that since both malaria and dengue are mosquito-borne diseases, these can be controlled if the mosquito population can be kept under check. The only way to eradicate the diseases is to eradicate the breeding grounds of the mosquito at the micro level.

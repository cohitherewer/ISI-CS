 What: 

 Design 06, graduating show of the 2002-06 Fashion 

 and Information Technology (FIT) batch of National Institute 

 of Fashion Technology (NIFT).

 Where: Pala, at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: Tuesday evening.

 Take a look: Combining creative designing with IT application is the forte of the FIT department, launched by NIFT Calcutta back in 2000. On Tuesday evening, months of toil and tension culminated in a two-and-a-half-hour gala showcasing the designs of 22 students from the department. 

 Minimal drama and skin show and more of wearable fashion marked the collections. The display was part of a project that the students undertook under the mentorship of designers Rohit Gandhi, Rahul Khanna, Anamika Khanna, Rina Dhaka and other big names.

 The elite English ladies, the emotions of an abandoned lover, the ridiculed eunuch community, the operas, the new club culture? The inspirations were vast and varied. And so were the titles of the lines ? Jolie Madame, Ebony amp; Ivory, Harmony In Contrast, Third Gender, La Belle Epoque and more.

 Long jackets teamed with pinafores, short dresses combined with shrugs, flowy skirts teamed with chic bodices, churi pants, A-line lehngas with sensuous slits ? the collection was an assortment of western and ethnic sensibilities.

 The fabric story revolved around raw silk, cottons, chiffons, georgettes, denims, corduroys, nets and leather. Neat cuts and smart necklines were the order of the day.

 A lot of innovation was seen with the hemline in the form of asymmetry, balloon or bubble, laces, pleats, frills and shell extensions. There was generous use of embellishment with patchwork, sequins, beads and intricate embroidery.

 The colour palette was ruled by cool shades of lilac, sea green, onion pink, moss green, ash, blue and so on. Also seen were lots of blacks and whites.

 The creations were judged by a panel comprising designers Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Minakshi Dadoo, Sunipa Samadder, garment exporter Nandita Therwani, S. Duggar, managing director of Fifth Dimension, and NIFT faculty members.

 The Most Creative Collection prize was bagged by Prayrana Kumari for her line Contradictions Of The Cause. The Best Diploma Project was won by Harjosh Singh Goraya, who also went on to win the Turtle Best Diploma Project award for his collection The Cult With No Name. Adrita Sarkar walked away with the Best Academic Performance award for Lemon N Ice. 

 The Moustache Best Visual Merchandising Project category crowned Mersha Aftab as the winner.

 The Jayashree Textiles Best Surface Ornamentation Techniques prize went to Anil Minocha for his collection I Love You, Ill Kill You. Vandana Jadwani topped the Belong Best Texture Development category with Natura Metamorphose. The Belong Best Styling in a Collection award was won by Puneet Chauhan for Vulnerable Posh.

 Audio-visual sessions punctuating the show displayed creations of students who had worked in the area of visual merchandising for retail houses like Shoppers Stop, Gini amp; Jony and others.

 The ramp show was choreographed by Swarup Dutta and Abhijit Chanda was in charge of make-up.

 The ensembles were flaunted by seasoned ramp walkers Shonal Rawat, Sonalika, Tina, Jessica, Pamela, Anusmriti, Shresthaa, Konkona, Neeraj and others.

 Voiceover: It gives me great satisfaction to produce future professionals who have sound knowledge of both the aspects ? design and technology, said Shantmanu, director of NIFT Calcutta.

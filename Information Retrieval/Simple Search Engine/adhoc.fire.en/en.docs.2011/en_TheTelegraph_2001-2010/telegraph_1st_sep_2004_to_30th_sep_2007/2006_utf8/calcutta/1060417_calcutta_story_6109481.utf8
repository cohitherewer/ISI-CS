Claiming to play the beauty queen in Ankahee 

from her imagination, ESHA DEOL tells Pratim D. Gupta how she has gone 

in for a conscious glamorous makeover

 Esha Deol in Ankahee

You have a very glamourous look in Ankahee. 

Is it just for the movie or a conscious makeover?

The glamorous look in Ankahee is because I 

am playing the character of Miss Universe. I had to look that way to carry off 

such a character. But yes, you can say it?s a conscious makeover. Not just in 

Ankahee but otherwise also. It started from Dhoom, you can say. 

When Aditya Chopra contacted me and told me about the role, I knew I could do 

it because only Yashji and Adi can present their actresses so aesthetically. 

You started out playing baby-faced characters. 

Now you are playing a glam queen. Has it been difficult to adjust?

I am growing as an actor with each and every film. 

An actor has to be at ease playing any kind of character. Its not easy or difficult. 

When you play a character you have to play it accordingly. I couldn?t have worn 

a glamorous look for my role in Koi Mere Dil Se Pooche. Na Tum Jaano 

Na Hum was again a very different character. I was playing this very sweet, 

girl-next-door kind of character. I couldn?t have worn revealing clothes for that. 

Although the film didn?t too well at the box-office, it is very close to my heart 

as that was the first film I faced the camera for. 

Your character is inspired from Sushmita Sen. Was 

it unnerving to play her?

First of all I didn?t take it as his (Vikram Bhatt) 

story. I just heard the script and emoted it like any other story. I never thought 

it to be his story or anything like that.

I cannot be Sushmita Sen, I cannot look like her. 

I never tried to be her for my character. The character itself is very challenging 

but not because it is inspired by someone?s life.

Did you do any homework or workshop to slip into 

the shoes of a beauty queen?

No homework as such. But when I read the script I 

thought I could be a tennis player or anything but not a glam doll. Thanks to 

Vikram who thought I could carry off such role. He helped me a lot and I tried 

my best to give 100 per cent to the character, be it while acting or the way I 

look in the film.

After being part of ensemble casts in hit films 

like Dus, No Entry and Dhoom, Ankahee actually revolves 

around you. How does that feel?

It obviously feels good. Our industry is a male-dominated 

industry and it is difficult to get a female-centric role. I am happy that the 

trends are now changing and we have so many films focussing on women characters. 

But I am also happy that I was a part of Dus, No Entry and Dhoom. 

All those films did well and it helped my career.

There were reports of you being involved in a relationship 

with Aftab Shivdasani at a certain point in your life. Was it difficult to do 

a full-fledged movie with him again?

I don?t want to talk about my personal life. I will 

just say it was very nice working with Aftab. He was my co-star in my debut film. 

It was nice to share the screen with him again. He is a good actor, which helped 

me give a better performance.

Your Ankahee director Vikram Bhatt is involved 

with your co-star Ameesha Patel. Did you fear being overshadowed by her in the 

movie?

Oh no! There was no such fear at all. I have not shot 

any scene with Ameesha but I saw her in the film during dubbing and she has done 

a very good job. When I read the script I knew exactly what my role was and there 

was no scope for any fear after that. I never think how much my role in a film 

is and how much the other person is playing. The character I play should be good, 

even if I appear for 10 minutes in a film.

Your mother (Hema Malini) is planning her next 

directorial venture with you. What will it be like, being directed by your mother 

on screen, and not stage?

Oh yes, I am excited and nervous at the same time. 

Mum is a perfectionist. I have shared the stage with her during our dance performances 

and I tell you, she is still better than me. Working with her for a film should 

be very exciting although nothing has been finalised as yet. Hopefully we should 

start shooting by the end of this year. 

What other films have you committed to?

Indra Kumar?s Pyaare Mohan is ready for release. 

Cash by Anubhav Sinha, for which I?ll start shooting in a day or two, and 

there is Reema Kagti?s Honeymoon Pvt Ltd.

 East meets west with Bard and Baul

 Kevin Rowntree had a maternal uncle called Rabindranath, but thats not why he chose to stage Tagores Raktakarabi for theatre audiences in London early this year. The RADA-trained British actor, who debuted as theatre director with Red Oleander (Raktakarabi), has inherited a love for Rabindranath Tagores works from his mother. 

 Rowntrees maternal great grandfather was from Lucknow who shifted to Guyana as part of the workforce. My mother worked in Kashmir as a nurse. Her father was a lawyer and had met Gandhiji and Tagore. So my mother and his two brothers were brought up on their literature which came to London with her. My early age was spent reading Gitanjali and Tagore plays, recounts Rowntree, in town as a British Council guest to attend the Nandikar theatre festival.

 Red Oleander is Rowntrees effort to introduce Tagore to the western audiences. I think now is the time to revisit Tagore and discover Tagore in performance. I did Red Oleander because I felt it was still very relevant. But there arent any modern translations of Tagore plays, that is maybe why western directors are not interested, says Rowntree, for whom Ananda Lals translation of Raktakarabi came in handy. But we also got back to Tagores own translation and the original Bengali play through one of our actors, Chandana Banerjee.

 The multi-cultural casting was a high point of the production. Rowntree drew six actors from Israeli, Punjabi-Nigerian, Syrian-Italian, Japanese and Bengali backgrounds to play 20 characters. Working in English allowed me more freedom. I could use European theatre techniques and also Indian and Japanese styles. All the actors brought their own cultural heritage and different training backgrounds. For two weeks, we tried to find a common working language. The different accents brought really nice layers.

 Rowntree was interested in the physical manifestation of the King, who remains invisible in Tagores play. And so theres the multi-headed scorpion king, formed with all the actors lining up behind Nigerian-Punjabi actress Sally Okafor.

 To make sense of the mythological symbolism of Tagores play, Rowntree decided to contextualise it with the the Bhopal gas tragedy. I felt the disaster was universal, its a part of our shared consciousness. We created a prologue to set the backdrop.

 Red Oleander is the first play from Myriad Productions, Rowntrees company that aims to do rare, challenging world theatre. I want to try some East European playwrights, Japanese comedies and Tagores Card Country (Tasher Desh), adds Rowntree.

 After a trip to Santiniketan, Rowntree will be ready to rehearse for his role of Dushyanta in Trestle Theatre Companys forthcoming production Little India, based on the tale of Shakuntala.

 Rowntree hopes to bring Red Oleander to Calcutta next year.

 British-born music composer and guitarist Sam Mills can rsquo;t seem to get enough of the ldquo;hidden messages and the many layers of rustic yet sophisticated charm of Baul music rdquo;. His love for the folk traditions of Bengal has brought him back to Calcutta after 10 years, to ldquo;reconnect rdquo;. This time, Sam is catching up with local musicians and attending music concerts before leaving for Santiniketan to meet his wandering friends.

 ldquo;I hope to catch up with the Bauls and hear them sing but my main intention of going to Santiniketan is to meet Subal Das Baul. I believe he can be defined as a national treasure and he is quite old now, rdquo; says Sam, who believes that it is not just music that inspires him to create something different but the people he meets along the way.

 ldquo;My passion for Baul music grew after I met and jammed with Paban (Das Baul) which later materialised into a musical collaboration, Real Sugar. Likewise, my bond with Susheela helped open up the world of Carnatic music for me. rdquo; Sam connected with singer Susheela Raman during the recording of her first album Salt Rain after which they got married and have been living in London since.

 On being asked if he can read or write Bengali, Sam rattles off: ldquo;Amar khub mushkil hoy juktakkhor shobdo porte kintu ektu ektu pari (laughs)! rdquo; Sam spent two years in Bangladesh studying Sufism and it was there that he developed an interest in fakirs and the Sufi tradition of Bengal. Sam recalls the times spent exchanging musical ideas with Gautam Chattopadhyay (the founder of Mohiner Ghoraguli) during his visit to Calcutta in the early Nineties. ldquo;I have always been interested in folk music and quite fond of African and Asian music. I feel it rsquo;s good to have an open ear, rdquo; says Sam, who was once part of a West African band called Tama.

 Mira Nair rsquo;s forthcoming film The Namesake will feature two of his songs. ldquo;I had recorded a version of a Bollywood song Yeh mera deewanapan several years ago in Susheela rsquo;s voice. Mira had heard it and wanted to use it in a comic sequence in the film. Another composition of mine called The Same Song , sung by Susheela in a previously-released album, has been used towards the end. Mira felt both the songs were appropriate for her film and it has turned out very well, rdquo; smiles Sam.

 Sam is working on the guitar arrangement for a couple of songs with Chennai-based music director Paul Jacob. The 40-something music maker toured around France in October-November along with a band of Tamil musicians performing a sort of Carnatic rock and roll, which he terms ldquo;Carnatic Voodoo rdquo;. 

 Sam, who has watched Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak rsquo;s films, is keen to work for a Bengali director someday. ldquo;What I really like in any music is the rasik element. That rsquo;s one of the reasons why Baul music appeals so much to me, rdquo; explained Sam, before rushing off to a Kishori Amonkar recital at Calcutta Club.

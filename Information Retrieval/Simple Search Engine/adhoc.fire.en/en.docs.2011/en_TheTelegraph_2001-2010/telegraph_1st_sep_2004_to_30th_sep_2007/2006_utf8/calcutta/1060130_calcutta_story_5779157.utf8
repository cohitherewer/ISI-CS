 Teenager arrested for fake kidnap

 OUR BUREAU

 He?s arty, but not crafty enough to pull off his own staged abduction.

 Sitting in his married elder sister?s Kasba residence, 19-year-old handicrafts artisan Subrata Ghosh, of Burdwan, had successfully carried out everything, from making ransom calls to terrorising his parents by referring to the recent murder of Ankit Desai.

 But all his efforts came to a nought early on Sunday when police stormed into a house in Burdwan, only to find Subrata chatting with four friends on a bed. Subrata and his four friends, all between 16 and 18, were arrested on the charge of faking an abduction.

 ?All the arrested boys confessed to the crime. Subrata said he had called his friends in Calcutta on Friday morning and hatched the plan to milk his parents. He also admitted that all of them had boarded the same train from Howrah station the same morning, reached Burdwan and hid themselves in a village,? said Peeyush Pandey, superintendent of police, Burdwan.

 Subrata disappeared after leaving his sister?s house on Friday. He and his elder brother Supriyo came to a handicrafts fair at Kasba, off the EM Bypass. The duo was staying at sister Sharmila Sarkar?s residence. He then decided to go to an exhibition in Santiniketan.

 ?Subrata left on Friday morning. On his way, he was supposed to go home to collect his works to display them at the exhibition. But he did not turn up,? said Sharmila.

 Both Subrata?s family in Burdwan and sister in Kasba had received ransom calls. ?The first call for Rs 50,000 came around 8 pm at Subrata?s Burdwan house,? recounted Chaitali, Subrata?s mother. 

 Burdwan police contacted Lalbazar police headquarters. A manhunt was launched and police stations in the city and the districts were alerted.

 The second call asked the Ghosh family members to wait with the money in front of Burdwan Agricultural College on Saturday. No one turned up to collect the ransom. Police tracked down Subrata through his phone calls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Briefs

 Forest 

 department staff in Howrah seized red sandalwood worth Rs 

 20 lakh, believed to be smuggled from South India, from an 

 Eastern Railway godown on Tuesday. Assistant divisional forest 

 officer Pradip Kumar Dutta said: We had information that 

 the consignment was smuggled from South India. It came here 

 en route to Japan and Thailand. The raid on the godown followed 

 a tip-off. An officer said no one had come forward to claim 

 the consignment. 

 The 

 monsoon bade adieu to Calcutta and the rest of the state on 

 Tuesday. Met officials, however, said isolated rains would 

 continue for the next two-three days. The showers on Tuesday 

 were caused by an upper-air cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh 

 and Gangetic Bengal, said J.V.M. Naidu, of Regional Meteorological 

 Centre, Alipore. 

 About 

 5,000 cops will be deployed in the city during Kali puja. 

 The stress will be on Metro Rail security. Starting October 

 22, three days have been fixed for immersion. This year, 2,066 

 clubs have been allowed to organise puja. 

 The 

 last date for filling up forms by special and continuing candidates 

 who will sit for the Higher Secondary (HS) 2007 has been extended 

 to November 16. An official said many students could not fill 

 up the forms on time because of floods. 

 The 

 state government announced on Tuesday that those displaced 

 in eviction drives would be relocated in Nonadanga, off EM 

 Bypass. The decision followed a meeting between urban development 

 minister Asok Bhattacharya and Trinamul Congress MLA Sougata 

 Roy. 

 About 

 100 Trinamul Congress activists, led by Javed Khan, held a 

 rally outside the civic headquarters on Tuesday afternoon. 

 They were protesting the authorities failure to check spread 

 of dengue. 

 A 

 team from Behala police station arrested D.K. Nandy at his 

 Sarat Bose Road office on Tuesday afternoon, following a complaint 

 of financial fraud against him. Ashoke Maity, a Behala resident, 

 has complained that Nandy had borrowed Rs 5 lakh from him 

 but was refusing to repay.

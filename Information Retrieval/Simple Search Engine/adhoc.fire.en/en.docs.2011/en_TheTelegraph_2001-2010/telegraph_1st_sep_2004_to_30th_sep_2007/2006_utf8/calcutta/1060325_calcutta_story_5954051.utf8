 Functional fabric in seasons style

 The heat is on and as the city packs its woollens off to the laundry and reaches for lighter clothing, the one fabric that scores high this season, again, is cotton. While Indians turn to silks and blended fabrics for occasions, cotton finds favour for its functionality.

 KSA Technopak, a leading retail and brand research and consultancy firm commissioned by the Cotton Gold Alliance (an initiative of Cotton Council International and Cotton Incorporated), has submitted a report on the changing market for cotton fabrics.

 The survey shows that though durability, comfort and reasonable costs make cotton popular with consumers, there has been little change in the image perception of cotton over the last three years. The image study of various fibres reveals that while silk still occupies the slot of rich and modern, cotton is categorised as homely and middle class. And according to KSA Technopak, cotton promotion campaigns should focus on changing this image.

 The study reveals that as far as apparels are concerned, the choice of 100 per cent cotton wear may have increased in undergarments for men,women and children, but for shirts, trousers, dresses and saris, blended fabrics are preferred, though there is an increased market for predominantly cotton apparel.

 The survey spanned the years 2003, 2004 and 2005. In mens shirts for instance, 53 per cent went for 100 per cent cotton and 44 per cent for cotton blends in 2003. But by 2005, only 29 per cent chose 100 per cent cotton and 45 per cent blended fabrics. The percentage of women who chose full cotton saris in 2003 was 35 compared to 7 per cent who chose mixed cottons. But by 2005, the number who chose full cotton saris had fallen to 33 per cent, while mixed cotton saris were favoured by 13 per cent.

 The scene is merry in the sectors of childrens apparels and household linen. If the percentage of people who bought 100 per cent cotton childrens dresses in 2003 was 29, in 2005 it was 42. For childrens sleepwear, the percentage of full cotton buys went from 63 to 66 over 2003-05, while home linen like 100 per cent cotton bedsheets crept up from 76 to 77 per cent in the same period.

 The survey agency recommends that since there is a strong consumer preference for predominantly cotton fabrics, especially in mens wear, and brands and retailers are now experimenting with cotton blends, a promotional campaign for cotton blended fabrics will bring out the variety that cotton has to offer to the consumer.

 But is cotton really just functional? Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh says: Cotton is never in fashion or out of fashion, it is a classic. She admits that she loves the flow of chiffon, but she works a lot with cotton and is currently working on a summer line in cotton. Cotton, she says, is great for summer wear ? it is weavable, breathes well, is comfortable and looks natural.

 One can think of nothing but cotton for summer. Wearing synthetics and silk is unthinkable in this heat, says designer Sharbari Datta.

 From beautiful chikankari pieces and gorgeous Dhakai saris to the elegant addir kurta, cotton is a favoured choice of the truly fashionable.

 Sharbaris summer collection, because it consists of occasion wear, is always of cotton blended with silk in 60:40 or 80:20 ratio. This fabric known as matka offers a wonderful richness. Pure cotton is not dressy and after all can only cater to a single season, but blended cotton fabrics in India are today amazingly rich in colour scheme, texture and weave. Bengal taant is now often as gorgeous as the traditional Benarasi and those who have confidence can definitely wear them to weddings and parties, offers Sharbari. 

 So while the vaster majority switches to cotton just to beat the heat, manufacturers and designers work hard to add richness to the yarn.

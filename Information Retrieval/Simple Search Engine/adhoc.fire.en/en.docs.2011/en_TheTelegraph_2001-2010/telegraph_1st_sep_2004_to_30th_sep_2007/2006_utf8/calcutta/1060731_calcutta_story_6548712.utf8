 You share your birthday with...

 J.K. Rowling

 You are sociable and friendly. You have an independent streak; you want your liberty in business, career and relationships. You are always active, pleasant, a bit moody, and sometimes critical. You are wise with your money, but don?t be too fussy; treat yourself to something nice once in a while. ? Kusum Bhandari

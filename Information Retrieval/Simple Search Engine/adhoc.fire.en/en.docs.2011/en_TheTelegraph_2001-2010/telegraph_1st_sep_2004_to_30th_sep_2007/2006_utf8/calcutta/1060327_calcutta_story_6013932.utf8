 Memory-art relationship is as old as art itself, typically drawing out the context of observation or the emotional impact of the experienced event. Reflecting the artists? perception of reality, it prioritises their reactions and responses, relegating the causative phenomenon to a subordinate position. The Journey Recollected, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Piu Sarkar is such ?an experience of optical documentation? of her journey through the Sundarbans. Done in mixed media on paper, they have a sketchy mode of execution that seems to serve as an appropriate language-frame for the visual mutation of scenes and objects. Capturing the sensation of the abrupt movements of animals and birds (Maachhranga; picture left), she emphasises rhythm, mood and speed of flight, run or swim by blurring her subject and denoting movement through linear, zigzag or dotted lines. Reminiscent of Paul Klee?s method of recreation of physical sensation of the phenomenal, her paintings derive an endearing quality through their ability to simulate fleeting and ephemeral movements.

 Burgle chain trips police

 - THEFTS GO UNSOLVED

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The first few days of 2006 do not augur well for the police, hoping for a ?crime-under-control? run throughout. More than two dozen cases of burglary were reported in January, but none has been cracked.

 Senior officers of the detective department?s anti-burglary wing are worried not just because of the pending cases, but the fact that the burglars are striking with increasing regularity all across the city.

 Two cases of shop burglary were reported in the past five days. Two days ago, employees of a mobile phone shop on Mission Row found the shutter locks broken when they turned up in the morning. On entering the shop, they found all 18 mobile handsets on the racks stolen. Money was also missing from the cash box.

 Similarly, an electronic goods shop in Alipore was cleaned out of digital cameras and cash.

 Asked about the failure in busting the racket, an officer of the detective department said: ?The gang is yet to be identified. It seems the burglars are from neighbouring states and are working in tandem. We are on the job and special measures are being initiated.?

 Agreeing that the city?s burglary curve is soaring by the day, another officer said: ?The spurt follows a lull of around six months. In the middle of last year, we were flooded with complaints of shop burglary. A few criminals were arrested, but the kingpins could not be reached.?

 Those arrested were from Bihar. ?They came to the city with a number of children from their villages, who were later engaged in the crime,? the officer recalled. ?Sometimes, they squeezed the children into the shops through ventilator shafts. The boys were trained enough to know what to lift.?

 According to police, shops selling cellphones and other electronic goods top the list of burglars.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of detective department, said some leads are emerging. ?We are expecting a breakthrough soon.?

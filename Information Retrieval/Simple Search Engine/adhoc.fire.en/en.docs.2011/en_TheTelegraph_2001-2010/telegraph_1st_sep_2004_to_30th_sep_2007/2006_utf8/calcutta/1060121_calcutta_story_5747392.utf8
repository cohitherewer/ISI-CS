The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Murderer in circle of friends

 - Cellphone call list helps sleuths draw up roll of five suspects

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On Tuesday night, Charushila Desai kept dialling her son Ankit?s mobile phones. All she heard at the other end, for hours, was: ?The number you have dialled is not reachable.?

 Around Thursday midnight, the phone rang in her Vaishali flat, on Puddapukur Road. It was not her 25-year-old son, missing since Tuesday afternoon. It was a police officer, saying: ?We have found a youth?s body in a steel-grey Chevrolet and the phone number of your house. Could you please help us to identify him??

 Charushila Desai, who had moved into the apartment complex with her son eight months ago from Bowbazar, is in shock. She has no idea who could have killed her son and why.

 But sleuths on the case are confident that the killers were from Ankit?s circle of friends. 

 ?An association with some shady characters in the fast lane and a relationship with a girl could have been the factors behind the murder,? said an officer.

 Vageesh Mishra, inspector-general of police (south Bengal), claimed the force would have ?all the answers? within a day or two.

 The mystery started unravelling once police got their hands on the call statements of both of Ankit?s cellphones. 

 ?He left home around 3.50 pm on Tuesday and the first outgoing call he made was around 4.08 pm, to a girl. The call continued for a minute,? said an officer of Ballygunge police station.

 ?The girl, who lives in a rented house in Dunlop, had taken her cellphone connection on May 31, 2004. She came to the city from Patna around that time,? said the officer.

 ?Ankit used to talk to her over phone regularly, sometimes well after midnight,? he added.

 The statements show at least 11 incoming calls on Ankit?s phones till 10 pm on Tuesday. ?There was no call record on Wednesday but four calls came through on Thursday,? said a sleuth.

 ?Most incoming calls from January 17 to January 19 were made from Puddapukur, Ballygunge Circular Road, Darga Road, Colootola Street and the CR Avenue area,? he added.

 On the basis of the call-list, police have drawn up a catalogue of five suspects, including the girl he had first called, for interrogation.

 ?Two of Ankit?s acquaintances are also missing from January 17. We are looking for them,? said an officer.

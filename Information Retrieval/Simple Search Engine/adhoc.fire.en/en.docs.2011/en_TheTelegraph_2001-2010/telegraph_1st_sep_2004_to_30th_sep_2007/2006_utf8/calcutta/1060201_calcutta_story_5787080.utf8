 Civic body gains e-link 

 All 223 offices of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will be interlinked under an e-networking project being executed by BSNL. 

 Funds for the Rs 16.9-crore project will come from a corpus of Rs 220 crore, granted by the UK?s department for international development for capacity-building of the CMC. 

 The project will be unveiled by Union minister of state for IT Shakeel Ahmed on Wednesday, in the presence of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the networking would be ready in 24 weeks. ?We are investing Rs 100 crore in e-governance.?

 Once the networking is complete, residents can register births or deaths online and can also pay property tax, licence fees or any other fee in any office of the CMC.

 At present, payments are to be made in specified offices. For instance, a house-owner in Behala cannot pay property tax in the civic headquarters or in the Gariahat office.

 E-connectivity will also enable the authorities to keep a tab on revenue collection in civic offices across the city.

 The departments that will benefit from the exercise include assessment-collection, market, licence and advertisement. Solid waste management and public grievance management, too, will receive a boost once the ward and borough offices are linked with the headquarters.

 An official explained that the connectivity drive is two-pronged, aimed at augmenting the capacity of the civic body and facilitating the delivery of civic services to the residents.

 ?We have engaged Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as the project consultant,? said deputy municipal commissioner Nandan Roy.

 TCS is devising an integrated municipal administration system, which will have components like municipal transaction processing system, municipal data bank, stakeholders? interface system and municipal management information system.

 The civic body?s first brush with computerisation was in 1995-2000, when Asim Barman was municipal commissioner. Over 200 personal computers and a dozen servers were installed at a cost of Rs 10 crore. A 40-per cent jump in revenue collection was an immediate fallout of the move.

 Kalighat panda on protest path

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Kalighat pandas will hold a rally and submit a memorandum on September 25 to the Alipore district judge, who is also ex officio chairman of the Kalighat Temple Committee (KTC). They will be demanding the right to enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple.

 A high court interim order last Friday prohibited Kalighat pandas from entering the sanctum sanctorum. On Wednesday, the ones affiliated to Sathi Brahman Sangathan, the umbrella organisation, vowed to continue their protests till they were provided with licences enabling them to enter the garbhagriha. They have also threatened to move the apex court if denied the right to operate peacefully.

 According to Malay Ghosh Dastidar, chairman of the Sangathan, 350 pandas will walk down to the Alipore Judges Court from the temple next Monday. According to a 1994 Supreme Court judgment we have the liberty to appeal to the district magistrate if the existing rights of the pandas are curbed. We are going to submit a deputation demanding recognition, said Ghosh Dastidar.

 The pandas will approach the district judge for licences and photo identity cards enabling them to enter the sanctum sanctorum to perform puja. We will wait for the judges response for a couple of days before we start a sit-in in front of the KTC office, warned Ghosh Dastidar.

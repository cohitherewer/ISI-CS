The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Munnabhai storms plex circuit

 - Last-minute capitulation puts eagerly awaited sequel on multiple screens

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Circuit and Munnabhai 

 Chitto jetha bhoy shunyo/Uchchho jetha shir... Lage Raho Munnabhai producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra recited these lines to Metro, minutes after his meeting with the national multiplex representatives in Mumbai on Thursday evening, making it clear that he would not bow to plex pressure. 

 That was around 5.30 pm. Tagores poetry, rather than Munnabhais jadoo ki jhappi, seemed to do the trick by 7.30 pm, with the city multiplexes agreeing to toe Chopras revenue-sharing line and welcome back Munna and Circuit.

 Till early Thursday evening, Fame (Hiland Park) was to be the only plex in Calcutta releasing the eagerly-awaited sequel to the 2003 blockbuster Munnabhai MBBS. But just like it happened with Krrish and KANK, INOX and 89 Cinemas came on board at the very last minute and now, from Friday, a total of 35 plex shows will play the movie daily with the telling sequel tagline: Ek kahaani khatam to duja shuru ho gayee, mamu.

 Good sense has prevailed, said Chopra, who is also distributing Lage Raho in Bengal. Throughout, we have been asking for a fair deal. In the past three years, we have spent crores making this film involving 150 to 200 people and they (the plexes) would have made more money than us in the first week itself. By the time it would have come to the third week, they wanted to take home 70 per cent of the money!

 According to sources, while Chopra was okay with multiplexes giving him 50 per cent of the overall revenue in Week I, he wanted his share of the pie to go up to 45 per cent from the usual 40 per cent in Week II, and 40 per cent from the usual 30 per cent in Week III. The single screens have never been a problem with producers/distributors, plucking anything between 80 and 85 per cent of the weekly revenues.

 The terms are not unfair, said Fame man Shravan Shroff, managing director of Shringar Cinemas, which is distributing the Sanjay Dutt-Arshad Warsi-Vidya Balan starrer in Mumbai. The prints have come to town and we will be screening the first show at 10.30 am on Friday, said Vikas Syal, general manager, INOX Forum.

 Thanks to the advances, Fame and standalone theatres like Priya, Jyoti, Roxy and Navina have the first-mover advantage. We have had block bookings for a change, this first weekend, with St Xaviers College Alumni and Standard Chartered Bank leading the way, revealed Arijit Dutta of Priya.

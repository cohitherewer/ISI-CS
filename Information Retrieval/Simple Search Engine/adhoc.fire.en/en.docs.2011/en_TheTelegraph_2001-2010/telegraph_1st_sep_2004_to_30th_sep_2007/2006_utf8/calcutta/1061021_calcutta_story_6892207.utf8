 Funds rain down on university

 - Rs 30 crore granted by central dept for infrastructure upgrade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Its raining funds at Calcutta University (CU).

 After the Rs 100-crore package announced by Union finance minister P. Chidambaram in Budget 2006-07, the department of science and technology (DST) has now approved funds to the tune of Rs 30 crore for various departments of the century-old CU.

 The main objective of the DST fund is to improve research facilities by augmenting infrastructure in various science departments and engineering faculties, said Samir Bandyopadhyay, CU registrar.

 The allocation of funds under the scheme varies between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 1.50 crore for each department. 

 The department of science and technology has included more than a dozen departments of CU under its faculty improvement infrastructure development scheme. 

 Some of the departments availing the assistance are electronic science, radio physics, applied physics, pure physics, marine science, geography, biochemistry, geology, physiology, geology, geography and microbiology. 

 Central government-aided and state universities receive financial assistance to develop infrastructure in their science and technology departments under this scheme. 

 The central departments decision is, indeed, good news for CU, which till a year ago was lagging behind other central and state universities in terms of getting DST funds. 

 Till 2005, only 10 of the 30 departments under CUs science and technology faculties were under the DST scheme. 

 But the varsitys performance in the fields of research in the past 12 months forced the DST to rethink endowments for the campus.

 We recruited some very qualified and efficient teachers in the science and technology departments during the past two years. The DST officials were extremely happy with the performance of these teachers, said registrar Bandyopadhyay. 

 The high standards of research by CU teachers was the other reason that prompted the DST to grant the assistance to so many departments in a single year. 

 It is a proud moment for us, as the DST has highly appreciated our ongoing research projects, Bandyopadhyay said.

 The departments, however, will have to spend the amount allotted to them by the DST during the current academic year. In the past, some departments had missed the assistance, as the DST was not convinced that they would be able to complete the projects in a years time. 

 So, the departments are cautious this time and planning in advance to meet the DST deadline. 

 After getting the DST funds, the departments are professionally working out plans to utilise the funds and complete the projects in a time-barred manner, summed up Bandyopadhyay.

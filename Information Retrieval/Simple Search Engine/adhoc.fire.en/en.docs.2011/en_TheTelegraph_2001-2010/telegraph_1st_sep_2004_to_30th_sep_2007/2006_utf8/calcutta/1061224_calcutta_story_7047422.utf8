Homoeopathy is often a good remedy for pet ailments. It reinforces the bodys innate healing powers and is very safe, too. I am not a homoeopath, but with the help of some specialists in this branch and homoeopathy books on dogs, I have tried some medicines on pets and got good results. You can try the following.

 Newborn puppies usually suffer from colic pain, bloat and bad stool. In such cases, you can administer Nux Vomica-6 and Carboveg-6, four times a day.

 Most puppies are born with roundworm. Ten drops of Abrotanum 3X or 6 can be given, mixed with food, thrice a day for a week. The worms will be flushed out on the 7th, 8th or 9th day. 

 A weekly dose of Calcarea Carbonicum-200 will prevent re-infestation of worms. Sometimes puppies show symptoms of rickets due to imbalance in mineral metabolism. A tablet each of Calcarea Phosphorica-3X and Calcarea Carbonica 6X three times a day, along with codliver oil capsule, give good results.

 Try the following, too:

 Bad breath with discharge: Acid carb 30

 Profuse salivation: Merc sol-30

 Body odour: Hepar sulf-30

 Unhealthy skin and dry coat: Sulfur-200

 Anal gland infection (sometimes dogs rub their bottom against the ground and bad odour comes from their body due to anal gland infection): Sulphur-200 in the morning and Nux vomica-200 in the evening.

 Heres what you should give in case of excessive hairfall, leaving patches on the body 

 Hair loss between the shoulder and hair breaking: Lycpodium 12X

 Hair loss from the underbelly: Silica 6X

 Hair loss after giving birth: Sepia 12X

 If the ear is severely infected and in pain, give Heper sulph 6X. If theres a yellow brown discharge with a smell of boiled meat, give Psorinm-30.

 Diarrohea with vomiting: Ars alb 1M + Verat alb1M + Ipecac-30.

 Dysentery, along with blood and loose stool: Marc cor-30

 Loose stool: Marc sol-30

 In case of too much barking, give Causticum. You can also try Collinsonia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell-swiper team of 10 rounded up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 They were initiated in crime as pickpockets but later took to cellphone theft. Their preferred area of operation was EM Bypass, between Apollo Gleneagles Hospital and Science City.

 On Monday morning, all 10 members of the gang, including a woman, were caught in the cop net. Thirty-two phones were found in their possession.

 ?They operated mostly on EM Bypass, between Apollo Gleneagles Hospital and Science City,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department). ?They would board crowded buses and lift mobile phones from the pockets or handbags of commuters.?

 Officers of the detective department swung into action following a large number of complaints of cellphone thefts from across the city. Over the past three months, 72 such complaints were lodged.

 ?All 10 members of the gang, nabbed by a special team, started their career as pickpockets. They were led by a couple ? Hasina, 26, and Sultan, 30,? an officer said. 

 While the two are residents of Topsia, the rest are from adjoining areas, like Tiljala and Park Circus. ?Hasina had been arrested a couple of times on charges of picking pockets,? the officer added.

 A shop-owner in Chandni Chowk who would buy the stolen mobile phones has also been arrested.

 According to the detective department, gangs such as Hasina?s are active in pockets of New Market, Gariahat and Shakespeare Sarani. The criminals on the prowl in these areas are mostly women. There are even a few all-women gangs.

 ?A gang of women is also active in certain Metro stations, including Park Street, Kalighat, Jatin Das Park and Esplanade,? deputy commissioner Singh added. 

 A special team of policewomen is being formed to round up these gangs.

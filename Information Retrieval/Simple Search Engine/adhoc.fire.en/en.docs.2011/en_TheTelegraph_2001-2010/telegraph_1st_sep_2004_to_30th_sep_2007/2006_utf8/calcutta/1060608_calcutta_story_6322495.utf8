 Snatching racket bust

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Government Railway Police (GRP) has busted a snatching racket that was active in Calcutta and its adjoining areas. The kingpin, however, is still at large.

 ?Two men and a woman were arrested in raids in the past few days. During interrogation, we found out that they were part of a larger, organised racket,? said a senior officer of Howrah GRP.

 Two snatchings led to the arrests. The first took place at Howrah station in March this year. A woman lost her jewellery box, containing gold ornaments worth over Rs 50,000, in the incident. A ?thorough? search failed to throw up leads. 

 Last week, an engineer?s handbag was snatched at the station. It contained Rs 70,000 and some documents. 

 ?We had then intensified our search and conducted a number of raids over the past couple of weeks,? added the GRP officer.

 Yunus Khan was the first to be arrested in Canning, South 24-Parganas, last week. The information he provided led to a late-night raid in a house in Baruipur, in South 24-Parganas, on Monday. Sayera Biwi, 30, and Sarit Lashkar, 25, were arrested.

 A gold necklace was found in the house. ?The three confessed to their involvement in the two snatchings. They were also behind another snatching at Howrah station in March,? claimed the GRP officer.

 ?We are probing the matter. The first task is to ascertain the size of the racket. The information provided by the accused indicates they were part of a vast and organised racket. We are on the lookout for other members,? said Howrah GRP inspector-in-charge Taj Mohammad. 

 ?The gang was active in rail terminals like Howrah and Sealdah, and also in the suburbs. Besides, the gang members operated in crowded public transport in Calcutta, Howrah and the fringe areas,? Mohammad added. 

 Another GRP officer explained the modus operandi of the gang: ?The members of gang did not wield any weapon; they only depended on smooth talk and a pair of pliers. At times, they simply picked up a bag while its owner was looking the other way and bolted.?

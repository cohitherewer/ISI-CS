The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Popularity surge for Puja spirit

 Safe Puja. Happy Puja. Meaningful Puja. The chants rose again with the curtains going up on CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2006 on Friday evening.

 An unprecedented number of puja organisers (close to 250) from Calcutta and Howrah turned up to attend the briefing for the event, pointing to its growing popularity. In the face of such a surge for participation, the ceiling of shortlisted participants has been raised from 130-odd in 2005 to 175 in 2006.

 A brief presentation brought out the prime parameters defining true spirit safety measures, civic concerns and social commitment. It is not enough to put ones best foot forward only during the festival. Immersion rules have to be adhered to. Restoration of public property (clearing of parks or repair of roads where pujas are held) is also taken into account, as is round-the-year social work.

 The pat on the back for conscientious puja organisers comes in the form of a cash prize of Rs 5,000 each for 10 two-star pujas, Rs 10,000 each for 10 three-star pujas, Rs 15,000 each for three four-star pujas and Rs 25,000 each for two five-star pujas. The model puja, that shows how the grand autumnal ritual should be organised, gets Rs 50,000.

 Representatives of every public utility service and organisation that helps make the Pujas more enjoyable Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC), Calcutta Police, Pollution Control Board (PCB) were present on the dais at the St Xaviers College auditorium. Concern for Calcutta and Red FM are backing The Telegraph in this effort.

 Ashit Sarkar of the fire services pointed to the two most common kinds of accidents in a pandal either fire-related or caused by the crowd crush in a restricted space. Arumoy Saha of Calcutta Police spoke about the leaflet with guidelines being distributed by the police stations. PCBs Prabir Banerjee expressed satisfaction at how noise pollution was down to negligible levels.

 Puja organisers made full use of the forum to clear doubts and raise objections. It was made known by the panel that plastic carrybags less than the thickness of an A4 sheet could not be used, that loudspeakers must not play music at pandals beyond 10 pm, but public announcements could continue. Dilip Samajpati of CESC tried to address grievances over action taken by the loss control cell.

 A suggestion from Behala Debdaru Phatak that dhaks with decorative plumes be avoided to save cranes drew all-round applause. 

 If rousing a feeling for fellow-beings is what worship is about (in Swami Vivekanandas words), CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2006 is well set for success.

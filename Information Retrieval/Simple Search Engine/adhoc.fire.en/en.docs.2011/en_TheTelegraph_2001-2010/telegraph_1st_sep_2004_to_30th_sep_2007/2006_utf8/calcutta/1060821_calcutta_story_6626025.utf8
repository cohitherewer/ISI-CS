 More water for millions 

 - Boon for Budge Budge 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Around 10 million people living in Budge Budge and its adjacent areas, on the southern fringes of the city, will benefit from a drinking water supply scheme being undertaken by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), under the Ganga Action Plan II.

 The Rs 3-crore project is being funded by the National River Conservation Directorate that functions under the Union ministry of environment and forests, said chief engineer (electrical and mechanical) Bidyut Bhattacharya.

 Two main pumping stations MPS I and MPS II will be set up in Budge Budge. The command area of the pumps covers Budge Budge, Mahestala and parts of Metiabruz. Of the allotted sum, Rs 82.71 lakh will be spent on MPS I and the rest on MPS II.

 While approving the grant, to be released in phases, the river directorate has stipulated that the project would have to be wrapped up in 12 months from the date of sanction. 

 In case of any cost overrun owing to delay in work or some other reason, the excess amount would have to be borne by the state government.

 The government will have to conduct regular reviews of the progress of work to assess the expenditure trend and to find out whether the project is on track. Based on the assessment reports, the river directorate will decide on disbursing the subsequent instalments of the funds.

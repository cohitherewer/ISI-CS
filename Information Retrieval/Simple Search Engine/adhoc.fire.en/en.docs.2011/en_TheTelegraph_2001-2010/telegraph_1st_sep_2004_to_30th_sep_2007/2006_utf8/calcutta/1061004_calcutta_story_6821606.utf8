The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 This 

 year, I was very pleased to see the traffic and security arrangements 

 during the Pujas. Right from Mahalaya, there was enough security 

 at all the metro stations, bus termini and puja pandals. The 

 traffic movement was also smooth and most of us did not face 

 the heavy traffic snarls compared to the previous years. I 

 think the police, especially the traffic department, has done 

 a stupendous job in tackling the tides of pandal-hoppers this 

 year. Keep up the good show round the year.

 Recently 

 when I visited the Maidan to watch a club football match, 

 I was shocked to see the poor condition of the playground. 

 Due to monsoon the ground is full of slush. It is one of our 

 best playing fields; despite that the authorities have not 

 taken steps to maintain it. It will affect the quality of 

 the game and the players performance.

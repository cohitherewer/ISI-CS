 Think photographs ? exotic holidays, fun-filled parties, precious family moments, special friendships, great times and cheesy smiles. Think about displaying them and chances are, youre stuck. Then its all about a staid photo frame ? at best a nice looking staid photo frame.

 If youre slightly more adventurous and far more hardworking, then the display dictum can well be a collage ? the good, old school thought of displaying lifes most cherished moments.

 Cut to 2006 and youre likely to have collected many such memories and some. Tap the innumerable innovative ideas of displaying your photographs, suggests interior designer Ajay Arya.

 True, a mount does add to the depth of a photograph. But its also true that a collage is completely passe and looks highly amateurish, unless of course it is done professionally. With due respect to the love and care going into its making, from the design point of view a casual collage is a big no-no, stresses Ajay.

 Architect and interior designer Vivek Rathore gives Brownie points to the power of photographs in home decor. Whether they are used to set the mood of a space, divert attention from a not-so-perfect spot or add an interesting element, photographs work wonders.

 Interesting spots, innovative frames, differently coloured tones, the world of photo display has no boundaries. GoodLife presents a few ways to show off those Kodak moments, now and forever. 

 Frame facts

 Funky frames might be the best looking objects lying in the showroom but buying and arranging them to suit your home is where begins the designer battle. Imagine being stuck with that cute paw-shaped frame on your intricately carved coffee table!

 So choose frames according to the look of your zone, complementing the interiors or in striking contrast. Ajay feels antique gold frames look stunning on an ornate or classic set up. Likewise, a brushed steel one goes with contemporary interiors.

 While some might feel that natural wood frame is the safest bet, graphic designer Krittika Malhotra suggests doing away with the rigid parameters of the entire frame.Put some bright splashes of colour on your wall and then put up black and white photographs. Add the broken pieces of old, carved wooden frames and paste around the pictures, she suggests. Another option is to slip pictures into solid colour simple frames. Then use transparent nylon wires to suspend these frames from the ceiling. End each of these at different levels for the cool effect, smiles Krittika.

 Sepia style

 Getting your coloured pictures treated to sepia tones is a sure shot winner, feels Ajay. You can choose from any colour family, scales of browns or even blues, depending on the basic look and feel of your home decor.

 The current universal favourite happens to be wenge, a chocolate brown shade of wood polish. Scales from off-white to brown complement this deep look beautifully. Blues look cool too, and black and white hues always manage to create nostalgia and class like nothing else can, he says.

 But you have to watch out while choosing pictures to be treated. Ajay strongly recommends close-up shots since the expression is extremely important. 

 Interior consultant Meenakshi Dutta prefers bringing out the nostalgic touch with black and white shots. These set off brightly painted walls and vibrant curtains beautifully, she says.

 Place perfect

 How many times have you cringed seeing the courier delivery boy staring at your intimate holiday or wedding pictures? Well, the lesson to be learnt is to pick the right picture for the right place.

 As a general rule, keep the personal moments for bedrooms and dens, avoiding such shots in the common drawing area.

 You can also use bare walls of the lobby as a story board by displaying an array of family pictures, says Meenakshi. 

 Vivek feels that this trick doubles as an introductory gimmick too. Another interesting variation is to build a family tree for the dining area ? it is great to keep alive old family ties, he adds. 

 You can also create a false wall in any room and paint it a dark shade. Then convert any of your photographs to a large print ? either in poster finish or flex finish, suggests Meenakshi. 

 If false walls are too much of a headache, you can also focus on any blank wall of your home. 

 As far as the childrens room goes, capture each stage of their growing up. Favourite spots are the study tables and the soft board, adds Meenaskhi. 

 Decor do

 An interesting detail, says Ajay, is to incorporate some great photographs on cupboard shutters. In this way you also end up personalising the furniture.

 Vivek suggests converting dead corners into scenic spots. Get photos enlarged and poster-finish them to create eye catchers, he adds.You can also create personal family calendars or paste pictures on one side of a lamp shade, feels Vivek.

 So, the next time you have a picture to put up, do plot it right.

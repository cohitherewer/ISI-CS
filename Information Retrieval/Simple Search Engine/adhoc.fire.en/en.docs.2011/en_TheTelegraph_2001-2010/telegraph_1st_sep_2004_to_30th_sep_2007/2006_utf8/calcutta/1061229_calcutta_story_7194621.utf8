 THE CAUSE: Getting

 THE EFFECT: Swarming 

 shoppers, raiding the racks for top trends in the remaining 

 few hours of 2006.

 There has been a consistent rise in footfall this month. Sales have gone up by 30 to 35 per cent. The New Years Eve shopping bug has bitten all, says Naveen Mishra, unit head of Shoppers Stop in Forum.

 Metro topples a bulging shopping bag to find out what women and men want, right here, right now.

 For her

 From boots to bustiers and dresses to drapes bring on the bling. Shimmer, sequins and shine, the December 31 party is the place to show it off. The top picks for ladies this weekend has to boast of bling, says designer Komal Sood.

 The colour of the New Year countdown is red. At Bizarre, Westside, Be: and Kyra, scarlet is the scream. But if it is not red, then it is the other end of the palette muted tones and basic browns, whites and blacks, of course.

 Dresses seem to be having a good run at the style box-office, with knee-length the common craze and hemlines ranging from asymmetrical to balloon. Theres no stopping the added effect, everything from faux fur trimmings to knits to all-ivory crochet from Ritu Kumar to buckles.

 Accents are big. Girls are jazzing up their outfits with funky add-ons. Ruched belts and berets are moving fast at Forum.

 For New Years Eve, the thrust is once again on strictly Western silhouettes, in wintry fabrics like brocade, silk, jacquard, thicker cottons, tweed and velvet, says Kiran Prasad from Be:. And for the all-night party on the club lawns, carrying that knitted sexy shrug or cropped jacket is a must.

 For him

 Traditional combos like red and black are a hit this year-end time too, but here comes the classic twist the tie, a jackets best friend, has been ousted by a funky shirt.

 No ones obsessing over ties this time, they would rather pick up a cool shirt, says Ratul Sood from Burlingtons. Men are very brand-conscious today, so labels like Rohit Bal and Priyadarshini Rao are doing well, adds Kiran from Be:.

 Sharp contrasts are in, so how about a black jacket with a turquoise or orange or pink shirt? And theres more to the jacket New Years Eve passport to the party zone than just black. This time, velvet and corduroy rule. Single-button jackets and classic bandhgalas are flying off racks.

 Shah Rukh Khan wore a Shanghai Tang velvet bandhgala in Don and that is doing really well, reveals Ratul.

 Completing his look are chiselled shoes in black and tan, adds the man behind a Metro counter.

 MOBILE MANIA

 Service providers are anticipating a doubling of the SMS count on New Years Eve and are cashing in on the festive frenzy with free downloads for hello tunes, New Year greetings and party songs.

 Varsity snubs probe cry

 - Principals lobby sees red over suspension by college body

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Calcutta University syndicate has struck down an appeal by a CPM-backed lobby for a probe into the suspension of the principal of a Howrah college a decision many say is unprecedented in the 30 years of Left Front rule in the state.

 The Council of College Principals had appealed against the order of suspension of Kalachand Saha general secretary of the organisation by the governing body of Prabhu Jagatbandhu College and sought a probe by the syndicate.

 Saha was accused of slapping a teacher of the college during a meeting, a charge he has admitted to.

 But the syndicate on Tuesday unanimously ruled out a probe on the grounds that the university is not empowered to challenge the decision of a college governing body, which is an autonomous entity.

 The issue was discussed by the members of the syndicate. We are not going to conduct any probe, asserted registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.

 In a balancing act, however, the university decided to inspect the college to ascertain whether academic activities are being hampered because of Sahas suspension.

 The principals council had pleaded for reversal of the suspension order, citing disruption of academic activities over the issue.

 The council on Wednesday described the syndicates decision as unfair and shocking and threatened to take up the matter with higher authorities in the government. 

 The university should not have rejected our appeal in this way. This is depressing. The judgment will disrupt academic activities in colleges in future, said council president Gyanankur Goswami, principal of Shyamaprasad College.

 Another member of the council argued that the university has the right to conduct an inquiry, as academic affairs of a college are fully under its control. 

 The university cannot ignore the issue as the functioning of the college will suffer if further trouble erupts there. the member added.

 Saha was suspended on October 19, following a complaint that he had slapped a teacher who had accused him of misusing his powers and college funds.

 Saha later apologised to the teacher for his conduct.

 I should not have lost my temper. But the teacher had overstepped his limits and insulted me publicly for no fault of mine. I hope I will get justice, he said.

 Not renowned for being one of the most aesthetically pleasing areas of Calcutta, the alleys of Kalighat?s ward 83 are undergoing somewhat of a renovation, thanks to a combination of local kids and artists. 

 Explaining the motivations behind the project, programme coordinator Arnab Basu said: ?It may be an alley leading to a brothel, but that doesn?t mean it has to be a dark, dirty alley leading to a brothel.? 

 For the past five years, New Light has provided medical assistance to sex workers, as well as shelter for their children and other people considered to be at risk. As a lighter diversion from their normally sombre work of dealing with (among other things) public health issues, the drab walls are being repainted by local children, under the guidance of noted Bengali artist Samir Roy and Spanish artist Rosa Ibanez.

 ?I really enjoy myself when I work on this project. It is very entertaining and worthwhile. Some of the kids are unbelievably talented little artists,? said an enthusiastic Roy. ?We have been doing a wide range of activities, including clay-moulding and painting.? 

 Madrid-born Rosa Ibanez agreed, saying: ?It has been very valuable for me. It is my first time in India and doing projects such as this are great for exposing myself to Indian culture. It is very different being a tourist.?

 The process of painting the walls, Ibanez explained, ?is all about getting the kids to feel comfortable with image-making, getting them to think about what they want to portray and developing ideas?. 

 A morning worker at Mother Teresa?s, Ibanez voiced surprise at the subject matter that the kids chose, with religion playing but a peripheral role in the murals. 

 ?Obviously Kali features, but that was the only religious theme. I thought the kids would paint icons of Indian pop culture, but they have all taken very individual routes.?

 After they finish the walls, they will begin decorating the rundown pillars of a building, which now serves as the New Light office. That is expected to take a fortnight.

 Twin suicides by crippled amp; chided 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ever since he suffered a massive blow on the back a few weeks ago, Moloy Dey, in his early fifties, had wondered whether he would ever get back on his feet. 

 Lying on an iron cot at ESI Hospital in Maniktala, he bravely battled his misfortune, even as doctors tried frantically to ease the unbearable pain.

 But Dey could take it no more. Finally, on Wednesday. he committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling of the hospital?s bathroom some time at night. The nylon rope he used to end his life was borrowed from a ward-mate.

 The body was discovered on Thursday morning, when a ward-mate entered the bathroom. 

 ?It is a very unfortunate incident,? said a senior officer at Maniktala police station. ?The man had probably overheard doctors writing off his case and couldn?t take it any more. We have sent the body for post-mortem. It appears he was down with depression.?

 Dey was a resident of Netajipally, in Jagaddal, on the northern fringes of the city.

 He suffered the blow on his back on a November afternoon last year while working at a jute mill. He returned home crippled with pain.

 Repeated visits to local doctors went in vain. On the advice of some of his friends, he went to ESI Hospital in Maniktala, where he was admitted to the male neuro ward on November 28.

 A team of doctors attending to him found that two vertebrae of the spinal cord were critically damaged.

 The doctors tried their best, but failed to fix the bones. ?It gradually appeared that Dey would never be able to walk or work like he used to. The damage was permanent,? said the police officer. 

 Hospital inmates claimed that three days ago, Dey had asked one of the ward-mates, who was on traction, for the nylon rope he had been using. Unable to figure out Dey?s plan, the man from Bawali, in South 24-Parganas, agreed to lend him the rope. 

 Maniktala police station was rattled with another suicide during the day. Swapna Das, 16, who had consumed poison three days ago, died at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday morning. 

 ?Swapna was a habitual late-riser. On January 16, she was severely rebuked by father Ananta for leaving bed at 7.45 in the morning. That afternoon, she consumed pesticide,? said a police officer.

 As froth started oozing out of her mouth, neighbours rushed Swapna to hospital. Doctors said the poison had entered her blood in ?dangerous proportions?, resulting in multi-organ failure.

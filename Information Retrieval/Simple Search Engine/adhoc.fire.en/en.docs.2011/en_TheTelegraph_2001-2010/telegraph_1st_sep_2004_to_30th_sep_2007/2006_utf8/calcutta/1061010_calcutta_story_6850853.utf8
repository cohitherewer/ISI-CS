 Seven peaks 

 on seven days

 Indian Institute of Management 

 Calcutta on September 19 felicitated its alumnus Malli Mastan 

 Babu for breaking the fastest to seven summits world record.

 A pass-out of IIT Kharagpur (1998) 

 and IIM Calcutta (2004), Malli quit the corporate world 

 to fulfil his childhood dream, inspired by Lt M Uday Bhaskar 

 Rao who lost his life in the 1985 Indian Army Everest Expedition. 

 Between January and July, the 32-year-old scaled the tallest 

 peak in each of the seven continents in a world record time 

 of 172 days.

 He also became the first Indian 

 to climb the tallest peaks in each of the continents, as 

 well as to scale Mt Vinson-Massif, the highest point of 

 Antarctica. Interestingly, he scaled each summit in seven 

 different months and on seven different days of the week. 

 With several records under his belt he is now all set to 

 scale the Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia, the highest peak 

 in Australasia, before officially applying to the Guinness 

 Book of Records.

 Malli has been felicitated at 

 many functions in the US. He was given the Outstanding Youth 

 of the Year award by Senator John Kerry in Los Angeles at 

 the Walt Disney concert hall. He was conferred the title 

 Pride of India by Indian American Friendship Council at 

 Dallas on August 27.

 I feel extremely happy that one 

 of our former students has achieved such a feat. It is a 

 pleasure to see people do out-of-the-ordinary things, so 

 Malli is special, said Anindya Sen, dean (Programme Initiative), 

 IIM Calcutta. The director of IIM Calcutta presented Malli 

 with a plaque and a cheque of Rs 1 lakh to help him in the 

 expedition.

 In 2003, Malli founded the Adventure 

 Club in IIM Calcutta to encourage students to take up sports 

 like trekking, rock climbing, rafting and paragliding.

 Adventure sports are a framework 

 for learning leadership skills. It is about risk, challenge 

 and discovery. The same structure can be extended to the 

 corporate world where one has to take risks, face challenges 

 in the form of exploiting opportunities and discover new 

 ways of harbouring growth. Thus, participating in adventure 

 sports help in strengthening character and in improving 

 crisis management skills, said Malli.

 Armed with the lessons he learnt 

 while attempting the daring feat, Malli has given a number 

 of motivational talks for The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE), 

 HCL, Indotronix and Brahma Kumari Ashram Scouts. He plans 

 to devote some time after his next expedition to catching 

 up on some much needed rest and writing a book about his 

 expeditions. He also wishes to organise leadership expeditions 

 and treks to mountains for students and corporates.

 Malli has set an example by taking 

 the path less-trodden and giving up the comforts of a cushy 

 life to pursue his dreams. He is a role model for students 

 to achieve their own dreams in life, remarked Abhishek 

 Saha, a second-year student at IIM Calcutta.

Dedar Khobor, a monthly 

 Bengali newspaper by schoolchildren, was launched in the 

 city on September 24 to commemorate Girl Child Day.

 The paper is the brainchild of 

 NGO Prayasam, with support from Unicef. Students of about 

 60 schools in North 24-Parganas have been approached by 

 the NGO to contribute articles in the newspaper. They have 

 the right to voice their views about the policies formulated 

 for them, said Sulagna Roy, education officer, Unicef. 

 The children are free to report 

 on events, while the editorial section will be written by 

 a teenager. Social inclusion is very important. Let us 

 make sure to involve the children, said Unicef official 

 Francesco dOvidio. Dedar Khobor will come out for 

 three consecutive months before seeking corporate sponsorship.

 Events galore

 Lady Brabourne College hosted 

 a series of intra-college competitions from September 18

 was Baishe Srabon. The results for all the contests were 

 announced on September 20.

 Fresh batch

 The Calcutta chapter of AIESEC, 

 an international organisation of students and young executives, 

 organised a leadership training seminar for new recruits 

 in September. Day One had innovative ice-breaker games 

 which helped the participants get to know each other better. 

 Then they were introduced to the Calcutta executive body 

 of AIESEC. The youngsters discussed current issues and learnt 

 about AIESECs history. Next was a talk on the organisations 

 exchange programme and the role of the members. The team 

 building activities cemented trust and confidence in the 

 new-found friends.

 On Day Two, a presentation of 

 the three sectors of AIESEC by their respective vice-presidents 

 provided further insight into the organisations working. 

 In the evening, parents of the participants were made aware 

 of their wards involvement with AIESEC. All the action 

 was followed by a new recruits meet where they were allocated 

 to various departments of the body. 

 Many of the new AIESEC members 

 from 15 cities of the country attended the national leadership 

 development seminar in Mangalore later in September.

 Against addiction

 A seminar on substance abuse for 

 students of classes XI and XII was held at Birla High School 

 (Girls) before it closed for the Pujas. Ranjana Roy, the 

 school counsellor, explained the causes and effects of substance 

 abuse. This was followed by a talk by Satyajit Ash, who 

 told the students about the various types of drugs and their 

 harmful effects, on the user and his or her family.

 We were told that one out of every 

 five people are susceptible to alcohol addiction. Peer pressure, 

 we learnt, is one of the main reasons for the habit. A member 

 of Alanon, an organisation that supports families of alcoholics, 

 shared her experience of having had to look after alcoholic 

 family members. The students were moved by other real-life 

 tales of courage against adversities and the will to give 

 up the addiction.

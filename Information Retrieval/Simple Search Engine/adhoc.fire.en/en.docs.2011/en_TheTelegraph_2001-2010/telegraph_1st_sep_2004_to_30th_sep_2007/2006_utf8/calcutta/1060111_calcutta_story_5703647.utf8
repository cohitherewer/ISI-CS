 The exhibition being held on a regular basis since 1990, witnessed participation by at least 150 companies this year. While there were big names like Varmora Tiles, Berger Paints and furnishing houses like DZone and Mobel Furniture, the lesser-known names were not far behind as one witnessed a significant crowd outside each stall.

 One thing that makes this exhibition stand out from the rest is the fact that one not only gets product information but also gets to witness true to life mock-up rooms in different design concepts like bedrooms, living rooms, bathrooms and the like, says Ajit Jain, president of ABID. As a result, most stalls are nothing short of a visual treat.

 Interior and furniture designer Pooja Chitlangias stall Envisage is a perfect example. Done in the model of a den, complete with wooden flooring, wooden seaters, leather recliners and a small bar counter, this won the young designer the first prize for Best Design.

 Days of planning and very hard work went into creating this space. And it was very important that I create the right ambience so that the kind of furniture I do automatically appeals to the visitors. The response right from Day One has been just fabulous, smiles the debutante at the exhibition.

 The host of products on offer at Interiors 2006 to do up your home and office in some solid style is rich and varied. To begin with, there are high-end designer tiles in ceramic floor tiles and vitrified tiles on offer from big names like Varmora, Euro and Tilesquare.

 Says Ajay Raj Baid, director of Tilesquare, Tiles today are the most sought after accessories to do up your home. People are willing to experiment with new designs and colour combinations. We have been getting some very good orders from architects, contractors and interior designers, and are looking forward to more.

 The Berger Paints stall that has unveiled its Illusions range, Metallic finished designs and Glowing Stars in shades of fluorescent, has also been a bestseller, according to fair figures.

 But if glass is what you have in mind to do up your place, Beau Monde is the stall to be in. This space, which won first prize in the Product Category, surpasses all in terms of innovation and design. With a wide range of mirrors and decorative glass pieces in the choicest of colours and intricate designs, some hand made and the other machine made, the products at Beau Monde are a perfect blend of the traditional and the contemporary.

 Done on a much larger scale than the other years, Interiors 2006 has indeed been an experience for both participants and visitors. Says a spokesperson for Dorset Doorware, We have been taking part in this for the last couple of years now and I would say the response this year has been absolutely fabulous. It is better organised with more sponsors and the number of orders has also gone up significantly.

 Clergy fast for school bill

 - June 29 rally to protest loss of recruitment rights

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 More than 300 bishops, nuns and priests will take part in a fast on June 29 to pressure the government into withdrawing the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2006.

 ?We have kept students and teachers out of the June 29 demonstrations because the schools have just opened after the summer vacation. We do not want to disrupt the new academic session,? stated Father Faustine Brank, president of the education cell of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba and a member of the Association of Christian Schools.

 The demonstration by the clergy, responsible for running the Christian missionary schools in Calcutta and its suburbs, will kick off with a prayer meet near Rani Rashmoni?s statue at Esplanade at 10 am. A section of the demonstrators, including priests and nuns, will later start a fast, which will continue till 4 pm. 

 The demonstrators will then march to Raj Bhavan to submit a memorandum to Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi. From there, they will proceed to Writers? Buildings to hand over a copy of the memorandum to the chief minister. A signature campaign will also be conducted during the day.

 ?We will not eat during the demonstration. A hunger strike is a stronger form of agitation. We thought it more appropriate to organise a fast to remind the government about its assurance before the Assembly elections of looking into our demands,? said Herod Mullick, general secretary, Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, which has members from all the churches.

 On the day of the demonstration, teachers and students of the Christian missionary schools in the city and its suburbs will hoist black flags on the premises to remind the government about its promise. 

 ?We have faith in our chief minister and are hopeful that he will take the initiative to withdraw the bill,? said Bishop Brojen Malakar, in-charge of the Barrackpore Diocese of the Church of North India.

 The bill, passed in the Assembly in February, makes it mandatory for state-aided Christian missionary schools to recruit teachers and headmasters through the state school service commission.

 The churches are opposed to the bill as they feel that the missionary schools will not be able to maintain their character and standards if they cannot appoint teachers and headmasters of their choice. 

 On April 4, nearly 100 missionary schools in Calcutta and 600 in the adjoining districts were shut to protest the bill. Rallies were held across the state on the same issue.

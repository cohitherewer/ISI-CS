 SHAUN KENWORTHY

The 

 idea of a recent trip to Bangkok was to go and look at some 

 new restaurant concepts and to source equipment for a new 

 restaurant. The highlight of the trip was going to have 

 a look around the Bed Supperclub. Its one of the coolest 

 bars Ive ever set foot into, every single detail is 

 in white. Only the waitresses in cheeky little French maid 

 uniforms break the monotony. A must-see for anyone passing 

 through Bangkok.

 I have this deep fascination for 

 Bangkok. I believe that Calcutta could look something like 

 it someday, but maybe Im just kidding myself. I remember 

 the first time I went to Bangkok in 1992 with a rucksack 

 on my back. Id just spent a month travelling through 

 India at the time. 

 Its amazing just how far 

 Bangkok has come in the past 14 years. I remember thinking 

 at the time how similar Calcutta and Bangkok were, but now 

 there really is no comparison. Most of the things you can 

 buy there are much cheaper than here and also, theres 

 much more competition there.

 But I think the thing that stands 

 out more than everything else there is just how much respect 

 each and every person has for his or her city. Everything 

 is clean and tidy, even the beggars on the streets seem 

 neat and clean and everyone you meet will greet you with 

 courtesy and a smiling face. 

 The street food in Bangkok, and 

 I suppose all over Southeast Asia, is something to reckon 

 with, with its cleanliness, freshness and prices. This trip 

 was uneventful for all sorts of reasons, but the street 

 food is usually well up there on my agenda when Im 

 travelling. Even the simplest bowl of noodles off the street 

 side will be far better than anything you will find on a 

 five-star hotel menu. 

 Another thing of interest in Thailand 

 is the amount the locals eat out. Thai friends tell me they 

 eat out at least three to five times a week, and most of 

 the time it is to eat simple home-cooked Thai food. People 

 in India cant imagine eating out to eat the same things 

 you eat at home, but if you think about it, it does make 

 sense. Street food is probably as cheap to eat outside as 

 it would be to make at home. 

 I seem to have gone on a bit longer 

 than Id anticipated this week and really havent 

 left myself much space to do much else other than to give 

 you a recipe. The recipe this week is for a Thai classic. 

 Sticky rice with mango 

 and coconut milk

 Soak 250g of sticky rice in enough 

 water to cover, for at least one hour. Next, wash off the 

 rice and place it in a clean microwavable container. This 

 should really be steamed, but thats a bit of a mess, 

 so Im going to use the microwave method for a change. 

 Fill with just enough water to 

 cover, add a pinch of salt and one teaspoon of sugar. Cover 

 the bowl and cook on full power for 10 minutes. Stir once 

 and cook for a further four minutes and allow to rest, still 

 covered. The rice once cooked should be translucent.

 Next, heat around 250ml of coconut 

 milk with two tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt. 

 Sometimes fresh coconut milk will separate, so better to 

 use coconut milk powder for best results. When the sugar 

 has dissolved, allow to cool.

 To assemble, serve a little of 

 the sticky rice with a good helping of freshly sliced ripe 

 mango and a little of the coconut milk for a delicious snack 

 or simple dessert.

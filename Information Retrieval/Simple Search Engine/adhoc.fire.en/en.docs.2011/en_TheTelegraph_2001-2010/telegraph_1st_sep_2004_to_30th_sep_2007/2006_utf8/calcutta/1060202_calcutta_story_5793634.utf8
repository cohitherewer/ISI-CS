The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pass to enter Eden

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a 10-month break, Eden Gardens is set to reopen this weekend, but with a set of rules to regulate entry.

 ?We won?t impose an entry fee as of now. However, visitors will have to collect passes at the gate and deposit them while leaving. This will make them more responsible about their behaviour inside the park,? said forest minister Jogesh Burman on Wednesday.

 According to Burman, after the just-concluded flower fair at Eden Gardens, there has been widespread demand from the public for reopening the park.

 ?We?re trying to impose certain criteria on entry to keep out unruly elements, who might damage flowers and plants. Also, carrying plastic items and umbrellas inside will be banned. Couples are permitted to sit close to each other, but no indecent behaviour will be allowed,? warned the minister. 

 Food stalls will not be set up, but hawkers will be admitted, provided they collect entry passes. The forest department also wants to keep out vagrants and ragpickers. 

 Burman had invited Fort William officers to Writers? Buildings on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter, but they did not turn up. 

 Thereafter, Burman decided to reopen the park after consulting chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.

 ?The major-general couldn?t make it to today?s meeting. However, the chief secretary is writing to the defence minister?s secretary on whether we can impose an entry fee of Rs 2 later on,? said minister Burman.

 Maintenance of the park, including electricity and other expenses, amounts to around Rs 12 lakh annually, he said. Imposition of a Rs 2 entry fee could cover about half of this annual expenditure, Burman claimed.

 The Chintamani Kar Sanctuary at Narendrapur is being fenced now and added attractions are being put in place to bring in more visitors, the forest minister said.

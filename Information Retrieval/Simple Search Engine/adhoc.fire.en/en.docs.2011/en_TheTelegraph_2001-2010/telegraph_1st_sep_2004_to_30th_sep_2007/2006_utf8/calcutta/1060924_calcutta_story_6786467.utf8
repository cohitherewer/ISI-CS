The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Show Stopper

 Hours after Team India had fallen flat in Kuala Lumpur, former skipper Sourav Ganguly was finding his feet on a very different pitch. Late on Friday, Maharaj breezed into Venom, the nightclub on Camac Street, flaunting an outfit from the autumn-winter collection of Provogue.

After wading through waterlogged Camac Street, Sourav 

chatted up choreographer Achla Sachdev (picture beside) and mingled with 

some guests while sipping on Venomously Yours, a kiwi-based mocktail. Denied the 

right to stride out into the middle, bat in hand, he chose to step on to the ramp 

with some top-rung catwalkers of the country, for a photo-op.

 Sourav was the show-stopper, smiled Achla. He was very excited about the outfits, added Ratna Dhanda of Provogue. We chose Sourav for the show because he is a youth icon. He represents the spirit of the youth and thats where he connects with our brand, said Ratna.

 And this may not be a one-off Provogue power play for the Prince of Calcutta. We would always want him around for our shows, added Ratna. If only these words had come from a Mr More or a Mr Chappell.

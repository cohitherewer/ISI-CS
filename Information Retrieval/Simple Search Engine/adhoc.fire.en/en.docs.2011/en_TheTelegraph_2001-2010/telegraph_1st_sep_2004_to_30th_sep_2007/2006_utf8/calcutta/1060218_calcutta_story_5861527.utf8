 Beacon cars grab eye of court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The rampant use of red beacons has caught the eye of Calcutta High Court, with a public interest litigation (PIL) being heard on Friday. The court has directed the state government to submit its policy on the use of such lights and the penal action against those violating the norms.

 From a symbol of emergency services to a beacon of special privileges, the red or amber beacon atop cars have now been reduced to a matter of common use ? and abuse.

 In June 2003, while admitting a similar PIL moved by lawyer Chamma Srivastav, the court had asked the state government to strictly follow the norms while allowing government officials to use red lights atop their cars.

 ?The norms regarding the use of beacon lights on cars should be strictly followed for the safety of general people, as well as the state,? the court had observed in its judgment in June 2003.

 The court had also directed the authorities to take strong penal measures against offenders. Unauthorised use of the red light can, on paper, draw a fine of Rs 2,000 and/or seizure of the vehicle by police.

 ?Even gangsters are taking advantage of the negligent attitude of the traffic police and escaping after committing a crime by using red lights on their cars,? Sheikh Mohamed mentioned in his petition submitted on Thursday.

 Idris Ali, counsel for the petitioner, pleaded for an order from the court directing the state government to issue a notification outlining action against violators of the red-light rules. The case comes up for hearing after three weeks.

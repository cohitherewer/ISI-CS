 Dies with daughter

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman in her mid-20s and her five-month-old daughter were burnt to death at their Canal East Road residence, in Narkeldanga, on Monday afternoon. Both died on the spot. 

 According to police, neighbours noticed smoke billowing out of the top floor of the three-storeyed building and rushed in.

 They broke open the door of a room to find the mother, identified as Salia Begum, and the baby lying on the floor.

 Preliminary investigation suggests Salia committed suicide after killing her daughter. Her husband, who is tailor, was not home.

 She doused the baby and herself in kerosene before sparking the fire.

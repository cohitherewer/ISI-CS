The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beeline for retail street

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Today: Pantaloons, Westside, Raymond, Reebok, Spykar

 Tomorrow: Pepe, Mufti, and, yes, Piramyd

 With big-ticket brands making a beeline for Camac Street, it is wresting the crown of retail street from Elgin Road. The latest in line: an 80,000 sq ft perch for Piramyd.

 Piramyd Retail, of the Piramal Group, is setting up shop opposite 22, Camac Street, next to Lady Ranu Mukherjees residence. This will be the first built-to-suit retail format to be implemented here, which means the owner/developer (the Pataka Group) will construct the mall (at 4/1A, Camac Street) under specific synergy with Piramyds requirement.

 But why Camac Street? The retail convergence happening here and the consistency in profile have combined to provide a comfort level thats critical, Mridumesh Rai, head of strategy and business development, Piramyd Retail, tells Metro.

 The group will start with a 45,000-sq-ft megastore and then either bring our own formats or do something complementary in the rest of the space. It has three formats Piramyd, the garment-based anchor, Tru-Mart, the grocery-based supermarket/neighbourhood store, and Jammin, an entertainment and playzone model. The design-solution template will be by UK-based Stephen Zachary.

 Competition on Camac Street sees opportunity rather than threat. It adds to the retail environment and enriches the spread for the customer, says Kishore Biyani, of Pantaloon Retail.

 The shop-stop story that was started by Vardaan Market is now a blockbuster. Camac Street, which was an office zone, is now an upmarket retail stop, says Abhijit Das, of Trammell Crow Meghraj, property consultants handling the Piramyd account.

 Property prices have escalated five-fold and rentals doubled over the past two years. After Forum came up, the nerve centre seemed to be moving to Elgin Road, but has now shifted back to Camac Street, feels Vijay Dugar, franchisee of the Reebok store on Camac Street.

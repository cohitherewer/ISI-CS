 He has laid out the lavish spread at the Mittals wedding extravaganza in the Palace of Versailles and served his distinctive delicacies to the likes of Michael Jackson and Kumaramangalam Birla.

 This festive season, you can light up your own party with Munna Maharaj signature sweets and savouries, like Malai Pista Gilori, Badam Dhalwa, Kiwi-flavoured Jalebis and his mouth-watering Stuffed Tikkis.

 The home-grown catering king (alias Dipak Kumar Singh) is making his maiden retail foray, launching his own food court chain, which also houses a shop-in-shop sweets parlour, Munna Sweets.

 The 10,000-sq-ft pure vegetarian Munnas FF (Food First) is slated to open its doors at 5, Camac Street before the Pujas, serving a fusion fare of sweets, chaats and multi-cuisine fast-food combos, with an interactive kitchen and a banqueting facility in the basement.

 This is my gift to the city, which has given me everything. The food court will showcase all my speciality items, Munna Maharaj tells Metro. 

 Being set up in partnership with the owners of Computer Point, which existed on the same premises, the Camac Street outlet will be the flagship store in the chain.

 We hope to launch another four Munnas FF outlets in the next 12 months, declares brother Sanjay Singh, anchoring logistics and commerce of the retail venture. 

 Kankurgachhi, Lake Town, Southern Avenue and Bhowanipore are some of the areas on the radar.

 Munna Sweets, with the hallowed halwais trademark Gur Sitabhog Cakes and Fruit-pulp Jalebis, will be the top draw at the food court.

 While even the ice-cream flavours will be in-house, Munnas FF will serve continental fast food like pizzas and pastas, pancakes, burgers and sizzlers, Italian platters and bakery products from the groups Bakers Square chain.

 There will be special sprouted chaats, Gujarati Tava Chaats and Potato Tokri Chaats, besides our speciality Laba Grilled Kebabs, says Sanjay Singh. 

 The 150-seater fast-food restaurant, with an all-seating section on the first floor overlooking Camac Street, will also serve South Indian dishes and North Indian mini-meals.

 We have imported each and every piece of our kitchen equipment and fittings, including the utensils and seating systems. We plan to bring all the chatpata roadside food so popular in Calcutta under one roof, prepared in a hygienic ambience and served in air-conditioned comfort, says Munna Maharaj.

 The food court also plans to evolve the concept of dabba food to serve the high-footfall office crowd in the locality. It will pack lunches in imported plastic containers and deliver at offices against a minimum deposit. The basement offers banqueting for around 250 people, with the option to transform the place into a disco or party lounge.

 High court insists on angel twirl

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Monday made it clear to the authorities of Victoria Memorial Hall and the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) that the angel perched atop the Memorial dome ?must rotate again?.

 The bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice Aniruddha Basu, while hearing the petition, appreciated the effort of Subhas Dutta, who has written to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, seeking his government?s help to repair the angel.

 ?Please let us know about the response to the letter. We, too, are waiting for the reply,? the judges said. ?The Memorial authorities and ASI will have to work in a cohesive manner with experts to address the problems relating to the angel,? the bench observed.

 The court asked the Memorial authorities to complete the erection of a scaffolding to reach the top of the dome to assess by February 20 the extent of the damage to the ball bearings under the angel.

 ?From February 20, the ASI will undertake work to remove the stone slabs from the site, so as to facilitate easy access to the spot,? the court order stated.

 The bench said it would monitor the progress of the repair work. The first report will have to be submitted on March 2.

 Dutta, petitioner of the case relating to the development of the Memorial and its surrounding area, alleged before the court on Monday that the authorities had not made enough effort to set the angel in motion once again.

 ?The angel stopped rotating in 1985. But the Memorial authorities sought expert opinion in 1999. For 14 years, no step was taken by the Memorial,? he alleged.

 He told the court that even after several court orders, the authorities were not taking the matter seriously. ?The recent report by technical expert M.K. Bhattacharjee, which he submitted before your lordship, prompted me to seek the assistance of the British government in the repair job,? Dutta explained.

 On January 28, Dutta wrote to Blair, saying the available infrastructure and expertise was not sufficient to make the angel rotate again. ?I, therefore, request you to kindly explore the possibilities of extending necessary expertise to overcome the problem.? 

 Bhattacharjee, a retired engineer of Jessop Company, engaged by the Memorial authorities to repair the angel, said in his report that replacement of special non-standard bronze bearings, set at the base of angel and which are difficult to procure, would be necessary to make the angel rotate again.

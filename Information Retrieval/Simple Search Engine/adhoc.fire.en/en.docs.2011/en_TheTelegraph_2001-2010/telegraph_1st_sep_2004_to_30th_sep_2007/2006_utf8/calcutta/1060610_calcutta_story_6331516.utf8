What: 

 Grooming Minds Summer Workshop 2006. 

 Where: NIFD (now INIFD) 

 campus on Lindsay Street.

 When: June 8 to 10.

 Take a look: The three-day workshop had students from the institute as well as other schools and colleges picking up tips and information on diverse aspects of fashion and lifestyle. The interactive sessions with a host of professionals highlighted modular kitchen designing, jewellery designing, make-up, fashion photography, personality development, tie-and-dye and batik.

 On Thursday, Anand Gupta from Decofur shared his views on the advantages of a modular kitchen and the current trend and styles. In a modular kitchen, the slab, partitions, etc, are thinner than in traditional kitchens. This helps save space, said Anand. 

 Jewellery designer Varda Goenka presided over the jewellery designing session. While talking about trends, Varda remarked on the fashion focus shifting from chandelier earrings to broad neckpieces and extensive wristlets. 

 Varda also shared tips on jewellery maintenance: Any chemical is harmful for gold. Use warm water, a mild soap and brush to clean gold ornaments.

 Friday morning saw a packed venue with make-up artiste Abhijit Chanda passing on useful tips and showcasing regular and bridal looks. Most youngsters today know about the ingredients for a perfect make-up, but are unsure about how to go about applying them. Such workshops give them the necessary information, said Abhijit.

 This was followed by a session with fashion photographer Swarup Dutta. A personality development session and a tie-and-dye and batik demonstration conducted by the students are lined up for Saturday.

 Voiceover: Such workshops 

 are great value-adds for students. They get to speak to 

 various fashion professionals who have excelled in the industry. 

 The visual demonstrations are of great help, too, 

 said Ruth Patchiah, regional head, INIFD.

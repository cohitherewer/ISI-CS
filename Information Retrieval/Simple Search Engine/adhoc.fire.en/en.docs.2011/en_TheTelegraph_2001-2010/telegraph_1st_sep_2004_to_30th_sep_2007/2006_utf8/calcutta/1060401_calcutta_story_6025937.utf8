The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops lax in reining in power thieves

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The move to curb power theft and track down the thieves has fallen through, as only a handful of the large number of offenders has been convicted. 

 According to CESC, FIRs had been lodged against 12,000 people for hooking and tapping power connections in the CESC area. So far, only 10 persons have been convicted.

 The CESC officials blamed the police for not taking the matter seriously. 

 ?The situation is not only surprising but alarming, too. If steps are not taken immediately and the offenders are not punished, power theft cannot be checked. We have urged the government to take the matter seriously,?? CESC executive director Santanu Chatterjee told Metro.

 He alleged: ?We file FIRs against these thefts but the police do not refer the cases to the magistrate and if some of the offenders are sent to court, the cases remain unsettled for years, thereby nullifying our efforts.?

 ?Provision for setting up special courts was made in the Indian Electricity (West Bengal Amendment) Act, 2001, for disposal of the power theft cases, which was also supported by the Central Electricity Rules, 2003. The cases, which were pending at different magistrates? courts, were not transferred to the special courts. Not a single offender has been convicted in these courts,? Chatterjee said.

 He added: ?We have written to the Calcutta Police commissioner and the director-general of police for deploying the force to track down illegal connections. We have also petitioned law minister Nisith Adhikari and power minister Mrinal Banerjee, so that the pending cases are shifted to the special courts.??

 According to CESC officers, raids are conducted on the basis of complaints of hooking or tapping, but only in some cases does the police accompany the team. 

 Joint commissioner of police Kuldiep Singh denied the charge. ?We don?t have enough men to assist the CESC people. Still, whenever possible, we send a force to track down illegal hooking.?

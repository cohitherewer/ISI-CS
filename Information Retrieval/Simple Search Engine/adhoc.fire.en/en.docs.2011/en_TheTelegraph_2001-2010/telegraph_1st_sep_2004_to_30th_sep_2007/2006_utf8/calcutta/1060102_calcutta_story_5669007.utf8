 The sight of a young man weeping on stage and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha patting him on the back left many a moist eye in the audience. And yet, the story of Bapi Samanta was one of success. The poor farmer?s son from Tamluk is a year-and-a-half away from getting a degree in medicine.

 His was just one of the examples of perseverance against all odds that marked the Dr Moni Bhaumik Educational Foundation Annual Scholarship Awards on Sunday morning, where Somnath Chatterjee was the chief guest. 

 ?My father wanted his children to pass Madhyamik. But after that, I was expected to help him in the fields,? recalled Bapi. ?He would hit me for pursuing higher education. The books I had were 20 years old. There were times when I didn?t even have a decent meal a day.?

 Armed with a high HS score, he went to pursue chemistry honours at Ramakrishna Mission Narendrapur, but had to leave for lack of funds. He became a van driver, giving chemistry tuitions at night. Bapi later joined a tech course in Jadavpur University, where a professor urged him to sit for JEE to fulfil his dream of becoming a doctor. A scholarship from the foundation has helped the NRS student come thus far.

 ?The key to success is hard work. And never giving up,? stressed Dr Moni Lal Bhaumik. ?We started with Bapi and nine other students in 2001. Now, we support 80 students, including the 13 we awarded today. The foundation will henceforth include postgraduate students, and from next year, scholarships in music and sports will also be awarded,? he said, adding that a residential campus would soon come up. 

 The foundation has asked the government for a plot, where a library, reading room, IT hall and hostels will be built for the students to stay. 

 Among the youngsters who stood tall on stage while collecting their scholarships from Chatterjee was Mousumi Modak, a second-year student of National Medical College. The 18-year-old from Gotpara village, in Nadia, used her older siblings? books to study, and often requested teachers to give her free tuitions. ?My parents are very proud,? smiled the daughter of a foodgrain seller.

 Prabir Maji from Midnapore West summed up: ?There are difficult times, but you just have to deal with them.?

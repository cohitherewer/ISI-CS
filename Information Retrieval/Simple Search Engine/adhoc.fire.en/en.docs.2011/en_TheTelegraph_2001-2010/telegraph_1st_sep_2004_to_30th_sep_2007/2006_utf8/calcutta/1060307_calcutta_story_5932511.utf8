 Bringing together an impressive collection of paintings and sculptures in a magnificent display of varied forms and colours, the ongoing exhibition is an exposition that recommends itself to the viewing pleasure of all lovers of the visual arts. Mainly featuring works of talented young painters and sculptors, the show provides an insight into the contemporary creative mind and modern artists? perception of the world around them. With unity in design and structure, the sculptures of Sujit Kumar Karan have an element of realism that distinguishes his style from that of Subrata Biswas, whose works are born of his romantic fantasy. Nevertheless, works of both sculptors have a soft, rhythmic quality about them. Soumen Das? sculptures reveal his angst against the perfunctory nature of human life. Among the painters, Arunabha Ghosh depicts his fondness for the familiar, everyday activities of life, whereas Pulak Kumar Das presents an artistic vision that focuses on its darker, shadowy aspects. The paintings of Bijoy Basak and Pappu Bardhan are figments of the artists? subconscious stream of thoughts, reflecting their attempts at coming to terms with the contradictions of the real world. Also featuring the works of veteran artist Partha Pratim Deb (one of his paintings appears above).

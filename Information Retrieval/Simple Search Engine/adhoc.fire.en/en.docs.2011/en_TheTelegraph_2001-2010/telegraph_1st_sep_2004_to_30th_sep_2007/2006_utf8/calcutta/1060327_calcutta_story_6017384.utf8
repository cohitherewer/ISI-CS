 Practising with fake marksheets

 - Police identify nine lawyers with forged papers

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 After investigating the fake marksheet racket for one-and-a-half years, the police have finally identified nine lawyers practising in Calcutta High Court with fake Ll.B marksheets.

 Officers of the anti-fraud section of the detective department, who have been investigating the case, claimed to have collected all documents against the nine. There are complaints against 200-plus lawyers practising with fake marksheets in several courts in the city.

 ?While investigating the fake marksheet racket, we have found all evidence against nine lawyers practising with fake Ll.B marksheets. Investigation is on in the other cases. Raids will soon be conducted to arrest them,? Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said on Sunday.

 The racket came to light following the arrest of two men in central Calcutta in 2004 by the officers of Jorasanko police station. 

 A criminal case (case no. 13) was lodged against them after a large number of fake marksheets of some colleges and universities in Bihar and Jharkhand were seized during the raid.

 The detective department took up investigation in 2005 and alerted the West Bengal Bar Council.

 The sleuths came to know that the two men were kingpins and had been operating the racket from the city through their agents in those colleges and universities.

 During interrogation, they admitted to having issued fake Ll.B marksheets to several individuals in the city, most of whom are practising in various courts, including the high court.

 ?A police team raided several places in Bihar and Ranchi, now in Jharkhand, and arrested people involved in the racket. Criminal cases have been initiated against some university employees. We got to know that a large number of people possessing fake Ll.B marksheets are practising in some of the city courts. A list was prepared and we started collecting evidence against them,? an officer of the anti-fraud section said.

 Officers of the West Bengal Bar Council claim that police are yet to provide them with a list of the lawyers practising with fake marksheets.?Why are they (police) not arresting the nine lawyers they have identified?? asked Uttam Majumdar, vice-chairman, West Bengal Bar Council. 

 ?We have started verifying the marksheets and certificates of candidates applying for registration,? said another member of the council.

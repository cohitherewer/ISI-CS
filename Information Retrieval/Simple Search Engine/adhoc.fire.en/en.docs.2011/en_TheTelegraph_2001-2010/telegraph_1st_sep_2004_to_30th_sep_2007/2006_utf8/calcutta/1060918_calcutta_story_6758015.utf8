 Runway rebuild by March

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The much-awaited extension of the secondary runway of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport will be complete by March 2007. 

 The extended runway will take the load off the primary runway and end air traffic congestion at the airport. This is part of the Airports Authority of Indias (AAI) modernisation plan for the airport.

 The re-strengthening, resurfacing and extension work will start simultaneously by the month-end, a senior airport officer said on Sunday. The plan was to start work earlier, but it could not be done owing to the rains, he added.

 The primary runway is 3,627 m long, while the secondary runway is 2,399 m. The length of the second runway will be increased by 440 m on the northern side. Once accomplished, bigger and heavier aircraft can land on it. Now, the Airbus 320 or Boeing 737-200 series can land on the secondary runway. Once the runway is extended, Airbus 300 too can land on it, the official said. 

 Thereafter, installation of the Instrumental Landing System (ILS)-Category I is planned at the secondary runway. The primary runway already has the ILS Cat-I facility and this will be upgraded to Cat-II this winter. Once the ILS is installed, the secondary runway can be used for landing at night or in bad weather, when visibility is poor, an officer said.

 Now, the visual range of landing for an aircraft on the secondary runway is 3,000 m. This will be brought down to 550 m when CAT-I is installed. With the rise in the number of flights, aircraft often have to wait in the approach area in the sky. So, often departure, too, is delayed, said the officer. With the extension of the secondary runway and ILS installation, this can be used for handling more aircraft.

 In cases of lights-out at the primary runway caused by a snag, evening flights have to be held up. But once ILS is installed, the secondary strip can be operated as an alternative. 

 After the state government abandoned efforts to relocate the mosque at the runway end, the AAI worked out an alternative plan. A 632-m stretch is available between the runway edge and a mosque, and a survey showed the former could be increased by another 440 m.

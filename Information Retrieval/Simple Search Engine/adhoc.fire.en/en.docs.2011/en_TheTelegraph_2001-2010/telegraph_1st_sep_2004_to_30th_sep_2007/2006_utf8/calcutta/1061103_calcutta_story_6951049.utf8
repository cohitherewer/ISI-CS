 The report Drop dandiya, lets 

 disco, October 4, made for disturbing reading. Youngsters 

 now prefer to do a Bipasha Basu belly dance and a shirtless 

 Sourav (on the Lords balcony) instead of join a traditional 

 dandiya. Such is the state of affairs with Western culture 

 making inroads into India. Without intervention of the authorities, 

 our traditions will soon become extinct. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Apropos the report Star goes drip, drip on CM, October 13, it is a pity that the chief ministers recitation could not plug the leaking roof of Star theatre. This incident underscores the mismanagement by the authorities of the hall. The excuse offered by the mayor is unconvincing to say the least. One wonders how the culturally-oriented chief minister allowed the government to lease out the historic hall to a private organisation. Maybe hes too busy attracting foreign investment to worry much about halls.

 The drenched floor 

 of Star theatre 

 Blaming the civic body or Priya 

 Entertainment for the fiasco at Star theatre is useless. 

 The root cause of the leakage must be found out and the 

 problem addressed so that the public can visit the prestigious 

 hall. It is quite embarrassing that dripping water marred 

 a programme attended by the chief minister. Having been 

 discomfited by a few drops of water, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

 might now understand the plight of office-goers on flooded 

 roads.

 Differing fortunes: 

 Rani Rashmonis house after the collapse. (Below) A 

 heritage house well-maintained by its German inhabitants.

 Apropos the report Trapped in heritage cave-in, October 5, it is unfortunate that Rani Rashmonis house in Janbazar has collapsed. The Rani was a noble and brave woman. She established the Dakshineshwar temple, which is one of Calcuttas prides. But we have failed to maintain her house. Are the authorities only there to confer heritage status on buildings? Is not the duty of the civic body and the government to ensure that such addresses are maintained properly? 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 There are hundreds of heritage 

 buildings in the city. The Janbazar Thakurdalan is one of 

 the more important ones. It is said that Ramakrishna Paramhansa 

 had visited the house several times. The collapse of such 

 a house is shocking. The mayors explanation of shortage 

 of funds is pathetic. The state government and civic body 

 must join hands and restore this historic building to its 

 original state. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 The safety of human lives should 

 not be ignored in the name of heritage. The authority should 

 ensure that even heritage buildings are safe enough to be 

 lived in. Those which are not, should be evacuated. The 

 report How to live in and let live a legacy, October 5, 

 shows how a heritage property on Raja Santosh Road was turned 

 into a beautiful residence by a German diplomat. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly

 The report Belated flurry over varsity entry rules, October 5, stating that Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University will soon get the IIT status, will gladden many students from the state. They will no longer need to leave the state for quality technical education. It is expected that all the IITs in the country should be guided by a uniform set of rules and policies to maintain their excellence. The state government should clear the passage for the upgrade of the institution, which would also ensure greater financial assistance from the Centre.

 Apropos the interview Gandhism is serious business, October 10, Jahnu Barua might be a gifted filmmaker with many national and international awards, but his Maine Gandhi Ko Nahi Mara didnt create an impact at the box office. Nor was it made for box office success. Lage Raho Munnabhai, in comparison, dealt with a similar theme in a lighthearted manner and became immensely popular. 

 Amit V Sengupta,

 Dum Dum 

 The rise in dengue toll in the city and spread of the infection is cause for concern (City south found dengue-prone, October 6). The assurance of the civic bosses that there is no need for panic is hardly reassuring. Preventive measures against mosquito-borne diseases have virtually disappeared. The leniency of the civic authorities towards people who are allowing water to accumulate on their properties is sending the wrong signals. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 It is nice to learn that Lagaan is enjoying a revival of popularity (Screen on amp; off, October 13). Although India produces the highest number of films in a year, the Oscars have eluded the country. Talented Indian film-makers should make more socially relevant films.

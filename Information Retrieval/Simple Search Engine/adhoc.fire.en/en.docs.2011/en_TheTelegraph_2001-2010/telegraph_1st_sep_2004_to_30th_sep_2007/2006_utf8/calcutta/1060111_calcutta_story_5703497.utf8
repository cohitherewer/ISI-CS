 The A Cappella form of music is a centuries-old art form that uses only voice to simulate a wide range of musical instruments and unique sounds, creating a rich, harmonious and melodious blend. Founded in 1996 by six freshmen of the University of Pennsylvania, PennMasala is an all-vocal band specialising in this form of music. Having evolved consistently over a period of time, the group has already cut four albums (Awaaz, 11 PM, Soundcheck and the latest, The Brown Album) with 12 original compositions, also producing a music video of their own. Chamak challo, their hugely popular video, was listed among the top 10 singles of a leading music channel in 1999. Enjoying a tremendous fan-following among the music-loving youth of today, this evening?s live performance by international musical phenomenon PennMasala, featuring some of the band?s most memorable hits, promises to be a runaway success. Presented by Hutch.

 Energy from garbage on the agenda

 Diptimoy Ghosh: The century-old method of dumping garbage has become an eyesore in east Calcutta, which is turning into the new growth hub of the city. Dhapa is nothing but a huge vat.

 I admit that Dhapa is a 19th Century landfill site. The CMC has prepared a thorough overhaul of the garbage dumping system under its Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, funded by the Asian Development Bank. 

 The CMC has its own programme, too. We have set up a sanitary landfill site and decided to generate energy from garbage. It is a colossal waste of potential energy to use thousands of tonnes of garbage daily only for landfill.

 Many models are available globally to generate power and produce manure from garbage. We are engaging a consultant to choose a proper and effective technology. A global tender will be floated in a month or two for the purpose. I can tell you that the solid waste management scenario will get a radical upgrade.

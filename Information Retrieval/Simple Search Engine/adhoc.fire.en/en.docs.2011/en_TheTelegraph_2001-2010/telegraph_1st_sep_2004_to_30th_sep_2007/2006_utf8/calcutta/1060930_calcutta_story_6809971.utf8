 Masks of deception

 Exposing the hypocrisy, insecurity and selfish, motive-driven psychology of the so-called educated, liberated upper class, Mukhosh Nritya makes an ironical comment on their lofty claims to reform and uplift society. The play unfolds the variegated life stories of three college friends, who meet after many years. Now middle-aged and well settled in their respective lives, they belong to the upper echelons of society. Riya is a housewife who spends her days in idle, self-centred activities, concerned only with her own beauty, leisure and entertainment. Manisha is a feminist and social activist, bearing the mighty burden of womens emancipation on her shoulders. Tapashi is the typical housewife whose life revolves completely around her husband and children. She has lost her own identity and is now a shadow of her former self, echoing the opinions of her successful husband. Having attained the peak of personal success and happiness, the friends conversation focuses on apparently responsible social issues. Yet, it gradually becomes clear that they are concealing their true selves from one another. Sophisticated and modern only in outward appearance, they are actually superstitious, insular and narrow-minded, unlike Bakul, a young maid-servant, who is trying to overcome social shackles. Direction: Seema Mukhopadhyay.

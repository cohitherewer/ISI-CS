 Modern trends in art, as in life, express a deliberate aversion to the well-traversed and time-tested paths followed by our predecessors. Pratham Paath tells a story that make us conscious of the need to respect our traditions and reconnect with our past. Sanatan Paul and his son Bhuvan are old, veteran artisans of Kumartuli who have devoted their entire lives to building images of Goddess Durga. Bhuvan?s son, Pritam, is a young artist who is of the opinion that such artisans are mere workmen and that they lack creativity. His belief, however, is not based on a contempt of the past. Rather, he is against the monotonous and repetitive nature of art practised by contemporary artisans. As the Pujas draw near, he is flooded with orders to make idols. He feels lost when asked to make an image of classical design. His grandfather Sanatan comes to his rescue by teaching him the fundamentals of the craft. Thus, Pritam is finally reconciled with his illustrious aesthetic heritage. Drama and direction: Romaprasad Banik.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?Nobody has found me yet?

 She has the best figure, the hottest co-stars and the biggest films of the year. Reason enough for Pratim D. Gupta to catch up with PRIYANKA CHOPRA on her turf

 Priyanka Chopra with Abhishek Bachchan in Bluffmaster!

 You are being touted as the big star of 2006 with releases like Don, Krrish and Salaam-e-Ishq. How do you look at things?

 I am, of course, looking forward to the year. May it be the biggest year for me if not anything else. I really don?t know about this number game? Who is at number one and who is at number two. I just hope and pray that all my films do well.

 There are tremendous expectations from Krrish?

 I know. I just finished shooting for the film and it should release sometime in June. There?s a lot of hype around the movie. Sometimes it really gets nerve-racking when people keep talking and asking about how the film is going to turn out. I sport a very different look for Krrish, something I have not been seen in. I have seen the rushes of the movie and have really loved it. I just hope people believe what I believe about Krrish.

 You are slated to start shooting for Don soon. Are there any apprehensions of shooting with the one and only Shah Rukh Khan?

 We recently shot together for a Pepsi commercial and it was great working with him. Shah Rukh has been someone I have always admired. I have toured around the world with him for the Temptations series of concerts. Knowing him personally is very different from working with him, though. So, I am looking forward to shooting for Don with him. I myself have a very strong character in the film.

 You recently featured opposite Abhishek Bachchan in Bluffmaster! and people have been raving about the two of you?

 Abhishek and I came together for the first time in Bluffmaster!. In fact, I was working with most people in the film for the first time. But by the time the film ended we had all become great friends and we had some great memories. Abhishek is really fun-going and he is also a very good actor.

 You have worked with Shah Rukh, Salman, Hrithik and Abhishek. Who would you rate as your favourite co-star?

 (Laughs) I just can?t take a pick like that. They are all very different people and also very different as actors. And I have very different relationships with each of them. I am just glad that I am getting to work with all of them.

 lAnd what about your chemistry with Kareena in the new Pepsi commercial?

 Oh! It was great fun, full of woman power. It?s like this whole Charlie?s Angels thing with different get-up and all. Kareena is a friend off the screen? We had got along very well during the Aitraaz shooting. So we all had a very nice experience.

 What was it like, judging a talent hunt show like Indian Idol?

 I did it last year, too. I think these participants deserve lots of kudos to overcome all the fears and keep singing so well week after week. I wouldn?t have been able to take part in such a high-pressure contest. And to come in the Top 10 in a show like this is really creditable.

 You are known to be a very good singer yourself...

 Singing has always been my first love. People keep approaching me to cut private albums and sing in my movies. I would surely do it on a big scale once I am ready to do so.

 How does it feel to be hailed as the ?best figure? in Bollywood?

 (Laughs) That?s nice. You know what, I don?t work out at all. I am a very lazy person and I completely hate the gym. I can?t handle exercise at all. My kind of holiday would be to just lie down and watch movies. It?s also not that I don?t eat much. I am a full Punjabi, in total love with my food. I have to have my chicken and my butter. My mom believes that since I am just 23, I have a very high metabolism but I have to hit the gym once I am 25.

 What were you doing at Baba Ramdev?s?

 Oh! I had heard such great things about him and his therapy that I just went and met him. It?s not that I am going to subscribe to his therapy but then again I may just give it a try.

 What other movies have you signed?

 Apart from Don, Krrish and Salaam-e-Ishq, I have Rumi Jaffery?s God Tussi Great Ho with Salman and Dharmesh Darshan?s Aap Ki Khatir with Akshaye Khanna. 

 Despite having such great on-screen partners why are you still single off-screen?

 That?s something I am not glad about. Nobody has found me yet, I guess.

 Nobody?s found you or you haven?t found anybody?

 (Laughs) Well, I can?t be with just about anybody. Yes, you can say, I haven?t found the right person.

 Probe into fake orders

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Concerned over a series of fake high court orders, Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar has asked the criminal investigation department (CID), as well as the detective department of city police, to probe the forgeries.

 ?Over the past two years, at least seven such cases have been detected where the signatures of different judges and the high court seal were forged to produce fake orders. The high court administration has asked investigating agencies to identify the culprits as soon as possible, arrest them and file a compliance report,? said a senior CID officer.

 Only a week ago, six dacoits of Suri, in Birbhum, tried to obtain bail from a local court by producing a fake high court order. A Suri magistrate dealing with the case found some irregularities in the order and sent it to the high court. 

 Justice A.K. Basu of the high court asked the magistrate, as well as the CID, to hold separate inquiries into the matter. 

 A few months ago, Justice S.K. Mukherjee of the high court called the CID to probe a case in which a farmer had forged not only an order but also the assistant registrar?s stamp and seal. 

 The farmer had produced a fake high court order before a bank to avoid repaying a loan taken to buy a tractor.

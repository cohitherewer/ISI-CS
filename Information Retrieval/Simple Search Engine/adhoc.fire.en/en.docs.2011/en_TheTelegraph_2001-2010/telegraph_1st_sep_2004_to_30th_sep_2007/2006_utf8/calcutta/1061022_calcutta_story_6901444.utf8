The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Murti

 Derived from the word doors, Dooars forms the gateway to 

 the tourist attractions of north Bengal. The 40-km-wide 

 valley stretches across 130 km. Nature here is mostly unspoilt 

 and bountiful. 

 As soon as you leave the town of Siliguri and its periphery, you will find yourself in the midst of sweeping valleys, long avenues of trees, verdant woodlands and velvet green tea gardens.

 The sylvan serenity of virgin forests and tea estates is punctuated by rivers like the gushing Teesta and tributaries like the Liss, Ghis, Diana, Rethi and Murti. Taking birth in the Terai, these streams frolic down vast caverns and chasms to merrily gurgle through the picturesque valley.

 Breeze along National Highway 31 past Malbazar to Chalsa, 57 km from Siliguri, before turning right to reach Murti, via Batabari.

 There is a beautiful forest bungalow on the banks of the Murti with furnished rooms. Adjacent to the bungalow is a well-maintained flower garden.

 Dawn breaks here amid the twittering of birds flying towards Terai from Gorumara National Park, which is close to the bungalow.

 If you have an interest in photography, keep your camera handy to capture elephants emerging from the foliage of Gorumara to cross the river and reach Dhupjora village in quest of paddy and other crops. The villagers burst crackers to ward off the pachyderms. It is a scene you are unlikely to forget in a hurry.

 Sit down with a cup of tea, preferably from the region, to enjoy dusk in the Dooars. The setting sun turns the horizon into molten gold as twilight descends over the green haven.

 At night, the forest assumes a 

 magical quality. The calls of nocturnal birds pierce the 

 eerie silence every now and then. The smell of the soil 

 mixes with that of the blossoms to create a heady concoction 

 as crickets conduct an orchestra.

 Going 

 Murti is two hours by bus or hired 

 car, via Chalsa, from Dooars bus stand in Siliguri. Alipurduar-bound 

 buses will take you to Chalsa junction, from where you can 

 hire cars or rickshaw to Batabari, which is about a km from 

 Murti. It is also possible to reach Murti via Jalpaiguri 

 and Lataguri. If you prefer rail, get off at Chalsa station 

 on the Siliguri-Alipurduar line.

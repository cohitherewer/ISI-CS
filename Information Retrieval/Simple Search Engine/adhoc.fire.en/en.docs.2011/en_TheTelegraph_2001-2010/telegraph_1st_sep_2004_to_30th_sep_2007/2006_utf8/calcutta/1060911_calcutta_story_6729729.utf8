The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You just wont settle for second best. You have 

 terrific people skills and you prefer jobs that keep you 

 in the background, You are a strong advocate of truth and 

 work ethics. Your controlled but gentle spirit helps you 

 make the most of opportunities without alienating competitors 

 You assert yourself positively when in the face of resistance. 

 Kusum Bhandari

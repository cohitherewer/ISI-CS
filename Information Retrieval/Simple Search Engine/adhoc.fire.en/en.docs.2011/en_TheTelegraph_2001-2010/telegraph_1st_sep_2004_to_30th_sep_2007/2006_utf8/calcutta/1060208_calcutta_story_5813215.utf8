 The experience of viewing A. Ramachandran?s works after a gap of over 10 years in this city was as exciting as watching nature renew and regenerate itself every spring.

 The exhibition of his large panels, canvases, watercolours and drawings, organised by Vadhera Art Gallery, now on at Birla Academy of Art and Culture, proves again that although the Santiniketan-trained artist has employed for years the same stock of images, such as the voluptuous Bhil woman, trees and plants in full bloom, and birds, beasts and insects who thrive on this lushness, he rarely repeats himself.

 He achieves this by virtue of his very strong imagery, that was also the hallmark of his work in his earlier, troubled years. He handles his brush so deftly that anything he draws comes alive. Almost by magic, he conjures up the secret life in a lake covered with lotuses, both by moon and sunlight. Besides the flocks of waterfowl, there are the predatory owls swooping down on frogs that quickly seek cover.

 It could be out of A Midsummer Night?s Dream but it also could have been imagined by the Sanskrit poets. Ramachandran?s depiction of nature has the same luxuriance that leaves one with a feeling of satiation. His eye for detail is tremendous. Be it the jewel-like coat of a beetle, the feathers of a duck or petals concealed in a tight bud, he never goes wrong.

 This is a far cry from his angst-ridden youth, when his imagery was equally strong but his vision was dark and ominous. In old age, he seems to enjoy giving full rein to sensuous pleasures, if only through the medium of his art.

 The scale of his works, too, leaves one gasping. The forest of lotus blooms covers several large panels and the Bhil women are life-size. 

 So, when one is confronted with the ?first drop of monsoon? conceived as an unclothed maiden covering her shame on a lotus leaf, it is a rare visual treat.

 The most endearing quality of Ramachandran?s works is that in almost every painting, the artist puts in an appearance. Sometimes he is metamorphosed as Vishnu, sometimes as the rain god painting the droplets that add up to a shower, or else as a fish or a bird sitting quietly in one corner, or perhaps as a baby in the foetal position. Like Ariel, he is in full control of his creation. But he has the humility to make a mockery of himself and his art.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mixed fare in air, on ground

 Airports must now learn to serve not just expensive coffee and cakes but also chai and pakoras

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 On this foggy morning, Dum Dum felt different. As I entered the airport, for a moment I was taken aback. Passengers of delayed flights huddled everywhere. But the luggages were different, the attires were more democratic. There was a palpable excitement about the impending air travel. For a moment I thought this was the crowd flying to the Northeast. The subsidised fares on this route often brought in the passenger who otherwise would have felt more comfortable taking a train. Then, one of the airlines announced boarding for their delayed flight. The destination was another metro. A sizeable portion of this crowd melted into the waiting buses.

 Delayed flights in winter are common enough occurrences. Stranded passengers usually crowd the restaurant. Some queue in front of the coffee kiosk. Others discuss the sad state of affairs in the civil aviation sector in particular or the country in general. The language would inevitably be English. Flying was always a privilege of the elite.

 That morning, that ambience was missing. Come to think of it, a change was anticipated. Unfortunately, plans drawn-up focussed on capacity expansion. What had not been taken cognisance of is that apart from increasing numbers there would be a qualitative change as well. Check fares and no-frill prices would bring in an entirely new segment of consumers for the airports in India.

 Airports possibly have an international blueprint for their facility planning. With minor alterations, it works in most countries. So far it worked well in India too, except that there was too little of it. And the character of the facilities suited the upmarket Indian air traveller who in any case aspired to be like his London or Chicago counterpart.

 It is true that in the West also, there are cheap airlines that bring in the less affluent consumers to the airports. The advantage they have is in their homogeneity. The very rich anyway go into airline lounges to enjoy their caviar and champagne. The rest tend to behave in a manner that rarely divulges their income disparity.

 The dispersion in India on all these parameters is huge. Airlines are already being positioned for the different segments. The moot point is whether airports will be. The problem is that airport service is part of the airlines service package but they have very little control over it. A major reason is that services far more crucial than passenger comfort, like safety, security and aircraft handling are bundled together in an airport. Airports earn their revenue also from the passengers but indirectly through the airlines. So they may not perceive any direct obligation to the fliers. In this lies the germ of a marketing crisis.

 Would the airports care enough to recognise the new consumer? More importantly would they continue to pamper the old ones? For, The Taj and The Oberoi will have to continue selling their expensive coffee and cakes for the elite. But the other consumer will also raise his hand. Not only must pakora and chai be made available, they must sell at affordable prices. Drinking water must be plentiful. Days may not be far off when air passengers to Bangalore get off the bus in Birati and feel very thirsty by the time they reach the terminal building. Obviously, the model of a Schipol or a JFK will be of little help. The challenge will be to come up with a solution that is very possibly unique in the world.

 Indian aviation industry will soon need to manage the diverse worlds of toilet paper and the lota. No mean task that.

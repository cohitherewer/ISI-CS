The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diwali snuffed out

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Somnath Das: Last homecoming

 Once every year, 37-year-old Somnath Das, whose job had taken him to Mumbai 11 years ago, would visit Calcutta to spend a few days with his parents at their Akrur Dutta Lane address. The Diwali vacations used to brighten up the festivities for his parents.

 Somnath will not come home this Diwali. He was killed in Tuesday?s blast at Mumbai?s Matunga station, on his way back from office. 

 The body reached Calcutta on Wednesday night along with the body of Sumanta Dey, of Hooghly, another victim of the blasts. 

 Somnath?s mother Jayantika last spoke to him on Saturday. ?Ma, aami khub taratari Kolkatay ashar cheshta korchhi? Babar shorir kemon achhe? Tomader janye mon kharap korchhe? Tomar natni kotha bolte chay (I am trying to return to Calcutta as soon as possible? How is father? I miss you all? Your granddaughter wants to speak to you),? he had said.

 ?The line suddenly got disconnected so I could not talk to my granddaughter Shiyona,? recalled Jayantika, sitting in the Das?s two-storeyed house. 

 Her husband Pranab, in his early 70s, was in tears: ?I never thought I would have to hear the news of my son?s death. He used to visit us during Kali puja every year.? 

 Somnath completed his schooling from Don Bosco and graduation from City College. He shifted to Mumbai in January 1995. 

 ?Somnath left with his wife Mohua. He bought a flat at Anitanagar, in Kandivili, and settled there. We used to feel so proud of him? Everything is finished now,? lamented Pranab.

 He, however, did not forget to thank the Maharashtra government. ?They arranged everything, even purchasing an air ticket for my daughter-in-law. I am shocked that no one from the state government has contacted us so far,? he said.

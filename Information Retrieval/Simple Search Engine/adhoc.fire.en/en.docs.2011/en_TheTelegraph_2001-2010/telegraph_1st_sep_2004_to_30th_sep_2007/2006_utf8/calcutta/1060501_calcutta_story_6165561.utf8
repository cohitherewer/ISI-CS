 Varsity help to maintain hygiene 

 Srikumar Chatterjee: There is a food technology department in Jadavpur University (JU) and there are several NGOs working on food adulteration and food contamination. Why aren?t you taking the help of the NGOs and the university in making street food hygienic?

 The issue of making street food hygienic is being discussed with several organisations, including hawker unions. Awareness workshops on cleanliness and proper handling of food and drinking water will soon be organised for street-food vendors. We are approaching the food technology department of JU, Indian Institute of Hygiene and Public Health and the NGOs for their cooperation in this regard.

 She was blazing the big screen till recently as Duli in the re-released Aranyer Din Ratri and now, she is back on the small screen for another round of Rendezvous with Simi Garewal. With the launch episode on Sunday featuring current heartthrob John Abraham, the woman in white is again set to trek uncharted territories with her popular talk show.

 For Simi, though, it?s not about a new season; it?s more about another set of new shows. ?Well, for me, each Rendezvous episode is different because each guest is different,? she explains. ?Each personal story they tell is different. For this new season we?ve made some changes to the look of the show, the set and the packaging, but we don?t want to change the personal style that is the hallmark of Rendezvous.?

 The anchor who has had tete-a-tetes with everyone from Benazir to Bachchan, is aware that Rendezvous with Simi Garewal is no longer the only chat show on TV. ?I think each talk show differs according to the style of the interviewer,? she says. ?Vir (Sanghvi), Karan Thapar and Karan Johar have different styles, so there?s room for many talk shows, as long as they are original. There is no such thing as exclusivity or monopoly on talk shows, especially today, when the media is growing by the hour. It?s like a newspaper or a TV Channel ? there?s room for all ? the viewer chooses what appeals most to him.?

 But where Simi scores over the rest is the fact that she knows most of her guests and mingles with them socially. So, they are less prone to put on their masks on the sets even after the ?action? call. ?In fact, the people I know personally are always a little harder to interview,? she feels. ?You see, I may know some things about them which I take for granted but the viewer doesn?t. And it?s harder to get that across.?

 For the new season, though, things are a touch different. ?You?d be surprised to know that I?ve met a large percentage of my guests for the first time during our rendezvous,? Simi reveals. ?Of course, there are those I?ve known before as well but I don?t exploit our relationship.?

 Apart from Simi and what she brings to the show, the USP of Rendezvous is the presence of the better halves of the celebrity guests. ?I?ve always felt that to really get to know a person you have to meet the spouse,? explains the hostess. ?And that is why I kept this as the format of my show.?

 But unlike many of her peers, Simi is not interested in digging up celebrity gossip. ?My objective is to get to know the person in front of me,? she announces. ?How he deals with life, his experiences, what his journey has been all about, how he handles his relationships, his success and failures? Aren?t we are all looking for clues how best to handle life? Maybe I?m looking for those clues myself.?

 Having interviewed an entire gamut of people from not only showbiz but sports and politics, Simi finds it difficult to pick her favourites. ?That?s very hard to choose,? she says. ?Let?s see... The Bachchan family, Dev Anand ? Jayaji, that is Jaya Bachchan, thinks the Devsaab Rendezvous was the best ? A.R. Rahman ? especially when he played and sang on my show ? Imran Khan, Sushmita Sen? There are so many I really enjoyed.?

 So, get ready for more hushed whispers and pregnant pauses as Simi plunges into the world of the rich and famous. The next season of Rendezvous with Simi Garewal comes on STAR World every Sunday at 9.30 pm .

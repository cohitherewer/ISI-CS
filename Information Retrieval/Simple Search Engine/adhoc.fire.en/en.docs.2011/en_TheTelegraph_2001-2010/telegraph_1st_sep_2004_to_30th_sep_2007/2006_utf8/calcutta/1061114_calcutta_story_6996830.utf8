 The citys fast-food big bite just gets bigger and bigger. Coming up: 10 more KFCs, 10 to 15 more Pizza Huts and 10 Costa Coffee outlets. And all in the next 24 months.

 Overwhelmed by Calcuttas response to the Zinger Burgers and the Pepperoni Pizzas, Devyani International Limited, franchisee of Yum Restaurants International, the worlds largest chain of quick-service restaurants, has decided on a mega fun munch menu for the city.

 We are targeting at least 10 KFC outlets in Calcutta, each with an average of 100 covers, in the next two years, Ravi Jaipuria, chairman, Devyani International, told Metro on Monday. He was in town to unveil the second KFC outlet at 20K, Park Street (opposite Peter Cat), a 3,500-sq-ft restaurant seating 140 across two levels.

 Founded by Colonel Sanders in the 1930s, KFC is a part of Yum, which also owns Pizza Hut. Devyani, which plans to roll out a string of Pizza Hut outlets and introduce the Costa Coffee brand in Calcutta next year, is tying up with Kazi Management, a giant franchisee of KFC in the US, for streamlining systems and processes.

 We are looking at investing over Rs 100 crore in Calcutta in the next two to three years in fast-food and retail businesses and the joint venture with Kazi will add great value to the table,Jaipuria said.

 According to Virag Joshi, president amp; CEO, Devyani International, with average weekend footfalls of over 3,000 at the 80-seater City Centre outlet, the Park Street KFC is targeting zero waiting.

 Costa Coffee, another brand from the Yum fold, with 700 outlets across the world, will be up and running in Calcutta by June 2007.

 (After Starbucks), it is one of the largest coffee-shop chains, headquartered in the UK. The speciality is blended coffee concoctions from the finest beans. We will kick off with three or four, and then expand quickly. Logistics support from our existing Pizza Hut and KFC set-ups would help in this, Joshi pointed out.

 As part of the Devyani-Kazi alliance, the US franchisee will organise exchange programmes for staff training, and import best practices from the US, for both restaurant operations and back-end systems.

 By giving them critical inputs culled from our vast pool of resources and experience, we will make the KFC staff in India more efficient and independent. This will improve customer service and speed of delivery, said Zubair Kazi, chairman, Kazi Management, which runs more than 300 KFC outlets in the US, Fiji, Hawaii and Samoa.

 From placing the order to be served on the table would take just two minutes, promised Kazi, who has been working with KFC since 1969, and felt the Park Street restaurant was on a par with any of the chains American outlets. KFC is the worlds biggest quick-service chicken restaurant chain with over 12,300 restaurants in more than 80 countries.

 The Park Street KFC where Avishkar used to be will remain open from 11 am to 11 pm and provide quot;limited parking space quot; in front.

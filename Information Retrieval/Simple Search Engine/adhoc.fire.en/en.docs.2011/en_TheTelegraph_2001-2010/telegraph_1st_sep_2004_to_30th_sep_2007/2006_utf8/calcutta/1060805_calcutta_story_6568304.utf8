 A male classical dance which originated in the temples of Kerala over four centuries ago, Kathakali presents the art of communicating symbolic stories based on ancient epics and legends. A highly charged and powerful drama combining physical virtuosity with story narration, it is one of the most impressive and vibrant forms of theatre. Karna Kunti, presented by Kalamandalam Murali (picture left) and Bhama Murali, brilliantly characterises these two personalities from the Mahabharata. In this episode, Kunti discloses to Karna that she is his mother and the Pandavas his brothers. This evening also features another unique dance style from Kerala, Keralanatnam (introduced by Guru Gopinath), a simplified version of Kathakali infused with folk elements. The dance performances will be preceded by Tagore songs by Manoj Murali Nair and Manisha Murali Nair. Hosted by Bhavna.

 Event: Kathakali, Keralanatanam and Tagore songs 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Uttam Mancha

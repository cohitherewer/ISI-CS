Year of the Dog set to roll

Feng Shui Matters

On January 29, the world will witness the colourful 

celebrations that mark the Chinese New Year. Although it is the beginning of the 

Year of the Dog, very few people understand the hidden significance of this ancient 

system of Oriental astrology.

The Chinese lunar calendar is calculated according 

to the phases of 12 moons, each of which lasts for 29-and-a-half days. The western 

calendar, in comparison, is calculated according to the earths orbit around 

the sun. 

According to Chinese mythology, the Jade emperor was 

the ruler of the heavens. He had not seen the creatures of the earth and was curious 

to know about the characteristics and usefulness of the 12 best animals residing 

on earth. Finally, the lucky 12 that were chosen in order of preference were rat, 

ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. 

Legend has it that at the time of selection, there 

was competition between cat and dog. The Jade emperor asked them what they had 

done to help humanity. The cat said the dog did nothing but guard the door and 

eat too much. The dog, however, said he only had a bowl of food during his meals, 

while all the cat did was chase away the mice and eat the best food. 

The cats logic impressed the emperor more, though 

he did allow the dog to compete in the race. 

On the day of the race, the cat, afraid the dog might 

attack him for lying, hid behind the pig. Unfortunately, the pig was the 12th 

animal and the cat was disqualified. The Chinese still believe this is why dogs 

chase cats.

Those born in 1934, 1946, 1958, 1970, 1982, 1994 or 

2006 belong to the Dog Year. But since the Chinese New Year begins either in January 

or February unlike the western calendar that begins on January 1 each year, it 

is advisable to check the Chinese lunar calendar if you are born in the months 

of January or February.

Characteristics

A dog is said to be mans best friend because 

it is dependable, loyal, faithful and extremely honest. Dogs wouldnt dream 

of harming people. Instead, being courageous, they will always fight for justice 

and help friends in need. Those belonging to this animal sign can be fully trusted 

by their spouses. They are sensitive and will do anything to protect their loved 

ones. 

Dogs bark to warn you against intruders and danger. 

So a nagging person having this personality trait means well, but may not always 

be appreciated. 

People belonging to this sign tend to think about 

problems yet to crop up. They also need time to relax. They usually enjoy the 

company of enthusiastic and confident people. If such people are ever cheated, 

the deceiver will never be able to regain their trust and faith.

Career

As they are reliable, responsible, trustworthy and 

dedicated, they make good teachers, lawyers, doctors, religious preachers, counsellors 

and the like.

Compatibility

Dogs are compatible with rabbits, horses and tigers. 

They do not get along well with dragons. People born in the year of the dragon 

will experience a turbulent and chaotic year with movement, travelling and change.

For dragons, it is better to engage in movements like 

shifting home or office rather than travelling far away. But if they do need to 

travel, they should definitely avoid going straight towards the north-west direction 

since it is the direction of the Grand Duke in 2006. 

It is highly advisable that such people carry photographs 

of rabbits in their wallets. They can also keep figures of rabbits on their office 

desk and bedside table. They will do well if they wear a locket with a rabbit 

motif as a lucky charm that will also protect them for the whole year. Another 

valuable tip for dragons is to get friendly with people belonging to the rabbit 

sign and also keep photographs of their near and dear ones with this animal sign. 

Famous faces

Famous people born in the Year of the Dog include 

Sophia Loren, Winston Churchill and Ava Gardner.

Tip of the week

On January 29 at 7.45 pm take a yellow piece of paper 

and write with a red pen a note to god. First thank the almighty for having blessed 

you with all the good things in life and then make 10 wishes. These can be 10 

different wishes or one wish written 10 times. 

Then sign it and keep it in the temple, light a candle 

or a diya and meditate on your wishes for sometime and while doing so visualise 

them materialising. Once your wishes are granted, you can float the paper in water.

 Nasal notes 

 on foreign shores

 Trademark cap, look,

 Himesh Reshammiya showed his first 

 jhalak right at the point of entry to London, courtesy 

 a lady of Indian origin at the immigration counter of Heathrow 

 airport. He is criticised so much in your country. 

 Why have you bothered to come all this way to hear him? 

 she wondered.

 The question lingered as one took 

 the coach to the hotel with a British RJ playing what he 

 called a strange song (Aap kaa surroor) 

 on request on the breakfast show of Sunrise Radio, the subcontinental 

 communitys address on the air wave.

 The hotel being right next to 

 the Wembley Stadium, the bartender was spoilt, having tuned 

 into UB40 and Bon Jovi live. But his Indian assistant wouldnt 

 mind offering a drink for an Aap Kaa Surroor concert ticket.

 The organisers had a spring in 

 their steps all morning. While most of the tickets had been 

 snapped up online, the queue at the counter also wore a 

 lengthy look. A Punjabi couple had bought two 50 tickets 

 and was arguing for the free entry of their three-year-old. 

 He eats his meals only if we put on a Himesh DVD, 

 they pleaded. Lets hear if he can sing us one, 

 the exasperated official challenged. To his surprise, the 

 child lisped back: Talak tikla da. He 

 saved his parents 50 quid.

 There was more than a nip in the 

 air in the afternoon. It was October 29 and winter had officially 

 set in, despite a sharp morning sun. A few hours before 

 dusk, the star of the show had blazed in, straight after 

 a nights concert at Bangalore.

 Trademark cap and deadpan look 

 in place, Himesh Reshammiya had addressed reporters and 

 then rolled off to the Wembley Arena in a stretch limousine.

 Though dwarfed by the iconic arch 

 of Wembley Stadium under renovation next door, the Arena 

 has played host to Cliff Richard, Madonna, Prince, Christina 

 Aguilera... It has recently undergone a 35 million renovation. 

 The newly built piazza facing the dancing fountains was 

 bubbling with anticipation of a night of song and dance.

 From Upendra Bhandari, a student 

 from Woolwich with a 50 ticket, to Firoze, a driver bringing 

 family over from Edgewire at 25 per head, to Judy Kay, 

 a self-confessed big weirdo who had dragged 

 her husband from London to hear Hindi songs booking 75 

 seats, Himesh fans ranged across the socio-economic spectrum.

 No wonder the bearded singer in 

 a black long coat would stress so much on his one-to-one 

 connection with the audience, cocking a snook at critics 

 who tried to come in between. 

 The singer known for his nasal 

 notes started off with a medley of songs, but the real thing 

 had to wait till after the announcement of a film on his 

 real luv story. Agar meri love 

 story main ne aap logo ke saath share nahin ki 

 toh meri zindagi adhuri reh jayegi (If I dont 

 share my love story with you, my life will remain incomplete).

 As the giant screen beamed his 

 reel aspirations, someone threw a black cap at him. Himesh 

 happily picked it up, to add to the scores in his wardrobe. 

 I will reveal what lies under the cap in the film, 

 he promised. 

 The silence that greeted the announcement 

 of the singer-composers big-screen tryst was unnerving, 

 even for Indias first rockstar yes, 

 that is what his publicity machinery had crowned the high-octave 

 performer.

 Mujhe lag raha hai aaplog 

 khush nahin hain (I feel you are not happy with the 

 news), Himesh mused, before shouting out loud: Please 

 bless me London.

 They did when he was back, singing. 

 Before that, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005 participants 

 Himani, Vineet, Debojit, Paresh (a local lad from Brent 

 who made up with accent what he lacked in rhythm), Indian 

 Idol Abhijeet Sawant and Calcutta girl Ujjaini had come 

 and gone. Mahek Chawl and troupe had flashed some flesh 

 to some lusty beats.

 But it was Himesh the crowd longed 

 for. Which is why even humour got a thumbs down when a stand-up 

 comedian tried to fill in the blank between Aashiq banaya 

 aapne and Mohabbat ki gujarish.

 A near stampede ensued when Himesh, 

 playing up to his young fans, asked for 10 kids to come 

 on stage. But Wembley was not Wankhede and rules, in Her 

 Majestys land, were rules. So the security guards 

 intervened, making Himesh plead, Ek bachcha to 

 de do bhaiya But the baby that was finally plonked 

 on stage promptly let out a long wail.

 But nothing could slow Himesh 

 down. Playing to the galleries where tempers flared when 

 fans were not allowed to do the Bhangra full blast he 

 belted out one hit after the other with rare energy. And 

 when he upped the tempo for Jhalak dikhla ja, there 

 was a Kodak moment of sub-continental unity on English soil 

 Nasima and Sumar from Pakistan and Dee from Bangladesh, 

 all flocking from Luton, dancing in the aisles to the Mumbai 

 melody mans beats.

 As the cars cruised back home 

 crowding Empire Way, the music systems blasted more of Himesh 

 Next stage stop for the capped crooner? Glasgow, the next 

 night.

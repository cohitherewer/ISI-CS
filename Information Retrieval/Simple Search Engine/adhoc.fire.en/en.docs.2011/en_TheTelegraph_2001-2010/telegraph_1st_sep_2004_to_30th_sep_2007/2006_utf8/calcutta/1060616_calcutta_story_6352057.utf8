 Traffic tips on boards

 KINSUK BASU

 Hurrying to office but caught in a traffic jam, how often have you cursed your luck for selecting the route? If the traffic department is to be believed, however, driving through the city may soon be much easier.

 Following the practice in some of the best-managed cities across the world, the department has decided to put up electronic boards that will display messages to guide motorists trapped in snarls for taking alternative routes.

 The boards, to be erected at all major crossings across the city, will also be used to spread awareness about traffic safety norms. ?If motorists can be informed in advance about developments on the roads ahead, the snarls can be better managed. You just need to see the directions on the board and act accordingly,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic). 

 The intersections have been chosen in a way that motorists will be able to make effective diversions during a snarl. Motorists will also be informed in advance in the event of a VIP convoy passing through.

 The city police, which mooted the idea, have assigned the task of erecting the boards to an advertising agency. It is now the agency?s responsibility to obtain clearance from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the CESC before kick-starting the project.

 ?There are a few things that need to be sorted out before we launch the project,? said Mrinmoy Bhattacharjee, director of the agency. ?For instance, we are not sure if it will be feasible to keep a temperature watch on the boards. Once things are in shape, the system will surely change the driving experience on city roads,? he added. 

 The liquid crystal boards will be set up at a height of 12 to 16 feet to ensure unhindered visibility. Part of the board will be used for advertisements. Each board will cost Rs 2.5 lakh and insiders say the viability of the project will depend on the revenue generated by the advertisements.

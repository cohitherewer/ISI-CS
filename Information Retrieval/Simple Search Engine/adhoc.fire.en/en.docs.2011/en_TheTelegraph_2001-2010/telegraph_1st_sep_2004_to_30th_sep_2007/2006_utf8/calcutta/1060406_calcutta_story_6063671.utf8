 Girl child found off tracks

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 An abandoned baby girl was discovered inside a plastic bag, with its zipper drawn, near the railway tracks of Brace Bridge station, on Wednesday evening. Residents of the area, drawn to the bag by the cries of the infant, alerted the Taratala police station.

 Officers on night patrol rushed to the spot and found the girl child crying incessantly. She was first taken to the police station.

 ?She is barely five-six days old and very frail. She had been deliberately kept inside the plastic bag, carefully wrapped in a sari. We?ve handed her over to an NGO and will be making an appeal in court for her safe custody on Thursday,? said Nurul Anwar, officer-in-charge of Taratala police station.

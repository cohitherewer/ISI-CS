 Colours of freedom

 Celebrating 59 years of Indias independence, Gallerie 52d hosts an art exhibition on the theme of freedom. Featuring works by 59 post-colonial artists, it depicts their personal views on liberty in contemporary public and private life. Seen through the resplendent strokes of the artists, freedom appears as a living character, often personified as a woman and evoking memories of Delacroixs famous 19th century masterpiece, Liberty Leading the People. Besides portraying civil and political liberties, freedom is also perceived as a philosophy of life; an ideal condition wherein individuals have full and free command of their physical and emotional faculties. Participating artists include Jogen Chowdhury, Subrata Gangopadhyay, Suvaprasanna, Paritosh Sen, Kazi Anirban (a painting by him appears above), Kartick Pyne, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, B.R. Panesar and Lalu Prasad Shaw. Inauguration today at 5 pm.

 Event: Paintings by artists of the post-colonial era 

When: October 11 - October 18, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

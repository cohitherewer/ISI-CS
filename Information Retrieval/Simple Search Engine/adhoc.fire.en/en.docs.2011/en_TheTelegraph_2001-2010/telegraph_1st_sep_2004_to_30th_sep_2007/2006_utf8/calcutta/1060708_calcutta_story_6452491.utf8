Young at 47

Stage On amp; Off

 Nandikar members in rehearsal

 Nandikar turned 47 on June 29. ?The theatre troupe was started by Ajitesh Bandopadhyay along with a few schoolteachers, a postal peon and a rickshawpuller,? says Rudraprasad Sengupta, under whose leadership Nandikar has flourished over the years.

 The birthday celebrations at Academy 

 of Fine Arts last Thursday were centred round the play that 

 the troupe was performing after a long time. Sojon Badiyar 

 Ghat, directed by Sengupta, took the stage in the evening 

 in a near-packed auditorium.

 ?We spent the whole day rehearsing the play at the Academy. Many members of other theatre groups came over to see the production and wish us,? says actor Debshankar Haldar.

 Over the past 47 years, the Nandikar repertoire has included playwrights like Shakespeare and Michael Madhusudan Dutt to Chekov, Ibsen, Pirandello, Ionesco, Strindberg and Brecht.

 Last year saw two new plays in Bappaditya and Chokh Galo, and the children?s production Bhalobasha Bhalo Bhasha. That apart, a number of vintage Nandikar productions and some staged a few years ago have been revived. These include Shesh Sakshatkar, Feriwalar Mrityu, Gotraheen, Sojon Badiyar Ghat, Shanu Roy Chowdhury, Antigone, Football and Maromiya Mon.

 In the pipeline are stage versions of three children?s stories by Ashapurna Devi and Leela Mazumdar. ?Though meant for children, the cast will comprise grown-up actors. We are working on Leela Mazumdar?s Pakhi and Notun Chhele Natobar, and Ashapurna Devi?s Rater Kutumbo,? says Debshankar.

 The more ambitious project is 

 an adaptation of Shakespeare?s lost play, Cardenio. 

 Next up is B. Sahani?s Madhavi, with Swatilekha Sengupta 

 in one of the key roles.

 Eva Peron, the wife of Argentine 

 president Juan Peron and the prototype of the mid-20th-century 

 power blonde, has returned to London in a warmly received 

 revival of Evita, the 1978 musical by Andrew Lloyd 

 Webber and Tim Rice, that transforms her into an ideal heroine 

 for 2006.

 This Evita, whose title character is incarnated with warm eyes and cool professionalism by the young Argentine actress Elena Roger, unfolds as a series of singing headlines and picture captions (Evita meets Juan! Evita goes to Rome! Is Evita ill?).

 As was demonstrated by the 1996 film version, directed by Alan Parker and starring Madonna, literal-minded earnestness underscores the limitations of Evita. 

 The production begins with the promising robustness of an old-fashioned musical, replete with lively dancing peasants, city slickers and soldiers. But by the second act, after Eva has secured her perch as the first lady of Argentina, a certain stuttering repetitiveness sets in, musically and dramatically. 

 As instances of the extreme, even murderous measures of Peron?s regime multiply, while Eva grows weaker from the cancer that will kill her, the surface-skimming glibness of lyrics starts to grate. Once she ascends to power, though, this Evita becomes rather robotic, which may be the point but isn?t very exciting to watch.

 Perception and reality, science and technology, India and her future? These were some of the issues under discussion on Day II of the Knowledge Conclave ? Kolkata Convergence, being held at Science City. The event, organised by New Display Services in association with Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, featured several eminent speakers.

 While students squatted on the floors outside the auditorium working on projects, the exhibition, inaugurated on Thursday, had various schools showcasing issues ranging from the environment to drug addiction. Inside, panel discussions were held on Friday.

 The first session was on India: Perception amp; Reality ? National/Global. The speakers included Kiran Karnik of Nasscom, industrialist Harsh Neotia, Bikram Das Gupta, chairman and CEO of Globsyn Technologies, Calcutta, and a student of Presidency College. While Karnik emphasised that the perception of India was changing and there was some truth to it, Das Gupta urged entrepreneurs to grab the opportunities aplenty in today?s thriving Indian market. 

 But a recurring point in that discussion was ?the stratification of India, between the haves and have-nots?, which creates the great divide and spawns terrorism. As one speaker put it, there is no democracy for the poor in India. ?The perception of India is changing, but among whom? There is a vast difference between the perception of the country among the common man and industry,? stressed P.M. Bhargava, vice-chairman, National Knowledge Commission.

 The next issue up for debate was India Tomorrow: Science amp; Technology Base. ?Lifestyles have undergone a sea change in recent times, thanks to technology. It will also have an important role in the future of our economic development. But because of the inequality in society, modernisation has excluded around 90 per cent of India?s population,? said Prof Abhirup Sarkar of the Indian Statistical Institute.

 ?Our education system is not efficient enough to encourage creativity and innovation, which is essential for better utilisation of technology. Teach them not what to think, but how to think,? added Sisir Sen, former professor of IIT Kharagpur and senior scientist at Jadavpur University.

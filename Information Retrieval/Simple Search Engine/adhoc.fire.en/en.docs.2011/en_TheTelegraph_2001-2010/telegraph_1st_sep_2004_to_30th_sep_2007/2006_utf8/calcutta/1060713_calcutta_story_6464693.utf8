 Patient ear for the elderly 

 - Calcutta 

 Police Helplines play a new role

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Cops are now playing a role they had never bargained for ? talking the aged out of their loneliness and depression.

 This follows an order from deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee, that officers manning the Lalbazar police control room helplines must always lend a patient ear to elderly and lonely callers.

 ?This is not a simple chat session with the aged,? Chatterjee explained. ?Most of them are living alone and have a sinking feeling that they have been deserted by their near-and-dear ones, especially children. The feeling often results in depression, at times prompting them to commit suicide. Our officers try to assure the aged that they are really not alone; at least the force is with them.?

 An officer said the number of calls at the Lalbazar control room increased drastically after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee inaugurated four helplines, including one for the aged, last year.

 ?Initially, people called us seeking help for all sorts of odd jobs ? like fetching a long-lost book from a friend?s house or pacifying a barking dog in the neighbourhood in the dead of night. But after some days, the callers just wanted to spend time by talking to our officers. They neither sought any help nor lodged a complaint,? the officer recalled.

 Those who were manning the landlines, not used to handling such calls, had a standard reply to the requests: ?Sorry, we aren?t here to chat with you. If you have a problem, tell us.?

 Heart-wrenching it may be, but the answer was expected of a cop whose primary duty is to maintain law and order. 

 But deputy commissioner Chatterjee had a different idea. He called the officers in charge of the control room and asked them to handle the aged callers differently, patiently and politely.

 ?Our boss told us to give as much time to aged callers as possible. He explained to us how lonely and vulnerable they are,? said an officer.

 Another officer said: ?The callers just wanted to talk to us. They share their stories with us ? like how their son or daughter had left them alone. Some also want to listen to our stories ? like the lifestyle of a policeman or how an officer maintains a balance between his tough duty schedule and family commitments.? 

 Chatterjee said: ?We receive 400 to 500 calls a day. Among these, there are a few from the aged who want to chat with our officers. I have told my men to send every caller a message that we are with him or her.?

 Helplines: 100 98300 88884

 Meena Arora Nayak: The psyche of a terrorist

 As terrorism becomes a global phenomena, so does the literature that it spawns. The number of books inspired by 9/11 is as phenomenal as the event was catastrophic. And whether it is fiction or an academic publication, writers, thinkers and rationalists have tried to look into the terrorists mind to comprehend his/her psyche.

 Meena Arora Nayaks Endless Rain, published by Penguin, is set in the backdrop of Kashmir Valley, Kashir as the people call it, and starts from the birth of the protagonist. 

 In a ritualistic, traditional and superstitious society, Ali is born at a predestined moment when India declares a ceasefire during its war with Pakistan on December 17, 1971. An auspicious moment is rendered inauspicious by Alis liberal father, who has sired three daughters before his son was born. On hearing the news of the ceasefire on the radio, Maqsood inadvertently speaks the words of war into the newborns ear, instead of invoking the Allah. And that sets in motion a chain of events in Alis life as it takes a bizarre turn in this strife-ridden valley.

 On a visit to the city, Nayak, a teacher of English and mythology in a college in Virginia, USA, says: I have been to Kashmir a couple of times and the last time I visited the valley, it was to research for my article about Kashmir for a US magazine. 

 It is difficult to say where fact begins and fiction ends in Endless Rain. My characters are fiction but the events and situations are real, says the author. Apart from politics, there are legends and rituals of Kashmir. Kashmir has its very own culture, the culture of Kashmiriyat. It is a very syncretic religion that Kashmiris practise, a mixture of Hinduism, Sikhism, Islam and Sufi-ism that goes into the making of Kashmiriyat, explains Meena. 

 She lived with a Kashmiri family, dressed like them and did the daily chores. I talked to the children, the house-boat owners, the tongawallas to know of the life lived in the hail of bullets. And Meena believes that such a life cannot go on forever. They are sick of living like this. Ninety-eight per cent of the Kashmiris are depressed. They want to get back to their normal lives. 

 Meena, like other progressives, blames the insincerity and insensitivity of politicians for the alienation of Kashmiris. There are no home-bred terrorists, asserts Meena, even as she shies away from the nomenclature terrorist. It is a cause-driven militancy that drove the youth of Kashmir to rebel, she explains. It is easy to be swayed by so many stakeholders. Theres India, Pakistan, China, America, all of whom have strategic interests. It is a landlocked country and the youth had been swayed by all of these various interests.

 While it was the research that sparked the beginnings of Endless Rain, the idea of the book had been in her head ever since she had talked to her Kashmiri Pandit friend who had taken refuge in Scotland in 1990.

 My friend talked to me of Kashmir and he said: The saffron fields are red. Saffron flowers are normally purple but it has turned red with the incessant bloodshed, says Meena. 

 It was this powerful imagery that went into the making of Endless Rain and inspired the authors thoughts on the land and its people.

 Take a look: The exhibition was inaugurated on Saturday afternoon by designer Sharbari Datta, looking elegant in a rich blue drape. My association with Sasha goes back a long time and its always nice to be associated with such creative endeavours that they come up with. Their effort to promote rural artisans and forgotten crafts is praiseworthy, said Sharbari.

 The eight-day exposition has cottons from all over India showcased in various forms ?saris, stoles, casual shirts, kurtas and more. There are khadi saris from Orissa that are ideal for casual and corporate summer wear. Those in off-whites are co-ordinated with beautiful borders, both narrow and broad.

 Hair hurrah

 What: Introduction of African braiding hairstyles.

 Where: Marina salon at Beckbagan, near Mithai.

 When: From end-April.

 Take a look: This form of braiding has been introduced to beat the summer heat, particularly for those with voluminous hair.

 Several designs can be acquired through this form of hair braiding, like the diamond shape, criss-cross and the Egyptian queen crown shape. The braids can be embellished with beads on the top and ribbons at the end to create a style statement of sorts. 

 Apart from the style factor, the braids allow free air passage to the roots of the hair, keeping it dry throughout the summer months. One can sport each style for as long as three months at a stretch while continuing to wash the hair even four times a week.

 Pocket pinch: Prices range between Rs 800 and Rs 1,500, depending on volume and length of hair.

 Voiceover: It is stylish as well as very comfortable for the summer months, says Marina Chang, proprietor of the salon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Poila date for New Market car park

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Poila Baisakh (April 15) 2007 is the fresh and final deadline for the New Market underground parking plaza, which has already missed a dozen deadlines since December 2003.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya announced on Tuesday that the Rs 35-crore joint venture project of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Simplex Projects would be commissioned on Bengali new years day.

 Construction work, suspended since April over demands raised by some New Market traders with the backing of the local CPM, will resume on Wednesday. 

 Local CPM leaders, including councillor Shiela Kapoor, agreed to allow resumption of work after the mayor accepted some of their demands at a meeting on Tuesday evening.

 The demands include eviction of hawkers from Market Street, Fenwick Bazar Street, Bertram Street and Lindsay Street to make New Market accessible to motorists from all directions.

 Fenwick Bazar Street can serve as an important road connecting Free School Street and Lindsay Street, along the eastern side of New Market, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 The civic authorities, he added, are planning to give a fresh coat of paint to the structure of the 120-year-old New Market building, listed as a heritage structure. The civic body is working on a reconstruction plan of New Market.

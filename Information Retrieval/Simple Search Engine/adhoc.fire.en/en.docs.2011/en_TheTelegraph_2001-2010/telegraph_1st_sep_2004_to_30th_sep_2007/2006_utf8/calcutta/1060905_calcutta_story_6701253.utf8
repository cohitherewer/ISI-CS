The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bar, boardroom... beauty

Screen On amp; Off

 MADHUR BHANDARKAR is a man with a mission, sitting in on most of the shows at the just-concluded Fashion Week. Its all for ramp research, reports Pratim D. Gupta

 After boardroom politics in Corporate and roadside ruckus in Signal, Madhur Bhandarkar is returning to his Page 3 world of glitz and glamour with Fashion. The Chandni Bar maker, who has teamed up with UTV to produce this next film of his, was present at almost all the 30 shows of the just-concluded Fashion Week in New Delhi for research work.

 Its created quite some noise in the media, Madhur told Metro the morning after the five-day fashion extravaganza wrapped up in the Capital.But to be honest, it is still very much at the concept stage and we havent even decided which angle to take to put the story forward. The idea just occurred to me and I felt that fashion is a good subject to make a film on. Bars, Bollywood, corporate world, parties sab to ho gaya, abhi yeh bacha hai!

 While the storyline for Fashion is yet to be finalised, sources revealed that the protagonist would be a female model, whose meteoric rise to fame and fortune would reflect the realities of the fashion world.

 Madhur, its learnt, is trying to capture the cut-throat world of forgotten morals and flawed ethics that lies beneath the airbrushed, picture-perfect surface. The film will touch upon everything from casting couches to eating disorders, defining by-products of the fashion world.

 Just like hes done with his last few films, Madhur wants to know the ramp world first hand before starting to script Fashion. I have attended many fashion shows earlier but there I have just been a member of the audience, he said. Now, I want to have a ringside view of the proceedings. During the Fashion Week in Delhi, I went backstage and saw how things happen before and after the show. There are so many people and so many stories to tell from this world.

 Rohit Bal, the fashion consultant for Madhurs 

Fashion 

And to help Madhur tell this story, top fashion designer Rohit Bal will act as consultant on the project. The master of fabric and fantasy showcased his designs at the Fashion Week and even had his discovery Arjun Rampal the story goes that Rohit chanced upon Rampal in a disc when the wannabe actor was a nobody walking the ramp for him.

 Rohit had earlier appeared in the Kaizad Gustad dud Boom, which featured a whole lot of real-life fashion designers including Hemant Trevedi, Anna Singh, Malini Ramani, Manish Malhotra, Tarun Tahiliani and Wendell Rodricks.

 It is also for the first time that UTV and Madhur have tied up for a film. Fashion is veering towards a big film, said Ram Mirchandani, vice-president of UTV Productions. Although we will only know the size of the canvas once Madhur is done with the script, we really want to make this film glamourous and stylish. We have roped in Nitin Desai to do the production design, which will be important for the grand look of the film.

 True to Madhurs style, Fashion should also expose a lot of warts otherwise lost under layers of make-up. A source close to the director revealed that Madhur was planning to explore the series of wardrobe malfunctions rocking the Indian ramp in recent times. 

 The trilogy of Page 3, Corporate and Signal is over and it is not necessary that Fashion will have the same elements as these three films, Madhur said. This is a new film with a new concept and it marks a new chapter of my career as a film-maker.

 Buses in a hurry leave three dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

Killer wheels claimed three lives on Thursday. A person, in his mid-30s, was injured.

 The first mishap occurred around 9.30 am at the crossing of Hazra Road and Sadananda Road. An empty school bus knocked down two pedestrians while they were trying to cross the intersection. Raju Mollah, 30, was injured and the other man, not yet identified, died on the spot.

 As local residents rushed to the spot, the driver jumped out of his cabin and fled. The bus has been impounded.

 Around 12.20 pm, a private bus on route 12C mounted a pavement on Strand Road, at the crossing of Auckland Road, ploughed through a tea stall and hit the wall of Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

 Driver Brijmohan Pandit, 45, died as his cabin was partially smashed, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 Kalipada Das, sitting in the stall, was crushed between the wall and the bus. Traffic on both Strand Road and Auckland Road was stalled.

 A two-year-old girl, wrapped in cloth, was abandoned by her mother on a footpath on Monday morning. 

 By the end of the day, the little one had been rescued and handed over to a voluntary organisation.

 Around 11.30 am, residents of Beleghata hardly paid attention to a woman sitting with a child at the crossing of Chawlpatti Road and Beleghata Main Road. 

 Suddenly, the woman vanished, leaving the child alone on the footpath.

 A traffic constable and a few residents of the area guarded the girl child for close to two hours, tried to feed her some sweets ? which she refused ? till a team from Beleghata police station arrived to take her away.

 Sanjay Sarkar, a constable with Sealdah Traffic Guard, recounted: ?I was on duty at the crossing, when I suddenly heard the wail of a child. I went up to find a baby girl sitting on a piece of red cloth.?

 Soon, a crowd gathered around her. ?We had not paid attention to the woman sitting with the child, but after a while, we found the little girl sitting there alone,? said Suresh Kumar, a witness.

 ?Initially, we thought her mother must have gone somewhere nearby and waited for her to return,? he explained.

 But when an hour went by with no sign of the mother, they realised that the girl child had been abandoned.

 ?I kept a constant vigil and the residents of the area also guarded her to ensure that she was safe,? said constable Sarkar.

 Around 1 pm, a police team took her away. At the Beleghata police station, she was fed some milk and given a set of clothes.

 ?Since the child was not from the locality, we have alerted other neighbouring police stations to gather information about a child going missing,? said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 On Monday afternoon, the girl was shifted to CINI-ASHA. 

 ?She was initially uncomfortable but soon agreed to eat with the other children and then began playing with them,? said a spokesperson for the NGO.

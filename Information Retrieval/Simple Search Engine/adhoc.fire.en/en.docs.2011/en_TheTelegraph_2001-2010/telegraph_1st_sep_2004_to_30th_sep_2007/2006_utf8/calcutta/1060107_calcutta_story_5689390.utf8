 A walk in the clouds makes more sense than walking the ramp. With the skies opening up and the airline count soaring, models both established and aspiring are queuing up to fill in the air hostess blanks.

 ?The Calcutta modelling scene is pretty dicey. All these girls do is one ramp show and call themselves models,? says ?model? Shivani Ghosh, 20, explaining why she?s turned her shapely back to the ramp and signed up for an air hostess training programme.

 Shivani?s certainly not alone. Model Cheena Vyas, with an offer from a private airline, says: ?Calcutta is not at all serious about modelling and so??

 The reason for choosing the aircraft aisle over the ramp is not hard to find. A model starting out in Calcutta can look at pocketing Rs 10,000 in a busy month, while an air hostess can take-off at anything above Rs 30,000. Make it Rs 1.25 lakh if you make it to an international airline.

 ?Job-wise, this is a booming industry at the moment,? confirms Sandip Paul, national centre development manager of Frankfinn Institute of Air Hostess Training. 

 ?With the number of airlines going up each year, the demand for ground staff, cabin crew and ticketing personnel is also at an all-time high,? he points out.

 Quick to respond to the rampant rise in job opportunities, the jump in the number of starry-eyed applications has also ?increased by over 100 per cent?.

 While model Kimberline is already flying with Jet Airways, others like Ronita are next in line. ?I applied on-line and then cleared the first casual interview. I also cleared the second one, that cross-checks height and weight proportions, while the third one focussed on communication skills,? says the 23-year-old, looking forward to ?an exciting journey up in the air? either with Jet or Kingfisher.

 Some like Amit Chatterjee, who has always ?dreamt of becoming a flight steward?, are ambitious enough to try and juggle flying and part-time modelling. All for job satisfaction, ?intense love for travel? and, of course, money matters.

 Cash apart, contacts is a big draw. ?Flying gets you a whole new set of contacts. It could also land some models big breaks, not to forget a fat bank balance. That?s why many models like to fly for a few months and then return to the ramp ? this time with far better connections,? explains Cheena.

 And what does it take to take to the skies? Height, weight, skin, communication skills and body language ? all attributes essential to make it in the modelling world.

 The air hostess dream is also taking wings in the suburbs. ?They comprise 30 per cent of our applications,? reveals Paul of Frankfinn, that offers a one-year diploma course to groom an air hostess.

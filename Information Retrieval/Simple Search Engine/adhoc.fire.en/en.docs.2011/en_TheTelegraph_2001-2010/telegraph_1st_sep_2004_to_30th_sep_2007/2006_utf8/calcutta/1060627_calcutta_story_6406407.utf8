 ?Chris is still my Superman?

 BRANDON ROUTH, the new crusader in red-and-blue, describes the magical transition from a small-town kid to the world?s favourite saviour

 Brandon Routh in Superman Returns

 How does it feel to be a part 

 of the Superman legacy?

 There?s a great legacy before me. Many fantastic actors, artistes and writers have come before me and created this character, and I?m very honoured to be a part of it.

 Did you buy all the previous 

 DVDs and watch them?

 Well, it was fun to actually watch them. I did watch some of the special features and watching the process of what it took to get Chris [Christopher Reeve] cast was quite interesting because it resembles our attempt as well. I was very familiar with the films beforehand ? the first and the second film, which is what we?re mostly taking off from. And while it was helpful to watch the film, I already knew it so much because when I was reading the script for the first time, I was actually picturing Chris, because he was my Superman. He still is my Superman, so, yeah, it was very much in my mind.

 It is an interesting choice 

 to embrace what has gone before...

 Well, absolutely. I think to go too much another way for the sake of my ego wanting to create something in this situation is just wrong, especially since we?re continuing, in a sense, that story. The characters have to feel somewhat similar. All the people that have created him have all come together to make this image. Everybody has the same idea of what it should be. So, for me to go, ?Okay, no, I think he should have a Southern accent?, or something crazy just doesn?t make any sense.

 What was the toughest stunt 

 to do?

 Basically, water is the most challenging thing because you have to be able to clear your sinuses in order to do a lot of things. I had to do a crash test course on scuba diving, and I had to breathe through a regulator, which is cool, but that mixed in with everything else I had to do was just pretty insane.

 What was it like to see yourself 

 in the Superman costume?

 The first time I was on-set was a scene in the Daily Planet. I was wearing the suit for the first time and the crew was pretty awesome because there was a buildup. We?d been there for a couple of months and nobody had seen it really yet. We hadn?t filmed anything. I wasn?t really in tune with the character quite as much until that day because then people who didn?t know me kind of accepted me just by seeing me walk around as the character. It was very helpful for me.

 How confident were you wearing 

 that suit?

 Well, really it?s all about what?s inside, how you feel about yourself when you put that on. Because it?s very imposing if worn with confidence, I suppose. The first time I wore it, I didn?t have that as much. I hadn?t really trained yet. I hadn?t read the script. I hadn?t really worked on the character at that point. And I was standing around with a room full of costume designers and some other people and everybody was judging me right away. 

 But then I was able to track the process of my growth as I worked on the character and trained and really did grow into it, and then felt comfortable.

 Did you talk to Dana and Christopher 

 Reeve before filming began?

 Not before filming. I never talked to Christopher, but I did receive a very nice note from Dana Reeve halfway through filming that just gave her blessings to the project and to me. She had known Bryan (Singer, the director) before, so he had a chance to talk to her, but that was my first contact with the family, actually. And it was very nice to receive that.

 What was your audition process 

 like?

 Well, Bryan had seen a tape of me of a previous audition that I?d done and so we had coffee at the Coffee Bean on Sunset, and talked for an hour-and-a-half. He divulged so much of the script and we talked about the character and my background in such depth that we had a really good sense of each other and where we saw the character and how he envisioned the script.

 And then I did a couple of readings at the casting office of Warner Bros. and then we did a screen test. People were saying things that led me to believe that I might be the only guy here. But I wasn?t sure; I didn?t want to get too caught up in it, but I felt pretty confident these people really liked me and wanted me to get this.

 How did you go from Norwalk, 

 Iowa, to Hollywood, and why?

 Well, I was an English major at the University of Iowa for a year. I was going to be a novelist and maybe possibly go into graphic design. And then I looked into modelling in Iowa as a way to make money as a poor college student. That led into going to New York to this convention called IMTA, where there were talent and modelling scouts, managers, agents. I never thought that a small-town kid from Iowa could become an actor. But I went to this thing in New York, I found my manager, who said, ?Move out to LA.?

 What?s it like to work with 

 Kevin Spacey?

 Well, maybe I?m a little spoilt already; the opportunity to work with Bryan Singer on my first film is quite amazing. I?m just very blessed to have worked with these people and to have experienced their energy and just the history that they have in this industry, and the lessons that they?ve taught me. Just to be surrounded by such great people is really awesome.

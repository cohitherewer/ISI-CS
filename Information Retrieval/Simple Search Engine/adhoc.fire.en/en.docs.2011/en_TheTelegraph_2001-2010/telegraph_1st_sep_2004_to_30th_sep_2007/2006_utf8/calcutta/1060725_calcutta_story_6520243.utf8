Traffic on key arterial roads, in the central and northern parts of city, was thrown out of gear after a procession of at least 17,000 people took to the streets on Monday afternoon. 

 With no prior information about the rally, the traffic police had a tough time managing the members of a religious outfit. The processionists first gathered at the Shyambazar five-point crossing and then walked down to Shahid Minar blocking College Street and SN Banerjee Road.

 ?We were not prepared. It is obvious that if thousands hit the road at any point of a working day, traffic is bound to be in disarray,? said an officer of the traffic department.

 The procession started around 1 pm, leaving parts of Sealdah, including the flyover clogged. The traffic along Rabindra Sarani and its adjoining streets was also hit. North-bound traffic was diverted from Esplanade to Rani Rashmoni Avenue to meet the crisis. But the situation worsened when the meet ended around 6.45 pm, with the processionists jostling with people returning from work.

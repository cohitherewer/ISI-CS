 Awesome images

 Committed to the conservation of nature and wildlife, Kolkata Conservators of Nature is a group of eight individuals from different walks of life who promote the art and science of nature photography as a medium of communication for nature appreciation and environmental protection.

The ongoing exhibition, the third to be held so far, has awe-inspiring pictures of wild beasts, colourful, exotic birds and stunning landscapes. Featuring photographs by Amitabha Ghosh, Arghya Chowdhury, Barun Kumar Dutta, Joydeb Goswami, Samarendra Kumar Saha, Saikat Roy, Suman Chatterjee and Tanmoy Chowdhury.

 Nod for number plate tenders

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to go ahead with the tender process for high-security number plates.

 In July 2003, the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) had floated a tender for the manufacture and supply of high-security registration plates across the state. One of the bidders, Shimnit Utsch, had moved a petition in the high court against another firm in the fray. 

 Last year, the government invited fresh tenders for the contract. 

 A high-security numberplate offers better visibility and is fitted with an electronic chip to allow tracking of the vehicle?s movement. 

 The Supreme Court had made it mandatory to introduce such registration plates in all vehicles, said transport department officials.

 Eight companies had submitted bids the second time, but the offers were not opened after the court ordered a stay.

 A division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Saumitra Sen, ruled on Tuesday that the TIDC had not violated any rules during the tender process.

 The petitioner had argued that the TIDC had no right to cancel the original tender and float a fresh one.

 Manik Das, who represented the TIDC, said the petitioner had accepted the decision to cancel the tender and had withdrawn the earnest deposit. ?The petitioner submitted its bid when the tender was floated the second time. Why did the company take part in the fresh tender if it had problems about cancellation of the earlier one??? asked Das.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: ?We will decide the next course of action by consulting legal experts and senior officials, after going through the judgment.?

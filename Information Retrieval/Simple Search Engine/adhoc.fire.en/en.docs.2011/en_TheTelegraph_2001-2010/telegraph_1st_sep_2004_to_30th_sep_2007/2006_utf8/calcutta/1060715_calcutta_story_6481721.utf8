 A wintry night in north Calcutta. 

 Pankaj and Bimal are on night-guard duty, armed with sticks 

 and torches, knitted monkey cap and sleeveless sweater in 

 place. Only a while ago a corpse has been carried away, 

 the chants of cremation ground tantrics and barking dogs 

 build up a grim foreboding. Even the two unemployed youths 

 for whom ?nothing new ever happens? sense it.

 Then high up on the walls amidst 

 suitable gushes of smoke, the ghost appears. But that is 

 where conventions end. This is not the guard platform of 

 the castle of Elsinore, but Garanhata, and the ghost instead 

 of being the wronged King of Denmark is Sadhan Hemlat?s 

 father in Bratya Basu?s Hemlat: The Prince of Garanhata.

 So the ghost appears to the accompaniment 

 of red smoke and a remix of the music of Tridev. 

 Instead of the silent armour-clad Shakespearean Ghost who 

 shakes his head, spreads his arms and beckons, we have a 

 dhoti-clad ghost who quotes dialogues from films of Sunny 

 Deol, Jackie Shroff, Naseeruddin Shah, Manoj Vajpayee, Mithun 

 Chakraborty, et all. ?Raj kar raha hai haiwan,? he 

 cries, demanding revenge.

 ?I have always striven to raise 

 a contemporary voice, people don?t like that much. They 

 prefer to talk of the past or even when they do talk of 

 the present it usually is of distant places like USA or 

 Europe. This might make me a loner but I can?t keep quiet. 

 If I get the itch, comment I will. That too in non-political, 

 aesthetic statements,? said Bratya Basu who has to his credit 

 a host of controversial and successful plays like Ashaleen, 

 Aranyadeb, Sahar Yaar, Page 4, Chatush Kon, Mukhomukhi Boshibar, 

 Winkle Twinkle and Babli.

 ?Few people in India realise the 

 many possibilities of doing Shakespeare. I felt that if 

 people can accept the films Maqbool and Omkara 

 (based on Macbeth and Othello) it is time 

 I did Hemlat,? said Bratya, during a midnight rehearsal 

 at the Academy of fine Arts.

 The language of Hemlat is of today 

 and the milieu is the one we live in, complete with promoters, 

 politicians, and owners of ?Xerox centres? and STD booths.

 They have been rehearsing for 

 a month now, nearly six hours a day, with many sessions 

 stretching from 11 pm to 5 am. ?It?s easier for the actors, 

 most of who are tied up in different commitments during 

 the day, and at night the mobiles are off,? smiles Bratya.

 The group has a point to prove. 

 Hemlat: The Prince of Garanhata is the first play 

 to be produced by Swapnasuchana, a theatre group that acknowledges 

 how the ticket buyer?s money is ?their investment? and ?they 

 should go away feeling that they have profited?.

 Producer Bijoy Mukherjee, who 

 has long been associated with theatre group Barasat Anushilani, 

 says he has learnt the hard way that the amateurish style 

 in which groups present theatre nowadays cannot survive. 

 With a director, script and team 

 of actors and technicians selected purely on the basis of 

 merit and commitment, they stand a better chance of coming 

 up with entertaining yet thought-provoking productions, 

 which also cover a good part of the costs. Members of the 

 present team have decided to waive remuneration for the 

 first six shows, which the producer says will cost around 

 Rs 6 lakh.

 Bratya?s team of actors hails 

 from various groups of Calcutta and Uluberia like Lokokrishti, 

 Beadon Street Shuvam and Barasat Anushilani. The names of 

 characters echo those of the original like Shefalia for 

 Ophelia, Kadu for Claudius, Paul for Polonius, Lachchu for 

 Laertes.

 But there is nothing to trivialise 

 the situation, and the passion comes through with as much 

 intensity from these home-grown sources. According to the 

 writer-director, the name Garanhata was not only chosen 

 because ?it goes well with Hemlat but because I wanted to 

 show the paradox of a locale that encompasses the Nimtala 

 burning ghat, the red-light area as well as the Jorasanko 

 Thakur Bari?.

 The play that Bratya claims is 

 an authentic representation of the fascinating labyrinth 

 of time will be staged at the Academy of Fine Arts, on July 

 16, 23 and 30 and August 6, at 10 am.

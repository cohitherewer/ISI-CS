 Enter, battery-driven vehicles to battle the poison fumes.

 In a bid to usher in green transport in a city being increasingly choked on vehicle fumes, the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency (WBREDA), which had earlier engineered battery-driven autorickshaws, has now joined hands with a number of organisations for mass production of battery-powered bicycles, two-wheelers and cars.

 In June, an exhibition will be organised at Energy Park, on EM Bypass, for entrepreneurs and common people to check for themselves the efficacy of such vehicles.

 ?The vehicles will be battery-driven and soundless. They will be absolutely eco-friendly,? said a spokesman for WBREDA. ?Earlier, we had produced green autorickshaws ourselves, but this time we will offer the knowhow and all sorts of promotional assistance to the organisations willing to produce the vehicles. Four firms have already shown interest in the project.?

 According to the spokesman, the two-wheelers and bicycles both will run on a 36-volt battery that will last for at least two years. An airconditioned car will require a 96-volt battery and an non-airconditioned car, a 48-volt battery. ?You have to recharge the battery for two-three hours, just as you do for your cellphone battery. All you need for the recharge is a three-pin plug point,? he said.

 The prices, too, are reasonable.A battery-driven scooter will cost around Rs 25,000 and a cycle around Rs 6,000. An airconditioned car will be priced at Rs 2.6 lakh and a non-airconditioned car at Rs 2.3 lakh.

 ?Arrangements will be made with oil companies for sale of charged batteries through their outlets. A motorist will not face any difficulty if the battery charge exhausts midway through the journey,? said a WBREDA official.

 ?The most friendly aspect of the scooter is that if the battery exhausts itself while on a trip and the scooterist cannot recharge it immediately, he can simply pedal to his destination,? said N. Maity, a representative of a vehicle-manufacturing unit. 

 The scooters and bicycles will be procured from China and the four-wheelers from Bangalore.

 Three years ago, WBREDA had produced eight-seater autorickshaws that are run on a 72-volt battery.

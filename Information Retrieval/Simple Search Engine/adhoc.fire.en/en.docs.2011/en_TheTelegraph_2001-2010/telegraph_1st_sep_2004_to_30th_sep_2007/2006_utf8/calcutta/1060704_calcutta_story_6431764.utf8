 Wildlife woes 

 on the walls 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui does not recommend the placement 

 of pictures of fierce animals like tigers, lions and 

 leopards in your immediate environment. However, a person 

 belonging to the Tiger sign can put up pictures or figures 

 of tigers to strengthen his animal sign

Q: 

 My date of birth is August 7, 1958. 

 Recently, I have put up a photograph of tigers in my office 

 chamber behind my chair. The picture is facing the east. 

 Is the position appropriate?

 Aditya

 THE SOLUTION: Feng Shui does not recommend placing photographs of fierce animals like tigers, lions and leopards in your immediate environment. Unless of course you have Tiger as your animal sign and you want to strengthen it. 

 It is advisable to place a picture or a figure of a tiger on your office table or wall if you are also a weak person according to your elemental composition at the time of birth. But your animal sign is Dog and hence I do not see the requirement of the picture of a tiger. 

 Anyway, if you want it can be 

 placed on the east wall facing west. Wood is the ruling 

 element of the Tiger, which is associated with the east 

 wall. Try to relocate your chair so that you do not directly 

 face or have the tigers picture behind you. 

 Mirror must 

 Q: 

 I am planning to open a boutique of 

 suits and saris in a small and irregular-shaped room. I 

 have heard that mirrors help rectify the shape of a room. 

 Could you please help me with the placement of mirrors?

 Sangeeta

 THE SOLUTION: Mirrors are helpful in re-routing the flow of Chi around irregular and tight spaces. They also create an illusion of space and depth and definitely help to double the display of products in a boutique. 

 Ensure that the mirror is whole and not tinted. Avoid placing two mirrors without frames side by side as they produce split reflection. Mirrors should be spotlessly clean and unbroken so that the reflection they give is a true one and not in any way tarnished or distorted. Avoid antique mirrors for the boutique.

 Wood wonder 

 Q: 

 I got my MSc (agriculture) degree 

 in plant breeding and genetics in 2000 and now I am working 

 as a contractual worker at Assam Agricultural University 

 Jorhat, in Assam. The problem is that I have not got a permanent 

 post and I am very depressed about it. Kindly suggest remedial 

 measures. My date of birth is 10.03.1975, at 7.30 am.

 Debajit Sut

 THE SOLUTION: It is interesting to note that you have five elements of wood as your own self and since you are born in mid-spring, you are assessed as a strong wood person. 

 This element is so strong that it starts ruling your life. No wonder you have chosen the profession that is connected with agriculture.

 Presently you are being strengthened by the water element, which is extinguishing the fire element that represents your mind. This is making you depressed. But dont worry, next year you will be stepping into pure wood period and this will make you powerful and enable you to get a good, rewarding and a permanent job.

 All you need to do is to make 

 the leader of your life happy by surrounding yourself with 

 green colour, pictures of nature and fresh healthy green 

 plants.

 Career call 

 Q: 

 I was born on 26.08.86. I am studying 

 information technology in a reputed college. I would like 

 to know whether it is a right career option for me. I would 

 also like to know what other career options I can pursue 

 in future. I am an aspiring singer, so please let me know 

 whether music can be a right career option for me.

 Alankar Chakraborty

 THE SOLUTION: Your 

 pillars of destiny reveal that you are a water person with 

 creative elements in abundance. You should do well in media, 

 information technology, communication, banking and finance. 

 You can pursue singing as a hobby but not as a profession. 

 Money matter

 Q: 

 My date of birth is 6.8.1954 at 10.50 

 pm. I deal in automobile parts, but am not satisfied with 

 the results. I lost a lot of money in shares. Please suggest 

 ways to improve my financial position and also advise on 

 a favourable field for me.

 Raunak Manchanda

 THE SOLUTION: According to your pillars of destiny, you are a weak wood person. You need nourishment directly from the water element or indirectly from metal that would create water to strengthen you. 

 Fire and earth go against you. Stock market is directly connected with the fire element. 

 Presently, you are passing through these negative elements, hence I would advise you to take a backseat, play safe in life and stick with the automobile business. Otherwise you could lose more money. Always face north while working and wear shades of green, blue, black and white on important days.

 - Regular inspections to check charges of campus irregularity

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A system to school the ICSE and ISC schools is being put in place by the council.

 Acting on a proposal of the Bengal government, the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has decided to regularly inspect schools affiliated to it across the country.

 The provision of conducting checks has long been part of the council?s guidelines, but is exercised only when a specific complaint is received against a school.

 At a meeting in Delhi last Friday, the authorities, stung by complaints of irregularities against several of its schools, decided to make the inspections a regular feature.

 ?We will be able to say how frequent the inspections will be after holding a few more rounds of talks,? said Rita Wilson, deputy secretary of council, which offers the ICSE and ISC courses.

 The Bengal government, following the failure of its move to enforce an effective monitoring of the schools, had requested the council to arrange for periodic checks to ensure that the institutions did not violate rules.

 Last year, the state government had set up a committee to suggest how to monitor ICSE and ISC schools.

 As part of the exercise, the committee had distributed a questionnaire to 200-odd institutions in the state, seeking information about their functioning. But not one institution responded to the questionnaire till March 31, twice ignoring government reminders.

 ?We have been receiving complaints of irregularities against a number of ICSE and ISC schools. But we are not in a position to take any action, as the schools function under the council,? said Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner, state school education department. ?The fact that the schools did not answer the questionnaire was a matter of concern for us.?

 The complaints include unsatisfactory academic standard, exorbitant tuition and other fees and inadequate infrastructure.

 Biswas, who attended Friday?s meeting, expressed happiness over the decision to make the inspection process more rigorous.

 The government is responsible for issuing no-objection certificates. If any organisation wants to set up an ICSE-ISC school or if a school wants to switch to the ICSE-ISC curriculum, it has to obtain a no-objection certificate from the state government. The council grants its affiliation on the basis of the certificate.

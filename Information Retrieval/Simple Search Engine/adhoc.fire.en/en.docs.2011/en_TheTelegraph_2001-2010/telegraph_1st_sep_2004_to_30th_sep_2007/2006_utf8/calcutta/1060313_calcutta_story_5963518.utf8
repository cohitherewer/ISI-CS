 ORIENTAL ODYSSEY: Ziyi 

 Zhang

 She may interchange her two names but whether she is Ziyi Zhang or Zhang Ziyi, we all love the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star who is on the big screen this week in the title role of Memoirs of a Geisha. She might not have got an Oscar nod for the Rob Marshall film, but Zhang did hand over one of the golden statuettes on the big night at Kodak Theatre.

 Days after the Academy Awards ceremony, Zhang made it to the Top 100 Forbes Chinese Celebrities in the Chinese edition of the international magazine. The star of films like The Hero and The House of Flying Daggers came third after basketball star Yao Ming and dazzling actress Zhou Xun.

 On the film front, Zhang will next be seen as an empress in a Chinese thriller, the English translation of the title of which is The Night Banquet. A loose adaptation of Hamlet, the film is set in an empire in chaos where the emperor, empress, crown prince and the minister all have their own enemies they would like to finish off at a night banquet.

 While The Night Banquet is unlikely to make it to the Calcutta theatres, you can catch an eyeful of Zhang in the Memoirs of a Geisha, which raked in three Oscars, for Art Direction, Cinematography and Costume Design. Based on Arthur Golden?s bestseller, Memoirs is about an impoverished nine-year-old girl who makes it to the world of geishas. The girl grows up to be the famous geisha Sayuri ? played by Zhang ? whose life is changed forever with World War II looming over Japan.

 SPLASH: Dia Mirza playing 

 Holi with Idol finalists N. Karunya, Sandeep 

 Acharya, Anuj Sharma and Amey Date

 Holi specials are flocking the airwaves and the latest to join the colourful bandwagon is Indian Idol. The celebrity judge joining the contestants this week is Dia Mirza. While the ever-smiling actress liked all the performances, she was predictably partial towards fellow-Hyderabadi N. Karunya. ?The Hyderabadi has to win,? an excited Dia announced.

 But then again the voting on the show has been so erratic that the really talented singers like Antara Mitra and Panna Gill have found themselves out of the competition for no fault of theirs. The audience choices have been so disheartening that judge Sonu Nigam openly told Karunya on the show: ?Whether you can become the Indian Idol is not the main factor. That we have chosen a diamond like you is the prime fact. If you don?t become the Idol, it?s not at all your loss, it?s a great loss for the nation.? Catch all this and more on Monday and Tuesday, 9 pm on Sony.

 HOWZZAT: Upen Patel and 

 Rahul Dev

 It?s a unique cricket match-up between Indian filmstars and some UK celebrities. The benefactors: the behind-the-scenes workers of Bollywood. To be organised by the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) in partnership with STAR Plus and Idea Cellular, the IIFA Cup will be held on March 16 from noon at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai.

 Padding up for Team Bollywood will be the biggest of stars including Aamir Khan, Suniel Shetty, Arbaaz Khan, Emraan Hashmi, Madhavan, Riteish, Rahul Dev, Upen Patel, Ashutosh Gowariker, Ashmit Patel, Chunky Pandey and Venkatesh. The British team will comprise cricketers like Phil Tufnell and Jack Russell, along with singers like Jay Sean and Peter Andre.

 Announcing the IIFA Foundation celebrity match, Sabbas Joseph, director of Wizcraft International Entertainment, said: ?We want to provide much-needed support to the workers of Indian cinema and their families, who have faced misfortune during the course of shooting. Fans across the globe can look forward to excitement and action on the live simulcast on STAR Plus, STAR One and STAR Utsav, on April 9.?

 Nine-year-old Calcuttan Sumit Goenka had a huge surprise coming his way on his birthday on March 9, when Nick, the kids? TV channel, threw a surprise birthday party for him. It was part of the Nick Takes Over Your Birthday activity where one kid across India gets a surprise birthday celebration every month. The party was held at the Vaibhav Shopping Plaza with SpongeBob SquarePants making a special appearance. He also presented Sumit with a gift basket full of PlayStation 2, a discman and other Nick goodies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All eyes on house arrest

 The many moods and 

 moments of the inmates of the Bigg Boss house 

 In Mumbai, the nightclubs have been stopping the music at 10 and turning the TV volume up so that the party people can watch Bigg Boss. In Calcutta, the craze for the reality show may not come close to that (maybe thanks to a certain Dada and Didi) but the TV people sure know their Rahul from their Ravi and their Roopali from their Rakhi.

 The Sony show, an adaptation of the international format Big Brother owned by Endemol, is the new face of reality TV in India with the singing talent hunts (Indian Idol and Sa Re Ga Ma Pa) passe and the dance dramas (Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa and Nach Baliye) nearing their finale.

 Bigg Boss is about 13 small-time celebrities (a change from the aam janata line-up in the international format) being locked up in a house where they have to stay for a maximum of three months without any outside communication including mobile phones. Every week, the inmates nominate two among themselves for one to be eliminated through audience voting. The last person living (in the house, that is) at the end of 12 weeks will be crowned winner with Rs 50 lakh to take back home.

 The 28 cameras in place at the Bigg Boss house, located somewhere in Karjat (a two-hour drive from Mumbai), capture the fun and fights, the love and lust, 24x7. The choice of celebrities for the show has come under a lot of fire from the industry and the audience. Come on, Rahul Roy, Amit Sadh, Anupama Verma, Ragini Shetty are hardly celebrities. But then, which Khan or Kumar or even a busy TV star could afford to give three months of his/her time to a reality show and be barred from the outside world.

 Maybe going with the common man could have been a better option. Rajesh Kamat, managing director of Endemol India, disagrees: Taking known faces was very important because the Indian consumer today has a lot of choice and tends to lose patience very quickly. Sony, too, defends its decision. From the very beginning, we were looking for personalities, not stars, says Sandip Sickand, chief creative director of the channel. Initially when the guest-list was announced people called it a loser house and then they got involved with the inmates.

 The other big change for the Indian version of the show revolves around the fig-leaf factor. While the international versions had cameras even in the bathrooms and changing rooms, Bigg Boss lets the inmates be in those private spaces. We had to keep in mind the sensitive audience we were catering to, says Rajesh. He is right because the Australian government actually went on to ban the Big Brother show in its country over the steamy episodes being shown day in and day out.

 Of the 13 personalities in Bigg Boss, Bobby Darling, Deepak Parashar, Kashmera Shah and (the biggest draw) Rakhi Sawant have been evicted from the house, now that the show has gone into its fourth week.

 Deepak, the first-ever Mr India and a popular face in the K-serials, was the second to be thrown out of the house. The 54-year-old model-turned-actor, now known as Nightiewale Baba for the Arabi jabba he used to wear all the time on the show, feels that the strength of Bigg Boss lies in the different backgrounds of the contestants.

 Conflicts are bound to happen because everyone is not on the same wavelength, he says. And everyone has his or her own reason to be on the show. For some the prize money may be everything but for me it was a test of endurance levels.

 While Deepaks exit may not have had a huge effect on the audiences who account for TRPs, the exit of Kashmera and Rakhi can prove costly for Sony. With the two girls going in back-to-back eviction episodes, its obvious that the show is not rigged but at the same time the zings gone, says a Bigg Boss addict. Why should one now watch the show? For Roopali Gangulys mindless rona-dhona or for Aryan-Anupamas 1960s-styled love story?

 Sony has an answer for this, too. No show on TV, fiction or real, depends on one character or one person. You may now like to find out how the house is without Rakhi... concludes Sickand.

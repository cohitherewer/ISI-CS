 Will Smith with Hitch co-star Eva Mendes

 Most women speak in codes. I cant teach you to be an expert code breaker, but I can teach you how to spot the hidden meaning in these yes or no questions.

 Thats Will Smith as Alex Hitch Hitchens giving tips on dating. The 10th highest grossing film of 2005 is premiering on the Indian small screen on HBO on Friday at 9 pm.

 Here are some tips on the art of wooing women from the professional date doctor.

 : She asks, Do you date a lot?

 A: If you say Yes, you essentially just told her that she is one of many, and you should now prepare yourself for a painful period of silence. 

 If you say No, she is thinking you are either a loser or a workaholic and why does she always get stuck with the ones who need to be trained? 

 You need to take focus off quantity here. Try saying something like, Ive dated enough to know what Im looking for in a relationship. 

 Q: She asks, Can you make reservation for dinner somewhere? 

 A: If you say Yes, sorry, but in her mind you have just failed the little collaboration quiz. She wants you to take the lead, but she also wants to be consulted. 

 If you say Noand put all the responsibility on her plate, shell resent you for it. Women arent very decisive when it comes to food and most women hate calling to make reservations. 

 What you need to telepathically communicate here is, Im not the boss but I can lead. Say something like: I suggest, lets try someplace that is new for both of us. Us is truly a magical word if its used in the right context. 

 Q: She asks, Wow! Isnt that woman gorgeous? 

 A: If you say Yes, this is really bad judgment. Even if she is gorgeous, honesty is not the best policy here. 

 If you say No, it does seems like the best answer, but its not. Whether or not a woman is gorgeous you could end sounding like a liar. 

 Remember the whole code analogy? Dont interpret this question literally. Shes really asking How do I compare and of course there is no comparison. So a rather unenthusiastic I guess, I really didnt notice is best. 

 For more dating tips, watch Hitch on HBO, Friday at 9 pm.

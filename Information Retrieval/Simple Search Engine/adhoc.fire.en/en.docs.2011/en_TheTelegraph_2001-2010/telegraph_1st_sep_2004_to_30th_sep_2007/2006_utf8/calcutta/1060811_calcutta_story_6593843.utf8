 It is indeed unfortunate that the Bengali language, for which people once gave their lives and because of which Bangladesh was born, is now suffering gross neglect and may even be on its way to extinction. Ekla Pagal, a gentle satire that tells the story of Bhumi Bhattacharya, a teacher of Bengali, shows how he is made out to be insane simply due to his concern for his mother-tongue. He has even lost his job as a teacher in an English-medium school on the pretext that he propagates regionalism and communalism. But all Bhumi wants to say is that Bengalis should stop aping other cultures thereby forgetting their own. Instead of being ashamed to speak in the vernacular, they should learn to take pride in it. Of course, there are a few who support Bhumi in his endeavour. They believe he is completely rational and are intent on helping him get back his rights. Drama and direction: Romaprasad Banik.

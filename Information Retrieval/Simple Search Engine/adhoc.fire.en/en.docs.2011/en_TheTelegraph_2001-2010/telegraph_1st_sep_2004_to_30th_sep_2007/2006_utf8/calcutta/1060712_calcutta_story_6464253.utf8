 Creating art primarily for the joy of the experience, Keshav Roy is an expressive artist who paints in a variety of mediums. He specializes in conti and charcoal which, though sparse and sombre in presentation, help to convey his vibrant inner spirit. His style can be defined as truly original, intuitive and imaginative, and is based on an emotional response to his subject. The most consistent elements in his work are simple shapes and harmonious colours. His art, which has personal resonance and a subtle, refined humour, is narrative in style, creating images, moods and compositions that inspire curiosity. As such, Roy usually sticks to recognizable subjects while attempting to introduce a slight shift of perception that will tease his viewer away from seeing just ?another nice work?. L?Art De Conti, the solo exhibition of his paintings, will be inaugurated this evening at 7. Hosted by Spandan Art Gallery and ITC Sonar Bangla.

 Event: Solo exhibition of paintings by Keshav Roy 

When: July 12 - July 15

 Perhaps the most celebrated artist of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso practised a style of art that was distinctively his own. His post-modern concepts of visual expression, as manifested in his exciting experiments on canvas, earned him critical accolades and enduring worldwide acclaim. On the occasion of his 125th birth anniversary, Sculpture Gallery, in association with Samokal Art Gallery, hosts A Tribute to Picasso, an exhibition of prints of paintings and drawings by the great master. Featuring cubist and impressionist (Still Life with Steer?s Skull, 1942; picture above) works that bear the unmistakable imprint of his creative genius and which defined trends in abstract art for generations to come, the show brings together a collection that promises to appeal to the tastes of all art lovers.

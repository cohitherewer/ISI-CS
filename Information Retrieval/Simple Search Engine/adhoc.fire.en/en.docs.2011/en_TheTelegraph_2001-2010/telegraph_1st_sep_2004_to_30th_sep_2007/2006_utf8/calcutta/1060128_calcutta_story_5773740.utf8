 The City Diary

 Calcutta 

High Court on Friday asked the state authorities to make the Kalighat Temple Committee 

furnish its lists of treasures, including the deity?s ornaments. The order followed 

a petition by a devotee, Pralhad Rai Goenka, who had alleged that the court-appointed 

panel had failed to run the temple. His other allegations were that funds collected 

by the temple management were not audited and that sebayets were selling 

palas to outsiders. A division bench, presided over by Chief Justice V.S. 

Sirpurkar, asked the petitioner to make the South 24-Parganas district judge a 

party to the case, as he was heading the committee. 

 At 

least 300 old state buses on various city routes will be replaced by new ones, 

transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said on Thursday. The new buses will be 

run by West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation and North Bengal State Transport 

Corporation. 

 The

K.J. Sengupta of the high court on Friday asked advocate Ananta Kumar Ghosh to 

visit Sree and Uttara cinemas, in north Calcutta, as a special officer. He will

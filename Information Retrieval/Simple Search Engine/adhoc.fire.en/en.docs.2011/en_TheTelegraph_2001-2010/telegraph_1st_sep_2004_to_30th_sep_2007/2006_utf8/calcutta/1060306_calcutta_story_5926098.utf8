 HC order on school flouted

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Two years ago, a division bench of the high court had ordered the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to appoint a headmaster in Sarsuna Hem Chandra Naskar Vidyapith, in Behala, the only secondary school of that area.

 But the court order is yet to be carried out. This has prompted the former secretary of the school to move a contempt petition against the state education department for flouting the court order.

 ?The school is being run without a headmaster for nearly three years and it has no elected managing committee. Some people of the area with political clout have forcibly taken over the charge of running the school. They are preventing the education department from appointing a headmaster in the institution,? alleged Ashok Jena, lawyer appearing for the petitioner, Subhash Chandra Sil. The school has nearly 1,000 students.

 Jena said ?on April 4, 2004, the division bench comprising former Chief Justice Ashok Kumar Mathur and Justice Ashim Kumar Ganguly, on a petition of my client, had asked the Board president to appoint someone selected by the School Service Commission headmaster of the school?.

 Sil stated in his petition: ?But surprisingly, the education department did not bother to carry out the court?s directive. As a result, the situation in the school is chaotic.? 

 In 2003, the state education department had appointed a headmaster at the school. 

 A member of the former school managing committee, Heerendra Nath Guha Roy, had moved a petition before the high court challenging the validity of the appointment. 

 Justice P.K. Roy had issued an injunction on the appointment. 

 But, Sil, then secretary of the school, had challenged the court order before the division bench of former Chief Justice Mathur and Justice Banerjee.

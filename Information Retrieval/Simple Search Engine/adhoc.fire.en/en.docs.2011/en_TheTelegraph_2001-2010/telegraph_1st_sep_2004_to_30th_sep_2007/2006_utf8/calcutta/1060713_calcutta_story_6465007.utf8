 SHRADHA AGARWAL LISTS THE FIVE MUST-HAVES IN A MANS WARDROBE TODAY

 A touch of pink

 Polo shirts, formal stripes, retro patterns or good ol solids, pink is the defining bottomline. Bubble-gum, candy, baby, salmon, shocking, hibiscus, hot, rose, the shade-card is as tempting as it gets. But its about time you gave in to the seasons hottest combo ? pink and blue denim. (The white shirt can please wait.)

 Check out the stocks at Cotton World, Ken amp; Tony Collection by Van Heusen, Provogue, Wills Lifestyle, Peter England, Arrow? In fact, a breezy browse through a Shoppers Stop, Westside and Pantaloons could convince you to don a pink, if you still arent, that is.

 PS: Just check with your girlfriend before a date; both of you in pink wont make such a pretty sight!

 Summer jackets

 Why let the climate dictate our way of fashion, asks model and grooming expert Nayanika Chatterjee about the concept of summer suits and jackets. Our feelings, precisely! So go ahead and sport the superstar layered look. Pick a linen jacket or a nice cotton blend. Self-textured, striped or plain, these jackets can be worn with contrast shirts or tees. Blackberrys and Van Heusen house summer suits.

PS: Keep the accessories subdued. The metallic clinks can wait for the graffiti tees.

 Cross-body bags

 College, school or internship, these body bags score high over girls when it comes to flaunting your style statement. Roomy and convenient, these sling bags pack in much more than you can imagine ? papers, bites, bytes, reads and beats? Tuck it all. Neatly.

 Hidesign has a classy collection of these bags, labelled Nor Cross. Laptop compatible, the contrast canvas straps lend a cool look. If fun is more your style, check out the psychedelic ones at Anokhi or go to Mams Diva at Forum. Superman or a glossy magazine print, the body bags are quite quirky. If your style statement tilts towards the sporty, check out Puma or Nike.

 PS: Dont feel weighed down by excess baggage; perk up that walking style.

 Fibre belts

 Move over leather. Move over high maintenance. Fibre belt it is. Canvas or denim, these belts are the way to go forward. Great for accessorising and perfect to complement canvas shoes, these belts can glam up any boring tee-and-denim combo. Lime, baby pink, turquoise, orange, red, white; rivets, studs or stripes? Choose from a riot of colours and designs. Raid the racks at Levis, Cotton World, SF Jeans and Benetton. These belts are a must-have.

 PS: Give your look a break; wear a light hued belt for that extra effect.

 Hair-styling products

 Long hair tied back or wavy hair left loose, the hair-raising adventure for men has just begun. As the number of guys opting for re-bonding shoots up and the general awareness about long hair grows, hair products for men are filling up rack space like never before. User-friendly and fuss-free, these help you create a fresh new look each day. Check out your neighbourhood supermarket for Brylcreem or Set Wet. High-end products from Wella or LOreal can be picked up from a professional salon.

 PS: Ask for a few extra tips the next time you visit the barber shop; small pointers can make so much of a difference to your hair style.

 Carriers join ranks for round trips

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Planning a holiday in Zurich or a business trip to Islamabad? Cursing the city for not having a direct flight to the destination?

 A solution is at hand, as se- veral international carriers have forged tie-ups to make Calcuttans? flight to Europe smoother.

 To start with, Swiss Air has entered into an agreement with Air Sahara and Jet Airways for Calcuttans willing to go on a holiday or business trip to Europe. 

 ?For the first time, we have come up with a unique offer of Rs 19,500 for a round trip to any European destination from Delhi. It is open till March 31. All a Calcuttan has to do is fly to Delhi with either Jet Airways or Air Sahara,? said a spokesperson for Swiss Air in Calcutta.

 Those eyeing Russia have found a saviour in Thai Airways. One has to catch a Thai flight from the city to Bangkok and the airline will take care of the rest.

 ?A round trip to Russia from Calcutta costs Rs 35,500. We have just opened up on this sector and hope to build a good customer base,? said S.C. Kapoor, district sales manager (Thai Airways).

 Round trips with similar facilities are also on offer for destinations like New York and Los Angeles (both Rs 47,000), or anywhere in Australia (Rs 27,000-plus) and New Zealand (Rs 37,000). Domestic carrier Kingfisher Airlines has tied up with Air Arabia, of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to fly Calcuttans to Sharjah for Rs 7,400-plus. 

 Air Arabia, the first international low-fare carrier in India, and Kingfisher Airlines have announced a first-ever pact between two web-based carriers, whereby passengers of both airlines will be able to connect to each other?s destinations through the UAE?s airline?s website. 

 ?This means Indian passengers from five of Kingfisher?s destinations will have convenient and affordable connectivity to the Gulf,? said a Kingfisher spokesman.

 Rohit Ramachandran, manager (India) Air Arabia said: ?The partnership will boost our commitment to offer affordable travel to customers.? 

 Fliers and travel agents both have welcomed the alliance.

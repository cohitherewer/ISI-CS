The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ICSE student killed

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Forty-eight hours after he sailed through his ICSE exams, Sayan Ganguly, 17, fell victim to rash driving on a city road in north Calcutta on Friday afternoon. He was crushed under the rear wheels of a private bus on route no. 3. 

 The tragedy occurred around 12.45 pm. Sayan, who was standing on the footboard of the bus, fell off after the driver suddenly accelerated the vehicle on Bhupen Bose Avenue, in front of Shyam Park. He was run over by the rear wheels. 

 Bystanders rushed the profusely-bleeding Sayan to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. 

 Later, a large crowd gathered on the spot and held a demonstration for 15 minutes. It protested the police failure to check rash driving and crack down on rogue drivers. 

 According to Dulal Chandra Dey, officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station, Sayan was a brilliant student. ?He had bagged high grades in three subjects and was returning home when the tragedy struck. He fell off the bus when the driver accelerated while trying to overtake another bus. The rogue driver was arrested and the vehicle impounded,? Dey told Metro. 

 Sayan was the only child. He lived with his parents at 60/2, Raja Rajballabh Street, in Bagbazar. 

 Investigations revealed that Sayan had gone to a relative?s house on Bhupen Bose Avenue to celebrate his exam success. 

 ?His relatives were very happy after he came out with flying colours in the exam and had invited him to celebrate the occasion. Around 12.20 pm, he boarded the bus to return home, where his parents were waiting to have lunch together. Unfortunately, he died on the way to hospital,? an investigating officer of the police station said. 

 Sayan wanted to be a doctor and was a sincere student. ?His parents were devastated after we broke the news. His mother fainted several times,? the officer added.

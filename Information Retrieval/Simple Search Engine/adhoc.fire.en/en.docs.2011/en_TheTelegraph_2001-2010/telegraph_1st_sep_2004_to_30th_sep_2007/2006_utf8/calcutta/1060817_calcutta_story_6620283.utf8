The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Daily dose of drama in life

 Thats what ANURAG BASU hopes to capture in Metro. He tells Pratim D. Gupta about life after Gangster, his first-choice cast, Kangana and Konkona 

 Sharman Joshi, Shilpa 

 Shetty, Anurag Basu, Shiney Ahuja, UTV executive producer 

 Ram Mirchandani and Kay Kay Menon at the launch of Metro 

 in Mumbai

 What is your new film Metro all about?

 I have been toying with the idea of Metro for a long time. Theres so much drama in our daily lives. We dont climb mountains or loot banks, yet our lives are so eventful. So many stories are born out of the situations we go through every day. These vignettes of ideas took the shape of a film. The main theme of the film is how personal relationships are affected in a big city. Love takes a backseat under the pressure of paying EMIs.

 It sounds more real than anything you have done before

 It is much more real because we are addressing real issues. Of course, everything is being done in a commercial format. These are different slices of life even though the characters are all related to each other. Like theres Shikha, played by Shilpa Shetty, who got married to Kay Kays (Menon) character at a young age. They have a house, AC, car, TV but after nine years they are strangers under the same roof.

 Then we have Shineys (Ahuja) character who always topped college in his small town and everyone felt he would end up being someone huge. But he cannot cope when hes thrown into the fast big city. Sharman (Joshi) and Kangana (Ranaut) work in a call centre. For them, their coffee and pizza are everything; they can mortgage their life for these. Then theres the Irrfan-Konkona story. Irrfan plays a man going through the 30-plus syndrome.

 Youve got a bizarre cast from arthouse veterans like Irrfan, 

 Konkona and Kay Kay to mainstream heartthrobs like Shilpa 

 and now Shiney

 The best thing about the cast is that I didnt have to go for a second choice for any of the characters. I have been very lucky to have got whoever I wanted for every role. Shiney and Kangana, of course, were on board from the time I was making Gangster, since I came up with the story at that time. Kay Kay and Irrfan are old friends with whom I have worked on TV projects before. 

 Konkonas casting was very interesting. After reading the script she said that she had not played this character before. Shes played a mother, a daughter, a journo but not this. Konkona plays this big city girl who is busy building her career and then at 28-29 she realises she is still a virgin. Theres nobody in her life. Shes missed the bus and now looks up websites like shaadi.com.

 I am always a phone call away for 

 her, says Anurag Basu about his Gangster find 

 Kangana Ranaut

 Why did you leave Vishesh Films and work with UTV for the 

 project?

 See, the story was ready for quite some time. The only reason I shifted to UTV for this film is because I wanted to grow. Vishesh Films have their own production unit and their system of working is different. You have to direct the movie with their production crew. Now, my own production staff, which used to work on my TV projects, is without work for quite some time. So I would have them working on Metro. I will also be the executive producer for the film. I want to know this art and that wouldnt have been possible had I been with Vishesh Films.

 How has Mahesh Bhatt taken this move of yours? Everyones 

 writing that you have back-stabbed your godfather

 Let everyone write what they want to. Bhattsaab is as involved with Metro as he is with any of his productions directed by me. He is and will always be my bounce-board. I am directing my next film Suicide Bomber for Vishesh Films. So theres no change whatsoever in our relationship.

 But isnt Subhash Ghai also in queue?

 Yes, after seeing Gangster he approached me to make a film for him. He said, You can make whatever you like. But as of now I have no idea what I will make and when I will make it. Right now I have already started shooting Metro, which I should finish by October. Pujor por, around end-November, the film should release. By then, Bhattsaab will finish the Suicide Bomber script and I will start working on that.

 The Gangster songs are still rocking every music 

 chart. What can we expect from the Metro soundtrack?

 Metro will also have music by Pritam. But the sound will be very different. We are experimenting again. We are going for a completely band sound this time. We are hoping it will be as popular.

 Your find Kangana is going great guns

 I feel very proud and happy for her. Bhishon bhalo lage. Bhattsaab called up to tell me how improved she is in Mohits (Suri) Woh Lamhe. I am always a phone call away for her if she needs any advice or guidance.

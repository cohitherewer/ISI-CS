 Trader shot near pandal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Eatery owner Durjoy Dey, 28, was found murdered near a puja pandal close to his residence in Kanchangarh, Sodepur, early on Sunday. 

 Police said the body bore a bullet wound and several other injuries. Eight people have been arrested for the murder, which took place around 3.30 am. 

 The bullet on the left of the chest and several cuts suggest that Durjoy was brutally killed. But we are yet to find a motive, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar. We are confident of extracting information from those we have taken into custody. A hunt is on for another person.

 Officers probing the case revealed that business rivalry could have led to the killing. Dey was reportedly having problems running a motorcycle showroom in partnership. According to the cops, Dey was drinking with nine other men near the pandal. A quarrel broke out that resulted in one of them shooting Dey from close range. He was also hit with a blunt object.

 We are now looking for Sudeb Das, who is absconding, said additional superintendent, Barrackpore, Basab Dasgupta. As all the men were drunk and are accusing one another, we have to record their statements carefully. The revolver has been seized.

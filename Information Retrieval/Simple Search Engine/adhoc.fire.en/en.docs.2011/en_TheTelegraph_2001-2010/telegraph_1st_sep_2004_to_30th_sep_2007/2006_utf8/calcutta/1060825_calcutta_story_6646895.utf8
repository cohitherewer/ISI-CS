 The Union ministry of health might have given a clean chit to soft drinks, but the state government will have to wait at least another week for the official report on pesticide contamination from National Test House in Salt lake.

 National Test House, a network of six laboratories across the country with headquarters in Calcutta, is a wing of the consumer affairs department of the central government. 

 It conducts all kinds of tests, but its area of expertise is industrial testing. The institute has recently ventured into food and beverage testing after having commissioned a new GCMS instrument.

 We are working on the soft drink samples sent by the state food and consumer affairs department. The report is likely to be submitted by the month-end, institute director R.N. Mukherjee told Metro.

 There are various methodologies of testing pesticides in liquid samples and we would like to be absolutely certain before submitting the results to the state government, added Mukherjee.

 According to the scientists, a larger sample size would have made their job easier. The consumer affairs department has reportedly sent only two bottles of soft drinks to National Test House for tests.

 While the Centre detected almost no contamination in the soft drinks, the tests conducted by some of the states have found pesticides above the proposed standard.

 Even West Bengal Pollution Control Board has found pesticides marginally above the limit, though far less than what Centre for Science and Environment claimed.

 National Test House, which on an average conducts more than 50,000 tests a year, is called upon by both the central and state governments to handle almost all critical tests.

 The City Diary

 Police are trying to solve the case of the murder of a 40-year-old man whose decomposed body was found in an apartment at Baruipur, in South 24-Parganas, on Monday, with the help of sketches by experts in the CID. The sketches are of the people who were last seen with the victim. Although sleuths are certain that the man had been strangled, the investigation so far has drawn a blank. Three persons have been detained for interrogation.

 What: 

 Launch of a range of Ganesha idols. 

 Where: Prana at 13/3 Ballygunge 

 Circular Road.

 When: August 23.

 Take a look: On the occasion of Ganesha Chaturthi, the brand Episode displayed a range of theme-based contemporary and stylised Ganeshas in pure sterling silver. 

 The assortment of Ganesha idols has been created with concepts from mythology and each Ganesha mudra has a story to tell. There are 21 designs on offer. Significant among them are Writing Ganesha, Buddhi Suddhi Ganesha, Dancing Ganesha, Shivaling Ganesha, Jhoola Ganesha, Rudrapriya Ganesha and Vigneswara Ganesha.

 Pocket pinch: The idols are priced between Rs 275 and Rs 5 lakh.

 Ritual rhythm

 What: Prithvi, a dance recital by Priti Patels Anjika.

 Where: The Palladian Lounge, Bengal Chamber of Commerce.

 When: August 25, evening.

 Take a look: The 45-minute dance recital was a tribute to Mother Earth through ritualistic Manipuri dance. Based on the pre and post-Vaishnavite forms of the classical dance, Priti and her troupe staged group performances, solos and duet acts.

 The stage was an extension of the lounge itself, bedecked with shimmering white drapes in the background and Oriental wooden masks strewn on the edges of the floor.

 The performers dressed in shades of black, white and red swayed and twirled to the lyrical music of mridanga, flute, cymbals and other traditional Manipuri instruments.

 Following a narration on the ritualistic traditions of Manipuri dance by film-maker Ashoke Viswanathan, the performance delved into the deep and lasting relationship between the life-giving qualities of earth and its ill-treatment by humanity.

 Pritis effortless moves displayed imaginative skills woven into the stylised classical dance form.

 The recital was interspersed with voiceovers and musical compositions with light vocal strains alternating with hymns and chants. Displaying a variety of actions, poses and expressions, the male dancers of Anjika left a lasting impression. The audience was spellbound by their martial arts skills and swirling moves with swords, spears and shields.

 Chunky chic

 What: Preview of Itisha, a fashion jewellery line from designer Aditi Sen Gupta.

 Take a look: Itisha is all about neckpieces, very unusually contemporary. Oxidised and plated silver, leather, glass, Jaipur semi-precious stones, shells, wood, bones, coconut shells, mother of pearl and metal have been mixed and matched to make chunky neckpieces. The designs are a blend of floral and geometric shapes.

 Currently available at Taj Khazana in Delhi and Goa Exotica Khazana, Itisha will soon be launched at Prana, the lifestyle store on Ballygunge Circular Road. Talks are on with other leading fashion destinations in the city, reveals Aditi.

 Pocket pinch: The price tag reads Rs 300-plus.

 Voiceover: My jewellery draws inspiration from things around me that hold my interest. I plan to venture into earrings soon, smiles Aditi.

 Still ?part of the Padatik creative family tree?, Ronnie Shambik Ghose and Mitul Ghose Sengupta launched the Rhythmosaic Dance Company on Saturday. ?Ever since I finished training in the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, I wanted to make a mark and give Indian dance practitioners and viewers a different outlook,? said Ghose. 

 Mitul, having trained in classical Kathak, represents the classical Indian dance forms, while Ronnie gives his inputs in western classical and contemporary dance techniques.

 Their first performance, a series of movements involving beginners and professionals, was a seamless blend of jazz, chhau, classical ballet, kathak and contemporary dance of the Martha Graham school. 

 The first item, Sonata, was entertaining with lively kathak chakkars and jazz moves. The performers (Padatik junior kathak students) appeared in silver, sea green and blue. The last one, Fear, had the performers (Ronnie, Mitul and Suman) dressed in black.

 Unlike the item immediately preceding, Pain (for which Ronnie assisted Chetna Jalan in interpreting Sangeeta Bandhopadhyay?s text), Fear has no voiceovers or music. Dancers use their body language to depict this basic human emotion which is at once elusive, contagious and overwhelming. The silence is broken only by sudden shrieks and a constant ticking towards the end. 

 The other items in the show were Vama, a solo by Mitul focusing on the emotional odyssey of a woman, and Canvas, a montage of dynamic images presented by Rhythmosaic and Padatik Kathak repertory. Members of Rhythmosaic are always going to be highly trained, claims Ronnie. 

 The problem in Calcutta and in other places across the country is that dancers today are not willing to undergo regular training, said Ronnie. ?Everybody here is talented but they should realise that a two-day workshop cannot make you a dancer. Whenever you execute a movement on stage, it should look grammatically correct,? he said. The company is looking for new dancers aged from 11 to 32 who are willing to slog for technical excellence. Fear seems to be a signature piece for this company.

 To kill a mocking bird

 Based on a tale from Upendra Kishore Roychowdhurys The Book of Tuntuni, a collection of bedtime stories for children, Furrut is a delightful comic satire that makes a mockery of state authority and establishment. King Habuchandra is annoyed as a naughty little bird is stealing valuable items from the royal treasure everyday. He asks his counsels to shelve all state affairs and catch the bird, but it always manages to give them the slip. The tiny creatures constant ridiculing of the king and his ministers makes the king so furious that, when it is finally caught, he asks his seven queens to fry the bird for him to eat. But the clever bird escapes once again. To evade the kings anger, they serve him a fried frog instead. When the king comes to know of this, he punishes his queens by cutting off their noses. When the bird is caught again, the king swallows it, but the bird churns in his stomach so violently that he has to belch it out in haste. The kings sentinels, ready to slaughter the bird when it pops out of his mouth, swing their swords all at once. The bird flies away and the king loses his nose instead. Direction: Raja Bhattacharya.

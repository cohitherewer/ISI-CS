 Whos the smartest of them all? Going by what young mothers outside Montessories have to say, the search invariably ends with the youngest child who can write from A to Z with the fastest fingers.

 But a recent study by the National Focus Group for Early Childhood Education, commissioned by the NCERT, gives such push-em-hard parents a thumbs down. The position paper highlights the perils of the pencil push among tots.

 Parents, it says, from all walks of life and at all levels have little or no awareness about the significance of this period in the life of their children... (they) believe in the importance of an early start for their children, supposedly for their later educational achievements and hence chances to achieve upward social mobility.

 The study points out that curriculum surveys in all major cities have indicated that children as young as three/four years old are being taught the syllabus prescribed not only for Class I but even for Class II, for which they are neither cognitively nor physically mature enough.

 It is to teach the parents a lesson that Eurokids, a playgroup major, organised a seminar last weekend. As the tots played next door, right-handed parents were handed pencil and paper and told to write with their left hands. The effort that went into this exercise was meant to focus on another observation in the study: Children at this stage are not ready for writing, and struggle for hours at this task.

 Soma Patra, regional academic co-ordinator-east of Eurokids International, issued a plea: Please understand that playschools are different from regular schools. What they are supposed to learn here are pre-writing skills. Dont force your child to stop liking the experience of writing even before his education begins. 

 Ashok Modi, paediatrician at Bhagirathi Neotia Woman amp; Child Care Centre, who addressed the gathering, felt pushing children towards the alphabets before they are ready kills the curiosity that is vital for their development. 

 It is accepted that left to himself, a child can draw a straight line by the time he is two, a circle by three years and a square by four years. The triangle, being the most complex, takes another year.

 So, one can well imagine what sort of stress is caused to a young mind forced to write the alphabets. This stress saw Devarshi Gupta throwing tantrums when it was time for him to go to school. All because, as mother Mansi Gupta discovered, the three-year-old was being made to write in school. Now that there are no writing exercises, he loves going there, she said.

 And its not just mind over matter. According to Patra, the right hand muscles are delicate in a two-year-old. All he should do is dab, doodle, scribble and paint, that too with crayons. A wood pencil damages muscles, she warned.

 Anju Gupta of Ripon Street admitted to having taught three-year-old Ansh A to L at home. He was doing it on a slate. I was trying to make him write on paper. But she promised to now let him be. 

 Parents blamed the school admission tests for their eagerness. Its strange how a child is asked to identify a panda when all they have seen around them is a dog, exclaimed Leena Singh, mother of 23-month-old Shivane.

 Her only hope is the Supreme Court ruling forbidding schools from interviewing children. Otherwise, theres no end in sight for the early start to tot torment.

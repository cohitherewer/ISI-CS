 First of a kind: A moment from Vicky 

 Aur Vetaal

 Disney Channel has just launched its first major original production in Vicky Aur Vetaal on October 8. This is the channels first original live action series in Hindi.

 We seek to strengthen connections with kids and their families by developing creative, quality local content that reflects the lives of the local audiences, said Nicky Parkinson, senior vice-president and managing director, Walt Disney Television International (Asia Pacific). This major initiative is a strong step forward in establishing Disney Channel further as a committed local player in this country, and also a reflection of the Walt Disney Companys commitment to seeking more from the global marketplace.

 A modern day spin-off of an ancient Indian tale, Vicky Aur Vetaal is a comedy, featuring the tale of two unlikely heroes, both reluctantly stuck with each other and constantly getting into and out of trouble. Seasoned kids programming director Suraj Rao, Parineeta music duo Shantanu Moitra and Swanand Kirkire, singer Babul Supriyo and production house Cinevistaas Limited have joined forces with Disney Channel to produce this original series. 

 Airing every Sunday at 10.30 am, Vicky Aur Vetaal is meant to contemporise and keep it relevant to todays generation.

 In a unique theme-driven marketing campaign, Disney has targeted touch-points at McDonalds and other outlets frequented by kids.

 Arts varsity eyes science foray

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A centre of excellence in arts will soon open its door to science and technology.

 Rabindra Bharati University (RBU), which offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses only in performing and visual arts and humanities, will start enrolling students pursuing a career in science. 

 The brush with science will kick off with an undergraduate course in mathematics in the next academic session.

 ?Our institution has been imparting quality education in fine arts and humanities for decades. Now, we need to expand and make forays into the field of science and technology,? said vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee. The expansion, she added, was a necessity to meet the increasing demand for science and technology subjects among students.

 ?The state government has approved our plan to open a department for mathematics. The course will be introduced from the next academic session,? Mukherjee confirmed.

 A series of meetings have been held between university officials and the state government to thrash out the details of the new courses.

 Founded in May 1962, to mark the birth centenary of Rabindranath Tagore, the university has been pursuing its goal of promoting integration of the nation?s cultural heritage, in conformity with the thoughts and ideas of the poet. 

 The RBU Act, based on which the state-aided institution is run, allows the university to offer courses only in arts and related subjects.

 ?Preparations are on to bring about the necessary amendments to enable the university to take up science and technology,? a senior official in the state higher education department said. 

 ?The RBU can manage the new courses. It has adequate space and resources to build up the required infrastructure,? the official added.

 Students seeking admission to B.Sc and M.Sc courses will go up manifold in the next few years, far outnumbering the existing colleges. An indicator to the rise could be the projected turnout in this year?s Madhyamik ? six lakh, three lakh more than last year.

 Trade body bid to boost agriculture business

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 With chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee laying special emphasis on promoting agri-business in Bengal, Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has launched an initiative to provide a fillip to the primary sector. 

 A forum will look into the interests of all the stakeholders and work out an action plan to realise the states potential in agro and food processing industries, said Rajeev Singh, the newly-appointed secretary general of the city-based chamber. 

 Last month, the chamber representatives met Bhattacharjee to apprise him of the initiative, for which the ICC has joined hands with IIT Kharagpur, Jadavpur University, Indian Institute of Packaging, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Tea Board and various other state and central government bodies. 

 The chief minister has asked the chamber to come up with policy inputs and suggestions to address the existing imbalances. 

 We have observed that around 30 per cent of the produce gets wasted at the farm level and so there is a pressing need for tie-ups between producers and buyers. Various models can be explored to meet the objective, stated Singh. He stressed the need for retail outlets and growth centres across the state. 

 ICC is suggesting setting up of five to six agri-business growth centres across the state to train budding entrepreneurs and factory and field supervisors. The centres will act as information hubs and will offer testing facilities and house permanent exhibition and display corners. 

 The government has agreed in principle to allow such centres at food parks. This will require an investment of Rs 18 to Rs 20 crore, observed Singh. 

 The chamber will conduct studies to prepare a comprehensive action plan for the agro and food processing industries in Bengal. Besides, it will also take trade delegations abroad to expose industry representatives to the best practices.

 A chamber delegation, along with representatives from the state government, will be visiting France next month.

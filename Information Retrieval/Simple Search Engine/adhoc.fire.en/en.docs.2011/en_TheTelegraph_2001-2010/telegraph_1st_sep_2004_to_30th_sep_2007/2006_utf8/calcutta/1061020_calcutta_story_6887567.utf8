 Towering too tall? 

 The goddess being taken for immersion. A Telegraph picture 

 This is with reference to the report Puja threat 

 to trees, September 6. While every year trees are savagely 

 trimmed or cut down for the festivities, precious little 

 seems to be done about this. 

 It is all very well for the deputy conservator of urban forestry and the mayoral council member (parks and gardens) to issue a statement on the harmful effects of tree trimming and sound stern warnings against the practice, but they will remain unheeded. 

 It is absurd that for a four-day festival, branches that have taken years to grow are chopped off. Also, when trimming is done on one side, the other side of the tree becomes heavier, increasing its chances of toppling over. 

 According to the report, meetings were held this year between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, police and the puja committees to discuss the issue. Such meetings are pointless the puja committees will never be as concerned about ecological balance as about bigger idols and wilder celebrations. 

 A rigid and enforceable ceiling should be set on the height of idols and their carriers. The authorities should ensure that trimming is not done on flimsy grounds like better illumination and visibility for billboards. There should be helplines at all police stations for the public to complain about tree cutting. Most importantly, the authorities should punish the guilty without any bias.

 A few days before the publication of the article Dunlop demolition stayed, September 14, a friend and I were roaming around the Dunlop House. Seeing the condition of the building, my friend had remarked: We are careless and neglectful towards our heritage. The truth in his words has been borne out once again. Should the Writers Buildings now be torn down and replaced with a modern construction? If yes, then all the heritage structures in the city should be demolished. If no, then the construction of a shopping mall in place of Dunlop House should be stopped.

 Apropos the report Ray risk in fluorescent lamps, September 13, it is a matter of great concern that popular compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) might cause serious health hazards. There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the scientists report in this regard. The sale of CFLs without ultraviolet filters should be banned. Otherwise, the lamp packets should at least carry a warning.

 The findings of the Electronics 

 Regional Test Laboratory need to be taken seriously. More 

 and more people are now replacing tubelights with CFLs, 

 obviously to slash electricity bills and without knowledge 

 of the side-effects.

 With every lighting company producing CFLs, the sale of ordinary 

 lamps has gone down drastically. CFLs are even being used 

 in marriages. It is time the government bans CFLs to safeguard 

 peoples health.

 Apropos the report Buses in a hurry leave three dead, September 8, I was on a motorcycle behind the school bus. The two pedestrians were not trying to cross the road, but were standing on the pavement when the bus hit them. Along with another motorcyclist, I followed the bus. We repeatedly asked the driver to stop but he didnt until he rammed the vehicle into a taxi near the Hazra crossing. There were 34 schoolchildren in the bus. I called up a teacher of the school to inform him about the accident.

 Online lotteries should not be banned for the same reason automobiles are not banned even though they kill people (Cops fall for lottery lure, September 15). If the families of policemen are ending up in dire straits because of online lotteries, many are also earning fortunes by the same means. The politicians calling for a ban are not doing so out of concern for the people. A ban will only result in a boom in gambling and revenue loss for the government.

 The column So near and yet so far, September 17, was refreshing. While Uttam Kumar is rightly acknowledged as a brand even today, Suchitra Sen does not command as much reverence. Is it because she is a woman?

 Apropos Tryst with Tagore, September 13, Rituparna Sengupta is a talented actress but she lacks the softness and depth to be Labanya in Shesher Kobita. She would have been suitable for one of the smaller roles.

 Jazzing up January

 SUBHRO SAHA

 New year notes

 Happy New Year, jazz devotees. If the right chords are struck, the January air in Calcutta could be filled by the strains of Watermelon Man or the passionate keys of Cantaloop rendered by the man himself.

 For Herbie Hancock (in picture ), among the last living legends of jazz, could open The Kolkata JazzFest 07 at Dalhousie Institute with his current quintet. The fest is slated for the third week of the New Year.

 Yes, theres a very strong possibility he will come and perform in the city, on January 18 or 19, as part of a multi-city Indian tour, Douglas Kelly, director of American Center, tells GoodLife.

 The US cultural institute is trying to steer multiple Grammy-winner Hancock to Calcutta as the top draw of the four-day event (tentatively, between January 18 and 23) organised by Congo Square, a non-profit society promoting jazz and blues music in the city.

 If he does make it, this would be Hancocks second trip to Calcutta after his Kala Mandir performance in 1996 with students of the Thelonius Monk Institute.

 We are awaiting final confirmation from American Center, but hope for the sake of Calcuttas fervent jazz lovers that he can come and make music at the festival, reveals Congo Square spokesperson Ashok Banerjee.

 Hancock has treaded fluidly through every development in acoustic and electric jazz and R amp;B since the 60s. The Herbie Hancock Quintet now features Lionel Loueke (guitar), Lili Haydn (violin), Matt Garrison (bass) and Richie Barshay (drums). The ensemble is now touring Europe after Hancocks latest studio album of duets Possibilities, where he has played with the likes of John Mayer, Damien Rice, Sting, Joss Stone, Paul Simon and Carlos Santana.

 In addition to the multiple Grammies under his belt, Hancock also won an Oscar in 1986 for his score in the movie Round Midnight in which he acted as well.

 Born in Chicago in 1940, a child prodigy who performed a Mozart piano concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11, Hancock has collaborated with the likes of Joni Mitchell, Stevie Wonder, Kathleen Battle, Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea.

 The late Miles Davis, whom Hancock inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in New York earlier this year, had said of him: Herbie was the step after Bud Powell and Thelonius Monk, and I havent heard anybody yet who has come after him. No wonder jazz buffs in town are keeping their fingers crossed.

 The rest of the January JazzFest cast is firmed up, though. Besides the Julie Lewis Trio from Israel, another Brazilian group after last years sensation Mandu Sarara, the Muari Vieira Trio with Muari on nylon string guitar, Walter Pinheiro on sax and flute and Tania Murakami on piano is being billed as a top draw.

 aying a different tune will be Auto Rickshaw, a Canadian group with Suba Sankaran (vocals, piano, percussion), Ed Henley (tabla), Rich Brown, one of the most sought-after bass players in Toronto and Debasish Sinha on Greek and Turkish drums.

 We will have a jazz act from Cuba, while The Three Raags will be back with Steve Rudolph, says Banerjee. A Hungarian jazz group, Cornelio Tutu, sponsored by the Hungarian government, and the Eric Trussaz Quartet from France courtesy The French Association, complete the JazzFest roster.

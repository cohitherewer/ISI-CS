 Preoccupied with our struggles for daily sustenance, we have all but forgotten to delight in the simple pleasures of life. The sheer ecstasy of falling in love and the excitement of a blossoming romance are experiences completely alien to the prosaic routine of our humdrum existence. Providing welcome relief to our arid souls is Rang-Roop?s Shesh Raksha. One of Tagore?s most popular romantic comedies, the play provides a frank portrayal of human emotions, passions and sensibilites. A tightly-knit plot and vivid characterisation, combined with Tagore?s refined, sophisticated dialogues, seasoned with racy wit and intelligent humour, enable the play to attain heights of dramatic excellence. It introduces us to four young people ? Indumati, Gadai, Kamalmukhi and Binod ? whose uncertain, oscillating romantic fortunes we follow with anxious anticipation till the very end. Direction: Seema Mukherjee.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Shesh Raksha, produced by Rang-Roop

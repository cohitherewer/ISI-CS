 Doctor?s glasses found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after the recovery of the briefcase of murdered doctor Jayanta Ghosh, officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Thursday claimed to have found a pair of glasses with black frames, possibly belonging to Ghosh.

 They also seized a car in Salt Lake but could not ascertain if it was the vehicle that had taken him to Murshidabad. 

 The body of the Salt Lake-based doctor was found with his throat slit on a bridge across the Mayurakshi river, in Murshidabad, on the morning of March 7.

 ?Spectacles with black frames were found on the spot where Ghosh?s body was dumped. It seems the killers forced him to wear the glasses so that he would not be recognised. A car was also seized in the Salt Lake area. We are trying to make sure whether it was the car used by the criminals,? a senior CID officer said on Thursday afternoon.

 He added that several cars had been impounded over the past few days, but questioning their drivers yielded no clues.

 Police assert that the doctor was being blackmailed for some time, and he himself had something to hide. He had, perhaps, agreed to accompany the killers as he wanted something to be resolved. They are looking into the possibility of a woman being involved in the case. 

 ?Nothing conclusive has emerged 

 so far,? admitted D.P. Tarenia, inspector-general of police 

 (II) CID.

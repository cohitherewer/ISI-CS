 When the abstract voices of theatre, poetry and music meet and interact, there is a unique confluence, the kind one can experience at GD Birla Sabhagar on July 28. Triveni, featuring readings from Joy Goswami?s poems, Bratya Basu?s plays and alaaps by veteran classical vocalist Ulhas Kashalkar will offer an alternative perspective on death, the Divine and love.

 ?Love, god and death involve the greatest human experiences and concepts ? though we probably find it easier to talk about the first one ? and they have equally inspired the poet, the artist, the musician and the dramatist,? explained poet Joy Goswami during a rehearsal on Tuesday.

 The idea came to him from his reading of Bratya Basu?s new (yet to be produced) play Mrityu, Ishwar, Jauno. Thinking back to his own poems on the subject and listening to Ulhas Kashalkar?s Bhairav Bahar, which communicates ?the subtle interactions between the indifferent yogi Bhairav and Bahar, the young girl personifying spring?, he wondered why something similar could not be attempted with the various media of artistic expression.

 For Bratya Basu, this is a welcome quest for new horizons in art. ?From A+B+C there may emerge a D or an E, something completely different. This may be considered an excuse for like-minded people to get together and share their creativity. Or it may be considered the much-needed inquiry into the status of art, which way its path lies, whether it can reach a new level and how people respond to it,? said Basu. 

 Basu will read excerpts from his plays like Ashaleen, Babli, Mrityu, Ishwar, Jauno and the yet-to-be-staged Dorjiparar Marjinara. This will be combined with excerpts from Joy Goswami?s collections Surjopora Chhaee, Ma Nishaad, Hariner Janyo Ekak and E Bhoomi and Kashalkar?s alaaps. 

 The performance may begin with Kashalkar?s rendition of raga Marwa, which Goswami feels ?captures the sense of darkness closing in, which one associates with death?. 

 Strung only on experiences and beliefs, these nuggets of poetry, theatre and music will lead on to Prem, and the season of rains.

 ?With no tickets for the show, we hope to create a new platform and also pass on the benefits to Project Surjo, which looks after street children,? said a member of the organiser, Picasso.

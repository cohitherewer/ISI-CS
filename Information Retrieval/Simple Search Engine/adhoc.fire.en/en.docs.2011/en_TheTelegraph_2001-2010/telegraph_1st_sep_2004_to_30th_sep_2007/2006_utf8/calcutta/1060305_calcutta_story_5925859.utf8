 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The occasion was to felicitate scholastic achievements, but there was nothing academic or serious about it. Venom, the latest nightspot in town, was the unusual venue for British Council honouring recipients of this years Chevening scholarships, on Friday evening.

 There were scholars past and present in attendance and a touch of Tollywood was provided by actress Pallavi Chatterjee. Once the certificates were handed over, it was time to appreciate achievements of a different kind ? those in the world of music videos.

 Antenna, a collection of recent music videos from the UK, presented some of the finest creations in contemporary British music.

 The Gallery section showcased work ranging from new faces like Nima Nourizadeh to veterans like Dougal Wilson. The directors profile featured the animation and live action directing collective, Shynola.

 Gallery was a visual and sonic treat. The opening video of Future Shocks Late At Night, directed by Ne-, stood out for being composed entirely of still photographs. The one that followed, Chikinkis Like It Or Leave It directed by Si amp;Ad, was a play on perspectives shot entirely in camera and without post-production effects.

 The ride continued through Architecture In Helsinkis Do The Whirlwind (directed by Nima Nourizadeh), Boomclicks High Tide (Ben Rollason), Jimmy Edgars Is This A Real City? (Ben Dawkins) and more.

 The directors special on Shynola offered several music videos done by the quartet of Gideon Baws, Chris Harding, Richard Kenny Kenworthy and Jason Groves for artistes ranging from Radiohead (Blipverts, The Pyramid Song) to The Rapture (House of Jealous Lovers) and Blur (Good Song).

 The members of Shynola had met in 1994 at The Kent Institute of Art and Design. Once out of college, their break came in 1999 with the short film The Littlest Robo. Soon, they were making music videos and collecting awards.

 GROUND Zero

 Theyre yet to decide whether they will turn professional music-makers, but the members of Zero would love to chuck their day jobs, only if music would pay their bills.

 Back to rock Calcutta after two years, the Mumbai-based band, admittedly, is at a critical juncture in its career, looking for the next big step.

 Were planning to go international and try promoting the band by ourselves at the same time, says vocalist Rajeev, ahead of the bands Saturday night out at The Parks Someplace Else.

 Zero began as a fun band in 1998. We were just a group of friends living close to each other in Dadar, Mumbai, who would often jam together, recalls Rajeev, now an adman.

 Though playing covers was the usual early route to trek, the band soon got tired of the much-trodden path.

 Our collection of original compositions was growing. But it was tough playing them in shows, says Rajeev. The band would draw a blank with organisers in the first few years, when told they would like to do their own stuff. The crowds reacted no better.

 But the scene, Rajeev feels, has changed today. People are actually looking for new and original songs.

 In 2000, Zero recorded its first album, Albummed, at home. We had no money and were just getting into playing around with music software.

 Two years later, a more professionally recorded Hook sold around 6,000 copies. Besides pricing the album at a mere Rs 50, the band actively encouraged listeners to copy and spread their music.

 With Procrastination, the latest offering, Zero plans to manage its music through Counter Culture, the label launched by Bobby, the bands bassist and Rajeevs brother.

 Mumbai is where Zero is rooted firmly with no plans of shifting base. We simply love Mumbai too much, laughs Rajeev.

 Up ahead is a tour of the UK, part of the winnings at the Great Indian Rock competition two years ago. Were also talking to organisers in Canada to explore touring options there, offers Rajeev.

 Last time around, Calcutta had offered a crazy response to the sound of Zero ? rock but not metal. This time, when it takes the stage with Louiz Bankss son Gino on drums, the band hopes it will only be crazier.

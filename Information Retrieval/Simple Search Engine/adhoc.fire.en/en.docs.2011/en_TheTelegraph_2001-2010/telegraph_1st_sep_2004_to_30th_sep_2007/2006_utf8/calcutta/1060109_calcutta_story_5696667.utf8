The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The traffic is chaotic on the stretch of EM Bypass in front of Ruby General 

Hospital. Pedestrians find it difficult to cross the road near the Kasba Gol Park 

intersection. The traffic cops deployed in the area are insufficient in number. 

Since the traffic along EM Bypass is only going to increase in the future, it 

would be advisable to construct an underground subway for pedestrians. The footpaths 

should be kept free of encroachments and barricaded. Care should also be taken 

to ensure that the traffic lights function properly all the time.

 There?s a spot near the Airtel office on Park Street where pedestrians urinate 

frequently. Once, I even saw a traffic cop urinating on the wall, on which the 

civic authorities have ironically written ?Keep your city clean?. It?s sad that 

no one seems to care. 

 Zeeshan Roohullah, Park Street. 

 According to BSNL?s website, there is a pre-paid mobile phone recharge card 

of Rs 77. However, I have failed to find a card of that denomination in the BSNL 

service centres and elsewhere in the city. If the pre-paid card is available only 

outside Calcutta, why isn?t BSNL mentioning that on its website?

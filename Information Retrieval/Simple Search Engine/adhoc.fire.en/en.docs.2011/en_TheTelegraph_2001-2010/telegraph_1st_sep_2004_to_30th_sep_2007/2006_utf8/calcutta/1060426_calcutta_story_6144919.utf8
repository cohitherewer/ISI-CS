The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wanted find sanctuary

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Munna Bajrangi: Wanted by UP police in several extortion 

 and murder cases. UP police suspect he frequently visits 

 Calcutta and had once stayed for a couple of days in Garden 

 Reach. The city police have been put on alert.

 Mohammed Atiq: Wanted in 40-odd murder 

 and extortion cases in Kanpur. Suspected to be holed up 

 in Calcutta. Younger brother Mohammed Rafique was arrested 

 in Entally last year by a team of the Kanpur police. Atiq 

 has contacts in Bangladesh.

 Sher Singh Rana?s is not a one-off case ? Calcutta is fast emerging as an ?oasis of peace? for goons on the run. Ten such criminals have been arrested over the past year.

 Uttar Pradesh police recently alerted Lalbazar about several goons from that state holed up in the city. ?We have intimated Calcutta Police about several criminals, including Atiq and Munna. But they are not cooperating with us,? R. Shukla, station officer of Makhi, in Kanpur, told Metro over the phone.

 He had led the Special Operations Group team of the Kanpur police that picked up Rafique from Chhatu Babu Lane, in Entally.

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said: ?We are in constant touch with the Uttar Pradesh police to flush out criminals staying here.?

 Pointing out their handicap, an officer at Lalbazar said: ?How will we know about the criminals if we are not informed by the police of their home states? Calcutta is such a big city and we are not magicians.? 

 The goons mostly put up in Garden Reach, Entally, Phoolbagan, Rajabazar and Park Circus. 

 Calcutta Police, incidentally, carried out a series of raids on Monday night and rounded up 144 criminals. ?Though we were conducting the raids, we had no clue about the movement of the Delhi Police team that netted Sher Singh Rana,? quipped an officer.

 Murder he wrote

 PRONAB MONDAL

 A couple has come calling from Holland with clinching evidence that can crack a two-year-old murder mystery. 

 Siddhartha Mukherjee, 54, was found dead in his Uttarpara residence in the summer of 2004. The investigating officers found strangulation marks on Mukherjees neck and the forensic reports suggested a left-handers involvement in the murder. 

 CID, however, failed to proceed further and the file was closed. Only to be reopened this week, thanks to vital missing links provided by Mukherjees Holland-based sister.

 My brother used to live alone We came to Uttarpara after his death and took his books and diaries with us. While going through the diaries, we found some interesting notes and decided to hand them over to the cops, said Arundhati Basak, Mukherjees sister.

 Arundhati, along with her statistician husband, flew into the city on Wednesday and met senior police officers at Bhawani Bhavan. 

 They have given us some vital documents and we hope to crack the case, said D.P. Tarania, inspector-general (II), CID.

 According to investigating officers, the handwritten notes indicate that Mukherjee, who used to work with Hindustan Motors, was facing regular threats from someone known to him.

 Mukherjee had a habit of scribbling his daily routine down on chits of papers. In one such note, he mentioned lending money to his domestic help for her ailing husbands operation.

 It is clear from the notes that the maid was defaulting on repayment. Mukherjee had also linked her to the threat calls in his notes. These notes are very crucial for our investigation, explained Tarania. 

 The domestic help was not under scanner when the probe was first initiated in 2004. But the notes have given CID a specific direction and the investigators will now zero in on the maid and her acquaintances.

 He had no one except me. So, I have come here with the hope that the cops will find his killer, said Arundhati, who will camp in Calcutta for two months seeking justice.

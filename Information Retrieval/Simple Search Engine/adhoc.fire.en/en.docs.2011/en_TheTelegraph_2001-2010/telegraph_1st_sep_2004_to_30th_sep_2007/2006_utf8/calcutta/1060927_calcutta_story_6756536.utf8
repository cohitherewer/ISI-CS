The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Commuter comfort 

 - Passenger dispersal at stations

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state has drawn up a Rs 200-crore blueprint to revamp the passenger dispersal system at the three terminal railway stations in the city. 

 The maximum emphasis will be on the newly-built Calcutta (Chitpur) station, with Rs 150 crore being earmarked for it.

 The project entails laying of 

 new roads, widening of existing roads, construction of flyovers 

 and bridges over canals, relocation of car parks, bus and 

 taxi terminals, and re-engineering of traffic movement.

 Over five million people use Howrah, Sealdah and Calcutta stations and the government is keen on smoothening passenger movement in and around the stations, said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which will implement the project, along with the transport department and the civic body. We want to create a hassle-free passage for passengers. 

 The project, Improvement of Passengers Dispersal System, is part of the CMDAs City Development Plan.

 Thousands of vehicles, including buses, taxis and private cars, converge on these stations and the traffic situation becomes chaotic. There is little scope of widening the arteries, so our focus is on building alternative roads and reordering traffic movement, explained Baviskar.

 We plan to revamp the roads along the Circular, New Cut and Kestopur canals. That will enable commuters coming out of the Chitpur terminal to reach VIP Road or EM Bypass, avoiding the snarl on APC Road and Maniktala Main Road. Passengers from Sealdah, too, will benefit from the canal-side roads and bridges, said a CMDA engineer.

 To decongest the Howrah station area, officials said steps would be taken to shift the bus and taxi terminals to a spot near the new complex, on the banks of the Hooghly. Talks are on with Calcutta Port Trust to get land for the bus terminal.

 While around Rs 50 crore is likely to come from the Centre under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the rest will be borne by the state.

 Detailed project reports of the individual schemes are being prepared and work will start after the Pujas, said Baviskar.

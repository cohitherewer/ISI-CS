The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

A new ride

Screen On amp; Off

 You have known him as Om of Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki. Now, Kiran Karmakar will be seen playing an important cameo in the afternoon STAR Plus serial Saarrthi. ?It was just an opportunity to do something different and I agreed straightaway,? Kiran tells Metro.

 He will be playing the role of Bikram Ahuja, a much revered business tycoon who comes to the Goenka household from the Thursday episode.

 ?The character of Bikram is much younger than that of Om and that also makes him less mature,? Kiran says. ?Although the character has a lot of similarities with people like Sabeer Bhatia and Azim Premji, I didn?t base Bikram on any particular person and just played it according to my imagination.?

 In the Saarrthi storyline, while everyone in the Goenka household expects Bikram to do business with them, Kiran?s character goes ahead and offers a big deal to Bhumika.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I?ve created my own niche?

 He is neither an action star nor a comedy king. Hit man AKSHAY KUMAR tells Pratim D. Gupta that he wants to rule Bollywood on his own terms

 Akshay Kumar with 

 Katrina Kaif in moments from Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, 

 releasing on Friday 

 You recently said, ?You don?t 

 need to be a Khan to be a star?. That definitely holds true 

 for Akshay Kumar. What magic potion do you have to keep 

 delivering one blockbuster after another?

 Correction, my quote was, ?You don?t need to be a Khan to be a superstar.? I definitely stand by that statement. I don?t think that names like Khans, Khannas or even Kumar have a monopoly on top positions here. Yes, my films are doing extremely well. But I have created my own niche on my own terms by working with a set of people with no big banners. I am happy that despite all this all my films are becoming blockbusters... And my producers too are quite happy about it.

 You have always been a great 

 action star. But your comedy rocks these days. How did you 

 develop your comic timing or was it always there, overshadowed 

 by your kickboxing?

 Frankly, I am getting sick of being branded, as a comedy star or as an action star. It?s not a conscious decision to stick to one genre. I was first labelled an action star, then as a comedy king. But I have moved on, and right now I am attempting a different kind of cinema? I wish people would move on too. I just want to keep on experimenting. 

 I am amazed at what heroes can get to do in Hollywood. In Raging Bull, the hero (Robert De Niro) of the film even beats his brother, wife and relatives because he is a boxer. Which hero would dare to take the same role here? But I guess you have got to keep on experimenting ? the opportunities are limitless.

 Just like the Khans, now you 

 have your own set of backers like Vipul Shah, Keshu Ramsay 

 and Raj Kanwar. Do you enjoy working with friends more?

 Yes, I enjoy working with people like Vipul Shah, Feroz Nadiadwala, Sajid Nadiadwala, Ratan Jain, Keshu Ramsay. Saying that, it would be wrong to say that I have my own set of backers. I do share a great comfort level with all of them but it has never been a conscious decision to stick to a set of people. I am also doing films with others be it Pritish Nandy?s PNC, Reliance or others.

 What is special about Akshay 

 Kumar in Humko Deewana Kar Gaye?

 Akshay Kumar in Humko Deewana Kar Gaye will be attempting a romantic film after a long time, since Dhadkan. The difference lies in the script of the film. The film takes off when a couple falls in love with two other people. Love cannot be predicted, it just happens. It is inspired by a real-life story of a couple in Canada. I play a very romantic guy in the film, yet he is pragmatic.

 lWhat was it like working with Katrina Kaif?

 Katrina is quite a revelation in the film. She is taking great strides in Bollywood. Everyone feels we share a good chemistry on-screen. Saying that, I should add that she is extremely hardworking and very professional.

 Not just Katrina, you seem 

 to share a great on-screen chemistry with all your co-stars, 

 from Priyanka Chopra to Kareena Kapoor. What is the big 

 secret?

 I guess I?m a really good actor (laughs).

 After the Khans, now you are 

 on your own world tour called Heat. What is so hot about 

 it?

 Me (laughs).

 You are working with Rituparno 

 Ghosh for Rahgeer. Is it your first conscious step 

 towards meaningful cinema after Water didn?t work 

 out?

 Yes, I am looking forward to working with Rituparno. I admire him greatly as a director. We had been discussing working together earlier. And when he approached me with Rahgeer, I was completely bowled over by the characterisation. 

 It?s a genre of film which I have not attempted before. Rahgeer will see me in a different light altogether. I always wanted to do something different and not get branded, and this is the right time to explore that other genre of cinema.

 What else will keep you busy 

 in the months ahead?

 I have quite a few films spaced out like Neeraj Vohra?s Phir Hera Pheri with Suniel Shetty, Shirish Kunder?s Jaaneman with Salman Khan, Vipul Shah?s Namaste London, Anees Bazmee?s Welcome, Priyadarshan?s Bhagam Bhag with Govinda, Sajid Khan?s Hey Baby and four projects with Reliance.

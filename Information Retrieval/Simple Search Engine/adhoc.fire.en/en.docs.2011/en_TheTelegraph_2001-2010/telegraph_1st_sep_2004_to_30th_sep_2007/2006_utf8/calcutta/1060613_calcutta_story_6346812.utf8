 Soccer samba 

 on the streets

 Over 50 youngsters 

 from Calcutta to Dankuni and Durgapur participated in 

 a dance workshop organised by TTIS at Nehru Children?s 

 Museum from May 31 to June 2. It was conducted for six 

 to 16-year-olds by Dhiman Shankar, in basic ghoomar, 

 dandiya and modern styles, to the tune of modern 

 music. ?The response was great. We had to turn away 

 around 100 students,? said Shankar. Picture by Sanjoy

 India may never reach the football 

 World Cup, but Indian para football is going places 

 with Nokia?s Defend Your Turf competition. The Futsal (street 

 football) tournament got underway in Bangalore last week 

 and the finals will be played in Calcutta later this week.

 The winners of the tournament 

 also get a chance to play against Boys from Brazil, a team 

 of champion street football players from the land of Pele 

 and Ronaldinho.

 Each match in the Defend Your 

 Turf challenge ? open to Indian citizens between 15 and 

 25 ? is a five-a-side affair lasting seven minutes. The 

 teams are allowed two substitutes. The regional champions 

 from Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai and Calcutta will play off 

 against one another in the finals on June 17 for the national 

 Futsal champions title.

 ?Nokia is an iconic youth brand. 

 Music, sports and fashion are the three ways we connect 

 with the youth,? said Devender Kishore, director marketing, 

 Nokia India. ?Defend Your Turf is continuing with that effort. 

 The tournament is not for professional players and is played 

 under the most natural circumstances,? Kishore added.

 India is the fifth country where 

 Defend Your Turf is being organised, after Malaysia, Singapore, 

 Australia and Thailand. The inaugural edition of the competition 

 has seen a decent response from football enthusiasts. Within 

 two weeks of announcement, 1,132 teams registered from across 

 the four cities. From Calcutta, 256 teams had signed up 

 by June 3. 

 ?We are really excited about the 

 tournament,? said 14-year-old Aparna Roy of the all-girls 

 team from Central Corner Coaching Camp. Aparna?s team-mates, 

 all aged between 14 and 15, are training hard to give the 

 boys some serious competition.

 The winners of Defend Your Turf 

 will play Boys from Brazil in Calcutta and on their home 

 turf. ?They will get the opportunity to train and rub shoulders 

 with some of the best players in Brazil, at Rio?s Maracana 

 stadium,? Kishore signed off.

 What?s been happening Around Town

 Admission etiquette

 Never-ending queues meandering 

 for half-a-km around the campus, anxious students burdened 

 by marksheets and certificates waiting to be called ? admission 

 to colleges have begun. Some institutions are adopting newer 

 and easier techniques to submit the forms. After the gruelling 

 session of Board exams, the pressure of passing admission 

 tests and cracking interviews are haunting the already exhausted 

 students. Yet, it?s time for some fun too, as friends and 

 fellow-sufferers meet and greet, socialising while waiting 

 in queue. 

 Scottish Church College distributed 

 forms only on the Internet. St Xavier?s College has a similar 

 system, although the last date for submission of forms for 

 ISC students is over while the date for West Bengal Board 

 students is June 14. Presidency College had arranged for 

 a bunch of student representatives to help the confused 

 applicants... 

 The crowds comprise mostly a mix 

 of freshers, some accompanied by their parents for moral 

 support, equipped with an armful of documents. Some flaunt 

 their influential contacts and boast of relatives or friends 

 among the faculty, while others are too nervous and disillusioned 

 to participate in any conversation. But each one is in the 

 same boat, till they are given the green signal to enter 

 the hallowed halls of college. 

 As the serpentine queues snake 

 towards the principal?s office, examination or admissions 

 hall, each one becomes a vital part of a group participating 

 in a mass prayer. For a couple of hours, the admission procedure 

 unites the youth, irrespective of their many differences, 

 in a common cause.

 It is admission time at Presidency 

 College, but this year the college took part of its application 

 process online for the first time. St Xavier?s College has 

 for the past few years been conducting the entire form fill-up 

 and submission procedure online. Presidency, however, is 

 yet to go fully tech-friendly. The forms were available 

 online on the college website (www.presidencycollegekolkata.org) 

 from where they could be downloaded and printed, but the 

 submission still had to be done by hand at the respective 

 departments. 

 Forms were also available from 

 the college counter, which is the old practice. And if the 

 queue on the first day, June 6, was anything to go by, this 

 is still the preferred option. As is the scene every year, 

 people queued up from very early in the morning. 

 By 11 am, the lines starting from 

 the base of the stairs of the main building snaked through 

 the length of the corridor, past the canteen at the back, 

 and continued up to Baker building on the other side! There 

 were also long queues at the union room counter, where the 

 previous years? admission-test questions were being distributed. 

 The overcast skies and persistent 

 drizzle did little to dampen the atmosphere ? the adrenaline 

 is always high during admissions ? as the volunteers, particularly 

 excited first-year students, moved around busily, managing 

 queues and providing assistance. 

 The media presence was considerable 

 ? microphones and cameras everywhere, interviews in progress 

 and College Street lined with vans carrying dish antennae 

 that collected rain water. 

 The form distribution and submission 

 process ended on June 12. Admission tests will be held for 

 all subjects from June 17-22.

 Mind your language

 A month-long summer camp in spoken 

 English was conducted by Pailan World School, not for students 

 but for lower-level employees. Around 50 sweepers, security 

 guards, housekeepers, etc were trained to speak the language 

 from May 13 to June 11. The Joka school?s faculty took up 

 the task, teaching general and job-specific sentence construction. 

 The aim of thee workshop was to 

 ensure that not only is English the medium of instruction 

 in the classroom, but also the language of interaction in 

 the school, said Apurba Saha, founder and chairman of the 

 Pailan Group. He added that in the near future, the faculty 

 might reach out to the service staff in other institutions, 

 who would be interested in improving their English-speaking 

 skills.

 Zany zoo trip

 Junior Horlicks 1-2-3TM, an extension 

 of Horlicks, had organised a trip to the zoo for pre-school 

 children and their parents on June 4. The visit was part 

 of the Junior Horlicks Kid?s Day Out programme. Parents 

 of pre-school children were invited to name the new Junior 

 Horlicks elephant mascot. 

 Of more than 1,000 participants, 

 100 kids and their parents were selected for the zoo trip. 

 After a guided tour, the kids reassembled at the park and 

 played games like Feed the Elephant, while the parents participated 

 in a memory game. The event ended with Junior Horlicks gift 

 hampers and certificates for the winners.

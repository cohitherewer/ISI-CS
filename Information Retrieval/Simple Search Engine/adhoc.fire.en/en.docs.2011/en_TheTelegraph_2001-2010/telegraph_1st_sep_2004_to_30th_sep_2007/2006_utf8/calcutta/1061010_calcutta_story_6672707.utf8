The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Age no bar for timeless stunners

 They had it going back 

 then. They have it going still. And they seem to be only getting 

 better with the years. On Bollywood legend Rekhas 52nd 

 birthday, GoodLife picks four sexy sirens 

 of our times 

 Rekha

 DoB: October 10, 1954. 

 From the voluptuous ugly duckling in Saawan Bhadon to the gorgeous superstar, she has indeed come a very long way. Aishwarya Rai may keep rolling her eyes, but Rekha will remain the one and only Umrao Jaan. From the tragedy queen in Muqaddar ka Sikandar to the fiery scorned woman in Khoon Bhari Maang, from the sensuousness of Silsila to the sexuality of Utsav, from the way she can still mouth Oh Baby in a Parineeta item number to the way she moves to Khayyams fresh tunes for Goutam Ghoses Yatra, Rekha remains Rekha.

 Today, despite a few extra kilos and some dyed locks, the Rekha fan club remains convinced that they just dont make em like her any more.

 Goldie Hawn

 DoB: November 21, 1945. 

 Her 60th birthday party saw the 

 whole family get together to be tattooed. Now thats 

 how cool Goldie Hawn is. She remains a screen favourite, 

 cute yet oomphy. Her other side the seriously spiritual 

 one is equally amazing (she shares a bond with the Dalai 

 Lama). She is a beautiful mom to a beautiful daughter, actress 

 Kate Hudson. And soon, she will be 61. Wow!

 Madonna 

 DoB: August 16, 1958. 

 Her red mouth, her patent black 

 patent leather look and to top it all, her billion-dollar 

 attitude. With all eyes fixed on her right from the 1984 

 hit Like a prayer, Madonna is the undisputed drop-dead 

 diva who has redefined reinvention. Material girl, Like 

 a virgin, Erotica, American pie Madonna has been all 

 that and more, with a voice that has launched a million 

 records and a body that has shaped a million fantasies.

 Dimple Kapadia

 DoB: June 8, 1957.

 From the red bikini in Bobby to the wet red chiffon in Saagar to the shirt-and-denims in Dil Chahta Hai to the cottons in Leela, she has gone from bubbly teenager to sensuous woman to the graceful lady. Even today when the leading lady with the most gorgeous auburn hair commands romantic attention from Saif Ali Khan in Being Cyrus, she is simply irresistible.

 Dengue shade on death

 - Officials trash hospital claim as blood test was not carried out

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Biswajit Pramanik, 35, died on Monday at National Medical College and Hospital, where officials pronounced him a victim of ?dengue fever?.

 But Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay, chief municipal officer (health), stressed that ?no case of dengue has been reported in the city? and it was premature to put Pramanik?s death down to dengue.

 Pramanik, a resident of Gobindo Banerjee Lane in Regent Park, died after battling for life for more than 10 days at National Medical.

 Pramanik?s first cousin Sanjay Das confirmed that the hospital had said it was ?a case of dengue? on June 28.

 ?An attending house-staff at the hospital had declared the case as dengue without getting a blood test done. The man had been suffering for the past 15 days and that goes against symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease,? countered Chattopadhyay.

 Pramanik, who worked as a technician in a small photographic studio at Kidderpore, was the sole bread-earner of the family, comprising his old mother and four sisters.

 He was suffering from high fever since June 20 and was prescribed antibiotics for viral fever by a local doctor. ?When the temperature did not go down after three days, we moved him to MR Bangur Hospital. But the temperature remained around 104 degrees. When we charged the doctors with negligence, they told us to take him to National Medical,? Das recounted.

 ?We did all that the doctors at National Medical asked us to do. In these past few days, we have spent more than Rs 9,000 on medicines and an additional Rs 6,000 on a blood report that they asked us to send to a Delhi-based path lab. But it came to nothing,? he added.

 Specialists said the dengue vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, breeds in clear water. ?Since it is a daytime biter, prevention of its breeding is the most effective way of protection,? explained a microbiologist. ?Any accumulation of clear water in a locality should be prevented,? he added.

 The primary symptoms of dengue, according to doctors are as follows:

 4Low to high-grade fever, associated with mild or severe muscle and joint ache with nausea and vomiting

 4Then the fever subsides, but rashes erupt all over the body and cause itching

 4There is a sharp drop in the haemoglobin level due to haemorrhage

 4There is respiratory distress due to accumulation of fluid in lungs

 4In a more advanced stage, there could be bleeding and sudden fall in body temperature with profuse sweating.

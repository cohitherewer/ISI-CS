 Police counsel for child criminals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The detainment of three children at Garihaat Mall on Sunday has prompted police to start counselling sessions for juvenile delinquents. 

 The three boys, from poor families and aged between nine and 11, were handed over to police by the malls security guards. The guards had become suspicious of their movements. The boys admitted to police that they were at the mall to steal from the shops. They confessed to stealing earlier.

 Since children below 12 cannot be arrested, the boys were sent home with their parents. The police top brass feel even an hour of counselling could be beneficial in such cases.

 Towards that end, the Lalbazar headquarters will soon instruct police stations to counsel juvenile criminals before they are handed over to their parents or sent to the juvenile court. Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee, however, admitted that proper counselling will not be possible. For that, special skill is required. Our men are not trained in counselling. The officers will explain to the children how their future will be ruined if they commit crimes.

 According to officers of the detective department, juvenile criminals are often part of rackets. Our target is to crack down on the rackets. Our attempt will be to take the children into confidence, so that we can get to the kingpins, explained deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh.

 The first move to counsel juvenile delinquents was started three years ago. A team from Delhi conducted a two-day training for over 40 sub-inspectors on dealing with children involved in crime, stated an officer.

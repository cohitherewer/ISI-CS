 The quest of a woman

 Focusing her artistic vision on the private, inner lives of women, Sharmistha Banerjee tries to understand and articulate the workings of the feminine psyche. In Search of Root, the ongoing exhibition of her paintings, portrays women who seem to embody a definite quest for something or somebody. Whether it be the yearning for romantic love, a longing to break the shackles of repression, or even a spiritual search for the infinite, each of them betrays a lack of wish fulfilment. Though women are mainly portrayed as figures of peace, virtue and piety, there is also the attending thought that they are victims of injustice, oppression and abuse. In fact, there is a subtle indication of revolt and rebellion in some of Banerjees works as well. Ultimately, her characters are on a journey to find their roots, perhaps as means of seeking their own identity and rediscovering their true selves.

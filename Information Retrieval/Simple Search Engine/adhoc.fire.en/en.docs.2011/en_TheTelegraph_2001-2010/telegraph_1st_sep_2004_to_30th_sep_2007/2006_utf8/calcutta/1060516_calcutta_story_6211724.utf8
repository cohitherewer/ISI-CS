 Grooming the 

 glamour girl gang

 Catwalk to cutlery, fitness

 the grind

 by international brand Pierre Cardin for a show in Paris 

 three months into her ramp career. Auditioned for YSL the 

 same year and was runners-up. 

 Role to play: Spearheading 

 the entire grooming programme for the pageant this year. 

 Sits down with each individual expert and structures the 

 day-to-day plan. 

 Tilottama to me is: 

 The one and only beauty pageant in east India. It 

 enjoys all the publicity that is so essential, at least 

 for the winners in their first year. 

 The girls this year: When 

 compared to the rest of India, they lack in height, 

 she feels but also adds that some of the girls have great 

 potential.

 RIA MITRA

 at Gladrags Megamodel 2000. Has been part of most big shows 

 in the city, as model or choreographer. 

 Role to play: Nayanika 

 Chatterjees assistant for the Tilottama grooming programme. 

 Apart from giving the contestants tips on styling and conduct, 

 she is trying to impart knowledge and confidence that will 

 carry the girls through, on ramp and off it.

 Tilottama to me is: A 

 genuine, solid platform for newcomers, irrespective of which 

 industry they go into.

 The girls this year: Contrary 

 to general notion, Ria feels that the average height of 

 the contestants has been good this year. They are 

 also quite a confident lot, she adds.

 Role to play: Teaching 

 the girls basic body movements, postures and group dance 

 choreography with an aim to improve their fashion 

 walk. Is also choreographing the opening act for the 

 big night. 

 Tilottama to me is: A 

 great platform. Its not just about one winner; all 

 the 20 Tilottama girls always get noticed.

 The girls this year: They 

 are a mixed lot. Some have great expressions, others have 

 graceful carriage. They are all hard-working but the real 

 test only begins after May 27.

 PREETOM MUKHERJEE-ROY

 of the first high-tech gyms in the city.

 Role to play: He is the 

 girls fitness expert and has designed personalised 

 workout programmes for each contestant. He also oversees 

 all their fitness activities at Solace.

 Tilottama to me is: A 

 great stepping stone for the girls to get totally groomed. 

 It teaches them all they ever need to know to fit into the 

 glamour industry. 

 The girls this year: They 

 are raw but are extremely hard-working. The changes in them 

 so far are phenomenal, feels Preetom.

 at the dining table to cutlery and crockery handling to

 Tilottama to me is: Its 

 a grand opening for young girls. It doesnt stop at 

 the finale; the valuable training will last them forever. 

 The girls this year: Are 

 from various professional and family backgrounds, they are 

 nice people, well-mannered and eager to learn.

 in the The Great Indian Laughter Challenge.

 voice modulation, and how to face judges (with an entire 

 exercise on mock questions). Apart from pageant-related 

 grooming, he is also teaching them how to talk and put their 

 point across. 

 Tilottama to me is: A 

 platform that never fails to throw up great potential. The 

 sheer glamour it has been carrying for the last 10 years 

 is great, a very fitting tribute to the beauty of a woman 

 by Sananda.

 The girls this year: Are 

 a very good lot. I am glad that so many Northeast 

 girls are part of the final gang. Them representing their 

 region is a big boost. They have great potential and I hope 

 at least one of them features in the top three.

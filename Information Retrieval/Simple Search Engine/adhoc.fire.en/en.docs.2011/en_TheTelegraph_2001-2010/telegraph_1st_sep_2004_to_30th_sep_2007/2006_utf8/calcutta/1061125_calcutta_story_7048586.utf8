 A hundred plays: short, full length, street, intimate and open-air theatre, mime and shows for children; expositions of books on theatre, photographs, film and video screenings; theatre songs, seminars, theatre adda the sixth Paschim Banga Natyamela began on November 23 with this bagful of promises.

 The festival, which apparently attracted some 50,000 viewers from different parts of the state last year, has returned with a budget boosted by Rs 9 lakh from the state government and Rs 1 lakh from Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre. The government has spent an additional Rs 6 lakh by giving all six city venues for free and paying for publicity and publications, said Sukanto Roy, member secretary of the organising body Paschim Banga Natya Akademi. There are no tickets; cards will be available at the halls two days in advance.

 For the next seven days, the Nandan complex, Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha, Bangla Akademi, Madhusudan Mancha and Girish Mancha will be referred to by names of well-known theatre personalities. 

 The entire zone will be collectively known as Tapas Sen Prangan, in memory of the late stage lighting wizard. The makeshift stage and the area where street plays will be held in the Nandan complex have been dedicated to acting legends Gyanesh Mukhopadhyay and Satya Bandhopadhyay.

 The focus this year is on district plays, which many feel is where future hope lies for Bengali theatre. Sixty-four of the 100 plays will be from the districts.

 The inaugural evening saw Anya Theatre presenting two short plays by Bidhayak Bhattacharya at Gyanesh Mancha. This is his centenary year. We used to enjoy the plays of his Amaresh series as children, explained Bibhas Chakraborty. The two plays, grouped as Amaresher Kando, focus on the attempts of a young theatre-addict to get his village friends to do theatre.

 The air was more sombre at Sisir Mancha where Usha Ganguli and Rangakarmee presented their second play on Saadat Hasan Manto Sarhad Paar Manto. While Shilpayan of Gobardanga presented Satya Shylock, a take-off on Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice, at Rabindra Sadan, Nandipat was presenting Ramani Mohan at Girish Mancha.

 The turnout on Day I was 5,000. The next few days star a clutch of plays by some of Calcuttas best-known directors and writers like Kumar Roy, Arun Mukhopadhyay, Ramaprasad Banik, Kaushik Sen, Bratya Basu and Goutam Halder.

 Then there is Ek Mulaqat Manto Se directed by Aswat Bhatt, an Indian member of the German group Flying Fish, and S.M. Solaymans Golap Jaan produced by Theatre Art Unit, Dhaka.

 Theatre lovers can look forward to two documentaries, on Tapas Sen by Asit Basu and on Khaled Chowdhury by Rishi Mukherjee, being shown at Nandan III at 3 pm and 6 pm on November 27, 28 and 29. A recording of Bibhas Chakrabortys Madhabmalanchi Koinya will also be shown. 

 A first for this year will be a play-reading session on November 30 where Mohit Chattopadhyay, Manoj Mitra and Arun Mukhopadhyay will read out new plays written by them.

 There are so many groups with so many plays, so much to see and say... And each year one sees the youths intense desire to be better, to break and make, that it is always exciting, said Manoj Mitra.

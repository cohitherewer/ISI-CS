 Bally, Howrah

 The sale of chicken has dropped drastically in the city even though there is no report of bird flu here. Avian influenza poses a serious threat to human health as it has the ability to cross the species barrier. All over the world, disease and death are typically accompanied by social and economic disruption. So the drop in chicken consumption was only to be expected. Prevention is, after all, better than cure.

 The drop in the consumption of chicken is a result of panic. When people get panicky, they no longer act rationally. The media can play an important role in allaying the fear in the public mind and boost consumption of chicken.

 Of course. People are terrified of eating eggs and chicken dishes. Veterinarians are voicing conflicting opinions on the issue, thereby confusing the public. On top of that, the state minister for animal resources is quite okay with a large poultry farm denying government officials entry on its premises. This has made the consumers suspicious. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 The threat of avian flu has been there for the past few years, though the media did not play up the issue until recently. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that panic has superceded precaution. Doctors have been repeatedly saying that consumption of properly boiled chicken is not harmful, but people are reluctant to risk an infection. Unless the administration restores consumer confidence, the poultry industry will continue to suffer.

 Initially, there was certainly a panic. But once the prices of the poultry products decreased, they sold like hot cakes. I saw people queuing up to buy chicken at a discount at Lansdowne Market. So, where was the panic? The educated people of the state are well aware of the ways to avoid bird flu. The drop could also have been due to the board exams. The parents of the examinees were not willing to take any risk. But once the exams finished, they resumed the consumption.

 The government fails to alert us before any natural disaster or epidemic. Naturally, people are being cautious rather than trust the authorities.

 Mahasweta Saha,

 Avoiding chicken is a panic reaction rather than a precautionary measure. We can surely consume poultry products after adopting protective measures like buying processed meat, avoiding contact with the birds and properly boiling the meat and eggs. The extreme reaction is not warranted. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 The drop in chicken consumption is definitely more panic than precaution. Many of us are easily influenced and do not apply our mind. Even restaurants and caterers are removing chicken items from their menu without bothering to think once that no trace of bird flu has been detected in Bengal. The government should start a media campaign to restore confidence among people.

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 The drop in chicken consumption is due to sheer panic. One can eat chicken without contracting avian flu, as the doctors have been saying. Moreover, most of the chicken sold in the city is sourced locally.

 Ronita Dutta, 

 Jadavpur

 The sale of chicken has gone down due to panic among the public following the coverage of avian flu infections in Maharashtra by the media. The authorities and the experts have all along maintained that there?s no risk in consuming poultry products after taking precaution. 

Nirmalendu Datta Roy, 

 Belur, Howrah 

 Vaccine for avian flu has not yet been discovered. Precaution helps check the spread of the disease. The question is should we consume chicken and egg while there prevails a nationwide panic. My answer is in the negative. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road

 There is no doubt about the fact that the drop in chicken consumption is more panic than precaution. Following the detection of bird flu in Maharashtra, some people have gone to the extent of throwing away chicken stored in the refrigerator. Simple precautions during cooking would have sufficed.

 Chirag Tulsiani,

 Address not given

 The drop in chicken consumption was the result of a precautionary measure. Most people exposed to the media know that chickens are being culled by thousands every day. Being aware of the dangers of the disease, they are unwilling take any risk.

 Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake

 There is an atmosphere of panic prevailing in Bengal regarding chicken consumption despite precautionary measures by the government.

 What: Summer 

 Wine, organised by Spandan in association with Reliance 

 India Mobile and Tollygunge Club.

 Where: Tollygunge Club.

 When: Saturday, 7.30 pm 

 onwards.

 Take a look: It was an 

 open-air event and the rain posed a constant threat, but 

 the Tolly spirit, as the members choose to call 

 it, kept the mood upbeat. The audience enjoyed the music 

 thoroughly, with the drizzle hardly being a dampener. 

 Spotted among the crowd was Usha Uthup enjoying herself. I love the songs that are being sung and am happy that the rain has not spoilt this melodious night, smiled Usha.

 Summer Wine was an attempt to relive the magic of the golden oldies, right from the 60s to the 90s.

 As singers Francis Lepcha and Chanelle Grosser belted out one track after the other, it was going down memory lane with Neil Diamond, Cliff Richard, Engelbert Humperdinck, Frank Sinatra, Paul Anka, Julio Iglesias, Elvis Presley, Kingston Trio, Boney M and Abba hits. 

 Francis and Chanelle sensed the audiences pulse perfectly. They began with soft melodies like Wind beneath my wings and Only you before moving on to Youre the one I want, Island in the sun, Strangers in the night, Last waltz, Sweet Caroline, By the rivers of Babylon, and even including Vengaboys hip hop like My heart goes sha la la la la and Ricky Martins She bangs.

 As the evening proceeded, an elderly couple took the dance floor first, only to be joined by many others.

 Voiceover: With so 

 much hard metal and rock around, it is always nice to relish 

 yesteryear melodies that were chartbusters during their 

 times and still continue to be favourites with all age-groups, 

 smiled Renu Roy, executive director, Spandan.

 Melody mood

 What: Third anniversary 

 bash of Amar 106.2 FM.

 Where: The Phoenix at Saturday 

 Club.

 When: Saturday, 7 pm onwards.

 The bash: Members of various 

 Bangla bands like Fossils, Cactus, Lakkhichhara and Chandrabindoo 

 made for a melodious evening, quite in sync with the radio 

 stations identity.

 The glamour quotient was lifted by Tollywood stars like Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Parambrata Chatterjee and Rimjhim Mitra.

 Voiceover: We are 

 a niche station playing Bengali songs that are not played 

 on any other station. We have just completed three years 

 and it is reason enough to celebrate, said a spokesperson 

 for the station.

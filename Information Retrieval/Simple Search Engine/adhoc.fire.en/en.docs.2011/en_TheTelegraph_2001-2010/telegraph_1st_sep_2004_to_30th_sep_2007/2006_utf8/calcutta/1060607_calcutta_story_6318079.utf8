 Hoax call forces landing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A bomb hoax forced an Air Deccan flight to make an emergency landing at Calcutta airport on Tuesday. 

 The Airbus 320 from Port Blair to Calcutta, carrying 190 passengers, was scheduled to arrive at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at 11.55 am. 

 At 9.35 am, airport officials received a call. ?The unknown caller conveyed a threat to the Air Deccan flight and hung up,? an official said.

 The message was passed on to the Air Traffic Control, which communicated with the flight captain. 

 ?A full emergency was declared at the airport for the flight?s landing. However, it landed without a problem at 11.52 am and all the passengers dispersed safely. It was immediately taken to the isolation bay,? said airport director V.K. Monga. 

 Ambulance, fire brigade and other necessary arrangements were kept ready during landing, officials said.

 ?Passenger luggage was taken to a segregated spot and sniffer dogs were pressed into action,? an official said. The bomb disposal squad also checked the plane for any explosive device. The passengers were allowed to leave with their baggage after an all-clear signal from the search party.

 Officials are trying to trace the call and identify the caller.

 In January, an Air Sahara flight from Mumbai made an emergency landing at Calcutta after smoke was detected in the catering cabin. Last October, a London-Singapore Qantas Airlines flight had made an emergency landing following a fire alert from an engine.

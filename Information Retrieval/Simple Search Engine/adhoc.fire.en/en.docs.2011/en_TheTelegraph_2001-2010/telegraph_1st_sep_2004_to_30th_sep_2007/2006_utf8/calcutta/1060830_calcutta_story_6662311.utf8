The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech talent in high demand

 - Salim ally call too late for JU graduates 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Getting land in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal is easier than acquiring tech talent from premier academic institutes in the state.

 Universal Success, promoted by NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee, and Delhi-based construction major Unitech the associates of Indonesia-based Salim Group learnt the lesson the hard way.

 The companies had approached Jadavpur University (JU) last month to allow them to recruit fresh civil engineering graduates through campus interviews. But the university was unable to line up the students.

 We told them to contact us during next years campus interviews, Siddhartha Bhattacharyya, the universitys placement and training officer told Metro.

 JU sources suggest that by the time the companies sent their letters expressing willingness to take part in the campus interviews, all final-year civil engineering students had been placed with other companies. They were not apparently wiling to appear for any more interviews.

 Salim Group, along with Universal Success and Unitech, will execute a slew of projects industrial and housing estates, roads, bridges, health and knowledge cities in the state. The government has promised over 40,000 acres to the consortium.

 According to estimates, the consortium will initially employ over 100 engineers. And given the reputation of JUs engineering graduates, the companies want a chunk of its technical team from there.

 But roping the best brains will be easier said than done. Sources in the placement office said that though the companies have been invited to the campus interviews next year, the authorities are not sure about the students response.

 The demand for civil engineers has gone up and steel companies are the biggest recruiters of civil engineers from our university, said Bhattacharyya, referring to the boom time in the steel sector.

 The university recently commissioned a study to examine the causes behind the rush to hire civil engineers.

 One major reason is the Beijing Olympic Games A number of Indian firms are setting up infrastructure for the games. We are happy that many of the companies are recruiting our students, summed up the official.

 Larger tenders to counter water crisis

 Subir Kar: In case of large fires in the market areas, acute shortage of water sources become apparent. Are you thinking of making your own arrangement?

 We cannot dig up ponds or draw water from the dried-up canal beds. What we can do is carry more water with us while fighting a fire. That is why we are procuring vehicles with larger tanks. While the tank in a standard fire tender can carry water that can be sprayed for five minutes, the new models hold enough water to last us for half-an-hour. The vehicles with larger capacity cost about Rs 90 lakh each. We have procured 20 new vehicles and an order has been placed for another 20.

 Pandal-hopper 

 now a cop 

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 DUTY DEBUT: Constable Sujit Ganguly. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta

 He was a pandal-hopper in line last year. This Puja, he is keeping the pandal-hoppers in line.

 And the role reversal for the Calcutta Police traffic constable has come for a price. Sujit Ganguly, who used to criss-cross the city from Bagbazar to Bosepukur with his friends during the four festive days, has managed to see only one thakur this autumn.

 I live in Duttapukur and I visited the puja pandal in my para on Thursday, smiled Ganguly, posted at Colootola-Central Avenue crossing, on the evening of his first Saptami as a traffic constable. Ganguly got his white uniform in January 2006, which now bears HQ TP 103.

 Posted close to Mohammad Ali Park and College Square traditional top draws and two of his favourite puja pandals the 27-year-old was busy managing the crowds converging on central Calcutta and then carrying on up north or down south. From replying to queries on the nearest pandal with a smile to directing a stern glance at a traffic-rule violator, Ganguly is in the thick of things on Day III of his Puja duty.

 So are his 3,000-odd colleagues in the traffic department on Puja duty. The roster: 12-14 hours duty every day for five days on the trot. The rule: ensure smooth flow of traffic and pedestrians, and do it all with a smile. The rigour: the word holiday is banned when the whole world seems to be on holiday.

 Puja duty is challenging, as it involves crowd management. It is tiring as it stretches for five days. But ensuring that the festivities go on without a hitch is a great satisfaction and thats the motivation, said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 On the ground, Ganguly a first-division footballer, forced to choose Lalbazar over the Maidan following a knee-injury was echoing his bosss sentiments.

 I like my uniform It gives me great pride as it allows me to control traffic, said Ganguly pulling out his left lenyard and blowing the whistle.

 A speeding 47-B, a Dunlop-BBD Bag minibus and other vehicles screeched to a halt as he stood guard at the zebra crossing allowing pandal-hoppers to cross over. A wave of his hand, and the waiting wheels rolled on.

 On Sashthi, I suddenly realised someone was calling my name from a bus. By the time I recognised a friend, the bus had started moving, recounted Ganguly.

 Last Puja, his first instinct would have been to chase the bus and catch up with his friend. But now, the duty cultureof the force comes first. One festive habit, however, will die hard for the constables first Puja in uniform. My shirt and trousers are new, smiled Ganguly.

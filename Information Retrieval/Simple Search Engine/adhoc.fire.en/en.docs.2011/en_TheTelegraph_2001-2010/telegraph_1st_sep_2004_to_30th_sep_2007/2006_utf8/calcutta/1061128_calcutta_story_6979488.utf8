 Known as Shradha till sometime 

 back, the newly-renovated restaurant at 102 A amp;B Park 

 Street, (on the approach road to Park Circus-Bypass connector) 

 has come up with a detailed multi-cuisine menu. But coastal 

 seafood is the USP, foraying way beyond the common prawn 

 and crab dishes. 

 I have travelled extensively 

 the last few months along the coastline of India to research 

 seafood. To start any cuisine, you need to know the best 

 in any dish, explains Sanjay Madan, director of the 

 restaurant. 

 Spread over 4,000 sq ft, the 120-seater 

 eatery is tastefully done up. The tables are in wood and 

 silver, with a special polish to prevent food stains. These 

 are matched with brown leather couches and leatherback chairs. 

 While delicacies such as Squid 

 Koliwada (squid rings marinated with spices and deep-fried), 

 Clam Ajadina (clams marinated with a Mangalorean paste and 

 coconut) and Pomfret Chinachati (spicy pomfret cooked in 

 rum sauce) make up the coastal menu, theres a long 

 line-up of Chinese and Mughlai dishes too. 

 In the Chinese section, choose 

 from Dimsums, Ching Kao (steamed dumpling), Sui Mai, Crabmeat 

 Soup and much more, dished out by a Chinese chef who has 

 vast experience of working in Cantonese and Szechwan eateries 

 in Kowloon and Hong Kong.

 Mushroom Palak, Chicken Reshmi 

 Butter Masala, a host of kebabs and other Mughlai specialities 

 make up the Indian section.

 A meal for two would range between 

 Rs 400 and Rs 600. A well-stocked bar boasts a selection 

 of wines, whiskeys and more.

 We also undertake catering 

 within the city. Takeaway and home delivery services are 

 also offered, says Madan.

 Expansion plans are already on 

 the table. Work on the first floor has begun, to be 

 followed by a second level, making it one of the largest 

 standalone restaurants here, adds Madan.

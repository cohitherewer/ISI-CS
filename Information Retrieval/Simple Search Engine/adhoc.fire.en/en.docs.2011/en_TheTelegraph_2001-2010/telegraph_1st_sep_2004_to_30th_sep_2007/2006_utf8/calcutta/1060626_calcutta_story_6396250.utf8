 Arrest link in car-theft racket

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The recent arrest of a con man has set Howrah Police on the trail of members of a suspected car-theft racket.

 Kaushik Saha, 33, was arrested on June 17 in his hideout by a team from Shibpur police station. 

 A resident of Sheikhpara in Shibpur, Howrah, Saha was absconding for nearly six months. Several complaints had been lodged against him at the police station. 

 ?Saha used to lure car-owners with the promise of a high rent. He would take away the vehicles, only to sell them off,? said Shyamal Ghosh, inspector-in-charge of Shibpur police station. 

 According to police, Saha would promise car-owners that he would arrange for their vehicles to be rented out to reputed private or government firms and travel agencies on lucrative terms. 

 Once the owners agreed, he would drive away with the cars, never to return.

 Saha would sell the cars to the members of the racket, the cops stated. All efforts by the car-owners to trace him had proved futile.

 ?Saha is cunning. He never operated near his home. He picked his victims in Calcutta, North and South 24-Parganas and remote areas of Howrah. We were looking for him for a long time,? added Ghosh.

 The con man?s arrest has opened a can of worms. 

 The officers of Shibpur police station are of the opinion that it is not possible for an individual to execute a series of such jobs.

 ?We have been trying to trace the 19 cars of various makes that Saha illegally procured and sold over the past six months. We have found six of the cars. We are also trying to ascertain whether this man was part of a racket of car thieves,? the inspector-in-charge disclosed. 

 After taking the cars away from the owners, con men generally need a place to hide the vehicles for a few days before they are sold off. Hence, police suspect that Saha was part of a large racket.

 Also, cars cannot be sold without their documents. That indicates involvement of forgers. ?Therefore, we are almost certain that Saha was getting support of an organised gang,? Ghosh asserted. 

 ?This is a big business. A stolen Maruti 800 or Ambassador is sold for around Rs 80,000 if it is in good condition. Saha only targeted cars in good condition. We are now trying to find out who provided shelter to Saha when he was in hiding. If we succeed, we should be able to crack the case,? the officer-in-charge signed off.

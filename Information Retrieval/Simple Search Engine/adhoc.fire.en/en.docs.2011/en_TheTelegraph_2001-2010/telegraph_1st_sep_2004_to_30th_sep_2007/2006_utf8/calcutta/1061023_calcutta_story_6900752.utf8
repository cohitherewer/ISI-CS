 Play time

 What: Beyblade Championship.

 Where: Landmark. 

 When: October 15.

 Take a look: Around 400 boys, aged between five and 18, battled out the preliminary rounds, split into 24 groups, each with 16 participants. The competition that kicked off in the morning carried on till evening, as on-the-spot registrations continued through the day. 

 Two opponents demonstrated their Beyblade skills in arenas red and black. The judges kept a strict vigil; the reflex, timing and sense of speed of the participants was worth a watch.

 Pullers and launchers set the Beyblades in motion and the boys were at their attacking best, knocking opponents down and keeping their Beyblade spinning. The best of three decided 12 finalists. I love the game and practise at home every day. It is great fun being here and I look forward to winning, gushed seven-year-old Kausar. 

 The winner was Calvin Woo who walked away with a Funskool hamper, certificate and Rs 1,000. Saif Khan who stood second bagged a Funskool hamper, Rs 500 and a certificate. Rownaqul Islam followed, winning a hamper and a certificate. Certificates and freebies were given to all finalists.

 Voiceover: The game is very popular with young boys. They are in high spirits and eager to showcase their skills, smiled Varghese Thomas, regional sales manager, Funskool.

 Festive fitness

 What: Launch of a new Vertical Knee Up machine, plus Diwali offers at Golds Gym.

 Where: 57, Jawaharlal Nehru Road.

 When: October 16.

 Take a look: Its time to shed all that fat gained during the festive season. At Golds Gym, the new Vertical Knee Up machine promises to do just that.

 The use of the machine is multi-fold it will help shape the chest, triceps, abdomen (especially lower abdomen), calf and will also stretch all parts of the body.

 A 20-minute workout with five minutes of warm-up and cool-down is sufficient to keep in shape, so dont say you just dont have the time!

 Theres more. A months membership at the gym that would cost you Rs 3,200 otherwise now comes for Rs 1,600, only for women. The offer is valid till the end of this month.

 There is also an added incentive for the most regular member of the gym, who gets an extra month added to membership time, free of cost.

 Its safe to gorge on dry fruits like almonds, peanuts, figs and walnuts this Diwali, but avoid cashewnuts and raisins, offers Anu Jhunjhunwala, Golds Gym nutritionist.

 Voiceover: During festival time, women usually stay away from gymming to attend to house matters, while the men somehow always manage to make it. I hope the new machine and the special offer will get more women to work out, said Divya Himatsingka, director of the gym.

 Monitor of schools in doldrums

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government?s attempt to regulate the functioning of schools under the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) from this year has come a cropper.

 The 13-member watchdog panel formed for the purpose has failed to submit its recommendations to the government by the March 31 deadline. 

 ?It is unfortunate that we could not complete the exercise on time,? school education minister Kanti Biswas said on Wednesday. 

 The panel found it difficult to prepare its report because of reluctance on the part of the schools in providing information regarding their system of functioning.

 It had sent a questionnaire to the schools, seeking the details of fee structure, teachers? salaries, students? performance in internal and board examinations and the admission procedures. 

 None of the institutions had responded. A second set of questionnaires elicited less than a dozen replies. 

 The principals of the schools also refused to meet the panel members in March. 

 The committee was constituted to suggest ways to regulate the functioning of the 350-odd English-medium schools in the city affiliated to the Delhi-based ICSE and CBSE boards.

 While announcing the setting up of the panel in the Assembly last year, the minister had promised that it would collect information about the schools, especially their fee structures and teachers? salaries, by December 2005. 

 He had stated that the final report of the committee would be submitted to the government by March 31, 2006.

 ?We had a plan to frame the guidelines for regulating the functioning of the schools by April, so that they could be implemented in the 2006-07 session,? Biswas said on Wednesday. 

 The minister, who spearheaded the regulatory move, has not been given nomination by the CPM in the upcoming Assembly elections.

 An increasing number of complaints regarding the quality of education offered by the unaided ICSE and CBSE schools and the fees charged by them had prompted the government to set up the monitoring committee. 

 Legislators from the Opposition had also criticised the Left Front in the House for its failure to check the ?malpractices? by a section of English-medium schools.

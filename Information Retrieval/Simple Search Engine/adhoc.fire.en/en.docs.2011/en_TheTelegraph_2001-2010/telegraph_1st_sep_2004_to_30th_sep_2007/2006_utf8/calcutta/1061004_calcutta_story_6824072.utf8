The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Non-stop cricket 

 Screen On amp; Off

 In case you were wondering about 

 the new logo at the corner of your TV screen as Sourav Ganguly 

 bowled to Sachin Tendulkar on Dashami, well, its an all-new 

 sports channel from the Nimbus group. Joining the clutch 

 of sports channels on the box STAR Sports, ESPN, Ten Sports, 

 Zee Sports and DD Sports is Neo Sports. Positioned as 

 the home of Indian cricket on TV, it is a dedicated 24-hour 

 cricket channel.

 Metro asks Harish Thawani, 

 chairman of Nimbus Communications, about the channel that 

 took guard from October 1, with the Challenger Series.

 We already have so many sports channels on TV...

 Neo Sports is a cricket-centric 

 channel and it will be the first of its kind to address 

 a long-standing consumer need. Also, it will introduce several 

 innovations which foreign broadcasters have failed to address 

 in the area of regional sports coverage multiple-language 

 cricket broadcasts and a focus not just on international 

 but also on domestic Indian cricket.

 Both published research and our 

 own research proves that there is a compelling need for 

 a cricket-centric channel in India and we believe that the 

 public will welcome Indias first cricket TV channel.

 You dont have the telecast rights to the Champions Trophy 

 or the World Cup. How will you generate interest on the 

 channel?

 Nimbus Sport is the exclusive 

 rights marketing agency for both the Champions Trophy and 

 the World Cup. However, these had already been contracted 

 to another broadcaster in 2002 The line-up of cricket on 

 Neo Sports is so compelling that the viewers would get higher 

 quality and more India-centric cricket than ever before. 

 Every year, the channel will be broadcasting three to four 

 international series featuring India and six domestic tournaments 

 adding up to nearly 150 days of live coverage.

 Will you have your own commentary team?

 We will firm up the dedicated 

 commentary team around December. It will consist of a mix 

 of international and Indian experts, and also regional language 

 commentators.

 Will you too promote family viewing for cricket?

 Cricket has always been a family 

 lubricant and we will continue to build on that. We will 

 make our cricket programming more inclusive while not turning 

 the purist away.

 What are the immediate plans in terms of content?

 Sports entertainment is a key 

 bastion of the Neo Sports programming mix. We are currently 

 piloting quite a few concepts, which will then go in for 

 consumer testing.

 How are you planning to sell your channel to the cable operators?

 We have appointed STAR India as 

 the exclusive distributor of Neo Sports for all platforms. 

 STAR has begun installing decoders on cable head-ends and 

 in the next few weeks the channel will have the highest 

 penetration amongst sports channels.

 Anything Calcutta specific in your campaign?

 Calcutta is a priority market. 

 By November-December, we will commence not just specific 

 promotional campaigns for the city but also interactive 

 participation in studio shows as well as on-ground activity.

 What will be the price of the channel on the DTH/CAS platform?

 The pricing will be in conformity 

 with the regulations prevailing from time to time.

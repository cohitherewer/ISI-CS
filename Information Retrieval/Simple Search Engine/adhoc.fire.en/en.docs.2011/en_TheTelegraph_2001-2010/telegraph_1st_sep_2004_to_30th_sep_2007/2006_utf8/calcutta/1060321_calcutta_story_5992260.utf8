 The City Diary

 Cardiologist Devi Shetty called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday and urged him to expedite the proposal for a 5,000-bed international health city near his hospital, Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences. ?We?re seeking 20-30 acres for a health city near the hospital. The idea is to use the facilities of the hospital for the health city and bring down the charges. We plan to reduce the charges for a CT scan to Rs 350 and a heart surgery to Rs 35,000,? Shetty said.

 he first phase of the Rs 1,000-crore health city project includes an international hospital. An hospital for the lower middle class is proposed to come up later. ?We?re are also targeting patients from Europe and West Asia,? Shetty said. The chief minister reportedly asked for a project report and assured Shetty that land would be identified after the elections. According to Shetty, the first phase of the project will be commissioned in 10 months after the allotment of land.

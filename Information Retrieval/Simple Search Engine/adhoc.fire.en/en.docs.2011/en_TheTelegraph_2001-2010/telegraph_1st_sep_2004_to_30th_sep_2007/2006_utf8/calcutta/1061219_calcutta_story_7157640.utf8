 This December, National Geographic Channel is all set to take its viewers to places they have never been before with the new season of the Inside series. The series, which premiered on Monday, will give viewers an insight into incredible events every night at 10 pm till Friday. From launches in outer space to battles for the best winemaker in the world, this week-long series is pure visual delight.

 For our viewers this is an all area access pass to few of the worlds most spectacular events, says Joy Bhattacharjya, senior vice-president of programming, National Geographic Channel India. Metro caught up with Shirley Tse of Hong Kong Tourism Board and fireworks show designer Patrice Guy, who organise the Chinese New Year party in Hong Kong every year. Inside rounds off with this grand event on Friday night which won the Best Value Entertainment Around the World in the Lonely Planet blue list of 2007.

 Metro: On paper, you are organising a party for seven million people. How many of you are working on this big bash and for how many months? 

 Shirley: We have many departments to work together on the Chinese New Year night parade. The department of event management identifies the parade route, recruits overseas performing groups, solicits float sponsors, liaisons with the government on route logistics, etc. The departments of public relations and consumer marketing are responsible for generating publicity. The trade marketing department will use the parade to work with overseas partners on travel packages and attract more visitors to Hong Kong. 

 The entire parade takes us about six to eight months from the concept stage to materialisation. The 2007 Chinese New Year parade will be held on February 18 but the overseas promotions have already started six months in advance. 

 Q: Since it involves a lot of public space, how do you co-ordinate with all the buildings and shops in terms of decoration and lighting?

 A: Letters were sent to all buildings, hotels and restaurant near the parade route about the road closure arrangement. We also work with the traffic police and transport department about traffic diversion during the road closure. To enhance the festive atmosphere, these buildings put up decoration at their own cost.

 Q: What is the security scenario like? What kind of precautions do you take?

 A: Since the parade attracts many roadside spectators (about 250,000 last year), we have Auxiliary Medical Service to set up adequate first-aid posts and ambulances stay on stand by, too. We also work out with police the crowd control issue, ensure that the viewing area does not get too crowded and avoid any bottleneck junction point. Also, mill barriers are set up along the parade route to segregate audiences from the parade procession.

 Metro: How do you co-ordinate the explosion of so many fireworks?

 Patrice: Every barge has a controller on board, which is basically a computer hooked up to a network controlling thousands of electric matches, one for every pyro effect. These controllers are linked by radio to a master control room which runs a master clock and the time code is broadcast to all the controllers. The controllers run a program containing all the timing information for each and every effect.

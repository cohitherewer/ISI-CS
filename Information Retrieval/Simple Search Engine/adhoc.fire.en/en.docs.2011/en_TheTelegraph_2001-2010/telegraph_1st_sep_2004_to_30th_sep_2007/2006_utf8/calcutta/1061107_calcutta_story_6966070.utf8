 Mailbox of 

 male hate

 Flooded by abuse, Chandrima 

 S. Bhattacharya knows what violence is, especially 

 the sort scared men are capable of

 SEX 

 amp; THE CITY

 I learnt a new word today to describe 

 myself. Its misandrist. It is the rarely 

 used feminine equivalent of misogynist, which 

 means woman-hater.

 Now I could simply call myself 

 a man-hater, but that sounds so crude, bald, 

 nasty, brutish and short, that it sounds exactly like a 

 wife-beater. So I looked for a word of Latin origin and 

 am hiding behind it for the time being.

 But I cant escape my fate. 

 Hate mail is pouring into my mailbox from men from every 

 corner of the country, hurling the dreaded word at me. One 

 of the men has threatened to sue me.

 The reason: in my last column, 

 I wondered why men are so scared by the Domestic Violence 

 Act. I said that it is likely that the Act, though most 

 welcome and well-intentioned, may not translate into women 

 reporting the violence against them in far greater number. 

 What are men scared of? 

 I had demanded loftily in the headline in case you want 

 to quote me, because I am famous now after so much mail 

 and can barely keep the sound bytes down.

 The men were so angry. They seemed 

 to have leapt at me straight out of the accompanying cartoon. 

 I think it was the word scared. They charged 

 me with two things. They said I was one-sided, stupid and 

 biased and was deliberately blind to the suffering of men 

 at the hands of women.

 They added that I was criminal 

 in my tendency to avoid the issue of potential misuse of 

 the Act by unscrupulous women just waiting to do unsuspecting 

 men and their families in by lodging false charges, which 

 would be assumed to be the truth by the judiciary under 

 this Act, as they were under the Dowry Act.

 I love the men in my life and 

 I will immediately distance myself from the kind of women 

 that the men warn me of. I agree absolutely there are bad 

 women, terrible women, like there are terrible men. But 

 I just want to say that the enormity of violence against 

 women, and the many subtle, complex ways it happens and 

 the ways in which women accept it make me wonder again how 

 many more women will drag men to court armed with this Act.

 And in the comparison between 

 violence against men and violence against women, women win 

 hands down. What is the ratio? 1:4,000? 1:2,000? 1:1,000? 

 How many men in this country have been burnt by their wives 

 or in-laws? And if any man can point out an Act that has 

 not been misused, let him cast the first stone.

 But what really made me scared 

 and perplexed was the way the mails kept coming, jamming 

 the mailbox, hurling abuse after abuse. I will present some 

 excerpts. The authors reserve all rights to the spelling, 

 syntax and meaning. (DV stands for domestic violence.) 

 Writes Kush Rudra (swa_rupyahoo.co.uk): 

 This is not a LAW at 

 all, this is a AK 47 with out licence, when it will fire 

 not only men, including women and child, whoever will come 

 will be killed. First learn the bais of any LAW, then write. 

 If you do not understand what is law, that does not consider 

 that all will be fooled by your anti male articles.

 I am learning, I am learning. 

 Says Gocool, (drmurahotmail.com): 

 We are not talking bad 

 about the genuine use of this (Act), but trying to shed 

 light and the ample opportunities of misuse (have u ever 

 read DV domestic violence Act, my dear Smiling Budda?) 

 Who is the Smiling Budda? 

 Me? Why? 

 Says Saurabh Ojha (saurabhkoyahoo.com): 

 You do not need to worry 

 about the skewed sex ratio or domestic violence. Thanks 

 to DV act which in the very short time will wake and shake 

 up the society either positively or negatively. In both 

 the cases Feminists are the winners. But its a good sign 

 for young males who either wont marry or marry to 

 Russian Girls. They are far better than the current 

 lot Indian girls. According to them, Indian Husbands 

 are the BEST.

 How do the Russian women know 

 so much? 

 Says Swarup Sarkar (swarup1973gmail.com): 

 Story of Kiranjit Ahluwalia 

 (the UK-based woman who killed her husband after 10 years 

 of inhuman torture and was acquitted) is just an Example. 

 She like thousands of other Indian women in India and around 

 the world is a Hard Core Criminal, who justify her crime 

 and got scot free. But what makes Kiranjit stand-apart is 

 that she found the Loope Whole deep within, which made her 

 finally put an end to the Story and not give any socpe to 

 her husabnd to say the truth. 

 Sure, I want to find the Loope 

 Wholes too they sound like just the thing a woman 

 should be equipped with.

 But two letters really hammered 

 the point in. She needs full dose, says 

 Manish Gupta (m_kiityahoo.com), the three dots 

 ominous.

 Says Swarup (swa_rupyahoo. 

 co.uk): Need some dose this feminist bastered 

 Terrosit Jurnalist.

 At this point, the mailbox collapsed. 

 But I think I know what violence is, especially the sort 

 scared men are capable of. Next week, I will 

 talk jharoo ponchha.

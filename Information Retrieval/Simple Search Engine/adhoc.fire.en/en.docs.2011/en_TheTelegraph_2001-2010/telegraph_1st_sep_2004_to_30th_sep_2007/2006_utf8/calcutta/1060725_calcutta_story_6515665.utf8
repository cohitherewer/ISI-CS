 Isheeta Ganguly 

 in performance at Tollygunge Club. 

 What: Shining Diamonds presented by Tollygunge Club 

 in association with Open Doors and Jetex.

 Where: Tollygunge Club lawns.

 When: Saturday evening.

 Tune in: The musical extravaganza brought together popular 

 jazz, rock, soul, blues and other popular forms.

 The performers for the evening 

 ? Priscilla Corner, Isheeta Ganguly and Jeffrey Menezes 

 ? had a finger right on the the pulse of the audience, blending 

 fast tracks, duets and soft melodies to ensure a thoroughly 

 tuneful experience. 

 Cant help falling in 

 love, Whats love got to do with it, Cabaret... 

 Priscilla regaled the crowd with rock, jazz and Tina Turner 

 hits. With her stage presence, expressions, vocal dexterity 

 and clarity, Priscilla was quite a hit.

 For Isheeta, it was more of jazz 

 and pop. Currently working on her first crossover album, 

 Isheeta belted out I will survive, What a feeling, 

 Working nine to five and Cant take my eyes 

 off you. 

 And the crowd just loved it when 

 Isheeta and Priscilla together crooned I wanna dance 

 with somebody.

 Jeffrey on keyboards enthralled 

 with songs like Besame Mucho, Girl from Ipanema 

 and Georgia. 

 Voiceover: Calcuttans love their share of Bollywood 

 and hip-hop but they enjoy western musical shows like these, 

 too, smiled Oindrilla Dutt from Open Doors.

 Rhythm rage

 Where: Ocio, Belvedere Gardens at 5, Belvedere Road. 

 When: Saturday evening, 8 pm onwards.

 Tune in: An event organised 

 by Young Leaders Forum, this musical affair lasted an hour 

 and 15 minutes. 

 What it saw was some very interesting 

 jugalbandis, great energy and an enthusiastic audience. 

 Bickram (yes, thats how 

 the musician is spelling his name now) enthralled the crowd 

 with signature Rhythmscape melodies peppered with innovations. 

 Conversations and cocktails wrapped 

 up the evening. 

 Voiceover: The idea is to create evenings and 

 offerings that will be attractive to all kinds of people. 

 This is one such party, smiled Sumit Dabriwala, chairman 

 of Young Leaders Forum.

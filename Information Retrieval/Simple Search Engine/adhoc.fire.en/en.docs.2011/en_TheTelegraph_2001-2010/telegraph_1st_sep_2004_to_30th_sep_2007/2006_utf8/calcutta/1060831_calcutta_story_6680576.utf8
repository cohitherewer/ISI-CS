 Screen serenade: Jisshu 

 and Nilanjanaa

 Marriage and motherhood had kept her busy for the past two years. With daughter Sara turning 10 months old, Nilanjanaa is all set to return to Tollywood. One of her co-stars in the comeback vehicle, titled Amra, is husband Jisshu Sengupta with whom she does get into an on-screen relationship.

 Amra has six characters in romantic link-ups and marriages. Though these are all individual stories, they are linked together. The film has a documentary style and there are interviews of the characters, giving an insight into the relationships, says Nilanjanaa.

 The 90-minute film is being directed by New York-based Moinak Bhaumik, who has edited Anjan Dutts The Bong Connection. Apart from the actor couple, Amra stars Parambrata Chatterjee, Ananya Chatterjee, Rudranil Ghosh and Rajatava Dutta.

 The English-Bengali film is being produced by Nitesh Sharmas Bangla Talkies, which had financed Sharon Duttas Raat Barota Panch and the yet-to-release Padakkhep starring Soumitra Chatterjee and Nandita Das.

 I wanted to get back to work and the script of Amra sounded very good. The film is targeted at the youth and the multiplex audience; the language is just the way we speak, says Nilanjanaa, who plays a stage actress in the film.

 My character is married to a professor who has an extra-marital relationship. I go to audition for Noras role in a stage production of A Dolls House where Jisshu is the theatre director, says Nilanjanaa, who last appeared in Swapan Sahas potboiler Agni co-starring Prosenjit. Her other Tollywood films include Subrata Sens Swapner Feriwala and Moloy Bhattacharyas Teen Ekke Teen. 

 Jisshu is very happy that I am working again. Its great that we are in the same film This has been possible because my mother (Anjana Bhowmick) is taking care of our daughter, smiles Nilanjanaa, having kicked off her comeback with a stage show for Zee Bangla this week. The actress shared the stage with Jisshu in a dance number from 1942: A Love Story.

 In the groove: Sabyasachi

 In his fourth tryst with Bollywood after Dil Se, Khakee and Parineeta, Sabyasachi Chakraborty has landed a most meaty role. In Sanjay Chauhans debut feature film Lahore, he plays a stern sports administrator.

 I liked the directors passion 

 for the film and so I agreed to do this role. Im not comfortable 

 playing soft characters; they dont suit me. Id rather 

 play a rough-and-tough character. Here, this man has a strong 

 conviction and no place for compassion when it comes to 

 playing a sport, explained Sabyasachi, better known as 

 Feluda in Bengal.

 Chauhan, trained in martial arts and kickboxing, had earlier assisted Korean film-makers for projects based on martial arts. Im trying my hand at a sports-oriented film based on cricket and kickboxing. It will have a different take on Indo-Pak relations, which will be from the perspective of players and the youth of today, said Chauhan, who chose Sabyasachi after watching his impressive performance in Dil Se. I admire his personality and his ability to perform.

 The film about sportsmen and their spirit stars Pakistani beauty queen Mehreen Sayeed and model Vikas Singh in the lead, with Nafisa Ali playing mother to the protagonist. The cast also includes Sushant Singh, Prashant Narayanan and Pakistani actor Javed Sheikh.

 Chauhan plans to begin shooting next month, in Delhi, Malaysia and then Lahore. We have sent a proposal to the ministry of culture in Pakistan for permission to shoot in Lahore. They are quite enthusiastic Lahore will not have any nationalistic overtones; its more about the mindset of sportsmen and team spirit, said the debutant director.

 M.M. Kreem who composed the music 

 for Sur, Jism and Paheli, will score the tracks 

 for Lahore, slated for a 2007 summer release.

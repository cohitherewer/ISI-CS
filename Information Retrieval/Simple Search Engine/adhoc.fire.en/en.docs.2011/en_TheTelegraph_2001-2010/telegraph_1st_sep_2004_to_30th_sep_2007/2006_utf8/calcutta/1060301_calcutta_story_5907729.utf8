 - SCHOOL BACKS LITTLE YOGA MASTER

 Subir Singh performs an asana. The child has participated in and won championships at both district and state level

 These days, when every boy wants to grow up into a Virendra Sehwag and every girl into a Sania Mirza, opting for a sport like yoga seems to be slightly unusual.

 But by some quirk of a coincidence four years ago, seven-year-old Subir Singh developed an interest in a sport where he did not require expensive equipment to forge ahead. 

 Subir?s father is an unskilled labourer in a factory in Howrah and his daily wages can barely support the family of four. Subir, now 11, is a student of Class V in Guru Nanak Public School, on Andul Road, in Alampur. He lives with his parents and an elder sister, not very far away, in Kadamtala. 

 So, how did Subir develop an interest in yoga? ?Some local boys would practise it in a nearby club and I would watch them every evening. I even learnt some of the asanas by observing them. I told my father that I wanted to get trained in yoga but he could not afford it. One gentleman in the locality offered to teach me at Rs 25 a month,? says Subir. 

 Four years down the line, Subir has participated in and won championships at district and state levels. He topped the All Bengal Yog Kumar and Yog Kumari Competition in 2004 and Howrah District Yogasana Championship in 2005. He stood fourth in the All India Yogasana Championship and Yoga Fashion Contest, 2005. 

 But Subir?s teachers are of the opinion that his career might be thwarted much before it starts taking shape.

 T. John, headmaster of Guru Nanak Public School, says: ?Though Subir is a mediocre student, mainly because of his limited resources, he is very good in yoga. His talent was discovered two years ago ? he could fold his limbs in unusual ways. Now, he has been made a sponsored child and the school provides for his costumes and footwear whenever he goes to participate in any championship.? 

 But this might not continue for long. ?His father is a daily wager and is always suffering from some ailment or the other. After a couple of years, Subir will pull out of his studies, as is the tradition, and start supporting his family. His budding career will come to an abrupt end,? rues John. 

 As of now, the school has big plans for the boy. From the next session, he will be teaching yoga to other students of the school. ?That will be his way to serve the school,? says John.

 Subir?s day starts as early as 4.30 in the morning, when he practises yoga for an hour. He puts in another hour of practice in the evening. ?He is very particular about his practice, but sometimes, he just cannot continue due to lack of nutrition. Then, he thinks of giving it all up,? says sister Neelam.

 In his free time, Subir likes to watch films and follow the achievements of the Indian cricket team very closely. Govinda is his favourite film-star, because he is very funny,? is the quick reply. And his favourite cricketer? ?Dhoni, of course.?

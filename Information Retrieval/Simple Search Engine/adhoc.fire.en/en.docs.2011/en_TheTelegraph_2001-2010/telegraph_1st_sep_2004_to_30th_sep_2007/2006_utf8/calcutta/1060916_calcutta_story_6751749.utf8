 Canal fit for ferry service

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kestopur canal is finally ready for a ferry service, to be kicked off on Mahalaya. The government on Friday successfully held the trial run in the canal from Lock Gate to Lake Town.

 The service, however, will be briefly suspended after the Puja for dredging, said irrigation secretary Sadhan Biswas.

 We are happy that Kestopur canal is finally ready for a ferry service. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the service on Mahalaya (September 22), Deb said.

 Bhattacharjee will also inaugurate a park on the banks of the canal in Ultadanga.

 The trial run saw housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb, accompanied by Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathi, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, travel the route in 45 minutes.

 During the first trial run on August 8, two launches carrying ministers and bureaucrats got stuck in the silt near Ultadanga. The VIPs had to get off the vessels midway. Irrigation officials had to face the wrath of the minister for not desilting the canal properly. 

 Hidco has provided Rs 20 crore to desilt the canal and the transport department has been entrusted to ferry launches.

 Fridays trial run was smooth, as the irrigation department had carried out extensive dredging to increase the depth of the water from two to four metres.

 The canal banks are being beautified and vapour lamps installed. I have asked engineers to complete work within three days, Deb said.

 According to the transport secretary, two 40-seater launches and two 12-seater water taxis will be deployed in the canal. Initially, the launches and water taxis will ply between Lock Gate and Kestopur.

 We hope a large number of people will avail of the service during the Puja. Steps have been taken to ensure passenger convenience, Chowdhury said.

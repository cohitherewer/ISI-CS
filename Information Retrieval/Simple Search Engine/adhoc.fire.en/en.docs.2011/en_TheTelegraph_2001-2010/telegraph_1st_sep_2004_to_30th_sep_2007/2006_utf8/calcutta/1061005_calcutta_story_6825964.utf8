 developing fast, but there are few places where local residents 

 can go to. Our aim was to plug that gap. Along with providing 

 good food and liquor at reasonable prices, we also aim to 

 provide good music to our patrons. At Hard Rock, the focus 

 will be on Bangla rock and band music, said one of 

 the proprietors.

 on one side of the first floor and bright table linen, provides 

 a hangout option for family and friends.

 preparations served here are my recipes, she smiled.

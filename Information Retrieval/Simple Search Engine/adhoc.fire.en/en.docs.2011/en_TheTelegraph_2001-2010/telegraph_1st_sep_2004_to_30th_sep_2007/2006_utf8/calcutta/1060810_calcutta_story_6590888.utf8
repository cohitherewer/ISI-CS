The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 How not to launch a waterway

 - Post-mortem on Venice dream disaster reveals trail of callousness

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Minister Subhash 

 Naskar helped off the launch. A Telegraph picture 

 Two launches set out on Tuesday. 

 One got stuck in the silt in Kestopur canal, near Ultadanga, 

 during a trial run of the chief ministers prized waterway 

 project. A stream of VIPs, including ministers Goutam Deb 

 and Subhash Naskar, on board MV Durga were forced 

 to hop off a wooden plank near the Ultadanga rail bridge. 

 The other launch got stuck near RG Kar Medical College. 

 The much-hyped Noukabihar ended in disaster. It 

 forced three departments irrigation, transport and Hidco 

 (the funding body) into a huddle for a post-mortem on 

 Wednesday.

 TALL CLAIMS: Before the 

 trial run, officials said the canal was ready to receive 

 water from the Hooghly and for the commercial service. The 

 depth was six feet to eight feet. The initial route would 

 be from Bagbazar to Kestopur. The canal banks were strengthened 

 with bricks and their beautification had started. 

 SHORT-CHANGED: The canal 

 was far from de-silted. Officials admitted that the depth 

 of the canal was not more than four feet and at many points, 

 only three feet. Even a country boat cannot sail at three-ft 

 depth. 

 Irrigation officials did not monitor the de-silting. 

 The waterbed was still covered with garbage and fly ash. 

 Water from the river was allowed to flow into the canal 

 without assessment of depth. quot;

 There were not enough trial runs. There was carelessness 

 even in the choice of the two vessels used. The transport 

 departments launch, which ferried the ministers, was 

 new and the driver had no idea of the canal. 

 The lock gate did not function properly and the water 

 receded during low tide. The canal banks in the stretch 

 between Bagbazar and Ultadanga have neither been strengthened 

 nor beautified.

 BLAME GAME: Its a slanging 

 match among departments. Deb, housing minister and Hidco 

 chairman, held a marathon meeting with irrigation officials 

 and ordered them to take immediate action, while irrigation 

 officials said that the transport department launch was 

 faulty. And transport officials said the water was not deep 

 enough, the fault of the irrigation officials.

 ON THE AGENDA: De-silting 

 till six to eight feet all along; strengthening of banks; 

 removal of waste; re-examination of lock gates.

 The action: Deb has asked irrigation 

 officials for immediate rectification, as this is a prestige 

 issue. Theres no hope of an August 15 launch.

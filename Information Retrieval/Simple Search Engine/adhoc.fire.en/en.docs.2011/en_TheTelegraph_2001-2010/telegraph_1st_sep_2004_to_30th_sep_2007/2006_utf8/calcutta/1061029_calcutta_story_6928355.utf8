 Don of movie marketing

 The old vs new debate was a brilliant ploy to engineer trial and get people to watch the film in the first few weeks

 Finally, 

 I have done it. On Friday evening I joined the exclusive 

 club of those who have achieved the rare distinction of 

 watching both the versions of Don. In the last few 

 weeks I have read all that was written about Don. 

 For example, I know that Amitabh Bachchan the original Don 

 has liked the new movie. I marvelled at the modesty of Kareena 

 Kapoor when she said that she was trying to pay her tribute 

 to Helen auntie. Above all, I was deeply impressed by 

 the respect shown by King Khan to Big B and by Farhan Akhtar 

 to his predecessor. 

 Having been impregnated with such stimulating information, the thought of giving the new Don a miss never crossed my mind. My better half was even richer in terms of knowledge. As we had seen the original together many years back, the pressure to do an encore was very high. A house guest was afflicted by the same flu. We were in the same camp, convinced that Shah Rukh can never say Don ko pakarna mushkil hi nahin namumkin hai with as much elan as Big B. This, mind you, was not a reflection of the bias of our generation. It was an objective analysis of the two movies it mattered little that we had not seen one of them till then. I entered the auditorium with a clear head and an unbiased mind.

 It took me the best part of an hour to discover the real plot. I realised that Farhan Akhtar had no intention whatsoever of remaking the old Don. In flavour and substance, he was making just another of his movies, the spine of which had a resemblance to the storyline of the earlier movie. Similarly, Shah Rukh was busy creating another Don and another Vijay. He was smart enough to consciously avoid any duplication of mannerisms or expressions. This is when I felt like Holmes and wanted to say: Elementary, my dear Watson.

 The issue is interesting. Given 

 such strong intentions of the maker and the principal actor 

 to create something completely new, why did they even participate 

 in this whole debate about the original and the current? 

 Why did they name their movie Don in the first place? 

 An unacknowledged pedigree would at best have provoked a 

 not so rare comment that the story is a lift from Don. 

 It would have saved them the trouble of living up to the 

 memory of a movie rather than the movie. It is dangerous 

 to attempt living up to illusions. Yet, they did it.

 A Bollywood film means serious business. Each is worth tens of crores. Most importantly, these days they have a shelf life of just a few weeks. So you need to get as many people to try the movie in those first few weeks. If your product is liked, positive word of mouth would get you people. But that is too risky. It is safer to engineer trial. Attractive promos, interviews and music videos are the weapons that film-makers use to raise curiosity levels.

 This is where Don is different. It had the courage to go off the beaten track and deliberately invite comparisons with the original. Its marketing strategy was based on the Don vs Don platform. From christening the movie to fanning the Big B vs King Khan debate, all actions were a manifestation of a unique strategy to generate more trial. Remember, till you see the movie and maybe even after it, you will not realise that the new Don is not a remake but a fresh creation. Till then your need to compare the old and the new will drag you to the auditorium. It indeed is a brilliant marketing ploy that could say Main Hoon Don.

 This marketing lesson cost me Rs 230 x 3 plus Rs 80 for parking. Expensive, but then good things never come cheap.

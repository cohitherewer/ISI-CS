The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A salute to enterprise

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Do your own thing and hold your head high. 

 At a time when the Tatas and Ambanis are revving up to build more momentum in Bengal, the image of home-grown entrepreneurs is set to get a welcome boost in a city which rarely celebrates its success stories.

 The Bengal chapter of TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs), a global non-profit organisation focused on promoting entrepreneurship, has announced the ?first-ever awards? for entrepreneurs in eastern India. 

 ?The idea is to encourage bright young minds who have the spark, to do something on their own. In Calcutta, traditionally, if you don?t have an in-house mentor, you don?t look at entrepreneurship as a career option. We want to change that perception by showcasing great enterprise,? Shoummo K. Acharya, president of TiE state chapter, tells Metro.

 The TiEger Awards 2006 ? first and second prizes ? have been instituted in IT, ITES, manufacturing, services and social entrepreneurship sectors, and will be given away at a city star address this Friday.

 Formed in Silicon Valley in 1992 by successful NRI entrepreneurs and professionals hailing mainly from the south Asian region, TiE helps budding entrepreneurs with advice, guidance and assistance from successful and experienced entrepreneurs and professionals.

 In partnership with IIM Calcutta, TiE has drawn up specific criteria for screening candidates, and the field has been whittled down to 40, from which the final selection will be made. The screening process for next years awards will start on Friday itself, with separate groups working in different sectors.

 ?Historically, Bengal has been very good in science and arts, but lagging in entrepreneurial ventures. This is a great effort, in synch with today?s changing business scenario,? says industrialist Harsh Neotia, one of the judges for the awards.

 Shekhar Chowdhury, director of IIM Calcutta, and his colleagues Binay Bhusan Chokroborty and Anjan Rai Chaudhari are also on the panel, while the government is represented by commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and IT secretary Siddharth.

 ?For more than 30 years, entrepreneurship has been a dirty word in this state. We are saying it?s a word to be proud of, since one becomes a successful entrepreneur only by dint of hard work,? observes Viji Iyengar, executive officer, TiE state chapter.

 The judges will give ?more weightage? to three pivotal points ? first-generation entrepreneurs, consistent performance for at least three years and innovative ideas. Job creation and turnover will also be considered.

 In an attempt to spread awareness about trafficking of women and children across the border, the Calcutta sector of the Border Security Force conducted a workshop for its jawans at Dakshineswar on Wednesday. 

 Action Against Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation of Women and Children was conducted by the BSF in association with Sanlaap, an NGO which works with people who are illegally brought to India and forced to indulge in illegal activity. The workshop was aimed at sensitising the jawans to prevent trafficking of girls and children from Bangladesh.

 ?The Indo-Bangla border is very long and porous, and at times, unscrupulous elements take advantage of this and try to smuggle in girls from Bangladesh to push them in the flesh trade. These girls are generally from very poor families in Bangladesh, who are lured by these pimps with attractive job offers here,? said S.K. Mitra, former deputy inspector-general, Border Security Force. 

 ?We want to make our jawans aware so that they can recognise the procurers, who can also be a woman, and save the innocent girls who are being trafficked. If our jawans can spend even five minutes interrogating these people, they can easily find them out,? he added.

 While briefing the jawans, Mitra emphasised various types of trafficking. All types of trafficking are illegal migration but all types of illegal migration might not be trafficking. ?A girl can be trafficked in many ways. She can be forcibly married in return for a few thousand rupees or she may be lured with a job in India. These poor girls agree to such deals, hoping that they would be able to support their families by remitting money, and then fall victim to flesh trade rackets operating in India.? 

 The jawans on the border should be more cautious and patient with such girls. ?They might not open their mouths against the procurers if they do not trust you and think they are unsafe in your custody,? Mitra continued. 

 More than 200 BSF jawans from battalion numbers 72, 106, 191, 104 and 193 attended the sensitisation programme. ?Such programmes are quite helpful. Besides training in arms and ammunition, such workshops reveal the human side of BSF, which not only protects the border but also helps in interacting with the people on a regular basis,? said jawan Manpreet Singh.

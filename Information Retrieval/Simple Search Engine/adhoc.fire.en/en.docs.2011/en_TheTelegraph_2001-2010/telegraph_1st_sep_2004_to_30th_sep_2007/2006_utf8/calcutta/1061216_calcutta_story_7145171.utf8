 Jewellery worth lakhs looted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An armed gang of six raided a jewellers workshop in Serpentine Lane, in the Muchipara police station area, on Friday afternoon and decamped with ornaments worth more than Rs 5 lakh.

 The gang took just five minutes to pull off the operation and disappeared in the crowd outside. 

 Police suspect local gangsters were involved in the crime, but no arrests could be made. A hunt is on to track them down, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 Police said the gang entered the workshop owned by Amal Roy around 4 pm. One of the youths stood guard at the door and the others held Roy and his three employees at gunpoint, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (detective department).

 The youths were talking in Bengali and Hindi among themselves, said an officer of Muchipara thana. The employees of the workshop are being grilled, added deputy commissioner Singh. We need to know whether the robbers had been tipped off by insiders.

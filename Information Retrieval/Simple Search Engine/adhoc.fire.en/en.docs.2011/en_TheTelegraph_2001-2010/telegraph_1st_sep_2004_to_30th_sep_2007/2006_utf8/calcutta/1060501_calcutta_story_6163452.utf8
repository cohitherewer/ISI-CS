 Art with familiar seeds 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?It all began with a snake skin I found,? smiled Sonja Weder, sitting amidst her rather amazing art show at Sanskriti Gallery, Alipore. 

 Over the past 16 years, the Swiss artist and husband Thomas Schnider have established Soto Haus, a studio, to display their specially-designed furniture that finds clients across the globe. Sonja has started her artistic career with a successful solo debut on caterpillars.

 ?For me, Nature has always been a great wonder,? said Sonja. ?Often, I used to find large seeds which local people told me came from a creeper. I didn?t believe it till I actually saw the giant pods hanging from a creeper in the forests.?

 Little red-and-black kunj seeds most Bengalis are familiar with acquire a new identity in Sonja?s work. The works are designed as decorative panels and screens. 

 The boards pasted with layers and layers of paper are painted over with acrylic colours on which are affixed seeds/pods, flowers, leaves and, of course, the snake skin. The works, most snapped up by the second day, display a rare feel for forms and patterns.

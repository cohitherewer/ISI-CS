 Cable TV eyes industry tag 

 - Fair ahead to promote tech upgrade via digitisation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Cable TV Equipment Traders and Manufacturers Association (CTMA) is hopeful of the Centre granting industry status to the cable TV sector, considering the business and employment it generates.

 The association also wants benefits that would put the sector on a par with the information technology and telecommunication industries, CTMA secretary K.K. Binani said on Tuesday.

 The CTMA is organising a fair at Netaji Indoor Stadium from November 24 to 26 to promote technology upgrade through digitisation. We will also hold seminars and interactive sessions with representatives from across the industry, including cable operators and multi-system operators (MSOs). Union information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi will attend the programme, said chairman of the exhibition committee Pawan Jajodia.

 The cable trade, with an annual turnover of Rs 15,000 crore across the country and employing 1.5 million people, is one of the fastest expanding in the world. In Calcutta, where the turnover is around Rs 350 crore, the growth rate is faster than in most places. This is one of the reasons why we are holding the show in the city, Jajodia explained.

 Binani said the association is trying to convince the government to cut down import duty on equipment and waive the value-added tax (VAT).

 Duty-free import of equipment is allowed to both the IT and telecom sectors. I feel the Centre should grant similar concessions to the cable TV sector as well, Binani observed.

 A digital set-top box, a must for TV viewing post-CAS, costs Rs 2,000. It would come down by 20 to 25 per cent once the Centre waives off import duty and VAT on the purchase, he pointed out. This year, we are coming out in support of CAS and are trying to make the cable firms aware of its implication. 

 Around 30,000 participants from across the country and Bangladesh and Nepal are likely to take part in the fair. Products and services of over 45 international vendors will be displayed at the venue.

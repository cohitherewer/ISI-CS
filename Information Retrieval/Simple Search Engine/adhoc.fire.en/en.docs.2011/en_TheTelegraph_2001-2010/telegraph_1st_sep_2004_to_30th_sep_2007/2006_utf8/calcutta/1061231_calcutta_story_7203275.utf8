 Bit of Babylon amp; Bond

 New Year resolutions are about as common as year-end parties, and nowhere more so than in the virtual world. And Netizens are even making anti-resolutions!

 Anonymous (http://www. piecesofmind. blogspot.com) in a post titled My New Years anti-resolutions writes: I used to make New Years resolutions. A few of them I even kept. Then I stopped doing the resolution thing. Almost every year it was the same: Be more organised. Lose 10 pounds. Become a nicer person.

 It has occurred to him/her that New Year resolutions are overrated since we usually resolve to do something or take some initiative. Whereas we could just as well resolve to not do something, or resolve to continue what were already doing. Anti-resolutions, in other words.

 According to Mitali Saran (http://mitalisaran. blogspot.com), The end of the year always feels like a purification ritual, with all sins of commission and omission cleansed in an antiseptic cocoon of food, alcohol and sociability

 She found out online that the concept of New Year resolutions dates back to ancient Babylonian spring celebrations about 4,000 years ago. Its now a beloved ritual, but the whole idea is widely held to be a bit of a joke since most people crack under the pressure within a few weeks, like those who mean to quit smoking; or within a few days, like those who decide to spend more time with the family.

 At http://www.nowpublic.com, 2006 is described as a banner year for celebrity splits. The 10 best break-ups include Britney Spears-Kevin Federline and Paul McCartney-Heather Mills.

 Looking forward to 2007, Rajeev (http://rajeev2004.blog spot. com) is a little nervous because the dollar is nose-diving against the Euro and other strong currencies (although not against the rupee).

 An e-mail doing the rounds sums up the mood: 2007 is Bonds favourite year! It starts and ends on a Monday and has maximum holidays as no public holiday is on a Saturday or a Sunday! So go ahead and enjoy the New Year!

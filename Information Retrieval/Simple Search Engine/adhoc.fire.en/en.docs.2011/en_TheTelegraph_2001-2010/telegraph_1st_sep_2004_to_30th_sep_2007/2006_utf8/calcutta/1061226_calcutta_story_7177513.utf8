 Images of innocence

 Veteran painter Bankim Banerjees art is inspired by folk art, tribal art and scroll painting. The most common theme of his works is rural life, in which he attempts to illustrate the fundamental relation of man with nature. Earth Voices, the ongoing solo exhibition of his works, reflects the beauty and simplicity of rustic life. The paintings on show are also an expression of his own mind; the images of birds and flowers, skies and fields, and innocent children, mirroring the straightforwardness, sensitivity and compassion of the artist himself. Romantic and lyrical in tone and temper, they deal with the expression of feelings like love, naivet, curiosity, awe, wonder and happiness. Often, they may lead the viewer to recall the pure and undisguised artlessness of the little boy in Blakes celebrated The Lamb in his Songs of Innocence. As in Blake, the figures in Banerjees paintings also appear to be creations of divine grace.

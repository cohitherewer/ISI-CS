 Kalam note has CU on toes

 - Campus drawing up course content for virtual university

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Its rush hour for all the departments in Calcutta University (CU). 

 Early this week, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had written to vice-chancellor Ashis Kumar Banerjee, seeking details of the courses offered by the university for the virtual university plan announced last year.

 Acting on the directive of the President, the heads of all the 65 departments of the 150-year-old CU are busy preparing reports on the syllabi structure and curriculum content of all the courses offered at the undergraduate, postgraduate and Ph.D level.

 The letter is an indication that the countdown to the Presidents dream project of a virtual university, involving Calcutta, Madras and Mumbai universities, has began, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, dean of science, CU.

 The concept of a virtual university revolves around the idea of three premier varsities of the country, all having completed 150 years this year, working together for exchanging academic and research programmes.

 The President had announced the programme of offering collaborative courses and conducting joint research projects in October last year.

 Initially, the programme will be launched for Ph.D and postgraduate students. Later, it will cover undergraduate courses in all three universities.

 By the latest plan, the syllabi of courses in all three varsities will be compiled and a subject-wise comparative study conducted to chalk out the syllabi structure of the proposed virtual university. 

 The curriculum of the proposed university will take elements from the curricula of the three universities. The President is overseeing the whole process, Chattopadhyay said.

 Under the proposed plan, students will be able to avail of a unique facility to study any course at any of the three universities. For instance, a first-year student at CU can move to Madras or Mumbai universities for his second and third year of graduation, explained a university official. 

 One of the key objectives of the programme is to provide an opportunity to students, teachers and research scholars to avail of the best facilities of the three universities while studying a course.

 The HRD ministry has provided a grant of Rs 50 crore each to the universities. A major portion of the fund is being utilised to develop the virtual university.

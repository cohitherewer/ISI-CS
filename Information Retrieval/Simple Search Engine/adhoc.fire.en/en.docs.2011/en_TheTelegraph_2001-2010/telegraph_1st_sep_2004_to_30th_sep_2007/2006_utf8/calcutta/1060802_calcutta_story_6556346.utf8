 Tanner shift demand on police desk

 KINSUK BASU

 Rattled by the failure of several tanneries to shift from their current locations to the Bantala Leather Complex, in violation of a Supreme Court directive, the state pollution control board has shot off a letter to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, asking him to intervene immediately. 

 The letter has categorically asked the city police chief to take necessary action to ensure that the tannery units do not operate from their present locations. It has also asked him to take action against any person (or a unit) who may be directly or indirectly helping a tannery-owner to continue with his operations. 

 A copy of the letter has been sent to the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas. 

 The Supreme Court had passed an order saying that tannery-owners could no longer operate from their present locations. But the ground reality suggests that some units are yet to move out. We have, therefore, asked the agencies concerned to take steps so that the order of the apex court is upheld, wrote Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the board. 

 The letter comes in the wake of a recent survey by the board, which revealed that several tannery units across parts of Tiljala, Tangra and Topsia, on the eastern fringes of the city, were secretly operating and there was no effort on their part to shift base to the leather complex in Bantala.

 Apart from small-time operators (functioning from space varying between 400 and 700 sq ft), several large tannery-owners were functioning from South Tangra in clear violation of the court directive. In most cases, neither was any step taken to check pollution nor was effluent treated.

 Based on these findings, the board top brass had recently met representatives of the state administration, including officials of the ministry of commerce and industry, to discuss the issue of shifting the tannery units.

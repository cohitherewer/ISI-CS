The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 champs

 The girls from Our 

 Lady Oueen of the Missions, Salt Lake, put up a good 

 performance in Unconventional Orchestra on WednesdayThe 

 Eastern Vocal Music contest and Antakshari went on simultaneously 

 on Wednesday morning. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta and

 The spirit of Sona Chandi The 

 Great TTIS Challenge continued untramelled on Day 

 Two and Three of the preliminary rounds. It was hard to 

 believe that the fest-cum-carnival had only begun. But that 

 wasnt unexpected with students from more than 105 schools 

 jostling to make it to the finals in an array of events.

 Melody makers

 Twenty six groups battled it out 

 to the strains of music in the Western Group Music contest 

 on November 28, each with five minutes to impress the judges. 

 From rock to rap and even hymns, the young crooners tried 

 a bit of everything. The intriguingly-named group Wrong 

 Number from Salt Lake School sang original numbers. Insurrection, 

 which we performed, was composed by us, said Rathindranath 

 Kundu, the lead singer. The Don Bosco, Park Circus band 

 had the audience loving it as they crooned Ozzy Osbournes 

 Mama Im coming home.

 Although the competition was tough, 

 it didnt stop the contestants from showering praise on 

 their rivals. They were simply superb, was how Rajib Sarkar, 

 the base guitarist of the group from Don Bosco, Park Circus, 

 rated Frank Anthony Public Schools rendition of Zombie 

 by The Cranberries. In between performances, the hosts threw 

 questions at the audience. Correct answers fetched goodies 

 from TTIS.

 Matching steps

 Groups in dancing gear were queuing 

 up near the stage even before the Western Group Music contest 

 had been wrapped up. 

 A total of 64 schools rocked the 

 stage in colourful attire. Props ranging from basketballs 

 to Japanese fans and cardboard sunflowers added a dash of 

 innovation to the movements. 

 Hips Dont Lie by Shakira 

 and Aashiqui Meri from the film 36 China 

 Town were the popular accompaniments. The boys from 

 Ivory Hall School didnt miss the chance to jive to the 

 tunes of Shakira and Who Let the Dogs Out by Baha 

 Men.

 The eight girls from Our Lady 

 Queen of the Missions, Salt Lake went on stage to perform 

 what can only be labelled tribal-hip hop in jute dresses 

 made by themselves. Some of the dance items were based on 

 Bengali adhunik and jibonmukhi songs by Lopamudra 

 Mitra and Fossils and bhangra beats. 

 East is best

 Day Three of the prelims started 

 off with Antakshari and Eastern Vocal (solo), the biggest 

 event with over 150 participants. There is so much talent 

 in them. With proper training many of them can make it big 

 in the music industry, smiled Pandit Shantanu Bandopadhyay, 

 one of the judges. Antakshari was a popular draw with participants 

 drawing from a repertoire of Bollywood oldies and chartbusters 

 Sound use

 The Eastern Vocal contest continued 

 after Unconventional Orchestra had kicked off.

 Unlikely objects ranging from 

 iron pipes, earthen pots, upturned buckets to wooden boards 

 and even shoes were turned into musical instruments. Vivekananda 

 Mission School used empty coke cans, struck dried leaves 

 on a twig with paintbrushes, to replicate the sounds of 

 the jungle. Future Foundation School made music out of scrubbing 

 brushes rubbed together and a hollowed buffalo horn used 

 as a conch. 

 According to judge Gourab Chatterjee 

 of Lakkhichhara: Some of the performances sounded like 

 proper musical compositions with each instrument adding 

 a distinct sound, rather than being there just for the sake 

 of it.

 Crooner Chenelle had students 

 on their feet at the end of the day to Shakiras latest 

 hit Hips Dont Lie. 

 A screening of Lage Raho Munnabhai 

 as part of the film festival organised along the sidelines 

 of the fest-cumcarnival ended Day Three.

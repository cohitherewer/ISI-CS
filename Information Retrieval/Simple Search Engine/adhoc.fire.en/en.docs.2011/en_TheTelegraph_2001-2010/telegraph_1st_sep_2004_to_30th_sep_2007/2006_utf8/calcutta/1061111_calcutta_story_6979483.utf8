The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Salt Lake sounded dry alert by 2009 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Present 

 consumption: Six million gallons of filtered 

 water per day

 Supply capacity: 10 

 million gallons per day

 Projected consumption: 

 11 million gallons per day

 Salt Lake township is hurtling towards a water crisis by end-2008.

 The dry warning was served by a joint survey, titled Bidhannagar PPP Study, conducted by the municipality and French firm Seureca.

 The aim was to explore the feasibility of outsourcing water supply, sewerage, drainage and solid waste management of the township through a public-private partnership.

 In its final report, the experts pointed out that the projected demand for potable water in the Salt Lake area, excluding Sector V, would exceed supply capacity by end-2008. And the daily demand will rise to 20 million gallons by 2020.

 Bidhannagar Municipality does not have its own water treatment plant. It gets a daily supply of filtered surface water from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). According to an agreement, the municipality can get a maximum of 10 million gallons of filtered water per day.

 There is an underground reservoir with a capacity of five million gallon per day for an emergency. Salt Lake will pay heavily for such myopic planning unless another additional reservoir is constructed.

 As a knee-jerk response to growing consumer needs, the civic authorities have recently decided to extend the filtered water supply time from seven to 12 hours a day.

 Those conducting the survey warned that unless a new underground reservoir was built, supply might have to be slashed to six hours a day in the near future to bridge the demand-supply gap.

 The French team also laid down some preconditions for outsourcing water supply in Salt Lake: 

 Extend service in Sector 

 IV amp; V

 Supply only surface water 

 relying on Rajarhat water treatment plant and CMC supply

 For residual chlorine, 

 iron and sulphate content, European Union and WHO guidelines 

 to be followed 

 Extend supply hours from 

 seven to 12 hours per day

 Ensure 10-metre pressure 

 in the pipeline.

 Secure production of surface 

 water to meet demand.

 Committed to research, patronage and promotion of Bengali stage songs for over two decades, Academy Theatre has now expanded its cultural horizon to include activities of allied interest. This evening?s programme, dedicated to the memory of Surajlal Mukhopadhyay (picture left), marks a pioneering initiative towards sharing invaluable information and archival knowledge about Bengali songs of an era beginning more than 50 years ago.

Sharing memories and anecdotes about songs heard on records, of singers and the impact they generated on the contemporary audience, the talk will also throw light on Surajlal Mukhopadhyay?s immense contribution in creating and maintaining a vast collection of Bengali songs.

Life

 For a kitchen cute amp; colourful

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Amodish microwave, steel pullout drawers, a swanky chimney and an overall wooden finish accentuating the look ? you might have spent quite a handful but with all this you are the proud owner of a brand new modular kitchen.

 l it takes to mar the look completely are the shabby plastic containers, old health-drink bottles now filled with spices, cups in boring browns and plain whites along with age-old steel pots.

 Wondering what could be the solution to this little household hazard? 

 Well, all you need for a complete kitchen makeover is a splash of colour and cheer and Nik Nish is a place to scout. Home to cute porcelain containers, it is the place to go if you want to be kitchen proud.

 l imported from China, the variety will spoil you for choice. A circular container with polka dots in brown, maroon and yellow has a cheerful cow in yellow and pink right in front.

 On the lid too you have Mr Cow siting all by himself on top, his smile in place. A big pitcher-like container has bright yellow peaches hanging from leafy branches.

Squarish containers with handles come in pairs of two. Adorned with beautiful roses in electric red or yellow, these are placed back to back and look like one big holder. They look different, are appealing and have a great finish. Customers opt for these not only for the kitchen but also for placing them at the dining table, or even in the dressing unit to pack in cosmetics and accessories, says manager Harjeet Singh.

 A milk pot in pale yellow colour complete with a co-ordinated sugar pot has a woven appeal. 

 While the sugar pot is embellished with banana leaves, the milk pot is decorated with bananas. Longish cups with the body-like spiral grooves come along with lids with a tiny butterfly at the top. 

 Then there is a bowl adorned with a black and white smiling dog, its tongue sticking out. Another big bowl looks like a violet-coloured flower peppered with shades of white. There are also smaller ones with sunflower motifs.

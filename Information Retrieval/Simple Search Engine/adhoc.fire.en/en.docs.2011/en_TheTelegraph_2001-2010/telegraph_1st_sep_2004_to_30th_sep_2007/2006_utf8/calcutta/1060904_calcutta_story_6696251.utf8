 Shankar Mahadevan

 No, no, we are ready for all kinds of comparisons with the original soundtrack, says Shankar Mahadevan on his cellphone, while driving down from Mumbai to Vashi. The strains of Yeh mera dil, playing on the car stereo, not only punctuates his words but reiterates the fact that if indeed there are comparisons, the Shankar Ehsaan Loy score will not fall short of Kalyanji Anandjis trendsetting compositions.

 The idea at no point of time was to outdo the 1978 film or its music, clarifies the singer-composer. To be honest, we all wanted to have good fun. Why would Shah Rukh Khan try to be an Amitabh Bachchan when he is so big in his own way? Why would Kareena Kapoor do an item number when she is a top heroine? The movie is a tribute to a great movie, and so is the music.

 Shankar admits it wasnt easy to choose which songs to keep from the original and which ones to replace. Farhan (Akhtar) felt Yeh mera dil and Khaike paan Banaraswala were integral to the Don experience, he explains. So for these two songs, we just added our little elements and made them a little more interesting. And for the other song situations we came up with brand new tracks because we believed we could do a slightly better job than the original numbers.

 But why not keep a cult track like Arey deewanon in the new movie? The way Shah Rukhs Don has been created, the original title track wouldnt have worked, Shankar says. The new Don is very sophisticated, very stylish. So, keeping that in mind our Main hoon Don is very modern, ultra-electronic in sound. But to maintain the essence of the original Don, we have used the theme Kalyanji Anandji used during the opening credits. The moment you hear that, you can associate the new movie with the old one.

 Theres no Yeh hai Bambai nagariya in Farhans Don either. For that situation we have done the Ganapati song called Maurya re, says Shankar, whos sung it himself. In the film, it is the introduction song of the other Shah Rukh. He is a vocalist in a Ganapati mandal where he also plays the bulbul tarang.

 Even for the new Khaike paan Banaraswala sung by Udit Narayan, lyricist Javed Akhtar has written a few new lines, which have been mouthed by Shah Rukh himself. Oh, hes done a great job in the song, exclaims Shankar. He told me he was nervous but I am sure he wasnt. He took all of 15 to 20 minutes to do his lines. Shah Rukh is such a confident actor, such a perfectionist.

 Don just keeps the Shankar Ehsaan Loy bandwagon rolling on. We are very pleased with the response to our music, Shankar spells it out. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna the movie may have got mixed reviews but everyone loved the music. Next, we will be heard in Nikhil Advanis Salaam-e-Ishq, Sajid Khans Hey Baby, Shaad Alis Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, a film by Anil Kapoor, and Zoya Akhtars film with Hrithik and Kareena.

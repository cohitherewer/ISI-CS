The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Despite several complaints in this column, the tunnel for pedestrians in the 

Dum Dum underpass remains pitch dark at night. Lights are installed for a few 

days, only to be stolen by thieves. The tunnel also continues to be filthy, thanks 

to beggars and vagabonds. The only new development is that the passage to the 

stations from the underpass is being taken over by hawkers. A few stalls have 

also come up. Most of them are run by Bangladeshi immigrants.

 The main approach road to Sarsuna Satellite Township has been encroached by 

builders, who have dumped building material on the road. Buses are also parked 

on its sides and washed with water, thus dirtying the entire carriageway. Most 

of the residents of the township are salaried and have to use the stretch to reach 

their offices and return home. The administration urgently needs to look into 

the matter. 

 P. Chowdhury, Sarsuna. 

 With so much concern for pollution in every part of the world, it is time the 

government did something about the noise level in Calcutta. One of the main culprits 

behind the amount of noise on the streets are private buses and minibuses, many 

of which use piercing electric horns. The problem is acute on the outskirts of 

the city. Unless stringent steps are taken, a major portion of the population 

might turn deaf. 

 R. Kar, Garia.

Man of steel money

Screen On amp; Off

 Miss Careful Whispers meets the Man of Steel in this Sunday?s episode of Rendezvous with Simi Garewal.

 Simi does a first by moving out of her studio setting and visiting Lakshmi Niwas Mittal in his London mansion.

 Apart from providing rare glimpses of Mittal Mansion and photographs of the family, the episode finds the richest Indian in the world talking about his childhood, his success formula, the risks he has taken and the failures he has faced. And yes, he does dwell at length on his bid for Arcelor.

 The story of a boy from Sadulpur village in Rajasthan to his growing-up years in a small flat near central Calcutta to the creator of the biggest steel empire in the world is revealed, at leisure, on April 30, 9.30 pm on STAR World.

 On the contentious flavour of the moment, the Arcelor affair, Mittal says: ?We have always believed in consolidation of the steel industry. And these two companies are complementary to each other? I?m very confident that we will be able to convince all the stakeholders including government, society, employees, the community, that this is the right move forward.?

 When asked what money means to the ?third richest man in the world?, Mittal says: ?I have very limited expenses so beyond that it means nothing? As a person I have not changed.? So what drives this tycoon? ?The satisfaction of doing something different and unique. which is more important than money.?

 Next Sunday, Rendezvous with Simi Garewal returns with Lakshmi and wife Usha Mittal, and special glimpses of ?the most expensive wedding of the century?, Vanisha Mittal with Amit Bhatia.

danced all night at Shisha on Friday. She arrived at the popular hookah bar around 

midnight and stayed put till 4 am, when DJ Girish played her favourite tracks 

Kajra re (Bunty aur Babli) and Tumse milke (Main Hoon 

Na) to bring the curtains down. The former beauty queen had a blast, dancing, 

chatting and munching on light bites.

 Ever since the Oscars, there?s been an English film bonanza on the big screens in town. And this week, there?s something for everyone at the multiplexes. For the youngest age-group, Ice Age 2 has finally arrived. The sequel to the successful 2002 animation film from 20th Century Fox brings back the familiar faces of Manny, Sid, Scrat and the rest.

 For the fun crowd, there?s a prequel to the previous Pink Panther films. The latest offering has Steve Martin playing the famous French detective, creating chaos as he solves the murder of a famous soccer coach and recovers the stolen Pink Panther diamond. The star cast of the action comedy includes Kevin Kline and Beyonce Knowles.

 For those with a Holly-Bolly hang-up, there?s Aishwarya Rai and Dylan McDermott in Mistress of Spices. The story by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni about an Indian woman in San Francisco healing people through her spicy remedies is directed by Paul Mayeda Berges, husband of Gurinder Chadha.

 For some intellectual stimulation, turn to the Oscar-nominated Hotel Rwanda at Nandan. The critically-acclaimed 2004 film starring Don Cheadle portrays the Rwandan genocide in the ethnic clashes between the Hutus and Tutsis.

 And finally, for the gape gang there?s Basic Instinct 2 ? Risk Addiction, with Sharon Stone doing a repeat performance as Catherine Tramell ? okay, not quite, as she does not uncross her legs ? but this time without Michael Douglas and with David Morrissey.

 5 mishaps, 3 deaths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wheels claimed three lives and left two men critically injured in five accidents on Wednesday.

 Hawker Suresh Chandra Saha, 58, was on his way to his pavement stall near Triangular Park around 12.25 pm when he was knocked down by a Calcutta State Transport Corporation bus at Gariahat. He was run over by the rear wheels.

 Local shop-owners and hawkers turned violent. They stopped the bus, dragged down the driver, beat him up, and smashed the windscreen (picture above by Amit Datta).

 They also blocked the road for over half-an-hour, till police dispersed them with a mild lathicharge. The driver, Dilip Chakraborty, has been arrested and the bus impounded. The mob damaged the vehicle, said Dulal Chakraborty, officer-in-charge of Gariahat police station.

 Saha, a resident of Gobindapur Road in the Lake area, had come to meet me, said Atanu Das, a hawker who sells garments near the Gariahat crossing. As he was crossing the road, the speeding bus hit him from behind. The driver spotted Saha in time but did not bother to slam the brakes.

 In another mishap, 40-year-old Ashoke Dutta hurriedly got off a private bus after being caught trying to pick a pocket and was run over by the rear wheels. The incident occurred in Lake Town around 9.30 am. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical.

 We impounded the bus, but the driver managed to flee, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). Residents said the mishap occurred near Block A of Lake Town, a stones throw from the local police station.

 Passengers caught Dutta while he was trying to pick the pocket of a man. They raised an alarm, unnerving Dutta, who started running towards the rear gate. With the passengers trying to grab him, he jumped off the moving bus, said Bhabesh Sen, a witness.

 A rickshawpuller was injured after being hit by a private bus near the Bank of India crossing, in Bowbazar, on Wednesday afternoon. He was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital. A mob beat up a conductor of the bus.

 Sikandar Ali, 22, was knocked off his motorcycle by a taxi on Rifle Range Road. He was rushed to Chittaranjan Hospital, where he was declared dead. An unidentified man, aged 34, was run over by an unknown vehicle in front of Goenka College on BB Ganguly Street. He died on the spot.

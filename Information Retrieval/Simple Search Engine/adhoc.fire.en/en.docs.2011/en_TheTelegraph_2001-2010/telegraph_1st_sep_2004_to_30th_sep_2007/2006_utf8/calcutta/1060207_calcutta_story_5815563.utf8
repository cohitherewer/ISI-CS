 It's Your Birthday So...

 Your strength lies in your ability to forget and forgive. You know the importance of giving space to people; you hardly ever impose yourself upon them. Failures do not dampen your spirits. You have an agile and sharp mind. Your diplomatic skills are praiseworthy; you always know the right thing to say. You are a good decision-maker, even on your worst days. ? Kusum Bhandari

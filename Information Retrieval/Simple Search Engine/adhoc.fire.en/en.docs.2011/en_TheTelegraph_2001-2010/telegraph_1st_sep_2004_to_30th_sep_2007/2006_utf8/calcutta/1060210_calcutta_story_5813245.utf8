 Measure for measure

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Were the sidewalks and toilets clean? Was the security staff courteous? Did you find the lighting level satisfactory at common spaces and the parking areas? Did the shopping and F amp;B options satisfy you?

 Favourable response to a clutch of queries in exit interviews to monitor customer perception of the mall has earned City Centre a systems stripe.

 The eat-shop-hangout rendezvous at Salt Lake has become the first retail mall in India to get the Det Norske Veritas AS Management System Certificate, ISO 9001:2000 for mall management and maintenance services.

 The certification, from DNV Certification B.V. of The Netherlands, was awarded to Bengal Ambuja Metro Development Limited, developers of the mall. City Centre had commissioned Quality Management Consultancy Services (QMCS) to assess and upgrade its systems to make the project eligible for ISO certification.

 We check compliance of basic requirements and effectiveness of systems. There are requirement checkpoints for both internal and external consumers, with integrity and professionalism being the key checkpoints, explains Prasun Kundu, district manager, east India and Bangladesh, DNV, who supervised the audit.

 The self-correction exercise, set rolling immediately after the property was inaugurated in June 2004, is being carried out based on occupant and visitor feedback reports with the help of QMCS. The goal is to raise the bar in steps through SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, related, time-bound) targets, says K. Bose of QMCS.

 ISO speaks of continuous improvement in quantitative terms. The idea is to help the mall management put in place a system of checks and balances to ensure all elements function smoothly, Bose stresses.

 The management, which needed 15 months to prepare for the ISO format since there was no benchmark to go by, promises to monitor mall mechanics through handheld personal computers soon. We are striving to ensure that our occupants and visitors are able to spend quality time at City Centre in a clean, hygienic and secure environment, says CEO Vineet Verma.

 With customer relationship management assuming greater importance every day, more and more retail projects would line up for ISO certification, feels Kundu of DNV. Such rating was always important for the manufacturing sector, but the need wasnt felt so much in the service sector till recently. All that is set to change now, he observes.

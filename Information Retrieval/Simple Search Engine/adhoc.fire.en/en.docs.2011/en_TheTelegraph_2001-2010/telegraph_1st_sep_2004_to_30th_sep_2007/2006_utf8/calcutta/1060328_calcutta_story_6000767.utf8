The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Suspended, reinstated, showcaused

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The Calcutta University authorities have slapped a showcause notice on a teacher who has been refusing his salary, demanding that the arrears accrued during a suspension period be cleared first, and in one instalment.

 Srimanta Kumar Raut, a reader in the zoology department, has been refusing salary ever since he was suspended in July 1995 and the amount the university owes him now is a staggering Rs 27 lakh.

 The authorities have proposed to clear the dues in instalments, a condition Raut has refused to accept. ?We are ready to clear all his dues, but the mode of payment will be decided by us,? asserted registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.

 Raut, reinstated in 1998, countered: ?I have lost a few precious years of my profession. I would have been a professor by now had I not been suspended. My family, too, has suffered. If the university does not pay all my dues in one instalment, I will continue to teach without any remuneration.?

 The registrar said Raut had committed an ?act of indiscipline? by refusing his salary every month. ?We will take action against him if he fails to give a satisfactory reply to the showcause notice.?

 Raut was suspended for three years for retaining the answer scripts of some M.Sc (zoology) students beyond the last date of submission. Though he was prevented from taking classes, he kept attending the university and was involved in research, including helping students and scholars, all through the suspension period.

 He was entitled to 50 per cent of his salary during the period, which he refused, saying he had committed no wrong and the suspension was ?unjustified?.

 Raut rejoined service after the suspension period came to an end, but kept refusing his salary. 

 Recalling the 1995 examinations, he said: ?I found that a particular question had been repeated twice. It was a gross mistake, as it gave an opportunity to students to answer the same question twice.?

 Some students had, in fact, done just that, prompting Raut to seek clarifications from the university on how to evaluate the scripts. The university reportedly did not respond to the plea, and Raut did not submit the scripts. He, however, denied having ?retained the scripts for a long time?.

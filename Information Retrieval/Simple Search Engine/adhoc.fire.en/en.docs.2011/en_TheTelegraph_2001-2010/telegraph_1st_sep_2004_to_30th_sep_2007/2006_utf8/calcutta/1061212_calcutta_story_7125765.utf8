The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Europe edge 

 for exclusivity

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 LIFESTYLE 

 ZONE

 Calcutta has just acquired a brand 

 new style stop in Vizyon. Housed at 23A Ballygunge Place 

 (near 6 Ballygunge Place), Vizyon means vision in French, 

 but its ensemble exotica here covers Europe well beyond 

 French fashion Austria, Italy, Spain and New Zealand to 

 be precise. 

 The connection comes in the form 

 of fabric, embellishments and styling. But most garments 

 boast a deeper tie they are the product of a joint effort 

 of foreign designers and team Vizyon. Shopping for 

 strictly western outfits is almost impossible abroad. Either 

 the necklines are too plunging or the hemlines too rocketing 

 or the fabric is not weather-friendly. We are trying to 

 adapt western ensembles for the global Indian woman, crafting 

 style statements rather than mere clothes. Our vision is 

 to present to Calcutta lots of style, exclusivity and very 

 high quality, says Shradha Murarka, proprietor-designer 

 of Vizyon. 

 Decor details

 International and contemporary, 

 the interiors of Vizyon do mirror its style sentiment. There 

 are two highlights at the store a wired chandelier and 

 a stone-glass-wood mural made by Shradha. The mural 

 depicts Vizyon. Its got a pebble street, a doorway, 

 some stone chips, a mannequins hand, a mirror and 

 a dash of green, she says. 

 The rest of the store is simple 

 wood flooring that blends into stone tiles and white walls, 

 brick-like. The store has no racks. Its all like a 

 walk-in wardrobe.

 We wanted to recreate the 

 eternal what-to-wear dilemma right here. Its like 

 standing in front of your cupboard, trying to choose an 

 outfit, says Shradha. 

 The nightwear and western collections 

 are in a running wardrobe; a closed cupboard opens up to 

 reveal a range of cocktail saris.

 The trial room takes the streamlined, 

 luxurious feel a step forward. Well-lit and spacious, it 

 houses a chair for the accompanying friend.

 We want to make a woman 

 feel truly pampered, explains Shradha. 

 Style story

 Colour or cut, shape or silhouette, 

 the idea from the start is immensely international. One 

 quick glance and the latest trends come to the fore in a 

 flash. True to forecasts, Vizyons collections feature 

 the current craze only. Lots of ivory, lots of blacks, lots 

 of jackets and lots of dresses It also has a nightwear 

 collection and a cocktail range of saris. 

 Our fabrics are the focus. 

 We are proud to say they are the very best in the world, 

 on par with the likes of Chanel, Gaultier and YSL 

 says Shradha. Spanish lace, French chiffon, cotton mesh, 

 net, light velvet, satin, faux fur Used individually or 

 fused as layers.

 The emphasis is on the styling, 

 essentially western in essence, evident also in the sari 

 section. Nets combined cleverly with geometric prints, ribbon-work 

 and delicately shaded lace... the range is eclectic. The 

 blouses are experimental too some long-sleeved ruffled 

 tops, others simple styles. 

 Each garment has another speciality. 

 It is always a single piece. No other colour, 

 not even another size, because exclusivity is 

 the prime concern. When someone buys a Vizyon creation, 

 they are completely satisfied because they are the only 

 ones in the world to have it, claims Shradha.

 A quirky glass stand holds equally 

 quirky accessories. All handpicked from across Europe, they 

 find pride of place here. Hand-pressed blends of silk, chiffon 

 and felt form a fun neck accessory. Brooches, earrings and 

 bags are other pieces to complete the experience. But 

 accessories may not be regular. It depends on the mood of 

 the moment, signs off Shradha.

 Everything, of course, comes for 

 a price. Tags here read Rs 6,500-plus.

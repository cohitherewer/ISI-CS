 Wanted: Traffic wardens. Minimum qualification: Graduate. Age limit: 40 years. Requirement: Good physique. A passion to serve people without expecting any returns.

 Calcutta Police is plotting a recruitment drive ? for its voluntary wing, Calcutta Police Traffic Wardens. The current strength of the wing, comprising professionals ranging from physicians to lawyers, professors to managing directors, stands at 167, including seven women. All driven by the desire to be in uniform and a passion to serve the city.

 ?Since its inception in 1971, the organisation has engaged people in community service. Every day, they help us in traffic management at several crossings,? said traffic sergeant Naushad Ali, in charge of Traffic Wardens.

 The volunteers work three hours a week, guiding, disciplining drivers and helping the handicapped. They work round the clock during crunch times like Durga puja. ?We recruit people from all walks of life as traffic wardens, on the basis of their qualification and reputation. They are not paid any remuneration for their service and they even pay for the uniform,? said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 Take 63-year-old Sujit Kumar Roy Burman, manning busy crossroads for over three decades and wearing the stripe-code on his uniformed shoulders with pride. 

 Having joined in 1979, the managing director of a private firm is now deputy chief traffic warden. ?We get training at Police Training School every week and are part of the force... All for the love of khaki,? smiles Burman.

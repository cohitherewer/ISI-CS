 On Wednesday afternoon the employees of Last Peak Solutions, a BPO in SDF Building of Sector V, did not try to take a power nap before returning to their position in front of the computer. Instead, they made a beeline to attend the GoodLife Talk Show at their fourth-floor office.

 The topic was too close to their heart to keep them back in the cafeteria How To Control Your Boss amp; Rule Your Subordinates?

 The topic of discussion is so inviting. We all want to control our bosses and rule our subordinates, smiled a young employee. 

 exi hours, a tyrant team leader, placating the boss everything was discussed in the 90-minute show compered by Rita Bhimani. If you are working in a structured organisation you have to be very tactful to make your way up. But at the same time one has to be careful so as not to offend anybody. If you are a boss you have to be blind at times and if you are a subordinate you have to be deaf. This would be the crux of the talk show today, said Dr Malabika Desai, a psychologist and the main speaker at the show. 

 While some thought team leaders should be more accommodating, the others complained of girls being let off easily if they committed a mistake. When one is doing the same work, putting in the same hours, why should there be a gender bias? Sometimes bosses are soft towards female employees, alleged one participant. Hanging out with colleagues emerged as the best mantra to increase inter-office camaraderie.

 Though the entire programme 

 was targeted towards the employees, it has helped me as 

 a manager and a leader to a great extent. During the interaction 

 among my employees I could figure out the strengths and 

 weaknesses of some people. I will sit down and have a one-on-one 

 with them, said Chandrani Banerjee, human resource 

 manager.

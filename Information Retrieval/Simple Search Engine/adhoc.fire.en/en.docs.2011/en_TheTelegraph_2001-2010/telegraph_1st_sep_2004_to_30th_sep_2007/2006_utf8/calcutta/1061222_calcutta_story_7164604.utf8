 Notes of nostalgia

 Music Zone 

 Guitarist-keyboardist-composer Arthur Gracias (in picture), who was at the forefront of the swinging Sixties jazz scene on Park Street, and has made music with the likes of Steve Lacy and Herbie Hancock, now lives in Perth, playing his distinctive strains of Indo-jazz on his 18-string twin-axe Archtop. Back in his beloved hometown for Christmas, he talks to GoodLife about things past and present.

 Did you always want to take up music as a career?

 I was born into a musical family and there were critical early influences that shaped my life and career. My father, Alfred Gracias, was a very good jazz pianist, while my uncle George was also an excellent musician and later became my mentor.

 You were among the first few musicians who made Park Street the capital corridor of entertainment. What was your first stop?

 I started playing in Jimmy Ravestees band at Magnolias during the early Sixties as a 17-year-old.

 What memories do you have of Park Street then?

 At that time, there was no Park Hotel, but there were jazz bands everywhere, and each night was a swinging night. There was Sunny Lobo at The Grand, which had three bands, Rocky Fern at Trincas, Joe Perreira at Blue Fox, and Benny Rozario at El Morocco on Middleton Row. Spencers, Firpos, Neeras, Moulin Rouge, all had jazz bands, as did Great Eastern, where Johnny Vaz was the frontman.

 What was the music like?

 It was of a singularly high standard, with Beethoven, Bach and Tchaikovsky during lunchtime and straight-ahead, mainstream jazz in the evenings. All the musicians playing on the Park Street circuit had to be technically solid to swing between western classical and jazz. The discipline was rigid and you couldnt afford to make mistakes.

 Do you feel this high-calibre jazz movement on Park Street got the international recognition it deserved?

 Actually no, and thats the saddest part, since the music was magical and made Park Street a very special place. Even in Australia, when people ask me how come you are from Calcutta and playing jazz, I tell them Bengal was once the second New Orleans. And I mean it. You must remember Calcutta was the headquarters of the Allied forces in the 40s and there was an American jazz pianist, Teddy Weatherford, performing at Grands Winter Garden nightclub, which later became Scherazade. He died of cholera in the late 40s, but was the mascot of the movement then. Besides, there were jazz musicians from Australia and the UK active in Calcutta then.

 When and how did you embrace your chosen sound of Indo-jazz fusion?

 I started playing with Indian classical musicians in 1972, among them Ninny-da, the son of poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and a great steel-guitar player. My first Indo-jazz fusion concert was in Kala Mandir in 1976 with Shyamal Chatterjee on sitar, Dulal Lahiri on violin, Ashish Chakraborty on tabla and Eric Cabral on drums. This was the turning point and there was no looking back. Then I founded Kalki in 1983, the countrys first Indo-jazz fusion group, with Subhas Dutt (tabla), Ajoy Bardhan (flute), Nicky Coelho (tenor sax) and S. Sekhar (mridangam).

 Having introduced Indo-jazz fusion, how would you define the genre?

 Indo-jazz is the synthesis of Indian classical ragas with its inherent contemporary jazz harmonics in symmetrical and asymmetrical rhythmic structures a sound of great structural beauty.

 In which direction did your music progress after you shifted base to Australia in 2001?

 I have concentrated on Indo-jazz fusion and my latest album Night Raga, about spreading the message of peace, love and joy, has been very well accepted internationally, leading to invites to perform in Chicago, Toronto and Missouri next year. I have also done the score for the Goutam Ghose films Patang, Gudia and Beyond the Himalayas. I composed the UN theme song against racial discrimination, Brotherhood.

 What do you miss on todays Park Street and whats your message to budding musicians?

 Theres very little live music on Park Street now, despite The Parks efforts, and that buzz just isnt there anymore. As for any message, we should all try to slow down and contemplate and also lay store by our own classical music, which is a product of 5,000 years vintage.

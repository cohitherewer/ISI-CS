The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Screen On amp; Off

 Lure of love and lucre

 SANGEETH SIVAN wants us to laugh with 

 Apna Sapna Money Money..?. He tells Pratim D. Gupta 

 about the films three city girls, his differences with 

 Ghai and more

 Sangeeth Sivan 

 This is your first release following a hit film. Are you 

 under pressure to deliver after Kya Kool Hai Hum?

 Yes, the pressure is there. But 

 the box-office success of the film is not in our hands. 

 We have done the best we could have done. We can only hope 

 that it percolates down to the audiences. All I can say 

 is that Apna Sapna Money Money..? is a much better 

 film than Kya Kool Hai Hum.

 Dont you fear that the comedy phase at the box-office is 

 over and Apna Sapna Money Money..? comes a bit too 

 late in the day?

 I dont go according to trends 

 and cycles. Any good film should do well, be it comedy or 

 action or thriller. Whatever be a particular trend, humour 

 is something which everyone likes. Who would mind a laugh 

 or two? It has to be projected correctly.

 You did have serious differences with producer Subhash Ghai 

 during the making

 See, I am a creative person. Hes 

 also a creative person. So, creative differences are going 

 to happen anyway. But I dont think that has been detrimental 

 to the project. I have taken all his suggestions sportingly 

 and given them due weightage. If I havent liked any advice, 

 I have told him: Sir, I dont think this will work. On 

 his part, he has had no problems when his ideas have been 

 turned down.

 The ensemble cast 

 of Apna Sapna Money Money..?

 What does Subhash Ghai the producer bring on board for a 

 project?

 At the script level he gives a 

 lot of

 inputs. There again, some inputs 

 we take, some we dont. More than anything else, just having 

 him on the journey is a learning experience. We as film-makers 

 sometimes get too localised in our thought process and think 

 only about city audiences. He helped us think wide and not 

 stick to metros.

 Did he have a say in the famous Mukta Arts music?

 All my films, luckily, have had 

 very good songs. What Mr Ghai did was in addition to the 

 tunes, he gave a lot of importance to the lyrics. He believes 

 that songs should not only sound right but also be meaningful. 

 Not just that, he would come up with the basic thought and 

 even the first few lines of many a song. In the title track 

 Apna sapna money money the first couple of lines 

 are his.

 It took you two years to write a comedy like Apna Sapna 

 Money Money..? Why?

 I had to deal with a big ensemble 

 cast and had to do justice to all the characters in the 

 film. There is a basic plot all we want is money but all 

 we need is love but there are so many subplots. So it 

 wasnt easy to get the whole thing together. It is basically 

 very segmented but it couldnt look segmented.

 You are launching Shreyas Talpade in an out-and-out commercial 

 film for the first time

 Oh, he is a great actor. That 

 is the bottomline. He can pull off any character. As Iqbal 

 he couldnt speak but he does have a fabulous voice and 

 can mouth dialogues brilliantly. Hes from theatre and that 

 discipline shows.

 Riteish with Koena 

 Mitra in the film.

 Riteish and you are two-film old

 We go back a long way. Similarity 

 between two films may not be good but between an actor and 

 director, it works. And Riteish and I have grown together. 

 So, when we work, there are surprises at every turn. He 

 can come up with some amazing mannerisms and voice changes. 

 He is good.

 And how did you cast three Calcutta girls in the same film?

 I think having Koena Mitra, Celina 

 Jaitley and Riya Sen in the same film is a coincidence. 

 Five or six actresses were already signed when I came on 

 board. I had to just pick three of them. And I believe they 

 fit the bill perfectly.

 But they kept fighting during the making

 I wouldnt know that because on 

 the sets there were no such problems. Whatever differences 

 they had were at a personal level. They were strict professionals 

 on the sets on any given day. Not just the three of them, 

 all the 15 characters have been great to work with.

 Your film comes on November 10, with Don on top, 

 a week after Umrao Jaan and two weeks before Dhoom 

 2

 At the end of the day, all films 

 will run on their feet. Don and Dhoom 2 are 

 high-energy, high-octane films. My film is of a completely 

 different genre and is not competing with any of them. Even 

 the other release on November 10 is a family film like Vivah. 

 So, Apna Sapna Money Money..? should do well in the 

 two weeks leading to Dhoom 2.

 Are you making another comedy next?

 No, I am doing an emotional action 

 film with Bobby Deol and Nana Patekar. It is being produced 

 by K Sera Sera. You can say its Die Hard meets Yash 

 Chopra.

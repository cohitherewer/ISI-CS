Surf the Net, play computer games or just blog for hours hellip; But this is not just another cyber cafe. As manager Shruti Jain puts it, Klub Pezo at 4B Short Street that logged in on Saturday, ldquo;is a one-of-its-kind recreation zone where people can hang out and spend a quality time rdquo;. 

 Spread over 1,500 sq ft opposite St Xaviers College back gate, this entertainment zone boasts a gaming parlour with LAN (local area network), PC games, a snazzy karaoke audio recording studio and generous lounging space.

 The name Klub Pezo draws inspiration from the Greek word Pezo meaning to play. Explains Shruti: It could either mean playing a game, music or even a role. The word was simply tailormade for us. It fitted our activity options perfectly. 

 The interiors are all about straight lines and a right mix of colour lots of ochre, some amber and gold. Mood lighting creates an impressive ambience. Textured walls boast wall hangs in black-and-white geometric patterns. On one wall is a graffiti of Calcutta Kumartuli, trams, para cricket and all. 

 The leisure activities on offer are tech driven. To the right is the gaming parlour with 10 computers. There are games like Counter Strike, A3 India, Warcraft III, Gunz and more. You can organise your own gaming sessions with friends in the cafe or any other place in India. Gaming is priced at Rs 30 per hour and surfing at Rs 20 an hour.

 The spacious karaoke audio recording studio looks very retro with wooden flooring, large silver cushions, a diamond-shaped wall light that changes colours and a tiny glass table. The area can double as a private party venue.

 Be yourself, sing a solo, duet or simply jam in with a group, says Shruti. You have around 500 English and Hindi tracks to choose from. Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar favourites to Brian Adams and Eagles chartbusters pick what suits your mood. We will soon add 80 Bengali tracks as well, reveals Shruti. 

 You can record your own voice with background music, editing, mixing and more. Walk away with a CD that is ready in 15-20 minutes. Recording is tagged at Rs 9 per minute. A professional karaoke box featuring self-selection and over 1,500 track choices is on its way. 

 For the technologically challenged, there is an elevated cosy corner for adda and board games. Dim red lighting makes for a warm ambience. Here, seating arrangements are all about beanbags, cosy sofas and low seaters.

 A soon-to-be introduced food kiosk will take care of hungry stomachs as well.

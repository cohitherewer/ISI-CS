 Counter-suit filed in wine shop battle

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The legal battle between a group of residents and the owner of a liquor shop on Mahim Haldar Street, near the Hazra crossing, took a new turn on Tuesday. 

 The residents challenged the trial courts order, asking police to help the owner start his liquor shop on Mahim Haldar Street. They filed the suit before a division bench of Calcutta High Court. 

 On July 26, Sourav Roy, owner of the liquor shop, had moved the high court, appealing that even after the excise departments clearance, the residents of Mahim Haldar Street and the neighbouring areas were not allowing him to enter his shop. 

 The women are staging day-long dharnas in front of the shop. The court should ask police to help me run the shop, Roy told the court.

 Justice Soumitra Pal had directed the police to provide assistance to the petitioner.

 The lawyer representing the local residents said the excise department had allowed Roy to open the shop by violating the existing norms. 

 You cannot run a liquor shop within 1,000 ft of any place of worship or educational institution. The shop is within 1,000 ft of Ashutosh College, Orthodox Greek Church and the Radha Gobindo temple in Hazra, the lawyer pointed out.

 He added that the local police had fears that the law and order of neighbouring areas might get disturbed if the shop is allowed to open. 

 On the other hand, the petitioners advocate argued that despite a licence issued by the excise department, the local residents had moved a public interest litigation twice in the high court. 

 Earlier, the lawyers representing the excise department had satisfied the court that no rule was violated during issuance of the licence. The division bench was presided over by Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, who declined to intervene in the matter, Roys counsel said. 

 The local residents had also approached the principal secretary of the excise department, requesting him to cancel the shops licence, Roys counsel added.

 A survey was conducted following the request by the local residents. But it didnt find violation of any rule. After the survey report, the excise department refused to accept their request, the lawyer said.

 He alleged that Trinamul Congress activists were giving the issue a political hue.

 The case will come up for hearing in the high court within a couple of days.

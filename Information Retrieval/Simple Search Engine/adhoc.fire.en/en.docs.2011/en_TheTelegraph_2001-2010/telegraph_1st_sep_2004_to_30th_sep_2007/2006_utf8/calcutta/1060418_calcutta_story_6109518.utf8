 There has been widespread concern that the Indian educational system is too theoretical in its structure, and does not always meet the requirements of industry. The need for job-oriented training has increased to a great extent, especially in Bengal.

 To address the rising demand for trained manpower, the Indian Institute of Job-oriented Training (IIJT) has been established to provide practical training in the field of computer accounting. IIJT inaugurated its Calcutta centre, the first in the country, on Monday. Doing the honours was Rajya Sabha member and former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha.

 Sinha, who is also honorary chairman of the institute, said: ?Unemployment in India is a growing problem. However, the encouraging growth of the Indian corporate sector has also created a huge demand for trained manpower. IIJT has been founded specifically to groom the Indian youth for the vast emerging Indian as well as global job market. ?

 Once a student completes the one-year course, the institute will award him a ?Complete Business Accountant? certification.

 ?Bengal has most of the premier accounting and auditing firms that are doing good business. At the moment, the state?s IT industry has been seeing exponential growth, outstripping even the national growth index. Computer accounting is a next-generation profession that has a tremendous scope for growth,? said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, department of information technology.

 IIJT, which plans on inducting only 10 students per batch, has tied up with a number of corporate organisations, chartered accountancy firms and share brokers, among others, to provide employment opportunities to its students.

 Devesh Srivastava, CEO, IIJT, pointed out that Bengal is expected to face a shortage of more than 30,000 commerce graduates by 2009, leading to a huge demand-supply gap.

 ?Students from any educational background can join IIJT?s computer accountancy course. It will guarantee top-quality jobs to the students. They can choose from accounting to banking to capital market operations,? emphasised Srivastava.

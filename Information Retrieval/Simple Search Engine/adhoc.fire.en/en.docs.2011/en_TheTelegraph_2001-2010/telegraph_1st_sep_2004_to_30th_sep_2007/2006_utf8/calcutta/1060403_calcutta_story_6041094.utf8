 The first of the Infinitea chain of cha bars is opening at Poddar Court this Poila Baisakh. And while the name suggests that its just about tea, the breakfast, lunch and dinner options to go with the cuppa could make this a likely food haunt at an unlikely address for office-goers and families alike.

 Where: Infinitea at 18, Rabindra Sarani, Gate 2, Poddar Court.

 When: Open with limited menus for limited guests from April 3 (Monday). Formal opening from April 15. Takeaways start the same day, but free home-delivery starts only from May 1.

 The look and feel: The area in front of the lifts at Gate 2 is totally redone, from floor to ceiling. It resembles a posh hotel lounge with little lights beaming from neat panels. The wall is gone and in its place is a glass door embossed with the Infinitea logo. On either side are racks where, like teahouses abroad, loose tea will be displayed for retail sale.

 The interiors are done up in orange and yellow. Various combinations of the shades appear on the seats of wooden chairs and on the walls. This is an unusual colour combination but it reflects the energy tea gives, says managing director of Infinitea, Gaurav Saria. At the same time, we recreate the charm of the colonial era when tea plantations began in India.

 And sure enough, there are hat and umbrella stands by the door, rafters, a false balcony and quaint old-world lamps. Black and white photographs of old Calcutta and tea plantations jostle with colourful Infinitea posters on the wall.

 Music played here will always be the oldies, Elvis, Beatles etc. We want this to be a place where people can relax and de-stress, says B.K. Saria. Gauravs father is the owner of Gopaldhara tea plantations of Darjeeling, and now of Infinitea in the heart of Calcutta.

 The fare: The 5,000 sq ft, 100-seater restaurant offers infinite variety. The space closest to the entrance has small tables with clusters of four chairs under low rafters and open lights. This area is for the office lunch crowd in a rush. A showcase lined with confectioneries is a tempting centrepiece. 

 Families or groups of six can have a cosier corner to themselves, with low sofas and long glass-topped tables.

 Sip and bite: There is a swanky bar complete with bar stools and liquor cabinet, except that here one can only get addicted to 89 varieties of tea. We want to revive the tea-drinking habit. There will be bouquets and white tea, the most expensive varieties of tea, Pearl Tea, Enigma, Kashmiri Kahwa, Green Tea? everything from experimental fruity flavours to the traditional Darjeeling, say the Sarias. We wont serve milk with Darjeeling Tea because that would be a sin and we would try and persuade our clients to try out other varieties. 

 The Saria family has another mission: to bring back Continental food to the city centre. The craze for Continental food started here in Calcutta but the city has forgotten what authentic Continental tastes like. We want to change that with real imported herbs and other ingredients. We have a coal grill for the original smoked flavour, says Gaurav, a trained chef. 

 There are certain wines that go well with certain kinds of food, but the Sarias plan to offer a novel alternative ? a particular kind of tea with a particular meat.

 Pocket Pinch: Price ranges from Rs 20 to Rs 180.

 Timings: Open all days from April 15, 11 am to 11 pm. From May 1, 7 am to 11 pm.

 Plus: The second Chabar is already being planned for Sector V, Salt Lake, in May.

 Niche TV in new year

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 On this the first day of 2006, Adlib could have done one of two things: look back or look forward. The first is comfortable but a trifle boring. Unless you want to look back only to ask yourself what might change soon. Such crystal ball gazing is risky. It is like placing your bet on the roulette table, and almost as exciting. So here we go.

 The event of 2005 that I feel is likely to have a far-reaching impact on our urban consumer life happened only about 10 days back. On December 22, from a place in French Guyana, Insat-4A satellite has been launched. From all indications, outer space has accepted this new guest and the child is comfortable in its new cradle.

 To appreciate the significance we need to take a long walk back. Scene one of the drama happened some 30 years ago. I was fortunate to witness the first day of the first ever TV in a friend?s house. This was Sunday and the Wimbledon final was being telecast live by Doordarshan Calcutta, the only channel then. The picture showed a rain-soaked Centre Court. The drizzle had not stopped. I still remember the excited voice of my friend?s wife: ?Dekho dekho London-e ekhon brishti hochhe aar amra ghore boshe dekhte pachhi!? Neither has rain in London ever been unusual, nor would a live telecast from Timbuktu surprise us today. It did then. Much water has flown down the Ganges since. From the parochial days of Doordarshan Calcutta, we moved to National Network. And then the sky opened up. Only one nagging problem persists. Our television viewing remains under the control of the cable operator. He chooses what goes into prime band and what is relegated to the snowing zone.

 This is where the lift-off from French Guyana can change our lives. It carries electronic equipment that receive signals from earth, convert them to a new frequency, amplify them and resend them to earth with a never-before clarity and strength. According to the chairman of ISRO, Insat-4A ?will revolutionise? direct-to-home (DTH) broadcasting in the country.

 What else will this DTH do? Better pictures and sound, most certainly. More crucially, DTH will allow us to subscribe to the channels we want and avoid the clutter of the ones that we do not wish to see. We are told that there are a host of other privileges, like ordering a movie on DTH. In short, television will become more customised at the individual subscriber level.

 All this may change lifestyles. In the short run, the in home entertainment market may expand at the cost of out of home. Multiplexes may feel the heat. Restaurants may have more tables to offer on a Saturday evening. There is another possibility. It indeed is just a possibility at this stage. DTH will mean an initial investment and a monthly fee structure that is dependent on the channels you want to watch. There is a very good chance that the television viewing market will become segmented. The mass will possibly stay with the not-so-friendly but cheaper neighbourhood cable operator. The rich will jump on to the new bandwagon and find that there is very little to gain as their staples of K-series soap operas and hit feature films taste possibly the same.

 A niche television audience may emerge who have different tastes, different sensibilities. They may subscribe to a bouquet of channels that currently remains blurred in the snow zone. This niche will not only have an educated mind but purchasing power as well. The advertising support will thus hopefully not be missing. May be then newer TV software will be developed for this segment. Evenings can then become more entertaining by being more enriching. That is the prayer of 2006.

 Happy New Year.

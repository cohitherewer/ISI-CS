 A bid to help wronged women is what brought women?s magazine Sananda and Sahara One channel on a common platform on Sunday. It occasioned a workshop called Satirupeno, with speakers from Mumbai and Calcutta. 

 A stark piece by women from Sanlaap created a sombre prelude to an afternoon of crisis and counsel, attended by about 300 Sananda readers. The only man on the panel, script-writer Kamlesh Pandey, took the mike to explain the nomenclature of the workshop as well as that of the serial on women?s rights that inspired it. ?A word is like a coin. With usage, it gets corroded.? Sati indeed has moved far from its dictionary connotation of a follower of truth to embody a social malaise. 

 Truth reared many of its bitter faces through words that followed. Dispelling the notion that atrocities against women happen more in the lower strata, writer Shobhaa De held out hope that ?with women becoming aware of their rights, they are being able to fight back?. 

 She had a word of praise for the media?s vigilant role which was bringing to light many a case which the moneyed would be able to suppress earlier. The putting away of the employer of a 10-year-old domestic help assaulted in Mumbai for using a lipstick to the reopening of the Jessica Lal case, all paint a positive picture. ?Speak up,? she urged. 

 That is what Manasi Salvi does in her avatar as lawyer Sati Razdan in the serial. ?Through this medium, we can sensitise viewers as well as raise legal awareness,? she said. 

 What Sati does on screen, Indrani Sinha, founder of the NGO Sanlaap, has been doing for 18 years in life. Recounting how it was the appropriation of a self-help project for women collecting prawn seeds by the men of the Midnapore village that spurred her to start off, she talked of the survivors, many of whom came with depression and suicidal tendencies. ?Quite a few passed Madhyamik in the first division. Others have set up home.?

 Roshni Sen put up two contrasting pictures from her experience as the district magistrate of South 24-Parganas. In impoverished Nandanpur village, she offered women a pick of threshing machine, irrigation canals, cattle? They asked for a job as domestic help in a Salt Lake house. In Gudgud village, a self-help group now breeds livestock and adds to the family kitty. ?Alongside despair, there is hope.?

 Hope it is that many women returned with after putting up their problems to the panel. That was the magazine?s gift to its readers on the eve of turning 20 on July 31.

 ?Mother is lying critically ill and Amtul Salam takes pride disregarding such calls because she is busy, presumably under effect of your teaching, washing the nose or cleaning the ear of a healthy Harigan boy.? Thus was chided a person no less than Mahatma Gandhi by an irate brother, writing to get his sister back from Swadeshi work. 

 Gandhi Handbook, written by Manik Lal Jain along with Mrinal Kanti Ray, presents such little-known facets of the father of the nation?s life through some 2,000 pictures of the actual documents. The book is a compendium of all things to do with Gandhi ? stamps and covers, coins and tokens, letters and labels... from around the world.

 These tell stories on their own. While myriad Swadeshi postal labels, then used on envelopes, call upon people to boycott British goods, notices follow from the posts and telegraphs department prohibiting transmission of letters bearing such labels. There are pictures of vinyl records of his speeches and posters announcing the venues of his addresses.

 Jain, who received a gold medal from the President for his work on pre-postage communication in India (1775-1854), has been bringing out an annual catalogue of Indian stamps since 1964. But his philatelic venture was an accident.

 ?I started with matchbox labels at the age of eight in Bikaner. After collecting all available labels in the city, I started scavenging compartments of trains in search of matchboxes from elsewhere.? One day, he was thrashed by a policeman. Insulted, he gave up the hobby. 

 After his father?s death soon after, the family shifted to Calcutta, where he took to photography. ?A break came when Arundhati Debi took me to the shooting of her husband?s film Mamata at New Theatres. The Uttam-Suchitra starrer Sagarika was being shot on the next floor.? But film photography, too, was shortlived, as the youth was caught by an uncle in an actress?s house and thrashed for ?chasing heroines?. Then came stamps.

 Since 1964, he has been a stamp dealer, which spelt the death of Jain, the award-winning collector. ?This helped the book, though, as it made me aware of which collectors were possessing documents on Gandhi,? smiles the 68-year-old.

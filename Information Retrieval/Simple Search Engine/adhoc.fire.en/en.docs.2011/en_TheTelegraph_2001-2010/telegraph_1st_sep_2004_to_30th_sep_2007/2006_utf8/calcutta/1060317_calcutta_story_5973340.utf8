 Celebrating positive energy and universal life-force, Ananda Shankar Foundation presents two enchanting choreographic pieces that, in essence, emphasise the evolution and continuity of life. Anandadhara is a bouquet of danseuse Tanusree Shankar?s creations based on the technique of New Dance. Stylistically arranged as a trip down memory lane, the individual dances recreate the blossoming of her own talents. Inspired by and dedicated to her by the members of her troupe, it is a special offering that hopes to live up to the Foundation?s motto, ?the show must go on ...?. Music: Ananda Shankar, Taufiq Qureshi and A.R. Rahman. Choreography: Tanusree Shankar. Chirantan presents excerpts from Tagore?s literary works, reinforcing man?s belief in self, truth, love, peace and spirituality. It endeavours to portray the dawn of an era where love triumphs over hatred, spreading a message of hope, goodwill, friendship and of values that are eternal. Narration: Amitabh Bachchan. Music: Debajyoti Mishra. Choreography: Tanusree Shankar. Lead singers: Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta, Sraboni Sen, Raghab Chatterjee, Rupankar Bagchi and Ishita Ganguly.

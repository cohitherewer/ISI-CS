 What: 

 Romancing Silhouettes in association with Smart (Reliance 

 GSM Services), Seagrams Royal Stag and Open Doors.

 Where: Calcutta Rowing Club (CRC).

 When: May 7, 8 pm onwards. 

 Take a look: A packed venue saw the young and old viewing Rabindranath Tagore from a different perspective. The pleasant evening made for the perfect open-air event, but not for long. Just when the crowd was beginning to enjoy the monologues combined with Bengali melodies, the skies opened up, sending everyone scurrying for cover.

 The performance resumed at the Boat Club auditorium. The microphone and the background music might have been missing, but the performers made up for it. Conceptualised by Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, Romancing Silhouettes dramatised monologues of six women who had inspired Tagores work in some way. This included women immortalised in his songs and memoirs. Each monologue was followed by Rabindrasangeet by singer Pramita Mullick. Actress Sudipta Chakraborty, Sudipa Basu, Chaiti Ghoshal and theatre personalities Bijoylakshmi Burman and Sahana Chatterjee, along with Sujoy, read out the various texts.

 The character of Anna Tarkhar, a Marathi woman who liked Tagore without his beard, was portrayed by Sudipta. Sudipa read out how Tomi Wdakora, a Japanese woman, fell in love with Tagores religious thoughts. Sahana portrayed how Victoria Okompo fell in love with Tagore the poet.

 Sujoy read out how Lady Ranu Mukherjee, then barely a teenager, would write love letters to the 58-year-old Tagore. The part of Hemantabala, a Vaishnavite, was read out by Bijoylakshmi. Chaiti traced the transition of Kadambari Debi from being Tagores childhood playmate to being in love with him. 

 Pramita with songs like Amar praner manush achhe prane and Tabu mone rekho heightened the mood of romance.

 Spotted: Designer Shamlu Dudeja, actress Suchita Roychoudhuri and singer Indrani Mukherjee.

 Voiceover: This is a tribute to Tagores romanticism, a man whose unrequited love was manifested in his literature, said Sujoy.

 Turning three

 What: Third anniversary bash of Power 107.8 FM.

 Where: I in Hiland Park.

 When: Saturday evening.

 The party: The fun peaked around 9 pm when the celeb brigade started trooping in to join the RJs and the Power team in their celebrations. The party crowd was treated to numbers like Kajra re, Dus bahane, Bheegi bheegi and Ya ali.

 Spotted: Members of bands Chandrabindoo and Cactus, actor Arjun Chakraborty with wife Nilanjana and DJ Akash.

 and hence the party. Besides celebrities, we have also invited 

 some of our regular callers and listeners, said a 

 spokesperson for the radio station.

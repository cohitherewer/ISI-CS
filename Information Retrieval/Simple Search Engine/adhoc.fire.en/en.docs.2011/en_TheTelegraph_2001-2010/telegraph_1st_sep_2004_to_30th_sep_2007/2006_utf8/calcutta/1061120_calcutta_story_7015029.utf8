 What: Cirque Selecte, an evening for Priority Banking customers of Standard Chartered Bank.

 Where: Hyatt Regency Calcutta banquets.

 When: Thursday evening, 8 pm onwards.

 Take a look: The evening was a mix of fashion and music, with the scale tilted towards fashion. The rather long evening kicked off with a performance by singer Ritika Sahni. The Calcutta girl tried hard to set the mood with tracks like what a babe (from the film Rakht), Ja re ja, Kajra re, Kaisi paheli and More ghar aao sajna from her to-be-released album.

 Then, it was over to fashion. Designer Surily Goel of Salaam Namaste fame started the show with an eclectic collection of ethnics and westerns. Cocktail saris in whites, blues and pinks did the rounds, followed by loads of dresses bubbles, empires and more, skirts in various shapes, sexy tops, corsets, knee pants

 Asymmetrical hemlines, layering, polka dots, sequinned borders, floral prints were some of the highlights. The colours were a mix of whites, pinks, greys, red and black. Surily ended her show with a line she had showcased at the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) in Mumbai earlier this month. The dresses, skirts and tops with florals in pinks and gold had an in-your-face glamorous feel.

 Next up was designer Narendra Kumar, who showcased his acclaimed LFW womans wear collection for spring-summer 2007. Titled When Love Touches You, the collection was truly impressive. A variety of dresses, dominated by bubble hemlines, formed the mainstay of the line, with skirts and tops for company. Ruching, smocking, pleating, a touch of threadwork and abstract prints decorated the clothes. The colours were muted beige, matte gold, navy blue. 

 The look was feminine, with softened structures. The attempt was to marry construction with femininity, explained Narendra. The show was an emotional experience for the designer.

 Narendras brief showing was followed by a long three-sequence show by Van Heusen. The formal mens wear range from the garment major presented a co-ordinated look with suits, ties, trousers, shirts, blazers, as well as shoes. The shades were formal too blacks, browns, greys and neutrals.

 Next up was Van Heusen Woman a new offering that was launched nationally in September, but will hit Calcutta stores only in February.

 The spring-summer line of everyday couture for the working woman was a mix of various looks from boardroom structures to Saturday night sexy picks. Structured suits, shirts, short skirts, knee pants, summer jackets, as well as sexy empire-line tops and dresses and casual racer backs and denim lowers the range was wide.

 The palette was restricted sky, greys, browns, blues and whites. The collection was well accessorised with broad belts, bags, scarves, jewellery and brooches.

 Van Heusen Woman offers dressing solutions for all occasions in the life of todays working woman. Right from clothes for work, official cocktails and after-work parties, to informal day wear, the range is varied, said Sounak Sen Barat, the Calcutta boy who is the creative mind behind the collection.

 The men were back on the ramp with yet another new collection from Van Heusen. Titled V., the club wear line comprised peppy shirts, lounge jackets, semi-formal trousers and more.

 The evening came to a close with a bridal jewellery show by BC Sen, but the models here had to walk to empty chairs as most in the crowd had by then made a beeline for the food counters outside.

 Voiceover: Once a year we organise such an entertainment evening for our premium customers. While in the past we have hosted poetry readings and musical shows, from last year we are hosting fashion extravaganzas as fashion really sells well today, smiled Anindya Palchaudhuri, assistant vice-president of Priority Banking, Standard Chartered Bank.

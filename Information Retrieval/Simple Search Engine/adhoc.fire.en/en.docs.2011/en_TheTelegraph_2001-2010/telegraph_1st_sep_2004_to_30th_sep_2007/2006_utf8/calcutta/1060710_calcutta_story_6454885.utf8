 ?The tea industry has, indeed, been through some difficult times, but we should overcome it. We need to take a few firm decisions, modernise, accept competition and move forward,? said Basudeb Banerjee (IAS), chairman of the Tea Board of India at the launch of a ?tea-table? book at the Oxford bookstore on July 8.

 And his words were reflected in the book Tea ? Legend, Life and Livelihood of India, where writer Gautam Prasad Baroowah promises that ?India is about to establish a new brand image of tea and out of the present flux there will emerge a new identity?.

 Pradyut Bordolay, Assam?s minister for industries and power, also assured that ?the bad days for Assam tea are behind us and things have turned around?. Optimism was running high in the tea garden folk in the audience.

 The well-researched text, priced at Rs 2,000, was complimented by lavish photographs by Dushyant Parashar. A spokesperson for the publisher, Red River India, said the aim is to make this ?ultimate tea archive? accessible to tea-lovers across the world. The international launch is slated for August 29 in New York and attempts are being made to showcase the book at upcoming fairs in the UK and other places.

 Excerpts read by Nazib Arif, secretary-general of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industries, showed the book as a delightful mix of fact and fiction. Instead of beginning with prosaic data, Baroowah uses two characters (modelled on real-life ones) Ali W. Zaman and Andrew Gillis Bowles, with whom he builds a thin narrative.

 This allows him not only to string the central informative chapters together but also makes for the inclusion of many special insights and asides on the unique lifestyle that has grown around the plantations. 

 An award-winning poet, Baroowah acknowledges his debt to researchers like Arup Dutta, R.H. Jhawar and others. He himself has a long experience as human resources manager in a tea garden. ?That was the time when terrorism flourished in the gardens and being between the workers and the management taught me many things,? he told Metro.

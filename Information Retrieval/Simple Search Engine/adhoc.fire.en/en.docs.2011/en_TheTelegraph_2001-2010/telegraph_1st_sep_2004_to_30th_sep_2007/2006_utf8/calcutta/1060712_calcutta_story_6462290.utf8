 If Shakespeare did not write in 

 English, there would still be a lot of Shakespeare left. 

 So, there are Korean Shakespeares, Japanese Shakespeares, 

 there is ?Shakespeare as Transnational Discourse on the 

 German Stage?, there has been an ?appropriation of Shakespeare 

 in Romania?, Shakespeare has been sighted against the backdrop 

 of the rise of English in post-Francoist Spain, and there 

 are several Indian Shakespeares ? and all of them are doing 

 well. 

 ?Because something comes before 

 the composition in language,? said Sukanta Chaudhuri, professor 

 of English at Jadavpur University, who has edited a collection 

 of essays called Shakespeare without English. Published 

 by Pearson Education and co-edited by Chee Seng Lim, professor 

 of English at the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, the 

 volume was launched at the British Council on Monday evening. 

 Chaudhuri thanked the council 

 for launching a book about the absence of English ? and 

 provided insight into why Shakespeare works all over the 

 world, in very different languages and alien contexts. His 

 plots have a life of their own, he suggested. Though a ?notorious 

 borrower?, Chaudhuri said, Shakespeare extracted from his 

 sources the essential components of a pattern of action 

 that was simple, but suggestive and symbolic, with the potential 

 to explore the human state. In Shakespeare, he said, the 

 ?theatrical design? can almost be separated from the ?verbal 

 design?, trying hard to remember a very good performance 

 of Shakespeare that adhered closely to the text.

 Chaudhuri spoke about a number 

 of recent successful ?non-English? Shakespeares. He referred 

 to Tim Supple?s production of A Midsummer Night?s Dream 

 in seven languages. He also praised Vishal Bharadwaj?s film 

 Maqbool, based on Macbeth. He was in conversation 

 with theatre director Suman Mukhopadhyay, who spoke about 

 Shakespeare in many countries. Mukhopadhyay said that after 

 World War II, a performance of King Lear got a stupendous 

 response in war-ravaged Warsaw, but the same play opened 

 in Philadelphia at the same time to a lukewarm audience. 

 Chaudhuri pointed out one problem 

 of the Bard travelling to other climes: the excessive analysis 

 of Shakespeare in regional and ethnic terms. ?It is as if 

 we cannot respond to Shakespeare except as an Indian.? 

 That responding as an Indian is 

 sometimes fraught with danger was also evident when, before 

 the launch, a group called ?You and I? tried to connect 

 Rabindranath with Shakespeare. It attempted, among other 

 things, to juxtapose the sonnet ?Let me not to the marriage 

 of true minds/ Admit impediments? with the Tagore song ?Bhalobashi, 

 bhalobashi?. It was unfortunate.

 Australia calling mining engineers

 POULOMI BANERJEE

 A delegation of Australian professors is in the city to open more avenues in the field of mining engineering and draw students from the Indian subcontinent.

 The delegation elaborated on the new scopes of mining in view of the fast depletion of non-renewable sources of energy and growing demand for renewable energy.

 We have abundant unexplored resources under the Earths surface. So, mining must continue. In the coming years, we might explore new territories like the sea or ocean beds for minerals, explained Chris Daly, deputy president, University of New South Wales Academic Board, School of Mining Engineering.

 In the city for the International Mining and Machinery Exhibition, in which Australia is a partner, the delegation is interacting with the premier institutions in the state. 

 Both India and Australia have a bright opportunity for developing the mining industry. We will be meeting representatives of Indian School of Mining, Bengal Engineering and Science University and IIT, Kharagpur. Universities in both the countries can work together to develop the industry, explained Daly. 

 The delegation is on the lookout for students who are interested in pursuing a course in mining engineering in Australia and also in staff-exchange and joint research programmes with universities here.

 Sushil Bhandari, adjunct professor, University of Ballarat, said: With the government privatising the mines, there is an increased demand for mining engineers. As most of the universities in Europe and the US have closed down, India stands to gain much from collaborations with Australia.

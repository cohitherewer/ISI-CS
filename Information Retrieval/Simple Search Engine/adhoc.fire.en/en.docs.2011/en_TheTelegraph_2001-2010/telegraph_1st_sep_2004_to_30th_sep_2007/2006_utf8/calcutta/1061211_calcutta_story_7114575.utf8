The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Despatches from the trafficked

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It looks like yet another newsletter, till the stories are looked into. 

 It was the first time I travelled by Rajdhani. On the train, we received good food all the time, so I ate a lot, says Kumkum Chettry, a girl from Calcutta who was going to the Capital to tell her story at Parliament. When I started speaking, I was brought back to the time of my life when I was first forced into prostitution. Remembering this, I began to cry and my tears told my story. 

 I am from the Nutt community and live in the red-light area here in Forbesgunge (in Bihar), says Mohammad Amin, 15. We feel captive, with nowhere to go, and nothing to do, no way to escape but to continue pimping. Some times, the pain becomes so unbearable that we start blaming our parents for bringing us into this world. We feel ashamed of ourselves, as we know that cant save our mothers and sisters.

 Kumkums and Mohammads stories appear in the second issue of Red Light Despatch, a monthly newsletter being brought out by Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an NGO working with trafficked women and children. This is the first time the country has a newsletter written by women and girls trafficked for prostitution, for people living in red-light areas and slums, says Ruchira Gupta, executive director, Apne Aap.

 They tell their stories starkly, in the first person. It also reverses the process of reporting from the outside to report on the lives of the trafficked from the inside, says Gupta. 

 The first issue of the newsletter came out in October. The third, which reports on Apne Aap children and activists at Indian Social Forum in New Delhi, has just come out. 

 NGO newsletters often come to a dead end. They remain a discourse within the NGO circuit, hardly reaching out to the people they are about. Red Light Despatch, says Gupta, is translated into Hindi and Bengali, to ensure that it is read in the community of its contributors. Its often read out. Thats why the Hindi and Bengali translations.

 Apathy toll on book bastions

 In Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees bastion of culture, two state-sponsored libraries have remained for decades studies in administrative apathy. It makes little difference to the government that it has designated both as town libraries.

 Twenty-five-year-old Juba Sangha Pathagar, in Sreecolony, and 54-year-old Vivekananda Pathagar, in Shaktigarh, started out as primary unit libraries before being upgraded in 1987.

 While Vivekananda Pathagar has a librarian and a junior library attendant, Juba Sangha functions without a librarian, daftari-cum-bookbinder or a night guard despite repeated appeals over the past 19 years.

 Ironically, Juba Sangha had a librarian before its upgrade. It is almost impossible to run a library with just two staff members. All our requests seem to have fallen on deaf ears, complains junior library attendant Narayan Chandra Dhar.

 After remaining a one-room library for more than two decades, Juba Sangha recently added another room with a grant of Rs 1 lakh from the local MP and donations from clubs. The library is still too small to house its nearly 9,000 novels and textbooks, in addition to journals and periodicals. Bricks serve as stairs to the new section.

 An annual grant of Rs 25,500 does not provide for much more in the library, with about 1,300 registered members. The grant is usually spent on contingency, book purchase and binding. It is hard for us to improve our collection since we cannot afford expensive books, says assistant librarian Asit Baran Sarkar.

 Juba Sangha has a well-stocked childrens section, but there is not much reference material for research. A text book section was started in 2003. A Rs 10,000 grant the following year helped the library to expand the section. The library is a sister concern of Juba Sangha Club. A committee of club members administrates the library and raises funds for its upkeep.

 The damp walls of the single-room Vivekananda Pathagar do not accommodate more than four readers at a time. It, too, lacks reference material and stocks only two newspapers and very few books in English.

 In 2005-2006, we spent about Rs 80,000. The government provided about Rs 33,000. The rest of the money was raised through fines, subscriptions and donations, states Chitra Nag of Vivekananda Pathagar. The library, on an average, spends nearly Rs 60,000 annually on books, electricity, furniture and stationery.

 The floor above the library is used for seminars and discussions. It remains unused at other times. We want to extend our library to the second floor, but lack the infrastructure. The shortage of space makes it difficult to display many of the books, but our hands are tied, adds Nag.

 Like Juba Sangha Pathagar, Vivekananda Pathagar is linked with a club, which is located on the ground-floor of the building. An executive committee looks after the functioning of both.

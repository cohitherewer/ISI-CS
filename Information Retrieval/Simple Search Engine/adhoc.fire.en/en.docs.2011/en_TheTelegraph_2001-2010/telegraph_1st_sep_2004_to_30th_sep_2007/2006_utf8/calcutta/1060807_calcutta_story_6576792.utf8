 Ratna Sur, Trinamul Congress councillor 

 from Ward 115 and chairperson of borough 13 of Calcutta 

 Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telepgraph. Participants 

 included Bulu Roy Chowdhury, Payel Mullick, Anjan Chakraborty, 

 Sudip Polley, Subrata Guha Roy, Biswanath Ganguly, Prasanta 

 Nandi

 Bulu Roy Chowdhury: Malaria and dengue have wreaked 

 havoc on the residents of Ward 118. The drains are not cleared 

 properly. Contractors engaged by Asian Development Bank (ADB) 

 are closing the existing drains. Besides, they are charging 

 Rs 500 for connecting our sewer lines with the main line. 

 Why are they taking the money? 

 I am aware of the malaria and 

 dengue-related problems. A six-year-old girl and a railway 

 employee died of malaria in Ward 119. I have visited the 

 area along with some civic officials. 

 Bleaching powder was sprayed and 

 other necessary steps were taken. Special steps were taken 

 in Buroshibtala, SN Roy Road, Sahapur and adjacent areas. 

 The situation is under control now. Actually, these precautionary 

 steps should be taken round the year to avoid any outbreak 

 of dengue or malaria. 

 Regarding the drainage problem, 

 to redress your grievances, we will soon open an office 

 in our borough. Here, you can lodge your complaints. The 

 payment of Rs 500 is very important, because without the 

 money, the work will have no significance. You should deposit 

 the money with the borough engineers. I have asked the mayor 

 to award some concessions. 

 Payel Mallick: The residents of 66 Pally are not getting 

 potable drinking water supply. Will you kindly look into the 

 matter? 

 If you can give me the details 

 , I can ask an engineer to visit the place. Maybe the water 

 shortage is due to ongoing ADB works. I will look into the 

 matter.

 Anjan Chakraborty: There was a vat at Ram Babur Math, 

 where residents of Ward 118 deposited their garbage. Recently, 

 a promoter has covered the area and we are dumping the garbage 

 in Ward 120. But the garbage is not collected properly. 

 I am not aware who is the owner 

 of Ram Babur Math. The vat was constructed there unofficially. 

 Now, if the promoter gives us some space there, it is fine. 

 Otherwise, we will have to look for an alternative site 

 to dump garbage. 

 Sudip Polley: Residents of Santosh Roy Road in Ward 

 123 are facing a waterlogging problem. Only a partial amount 

 of work was carried out under Ganga Action Plan from James 

 Long Sarani to Diamond Harbour Road. Besides, there are no 

 street lights on this stretch and as a result, the area is 

 quite accident-prone. 

 Earlier, areas like Santosh Roy 

 Road were marked as non-priority zones. There is no drainage 

 network here. Besides, the irrigation canals are not regularly 

 cleaned. All this has added to the woes of the residents. 

 I will look into the matter. 

 Second, I have spoken to the CESC 

 officials but due to some technical problems in the area, 

 four lamp posts could not been shifted. I hope the problem 

 will be sorted out after drainage work is completed. 

 Subrata Guha Roy: Money from the MPs and MLAs local 

 area development funds are used to purchase ambulances. But 

 once they become inoperative, no steps are taken to repair 

 them. Are you doing something about it? 

 Plans are afoot to repair the 

 ambulances and deploy them again. We will engage civic officials 

 as well as local clubs for this purpose.

 Biswanath Ganguly: After every shower, areas like Sodepur 

 go under water. The former mayor assured us that things will 

 improve. But sadly, nothing has been done. 

 Actually, to improve the situation, 

 the canals like Charial, Moni and Begor should be de-silted. 

 There are a lot of problems here. When work was started 

 using ADB funds, there was a plan to clean the canals. 

 But many people are settled on 

 both sides of the canal. Before cleaning the canal, they 

 have to be rehabilitated. The mayor has visited all these 

 sites. We have got some funds and a 32-member committee 

 has been formed to oversee the entire problem. 

 Prasanta Nandi: A 52-cottah plot is lying vacant at 

 Taramonighat Road. Is it possible to construct a park? 

 Usually the civic body allots 

 funds to the boroughs to beautify parks, which is used for 

 lighting and seating arrangements. In my area, there are 

 10 parks and I have to distribute the money equally. However, 

 the mayoral council member in charge of parks has informed 

 me about constructing a model park. Let me see what can 

 be done.

 Booster stations for drinking water

Anjan Chakraborty: Supply 

 of drinking water has been a chronic problem in the areas 

 like Agarwal Garden Road and Dhangar Para. The residents 

 of this area dont even get water from the Garden Reach 

 Waterworks. Will you please look into the matter? 

 I know that many people are facing 

 an acute shortage of water in these areas.The water supply 

 is really poor. For collecting water, people have to even 

 dig up three-ft-deep pits. I have informed the mayoral council 

 member in charge of water supply. Plans are afoot to set 

 up two booster pumping stations. One will be at Siriti and 

 the other one at Daspara.

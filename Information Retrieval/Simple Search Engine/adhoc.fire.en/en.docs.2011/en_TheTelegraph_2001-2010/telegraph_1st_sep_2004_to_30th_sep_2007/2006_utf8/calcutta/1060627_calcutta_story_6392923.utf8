 Russia beckons medicos

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 Many prospective medical students look abroad for training. Most, however, restrict their choice to the US and the UK. 

 International Foundation for Studies and Culture (IFSC), an organisation formed by Russian universities to promote their education, is hoping to broaden their perspective. 

 In association with the cultural department of the Russian embassy at Gorky Sadan, IFSC recently showcased the opportunities on offer for the Indian student.

 Since the turn of the 20th Century, Russia has produced top-notch specialists in many medical disciplines, a number of whom have won the Nobel prize. One such winner was IP Pavlov, after whom Ryazan State IP Pavlov Medical University is named. It was one of six universities that IFSC promoted at the seminar on June 23.

 Aliaskhab Nutsalov and Vorontsova Evgenia of the international students? department of the university highlighted the plus points for students from this part of the world. 

 ?There is a wide range of opportunity for foreign students who can be taught in English or French, with the most advanced medical equipment at their disposal. In addition, we make sure that the process of getting students the appropriate visas is as smooth as possible,? said Nutsalov.

 ?While domestic and foreign courses can be prohibitively expensive for many Indian families, Russian institutions offer quality education at affordable prices,? he added. The first year of the six-year bachelor?s degree in medicine costs around $3,905, significantly less than similar courses in other parts of the world.

 Among the other campuses in the drive were Saint Petersburg State Paediatric Medical Academy and Saratov State Medical University.

 Prod over housing estates

 - Minister pulls up CMDA for two incomplete projects

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authoritys (CMDA) failure to complete two housing estates has irked the urban development department minister and agency chairman Asok Bhattacharya. 

 The estates are Ashabari Housing Project and Baishnabghata Patuli Housing Project, on EM Bypass. The minister recently convened a meeting with CMDA officials. After an elaborate discussion, it was decided that the department would take legal steps against the private agency entrusted with executing the Baishnabghata Patuli project.

 The chief engineer, area development, said at the meeting that construction of 152 flats at Ashabari Housing Project was almost complete, but in the absence of permission from the pollution control board (PCB), the directorate of electricity had not allowed operation of lifts. Bhattacharya advised the officials to approach the PCB for the clearance.

 Chief executive officer of the CMDA P.R. Baviskar said the agency has moved the PCB for permission. We hope to get it by November. Once we have the permission, there will be no problems in handing over the flats to the allottees, he added.

 A PCB official asserted that it is mandatory for developers of commercial complexes and multi-storeyed buildings to obtain permission from the board to procure electricity connection. Every developer should obtain permission from the PCB before starting construction.

 Work on the Baishnabghata project, a 10-storeyed building, is far from over. The minister was told at the meeting that despite several rounds of discussions with the agency officials, the work has not progressed satisfactorily. 

 Baviskar said: We have decided to take legal action against the agency for failing to abide by the terms of the contract. If necessary, we will confiscate its security deposit. We will engage a new agency by this month to finish work, said Baviskar.

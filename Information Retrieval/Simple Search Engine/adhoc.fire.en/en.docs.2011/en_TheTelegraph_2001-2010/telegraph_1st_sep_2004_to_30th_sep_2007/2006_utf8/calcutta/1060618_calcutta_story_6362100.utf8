Travelling right to beat the fright

PET PASSION / NILANJANAA

I often get emails from pet owners who are moving 

abroad and are traumatised at the prospect of leaving their beloved pets behind. 

Well, you can take your pet along, provided you follow the pet regulations of 

the country you are travelling to.When you are planning to travel abroad with 

your dog, one of the first things to know is that your dog can travel with you 

in the cabin only if he and his crate together weigh less than 8 kg. All dogs 

weighing more than that have to travel in a crate in the hold as cargo. 

Air travel is of utmost concern to pet owners but 

you can minimise the stress by planning months in advance. Seek the advice of 

your pet?s vet long before you travel. Update vaccinations and take all necessary 

health papers along.You also have to get an exit permit for your dog for which 

you have to take him, along with his medical reports, to the government veterinarian.

A month before you leave, get the crate your pet is 

going to travel in ready. Put your pet?s toys in it, let him become familiar with 

it. This will minimise his stress during travel.

The crate should be large enough for the animal to 

sit, stand and lie down comfortably in. It must be well-ventilated from all four 

sides. It should have attached food and water bowls conveniently located for re-filling 

by the airline staff. The bottom must be fitted with an absorbent, leak-proof 

material.

Do not lock the carrier so that it is easy to let 

the pet out in case of an emergency. Put an identification tag that includes your 

name along with your pet?s name, phone numbers and destination address around 

his neck. Print the same on the crate. Never muzzle your pet during travel; it 

could be fatal.

Contact the airline well in advance for specific regulations 

and to secure your pet?s reservation, as most airlines accept a maximum of two/three 

dogs in the hold.

Take direct flights and try as much as possible to 

avoid connections and layovers. During warm-weather periods, choose early morning 

or late evening flights. In colder months, choose mid-day flights.

The cost of travelling with your dog depends on the 

destination country. For example, if you are travelling to the US or Canada, costs 

depend on the size of the crate, while the UK and other European countries go 

by the weight of the crate.

On the day of travel, feed him a light meal two/three 

hours before you travel (check this with your vet). Take him for a good, long 

walk so that it tires him out and he sleeps well on the flight. Do not sedate 

your pet without asking your vet. At the airport, you have to check him in along 

with the baggage. Before you go reassure him that all is fine and you will be 

seeing him soon. When you board the plane, notify at least one flight attendant 

that your pet is travelling in the cargo hold.

Quarantine procedure

USA: There is no quarantine period for dogs travelling 

to the US and you can walk right in with your dog, provided you have all vaccination 

papers and the exit permit. Several US airlines have imposed embargoes on shipping 

pets between May and September, the hottest months in the northern hemisphere.

UK: There is a minimum of six months quarantine. You 

can choose what facility you want to place your dog at. Information is available 

at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/ quarantine/pets/regulation/eu_reg.htm 

Australia: Dogs and cats can be directly imported 

into Australia from countries approved by the government. Import from non-approved 

countries can only occur indirectly, via a country approved by the Australian 

Quarantine and Inspection Service. Cats and dogs must be continuously resident 

in an approved country for six months prior to entering Australia.

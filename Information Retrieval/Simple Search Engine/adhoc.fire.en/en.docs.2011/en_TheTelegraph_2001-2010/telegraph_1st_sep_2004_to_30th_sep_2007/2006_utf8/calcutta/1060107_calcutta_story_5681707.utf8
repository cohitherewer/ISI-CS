 After bringing broadband Internet to the city, Calcutta Telephones will log on to the wireless future in February.

 Announcing this on Thursday, chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones Samar Kumar Chakraborty said: ?Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) is now a mature technology and every building, if desired, can be converted into a hotspot.?

 A zone with Wi-Fi Internet access is known as hotspot in information technology parlance. 

 Calcutta Telephones has already distributed about 5,000 Wi-Fi kits free among big customers. With the price of laptops plummeting, the company hopes the offer will convince owners of coffee shops, conference halls and hotels to turn their properties into hotspots.

 The time spent online determines the usage charges for dial-up Internet. The Wi-Fi usage cost would be proportional to the volume of data exchanged. The rate has been fixed at Rs 1.40 per MB at public hotspots. The charge would be added to the regular phone bill of the customer. 

 The prices of laptops have dropped drastically over the past couple of years. A model that cost Rs 1 lakh two years ago is now available for Rs 35,000. More laptops mean more demand for Wi-Fi service in halls, hotels, campuses, courts and even hospitals, reasoned Chakraborty.

 Before the official launch, Calcutta Telephones has decided to make the facility available in the high court and Bijon Bhavan in Salt Lake. ?We have received a request from the high court in this respect,? stated Chakraborty.

 General manager (sales amp; shares) Salil Kumar Bhaduri disclosed that a year-long trial run was conducted at Jadavpur University and Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, before the launch.

 ?The cost of making a large hall Wi-Fi will be about Rs 4 lakh. If there is a prospect of big business in the future, we are ready to bear the expenditure,? said Chakraborty.

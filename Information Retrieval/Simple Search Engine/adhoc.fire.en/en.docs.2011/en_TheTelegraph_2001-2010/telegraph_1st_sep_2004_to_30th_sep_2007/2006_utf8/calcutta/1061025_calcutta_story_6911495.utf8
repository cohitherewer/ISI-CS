 Rush job on rogue cop

 People pressure forced the arrest of a policeman early on Tuesday in Behala, but the hush-hush manner in which he was picked up, produced in court and then granted bail has irked the irate residents.

 Inspector P.K. Banerjee, of Bamacharan Roy Road, stood accused of hurling a bucket and brickbats at neighbours late on Sunday while they were watching a fireworks display at the edge of a pond adjoining his house. Banerjee claimed they were bursting banned crackers.

 When local police did not take action against Banerjee, residents lay siege to his residence through Monday, demanding his arrest. Around 2.30 am on Tuesday, local CPM legislator Kum Kum Chakraborty urged them to return home, as police were keeping an eye on Banerjees residence. So, the crowd dispersed.

 Around 3 am, neighbour Rajendra Kumar Jha spied someone slipping out of the rear gate. I raised an alarm and we ran after him, but he melted into the darkness, said Jha, alleging police complicity. 

 Later in the day, police added a twist to the tale, claiming Banerjee was picked up from his residence. We arrested him early on Tuesday from home. He was produced in court and granted bail, said D.P. Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial).

 They are making up stories to save the rogue cop, cried residents.

 MLA Chakraborty said Banerjee should have been arrested in the presence of the neighbours, but hoped that proper action would still be taken against him.

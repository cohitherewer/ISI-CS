The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tragedy and 

 toothpaste

 BLOG LOG

 The stingray barb through the 

 heart of Steve Irwin almost shut down some online 

 news portals due to traffic overload. The blog world could 

 hardly remain untouched. But like fellow-Australian and 

 feminist academic Germaine Greer, not everyone on the Net 

 was sympathetic towards the crocodile man.

 Heres Philip Klein (http://www.amspec.org) 

 with his take on the death. Obviously, its a tragedy when 

 anybody dies, but in my view Irwin was being very selfish 

 and irresponsible as a husband and father by doing what 

 he was doing. Its one thing to play around with deadly 

 animals when youre a young, single guy, but if you love 

 doing something dangerous, you simply should not have a 

 family... If having a family means a lot to you, then give 

 up hunting crocodiles.

 The fans far outnumber the critics, 

 though. One of the most poignant posts on PostSecret (http://postsecret.blogspot.com), 

 a community art project where people mail in their secrets 

 anonymously, is a postcard of Irwin smiling with I cried 

 more when he died than my own fathers death scribbled 

 on it.

 Talking of postcards, the 9/11 

 anniversary was, of course, big on the blog. A postcard 

 at PostSecret of the Manhattan skyline at night with beams 

 of light where the WTC stood has two confessions rising 

 from the city lights. One says: I cry all the time. The 

 other: I am still afraid. 

 The nameless artist is not the 

 only one grappling with a world changed forever by airborne 

 terror. Neil Gaiman (http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal), 

 the author of the cult comics series Sandman, describes 

 in his online journal, under the title Terrorism and my 

 toothpaste, the experience of reading a list of items he 

 was prohibited from carrying on a flight. He rushes through 

 toothpaste, hairgel, topical or rash creams, lip gels, 

 shampoos and conditioners to pause at personal lubricants, 

 which could be carried on board. I blink. I find Im suddenly 

 unsure whether or not that means exactly what Im certain 

 it does mean, so I google personal lubricants and yes, 

 its talking about exactly what I think its talking about. 

 Upto 4 oz of personal lubricants are just fine... practically 

 the only liquid you can take with you onto a plane. Um... 

 I think I must be losing it. For a moment there, I really 

 planned to drive up to a drug store, buy a 4 oz container 

 of personal lubricant, empty it out, wash it and refill 

 it with toothpaste.

 And to end on a thoughtful note, 

 particularly fitting for a blog column as thats the place 

 thinking people meet now, heres Lore Sjberg (http://www.wired.com/news/columns) 

 writing on the act of blogging itself: Creating your own 

 blog is about as easy as creating your own urine, and youre 

 about as likely to find someone else interested in it. One 

 popular technique for building readership is to send e-mail 

 to more well-trafficked blogs offering to exchange links 

 with them. One popular response from those blogs is to laugh 

 derisively and hit the Delete button.

 A developer is allegedly filling up one-and-a-half bighas of a pond in Mahestala, on the southern fringes of the city, flouting rules and ignoring protests by local residents. 

 Developer Ram Chandra Dhalis defence of the landfill: I am just raising the level of the plot, which I intend to sell I am not doing anything wrong.

 Residents of the Shampa Mirza Nagar Cooperative Housing Estate, near which the waterbody is located, lodged a complaint with the pollution control board (PCB) and also brought the matter to the notice of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 PCB senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee said as per procedure, the complaint had been forwarded to the local police and the civic body. We will act after receiving the reports.

 Mahestala municipality chairman Kali Bhandari (CPM) said stringent action would be taken against the developer if the landfill allegation was true. I shall talk to Dhali and ascertain what exactly he is doing. Anyone can sell a non-agricultural plot, but only after obtaining a sanction from the civic body.

 Residents of the Shampa Mirza Nagar estate, where 111 families have been living since 1995, blamed the landfill for the waterlogging in the area and also the spread of various water-borne diseases.

 On Dhalis contention that he is raising the level of a plot, thereby denying the waterbodys existence, the residents said they have been using the pond for more than a decade to bathe and catch fish.

 The area turned into hell after the recent rains, said Sekhar Dey, secretary of the housing society. Thanks to the landfill, the run-off water did not have an exit route and flooded the locality. 

 According to the residents, the pond measures about two-and-a-half bighas. Dhali owns one-and-a-half bighas and the rest belongs to the housing department. But the government has done nothing to save the pond, said a resident.

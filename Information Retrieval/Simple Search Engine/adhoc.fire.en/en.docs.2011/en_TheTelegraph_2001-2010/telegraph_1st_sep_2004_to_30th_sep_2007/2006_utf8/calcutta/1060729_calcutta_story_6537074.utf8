 Set in post World War II Chicago, A Raisin in the Sun, written by Lorraine Hansberry, is one of the great classics of 20th century American theatre. Presenting the reality of south-side Chicago for the first time on the Calcutta stage, it is an electrifying drama, narrating the universal story of a family?s struggles for dignity and decency in the midst of abject, antagonistic circumstances. The play unfolds the Younger family?s arduous endeavours to realise their American dreams in a country where they are second-class citizens. After his death, Walter Younger?s insurance money is about to reach his family. This sets off a series of questions in the minds of his heirs and descendants, as to how to use this legacy. Will they use it to buy their own home, to finance the medical school education of Beneatha, a daughter of the family, or to invest it in a new business that may finally change the family?s fortunes? Direction: Brian C. Russo (USA). Presented by The American Centre and Spandan.

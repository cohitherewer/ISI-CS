 From collaborating with big names to performing at heritage sites to having six albums lined up for release, Bikram Ghosh is on a roll. First up is Rhythmscape 2, which will feature among others Greg Ellis who?s played the drums in movie soundtracks ranging from The Matrix trilogy to The Tomb Raider. The Los Angeles-based percussionist was in India to play for the Mumbai Festival and sneaked into Calcutta for a couple of days to jam with Bikram. 

 ?We first met five years back and we bonded immediately and just played for hours,? Greg said. ?We come from very different cultures and traditions. He has this great lineage and I have found my own way. So our music is like a global connection of rhythm.?

 For Bikram, jamming with Greg was a great feeling. ?American drummers do not have the downbeat that we Indians have,? he explained. ?But not so with Greg and that?s why he is so good at his music. He is not only featuring in Rhythmscape 2 but also another album called Bikram Ghosh Jams, which features me in a jugalbandi with several great musicians around the world. I also plan to have Greg as a guest trainer in my school once that comes up.?

 If albums are a priority for Bikram, live concerts are no less important. ?Album sales of classical music may have gone up but live performances still fail to find audiences. So, I am planning to play at 24 heritage sites across India in the coming months, six in each of the four zones of the country. We also have the concerts recorded to be available on DVD with a half-hour show describing the origin and historical significance of the sites.?

 The musician will anchor the documentaries describing the heritage locations. ?We plan to start on March 1, with a show at the Prinsep Monument, featuring Rahul Sharma (son of Shiv Kumar Sharma) and me along with Rhythmscape. The other five Calcutta sites should include Victoria Memorial, Lalbazar and Lahabari. I have already spoken to the mayor and police officials and they are all very excited,? signed off Bikram.

 Imam faces business probe

 - Police to look into personal angle in murder attempt

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Almost nine days after the attempt to gun down a 33-year-old leather trader from Tangra, the police at Karaya have decided to probe the business details of Haji Abdul Rezzak, as well as his relations with his business partner, to crack the case. 

 Abdul supplied leather gloves to export agents. Police feel that the assailants wanted to settle old scores relating to business. While both Karaya police and the detective department have detained over 20 men in the past two days, no one has been arrested so far.

 On the afternoon of June 10, two men on a motorcycle chased Abdul on bridge no. 4 leading to the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector and shot at him thrice while trying to snatch his bag, containing a lakh in cash. Abdul, who was on a scooter, lost his balance and fell on the road without a single bullet hitting him. 

 When some young men of the area rushed to his help, the goons fled. The trader was taken to the Jamad Ali mosque, in Abinash Chandra Lane, of which he is also the imam. He was later taken to Karaya police station for interrogation. 

 ?Over the past one-and-a-half years, Abdul had sacked some of the employees who worked in his factory in Abinash Chandra Lane. There were theft charges against them. Some of them are from Taldi, Ghutiari Sharif and Canning, in South 24-Parganas. We would like to grill some of the staff for more details on why these men were sacked while trying to probe the exact nature of Abdul?s relations with his business partner,? said a Karaya police station source.

 While Abdul claims that the youths on motorcycles had chased him to snatch the cash that he had withdrawn half-an-hour earlier from the Ladies? Park branch of a nationalised bank, police are not ready to buy that.

 ?If the youths wanted to take the money, they could have. Our findings suggest that they wanted to gun him down. While it could be some business-related issue, we are also trying to find out if they had anything personal against the man,? said a senior officer of the detective department.

 Girls still missing, ransom trail cold 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The detective department intensified its search for the three girl students of Class X, who have been missing since Monday, but failed to make any headway. More than 48 hours have passed since their disappearance.

 ?We have questioned a number of people, including relatives of the girls, their friends and classmates. The authorities of their schools have also been questioned,? said an investigating officer.

 ?We are probing the matter from every angle,? claimed Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department.

 Sedna Ali (resident of Park Circus), Swagata Das (resident of Topsia) and Shreyashi Talukdar (resident of Sodepur) had left their homes on Monday morning, ostensibly to go to schools. They have not been seen since then.

 Sedna is a student of The Academy, in the Park Street area. The other two are students of Pratt Memorial School. The investigating officer said before joining The Academy in 2005, Sedna was a student of Pratt Memorial School. ?So, the three were close friends,? he said.

 The investigating officer said there was little chance of the girls being kidnapped for ransom as they were friends, and before they disappeared, they had had talks.

 None of the three girls? relatives has received any ransom call so far.

 The officer said they were not trying to avoid writing their examinations as they were not dull. ?There might be some other reasons. Excepting for one of them, none was carrying enough money to sustain them for long,? the officer said. One of the girls had disappeared with Rs 1,200.

 The families of the three girls panicked when they did not return home till late on Monday afternoon. Initially, they had contacted relatives and friends, but in vain. Then an FIR was lodged with Beniapukur police station, that covers Pratt Memorial School.

 WEDDING PLANNER - 

 Madhumita Bhattacharyya 

 If you have been hiding your horoscope 

 for fear that your in-laws might exercise their veto powers 

 once they see it, you need live a lie no longer. If your 

 unlucky stars are a harbinger of death to your fianc, look 

 towards those other stars to provide a potion to 

 rid your kundli of the shadow of doom.

 You can trust the Big Bs (the 

 real one and the almost-there one) and Lady 

 A to make fashionable the dreaded Mars with its undisputed 

 evil eye. Just make sure you have 51 priests and a family 

 astrologer as back up. Appease the gods and you may have 

 an outside chance of not killing your husband.

 On second thoughts, lose the horoscope. 

 And your birth certificate, too, just to be sure. No yagnas 

 will ever be enough to wash away the seed of doubt, and 

 what they dont know wont hurt em. Turn 

 your attention to the most critical wedding logistics that 

 need to be planned in advance: venue and menu.

 Escape in style

 If the happy couple has to take, 

 for whatever reason, the marriage vows in secret, it need 

 no longer be a five-minute affair in a marriage registrars 

 office.

 (Is that what Abhishek and Ash 

 did? Is that why she sat on his left, as only a wife would, 

 and not on his right and not on his lap? The mind boggles.)

 anners are now putting together 

 weddings just for two, or for a few close friends and family 

 members. You can cap off the low-key affair on a beach at 

 sunset with a high-voltage meal, say a seven-course candlelit 

 dinner with Dom Perignon flowing liberally.

 If your guest list will not allow 

 for such intimacy or extravagance, you may have to succumb 

 to the theme-wedding bug, which has swept across all the 

 chichi up-country dos. A theme wedding does not mean a costume 

 party. It simply means that organising it will bring with 

 it bigger pain than Bond experienced in the torture room.

 Dont tread this territory 

 unless you have the competitive edge and a zeal for keeping 

 up with the Singhs. Unless the food and drink is the finest 

 money can buy, preen at your own peril. Is a live dal 

 counter the best you can do? Fly in a sushi master from 

 Japan, along with the freshest salmon, tuna, shrimp and 

 eel you can find, for a live sushi counter instead. Make 

 sure the buffet is so long that your guests will need a 

 golf cart to get around it. Or, make them walk and work 

 up an appetite.

 There is a smorgasbord of style 

 and flavour to set your wedding bash on fire. Moroccan, 

 Egyptian, Japanese, French and even German cuisines have 

 made their entry into wedding bills of fare. Elements from 

 those cultures would also be borrowed for the styling of 

 clothes and venue. Everything must fit into the grand design 

 invitations to entertainment, menu to mandap. If 

 you have settled on a Goan gala, then the beach of your 

 choosing will be decorated in the style of your picking 

 with a menu laden with cuisine from the area. Get Wendell 

 Rodricks to design the trousseau and Remo to perform.

 Spare no expense and you may even 

 find an infotainment channel to film the whole event and 

 display your most intimate real-life moments as if they 

 are reel-life Rajshri Pictures footage.

 Indian exotica

 If the bride or groom or both 

 live abroad, be sure to choose any slice of Indian exotica 

 that strikes your fancy. Palaces in Rajasthan are the usual 

 pick (not yet pass, though they are tottering at the brink). 

 To make it stand out, you really have to think out-of-the-box. 

 For instance, you could organise a lazy afternoon of elephant 

 polo and let your guests play mahut, like one Bangalore-based 

 hotelier did last season. (It may be lazier than you expect 

 as elephants gambol more than run.) 

 Invite a few Clintons, a prince 

 or two, Liz Hurley and some other minor stars, and you may 

 just pull it off.

 You are limited only by ambition, 

 imagination and bank balance.

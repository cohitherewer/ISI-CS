 ?Read widely, write from your heart?

 Jhumpa Lahiri: Local 

 link

 Author Jhumpa Lahiri 

 responds to questions emailed to her by Oindrila Bhar, 

 a Class XII student of La Martiniere for Girls. The writer 

 had won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2000 for The 

 Interpreter of Maladies and her novel The Namesake 

 has been made into a film.

 Did you always want to be a 

 writer?

 I have loved to read and write since I was a child, but I never dreamed of becoming a published writer until I was much older. It still feels like a dream. I always wrote in English as that was the language of my schooling.

 Tell us about your childhood...

 I grew up in a small university town in Rhode Island. My parents had a large group of Bengali immigrant friends in New England and so I was raised in two worlds simultaneously ? the small immigrant community of my family and the American culture of school and my physical surroundings.

 How frequently have you visited 

 India? Did you like the visits or resent them like Gogol 

 in your novel The Namesake?

 Until I was in my early twenties, I visited India once every two years or so. I continue to visit, though not quite as frequently. There were aspects to those visits I valued immensely. It was wonderful to see my extended family, to feel connected to them, and to see the place and the people from which my parents came. It helped me to understand my parents in a way I would not have otherwise. It was overwhelming but also deeply illuminating to see life being lived in such a drastically different way. I did feel out of place in India. As a child I felt out of place pretty much wherever I was.

 What kind of image of India 

 did you take back? Did you share it with your friends in 

 America?

 I didn?t speak about India with my American friends. It felt like a private and indescribable place. One of the things that drew me to writing as I got older was that I felt the need to begin to describe that other world to which I was so frequently and intensely exposed.

 Are the characters of your 

 stories drawn from real life? Which one do you identify 

 with the most?

 The characters are always composites, combining traits from certain people I?ve known or observed or heard of, and the rest is invented in the course of writing. I have always put a piece of myself into every character I?ve created, to a greater or lesser degree.

 Most of your stories are about 

 immigrant Bengalis and their predicament abroad. Can Americans 

 identify with them? 

 I don?t approach my stories as being about a specific cultural group or experience. I try to write about human beings and the difficulties of existence, and I would hope that there is a universality to that.

 Mira Nair has made a movie 

 on The Namesake in which you have a special appearance....

 I have seen the film and am absolutely astonished and delighted by what Mira has done.

 Who are your favourite authors?

 James Joyce, Chekhov, Tolstoy, William Trevor and Virginia Woolf are some writers I greatly admire. Among Indians, R.K. Narayan is a favourite.

 Your message to aspiring writers?

 Read widely and deeply, and write from your heart.

 When can we expect your next 

 book? 

 I am currently working on a book of stories.

 The Diary

 The 20th wonder

 It was the year 2120,

 Robots romped the planet,

 More than humans.

 The earth was barren,

 Rough, dark, still,

 The land was scarred by metallic limbs,

 Dead, dull and doomed forever. 

 I was walking down the street,

 When a signboard caught my eye. 

 It spoke vividly of the 20th wonder of the world!

 I gaped at it, shocked.

 I rode to the address on a fly-car,

 The place was crowded,

 It looked wonderful,

 Like a lifeless, muted fair.

 I walked into the hall,

 Staggering with the crowd,

 Sometimes a metallic shove,

 Or a human push.

 Many wonders have wondered all these years,

 In front of me stood the 20th.

 I saw it.

 The mob buzzed.

 I saw it, 

 and was stunned.

 In a wire cage stood,

 A young, green sapling!

 Don Bosco School, Bandel 

 A man

 A receding hairline

 A prim necktie...

 A dark, dark heart

 Plastic smiles...

 The stuffed man burns

 on a lonely aisle

 His gods and demons

 dark... on either side.

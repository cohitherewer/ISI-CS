 Knock, loot 

and leave

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two youths posing as salesmen entered a flat in Old Ballygunge 2nd Lane, not far from the chief ministers residence, on Thursday morning and looted jewellery and cash after tying up the landlady. No arrest has been made.

 The robbery was carried out around 11.30 am when Arpita Mukherjees husband and son were not in the flat, in the Karaya area. She was home with the familys help.

 Arpitas husband Amit is an employee of Jadavpur University, while their son works in a bank. The robbers struck soon after the two left home, said deputy commissioner (south division) Ajay Kumar.

 According to Arpita, the robbers, in their late 20s and clad in trousers and shirts, walked into the flat saying they were salesmen. The door was open and I was overseeing the helps work. One of the men took out a knife from his trouser pocket and held it to my throat. The other one pushed the help inside the kitchen and bolted the door from outside. The duo threatened to kill us if we raised an alarm, she recounted.

 The youths then disconnected the telephone line and tied my hands and legs. They took the bangles and the other gold ornaments I was wearing, Arpita added. One of them then forced me to show them where the key to the almirah was kept. He then entered the bedroom and took out the cash.

 The men bolted the entrance to the flat before leaving. The cash and jewellery were not worth more than Rs 20,000. But from the style of operation, the men appear to be professionals who knew the area well, stated an officer of the detective department.

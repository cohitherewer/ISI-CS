 Who is the most stylish actor in Bollywood: Abhishek Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan or Saif Ali Khan? Who is the most stylish actress in tinsel town: Priyanka Chopra, Preity Zinta (picture below) or Kareena Kapoor? Lycra MTV Style Awards will answer these questions with its annual showdown.

 Divided into three broad categories popular, technical and honours the awards this year will zero in on the most stylish people in fashion, films, sports, television, business, politics and music.

 The event to be held in Mumbai on October 14 at MMRDA Bandra Kurla Complex, will also witness a fashion show with the likes of Neeta Lulla, Ritu Kumar, J.J. Valaya and Rohit Gandhi-Rahul Khanna presenting their lines.

 Creating clothes exclusively for the fourth edition of the Lycra MTV Style Awards, each designer will team up with a high-voltage music performer to present a unique fusion of fashion and music. Additionally, designer Suneet Verma will create a special line for the opening sequence.

 Of the 29 panelists picking the nominees, some names include Arjun Rampal, Ashok Salian, Manish Malhotra, Malaika Arora Khan, Mehr Jessia, A.D. Singh, Nafisa Ali, Prahlad Kakkar, Queenie Dhody, Nandita Mahtani and Anamika Khanna.

 Shortlisted nominees in the popular category will then be up for voting (on mtvindia.com and on SMS) for the fashionistas of the world to pronounce their verdict. The winners in the technical and honours categories will be decided by the panelists.

 To me, an awards ceremony like this is all about celebrating personal style more than anything else, Rampal told Metro. On his own style statement, the hunk said: I like to be comfortable.

 Rampal made it clear that there could be no one criterion or yardstick to judge the style icons in this contest. We have to look at their individualities, he smiled. They are all cool people and they are also all friends. So it will be tough to decide who is the most stylish of them all.

 Talking of on-screen style, Rampal felt his next release, Farhan Akhtars Don, was the ultimate in stylisation. The film has been styled according to the times, said the actor who plays the role Pran played in the original. 

 I am very excited about the great reactions that the film has been receiving. It is what I call very, very stylish.

 Global ties for local tech firm

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 Global players in the IT and ITeS arena are not the only drivers of economic growth in Bengal. Home-grown technology companies, too, are doing their bit. Calcutta-based Globsyn Technologies, one of leading talent transformation (training) organisations in east India, is an example. 

 The company has been appointed the sole Indian talent acquisition and transformation (TAT) partner for Amex, one of the largest financial service providers in the world. Globsyn has developed its own TAT model, which is a structured, end-to-end services delivery framework allowing IT and ITeS companies to outsource their manpower sourcing, candidate selection and process training requirements.

 ?While vendors offer TAT on a piecemeal basis, we are the only high-end organisation to have a client-specific service delivery and engagement model. Globsyn is Amex?s exclusive partner for providing end-to-end candidate sourcing, selection, acquisition and training services,? said Bikram Dasgupta, CEO, Globsyn Technologies.

 The training is being conducted at Globsyn BPO Academy, which provides instructions in voice and soft skills (human excellence training) in addition to conducting courses on the domain.

 While human excellence training includes English grammar, voice and accent, culture (of the US and UK), telephone and customer service skills, domain courses cover the technology, financial services and healthcare sectors.

 ?After tying up with Amex in late 2005, Globsyn was asked to do three pilot batches to prove the quality of service and delivery capability. We successfully delivered to Amex the batches and the candidates are performing well,? stated Dasgupta. 

 The contract with Amex is not time-bound, since the relationship is based on Globsyn?s service delivery capabilities and quality. The company has also piloted the TAT model with a number of India?s leading third-party ITeS organisations such as IBM and Tech Mahindra. 

 ?We are expanding the dedicated hiring and sourcing and training team to service other top-20 captive and third-party ITeS organisations that are interested in the TAT model,? added Dasgupta.

 The Amex BPO is in the top bracket of ITeS organisations in India. The only BPO to be ranked amongst the best companies to work for in India by Businessworld, it was set up in Gurgaon in 2002.

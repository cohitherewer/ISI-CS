 Goodwill meet in clash belt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 No arrests have been made yet in connection with the clashes in Basudebpur, Behala, over a post-Kali puja soiree that left several people, including women and a CPM local committee member, injured.

 The trouble started on Friday night during a programme by Basudebpur Boys Club near Masjidpara, after some youths started dancing in an obscene manner. This led to clashes between two groups that were stopped by CPM local committee member Nurul Islam. The trouble resumed on Sunday evening. 

 Rapid Action Force personnel were then deployed and a police picket posted in the area. 

 Local CPM councillor Ratna Roy Mazumdar said a peace meeting was held on Monday, which was attended by members of Basudebpur Boys Club and youths of Jahajbaripara, the warring groups, and local residents including Islam, who was injured in the clash.

 Most of those involved in the clash are teenagers. I have asked them to behave and ensure that such an incident does not recur. Officers from Behala police station also visited the area and asked them to behave themselves, she added.

 The police picket and RAF personnel have been withdrawn from the area.

 We are looking for the culprits. We have interrogated a number of youths and got some leads that will help us arrest the guilty, stated additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas D.P. Singh.

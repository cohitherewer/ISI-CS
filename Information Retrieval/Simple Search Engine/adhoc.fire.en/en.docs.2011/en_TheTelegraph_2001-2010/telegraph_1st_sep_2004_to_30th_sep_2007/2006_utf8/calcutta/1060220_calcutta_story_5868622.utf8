The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Star power, people parade

 1 

 There were stars galore at The Telegraph Kolkata 

 Marathon 06, but one outshone the rest on Sunday 

 morning. Mobbing matched the Marathon mood as soon as Prosenjit 

 (flanked by Roopa Ganguly and June) reached the starting 

 point on Red Road. Im very happy to be here. 

 The turnout and the enthusiasm of the people this morning 

 just proves how spontaneous and spirited Calcuttans are, 

 said Tollywoods Nayak, before obliging fans 

 (from five to 55) with autographs on cap, paper or palm, 

 posing for the flashbulbs and escaping the near stampede 

 that he caused.

 Others from tinsel town included 

 Sabyasachi Chakraborty and Arindam Sil. Im all 

 for the Marathon. Im not able to run because I have 

 a slight cramp and a shooting scheduled later. But Ive 

 come with my wife to show solidarity towards the city, 

 said Feluda.

 2 It 

 was this tiny tot who perhaps best symbolised the spirit 

 of the Marathon. Age and ability were no bar as over 20,000 

 people poured on to the streets, many to run and many to 

 cheer.

 Hat-trick hurrah! Reena Das reached the finishing line ahead 

 of the rest for the third year in a row at the Womens 

 Marathon, clocking 44 minutes and 40 seconds. 

 I began running in 1986, with short distances, and then went on to cross-country and later, marathons. Ive participated in marathons in Allahabad, Chennai, Thane, Meerut and Lucknow. I would love to go on to the international level, but I need sponsorship for that, said the 32-year-old from Nadia who is coached by her husband Bachchu Datta. Their son Ratul joined in the Fun Run.

 If for Reena Sunday was all about 

 winning, for first-timer Divya Thirani it was all about 

 participating. I just decided to do this yesterday 

 and registered. I ran the entire 10.5 km and loved it. I 

 want to do it again next year, said the 20-year-old.

 4 What 

 better than a beat blast while waiting for the Main Marathon 

 to end? The crowd rocked to Bollywood and pop numbers belted 

 out by Sandeep Vyas at the finishing point.

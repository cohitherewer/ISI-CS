 Squad to cut flow of arms for polls

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 The government railway police (GRP) in Howrah has set up a team to prevent pre-poll smuggling of arms into Calcutta and its adjoining areas from Bihar and other states.

 A senior GRP officer said illegal arms start pouring in before every election. ?Two persons were arrested in the past month. Both were from Munger, in Bihar, and were acting as conduits for dealers in Metiabruz, Park Circus and Tiljala.?

 Of the two arrested, one was Imran Khan, 28. He was picked up by the Howrah GRP from Tikiapara station on Sunday, while he was trying to board a Jodhpur-bound train. 

 An illegal revolver was found on him. During interrogation, he reportedly admitted having delivered six revolvers to a ?party? in Park Circus. 

 An unauthorised rifle was seized from the other accused, arrested in January. 

 The two arrests have put the force in an alert mode, and prompted the brass to set up the special team, comprising around 80 personnel. 

 ?Our men are conducting raids and carrying out special checks on platforms of various stations,? said Taj Mohammad, inspector-in-charge of the Howrah GRP. 

 An officer of the force said most unauthorised arms, especially rifles and revolvers, arrive in the city from Bihar. ?There is an illegal arms factory in Munger, which supplies a bulk of the pre-poll consignment. Arms are also smuggled in from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.?

 Elaborating on how city-based dealers of such arms operate, another officer said: ?Some dealers act as ?fences?. They receive the arms and sell them to sub-dealers, who route the consignment to various parties.?

 The market, he added, is big enough to generate lakhs in ?revenue?.

 ?Our aim is to locate the main dealers. Once we get hold of them, the entire racket will fall apart. But netting the principal players is proving to be difficult. We are interrogating the arrested duo, two major raids have been carried out, but there has been no breakthrough,? the officer admitted.

 Police suspect the kingpins are holed up in Metiabruz and Garden Reach. ?Talks are on with local police, and if necessary, joint raids will be conducted to arrest them,? said the officer.

 The main problem in preventing smuggling of illegal arms, officers admit, is the ingenious methods employed by the carriers.

 ?At times, carriers hide guns in vegetable sacks or bring them on their persons. It?s impossible to check all the sacks or frisk all passengers,? said an officer.

 ?Metal detectors have been installed at select stations, but their use is limited. We are activating our contacts, so we receive timely tip-offs. That, perhaps, is the only way to intercept the smugglers,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lunge cop arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Swapan Singha, constable of the Reserve Force accused of harassing a woman in front of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters last Friday, was arrested a week later.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pradip Kumar Chatterjee said: ?Singha was booked under Sec. 354 of IPC (outraging the modesty of a woman). He has been placed under suspension.? 

 Tanushree Ghosh, the complainant, was not called for an identification parade. A case was already on against Singha, as he was found guilty during the investigation. 

 ?It is good the constable has been arrested,? Tanushree told Metro on Friday.

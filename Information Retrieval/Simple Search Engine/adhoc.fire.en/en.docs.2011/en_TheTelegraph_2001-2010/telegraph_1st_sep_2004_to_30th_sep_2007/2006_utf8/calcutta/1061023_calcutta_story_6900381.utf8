 Art and emotion

 Offering individual perspectives on themes and ideas that have common, universal relevance, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by Sourabh Mazumdar, Kamal Kushari and Pankaj Nigam attempts to rekindle social consciousness. The works of Sourabh Mazumdar reflect a simplicity of style that bestows on his creations a richer and more enduring significance. Kamal Kushari (Gist; picture left) is an artist best known for his creative use of pastels. Whether on paper or on canvas, his paintings rewrite the codes of conventional pictorial language. Deeply affected by violence, his art is full of pathos and emotion, and establishes an easy communication with the art-lover. Pankaj Nigams creations are a fusion of art and poetry, freedom and conformity, empathy and expression. Mainly articulating human feelings and desires, his works are introspective pieces that take the viewer on a journey of self-discovery and realization.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Heritage retail rendezvous

 - Riverside landmark leased out for shopping mall

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Bluewater, Kent ? Europe?s largest out-of-town shopping development. BullRing, Birmingham ?the UK?s biggest retail-led inner-city regeneration project. Mackinnon amp; Mackenzie House, 16 Strand Road ? Calcutta?s first private push to restore a heritage structure in Dalhousie Square and create contemporary retail by the river in an old-world setting?

 The grand structure at the Strand Road-Fairlie Place intersection, following a Rs 100-crore conservation move for adaptive reuse, will retain its heritage facade, while leasing out its 455,000-sq-ft inner shell with the atrium to Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd to do a large, seamless modern mall.

 Pantaloon has engaged retail-space specialists Benoy of the UK for the riverside project to work with city-based architect Dulal Mukherjee, anchoring the restoration routine to conserve the heritage southern and western facades.

 Graham Cartledge, architect and chairman of the UK company founded in 1947 by Gordon Benoy, has been to the Strand on a reconnoitre trip and is already working on the internal design solution.

 Benoy has created both the BullRing, which won the International Council of Shopping Centre?s ?Best new large European shopping centre? award and Bluewater, which is located in a disused chalk pit at Dartford, Kent, and houses 1.6 million sq ft of retail space.

 ?Our aim is to create an iconic development by the river, which will draw not just city shoppers, but global tourists too,? says A.N. Shroff, heading Diamond Group, the private consortium doing the restoration of Mackinnon amp; Mackenzie House, which was devastated by a fire on November 7, 1998. The high court had since ordered its reconstruction.

 The restored and treated edifice will be handed over to Pantaloon retail ?by June 30, 2008? on a 25-year lease with a nine-year lock-in period.

 ?We are extremely excited about the Strand project, since it will be totally different from anything done in the country before. We are confident Benoy will deliver another winner that can transform the entire zone,? says a top official in the Pantaloon group.

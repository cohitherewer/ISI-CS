 Festive finale

 POULOMI BANERJEE

 Festivals would be sweet, but for the sweets stuffed down your throat during the festive days! If you agree with this statement, and your anticipation of Puja adda and new dresses is dampened by the thought of the ghee-dripping laddoos and syrupy gulab jamuns to follow on Dashami, take heart. If you are lucky, you might just be greeted with a box of chocolates instead of the conventional mishti this Puja.

 Over the past year or two, we have noticed a distinct change in consumer preference. People have been veering away from traditional mithai to try pastries and chocolates. Our business has really gone up during this period. People usually prefer soft confectionery, something that can replace the barfi and pedas, said Sudipto Saha, food and beverage consultant of Kookie Jar. Most people who buy our pastries during the Pujas are in the 30-35 age group, added Sudip.

 From chocolates and pastries to ice-cream flavours chocolate and much more. Last years response was so good at Mama Mia, the citys first gelato chain, that owner Natasha Agarwal decided to keep the store open through the night this year.

 Last Puja, we had opened our new shop at Ballygunge Circular Road just before the Pujas and the response was fabulous. People kept coming in long after the closing hour. We had to keep the shop open till well past midnight. This year, we have kept the outlet open till 3 clock, and the response has been terrific, said Natasha. 

 Most of the customers were families who had been out pandal hopping. There were a lot of youngsters, too, she added.

 Mama Mia has introduced a range of gelato cakes to cater to the festive demand, but the popular pick has been the gelato sundae.

 The demand is equally good at the cake shops of five-star hotels. Sujan Mukherjee, executive chef, Taj Bengal, said: Over the past few years, we have seen a steady rise in demand of at least 15 per cent at La Patisserie during the Pujas. Apart from individual customers, we also get a good amount of corporate booking. New companies, like BPOs, prefer to send chocolates to their corporate clients rather than traditional mithai. 

 Mukherjee attributes the rise to a number of reasons. There is greater availability of quality confectionery today. People have been exposed to a variety of cuisine and so their taste is also changing. Also, people today are more health conscious. Since many of our pastries are eggless, or made without sugar or are fat-free, they prefer these to traditional sweets, he reasoned.

 Park Street also feels the bite of the Puja sweet-tooth syndrome. Salmoli Mukerji of The Park, said: Last year, business at Flurys jumped by 24-30 per cent during the Puja period. It is an important business time for us, though Puja demand is yet to catch up with Christmas-time sales.

 The legendary confectionery and tea shop has introduced special chocolates and chocolate delicacies to woo customers, 24x7 during the peak festive days.

 So if you want to give the pantuas and sandesh a miss this Dashami, explore the world of chocolates and gelatos. A sweet festive finale has many more flavours now.

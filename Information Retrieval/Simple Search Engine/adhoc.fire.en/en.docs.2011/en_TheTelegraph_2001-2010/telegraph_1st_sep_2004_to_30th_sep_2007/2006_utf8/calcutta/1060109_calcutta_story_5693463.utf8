 Taking a cue from Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is going ahead with plans to sell advertisement space on EM Bypass, Kona Expressway and the Lake Gardens flyover. 

 The money will be used to repair and beautify the roads.

 The HRBC has earned around Rs 3 crore by selling advertisement space on the four flyovers in the city ? Gariahat, AJC Bose Road, Park Street and Lock Gate ? built with funds from Japan Bank of International Cooperation. It was the implementing agency of the flyovers.

 The CMDA, which works under the urban development department, has constructed the Bypass, Kona Expressway and the Lake Gardens flyover and is also responsible for their maintenance. 

 It has decided to let out 1,317 lamp posts on the Bypass, Park Circus and the Kasba connectors. Two rotary islands ? Parama island and Kasba connector ? will also be let out.

 On Kona Expressway, 241 lamp posts and billboard sites at prominent spots between the Vidyasagar Setu approach and National Highway 6 will be hired out for advertisement. On the Lake Gardens flyover, space will be sold on 114 lamp posts, guard walls and entry-exit points.

 The firms buying the space will have to erect ?sophisticated and illuminated? billboards or kiosks.

 ?Around Rs 1 crore a year is required to repair and maintain the Bypass and the two connectors. The Bypass being one of the key arteries of the city, we have to keep it in proper shape. If we can raise funds by selling space, we will not have to depend on the exchequer. Government money can then be spent on laying more roads,?? explained a senior official of CMDA.

 ?We have invited tenders from agencies and hope to collect a reasonable amount by selling space, as the roads and the flyover are in prime locations,? the official added.

 ?Our move is aimed at reducing financial dependence on the government,? said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. ?We will definitely pump in funds to lay roads, and build bridges and underpasses. But we must also arrange for funds to maintain them. Hence, our thrust is on resource mobilisation.?

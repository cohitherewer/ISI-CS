 To Hong Kong and back in 25 minutes is the culinary quick-trek promised by Haka, the countrys maiden outlet in the quick-service Big Mac-style Chinese eatery chain from the Mainland China group.

 Just unveiled at City Centre, the 120-cover chic and contemporary Oriental cuisine format has been conceptualised by Anjan Chatterjee, the man who gave the city both Mainland China and Oh Calcutta!, and is designed to meld with the mall magic.

 A modern mall-goer is always on the move and in the mood to explore the myriad elements on offer. A laid-back, long-drawn-out meal is not what he/she is looking for. Haka, with its lightning-fast service and quick combos, fits the shop-eat-celebrate bill to a T, observes Chatterjee, director, Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd.

 Time is of prime essence here and the kitchen, as well as the live dimsum counter, is geared to function at a fast and furious clip. While the range of dimsums (at Rs 15 a piece) is served in two minutes flat, the soup comes in three to four minutes, and the main course is on the table by the seventh minute.

 The smart and elegant red-and-black theme (interiors done by Chatterjees wife Suchandra) adds to the contemporary ambience, while even the music on airplay is modern Chinese pop sourced from Guangzhou and Shenzen. A gong at the entrance, imported from Hong Kong, accentuates the theme and allows people to make their pleasure heard.

 Says Chatterjee: Todays China is going places and Hong Kong, in many ways, is the face of this new China, now that its integrated with the mainland. The fare at Haka draws heavily from Hong Kong, from the Shao-Shiang sauce used to cook the Flat Crab Cake to the influence of honey, from the dips to the looks and presentation.

 Even the brand mascot of Haka ? not an emperor or empress from the pages of history, but the modern Chinese girl from showbiz-Shanghai or happening Hong Kong ? complements the contemporary concept. Master chef Rajesh Dubey and his team accompanied Chatterjee on an extensive research recce to pick up the energy and versatility of Hong Kongs fast-food platter.

 At a mall, you could be store-hopping or killing time before the movie begins and very often children are at the heart of the excursion. In this scenario, quick bites and smaller portions are what you are looking for and Haka answers that need, Chatterjee stresses.

 Once you have kicked off with Chicken Wotib or Fried Wantons, you can choose from starters like Nutty Chicken Skewers or Sauteed Pepper Basil Corn. Warming up with Sour and Spicy Chicken Soup and Sweet Corn Vegetable Soup, you can dig into the main course.

 Here, the chef recommends Quick Tossed Chicken in Chilli Basil Sauce, Prawns with Sweet Chilli Sauce or Diced Chicken Hong Kong Style to go with the array of rice and noodle dishes. The rapid repast can be rounded off with a scrumptious portion of Caramel Custard.

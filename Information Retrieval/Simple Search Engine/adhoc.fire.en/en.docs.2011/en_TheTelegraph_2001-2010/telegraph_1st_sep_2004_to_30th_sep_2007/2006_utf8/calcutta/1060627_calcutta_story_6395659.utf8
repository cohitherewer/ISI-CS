 Online courses for India

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 Those who think distance learning programmes have not caught on in India might soon have to change their view. U21 Global, an online graduate school, is set to launch a number of programmes aimed at students in the country.

 U21 Global is a venture between Universitas 21, an international network of 18 leading universities in 10 countries, and Thomson Learning, an organisation specialising in tailored programmes.

 Jeremy Williams, director, pedagogy and assessment, U21 Global, told Metro: ?We are currently operating in over 50 countries. India?s economic progress over the past 10 years has fuelled the growth of the education sector, especially the higher education sector. We expect to have the highest number of students in India very soon.? 

 U21 Global already has a presence in IIM Bangalore. It plans to start a course in family business management, in collaboration with the B-school, by December.

 ?We offer the same course in China. Such a programme will help those who wish to expand their family-run businesses and introduce global, integrated management practices to their operations,? said Williams.

 U21 Global plans to establish an online university that will offer Master?s programmes in information systems management, international business, travel and tourism and public policy and public health. 

 ?We plan to establish offices in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi,? added Williams. 

 According to him, the distance learning programmes will succeed in India due to availability of greater bandwidth and a student-centred approach towards teaching.

 ?The professor acts as a guide, rather than as a teacher. If a student faces any academic problems, he can go online and discuss the matter with his guides. Guidance will be available 365 days a year, 24 hours a day,? claimed Williams.

 Students can register online and take up to five years to complete the courses. U21 Global has tied up with UTI Bank to offer study loans.The course fee can be paid in instalments. Scholarships will be available on the basis of merit.

 Rajesh Gidwani, a businessman from Chowringhee Lane, had finalised his plans for a family holiday in Kashmir. But then came the two terror attacks on tourists in the Valley on July 11 and 12. ?I cannot put my family?s life at risk, so I cancelled the Kashmir tour. But since we were really looking forward to this vacation, we decided to head off somewhere else,? said Gidwani. On Tuesday, the Gidwanis leave for Bangkok, instead of Kashmir.

 Scrap the place but not the plan seems to be the travelling Calcuttan?s mantra today, as Kashmir?s loss becomes a gain for Kerala ? or Bangkok. The inveterate holiday-goer forced to cancel Kashmir tickets is busy seeking alternative destinations, sending tour operators into a scurry.

 ?Those opting out of Kashmir trips are preferring places where the expenses are approximately the same and where visas are not required,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. ?A circular has been issued asking operators not to encourage Kashmir trips. It is not safe for tourists.?

 Beyond borders, a number of tourists are opting for Bangkok or Nepal, since visas are not required and a tour can be arranged quickly. Other sought-after holiday hotspots are Kerala, Goa and parts of north Bengal. Package tours to Rajasthan, covering Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Mount Abu and even Taj Mahal, are also catching on.

 Tour operators explained that since this is off-season, it?s easier to change travel plans at short notice. ?It would have been very difficult to look for non-Kashmir options two months ago or two months later,? revealed a tour operator.

 For a six-day, five-night tour of Kashmir, the average cost is around Rs 10,000 per head, excluding travel. For the same period, a trip to Bangkok costs approximately Rs 20,000 per head, inclusive of airfare, tour planners said. ?People are interested in such a package,? said Jasmine Vohra of AR-ES Travels. A similar sojourn to Nepal costs Rs 12,000, including airfare.

 ?A few months ago, we were advising people not to go to Nepal for safety issues,? said P. K. Jain of Transworld Services. ?But now, peace has been restored there but Kashmir is off the tourist map.?

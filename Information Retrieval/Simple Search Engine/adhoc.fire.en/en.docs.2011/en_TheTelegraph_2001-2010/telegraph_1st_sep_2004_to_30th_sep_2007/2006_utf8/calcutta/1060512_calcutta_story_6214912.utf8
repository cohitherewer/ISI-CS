The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Behind all that jazz

Screen On amp; Off

 Action time: A Bollywood 

 shoot in progress

 It?s a different look at Bollywood and a look that should lay bare many of the insecurities that dog one of the world?s largest film industries.

 The new series on National Geographic 

 channel titled Nat Geo Reveals kicks off this Sunday 

 with the hour-long documentary Sunset Bollywood. 

 Looking into the worlds of three one-film wonders ? Bhagyashree, 

 Rahul Roy and Kumar Gaurav ? Hong Kong-based Indian Komal 

 Tolani tries to understand instant stardom in tinsel town 

 and the hardships that follow.

 The film?s idea was born when Rahul Roy visited Hong Kong after Aashiqui became a big hit. The actor was an instant draw and Tolani was one amongst many who fell for his charms and that trendsetting hairstyle.

 But Rahul?s later releases could never match the Aashiqui success and soon he was out of reel reckoning.

 Bhagyashree

 Bhagyashree (Maine Pyar Kiya) 

 and Kumar Gaurav (Love Story) met a similar fate 

 when their later releases could never attain the success 

 of their smashing debuts.

 Tolani, a Film and TV graduate from the University of Bristol, used these three actors to explore not only the frivolous frailties of the industry but also what happens to the people once the halo behind them disappears overnight.

 ?Sunset Bollywood is in line with our constant endeavour to show the audiences what happens behind the scenes and how it happens,? Joy Bhattacharjya, senior vice-president programming of National Geographic Channel India, told Metro. ?The documentary tackles the basic idea of how stars react to 15 minutes of fame.?

 Sunset Bollywood will be shown this Sunday on the National Geographic Channel at 9 pm.

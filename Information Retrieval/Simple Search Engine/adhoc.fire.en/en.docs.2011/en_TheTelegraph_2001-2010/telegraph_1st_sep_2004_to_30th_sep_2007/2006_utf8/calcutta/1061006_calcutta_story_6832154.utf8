The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Early birds get the Don 

Diwali and early arrivals

 - Tickets 20 days in advance

 Shah Rukh Khan in Farhan Akhtars Don

1978: A long queue of Amitabh Bachchan fans 

is preparing to spend a night in front of Priya for advances of Chandra Barots 

Don to open early the next morning for the first day, first show just 48 

hours away.

2006: A Shah Rukh Khan fan just clicks on his 

desktop in the comfortable confines of his home to book the best tickets for Farhan 

Akhtars Don 20 days before the film is to reach theatres.

 Welcome to Bollywoods new game plan this Diwali early opening of advances to ensure a smooth (read huge) start at the box-office of potential blockbusters.

 The Fame multiplexes, in what is a first in the history of Indian cinema, opened advance bookings of Farhan Akhtars Don on the Net and voice dialling 20 days before the release date (October 20). The plex chain will open bookings across the counter 10 days in advance, on October 10.

 So, if you want to catch the remake action adventure at Fame (Hiland Park) on Diwali Saturday, you can buy your tickets, for Rs 180 each, now.

 People have so many commitments during Diwali but everyone wants to catch the big new release in town, Shonali Shroff, head of corporate communications of Shringar Cinemas, tells Metro.

 So, by opening advances early, we are ensuring that people can make their plans much in advance. We have already got a great response not only from Mumbai but also from our Calcutta patrons.

 If Shah Rukh arrives early, can Salman be far behind? The advances for the other big Diwali release, Shirish Kunders Jaan-e-Mann starring Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta, will open early, too. 

 Being distributed by INOX, its plexes at Forum and City Centre will sell tickets at least a week in advance.

 We usually open advances for a new film on Wednesday, as the programming happens very late due to last-minute negotiations with distributors, says INOX (Forum) general manager Vikas Syal. But with Jaan-e-Mann being handled by us, we can plan the shows early and so, open advances early, he explains.

 In the past few years, Diwali films have always opened big and gone on to become major hits. In 2004, of the four Diwali releases, Veer-Zaara, Aitraaz and (re-release) Mughal-e-Azam were major money-spinners at the box-office, while last year, Garam Masala and Shaadi No. 1 hit a hot streak in the festive week.

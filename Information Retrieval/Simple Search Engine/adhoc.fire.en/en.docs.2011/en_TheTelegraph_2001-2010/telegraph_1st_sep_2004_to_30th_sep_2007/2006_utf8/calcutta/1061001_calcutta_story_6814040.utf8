 After the casual code on Saptami 

 and tradition twist on Ashtami, Navami is the day to go 

 all out and look your glamorous best. And there are no fixed 

 fashion rules today; create your own statement to stand 

 out as you hit the pandals on the penultimate day of Puja 

 2006.

 Her

 If you belong to the 20-something 

 bracket, be experimental. Designer Sayon Mitra dresses Swastika 

 Mukherjee (left) in an Indo-western three-piece raw 

 silk ensemble. The turquoise outfit comprises a corset chiffon 

 top paired with a bolero jacket and boot-cut pants. The 

 flared sleeves on the jacket and the chiffon top break the 

 structured look and twist the garment for the fusion, festive 

 silhouette, explains Sayon. Her make-up is vibrant 

 and glamorous. The eyes are done up with turquoise shadow 

 close to the lashes with soft pink outer edging, kohl and 

 silver-gold highlights. The blush and lipstick are soft 

 pink. The hair is done up in a bouffant French roll.

 If you are in your mid-30s and 

 have been sticking to the red-and-gold Puja combo till now, 

 ditch tradition and bounce back to your trendiest best with 

 a fresh colour palette. Bidisha Bhaduri (left) shows 

 off the look in a Sunipa Samadder net sari in aqua tones. 

 A mix-and-match of applique, tie-and-dye, ornamentation 

 in gold, silver and crystals embellish the sari. I 

 have teamed the sari with a blue corset made of Baluchari 

 fabric to give it the Bengal touch, says Sunipa. Gold 

 shadow with a thin line of turquoise closer to the lash 

 and lower outer corner brighten up her eyes, with natural 

 blush and brown lips complementing her mature looks.

 Managing the dhoti on Ashtami 

 surely wasnt easy and youre relieved to be back 

 in your denims today. Max Benitz (left) dresses down 

 for Navami in a textured cotton shirt teamed with a linen 

 summer jacket by Medhavini Khaitan. Value-add: gold floral 

 print on the shirt.

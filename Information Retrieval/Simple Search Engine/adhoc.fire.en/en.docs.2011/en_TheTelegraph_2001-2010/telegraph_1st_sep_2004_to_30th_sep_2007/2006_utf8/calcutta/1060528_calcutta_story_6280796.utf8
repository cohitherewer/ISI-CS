The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 One-stop wonder shop

 HyperCITY, Malad, the model 

 of which should be replicated in Calcutta by the end 

 of next year

 Reconnoitre sorties to figure out traffic flow pattern and land use from the skies. ?Buying teams? flying in to pick up purchase points and comprehend consumer behaviour. Analysts to crystal-gaze and predict demand drifts?

 HyperCITY, ?India?s largest hypermarket? launched recently in Mumbai?s Malad by retail major K. Raheja Corp. Group, is keen to get its homework right before setting up shop in Calcutta, ?hopefully by end-2007?.

 The chain, which plans 55 HyperCITY outlets across the country, feels Calcutta should have six in the next 10 years. ?The hunt is already on for either empty land (around four acres) in which case we need 12 months, or a ready shell, wherein we can open up within 90 days of handover,? Andrew Levermore, chief executive officer, HyperCITY Retail (India Ltd), told Metro on Saturday.

 Levermore, in town for the two-day retail conclave, The Shop, presented by the Future Group and organised by Images Retail, stressed that Calcutta was high in the pecking order. He added that the chain was also on the lookout for anchor space of 120,000 sq ft and above in any new mall coming up.

 ?We will do a bird?s-eye mapping of the city from a small aircraft with urban-planning experts on board, which would help us understand better the road network, land massing and mix of commercial and residential development in Calcutta before we go to the ground,? the CEO explained.

 The buying teams will fan across the city?s retail racks and ?extensively study? preferences, trends and consumer mindset that?s typical to the region. Once the basic inputs are in, the R amp;D team will go back to the drawing board, using the ground data obtained to firm up micro-level planning, also keeping in mind the state government?s vision plan for the city.

 ?HyperCITY?s compelling proposition is a distinctive and dominant assortment of products at great value. It?s a one-stop destination shop for everything, from bay leaves to bookshelf speakers, and we pledge the cheapest prices, trolley for trolley,? Levermore said. The 100,000 sq ft-plus Malad outlet has 38,206 product lines, 32 cash tills processing 768 entries and price look-ups every minute, with parking space for 1,000 cars.

 The array of products on the racks, sourced locally and from international markets, includes fresh produce, food amp; grocery, homeware, home entertainment, hi-tech, appliances, furniture, sports, toys amp; clothing, accessories and footwear. Calcutta HyperCITYs would have the same generic categories, with the final product-mix customised to suit local taste.

 The key is to constantly innovate, predict and pre-empt, Levermore felt. ?We took 22 months to conceive the Malad store, and we had to prove the IWWI (It Won?t Work in India) acronym wrong. We were told Indian housewives won?t buy pre-cut vegetables from the chiller and mountain bikes won?t sell in potholed Mumbai. Myths we have shattered.?

 The Mumbai outlet has recorded footfalls ?in excess of 12,000 on the quietest day?, clocking average sales of Rs 38,000 per minute, and the management had to revise store timings for ?repair and replenishment?.

 HyperCITY has partnered with JHP of London for in-store design, JDA for merchandise planning, Bax Global for logistics and supply chain management and with Johnson Diversey to improve customer shopping experience across key interaction points like food safety and sanitation. It also has an exclusive supply tie-up with Waitrose, a leading supermarket chain in the UK.

 Giving out the example of Carrefour ?failing in Hong Kong? and Wal-Mart quitting Korea, Levermore underlined that Indian retailers had nothing to fear from foreign biggies. ?HyperCITY exemplifies all that India should be proud of and Calcutta is set to join the buzz soon,? the chain?s South African CEO signed off.

 Sound, camera, action

 With performances lined up in 

 Houston and the UN, New York, at least one member of Bangla 

 band Bhoomi is basking in the limelight.

 Soumitra Ray is busy shooting 

 for his acting debut as the lead in Abhimanyu Sen, a telefilm 

 to be screened on Zee Bangla this June. The 103-minute film 

 produced by Ideas has been directed and scripted by Robin 

 who has telefilms like Cross Connection, Manabi, Bhorer 

 Malati, Beriye Aashi to his credit. The film will 

 zoom in on the Bangla band scene and even include songs 

 sung by this lead Bhoomi singer and musician.

 The film was written with 

 Soumitrada in mind, I met him about two years ago and asked 

 him casually whether he would act if I made a film on him. 

 He agreed readily and now I know I was not wrong. He is 

 quite free before the camera and is contributing enormously 

 to the project by writing and singing songs impromptu, on 

 the sets, said Robin, between shoots at City Centre.

 The film revolves around the 

 relationship between a 48-year-old singer (Soumitra Ray 

 as Abhimanyu Sen) and a 20-year-old fan (Swaralipi as Sahasha).

 The role of the singers wife, Sati, is played by 

 Moumita Gupta. The wife, at one time Abhimanyus inspiration, 

 realises how a gap has been created between them. 

 The singer struggles to juggle work pressure, marital duties, 

 and fan following. His attitude to Sahasha (Swaralipi) 

 is at times fatherly but neither he nor Sahasha can deny 

 a basic attraction, explained Robin.

 Such things are happening 

 to me all the time the over-enthusiastic fan, the 

 tension at home. Thankfully, some of us have understanding 

 wives, grinned Soumitra. I love my role and 

 feel that this is something everyone can identify with.

 You may laugh at it but I am taking

 for old age, laughed Dia Mirza, in town on Saturday

 Trikha and producer Subi Samuel. Picture by Aranya Sen

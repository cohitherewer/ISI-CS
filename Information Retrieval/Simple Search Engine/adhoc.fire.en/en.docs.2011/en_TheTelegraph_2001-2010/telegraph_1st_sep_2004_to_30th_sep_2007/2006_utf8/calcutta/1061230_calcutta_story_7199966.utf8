 Women to check cell smut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Flooded with complaints of teasing over the cellphone, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has decided to engage its womens wing to track down the culprits.

 We have been receiving complaints from various types of women, including housewives, schoolteachers and company executives, said an officer at the CIDs Bhabani Bhavan headquarters. 

 We start a probe after collecting the culprits number from a victims cellphone. But the process takes a lot of time, as we need to contact the service provider first to know the name and the address of the teaser, he explained.

 Besides, the teasers often procure their SIM cards by producing fake identity proof. In such cases, tracking them down is mission impossible.

 Elaborating on what has led the CID to engage its womens wing to tackle the crime, the officer said: It seems the callers are young and obsessed with women. We have asked our women officers to encourage the callers to ask them out for a date. The callers will surely bite the bait and the moment they show up, they will be arrested.

 A few days ago, police had tracked down a teaser employing such a strategy.

 The victim in this case had agreed to play the role of honeytrap. But most women are not comfortable with the idea. That is why we have engaged our womens wing, the officer signed off.

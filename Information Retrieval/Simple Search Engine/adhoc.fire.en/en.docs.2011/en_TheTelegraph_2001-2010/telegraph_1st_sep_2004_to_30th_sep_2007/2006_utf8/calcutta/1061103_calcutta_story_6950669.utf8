 No more cheques, pay tax in cash

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic body will not accept property tax, licence fee and other payments by cheque from January 1, 2007. 

 The decision has been made in view of a quite a few cheques bouncing, resulting in inflated revenue figures. Payments will only be accepted in cash or by bank drafts.

 According to municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, cheques for Rs 30 crore, a quarter of the annual revenue collection by cheque, have bounced so far. The number of bounced cheques is increasing rapidly. 

 Over 250,000 cheques are deposited with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) every year towards payment of property tax, trade licence fees, mutation fees, water connection fees and commercial water charges. Cheques for property tax make up about 70 per cent of the total number of deposited cheques.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya claimed: The previous civic board included the bounced cheques in the accounts to boost the figures.

 Bandyopadhyay said: I have taken the decision to discontinue collection of revenue by cheque after a discussion with the mayor.

 With the introduction of e-monitoring of revenue collection by the civic finance authority, it was found that over 50,000 dishonoured cheques were lying with various departments of the CMC since 1980-81 and no action had been taken against the issuers. 

 Chief of municipal finance and accounts Debotosh Dasgupta said the civic body collects revenue of more than Rs 120 crore by cheque each year and the unrealised amount could go up further. 

 The civic finance department has now started reverse entry of the bounced cheques.

 Since there was no system of reverse entry in the civic accounting system till 2002, the amount of the bounced cheques had shown up in the revenue income head in the annual accounts of the civic body.

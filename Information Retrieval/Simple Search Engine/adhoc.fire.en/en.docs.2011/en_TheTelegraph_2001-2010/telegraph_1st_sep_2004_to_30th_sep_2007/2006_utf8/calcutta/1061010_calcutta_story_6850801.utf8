The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Rekha

 You are generous by nature, fearless and fully confident that you will succeed. Others sense your magnetism and see your self-discipline and respect you. You are full of fresh ideas. Though you are a difficult taskmaster, you can always be relied on to do good work. It is tough for you to listen to the other side of the story, because you believe that everything revolves around you. Kusum Bhandari

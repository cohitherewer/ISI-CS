 The helicopter that will airlift patients to BM Birla heart hospital

 With helicopters to fly patients to hospitals, Calcutta has taken its healthcare standards to a new plane.

 Taking the lead is BM Birla Heart Research Centre, which on Wednesday announced the launch of its air ambulance facility. The helicopters will ferry patients from places like Haldia, Siliguri, Asansol and other eastern and northeastern states to BM Birla Hospital and Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI). 

 ?We have already tied up with the Royal government of Bhutan and talks are on with the Bangladesh and Nepal authorities to airlift patients from those countries,? said Rupak Barua, director (growth and development) BM Birla Hospital and CMRI.

 Patients with acute cardiac problems or other cases of trauma or in need of emergency services at these places will be able to avail of the facility. ?There was a demand from corporate organisations having bases in areas like Haldia, north Bengal and the northeastern states for an air ambulance facility,? Barua said. Most of these areas do not have advanced treatment facilities and the air ambulance service would cater to their needs.

 The hospital has tied up with Tops Air Rescue, a Delhi-based air ambulance transportation service provider. The choppers will initially be based at Guwahati airport, from where they will fly to various destinations across the region and air lift patients. The helicopter will land at Calcutta airport, from where the patient will be taken to the hospital in a critical care ambulance. Once the number of patients increases, a helicopter base can be set up at Dum Dum, hospital officials said.

 ?We are in talks with the state home department to allow us to land on the Presidency jail grounds, as that is closer to the hospital,? Barua said. The hospital authorities have also sought permission from the Royal Calcutta Turf Club authorities and Indian Army to land in the Race Course.

 ?There are plans to build a helipad on the hospital terrace. We have applied to the central aviation ministry for this,? said Suyash Borar, chief operating officer of the hospital.

 The helicopter will have the facilities of a mini-trauma care unit. It will be equipped with ventilators, cardiac monitors, pacemakers, lifespan, intravenous infusion pumps and solutions and other state-of-the-art gadgets. ?Treatment can be started on the way to the hospital inside the helicopter,? an official said.

 Besides, there will be a medical team consisting of specialist doctors, specialised flight nurses and criticalcare flight physicians and paramedics on the chopper.

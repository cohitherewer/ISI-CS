 Want to leave the congested roads and crowded pandals behind this Puja but dont want to miss out on the festive flavour? Shouldnt be difficult, with the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC) organising Sharodotsav 2006 on Ganga. 

 The puja on the river, aboard MV Sumangal and MV Mayurpankhi Nao, was organised last year, too, but this years edition will be bigger and grander. 

 In addition to the puja, cultural programmes will be held aboard MV Mayurpankhi Nao from Sashthi to Dashami. MV Sumangal will mainly be used to serve food. The vessels will set sail from Outram Ghat.

 About 140 people will be accommodated on each trip. There will be two trips every day a day trip from 9.30 am to 2 pm and an evening trip from 5 pm to 9.30 pm, explained Chinmoy Chakrabarti, general manager, WBTDC. 

 Snacks and lunch or dinner will be served. Tickets will cost Rs 500 each. 

 The likes of Shilajit, Dwijen Mukherjee and Manasi Mukherjee, along with some bands, will perform on board. An expert will explain the mythological aspect of the Puja, added Chakrabarti. 

 According to sources, 60 per cent of the tickets have already been booked. Tickets are available from the WBTDC office at BBD Bag and Udayachal Tourist Lodge in Salt Lake. Employees of a multinational firm and their families have bought tickets for at least one trip, said an official. 

 He claimed that some large hotels and multinational corporations have made inquiries about Sharodotsav 2006. 

 We have also made arrangements for other Puja tours from visiting traditional pujas in the city or places like Guptipara and Kalna to matri darshan at Adyapeeth or Dakshineswar, said Souren Bhattacharya, managing director, WBTDC.

 How to get 

 your bird to talk

 PASSION - Dr Goutam Mukherjee

 There 

 is nothing more entertaining than observing birds chirping 

 words and imitating the human voice. But to teach your birds 

 how to talk you need to keep several factors in mind. While 

 selecting the species, go for parakeets and budgies. Cockatiels 

 and lorikeets also have the capacity to mimic speech. African 

 grey parrot is said to be the best in the parrot family. 

 The most important thing is the personality of birds. Some 

 birds may be able to pick up words very quickly, while others 

 may need months of training.

 While buying a bird, test how 

 it reacts to your voice. If it shies away or squawks in 

 fear when you approach it, dont go for it. If it babbles 

 and shows interest in you, buy it. The younger the bird, 

 the greater its chance to learn how to speak. Also, male 

 birds are better talkers than females.

 Birds should be kept in the corner 

 of a room, so that they can hear human voices all the time. 

 Sit or stand in front of your bird and talk to him softly. 

 Start with small or simple words, like hello, good morning, 

 or small names. Talk to your bird whenever you get time 

 so that it gets used to your voice. Birds respond better 

 to high-pitch voices, so ask your wife/mother and kids to 

 take part in the training.

 You can record your words and 

 play it in front of your bird for five to 10 minutes, three 

 to four times a day. At first you may notice that your bird 

 is very enthusiastic. Encourage it by giving its favourite 

 food as a reward. Slowly, the chirping will become clear 

 and your bird will start uttering words. Once it speaks 

 a word, it will learn others much faster. Never whistle 

 in front of your bird or encourage it do so, as that would 

 hamper the training.

 Feather picking: One must 

 also be aware of some of the typical behaviours of birds. 

 One of these is feather picking, an obsessive and destructive 

 behaviour pattern where birds pluck their own feathers. 

 There are both medical and non-medical causes for this. 

 Medical causes include change in hormonal level, external 

 and internal parasite, bacterial and fungal infections of 

 the skin. Non-medical causes are psychological and stress-related 

 stress from being confined in the house or absence of 

 mating. Birds that are very prone to feather picking are 

 cockatoos, macaws, cockatiels and Amazon parrots.

 To stop feather picking, change 

 the location of the birds cage. Also, change its meal and 

 serve it some interesting food. Non-shelled walnuts, other 

 kinds of nuts, beans, macaroni and cheese can be given. 

 Some birds like fish and meat. Once engaged in eating, they 

 will find less time to pick feathers. Giving them toys to 

 play with can also be helpful. Birds love toys to tear and 

 break. Ice-cream spoons, raw hide, hard wood, small branches 

 of non-toxic trees can also be given.

 Tips: Boil neem leaves 

 and mix some turmeric in it. Give your bird a bath with 

 that water. Spraying Listerine water on the feathers is 

 also helpful.

 More about cockatiels: Cockatiels 

 love attention. In fact, if they do not get enough of it 

 they scream. Remember not to reward screaming or negative 

 behaviour. If screaming becomes a problem, gently cover 

 the cage with a light cloth and remove it only when the 

 bird quietens down. Many cockatiels are hand-fed and relatively 

 tamed. Even in case of a very tame cockatiel, it 

 may take a lot of patience before it gets used to you.

 Start by putting your hand in 

 his cage every day. Do not wave; just hold still. A little 

 later, you may teach it to step on to your finger by gently 

 nudging its legs. Again, patience is the key. If your bird 

 gets agitated, back off and try again later. 

 Talk to your bird every day. It 

 doesnt really matter what you say; you can read the newspaper 

 to it. Just use a relaxed monotone. Cockatiels make wonderful 

 companions. And as with any other pet, the more love you 

 shower on it, the more you will get back.

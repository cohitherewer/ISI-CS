 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Chandil

 Not far from the city, Chandil 

 is a quiet getaway at the foot of the Dalma range. A picturesque 

 dam on the Subarnarekha is the most prominent tourist draw 

 of the region.

 Hills and woods contribute to the considerable natural beauty of Chandil. The coming together of forests, highlands and a river lends the getaway almost a picture-postcard look.

 The forest is made of mostly sal and Segun trees. Kendu, Akashmoni, Mohua and Palash are also quite common.

 Spring, when Palash flowers bloom all over the Dalma range and make it reddish orange, is the best time of the year here. Millions of new leaves glistening in the bright sunlight, turning the forest into a grand dream in green.

 The forests and hills border the Jamshedpur-Ranchi highway that leads to Chandil. The forests are dotted by tribal villages. Groups of Santhals, Mundas, Kharias and Sabars populate the settlements.

 Wildlife is abundant in the forests. Elephant herds are the most dominant presence. During the harvesting season, the pachyderms often make their way out of the forest, sometimes leaving a trail of death and destruction in the tribal villages. There are also bears, jackals, wolves and wild boars.

 The dam offers a majestic view of the entire region. There is a hydel power plant. The water is released during summer for the sake of agriculture on the barren, rocky terrain.

 The Mathaburu and Ayodhya hills are close to Chandil. If you can find the time, drive down to the hills (in a hired car) via Balarampur. 

 Chandil on a full-moon night is special. The clear water of the dam reflects the moonlight like a mirror. A visit to the tribal settlements can be memorable on such nights. The villagers dance in groups to the beat of the madol and the dhamsa. It is a sight to behold.

 Apart from the dam, there is nothing much to see at Chandil. Back at the bungalow, the best way to spend time is to laze on the balcony. If you want some action, you can go on boating trips on the Subarnarekha.

 Evenings in the forests are mesmerising. 

 The call of unknown birds and animals makes it an exotic 

 experience.

 Walking the extra mile

 Is the finest formula for customer 

 care

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It invariably happens. A day before 

 their return to the Big Apple, she realised that she needed 

 to pick up her stock of contact lenses. They are a lot more 

 expensive back there. I met them when they were debating 

 where to buy them from. I advised them that they would need 

 a prescription from a doctor to order the lenses. She promptly 

 took out two empty packets of contact lenses that she had 

 just finished using. It was a branded and packaged product, 

 marketed in India by a reputed pharmaceutical company. I 

 felt a little more confident. After all, we all have read 

 about the retail boom in India. Surely, a branded packaged 

 good cannot be that difficult to find. I took on the onus 

 for they had a lot of packing to do.

 I stopped my car in front of a 

 neighbourhood shop specialising in optical products. The 

 signboard prominently displayed an international brand name. 

 I hesitantly asked whether they sold contact lenses; the 

 man behind the counter assured me that they did. I showed 

 him the empty packets. He made a phone call and said the 

 lenses would be there in 10 minutes. After half an hour, 

 the man who had made the commitment could not be located. 

 Finally I was told that the whole of Calcutta did not have 

 a stock of lenses of this particular specification.

 I decided not to waste any more 

 time and headed straight for the most reputed retailer of 

 optical products in Calcutta. Smartly-dressed salesmen greeted 

 me and looked carefully at the empty packets and said yes 

 they would be able to deliver the lenses in a couple of 

 days. Why two days? They said proudly they did not keep 

 the stocks but their vendor did. If I placed an order they 

 would procure it from them. I requested them to phone their 

 other outlets, so that I could pick it up from them. They 

 said their policies were inviolable and none of their outlets 

 would dare keep any ready stocks lest they ended up with 

 a very delighted customer.

 Back in my car, I called up the 

 lady and narrated my experience. She apologised and asked 

 me to abandon my efforts as she still had three months 

 stock. On my way back, as I was nearing their locality, 

 I noticed another outlet. I had heard about them and they 

 were not yet a leading chain. As soon as I walked in, the 

 manager walked up to me. I explained my urgency. He made 

 no promises up front. He made a call and said the lenses 

 would be there in 15 minutes. I was once bitten thus twice 

 shy. I asked him whether I could pay and then send my driver 

 back in half an hour. This was my test. He agreed. Half 

 an hour later, I was preparing myself for a trip back to 

 the shop to collect my refund. My phone rang and the same 

 man said: Sir, you can send your driver.

 The journey to the top for those 

 engaged in retailing requires many supports financial 

 resources, market opportunities and, yes, also some lucky 

 breaks. But perhaps none of these would qualify as the most 

 critical ingredient for success. That is quite a different 

 cup of tea.

 Walking the extra mile is a time-tested 

 therapy for fitness. And for customer care.

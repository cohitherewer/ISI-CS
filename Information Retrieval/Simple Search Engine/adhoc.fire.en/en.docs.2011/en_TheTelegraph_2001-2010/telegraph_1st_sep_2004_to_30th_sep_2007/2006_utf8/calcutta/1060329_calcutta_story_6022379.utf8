 Windfall has police on spend spree

 The police are facing an uphill task ? spending a whopping Rs 4 crore in a week flat. 

 The Centre?s allotment for modernisation of the force came barely a week before the financial year comes to an end ? the deadline for spending the amount ? leaving the top brass racing against time.

 More than half the amount will be spent procuring 400 motorcycles for all 48 police stations in Calcutta, and the rest will go towards buying gadgets like palmtops for traffic sergeants.

 ?We will have to show the expenditure by the last date of this month. Otherwise, the money will have to be sent back to Delhi,? said Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner of police (administration).

 The money has come under the Centre?s megacity development plan. Commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee and Singh went to Delhi a few months ago and submitted a proposal for modernising the force to finance ministry officials. ?The approval came suddenly,? said an officer at the Lalbazar headquarters.

 Justifying the move to buy so many motorcycles, Singh said the two-wheelers would help cops intensify vigil on roads. ?The police stations now have two motorcycles each. From April, they will have 10.?

 At present, ?a group of four to six cops patrols the area under its control in jeeps ? a waste of both manpower and time,? said an officer.

 Once the two-wheelers come, the cops in a thana will be divided into groups of two. ?Each group will be assigned an area, which it has to patrol on motorcycles. That will enhance the visibility of our men on streets,? the officer added.

 As for lanes and bylanes, the cops now do the patrolling on foot, which is why several of them remain beyond vigil. ?With the two-wheelers, almost all lanes will come under our watch,? Singh said. 

 The palmtops, he elaborated, will enable sergeants to record online the registration number of an offending vehicle and other details. This will make prosecution faster.

 The deadline has, however, forced the officers to abandon the plan of buying jammers for ensuring VVIPS have a safe ride. The suppliers have expressed the inability to provide the gadgets in just two days.

 Watercolours with weight

 - Surfaces 

 that reveal an unnoticed beauty in familiar things 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Abstract art is essentially non-figurative but it need not exclude references to the real world.

 Sheetal Gattani is a young, Mumbai-based artist whose works were being exhibited at Galerie 88. She builds up layered and textured surfaces that remind one of things one encounters all the time without ever noticing the beauty inherent in them. Our eyes are trained to ignore the obvious. 

 Blue is the dominant shade of a square and a rectangular work. But if one looks at these two carefully, one would realise that they resemble a tablet of indigo albeit enlarged with an iridescent blue surface that is in certain sections deep as midnight, and a lighter shade of ultramarine in others.

 Some of her works have uneven surfaces, like a mottled rock face or pumice stone. Veins run through these, giving the impression of an encrustation of various layers of solidified salts.

 A grey shadow partially covers the surface while flecks of blue sparkle all over. It could be the shell of a birds egg.

 A dark surface has undertones of ochre like a shadow with sudden eruptions of cobalt blue. A stretch of light ochre is smudged with brown. A large square of red is shaded with grey and with crackles of blue. Even when Gattani chooses a bright shade like red the canvas has a matt and muted surface.

 Sometimes, it looks as if the paint has chipped off to reveal a darker shade underneath. A stretch of cream and gray is defined by triangular formations of white, like the fanciful forms created on walls by rising damp.

 The most startling thing about these rather large works is that Gattani has used water colour all along to paint them. Had not one been told, one would never have guessed that she has used a medium that is more often than not associated with transparency and lightness.

 One must say this is quite a technical feat on the part of the artist. And to think that she has used paper and not canvas and has yet been able to convey a great sense of density and weight.

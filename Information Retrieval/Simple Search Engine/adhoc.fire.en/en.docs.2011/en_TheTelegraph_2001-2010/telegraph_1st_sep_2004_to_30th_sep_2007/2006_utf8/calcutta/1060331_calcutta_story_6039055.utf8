 Lone crusader: Yeasin 

 Pathan in front of the temples he helped restore in 

 Pathra village, West Midnapore. Picture by Pabitra Das 

 A young woman?s dream of living 

 independently was shattered by her father?s insistence on 

 getting her married against her will (Suicide by reluctant 

 bride, March 2). It is ironical that her determination not 

 to be a burden on her family led to her death. 

 The girl was educated and wanted to become a teacher. With encouragement from her family members, she could have moved ahead with confidence and fulfilled her heart?s desire. Moreover, she could even have have supported her family later. 

 Once children grow up, parents and guardians should not force them to do things they do not want to do. The grown-ups should patiently try to understand the problems faced by the youngsters and if necessary, gently persuade them to change their views. On no condition, should the guardians resort to coercion. Putting pressure on young minds often has adverse effects, but very few parents understand that. 

 The society has changed and so have the needs of children. The safety valves that the previous generations enjoyed are no longer there. Everyone needs to adapt, otherwise they will make their lives and those of people around them miserable. 

 Social organisations should organise seminars from time to time for counselling parents. They should be made aware of the changes in society and how to tackle situations judiciously. Children need to be told about their role in maintaining family peace. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Shrines restored, saviour a wreck?, March 7, kudos for highlighting the struggle of Md Yeasin Pathan to save the crumbling temples. He has not let poverty, abuse and lack of help bog him down. 

 The selfless service rendered by Pathan reminded me of Gopal Patra and Ajit Guha. While Patra, a cancer-afflicted teacher in a Midnapore village, used to spend his meagre income on social service, Guha, a homeguard, returned a bag containing lakhs of rupees to its owner. 

 Instead of idolising rich, selfish filmstars and cricketers, children should model their lives on glamourless but great men like Pathan, Patra and Guha. 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur. 

 Pathan has devoted 33 years of 

 his life to save some temples that nobody else cares about. 

 What is most pathetic is that his lone efforts have faced 

 opposition at every step. Pathan?s dedication, devotion, 

 determination, patience and selflessness is a lesson for 

 the young generation. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 One only hopes that Calcutta University will be able to make fruitful use of the Rs 100-crore grant it is set to receive from the Centre (Budget boost for research, March 1). According to the plan, the bulk of the money will be used to conduct research. 

 The university administration should also pay attention to updating and overhauling the infrastructure for better education service. Sufficient attention should also be paid to training of university personnel. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

 Apropos the reports ?Silver lining in arthritis treatment?, March 6, and ?Plastic insert puts spring back in knees?, March 7, I am a arthritis patient for the past two years. I attended a seminar organised by the recently-formed West Bengal Anthroplasty Society at GD Birla Sabhagar on March 5. It was informative and useful though long speeches by some doctors put off some members of the audience. 

 R.C. Dey, 

 Parnashree . 

 Apropos the report ?Of big cat and habitat?, March 3, as a lover of animals, birds and reptiles, I would like to compliment Sangita Mitra and Tanmoy Chaudhury for writing Trails of the Tiger. The villagers living around the reserves must be motivated to protect the tiger. 

 One of the reasons behind poaching is the demand for tiger teeth, bones and skin. A kilogram of tiger bone is sold for Rs 10,000 in Hong Kong and Singapore. 

 Conservationists like Valmik Thapar 

 have been trying their best to protect the species, but 

 in spite of their efforts, the situation is pathetic in 

 several tiger reserves across the country. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 It is ironical that while we celebrate the International Women?s Day every year, we are turning a blind eye to the plight of women in Calcutta (Rape alleged in hospital, March 6). Leave alone the streets, even the hospitals are no longer safe for women. The alleged rape of a woman at Medical College and Hospital proves once again that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ?oasis of peace? is turning out to be a haven for criminals. The matter should be dealt with seriously and exemplary punishment should be meted out to the guilty. 

 Abhishek Law,

 Bidhan Sarani. 

 We are sometimes forced to wonder 

 whether we are living in a civilised society or not. It 

 certainly does not appear so from the way women are being 

 raped even in hospitals. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata. 

 Apropos ?Beef-up at hospital?, 

 March 8, it is ridiculous that the authorities of Medical 

 College and Hospital have bolstered security after 

 a woman was raped by an attendant?s son on the premises. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge. 

 Perhaps there aren?t strong enough 

 words to condemn the rape of a woman on the premises of 

 Medical College and Hospital. The lackadaiscal attitude 

 of the administration has emboldened the unauthorised people 

 living on the compound. They should have been evicted long 

 back. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 It is sad that despite all the 

 progress they have made, women remain unsafe in Calcutta. 

 R. Baboo, 

 Bhadrakali, Hooghly. 

 Apropos the report ?Penury shadow on 11-year-old champ?, March 1, Subir Shah?s will power and his school?s support have brought glory for Bengal. The government?s help can propel the poor gymnast to greater heights. 

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park. 

 It is good that the authorities of Victoria Memorial have initiated a move to beautify the garden and make it more secure (Higher green sprawl for Memorial, March 8). This will attract more visitors. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake.

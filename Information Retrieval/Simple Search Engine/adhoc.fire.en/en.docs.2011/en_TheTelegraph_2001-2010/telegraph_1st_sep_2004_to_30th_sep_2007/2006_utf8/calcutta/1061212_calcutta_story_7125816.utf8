 Mystery of missing cops

 On Sunday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted that his police were not friendly to the people. What he could also have mentioned was that some in the force lacked a sense of duty, too.

 A perfect example of the lapse is the absence of cops in several kiosks that were set up in all police stations areas more than a year ago.

 The kiosks are located on important roads and at busy crossings. Cops are supposed to be stationed there round-the-clock to provide help and assistance to the public.

 But most of the kiosks remain closed at night. And even during daytime, several are found to be empty. 

 Metro spotted two such kiosks that make a mockery of the much-hyped 24x7 policing in the city.

 Where: Fairlie 

 Place, on Strand Road

 When: 

 9 pm

 Police station: 

 Hare Street

 What we saw: 

 Dark and deserted kiosk on a desolate street. The lights 

 are switched off and a big lock hangs on the door. Cops 

 are nowhere to be found. 

 Thanaspeak: 

 The officers at the police station do not seem to be bothered 

 about the missing cops. We cannot always send officers 

 to the kiosks because of shortage of manpower. At times, 

 there are important programmes, where we have to send most 

 of our men, says a sub-inspector of Hare Street police 

 station. 

 Commuterspeak: 

 The area becomes deserted after sundown and we feel insecure 

 while returning home. The closed kiosk makes a mockery of 

 the police claim that they are always by our side, says 

 a railway employee. 

 Where: 

 Strand Road, near the River Traffic Police jetty

 When: 

 9.30 pm

 Police station: 

 Maidan

 What we saw: 

 Hordes of commuters are on their way back home, but the 

 kiosk is locked. Police deployment is very errant, says 

 the owner of a neighbourhood tea stall. 

 Thanaspeak: Officers 

 of Maidan police station do not have any clue about the 

 missing cops. We send our people every day to man the kiosk, 

 claims an officer of the police station.

 Commuterspeak: 

 Whats the use of setting up the kiosk if it remains under 

 lock and key, says a trader who uses the stretch every 

 evening to return home in Howrah.

 Exciting casinos, brilliant skyline, 

 leisure shopping and of course the breathtaking Petronas 

 Twin Towers. The coral islands, cool hill stations and the 

 long white coastline all add to the myriad charms of Malaysia.

 And all these attractions now 

 come free for new Happy Club members. Calcutta?s ?first 

 and only virtual club? is offering every new member a free 

 return ticket to Kuala Lumpur.

 The international summer trip 

 for the new members entails a detailed itinerary of travel, 

 clearly marked guides of places to visit, shop and eat at 

 when in Malaysia, according to Happy Club officials. While 

 the free ticket is for the new member, the virtual club 

 helps arrange the journey and trip for friends or family 

 the member wishes to travel with.

 From the ancient Hindu shrine, 

 the Sri Maha Mariamma Temple, to the night market at Chinatown 

 for great bargains, dinner at Seri Melayu restaurant with 

 a cultural dance performance or a photo stop at Petronas 

 Towers make Kuala Lumpur ?an amazing first experience?.

 The stunning modern site of the 

 KL Tower, 421m high and the tallest telecommunication tower 

 in Asia, makes a fascinating contrast with the local flavour 

 of food and culture.

 ?We have always offered our members 

 something extra and Happy members can expect lots of more 

 exciting and innovative offers in future. Malaysia is the 

 first international travel gift for Calcutta,? says Sushil 

 Poddar, chairman of the Happy Group.

 The membership package, which 

 comes for Rs 15,678, offers a ?whole new range of virtual 

 clubbing facilities? besides the free return ticket to KL, 

 stresses Poddar.

 Happy members get free access 

 to modern health and fitness centres at HHI, Bodyline, Ordnance 

 Club and the Salt Lake Swimming Pool. The club is also offering 

 special privilege at the restaurants at Marine Club, Royal 

 Calcutta Turf Club and lodging facilities at Hindusthan 

 Club and Bengal Club.

 A free Citibank credit card, unlimited 

 entry to Nicco Park, Swabhumi and Aquatica are some of the 

 other benefits in the basket. Members also enjoy club facilities 

 elsewhere in the country and abroad through reciprocal arrangements 

 with various institutions Happy Club has entered into, the 

 management claims.

 Some of the clubs where such reciprocal 

 arrangements hold are The Country Club, International, 

 Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai and the Royal 

 Overseas League, London.

 The Family Club (Thane) Mumbai, 

 Darjeeling Gymkhana Club, India Tennis Centre, New Delhi, 

 Chennai, Corporate Club amp; Lamicale Club amp; Resort 

 Pvt Ltd, Chennai, and Greenfield (I) Pvt Ltd, Pune are a 

 few more addresses where Happy Club members can enjoy the 

 facilities.

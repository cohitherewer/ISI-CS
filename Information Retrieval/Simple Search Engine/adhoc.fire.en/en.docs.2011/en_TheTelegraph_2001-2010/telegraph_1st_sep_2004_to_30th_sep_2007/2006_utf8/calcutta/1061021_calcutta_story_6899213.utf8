 A moment from Medea

 Adultery leading to violence in mythical lore and ritualism in style form the common features in two recent productions. In Bali, Girish Karnad dramatises the ancient conflict between Hindu animal sacrifice and Jain ahimsa through the penance that a Jain queen must undergo for her liaison with the kings mahout. Her mother-in-law believes in blood sacrifice whereas the royal couple practices non-violence. There lie obvious parallels in contemporary Indian religion and politics that Karnad wants us to register.

Maniraths version of Bali luxuriates in the 

ritual symbolism that director Santanu Bose favours. He chose the intimate studio 

venue of Padatiks inner theatre to magnify this, along with the usual accessories 

signifying ceremonial performance: water to cleanse oneself with, flower petals, 

flames.

 He heightens the presentational quality by himself acting the queen mother as a gaunt, pitiless, masculine figure, and by employing two men to share the kings part. Debika Sinha portrays the queens turmoil more naturalistically.

 But forcing the cast to use English was a wrong directorial decision, for their accents merely expose their discomfort with the language. Likewise, Bose gains nothing from the continuous live camera feed of the show because it soon tires us by not offering particularly different perspectives.

 At Max Mueller Bhavan, Aarshi staged Medea, adapted from the plays by Euripides and Heiner Mueller. Here too we have an archetypal myth about infidelity and vengeance, rather than penitence, through violent sacrifice, by the wronged woman of her family. Abanti Chakrobarty scripted and directed it in a compact retelling involving just three performers. 

 She herself plays a vulnerable Medea, who mostly narrates her terrible story, initially rationalising her situation, while Tapan Das represents Jason mainly through physical movement and martial postures, and Manisha Adak handles the rest.

 The ritualistic element emerges in the stylised, semi-dance idiom and the frontal confessional mode.

However, by editing the length drastically, Chakrobarty 

falls short of the tragic heights attained in Euripidess original; nor does she 

express the overt anti-colonialism in Muellers trilogy. The music, by 21 Grams, 

adds a novel touch.

Ashoknagar Nattyamukhs presentation Natya Football 

Shokal at the Academy of Fine Arts on October 8 was commendable for its attempt 

to trace a less noticed thematic continuity in Bengali theatre and throw it up 

for discussion. The Calcutta stage, after all, has repeatedly drawn parallels 

between football and society. 

 The young group not only presented two plays on football Bratya Basus Operation 2010 and Raja Guhas Football but also arranged for the felicitation of some soccer stars and theatre veterans like Rudraprasad Sengupta, Bibhas Chakraborty, Manoj Mitra and Raja Guha, all of whom have presented plays on the game. While Sengupta had adapted Peter Tersons Jigger Jagger into the popular Football for Nandikar, Chakraborty had directed Manoj Mitras play Atmagopon for Anya Theatre. Raja Guha had also scripted and directed a Football, staged on the same day for the 500th time.

 Mitra was all praise for the novelty of the concept: It was natural for the social order to be reflected in the game and for the game to find references in plays. The plays brought into focus certainly provide different insights into society and the times.

If Nandikars Football had presented the game 

as a craze, a meaningless frenzy with shouting brigades, youths running with daggers 

and flags, a girl eloping with a football star, Anya Theatres Atmagopan compared 

it to the stock market. A kidnapped football star and a broker in hiding are shown 

as tools of an inhuman world of buying and selling.

Operation 2010,a short play by Bratya Basu, works 

through a brisk montage of realistic and surrealistic images. The production directed 

by Avi Chakraborty certainly lacked polish but the actors more than made up for 

it.

 In focus is a committee comprising a sports authority representative, a journalist, a corporate sponsor and others, who between endless meals watch cricket and put forward absurd self-serving proposals for an Indian World Cup victory. 

 Gatecrashing into this ivory tower is a former footballer with the personal problem of a son who loves the game in an indifferent world. The final scene where we see the youngster kicking a ball into the net which here acts as a metaphor for the hurdles in the way of honest endeavour and the former footballers frustration as his voice drowns in meaningless clamour leave a lasting impact.

 Raja Guhas Football, presented by Kalpurush, seemed a little dated and the attention wavered. But football here is not just a game. It is seen as an expression of the man on the streets. Players are representatives of the masses and cannot betray their hopes and loyalties at any cost.

 A player dressed in a red tracksuit and his brother-cum-coach brave mafia threats and walk out armed with a football at the end of the play.

 Film-maker Roman Polanski is returning to the stage in Berlin this winter with the revived Dance of the Vampires. The popular musical, staged in various countries, was inspired by the film The Fearless Vampire Killers, which Polanski had directed in 1967. The French director of Polish origin, who won an Academy Award for The Pianist, had also directed the German version of the musical in 2002.

 Dance of the Vampires is the story of scientific researcher Abronsius who steps into an inn to find lots of garlic strewn around. Recognising these it as a sure sign of the vampire, he sets out with assistant Alfred on a journey to crack the mystery.

 Tanz der Vampire Das Grusical, the German version, will premiere in Berlin on December 10 at Theater des Westens.

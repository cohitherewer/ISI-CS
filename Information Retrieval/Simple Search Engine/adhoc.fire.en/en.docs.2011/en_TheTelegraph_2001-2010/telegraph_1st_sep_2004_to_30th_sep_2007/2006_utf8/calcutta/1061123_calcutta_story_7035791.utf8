The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crusade to unveil facts

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Magsaysay award-winner Arvind Kejriwal (PTI)

 Magsaysay award-winner Arvind Kejriwal has been running across the country with a mission to empower oppressed citizens with the Right to Information Act (RTI), the most powerful law legislated in the past 55 years.

 In town early this week, the 35-year-old former Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer expressed shock over the progress of the RTI movement in Bengal. Drawing comparison with other states, where quite a few officers have been penalised for violating the act, Kejriwal rued that in Bengal, government servants deliberately flouting the law are going scot-free.

 Metro has recently reported that the state RTI commission had to suspend hearings barely 10 months after it was set up for lack of infrastructure and poor and often erroneous flow of information from the government.

 Bihar, Kejriwal pointed out, is putting in place the most advanced system of RTI implementation. The government there will soon introduce a tolled phone service to register complaints under the act. The fee for registering the complaint will be included in the telephone bill of the caller.

 He also lauded the performance of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Several senior officers have been punished in these states for refusing to part with information. In Gujarat alone, more than seven officers have been penalised.

 Kejriwal, who won the Magsaysay award in 2006 for emergent leadership qualities, started forming select groups since 2000 to help people get information from the government. The movement got a boost in June last year, when the RTI bill was passed in Parliament.

 In the past 55 years, the common people have never got such a powerful law that can even force the government to change its policies, he said.

 Talking about his past, he said: I was happy with my IRS job. But at the same time, I came across instances of common people being harassed and denied the most basic information. So, I decided to do something for them.

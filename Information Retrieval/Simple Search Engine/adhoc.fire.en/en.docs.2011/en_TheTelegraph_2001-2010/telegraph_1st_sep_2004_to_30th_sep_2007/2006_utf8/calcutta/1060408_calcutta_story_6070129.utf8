 Shock, denial, guilt, depression? Knowledge of infertility, or the failure to produce a baby, often triggers one or all of these emotions.

 Infertility today is a global phenomenon, with eight to 10 per cent of couples having some kind of fertility-related problems, according to WHO estimates. ?In Calcutta, we have seen 10-15 per cent of couples who try to conceive, fail to do so,? says Rohit Gutgutia, IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) coordinator at ?Genome? the Fertility Clinic?.

 Set up by the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman amp; Child Care Centre in association with Herzliya Medical Centre (HMC), Israel, regarded among the top 10 centres in the world in infertility treatment, Genome promises the complete gamut of latest assisted reproduction solutions under one roof.

 The ?first-of-its-kind-in eastern India? Rawdon Street centre offers a holistic approach in addressing infertility in a ?personalised and professional manner? ? from diagnosing the problem to tackling the ?valuable pregnancies? at the specially-equipped obstetrics department and the linked neonatal ICU.

 By the terms of the collaboration, HMC will help in technology transfer, manpower training and infrastructure, besides conducting routine inspections. ?At Genome, we appreciate that the dream to have a family is universal,? says Madhu Neotia, director.

 The aim of Genome is three-fold: to provide high-quality woman?s healthcare focusing on the patient and the partner, address specialised reproductive healthcare needs of women and provide ?advanced, innovative, high-value? fertility care in a nurturing environment.

 The centre had its entire staff trained at HMC for five months, under the supervision of ?top infertility experts? and all the equipment at its state-of-the-art lab has been imported in compliance with specifications given by the Israeli major.

 Of the 50 to 80 million people in the world who suffer from infertility, 51.2 per cent is due to male factors, 20 per cent unexplained and the rest due to female factors, according to Gutgutia. ?In a lopsided society like ours, we tend to treat infertility and the female as synonymous. But today, infertility is more a man?s than a woman?s problem,? says Neotia.

 Genome has started an Andrology Clinic under Arnab Krishna Deb to address the critical issue of male infertility, which affects one out of 25 men in India. Blockage in sperm-carrying tubes, testicular injury or disease, genetic disorder, hormonal imbalances, environmental toxins and radiation are some of the common factors contributing to male infertility.

 Female-related infertility results from disease, anatomical problems, age and hormonal imbalances affecting the menstrual cycle, according to experts at the centre. 

 ?Ours is not a doctor-driven centre and the treatment is system-based. Teamwork is vital and everybody?s area of speciality is clearly defined,? Gutgutia stresses.

 Apart from the relatively common IUI (intra-uterine insemination) and IVF (in-vitro fertilisation), Genome offers some of the latest assisted-reproduction techniques like ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection), MESA (microscopic epididymal sperm aspiration) and PESA (percutaneous sperm aspiration).

 Besides offering counselling for the extended family of the patient, the clinic is also planning ?information evenings? where doctors will answer all sorts of queries. ?The idea is to clear misconceptions through accurate information dissemination,? says a spokesperson for the clinic.

 Genome has tied up with HSBC with a ?unique financing offer? to enable easy repayment of treatment costs.

 The Bengal school of art has come a long way since its inception a hundred years ago, surviving periods of ups and downs in profile, popularity and patronage, at the same time undergoing slow but steady transformation. The ongoing exhibition, Tradition amp; Continuity in the Bengal School of Painting, bears excellent witness to the evolution of this style of art. Comprising works by early 20th century masters, as well as by artists of succeeding generations till the present day, it traces the distinctive attitudes of each age in Indian history from colonial times, which influenced the development of different artistic techniques. The paintings vividly illustrate how the Bengal school transformed from its formative days, with its combination of the elegance of Mughal miniatures with the delicate nuances of Japanese ?wash? method to its modern expressions of visual creativity, while remaining faithful to its basic principle. Featuring the works of Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee, Jamini Ray, Hirendranath Dutta and Ganesh Pyne (traditonal); Arunanva Bhattacharya, Avijit Mullick, Partha Dey, Rajarshi Adhikary and Souradip Saha (modern), among others.

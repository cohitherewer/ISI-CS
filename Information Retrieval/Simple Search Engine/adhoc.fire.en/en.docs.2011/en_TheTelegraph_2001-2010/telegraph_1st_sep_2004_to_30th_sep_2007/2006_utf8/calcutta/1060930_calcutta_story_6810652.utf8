 At Sarsuna Upanagari Sarbojanin, the grand pandal bordering Sarsuna College, had to be dismantled because of the end-September showers and shifted to the safer confines of the college hall. 

 But that didnt dampen the Saptami celebrations, with Behala residents and outsiders flocking to the popular puja. This is the true spirit of Durga puja, smiled an organiser.

 Rain or shine, the Puja spirit marches on. Literally. Most pandal-hoppers are coming well-armed with umbrellas and raincoats, pointed out Bikash Mazumdar at a crowded College Square on Saptami afternoon. And the sky, too, seems to be clearing.

 This is one time of the year when the Calcuttan spies the silver lining instead of the dark cloud. And the Met officials at Alipore were no exception. The situation will be better on Saturday, though we expect light to moderate rain in Calcutta and the rest of Gangetic Bengal in the next 24 hours, said J.V.M. Naidu, deputy director general at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

 The city received 14.6 mm of rain between 2.30 pm on Thursday and 2.30 pm on Friday, but the depression formed over the Bay of Bengal on Sashthi afternoon had crossed over to Orissa by Saptami evening.

 Good news for all those with elaborate Ashtami plans. Not that the Saptami rain could disrupt pandal-hopping. People hit the roads as soon as the rain stopped, said Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). As a result, there was a traffic congestion in some pockets.

 The car crawl or the intermittent 

 rain could not play spoilsport as pandal-hoppers paused 

 for shelter and then carried on. Nothing can stop us from 

 pandal-hopping. And even the weather gods seem to be saluting 

 our festive spirit, smiled a family at Ahiritola.

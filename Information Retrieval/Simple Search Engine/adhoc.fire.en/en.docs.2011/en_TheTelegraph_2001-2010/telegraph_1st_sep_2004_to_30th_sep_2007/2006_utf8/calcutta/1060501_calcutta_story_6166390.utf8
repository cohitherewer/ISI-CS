 OUR BUREAU

 A city-based executive of Pepsico drowned in the swimming pool of the upscale Trident Hilton hotel in Bhubaneswar on Sunday. He was in Orissa on work.

 Aveek Mandal, 34, general manager of the company, had been swimming in the pool since the morning. Around 10.45 am, some employees of the hotel saw Mandal struggling to stay afloat.

 ?He was flailing his arms in the water. The waiters and security guard pulled him out. He was taken to Kalinga Hospital. But by then, he had died,? said Manish Kumar, manager of Trident Hilton.

 Mandal, a resident of Merlin Grove Apartments in Thakurpukur, checked into room no. 121 of the hotel on April 25. 

 Looking after Pepsico?s operations in Chhattisgarh and Orissa was part of his responsibilities, and hence, he visited the company?s Jagatpur plant, in Cuttack, quite often. He was scheduled to check out on Monday.

 During his stay, Mandal used to swim in the hotel pool every morning. Sunday was no different.

 South 24-Parganas police superintendent S.N. Gupta said on Sunday night that Pepsico officials had informed him about the ?tragic incident?.

 ?Mandal was married and is survived by his wife and a three-year-old child. I have promised all possible help to the bereaved family,? he added. 

 Debendra Panda, who attended to Mandal in Kalinga Hospital, said he was ?brought dead?. Based on Panda?s report, Nayapalli police registered a case and have started investigations.

 ?We have found out that Mandal was swimming in the deepest end of the pool. The depth of the water is about eight ft there. It is quite possible that he drowned,? said Jatin Panda, sub-inspector of Nayapalli police station. 

 According to the cop, the doctors didn?t find any evidence to suggest that Mandal had taken drugs or drunk alcohol before entering the water.

 The hotel management did not know whether Mandal knew how to swim or not, but confirmed that the manager used to hit the swimming pool every time he checked into the hotel.

 After the post-mortem, the body was handed over to Pepsico?s chief in Orissa K. Alexander.

 The company officials later brought the body to Calcutta by road. They reached in the evening.

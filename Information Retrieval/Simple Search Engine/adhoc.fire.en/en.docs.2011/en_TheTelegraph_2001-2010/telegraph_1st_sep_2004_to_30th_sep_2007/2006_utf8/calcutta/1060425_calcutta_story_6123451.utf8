 Blend it right

 HOUSE 

 PROUD

 Antique furniture with 

 modern wall effects or a sleek sofa with old wooden flooring 

 mix the classic and the contemporary harmoniously. 

 Riddhima Seal tells you how 

 You pride yourself on your collection 

 of antique furniture, a host of valuable paintings and bronze 

 figurines. Every corner of your house spells out class. 

 On the other hand, you have also been longing for the contemporary 

 range of plush leather sofas, sleek and stylish ceramic 

 and glass vases and those too-good-to-let-go wall effects 

 for your home.

 The seemingly impossible task 

 at hand now is to blend the classic and the contemporary 

 looks harmoniously. The most important thing one needs 

 to keep in mind while blending the two looks is the right 

 sense of balance. Be it in the straight clean furniture 

 lines, the seating arrangements, the colour co-ordination 

 or even something as simple as a flower arrangement, 

 says designer Anita Mansata.

 GoodLife tells you how 

 to marry the two apparently contrasting looks.

 Room rules

 The best area to mix the two styles 

 is the living room. Blending the two always works 

 best in the living area because here you get ample space 

 to experiment, suggests Anita. She recommends a mix 

 and match of the two types of furniture ? a collection of 

 wooden chairs reflecting the classic on one hand and a light-hued 

 large plush leather sofa on the other.

 Accessorising the place 

 is where the trick lies. Place bright coloured ethnic cushions 

 done with sequins and zari work on your sofa set. 

 The traditional chairs can, on the other hand, have cushions 

 in solid colours with geometrical designs on them, 

 says interior designer Pooja Chitlangia.

 The designers recommend natural 

 timber flooring for the living room. For the upholstery, 

 Anita suggests light-coloured natural fabric curtains. This 

 allows enough light and air into the room. And natural light 

 will enhance the smooth blend, she says.

 Your coffee table can be an interesting 

 mix of glass top and wooden base. A distinct feature 

 of the classic feel is the wooden look. And glass being 

 very stylish gives it the perfectly contemporary look. You 

 can top it up with a collection of pots and snooker balls 

 piled in a pedestal bowl. Grouping collections always makes 

 for a better impact than displaying individual pieces, 

 says Anita.

 For the bedrooms, stick to the 

 clean and pristine look with very little grandeur, particularly 

 if you have this huge antique bed and wardrobe. It is best 

 not to tamper with the furniture in this area while trying 

 to blend the two styles. One should rather play around with 

 accessories, feel designers. 

 You can also play around with 

 the lighting effects, using lots of contemporary shades 

 ? Chinese lanterns and long, oval, coloured holders. 

 Lights for your bedroom 

 are best kept a little toned down. This gives a more personal 

 touch to the room. Your bedside tables could hold shiny 

 black lampshades alongside stainless steel flower vases, 

 says Pooja. 

 Wall wows

 The blend always works best 

 against a backdrop of toned-down hues, says Anita. 

 And hence using neutral tones is a good idea, especially 

 in the drawing room.

 If there is a wall between your 

 dining and living room area, a good option is to carve out 

 a portion of the wall. You can place a combination of modern 

 sleek showpieces and vases and antique figurines in the 

 niche.

 Modern wall effects are best suited 

 for the bedroom. Wall effects are contemporary, but 

 with the kind of things in vogue now, the antique look is 

 easily acquired with gold prints on the walls, says 

 Pooja. 

 These effects go well on the wall 

 behind the headboard of the bed. Pooja recommends a deep 

 red with little gold prints. The other walls of the room 

 should, however, be a little toned down.

 If there is an empty wall 

 in your bedroom, it is a good idea to put up photographs 

 of family and friends in sepia-tones or black-and-white, 

 feels Anita. 

 The idea of doing up a portion 

 of the wall with photographs is very contemporary, while 

 the black-and-white effect would go a long way in rendering 

 the classic look, she adds. 

 Eye appeal

 Alongside furniture, it 

 is also about mixing the right add-ons to make your home 

 come alive. A ceramic glass vase, a coloured designer lampshade 

 and a conch shell can sit side by side elegantly, 

 feels Mansata. 

 owers ? fresh, artificial or dry 

 ? also help bring out this blended look to a great extent. 

 It is best to place fresh flowers 

 in coloured glass vases on the corner tables in the living 

 room. Dry and artificial flower sticks in slender ceramic 

 vases work best on wooden floor cabinets and cupboards. 

 A good idea is to have floating marigolds in ceramic black 

 pots at the entrance. 

 Paintings, murals, masks 

 and figurines on the wall also play a very important role 

 in rendering further character to this look. Being able 

 to choose them carefully is where the trick lies, 

 feels Anita. 

 Shower style

 You can even carry this blended 

 look into the shower rooms subtly. Anita suggests placing 

 modern fittings like coloured glass basins against an antique 

 ornate gold-framed mirror. Marble flooring will also enhance 

 the classic look. 

 On the other hand, you could keep 

 your old-world fittings and furniture intact and usher in 

 the mixed look by incorporating leather and glass tiles 

 for the floor and the walls. 

 Round it off with a neat touch 

 by placing a wrought iron chair, if you have a largish shower 

 area, to hold the guest towels.

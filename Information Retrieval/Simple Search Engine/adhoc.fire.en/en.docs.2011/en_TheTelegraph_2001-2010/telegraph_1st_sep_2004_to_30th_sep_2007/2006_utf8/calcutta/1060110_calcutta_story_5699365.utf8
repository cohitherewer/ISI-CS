 The great Indian wedding just seems to be getting greater with each passing season. More parties, never-ending guest lists, newly-acquired rituals from across the country ? the line-up gets more elaborate by the day.

 Sounds exciting for the extended family and friends, but it sure adds to the young brides what-should-I-wear worries like nothing else can. It is, after all, the most special week of her life. Putting together ensembles that are trendy and glamorous, yet as distinctive as possible sure can be quite a task.

 So heres the GoodLife guide to help her decide the right look for each of her special days ? the engagement, sangeet and D-day.

 Engagement

 The first to kickstart a series of dramatic events, this is the right time for the bride to present the perfect image. This could well be the first time she meets most of the grooms family and friends and hence the need to make a striking first impression.

 A delicate lehnga is what designer Jyoti Khaitan recommends for this occasion, though it neednt be extremely traditional and ornate. Leaving the zardosi and heavy maal ka kaam for the later functions, it is best to play around with crystal and interesting embellishments. 

 The colour story on this day, too, can be non-bridal. Choose from lavenders, powder blues or pretty yellows. Jyoti also suggests draping the dupatta stylishly. Since it is not compulsory to cover the head, you can be innovative with the draping, showcasing the embellishments to greatest effect, she says.

 The jewellery also need not be over the top at the engagement and the make-up is best kept subtle. Keep the foundation light and highlight your eyes with hues that complement your outfit, advises make-up expert Aniruddha Chakladar.

 The hair, he says, should either be straightened or curled lightly with tongs. Basically, the look is extremely soft and casual, adds Aniruddha. 

 Sangeet

 Whatever community the couple might belong to, the sangeet soiree has become a must in almost all weddings today. A function less and a rocking party more, the bash sometimes carries on all night long. A good idea is to give the lehngas a break and opt for a sari instead. This is the day when the bride can go unconventional with her looks. The creation she opts for should lend a festive and vibrant feel to complement the liveliness of the evening, feels Jyoti.

 Non-traditional, happy hues make an exciting colour palette for this evening. Introduce brooches and pendants in the drape of the sari itself to make for eye-catching details, says Jyoti. 

 The make-up for this function also takes a dramatic turn. Keep the base light since lots of dancing and long hours under the camera flash can make it run, but attract attention by shifting focus to your eyes. Add colour to your face by playing up your eyes. You can also try the smoky look and introduce some shimmer to it, explains Aniruddha. A glossy mouth and accentuated cheekbones complete the pretty picture.

 According to Aniruddha, hair set in rollers and tied partially looks great. You can also tie a colourful parandi on your tresses. 

 Wedding

 The look for this day is nothing but classic and traditional, says Jyoti, who feels that short-lived trends and fads are best kept out of the D-day attire. The bridal outfit should spell timeless appeal that never goes out of fashion. And the colours should be essentially the Indian bridal hues ? shades of red and orange, adds Jyoti.

 The embellishments are very intricate and ethnic, be it a wide jaal of zardosi or semi-precious rubies and sapphires crafted into the silver and gold work of the ensemble.

 Since there is already so much colour on the lehnga and jewellery, it is best to give her a balanced look for the face, feels Aniruddha. His advice is to highlight the features with the help of golden or bronze shades only. 

 Neutral make-up looks best on this day, but make it bright because a dull-looking face will ruin the entire effect of the day.

 The hair on the day of the marriage should always be tied up.

 A low jooda is the best bet because it facilitates the fall of the dupatta, adds the make-up man.

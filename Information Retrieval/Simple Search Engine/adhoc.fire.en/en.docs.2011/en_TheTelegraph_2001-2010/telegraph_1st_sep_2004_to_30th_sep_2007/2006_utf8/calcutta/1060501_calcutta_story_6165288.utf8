 From knives to needles

 - Murder convicts in Presidency jail excel in embroidery

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The hands that once took a life are now weaving magic.

 Mohammad Akram (name changed on request), serving a person term for killing a man a decade ago, has won the hearts of inmates and officers of Presidency jail by his chikan embroidery.

 And his is not a one-off case ? four others, one of them a murder convict like him, have proved their skills in needlework. 

 Throughout the day, they are into manual labour which forms part of their punishment, but start embroidery once they return to their cells.

 ?They are doing well. Their work has received appreciation from designers,? said an officer in the jail. The authorities are planning to approach prominent fashion designers in the city for marketing the convicts? art works.

 ?They are now working for small suppliers. But we want the designs to be displayed before a wider audience. Fashion designers may help organise exhibitions of the products,? said Kamal Mukherjee, superintendent of Presidency jail.

 The success of Akram and the four others is prompting more and more convicts to take up embroidery earnestly. 

 ?We are encouraged by the trend. Our work has an assured market, only it needs to be taken beyond the confines of the jail,? said a convict, preferring anonymity. 

 Jail officers, however, admit that direct sale of products made by the convicts will be difficult.

 ?A buyer will hesitate to buy a sari, no matter how beautifully it is embroidered, if she knows it bears the marks of a killer. That is the mindset of our society. So, we cannot disclose the identities of the convicts,? said an officer. 

 Abhishek Dutta, an upcoming fashion designer, welcomed the jail authorities? move. ?Of course, I will include the convicts? works in my collection. They are trying to come back to the mainstream and we should help them.? 

 Elaborating on how the skills of the convicts were tapped, a jail officer said: ?During a conversation, we came to know that some of the convicts had an interest in needlework. We asked them to embroider some handkerchieves. We were surprised on seeing the finished products. The designs and colour combination of threads were excellent.?

 The officers then collected some samples and sent them to small suppliers. ?We are sure if a person sees the works, he will be impressed,? said the officer.

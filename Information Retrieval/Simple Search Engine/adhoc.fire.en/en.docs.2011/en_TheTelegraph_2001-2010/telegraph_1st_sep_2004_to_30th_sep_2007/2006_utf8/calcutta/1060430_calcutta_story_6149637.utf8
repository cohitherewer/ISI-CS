 There?s a buzz about the Royal 

 Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) greens these days. Speak to club 

 loyalists or morning golfers and they tell you how the greens 

 should soon be the best in the club?s 175-year-old history.

 Subhro Saha spoke to golf 

 course architect Ranjit Nanda, who is anchoring the upgrade...

 On the need for an upgrade...

 The vast advancement in playing 

 equipment and in golf course maintenance and management 

 across the globe has necessitated the modernisation. It?s 

 a wonderful challenge to work on the world?s second oldest 

 golf course. The design brief from the club committee was 

 to upgrade RCGC to contemporary world standards in a phased 

 manner. 

 On the basic changes planned...

 We have looked at improvements 

 keeping the traditional character and basic layout intact. 

 There are some functional changes in the routing, in keeping 

 with contemporary golf course design requirements.

 Ideally, the starting and finishing 

 holes should be in close proximity to the clubhouse. For 

 this, there was a need to create a new hub for these main 

 functions so that the 1st tee, the 10th tee, the 9th and 

 18th greens as well as the practice area/practice greens 

 could be located as close to the golfing hub as possible.

 This necessitated planning a new 

 Starter Hut that would be the hub for the main golfing activities 

 and include all the functional aspects ? changing rooms, 

 lockers, refreshments, etc.

 There was a need to reduce the 

 walks from some greens to tees, especially from the old 

 1st green to the old 2nd tee. By creating a new no. 1 hole 

 from the new hub area and using land that was earlier lying 

 idle, a new strategic dogleg par 4 has been carved out. 

 This will result in a much shorter walk from the green to 

 the 2nd tees. Another change in this context was to revive 

 the old 2nd hole, an interesting par 3. This fits into the 

 scheme and flow of the routing nicely.

 On the benefits of the upgrade 

 effort...

 This would allow the much-needed 

 expansion of the existing main clubhouse building, especially 

 adding a new block for accommodation. Besides, there would 

 still be the flexibility to use the current 1st as an extra 

 starting hole, or an extra driving range or even for future 

 expansion. Moreover, the 18th green, in keeping with the 

 traditional finish, would continue to be in the same location, 

 in front of the old shamiana.

 On the technical improvements...

 Over the years, cow-grass, which 

 we consider a dangerous weed, had invaded the entire course, 

 overshadowing the dormant Bermuda below it. The priority 

 on the fairways was to get the Bermuda back and, accordingly, 

 take up removal of cow-grass from the central fairway strip. 

 This was started in 2005 and as it has proved successful, 

 the programme will be extended to the entire fairways during 

 2006. We should have the best fairways in the country in 

 the not too distant future.

 On the strategic changes...

 With the improvement in technology 

 in golf equipment, particularly clubs and balls, we found 

 that many of the hazards and waterbodies were not coming 

 into play. There was a need to improve hole strategy by 

 bringing some of the water tanks into play and also using 

 the same to improve drainage during the monsoons.

 The fairways at RCGC had heavy 

 soil underneath and became soggy and unplayable during the 

 monsoons. To overcome this, an aeration programme was teed 

 off in 2005 and the benefits of this will be evident in 

 a couple of seasons.

 When we analysed the greens, we 

 saw large-scale contamination with many different ?off-type? 

 grasses on each green. Maintaining these different grasses 

 was very difficult as each had its own peculiar growth habits 

 and as a result, there was a need to redesign and re-establish 

 newer, contemporary-standard hybrid turf grasses on the 

 greens.

 In order to have adequate quantity 

 of grass to transplant on to greens, tees and fairways, 

 nurseries had to be developed on the driving range, new 

 1st hole and the old 2nd hole. To showcase the proposed 

 new look of the golf course, a sample hole, the old 2nd 

 hole, was revived and planted with appropriate hybrid turf 

 grasses and the bunkers filled after installing drainage, 

 with the finest available white silica sand.

 These minimum standards are envisaged 

 during improvement of the course in future.

 When undertaking design studies 

 of the greens, we found that the contours of the green surrounds 

 were not blending with the greens or the existing fairway 

 slopes. These were also inconvenient to maintain with modern, 

 sophisticated ride-on turf grass machinery.

 In a classic traditional course 

 such as RCGC, we felt the need to re-establish bold flowing 

 contour lines in keeping with the scale of the course and 

 proper tie-in with surrounds. The golf holes needed some 

 framing with strategically placed bunkers and water hazards 

 and there was a need do get obsolete waterbodies more into 

 play.

 This is part of the long-term 

 up-grade plan of which 10 greens have been taken up in 2006. 

 The re-design of the greens, their sizes, slopes have been 

 considered keeping the challenge of various skill levels 

 as well as ease of future maintenance practices in mind.

 On whether upgrade will increase 

 the challenge...

 It is proposed that some of the 

 holes will be lengthened again for the sake of strategy 

 and challenge to the more skilled, champion-level players. 

 However, for the club-level golfer, who we consider the 

 backbone of the game, the design of the greens will provide 

 a larger target and continue to be as much part of the fun, 

 challenge and recreation they are looking for. For the better 

 player, there will be adequate ?risk-reward? opportunities 

 and the need for precision play.

 On how the upgraded RCGC course 

 will rate...

 The upgraded RCGC will emerge 

 as a truly top-ranked championship golf course in the region, 

 a status it deserves and we are hopeful this will happen 

 within the next couple of seasons.

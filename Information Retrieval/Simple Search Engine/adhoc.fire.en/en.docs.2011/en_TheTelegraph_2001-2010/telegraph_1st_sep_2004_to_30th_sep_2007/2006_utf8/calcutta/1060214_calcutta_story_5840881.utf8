The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Love day, party night

 - Hot spots line up 14 hours of revelry to keep tryst with Cupid

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 The fun begins in the afternoon and continues non-stop till dawn ? welcome to the longest party day of the year.

 As Cupid strikes Calcutta, nightclubs and lounges will throw open the revelry door nice and early on February 14. So, the Valentine?s Day spirit will flow for a full 14 hours at hot spots around town.

 If the first act is reserved for first-timers and teenyboppers, the big boys and girls will get into the act in the second.

 At Tantra, on Park Street, the console call is as early as 2 pm. ?The Valentine?s Day party is the longest of the year by the virtue of the crowds it draws. The early hours are packed with teenagers. They push off by 7 pm because they have to reach home in time,? says a Tantra spokesperson.

 ?Then, the place is taken over by the slightly older couples who drop in after the day?s work and stay on till late. And then there?s the regular party crowd. Our resident DJs will start the party on Tuesday and DJ Aqeel will take it to its climax,? she adds.

 At Shisha, where the party on any given day does not peak before midnight, DJ Girish will be turning the tables from 6 pm to 6 am. 

 ?Many couples would prefer coming into the lounge bar early in the evening for a relaxed and romantic time. As the night progresses, they would take to the dance floor,? says DJ Girish.

 Till even a couple of years ago, the V-Day party was hardly so long. ?The trend of Valentine?s Day bashes has really caught on this time,? feels Kanishka Mazumdar of Prince of Cal at Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion, which even hosted a pre-Valentine bash on Sunday from 11 am to 8 pm.

 If party time at Prince of Cal starts at 2 pm on Tuesday, B.E.D. and Underground follow suit from 4 pm.

 While the number of party hours will be one distinctive feature of February 14, the nature of the soundtrack will be the other. Hip-hop and House will take a back seat as mush rules on the day of romance.

 DJ Aqeel and DJ Kiran will churn out the latest Bollywood remixes at Tantra and B.E.D., while Abhijeet Sawant will sing old love songs at a private party in a Tollygunge bungalow.

 ?The DJs will have to carefully draw up the playlist to keep the tempo up for more than 12 hours. It will be romance all the way, with DJs digging out some old melodious tracks to match the milieu. The two tracks for the younger generation will be Tujhe dekha dekh and Aadat from the movie Kalyug. Remixed versions of Keh doon tumhein, Sajna hai mujhe, Quit playing games and Turn me on should go down well,? says DJ Akash.

 The sights at the nightclubs will match the sounds. From heart-shaped balloons to air tickets for exotic locations, the nightclubs will be dangling every carrot to lure the love crowd on V-Day. 

 ?There are loads of gifts for the best dressed and most romantic couples at Underground, to add to the excitement,? says Vinay Jaiswal of Hotel Hindusthan International.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 If football be the food of festivity

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The Berliner Weissebeer will flow 

 and piping hot Bulettens (the German equivalent of hamburgers) 

 will fly off the Alexandraplatz deli shelves on Friday before 

 hosts Germany clash with Argentina in the first quarterfinal 

 of the World Cup at Berlins Olympic Stadium.

 English fans camping in Dusseldorf or Cologne for their sides much-awaited last-eight clash against Portugal at Gelsenkirchens AufSchalke Arena will be gorging on Kasseler (smoked pork meat with sauerkraut) salad and dark bread made from corn granules typical of the Rhine valley, while gulping down the famous Kolsch beer of Cologne.

 With FIFA World Cup 2006 firing the imagination of Calcutta like never before, German cities, their typical sights and sounds, art and architecture in tow, have invaded our drawing rooms on the shoulders and bootlaces of Ronaldo and Beckham, Klose and Zidane.

 Given Calcuttas new-found penchant for Continental cuisine, its only a matter of time before the Deutschland delicacies like Crusty Pork Loin with Celery Sauerkraut or Roast Beef with German Apple Sauce find their way into our kitchens.

 We are as much passionate about our food as we are about our football. With Klinsmanns young squad doing much better than most people expected back home, its a carnival atmosphere in all the Cup cities and from beergartens to pubs and bars, boutique restaurants to sidewalk cafes, everybody is doing brisk business, says Wolfgang Altengurger.

 The German chef specialising in bakery and confectionery items is in town for the ongoing German food festival linked with the World Cup at the Taj Bengal, organised in collaboration with the German consulate general office.

 Chocolate chef Lothar Buss was here before Wolfgang for the same festival and hot chef Michael Sopper will follow.

 Wolfgang, who hails from the tiny village of Jestetten in the Black Forest area, swears by the ham and garlic salami of the region, devoured by football fans all over Germany. Of course, most of the World Cup cities would have its typical dishes. For instance, Berliners love their Landbrot, a mix between wheat and rye bread and their white beer, he smiles.

 Munich, on the other hand, loves its rye bread, white sausages made from calf meat with the quintessentially German Sauerkraut and Haxen, a dish prepared from pig legs.

 The stylish pubs and restobars in Munich also serve the popular Bavarian Meat Loaf Platter to go with the dark beer of the region, which football fans simply adore, Wolfgang points out.

 The Bavarian capital could host a titanic clash between Beckhams England and Ronaldinhos Brazil. But prior to that, the English must pip Portugal and Brazil has to foil France at the Waldstadion in Frankfurt, almost synonymous with its Frankfurter Sausages to go with the special apple wine.

 The fans drink a lot of beer to wash down the pretzels and sausages with potato salads available at the stadium food-stops. Those not fortunate enough to get into the stadiums, watch the game at nearby pubs and bars, with beer, the ubiquitous beverage, accompanied by Eisbergsalad, Kaptsalad or Grilled Onion Frankfurters, Roasted Potato and Sour Cream, the German chef says.

 If Ballack and his boys can upset Argentinas applecart in Berlin, the carnival moves to Dortmunds Westfalen Stadium for the semifinal. Besides Sauerteigbrote, a very tasty bread made from rye flour, fans will be greeted there by canapes and open sandwiches made from Pumpernickel, Bratwurst (grilled sausages), Sauerkraut Filo Turnovers and Rye Bread Crostini.

 While Stuttgart, set to play heartbreak hotel with its third-place playoff tie on Saturday week, is famous for its Spatzles and Pretzel Stickletti, Roasted Beef Kasseller Salad, Asparagus and Black Forest Ham, Broad Beans and Frankfurter Salad ? should all go down well after the match.

 Those venturing to the Taj spread can sample many of these Deutsch dishes like Roast Duck with Ragout of Forest Mushrooms, Sauteed Red Cabbage with Smoked Cheese and Pot Roast Potato with Creamy Sauerkraut and Red Onions, among other mouth-watering fare while the Cup shines.

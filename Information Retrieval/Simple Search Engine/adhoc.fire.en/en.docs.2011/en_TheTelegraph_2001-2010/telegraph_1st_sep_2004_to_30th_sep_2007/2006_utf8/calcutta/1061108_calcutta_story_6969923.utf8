The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Police to get new premises

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police stations located on rented premises will be shifted to buildings to be constructed by the force. The chief minister recently gave a go-ahead to the project, which is part of a modernisation drive.

 Our proposal has been accepted. We will soon have our own buildings, where the police stations located on rented properties will be shifted, additional commissioner S.N. Sarkar told Metro. 

 According to an officer, there are about 10 police stations on rented premises. Ultadanga and Gariahat police stations were shifted to buildings constructed by Calcutta Police this year. Tollygunge, Phoolbagan and Beleghata police stations are next in line. 

 About Rs 1.5 crore has been granted to construct a building that will house Tollygunge police station on the ground floor and the barracks above, said joint commissioner (administration) Kuldiep Singh. 

 According to him, acquiring land is a problem. We have earmarked some plots and talks are on to buy them. Since this is a big project, it will take time to implement, he added. 

 Last week, the force received a grant of Rs 10.5 crore from the Centre for modernisation. Over the past two years, the Union government has been releasing funds to Calcutta Police under the megacity scheme.

 An artiste?s soul can never be at peace in confinement. Nandipat?s latest production, Ramanimohan, unfolds the unfortunate fate of such an artiste, highlighting the plight of actors of yesteryears who, with total devotion to their profession, had kept spectators entertained with their histrionic skills. Compelled by age to quit acting, Ramanimohan, the play?s protagonist, now lives by cherishing fond memories of his past. He has also been forced by his son not to enact female roles, in which he was very proficient, as it made people think him to be a eunuch. Yet, when he gets a chance to be on stage again, Ramanimohan cannot resist the opportunity. His performance draws both praise and derisive laughter, but his son, furious with him, shuts him up in his house forever. And then, one day, he disappears, leaving behind all his possessions, awards and his precious costumes, which he wore while enthralling his audience and himself. Direction: Prakash Bhattacharya.

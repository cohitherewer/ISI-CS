 fun Factor: Sharman Joshi with Soha Ali Khan in Rang De Basanti

 You hated him as the spoilt son in Godmother. You laughed at him as the clever collegian in Style. Now, get ready to love Sharman Joshi as Sukhi in this week?s big release, Rang De Basanti.

 A commerce graduate, Sharman had been associated with commercial theatre from his college days. After being part of some very popular plays like Aame Layee Gaya Tamhe Rahi Gaya, it was Bollywood calling for the guy who claims to be ?not all that funny in real life?. A couple of offbeat films like Godmother later, Sharman was doing what he does best ? crazy comedy.

 ?It was never a conscious decision to do just comedy,? Sharman tells Metro. ?I have always gone by the script. It could have been a thriller or a social drama. I was also never worried about being typecast. I think I am too young to be typecast into one particular genre of films.?

 Both Style and its sequel Excuse Me, however, worked at the box-office and it wasn?t long before Sharman got a call from David Dhawan for Shaadi No. 1. Although the Diwali release failed at the box-office, Sharman was now in the big Bollywood league sharing space with the Fardeen Khans and Zayed Khans.

 But it is the Aamir Khan-starrer Rang De Basanti, which Sharman feels, will catapult him to the core circle in the film industry. ?It is not just a big film for me but a big film for a lot of other people in the business,? he says. ?And why not? The film has the biggest superstar in the country. We all hope that people like the film.?

 Of all the characters in Rang De Basanti, it is Sharman?s character of Sukhvinder aka Sukhi who is the most fun-loving. ?He comes from a small town in Haryana and goes to study in Delhi University against the wishes of his parents,? Sharman reveals. ?There he meets this bunch of people and the story is about what happens to them. Sukhi is very light-hearted, someone who wears his heart on his sleeve.?

 It is not just the presence of actors like Aamir, Madhavan and Atul Kulkarni which inspired Sharman to give his best in Rang De Basanti. ?When you have stalwarts like (cameraman) Binod Pradhan and (sound designer) Nakul Kamte on the sets, it was always going to be a special experience,? feels Sharman.

 But does he need to unlearn the David Dhawan school of acting to act in a Rakeysh Mehra film? ?It all depends on the mindset. Also, it?s boring to do the same kind of film every time. A new genre is a welcome change,? signs off Sharman, who has Rohit Shetty?s Golmaal in his kitty.

 Bouquet dispute keeps channels off

 Pockets of the city continued to go without the Zee channels as the switch-off of multi-system operator (MSO) CableComm entered the second week on Monday.

 Zee Turner, which distributes 23 channels like Zee TV, Zee Bangla, Cartoon Network and CNBC, had taken its signal off air following disputes related to the second bouquet of channels, which includes Pogo, HBO and CNBC Awaaz.

 ?We have been in discussion with Zee Turner, but a solution is yet to emerge,? said D.S. Mehta, chairman of CableComm. 

 ?They are seeking an effective increase of around Rs 35, which our operators will not be able to raise from the ground. There should also be a uniform rate for all the MSOs,? Mehta added.

 CableComm covers around 25 per cent of city cable homes, including Salt Lake, Beleghata and Alipore.

 ?We are ready to restore the signals as soon as CableComm pays the dues and signs the agreement,? said Arun Poddar, CEO of Zee Turner. ?How they can effect a hike from their operators is their concern,? Poddar added. 

 According to Zee Turner, besides not paying for the second bouquet, the MSO failed to renew the distribution agreement and resorted to ?unauthorised? distribution of the channels.

 ?There is some pressure from viewers for channels like Zee Bangla, Cartoon Network and CNBC, but it?s not too much since everyone is glued to the World Cup,? said a cable operator in central Calcutta.

 The matter was taken up by the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal last week. The tribunal did not order restoration of the signals and posted the matter for hearing on July 13.

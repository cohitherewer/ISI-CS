The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Repair road, light up street

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 

 citys information technology (IT) hub, Salt Lake Sector 

 V, is set to get a major facelift.

 Urban development minister Asok 

 Bhattacharya met senior government officials last week and 

 finalised an action plan for improving the basic infrastructure 

 of Sector V, recently renamed Nabadiganta Industrial Township.

 While the Calcutta Metropolitan 

 Development Authority (CMDA) will be responsible for repairing 

 roads in and around the township, private companies will 

 be involved in other projects like drinking water supply, 

 sewerage, traffic and transportation, area beautification 

 and setting up of food courts.

 CMDA will spend Rs 4.15 crore 

 on road repairs. Officials said Rs 2.10 crore will be spent 

 on overhauling the Salt Lake Bypass that links Sector V 

 with EM Bypass. The road dividers, too, will be repaired 

 and the street lighting system revamped. Mercury vapour 

 lamps will be installed on the roads.

 The private companies, the minister 

 said, will invest at least Rs 250 crore. The companies will 

 recover their investment by collecting taxes from the IT 

 units, selling advertisement space and running public utility 

 service booths.

 I have asked the officials 

 to start work immediately. We have started the process of 

 selecting private companies for the upgrade projects. We 

 hope to complete the formalities and start work within a 

 couple of months, Bhattacharya added.

 The government has rechristened 

 the IT hub as an industrial township, following an amendment 

 to the West Bengal Municipal Act, 1993, to keep the area 

 out of the Salt Lake municipalitys purview. 

 The infrastructure of the township, 

 however, did not improve, as the authority set up for its 

 upkeep was not allotted any funds.

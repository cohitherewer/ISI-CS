 What: 

 Launch of Senate Royal whisky.

 Where: The Park banquets.

 When: Monday, 7 pm onwards.

 Take a look: Fashion show, dance dos, mood music, cocktails and dinnerthe launch of Senate Royal whisky by Tilaknagar Industries Ltd was all about celebration in style. The whisky is described as a blend of imported Scotch malt and Indian neutral spirit and the brand is keen to make a foray into the east.

 The evening began with the dramatic uncorking of a dummy bottle carved in ice, even as significant notes of The final countdown resounded in the background. The temperature took quite a turn with dance troupe Toxic warming things up to tracks like Afsana banake bhool na jaana, Tere bin, Crazy kiya re, Kajra re and Dhoom macha le. A musical performance by Fifth Dimension pepped up proceedings.

 Ramp affair: Models, including actresses Locket Chatterjee and Rimjhim Mitra, showcased designer wear through five sequences. Bobby Sens collection saw frilly body-hugging tops in pastel shades, embroidered and checked skirts and kurtis. The second collection from Mischief was all about flowing fabrics highlighted with lace. Next up was an ethnic range comprising saris and ghagras in bright greens and blues. After yet another collection by Mischief comprising flowing fabrics, the final series had funky tops with denims.

 Voiceover: We have a strong foothold in the south. We hope to achieve similar success in the east, said Amit Dhanukar, chairman, Tilaknagar Industries Ltd.

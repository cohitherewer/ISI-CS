The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Reddy volcano erupts

Screen On amp; Off

 Burning hot: Sushama 

 Reddy

 Few expected her to shine as a village belle, given her no-holds-barred glam doll image. But Sushama Reddy got all the rave reviews for Chup Chup Ke. As a well-deserved break, Sushama the travel freak took off for Greece to meet sister Meghna (former VJ) after the Priyadarshan film opened at the theatres. 

 The Greek getaway turned Sushama into a daredevil of sorts as she and Meghna travelled to Italy, accompanied by a few friends. Once there, the gang climbed up an active volcano called Stromboli which has been in continuous eruption for the last 2,000 years. 

 A steep slope of more than a thousand metres, the Reddys? path was laden with active lava and the deep rumbling of the furious volcano threatening to erupt. Says Sushama: ?The first things that came into sight were the vapours and fumes along with the magma being spewed in the air. It was an awe-inspiring experience. Finally, when I reached the Stromboli town, I was covered in ash and dust but I was really happy.?

 As far as the big screen goes, Sushama will next be seen in Mahesh Manjrekar?s Big Bazaar, where she is part of an ensemble cast. She will also get to play the quintessential Bollywood heroine in Puneet Issar?s next film.

 On a high note: 

 Members of the band Call

 The Next Big Thing on Channel [V] is the Pakistani band called Call ? ?an invitation to the abstract and theoretically boundless world of human possibility and play?. Call, whose music dares you to break free from the limitations of the physical world, comprises Xulfiqar J Khan, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Sultan Raja and Waqar Ahmed Khan.

 Call made a path-breaking debut in the world of music with the single Pukaar that was nominated Best Rock Song at the Indus Music Awards. The video of their third single Shayad is amongst the most requested song in Pakistan and is played on almost every music channel. Call was, in fact, the first band to go on foreign tours even before its debut album had released.

 Now, Call?s first music album Jilawatan has broken all records on the music charts. Featuring a total of 11 tracks, the album showcases a diverse range from heavy numbers for the hard rockers to mellow meditative numbers and powerful ballads. This album has just been nominated for the Best Album award at the Lux Style Awards 2006 in Pakistan. 

 To promote their special Krrish tour in the Lion City, Singapore Tourism Board has tied up with Discovery tour operator in the city. They had already tied up with national operators like Cox amp; Kings, Orbit Tours, Raj Travels and Tours, and Thomas Cook.

 A marriage of tourism and tinsel a la The Da Vinci Code, the Krrish tour is aimed at acquainting visitors with the flavour, culture, sights and sounds of the island city as they trace the steps of the Indian superhero in the cosmopolitan setting.

 The prospective traveller has exciting packages to choose from. One could opt for the four-days-three-nights Krrish trail priced at $ 185 per person on a twin-sharing basis, which excludes airfares and taxes. The package includes three-night accommodation at the Golden Landmark Hotel, along with complimentary breakfast, airport transfers and tours to the key locations where the Hrithik Roshan-starrer has been shot.

 Says Kenneth Lim, area director, northern and eastern India, Singapore Tourism Board: ?Krrish being a complete family entertainer, we have included something for everyone in this package, right from the world-renowned Singapore Zoo to Sentosa Islands.?

 Father shuns baby after suicide by mother 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Sreyasi gropes for her mother in sleep and wakes up crying, not being able to find her.

 Two days after the nine-month-old, suffering from a respiratory disorder, was admitted to BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on July 15, her mother Lalita Mondal, 32, committed suicide by hanging herself in a rest room for doctors.

 The baby, though fit to be released, has since been languishing in the hospital, alone. Father Amiya visited the hospital only twice since Lalita?s death and refused to take her home on the grounds that there is no one to look after her. None of his relatives has ever come to see the baby.

 ?The girl has recovered and we?re ready to release her, but her father told us he could not take her home now. He said there was no one to take care of her,? said medical superintendent M.K. Chatterjee.

 ?She always cries for her mother. It?s very difficult to feed her and lull her to sleep,? rued a nurse.

 Lalita was married to Amiya, of Hingalganj, in North 24-Parganas, six years ago. They were going through a financial crisis, as neither Amiya nor Lalita had a job. The couple lived on the support of family members.

 At the hospital, as Sreyasi?s condition improved, the drip and oxygen were withdrawn last Monday. But Lalita feared Sreyasi?s condition would worsen again and rushed downstairs to her husband. She became paranoid and had an altercation with him. Minutes later, she killed herself.

 The same day, Sreyasi was shifted to the paying ward, where an extra cot was provided to her. ?In the other wards, three babies on an average share a bed and it would have been difficult looking after her,? Chatterjee pointed out. The cot has been placed in front of the desk where nurses and doctors sit, so the baby could be under watch round-the-clock.

 The nurses have bought food and dresses for the child. They feed her and at times take her up in their arms and move around. The mothers of other babies admitted in the ward also take turns in comforting Sreyasi. ?I often go to her and try to lull her to sleep,? said Archana Gayen, whose son Kalyan is in the same ward.

 The superintendent himself goes to the baby twice a day.

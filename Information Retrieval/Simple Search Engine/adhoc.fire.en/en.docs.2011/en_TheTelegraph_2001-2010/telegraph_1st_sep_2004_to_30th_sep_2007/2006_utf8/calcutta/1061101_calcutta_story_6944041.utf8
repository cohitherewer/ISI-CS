The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Aishwarya Rai

 You are always considerate. You aim to do good work, try to keep a positive attitude, and rarely fly off the handle. You have difficulty telling a lie, though youre masterful at spinning convincingly gentle untruths. You like to lead, rather than follow. You have an insatiable appetite for activity and always aim to keep things peaceful. Kusum Bhandari

 What: Absolut 

 Elegance.

 Where: Topaz banquet hall 

 at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 When: Thursday night.

 The story so far: The four-city model hunt, a quest to find women of substance, began in New Delhi. The second stop was Ludhiana and Thursday witnessed the Calcutta chapter. Pune will play host to the final leg on October 18.

 The four regional winners will walk the ramp in Mumbai on October 25 to launch a new clothing line by Absolut Label.

 There were no titles, no crowns it was a real model hunt, which, claimed the organisers, could land the girls grooming sessions, contracts with Elite Model Management India and a chance to feature in Absolut campaigns. 

 The judges: Actress June, model Sanjukta, New Delhi-based fashion photographer Anushka and vice-president of HHI, Madhusudan Jhingan.

 On the ramp: An overwhelming response saw nine contestants Madhabilata, Ekta, Vanisha, Deepika, Ashton, Shireen, Anumita, Misha and Sonia sashaying down the ramp (rather, trying to sashay down the ramp) after a one-day catwalk crash course by Elite Model Management Indias Sophie Smith.

 The teaser round over, the girls came back to introduce themselves in pink spaghetti tops branded with Absolut Elegance, teamed with short denim skirts. The next round saw these girls make some Absolut moves. Moves that saw them partnered them with empty Absolut bottles as they gyrated and jiggled to the music, props in hand. Elegance was the last thing to be found here, with the moves nothing short of sleazy.

 The final round, the question-answer session, drew some clever answers. Sample this: What would you do if Abhishek Bachchan proposed and your parents said no? I will ask him to bring Amitabh Bachchan and convince my parents. They will never say no! Or this: Which film star would you like to kidnap? Mallika Sherawat, because she does everything but act!

 Ekta Dhar was the winner. Maybe it was her answer (I will dump my guy if I found him gay but keep my friendship, hoping to meet his cute boyfriends) or her toned body that won the day.

 Also spotted: Cellulite and gawky body language.

 The verdict: Anushka and June summed things up Some of the girls will do well, others will not.

 Voiceover: We want to connect brand Absolut to youth and what better way than a model hunt to connect with our potential consumers, said Siddharth Banerji, managing director of Kyndal India Pvt Ltd.

 First frenzy

 What: First anniversary celebrations of Underground.

 Where: The discotheque at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: The crowd comprised regular party people, including a few Tollywood faces like Rachana Banerjee and Arunima Ghosh. The DJ kept the dance floor packed with tracks like Bin tere sanam, Kyon aaj kal and Hips dont lie.

 Voiceover: When we 

 were planning Underground there was an overdose of lounges 

 in the city. So we decided to make Underground a typical 

 foot-tapping disco aimed at energetic youngsters. After 

 one year we can confidently say that we did not go wrong. 

 The place is a hit with the young brigade, smiled 

 D.K. Jaiswal, chairman and managing director, HHI.

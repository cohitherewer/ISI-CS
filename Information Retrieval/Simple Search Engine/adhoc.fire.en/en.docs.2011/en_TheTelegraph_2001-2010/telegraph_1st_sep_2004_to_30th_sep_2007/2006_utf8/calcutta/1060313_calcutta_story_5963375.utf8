The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Adam Clayton of U2 You 

 are cautious and persevering. Your keys to success are willpower 

 and determination. Though you are good at sizing up situations, 

 you fail when it comes to emotional evaluation. At times, 

 you may go through a phase of inner confrontation. You expect 

 too much from others, as well from yourself. ? Kusum Bhandari

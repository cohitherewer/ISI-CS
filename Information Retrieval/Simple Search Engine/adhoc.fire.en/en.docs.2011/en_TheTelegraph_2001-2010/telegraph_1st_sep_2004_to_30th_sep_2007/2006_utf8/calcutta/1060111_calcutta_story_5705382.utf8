 Specialised healthcare in south Calcutta is set to get a shot in the arm with the commissioning of three wings at AMRI Hospitals by January-end.

 At a total investment of Rs 80 crore, the oncology, neurology and cardiology wings in a new annexe will also have special value-additions for patients, like a mobile library and bedside toasters. In addition, the suite rooms will boast electronically-operated beds, remote-operated curtains and separate nursing stations. The project of the AMRI group, the first joint sector undertaking with the state government, also includes a Rs 5 crore upgrade plan.

 ?It has been our constant endeavour to expand to super-speciality disciplines. The new building is a giant leap in that direction. The 200 added beds, along with the existing 175, will offer a range of facilities, such as radiotherapy, interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, orthopaedics, trauma care and neuroscience,? said Aditya V. Agarwal, director of AMRI Hospitals. Apart from specialist medical care, the AMRI group is also inclined to make inroads in education and research, he added.

 With the opening of the radiotherapy section in the new oncology wing, AMRI will be the first hospital in eastern India to offer the complete portfolio in cancer care, including surgical, medical and radiation oncology.

 ?The new cardiology wing will also have a dual-panel cardiac catheterisation lab with the first-ever 4D echo machine for invasive cardiology and bypass surgeries,? said AMRI president S.B. Purakayastha.

 The orthopaedic section in the annexe will offer total hip and knee replacement surgeries, and also take on cases of joint replacements, fusion for cervical disc problems, and decompression and stabilisation of fractures of dorsal, lumbar and cervical internal spine. ?Even surgeries for polio myelitis, early degenerative osteoarthritis, closed interlocking nails for long bone fractures and external fixation of compound fractures will be possible in the new unit,? explained Purakayastha.

 Officials said that the recently-installed, state-of-the-art Linear Accelerator (LINAC) in the hospital?s radiotherapy section, the most modern radiation equipment commonly used for external beam radiation treatments for cancer patients, will be better utilised once the oncology wing starts functioning. ?Besides, there will be a hi-tech treatment facility of Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) with MLC (Multileaf Collimator),? explained a specialist at the hospital.

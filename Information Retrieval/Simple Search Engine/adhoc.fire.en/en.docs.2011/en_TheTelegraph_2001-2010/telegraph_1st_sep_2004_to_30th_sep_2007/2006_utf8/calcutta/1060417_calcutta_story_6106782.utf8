 A pitched battle between police and a section of residents of Narkeldanga, over a soiree that was continuing till late on Saturday flouting all rules, left more than 20 persons, including seven cops, injured.

 The clash on Wards Institution Street broke out around 3 am, after police asked the organisers to end the programme, and continued till 6.30 am.

 ?There was no police permission for the soiree, organised by a local club,? said Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division). ?Pollution control board norms also do not allow use of such blaring microphones at night. The organisers were requested to stop the programme, but they refused. When our men intervened, the club members beat them up.?

 Police claimed they were attacked with soda bottles, bricks and rods. A sergeant?s motorcycle was destroyed, some wireless sets were smashed and the glass pane of a wireless van was shattered.

 Thirty-two people were arrested and several loudspeakers seized. Police have been deployed in the locality to pre-empt any fresh flare-up.

 The soiree was part of a five-day-long revelry organised by MMD Pallybasi Brinda, on the occasion of Sitala puja. 

 ?It started around 9.45 pm and there seemed no problem,? said Maya Hazra, a local resident. ?Suddenly, the cops turned up and asked the club members to end the programme. We tried to convince them that this was a mega event and continuing the show for a few more hours should not be an issue. The cops went away, only to return in larger numbers. They resorted to indiscriminate assault, hitting mostly women.?

 Police said they had to initially beat a retreat after being attacked by the residents. The officers immediately informed Narkeldanga police station and the Lalbazar headquarters, asking for reinforcements. A larger contingent then rushed to the spot.

 Thyroid cancer doubles its count

 SANJAY MANDAL

 When Bodhisattva Das, 24, began to experience difficulty in swallowing food, he dismissed it as a sore throat. 

 He brushed aside suggestions of seeing a doctor. 

 The swelling, however, started to spread and affected his breathing. 

 Das was diagnosed with thyroid cancer ? medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. The tumour was removed after a 10-hour surgery at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. 

 Das is not an exception. Thyroid cancer is on the rise in the city. According to doctors, one per cent of the total cancer patients in the city suffered from thyroid cancer in the 1990s. The figure has doubled in the current decade. 

 ?In most cases, early detection and surgery can bring about good results,? said surgical oncologist of Apollo Gleneagles, Saikat Gupta, who operated on Das. ?Although there has been a rise in the number of thyroid cancer patients, the cause is not yet known.?

 Surgical oncologist Gautam Mukhopadhyay stated: ?Incidence of thyroid cancer is showing an upward trend among young people. Young women are more prone to the disease than young men.? 

 Among the four types of thyroid cancer, papillary and follicular types are the most common in Calcutta. 

 ?However, if the operation is conducted in time, the patient usually survives more than 20 years,? Mukhopadhyay added.

 The increase in the number of thyroid cancer cases has necessitated introduction of treatment facilities at city hospitals. 

 Radio iodine ablation therapy, not possible in Calcutta at the moment, is likely to be made available here within a year. The therapy is believed to be effective for papillary and follicular types of thyroid cancer. 

 ?We have plans to instal the facility. A proposal has been submitted to the government,? said Subhankar Chowdhury, head of the endocrinology department of Institute of Post-Graduate Medicine and Research and SSKM Hospital. 

 ?The construction of our new building will start next month and then, we will start seeking permission from various authorities for installing the radio iodine ablation therapy facility,? held V. Sathyanarayana Reddy, chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.

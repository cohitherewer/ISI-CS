 Kit haul in hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Several expired diagnostic kits were impounded on Tuesday evening from the premises of Medical College and Hospital and a medicine distributors office on Lenin Sarani. 

 The kits were for use in the hospital. The kits seized at Medical College were under use. Raids will be conducted at other state-run hospitals, said an officer.

 Last month, police had busted a racket dealing in expired medical kits. Govind Sarda, owner of a Secunderabad-based medicine company, and two others were arrested in this connection. 

 The firm had allegedly supplied expired and fake diagnostic kits to hospitals and blood banks across the state.

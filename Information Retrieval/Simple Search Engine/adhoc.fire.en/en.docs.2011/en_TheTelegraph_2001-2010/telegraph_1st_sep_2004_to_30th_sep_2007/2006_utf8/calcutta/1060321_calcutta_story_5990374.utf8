 Happy hunting ground of sleaze

 - Lack of bonding in Salt Lake blamed for ills

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Innumerable clusters of houses spread over acres, countless flats lying unoccupied, and a meagre police force struggling to meet the demands of the VVIPS. If it is sleaze racket, Salt Lake probably remains the best option. At least, that?s what residents say.

 ?We had complained to the police on several occasions in the past about the shady goings-on in the flat of Jayanta Pal, but in vain. The problem lies with the township?s geographical character. There is hardly a sense of community here,? says Kaveri Dutta, a resident of the building in EE block, where Chanchal Sarkar, officer-in-charge of Sinthee police station, was arrested late on Saturday along with a woman and Jayanta Pal. Dutta has a point.

 Forget extortionist Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar, who would often go to a flat in Salt Lake for fun, and the much-hyped raid on Merlin Bar at Nayapatti, owned by Avtar Singh, husband of Jyotirmoyee Sikdar. In the past year alone, the police have on four occasions busted sleaze rackets in Salt Lake. From bank managers to working executives, and last but not least, a police officer, there have been arrests galore.

 ?The problem lies with the lack of bonding. At the thana level, it is really difficult to keep a tab on what is going on inside which flat. We?ve kicked off community policing and that is yielding some results,? says Praveen Kumar, police superintendent of North 24-Parganas. Late on Monday, Kumar submitted a detailed report on the incident to city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. Action will be taken against Sarkar on the basis of this report.

 In May last year, before the municipal elections in Salt Lake, police from Bidhannagar (East) had barged into a flat in AH block and busted a sleaze racket run by an elderly woman. Subsequently, they raided a flat in BD block and arrested a bank manager on charges of running a massage parlour that doubled as a sleaze den. Similar raids were carried out in a string of flats in AJ, KB and KC blocks.

 ?The problem lies with those who apply for a flat, and after bagging it either sell it off to outsiders in violation of the rule, or rent it out. This holds true for a few Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) housing estates. We?ve asked the CMDA authorities to carry out a survey of the status of occupants at different housing estates, particularly Salt Lake,? said Pran Bandhu Nag of the CMDA Abasan Suraksha Committee.

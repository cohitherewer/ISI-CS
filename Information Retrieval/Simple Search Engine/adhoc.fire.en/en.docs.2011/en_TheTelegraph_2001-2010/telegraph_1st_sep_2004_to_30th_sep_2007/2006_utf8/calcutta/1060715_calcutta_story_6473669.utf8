 In March this year, a taxi carrying 15 persons collided with a truck on the Jaipur-Kishangarh expressway. The passengers were seriously injured. After receiving information through the Highway Traffic Management System (HTMS) emergency telephone, a team of paramedics and road patrol rushed the victims to the nearest hospital. One person died.

 Similar actions of prompt information transmission helped save two bikers and passengers of a container in June on the same highway.

 The set-up that saved lives and bettered the road experience in Jaipur is arriving in Calcutta, via the second Vivekananda Bridge. ?HTMS is a tool to manage traffic on the road, provide emergency services during accidents and inform travellers about the road ahead, making the journey smooth for them,? said Pushkar Kulkarni, CEO of Efkon Group India, the Austria-based company implementing the system.

 ?When we?re making such good roads, we should manage them better, too,? Kulkarni offered.

 HTMS has several components such as Variable Message Signs, Closed Circuit TV, Automatic Traffic Counting and Classification System, Weather Monitoring System, Emergency Road-side Telephone System, Inter-connection system and Control Room Supervisory Equipment.

 In case of an accident, a combination of the components is put to use to alert drivers and call for assistance. ?The emergency phone is used to inform highway patrol. The camera provides a detailed view of the scene and then aid is called for. The message signs can warn drivers entering the stretch about accidents ahead and they can make a detour,? Kulkarni explained.

 Besides emergency situations, HTMS is also used to monitor traffic at critical crossings, offer weather data and detect overloaded vehicles that can damage the road.

 Efkon?s HTMS system has been in use since early 2005 on the six-lane 90-km Jaipur-Kishangarh expressway, a part of the Golden Quadrilateral.

 The design for the HTMS system to be used for the second Vivekananda Bridge is ready and the system itself should be commissioned by March next year. According to Efkon, Calcuttans can look forward to a ?smooth and reliable? journey where they would be able to predict the duration of the journey, quick clearance of the toll through smart cards, and information about the weather and road conditions up ahead.

 ?The entirely indigenously developed system is built to withstand any eventuality. The only challenge while designing it was the lack of an escape route, as the river is on both sides of the bridge,? Kulkarni added.

 Breaking the common aphorism that Tagores dramaturgy is verbose and non-theatrical, Tritiyo Sutra Performance Company presents a contemporary version of his celebrated play, Raktakarabi. Exploring new dimensions in the original text, the performance re-contextualises the story in the present setting, without making it a modern costume play. Raktakarabi depicts the conflict between mechanisation and the free human spirit. It offers a critique of the ideology of regimentation and exploitation of technology that lead to dehumanisation of the self. In such a world, the soul is made captive and bound by compulsions. In the play, Nandini represents undying love. Unfettered life beckons all to share the abounding joy of love, light and hope. Love and life also assert their power by reviving and recreating themselves after death. Ultimately, the play deals with the hopes, anxieties and sufferings of our times. Drama and direction: Suman Mukhopadhyay.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Raktakarabi, produced by Tritiyo Sutra Performance Company

 Makeoverwill yield more floor area to sell

 The Left Front civic board has found a virtue in the earlier Trinamul Congress-BJP regime?s policy of granting relaxation in building rules to a project to make it economically viable.

 The developers who will develop the College Street market have been granted a relaxation by the present board, to ensure that the new structure yields the desirable floor space, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said.

 At a meeting on Thursday with director-general (building) Gorachand Mondol and other officials of the department, Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay were convinced that the College Street project would not be viable unless the investors get at least 800,000 sq ft floor space in the revamped market.

 Mondol pointed out that if the present building rules were enforced, not more than 500,000 sq ft would be available after reconstruction. Of that, more than 150,000 sq ft will have to allotted to the existing 1,200-odd stall-owners and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will get another 100,000 sq ft. The net saleable floor space will be a mere 250,000 sq ft.

 The relaxation in the building rules will ensure that the developers have at their disposal at least 500,000 sq ft of saleable space.

 ?We plan to convert the College Street market into a multi-storeyed mall, with all the facilities of a modern commercial complex, including a parking lot,? Bhattacharyya said.

 Buckling under pressure from the Opposition Trinamul Congress, the CPM-led board has also decided to scale down the proposed lease period of the property from 180 years to 33 years.

 According to the proposal placed before the civic house four months ago, the market was to be leased out to Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd for 180 years, against a payment of Rs 2 crore.

 Anup Chatterjee, Javed Ahmed Khan and Rajib Deb of the Trinamul Congress had then accused the mayor of selling the market, ?in the guise of the build-operate-transfer scheme?, at a throwaway price. Going by the market rate, they claimed, the seven-bigha plot on which the market stands would have fetched at least Rs 20 crore.

 The allegations had prompted the mayor to defer discussion on the issue, claiming that ?some crucial points are missing in the proposal?. 

 The College Street market, like most civic markets, has been a perennial source of concern for the CMC. During the tenure of the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine, the civic body would spend Rs 80 lakh a year on the market, though the revenue from it had never been more than Rs 22 lakh a year.

 All civic markets taken together, the annual upkeep expenditure crosses Rs 3 crore.

 Last July, the mayoral council had unanimously passed a resolution on handing over the market to Bengal Shelter to redevelop it on a build-operate-transfer basis.

 During the reconstruction, the stall-owners will be relocated on the 16.5-bigha Marcus Square, one of the largest green and open spaces in the city, on Madan Mohan Burman Street.

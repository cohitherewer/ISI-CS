Mexican melange

A happy space, a splash of sunny shades, 

earthy effects and rustic accessories make up this vibrant look, observes Shradha 

Agarwal

 A Mexican home conjures images of a happy, sunny space with lots of energy and life to complement the inner warmth. Influences from nature, be it plants to cheer up the home or straw artefacts that liven up the showcase, bright tiles on tabletops or an inviting hammock in the garden, a Mexican theme is literally as bright as it gets. 

 GoodLife tells you more about the Mexican look for your home. 

 Inside out 

 The Mexican theme, says interior designer Ajay Arya, goes best with a farm or an outhouse.

 This is because the entire feel of a Mexican set-up is extremely relaxed and casual, he says, adding that a dining room would also be equally viable for this look. 

 Very much in sync with nature, a Mexican home boasts many natural influences. The patio is an extremely vital part of this theme. This area, where the interiors and the exteriors amalgamate, can be decorated beautifully with bougainvillea shrubs, yucca or even poppies, explains interior designer Vivek Rathore. 

 Another detail that can be incorporated in the lawns or the garden is a line of fire mashaals. This adds an amazing authenticity to the look, he says. 

 Design detail

 Experts say that a Mexican look is set apart from others with its sheer choice of colours. The palette revolves around sunny shades like yellow, orange and red. 

 A lot of grey is also used in this theme. Sometimes a dash of blue is common too, feels Vivek.

 The colour story is such, observes Ajay, because of the Mexican resemblance to the Mediterranean.

 The basic look here is very rustic and earthy and an extremely strong influence of folk art is prevalent too. The basic patterns are floral. Mexicans draw a lot of inspiration from birds too, particularly parrots, shares Vivek.

 Interesting wall art, either created by textures and colours or by wool hangings, lends an additional sense of warmth to the house.

 It is also quite common for a Mexican home to have brightly-tiled flooring and tiles on tabletops, says Vivek. 

 He shares some more furniture facts for a Mexican home:

 Mostly made from pinewood, Mexican furniture is modern in style.

 Leather cushions are thrown casually around the home.

 Hewn side-tables complete the setting.

 Bright, folding chairs and hammocks are essential.

 The upholstery is preferably striped and vibrant.

 Beaten metal and hammered accessories are common; the emphasis is on a glazed look. 

 Tin is a favourite metal when it comes to cut-outs, chandeliers and lamps. 

 Add-on appeal 

 Chillies, cactus, sand? The add-ons in a Mexican home are quirky and fun. Ceramics and pottery also add tremendous character to the set-up. Figurines in terracotta, bright lamps and jars, ethnic sculptures ? all go on to make focal points of interest in the home. 

 Ceramic designer Anupama Jalan provides some pointers to what defines Mexican pottery:

 The colour palette sets the right mood. Lots of red, orange and yellow are used.

 Eye-catching shapes like triangles are more common than regular designs.

 Imprints look attractive, anything from chilli patterns to cactus.

 Women on top

 Few Indians have heard of Caryl Churchill, a pioneer of British feminist theatre and one of the most distinguished women dramatists in the UK. She believes that drama should reveal new worlds beyond and beneath the surface of ordinary life. Churchills major plays have done just that; experimenting with form and breaking conventional expectations of theatre. Written by her during Thatcherite times, Top Girls is a contemporary classic which remains relevant to this day. Presenting political and personal ideologies, it is a play that deals with the choices and decisions that modern young people have to contend with along lifes journey. Turning time topsy-turvy, it offers a surreal experience, yet is intensely realistic in its use of Churchills stylistic invention of overlapping dialogue. Staged as its annual production by Jadavpur University Department of English, the play has been Indianised and directed by Ananda Lal.

 Event: Play in English, Top Girls, produced by Jadavpur University Department of English

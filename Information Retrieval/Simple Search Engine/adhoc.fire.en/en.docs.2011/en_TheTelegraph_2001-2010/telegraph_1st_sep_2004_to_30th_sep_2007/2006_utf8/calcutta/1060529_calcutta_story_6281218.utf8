 Ayan Mazumder will not forget the 35 minutes on Sunday morning when he lost and found the bag that carried his mother?s medical papers, thanks to Calcutta traffic police, who thought on their feet. 

 Around 10 am on Sunday, Ayan hired a taxi from the Rabindra Sarobar Metro station. 

 The 32-year-old from Santoshpur, a librarian with a multinational electronics company, was on his way to Palta with his mother and brother, to visit his maternal uncle. 

 They took a cab as Metro services begin later on Sunday and proceeded to Sealdah, from where they were to take the local train to Palta. 

 The taxi sped off after dropping them at Sealdah. Almost immediately, Ayan?s mother, Kalpana, 62, realised that the bag containing her X-Ray report and prescriptions for her arthritis was left behind. 

 She had seen a doctor the day before for some relief in her prolonged illness. 

 Ayan began to chase the taxi. Other taxi drivers at the stand saw him. 

 ?One of them said he had seen the number and gave it to me. I informed the police constable nearby, who took me to a sergeant. The man pulled out his wireless set and passed on the number immediately,? Ayan said. 

 The number reached all traffic sergeants in minutes, including Suvendu Sarkar and Sanjay Singh of East Traffic Guard, posted near Alimuddin Street. They identified the taxi.

 ?Soon after receiving the message, we kept scanning vehicles for the number. Suddenly, it came trundling along. We raised our hands and asked the driver to stop, but he sped by,? Singh said.

 Then, a chase began. The two sergeants trailed the taxi and soon after it crossed the Eliot Road-AJC Bose Road intersection and slowed down, the driver was cuffed.

 ?The man had kept the bag in the boot. We found a small diary that had Ayan?s mobile phone number and we informed him immediately. There were X-ray plates, prescriptions and a few clothes in the bag,? Sarkar said. 

 Ayan was speechless. ?Day before yesterday, I visited the doctor and he was the last hope for my mother. Since my father passed away, she had developed medical complications and I had been visiting an endless number of doctors,? he told police. 

 ?My perception about traffic police has changed. We rarely get to see the other side of these men,? Ayan said.

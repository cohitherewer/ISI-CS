The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Three Ps of film-making

Screen On amp; Off

 ?The market for regional films is 100 per cent bigger,? says Gopi Malya, owner of the seven-year old Malya Films Ltd, the company with a production target of 33 films in 14 languages for 2006.

 Of the films to be launched by this industrialist from Karnataka, seven would be in Bengali. The first one goes on the floors from April and is to be directed by Nabendu Ghosh?s song Subhankar, who had bagged a National Award for his debut Woh Chokri.

 The first schedule of the film, with a budget of around Rs 2.5 crore, will be shot in London but thereafter the action will shift to Calcutta, Siliguri or Kalimpong. Actors for the ?family-oriented film? are yet to be finalised, but his wish list for the aged couple include: Victor Banerjee and Moushumi Chatterjee.

 The original story by a Gujarati writer is about the clash of Western and traditional Indian values and an honest evaluation of the changing times, the film-maker says from Mumbai. ?Woh Chokri was a tribute to Indian women. The multi layered film drew parallels between the girl and Mother India,? says Subhankar.

 As far as stories go, producer Malya is interested only in the ?comic and emotional? because that is what works best not only with viewers in Bengal but also in Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Assam and other states. Drawn to the film industry by friend and partner Jackie Shroff, Malya?s primary concern is to balance ?input and output?. To win the regional market all one needs is to get the three ?P?s ? product, price and place of distribution ? right, insists Malya.

 Reaching out: Rani at 

 the Helen Keller Institute

 It?s one birthday Rani Mukherjee is not going to forget in a hurry. As the Bollywood queen celebrates her big day on Tuesday, STAR Gold has come up with a special show titled Roshni Ka Jashn. The programme has Beroz Vacha, honorary director and consultant of the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf amp; Deafblind, writing an open letter to Rani. 

 ?Through your very brilliant and poignant role of Michelle in Black you have kindled a fire of curiosity, astonishment and belief in the abilities of deaf-blind,? Vacha has written. 

 ?At the premiere on February 3rd I met you after the movie. Your face was radiant and you asked me, ?Did you like my acting?? Rani, only a person with humility can utter these words and ask for our approval,? Vacha continues and rounds off the moving letter by requesting Rani to be a patron of the institute.

 To find out what Rani?s response to this was, watch the birthday celebrations from 8 pm on STAR Gold.

 Two of a kind: Cameron Diaz 

 and Toni Collette

 Cameron Diaz has returned to the Calcutta big screen after quite some time and she has brought Toni Collette and Shirley MacLaine along with her. In Her Shoes has Diaz and Collete playing two sisters with almost nothing in common. While one is a straight-laced attorney, the other survives on sex with various men and quick cash. The one thing they do have in common is, well, the same shoe size!

 Getting into the shoes of her character wasn?t that easy for Collette. When director Curtis Hanson approached Collette before filming, he asked the actress to gain weight for the part. Collette complied and proceeded to gain 25 pounds, which she subsequently lost during the film?s shooting, as the script demanded.

 If Dhoni can, so can we! That?s the mantra the three Indian Idol finalists followed when they went for a complete makeover just weeks before the eventual champion is announced. And as expected, nerves took over the trio ? Anuj, Karunya and Sandeep ? as they pondered whether their new look would be worth a second look.

 You can catch all the emotions as they unfold on your telly as SAB TV?s Indian Idol Taka Tak brings you the hair-raising experience on Tuesday at 10 pm.

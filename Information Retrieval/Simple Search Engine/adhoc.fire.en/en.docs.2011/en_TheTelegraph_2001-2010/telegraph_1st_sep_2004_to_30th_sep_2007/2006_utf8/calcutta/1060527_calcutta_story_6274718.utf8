The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flak and flock for quota protesters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ignoring criticism from a section of their colleagues on Friday, medical students and junior doctors protesting reservation were gearing up for Saturday?s rally that threatens to bring traffic to a halt for hours in several areas of the city.

 ?What they (the protesters) are doing is farcical and against the interest of the people. There is no point in disrupting hospital services,? said Sovanendu Das, state president of the Junior Doctors? Council, a Leftist association of doctors. 

 ?We want a national debate to find out a feasible solution to this complex and sensitive matter,? he added.

 This was the first time the council came out openly against the anti-quota protests, being spearheaded by Youth for Equality across the country.

 The protesters, sticking to their schedule of a relay hunger strike and ceasework at several state-run hospitals, were determined to make the rally a ?huge success?. 

 Avrojit Raha, of Youth for Equality, said: ?Our agitation will continue. We plan to launch an indefinite hunger strike next week. Tomorrow, at least 10,000 of our supporters will join the rally that will start from Medical College and Hospital around 2 pm.?

 The protesters will march through College Street, MG Road and CR Avenue and assemble at Shahid Minar, where a convention will be held.

 Students of Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, who ran an anti-reservation signature campaign on the campus on Friday, will join the rally. ?We are supporting Youth for Equality?s protest against the reservation policy,? said a spokesperson for the students? union of the institute.

 ?We will have to divert traffic and take necessary action if the protesters block roads,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic).

 Apart from the Junior Doctors? Council, the anti-quota protesters are facing opposition from another organisation, People for Better Treatment (PBT). 

 The group has threatened to move court against the ceasework by junior doctors.

 ?We have already submitted a memorandum to the health department,? said Kunal Saha, president of the organisation. ?We are weighing the option of filing a public interest litigation against the strike. We do not support the proposed quota hike, but patients cannot be harassed in the name of a movement.?

 The tale of harassment of patients continued on Friday. 

 Mohammad Salaam, a resident of Topsia, who came to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital to get his eight-month-old niece treated, had to wait in a queue for around two-and-a-half hours.

 ?Work at the emergency ward and in the operating theatres was not hampered. But the outpatients? department was affected a bit,? said M. Mukherjee, National Medical College medical superintendent. The scene was much the same at other hospitals.

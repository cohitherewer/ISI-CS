The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Recommends

THE DVD

 (Landmark, Rs 600) There are more reasons to remember Janet 

 Jackson besides a wardrobe malfunction. And this 16-video 

 collection from the 80s and 90s sports a few of them. Look 

 out for Rhythm Nation, That?s the Way Love Goes 

 and, of course, Runaway. 

 THE READING

 (Max Mueller Bhavan, March 20, 6.30 pm) Soumitra Chatterjee 

 will read the Bengali translation of the essay by Eliot 

 Weinberger to commemorate the anniversary of the Iraq war. 

 THE EXHIBITION

 (CIMA 

 Gallery, March 19-April 21) Jointly organised by CIMA and 

 Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, the show will feature 

 pioneering works on video from Germany. There will also be 

 guided tours through the exhibition and a seminar on media 

 art by Anja Osswald.

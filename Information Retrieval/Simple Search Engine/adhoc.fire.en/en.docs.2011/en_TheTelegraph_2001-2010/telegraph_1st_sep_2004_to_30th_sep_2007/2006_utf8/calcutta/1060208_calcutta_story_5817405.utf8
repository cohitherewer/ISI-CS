The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Carrier?s city plans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After months of speculation, Lufthansa Airlines on Tuesday announced its intention of operating direct flights out of the city.

 ?At the moment, we?re studying the market in Calcutta and the eastern region. By March, we?ll make a formal announcement,? said Werner Heesen, general manager (passenger sales, India) and director (Southeast Asia), Lufthansa.

 On Tuesday afternoon, he met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers? Buildings. In the past six months, Heesen has toured Calcutta twice.

 The German airline is expected to start operations on the Calcutta-Frankfurt sector from November, when the winter schedule comes into effect.

 ?Our plans are subject to the availability of aircraft. In the beginning, we intend to operate three flights a week. We will try to build it up to daily flights,? added Heesen.

 Lufthansa currently operates from Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai.

 At the meeting, the chief minister had reportedly assured the airline, which had withdrawn from the city in the mid-1980s, of all possible cooperation.

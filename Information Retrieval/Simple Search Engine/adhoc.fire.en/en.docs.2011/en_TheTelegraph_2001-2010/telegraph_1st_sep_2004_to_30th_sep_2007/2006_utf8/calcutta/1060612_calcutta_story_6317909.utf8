The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Narcotics shadow on nightclubs

 - Duo spills the beans on clients in party circuit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Police and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) have chalked out plans to raid nightclubs and other hangouts following reports of drug use there.

 ?We have information that drugs are being used at discotheques and late-night parties. Unlike Mumbai and Delhi, this is a recent phenomenon in Calcutta. We will soon conduct raids at these places,? deputy commissioner, detective department (special), Rajiv Mishra told Metro.

 According to him, drug peddling is on the rise in the city but is not as rampant as in Mumbai and Delhi.

 ?There are some people who use code language to procure drugs in nightclubs,? the deputy commissioner stated. 

 The arrests of Mohammad Abdul and Rashid, both Bangladeshi nationals, in Tangra in February this year and their confessions made the cops focus on the city nightclubs, revealed an officer of the anti-narcotics wing of the detective department. 

 About 200 gm of cocaine and heroin were found on the arrested duo.

 ?The two confessed that they had been supplying drugs to people in the city. We found that some of their customers regularly organise late-night parties. We were on the trail of two such people, but they are absconding,? the officer added.

 Abdul and Rashid were also allegedly involved in a fake currency racket. 

 ?Interestingly, Abdul and Rashid were regulars at Calcutta parties and knew several people in the circuit well. The duo also had women clients,? said another officer.

 Data collated by the anti-narcotics wing indicates a rise in drug peddling in Calcutta. Several people have been arrested on the charge over the past month.

 ?Most of the drug peddlers in the city are women. The racket is deep-rooted. Bangladeshis smuggle drugs into India. The consignments are handed over to local agents, who distribute the narcotics among the peddlers,? explained the anti-narcotics wing officer. 

 ?We arrest the drug peddlers as they try to sneak into Bengal and impound the consignments. We later hand them over to the NCB. It is a major racket and NCB officers have to be more active to curb it,? observed the anti-narcotics wing officer.

 Cloud on Kalighat temple revamp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state government may have to return Rs 5 crore to the Centre following the Kalighat Temple Committees refusal to allow development work on the temple premises.

 State tourism minister Manab Mukherjee on Monday spelt this out after members of the committee failed to turn up for a meeting at Writers Buildings.

 I called this meeting to have a final word with the committee representatives. I wanted to know why they were not allowing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to start the work, but they did not turn up, stated Mukherjee.

 We have no clue about the plans of the government. Unless we are told the details of the project, we cannot allow anyone to start the construction work, countered Gopal Mukherjee, assistant secretary of the temple committee.

 In 2004, the state government had taken up the project that includes re-development and restoration of the temple, construction of an administrative building and other development work on and outside the temple premises. 

 The cost of the project was estimated at Rs 79 crore, of which the Centre provided its share of Rs 5 crore in April 2005. International Foundation for Sustainable Development, an organisation of NRIs, was to provide the rest of the funds.

 The first phase of the project, assigned to the CMC, comprises construction of the administrative building, 26 kiosks and re-development and restoration of the temple. Opposition by the temple committee stalled the work.

 We do not know why the temple committee is not allowing us to start work. We will not take away the temple; we will only complete the project and leave the temple to the committee, said the minister.

 In April 2006, the secretary of the tourism department had written to the committee, asking it to allow the CMC to begin work. The panel did not reply. The Centre has been asking the state government to either return the money or spend it for the purpose it was sanctioned.

 The tourism secretary will write to the committee once more, before the money is returned to Delhi. It has become difficult for us to explain why the money has not been used, remarked the minister.

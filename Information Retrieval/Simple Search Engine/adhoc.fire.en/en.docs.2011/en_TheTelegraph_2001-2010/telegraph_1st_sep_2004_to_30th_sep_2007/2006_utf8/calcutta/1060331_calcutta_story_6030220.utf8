 Helgas Fun 

 Castle which will perform at Someplace Else on April 

 1, in concert 

 The pub on Park Street remains 

 one of the sole live music destinations in the city. And 

 for the next two weekends, Someplace Else (SPE) is taking 

 a break from the staple diet of Doors and Pink Floyd covers, 

 and, instead, turning alternative.

 A Different Beat, starting April 

 1, will feature four different bands from Mumbai, 

 Chennai and Calcutta. 

 Were now in a position 

 to promote a particular kind of music, hence the alternative 

 approach, says Namrata Ray, assistant manager, events, 

 for The Park. 

 But alternative is 

 strictly for lack of a better term. 

 Its really some different 

 music than the night after night renditions of Roadhouse 

 Blues and Comfortable Numb. 

 Here are the bands?

 Helgas Fun Castle (April 

 1): A Mumbai-based jam band that often makes up songs 

 impromptu on stage, Helgas Fun Castle was originally 

 called Helgas Funk Castle but dropped the k 

 because we dont play funk, we play fun, 

 says founder member Siddarth Coutto. 

 The mini-supergroup 

 with seasoned musicians like Gino Banks will play music 

 without genre limitation at SPE and an ode specially 

 composed for the pub.

 Urban Reflections (April 8): 

 It began as a project by Debashish Banerjee and Sidhartho 

 Samadar in 2003. Now, city-based Urban Reflections is a 

 five-member set-up mixing eastern influences with elements 

 of jazz and R amp;B.

 Mystique (April 14): This 

 fusion band emerged out of Bangalore-based Amit Heri and 

 Mumbais Ravindra Chari performing together. 

 There will be a lot of on-the-spot 

 improvisation, promises band manager Vijay Nair.

 The Tribe (April 15): Gaurav 

 and Ujjaini usually perform as a duo in Chennai, with Gaurav 

 handling the guitar and every other sound via the laptop. 

 But the electronica outfit will 

 sport percussionists and a DJ for the first time at the 

 SPE gig.

 Puja vacation cut short

 - CU postgraduate holidays trimmed to a fortnight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In a departure from a 150-year-old tradition, Calcutta University has permanently trimmed the Puja holiday for postgraduate students down to less than a fortnight.

 To begin with, departments under the science, technology and agriculture faculties will cut down the vacation dates. The other faculties will follow suit from next year.

 Classes in most postgraduate courses of the science, technology and agriculture departments will be suspended on September 28 and will resume on October 9, after Lakshmi puja. Till last year, the classes commenced only after Kali puja and Bhai Phonta.

 The move, according to senior officials of the university, is aimed at increasing the number of class days in a year to improve academic quality.

 We have taken a number of steps to upgrade our postgraduate education system. For instance, we are trying to introduce the semester system in the postgraduate courses. More academic days are required under the changed system, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, dean, science faculty.

 A meeting of the members of the three faculties was held last week, at which the decision to cut short the vacation was taken. 

 Since the decision was taken so late, a relaxation is being offered for the first year. 

 If any department feels its students will not be able to rejoin classes on October 9, then it can fix a later date for resuming classes, stated an official.

 The libraries and laboratories of the university generally reopen after Lakshmi puja. 

 Teachers are also required to attend their departments after Lakshmi puja, but the vacation for the students continued till after Kali puja. Not any more.

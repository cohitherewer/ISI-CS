The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Zayed Khan You don?t reveal your feelings 

 to a person you don?t know well. When your trust is violated, 

 you move on without a backward glance. You are a good communicator, 

 with a clever use of words. Your discipline and determination 

 propel you forward. You do not mind spending lavishly on 

 luxury and comfort. You?ll go any lengths for sympathy and 

 affection. ? Kusum Bhandari

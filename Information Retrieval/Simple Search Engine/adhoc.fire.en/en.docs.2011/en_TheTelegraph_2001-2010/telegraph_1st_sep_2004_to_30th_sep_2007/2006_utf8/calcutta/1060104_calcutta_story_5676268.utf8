 Taxi runs over child out to play

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Little Gungun was afraid of speeding vehicles. The two-and-a-half-year-old girl would stand on the footpath and carefully scan the traffic before crossing a road. 

 Around 10.30 am on Tuesday, Gungun, out to play with her friend, did the same. On seeing a taxi approaching, she backed off the carriageway of Market Road, near New Market, yards away from her home. 

 The car, however, swerved towards the two children and ran over Gungun. 

 The youngest of three sisters and a brother, she was to join a nursery school in a few months. Witnesses stated the girl was crushed under the rear wheels of the cab and died instantly. At a distance and elsewhere in the city, children a little older continued to spread awareness on the road safety week.

 ?We saw it happen. The front wheels knocked her down and the rear wheels went over her back. Her friend screamed and a few people rushed out from the mosque nearby. By then, the girl was dead,? said Rafat Umar, who lives on Market Street.

 The footpaths on the street have been taken over by shop-owners and hawkers. They have even encroached on the carriageway, curtailing the space for vehicles. The taxi driver was trying to avoid another cab coming from the opposite direction when he ran over the girl.

 ?Since Gungun was afraid of speeding vehicles, I didn?t worry when she stepped out to play with her friends. I had prepared her food and was about to call her when I heard the news,? said Rina Mullick, the girl?s mother. 

 Around the same time, in another part of the city, another traffic mishap claimed 65-year-old Bansari Patra. She was hit by an iron pipe jutting out of a hand-pulled cart while crossing Sonarpur Road. Passersby took Patra to a local hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.

 In the afternoon, a motorcyclist was killed after being run over by a private bus on Maniktala Main Road.

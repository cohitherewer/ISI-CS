 Incentive for solar power

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 To help check pollution, the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency is planning to offer incentives to persuade municipalities to switch to solar power. 

 State power minister Mrinal Banerjee will convene a meeting of municipality chairpersons at Bidyut Bhavan on August 30 in this regard. 

 Apart from urging the municipalities to pay special attention to solar power, we will propose some incentives for the users, said S.P. Gan Chowdhury, director of the agency. He added that chairpersons of at least 70 municipalities would attend the meeting.

 At the meeting, the municipalities will be asked to sanction on a priority basis the plans of those buildings that will use solar power. 

 This process has already been started by the other states. The central government, too, offers subsidy to users of solar power. If the municipalities get into the act, everyone will benefit, stated Gan Chowdhury. 

 According to him, not only individuals, but municipalities, too, can avail of rebates by using solar-powered gadgets. Some of the items the municipalities can use include street lamps and traffic signals that run on solar energy. A 50 per cent discount is offered on these items.

 Use of these gadgets will help reduce the power bill. Moreover, if they switch to solar power, the municipalities will never face the problem of power cuts, the director signed off.

 In the past few months, the mosquito menace at Jadavpur University has increased manifold. The campus has become a happy hunting ground for swarms of mosquitoes with the bogs opposite to the Arts and the Science buildings their breeding ground. The university administration should immediately take some steps in this regard.

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Bhowanipore. 

 On two recent occasions, the staff at the New Market post office rejected my money order on the premise that my message to the payee exceeded 10 words. Nowhere in the form is it mentioned that the sender has to restrict his message to 10 words. There are, in fact, six lines marked as ?space for communication?. Would the postal authorities kindly inform me if there is actually such a rule which has not been mentioned anywhere in the form or was this a deliberate attempt to harass me? 

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur. 

 People have started using roadside trees for their personal and professional use. I have seen many people putting up steel plates, banners and posters for advertising their products and services and damaging the trees in the process. The government should take action to preserve trees.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Strum up a new sound

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 After five years of hard work 

 and a sound that brought to the Calcutta music scene a much-needed 

 breath of fresh air, Cassinis Division, the 

 only original alternative rock act from Calcutta, 

 is all set to record its first full-length album.

 With a number of major rock festivals, 

 demos and an EP under their belt and after making a mark 

 on the national stage with a high-voltage performance at 

 the Great Indian Rock (GIR) show, the members of Cassinis 

 Division (in picture) are hoping to strike the right chord 

 with the album.

 The Ringside View yes, thats what its called will have select material reflecting the bands ability to write a cohesive original album with different tempos and moods.

 It will be a loud and heavy album without sacrificing melody or the importance of lyrics, promises Rahul Guha Roy, frontman and vocalist of the band.

 Coming from very different musical backgrounds, the band members Rahul (vocals and guitar), Sukanti Roy (guitar), John Bose (bass) and Ritoban Das (drums) work together to produce a unique sound that is a mix of heavy alternative rock, nu-metal and rapcore.

 The album, slated to be ready for release by mid-December, is being recorded at Dream Digital Incorporated (off Southern Avenue) by Anirban Sengupta and Dipankar Chaki, and will be mastered by Martin Pullan of EdenSound Mastering (Melbourne, Australia), who has worked with bands like Deep Purple.

 The Ringside View will showcase popular originals like Drown, Caesar, Stay, Higher, Rumble and Glow-Worm, along with Only For a While, which got the band to the GIR finals in February 06.

 Apart from reaching their music to fans across India, Cassinis Division hopes that the album will help establish it as a live act and creative band, overseas. 

 Now that we have acquired some sort of national stature, we are looking to move into the Southeast Asian and West Asian markets, says Rahul. 

 The band has still not worked out a comprehensive distribution deal with any major record label. But the album is not a self-financed venture and a major part of the recording will be financed by someone who has faith in us with additional help from friends and family.

 Unlike other cities where the modern rock scene has revived over the past few years, Calcutta is still on the slow side. We hope that with this album the band will help Calcutta break out of the same old classic rock cycle and bring the city to the forefront of the modern music scene, says Prasanna Singh, IT professional and a fan of Cassinis Division. He was echoing the feelings of other Cassinis Division fans awaiting the debut album.

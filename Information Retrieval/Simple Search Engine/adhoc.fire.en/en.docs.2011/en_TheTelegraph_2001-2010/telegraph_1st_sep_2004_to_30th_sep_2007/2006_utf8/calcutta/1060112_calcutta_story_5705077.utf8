 CAR CRAWL: The congestion at the Howrah station approach. A Telegraph picture

 Driving to Howrah or Sealdah station will soon cease to be a nightmare, courtesy a proposed upgrade by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).

 A number of underpasses, foot over-bridges and pedestrian bays will be built at both stations. The pavements will be extended and a major road-repairing scheme taken up. The Sealdah flyover will have a flank that will connect it to the station. ?The adjoining areas of both stations will be undergo a complete facelift,? said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 ?We have conducted a survey at the stations and the final project report is being prepared,? he added. The report is likely to be ready by March. Once it is approved by all agencies involved ? the railways, CMDA and the state transport department ? the report will be presented before the National Urban Renewal Mission for funds.

 Railway officials have held talks with CMDA and assured it of ?all cooperation? in the project. The railways have their own plans to upgrade Howrah by setting up an underground parking lot and building a subway to the proposed Metro station.

 Both Howrah and Sealdah stations are the main entry points to the city, recording a daily footfall of around 10 lakh. ?There is already a severe traffic congestion on the station premises and the adjoining areas and it will keep increasing,? said an official of the state transport department.

 Unauthorised shops, food kiosks and other encroachments impede flow of traffic. With no bays or over-bridges for pedestrians, they are forced to walk across roads, causing further disruption of traffic. 

 ?The problem plagues both Sealdah and Howrah, and can be solved only if underpasses and foot over-bridges are constructed,? said an official.

 Officials fear congestion at Howrah station will increase manifold once Vivekananda Flyover, connecting the Howrah bridge to Dum Dum, is commissioned. The flyover will be constructed in seven phases. The first phase ? a 3.5-km stretch from the bridge ? is scheduled to be completed in one and a half years.

 In a move to de-clutter Howrah station, CMDA, police and the district administration had taken up an eviction drive in November last year. Squatters who had turned passenger shelters into kitchens and eateries were evicted. Some passenger sheds were taken over by food vendors and paan-sellers, who offered everything from snacks to drugs and hooch. Some were even allegedly involved in flesh trade.

 In spite of the rampant forces of hatred and violence prevailing in the world, love and understanding continue to be the cornerstone of human civilisation. Hariye Jai Manush, based on Albert Camus? The Just, makes an attempt to prove this point. A terrorist group plans to kill the local police chief and sends their most devoted, fearless activist on a mission to bomb him. But, when the terrorist sees that the children of the targeted policeman are next to their father, he is caught in a moral dilemma and cannot trigger the blast. When he returns to his hideout, he is subjected to severe inquisition. This leads to arguments on questions like what is right and wrong; what is just and what is not. In the ensuing conflict between ideology and reality, the focus is shifted to crimes against human dignity. Capital punishment, enforced by the state, also comes under criticism. The play ends with the realisation that, trapped in the vicious circle of animosity, man is in danger of losing his own humanity. Adaptation and direction: Kishore Sengupta.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Hariye Jai Manush, produced by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra

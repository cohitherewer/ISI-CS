The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Delhi prod on law flout by towers

 JAYANTA BASU

 Delhi has asked the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to detail the steps it has taken with regard to the alleged violation of a green norm by South City, Calcutta?s biggest housing project coming up on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

 A senior director in the Union ministry of environment and forest, N.H. Hosabettu, has written to the chairman of the state pollution control board (in a letter dated May 18), asking for an ?action taken report in the matter on priority?.

 The letter, marked ?most urgent?, appends a ?self-explanatory? report published in Metro on March 1 (?Key curb on mega estate?).

 When contacted on Monday afternoon, South City CEO Sanjay Choudhary said he was not aware of the letter from the Union ministry of environment and forest and so could not comment on the matter.

 The matter relates to the alleged failure of the project authorities to obtain the mandatory central clearance. 

 ?It has been, inter alia, alleged that the provision of 7 July 2004 EIA (Environment Impact Assessment) Amendment Notification has been violated by the project authorities,? writes Hosabettu.

 The notification, issued on July 7, 2004, states that any mega construction project must obtain central clearance, which includes a public hearing. According to the notification, ?new construction where work has not come up to the plinth level (by July 7, 2004) shall require the clearance?. 

 South City promoters claim the notification is not applicable to them, as they had obtained a no-objection certificate from the state pollution control board on November 7, 2003. Work started in March 2004, after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) issued the necessary approvals. 

 But South City?s revised plan was finally sanctioned by CMC on March 16, 2005.

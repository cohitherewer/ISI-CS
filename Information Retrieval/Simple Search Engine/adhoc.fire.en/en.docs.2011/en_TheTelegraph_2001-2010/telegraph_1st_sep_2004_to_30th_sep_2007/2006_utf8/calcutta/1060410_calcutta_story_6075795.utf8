 Three years, five new multiplexes, 23 new screens. Within five months of the curtains going up on Fame (Hiland Park), Shringar Cinemas has announced five more properties in Calcutta to come up in the next 36 months.

 From South City Mall on Prince Anwar Shah Road to Bus Terminus Mall in Rajarhat, the multiplexes are targeting both established and upcoming ?residential catchments? in the city.

 ?Calcutta is a large city with more than 13 million people and we believe that there should ideally be a multiplex every five km,? Shravan Shroff, manager director of Shringar Cinemas, told Metro during his weekend trip to town.

 ?Calcutta is going through an IT boom and witnessing a sharp rise in real estate prices. So, the market is large enough to accommodate more multiplexes and unless the locations get clustered, there is ample space,? he added.

 So, if the six-screen Fame (South City Mall) will open doors during the Pujas, four screens at Fame (Lake Mall) should be unveiled by April 2007. While construction work has already started at the five screens of Fame (Bus Terminus Mall), the four-screeners in Fame (Howrah) and Fame (Aster Mall, VIP Road) are in the planning stage.

 Apart from Calcutta shining, one of the main reasons why Fame has big plans for the city is the state government?s entertainment tax exemption policy. ?That makes business all the more profitable for us,? admitted Shroff.

 That Fame (Hiland Park) has got off to slow start hasn?t slowed Shroff and his team down in the east. ?We missed out on the Pujas and Diwali last year and entered the market in the bleakest period ? the third and fourth quarters ? of the year,? the Mumbai-based exhibitor explained. ?The average occupancy, which has been hovering around the 32 per cent mark, should go up to 50 per cent soon.?

 The expectations from the new properties are much higher, though. ?Hiland Park was always a futuristic property since the area wasn?t fully populated but for a Lake Mall or a South City Mall, we are expecting a busy start,? added Shroff. ?In fact, our target is 60 to 65 per cent occupancy straightaway.?

 The ticket pricing will remain low, but with some modification. ?Calcuttans might be price sensitive on weekdays but not on weekends,? said Shroff. ?We would cater to that mindset.?

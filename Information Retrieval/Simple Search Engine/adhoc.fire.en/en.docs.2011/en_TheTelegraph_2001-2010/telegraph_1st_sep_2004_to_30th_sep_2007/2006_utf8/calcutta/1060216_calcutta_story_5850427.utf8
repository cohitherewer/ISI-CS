The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Strike call for lax security

 - Traders complain of police apathy, see link with goons

 A STAFF REPORTER

 To protest the failure of the police to protect businessmen from extortion, the Federation of West Bengal Trade Association on Wednesday called a trade strike on March 31.

 The association alleged that even though the law and order situation in the city?s business districts like Burrabazar, Posta and Chitpur, had worsened, police were not taking measures to provide security to the traders.

 ?Abduction of businessmen, ransom demands and daylight robberies have become common. Police are playing the role of silent spectators even though they know that the situation is alarming,? said Mahesh Kumar Singhania, chairman of the association.

 He added: ?In the normal course of things, businessmen depend on lawkeepers for protection. They are now forced to arrange for their own security.? 

 Singhania asserted that at least 15 million traders would down shutters to observe the strike. 

 ?We are trying to garner the support of other unions on the issue of the strike,? he stated.

 Ram Lagan Mishra, another leader of the association, alleged: ?A trader in Burrabazar has to pay a minimum of Rs 5,000 to local extortionists if he wants to paint his business establishment. If we go to police to lodge a complaint, we are asked to sort out the problem mutually.?

 Businessmen of the Posta-Burrabazar belt have written to senior police officers a number of times, saying that the cops in police stations are not paying heed to growing incidents of extortion.

 ?Several policemen maintain relations with the goons. We have mentioned the names of the corrupt cops in our letters to the senior officers. Some of the officers were transferred,? said a Burrabazar businessman. 

 According to police records, at least 15 sub-inspectors of four police stations in central Calcutta have been transferred in the past six months after departmental inquiries.

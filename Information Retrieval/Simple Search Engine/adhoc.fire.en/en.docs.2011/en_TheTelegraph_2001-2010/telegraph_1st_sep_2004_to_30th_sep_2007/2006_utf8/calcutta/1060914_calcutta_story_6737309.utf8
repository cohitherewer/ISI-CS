 The state governments initiative to regularise projects that have come up illegally, encroaching on wetlands and farmlands (as reported in Metro on Tuesday), has the green lobby up in arms.

 Apart from demanding transparency from the government on the issue, environmentalists have threatened to move the Ramsar bureau, the Centre and even the court to ensure that the proposed amendment to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955, is not implemented. 

 Land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla, who had earlier toed a pro-wetlands line, had told Metro that his department was mulling an amendment to the act to give ex post facto approval to cases of land conversion.

 If the act is amended, then one only has to fill up a wetland and wait for ex post facto clearance, observed Dhrubojyoti Ghosh, who has won a United Nations award for pioneering work on the East Calcutta Wetlands. 

 Ghosh pointed out that regularising illegal constructions on the East Calcutta Wetlands would be a violation of a 1992 high court verdict and the Ramsar principle, which prohibits change in land use on the 12,500-hectare wetlands. There are about 294 documented violations of land use on the wetlands.

 Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC, whose public interest litigation led to the 1992 court order, said: It is a very serious matter and we want to crosscheck the details with different departments before deciding on a course of action.

 Environmentalist Mohit Roy, associated with NGO Basundhara, opined: This kind of message from the government will only encourage land sharks, who have either already filled up waterbodies or are in the process of doing so.

 He also called for a white paper from the government on the issue of wetlands. We often notice contradictory comments from ministers and officials about the policy to be adopted on wetlands. We want a white paper from the state. It should be prepared after consultation with all the stakeholders, including the NGOs.

 State director of WWF-India S.R. Banerjee, who has threatened to move court if the amendment materialises, said: We expect the state to be transparent. We will soon inform the appropriate forums about the development.

 Another environmentalist said amendment to the act might trigger changes in the ecological character of the East Calcutta Wetlands, leading to it losing its Ramsar site recognition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Water supply missing link 

 - Civic body hunt for contractor to lay underground tunnel

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The city that started laying an underground railway tunnel 30 years ago now cannot find a contractor who can lay a tunnel only 150 metres long and at six metres below the surface.

 In the absence of the tunnel, to be laid under the railway tracks and Boat Canal in Majherhat, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is unable to connect a 54-inch dedicated water mains from Garden Reach to the booster stations in Garfa, Kalighat and Ranikuthi.

 Residents of Tollygunge, Garfa, Ranikuthi and New Alipore, that fall within the command zone of the three booster stations, are pinning their hopes on Thursday?s scheduled meeting between the mayor and the railway ministry.The mayor will try and persuade the ministry to ask Rites, a subsidiary of Indian Railways, to undertake the project.

 While a lakh households in the New Alipore, Taratala and Prince Anwar Shah Road areas are supplied with filtered water almost round-the-clock, several lakhs in the command zones of the Ranikuthi, Kalighat and Garfa booster stations are getting water for hardly three hours a day.

 The civic body had floated a tender for laying the tunnel around 10 months ago. Two firms had responded. But one lacked technical eligibility and the other backed out, citing ?unfavourable soil condition?.

 The civic authorities then approached Rites, which, too, was reluctant to take up work.

 Left with no option, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya on December 21 had written to minister Lalu Prasad, requesting him to give necessary orders to Rites. 

 Acting on the plea, the railway ministry has fixed a meeting in Delhi with the mayor and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 According to chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity, around 30 million gallons of filtered water from Garden Reach are to be supplied daily to the underground reservoirs of the three booster pumping stations, from where the water will be distributed to households.

 ?We have installed the dedicated mains under Helen Keller Sarani, Rashbehari Avenue and SP Mukherjee Road, but it cannot be commissioned because of the 150-m missing link in Majherhat,? Maity said.

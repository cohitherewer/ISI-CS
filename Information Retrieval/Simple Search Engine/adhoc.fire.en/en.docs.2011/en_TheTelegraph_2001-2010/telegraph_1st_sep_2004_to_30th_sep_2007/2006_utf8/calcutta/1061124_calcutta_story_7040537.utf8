 What: Launch of a new showroom of PC Chandra. Where: 85A Chowringhee Road.

 When: Wednesday afternoon.

 Take a look: A gemstones throw away from the Elgin Road-Chowringhee Road crossing and close to the older PC Chandra showroom, this is the sixth PC Chandra outlet in town. The new outlet is comfortably spacious, spread across two floor levels and 3,000 sq ft. White is the dominant colour with mirrors used on the staircase and pillars to add to the space effect.

 Keeping the wedding season in mind, the store was launched with a host of traditional designs alongside contemporary patterns. The ground level exhibits an exclusive range of gold bangles, complete with meenakari and filigree work, fine chisel-work and coloured stone settings. The first floor showcases diamond jewellery alongside gold designs. For men, there are chains, studs, tie-pins and wristlets.

 Earlier, customers had to make do with the catalogue and it was difficult to visualise everything. Now, most of our designs are on display, said Indranil Paul, spokesperson for the jewellery brand.

 Pocket pinch: Sets of necklaces, rings and earrings start from Rs 40,000. More elaborate sets begin at Rs 70,000 and designer jewellery is priced at Rs 1,30,000-plus.

 Voiceover: Our new showroom will showcase contemporary jewellery, targeted at todays woman. It is our constant endeavour to design and keep in touch with fashion trends, says Amitava Chandra, director of PC Chandra amp; Sons (India) Pvt Ltd.

 Creative call

 What: Photo-Fun.

 Where: Chaat.in Kolkata on Camac Street.

 When: November 19 and 26, 11 am to 1 pm.

 Take a look: A photography appreciation workshop is being organised at the restaurant on two consecutive Sundays for kids between 8-15 years. Photographer Suvashis Mullick is guiding the young ones through the finer details of what lies behind a perfect photograph. The workshop will cultivate the creativity that is already within them, depending on their mood and the instrument, said Mullick.

 The best entries will make it to the final competition on November 30. A Chaat photo fun club will also be initiated after the workshop to sharpen the childrens skills and the most creative shots will be framed for a photo exhibition. Those more interested in food than thought can dig into a special offer of French Fries and Coke for Rs 20, besides the usual range of spicy snacks.

 Voiceover: November is a special month for children and photography is a good medium of expressing creativity; one that is not available easily as a subject to take up, said Pankaj Poddar, director, Chaat.in Kolkata.

 When: Show on October 31, 2 pm

 The theme: Titled Chocolate, the collection is all about indulgence. It talks about a woman who is not body-conscious and can gorge on chocolates without caring about the extra inches.

 Highlights: The theme is reflected in the silhouettes that evoke space through flow and volume. There are tunics, dresses and free-flowing skirts. The highlight of the line is the extensive use of silk jersey, specially developed and printed in Jaipur. Fine detailing, subtle embroidery and tone-on-tone textures embellish the clothes, with geometric patterns dominating. The colours are primarily off-whites and shades of greens, with sudden bursts of red and gold.

 Designerspeak: The collection talks about a womans personal space; a woman who doesnt want any form of intrusion in her space. Fashion is a reflection of ones state of mind and here we are working with personal tastes for greater comfort, indulging in the finer luxuries of life, says the duo.

 When: Show on November 1, 11 am.

 The theme: Titled Immortality, the collection tells the story of a girl who is in love and gradually through the show she loses her love.

 Highlights: The theme is portrayed primarily through the colour story that moves from happy pastels like peaches and greens to beiges and duller pastels. Pleats, embroidery, applique and other surface ornamentation decorate the clothes for the first part. It then moves on to structured garments with a rugged and deconstructed look, in keeping with the mood.

 Designerspeak: The collection has a happy part and a tragic part. It creates an impeccable paradise, a stage of ecstasy through an experience of completeness and balance and then it takes a drastic emotional turn, explains Abhishek.

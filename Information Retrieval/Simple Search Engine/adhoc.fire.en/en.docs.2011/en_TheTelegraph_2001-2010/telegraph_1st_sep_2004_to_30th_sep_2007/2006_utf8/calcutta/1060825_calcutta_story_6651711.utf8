 Civic body doubles levy

 - Calcutta gears up to greet the goddess

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities have set a Puja revenue collection target of Rs 1 crore this year. To achieve the objective, the Left Front board has doubled the levy from Rs 800 to Rs 1,600 for holding pujas in civic parks and by encroaching on roads or pavements. 

 The charges for putting up stalls in parks and on roads or pavements during Puja have also been increased.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) collects about Rs 30 lakh as charges from puja committees, but spends about Rs 3 crore on post-Puja restoration of parks, roads and pavements.

 Community Durga puja is a Rs 100-crore extravaganza in Calcutta and I dont think a hike in the one-time charge from Rs 800 to Rs 1,600 merits a discussion, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Thursday.

 Leader of the civic Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan and Congress leader Pradip Ghosh countered that Rs 1 crore might mean nothing to the CMC, but the move reflects the anti-people attitude of the CPM.

 According to civic estimates, about 40 per cent of Puja revenue is not collected due to various reasons. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has directed chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose, chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar and deputy chief engineer (parks and gardens) Soumitra Bhattacharya to closely monitor the collection of levy from community pujas to meet the new target.

 Most of the 1,100 community pujas are organised on civic property. We want to realise a percentage of our expenditure on restoring these properties, said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

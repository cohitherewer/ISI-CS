The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Signal of pleasant weather 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Here come the rains. The Met office on Tuesday said the weak monsoon current over Calcutta and the rest of Gangetic Bengal was becoming strong once again, and the weather is expected to remain pleasant over the next 48 hours.

 Officers said the sky over Calcutta and the south Bengal districts was likely to remain cloudy, following formation of a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) on Monday over the Bay of Bengal adjoining Andhra Pradesh.

 ?This cyclonic circulation has helped start the process of reviving the monsoon current over Gangetic Bengal. The sky over Gangetic Bengal is expected to remain cloudy, with scattered rainfall over south Bengal, including Calcutta, during the next 24 hours,? said G.C. Debnath, director of weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore.

 Debnath indicated that the city will enjoy a respite from the heat and humidity.

 Officers stressed that even though the monsoon was expected to become active, it would not immediately be vigorous in Bengal. ?We do not expect very heavy rain in Gangetic Bengal during the next two or three days. The cyclonic circulation is expected to cause more rains in the southern part of the country than Bengal,? an officer said.

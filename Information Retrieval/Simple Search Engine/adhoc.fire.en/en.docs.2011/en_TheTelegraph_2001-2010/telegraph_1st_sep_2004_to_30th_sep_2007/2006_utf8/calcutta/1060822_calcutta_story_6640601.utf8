 Pandey The Rising

 A film on Rani Lakshmibai after one on Mangal Pandey did 

 you always have films on these two historical characters 

 in mind?

 When I started working on Mangal 

 Pandey, I realised that the entire gamut of incidents 

 that formed the revolt of 1857 was too broad to be accommodated 

 in a single film. For me the year 1857 was very important. 

 An entire way of life was being turned upside down. It was 

 a very major upheaval that forever changed the course of 

 history. It was the most violent rebellion ever, the only 

 time that Hindus and Muslims fought together, and it was 

 widespread in its influences.

 The British had to downplay its 

 impact which is why they called it the Sepoy Mutiny. Thus 

 a single film would never be able to capture the revolt 

 in its entirety. Thats when I planned this trilogy Mangal 

 Pandey, Rani Lakshmibai, and a third film on the situation 

 in Delhi at the time and Bahadur Shah Zafar. 

 What does Rani Lakshmibais character mean to you?

 Rani Lakshmibai is for me a living 

 legend. She is one of the most volatile characters in history, 

 very fascinating and charismatic. She is representative 

 of the various strands of Indian life at the time.

 There has been talk of Aishwarya Rai playing the title role. 

 Has she been signed?

 I am still working on the script. 

 The cast will be finalised only after the script has been 

 completed. But yes, we have had talks with Aishwarya. Rani 

 Lakshmibai is a much more ambitious project than Mangal 

 Pandey, much bigger.

 Werent you apprehensive about taking up another historical 

 project after the controversy sparked by Mangal Pandey?

 So little was known of Mangal 

 Pandey. Our sense of history is more oral and folklorish. 

 But theres more matter to reconstruct Rani Lakshmibais 

 life.

 So will Rani Lakshmibai be more factual in its presentment 

 or will it again be very filmi, complete with song 

 and dance?

 There will be variations in presentation, 

 but that doesnt mean I will do away with music. Music is 

 a part of our lives. I am a storyteller and some deviation 

 is inevitable when one is trying to dramatise an incident. 

 Certain areas will be condensed and others dealt with in 

 detail. For example, my focus being on the period of 1857, 

 the narrative will revolve more around that part in the 

 queens life.

 Yes, films do create legends, 

 make larger-than-life characters, but I think legends are 

 as important as facts. Legends are what people remember, 

 cherish and pass on down the generations. I think film-makers 

 should be allowed some creative license.

 So, was introducing Rani Mukherjees character in Mangal 

 Pandey just a matter of creative license?

 Both Mangal Pandeys and Ranis 

 characters have symbolic value for me. While Mangal Pandey 

 was a symbol of the spirit of independence, Ranis character 

 stood for the Indian conditions at the time.

 Recreating the lives of historical characters must be terribly 

 challenging. Where do you draw the line between fact and 

 fantasy?

 Sure, it is challenging, it brings 

 with it a lot of responsibility, but thats what makes it 

 interesting. I have to present it in a way that I make sense 

 to the present generation.

 You made contemporary films like Maya Memsaab and 

 Oh Darling! Yeh Hai India. Now you seem immersed 

 in history. Arent you afraid of being typecast by your 

 phases?

 I work on multiple projects at 

 the same time. At present, in addition to the film on Rani 

 Lakshmibai, I am working on a science fiction and a film 

 called Rang Rasiya based on the life of painter Raja 

 Ravi Verma. They are all in various stages of planning and 

 development.

 You have said before that digital technology in cinema is 

 an emerging field. You have also founded the Maya Academy. 

 Yet, the kind of digital work being used in Hindi films 

 is not up to the mark...

 The reason why Western countries 

 are outsourcing work to us is because of the cost effectiveness. 

 But, of course, we are far below their standards. We are 

 just starting, while they have a long history in digital 

 technology. We have a long way to catch up. When the West 

 outsources work, its only our labour that they are using. 

 The expertise is still theirs. But we Indians are very quick 

 in absorbing and adapting to new technology. We will catch 

 up very fast in terms of technical quality and even start 

 developing our own content soon.

 In today?s global economy, organisations have an increasing responsibility to facilitate, demonstrate and promote corporate social responsibility (CSR). There is a critical need for active involvement by businesses of all sizes towards achieving poverty alleviation and sustainable development.

 ?Social entrepreneur, responsible business campaigner and writer? David Grayson made the points in a lecture at the British Council on Tuesday on CSR and its impact on the current socio-economic scenario. 

 ?CSR means open and transparent practices that are based on ethical values and respect for the employees, community and the environment,? explained Grayson. He is of the opinion that CSR is designed to deliver sustainable value to society at large, as well as to shareholders.

 The corporate guru cited the example of one of the biggest brands in the world, Wal-Mart, which has declared that it will only use renewable energy henceforth. The retail behemoth also plans on only making or retailing products that sustain both resources as well as the environment.

 Grayson had words of hope for those who believe that with global giants moving towards Indian shores, the environment and business practices may suffer. ?There is an economic revolution taking place in this country and I find no reason to suspect that ?green? norms will not be followed here. Corporate governance is undergoing a huge change, with CSR playing a major role in most policy decisions.?

 He emphasised revolution of markets, global connectivity and an ongoing demographic revolution as key drivers for greater CSR. ?Business is now far more significant with regard to the current geographical, political and social scenario than anything else. Global brands are more careful about their CSR than they were a few decades back.? 

 Grayson also attributed the improvement in CSR to better connectivity. According to him, connectivity can be used to mobilise opinion against harmful corporate behaviour.

 He ended with the expectation that Indian Inc. is going to follow the lead of companies all over the world that are taking CSR very seriously.

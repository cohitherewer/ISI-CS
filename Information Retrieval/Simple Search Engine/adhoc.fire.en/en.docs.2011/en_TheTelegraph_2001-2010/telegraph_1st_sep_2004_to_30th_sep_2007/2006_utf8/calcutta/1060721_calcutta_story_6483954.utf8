 Nothing but two tinted glasses 

 in a plastic or metal frame, but the impact a mere pair 

 of sunglasses can have on your style statement, is something 

 else.

 Make an impression on the hot 

 babe in college, get your female colleagues drooling over 

 you, enjoy that extra edge over the popular para dude, 

 hit the sand or the slope for a holiday in style? If your 

 wish-list happens to feature any of the above, shades are 

 a must-have.

 The message, today, is loud and 

 clear ? if its shades, make sure its yesterdays. 

 From Mission Impossibles Tom Cruise and his 

 classic aviator style to Bollywood heartthrob Abhishek Bachchans 

 huge pair of rectangular glasses in Bluffmaster, the 

 70s and 80s are in.

 GoodLife helps you track 

 some of the hottest pairs in town.

 Tech take

 Are you a gizmo freak? Are you 

 a wannabe James Bond, manipulating hi-tech gadgets, cool 

 and sexy?

 For the tech crazy, shades from 

 US brand Oakley featuring in-built MP3 is the perfect pick. 

 While the look in solid black and the rims a big, broad 

 rectangle is retro, the mini extendable speakers add to 

 the sci-fi feel.

 The MP3 capacity is 256 MB. The 

 flip-up lenses are made of plutonite and maximise protection 

 against harmful UVA, UVB and UVC rays. 

 The price tag reads Rs 15,975.

 PS: For the complete hunk 

 makeover, make sure you know your goggles inside out. A 

 goof-up while flaunting it in front of your femme fatale 

 would be a real shut-eye.

 Style Big B

 Do you eat, sleep and drink Big 

 B and his movies? Chances are you are bowled over by his 

 suave style statements, too. In no way can you miss the 

 red-and-black glass frame Amitabh Bachchan is seen sporting 

 in the to-be-released Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna posters. 

 So shades from Prada are the ones 

 to watch out for this season. The frame is a modified aviator 

 with thin rims. The broad twin plastic temples are in red 

 and black with a dash of silver thrown in. The glass tinge 

 is a sober dark grey.

 The price tag reads Rs 14,000.

 PS: Dont overdo things. 

 Okay, you are a Bachchan fan but keep it strictly to the 

 glasses.

 Mix amp; match

 Plastic and metal combos 

 a current rage in shade style. Choose from Italian label 

 Diesel. The temple is a cool combination of white plastic 

 and black metal. 

 The lens is a mesh of deep purple 

 and grey. The retro look is accentuated with the biggish 

 square frame. Clearly, a piece that suits all age groups.

 The price tag reads Rs 7,000.

 PS: A black trouser and 

 a white tee or vice versa is a complete no-no. To avoid 

 the 101 Dalmatians image, pepping yourself up with 

 a colourful dress code is a definite must to complete the 

 look.

 Wrap em up

 If flamboyant is more your style, 

 go for rimless metal wraps. With broad self-embossed handles, 

 oversized square rims and an unusual medium grey tinge, 

 the sunglasses from the Gucci stable have loads of character 

 and attitude. 

 The fit is snug. The upper rims 

 are embellished with tiny metal beads add character, to 

 match both casual and party wear.

 The price tag reads Rs 11,000.

 PS: It goes well with your 

 party garb but do not forget to tuck them away when indoors 

 or at night. Remember, you are not the Bollywood 

 bad boy.

 Be different

 Aviator glasses are a rage. Bachchan 

 junior aka Roy the rover in Bluffmaster looked 

 hot in them. So does Saif Ali Khan going in about-to-be-released 

 Omkara.

 While everybody else flaunts brownish 

 aviators, add your personalised bit with big shaded aviators 

 from the Italian brand Vogue. 

 The mirror-coated lenses come 

 in a cool greenish copper shade. The rims in sparkling silver 

 match perfectly. 

 Call them reflectors if you like; 

 they sure earn you special partner points as they double 

 as makeshift mirrors for her fringes and careless strands 

 to stay in place.

 The price tag reads Rs 4,900. 

 PS: Make sure you co-ordinate 

 your dress right. An orange tee or a red shirt with your 

 greenish copper shades and you could end up looking like 

 Govinda No. 1.

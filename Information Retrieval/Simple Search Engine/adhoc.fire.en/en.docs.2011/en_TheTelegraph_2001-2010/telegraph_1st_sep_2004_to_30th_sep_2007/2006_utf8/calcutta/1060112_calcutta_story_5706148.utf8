 What: Exhibition of bridal wear by Bandhej and Sonia Mahajan.

 Where: Moksh at 22, Camac Street.

 When: Between January 12 and 14, 11 am to 7 pm.

 The exhibition: Showcases creations by designer Naina Jain of the label Bandhej and Sonia Mahajan from Kashmir. The highlights of Nainas collection are her trademark bandhej saris, lehngas and dupattas. The tie-and-dye motifs adorn the creations in rich silk. Also on offer are traditional Ghatcholas and Panetar saris. While the bandhej and Ghatcholas come in shades of red as well as in lighter hues, the Panetars are in combinations of white and red.

 A new offering from Naina is the mix-and-match sari, where the tie-and-dye is combined with various embroidery forms like kantha, chikankari, zardosi, mukesh, gota and more. Sonia, on the other hand, displays a range of saris, salwar suits and shawls with traditional Kashmiri motifs and embroidery techniques.

 Pocket pinch: The Bandhej saris start around Rs 5,000 and the lehngas come for Rs 20,000-plus.

 Voiceover: The bandhej sari traditionally features in most north Indian weddings. While for Gujaratis its a must to get married in Panetar saris, for other communities the Ghatcholas and other forms of bandhej form at least some part of their wedding attire. This exhibition offers bandhej saris in many different forms, targetting the bridal season that starts from mid-January, says Naina.

 Night fair

 What: Kingfisher Saturday Night Bazaar.

 Where: Victoria Lawn, The Stadel.

 When: 6.30 pm to 10.30 pm on January 7. The event will hit the lawns every first Saturday of the month, throughout the year.

 The event: A warm ambience that was quite a contrast to the chilly winter evening last Saturday. 

 A beautifully done up setting with tiny colourful bulbs along with all-white tables and chairs awaited the guests.

 A guitarist played softly in the background while a fire-eater added a dash of adventure.

 Oil paintings aesthetically done, pretty party bags embellished with stones, masks, innovative calendars with a glass-painted top, and photo-frames were all on offer.

 The stalls surrounding the open space were home to a variety of artistically done-up goodies. While the women folk were drawn to the mehndiwallah, kids sported unicorn, dolphin, mermaid and dragon tattoos from the tattoo maker.

 Sip n bite: An assortment of Indian delicacies that included Fish Methi Masala, Aloo Do Piaza, Kali Dal and a live counter serving Chicken, Aloo and Gobi Kebab. One could taste eternal roadside favourites like papri chaat, aloo tikka and phuchka too. Sweet lovers could dig into hot Gulab Jamun, while the drinks counter served Kingfisher pint beer, draught beer, rum and soft drinks.

 Voiceover: It is a complete family event where the idea is to let the guests relax, enjoy some good food and look around the interesting items on offer. This Saturday fun-filled affair is a great way to get into the holiday mood, said Anil Bhutoria, director of The Stadel.

 New eatery

 What: The soft launch of Bouquet Garni, restaurant-cum-lounge bar.

 When: December 27.

 Where: The Enclave at 17/1 F, Alipore Road. 

 Capacity: Bouquet Garni is a 56-cover restaurant with the lounge bar packing in 38 more. The terrace is hired out for small parties.

 Decor: The USP of the restaurant and lounge is the decor. The white lights discreetly provide a water wave effect on the walls. In the lounge bar we have experimented with colour lights and 

 aser beams, says DJ Feroze, whose company Sequence has done the sound and lights for the restaurant.

 Sip bite: The multi-cuisine restaurant dishes out food from various corners of the world. 

 We do not want to brand Bouquet Garni as an eatery specialising in a particular cuisine. We intend to open branches in the upcoming malls of the city. The restaurant serves Japanese, Lebanese, Chinese, pan-Asian, Indian and Thai, says owner Suresh Kondui.

 The entire terrace is under our control where one can hold private parties. We also intend to put up a barbecue that would be a hit with the party people during winters, he adds. 

 Home stop

 What: The launch of Urban Village. 

 Where: Swabhumi, The Heritage Park.

 The store: The collection at the store comprises masks of animals, gods and goddesses, demons and characters of daily life made out of locally available seasoned wood.

 Knick-knack holders, containers, planters, lamps, figurines and many more such things in wood are inspired by tribal folk art and happenings from daily life.

 so look out for beautiful bags created out of sitalpatti mats and merged with silk and denim, making for the perfect party accessory. On offer are chic and cute bags of leather in vibrant colours with exclusive in-house designs.

 The dokra products available here are also worth a look, particularly the Ganesha collection featuring different styles in candle stands, door handles, photo frames and pen stands.

 But the real steal is the Tribal Sarangi lampshade made of seasoned wood, complete with wooden carvings. Voiceover: Urban Village was born out of a yearning to connect with our roots. Our journey to the heartland of Bengal led us to the discovery of our rich tradition of handlooms and folk art. And our store aims at transforming these rich craft items into beautiful products to suit modern tastes. Our designers regularly interact with artisans and craftsmen from the rural areas so that the crafts retain the beauty, simplicity and energy of these art forms. Our products are also very affordably priced, says store proprietor Dina Dutta Sarkar. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start as low as Rs 50 per piece and could go up to a few thousand.

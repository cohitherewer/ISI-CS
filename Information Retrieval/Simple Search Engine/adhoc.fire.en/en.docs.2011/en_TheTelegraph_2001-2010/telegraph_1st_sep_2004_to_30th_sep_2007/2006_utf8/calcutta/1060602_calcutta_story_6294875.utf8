 and The Da Vinci Code 

 The results of the Friday big fight are out ? Bollywood has beaten Hollywood; formula fare has scored over complex code; a standalone surge has stumped multiplex mania.

 On May 26, Fanaa and The Da Vinci Code both opened big at the city theatres ? the Kunal Kohli melodrama at single screens alone and the Ron Howard blockbuster at the multiplexes plus standalone theatres.

 And while the first seven days have seen the Aamir-Kajol-starrer rewrite many a box-office record at the traditional Calcutta halls, the Tom Hanks movie has had a mixed response after the controversy-driven hype.

 ?Menoka, Elite and Hind have together raked in more than Rs 50 lakh in the first week,? reveals Pritam Jalan, Fanaa?s Bengal distributor. ?This is easily the biggest opening ever, topping the collections of heavy grossers like Mohabbatein and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. And with more than 80 per cent of the revenues ? taxes and service charges go to the halls ? coming to us, not releasing the film at multiplexes has been beneficial for us.?

 The tide seems to have turned at standalone theatres struggling to compete with the plexes. ?Fanaa has proved that we still exist and are not totally dispensable,? says Menoka owner Pranab Ray. ?The distributors have realised that when it comes to a big movie, it helps to go big with single screens. Not only has Fanaa?s first week been extraordinary, the advance bookings for the second week are also very strong.?

 The Da Vinci Code trail in the city has been lukewarm, with the Hindi version going cold. ?We came in with eight prints in Calcutta which is a first for an English film,? says Arijit Dutta, east India distributor of Code. ?The response has been good, if not great, with around 75 per cent net collections. Had the film arrived on May 19, it would have done better.?

 The multiplexes, though, aren?t complaining. Says INOX (Forum) general manager Vikas Syal: ?We haven?t had morning shows of English movies going full so consistently before Code. Advances having opened last Thursday, achieving 95 per cent occupancy throughout the first week is quite incredible. We will continue to go big with Code, screening six shows a day in Week Two too.?

 The other hall happy with the popular response to the Dan Brown adaptation is the state-run Nandan, where the film enjoyed a simultaneous release. ?Saturday and Sunday have seen house-full shows. The weekdays had around 85 per cent occupancy, which is as good as the Rang De Basanti turnout. The film is definitely on through the next week,? says Nandan CEO Nilanjan Chatterjee.

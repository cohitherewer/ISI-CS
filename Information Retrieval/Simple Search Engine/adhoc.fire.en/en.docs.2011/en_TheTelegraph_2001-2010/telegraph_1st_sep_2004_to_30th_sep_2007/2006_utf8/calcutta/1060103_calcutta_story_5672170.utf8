 Conserve pitch in year of biology

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After a year of physics, it?s time for a bit of biology ? 2006 has been designated as the Year of Biodiversity by the Indian government. 

 ?All living things fall in the category of biodiversity,? explains Jayanta Sthanapati, director, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM).

 True to form, having celebrated 2005 in style, with a series of projects and programmes on the science of physics and its practitioners, the museum is set to commemorate this year?s theme, too. The focus is on creating awareness, and the message is conservation.

 ?We have to make people realise that conservation is not just for the villages and jungles. It is also necessary in the cities. That is what we will help the students understand,? says Sthanapati.

 The programme kicks off on January 3, with a science march, comprising schoolchildren carrying posters, placards, charts, etc, to spread the preservation word. 

 The walk will begin at 8 am from the West Gate of Park Circus Maidan, pass through Syed Amir Ali Avenue and finally arrive at BITM, on Gurusaday Road, where a variety of educational programmes have been arranged throughout Tuesday. 

 Around 3,000 students from different schools have confirmed participation. 

 Through the year, a series of events have been lined up. There will be around two lectures every month on the subject by eminent experts in the field, in the newly-inaugurated auditorium at the museum. 

 An exhibition is also on the cards. ?But we haven?t planned that yet. It should be up around June,? the director adds.

 The big bang will be the quiz, with students from the eastern region, and perhaps from around the country, says Sthanapati. 

 Plus, there will be a string of competitions on the theme of biodiversity ? sit-and-draw, fancy dress, essay-writing, extempore talk, open house quiz, science drama and seminars with children as the participants.

 ?There is a degradation of nature by people, which is bad for the environment and for us. We have to prevent that, and protect all living things. We have to teach the students about the importance of conservation,? signed off Sthanapati.

 The subject of biodiversity includes all life forms in every species, from micro-organisms, flora and fauna to plant, animal and human life. 

 Protecting the biodiversity within an ecosystem is necessary to sustain any environmental policy, believe most scientists and environmentalists.

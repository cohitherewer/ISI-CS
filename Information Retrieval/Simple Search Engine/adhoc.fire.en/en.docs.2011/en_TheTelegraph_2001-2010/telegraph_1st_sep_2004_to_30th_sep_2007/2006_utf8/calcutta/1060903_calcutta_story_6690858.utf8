 Four design stalwarts showing back to back in a span of five hours Indian fashion doesnt get bigger than this. The second half of Day III of the India Fashion Week Spring Summer at The Grand in New Delhi was truly star-studded, with Rina Dhaka, JJ Valaya, Tarun Tahiliani and Rocky S unveiling their spring-summer 2007 offerings, one after the other.

 The ultra-feminine mood of the first two days continued through the whole of Friday, with a soft palette of whites and ivories dominating the ramp. The day started off with young designer Varun Bahl showing an impressive line titled Middle Age. Varuns collection with the message be who you really are boasted clean lines, pleats, beaded prints, pinks, lilacs, greens and ivories.

 Rina Dhaka was her usual self: super-sexy and glam diva. A specially developed handmade lace was the highlight of the collection that also extensively used mirror work, Kutch work, patchwork, crystals, crochet, cutwork and sequins. Straight cuts were teamed with flowing silhouettes a plethora of knee-length dresses (tube, cupped, balloon and more), tops, skirts, summer jackets.

 With white and beige as the base colours, the line also saw lots of oranges, yellows, denims, purples and other bright hues. Nets, laces, chiffons, georgettes, voile and silk lycra shaped the clothes. The wow element: a line of bikinis with patchwork, bandhni and gold sequins.

 The Valaya show, stripped of the usual drama that accompanies the designers ramp affairs, displayed his collection named The Flowers of the Balkans. Inspired by Albania, the land of romantic remoteness and great natural beauty, the line was split into three parts a vibrant colour story of reds, oranges and purples giving way to a black-and-white palette and eventually moving on to relaxed neutrals. Variety was truly the name of the Valaya game as the three lines presented three distinct looks.

 The silhouettes comprised an array of dresses, skirts from floor-dusters to minis, tops from fitted shirts to ponchos, slim pants and saris. The men sported summer jackets, shirts and slim ankle-length pants. The general look was rich with detailed prints, antique embroidery, varied textures and beaten metal work.

 Tarun Tahilianis show was a lengthy affair, launching the designers new line tt Tarun Tahiliani Everyday Wear alongside his spring-summer 2007 range titled Summer Breeze. True to the name, the clothes were soft and breezy with a summer feel. Divided into distinct lines, the show opened with the signature Tarun Tahiliani range. Drawing influences from tulips and laces, the dreamy line of soft pastels and elegant whites comprised summer jackets alongside saris, lehngas and draped kurtas.

 The Diffusion Line of semi-casual garments inspired by Mughal architecture used the designers trademark prints peppered with pearl and stone applique, mirror work and sequins. Shirt dresses, stretch shorts, cropped tees, panelled skirts, bolero jackets and jodhpurs made up the womens line, while the men walked in linen pants, dinner shirts and formal jackets. The much-awaited Everyday Wear of all-whites touched with black was made up of a line of trendy mix-and-match shirts, pants, shirt dresses, kurtas, tunics, capris, slips and camisoles.

 The final show of the day Rocky S displayed the designers line of higher pret called Noir. Ivory, ecru, beige and nude, with accents of pastel pink, green, teal, peach and lemon coloured the dreamy collection. The relaxed feel was complemented by the soft, flowing, body-caressing silhouettes embellished with laces, applique and embroidery. Pleats, scallops, layers and satin tie-ups accentuated the feminine look. Nets, chiffons, georgettes and brocade made up the fabrics. The silhouettes were pretty much the seasons favourites dresses of varying length, balloon skirts, mid-length pants, tunics and more.

 If only: some of the garments would look less sleepwear.

 Delhi offers vaccine, swift action

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A control room for reporting bird flu cases in Bengal, other parts of eastern India, the Northeast and the Andamans has been set up. Information on cases can be provided over telephone (033-25565021) or faxed to the University of Animal Resources and Fishery Sciences in Belgachhia at 033-25565476.

 The Centre on Monday assured the state government of all possible support in supply of medicines and vaccines to deal with any detection of avian flu cases.

 ?The Union government has promised us it will fly in medicines and vaccines within 24 hours of a bird flu case being reported in Bengal. If required, it will send an aircraft and a rapid response team to tackle the situation,? said state health secretary Kalyan Bagchi.

 Bagchi was speaking after a videoconference with director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research N.K. Ganguly and Union additional health secretary Dipak Gupta.

 The state health secretary stressed that there was no cause for panic, since not a single case of avian flu in human beings has been reported in the country. 

 ?To date, only poultry workers have died of bird flu; no one has died after eating meat. The disease is not transmitted through cooked food. It is safe to eat chicken and egg, if they are cooked at over 70 degrees Celsius,? stressed Bagchi.

 He added that anything coming in contact with raw meat should be washed thoroughly with hot water and soap.

 ?An isolation ward is ready at Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital to house patients if there is an outbreak. We?re equipped with protective gear for handling poultry.? 

 The chief minister later said adequate measures had been taken. ?We?ve identified the major poultry centres, where surveillance has been stepped up. Regular tests will be carried out on the birds,? said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

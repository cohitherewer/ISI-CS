 Licence bar for law flout 

 - Monitor for eatery fare

 You may have weekend dinner with your family and friends or drinks at a glitzy restaurant or bar. You may be lured by the mouth-watering dishes in a fine ambience. But how safe is the food you eat? How hygienic is the restaurant or the bar?

 Alarmed at the rising number of complaints about unhygienic kitchens and unscientific washing of utensils in some eateries in the city, the bar and restaurant-owners have proposed a change in the licence renewal system and introduction of a stricter vigil.

 ?We have told the government to form a monitoring committee, comprising representatives of the Union tourism ministry, state tourism department, police, civic body, health department, All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, excise department and bar and restaurant-owners.

 The panel will oversee functioning of hotels, bars and restaurants and will take action on the spot if any irregularity is detected,? said S.K. Khullar, vice-president of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India (FHRAI). ?The committee will function as a watchdog and ensure that bars and restaurants are run in accordance with the law.??

 Excise secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar said the government had agreed in principle to accept the proposal and that he will soon convene a meeting with the federation.

 Now, the renewal of a licence of a bar or restaurant is just a formality ? the excise department grants it against a fee and a ?no-objection?? certificate from police. It is not ascertained whether the owner is abiding by the rules.

 There is a committee of officials from the Centre and the state tourism department that looks after star hotels and decides on any proposal for upgrade in the status.

 The panel does not interfere in the functioning of small and medium hotels, bars and restaurants.

 ?Our proposal is that the excise department and police seek the opinion of the monitoring committee before renewing a licence. The system will force bar and restaurant-owners to follow the rules and regulations, because the licences will not be renewed in case of a violation,? said S.S. Kothari, president of the Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India.

 There is a model specification, fixed by the federation in consultation with the tourism department, on kitchen, toilet, furniture, seating arrangement, interior decoration, washing system, waste disposal, food quality, cooking procedure and the way the food is served.

 The dress and the health of the waiters, too, are well defined. It is mandatory for the owners of bars and restaurants to follow the specifications.

 ?But we have received a number of complaints that some owners are not abiding by the rules. We want to stop the practice. Our aim is to satisfy customers by providing proper services,? Khullar asserted.

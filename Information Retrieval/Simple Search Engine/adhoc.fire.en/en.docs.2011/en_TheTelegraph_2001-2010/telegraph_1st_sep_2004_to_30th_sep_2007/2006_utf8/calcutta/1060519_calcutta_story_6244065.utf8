The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 You 

 have a special talent to grasp things clearly and objectively. 

 You are always in search of something new and different. 

 You are gentle and easygoing. Competition scares you. You 

 have a knack for flowing right in and taking an important 

 chair. Your natural way of working, without any direct confrontation, 

 makes others want to follow you. ? Kusum Bhandari

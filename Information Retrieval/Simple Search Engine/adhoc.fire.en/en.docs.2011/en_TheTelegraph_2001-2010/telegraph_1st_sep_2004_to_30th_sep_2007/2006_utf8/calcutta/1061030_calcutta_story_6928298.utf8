 An incredible diagnosis

 Delving into the deep recesses of the human psyche, Haroon-al Rashid is a comic satire that seeks to understand human psychology and uncover reasons for apparently eccentric human behaviour. Written by Mohit Chattopadhyay, the play introduces us to Jadupati Biswas, an elderly man with a gentle and sympathetic nature. His wife, Charu, is anxious and distressed as her husband suffers from strange hallucinations. Jadupati imagines himself to be Haroon-al Rashid, the legendary Khalifa of Baghdad, who was renowned for his munificence. So, he too has become charitable, giving away his money and possessions to those less fortunate. Thinking that her husband is mentally deranged, Charu seeks her brothers advice, who recommends a psychiatrist to handle Jadupatis case. The doctors diagnosis, however, baffles Charu and her brother all the more. With a surprising revelation as its climax, the play offers an eye-opening indictment on modern-day fears and insecurities. Direction: Samir Biswas.

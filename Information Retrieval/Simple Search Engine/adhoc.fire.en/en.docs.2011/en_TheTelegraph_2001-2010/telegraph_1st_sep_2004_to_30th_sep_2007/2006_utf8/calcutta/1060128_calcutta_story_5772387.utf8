 Booty taken in a chicken

 PRONAB MONDAL

 A murgh masallam, stuffed with spices, came in handy for a restaurant employee to smuggle out Rs 20,000.

 In an operation that had stumped sleuths, Mohammad Zakir Hussain, who worked in an Esplanade eatery famous for its Punjabi cuisine, cleaned out the money from the cash box and stuffed it into the roasted chicken after scooping out the masala stuffing. 

 He then took home the chicken.

 ?We have never come across a similar case,? said an officer of New Market police station. ?After the restaurant lodged a complaint, we had no clue who the culprit could be and how he could have walked away with the money.?

 The restaurant authorities noticed the theft on Tuesday night. They immediately summoned all 15 employees and frisked them. 

 ?The effort drew a blank. They even searched the employees? belongings and the kitchen, but nothing was found. The same when the employees were frisked the second time,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central). 

 A police attempt to crack the case by grilling the employees, together and individually, too, went in vain.

 The first lead emerged on Wednesday, when the officers were questioning the restaurant authorities about the facilities they offer to the staff. 

 ?We were told that the employees were allowed to take home unsold food items,? the officer said. ?We spoke to the chef, who said that biryani, a few rotis and a murgh masallam were all that the employees took away on Tuesday night. We also learnt from him that murgh masallam is prepared by roasting a full chicken stuffed with spices.?

 The officers then came to know that it was Hussain who had gone home with the chicken the day the theft was reported.

 A team raided Hussain?s house in Motijheel Lane, in east Calcutta.

 During a preliminary interrogation, he denied having taken the money. ?But we were almost certain that he was the culprit. Hiding the money inside a whole chicken was much easier than placing it within rotis or in biryani packets,? said an officer.

 Hussain was brought to the police station, where an extensive grilling forced him to confess that he had committed the crime in the way the sleuths had suspected. 

 A team from the police station then raided Hussain?s house and recovered the money.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mask of a man

 Some feel it is a masculine version 

 of the facegear of Catwoman. Some feel it is closer to the 

 facial latex that Amitabh Bachchan wore in Ajooba. 

 Whatever be the general response, it wasn?t easy creating 

 Krrish?s mask. Hrithik Roshan and designer Rocky S. had 

 more than 50 meetings to decide on the exact look of the 

 mask. Every material from wax to rubber to steel was tried 

 out for the mask. 

 Finally, thanks to a professional 

 from Pune, a wax mask coated with rubber was decided upon. 

 Around 80 of such masks were created, since they would break 

 easily due to the wear and tear of the shootings. What?s 

 more, special chemicals had to be used to keep the mask 

 in place, on Hrithik?s face. With just two to three action 

 shots canned every day, it must have been one tedious experience 

 for Duggu. Now you know, it?s not that easy to be a superhero!

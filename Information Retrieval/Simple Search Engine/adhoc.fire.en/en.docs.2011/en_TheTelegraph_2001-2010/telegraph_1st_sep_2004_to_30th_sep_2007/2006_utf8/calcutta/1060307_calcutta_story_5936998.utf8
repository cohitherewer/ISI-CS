 Aussie accolade for city troupe

 Members of Kalamandalam Performing Wing pose for the camera at one of their stops during the Australia tour. 

 Kalamandalam Performing Wing has just returned after a five-day trip to Australia and apart from the country?s picturesque cityscapes, the troupe members are elated about the turnout at their performances.

 Somnath G. Kutty and his troupe, Kalamandalam Performing Wing, presented a variety of traditional Indian dance forms, including kathakali, kuchipudi, kathak and Bharatanatyam choreographies.

 In June last year, the troupe had been invited to perform at the Mindle Festival, in Darwin. This time, however, the tour incorporated a much bigger schedule from February 11 to 26. The ACT Multicultural Festival in Canberra, Adelaide University Hall and the Griffin Duncan Theatre at the University of Newcastle were some of the venues.

 To suit the audiences there, the troupe had modified their items to a certain extent. Apart from the traditional pieces, a contemporary routine, a fusion of traditional and contemporary dance movements, was included in the line-up. Kutty explained: ?We reduced the length of many of the pieces to about two hours to fit the normal length of performances in Australia.?

 But didn?t the changes compromise the overall integrity of the dance forms? ?Not at all,? replied Kutty, adding ?We used the basic framework of the traditional dances, but adapted by my mother Guru Thankamani Kutty who choreographed them.?

 Malabika Sen, the lead dancer of the troupe, was all praise for Adelaide. ?It was my favourite stop. It is a very well-planned city and we got a great reception there.? 

 But what made the stay even more exciting was the audience response. ?Not just NRIs, other Australians also turned up in good numbers at our shows,? Sen smiled.

 Kutty agreed: ?The Australians were very welcoming, right from the start to finish. We look forward to going there again to perform.?

 The Canberra shows managed to wow dance critic of The Canberra Times Larry Ruffell as well, who described the ?standard of dance presentation high and the costumes lush?.

 Kalamandalam Calcutta is no stranger to winning hearts abroad. ?Especially, the large Indian populations in Dubai, Qatar and other Gulf cities are always happy to see some traditional Indian dance,? said Kutty. 

 Later this year, the troupe will be touring Kuwait and Singapore.

 H for handicapped, O for orphan, P for poor and E for exploited. Aiming at bringing succour to children who fall under these categories, Hope for Children, UK, is a charity based in the UK which extends funding assistance to NGOs working in the field of children?s development.

 In Calcutta and Howrah, there are 46 NGOs grouped under five regions that have been receiving support from Hope for Children.

 The programmes include leadership development, recreation, talent search and a wider scope for their manifestation, as well as creating an enabling environment for the children to avail of opportunities through education. 

 Some of the others are exposure visits, forming children?s organisations, identifying needy children and academic coaching and admission into formal schools.

 The emphasis is on empowering the children to assert their right to a childhood through their own organisations. Now, about 6,000 children spread over the two cities have been brought under the scope of the programmes of Hope for Children. 

 Five regional coordinating agencies have been extending leadership to the 46 NGOs. The annual sports day is organised by the NGOs and 1,200 youngsters are selected to participate in the event.

 This year, it was held on Saturday, March 4, on Park Circus Maidan .

 Governor?s little guests

 It took just 20 minutes for us to reach Raj Bhavan. The buses carrying Class III children and teachers of Birla High School left for Government Place East on February 8 at 8.45 am. 

 As the buses came to a halt, all of us stepped out and formed a queue to enter Governor?s House. We maintained discipline as we made our way through a huge iron gate that had the Ashoka Pillar on each side. There were a lot of security personnel as well and the area was fenced off with barbed wire. The walking paths, laid with stone chips, and the fountain and flower gardens looked breathtaking in the shadow of the magnificent structure .

 The three-storeyed building had quite a few large halls. On the ground floor, the central area is called Marble Hall. The first floor?s central area has the Throne Room, Banquet Hall, The Blue Drawing and the Brown Dining Rooms. The second floor has apartments and ballrooms.

 A cannon set on a dragon frame is nestled in the garden in front of Raj Bhavan, which is maintained by 25 gardeners. An artificial tank on one side stores rainwater which is recycled and used.

 We came upon huge pictures of several statesmen like Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Radhakrishnan. There were statues of Julius Caesar and Augustus and models of old rickshaws and the Raj Bhavan as it looked in the past.

 The Governor?s House is not just a heritage building but also an outstanding landmark of Calcutta. Built between 1799 and 1803, when Marquis Wellesley was the Governor General, this historic structure was designed on the lines of Kedleston Hall in Derbyshire.

 One has to seek formal permission from the authorities to gain entry into the Raj Bhavan premises. Thanks to our school, we got the rare opportunity to visit the residence of Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

Life

 Songs sung true

 Not too many singers hit the MTV Top 10 with their first album and are then approached by an international act like INXS for a musical partnership.

 But then, Sona Mohapatra (in picture by Sudeshna Banerjee) is not just another girl with microphone in hand. The feisty daughter of an army man was till the other day managing brands.

 The Bolo na girl stands at 5 ft 8 and can be called pretty, but not on her face. She hates being clubbed with bimbettes. I pleaded with my music company not to ask me to lose weight I hide it in the right places, she adds cheekily.

 But theres no hiding what she thinks. It took time to get the album (Sona) in the market. Other companies were asking for changes thoda aur sensuous karke gao, Sufi chal raha hai, woh thoda dalo So I held my horses till I could bring out my music on my own terms.

 This determination has shaped her choices right from campus days in Bhubaneshwar. As a first-year engineering student, she sang on stage only to find obscene graffiti on classroom walls the day after. It was a sexist environment. They thought I was acting smart. I fought back. Things came to such a pass that people were rusticated and I got police protection. 

 The fighting spirit helped her when she took up a sales job as the first woman in a company after completing an MBA. 

 But music, not management, was her calling. With a training in Hindusthani classical music, she nursed ambitions to sing while criss-crossing the region nurturing Parachute oil and Mediker shampoo. I used to drive myself, travelling with electronic tanpura and tabla, thinking others who sing full-time have an advantage.

 Sonas voice was heard even before Bolo na, with music by Ram Sampat (of Shaans Tanha Dil fame), became the most requested single in the first week of its launch on MTV. She lent her voice to Tata Salt (Chutki ki), TVS Scooty (featuring Preity Zinta), Titan Raga watches (Rani Mukherjee), Surf Excel (Daag achchhey hain) jingles... The ad circle is more open to new voices. Shaan, Kailash Kher, Kunal Ganjawala all started that way. 

 The girl with an earthy voice, happiest performing live with her band, fights shy of being dubbed an Indipop singer. There is such a bad history of Indipop in our country thanks to the earlier generation mimicking on stage to a track. If you heard them live youd wonder if they could sing. A lot can be done in the studio with music software.

 The INXS song Afterglow is ready to release as a video single in Europe. We Indianised the song they sent, using sargam as interludes... We are working on a second song with them.

 For now, she is touring the country, doing live shows. In short, I am living my dream, Sona smiles.

 Tram tracks claim cyclist

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The spot where Bag was run over

 With his tyres stuck in tram tracks being concretised, a 40-year-old cyclist was run over by a truck on RG Kar Road on Tuesday morning.

 The life of Debasish Bag would not have been lost had the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) finished concretisation of the tracks on RG Kar Road on time, alleged a traffic police officer.

 With work in progress after a Puja break, the steel tracks jut out dangerously and the motorable portion of the road has been considerably narrowed.

 Around 9.30 am on Tuesday, Bag of Raja Dinendra Street was cycling up the bridge that descends in front of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. He was carrying paint brushes and colour on his bicycle. 

 A bus sped towards him from the opposite direction. With no room to the left, the cyclist veered right. The tyres got stuck in the tram tracks. As he struggled to drag the cycle out, the truck hit him from behind. The mans head was smashed against the steel tracks. He died instantly, said a traffic sergeant of Shyambazar Traffic Guard who witnessed the accident.

 Bag fell victim to the long-running game of passing the buck played by civic officials, police and the transport department regarding road repairs on stretches with tram tracks.

 The condition of RG Kar Road was discussed in a traffic situation review meeting at Lalbazar on Saturday. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim, who chaired the meeting, said: I have been repeatedly asking the CTC engineers to repair the portion of RG Kar Road in front of the hospital immediately. I can only voice my concerns, the work has to be done by the concerned personnel.

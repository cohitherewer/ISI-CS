 Drawing a lesson from the Tuesday?s pile-up on Vidyasagar Setu that left five people seriously injured, the toll plaza operator is planning to keep an ambulance and a breakdown van on standby on the bridge.

 On Tuesday, a South Bengal State Transport Corporation bus lost control near the plaza and rammed into a Santro, then an Indica and finally, two taxis. 

 ?If there had been an ambulance on the bridge, the injured could have been taken to hospital earlier. Besides, a breakdown van could have helped in clearing the road quickly. But we had neither vehicle,? rued Vijay Sancheti, project director of SMSL-IRD, which operates the toll plaza.

 ?As thousands of vehicles cross the Setu daily, we feel that there should be certain arrangements for mishaps. We are ready to do our bit, but the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) should also contribute a portion of the funds,? he added.

 Though the operation of the toll plaza has been handed over to SMSL-IRD, maintenance of the lights, guard rails and other portions of the bridge lies with the HRBC. 

 According to the operators, the toll plaza on Vidyasagar Setu is the largest in the region. An accident at the plaza, or even the breakdown of a vehicle, throws traffic out of gear on the bridge. The need for facilities to cope with contingencies has been felt for long.

 Currently, there are only first-aid facilities at the plaza. ?We have invested over Rs 2 crore for the modernisation of the toll plaza and are ready to invest more for the benefit of the commuters. The ambulance can also be used to carry injured people to hospital in case of an accident in the area,?? Sancheti stated.

 HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee pointed out that it was not mandatory to keep an ambulance and breakdown van at the toll plaza, but agreed that it would be very helpful to have the vehicles at hand. 

 ?In case of a mishap, we have to seek the help of police or the breakdown services. If an ambulance and breakdown van is available at the plaza, it will be very helpful. We are taking up the matter with the toll operator and a decision will be taken soon,? Banerjee said. He, however, did not make any commitment on the sharing of funds.

 Sub-divisional officer of Howrah (Sadar) Pabitra Mondal met HRBC officials, senior police officers and representatives of SMSL-IRD after Tuesday?s accident. Some local residents were also present at the meeting.

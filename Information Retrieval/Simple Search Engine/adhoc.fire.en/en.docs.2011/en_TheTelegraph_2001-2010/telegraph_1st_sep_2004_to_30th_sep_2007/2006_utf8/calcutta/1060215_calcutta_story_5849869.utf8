The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I was dying to write a film like this?

 Adman PRASOON JOSHI tells Pratim D. Gupta how penning Rang De Basanti was about concept and craft, passion and poetry

 Alice Patten and Aamir 

 Khan with others in a moment from Rang De Basanti

 Thodi si dhool meri dharti 

 ki mere watan ki

 Thodi si khushboo baurai se mast pawan ki

 Thodi si dhondhane waali dhak-dhak dhak-dhak dhak-dhak 

 saansein

 Jin mein ho junoon junoon woh boondein laal lahoo 

 ki

 Yeh sab tu mila mila le 

 Phir rang tu khila khila le

 Aur mohe tu rang de basanti yaara

 Mohe tu rang de basanti?

 When Prasoon Joshi was penning 

 these magic words to awaken a generation, he was not just 

 writing the lyrics of a film song. For him, this was another 

 attempt to arouse the youth of the country, something he 

 has been trying for long through his advertising work as 

 the regional creative head of McCann Erickson (South and 

 South-East Asia).

 ?No single movement can have as 

 much impact on people as popular culture can,? says the 

 man of the moment from Mumbai.

 It?s not that Prasoon got into 

 song writing to cash in on the popular culture named Bollywood. 

 ?Poetry has been a passion for me since childhood,? he reveals. 

 ?I have been writing mostly in Hindi and Urdu and sometimes 

 also in English. Two of my books in Hindi poetry also got 

 published. My first song writing happened with the band 

 Silk Route for their album Boondein. Then, I went 

 on to write for the hit Shubha Mudgal albums, Ab Ke Saawan 

 and Mann Ke Manjeere.?

 Penning lyrics for films started 

 with Rajkumar Santoshi?s Lajja, followed by Vipul 

 Shah?s Aankhen, Kunal Kohli?s Hum Tum and 

 Revathy?s Phir Milenge.

 ?With Rang De Basanti, 

 I have penned the dialogues for the first time apart from 

 writing the lyrics,? says Prasoon. ?Although it was a new 

 thing for me, it wasn?t that difficult since dialogues have 

 always played a big role in all my advertising work, from 

 Thanda matlab Coca Cola to Chloromint?s Dobara 

 mat poochhna.?

 But there?s a difference between 

 writing dialogues for a 30-second commercial and a three-hour-long 

 movie, admits Prasoon. ?It?s like the difference between 

 writing a haiku and a long poem,? he says. ?Each has its 

 own challenges but what advertising does teach you is the 

 economy of words. If you carefully follow the Rang De 

 dialogues, they are not lengthy, very easy and short. No 

 one is a born writer, everyone imbibes his style through 

 his experiences and it is advertising that has helped me 

 develop my style.?

 A style that allows Aamir Khan 

 and gang to mouth some of the most natural and thought-provoking 

 lines in recent Bollywood memory. A sample: ?We have one 

 foot in the past and one foot in the future; so we are pissing 

 on the present? ? DJ (Aamir), in endearing Punjabi-Hindi.

 The feel, the flow

 Initially, though, it wasn?t easy 

 for Prasoon to get his writing right for Rang De. 

 ?It took me a lot of time to get into the groove,? he recalls. 

 ?The youth, the anger, I had a lot of discussions with Aamir 

 and Rakeysh (Mehra) before I got it right. Once I got the 

 hang of things, then it became quite effortless for me.?

 Another challenge was to write 

 songs for A.R. Rahman. ?What I found quite unique about 

 him was his improvisational abilities; he would change the 

 songs till the very last minute,? Prasoon recalls. ?Like 

 for the Lata Mangeshkar song Lukachhupi, he came 

 and wanted me to change the words on the day of the recording. 

 I had to go back to the same thought process that the song 

 had demanded. Also, Rahman never writes in conventional 

 meter and has this unconventional way of writing music. 

 That makes writing songs for him even more challenging.?

 Prasoon feels a great sense of 

 pride in announcing that all the songs of Rang De Basanti 

 were his concepts. ?That made writing the lyrics very special,? 

 he says. ?I was expressing my thoughts, whether it was Abhi 

 abhi hua yakeen or Har dil mein boond boond karta 

 hai H2SO4? I was not writing for any character. They 

 were not lip-synced situational numbers, they were all conceptual 

 songs.?

 Prasoon Joshi

What made the UTV project stand 

 out for Prasoon and inspired him come up with unforgettable 

 lines was the motivation, he feels. ?I myself have always 

 felt that India has a lot of potential and the youth of 

 the country can be the only guiding force,? he explains. 

 ?I was dying to write a film like this. So, I took a lot 

 of responsibility when I was writing the dialogues and the 

 lyrics. It was really special.?

 Although Rang De?s success 

 has opened the floodgates of offers to write for Bollywood, 

 Prasoon?s taking it nice and easy. ?I wear too many hats 

 and have to handle 12 countries in my region as the creative 

 director of McCann,? he reveals. ?And we have got so many 

 new accounts like Liril, Britannia and Intel. So, as of 

 now, I just have Fanaah where I have written the 

 songs composed by Jatin-Lalit.?

 If film accolades have been pouring 

 in, Prasoon?s ad work has also won him international acclaim. 

 He has been voted one of the 40 Asian Young Global Leaders 

 by an affiliate of the World Economic Forum. ?I am slated 

 to meet other leaders at a forum in June at Vancouver where 

 we would discuss our respective country?s problems and how 

 the youth can contribute to the well-being.?

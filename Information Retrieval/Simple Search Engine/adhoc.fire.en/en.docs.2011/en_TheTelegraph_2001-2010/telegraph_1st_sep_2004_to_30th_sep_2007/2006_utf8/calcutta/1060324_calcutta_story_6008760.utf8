 Return to sunset: Hawkers back on Hatibagan pavements 

 Apropos the report ?Mayor muscle 

 for mall mania?, February 23, the opening of the CESC-Godrej 

 Plaza and the B-school by RPG Enterprises could have been 

 deferred for some time. The need of the hour is uninterrupted 

 supply by the power utility so that factories, hospitals, 

 educational institutions, trains and offices can function 

 smoothly. 

 Before throwing their weight behind retail projects, the administration should provide pure drinking water, proper roads and pavements and prompt and reliable transport system to public. Regular removal of garbage and expansion of greenery by the civic body will go a long way in improving the quality of our lives. 

 We have several shopping malls in Calcutta and a world-class management school at Joka. But many in the city do not have access to uninterrupted power supply, safe drinking water, quality medical service and have to brave potholed roads and pavements to get to their place of work. 

 Also needed are primary and high schools and parks and gardens for senior citizens and children. Playgrounds and stadiums will help the talented sportsmen of the state to flourish. 

 A little financial backing by entrepreneurs of the 

 state can help Bengal develop a great extent. What we can 

 do without should be kept in abeyance for now. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Administrators generally try to rid their area of undesirable elements, but our mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya is inviting undesirable elements to the city pavements by legalising illegal encroachment (Rider hits hawker return, February 24). Already, more than two-thirds of the sidewalks have been taken over by hawkers. If they are not reined in, the citizens will have no option but to resign themselves to death by road mishaps. 

 The mayor?s statement, ?Hawkers have always been there?? is irresponsible and irritating. Moreover, if hawkers are part of the city then so are rickshawpullers, cart-pullers and horse-drawn carriages. Unlike hawkers, they at least have some heritage value. If the mayor likes hawkers so much, why isn?t he employing them in the civic body? The need of the hour is to forego vested interest. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Has the mayor considered the fact 

 that if the hawkers occupy one-third of the pavement, the 

 rest of the space will be taken up by their customers. The 

 new policy threatens to put pavements out of bounds of pedestrians. 

 Anoop Gadodia, 

 Amar Basu Sarani. 

 Violating an order passed last 

 year by Calcutta High Court for making the pavements encroachment-free, 

 the mayor has empowered hawkers to vend merchandise inconveniencing 

 pedestrians. The decision is baffling considering that there 

 is regular loss of life in road mishaps and the pavements 

 are totally clogged. Worse, experience has shown that it 

 is nearly impossible to remove hawkers from pavements. 

 I condemn this evil attempt by the mayor to garner 

 votes ahead of the Assembly election. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur. 

 Apropos the photograph ?Bite the dust?, March 4, it is shocking that the burning of the effigy of US President George Bush has charred the greenery on the Maidan. Given that burning of effigies creates pollution and might lead to fatal fires, the protesters should find safer ways to make their point. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Policemen in camera?, February 27, the initiative to instal close-circuit television in police stations across the city is wonderful. We often hear of cops misbehaving with ordinary people who approach them for help. The system of keeping a tab on rude policemen with the help of close-circuit television is likely to be successful. Using the system, the authorities will also be able to haul up cops who help criminals, sitting in police stations. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report ?Poll pushback for varsity test?, March 2, it is a matter of regret that students are being harassed due to the five-phase Assembly polls. Those appearing for board and university examinations inevitably suffer in an election year. Even if the poll and exam dates do not coincide, there are other disturbances like blaring loudspeakers and disruptive rallies. 

 A state like ours cannot develop if election arrangements are given precedence over examinations. The election commission should have organised the polls in such a way that the students are not disturbed. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

 The physically-challenged are entitled to buy public transport tickets at concessional rates (Fake disability ticket, March 2). Sometimes people pretend to be disabled to extract this advantage. The businessman and his wife who did so need to be punished. The health department must exercise utmost caution while issuing disability certificates. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly. 

 It was good to know that gadgets like umbrellas with muga silk fabric for protection against ultraviolet rays, incense makers, amphibious bicycles and pomegranate peelers are being made in India (Platform for gadgets from grassroots, February 23). The gadgets should be exhibited in towns and villages to draw the attention of manufacturers. There is a lot of talent at the grassroots level that does not receive any exposure. Those with the flair for innovation deserve better working condition. 

 N.S. Ramakrishnan, 

 EM Bypass. 

 Apropos the report ?Brows raised over green board role?, March 6, we would like to clarify that no 1.31-acre waterbody or swamp was filled by us. On the contrary, necessary permissions had been obtained from the regulatory authority concerned prior to commencement of construction. 

 We would also like to reiterate that Bikramgarh Jheel is not a part of our premises and therefore the question of its encroachment does not arise. We have submitted a beautification plan for Bikramgarh Jheel at our own cost. 

 We have invited officials from the government departments concerned to visit the project site and carry out necessary inspection. 

 Sanjay Choudhury,

 Chief Executive Officer, South City Projects.

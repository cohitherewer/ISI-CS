 A morose Tapas Pal carefully arranges the pots of paints and cleans half-a-dozen brushes in a bowl of kerosene.

 A well-known wall and billboard artist of Netaji Nagar, near Tollygunge, Pal is jobless after the Election Commission imposed a ban on graffiti.

 ?This ban (on graffiti) has robbed us of our daily fee of Rs 150 to Rs 200. We look forward to the elections to earn this extra cash by writing graffiti,? said Pal, who operates from a roadside stall in Netaji Nagar.

 Pal makes a living by painting billboards. When Pal and his assistant Khokon initially heard about the ban, they were not quite sure what it meant. They were disheartened when various political parties explained it to them.

 ?We never take part in politics but eagerly wait for an election. But this time, it appears there is nothing we can do. We have already worked on a few walls and have orders for a few others. But, now with even the police on vigil, we can?t write on walls any longer,? said Pal. 

 Uttam Byapari of Nager Bazar, in north Calcutta, is another skilled wall writer with virtually no order from political parties. ?The Election Commission?s order against graffiti has really hit me. During previous elections, I used to receive orders to write on about 30 to 35 walls. So far, I have worked on only two small walls and was paid a meagre Rs 45,? said a dejected Byapari. 

 The young man has already invested a few hundred rupees in different paints. ?All my investment, it seems, will go down the drain,? he added.

 The trend of political parties hiring artists to write graffiti started in the mid-90s to give a different character to this effective mode of campaigning. Earlier, party workers used to paint graffiti.

 ?The candidate?s names and the party symbol were highlighted, and red, black and blue were used. But gradually, we realised that wall writing could be used like an ad to promote the points mentioned in party manifestos. Colourful graffiti did pay dividends,? said Abhijit Ghosh Chowdhury, a Youth Congress leader of north Calcutta.

 The ban on graffiti has also hit paint suppliers. ?The Congress as well as other political parties invest a lot in paints for graffiti and they buy these from local retailers. So, local paint traders are going to suffer,? said Chowdhury.

 ?During earlier elections, I would sell at least Rs 30,000 worth of paint to various political parties. But paint sale stopped soon after the ban,? said Sobhan Karmakar, owner of a hardware store in the Lake Town area.

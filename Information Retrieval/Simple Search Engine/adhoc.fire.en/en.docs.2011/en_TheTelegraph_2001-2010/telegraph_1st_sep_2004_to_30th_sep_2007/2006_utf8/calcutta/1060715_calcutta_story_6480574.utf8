 The City Diary

 Arup 

 Das, an advocate of Calcutta High Court, complained to Bar 

 Association secretary Amal Mukherjee on Friday that his wife, 

 employed with the judges? library in the court, had been ?sexually 

 harassed by the driver of a judge? on the premises on Thursday. 

 Das also said that when he tried to catch the ?culprit?, he 

 was manhandled by the drivers of other judges. 

 According to Das, his wife had lodged a complaint with registrar 

 general of the court Raghunath Roy and Hare Street police 

 station. While Roy refused to comment on the matter, Hare 

 Street thana officers confirmed the complaint had been 

 lodged late on Friday.

 In his letter to the association, advocate Das said that around 

 10.15 am on Thursday, he had received a call from his wife 

 informing him that she had been ?assaulted? by the driver 

 of a judge. 

 Members of the executive committee of the Bar Association 

 said the panel has convened a meeting on Monday to discuss 

 the matter. West Bengal Bar Council will soon take up the 

 matter with the chief justice, said vice-president Uttam Majumdar. 

 Papiya Sarkar, 11, a resident of Jodhpur Lane (ward 92) was admitted to BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on Friday with suspected dengue fever.

 Counselling for students who have qualified for the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE) was suspended for an hour on Friday, following an agitation by a section of students at Asutosh Birth Centenary Auditorium of the Indian Museum. The students were protesting the state government?s decision to distribute seats on the basis of their all-India ranks on the AIEEE merit list. They demanded they be allotted seats on the basis of their state-level ranks. N.R. Banerjea, chairman of the state JEE board that was organising the counselling, intervened to bring the situation under control. 

 Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the state pollution control board to distribute copies of the PN Roy Committee report to all parties related to a case filed against South City by Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Khan. The committee was constituted by the board to inquire into the environmental aspects of the South City project, off Prince Anwar Shah Road. The next hearing of the case will be after two weeks. In another petition related to the same project, heard analogously by the court, the petitioner prayed for an injunction on work on the third and fourth towers of the estate. The court passed a specific order, but heeding a prayer from South City, prevented it from being made public.

The flight finally left for Yangon at 4 pm.

 Indian Museum will shortly open a gallery on ethnic masks and another on the various features of northeast India. It also plans to enrich the existing Harappan gallery.

 The galleries are being planned so that visitors will be able to cull all relevant information about the exhibits, said director Satya Kali Basu.

 The masks worn by people of Sibsagar, Assam, of Purulia (during chhau dance), of Malda (during gambhira dance), of the Dinajpurs (during gomira dance) and of Jalpaiguri (during rava dance) will find a place in the museum. 

 There will also be masks worn by the Gadaba community of Orissa.

 In the gallery on the Northeast, items such as traditional costumes and ornaments will be on display. The authorities hope visitors will have a ?clear idea? about the Northeastern states and their people after making a round of the gallery.

 ?Experts from the Northeast are working with our men to make the gallery a comprehensive one,? the director said. Both galleries are likely to be opened in June.

 The decision to revamp the Harappan gallery follows a visit by a museum team to Dholavira, a site in Gujarat where an excavation was carried out in search of remains of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The team has brought back some photographs that will be displayed in the gallery.

 The museum has roped in M.C. Joshi, former director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, in redesigning the gallery. ?We need some time to prepare it,? said Basu.

 The museum authorities are also taking some other measures to draw more visitors. ?For instance, the library has been shifted to a spacious hall in an adjacent building. We have more than 50,000 titles on various subjects, accessible to visitors at a nominal fee, and are planing to add more,? he added.

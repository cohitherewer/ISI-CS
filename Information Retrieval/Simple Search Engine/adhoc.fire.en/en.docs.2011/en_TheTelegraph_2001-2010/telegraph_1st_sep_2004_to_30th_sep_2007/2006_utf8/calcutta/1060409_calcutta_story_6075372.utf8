 With back-to-back showings by four of Indias couture kings ? Tarun Tahiliani, JJ Valaya and Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla ? it couldnt get bigger than this.

 Top it up with some star sprinkle in the form of Shilpa Shetty and Shweta Nanda (Bachchan) on the ramp and Sonali Bendre and Jaya Bachchan among the front-rowers, and you had a sparkling formula for a grand celebration of style.

 Friday started on an international note with designers Aparna Chandra and Varun Bahl showcasing two brilliant autumn-winter lines, the best that the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WLIFW) in Delhi has seen so far.

 While Aparna used an amalgamation of retro influences for her ultra-feminine line, Varun chose to remain in the psychological realm with multi-layered clothes.

 As Day III progressed into evening, national was the flavour of Tarun Tahilianis line titled Ode to Autumn.

 India is my market and Indian aesthetics abound in all my creations. This collection draws from modern India, but with an Ottoman twist to the tale, declared the veteran designer, who had Bollywood body beautiful Shilpa Shetty walking the ramp. 

 With his trademark digital prints as the primary focus, Tarun also played around with a lot of embroidery forms in this autumn-winter 2006-07 line.

 Chikankari on net, machine embroidery combined with patchwork, hand embroidery with sequins and beads, zardosi on brocade and extensive stone embroidery with Swarovski crystals. 

 Sun-kissed bronze, rust, ochre, antique gold and burnt umber highlighted the ivory and the colours of the night.

 Luxurious silks, satins, velvets, jamewar, Victorian lace and the like shaped the opulent garments. 

 ong with jamewar and Victorian lace, another emphasis was the embroidered snake skin look, where the skin texture of the print was offset by jewelled motifs around the necklines and the centre.

 I have tried to demonstrate the subtle and understated opulence of this collection through the innovative use of digital printing technology on silk and georgette. I have also highlighted the complex weaves of jamewar and the ethereal translucency of Victorian lace. The look is completed with jewellery embellishments from Swarovski, explained Tarun.

 Draped silhouettes were combined with structured necklines and collars and ruched bodices. 

 Structured jackets, corsets, jersey blouses, stylised kurtas, soft and feminine saris, cigarette pants, and skirts of every shape and size made up the collection.

 JJ Valaya was up next, launching his diffusion label Valaya Quantum. Drama with a capital D was the name of the Valaya game. 

 So much so that the clothes were often overshadowed by the theatricality of the presentation.

 Called Circa 2040, the collection drew from an imaginary world that is one large emotionless refuge? devoid of passion, cultures, values and ethics, where machines have overpowered every fragment of human life. 

 Valaya imagines a war 35 years in the future, where a new power comprising the most unyielding warriors of the past ? The Amazons of Ares, The Maasai and Bushido ? have risen to quell the mechanics of this futuristic supremacy. 

 The ambience was created right at the start with images of war and nothingness being projected on giant white curtains screening the whole ramp.

 Models with face and hair painted in metallic silver and often dressed as warriors with ancient war weapons in their hands, catwalked aggressively, playing out the theme.

 The collection, broken into three sequences ? the Greek influence in the Amazons of Ares, the African feel in Maasai and the Samuari code in Bushido ? presented three dramatically different looks. 

 A mix of fabrics as diverse as linen-silk, georgette, lycra, brocade, velvet and chenille shaped the garments.

 The colours encompassed a wide palette ? reds, gold, browns, rust, orange, aqua, greens, purple, magenta, blacks and more. 

 To start with there were long skirts with a variety of tops, from empire lines to layered ones, fitted kurtas with printed legging trousers, knee-length skirts and long empire line dresses. 

 The Samurai style boasted short cocktail dresses, minis, wrap tops, long skirts, slim pants, long jackets, lungis and lots of wraps. 

 The tribal look of the third sequence was created with metallic and shell embellishment. Multi-layered clothing with lots of jackets made up the silhouettes.

 Its a very futuristic storyline and the collection boasts of a strong fantasy element. In this explosion of machines, I wanted to show the return of ethnicity, explained JJ.

 The final show of the night by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla was a trip down memory lane for the designer duo that completes 20 years of its partnership.

 The line titled Abu Sandeep Classics featured some of their trend-setting designs from 1987. 

 Though the ramp witnessed some exquisite signature Abu-Sandeep pieces, one failed to understand why the designers chose to do a retrospective when the Fashion Week diktat was to unveil a brand new line for the coming autumn-winter. 

 On show were glimpses of some of Abu-Sandeeps most talked-about collections till date ? the Sufi-inspired Dervish of 1987, Miniature drawing from miniature paintings in 1989, the gypsy skirts line Crush of 1987, Marodi named after the traditional embroidery form of 1993 and Mirror work of 1990.

 Then there was Architectural (1991) inspired by the Purana Qila of Delhi, Velvet Line Balinesian (1993) with a distinct Bali feel, Stones (1993), the abstract Exotica (2004), Peacock (2005), Faces (2004), Lotus Pond (2005), Pastel Floral (1995), Ifashan (2004) and Skin Net (1990). 

 The finale presented a breathtaking highlight of the duos chikan works from 1993 to date, with tone-on-tone threadwork on ivories and whites.

 While Jaya Bachchan and Sonali Bendre cheered the designers from the front row, Shweta took the stage dressed in an opulent white and silver chikankari piece.

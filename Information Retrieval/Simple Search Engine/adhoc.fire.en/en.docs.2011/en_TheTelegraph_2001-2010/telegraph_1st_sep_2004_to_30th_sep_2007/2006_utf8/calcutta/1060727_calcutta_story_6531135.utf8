The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

No movies for mommy

Screen On amp; Off

 Her commercial break has nothing to do with a celluloid comeback, spells out Sonali Bendre. The actress who disappeared from the Bollywood roster after marrying Goldie Behl is now a busy mother and nothing can come in the way of her raising 10-month-old Ranveer. 

 ?There?s a mental baggage in our country that having a baby means everything has to come to an end,? she tells Metro over phone from Mumbai. ?But people can have different priorities. Someone can enter a different life altogether after being a mother.?

 Sabbatical Sonali has faced the camera for the Sparsh Baby Oil and Baby Bathing Bar commercial. ?I used the product and liked it a lot and so I found nothing wrong in endorsing it,? she says. ?There is an emotional quotient also with the product being from the Parachute stable which I had endorsed before. There?s a lot of quality and integrity involved with the brand.?

 But when it comes to the big screen, Sonali has NO written all over her. ?I don?t have time for movies,? she sounds almost cynical. ?A film takes a lot of commitment and time and I just don?t have that now. So there?s really no point in taking up something.?

 She has no such qualms with the stage, though. ?I just did two shows of Tumhari Amrita after a one-year break and I didn?t feel rusty at all,? she says excitedly. ?The last time I had done the play I was eight months pregnant. I just read it once before going on stage and it worked. It?s great creative satisfaction and takes just three hours of my time.?

 Would she rather do a Kajol and return to movies when Ranveer is old enough? ?I really don?t know about that,? Sonali goes on the defensive again. ?We are in different leagues and we have different appeals. So you really can?t compare. For me, right now, my baby is the most important person and being with him just makes me happy.? Point noted.

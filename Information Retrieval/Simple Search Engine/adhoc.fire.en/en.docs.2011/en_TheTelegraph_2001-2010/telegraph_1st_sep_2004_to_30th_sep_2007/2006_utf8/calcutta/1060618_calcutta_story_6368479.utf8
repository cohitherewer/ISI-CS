 Young artists, fresh feel

 Two galleries in Calcutta ? Galerie 88 and the relatively new and difficult-to-find Anant Art Gallery at 18A Alipore Road ? are holding exhibitions of young artists, most of whom having associations with Calcutta. They were trained either in the art schools of the city or at Santiniketan, and in certain cases, in Baroda, as well.

 Some of the artists who are on exhibition have a fresh way of looking at things even though their work cannot be termed path-breaking. Without jumping to conclusions from a limited number of their works on display, one can safely say they have a bright future unless they prefer to remain content only with what they are doing now.

 To begin with, the artists of the better-known Galerie 88. The largest and most spectacular work ? a triptych ? is Bhaskar Goswami?s. Menacing, semi-clad men face a tiger and other birds and beasts in this dynamic work painted with gouache on paper. It is a synthesis of many ideas whose source is not difficult to pinpoint. Sathi Guin orchestrates a very bright red and green in her two canvases to make a personal statement.

 Umakanta Das uses soft colours, both broad and fine brushstrokes, and impressions on paper to produce sets of watercolours that are the products of a fine sensibility. Some of the better works are, in fact, executed on paper. Jayanta Naskar displays a good control over his medium in his three graphics. So does Sumana Jana in her cosmic vision of the conjunction of heavenly bodies. That the computer can be put to a creative end is proved by Riddhi Narayan Nandy?s digital prints. Some of the larger works tend to look cliched beside these.

 At Anant Art Gallery, too, the works on paper stand out. Pratul Dash culls images from various sources, including folk and publicity material, to produce watercolours imbued with a sense of irony one does not associate with this medium.

 Gouache is Tanmoy Samanta?s medium. He creates works with high production values. They are delicately drawn and tinted and exude a sense of calm. Samit Das?s largish drawings with conti on white paper are stark. Shorn of details they resemble architectural drawings, sketches of ruins or even a rock face.

 Sambit Panda?s paintings on canvases depict an invasion of flies in a room full of dead fish. The flies resemble tiny, ominous birds as they wing around in geometric formations. The fish lie in a putrid heap on the floor and in a bucket. Both the paintings have the disquieting quality of a bad dream.

 The larger works, of say Farhad Hussain or Prasanta Kalita, do not bear the same stamp of personality. They remind too much of works seen before.

 Animated canvas for youth

 A new look, a fresh feel and a firm focus on the mature cartoon viewer. Animax, the anime specialist, is sketching new plans to make it big in India.

 Leading the channel?s list of changes is a more youth and young adult focus. ?The best animation produced today is becoming more and more appealing to the youth-driven demographic,? Betty Tsui, head of Animax Asia told Metro.

 ?There is also greater commercial value with the youth segment. These people are the early consumers and have purchasing power that justifies their demands of experiencing a daily life that is dynamic, fun and full of creativity,? Tsui offered.

 As for anime fans in Calcutta, the response has been ?very positive?. ?Calcutta is one of the emerging metro cities in India and has a sprawling youth population with a keen interest in animation,? Tsui stressed.

 Earlier this month, the channel launched the Animax Refresh initiative, aimed at evolving Animax into a youth lifestyle brand. ?Over a period of time, Animax will look at being not just an entertainment brand but also touching the lives of youth through the various activities that they indulge in,? said Tsui.

 The highlight of the initiative is Imagine-Nation, a short-form programme series showcasing successful Indians and Asians connected to the world of games, entertainment, animation, media and design. They include figures such as F1 driver Narain Karthikeyan, Indian Idol 2 winner Sandeep Acharya, Singaporean animation guru Nickson Fong and Maya Entertainment CEO Rajesh Turakhia.

 Also being launched are new movies and series featuring young adult-oriented themes and mature story lines and characters, such as Inuyasha: Fire on the Mystic Island, God save Our King, The Count of Monte Cristo, Initial D and Samurai 7.

 Was the transformation necessitated by anime (the Japanese animation style) not doing well in India? ?That?s not correct,? argued Tsui. ?All cartoon channels and even children?s networks have anime that is extremely successful. Our series are more akin to a dramatic series you might find on a general entertainment channel. Youth interests have grown, and that is what our channel wants to reflect.?

 Animax is also looking at adding locally produced content to the programming line-up. ?Animation is a hot industry in India and we are definitely looking into the potential of sourcing locally,? Tsui said. The channel is conducting research to decide whether it would add more local language feeds. Currently, feeds are available in English and Hindi.

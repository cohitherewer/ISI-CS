The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Laldighi car park plan curtailed

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The underground car park at Laldighi, the waterbody in BBD Bag, is finally taking shape, but as an abridged version of the original grand plan.

 What was to have been a giant, multi-tiered affair implemented by a private party, addressing the parking problems of the entire central business district, will now be a regular, two-storeyed structure for government vehicles alone.

 ?We?ve realised that the project is not viable for private parties since a bulk of cars housed here will be government vehicles. Now, the PWD is itself taking up the project. Tenders will be invited over the next fortnight,? said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.

 The state planning board had given the green signal to the PWD proposal just before the Assembly elections. Work will start after the monsoon.

 Housing between 550 and 600 vehicles, the structure will stand 1.5 m above ground level.

 ?We may allow parking facilities for visitors to Writers? Buildings. But the facility is primarily for government vehicles,? added Goswami.

 According to a PWD survey, over 200 cars are parked opposite the state secretariat through the day, with the car count rising to 500 during peak hours.

 Setting the wheels in motion, the PWD has sought clearance from various agencies.

 The Calcutta Tramways Company has agreed to curtail services in the area opposite Writers? Buildings during the period of construction.

 Around 50 trees in front of Writers? will have to be felled, for which clearance has been sought from the forest department. Also, the memorials of Benoy-Badal-Dinesh, as well as Mangal Pandey, along with the statues of BC Roy and Prafulla Chaki that stand at Laldighi, will have to be relocated temporarily. ?We propose to shift them to the garden in front of Writers?,? said an official.

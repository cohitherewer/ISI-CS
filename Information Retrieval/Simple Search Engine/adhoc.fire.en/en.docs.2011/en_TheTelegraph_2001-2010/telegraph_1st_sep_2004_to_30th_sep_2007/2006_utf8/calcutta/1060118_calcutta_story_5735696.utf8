The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I find our chemistry funny?

 Bare-back beauty UDITA GOSWAMI is back with her Zeher co-star Emraan Hashmi in Aksar. She talks to Pratim D. Gupta about their jodi and her truce with the Bhatts

 Udita Goswami in Aksar 

 After rejecting so many films, why did you decide on Aksar as your next film after Zeher?

 Yes, there were lots of offers after Zeher. But I always wanted to do less work but work that really appealed to me. So I didn?t want to do the multistarrers that came my way. Aksar had a really interesting script, a good producer, an experienced director and some very good co-stars. I didn?t find a reason to say no to the film.

 What did you find interesting in the script?

 It?s basically a mind game between the three people but there are lots of twists and turns in the script. It will really grab your attention till the end and will keep you rooted to your seat for the two hour duration of the movie.

 This is the first time you are working with Dino Morea?

 Yes, and contrary to expectations, he is a very funny guy to be with. He makes you laugh all the time and even though he is doing a serious role in the film, he always has a joke to crack.

 Your other Aksar co-star Emraan Hashmi must be a friend by now...

 When Emraan and I were doing Zeher, I used to be more friendly with other people on the sets and would hardly talk to him. But during the Aksar shoot, I didn?t know any other person. So, we really got along well this time. Emraan is the exact opposite of Dino ? he is very reserved and is usually in a world of his own.

 But isn?t your chemistry with Emraan the USP of the film?

 I really don?t know what people mean by chemistry. To be very honest, when I have to hug or kiss Emraan, I just laugh. In reality that?s the chemistry. What everyone talks about as ?hot? and ?rocking? is actually a very funny thing for me.

 After such a young director like Mohit Suri, you are working with a veteran like Ananth Mahadevan. What?s it like to work with him?

 That Ananthji has been an actor himself helps him to understand other actors as a director. It becomes just so much easier for him to connect with his cast. Otherwise he is a very sweet man. Every time, I would go up to him and tell him to shout at me if I don?t get the shot right because at the end of the day it will be me that the people would be watching on screen and I don?t want to get it wrong. But he would never shout, just come and explain things to me very sweetly.

 All the Aksar songs ? Jhalak dikhla ja, Soniye, Lagi lagi ? have become big hits. Which one is your favourite?

 I don?t want to sound diplomatic but I really like all the tracks. I know Jhalak dikhla ja has become the craze right now. But let me tell you, shooting for the song was not that easy. I was inside this water tank and all I was smelling was gas because there were all these fire pipes inside the water and they would go off time and again. I myself had to come out and go into that water repeatedly. So although it may look very good on screen it was really very tough for me.

 From Paap to Zeher and now Aksar, do you feel you have grown as an actor?

 Of course, I have grown as an actor. Now, I can understand things a lot better than I used to. Previously, I would be doing exactly what the director asked me to do. But now, I would think before every shot. And thinking and acting is different and exciting. Now, when I look back at Paap and Zeher, I feel there is so much more I could have done in those films. But then again, I was really very raw then.

 Which other films have you committed to?

 There are two comedies to come ? Amar Joshi Shaheed Ho Gaya and Kisse Pyar Karoon. I haven?t signed anything else because I want to see the response to Aksar and then take on more movies.

 The last time you spoke to Metro you were furious with the Bhatt camp. Are you still mad at them?

 I think it was totally blown out of proportion in the media. Now, everything?s fine with them. If they come to me with a good script, I will definitely do it.

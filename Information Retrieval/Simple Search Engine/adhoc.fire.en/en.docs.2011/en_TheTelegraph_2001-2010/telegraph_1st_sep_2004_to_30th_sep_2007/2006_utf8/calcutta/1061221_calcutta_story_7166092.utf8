The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Need for urgent road fix

 Calcutta Column

 Baguiati main road needs urgent repairs. Throughout the day, the road is very busy and owing to the numerous potholes and craters, commuters face a lot of problems. It is also the key reason for the accidents on that particular stretch. With new apartments and housing blocks coming up in the area, maintenance of the roads is a must and should be taken up as quickly as possible. Authorities should look into the matter.

 Justice delayed

 It is strange that legal authorities transfer judges and magistrates from courts without making alternative arrangements. There are a lot of instances where cases are delayed for years. The litigants suffer and money is spent unnecessarily. This is nothing but denial of justice. I would request the authorities concerned for speedy trials. The Bar Association has been unsuccessful in solving these problems.

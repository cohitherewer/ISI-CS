The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 It?s not rare for others to look up to you. Your logical and quick mind is an asset. Routine cramps your style. You are the dependable wall of the family. You are always open to new ideas, opinions and self-improvement. You are cautious and sensible, especially when making decisions on relationships. ? Kusum Bhandari

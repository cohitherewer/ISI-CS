The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pavements for the taking

 Where: Strand Road (approach 

 to Mullickghat)

 What we saw: The narrow 

 pavements completely taken over by hawkers and ?hotels?, 

 families and vehicles. There is no way one can walk on the 

 pavement, forcing pedestrians to stick to the side of a 

 busy road where buses and cars are invariably in a rush 

 to reach Howrah station

 CMCspeak: ?It is the prerogative 

 of the Port Trust to evacuate the pavement. If they approach 

 us, we will crack down on these illegal occupants immediately 

 ? Arun Sarkar, chief engineer (conservancy)

 Pedestrianspeak: ?Hawkers, 

 vans, eateries, shanties and godowns ? there is everything 

 here except space for pedestrians. Elderly people like us 

 have so much trouble making our way through? ? M.B. Blue, 

 a resident of central Calcutta

 Where: Canning Street

 What we saw: Your car can 

 take anything between 20 minutes and an hour to reach Rabindra 

 Sarani from Brabourne Road via Canning Street. The stretch 

 should ideally take three minutes to cover, but here you 

 are completely at the mercy of the hawkers. For, they have 

 not only overrun the pavements, but also descended on the 

 street and claimed half of it

 Copspeak: No one in sight 

 in the chaos corridor. A few were spotted at both ends, 

 allowing commercial vehicles to flout rules and enter from 

 both north and south

 CMCspeak: ?The hawker menace 

 here is terrible. They had been removed some time ago after 

 the Calcutta High Court directive but they have come back 

 again. Some action should be taken after the Assembly election? 

 ? Chandana Ghosh Dastidar, mayor-in-council (solid waste 

 management)

 Shop-ownerspeak: ?Why blame 

 us? This is our livelihood. I have put up a stall in front 

 of my shop because unless I do, someone else will and my 

 shop will lose business? ? a shop-owner-cum-hawker

 Where: Posta and Raja Katra 

 in Burrabazar.

 What we saw: The pavement 

 means business here, for shop owners and hawkers alike

 Copspeak: ?Whatever campaign 

 you run, no one can remove the hawkers from here.They will 

 keep occupying these pavements and the pedestrians will 

 have to make do with the little space they get to walk on 

 the road? ? traffic official on duty 

 CMCspeak: ?We had cracked 

 down on these hawkers some time ago, but they are back...? 

 ? Chandana Ghosh Dastidar 

 Pedestrianspeak: ?I have 

 been staying in Posta since my birth and I do not remember 

 ever walking on the footpath. Minor accidents are the order 

 of the day The elderly are the worst sufferers? ? Divya 

 Chowdhary

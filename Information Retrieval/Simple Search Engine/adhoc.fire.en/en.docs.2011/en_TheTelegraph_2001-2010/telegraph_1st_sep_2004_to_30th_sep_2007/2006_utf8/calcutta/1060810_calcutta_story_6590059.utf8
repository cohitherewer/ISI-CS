Tech twist to the thread

Calcutta remains the rakhi city. Not in demand, 

but in supply. The biggest hub of rakhi manufacturing all over India celebrated 

a rain-swept Rakhi on Wednesday, with gifts from iPods to jewellery overshadowing 

the good ol thread.

Says Anil Sayal, vice-president, marketing, Safexpress, 

which claims to handle 30 per cent of the rakhi freight in the country, 

and two to three million units from the city: Eighty to 90 per cent of the 

material comes out of Calcutta. It is a cottage industry that is proprietor-driven 

and works business to business in a fragmented fashion.

But 90 per cent of the Calcutta rakhis estimates 

peg the manufacture count at 10 million units are shipped out to Bihar, Uttar 

Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

The Maharashtra rains and the Gujarat floods 

have affected demand only by a small percentage, says Shrikant Mohta, proprietor 

of a nation-wide supply chain of rakhis, Shree Rakhi, at Burrabazaar.

Because it is not a high-end product, surface transport 

is the most popular option though it may take time, adds Sanjoy Roy, business 

head of AFL Wiz, an express service provider in Mumbai.

The great divide between supply and demand is highlighted 

by the fact that the largest manufacturer of rakhis barely figures in the 

top 10 list of buyer of rakhis.

What shoots up in terms of rakhi sales around 

town are gifts traditional and trendy. And whats more trendy than an iPod 

or laptop for bro or sis? The sales went up by about 

50 per cent from the beginning of August for both Friendship Day and Rakhi. Last 

Sunday was particularly busy, says Apple-dealer Sanjay Chordia of Systematix 

Media.

The Nanos (Rs 8,000 to Rs 13,000) are the most popular 

iPod models for Rakhi, while laptops in the Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 range are the 

rage. Accessories such as covers and speakers for iPods are also hot. Pen drives, 

too, are flying off the racks. It is the sisters who are mostly buying tech 

gifts for the brothers, points out Sanjay.

At Landmark, apart from the regular gift buys, iPods 

and CD-ROMs have sold well. Says CEO Gautam Jatia: Out of 100 people dropping 

in for Rakhi gifts, almost 30 have gone in for electronic gadgets. Tech-savvy 

youngsters are bored by the same old gifts. Gadgets are gifts that impress them, 

and budget is no longer an issue.

The city has certainly witnessed a dramatic widening 

of the Rakhi gift basket. Earlier, a Rakhi gift would be restricted to soft 

toys and stationery. Today, 30 per cent of our Rakhi gift buyers have gone ahead 

and bought perfumes, says Ranjan Purkayastha, general manager Nik Nish. 

Paco Rabanne, Carolina Herrera, Hugo Boss and Davidoff are pop picks, so what 

if they are priced anything between Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000?

Polyresin flower vases priced Rs 2,400-plus and imitation 

zed marble love figurines at Rs 900-plus have been additions to the gift list 

this week. After all, a gift today is a blend of looks and utility, 

reasons Ranjan.

And the client list today is no longer just non-Bengali. 

Every second or third customer visiting our store for a Rakhi buy is a Bengali. 

They might not go in for the really high-end gifts but they are certainly ready 

to spend on articles in the mid-bracket, observes Gautam. This is reiterated 

by Ranjan who feels Bengalis are drawn by the whole idea of being part of 

the celebrations and having some fun.

The yellow metal is also hot in the Rakhi race. At 

Tanishq, hosting an array of gold rakhis priced anything between Rs 1,500 

and Rs 3,000, around 35 per cent of footfalls during this period is Rakhi-related. 

Also on offer are pendants priced at Rs 1,500-plus. As Dwaipayan Sen, regional 

business manager, east, Tanishq, put it: The whole idea of gifting has evolved. 

A pendant or a gold rakhi is an asset.

At Archies, City Centre, an array of showpieces, crystal-embellished 

watches and jewellery, all priced at Rs 1,000-plus, has sold well. Earlier, 

you had brothers giving cash to their sisters. Over the last two to three years, 

brothers choose to drop in and splurge on gifts, says Gautam Shroff from 

Archies.

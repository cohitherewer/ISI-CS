 Minissha Lamba in Anthony 

 Kaun Hai and (below) with Arshad Warsi in the film

 She was in town for only a few hours on Saturday, but ensured that she got her first taste of mishti doi and phuchka. It was my first trip to the city and there was no way I could have possibly missed out on these little pleasures of life, gushed Minissha Lamba, looking very different from her no-make-up look in Yahaan. I am a complete foodie and I dont mind experimenting with delicacies.

 Its the same with movies. Critically acclaimed for her natural performance in the Shoojit Sircar film, Minissha has signed a bouquet of films ranging from hardcore commercial stuff to the multiplex variety. As luck would have it, they are releasing back to back. Within weeks of her boardroom bytes in Corporate, she is dancing on Bangkoks river banks in Anthony Kaun Hai. I had signed the films at different times and even shot them at different times, but they are all coming together, she said, a tad exasperated.

 When Minissha had signed Corporate, she had quite a meaty role on paper, but by the time it got translated on to the big screen, it was reduced to a blink-and-miss appearance. This happens at all levels and is very much a part of the film process, said the Delhi girl, sounding mature for her years. Once you sign a film you go along with it, no matter what happens.

 And why did she sign the film in the first place? It was not run-of-the-mill and you dont get to hear such a story at every second script meeting, pat came the reply. Such films were made by Shyam Benegal in the 80s. Its just good to be part of a film like Corporate.

 No such claims about Anthony Kaun Hai, though. It is a completely commercial film, said Minissha. It is a thriller but not a dark one. The film is full of life and colours. It is a plot-driven narrative and has all the elements of a masala potboiler.

 But having been wrapped up in Kashmiri shawls almost throughout Yahaan, was it difficult to go all glam in Anthony Kaun Hai? I guess being a part of the industry, if you are not doing various kinds of roles, you are doing injustice to yourself, Minissha said. So rather than just doing one thing, I would always prefer to experiment with my image and hopefully pull it off every time.

 Its been some time that she had shot for the film, but Minissha still cant stop going ga-ga over Anthony Kaun Hai co-star Arshad Warsi. He is so easy to get along with and the best thing about him is that he is passionate about every single aspect of the process of film-making, she said. These days you cant just be a segregated part of the unit, you have to be involved in everything.

 If she is all praises for Arshad, 

 Minissha has also got nice things to say about her Rocky 

 co-star Zayed Khan. He is not only one of the hippest 

 and coolest young actors in the industry, he is a wonderful 

 human being, she said. He is extremely down to earth and 

 will go out of his way to make everyone around him comfortable.

 In Rocky, Minissha plays Zayeds love interest who helps him face his demons and tackle his past. But in the film Zayed has another love interest in Isha Sharvani, just like Arshad has Anusha in Anthony Kaun Hai.

 But do the rules of the Bollywood game allow her to share the screen space and duration with other actresses? Well, Minissha had her answers ready. Today, lots of films, made under the biggest of banners, have a multi-star cast. Very few films these days are made with one heroine. The driving force today is more. And it works from every angle, from the makers to the viewers, signed off one of Bollywoods best prospects, confidence personified.

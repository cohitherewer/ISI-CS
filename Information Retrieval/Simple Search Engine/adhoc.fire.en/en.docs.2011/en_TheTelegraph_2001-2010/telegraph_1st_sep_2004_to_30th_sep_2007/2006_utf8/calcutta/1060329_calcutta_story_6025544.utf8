The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Watch eclipse on the Net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta may well miss out on the total solar eclipse on Wednesday, but Calcuttans need not. 

 The first major astronomical event of the year, which the city has only a ?two per cent? chance of catching, will be beamed live over the Internet on a host of sites (see graphic).

 If one of them will see NASA scientists providing a view of the sun from a Roman amphitheatre in Side, Turkey, another will have researchers from the University of Cape Coast in Ghana upload the videos from the African country.

 Live and archived videos of the eclipse from places like Libya and Egypt will also be available on the Net.

 The total eclipse will be visible from within a narrow corridor traversing half the Earth, with countries like Libya, Egypt, Turkey and Mongolia being able to observe the four-and-a-half-minute long full eclipse.

 ?The path of totality will pass through the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the African continent. After passing through Libya and Egypt, it will cross the Mediterranean and will move through Turkey and some of the central Asian countries, ending up finally in the plains of western Mongolia,? said Debiprosad Duari, director, research amp; academics, MP Birla Planetarium.

 In India, cities from which the full eclipse can be viewed include Amritsar, Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Udaipur and Jodhpur. For Calcutta, the eclipse will start at 5.02 pm and last till 5.45 pm, with the celestial event reaching its peak at 5.24 pm. ?But with sunset occurring at 5.45 pm, it will be difficult to observe the eclipse in the fading sunlight,? Duari explained. 

 The planetarium is not making arrangements for public viewing this time. ?The sun will be low on the western horizon and the tall buildings and trees nearby will also obstruct the view,? Duari added.

 Though a total solar eclipse ? occurring roughly once in every one-and-a-half years somewhere on Earth ? is not a very rare phenomenon in astronomical time-scales, a nearly identical eclipse (total, annular or partial) occurs only in every 6,585 days, or 18 years and 11 days.

 India will be able catch a glimpse of the next solar eclipse only on August 1, 2008, when the path of totality passes through Nepal, China and Central Pacific, besides India.

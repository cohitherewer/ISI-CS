 Entally robbery not first crime bid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The robbery attempt in an Entally apartment on Monday afternoon was not 19-year-old Rakesh Udar?s first foray into crime. He was involved in a snatching in Delhi three months ago.

 During interrogation, Rakesh revealed that Delhi police had arrested him in April. ?I had to spend more than a week behind bars,? he said.

 Deputy commissioner of Calcutta Police (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said that the information had been conveyed to Delhi police and a reply was awaited.

 Rakesh, a Class-IX dropout of an English-medium school in Delhi, also told the cops that he was thrown out of the institution after his first crime.

 According to police, he had got involved with criminals in Delhi and had started living on his own. 

 ?But I had never touched a gun. I had no idea what a firearm looked like. I bought the gun for Rs 6,000 from goons in Patna,? Rakesh claimed.

 Deputy commissioner Chatterjee added that a team of cops would leave for Patna in a day or two. ?Whatever information we have gathered so far is based on Rakesh?s statements, which may be true or false. His criminal antecedents, too, are yet to be verified.?

 The teenager, who ran away from his Palam Colony residence in Delhi a couple of weeks ago and came to Calcutta via Patna, was produced at Sealdah court and remanded in police custody till June 30. Police have charged him with attempting robbery and carrying a firearm illegally. 

 Around 1.20 pm on Monday, he entered a multi-storeyed building on Munshibazar Road after finding the main gate unguarded. He entered the third-floor apartment of a businessman on finding its door open.

 Locking the main door from inside, Rakesh took out cash and jewellery from four almirahs, holding the three women in the flat at gunpoint. 

 His plans were foiled when one of them threw chilli powder in his eyes. As he ran to the washbasin, the women ran out of the apartment and bolted the door. Rakesh went on a shooting spree, but was soon caught by police.

 Harvard has come to Circus Avenue, but only to clear its name. 

 It?s taken a neighbourhood medical store to bring to town the flagship of the Massachusetts-based university, through which have passed seven US presidents and 40 Nobel laureates.

 Harvard College is engaged in a legal battle with Harvard Medicare Pvt Ltd on Circus Avenue, allegedly using the name illegally.

 The oldest institute for higher learning in the US has won the first round, with a district judge of Alipore court issuing an interim injunction against the diagnostic centre bearing the same name.

 A compensation of Rs 1 lakh has been claimed from the defendant. Justice P. S. Dutta has issued the injunction against Harvard Medicare Pvt Ltd till March 29.

 ?We have sent a legal notice to the company. If the injunction is violated, then a contempt application will be filed in the court,? said Prabir Basu, one of the advocates fighting the case for Harvard College.

 In the second week of September 2005, Harvard learnt of Harvard Medicare Pvt Ltd in distant Calcutta.

 The authorities immediately asked their solicitors and advocates, Agarwal Associates of New Delhi, to serve a notice.

 A notice was served on the store on September 13, asking it to drop the name Harvard, exclusive to the prestigious US campus.

 Harvard Medicare?s counsel replied on October 7, refusing to comply with the request.

 ?Our clients had set up a diagnostic centre under the name and style of Harvard Medicare and Research Institute in or about 1999, duly incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, and subsequently the name and style of the said diagnostic centre was changed to Harvard Medicare Pvt Ltd,? said the letter from the advocate. 

 C.J. Associates, advocates for Harvard Medicare, have threatened to move Calcutta High Court, if required. ?There are so many firms using the name and we have sent the plaintiff (Harvard College) a list of such names,? said T. K. Jana of C. J. Associates.

 ?The name can be used by anyone and if they have to take any action, they have to proceed through the Registrar of Companies for deletion of the name,? he added.

 Lawyers representing Harvard College are clear that ?the use of the mark Harvard by the defendants is unethical, illegal and against the law?. And it has been done, they allege, ?with a view to trade in on and benefit from the reputation and goodwill existing and enjoyed by Harvard?.

 They pointed out that under the Trade Mark Act, 1999, a special protection has been given to a category of well-known trademarks, which includes Harvard.

 And there is a precedent to the name-blame game. Harvard had earlier filed a case against a private educational institute in New Delhi. In 2003, a Delhi court had ordered an injunction, prompting the proprietor to drop ?Harvard?.

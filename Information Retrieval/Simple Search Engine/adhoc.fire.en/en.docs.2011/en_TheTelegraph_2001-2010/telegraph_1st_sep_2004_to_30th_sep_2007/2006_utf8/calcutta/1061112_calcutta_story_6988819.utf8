 What: 

 Opening night of Aqua. 

 Where: The Park. 

 When: Friday, 6 pm onwards. 

 The bash: The opening of the al fresco bar set the ball rolling for all winter parties to come. Not too crowded, not too empty, the party people count was just right. Some sprawled on the decks by the pool, some relaxing on the swings, others busy inside the bar, while DJ Sethis beats kept the tempo going.

 Sip n bite: 

 Seafood Croquets, Philadelphia Cheese Bites, Melon in Parma 

 Ham and Jalapeno and Cheese Poppers as rotating snacks went 

 down well with the guests. The bar, as usual, was the hub 

 of activity. 

 Spotted: The diplomat crowd led by Simon Wilson and Agostino Pinna; jewellery couturist Raj Mahtani, and a host of The Park regulars. 

 Voiceover: This place has really turned out beautiful I can totally see myself coming here very often, smiled Karan Paul, the Apeejay man.

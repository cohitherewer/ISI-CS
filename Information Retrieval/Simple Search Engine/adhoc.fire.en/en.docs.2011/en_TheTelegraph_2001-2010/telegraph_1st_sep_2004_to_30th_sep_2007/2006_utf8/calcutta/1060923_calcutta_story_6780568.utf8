The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lash of rain, sea of woe 

 - On Deluge Day, Metro tours the worst-hit pockets 

 of a marooned Calcutta 

 Boats out on the streets

 RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN:

 grandmother in Kidderpore on Friday afternoon. Picture

 Place: Ekbalpore.

 The last thing a family, arriving 

 from Patna on Friday, would have expected on the streets 

 of Calcutta was a boat ride. But it was a speedboat that 

 dropped them home, on Maulana Mohammed Ali Road, thanks 

 to a police posse that bailed out the marooned family. Two 

 speedboats, parked near Ekbalpore police station, along 

 with the hand-pulled rickshaw, were the only viable mode 

 of transport here.

 Place: Mominpur.

 It was the portrait of an eatery 

 as an island as Hotel Kahkeshan, on Dent Mission Road, saw 

 a row of employees huddled on a row of tables, waiting for 

 the water to recede. The only items on the menu in the vicinity 

 were the flattened rice and molasses being distributed by 

 policemen and local youths on speedboats.

 Place: Thakurpukur.

 Since last night, we have been 

 confined to the bedroom in knee-deep water. With no supply 

 of drinking water and no electricity, we dont know how 

 we will spend the night, cried Bapi De, a resident of the 

 Government Housing Estate in Barisha, Thakurpukur. Residents 

 were seething. No one from the Behala municipality has 

 cared to visit us, grumbled Purnendu Ghosh.

 Place: Behala.

 The approach road to Sourav Gangulys 

 residence was also not spared by the weather gods and civic 

 authorities. Biren Roy Road (East) was under knee-deep water. 

 Never have I seen such waterlogging here; even the puja 

 pandal close to Maharajs house is under water, said Saibal 

 Mitra, a neighbour.

 Place: Tiljala and Topsia.

 Friday prayers were held on the 

 first floor instead of the flooded courtyard of the 

 Gulmarg mosque and another mosque on CN Roy Road, as more 

 than a lakh people living in the area were victims of waterlogging.

 Place: Kumartuli.

 Idols draped in plastic, idol-makers 

 desperately trying to dry the deities, and a trickle of 

 puja organisers failing to take home their Durgas on Mahalaya.

 Place: Chittaranjan Avenue.

 Even the Ambulance headquarters 

 of the CMC and the fire brigade address were flooded. Saving 

 grace: no traffic jam.

 Place: Ultadanga.

 It was hard to spot Ultadanga 

 Main Road. This situation is nothing new; it happens every 

 year, grumbled Ashish Kumar Dutta, standing in knee-deep 

 water. The Ultadanga Bata outlet wore a deserted look.

 Place: College Street.

 A hush had descended over College 

 Street Market. A few shops kept lonely vigil. This could 

 have been such a busy day, but now, not a sari has been 

 sold, trailed off a salesman at Indian Silk House. Bookshops 

 rued the damage to so many books. The last word from a 

 wise man: This is a combination of natures fury and mans 

 negligence.

 Place: Amherst Street.

 Bring on the boats, please.

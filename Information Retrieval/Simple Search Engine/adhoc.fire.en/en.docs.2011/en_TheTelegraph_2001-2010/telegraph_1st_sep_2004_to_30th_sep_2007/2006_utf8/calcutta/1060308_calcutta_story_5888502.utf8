 The Victoria Memorial Hall authorities have undertaken an extensive plan, worth Rs 1 crore, to replace the soil of the grounds, raise the level by two feet, beautify the garden and revamp security.

 Several thousand truckloads of soil, worth Rs 12 lakh, will be brought in from Amtala, in Barasat, and dumped on the 35-acre sprawl around the Memorial. 

 The project, kicked off in February, is being executed by the horticulture wing of the Central Public Works Department and is expected to be wound up by the year-end.

 Memorial curator Chittaranjan Panda said: ?The soil of the garden, last replaced 40 years ago, has lost its fertility due to erosion. The growth of plants and trees in the garden is being hampered.?

 About raising the Memorial garden?s elevation, Panda said the adjacent Citizens? Park, maintained by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, stands higher than the monument grounds. 

 This often leads to waterlogging on the Memorial premises. ?Raising the height of the grounds will solve the problem,? he explained.

 The authorities have also decided on a slew of other projects, including renovation of the garden?s 100-year-old sewerage system, that was damaged during the construction of the Park Street flyover.

 Sprinklers are being installed in the garden. Thirty-four sprinklers have already been installed and 20 more will be put in place.

 The sprinklers ? each can water around 40 sq ft of the garden ? work automatically. ?So long, we had to depend on gardeners for watering the plants. The sprinklers will ensure continuous supply of water,? curator Panda added.

 Along with beautification of the garden, the project aims at stemming environment pollution. Around 1,500 trees ? including mango, guava, neem and mahogany ? have been planted. Another 1,000 will be planted soon. 

 The authorities are also focussing on security. An ?expert committee? had been set up to suggest ways to improve security on the compound.

 The committee has recommended installation of a metal detector, an X-ray machine, a finger-print detector and hidden TV cameras. ?These devices will help us keep a tab on the visitors. It will take six months to instal the devices,? Panda told Metro.

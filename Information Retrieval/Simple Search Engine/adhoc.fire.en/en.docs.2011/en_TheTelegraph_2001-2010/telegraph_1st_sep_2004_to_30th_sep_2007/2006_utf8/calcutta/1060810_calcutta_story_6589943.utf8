 Clashes shatter calm on campus

 AMRITA GHOSH

 After a four-month lull, students unions of Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) again clashed on campus. The violence started late on Tuesday and continued well into Wednesday.

 Second-year undergraduate student Sounik Basu was critically injured in the melee and rushed to SSKM Hospital. He was later operated upon and put on life-support system at CMRI. 

 Around 11 am on Wednesday, registrar and professor-in-charge of student activities Anjan Kumar Ghosh came upon the injured student near hostel no. 11.

 Members of Independent Consolidation (IC), which controls the BE College Students Union, alleged that SFI members came to the hostel with hockey sticks and iron rods on Wednesday morning.

 Most inmates of the hostel were in class at the time. The SFI members reportedly damaged the doors and windows of the hostel and ransacked the belongings of IC students.

 While SFI members were at it, they saw the registrar approaching and jumped from the second floor of the hostel, claimed an IC member. In the process, Sounik, an electrical engineering student, was injured after landing in a drain.

 Cultural secretary of the union Debroop Sengupta said: We have identified the SFI supporters involved in the attack and conveyed their names to the vice-chancellor.

 The general secretary of the SFI-led PG students union, Anirban Biswas, claimed: We have identified seven supporters of the IC who led the attack on the SFI supporters. 

 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjea, vice-chancellor, BESU, called an emergency meeting on Wednesday afternoon. Representatives of students, teachers and staff unions attended the meeting, at which it was decided that indiscipline would be firmly dealt with.

 The BESU authorities have filed an FIR with Shibpur police station. A large contingent from Shibpur, Howrah and Malipanchghora police stations was deployed on campus. 

 Banerjea later said: The students have assured me that they will maintain peace. I have to trust them. So, I have not asked the students to vacate the hostels.

 All campus interviews at BESU have been cancelled.

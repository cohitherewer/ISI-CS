The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Board flight online

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Passengers will no longer have to wait in queues for boarding passes to get on a British Airways flight at Calcutta airport. The airline will soon introduce the e-boarding system.

 ?The facility is already in place in Bangalore and we plan to implement it in Calcutta and the other cities from where we are operating,? an airline official said on Monday.

 Once the facility is available, a passenger with a confirmed ticket can access the airline website and print a boarding pass himself. ?A counter will be set up at the airport for the passengers to collect their luggage tags, after which they can straightway board the flight,? the official added.

 Initial surveys for introducing the system are complete and if things move according to plan, e-boarding can be availed of in six to eight months. ?We are conducting tests before deciding on the time for rolling out the system. One of our teams is evaluating it in Bangalore,? the official told Metro. 

 Airport director V.K. Monga admitted that the airline had submitted a proposal for introducing the e-boarding system. No other airline in Calcutta has the facility.

 At present, British Airways operates three flights from Calcutta. Thirty-five flights operate from London to various cities in India every week. Seven more flights will be added in April and May.

 The British Airways official said the airline is also planning an online ticketing system. ?We are looking into issues related to online ticketing, such as multiple currencies and cross-border barriers.? 

 He added: ?Currently, most of our passengers book tickets through travel agents. We want to provide the customers with a number of options, so they can choose between booking tickets through agents, dealing directly with us or booking berths and making payments online.? 

 Sources said the airline has been registering a steady rise in passenger load on the Calcutta-London route. 

 Although there is no immediate plan of increasing the number of flights from Calcutta, officials said they were ?constantly monitoring the eastern India market, which has been witnessing significant growth?.

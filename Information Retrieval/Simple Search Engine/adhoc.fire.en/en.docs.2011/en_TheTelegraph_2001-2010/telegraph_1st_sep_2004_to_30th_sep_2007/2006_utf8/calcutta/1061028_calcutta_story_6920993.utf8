 Wetland plan raises brows

 - New report proposes same set of projects rejected earlier

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The detailed project report (DPR) on developing a natural and wetland interpretation centre on the East Calcutta Wetlands listed as a Ramsar site has drawn criticisms from environmentalists and activists.

 The Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) will submit the report to the East Calcutta Wetland Authority soon.

 Wildfowl amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT), a British consulting outfit, prepared the report at a cost of around Rs 50 lakh along with a local organisation, Centre for Environmental Management and Participatory Development (CEMPD).

 WWT has sent the report to the CEIP and we, in turn, have forwarded it to the departments concerned for their comments latest by October, said Rajiva Sinha, of CEIP. 

 Earlier, the Union environment and forest ministry had rejected the states East Calcutta Wetlands Management Action Plan, which included recommendations like interpretation centre and eco-tourism. 

 Despite the rejection of the earlier report, the latest report has also come up with an identical set of proposals. 

 We know the Centre is not keen on an interpretation centre in Bantala, agreed Sinha. According to the DPR, the centre referred to as East Calcutta Wetland Park in the report will be promoted as a resource centre for researchers, a place to hold meetings and seminars and a tourist spot. The report also talks about earmarking around 2,000 acres to develop recreational facilities.

 It recommends that access to the centre, off Basanti Road, should be increased with more buses and taxis. It also recommends creation of parking space for 150 cars and 15 coach bays.

 Development of a marketplace to promote local food products and handicrafts, setting up of an auditorium and an education centre, creation of separate areas for children and corporate houses are also recommended. 

 Different types of ecosystems will be developed to attract birds.

 Environmentalists are up in arms against the report. It seems the only interest is promoting bio-diversity and ecotourism. But the wetlands got the Ramsar recognition for its uniqueness in treating waste water naturally, said Dhrubojyoti Ghosh, questioning the focus of the report. 

 The issue of transparency has also been raised. The report has been hurriedly prepared without consulting most of the stakeholders, alleged green activist Subhas Dutta. 

 If we are not yet ready with a management action plan even four years after the Ramsar listing, what is the urgency for an interpretation centre? wondered Ghosh.

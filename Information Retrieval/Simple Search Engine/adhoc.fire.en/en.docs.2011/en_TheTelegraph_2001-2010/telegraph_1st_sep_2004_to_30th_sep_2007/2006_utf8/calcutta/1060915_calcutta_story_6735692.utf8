 Wooing with brand basket

 A pair of the latest-cut indigo Diesel jeans or an Abercrombie amp; Fitch shirt this Pujas? Or maybe a couple of FCUK tees from the fall-winter range?

 Iconic international brands are now at arms length and wallets reach. Clothes Rack, which opened its doors on Rowland Road this April, is a retail rendezvous with a difference, bringing under one roof for the first time in Calcutta such high-profile overseas brands through export surpluses.

 This is the first city outlet of the Mumbai-based chain with export-surplus stores in Pune, Ahmedabad, Kolhapur, Nagpur and Jaipur besides the seven Clothes Rack outlets in Mumbai.

 The USP of Clothes Rack is the availability of the trendiest in international fashion at bargain-basement prices. The other plus is the quick replenishment cycle as our supply chain is geared to put fresh stocks on the racks every eight days, says Minakshi Tusnial, Calcutta franchisee, who often alerts regular customers about new arrivals on SMS.

 From jeans, cargoes, three-quarters, formal and casual shirts, T-shirts and shorts for men to jeans, tops and wraparounds for ladies and teens to kidswear, Clothes Rack offers a wide range of branded garments with a pocket-pinch band of Rs 150 to Rs 1,200.

 With more and more Calcuttans travelling abroad and getting exposed to brands like Zara and Ralph Lauren Polo, the aspiration level is rising all the time. A format like this allows them to indulge that passion without burning too deep a hole in the pocket, offers Madhusudan Binani, who has provided the premises on a revenue-sharing basis.

 As more international brands come and manufacture in India, we will have more export surpluses to be sold in stock lots, necessitating more such outlets, adds Binani, himself a retailer of big-ticket brands in town.

 othes Rack is planning two more outlets in Calcutta, maybe in the next six months itself, given the response at Rowland Road.

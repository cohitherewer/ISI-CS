 The blast at the Iskcon temple in Imphal has prompted Calcutta Police to bolster security in and around the temples in the city. Armed cops, in uniform and plainclothes, have been deployed at the popular places of worship.

 We dont want to leave any loophole that one can utilise to carry out subversive activities. We are strengthening the security ring around major temples as part of precautionary measures, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee. 

 According to police, security has been tightened around Birla, Kalighat, Swaminarayan, Jain and Dakshineswar temples.

 Officers have been directed to keep a close eye on all the devotees entering the temples. Besides, cops in plainclothes will keep a watch on the thoroughfares in front of the places of worship, stated an officer at Lalbazar police headquarters

 Private security guards posted at some of these temples have been instructed to frisk people before they enter the premises. They have been asked to immediately alert policemen if they find any abandoned object, added the officer. 

 Personnel of High Radio Flying Squad (HRFS) have been asked to be in touch with Lalbazar control room. In case of an emergency, officers of local police stations will contact the control room and the message will be passed on to HRFS personnel. This will enable us to take prompt action, the officer explained.

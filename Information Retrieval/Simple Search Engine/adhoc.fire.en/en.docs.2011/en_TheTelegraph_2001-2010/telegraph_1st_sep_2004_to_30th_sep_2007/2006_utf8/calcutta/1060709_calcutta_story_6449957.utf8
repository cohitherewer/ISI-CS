The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 World sounds at home hotspots

 Console Call 

 The Calcutta party people have opened their ears to 

 a variety of international dance music from 

 reggaeton, hip-hop, R amp;B to house and trance. DJ 

 Girish turns the tables

 Lose yourself Eminem (top) 

 and Hips dont lie Shakira

 Ole, 

 ole? ole, ole... Thats the tune I still hear today 

 and with the World Cup reaching a climax, its time 

 to highlight the outgoing party animal Calcuttan 

 and his ties with the music world.

 This Calcuttan has a varied choice of music to pick from today, both national and international. But when it comes to music, music that gets one nostalgic or pumps ones adrenaline, sets a chill-out mood or brings out the party animal in you, Calcutta maange more.

 Thats what makes them flock to their favourite night spots where the DJ serves up popular music on a platter. Well, we as DJs have to do a whole lot of research for Calcuttans make a diverse but discerning music audience. Quality sound is what they always demand.

 Talking about dance music, both the young and the not so young have opened their ears to a variety of international sounds of dance music. With salsa and Latino workshops happening in every night club and spa, the brand new flavour to hit the Calcutta dance floor is reggaeton, a sound combining hip-hop, R amp;B and reggae.

 If you still fail to identify this genre, get yourself a copy of the hit single Hips dont lie (Shakira) and you will know what Im talking about. Well, there are loads of tracks like the one mentioned above and its a whole new music world that opened up with Turn me on, a real rage a couple of years ago.

 Hip-hop and R amp;B were not so popular here five years back, but now every dance floor rocks to artistes like the Pussycat Dolls, Nina Sky, Black Eyed Peas and more. But how can one forget the likes of 2pac, Notorious B.I.G., Arrested Development, the pure rap artists only to be replaced by the modern day Ludacris, Eminem, 50 Cent, to name a few?

 The other most popular genre of international dance music, which I am personally in love with and push to the limits, is house. The sound of house music emerged in the 80s when disco was ruling the roost. Then came a sound within a powerful bass line, delightful and soulful vocals and funky rhythm patterns, which classified disco music to house music.

 Calcutta has danced to some great house anthems like Shiny disco balls, Lady, Rapture, Satisfaction, Drop the pressure to name a few common ones. Such was the rage of these tracks that they began to play like Bollywood numbers in night spots and even private parties. 

 But this is not just it. House has its own subdivisions ranging from funky disco house to tribal from deep dark house to progressive house, each one having its own repertoire.

 Talking about the new-age sound of 2006, its electro house and the artistes who have brought this change are Sebastian Ingrosso, Axwell, Mark Knight, etc. One can also hear the retro and rock classics remixed with the house sounds like Summer of 69, Money for nothing, Smoke on the water. 

 The next level of sound that my Calcutta party animal is very well in tune with is trance music. This is like a religion for people who believe in it, as they say, In trance we trust. Artists like Tiesto and John Flemming are like gods to their audiences and Im one such disciple of trance music, too. Given space, I do a whole transformation of playing a set for the clubbers who come to Shisha on Wednesday and Friday nights.

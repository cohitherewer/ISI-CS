 Cosmetic care

 What: A beauty workshop by Bridgette Jones.

 Where: Dalhousie Institute. 

 When: Sunday evening. 

 The workshop: Beauty talk is always a big draw for women and the crowd turnout at DI proved just that. 

 The evening began with a demonstration of the Marine Spa facial by Aviance. Perfect to wake up the skin and provide an instant glow, the facial was a huge hit with the ladies. 

 Next up, Bridgette taught her audience how to achieve the perfect evening make-up, pre-requisites of which are intense eyes and a glossy mouth. 

 The beautician then went on to answer several queries on pigmentation, skin worries and other common beauty dilemmas. 

 On offer were prizes for those carrying maximum number of make-up products or wearing the highest number of bangles. 

 The finale came in the form of two quick hairdos by the beauty expert who boasts her own beauty salon on Sarat Bose Road.

 Voiceover: The interaction was great and everyone went back feeling so knowledgeable and equipped?That was the idea of the workshop, smiled Bridgette.

 It was sweet surrender by the 

 quayside in Raffles country, with taste buds tantalised 

 by the charisma of Indian coastal cuisine. On Wednesday 

 evening, Singapore, the gourmet capital of Southeast Asia, 

 welcomed a brand new bastion in the heart of Clarke Quay, 

 its hot spot of chic clubs, bars and bistros, with Calcutta 

 calling the tune. 

 Ivory The Indian Kitchen and Shisha 

 Lounge Bar, offerings from PDK Shenaz Hotels Singapore Pte 

 Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of the same promoters who 

 gave Calcutta Grain of Salt and Shisha, were ceremonially 

 launched after a six-week trial run, marking Brand Bengals 

 first foray into the island nations (Sing)$ 5-billion F amp;B 

 industry.

 With its signature Malabari Trio 

 and Matki Dum Murgh, Methi Saag Reshmi Paneer and Mutton 

 Pepper Fry, Fish Balcho and Masala Crab Cake, Ivory, the 

 plush 90-seater restaurant, takes the diner on a cross-coastal 

 culinary trek around the Indian peninsula, from Goa to the 

 Konkan, all the way to Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

 The coastal spread is complemented 

 by an equal share of exotic dishes from the kitchens of 

 the Nizam of Hyderabad, anchored by chef Wali Ahmad, back 

 in the PDK fold after a stint on his own in Boston.

 The Shisha bar seats 70 and serves 

 Indian Tapas (Spanish for finger food) like Spicy Lamb Sheek 

 Kebab, Steamed Fish with Sweet Mango and Coriander Ginger 

 Shrimp with Sweet Chilli Sauce. 

 Theres a lot of standard Indian 

 cuisine available in Singapore. So, we thought lets do 

 something strategically monopolistic, and decided on the 

 coastal cuisine for Ivory, which also marks the first footprint 

 in our global plans, explained Nitin Kohli, director of 

 the PDK Shenaz Group. 

 Next stop for the group is also 

 in Singapore, Go India, an all-day dining stop in Vivo City, 

 Harbour Front Asia s largest mall spread over a million 

 square feet set for an October 6 rollout.

 PDK hopes to be in London by the 

 first quarter of next year and lay its tables in New York 

 by end-2007. The company will henceforth segregate its fine-dining 

 and all-day dining brand profiles, with the former called 

 Ivory everywhere. Even Grain of Salt will be subsequently 

 rechristened Ivory. 

 After pondering over KL and Dubai, 

 we chose Singapore because of its excellent ties with India, 

 its proficiency in e-business (20-odd licences were obtained 

 in a week) and easy accessibility, said Pankaj Tandon, 

 managing director, PDK Shenaz Singapore Pte Ltd.

 With over 600,000 Indian visitors 

 every year and its large expat Indian population, there 

 couldnt have been a better take-off pad than Singapore. 

 But the toughest ask was convincing 

 the locals that we have a winning product and are bringing 

 something new to the table, felt Arvind Bhatnagar, executive 

 director, operations. 

 The setting itself has its own 

 charm and challenges. Clarke Quay, located at the edge of 

 the Singapore River, has always been the place where things 

 come together in its most vibrant form.

 The 19th-century heritage shop-houses, 

 once used as warehouses to store goods shipped from shores 

 afar, are now home to nearly 35 tenants, with current owners 

 CapitaLand pumping in over (Sing) $80 million in a major 

 renewal drive. 

 The nucleus to rare experiences 

 with its array of restaurants, wine bars, entertainment 

 hotspots and chill-out places, Clarke Quay is now made fuller 

 by the Angel-Sky architecture towering above with climate-modifier 

 devices and its riverside dining set upon giant lily pads 

 and bluebell canopies. 

 Rubbing shoulders with such iconic 

 destinations like Indo-Chine (Vietnamese), Chijmers, the 

 signature restaurant of giant Chinese chain Le Garden, Brewerkz, 

 the German beer brewery-cum-restaurant and local titan Jumbo 

 Seafood, Ivory isnt short of competition. The young promoters 

 are buoyant itll shine though. 

 The response to our trial runs 

 has been extremely encouraging and we as a team are ready 

 for the location litmus test. This is a proud moment for 

 the entire trade in Calcutta, smiled Nitin. 

 His thoughts were echoed by Alok 

 Prasad, Indian high commissioner in Singapore and guest 

 of honour at the high-heeled launch party, also attended 

 by a fair sprinkling from the local media.

 Prasad pointed out that for the 

 first time, an Indian restaurant has been set up in Singapore 

 by a 100 per cent Indian company. 

 While Rang Mahal, a popular Indian 

 eating house on the island, is run by the Hong Kong-based 

 Jhunjhunwalas, Song of India is operated by an Australian 

 concern.

 Come together for a cause

 The Ramakrishna Sarada Sevashram home in Hotor has virtually become my second home. I remember the first time I went there as a volunteer, the kids were too shy to talk to me. In time, they came out of their shells and mingled with us volunteers.

 Ruma, 11, dreams of becoming a devotional singer. I remember how she had once sneaked up on me from behind and hugged me. I turned to see her in a red-bordered white sari with a puja thali in her hand. She looked divine. The other girls at the home are as sweet, mischievous and talented.

 I celebrated last Kali puja at Kishalaya home in Barasat. The premises had not been lit up properly and I could hardly see anybody?s face. At first glance, little Kaushik seemed very acrimonious. But soon enough, he melted. He revealed how his mother was given electric shocks by his father. He hadn?t met his siblings in a long time. He dreamed of growing up and working, so that he could return home and help his mother.

 When the firecrackers were burst, I could see his face cringe with fear as he fought back tears.

 Heart-rendingly vulnerable, yet threateningly precocious, these underprivileged children remain poised between freedom and entrapment, liberation and confinement, welfare and rights. It is easy to ignore their existence for our own benefit, to pretend they aren?t there to avoid doing something about it. But it is impossible to overlook them, to forget their faces.

 All of them, like other children their age from more privileged backgrounds, have the right to health, nutrition, protection from exploitation, abuse and neglect, right to development, education, care and recreation.

 I am sure this year more young people can make a difference in the kids? lives and volunteer with NGOs and homes for underprivileged children to improve their conditions. They need and deserve our love and care.

 A dash for the past

 The cloudy, gloomy weather on the morning of December 22 could do little to dampen the spirits of the students of Modern High School for Girls. After all, it was their annual sports day. 

 After the ceremonial marchpast, the junior students presented their events. The races for the senior students were held, interspersed with dance, karate and drill displays by the juniors.

 The audience watched the youngsters dance the samba, Arabian and Indian dances. The bright costumes and the joy on their faces made up for the lack of sunshine. Parents egged their children on.

 The Old Girls? Race was the most awaited event of the day. In fact, it had to be modified into a relay race to accommodate the overwhelming number of entries. The ex-students sported their old sashes representing the various houses of the school.

 For some, their alma mater had changed significantly since their school days, with a multitude of new faces, changed uniforms and restructured classrooms. Yet, the exhilarating sports meet brought back fond memories of the times they had spent here.

 Bard talk

 The English department of our college hosted a lecture on ?The relevance of studying Shakespeare in today?s life?, delivered by Soma Banerjee of the English department of Rabindra Bharati University, who has to her credit a PhD in Shakespearean works. ?Students remember Shakespeare?s works not just as examination fodder, but derive pleasure from it,? she said. Shakespeare, she added, would never go out of fashion and therein lies his significance. It was a thought-provoking seminar and we look forward to more such events.

 Annual day

 St Stephen?s School, Dum Dum, celebrated its annual day on December 15 at Science City auditorium. The stage came alive with scintillating performances by the children. A theatrical adaptation of Guy De Maupassant?s The Diamond Necklace was followed by a foot-tapping choreography by the school?s teachers.

 The screening of a documentary on the school, that was started in 1971, was an opportunity for us ex-students to take a walk down memory lane. 

 Achievers in academics and other fields were felicitated at the function. The cultural extravaganza was followed by a rocking performance by Bangla band Fossils.

 Fight for rights on screen

 Out On TV hasn?t been raking in the ratings, but this TV programme is a groundbreaking one ? it comprises a series of 10 short interviews with gay, bisexual and transgender people and those who have worked closely with them. It has been on air since December 24, on Bangla Ekhon.

 India?s first ?television NGO? Kolkata Sukriti Foundation, along with Solidarity and Action Against The HIV Infection in India (SAATHII), an NGO that focuses on HIV/AIDS and related issues of sexuality, human rights and sexual health, has co-produced the programme. In each episode, the interviewees share their experiences of discrimination and violence ? in public spaces, educational institutions, at work and even in their homes.

 The episodes include reactions from public figures like social activists Maitrayee Chatterjee and Paromita Banerjee, counsellor Jolly Laha, lawyer Gitanath Ganguly, artist Paritosh Sen, actors Koneenica Banerjee, Kaushik Sen and Roopa Ganguly, and Cactus lead singer Siddhartha Ray.

 Cast and crew members of the film My Brother Nikhil (picture above) ? director Onir and actors Lilette Dubey, Purab Kohli and Sanjay Suri ? also figure in one episode. In another episode, members of Sapphire Creations Dance Workshop share their experiences of the making of The Alien Flower, India?s first ballet on same sex love.

 The underlying theme of the series is: Why should people who do not subscribe to society?s norms on sex, gender and sexuality be treated like outcasts? Is there any logic in discriminating against them? Should laws that criminalise same sex love be allowed to continue even as the Planning Commission recommends their revision and National AIDS Control Organisation works on sexual health initiatives for them across the country?

 The episodes are subtitled in English. The programme will later be compiled into a VCD to spread the message of awareness.

Living room laws for happy moments 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 I firmly believe that money spent in making your home comfortable and beautiful is more of an investment rather than expenditure. This is because most of us spend a lot of time at home. One area in the house that needs our attention is the drawing room.

 The living room is the shoulder of the house where we entertain guests, throw parties and hold important family celebrations. 

 It is a pleasure to have a living room with good Feng Shui, as it creates an ambience of harmony and brings about a jovial atmosphere of togetherness and security.

Den diktat

Nowadays, people usually create two separate areas, 

one with a formal set-up used exclusively to entertain guests and the other where 

the entire family relaxes together after the days work. Here they all spend 

precious moments watching television, listening to music or sharing their days 

experiences with each other. So this becomes the den where the family bond is 

strengthened. 

 The decor of this area should be extremely warm and comfortable rather than formal. One could have a low and comfortable seating arrangement here. The focal point on the eastern wall should be an enlarged family photograph capturing a happy moment. 

 Decor Do : According to Feng Shui, the 

drawing room is the shoulder of the house where we entertain guests as well as 

spend precious moments with the whole family. Hence, the decor of this room deserves 

special attention. The colour code of the drawing room should be determined by 

the direction in which the room is located. The layout and furniture placement 

should be done in a way to enhance the smooth flow of Chi. 

Layout rules

On the other hand, formal drawing rooms are usually 

done up in an ornamental manner, which apart from being uncomfortable becomes 

lifeless over a period of time. Feng Shui offers some precious tips to liven up 

this area with the help of proper placement of furniture, plants and flowers. 

 One should keep the doors and windows of the drawing room open for maximum time possible to allow fresh Chi to circulate in the room. It is important to have fresh plants here so that they could nourish the room with oxygen. These could be changed on a weekly basis. 

 The furniture arrangement should be such that they form a square, octagonal or round shape. Such arrangements give Chi a chance to move around freely. Bigger pieces like sofas should be placed with their backs against solid walls, preferably towards south, west and south-west sectors of the living room. 

 Try to keep the north-east corner of the drawing room clear of any kind of heavy piece of furniture. Do not place the sofas below beams, where they constantly press down the Chi and make people uncomfortable.

 Keep the centre of the drawing room clear of a large and heavy centre table. If at all it is needed, keep a light-weight centre table with an arrangement that has a perfect blend of all the five elements of nature. This arrangement strengthens the energies flowing from different directions that merge and interact with each other at the central point of the room. Create a pretty basket of these elements by filling a shallow crystal bowl or a plate with fresh water and then float some fresh seasonal flowers or petals along with colourful pebbles, stones and metal coins. Finally, light a candle in the centre of this arrangement. Apart from looking beautiful, it fills the room with lively and vibrant Chi.

Colour code

Colour is usually a major consideration when decorating 

your living room. There are two ways to go about it. Either you decide the colours 

according to the personal requirement of the master of the house, which is calculated 

from his pillars of destiny, or the location of the room can help you decide what 

colour to bring in. For example, a living room that faces east or south-east could 

be painted in soft shades of green.

 Furnishing and upholstery can boast striped patterns with blends of blue and green. Adding a beautiful green rug or carpet on the floor along with fresh, healthy green plants at strategic points can complete the look. An eastern or south-eastern room done up in shades of green can give tremendous boost to the health and wealth of its residents.

 The living room is where we usually display the best of paintings and artefacts. The golden rule of Feng Shui is that the four cardinal and four inter-cardinal directions of the house, which are extremely powerful, should be enhanced with appropriate colours, elements and artefacts. For example, if the living room is located in the northern sector of the house, then a painting of a waterfall framed in gold or silver on the northern wall can give an unbelievable boost to your career.

 If the living room happens to be in the western sector, then the west wall can be adorned with a gorgeous Tanjore painting, which is rich in gold, silver or copper. 

 If your living room is in the southern sector, the south wall should be highlighted with a painting that suggests yang fire energy. It can have vibrant strokes of all the colours of the fire family like red, maroon, purple, mauve, peach and pink. You can also place beautiful candles here accompanied by green objects.

Tip of the week

If you have a living room in the south-west sector 

of the house, do not forget to enhance your precious marriage corner by placing 

your photo with your spouse here along with a beautiful lamp and a small rock.

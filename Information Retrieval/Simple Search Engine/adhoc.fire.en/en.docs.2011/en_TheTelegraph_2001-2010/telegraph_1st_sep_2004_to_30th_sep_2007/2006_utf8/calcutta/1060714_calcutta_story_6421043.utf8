 Kebab scores over crab

 OLD 

 ADDRESS, NEW MENU

 Fade out Porto Rio, here comes 

 more of Arsalan. Forget experiments with coastal cuisine, 

 Calcutta just wants more of the tried-and-tested culinary 

 combinations.

 The Arsalan Murg Biryani, Arsalan 

 Murg Makhani, Arsalan Jhal Murg Frez that have drawn foodies 

 for the past four years to the Mughlai speciality restaurant 

 at the Park Circus roundabout, are now filling the tables 

 of what used to be Porto Rio.

 For Arsalans popular kebab, 

 chanp and biryani at 191, Park Street have 

 invaded nearby 28, Circus Avenue (at the starting point 

 of the AJC Bose Road flyover) that used to have a niche 

 appeal among those hunting down a rare address for seafood 

 specials.

 Porto Rio dished out some 

 of the best crab dishes in town. Its a pity that the 

 Calcutta food scene isnt evolved enough for such a 

 specialised coastal cuisine place to survive, rued 

 a crestfallen loyalist.

 Saying nay to niche appeal and 

 aye to mass appeal, the Arsalan management has taken over 

 the Porto Rio space for a multi-cuisine restaurant serving 

 Mughlai, Indian and Chinese, of course!

 It was becoming so difficult 

 to manage the crowd at this outlet. The weekends especially 

 were impossible to control, said Akhtar Parvez, director, 

 RAA Arsalan Enterprises.

 We also wanted to experiment. 

 In most places, including Arsalan, authentic Mughlai food 

 is served in a very informal setting. We wanted to add some 

 of the elegance and style traditionally associated with 

 the cuisine. In the new restaurant, people will be able 

 to savour the best of Mughlai food in an appropriate setting, 

 added Parvez.

 But why add chowmein and chilli 

 chicken to a menu card dominated by biryani and Murg 

 Bara Kebab? Like Mughlai, Chinese is a favourite cuisine 

 in Calcutta and there is no decent eating option in the 

 vicinity. Our chefs who have worked in big Chinese restaurants 

 will be serving authentic cuisine, argues Parvez.

 The Chinese section includes Crispy 

 Noodle Salad, Prawn Pepper Salt, Chicken Fried Wanton, Prawns 

 Hube, Lemon Steamed Fish and more.

 The Park Street outlet of Arsalan 

 that opened in October 2002 can pack in more than hundred 

 hungry customers. The new outlet that opened on July 9 has 

 80 covers.

 There has been minor renovation 

 work done as we have tried to retain the warmth of the place. 

 We have, however, re-moulded the kitchen to a large extent 

 in order to customise it to our multi-cuisine fare, 

 says executive chef Sharafat Ali.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

It?s plex time for Darjeeling

Screen On amp; Off

 It may be a perfect 10 for INOX but for Darjeeling, its Multiplex No. 1. 

 This Friday onwards, the Rink Mall on Laden La Road will not be the same anymore with INOX (Darjeeling) throwing its three screens open. Perched 7,000 ft above sea level and converted from existing standalone theatres, the town?s maiden cineplex has a total capacity of 811 seats. 

 With INOX?s 10th plex headed for Darjeeling, patrons there will get their first taste of the best movie-watching facilities, including state-of-the-art projection and acoustic systems, stadium-styled seating and reclining seats. 

 ?Darjeeling interested us immensely since it?s not just a hill station for tourists but the pride of the local people,? Manoj Bhatia, CEO of INOX Leisure Ltd, told Metro. ?We are always on the lookout for opportunities and so, we decided to refurbish the existing property.? 

 The refurbishment has meant that the old-world charm of the place stays intact. So along with the regular seats, INOX (Darjeeling) will have special box seats for exclusive viewing. ?Those tickets will be the costliest and will come for around Rs 150. Then there is the opposite spectrum where people can watch for as little as Rs 40. With its flexible pricing and central location we expect the property to revolutionise movie-watching in the area,? revealed Bhatia. 

 Before the doors of INOX (Darjeeling) are officially opened on Friday, residents can watch free movies all of Wednesday through redemption coupons.

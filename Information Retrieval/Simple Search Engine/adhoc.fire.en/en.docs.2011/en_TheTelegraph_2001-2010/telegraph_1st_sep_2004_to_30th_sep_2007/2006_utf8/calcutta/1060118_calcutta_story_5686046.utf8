The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pen major plans chain

 - Boutique bouquet line-up in the city and elsewhere

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 With the speciality-store culture catching on, it?s time for a Calcutta-based company to pen a whole new retail script.

 In a first for the writing instruments industry, Linc Pen and Plastics is setting up a chain of boutiques in the city and beyond, under the brand name Just Linc. 

 ?The retail initiative kick-started in end-2004, with the first Just Linc store opening at City Centre. Its success prompted us to open similar outlets in four other cities,? said Deepak Jalan, managing director, Linc Pen and Plastics.

 Mumbai, Lucknow, Kanpur and Noida already have Linc pen boutiques. Ahmedabad and Pune are next on the company?s radar. Calcutta already has a second Just Linc outlet at Hiland Park. 

 The company is currently scouting for property to open the third boutique in the city. It should be operational by March.The writing instruments industry is estimated to be worth about Rs 1,800 crore, including an unorganised sector worth Rs 300-Rs 400 crore. Jalan is of the opinion that the unbranded segment is shrinking, with more global players entering the markets.

 ?The real market activity has not started yet but the perception is changing. The industry is growing at 8 to 10 per cent,? he stated. Premium brands like Parker and Sheaffer do not pose a threat to Linc, maintained Jalan. The company?s target customers have always been students, more specifically, school-goers.

 ?Although we have our own premium segment brands like Cruiser, Uni-ball, Bensia and Lami, our focus has always been on the mass market,? stressed Jalan. 

 At the moment, Linc is the only company in the Indian writing instruments industry to retail its own products. The advantage of taking such a step is being in complete control of the marketing, distribution, retail and sales, explained the executive.

 He said: ?The traditional stationery shops do not provide much space for display, so boutiques are great for customers. Moreover, they give a great branding opportunity and a chance to increase our customer base.?

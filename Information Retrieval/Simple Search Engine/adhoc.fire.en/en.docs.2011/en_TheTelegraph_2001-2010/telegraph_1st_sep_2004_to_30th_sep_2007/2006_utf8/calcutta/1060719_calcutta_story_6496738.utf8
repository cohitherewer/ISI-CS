The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Ahead 

 of others, always involved and usually calling the shots?You 

 are sharp; you gain confidence, experience and stature early 

 in life. Even in your soft-spoken way, you are a competitive 

 winner. Sometimes your stubbornness and need to have the 

 final word may irritate others. Though you tend to go over-budget, 

 and splurge on impulse, you are quite realistic with personal 

 spending. ? Kusum Bhandari

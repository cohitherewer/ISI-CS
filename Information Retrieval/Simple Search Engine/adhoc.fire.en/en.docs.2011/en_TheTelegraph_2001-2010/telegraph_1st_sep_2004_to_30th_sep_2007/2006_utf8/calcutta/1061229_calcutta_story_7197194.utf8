 Fast forward: A 

 race of rickshaw-pullers against time 

 Apropos the report No more cheques, 

 pay tax in cash, November 3, the inefficiency of the Calcutta 

 Municipal Corporation knows no bounds. The civic bosses 

 enjoy far too much power and their only motivation is greed. 

 The result is untold sufferings and harassment of tax-payers. 

 The recent decision of the civic body to stop accepting property tax payment through account-payee cheques will result in a great deal of trouble for peace-loving citizens for no fault of their own. The move would only support and encourage inefficiency within the corporation. Employees who hardly do any work would be conveyed the message that they can continue to be lax. 

 About 200,000 honest tax-payers will suffer for the alleged dishonesty of 50,000 people. The physical and financial sufferings of tax-payers at large will throw open opportunities of corruption at all levels of corporation administration. 

 It should not be forgotten that the ban on cheques has imposed an unnecessary financial burden on tax-payers, most of whom will now have to fork out the charges for issuing bank drafts. 

 The civic body should draw a lesson from the income tax department and the CESC. Instead of adopting anti-people policies, the corporation should arrange to collect property tax payments through public sector banks and post offices. 

 Dipak Ranjan Choudhury,

 Prince Anwar Shah Road. 

 Apropos the report Meet to ban rickshaws, November 21, the chief ministers proposal to ban rickshaws is a step in the right direction. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is right in saying that rickshaws are an inhuman form of transportation in the 21st century. 

 Surprisingly, there is no dearth of people in the city who vouch for these wretched vehicles. Their lame argument is that the rickety rickshaws are pollution-free and hence there is no harm in continuing with them. 

 I have a question for these people. If Chennai, Calicut and other south Indian cities could abolish rickshaws overnight back in 1972 and profitably rehabilitate the rickshaw-pullers, why shouldnt Calcutta be ale to do the same now? 

 Sudhanshu Lahiri,

 Motilal Nehru Road. 

 It is distressing to learn that 

 the state government is determined to do away with rickshaws 

 in the city. The environment-friendly, hand-pulled vehicles 

 are a part of the citys culture and play an important role 

 in ferrying people during waterlogging. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

 Apropos the report Quake cry reality check, November 3, the administration ignores the quakes that take place in the city. It is a matter of concern that no comprehensive survey has been conducted on the earthquake threat in the region. Emergency relief arrangements should be made to save the citizens in the event of an earthquake. Members of NGOs and clubs should be taught how to help people affected by earthquake. 

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Bandpur, Hooghly. 

 Apropos the report Ban-tuition bid in ICSE schools, November 3, it is absurd to forcibly prevent teachers from giving private tuitions. If the aim is to enhance the quality of classroom teaching, the teachers should be made aware of their responsibility. The heads of institutions should keep a tab on teachers, whose salary should be commensurate with the demands of their job. Many students will suffer in the absence of help outside classroom. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

 Apropos your report Decibel devils terrorise two households, November 6, why should people suffering at the hands of hooligans always have to report the incidents to police? Isnt it the administrations duty to pre-empt and tackle such situations? If Sudipto Moitra did not need to lodge a complaint with police about members of a local club violating the decibel limit, he would not have been harassed by the men. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the report Cell first, death can wait, November 16, irresponsible use of cellphones has become a social disease. Youngsters use the cellphone recklessly while walking or driving. There is a fine for flouting road rules, but people use lame excuses to avoid paying up. Unless people realise the risks they are taking the law cannot be enforced. 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge.

 Apropos the report Care for fair, not library November 10, it is shocking to see that a 112-year-old library is suffering due to lack of care. The chief minister, who claims to be a man of letters, should concentrate more on preserving these temples of knowledge than holding the Book Fair on the Maidan. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur.

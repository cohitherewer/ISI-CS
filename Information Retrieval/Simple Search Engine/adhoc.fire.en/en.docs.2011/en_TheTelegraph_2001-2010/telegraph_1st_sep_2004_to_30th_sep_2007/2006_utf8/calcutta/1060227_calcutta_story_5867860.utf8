 Alarm bells on hepatitis

 - BAD BLOOD TWIN RISKS

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Take care while opting for a blood transfusion or being administered an injection ? you could be contracting two critical diseases.

 The number of carriers of Hepatitis B and C viruses ? which spread through blood transfusion, and reuse of syringes and blades ? is fast increasing.

 A study by Medical College and Hospital has revealed that six per cent of blood donors in and around Calcutta are infected with the viruses. In 2004, the prevalence was less than four per cent.

 ?Lack of awareness among the people is the principal reason for the rise in the number of carriers,? said Kuntal Biswas, registrar of the hospital.

 Last year, around 1,200 of the 20,000-odd donors were found to be carrying Hepatitis B and C viruses. Of them, 550 were carriers of the B type and more than 600 of the C type. In 2004, around 600 of the 16,000 donors were identified as carriers of the viruses.

 ?The situation can take a serious turn shortly,? warned Sanjay De Bakshi, surgical gastroenterologist of Calcutta Medical Research Institute. Hepatitis B immunisation, he pointed out, has become affordable but most people are not taking to it, despite the fact that the treatment for the disease is not very effective.

 As for Hepatitis C, precaution is the only way, as there is no immunisation from the virus. It can be treated with Interferon, an immuno globulin, at an initial stage, but doctors said the situation in most cases gets out of hand.

 ?Blood banks should be extremely careful while testing samples,? De Bakshi said. Symptoms of both diseases are similar to that of severe jaundice ? fever, nausea, vomiting, pain in the liver and yellow urine. ?Patients with these symptoms should immediately get their blood tested,? he added.

 Hepatitis B isolates have been classified into at least eight genotypes ? A to H. The study has found prevalence of genotypes A, C and D among Hepatitis B positive cases in and around the city. 

 Taking into consideration various reports, the study revealed that genotype C is confined to the eastern part of the India. ?It should be carefully monitored. It is important to know the prevalence of this genotype among donors,? the report states.

 The study has also revealed a rise in HIV-positive cases in the city.

 They can have tipplers dancing to their tunes, but they must not dance themselves. 

 In the face of pressure from police and drawing a lesson from the developments in Maharashtra, where the government closed its doors on dance bars last August, the bar and restaurant-owners in the city have decided not to allow any kind of dancing inside bars. 

 There are a lot of controversies over dancing in bars. The viewers pay huge tips when the girls perform for them. But we want to stop this practice, said S.K. Khullar, vice-president of Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India, the apex body of hotel, bar and restaurant owners.

 Musical evenings can, however, be organised in bars after taking permission from police. Currently, the bar-owners let their floors out for a monthly payment, ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The performers get to keep the tips. 

 Following the decision to ban dancing in bars, the owners have decided to appoint singers as permanent employees. If the singers work for us, we will be able to control them. Besides, they will not have to depend on tips for a living, added Khullar. 

 According to bar-owners, about 500 girls sing at different nightclubs, bars and restaurants. In addition, about 300 dancers, who have come back from Mumbai, have been absorbed in the city bars. 

 If each bar appoints three to five singers, almost all the girls will get a permanent job. Initially, we will request our members to stop dancing in bars. If we do not get the desired response, we will make it mandatory to follow the directive by involving the state tourism department, Khullar explained.

 Most bars host singers to attract the youngsters. But the number of families visiting such nightclubs and restaurants has decreased due to indecent dancing, stated a bar employee.

 We sing to earn a living. We dance because it earns us more money. If we get permanent employment, we can live with our head held high, observed Swapna Mondal, who sings in a bar.

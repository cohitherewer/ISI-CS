 HC off-limit in marks row

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Examinees dissatisfied with their marks can no longer move Calcutta High Court directly, the court ruled on Friday. 

 There have been several cases in the recent past when the court has had to ask for production of the answer scripts to satisfy examinees. 

 After enactment of the State Information Act, the aggrieved examinee will have to approach the state information officer first. If the officer fails to solve his or her problem, the examinee may file an appeal before the appellate authority of the information department. In case of failure there, too, the examinee can come to high court, said the order passed by Justice J. Biswas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 All about the hall

 After a whirlwind tour of the theatre stops in town, Jean-Guy Lecat tells Sebanti Sarkar what he saw

 Positive: 

 Lots of potential.

 Negative: Lack of care. 

 Prescription: Just 

 do it. That would sum up Jean-Guy Lecats report card on 

 Calcuttas theatre halls.

 The Frenchman who has worked with Samuel Beckett, been Peter Brooks set designer and created more than 200 theatres around the world was in town for a workshop hosted by Anya Theatre and Aarshi Theatre groups. 

 He visited some 10 popular theatre spaces, accompanied by workshop participants (mostly young and upcoming directors, actors and technicians). He went around checking acoustics, lighting and other equipment, and seating arrangements.

 This is what Lecat told Metro at the end of his stock-taking mission

 Condition of halls

 These are mostly formal 15th century pieces for which neither the theatre owners nor the theatre people seem to care. It is not just that the halls are old (old is sometimes good), it is the fact that they are in such bad condition. The halls are unclean, the seats are bad who can react properly to your work?

 Battling the odds

 How expensive can it be for a group to replace a tattered curtain? In France, the actors paint their own spaces if they have to, they take up jobs as waiters because it is so difficult to make a living just out of theatre. People here seem to have lost their ability to react and try and solve the problems themselves.

 Show me the passion

 Calcutta has no dearth of talent. There are ideas, texts, and even huge empty spaces to try them out in. It doesnt take too much time or money; what is needed is the energy. 

 It is possible to prepare a play in four afternoons and stage it just anywhere I dont think conditions are all that different in Europe and elsewhere. Yes, technology is better, but human beings and not technology make a theatre. In Calcutta, I see a lot of possibilities if only the actors and the city would wake up, especially since now the audience is so much wider, cutting across class and cultures.

 Look, then leap 

 I dont use the words good and bad for halls, I say useful and not useful. Here you have performances that draw a maximum of 25 people. It is important to ask why. Are the shows not good or is it the hall? Or is the price of tickets too much? 

 From there we must move to how we can make it better. How can we make the old formal halls interesting, exciting places where we can play anywhere and anyhow; maybe cut down the seating arrangements, increase the playing area have the audience sitting on the stage even

 The Minerva Mistake

 Restoring Minerva with its box seats and pillars is a mistake. Beauty is important but not at the cost of theatre. I cannot understand why it cannot be redone to accommodate new plays. 

 The old architecture has a seating arrangement that prevents 90 per cent of the people from seeing the whole stage. The entrance, which does not allow trucks to go right up to the backstage needs to be changed too 

 My idea of space is always linked 

 to the project idea, but in Lisbon, one of my most recent 

 designing projects, the hall is an old formal place turned 

 upside down into an exciting zone for theatrical experiences

 THE LECAT REPORT CARD

 Minerva (Beadon Street). Not useful. Complete 

 overhaul of seating arrangement, acoustics, light settings, 

 stage. Box seats, pillars must go.

 Bijon Theatre (Hatibagan). Not useful. 

 Too formal a hall with many drawbacks.

 Circarena (Hatibagan). Very useful. Something 

 worth fighting for. Good acoustics; seats can be rearranged. 

 Arena stage has many uses.

 Muktangan (SP Mukherjee Road). Could be 

 useful. Very ill maintained, should be revived. Stage is 

 promising, as it extends as a half circle.

 Academy of Fine Arts. Useful. Good intimate 

 stage acoustics; lights passable.

 Rabindra Sadan. Not useful. Huge stage, 

 but a lot of the playing area is lost because the curtain 

 line is so far back from the apron. 

 Bharatiyam (near Salt Lake stadium). Could 

 be Useful. Interesting outdoors.

 pSovabazar Rajbari (Sovabazar). Could be useful. The Thakurdalan 

 holds many possibilities for interesting theatre.

 Rangana (Hatibagan). Could be useful. 

 Number of seats to be reduced; there is possibility of extending 

 the stage in front.

 Seven held in gang bust

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Seven people were arrested on VIP Road, in Baguiati, on Tuesday night after police busted an inter-district gang. 

 The men were arrested after they beat up a traffic constable who prevented their car from crossing the road minutes before the chief minister was scheduled to pass. 

 The men were travelling in a car fitted with a beacon and had initially identified themselves as vigilance department officers. The sticker on their vehicle indicated that the vehicle belonged to the National Human Rights Commission. It was later found that they were carrying fake identity cards of vigilance department officers.

 Around 9 pm, seven men Debkumar Chatterjee, Ramen Rai, Sanjay Mondal, Israjul Sheikh, Niren Biswas, Fajle Mian and Harendra Mondal travelling in a Tata Sumo with a beacon, were stopped near the Baguiati crossing while they were travelling towards the airport. This was a security measure for the chief minister, who was scheduled to drive down the opposite lane from the airport to the city, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 When they insisted on going ahead, a constable stopped them and asked them to wait till the chief ministers convoy had passed, Kumar added. 

 But they got impatient and manhandled the constable. Debkumar and Ramen had planned to park the car on the highway and extort money from truck drivers.

 During the melee, the constable, Arun Sarkar, raised an alarm. Local residents surrounded the seven men. They identified themselves as officers of the vigilance department out on a raid. They pointed out the car on which the beacon was shining, an officer said. 

 But the people did not allow them to move. Later, after the chief ministers convoy had passed, they were taken to the local police station.

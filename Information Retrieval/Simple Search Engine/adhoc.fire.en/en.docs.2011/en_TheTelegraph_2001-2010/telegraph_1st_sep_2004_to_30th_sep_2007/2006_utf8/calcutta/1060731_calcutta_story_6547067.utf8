The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Club fray results late

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Club, one of the city?s premier social clubs, which has been witnessing an election slugfest of its own over the past few months, saw its culmination on Friday, without the results being declared on Saturday, as has been the norm over the past few years. 

 The club, which will be entering its centennial year, witnessed a contest for the post of president after more than a decade and expects to have the results declared on Monday evening. 

 While the delay in declaring the results has surprised many, prompting whispers of malpractice, a number of club members have dismissed such insinuations.

 ?This is not the first time that the results have not been declared immediately,? said a former president. 

 ?In the past, when the votes were counted manually, the club would declare the results after a week. It has to be remembered that Calcutta Club has close to 5,000 members. Therefore, it is a big task and must be absolutely fool-proof,? pointed out a recent past president.

 However, a number of questions have risen with regard to this year?s general elections. 

 The fact that the president?s post is being contested after a gap of a decade or more has raised a number of eyebrows. 

 Also, the fact that TCS, which has been given the task of calculating the votes, has decided to verify every individual signature has not gone down too well with a large number of members. Some of them have even called this year?s campaign ?vicious?.

 ?Unfortunately, whenever there is a contest for such an important post, the club gets completely divided,? admitted a veteran club member.

 ?Going by the relatively smooth elections of the past few years, this signature verification is an unprecedented event. Verification of individual signatures smacks of mistrust,? he pointed out.

 ?In the past, many undeserving candidates have become presidents. But there has to be a better way,? he signed off.

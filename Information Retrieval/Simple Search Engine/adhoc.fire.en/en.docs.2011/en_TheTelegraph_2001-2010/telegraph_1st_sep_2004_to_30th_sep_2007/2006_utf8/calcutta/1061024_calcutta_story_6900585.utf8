 Prize moneys 

 worth

 Chandrima S. 

 Bhattacharya outlines her plans to spend the lakhs 

 she will win from her magnum opus at the Booker next year 

 SEX AND THE CITY

 I am going to win the Booker next 

 year. I was toying with the idea of the Nobel too, but two 

 prizes would be too much money. 

 The novel is about my kitchen. 

 It is a complex narrative about the many masalas I use, 

 in Hindi, and explained in the glossary. But it is actually 

 about the politics of masalas.

 Through the narratives of a love 

 affair between a caste Hindu girl and a subaltern peacock, 

 of a carpet soaked in rich dal and memories, of a small 

 town trembling with communal tension in the backdrop, of 

 havelis bent on telling their autobiographies, of 

 what happened between a pair of old intricate lace curtains 

 and an armchair my grandfather never could sit on, of a 

 detailed discourse on the social forces that lead to the 

 birth of a terrorist and of the dhaniya murgh (coriander 

 chicken) that my grandmothers sister cooked, my novel 

 will explore the question: Why does garam masala dominate 

 Indian cuisine? 

 It could be rephrased as: Why, 

 oh why, does garam masala have to be the flavour of India 

 in every international market, even with books and films? 

 I will call my novel Koh-I-Noor, 

 after the famous basmati rice brand, and all the Is 

 and s will be italicised. 

 But the most exciting question 

 is, what will I do with the Rs 42 lakh that I will get? 

 Honestly, I dont know. There will be some money to 

 give away as tax, but there will still be several lakhs 

 left. 

 Dont get me wrong. I want 

 the money. But for me all numbers that end up in more than 

 six or seven zeroes look the same and that is why I prefer 

 them to be written in words rather than figures. 

 So I have a gameplan ready for 

 spending the money. I will spend them on big things. 

 First I will change my profile. 

 To improve it, I will drop my husband of many years and 

 get a boyfriend. It will cost a lot.

 I will buy a wardrobe. It will 

 be an enormous wardrobe, hollow and deep, made of sturdy 

 teakwood, with chambers, walls and corridors. When the world 

 will get too much, I will be able to walk into it, wander 

 inside and stay there. 

 I will pack into its cavernous 

 depths all the loose ends of my life. I dont want 

 so many of the clothes that fill up the racks of my current 

 wardrobe. I am not interested in them; but neither can I 

 throw them away. Is that the definition of loose ends? Anyway, 

 I will throw them in and forget them. 

 I will throw in all the cassette, 

 CD and DVD covers without anything inside that I have accumulated 

 over the years.

 I will pack in my EMIs into the 

 wardrobe. Before that, I will make a grand visit to the 

 bank, wearing a kanjivaram, and sign off the cheque 

 with such a flourish that the woman behind the counter who 

 infuriates me with her unfailing composure and smugness 

 will be forced to drop her jaw. 

 I will buy the biggest thing on 

 wheels that I can a bus. I will fit it with Bose speakers. 

 I will build a bus stand, where the bus will wait, always 

 ready to leave. Thats the best thing about travel 

 to know that you can take off any moment you want to. 

 I will also buy an auto-rickshaw. 

 Because an auto can get into places no other vehicle in 

 the world can. 

 I will go shopping. I will buy 

 something I have always wanted. I am ready to spend several 

 lakhs on it. 

 It will be the wig of my dreams. 

 It will be made of the best south-east Asian hair, long, 

 black and straight. But when I will wear it, and toss my 

 head, I will cast a dream. I will be Rekha. 

 Then, I will start on a long journey. 

 When I was very young, an uncle gifted me a doll. She was 

 a beautiful doll, a blonde in a bridal dress, holding a 

 bouquet of tiny white flowers. She had very fine features. 

 I used to look at her for hours. At night, I used to put 

 her back gently inside her cardboard box, while the other 

 dolls slept outside. She was my sister. No, more than that. 

 But then I forgot about her. Her 

 nose got rubbed in, her neck started to wobble and her white 

 chiffon dress had gone grey. The lace came off. When I looked 

 at her next after many years, she looked scary. I tried 

 to fix her up. But it was not possible. 

 I will take her up again. I will 

 travel the world with her. I will get her neck and nose 

 done. I will get her the dress she once wore. I will spend 

 all I have on the happy ending.

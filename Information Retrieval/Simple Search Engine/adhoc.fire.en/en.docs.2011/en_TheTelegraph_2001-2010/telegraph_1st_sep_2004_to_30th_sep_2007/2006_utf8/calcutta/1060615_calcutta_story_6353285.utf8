 Charges in doctor murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jayanta Ghosh

Around 85 days into the probe, the CID on Wednesday filed a chargesheet against seven people in connection with the murder of Salt Lake-based doctor Jayanta Ghosh.

 The chargesheet was submitted in the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court in Kandi, Murshidabad, where a critically-wounded Ghosh was found on March 7 morning. He died moments later. The 62-year-old doctor had gone missing from his chamber in Tallah the day before.

 On March 16, the city police, while probing a robbery case, chanced upon Bablu Pal, Swapan Kahar and Raju Mishra, who unwittingly revealed that they were involved in the doctor?s murder.

 Two other accused ? Jagannath Nashkar and Somnath Mistry ? were arrested the next day. 

 Bikas Mondal and wife Bidyapati were arrested in Murshidabad for conspiring with the gang of five.

 The plot to kidnap Ghosh was hatched in January. ?Bablu, who knew Ghosh, convinced his accomplices that abducting the successful doctor would fetch them loads of money,? said an officer. Once the gang agreed, Bablu sold off his land in New Barrackpore for Rs 18,000 and bought a pistol for Rs 2,600.

 ?On March 6, the accused had assembled at Chiria More around 6 am and got into a hired Maruti van being driven by Raju. They spent the next six hours making the preparations,? said the officer.

 After picking up the doctor from his chamber, the youths headed for Murshidabad.They stopped for a while in Kalyani, from where Bablu called Ghosh?s residence. He, however, did not mention the ransom amount, as there were too many people around.

 They reached Sundarpur village, in Murshidabad, after 8 pm. But the hideout they had arranged was not available. They realised that letting off Ghosh would be too risky.

 Jagannath tried to shoot the doctor with Bablu?s pistol, but it did not fire. He then slit Ghosh?s throat with a knife.

 The next morning, Bablu called Ghosh?s wife and demanded a ransom of Rs 2 lakh.

 Senior cop in disc brawl

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 A senior IPS officer of Calcutta Police got involved in a midnight brawl with three youths and the guards of a discotheque in the Park Street area around two weeks ago. 

 The half-hour scuffle left the officer, deputy commissioner (wireless) G. Srinivas, with bruises on one hand. 

 Most senior officers, taken off guard by news of the brawl, passed it off as a minor incident, not ?worth writing about?. No one was arrested. The three youths were taken to the police station, made to sit for two hours and finally let off with a warning around 5 am.

 ?Had they been arrested, a case would have to be registered. That might have caused problems,? said an officer.

 Srinivas, who went on sick leave a day after the incident, admitted that ?there was a problem, but it was a minor one?. He refused to divulge the details as he was on leave. When called the second time, he switched off his mobile phone.

 According to a senior officer of Park Street police station, Srinivas visited the discotheque around midnight on April 2. Clad in jeans and shirt, he was alone.

 Trouble broke out when the three youths started teasing him. An infuriated Srinivas asked them to leave, but they refused. An altercation ensued, which soon turned into a scuffle. The guards rushed in and tried to calm the warring groups, but in vain. 

 The guards dragged Srinivas and the youths out of the discotheque. Angry with the behaviour meted out to him, Srinivas started shouting, drawing a crowd within seconds.

 The officer then revealed his identity, but no one would believe him. So, he called the officer-in-charge of Park Street police station and a team rushed to the spot. Two traffic sergeants of the wireless section also arrived and took him to a nursing home.

 Realising that the man they were dealing with was a senior police officer, the discotheque management and guards apologised to the policemen. The three youths, all in their 20s, were taken to the thana for interrogation.

 Mohammed Akram, local police station officer-in-charge, said: ?There was an altercation between the deputy commissioner and a group of youths and the guards of the discotheque. Our team rushed over and sorted out the problem. It was a minor incident and that?s why we did not record it.? 

 Deputy commissioner (south) Ramesh Babu said: ?A scuffle broke out between Srinivas and the security guards over parking of vehicles. It?s not worth writing about.?

 Every move she makes

 June 5, Mumbai: Rani Mukherjee is the first star to arrive for the Sabsey Favourite Kaun Awards at the Hyatt. In the star world, turning up first is the last thing to do. So, the queen blasts the organisers for not telling her of the arrival time of the Shah Rukhs and Abhisheks. When requested for a Q- amp;-A, she brushes it off with a broad smile: ?I can?t give an interview.?

 December 20, Calcutta: Rani Mukherjee arrives at the ITC Sonar Bangla in the afternoon to receive the Anandalok Award later in the day. Rushing across to her suite, she plays deaf to a request for an interview; and to the shutterbugs she says: ?Aar koto ek mukh tulbe? Amay jete dao.?

 If Rani Mukherjee wasn?t Rani Mukherjee, we would surely have let her go. Being Bollywood?s Heroine Number One and refusing to meet or talk, all one can do is keep a dignified distance and just watch every move she makes.

 And that?s precisely what we were doing at the STAR Screen Awards last Wednesday at the NSE Grounds in Mumbai.

 Rani has had an absolute magic run in 2005. If she walked like Charlie Chaplin to tears and triumphs in Black, she scurried through Bunty Aur Babli setting style trends along the way and finally peered from under her veil in Paheli, only to be ?spirited? away. Even in a dud like Mangal Pandey ? The Rising, her sex appeal drew more attention than his moustache.

 So, the hordes of Best Actress awards to be handed out one after the other are all headed one way. Not just that. If in one year you have chartbusters like Main vari vari, Kangna re and Nach baliye, you are sure to perform at every other filmi event.

 But if one was to give Rani a special achievement award, it would be for being an industry outsider and not being part of the hot bod brigade, and yet being the most sought-after leading lady. Thanks as much to her acting ability as to her communication craft.

 The proof of her PR skills was in the full glare of the first-row spotlight at the Goregaon venue of the STAR night. Following the please-all path to perfection, she bridged every banner and cavorted with every camp.

 First up was her on-stage performance that included a medley of songs from Paheli, Mangal Pandey and Bunty Aur Babli ? one a Shah Rukh Khan film, the other an Aamir Khan-starrer and the third a Yash Raj production opposite the Bachchan!

 Off stage, the action was even more hectic. There was a smiling Yash Uncle and family to greet; there was her Bunty with Jaya Aunty to meet; above all, there was Sanjay Leela Bhansali to sit with!

 So, when in response to 40 lakh SMSs and phone calls voting Abhishek and Rani as the Jodi No. 1 ? ahead of even Rani and SRK ? Bunty and Babli went up on stage together but parted ways as soon as they were off it. Because Rani had to be rooted beside Bhansali. ?Thanks Sanjay for giving me Black. You are the light of my life,? she gushed.

 If the Yash Uncles and Jaya Auntys got her hugs and hellos, the man ?who gave her Michelle? got her!

 To see Rani in action, catch the STAR Screen Awards, Sunday, 7 pm, on STAR Plus.

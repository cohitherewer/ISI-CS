 Good, that means one less planet to memorise, smiled Vinayak Mehta at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) on Friday. The 10-year-old seemed to put things into perspective, as Calcutta joined the queue of the star-struck the day after Pluto was struck off the list of planets.

 With Pluto being demoted from ninth planet to dwarf planet, the curiosity levels in both Calcutta and the Capital have been quite astronomical. With the solar system now made up of eight classical planets, the science textbooks will have to be rewritten. The cry for exclusion of Pluto from the planetary roster is not new. But this time, there has been a new-found interest and curiosity among students and others to know the truth about the solar system, said Debiprasad Duari, director, research and academics, MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research that runs the Planetarium. 

 One common question was how the expulsion of Pluto, discovered in 1930, would impact astrological charts. It would not, was the common consensus among practitioners near and far. Pluto was never considered important for astrological counting. So, its demotion will hardly affect Indian astrology, pointed out local astrologer Pankaj Ganguly.

 Raveendran Nair, an astrologer in New Delhi, termed traditional Vedic astrology way ahead of its times, as it had never counted Pluto. The nine relevant celestial bodies are the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and two imaginary shadow planets called Rahu and Ketu. Those who wrote the laws of Vedic astrology, in their ancient wisdom, had foreseen new discoveries, added Prem Sharma, an astrologer in Chandigarh.

 The Pluto poser united east and west, with Russell Grant, a British astrologer and best-selling author, stressing that he would not change the astrological charts he uses for his clients and millions of visitors to his website because of the latest astronomical development.

 But the interest in the Pluto affair has not been merely astrological. And this is in keeping with a recent trend. Over the past few years, interest in astronomy and astrophysics has increased and a thing like this only heightens awareness and curiosity, signed off Duari.

 Focusing on a period in Calcuttas history that prevailed long before the emergence of modern urban culture, Ramnidhi evokes surprising parallels between circumstances of the past and present. It draws attention to the course of cultural change and the insecurities and clash of beliefs that attend every transitional phase of society. Set in early 19th century Calcutta, the play narrates the tragic story of Kripa Sunri, leader of a group of kabi-gaan performers. After the advent of the famous and popular tappa musical style by Nidhubabu, the citys so-called sophisticated patrons of music reject kabi-gaan as a common, lowly form of entertainment. Losing his former clientele one by one, Kripa Sunri makes a desperate attempt to learn the new musical form. However, he soon realises that his efforts will be in vain, as neo middle-class patrons would always be contemptuous of traditional performers and shun their style of entertainment. Direction: Runu Chowdhury. Presented by EZCC.

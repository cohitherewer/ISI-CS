 Document of life turned inside out

 - Photos 

 of Germany now 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Two of the exhibits 

 from the show of photographs in contemporary Germany 

 The current exhibition entitled Agree to Differ, Positions of contemporary photography from Bremen, Germany, organised by Max Mueller Bhavan at Akar Prakar gallery shows that the concerns of practitioners in the West have shifted to areas hitherto unexplored. Documentation is still on their minds but the focus has changed radically.

 Now documentation embraces issues which perhaps no photographer would have touched earlier, and some of it can be quite disconcerting. They certainly do not intend to create beautiful images in the conventional sense. Flashlights have been used liberally in an effort to capture ineffable and indefinable expressions that only a photograph can freeze.

 Take for instance the picture of a slice of young mans stomach his underpants exposed with a snaking tube that resembles a catheter cellotaped to his skin. Next to his hairy, white skin is a bouquet of possibly artificial flowers. It does not depict anything in particular but you immediately know everything is not right with this. This is not an aesthetic response but goes beyond that and even voyeurism.

 One reacts the same way when one realises that the nails of the young white bearded man holding a glass of orange juice and wearing a plastic antenna on his head are varnished the deepest of crimsons. What kind of a party is it? It has the casualness of a snapshot but is not. 

 Take the image of the young woman walking down a staircase. Her eyeballs that have dilated in reaction to the strong flashlight fix the viewer with their relentless gaze. In yet another photograph, the elaborately coiffed head actually belongs to a man. Such jarring images define life in contemporary Germany, where, in spite of the affluence, or perhaps because of it, life has been turned inside out. 

 This is a rather large exhibition with several participants and several images of urban life. The photographs on view are unframed and the prints are rather small but are of a very high quality. The images of three white boys in singlets posing against a white background are like some of those white-against-white abstract paintings.

 Most striking of all is the series of images of a full-blooded cockerel, the cockscomb standing erect or turning limp as the speck of light in its eye turns into a speck or a flashing orb.

 The only black-and-white photographs are those of a baby girl with an adult, perhaps her parent, as she is being fed, bathed and swung upside down. The child looks at the camera with nonchalant innocence that only a child is capable of projecting.

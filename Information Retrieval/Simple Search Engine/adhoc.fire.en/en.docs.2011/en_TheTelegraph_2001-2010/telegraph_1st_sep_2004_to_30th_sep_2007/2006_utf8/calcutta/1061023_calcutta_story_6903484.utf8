 Clinic in trouble over pill label

 KINSUK BASU

 The next time you pop a pill, be sure of the label.

 Police have registered a case against Homoeopathic Clinic, on Shakespeare Sarani, for providing medicines without a composition label, a must under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

 The cops are acting on a complaint filed by Guwahati-based trader Pankaj Agarwal with Bowbazar police station in August.

 Agarwal had alleged that a medicine provided by one of the doctors of the clinic did not bear a label saying it contained codeine phosphate, which he was allergic to. The allegation was backed by a report from a private laboratory on Bentinck Street that had tested the medicine.

 A case of misbranding under sections 17B and 27D of the Drug and Cosmetics Act has been slapped on the clinic.

 Police also got in touch with the directorate of drug control, which clarified that any medicine company using codeine must have the excise departments clearance. On visiting the clinic, which prepared the drug that was handed over to Agarwal, the cops learnt that it did not have the clearance.

 The police team collected samples of eight different medicines and sent them to the state drug laboratory in Convent Lane for tests. The lab did not find codeine in the samples, but stated that the medicines had no labels either, in violation of the Drug and Cosmetics Act, an officer added.

 A case has been initiated against the clinic based on certain findings, said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 Agarwal, who had registered with the clinic a few months earlier, came to the city on July 23 on business. He had checked into a hotel on Chittaranjan Avenue.

 As he was not feeling well the next day, he called the manager of the Shakespeare Sarani clinic and narrated his problems. The manager a homoeopath prescribed a medicine and sent it to him wrapped in blister packs.

 But Agarwals condition worsened after taking the medicine he could hardly stand. The hotel manager then sent him to an allopathic doctor, who asked Agarwal to get the homoeopathic drug tested.

 Agarwal took the medicine to the Bentinck Street lab. The test report claimed that the drug contained codeine phosphate, said a senior officer of Bowbazar police station.

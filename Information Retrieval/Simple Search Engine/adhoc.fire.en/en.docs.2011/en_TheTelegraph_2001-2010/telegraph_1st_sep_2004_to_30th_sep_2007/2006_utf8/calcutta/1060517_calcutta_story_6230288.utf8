 Pampering themselves to exotic beauty treatments at VLCC everyday and then sweating it out at Solace, the Tilottama finalists have been a very busy lot of late.

 With back-to-back schedules through the day and action replay the next morning, the need of the hour was a break from the monotonous routine ? and a days retreat to Vedic Village provided all that and more. 

 But when the crowning moment of Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006 is only 10 nights away, can anyone really have the luxury of all fun and no work? Well, not if you go by Mondays line up of sub-contests and the panel of judges that the contestants had to face.

 Vying for coveted titles like Miss Confident, Miss Beautiful Hair, Miss Beautiful Skin, Miss Beautiful Smile, Miss Beautiful Eyes, Miss Personality, Miss Bejewelled, Miss Perfect 10 and Swimsuit Round, the 20 girls tried their best to make a mark with danseuse Priti Patel, Bhoomi singer Soumitra Ray and former Tilottama Jyoti Brahmin, their three judges for the day.

 The participants descended on Vedic Village nice and early and after a healthy breakfast comprising seasonal fruits, south Indian delicacies and an assortment of multi-grain breads, proceeded for hair and make-up sessions.

 The sub-contests were held at Om I, a banquet hall demarcated for them. The first round, Miss Confident, saw the judges putting the contestants into tricky situations and then gauging their reactions.

 From gift of the gab to critical choices, the Miss Confident round saw it all. Adding to the audio appeal were the song snatches ? from Prachis rendition of Tu hi meri from Gangster to Arpitas version of Kajra re.

 The second set of sub-contests that decided Miss Beautiful Hair, Miss Beautiful Skin, Miss Beautiful Smile, Miss Beautiful Eyes and Miss Personality required the finalists to walk down the ramp before introducing themselves. 

 Twenty distinct personalities behind 20 pretty faces ? so what exactly were the judges looking for? 

 For me, it is all about feeling each personality, trying to gauge them and their strengths. Also, these girls are trying to keep just so many things in mind, their nervousness is understandable. It is important to set that aside, revealed Priti.

 Soumitra, on the other hand, was looking for spontaneity and confidence in the answers. For the sake of being fair, it is also essential that we ask all the girls the same standard of questions, he added.

 Been there, done that and now on the other side of the table, life has already completed one circle for Jyoti. When youre on stage, you feel the judges are so lucky? Now I know that this is equally stressful, laughed Jyoti.

 Six hectic sub-contests later, it was time for a lunch break. Set up in the Vedic Village restaurant Yagna, the buffet spread was in fact a true tribute to the world of glamour. Not only was the menu thoughtfully planned, each dish was even named after beauty queens.

 So while Aishwaryas Secret was a tangy raw papaya and mango salad in a Thai dressing, Sushmitas Fad was actually a sprouted salad in a honey and ginger dressing.

 The main course saw a wide spread, all the way from organic brown rice to multi-cereal roti to garden-fresh organic vegetable stew to bekti in low-calorie marinade.

 For once, the girls were allowed to give in to the temptation of the dessert section ? exotic fruits with low-fat cream and coconut souffle.

 The post-lunch session had one of the most-awaited rounds of the contest ? the swimsuit round that would also pick the Miss Perfect 10. Against the backdrop of palm trees, beach recliners and a cool blue pool, the swimsuit round began. Figure, carriage and poise forming the basic parameters of this round, the finalists catwalked in a rainbow of colours and made quite a splash.

 Miss Bejewelled was decided on the basis of photographs that saw all the girls adorned in MP Jewellers creations.

 The Miss Talented title had been judged earlier this month by actor Rudranil and actress Sonali Chowdhury. While a majority of the contestants exercised their vocal chords and showcased their dancing abilities, some even took a shot at acting skills and one contestant floored the judges with a poem on the contest.

 The other sub-contests are Miss Congeniality ? to be chosen by the girls themselves ? and Miss Good Health ? chosen by Wockhardt based on medical reports. The results of all the sub-contests will be declared on the big night ? May 27 at the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

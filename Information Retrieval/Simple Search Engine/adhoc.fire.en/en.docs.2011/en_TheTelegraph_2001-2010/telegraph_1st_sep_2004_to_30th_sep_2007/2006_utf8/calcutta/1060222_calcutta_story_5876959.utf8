 The state government wants to adopt a two-pronged approach to shore up the sagging image of the state?s healthcare delivery system, by cleaning up its act and facilitating private enterprise.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stressed on this twin-therapy mode while laying the foundation stone for the first phase of Eastern India Healthcare Foundation?s (EIHF) 500-bed hospital in Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass, on Monday evening.

 ?We are taking stock of the deficiencies in the government hospitals and trying to provide them with the best of equipment and facilities possible. We are also looking at the commitment levels of doctors at the state hospitals and negligence to duties would be dealt with firmly,? Bhattacharjee said.

 In the same breath, the chief minister underlined the importance of quality private hospitals, promising all help to new projects. ?We need two more medical colleges in Bengal, besides one dental college, and private companies are most welcome to come forward,? he iterated.

 EIHF chairman Alok Roy promised to set up an institute of physiotherapy and a centre for early detection of disability and its treatment on the adjacent three-acre plot given by minister of state for Sunderbans development Kanti Ganguly.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra agreed there was a defined need for DNB (Diplomate of National Board) courses, besides training for nursing and paramedical staff, and hoped the new not-for-profit hospital would look into this grey area.

 The trust will also set up a full-fledged rehab centre, plus a day-care centre and OPD wing in a separate block, with a built-up area of 65,000 sq ft. In addition, a Rs 36-crore cancer hospital will come up over 54,000 sq ft, complete with 20 day-care beds.

 ?Our aim is to reach quality healthcare to the masses. We will conduct outreach programmes and focus on early detection of diseases, as well as raising awareness on preventive medicine,? promised Roy, instrumental in setting up city hospitals like Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and BM Birla Heart Research Centre.

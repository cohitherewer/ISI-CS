The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On board the Kabul Express

 Between bumping into Penelope Cruz and getting more cheers than Brad Pitt, JOHN ABRAHAM spoke to Pratim D. Gupta from the Toronto Film Festival

 Second year in a row; you are becoming a fixture at the 

 Toronto Festival

 Yeah, it has become a yearly agenda. Last time it was Water. This time its Kabul Express. Next year, even if I dont have a film of mine, I may just come to visit the festival here!

 But Kabul Express is such a different film from Water

 In terms of premise, the films are completely different, but Kabul Express was as adventurous as Water.

 Wasnt it tough shooting in Kabul?

 Yes. Today we are all sitting here comfortably in a hotel room in Toronto and waiting for the world premiere. But what we went through during the shooting was something else altogether. You have to see the film to understand that.

 Its such a departure from a Dhoom or a Jism

 Kabul Express is a very nice, simple story. It is unique because it is based on Kabirs own true experiences. And he has been very honest to the film. It is not your typical love story. If anybody likes the film, it will be for its different premise. There are such diverse emotions, so many undercurrents between the characters.

 You have got a huge fan following in Toronto

 Its amazing and they are such a different audience as opposed to the people back home. I think Water did it for me. Its a good thing it happened.

 So, John Abraham is the new Brad Pitt?

 (Laughs) Maybe another year or so! But such exposure for Indian cinema in international festivals will only help our films. We have got very positive response from the media and people here. The North American audience is showing more than an active interest in our films. So we are starting to go global to a small extent. Once the larger North American population loves our films, we will be right there.

 Which stars have you bumped into on the red carpet?

 Kabir and I met Louis Gosse Jr., who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. Then I also bumped into Penelope Cruz. Volver, the film she has come for, has the same publicist as ours.

 And what did she say to you?

 Hi, bye!

 You have got yourself an international agent. Are you looking 

 for a career in the West?

 Nothing like that. My base is in India and I am very happy doing movies there. I am not someone to beat my chest and say that I am in much demand in Hollywood. Because I am not, and I do not have a Hollywood film. I am just looking for interesting work and that can come from any country and any maker. I would like to be known as someone who does his mainstream films and some off-beat projects.

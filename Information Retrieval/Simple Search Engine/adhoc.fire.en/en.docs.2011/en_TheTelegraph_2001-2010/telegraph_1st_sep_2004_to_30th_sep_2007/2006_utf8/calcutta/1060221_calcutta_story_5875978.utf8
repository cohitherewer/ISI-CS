 When Bill Ashcroft from the University of New South Wales walked into the Calcutta-Monash conference office requesting a participation certificate, there was no doubt that it was, indeed, one of the most important academic conferences held in the city in recent times.

 A three-day conference, entitled ?Globalisation and Post-colonial Writing: An Australia-India Exchange, was held at the Centre for Social Sciences and Humanities?, on CU?s Alipore campus. The event was a joint endeavour of the Centre for Post-colonial Writing, Monash University, Melbourne, and the department of English, CU.

 There were no less than 40 scholars, authors and artists from the largest university in Australia, including David Hanan, Peter Goldsworthy, Kim Scott, Tess de Quincey and Peter Snow. Indian participants included big names like Ashish Nandy, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Dharmasena Pathiraja and Githa Hariharan.

 The event was kickstarted with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by Prof Asish Banerjee, vice-chancellor of CU, and Prof Richard Larkins, vice-chancellor of Monash University, pledging the future sharing of teachers, resources and exchange programmes.

 In his inaugural address, Prof Banerjee referred to the seminar as a curtain-raiser to the series of major international seminars scheduled as part of the 150-year celebrations of CU. Prof Larkins felt that though the two universities had different histories, they shared similar perspectives.

 The seminar was an integration of both the creative and the scholarly, featuring 47 papers and plenary discussions as well as six presentations by writers and artists. 

 The keynote address on ?The Ocean that Unites Us, the Froth that Divides Us: Thoughts in Biology and Culture?, delivered by novelist Peter Goldsworthy, explored the involvement of various literary forms in different cultures with reference to the Mahabharata, Bible and aboriginal concepts, to 600 BC northern India and 500 BC Athens, Socrates and Buddha, R.K. Narayan and Les Murray.

 Bill Ashcroft chaired a session on ?Indian Responses to the Empire? and presented a lecture on ?The Post-Colonial Transformation of Globalisation Discourse?. 

 Andrew Ng spoke on ?The Post-colonial/Post-modern Gothic: Salman Rushdie?s Fury?, and Paul Sharrad talked about ?Convicts, Call Centres and Cochin Kangaroos: South Asian Globalising of the Australian Imagination?.

 For those with specialised areas of interest, there were sessions on photography, dance, children?s literature and refugee narratives. A workshop on opportunities for postgraduate research in Australian universities was chaired by Prof Arun Bandopadhyay, dean, arts faculty, CU, and presented by Denise Cuthbert, associate dean, research, faculty of arts, Monash University.

 From exploring indigenous art forms in post-colonial representation to Asian-Australian cultural interface, the speakers at the conference emphasised the need to think beyond national boundaries through collaborative, inter-disciplinary and intercultural performance projects. 

 A performance and reading of a feminist representation of Shakespeare?s The Tempest proved to be a delightful diversion from the serious discussions.

 Pride parade

 Degrees and diplomas were awarded to the graduates of Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Calcutta, at its 40th convocation on February 17. Prof M.G.K.Menon, president of the institute, pointed out that ISI has done pioneering work in the field of statistics, which play a decisive role in shaping and influencing governmental policies.

 But in his address, Prof S.K.Pal admitted that ?ISI has not been able to attract excellent faculties due to low pay structures?.

 Prof L.A. Zadeh of University of California, who was conferred an honourary D.Sc degree by ISI, said: ?This degree means a lot to me because I have deep respect for India and its culture. The best students at our university are Indians.?

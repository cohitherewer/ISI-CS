 It was Fanaa that 19-year-old Rakesh Udar watched on Sunday to soothe his nerves before Monday?s robbery attempt at an Entally housing estate. 

 ?I was determined to carry out a robbery to get rid of my financial problems. But I was also tense, because it was my first operation. So, I spent Sunday afternoon watching my favourite actor,? said Rakesh during interrogation.

 According to the cops, he had spent three hours in a central Calcutta cinema watching the Aamir Khan-Kajol blockbuster. Rakesh claimed to be a dropout of an English-medium school in Delhi. He arrived in Calcutta via Patna.

 ?Rakesh said he had no idea where he would carry out his first robbery. He had never been to the city and did not know anything about the people residing in the apartment block on Munshibazar Road, in Entally. He drew confidence from the firearm tucked in his jeans waistband,? said an officer of the Calcutta Police detective department.

 Deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Partha Sarathi Ghosh said Rakesh had fled his Delhi residence a couple of weeks ago after stealing money. ?He went straight to Patna station, where he spent 10 days. He told us that he used to spend nights on the platforms.?

 In Patna, Rakesh developed contacts with local goons. ?He purchased a single-shot firearm and 20 rounds of ammunition from criminals in Patna by paying them Rs 6,000,? said an officer of Entally police station. ?From Patna, he took a train to Howrah station.?

 In Calcutta, Rakesh spent the first three days roaming aimlessly. ?He purchased a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Almost all his money was spent on conveyance and food. He would spend the nights at Sealdah station,? added the officer.

 Rakesh told interrogators that he set out from Sealdah station on Monday morning with the intention of committing a robbery. ?I had very little money. I had roti and dal at a roadside eatery, and started walking. I crossed a bridge and reached a wide road. I don?t know its name. After walking for half-an-hour, I saw a highrise with an unmanned gate. I thought it would be safe for me to enter, as there was no guard to question me.?

 Deputy commissioner Ghosh said that the city police would get in touch with Delhi police to verify Rakesh?s version. ?Whatever information we have gathered is based on Rakesh?s statements. He told us he was from Palam Colony.?

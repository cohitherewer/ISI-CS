 Casa de la India, or the House of India, an initiative of the government of India along with the Indian embassy in Spain, Valladolid University and the Town Hall of Valladolid, was unveiled this October with a retrospective of Satyajit Ray.

 Headquartered in Valladolid, 108 

 miles from Madrid, Casa de la India was formed in 2003 to 

 strengthen ties between the two countries. It was formally 

 inaugurated by film-maker Sandip Ray on October 21 with 

 the India Festival which included the screening of Ray films. 

 The package, sent by the Calcutta-based Satyajit Ray Society, 

 included Jalsaghar, Paraspathar, Abhijan, 

 Sadgati, Agantuk, Nayak and the documentary 

 on Rabindranath Tagore.

 The retrospective was accompanied by an exhibition of Ray memorabilia, consisting of film costumes, sketches, jottings and artwork during the film-makers advertising stint at D.J. Keymer.

 A bunch of around 52 photographs 

 of Ray, taken by Hirak Sen in black-and-white and colour, 

 were also on display.

 Daler Mehendi, high on the title track of Rang De Basanti, will now be seen as the judge on SABs first big-ticket reality show, Fame X. The second season of the super successful Fame Gurukul, Fame X will start on November 24 and will be aired on SAB every week from Monday to Friday. 

 Like last year, Fame X will capture the journey of 14 talented singers vying for a place in a coveted music academy Fame Academy. Adapted from the successful Spanish reality show Operacion Triunfo, Fame X will look for two new winners to take over from Qazi and Ruprekha.

 Speaking about his new role, Daler Mehndi said: I agreed to be a part of Fame X as I liked the concept of this show. It will be a journey of the 14 contestants and their constant endeavour to excel and become the singing sensation of the nation. I play a key role in their growth as I am their mentor, their critic and above all a guiding force. 

 Vikas Bahl, senior vice-president and business head of SAB, said: We are glad to have the nations biggest singing sensation, who has already made a mark with the Indian youth, as a part of Fame X.

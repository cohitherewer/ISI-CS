 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has given a clean chit to hawkers, going back on his earlier announcement that they would have to clear all pavements by July 31.

 The mayor feels the hawkers do not encroach on pavements at all. It is the shopkeepers in Burrabazar and on MG Road and AJC Bose Road who do and they will have to clear out within 48 hours, Bhattacharyya announced.

 The deadline ends on Friday, after which the civic conservancy department, with help from police, will confiscate items found lying on the pavements.

 ?The shop-owners are using the pavements of certain key roads to showcase their wares. It is because of them that pedestrians cannot use the sidewalks. This practice must stop,? the mayor said.

 As for hawkers, his stand is: ?They have become sensible and do not cause inconvenience to pedestrians. I don?t see any reason to drive them out of the pavements.?

 The thoroughfares that come within the ambit of Tuesday?s announcement are Brabourne Road, Canning Street, NS Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, MG Road, AJC Bose Road, Strand Road and Ezra Street.

 At a meeting between the mayor and representatives of 51 hawker trade unions last month, it was decided that the hawkers on their own would remove all encroachments from the pavements and replace the polythene sheets with umbrellas by July 31.

 It was also decided that they would occupy only one-third of the pavements, take away all their belongings after business hours and not sit in front of hospitals and within 50 ft of road crossings.

 The mayor had assured the hawkers that the authorities would consider issuing them identity cards if they removed all encroachments by July 31.

 The mayor said he visited SSKM Hospital last week and found no hawkers in front. 

 Shaktiman Ghosh, a leader of the Hawker Sangram Committee, said a group of hawkers, led by Citu?s Md Nizamuddin, met the mayor last week and told him that it would not be possible to replace the polythene sheets till the Pujas.

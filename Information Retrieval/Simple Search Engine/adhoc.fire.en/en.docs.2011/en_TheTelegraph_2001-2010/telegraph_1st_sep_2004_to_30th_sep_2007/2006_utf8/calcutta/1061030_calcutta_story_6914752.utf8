 Calcutta couples cosy up to Kamasutra

 - Mumbai, Delhi lag behind when it comes to experimenting with erotica

 From the pages of Kamasutra

 New Delhi is conservative and Mumbai is hard-pressed for time. Calcutta is the naughtiest. 

 When it comes to shopping for erotica and sex toys, Calcutta is right on top. Bookstores like Crossword, Landmark and Oxford Bookstore have dedicated racks for erotica to cater to the steady demand for such books. 

 A case study: Vatsyayanas Kamasutra, the classic on the art of love-making. In Calcutta, the various versions of Kamasutra sell faster than in any other city. Dedicated racks for erotica in the leading bookstores speak volumes about the popularity of the books, says Renuka Chatterjee of Roli Books, publisher of Kamasutra titles like Kama Sutra and Kama Sutra for Women. 

 Says Gautam Jatia of Landmark: On an average, we sell more than 60 to 70 copies of erotic books a month. They deal with various subjects like the art of love-making, feminine sexuality and erotic massages. 

 The search for adventure is not limited to bookstores. Calcutta couples are experimenting with sex toys, too. 

 There are toys for every stage of marriage, the storeowners say, depending upon the years one has been married, and all are flying off the shelves. For the newly-weds, there are edible lingerie and whips; for couples who have been together for more than five years, there are love games and massage oils. For those who have been together for more than 10 years, there is hardcore stuff. 

 New Delhi is quite conservative when it comes to picking up erotica and toys. Women are not sure what their husbands would like. In Calcutta, the couples come together to shop for such toys and accessories. We have made a private corner for them, where they can shop in privacy, says Dharmendra Nathvani, owner of La Lingerie in Forum, from where accessories like handcuffs, edible whips and aphrodisiacs are selling fast. Erotic books and toys are also being gifted at marriages. Many pick up erotic books as a wedding gift for friends. They are quite expensive and also have utility, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. 

 A lot of newly-weds drop into shop for the sex toys before they leave for honeymoon, adds Nathvani. They might be going for a period of two to three weeks. These accessories provide that extra spice, says Nathvani.

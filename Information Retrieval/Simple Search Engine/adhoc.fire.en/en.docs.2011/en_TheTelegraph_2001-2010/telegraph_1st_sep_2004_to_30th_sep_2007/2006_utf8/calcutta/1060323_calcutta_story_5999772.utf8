 LIFESTYLE 

 ZONE

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 What started as a hobby two years 

 ago, is now a successful venture, catering to the style 

 needs of many fashionistas of the city.

 Tucked away in a quiet lane at 

 12/S, New Alipore, Block A, near Udayan Club, this one-and-half-year-old 

 design venture is M amp;S Designer Studio, set up by mother 

 and daughter duo Saroj and Megha Dalmia.

 Spread over a sprawling area of 

 1,500 sq ft, the studio is home to an assortment of western, 

 Indo-western and traditional garbs.

 With the variety on offer, 

 we fit into the demands of all age groups. The range allows 

 you to experiment with what looks good on you, and go in 

 for what suits you best, smiles Megha.

 Ceiling and display sections done 

 up with neon lights, beautiful floor lighting at the entrance 

 and a plush black leather seater dotting a corner of the 

 western section lend a swank appeal to the interiors. The 

 green lawns outside soothe the eyes.

 ETHNIC ARRAY

 The salwar suit section 

 offers an array of casuals, semi-formals and formals with 

 lots of threadwork, dori and gota thrown in. 

 Short kameezes with beautifully embroidered collars 

 come with printed patialas and crushed dupattas.

 If short is not your type, then 

 you get long kameezes, teamed with churidars, 

 in the same designs. Long jackets teamed with brocade pants 

 catch the eye. A new addition on the racks is the Anarkali 

 style of kurtas in combinations of raw silk and georgette.

 The price tags for the salwar 

 suits read anything between Rs 1,900 and Rs 7,000.

 In the sari section, this traditional 

 drape has been played around to give a very contemporary 

 twist. A mesh of dabka, gota, sequins and 

 other forms of embroidery combine to embellish each sari. 

 The ones in imported tissue with thin frill borders are 

 definite eye-catchers. They come with brocade blouses worked 

 all over and beautifully printed petticoats. When draped, 

 the petticoats under the sheer fabrics give a lehnga-like 

 look. Those with panel work, a few inches above the border, 

 look smart.

 Then there are blouses with borders 

 that resemble baajubandhs. The saris are priced from 

 Rs 5,000 onwards. 

 There are lehngas with 

 Benarasi cholis and georgette extensions. Prices 

 start at Rs 5,000.

 WESTERN PICKS

 Straight-line raw silk skirts 

 with slits are co-ordinated with collared tops and matching 

 bags. Flowy skirts with broad patchwork on the waistline 

 look chic. There are also short skirts with asymmetrical 

 hemlines. 

 The show-stealers here are the 

 kaftans, with ornate necklines and trendy belts. Also available 

 are innovative ponchos embellished with ghungroos, 

 seashells, buttons and more.

 Prices in this section start at 

 Rs 800.

 DAZZLE DO

 The jewellery section offers earrings, 

 pendants and wristwear by local labels like Lador and by 

 designer Shailja Agarwal. Semi-precious stones set in silver 

 give them a Victorian feel.

 The store stocks bags from labels 

 like Ivy, Senorita and Narcochic, along with in-house creations. 

 Batuas, jholas, potlis, slings? the 

 variety is wide.

 There are colourful slip-ons and 

 mojris that can be co-ordinated with the garments.

 Prices of the jewellery start 

 at Rs 900.

 MENS CHOICE

 A limited mens collection 

 offers party wear shirts and kurta pyjamas 

 in linen, cotton, khadi and georgettes. Apart from in-house 

 creations, there are some by designer Dipak Mundhra. The 

 colour palette ranges from sober pastels to earthy maroons. 

 These are priced from Rs 700 upwards.

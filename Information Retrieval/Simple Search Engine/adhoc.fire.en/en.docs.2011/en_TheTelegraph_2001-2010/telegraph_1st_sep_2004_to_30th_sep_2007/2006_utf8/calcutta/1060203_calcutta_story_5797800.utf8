The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 6-week stay in bishop case

 - Bar on lower court and police in conduct of criminal suit 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday stayed for six weeks the criminal proceedings against P.S.P. Raju, bishop of Calcutta and head of the Church of North India. 

 The registrar of St Thomas Engineering College, in Kidderpore, had filed a complaint with Shakespeare Sarani police station that led to the suit. The Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrates? Court was adjudicating the case.

 After Thursday?s order, neither the metropolitan magistrate?s court nor the police will have the liberty to proceed with the case. The matter will be heard by the high court.

 The registrar had alleged that in 2000, the bishop, as chairman of the board of governors of St Thomas School, had agreed to hand over 5.27 acres of land to the college, but did not do so.

 The complainant said that on the strength of the assurance from the governing body, the engineering college had been set up and a good number of students enrolled.The refusal by the bishop to hand over the plot after four years had caused losses for the college, claimed the registrar.

 The bishop had moved an anticipatory bail petition in the high court. A division bench had granted his plea but asked him to appear before the investigators at regular intervals.

 Appearing for the bishop, Sekhar Basu and Jaymalya Bagchi on Thursday alleged that the investigating officers were harassing their client unnecessarily. They also argued that the proceedings against the bishop were based on an invalid complaint.

 According to the counsel duo, the agreement between the board of governors and the administration of the engineering college was not registered. ?So, the complainant had no authority to move a criminal suit against the bishop. His only intention was to malign the public image of the bishop,? they added.

 The matter will come up for hearing after six weeks. The petitioner has been asked by the court to serve notices on the respondents by then.

 Plays pleasant

 Nandikars latest productions spread faith, confidence and optimism in a world that is fast becoming unfriendly, insular and prejudiced. Ashapurna Devis Raater Kutum (picture below) tells the story of two petty thieves, Nasu and Gada, who enter the mansion of an old woman. Posing as friends of the caretaker, they tell her that they have been asked to look after her. Thus begins a night of misadventure for the burglars, who undergo a bizarre experience! Leela Mazumders Natun Chhele Natabar is about Natabar Chandra who is new to a school full of naughty, rowdy students. Frail in appearance and wearing odd-looking clothes, he is always made fun of by other boys. But, to their horror, he becomes the darling of the teachers. The boys try to harass him, but only end up being fooled by him. Finally, they lay a trap to have him punished by the headmaster, leading the play to its hilarious end. Direction: Goutam Halder. Also written by Leela Mazumder, Pakhi shows how a wounded bird inspires a little girl with walking disability. Direction: Swatilekha Sengupta.

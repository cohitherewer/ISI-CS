 Get set, go: A moment 

 from Nicks new show Perman

 Akshaye Khanna now is trying to be a dancing star. Apart from Humraaz and Hulchul, we havent seen the thinking actor shaking a leg. But now the Dil Chahta Hai star is actually learning salsa for an untitled film being directed by Abbas-Mustan.

 For the film, which marks the debut of Tips-find Urvashi Sharma, Akshaye has got himself a completely new look styled by his favourite designer Falguni Thakore.

 Akshaye, who likes to work in the Aamir Khan mould doing one film at a time, will be seen aplenty in 2007. Starting with Nikhil Advanis love saga Salaam-e-Ishq, where he is cast opposite Ayesha Takia, Akshaye will be seen in Anil Kapoors home production Gandhi My Father, the Abbas-Mustan film with Urvashi Sharma and another Abbas-Mustan film with Saif Ali Khan and Anil Kapoor.

 Nick, the kids channel, has just launched two new shows in India Go Diego, Go! and Perman. While Go, Diego, Go! is an international hit show from the Nickelodeon library, Perman is an acquired show. 

 Go, Diego, Go!, a half-an-hour animated show for young kids to be aired at 10 am every Sunday, revolves around Diego, an 8-year-old animal rescuer who loves nature and has the ability to talk to animals. Perman, aimed at the 4-14 year age-group, airs at 7 pm from Monday to Friday. Created by the legendary Japanese duo Fujiko Fujio, it tells the story of a gang of kids two boys, a girl and a monkey elected by a mysterious masked man to be the protectors of their city. 

 The spate of new shows 13 since the beginning of 2006 has shown tremendous results for Nick, with the ratings growing steadily from 0.13 in January to 0.34 in November. 

 Says Nina Jaipuria, vice president and general manager of Nick: Over the last one year, the channel has become the preferred destination for kids looking for masti and comedy and I am sure that both Perman as well as Go, Diego, Go! will further strengthen this association.

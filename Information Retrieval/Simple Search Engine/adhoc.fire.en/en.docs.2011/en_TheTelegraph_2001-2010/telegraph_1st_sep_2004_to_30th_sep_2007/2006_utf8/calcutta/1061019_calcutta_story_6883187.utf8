What: Abhushan 2006, Orra Sananda diamond jewellery workshop.

Where: Princeton Club. 

When: Tuesday afternoon.

The workshop: An interactive discussion on the importance of diamonds in a 

womans life kickstarted the workshop. Guest speakers designer Agnimitra 

Paul and actress Koneenica Banerjee shared tips on day and evening diamond 

jewellery. They also touched upon how television serials have influenced 

jewellery trends.

The verdict: invest in a pendant and simple earrings, 

diamonds that can take you from morning to night.

This was followed by a 16-question quiz session. A 

presentation by Orra wrapped up the event. 4Cs (cut, clarity, colour, carat) apart, 

Partho Sarothi Ghosh, showroom manager of Orra, Fort Knox, took the audience through 

various concepts like making charges, buy-back policies, comparisons between gold 

and diamond markets. He then introduced Orras Dhanteras offers and new collection 

and went on to profile the worlds most famous diamonds.

Voiceover: An interactive workshop as part of the marketing campaign 

works wonders for the brand. In fact, we are also thinking of sponsoring kitty 

parties and setting up free jewellery cleaning tables, said Ghosh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lovely ladies and their laughter lines 

 Both SOHA ALI KHAN and AYESHA TAKIA are in comedy mode, on screens big and small. Pratim D. Gupta spoke to the two stars 

 Soha Ali Khan with 

 Shekhar Suman and Navjot Singh Siddhu in this Friday?s 

 episode of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge, 

 to air on STAR One at 10 pm

 SOHA ALI KHAN

 What got you to appear on The 

 Great Indian Laughter Challenge?

 I saw the previous episodes of the show and totally loved it. I believe comedy is an integral part of entertainment. It is also one of the most difficult things to do, to make a live audience laugh. It?s a great talent to have. Also, encouraging people to laugh would make the world a lot more tolerable place to live in.

 Are you a big fan of stand-up 

 comic routines?

 Yes, I have seen a lot of stand-up comedians of the West. I have also had the chance of watching different kinds of humour in different countries in Europe.

 What do you think about the 

 Indian stand-up comedians?

 Oh! I had the most wonderful time shooting for around six hours for this episode of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge. There were four contestants and they were really good at their art. Of course, some were better than the others. The only sad thing was there were no women participants.

 Why do you think women have 

 not been so good at stand-up comedy?

 I really don?t know that. It can?t be genetic because I know a lot of women who are very funny.

 Do you think it?s not dignified 

 for women to do comic routines?

 I find some of the content that the male comedians come up with to be very undignified. In fact, 90 per cent of their jokes are about marriages and women.

 Coming to the big screen, your 

 next release is Ahista Ahista...

 Yes, and it almost feels like my launch film since this will be my first single-heroine film after all these releases. It is a romantic story opposite Abhay Deol.

 What else is on your platter?

 I will be shooting soon for an English film titled Postcard to be directed by Rajshree Ojha, a half-Bengali based in the US. He?s already shot parts of it in Calcutta with Victor Banerjee and Roopa Ganguly. My portion will be in Mumbai with an actor named Ankur Khanna. It?s a totally non-commercial film. Then, of course, I will be coming to Calcutta later in the year to shoot for Aparna Sen?s Jewellery Box (Goynar Baksho). Apart from these two, I am reading a lot of scripts and would be selecting more movies soon.

 And how does it feel to bask 

 in the glory of Rang De Basanti?

 I don?t know about the basking in the glory thing (laughs), but it feels wonderful to be part of something so important like Rang De Basanti. The response we have got for the film has been so overwhelming, from students and people who have lost their friends or family in MIG crashes. I am just proud to be associated with a film like Rang De.

 AYESHA TAKIA

 Ayesha Takia with Shaadi 

 Se Pehle 

 co-stars Akshaye Khanna and Mallika Sherawat

 Everyone wants to be a Subhash 

 Ghai heroine. How does it feel to be a part of Mukta Arts?

 It?s very nice. Mukta Arts is a lovely place to work. They are very sweet and kind with their cast and crew. These days, production houses are backing a lot of good cinema. That?s very healthy for the film industry as a whole.

 How did Shaadi Se Pehle 

 happen?

 Director Satishji (Kaushik) sent me two scripts to read as he thought I would fit into both the movies. Then when Mukta Arts came on board, they decided on producing one of the scripts. Thereafter, it was a collective decision on the part of the director and the production house to have me in the film.

 What is your role in the film?

 I play a character named Rani who is a whole lot of fun, a touch loud and always happy. She has a hypochondriac boyfriend, which is played by Akshaye Khanna. She loves him a lot but he suddenly becomes a different person and wants her to hate him. Then it?s about how Rani reacts to the situation and how it all comes together.

 Your co-star Akshaye Khanna 

 is regarded as one of the top actors in tinsel town?

 Having worked with Akshaye, I can say he is immensely talented. Also, he is a thorough professional, who would come on the sets right on time and only be bothered about his work. Since I also believe in the same, it was really great to work with someone so like-minded. Akshaye also has a great sense of comedy. I can easily say that he is one of the best co-stars I have had till now.

 Wasn?t it intimidating to have 

 a show-stealer like Mallika Sherawat?

 I have no scenes with Mallika. I just hope everyone works for the best interests of the film. As for her being in the film, I believe that Shaadi Se Pehle has a very, very interesting star cast. Apart from that, what matters to me is the role I have in the film. That?s it. 

 Do you think that heroine rivalry 

 on the sets is passe?

 I can?t say for everybody but I have had very good experiences with my female co-stars. In Dil Maange More, I had scenes with Soha Ali Khan and Tulip Joshi and it was a lot of fun on the sets. Then in Shaadi No. 1, almost all my scenes were with Soha and Esha Deol. There were no problems. Then recently in Home Delivery, I worked with Mahima Chaudhary. I think it?s a complete pleasure to work with secure, classy people.

 You have been bagging some 

 of the best projects in Bollywood?

 (Laughs) I have just signed Nagesh Kukunoor?s new film Dor alongside Shreyas Talpade and Gul Panag. Then there?s another Satish Kaushik film, this time for Ektaa Kapoor, titled Kya Love Story with Tusshar Kapoor. I have been shooting for Nikhil Advani?s Salaam-e-Ishq and Ahmed Khan?s Fool and Final. And I recently completed shooting for Naseer Uncle?s Yun Hota To Kya Hota.

 From a child star to one of 

 the top heroines today, are you happy with your stint in 

 showbiz?

 It?s very exciting to be able to do what you want to do. Also, the kind of projects that I am being offered are the ones that I would like to do. It?s a great feeling.

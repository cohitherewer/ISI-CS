 Hospice, school in jail debut

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A hospice for women convicts infected with AIDS was unveiled at Presidency jail on Sunday. The six-bedded home has been set up to provide round-the-clock treatment for inmates suffering from AIDS. 

 This is a unique healthcare scheme for the inmates, inspector-general of prisons B.D. Sharma told Metro. 

 An educational institution for the inmates children was inaugurated by a three-member Supreme Court delegation, headed by Justice K.G. Balakrishnan. 

 The delegation also introduced a stipend and scholarship scheme. The authorities claimed that more than 1,519 children in the state will benefit from the scheme.

 We want these children to join the mainstream. It is imperative, as they have to face social disgrace and suffer a stigma, said state minister for jails and social welfare Biswanath Chowdhury. 

 He added that the government has already passed a bill to convert the jails into correctional homes. We are providing vocational training to the inmates, so that they can earn their livelihood. 

 Justice Balakrishnan, while inspecting the jail, observed that the facilities are not adequate for the inmates.

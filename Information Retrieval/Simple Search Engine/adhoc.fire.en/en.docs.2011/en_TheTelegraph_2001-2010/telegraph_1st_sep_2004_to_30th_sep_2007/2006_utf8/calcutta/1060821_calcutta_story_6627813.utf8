 The countrys first aviation maintenance engineering course was inaugurated in the city last week.

 Pailan Aviation Institute, off Diamond Harbour Road, in South 24-Parganas, launched the three-year course in helicopter and jet engine maintenance.

 There is a great deal of demand for such courses. We are getting students not only from Bengal, but from various other parts of the country, said Apurba Saha, founder and chairman of the Pailan Group. 

 The course is designed keeping in mind the needs of the aviation industry, which has witnessed phenomenal growth in the past few years. Initially, 60 seats will be on offer. 

 In the first two-and-a-half years, students will be trained in theoretical and practical aspects of aircraft upkeep.

 Much of the practical training will be provided on the institutes Chetak helicopter and Cessna 185 fixed-wing aircraft. The last six months has been reserved for on-the-job training.

 Technical experts from the directorate-general of civil aviation and airlines have been drafted in as faculty members to ensure industry-relevant training for our students, added Saha.

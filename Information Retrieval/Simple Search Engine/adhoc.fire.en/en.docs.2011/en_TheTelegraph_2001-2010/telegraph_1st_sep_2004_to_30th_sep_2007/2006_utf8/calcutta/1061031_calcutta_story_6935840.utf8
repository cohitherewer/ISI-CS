The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cable theft logs out Net users

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Barely six months after its launch in Calcutta, Tata Indicom Broadband Services is struggling to cope with the theft of overhead cables. And its 8,000 customers are being logged out of the Internet as a result. 

 Tata Indicom, which has a 76 per cent stake in Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), has been besieged by complaints of connection failure from across the city. We try to restore services in whatever way possible, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to fight an organised gang of thieves, said a VSNL official. 

 According to him, the areas hardest hit are Park Circus, Park Street, Kalighat and Kankurgachhi. We have deployed our men on night patrol in the worst affected areas and have also asked police to help us out. Last week we had a session with city detective chief Gyanwant Singh and have requested his assistance in overcoming the problem, added the official.

 Connectivity problems and lack of communication on part of the broadband service have left the subscribers outraged. I opted for the inaugural offer of Rs 3,000 for a six-month connection with no cap on download. Initially, there were problems in accessing the Net, but then the situation improved. Since September 29, it has been virtually impossible to go online, observed subscriber Bismoy Ganguly. 

 Another subscriber Sabyasachi Mukherjee complained that the call centre (23558282) could not be reached during the day. I feel they are receiving a number of complaints and the lines are always engaged. One can only get through at night. Even then, the operator keeps the caller on hold, which can be expensive as the number is not toll-free. I was assured the connection would be restored, but it is down for the past 26 days.

 On being asked whether the broadband plans would be extended, a VSNL official said: We are not in a position to express our views on this. We will have to discuss the issue and see what can be done in this regard keeping in mind the consumers interests.

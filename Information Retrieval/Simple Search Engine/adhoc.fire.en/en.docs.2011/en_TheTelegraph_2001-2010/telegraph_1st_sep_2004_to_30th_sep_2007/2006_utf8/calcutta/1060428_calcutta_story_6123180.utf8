 Youths in tech prize quest

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 If you thought ATMs only dished out cash, think again. 

 Students from Jaipur have built a contraption called Any Time Medicine that dispenses life-saving drugs. It is targeted at villages and small towns where people aren?t too aware of expired or fake medicines.

 Suvankar Das Gupta, a final-year postgraduate student of computer science at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), has come up with ?a combination of software and hardware navigation system designed to help the visually impaired and the physically challenged?. The gadget uses radio frequency identification technology.

 Another group of students from Roorkee has constructed a tool that helps in the treatment of thalassaemia.

 All these young inventors have set their sights on Imagine Cup 2006, to be held in Agra in August.

 Software giant Microsoft Corporation started the cup four years ago to tap the creative and technological prowess of the youths, dissolving global boundaries and connecting classrooms in the process.

 Over 65,000 students from across the globe are expected to compete in this year?s edition of Imagine Cup for a cash prize of $25,000. The country finals will be held in Bangalore.

 The theme for Imagine Cup 2006 is: Imagine a world where technology enables us to live healthier lives. Participants are being encouraged to develop ideas and applications that address healthcare issues facing the globe.

 ?My creation is cost effective. I hope that it makes the grade. It is going to be tough, considering that out of 12,000 entries, only 12 have made the cut so far. Only one of us will represent the country at the global final,? said Das Gupta.

 The response was ?phenomenal?, stated Microsoft India director Sheila Gulati.

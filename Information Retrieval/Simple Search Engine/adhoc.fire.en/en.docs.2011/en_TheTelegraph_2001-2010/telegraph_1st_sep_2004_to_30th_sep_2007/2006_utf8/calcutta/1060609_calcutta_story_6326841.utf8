 A desire to make the world appear more beautiful prompted Dr Sankar Chatterjee to learn painting and drawing at the advanced age of 40. His paintings usually tell a story, that is as charming and innocent as the virgin countryside that he portrays. The ongoing seventh solo exhibition of his works finds the artist trying to picture locales that are as far as possible out of the reach of the public eye. The artist prefers to depict scenes of pure, verdant beauty, full of the sweet, mellow fragrance of nature?s bounty. Mostly done in transparent watercolours, his favourite medium, they create an aura of placid, almost musical serenity rather than sharply focusing on any particular theme. A lone boat waiting patiently on the banks of a river, the branch of a tree swaying gently in the breeze, a narrow village track winding lazily under the blazing sun, or a vibrant blue sky showing the pathway to heaven, all inspire him to paint and, hence, reflect nature?s glory.

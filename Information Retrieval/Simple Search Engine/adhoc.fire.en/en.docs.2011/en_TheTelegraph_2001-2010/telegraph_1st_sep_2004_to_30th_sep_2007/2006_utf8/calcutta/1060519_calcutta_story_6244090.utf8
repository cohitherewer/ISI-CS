The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buddha?s B-team

 Eto gulo daftar shamlano shambhab na... Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is struggling with several portfolios. Metro eases his burden by nominating some able Bengalis from Bollywood 

 Info/culture 

 Konkona Sen Sharma

 She has single-handedly 

 put brand Bangla in the big league of powerful screen 

 performances. Mrs Iyer has what it takes to call the 

 shots without conforming to any screen stereotype. 

 She is articulate on and off-screen, and Buddhababu 

 couldn?t find a better informed cultural ambassador 

 for the state.

 Rani Mukherjee

 No Bengali belle has bloomed 

 quite the way our queen of hearts has. Starting with 

 the shoddy Tollywood venture Biyer Phool, Rani now 

 reigns supreme, scoring hits with every Khan, Kapoor 

 and Kumar in Bollywood. With her as horticulture minister, 

 flower power would rule at the red bastion.

 (police) 

 Bipasha Basu

 Ohh... she sure knows where 

 to put up the No Entry signs. Wouldn?t we all want 

 to be on our best behaviour if Bips babe from Mandeville 

 Gardens was to be our top cop? With her around, moral 

 policing would take on a whole new meaning ? the Raaz 

 less guarded, the Jism less covered! And if things 

 get too racy for her, she can always call on John 

 ?Dhoom? Abraham.

 processing 

 Pradeep Sarkar

 He can polish off plates 

 of momos but Dada loves his machh best. When he?s 

 shooting in Calcutta, you can?t miss the pabda and 

 katla on his lunch menu. And who can forget the elaborate 

 luchi scene in Parineeta ? or the recent Anu Sarees 

 ad with Rani? 

 Science/tech 

 Pritam

 Every music director copy-pastes 

 in Bollywood but our man knows best where to source 

 ?em from. Remaking or rehashing, the Gangster melody 

 maker sure knows the pulse of the people.

 planning/dev 

 Shaan 

 Few singers have been able 

 to plan their careers like him. Starting off with 

 hit private albums, he has not only developed into 

 a top playback voice, but is also an adored TV host 

 now. And that too without a single Chand sifarish 

 from anyone.

 Rahul Bose

 He loves going up there, 

 whether it is to play Mr Iyer or just brave the winds 

 in search of 15 Park Avenue. And who better than our 

 rugby skipper to rough it out in trying conditions? 

 With his directorial skills and gift of the gab, he 

 could be Buddha?s trusted troubleshooter.

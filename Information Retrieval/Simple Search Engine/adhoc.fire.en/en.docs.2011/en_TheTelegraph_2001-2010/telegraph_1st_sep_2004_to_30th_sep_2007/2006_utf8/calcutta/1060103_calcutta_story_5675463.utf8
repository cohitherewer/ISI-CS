The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Movie Meter 

 SHIKHAR

 Builder Gaurav Gupta (Ajay Devgan) wants to uproot tribal families and the famous Guruji?s (Jawed Sheikh) ashram to set up his own lifestyle city. When Guruji refuses, Gupta lures his son Jaidev (Shahid Kapur) into the world of wine and women to force his father to give up the land.

 Coming from the maker of Sarfarosh, John M. Matthan?s second film is nothing short of a disaster. He does have a story to tell and a cause (deforestation) to fight, but the technique and style are archaic, reminiscent of the 70s and 80s. 

 The performances look laboured ? whether it is Ajay trying to be super-cool or Shahid trying to be super-innocent. Pakistani actor Sheikh is a misfit in the crucial role of Guruji; he fails to command the authority that his role demands.

 In a day and age when directors think thrice before using even chartbusters in their films to keep the pace unaffected, some very mediocre songs further slacken the screenplay.

 Bipasha is good as the supermodel whose dreams of settling down with her man are shattered. Boyfriend John Abraham shines in a 30-second guest appearance. 

 Matthan?s intentions have been honest, raising an issue which will turn out to be a global calamity in the years to come.

 First weekend watch: 85% at INOX (Forum), 63% at INOX (City Centre), 87% at 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi)

 Last word: Although injurious to health, the film?s namesake remains a better bet.

 Shop burgle at midnight 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Crime has returned to Burrabazar, and yet again, the cops do not seem to care. 

 Around Monday midnight, a group broke into an embroidery shop on Cotton Street and decamped with Rs 1 lakh in cash. The police initially refused to register a case and then claimed it was an insider job. No one has been arrested. 

 Preliminary investigation suggested the burglars entered the shop by breaking the window grille. They ransacked the shop, before breaking open the vault and taking out the money.

 ?It seems the gang was in the shop for almost an hour and rummaged through everything. The members knew that the money was kept in the vault. After taking it out, they drank inside, before fleeing with the booty,? said an investigating officer of Burrabazar police station. Four local criminals had been interrogated over the robbery, he added.

 Owner Shyam Sundar Saraf discovered that his shop had been burgled around 9.30 am on Tuesday. He immediately raised an alarm. Local traders accompanied him to the police station.

 ?Instead of registering the complaint, the officers started interrogating me after I told them that my shop had been robbed. Criminals are ruling Burrabazar and police are indifferent,? Saraf alleged.

 The robbery has once again sparked resentment among traders regarding police inability to curb crime in the trade district. Assistant secretary of Burrabazar Nagrik Front Amit Pandey remarked: ?Police are of little help and have lost the trust of the traders. It seems the businessmen have to devise a plan to keep criminals at bay.?

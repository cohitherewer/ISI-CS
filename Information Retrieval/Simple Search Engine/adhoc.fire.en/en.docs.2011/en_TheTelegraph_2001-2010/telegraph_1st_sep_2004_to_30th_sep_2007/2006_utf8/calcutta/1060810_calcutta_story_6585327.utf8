 Biswas at Chitrakoot 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A Nikhil Biswas painting 

 Nikhil Biswas, who died at age 36 way back in 1966, is one of those artists whose name is heard often but who remains something of an enigma. Because of lack of documentation, hardly any material is readily available on the artist and there are few around who used to know him personally. Even his friend and coeval, Shyamal Datta Roy, has passed away.

 Chitrakoot Art Gallerys exhibition on Biswas should at least familiarise viewers with his art. It is known that he was a tall and burly man who had passed out from the Government College of Arts and Craft, and he himself was a teacher in a well-known school. An art activist, he believed in collective action.

 In the early 1950s, Shyamal Datta Ray along with Nikhil Biswas, Harekrishna Ghosh, Debnath Mukherjee and Suhachari Dasgupta formed the Chitrangshu group and ran the studio and gallery at 1, Chowringhee Terrace. 

 He was also one of the 10 founding members of the Society of Contemporary Artists, that included Somnath Hore, Kamal Roychoudhury, Shyamal Datta Roy, Bijon Choudhury, Prokash Karmakar, Arun Bose, Sanat Kar, Sailen Mitra and Anilbaran Saha. Significantly, most of these artists had leftist sympathies.

 What was then the Democratic Republic of Germany had organised an exhibition of Biswas in that country in 1966, and posthumously the next year. German art critics were much impressed by his artistic and humanitarian concerns.

 Mostly drawings are exhibited at the current exhibition. As an art teacher, Biswas earned a pittance even by the standards of those days. So, he used the cheapest material available mostly paper used for packaging, newsprint and a viscous ink or his pen and ink to execute his drawings. So, many of his works are either severely damaged or are crumbling. 

 Biswas could afford to buy canvas and oil paint only after his works began to sell, when his life was almost at an end. He was a prolific artist and according to one estimate, he left behind about 7,000 works.

 The vivid drama of movement, the vision of hosts of male nudes with well-defined musculature as if in a free fall, or in confrontation with rearing horses, masses of heaving clouds and bodies stretched out as if on a rack were captured with frenetic strokes of thick ink. 

 This dynamism animates some of his small drawings, too. Biswas was known for his drawings of Christ and the one on display has very strong graphic qualities. There is passion but without the religiosity associated with the Son of God. But to jaded viewers of our times, these gestures of rebellion may seem a bit dated. The artist died before his vision had matured. 

 There are, besides, some arresting drawings of a shoal of pomfret, intricate machinery and Durga quite different from the traditional iconography. A beautiful drawing of owls resembles Dokra artefacts. The stained glass windows in a Gothic church stand out for their glowing colours (picture above).

 Hoax call logs out Wipro

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A bomb hoax at Wipros Salt Lake campus forced an emergency local log out at one of the leading IT and ITES companies in the country.

 On Thursday, the receptionist at Wipro received an anonymous call around 3.45 pm. The caller said a time bomb planted in the office would explode at 10 pm.

 Company officials immediately called the police and a large posse of security personnel, along with a dog squad, rushed to Wipros Sector V facility. Wipros development centre in the states IT hub has a staff strength of over 2,000 and they were all evacuated as the security agencies combed the campus.

 It looks like a hoax call. We did not find any unidentified object on the premises, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas). The security agencies continued their search through the evening. No arrests were made till late at night. 

 I was busy working on my computer and suddenly someone on our floor broke the bomb story We rushed out, said an employee, recounting Thursday afternoons commotion on campus that affected the companys 24x7 schedule. 

 In a statement issued on Thursday evening, a Wipro spokesperson said: The business continuity plans are in place and disruption of business is expected to be minimal, if any. We have an evacuation plan in place.

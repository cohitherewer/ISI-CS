 Tollygunge club

 Xmas Eve in association with Signature.

 The bash: While a long 

 queue of cars waited to enter the club gates, at the venue 

 a crowd of patient youngsters waited to get into the groove. 

 Once in, around 4,000 people were chilling out, all set 

 to welcome Santa in style.

 The decor was Christmas with a 

 capital C big star lights, colourful balloons and bonfires. 

 The open dance floor set amidst bamboo groves, done up with 

 bells, balloons and stars jazzed up the festive ambience. 

 Spaghetti dresses, halters, cocktail gowns and knee-length 

 skirts took care of the dress code. The youngsters dominated 

 the dance floor and the not-so-young joined in soon. 

 Calcutta band Plan B belted out 

 a medley of English chartbusters, punctuated by Hindi numbers. 

 It was pure Boney M nostalgia as Plan B regaled audiences 

 with By the rivers of Babylon, Daddy Cool 

 and more. As midnight neared, it was a medley of Christmas 

 carols Rudolph the red nosed reindeer, Silent 

 night, Away in a manger 

 Soon, remix raja DJ Akbar Sami 

 took over amidst claps and whistles. The DJ carried forward 

 the Yuletide mood with a faster version of Last Christmas 

 before moving on to Woh lamhe, Hips dont 

 lie and more. The party rocked till about 3.30 am on 

 Christmas.

 Sip n bite: 

 The spread included Rumali Roti, Dal Makhani, Cocktail Samosa, 

 Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Meat Balls, Paneer Balls, Vegetable 

 Chop and more.

 Voiceover: This is 

 one of the best parties the club has ever had. The crowd 

 took the performances very well and the enjoyment level 

 was optimum, smiled Arunava Chakravarty, deputy managing 

 member, Tolly.

 The bash: The Christmas 

 flavour was introduced in the form of shining Christmas 

 trees dotting each table and strings of tiny yellow lights 

 here and there. The crowd included a hearty mix of the young 

 and not-so-young. The dress code took into account the winter 

 element lots of jackets, bright sweaters, denims, loose 

 trousers and boots.

 Mumbai girl Sona Mahapatra was 

 an instant hit. She interacted with the crowd, matching 

 steps with those on the dance floor. Her repertoire of songs 

 ranged from the Geeta Dutt days to a few current Bollywood 

 numbers. Couples danced cosily to soft, romantic tracks 

 from Sonas album. Her verdict on the crowd: They 

 were such a warm set. You feel almost at home; I enjoyed 

 myself thoroughly. 

 Then it was time for DJ Akash 

 who had a feel of the audience pulse from the very start. 

 The crowd danced to the tunes of Aajkal tere mere, 

 Bolo na, Dhoom 2, Kya mujhe pyar hai 

 and more. The Royal rocked till around 1.30 am.

 Sip n bite: 

 The lavish spread offered Chilli Cheese Stuffed Mushroom, 

 Mutton Sheekh Kebab, Golden Fried Prawns, Vegetable Spring 

 Rolls and a lot more.

 Voiceover: It was 

 a packed ground and the crowd had a great time. The audience 

 loved Sona and DJ Akash, said Jaideep Gangopadhyay, 

 manager, administration, RCGC.

 The bash: One half of the 

 lawn had sufficient seating arrangements with food stalls 

 at one end. A huge air-conditioned dance hall was packed 

 with party swingers high heels and short skirts posing 

 no problem for the trendiest of moves.

 A bonfire on the lawn was not 

 as large as was expected but then there was hardly a nip 

 in the air to feel the need.

 The mercury rose as crooner Geetanjali 

 from Mumbai took the stage, dressed to kill in a glittering 

 sequinned top. She wooed the crowd on the dance floor with 

 a range of numbers from rock roll to latest 

 Hindi pop beats to good ol Abba. 

 It was fine for a while, but intoxicated 

 by her melodious voice, some people on the dance floor soon 

 forgot to dance and chose to stand around the stage and 

 gape at her, instead. But the singer from Mumbai coyly brushed 

 it off as a compliment, before heading for the 

 stage again.

 Dance group Toxic sizzled on the 

 floor with choreographed steps. It started with the beats 

 of Doncha by Pussycat Dolls and Crazy kiya re 

 fused together. Performing in 11 sequences with different 

 costumes, no dance style was left untouched salsa, hip-hop, 

 jive or Bollywood.

 DJ Sooraj from Mumbai took charge 

 of the console and the party wrapped up around 3.30 am.

 Sip n bite: 

 Red Hot Chilli Peppers served up Chinese, Gupta Brothers 

 catered to Indian vegetarian tastes, Don Giovanni went the 

 Italian way, and kebabs and tandoor from Astor were 

 in good demand.

 Voiceover: More than 

 1,000 people poured in tonight. The tradition of celebrating 

 Christmas Eve with a bang is a way of social bonding and 

 meeting old friends besides spreading the joy of the season, 

 said club president Noomi Mehta. 

 Saturday club

 What: The Telegraph 

 Xmas Eve in association with Royal Challenge.

 The bash: A complimentary 

 glass of red wine was thrown in with every entry. The club 

 building was lit up with strings of lights streaming down 

 its front and decorations galore giving the lobby a warm 

 festive feel. A grand Xmas tree on the left of the stage 

 marked the final touch. 

 A very family crowd 

 settled for a meal on tables and chairs neatly arranged 

 on the grounds, living up to the image of this being a family 

 club. Significantly, one of the prizes went to the best 

 father-daughter couple.

 The band Krosswindz started performing 

 at 8.30 pm with popular tracks like Waiting for tonight 

 and Quit playing games. City girl Priyanka swung 

 the party into action as emcee. Up next, were a couple of 

 speeches by the club committee members.

 Dancer Shubhangi from Mumbai had 

 crowd drooling over her sexy moves. Teamwork was the key 

 word as local dancers backed her up and neatly stepped in 

 to join her with tracks including Wheres the party 

 tonight, Beedi and Crazy kiya re.

 Very soon, the 1,000-plus crowd 

 got grooving to the beats of DJ Vicky jamming combination 

 music tracks, starting with retro (Give me hope and 

 Boney M) and moving on to rock (Summer of 69 

 and Faith).

 A lot of commercial music did 

 the rounds too, right up to small hours of the morning. 

 Gift hampers comprising perfumes, utility items and wine 

 bottles went out to the most trendy and energetic dancers.

 Sip n bite: 

 All that dancing is bound to make one thirsty. The club 

 Light Horse bar and the garden bar were kept open and to 

 complete the triangle, a special bar served wine from Chantilli 

 and drinks from Kingfisher and UB Group. Grub from Gupta 

 Brothers and Amber were a hit, while the clubs own 

 catering team dished out mouth-watering dishes by the dozen.

 Voiceover: By 10.30 

 pm, the place was jampacked and in full swing, smiled 

 Rajen Sood, convenor, and entertainment committee.

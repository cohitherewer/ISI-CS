 The body of a two-and-a-half-year-old-boy was found in an East West Canal Road drain, in Howrah town, on Tuesday. He was allegedly murdered by his aunt, her sister and their mother.

 Rahim Ansari, the child, had been missing since Sunday evening. On Tuesday morning, his body was spotted by a sweeper in a drain a couple of kilometres from his home at 9 Jolapara Masjid Lane.

 The boys parents, Rashid and Yasmin, alleged that Asgari Begum, wife of Rashids brother Mohammad Idris Ansari, her sister Putul and their mother Wahida Khatun had conspired to kill Rahim. 

 We are carrying out a post -mortem. The cause of death can be determined only after we get the report, said Milan Das, additional superintendent of police (town). According to him, there were no injuries on the body. Wahida and Putul were detained for questioning. 

 An officer investigating the case said a divorce case is pending between Idris and Asgari. Rashid and Yasmin are helping Idris in getting the divorce. Asgari now stays in her parents house, near the area where Rahims body was found.

 The officer added that Asgari, along with her mother and sister, used to visit the Ansaris often and heated arguments frequently broke out among the families.

 Asgari, Wahida and Putul last visited Ansari on Sunday evening. Right after they left our house, my only son went missing, said Yasmin. They abducted and killed my only son to settle scores with us.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Neena natter

Screen On amp; Off

 There?s something about Neena Gupta. In town for her first foray on the Bengali small screen with two telefilms for Tara Muzik, her presence has caused quite a ripple of excitement in studio para.

 Sitting in Mumbai, she was cribbing about not having any substantial part to play on television till good friend Rathikant Basu, chairman of Tara Bangla, stepped in with a proposal of two tales worthy of Neena?s talent.

 ?I didn?t think telefilms were 

 still prevalent on television. Never having worked in one 

 before, I said yes instinctively,? says Neena (picture by 

 Aranya Sen).

 First up, Sheth Pathorer Mary directed by Saurav Sarengi. Scripted jointly by Balmiki, Arnab and Saurav himself, this is a tale of trauma woven around surrogate motherhood.

 ?Playing this particular character of a suffering mother has been truly fulfiling and after many, many years I have felt like an actress again,? said Neena.

 After five days of rigorous shooting, darting from indoor sequences in Tollygunge to the outdoor locales of Barrackpore, Neena finally took a breather on Friday.

 ?The indigenous endeavour of a compact and dedicated team of workers was simply remarkable. The kind of love and warmth from the entire team was something I?ve never received. It was a touching moment when they gave me a present with all their signatures on it? I want to come back to work here again but maybe in better weather,? she smiled.

 Next up, Lajwanti, directed by Abhijit Dasgupta, a tale set in a Ludhiana during Partition when women were kidnapped and sent for an exchange between India and Pakistan.

 ?It?s excellent, how she lives and breathes the character of Lajwanti she?s playing. She?s always ready to improvise in every scene. Aware of the tight budget, she even carried her own clothes and accessories to suit the character and the time period,? gushed Abhijit Dasgupta.

 Language was not much of a barrier for Neena ? who did part of her schooling from a Bengali-medium school in Delhi ? as her accent went well with both the characters she was playing.

 Though Satyajit Ray?s films and Ritwik Ghatak?s Meghe Dhaka Tara constitute her only true exposure to Bengali cinema, Neena is quite open to playing an interesting role in Bengali films.

 Neena, whom Saurav Sarengi describes as ?a thorough professional who gives out very positive vibes?, has played actor, director, producer and show host.

 Ask her about her image of associating with woman-centric projects and she plays it down: ?Both the man and the woman in any plot are central figures in which each character complements the other.?

 Sheth Pathorer Mary and Lajwanti will be shown by early-September.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

The willow woman

Screen On amp; Off

 Going by the number of middle-aged men who queued up for some Mandira Bedi souvenir ? photographs or autographs or both ? at the British Council on Monday evening, SET Max can be assured of new TRP records during the upcoming Champions Trophy. It somehow didn?t matter to most that she was there just to launch a cricket book. And she wasn?t complaining. 

 Gone are the days when Mandira Bedi would try to ?blend with the furniture? on a cricket forum. She is now the face, the voice and the form ? those chatty and charming noodle straps should find a place in Wisden ? of cricket as a family sport in India.

 ?Regardless of who thinks what, I am going to be out there on TV during the Champions Trophy and World Cup,? she announces with an emphatic elan that proves she is no longer in Geoffrey Boycott?s ?corridor of uncertainty?, even if she?s channel-hopping.

 The lady still can?t stop talking about the Indian win over West Indies on Sunday night. ?I had to catch the early morning flight to Calcutta but I stayed up in a sleepy state to watch the historic victory,? she gushed.

 ?An Indian win on foreign soil is lovely in itself and when it happens after 35 years and that too on Day 3, it?s truly unbelievable. With all the football happening and with India failing to win despite having the upper hand in most of the matches, the series was turning out to be a dampener. But the victory has changed all that.?

 Call it the sheer love of the game or just studious homework ? she will be headed for the Caribbean in a few months? time for the World Cup ? Mandira doesn?t get her facts wrong these days. On cricket that is. ?I don?t like football that much but I didn?t miss the semi-finals (!),? she said, the night before Germany took on Italy in Dortmund. She continued: ?No, I am not a Beckham fan at all but I did like Messi.?

 No own goal with that one. But it?s surprising that no one these days has anything to ask Mandira about movies. She didn?t get Shah Rukh in Dilwale... but the lady?s chipped away at celluloid time and again. And her kitty?s full again. ?There?s a small 10-minute film called Matrimony in Sanjay Gupta?s experimental Dus Kahaaniyan, a collection of 10 short stories. My particular short is directed by Sanjay himself and stars Arbaaz Khan.?

 Sanjay is also directing Mandira in a full-fledged film called Alibaug, which also features Sanjay Dutt, Gul Panag, Rohit Roy, Manasi Joshi Roy, Madhavan, Sameer Soni, Sanjay Suri and Sudhanshu Pande. ?Sanjay (Gupta) thought of casting his friends, rather than stars, in this film dealing about friends.?

 Mandira?s also doing a film with the Red Ice production house. ? It?s set in Rajasthan and is tentatively titled Manorama,? she revealed. ?It stars Irrfan besides three women. I am one of them and I have no clue who the two other ladies are. I am only concerned about my own role and frankly don?t care about the rest,? she said, pointedly.

 Before Manorama, Mandira is slated to fly down to Hyderabad for 20 days to shoot a Telugu film. She, however, couldn?t single out the reason why she had verbally agreed to do the film. ?It is kind of out of the blue but I will be doing it to notch up another experience,? was her explanation. ?I had done an item number in a Tamil film and after the Telugu film, I can say I have done it all down south.?

 But why isn?t she in husband Raj Kaushal?s new big-budget film Anthony Kaun Hai, starring Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi, after playing leading lady in his previous effort? 

 ?After Shaadi Ka Laddoo, we mutually decided that we should not repeat our mistakes,? she laughed. ?But seriously, some spouses can work together but we just can?t. So, I am doing absolutely nothing in Anthony Kaun Hai. Maybe the reason he?s so excited about this film is because I am not in it,? she smiled.

 Meanwhile, we all wait for Mandira to storm our small screens again, not to make Deals or Idols but to talk cricket. She just makes the game look, err sound, so much more fun.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Molest sentence was swift but soft

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The conviction of Vishal Sahoo for the molestation of two Irish women near New Market within five days of the complaint being lodged is a record for Calcutta Police. 

 Never before has the force secured punishment faster in a similar case. The punishment, a fine of Rs 2,000, however, has angered many and disappointed the cops.

 On Friday night, Sahoo molested the tourists on Sudder Street. When they raised an alarm, he fled on his motorcycle. The complaint was lodged with New Market police station the next day. Sahoo was arrested at his Taltala residence on Sunday night. He was produced in court the next day. The chargesheet, too, was submitted the same day. 

 On Wednesday, the tourists identified Sahoo in Bankshal court. He later confessed to his crime and was punished under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code. Those convicted under the section can be fined or jailed up to two years or both. 

 If the women had left the city, convicting Sahoo would have been impossible, admitted an officer of the thana. 

 Kakoli Bhattacharya of Swayam, which works for womens rights, asserted: Measures have to be taken to prevent such incidents and if a person is found guilty of such a crime, his punishment must be exemplary. Sahoo could have been imprisoned.

 Vice-chairman of West Bengal Legal Aid Services Gitanath Ganguli observed that the law is not strong enough to curb violence against women. 

 There should be a stringent act. Slapping a fine or sending a person to jail for a couple of weeks cannot be the punishment for such an offence, he asserted. 

 Had Sahoo spent even 10 days in jail custody, he would have learnt his lesson, declared an officer of the detective department.

The crowning of Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006. Finally the big moment arrived on the night of May 27. As the clock struck six, the gates of Pala at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers flung open to let in an army of eager parents, siblings and boyfriends. After all, for most of the 20 hopefuls this was the first brush with the ramp. Top that off with eastern Indias largest beauty pageant ? no strength of cheerleaders would be enough. 

 The seconds before the winners were announced ? Madhabilata Mitra (a mountaineering instructor from Calcutta), Priyanka Laurembaum (first runner-up; a student from Manipur), Lisa Nandi (second runner-up; an aspiring actress from Jalpaiguri) ? were taut with suspense. But the evening began on a gentler note, with a dance performance. Luckily, it was not the run-of-the-mill troupe called in to fill in time, but the 20 finalists on stage together for the first time. They performed to a piece choreographed by Sukalyan Bhattacharya.

 It was time for the introduction of the girls on the plasma AVs. First they walked the ramp in casuals by Westside, flashing their best smiles for that one moment of the judges attention. Then it was ethnic time: they appeared in glittering lehngas. 

 As the number of finalists came down to 10, it was not just a charming evening any more. The unmistakable whiff of competition tensed the air a bit.

 Time for the one-on-one with the judges, and some clich?s. What is more important ? winning this title or winning hearts? But the girls answered dutifully. The number was cut down to five, including a surprised Rebecca Banerjee from Calcutta and Shilpi Chakraborty from Kankinara, who participated despite family opposition. A common question led to the final three. 

E-quotient

 The entertainment quotient never fell short here at Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006. The show kicked off with the fusion dance number and went on to a high energy act by pop diva Alisha Chinai and her dancers. Taking the stage in a black fur and satin number, Alisha looked every inch the baby doll that she is known to be.

 She sang Made in India, of course, followed by the soft Tinka tinka, followed by a short break. She was back just before the top three winners were announced, taking the audience to a new high. Lover girl, No entry, Soniya and then finally, the long-awaited Kajra re had the audience screaming for more.

 A show by MP Jewellers, who also crafted the crowns, added more glitter. City models like Priyanka Kohli, Amrita Sengupta and Bidita walked the ramp with the Tollywood glam brigade Locket Chatterjee, Kanchana Maitra and Rimjhim Gupta, their black tops, satin sarongs and smoky eyes offsetting the gold. 

Panel poser

 Tollywood actress Rituparna Sengupta, poet Joy Goswami, Rajeev Sujal Khandelwal, VLCC founder Vandana Luthra and model Nethra Raghuraman. 

 With a panel like this, the questions were bound to be an eclectic mix. 

 While Vandana sashayed in in an exquisite Sabyasachi Mukherjee cream-and-gold kalidaar kurta, Rituparna wore a stunning black sari and Joy Goswami stuck to his signature clean-line kurta. Nethra, on her part, looked every bit the model-turned-beauty contest judge in a black number. 

 Rajeev, to all the womens delight, looked gorgeous in a classic black suit and baby pink shirt. 

 Armed with questions, the judges took their seats and focused on their assignment (barring the occasional SMS and chatting). We loved Joy Goswamis frequent apologies about his first-time as a beauty pageant judge! 

 Nethra was bowled over, except for one thing. I am indeed impressed, actually amazed at the standard. If only they were taller? But considering some of them are so beautiful, they will make great print models.

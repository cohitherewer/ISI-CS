The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Summer?s barely here but roadside sherbet and ice creams vendors are already 

back. Many station themselves right outside schools across the city and innocent 

students, lured by them, consume these and fall ill. On many occasions, I have 

spotted children coming out of their campus and buying these unhygienic sherbets 

and ice creams during their recess. The school authorities should restrict this 

practice. Even the fresh juice and cut fruit sold on the pavement are quite unhygienic. 

Though the hawkers claim that the products are fresh, many consumers end up at 

doctors? chambers with dysentery, diarrhoea and viral infections. I request the 

authorities, especially the senior health officers of the civic body, to take 

proper measures right now so that fewer people succumb to diseases this summer 

after consuming roadside food.

 The helpline for BSNL customers is literally of no use. It?s an ordeal just 

getting connected. And if a customer is lucky enough to get through, the customer 

care executives are unable to tell much about the company?s services. On one such 

occasion, when I asked an executive about a new scheme, he simply said that he 

didn?t have any knowledge about it. This, despite all newspapers carrying advertisements 

about the scheme. What is the use of such a helpless helpline?

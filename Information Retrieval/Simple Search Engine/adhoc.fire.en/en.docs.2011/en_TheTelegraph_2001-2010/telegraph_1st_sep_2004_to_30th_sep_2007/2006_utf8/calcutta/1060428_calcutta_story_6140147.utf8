 Leaders or bullies in school 

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 A rising trend of students domineering over peers has the authorities of several reputed schools in Calcutta worried. 

 Students between 10 and 17 years of age are increasingly showing a tendency to unnecessarily dominate their juniors and classmates.

 The trend has prompted the schools to question the practice of inculcating leadership qualities among students by making them prefects, captains, monitors and house heads. Most schools have noticed that students, after being selected to one of these posts, develop a tendency to browbeat their friends.

 ?The students showing this tendency are generally good performers in studies. They have the leadership qualities, but what they lack is a sense of ethics,? said Laila Koshy, head of the Plus II section of La Martiniere for Girls. ?We have found that the leaders impose their decisions on others.?

 Agrees Keya Sinha, principal, Vivekananda Mission School. She said complaints from students against the leaders are on the rise.

 In a bid to tackle the situation, some of the schools are engaging consultants from the corporate and spiritual worlds to guide the students on ?effective leadership qualities?.

 La Martiniere for Girls has recently organised a workshop addressed by management consultant R.R. Devadasan. She attributes the problem to the environment in which the students are growing up. According to her, students tend to idolise those who exercise power over others. They develop an autocratic syndrome, which comes to the fore when they are placed in a position of power. 

 Vivekananda Mission School is organising interactive sessions with Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture for the students, so they can overcome the problem of maladjustment with their peer group, said principal Keya Sinha.

 C.R. Gasper, principal of St Augustine Day School, has adopted a different technique. ?We have divided the students and teachers into small groups. Each group has a leader, who is given certain assignments. The performance of the groups is judged on the basis of the expertise of the leaders. This helps them overcome their domineering tendency,? Gasper explained.

 Child psychologist Sramana Dasgupta felt students are not familiar with the connotation of the term ?leader?. ?Most students think a leader is the one who can play the game of power. As a result, they miss out on some of the basic qualities, like empathy and the patience to listen to other viewpoints,? Dasgupta added.

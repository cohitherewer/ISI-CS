 Copycat and her kittens 

 What is common to Idaho Gem, Prometea, Dewey and CC? Seasoned quizzards have already pressed the buzzer as I speak, but even those of a non-quizzing persuasion should be able to work this out, especially from the last name. CC or Copycat was the name given to the first-ever cloned pet, who turned five just yesterday. A brown tabby, she has also recently become the proud mother of three kittens, this time without resorting to test tubes.

 In recent years, high theory has made much noise about the idea of the copy or the double, and there is a rather fashionable essay on the subject called the Precession of the Simulacrum by the French theorist Jean Baudrillard (www.egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/). Baudrillard argues that in this day and age of virtual technology, the simulacrum or copy no longer owes its existence to a pre-existing real, but is in itself hyperreal. The real now, he argues, is produced from miniaturised units, from matrices, memory banks and command models and with these it can be reproduced an indefinite number of times.

 Baudrillard was not referring to cloning when he wrote the essay but in reproductive cloning too, it is genetic information which is mobilised to create a new organism, without involving meiosis, gamete formation or fertilisation. In other words, the process is asexual, with only one parent involved. The process is technically known as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), in which genetic material is transferred from the nucleus of a donor adult cell to an egg whose nucleus, and thus its genetic material, has been removed. The reconstructed egg is then treated with chemicals or electric current in order to stimulate cell division till it reaches embryo stage and transferred to the uterus of a female host. 

 If all this sounds too complicated, you can try it yourself at http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/cloning /clickandclone/. This is a virtual mouse cloning centre at the University of Utah Genetics Learning Centre, where you will be able to clone Mimi, a brown female mouse, in six easy steps. The other mice involved are Megdo, the egg cell donor, and a Mommi, the surrogate mother. The only instruments involved are a microscope, a Petri dish, two pipettes and a chemical to stimulate cell division.

 In recent years, there has been much unease over the ethics of embryo cloning, regrettably leading to curbs on stem cell research in certain countries. The objections are largely religious in nature, with the Roman Catholic Church arguing that human life begins the moment a human egg becomes fertilised. But over and above this, there seems to a more fundamental discomfort with the idea of a double or a copy, dating back to the 19th century and known as the doppelganger. So prepare to meet yourself in a weeks time you have been warned!

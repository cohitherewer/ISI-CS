The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tutor with a twist

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manoj Prasad, the friendly neighbourhood tutor who kidnapped, tortured and killed four-year-old Subham Singh, was desperately seeking easy money for years. On Saturday, it pushed him over the edge.

 Manoj told police that he needed the money to marry the woman he loved. We have identified the woman; she lives in south Calcutta. Manoj was jobless but splurged on her, said an officer.

 Cops said the lure of lucre had, through the years, driven Prasad to steal things ranging from wristwatches to mobile phones and wallets from neighbours, friends and even his teachers. Though invariably caught and reprimanded, he refused to mend his ways.

 In 2004, Prasad stole a cellphone belonging to one of his teachers in college. He sold it to a local rowdy who later brought this to the notice of his friends. The teacher was alerted and a police complaint lodged. Realising that he had been exposed, Prasad apologised and promised never to repeat the crime, said an investigating officer.

 About one-and-a-half-years ago, he stole the wristwatch of a neighbour in PN Mitra Lane in Behala. According to police, Prasad used to frequent the neighbours house. Finding him asleep one day, he quietly pocketed the watch. He sold it to a local shopkeeper and bought clothes for himself. A week later the shopkeeper spilled the beans, police said.

 Despite hailing from a relatively well-to-do family, Prasad always had the habit of stealing things from friends and neighbours... His father R. Prasad is a bank employee and both his sisters are married, an officer explained.

 Prasad had passed Madhyamik 2002 with first division marks and then cleared his Higher Secondary (HS) exams in 2004 from Jogesh Chandra College.

 Prasad was very sincere in his studies. It was only after his involvement with the woman that he lost interest in everything else and was desperate to make a killing, said an investigating officer.

 And little Subham was his soft target.

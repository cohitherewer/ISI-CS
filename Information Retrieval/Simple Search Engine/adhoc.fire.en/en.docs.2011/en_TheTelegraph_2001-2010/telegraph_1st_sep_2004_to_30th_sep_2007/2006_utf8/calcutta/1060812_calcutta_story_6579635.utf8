 Of trips, flicks and munch 

Holiday mood

 - City ready to take a hectic break with five-day weekend

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The big-screen bonanza 

 this weekend 

 Wheres the party tonight, ask Abhishek and Preity in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. 

 The answer, from the party people in town, is here, there and everywhere, and for five nights on the trot. There might be a scare in the sky, but on the ground, its party time, as an extended weekend unfolds for a city ever-ready to take a break.

 Leading from the front, of course, is the Writers Buildings babu, all packed and ready to go. 

 With a wave of casual leave (CL) slips at Writers, the high tide at Digha has emerged as a top draw, followed by brief getaways to Bakkhali and Gadiara.

 People are heading for all spots that can be covered in three-four days, from Raichak to the Sunderbans, Gopalpur to Puri. Everything is full for the next six days, says Manish Kumar of Globe Forex and Travels.

 For those staying back, one big draw in the August 12 to 16 (Janmashtami included) period is the big screen from Karan Johars Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna to the adventures of the crazy Gauls in Asterix and the Vikings, to M. Night Shyamalans latest bedtime story, Lady in the Water. 

 We are expecting six big days of movie viewing, for which advances have been opened till next Thursday, says Vikas Syal, general manager, INOX (Forum).

 After films, comes food. Those not leaving town tend to dine out with the family. We actually expect business to go up 15 to 20 per cent during this period, says Nitin Kothari, vice-president of Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Eastern India.

 Coinciding with the comeback call for Sourav Ganguly, its champagne time for the restaurant bearing his name. The current weekend is packed with more-than-normal bookings for Prince of Cal, the lounge bar, but even more amazing are the sell-out bookings for the first three days of next week, says Saikat Sarkar, general manager, Souravs: The Food Pavilion.

 The night haunts around town are gearing up for a blast and in true KANK style, theres one down the road almost anywhere one looks. 

 The holiday mood begins on Friday night and carries on right till the middle of next week. The beginning of the week is usually dull, but it would be quite different next week, explains a spokesperson for Tantra.

 Usually, people here party on Friday and Saturday and take a break on Sunday. This time, we are sure to see many people partying past midnight on Sunday and even on Monday, adds DJ Akash.

 And what about holiday hangouts at high noon? In the past few years, malls have emerged as the favoured fun spots for Calcuttans on a loose end. 

 With the festive season drawing close, discounts being the order of the day and big movies at the multiplexes, this extended weekend is sure to record massive footfall, smiles a spokesperson for Forum.

 If Salt Lakes City Centre is bracing for a crowd crush, from Saturday to I-Day, standalone stores are awaiting a flood of family shoppers. People use these extra holidays to spend time with the family, so the rise in sales that we register is across all segments, from books to CDs to cosmetics, says Gautam Jatia of Landmark.

 So, shop time, showtime or travel time, the Calcuttan will be on the move.

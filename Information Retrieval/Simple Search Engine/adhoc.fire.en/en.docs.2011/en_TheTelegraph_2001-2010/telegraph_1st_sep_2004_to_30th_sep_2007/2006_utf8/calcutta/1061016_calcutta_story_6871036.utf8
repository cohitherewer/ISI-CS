 Low-brow comedy

 Human attitudes and responsibilities are greatly affected by changing lifestyles in todays consumerist, urbane society. Highlighting problems that arise when members of the elite, upper class are prejudiced against those belonging to the indigent, working class, Shirir Neeche also contains ingredients to offer an evening of delightful entertainment. It introduces the audience to a group of hired helps, servants and service persons, who are employed in different capacities in the flats of a high-rise. These men and women have a regular rendezvous below the buildings staircase, where they gossip, pour out their woes and even find solace in one anothers company. The plot of the play thickens when there is a theft in one of the flats, its domestic-help apparently having fled with the valuables. However, the entire lot comes under suspicion and stand in danger of losing their jobs, thus laying bare the fragile foundation of their very existence. Direction: Sohag Sen.

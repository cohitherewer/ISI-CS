 Summer statements from city set

 Wills Lifestyle India 

 Fashion Week is set to roll out its first spring edition in 

 Delhi later this month. Smita Roy Chowdhury 

 checks out the Calcutta connection 

 The once-formidable Calcutta brigade at the India Fashion Week is wearing a far thinner look this time. Star designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee will showcase at the Lakme Fashion Week (where he created quite a ripple last season) in Mumbai later this year. Kiran Uttam Ghosh has chosen to stay away from the fashion week this time too. Even Shantanu Goenka has decided to give it a miss as hes still busy servicing orders from the last fashion week. So, the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week at The Grand in Delhi, between August 30 and September 3, will see precious little participation from the city.

 While the ramp at the Vasant Kunj hotel will witness the spring-summer 2007 lines of Anamika Khanna, Monapali, and Swapan and Seema Suhasaria, Abhishek Dutta and debutante Preeti Jhawar will participate through stalls in the trade area.

 GoodLife takes a peek at the sparse Calcutta collection set to rock the Delhi ramp.

 Anamika Khanna

 ANAMIKA KHANNA

 Design date: A solo show at 6 pm on August 30.

 Genre: Diffusion.

 Title: Botanist.

 Inspiration: Old-style floral paintings.

 Look: Fragile, touch-me-not.

 Colours: Washed-out pastels with strong colour highlights that come as surprises.

 Highlights: Contemporised craft techniques; textures; applique and embroidery; lots of drapes.

 Designerspeak: Its a high-summer line that screams out calm. The attitude is Ive got the world at my feet and I dont care.

 Monapali WLIFW April 2006 

 MONAPALI

 Design date: A solo show at 7.30 pm on August 30.

 Genre: Pret.

 Title: Thesis-Antithesis.

 Inspiration: Spiritual.

 Look: The collection is divided into three parts. The first one has a neat, crisp and structured look, while the second part of the collection looks heritage, textured and vibrant. The final line is richer than the previous two and looks ethnic and opulent.

 Colours: Part of the collection is in vibrant hues, while theres one monochromatic sequence where whites blend into black, drawing from the ying-yang theory.

 Highlights: Pleats and pin-tucks; modern twist to kantha; signature prints on layers; surface ornamentation with metallic pieces and hand-cut beads.

 Designerspeak: We have broken up the collection into three parts with three starkly different looks. Theres a strong sense of construction in the whole line. The forms are simple and the designs intense.

 Swapan amp; Seema WLIFW April 2006

 SWAPAN amp; SEEMA

 Design date: A two-designer show at 1.30 pm on September 2.

 Genre: Diffusion.

 Title: Madame Butterfly.

 Inspiration: Historical influences from a variety of rich costume heritage.

 Look: Elegant, sensual and opulent, with minimal embellishment and subdued hues, as well as urban feminine.

 Colours: Soft shades of pink, smoky blue and taupe.

 Highlights: Handwork with pearls and crystals; metallic accents; combinations of floral and geometric prints; layering of opaque and sheer fabrics; mix of modern and classic styles.

 Designerspeak: This collection is a tribute to the sophisticated glamorous woman who loves to dress up. She loves fashion, treats it like costume and never forgets that fashion is, after all, supposed to be fun.

 Title: New Robinson Crusoe.

 Inspiration: Travel and journey.

 Look: Rustic glamour with lots of deconstruction and texturing.

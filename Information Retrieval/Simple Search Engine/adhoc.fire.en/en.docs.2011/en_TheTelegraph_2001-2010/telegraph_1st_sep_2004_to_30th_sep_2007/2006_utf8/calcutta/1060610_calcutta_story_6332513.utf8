 Union discord on campus

 - Presidency uproar over new admission form procedure

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Members of the Independents? Consolidation (IC)-led Presidency College Students? Union continued their hunger strike on Friday, protesting the ?blatant and illegal? move of the Students Federation of India (SFI) to approach admission-seekers by providing forms ?through the back door?.

 The IC has alleged that the SFI is taking full advantage of a new, and ?lax?, college rule that does not require marksheets to be stamped at the time of collecting admission forms. 

 This was allowing the SFI to provide application forms to students, hoping that they would enlist with the SFI after admission.

 Members of the college students? union are also protesting the fact that the SFI members, wearing badges, have set up a separate help-desk for students coming to collect admission forms.

 ?This is a blatant attempt to influence those who may get admitted to college,? said Sayantan Saha Roy, general secretary of the Presidency college union. ?We are all students of Presidency College, so why should they go around wearing SFI badges?? 

 Saha Roy claimed the matter had been raised with the college authorities. ?They have turned a blind eye whenever we have pointed out any such malpractice on campus. On Thursday evening, when Arka Dutta, one of our members, wrote to the principal, he was threatened with expulsion,? he alleged. 

 Presidency College principal Mamata Roy Choudhuri admitted that the college had introduced the new system of not stamping the marksheets of applicants, but said she failed to understand why this should be such a major problem.

 ?In any case, we have explained to the students? union that it is now too late to reverse the new system, as far too many candidates have already collected their forms without getting their marksheets stamped,? Roy Choudhuri added. ?We have told them we will revert to the old practice from next year and asked them to withdraw their hunger strike.?

 The principal, however, denied that any of the protesting students had been threatened with expulsion.

 The SFI, meanwhile, played down the IC protest points. ?The allegation that our members are providing forms through the backdoor is baseless,? said Nirabhro Bhowmick, president of the college unit of the SFI. ?And how does it matter if our members wear badges on campus??

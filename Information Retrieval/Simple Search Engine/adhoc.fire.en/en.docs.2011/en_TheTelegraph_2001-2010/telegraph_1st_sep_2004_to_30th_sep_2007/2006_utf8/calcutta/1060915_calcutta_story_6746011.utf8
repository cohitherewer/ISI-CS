 Striking a pose at Sasha. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 What: 

 Sashay with Sasha.

 Where: Sasha at 27, Mirza 

 Ghalib Street.

 When: Wednesday afternoon.

 Take a look: Models Tina, Jessica, Neeraj and others paraded ensembles by designers Anshu Arora, Jason Cheriyan and Sonam Dubal. The show was choreographed by Ashish Banerjee.

 Skirts, salwar suits, kurtisyou saw it all. The palette was a riot of hues.

 First up was Anshus collection of skirts and salwar suits. Flowy skirts in crushed fabric and suits with Chinese collars stood out. The style was casual and contemporary. 

 Sonams line was more about kurtis trendy and festive. Intricate embroidery accentuated the look.

 The show ended with Jasons sequence of skirts and jackets. White, off-white and black ruled. Generous doses of texturisation also caught the eye.

 The ensembles are available at Sasha through an ongoing exhibition called Festivities.

 On till September 23, it also offers an assortment of hand-woven patch-worked kurtis, saris, scarves, cotton cut-work bedcovers, candle stands and metal bells.

 These have been sourced from NGOs like Sadhna, Kutch Mahila Vikas Sangathana and Okhai.

 Pocket pinch: The price tag on designer ensembles reads Rs 1,500-plus. 

 Voiceover: This is 

 an endeavour to acknowledge these designers who work very 

 closely with natural fabrics and underprivileged weavers. 

 Plus, this gives us the scope to focus on our clothes section, 

 smiled Roopa Mehta, executive director, Sasha.

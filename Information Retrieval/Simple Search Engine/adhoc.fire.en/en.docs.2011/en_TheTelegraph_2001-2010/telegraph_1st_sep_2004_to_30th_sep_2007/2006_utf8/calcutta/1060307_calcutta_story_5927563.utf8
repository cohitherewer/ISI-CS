 What: 4th Merchants Cup Corporate Antakshari presented by Calcutta Heritage Round Table 67.

 Where: Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).

 When: Saturday evening.

 Take a look: A fun-filled event where professionals from various fields belted out songs for charity. It was a cloudy evening, with a drizzle playing hide and seek. It was enough to delay the open-air programme by a bit, but the sky soon cleared up, much to the relief of the audience.

 The Antakshari drew representatives from 20 companies like Airtel, VLCC, ICICI Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Srei International. The proceeds from the event will be utilised to build a school for underprivileged children.

 The three elimination rounds emceed by Samit Datta had participants racking their brains over the Dhun rounds, latching on to tunes like Likhe jo khat tujhe, Main shayar to nahin played by on-stage musicians.

 A lyric consultant saw to it that the words put to the music were correct. For the visual rounds, the participants had to sing songs to go with the visual clips.

 The eight teams that made it to the finals were VGP Capital, Baljit Securities, Vibes, Ramesh Chandra Parekh, Srei International, Excel Crop Care Ltd, Paharpur Cooling Towers and RCGC.

 Before the finals, an audio-visual presentation about Round Table India highlighted their national project ? Freedom Through Education.

 The grand finale followed, with a series of rounds like Antara, Interlude and On The Buzzer, hosted by Gaurav Gupta and Vasundhara Gupta. The Colourful Ladies round was all visual where participants had to recognise song clips from movies past and present.

 After a tough competition, Paharpur Cooling Towers emerged the winners. Standard Chartered Bank and Ramesh Chandra Parekh bagged the second and third spots. The winners were given trophies and gift hampers. Later at night, DJ Harish kept the dance floor busy.

 Voiceover: It is an effort to combine fun with charity. Most of the participants were bathroom singers, so it was a fun competition, smiled chairman of the organisation Neeraj Banka.

 Class act

 What: Gulab Bari, the annual classical musical evening hosted by Madhu and Harsh Neotia.

 Where: 7/2 Queens Park.

 When: Saturday evening.

 The ambience: A light spring breeze and pleasant lemon grass aroma filled the air as hundreds of invitees took their places ? on white mattresses or chairs ? to enjoy this traditional treat.

 A well-manicured lawn, complete with shrubs, trees and potted flowers formed a suitable backdrop as the performers left the audience in awe.

 The performances: The stage was set for Pandit Rajan and Sajan Misra and danseuse Malvika Sarukkai. 

 The evenings programme was unveiled by last years recipient of the Jnana Pravaha Scholarship for classical music, Sabina Mumtaz Islam.

 Voiceover: This is our way of encouraging classical music, something I feel the entire society should take responsibility for, said Bimla Poddar, the lady behind Gulab Bari, a 25-year-old tradition of the performing arts.

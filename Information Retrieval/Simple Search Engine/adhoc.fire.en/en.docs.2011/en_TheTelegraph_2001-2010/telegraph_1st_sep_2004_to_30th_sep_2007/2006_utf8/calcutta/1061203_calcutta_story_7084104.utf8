The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For Dada, Didi 

 and Britney 

 BLOG LOG

 The comeback to the Team India 

 crease is big deal for desi blogs. Friends and foes alike 

 have held forth on Sourav Gangulys ticket to South Africa. 

 And the debate has only just begun.

 Before a long jump, youve got 

 to take a few steps back, points out a blogger at http://talkcricket.dopanne.com. 

 Sourav Ganguly is lazy and he has an ego... But ego is 

 a rare thing. You need it to win the World Cup. Add this 

 egoist to Dravid, Tendulkar, Sehwag, Laxman, Dhoni and Jaffer 

 and we suddenly have a batting line-up that is not easy 

 to blow over, he writes. We cannot teach our talented 

 but inexperienced young batsmen to play quality fast bowling 

 overnight. What we can do is call back a guy who has some 

 memory of scoring on hostile pitches and seems to have the 

 hunger to do so again. 

 Some see in Gangulys return, 

 the end of road for Greg Chappell. Rana (http://memoryanddesire.blogspot.com) 

 says: A year ago, I wrote Chappell should be fired after 

 he gave the finger to cricket fans in Calcutta. He should 

 have never been appointed as coach. He has only destroyed 

 the teams morale. Surely, the abominable Aussies contract 

 will be terminated.

 Abhishek Deshpande (http://desicritics.org) 

 is firmly behind the comeback man: Sourav has a huge challenge 

 on his hands, but even if he fails, people will remember 

 him as someone who fought for a year to get back into the 

 team and made it. He will be giving (it) his all. On the 

 cards is an ODI berth and return to captaincy. 

 Blogmaster (http://iccchampionstrophy2006.blogspot.com) 

 sees cold logic in the comeback: What made the selectors 

 look at Sourav? Very simple, there is nobody else to look 

 at. After giving a lot of opportunities to... Suresh Raina, 

 Dinesh Mongia and Mohammad Kaif, the selectors thought the 

 only sensible thing to do at this point is bring back old 

 warriors like Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman. 

 He, however, sees the irony in 

 the selection of a batsman whose decline has been attributed 

 primarily to his vulnerability against the short ball to 

 strengthen a batting line-up that has been systematically 

 dismantled by the surgical, relentless use of bounce.

 Krish (http://clearway. blogspot.com) 

 has woven a conspiracy theory, tongue firmly in cheek: Totally 

 unreliable sources have confirmed that Sourav had a series 

 of telephonic conversations with master batsman (and super 

 model) Sachin Tendulkar. From the records, it is clear that 

 the two have conspired to throw captain Rahul Dravid and 

 coach Chappell out of the team. Sachin has made the necessary 

 arrangements so that the team performs really badly (a not-so-difficult 

 proposition anyway) to put Chappell and Rahul in a spot. 

 The cheers for Dada among Bong 

 bloggers has been matched by the jeers for Didi. Yes, Team 

 Mamatas mayhem in the Bengal Assembly has placed her bang 

 in the line of blog fire.

 Mrinalini Sen (http://mrinalini-sen.blogspot.com) 

 writes: Mamata is such an embarrassment... I find it difficult 

 to believe that she can get away with violence, traffic 

 blockade, a 12-hour strike and near decimation of the Assembly 

 with the cameras rolling. She mightve had a chance with 

 Singur, Calcutta being a red city and all... Just a little 

 restraint wouldve earned her more ears. After Thursday, 

 I not only have no tolerance for such vandalism, I have 

 lost all respect for the Opposition. 

 Pradeep Nair (http://bpradeepnair.blogspot.com) 

 adds: With people like Mamata around, does democracy have 

 any real meaning in India?

 An anonymous blogger (http://vaichatt.blogspot.com) 

 has concluded that the Trinamul chief and her legislators 

 have not seen Lage Raho Munnabhai, else they would 

 not have broken the antiques in the Assembly. He writes: 

 The chief minister, in contrast, has seen the film and 

 learnt a lesson. Thanks to Gandhigiri, he has not 

 arrested the Trinamul MLAs. Instead, he has invited the 

 common man to visit the Assembly and witness the damage 

 done by Mamatas disciples.

 The boos that Mamata has attracted 

 is nothing compared to the bashing Britney Spears has received 

 for her pub(l)ic show to the paparazzi last week. Her MySpace 

 profile is spilling over with comments and criticism about 

 her partying ways post application for divorce.

 Her fans seem disgusted that she 

 is seeing so much of Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, and 

 quite furious about her flash of flesh. Being caught without 

 underpants is not the way to bowl em over, Britney.

 Desperatelyfabulous.blogspot.com 

 has put up a letter addressed to the popstar on her birthday 

 on Saturday. We were so happy when you kicked Kevin Federline 

 to the curb(!). But then you squandered the goodwill by 

 hanging out with the likes of Paris Hilton... Britney Spears 

 flashing herself to the world! I know youre 25, but where 

 are your parents? asks the writer. 

 One fan, with username Save Britney 

 Spears, writes in the popstars MySpace profile: Britney 

 Were all really worried about you! You need to stop partying 

 and be a mom. You devoted yourself to your children when 

 you decided to have them. You cant just go right back to 

 being a party animal!

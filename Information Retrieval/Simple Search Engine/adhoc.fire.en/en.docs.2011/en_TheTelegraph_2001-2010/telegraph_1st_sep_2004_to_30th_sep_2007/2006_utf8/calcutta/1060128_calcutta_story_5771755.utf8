 The complexity of human relationships is never more conspicuous than is evident between husband and wife. And when former spouses meet, their inter-personal dynamics become all the more difficult. Dealing with such an episode, in which Anish and Seema, a divorced couple, meet each other accidentally, Anything But Love explores the entire gamut of emotions that runs through their minds during this chance encounter. Offering an interesting study of human psychology and character and the repercussion they have on the lives of people with whom they are connected, it is a comedy that lays bare human insecurities and follies in a light-hearted manner. Through a fast-paced plot charged with emotive dialogues, it shows us whether Anish and Seema take the second chance that life offers them or decide to go their own ways. Full of satirical humour blended with stirring poignancy, the play takes us on a whirlwind theatrical joyride. Direction: Vikranth Pawar.

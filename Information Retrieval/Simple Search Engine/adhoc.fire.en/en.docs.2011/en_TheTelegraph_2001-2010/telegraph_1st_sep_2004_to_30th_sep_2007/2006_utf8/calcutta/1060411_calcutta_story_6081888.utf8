 Cop clamour to cool horses

 Screens of khus khus, buckets of water and lots of pampering. Yet, that?s not enough for Bahadur, Tornado, King Crest and Pratap. And the cops are clueless about how to cool them down. 

 The inability of the horses of Calcutta Mounted Police to cope with the shooting mercury has landed the force in a fix, ahead of the Assembly polls. 

 There are 45 horses in the two stables at the mounted police headquarters on SN Banerjee Road. Almost all of them are finding it difficult to cope with the heat.

 Efforts to keep the stables cool have not yielded the desired result and the mounted policemen are not sure whether the animals will be fit enough to discharge their duties in the busy weeks ahead.

 While some of the young horses have turned violent and disobedient, others have shown signs of discomfiture. Their riders have reported the unusual behaviour to their bosses.

 The power and water shortage has not helped. Senior officers have decided to appeal to the civic authorities to supply two tanks of water every day to cope with the water scarcity. Large generators have been obtained to deal with power cuts.

 The disruptions in power supply reportedly leave the animals on the brink. Additional screens of khus khus have been sought to make the stables more habitable. It has also been decided that molasses would be added to the horses? regular diet of boiled linseed. 

 To supplement the efforts, the mandarins have instructed the caretakers to give the horses a cool bath every alternate day, even if the men in uniform have to fetch buckets of water from outside for the purpose.

 ?The heat this season is proving too much for the horses. The morning shifts are still manageable, but thereafter, it becomes difficult to assign taxing work to the horses. But given the demands of the law-and-order duties, we have little choice. A number of horses have already been declared ?unserviceable? and we don?t want a repeat of last year?s tragedy,? says a senior officer of the mounted police.

 The death of a horse last year due to heat stroke had rattled the cops. It prompted them to dedicate two constables to sprinkle water on the khus khus screens that have been hung on the doors and the windows of the stables.

 Besides, arrangements have been made to ensure that the fans attached to each counter are working. Provisions have been made for installing more fans, if required.

 ?With the office of the deputy commissioner (central) shifting to the Calcutta Mounted Police building, there has been a problem of water shortage,? explained joint commissioner Kuldiep Singh.

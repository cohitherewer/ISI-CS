 The memories are beginning to blur and the pauses between words growing longer. But the mention of one Calcuttan makes Dilip Kumar perk up quite remarkably: Sourav Ganguly. ?Aren?t you proud of him? He is not only a star in sports but he is also such a gentleman, so young and so able. They tried to belittle him but I am sure he will come out fine... He reminds me of Gavaskar?s shots towards the end of his career.?

 The thespian is in full flow. ?Sourav has such fluency, powerful and uncaring drives? When I was young, I used to dream of driving shots along the turf. I wanted to be a cricketer. I was 15 years old then and realised that I had to earn. I couldn?t have had the luck or the skill. Never had the opportunity... When you have to earn at an early age you get into a different kind of adventure?? lapsing back into memories of old friends, adda and machher jhol that sum up Calcutta for him.

 Dilip Kumar missed all three, in varying degrees, during his recent trip to the city with wife Saira Banu. ?One change I have noticed this time is that people tend to speak more English than Bengali. And I tried to take them to task in my own way?? he says, before springing a surprise query ? ?Tomar ki khabor?? ? in crisp Bengali. ?You know I return to my Bangla instincts whenever I am here,? he adds, ruing the fact that his Bengali has become a little rusty with time. ?But I will get back the right accent if I stay here for a couple of weeks,? he adds, in between long pauses.

 ?Calcutta has changed a lot? It looks better now. The flow of traffic has got better. It?s refreshing and Saira was much impressed? But I missed Calcutta?s food? simple machher jhol. I tried this time too, but it?s never the same taste??

 In the city after a long gap, nostalgia grips Dilipsaab. ?I am missing my dear friends who are no more? Nitin Bose, Bimal Roy, Abhi Bhattacharya, Hemen Ganguly? All very fine people. We used to have pleasant conversation. I loved addas with them,? he says in a voice tinged with sadness.

 Among the old faces he met this time were Mrinal Sen and Tapan Sinha, who had directed him and Saira in Sagina Mahato. So, will we see him on screen again? ?I don?t know??

 He has penned some six scripts, but there?s no concrete plan to turn them into films. ?Maybe sometime later? To be candid, these were like creative releases,? he smiles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Last of Palta upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After meeting the increasing demand for filtered water in Calcutta for 138 years, Palta waterworks reached its saturation point with the addition of a daily 40-million-gallon capacity treatment plant, to be commissioned by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Monday.

 With this addition, the total treated water supply from Palta, which had started as a small, six-million-gallon-capacity plant in 1868, will be 260 million gallons a day, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Sunday. ?If we continue to waste water by keeping taps open, as we do today, the city will face a serious water crisis in a decade or two, since further augmentation of the Palta waterworks is not possible,? the mayor warned.

 According to the water supply department, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is to make provisions for an additional daily supply of about 80 million gallons to phase out the 240-odd deep tubewells and to meet the additional demand to be created by 2025. The CMC will now have to depend on the Garden Reach waterworks of the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority for additional future supplies.

 The civic water supply department distributes 300 million gallons (MG) of water daily, of which 220 MG come from Palta, 40 MG from Garden Reach waterworks and 30 MG from deep tubewells. The projected demand for filtered water by 2025 is about 380 MG a day.

 ?The main constraint to further expansion of the treatment capacity of Palta is that there is no space to lay pipes below BT Road, which connects Tallah with Palta?, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 According to chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity, before distributing the treated water, the CMC will bring the water first to Tallah pumping station, in north Calcutta. Over the past 138 years, Palta?s treatment capacity has been augmented nine times. With every major augmentation, a new big-diameter pipeline was laid between Tallah and Palta to bring the extra water to the city. Thereby, five water mains of varying diameters between 72-inch and 42-inch were laid under BT Road.

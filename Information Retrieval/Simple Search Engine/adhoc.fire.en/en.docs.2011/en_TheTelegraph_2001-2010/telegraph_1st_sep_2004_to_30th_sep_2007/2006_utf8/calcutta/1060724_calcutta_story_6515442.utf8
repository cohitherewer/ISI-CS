 Showcause notices will be slapped on Presidency jail superintendent Kamal Mukherjee, chief discipline officer Paresh Bose and four other employees in connection with the recovery of a mobile phone from near a cell.

 The mobile phone, without a SIM card, was found on July 20 amidst a bundle of clothes near Cell No. 5, in which Raja Dutta is lodged. He is charged with murdering New Alipore-based realtor Mahesh Agrawal.

 A senior officer told Metro on Sunday that disciplinary action is being initiated against a section of jail employees on the basis of the findings of a probe conducted by deputy inspector-general of prisons (security) S.R. Hussain.

 ?We are concerned over the lapses in security in a jail like Presidency, where high-risk criminals are lodged,? the officer said. ?We cannot put a lid on the matter by punishing some jail warders. Senior officers, too, will have to face the music.?

 According to him, this was the second time within 10 days that a mobile phone was found at Presidency jail (on July 10, a phone was recovered in the jail hospital).

 Three years ago, a phone was found near the cell of Aftab Ansari, a convict in the American Center attack case.

 The state home department has sought a report from inspector-general of prisons B.D. Sharma on the recovery of mobile phones on July 10 and 20.

 Following the July 20 recovery, Raja has been shifted to Alipore Central jail. ?We shifted Raja on Saturday as part of our effort to step up security on the Presidency jail premises,? said Ramapada Bhattacharya, additional inspector-general of prisons. 

 The cellphone, he added, has been sent to a service provider to verify whether it was at all used by any inmate.

 Jail officers are also interrogating Jishu Jain, a co-accused in the promoter murder case, who is lodged in Alipore Central jail.

 ?Jishu may throw some light on how the phone was sneaked in,? said an officer associated with the probe.

 Security has been intensified at Alipore Central jail, where ?high-profile? criminals like Aftab, Guddu, Hatkata (one-armed) Dilip and those involved in the abduction of Khadim?s owner Parthapratim Roy Burman are lodged. 

 ?Watchtower vigil has been stepped up and restrictions have been imposed on entry of visitors,? said a senior officer.

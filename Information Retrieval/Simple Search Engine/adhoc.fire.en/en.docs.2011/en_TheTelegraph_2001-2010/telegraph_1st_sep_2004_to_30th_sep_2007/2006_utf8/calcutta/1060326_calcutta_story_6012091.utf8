 PASSION

 Last week a news channel carried 

 a story done by PETA, India, volunteers on the zoos of eastern 

 India. It was shocking to say the least. Visitors in the 

 Shillong zoo were seen drinking and then assaulting animals. 

 One even gave a lit cigarette to a fox. No zoo-keeper was 

 around to stop them. 

 In the Guwahati zoo, a bear infested 

 with ticks was seen crying and begging for food from the 

 visitors. In the same zoo, a one-horned rhino has been living 

 alone in his enclosure for 36 years. He has developed a 

 wound above his horn from banging his head on the wall of 

 the enclosure in frustration.

 Such is the deplorable state of 

 zoos not just in eastern India but throughout the country. 

 According to the reports by PETA volunteers, there is a 

 slaughterhouse on the premises of the Jodhpur zoo. In the 

 Veermata Jijabai Udyan zoo in Mumbai, a male elephant has 

 been chained for over six months without being released 

 even once to roam his enclosure.

 Zoos claim that they exist for 

 education and conservation but what, pray, is to be learned 

 by watching tigers, monkeys and other intelligent animals 

 walk in endless circles in pitifully tiny cells?

 A worldwide study of zoos conducted 

 by the Born Free Foundation revealed that zoochosis, a psychological 

 disease caused by stress is rampant in confined animals.

 Zoo animals are known to display 

 zoochosis by engaging in abnormal behaviours such as head 

 bobbing, biting cage bars, pacing and severely mutilating 

 themselves. Many of these animals die prematurely as a result.

 Such bizarre behaviour has nothing 

 to do with how animals live and behave naturally in the 

 wild. Torn from their families and often alone, many of 

 these sensitive animals are in a constant state of grief 

 and misery.

 Zoo staff, zoo vets and other 

 relevant officials are often ill-trained and ignorant of 

 animal psychology and insensitive to the condition of the 

 very animals they are supposed to be caring for. The little 

 solace that the animals can hope for is also taken away 

 from them when unruly visitors torment them by pelting stones 

 and plastic bottles at them.

 According to Anuradha Sawhney, 

 chief functionary, PETA, the Central Zoo Authority has de-recognised 

 some of the zoos, like the one in Bikaner. Therefore the 

 onus is on the state governments to take timely action and 

 ensure that these animals are relocated. Every day that 

 is postponed, it?s the animals that suffer.

 In a country that prides itself 

 on being ahimsa vaadi, I believe we are on the borderline 

 of humanity. We need to figure out who the real beasts are: 

 them or us?

 PS: Special thanks to PETA for 

 their extensive research in the zoos of India.

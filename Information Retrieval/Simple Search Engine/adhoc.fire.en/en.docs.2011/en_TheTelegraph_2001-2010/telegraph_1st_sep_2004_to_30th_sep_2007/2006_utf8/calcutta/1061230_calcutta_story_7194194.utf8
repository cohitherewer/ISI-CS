 - CHECK-UP CAMPS AHEAD

 BENEFIT SCHEMES: Specially-abled children let their spirits soar. A Telegraph picture

 The family welfare department and the state disability commission have undertaken a special drive in all 142 civic wards to issue certificates to the specially-abled. The certificates will enable the recipients to enjoy benefits under a series of schemes being implemented by the government.

 Before the issuance of the certificates, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) will organise camps across the city to conduct medical check-ups of the specially-abled.

 Many are unaware that identity proof is a must for getting the certificates. Unfortunately, several specially-abled are homeless and do not possess any identity proof, said Sabir Ahmed, programme coordinator of Calcutta Samaritans, an NGO associated with the project.

 Earlier, it used to take more than two years to issue the certificates. But in these camps, the entire process will be over in a day and the certificate will be handed over in a month, Ahmed added.

 The family welfare department and the disability commission have recently issued a circular to all government hospitals, asking them to send medical teams to the health camps.

 According to a recent survey conducted by the NGOs, there are 2,379 specially-abled persons in the 142 wards of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The concentration has been found more in Ultadanga, Park Circus, Topsia, Cossipore and Brace Bridge than in other pockets.

 The government had undertaken the programme to issue the certificates after the UN declared 1981 as the international year for the disabled. But the drive lacked a thrust, thanks to the ignorance of the families of the disabled, said K.S. Adhikari, deputy disability commissioner.

 Special camps will also be held in Purulia, Burdwan, Birbhum, Bankura and West Midnapore for leprosy patients. Fifteen camps will be held in 11 blocks in these districts.

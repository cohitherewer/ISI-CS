 Neelam shows off her jewellery creations 

 She has never seen Calcutta but is coming down with her jewels because the city, she has heard, is a fantastic market. She is never going to sign any more films but is more than happy modelling her own collections. She believes in never say never.

 Meet Neelam Kothari. The screen star, who after playing leading lady in more than 50 Hindi films, is now all set to make her mark as a leading high-end jewellery designer.

 Not any sudden switch this, for Neelam always knew that the family business was what she eventually wanted to join. I used to go over to my fathers office during my free time and he taught me about sorting and costing, she tells GoodLife from Mumbai. This pastime now takes up more than the day because an average day is completely spent at her jewellery studio, the glamour of the screen having been replaced by the glitter of jewels.

 Her signature collection has adorned some of Bollywoods most powerful ladies like Gauri (SRK) Khan and Suzanne (Hrithik) Roshan. Its Calcuttas turn this week to be bedazzled by Neelam Jewels. 85 Lansdowne is hosting an exhibition on August 24, 25 and 26 showcasing Neelam Jewels. 

 I have some clients in Calcutta and was quite keen on coming there Someone mentioned 85 Lansdowne and I contacted them for an exhibition; they seemed eager, says Neelam, clearly looking forward to her visit.

 85 Lansdowne, too, is proud to be associated with Neelam Jewels. Her line is well designed and executed, and her quality sets great standards, says Shalini Nopany from the south Calcutta fashion address.

 The exhibition will showcase Neelams festive and bridal collection. The line comprises lots of sets, basically solid pieces with investment value, she says. The high point, Neelam adds, will be lots of rubies and emeralds (her favourite stones) and in sync with the seasons colour forecast.

 l hand-crafted, her jewellery is set in 18-carat gold and platinum and offers rings, pendants, earrings, bracelets, bangles and necklaces. The price tag: Rs 50,000-plus.

 Her style is all timeless and classic funk is not something she quite approves or relates to. Many women today pick up jewellery that is extremely trendy but those buys, according to me, arent very sensible picks. Jewellery should be something to pass on.

 Trends, however, cannot be ignored. So, expect fine high-end as well as semi-precious party jewellery keeping with todays trends and tastes.

 But doesnt the cine spotlight beckon the bubbly girl of Jawaani or the cameo lady of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai? I really dont miss the limelight one bit. In fact, I find the pancake process quite a headache these days. I am really happy where I am today, she laughs.

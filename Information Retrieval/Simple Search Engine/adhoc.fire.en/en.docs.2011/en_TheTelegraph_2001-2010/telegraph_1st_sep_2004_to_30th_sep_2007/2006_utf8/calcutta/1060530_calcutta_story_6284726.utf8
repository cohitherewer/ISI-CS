 Steps for timely results

 - Centralised evaluation of CU undergraduate exams

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ten thousand teachers of colleges across the city, selected to evaluate answer scripts of the current year?s BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I and Part II examinations, will have to work overtime through their summer vacation to minimise delay in declaring the Calcutta University results.

 All the exams were deferred by a month or two because of the five-phase Assembly elections in April-May.

 For the first time, the teachers must bring themselves to the answer scripts, rather than the scripts being sent to them. Several thousand teachers will converge on a centralised location ? preferably a varsity campus ? and evaluate more than 90 per cent of the scripts of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com exams. 

 ?This is the first time in the history of the university that over a million answer scripts of BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II exams will be evaluated in this centralised manner. We have taken this step to save time and expedite the process of publication of results,? Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, controller of examinations of the university, said.

 The BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II exams are now in progress. ?We will have to declare the Part II results in time, in the interest of several hundred students who will seek admission to postgraduate courses in universities outside Bengal,? said Adhikari.

 The university offers BA. B.Sc and B.Com honours courses in nearly 35 subjects. The answer scripts of about 32 subjects will be evaluated through the centralised system this year. In the past, this was done only in the case of subjects like Arabic and Persian, which have few examinees. 

 This year, teacher-examiners will have to evaluate about 550,000 extra answer scripts because the number of Part I examinees has doubled. Usually, about 100,000 examinees appear in the Part I examinations every year.

 Two batches of about 200,000 examinees will write the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I exams this time because the university has split these courses into three parts after abolishing the old system, in which Part I covered two years and Part II a single year.

 To cope with the situation, Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), said it is mandatory for every examiner to correct the scripts of at least two examinations (two Part I and one Part II). Usually, a teacher who examines the script of one is not required to examine the other.

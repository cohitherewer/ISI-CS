 Electric shock for CMC

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 A soaring electricity bill in the labour quarters of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has forced the authorities to launch a power audit in various civic establishments in the city and Palta, in North 24-Parganas.

 Of the Rs 120-crore power bill that the CMC pays every year, Rs 10 crore is for the electricity consumed by the 25,000-odd employees staying in the labour quarters.

 In an effort to curb expenditure, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay decided at a meeting on Friday to ask the lighting department to carry out a power audit in the labour and staff quarters. 

 The mayor and the commissioner were surprised to find out that the employees staying in the quarters are the biggest power guzzlers in the entire civic establishment.

 Bhattacharyya, under pressure from the state government to make an allotment for power in the civic budget, said: ?It is hard to justify a recurrent expenditure from the civic coffers for the employees? personal consumption of electricity.?

 Bandyopadhyay said: ?We once tried to allot the employees individual meters, but CESC had expressed its inability to provide so many separate connections.?

 The CMC labour quarters are located at over 134 places across the city. According to the lighting department, a good number of employees use electric heaters, which consume huge amount of power, to cook food. Lamps glow almost round-the-clock in several quarters.

 Most councillors think that before asking households to cough up water charges, the authorities should deduct at least Rs 200 from the salary of each employee staying in the quarters for paying their power bill. Mayoral council member (lighting) Sushil Sharma said the power bill of the CMC used to be paid by the state government. It?s only recently that the onus was shifted to the civic body.

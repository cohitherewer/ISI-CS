 Uniform code to rein in private schools

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A new set of rules is on the cards for private English-medium schools.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to revise its code of regulation for Anglo-Indian schools and frame a set of guidelines that will be applicable to all private schools, including the ones run by minority communities.

 ?There will be a single code of regulation for all private schools, including the ones run by minority bodies. The process of revising the Code for Regulation for Anglo-Indian and Listed Schools, 1993, is on,? disclosed school education minister Partha De.

 The present code, framed in 1993, is meant for only 69 Anglo-Indian and 400-odd unaided ICSE and CBSE schools, notified as ?listed? institutions.

 Sources said the revised code would empower the government to take effective action against schools found violating the provisions. 

 Under the current code, the government can withdraw the no-objection certificate it had granted to an Anglo-Indian or ?listed? school if the authorities are found to have violated any provision.

 Though such a step may lead to cancellation of the affiliation of the school, the government seldom withdraws the certificate, thinking of the future of the students.

 ?There is no use having a code that cannot be enforced. A revision is necessary to ensure that all schools comply with it,? said an official in the school education department.

 ?Most private schools are among the best in the city and we do not want to intervene in their day-to-day functioning. But at the same time, the government needs to keep a watch on certain aspects, including the fee structure and the teachers? salary. The code is being revised to smoothen the supervisory role of the government,? the official added.

 The fact that most private schools do not bother about the current code was evident after a 13-member panel, set up by the school education department to find out ways to regulate the institutions, issued them a questionnaire.

 The schools were asked to provide information about their infrastructure, laboratory and library facilities, teachers? pay-scales, admission system and the fee structure, among other aspects of their functioning.

 Of the 400-odd schools the questionnaire was sent to, only 30 had sent their replies, and that, too, after repeated reminders from the government. No action was initiated against the errant schools.

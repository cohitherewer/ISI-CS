 Bringing together the many faces of modern Indian art, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by a group of well-known city-based painters provides a breathtaking survey of contemporary artistic trends. Featuring works in diverse styles, each bearing the distinctive stamp of its creator, the show offers a remarkable study in creative contrasts. Debabrata Chakrabarti (one of his paintings appears above), Dipti Chakrabarti, Jayant Ghosh and Nirmalendu Mandal show interest in themes related to history, tradition and ethnicity. Their canvases try to establish a romantic connection with the past, evoking moods, emotions and sensibilities in tune with days of yore. The paintings of Subrata Chowdhury, Anup Ray, Debasish Deb and Parvati Mukherjee, on the other hand, express a state of being that is reflective of modern times. Expressing the discord, violence, dilemma and vacuity associated with urban life, their works offer a stark and, at times, shocking overview of our society.

When: Till April 2, 4 pm - 8 pm

 What: 

 A fashion show by children celebrating the first anniversary 

 of Lilliput.

 Where: The Lilliput store in The Enclave, 17/1F Alipore Road.

 When: Saturday afternoon.

 Take a look: Little faces smiled sweetly and paraded garments from Lilliput as they walked the ramp down the centre of the store. To deafening applause from the audience, comprising equally excited parents, 10 little girls did a shake, a twirl and a little jig before heading for a group dance together. 

 The boys were in full swing too, as they spun their ladies to the beats of Hips dont lie and Wheres the party tonight. 

 Donning soft pink frilly frocks, spaghetti flow tops and capris, sequinned and embroidered patterns, Beyblade T-shirts, cargo pants, the rough-and-tough look with denim wear, sporty shoes and slip-ons, the tiny models provided loads of eye-candy. 

 The store also offers a range of ethnic wear for girls and accessories like Power Puff watches and vanity-boxes. Watch out for the winter collection that will include corduroy jackets, trousers, ponchos, woollen knits and more.

 Pocket pinch: Tops for both boys and girls range between Rs 295 and Rs 795 while lowers are priced at Rs 395-plus. Shoes range between Rs 295 and Rs 795. Ethnic wear for girls is tagged at Rs 1,500-plus.

 Voiceover: The clothing we offer is smart, trendy and in line with international standards, chorused Manjari and Ritu, owners of the franchisee store.

 Glam buys

 What: Launch of Puja collection.

 Where: Shagun Wedding Mall on Shakespeare Sarani.

 When: Tuesday morning.

 Take a look: City models showcased the latest offering from the one-stop wedding mall. There is an extensive range of saris, salwar suits, dress materials, accessories and jewellery for women. For men, there are formal clothes and ethnic wear. 

 Also on offer is a line of room furnishings. There are special offers on Hyderabad pearl jewellery, handbags, perfumes and crystal pieces.

 Voiceover: There 

 is something to cater to everyones taste, young or 

 old, smiled proprietor Jaydeep Khaitan.

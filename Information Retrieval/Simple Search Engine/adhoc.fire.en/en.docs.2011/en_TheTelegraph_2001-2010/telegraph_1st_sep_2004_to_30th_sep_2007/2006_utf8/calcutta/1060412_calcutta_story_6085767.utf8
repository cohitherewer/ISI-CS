 Report card of fashion fortnight

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY, 

 who attended both the rebel show in Mumbai and 

 the official one in Delhi, casts a critical 

 eye on the style and the statement, the happenings and the 

 hype 

 Lakme Fashion Week

 Designs: 

 4/5

 There were some strokes of sheer brilliance on the NCPA ramp. To start with, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Ashish Soni enthralled with their lines The Snail and Memsahib Maharani. Then there were impressive acts by Rocky S, Wendell Rodricks, Priyadarshini Rao, Narendra Kumar and Savio Jon, all of whom presented the global look with a strict eye on forecasts for autumn-winter 2006-07. Manish Malhotra made quite an impact with his all-white tone-on-tone look, a surprise shift from his signature loud colours.

 GLAMOUR: 4.5/5

 With almost the whole of Bollywood descending on the NCPA during those five days, and even a hint of Hollywood in the form of Liz Hurleys guest appearance at the pre-event bash, the glam quotient was as high as it can get.

 On the ramp one saw tinsel towns leading ladies Preity Zinta and Kajol along with Malaika Arora Khan and Neelam, and hotbod hunks like John Abraham, Salman Khan and Arbaaz Khan.

 The stars shone down on the front rows in the form of Rani Mukherjee, Karisma Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Twinkle Khanna, Arjun Rampal, Bobby Deol, Tusshar Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Amrita Arora and the like, making for enough eye candy off the ramp, too. Add to that the vibrant Mumbai party people in their glamorous bests, and the designs on the ramp had to fight hard to get noticed.

 Business: 2.5/5

 Over 50 international buyers including Browns from London, Saks Fifth Avenue from New York, Tracey Ross from Hollywood, CK Tang from Singapore and the like, along with 150 domestic ones, could not make the business scene too big in Mumbai. The global fashion bigwigs werent too impressed with the designing scene in India. In fact, Albert Morris of Browns declared that Indian designs lacked in detailing and finish and also pointed out that our designers need to improve their management skills.

 The only designer who managed to impress was Calcuttas Sabyasachi, who bagged orders from near and far.

 Buzz: 4/5

 Thanks to the high star count and a couple of wardrobe malfunctions ? first Carol Graciass top slid and then Gauhar Khans skirt ripped, the debut edition of the Lakme Fashion Week made big news.

 The crowd ? led by the rani of Bollywood ? went ga-ga over Sabyasachis collection, talked about Narendra Kumars on-ramp crusade and dubbed Rahul Misra as the budding star of Indian fashion. All in all, the rebel event managed to keep the tempo going through the five days, being the talk of the nation, for reasons right or wrong.

 Organisation: 3/5

 With 30 designers showcasing through 20 shows, the scale of the event was much smaller than the rival affair. But event managers IMG, who produce events like the New York Fashion Week, made sure that it was buzzing if not big.

 The auditorium at the NCPA was sprawling with ample seats for all. The stall area was modest, but nice. The one flaw in the arrangements: the show timings.

 Even with four shows spread out leisurely through the day, the organisers couldnt stick to the scheduled show hours. On the good days, one could get away with a 20-minute wait. On other occasions, the wait stretched even up to an hour. And this often resulted in chaos outside the show area, with the cameras leading the ruckus.

 Week

 Designs: 4/5

 In the sea of collections unveiled on The Grand ramp, a handful did stand out. Manish Arora tops the list with his signature dramatic clothes that made up his line titled Little Red Riding Hood Comes To India Via Japan. Rajesh Pratap Singh with his trademark clean, structured international collection made a strong style statement too.

 The other show-stealers were Aparna Chandra with her no-embellished black-and-white silhouettes, Varun Bahl with his Multiple Personality Disorder, Shantanu and Nikhil with their unusual black-and-white and lime green-and-brown combos, Rina Dhaka with her clean and polished 90s inspired look.

 Some shows that also left an impact were Tarun Tahiliani, Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla and Satya Paul.

 GLamour: 2/5

 Cricket great Brian Lara catwalking for designer Deepika Gehani did make for an impressive start, but middle-order glamour could not keep pace with the opening flourish. The only other starry steps on the ramp were that of Shilpa Shetty for the Tarun Tahiliani show and Bipasha Basu for the grand finale by Monisha Jaisingh (if you discount the gawky Bachchan beti, that is).

 The crowd profile, too, was quite sad. The only stars who caught the eye were Jaya Bachchan and Sonali Bendre cheering Abu-Sandeep. VJ-turned-actress Suchitra Pillai was glued to her front row seat throughout the five days, taking a break between two shows to change and re-apply her make-up! Let alone stars, the Delhi party people were also few and far between. Friends, families, fellow designers and journos jostled for space in the rather cramped show areas.

 Business: 3.5/5

 It was raining orders at the Delhi extravaganza, one gets to hear. Some participating designers even dubbed it the most successful fashion week in terms of business. A different side of the story though reveals that most of the big international buyers had already finished their autumn-winter buying and were here to watch and observe potential talent.

 Though the big names (read Bloomingdales, Harvey Nicholas and Selfridges) were merely observing, the bulk of business came from places like Kuwait, Dubai, Spain, Switzerland, Costa Rica... All in all, the designers went home happy with their collections booked for the coming seasons.

 Buzz: 2/5

 To put it politely, the spark was missing from the official event. No stunning new talent, no bold statement, no juicy controversies, no glam element in the crowd? the ingredients for a rocking fashion week were somehow not there. 

 With nine shows dotting each days schedule, by the end of the third day most people were tired of the continuous parade of clothes. Barring the mandatory applause at the end of each show, there wasnt much enthusiasm among the crowd either. Even JJ Valayas high-drama war on the ramp couldnt generate much of a response.

 Organisation: 2.5/5

 Could we have some more seats please? And a well demarcated zone to accommodate the journalists and the TV crew? And please, a temperature-controlled show area would have been of great help? With the mercury touching 40 under the April sun in Delhi, a makeshift ramp covering a part of the lawns was hardly hot as an idea. The result was a sweltering and suffocating second main show area. The heat persisted in the evenings too. And the models here had company on the ramp in the form of insects hovering above their heads.

 The first main show area inside the hotel also suffered from a seats crunch. Both the auditoriums had as many people standing to watch a show as there were seated. In fact, there were even people jostling for a foothold.

 The wait to catch a show here was much less than in Mumbai. A fashionable 15-minute delay was bearable. But there were exceptions like the Abu-Sandeep show where the gates were thrown open 45 minutes after the scheduled time, apparently for security reasons.

 The one commendable act: Percept D Mark, the event managers, roping in the services of British event production house S2, and ensuring the beautiful layout of the spacious stall area.

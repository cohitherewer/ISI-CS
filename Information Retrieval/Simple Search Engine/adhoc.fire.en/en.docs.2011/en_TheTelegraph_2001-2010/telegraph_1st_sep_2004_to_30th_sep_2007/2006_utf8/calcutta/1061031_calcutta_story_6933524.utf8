The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fair will be foul on the Maidan, once more

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 For the second time in as many years, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has backed out of its commitment not to allow any more fairs on the Maidan.

 From the moves being made by the government, it seems set to get the Maidan to host the book fair this year, too.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said at a recent meeting with the army and the Booksellers and Publishers Guild that the government would move court again for permission to hold the fair on the greens in January.

 The Calcutta High Court had ordered that the greens would be a no-fair zone after April 1, 2005. But the government had pleaded with the court that the book fair be allowed there for the last time in 2006.

 The court accepted the request after the state submitted that an alternative site had been selected off the Bypass for all Maidan fairs to be shifted.

 As the greens belong to the army, the chief minister had approached Pranab Mukherjee when he was defence minister for his consent to not only hold the Book Fair but also the Industrial Trade Fair on the Maidan. The ministry has reportedly cleared the Book Fair as a special case, but withheld permission for the trade fair.

 The decision has left the army fuming. Although the top brass refused formal comment, an officer said: The government is going back on its promise to the court last year. It had submitted an affidavit saying there would be no more fairs on the Maidan.

 The guild, however, said the move was inevitable. Its just not possible to hold the book fair at Milan Mela, off the Bypass, said its secretary Tridib Chatterjee. The site measures around 1.96 lakh sq ft, while our fair on the Maidan takes up 11.5 lakh sq ft.

 It is strange that when the government gave an undertaking to shift the fair to the new site it wasnt aware of the space crunch. And assuming the government was not aware, why did the fair organisers not point it out?

 The governments move has angered the green lobby, too. Environmentalist Subhas Dutta said he would oppose the governments plea to grant permission.

 Why is the government petitioning the court? Is it the organiser or the sanctioning authority of the fair? he asked.

 Those arguing for the fair never come forward to clean up the Maidan after the fair is over. This fair is unfair to the environment, ecology and greenery of the Maidan. Why should concessions be made for the booksellers guild? demanded Dutta, preparing to petition the court to lay down a code of conduct for the fair.

 Some fairplay points raised by the green lobby are: no makeshift toilets or bamboo structures, easy-to-build steel structures be used for smooth setting up and swift dismantling, debris removal within three days.

 Though guild secretary Chatterjee argues that food stalls and the like are essential to market books, Dutta will pray to court that only book stalls be allowed.

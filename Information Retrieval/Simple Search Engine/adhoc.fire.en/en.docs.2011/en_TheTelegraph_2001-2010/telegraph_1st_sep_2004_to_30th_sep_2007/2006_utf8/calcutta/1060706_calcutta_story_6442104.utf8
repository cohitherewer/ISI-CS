 The City Diary

 Three containers laden with 60 metric tonnes of red sandalwood, worth Rs 2.4 crore, were seized during a raid on the port conducted by the directorate of revenue intelligence and Central Industrial Security Force on July 2. An officer said the consignment was booked by an exporter in Howrah and an export house on CIT Road. A preliminary probe revealed that it had arrived from Andhra Pradesh and was to be shipped to Singapore.

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court comprising Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice B. Somaddar on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Biswajit Debnath, the main accused in the Sachin Mukherjee murder case. Mukherjee, a Trinamul leader, was killed in February by goons allegedly hired by Debnath.

 Jhuma Rudra, 19, was arrested on Tuesday night for illegally possessing a firearm. The firearm was stolen from a customs officer while he was travelling on the Darjeeling Mail last week. Police said Jhuma?s father Asim had led the gang that snatched the revolver from the officer. Asim is absconding.

 Justice Asim Roy of the high court on Wednesday adjourned the verdict in the 

case moved by Sahajda Salem, a Jadavpur resident, who has challenged the decision 

of a sessions judge of Alipore. 

 The sessions judge had dismissed Salem?s petition that had alleged that his 

son Sajid and daughter Parvin were expelled from school after a photograph in 

newspapers showed them as Thalassaemia patients. Salem claimed that Sonali Chowdhury 

Dasgupta, who runs an NGO, had organised a stage show in 2003 to raise funds for 

Thalassaemia patients. Sonali had allegedly made Sajid and Parvin pose as patients 

during the show. In his petition, Salem prayed for penal action against Sonali

 Eight armed youths were arrested for allegedly attempting a robbery in New Alipore on Wednesday. The youths were held when the police were patrolling the area. Four firearms, three bombs and a cell phone were seized from them. All have been remanded in police custody.

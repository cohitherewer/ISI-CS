 A traveller in the world of art, Sanat Kar uses his experiences as steps in his ceaseless quest towards knowing the unknown. The ongoing exhibition of his prints, paintings and drawings finds the veteran artist indulging his romantic imagination as a means of coming to terms with the conflicts and contradictions of the phenomenal world. Kar?s works reflect a remarkable constancy in his attitude to life and creativity; an aspect of his personality which, he confesses, is due to his love for the world and his fellow-beings. Representing human entities only in parts, his stylised renditions nevertheless express mental states of innocence, astonishment, awe, wonder and even melancholy, making us aware of the lingering hold of worldly emotions on the artist?s psyche. On the whole, Kar?s art displays a propensity for transforming an object of the real world into an art-specific image, perhaps, as an attempt to liberate it from the inevitable fate of all things mortal.

 Every dog has his day. Thursday was Bhujo?s. The two-and-a-half-year-old Golden Retriever was first crowned in the pre-beginner stage. Then the beginners? round started, and there was doubt about whether he should compete with seniors. At last, he was allowed to stride into the ring. He walked out with another silver cup.

 What made the win special is the fact that it came in the 100th year of the Calcutta Kennel Club?s existence. A centenary turn is a rare feat in canine-rearing history. 

 ?We are the oldest affiliate club of Asia,? announced Partha Sekhar Chatterjee, a senior member and breed judge, sitting at the club?s tent on the Maidan where a four-day grand show is on till Sunday. Started by the British, the club though has not managed to archive its starting years. And records are available only from 1958. That is not taking any bit of the sheen off the centenary show.

 So trainer Swapan Das allowed himself a relaxed grin: ?Bhujo was in a good mood today.? His owners from Maniktala had wanted to come over. But Das had put his foot down.

 ?When the owner is away, the pup won?t play? is the moral of the story. For those who cock a snook at this piece of canny wisdom, the example was there in the four-legged person of Buzo who refused to fetch a ball on order. ?His owners have come with him. Now he has eyes only for them,? said his frustrated trainer, withdrawing the debutant from the fray.

 Inspiring awe and terror with his very presence was Rock, the rottweiler. He had come all the way from Kharagpur to script a bit of history. ?He is the first of his breed to compete in the obedience category here,? trainer Pradip Chatterjee said. Just before the show, he had lunged for a running man. The man was lucky. He lost only a mouthful of his shirt. .

 Wagging his tail at his Day II double was 14-month-old Sonus Murdoch. After topping his class, the doberman impressed Indonesian judge Laurentias Suliadi enough to get crowned the best of his breed. ?It will be all play and no exercise for some days as prize,? said his owner Indranil Sur, who ignores the twice-a-week vegetarian stricture in the family to keep Sonus chicken-fed.

 Outside the arena of play some serious work was also being discussed. Top officials of the Kennel Club of India (KCI) have come to Calcutta on the momentous occasion. 

 Secretary C.V. Sudarsan was at hand to discuss the threat that unscrupulous dog dealers and brokers posed to pets. 

 ?The Kennel Club of India wants to protect pedigree. But look at what?s going on,? the man from Chennai exclaimed. Ignorant owners do not ask for certificates of registration with KCI. If they do, false papers are foisted on them. Many dealers, who come from low-income groups just to make a fast buck, keep the pups in unhealthy conditions and sell them off when they are barely days old. The defects become manifest much later. Also, they use bitches as breeding machines.?

 The iron rod will be wielded from May. A resolution has been passed to ensure that a bitch is bred just thrice in three years.

 The centenary show has brought many from afar. The reason for Greg Eva?s visit goes beyond dogs. The president of the Kennel Union of South Africa is here in search of his father?s address during his three-year stay in Calcutta. 

 Captain Samuel Eva was in charge of transport of supplies to the Burma front during World War II. ?He wrote to us in England from here, but half the mail would be censored. So there was no knowing exactly where he stayed.?

 Eva had the whole of Friday to search for the illusive address. On Saturday, he will be off to judge the prestigious all-breeds show which promises to be a canine showcase of the rare and the lovely.

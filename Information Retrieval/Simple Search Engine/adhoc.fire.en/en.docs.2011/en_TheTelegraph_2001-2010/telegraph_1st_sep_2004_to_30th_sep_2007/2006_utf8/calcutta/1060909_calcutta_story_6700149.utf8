What we will wear next summer

Fashion Week - Delhi 

Having sat through the India Fashion Week 

in New Delhi, Smita Roy Chowdhury sifts through the five-day fashion extravaganza 

to pick trends that are sure to travel from the ramp to the racks in spring-summer 

2007

Look

Romantic, sensual, soft, sexy, flirty words that 

describe the super-feminine mood of spring-summer 2007 fashion. Chiffons, georgettes, 

nets, laces, flounces ingredients that work to create that mood.

While Manish Malhotras grand finale collection 

Sensuality, replete with English roses and fluid silhouettes in passion 

hues, epitomised the style sensibility of the season, almost all designers showcasing 

at the five-day fashion extravaganza stuck to the feminine forecast.

Right from the soft styles of the Cue collection on 

the first day, to the romantic Fifties vintage line of Shantanu amp; 

Nikhil on Day II, from Tarun Tahilianis breezy designs and Rocky Ss 

flounces and scallops on Day III to Rajesh Pratap Singhs sexy silhouettes 

on Day IV, and finally Manishs sensual cuts and colours on Day V, the ultra-feminine 

look dominated the ramp through the week.

Colour

Brilliant whites, off-whites, ivories, creams, beiges, 

ecru, nude hues that promise to paint style statements in the coming spring-summer. 

The fashion week kick-started with a riot of vibrant 

Indian shades thanks to Manish Aroras trademark palette, but the mellow 

mood became crystal clear by the end of Day I. 

Cue by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna introduced the 

whites, combining them with porcelain blue, Anamika Khanna took the story forward 

with her line boasting whites and beiges, Monapali opened their show with an all-white 

sequence and Rohit Bal lined up show-stealers in ivories and creams, all on the 

opening day.

The next four days reiterated the mood, with variations 

of white, often combined with black, neutrals and a few other pastels being a 

staple in almost all collections Tarun Tahiliani, Rocky S, Rina Dhaka, Ashish 

Soni, Suneet Varma, Ashima-Leena, Manju amp; Bobby Grover

Silhouettes

Rage

After being the reigning No. 1 for several seasons, 

its finally time to demote skirts to second position, as dresses in a 

mind-blowing array of shapes emerges the clear winner.

Baby-doll, empire-line, shift, trapeze, bubble, frock, 

shirt, wrap, yoke, tube, cupped, pencil, floor-dusters and much more make up the 

silhouettes to watch out for in the summer of 07.

Length

The knee is where it all stops this season, with dresses, 

skirts and even pants rising to that length. Knee-length dresses apart, the full-bodied 

gypsy skirts have made way for knee-length ones in various shapes.

The other hot new silhouette that invaded the ramp 

big-time with the potential to whip up a mini storm off it is the knee-length 

narrow pant. Flaunted by models on the catwalk as well as the fashion audience 

at The Grand, the knee-length pant a cross between capris and shorts was second 

only to knee-length baby doll dresses.

Hemline

 The balloon hemline, a top trend at the India Fashion 

Week Autumn-Winter in Delhi this April, was quite a rage this time too.

Be it the bubble skirts stopping at the knee or dresses, 

balloon hemlines were a dominant sight in many collections Rohit amp; Rahul, 

Rohit Bal, Manish Arora, Shantanu amp; Nikhil, Tarun Tahiliani...

Technique

Cutwork is to spring-summer 2007 what crochet meant 

to autumn-winter 2006-07. A rage at the fashion weeks of last season, the crochet 

has almost entirely given way to cutwork, a dominant feature in the collections 

of most bigwigs at this fashion week.

Cue introduced it early with some lovely cutwork on 

porcelain blue topping white under-layers, and from there on the trend revealed 

itself through the works of Rina Dhaka, Manju amp; Bobby, Rocky S, Prriya Awasthy, 

Ashish Soni and also in an innovative raw-edged form by Meera amp; Muzaffar Ali.

The other technique that emerged on top was pleating. 

Pleats in every form broad, narrow, hand-done, embroidered were seen in almost 

every collection, used generously in knee-length skirts and dresses.

Tucking mostly pin-tucks and some random tucks 

was also widely visible.

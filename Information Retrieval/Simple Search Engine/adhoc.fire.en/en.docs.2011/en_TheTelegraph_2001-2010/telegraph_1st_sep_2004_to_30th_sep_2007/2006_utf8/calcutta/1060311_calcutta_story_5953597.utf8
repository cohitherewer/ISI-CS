 Threat calls in death probe

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The probe into the killing of Jayanta Ghosh took a new turn with two threat calls from a telephone booth in Nasik, Maharashtra, at the telephone booth in Kalyani from where a call had been made to the doctor?s Salt Lake residence.

 The caller asked the owner of the booth, identified as Abdul Halim Haque, about the exact location of the booth and warned him to be cautious while dealing with the police.

 Ghosh, 62, went missing on Monday from his north Calcutta chamber and was found with his throat slit on Tuesday morning at Murshidabad. A call had come to his GD Block residence from the Kalyani booth after his murder.

 ?On Friday, the first call came a little after noon and the caller was looking for a person named Shambhu. Haque disconnected the line, saying he did not know anyone by that name,? said an official of Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

 The second call came a few minutes later. ?This time, the caller threatened Haque with dire consequences, telling him to be cautious while talking to CID sleuths regarding Ghosh?s killing,? said the official. ?When Haque asked about the caller?s identity, the line was disconnected.?

 An officer working on the case said the caller?s intention may have been to divert attention. ?He wanted to prove that our probe is taking a wrong direction. But it seems our line of investigation is on the right track and that is why the culprits plotted the calls.?

 Police, however, claimed that the sketch of the person, who had made the call to Ghosh?s house a few hours after the doctor left his Tallah chamber, was recognised by a few persons. ?We have been provided with some specific information about the caller, whose name cannot be disclosed right now for the sake of investigation,? said an officer.

 He claimed the force is investigating the case from every possible aspect. ?The person who made the ransom call from Kalyani was a local resident. He came to the booth on a bicycle,? said another officer.

 The CID on Friday collected the call statement of the Kalyani booth. ?We will examine Ghosh?s bank accounts to see if any financial transaction triggered the killing,? said a sleuth.

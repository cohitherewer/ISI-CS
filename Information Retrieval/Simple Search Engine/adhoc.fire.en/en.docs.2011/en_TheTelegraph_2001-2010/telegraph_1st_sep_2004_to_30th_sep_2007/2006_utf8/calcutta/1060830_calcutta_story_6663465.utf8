The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Unsafe as any place else

 Todays question: Is Calcutta as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai?

 Gauri Mitra,

 Calcutta is as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai and other big cities are. Metro and railway stations, the airport, highrises, office blocks and bridges are the danger zones. By carrying out an attack in Calcutta, terrorists stand to gain worldwide publicity. 

 Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake

 The attack on American Center was proof of Calcuttas vulnerability to terror attacks. The Maoist groups and terrorists from Bangladesh are all waiting for the right time to launch an offensive. The Metro Railway here is not as safe as that in Delhi. The security measures leave much to be desired.

 Kazi Kamruddin, 

 Lal Bazar Street

 There is no absolutely safe place anywhere, so the security must be watertight at all times. Before the American Center attack, we could have claimed that Calcutta is safer than the other metros, but not any more. It is the duty of citizens to remain vigilant. Samaritans and alert cops can make a difference. 

 Paramananda Pal,

 Karaya Road 

 Terrorists can cause greater collateral damage by carrying out an attack in Mumbai or Delhi than in Calcutta. Hence, damaging property and killing people in Calcutta will only be the last resort for terrorists. This does not imply that the state government should sit back, for the city serves as a shelter for terrorists. 

 D. Mukherjee, 

 Behala

 Places near the border well-connected with other points in a country are generally the most vulnerable to terror attacks. So there is no way we can claim that Calcutta is safe. However, Mumbai being an important commercial centre is more vulnerable to terror attacks.

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road

 Calcutta is a cosmopolitan city like Delhi and Mumbai and plays host to millions of people every year. Terrorists might easily enter the city in the guise of tourists. Apart from religious places, government offices in Calcutta are vulnerable to terror attacks. If necessary, the help of the military must be sought to protect important edifices.

 Subhankar Mandal,

 Palta

 After the Mumbai blasts, Calcutta is highly vulnerable to terror attacks. Serial blasts have been set off in Delhi and Mumbai recently and now it is the turn of Calcutta.

 Amit Banerjee,

 Golf Green

 Calcutta is more vulnerable than Mumbai to terror attacks. Infiltration across the porous state border is easy. The city also has the Metro rail, two major stations and circular rail. There are large crowded markets and big offices. All these are soft targets. After a terror strike, the Left Front can at the most call a bandh in protest. 

 Shahid Pervez,

 Address not given 

 Calcutta is not only vulnerable to attacks by terrorists from across the border, but also to attacks by Naxals and Maoists.

 Tuhin Purkayastha, 

 Parnashree

 Calcutta is as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai. There arent proper security checks at railway stations. The vigil is lax at Metro Railway and airport.

 A. Chatterjee,

 Kalindi

 Calcutta is a big city like Delhi and Mumbai and is as vulnerable to terror attacks. There should be strict vigil at the airport and stations. 

K.B. Goswami,

 Salt Lake

 The less we discuss the issue in public, the better. Or we might give the terrorists ideas. Suffice to say that in a city of the size of Calcutta, which is densely populated and easily accessible from neighbouring countries, it is impossible to eliminate possibility of terror attacks. Government measures can definitely reduce the chances but cannot eliminate the possibility. Public vigil is a must. 

 S. Mukherjee,

 Borehat, Burdwan

 The attack on American Center demonstrated Calcuttas vulnerability to terror attacks. Due to its location, the city serves as a transit point for militants, who are provided shelter by the neighbouring countries. Unchecked migration and unplanned urbanisation has added to the gravity of the threat. The slums have become breeding grounds of criminals.

 Naren Sen,

 Ramrajatala

 In comparison to other cities, the equipment used by Calcutta Police are outdated. The cops would find it impossible to ward off terrorists should they target the city.

 Ajit Kumar Das,

 Naskar Para Road

 Following the attack on American Center, the city police have become more vigilant than their counterparts in the other Indian cities. The Mumbai blasts have underscored the need for caution.

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

 Calcutta is a wonderful city and there is no conceivable logic behind carrying out blasts here. But then the motives of extremists are difficult to fathom. 

 Atif Ayaz,

 Serampore

 If the World Trade Center and Pentagon headquarters can be targeted by terrorists, then why not Calcutta?

Fashion theatre for famous 41

Party time

SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Shah Rukh Khan: Birthday boy 

When a certain Nita Ambani celebrates her birthday 

with a certain Shah Rukh Khan, it can surely be dubbed The Party. With 450 star 

guests in attendance, and a special appearance by Prince Andrew, this was one 

bash Mumbai will remember for a very long time.

Far from the fashion week action at NCPA, Sea Wind, 

the Ambani residence in Cuffe Parade, witnessed the fashion show of the 

season on the evening of November 1. The occasion: a triple celebration.

The bash hosted by Nita and Mukesh Ambani on her birthday 

was in honour of the soon-to-be-married couple Avni (Praful Patels daughter) 

and Prashant Deshpande (son of Congress leader R.V. Deshpande). With Shah Rukh 

Khans birthday beginning from the midnight hour, the gala was as big as 

it gets.

At the stroke of 12, Shah Rukhs birthday was 

announced by Karan Johar, of course. The superstar was then flooded with 41 gifts 

from Forum 11 a club of Mumbais 11 top ladies led by Nita to mark his 

41st birthday.

Shah Rukh, looking hot in a flaming red shirt, soon 

took to the dance floor, recreating his Khaike paan Benaraswala moves.

The Sea Wind poolside had been transformed into a 

spectacular set in shades of shocking pink, orange and black by designer 

Tarun Tahiliani. And the pool was covered to set up a stage that played host to 

a fashion theatre and a dance performance.

The guest list starred Sachin Tendulkar and Anjali, 

Karisma Kapoor and Sunjay, Shilpa Shetty, Yash Chopra, Farhan Akhtar, Karan Johar, 

Simi Garewal, Subhash Ghai, Chunky Pandey, Riteish Deshmukh... the Birlas, the 

Godrejs, Vijay Mallya, Uddhav and Rashmi Thackeray. 

The evening emceed by Juhi Chawla started with a fashion 

extravaganza that combined Taruns ensembles with Calcutta designer Raj Mahtanis 

jewels. When Nita had come to Calcutta in June she had spent the whole 

afternoon at Mahtanis Satramdas Dhalamal store on Park Street.

The breathtaking laser show saw 22 of 

the countrys top models Carol Gracias, Noyonika Chatterjee, Vidisha Pavate, 

Sheetal Malhar, Dipannita Sharma, Sampada, Krishna Somani, Tupur Chatterjee among 

others showcasing the designs.

This was no ordinary fashion show, I would call 

it a fashion theatre, Tarun told GoodLife. It was a couture 

evening and the clothes were in jewel colours, mostly pinks and oranges.

The models were draped in diamonds and emeralds. The 

look was apsara like and I dressed up the girls with head-to-toe jewellery 

from my winter couture line, revealed Raj.

White and black were the chosen colours for the night. 

The fashion theatre was followed by a dance show organised by Juhi, before her 

favourite heros birthday cake was cut. And the crowd kept grooving to DJ 

Aqeels music, including a few SRK hits, till about 3 in the morning.

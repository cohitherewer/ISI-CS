 Italy is a mosaic of lively, vibrant colours that cascade into forms of breathtaking beauty. Verdant green and burnt sienna, mellow ochre and golden chrome, sparkling red and soft amber, merge into drowsy Tuscan forms of buildings and landscapes that fascinate and captivate the imagination by virtue of their raw sensuousness. The Colours of Italy, the ongoing exhibition of watercolours by Sipra Dattagupta, evokes the charm and splendour of that country in a style reminiscent of Paul Klee and the Impressionists. In most of her paintings, colours have flown lyrically into forms, often without a structured pencil drawing underneath the coat of paint. Depicting picturesque scenes of farms strewn with vineyards, cypress trees and fields of ripe poppies, her canvases are a riot of colours that eloquently speak of nature?s bounty. Compositions with angel windows, stone balconies, arched columns and bridges pay tribute to the marvels of Italian architecture. Images of grottos, emerald caves, fishing villages and peasant life add character to her impressions of Italy.

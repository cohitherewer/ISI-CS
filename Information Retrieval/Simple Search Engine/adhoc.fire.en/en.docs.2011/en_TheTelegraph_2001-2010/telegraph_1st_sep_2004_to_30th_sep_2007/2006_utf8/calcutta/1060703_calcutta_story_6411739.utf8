The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rush for B-school course

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Institute of Management, Calcutta (IIMC), is set to kick-off its Postgraduate Programme for Executives by December 1, but an overwhelming response to the course has prompted the B-school to extend the deadline for accepting applications from June 30 to July 14.

 While IIMC has been receiving applications from across the globe, Calcutta is not lagging behind, either.

 ?People from the city have responded well. Although it would be hard to say how many applications have come from Calcutta alone, since the admissions process is still on, but it hasn?t been any different from any other city,? said B.B. Chakraborti, chairman of the programme.

 Industry, too, isn?t surprised by the development.

 ?One must take into account the fact that Calcutta is trying to position itself as a viable and attractive destination for business on a global scale,? said Rathin Datta, chairman and CEO, PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 ?Gone are the days of a professional rising through the ranks on the basis of experience only. Corporate organisations are looking at professionals who have a trans-national outlook, and who can provide the edge that an organisation requires to stay ahead in the race,? he added.

 Bhaskar Roy, vice-president, TCG, said the programme costs should not be a factor for Calcutta applicants. ?The business scenario in the city is opening up. Since the programme is aimed at people with at least five years? full-time work experience, funding should not be a problem. There is a risk factor, but it would be a calculated one, as the IIMC stamp will ensure a steady rise up the corporate ladder,? pointed out Roy.

 ?The programme will cater to a global audience. The emphasis is on learning in a cross-cultural environment, developing leadership, team-building and communication skills. The response has been great,? said Sushil Khanna, chairman, management development programmes, IIMC.

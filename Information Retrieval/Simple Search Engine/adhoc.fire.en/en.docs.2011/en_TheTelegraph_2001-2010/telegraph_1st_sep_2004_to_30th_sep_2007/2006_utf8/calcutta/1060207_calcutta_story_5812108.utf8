 Big band sound from Germany, a leading exponent of jazz in this country and an ace Bollywood choreographer. Varied elements are coming together to present a ?melange of music, song and dance? at Kala Mandir on Tuesday.

 Golden Footprints ? A Musical Journey, features 12 premier musicians from Germany, composer and keyboardist Louiz Banks and choreographer Terence Lewis in a one-and-a-half-hour performance that draws from earliest of jazz sounds to the latest Bollywood hits.

 ?It?s a coming together of three forces. The band from Germany has a bunch of superlative musicians and I?ve been a great fan of Terence,? said Banks.

 The Calcutta performance is one of three ? Mumbai was the first and Bangalore follows ? for the ensemble, as a part of IT major Siemens?s 50 years of manufacturing in India celebrations.

 Besides original compositions by Banks, including Be Bop Raag, Dabbawallahs (a tribute to the dabbawallahs of Mumbai) and Doors of Desire, the show will feature early 20th Century jazz standards like Jumping at the Woodside, In the Mood and All that Jazz.

 ?We also thought of making it a full circle and included our interpretations of Bollywood hits like Dil Chahta Hai,? Banks added.

 ?The Mumbai crowd was completely bowled over by the audio-visual treat,? said Lewis, whose stint in Bollywood includes work in Lagaan and Naach. ?The compositions were recorded and sent to me a while back. It was exciting and challenging because not many ask for choreography on such classical pieces. I?ve tried to blend elements of contemporary, classical, Broadway and of course, Bollywood dance forms,? Lewis added.

 For the troupe from Germany, it is an exciting and novel project. ?Our band features some of the best artistes from Germany and it is a great experience playing with Louiz Banks and his musicians,? said Eberhard Stockmann, leader of the 12-member German group and a saxophone player. ?It?s also fun to reinterpret old Hindi songs like Ina Meena Dika.?

 For most of the German delegates, it?s their maiden visit to Calcutta, while for Stockmann, it?s his fifth. ?But it will be the first time that I?ll play music here,? smiled the artiste from Erlangen.

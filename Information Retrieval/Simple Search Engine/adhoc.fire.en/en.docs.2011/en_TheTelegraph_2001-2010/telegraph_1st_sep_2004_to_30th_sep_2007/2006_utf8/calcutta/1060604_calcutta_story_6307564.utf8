The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Headed just for Germany

 Calcuttans are willing to pay a price for their passion to get as close to the World Cup action as possible

 Calcuttans are willing to pay a price for their passion to get as close to the World Cup action as possible

 The Singhs of Ballygunge were eager to watch at least a few of the football World Cup 2006 matches in Germany. Having made their travel arrangements, they turned their attention to the match tickets. But that proved harder to get than they?d thought. So the couple rushed off to the UK, where they?ve now parked themselves in the hope of grabbing their dream tickets. Whatever be the price of their passion, more than a handful of Calcutta?s football fanatics are making a beeline for German stadiums, to get up close with the Ronaldinhos and Beckhams this June.

 Deepankar Nandi is an avid football fan. Having already been to two previous World Cup venues, this one he wasn?t willing to miss. ?I worked in Nigeria for many years, where I was involved with the national team, including the first time they qualified for the Cup in 1994. I even watched Maradona in his last match. This time, too, I had made up my mind to go. A friend and me are going together,? says the managing member of CC amp;FC. 

 But the match tickets proved much harder to get than the air tickets. ?It took about two-three months of planning. I have tickets to four matches, including one quarter-final, through various sources, from the Internet to the Qatar Football Federation and the All India Football Association. I?m trying to get tickets for a fifth match,? adds Nandi.

 CC amp;FC vice-president Noomi Mehta, however, found a far simpler route ? ?I took the Emirates offer?. Being the official World Cup airline, Emirates is offering packages to Germany, from travel to stay and match tickets. ?Getting tickets for the games now is very expensive and difficult. The Emirates package includes the tickets and costs around Rs 1.5 lakh per person, so it was convenient. It was a dream package, and I didn?t have to do any running around,? explains the Selvel man.

 It all came about because of 24-year-old son Jahan, who plays professional soccer. ?He is very excited. We?ve got three match tickets, including Brazil, Argentina and France games. We were given a few choices, and we chose these ones.? 

 Leisure Sports Management has been organising package tours to the World Cup since 1982. ?We haven?t missed one since then, and we have some clients who have been with us from the beginning,? says managing director Benu Dasgupta. This year, around 80 people have booked through the company, with 55-60 from Calcutta, adds Sunando Dhar of Leisure Sports Management. There are three packages, with pre-quarterfinal, quarterfinal, semi-final and final match tickets, ranging from Rs 90,000 to Rs 1.4 lakh per person. ?The age group is around 40-plus to 70-plus, mostly men, but there are also a few couples. Some of them have been to previous Cups, others are first-timers. This country may be cricket crazy, but the football World Cup is a whole different ball game,? adds Dhar.

 Smoke it in style

 Shradha Agarwal 

 The party-going Calcuttan is just 

 about getting used to lighting up the cigar. A cigar in 

 one hand and a single malt in other is emerging as the style 

 statement of the night.

 With most city bars and nightclubs recording a 25 per cent spurt in cigar sales in the past year, this sure is one fiery fad.

 The basic structure of a cigar ? outside wrapper in the form of tobacco leaf, an inside wrapper of a thinner version of the same leaf and finally the filler in the form of fine, shredded tobacco ? and the best brands in the world could all go up in smoke with the wrong cigar moves. 

 You could buy the best cigars, but smoking it right and that too in style is something that just have to learn yourself.

 Ditto for specialised cigar cutting, lighting and enjoying.

 Heres the GoodLife guide to the smooth cigar experience.

 Do

 Cut it properly with care because the cutting will determine the smoothness of your cigar.

 Ask for a cigar-cutter from the barman. Be careful to cut it properly without damaging the structure of the cigar, warns Anirban Simlai, F amp;B manager at The Park.

 Light it right using a 

 special, long matchstick. Never use a gas lighter to light 

 a cigar.

 The original aroma is bound to diminish with the lighters gas smell. Instead, use a wooden matchstick or a special butane lighter, says Sovan Mukherjee, manager at hookah bar Shisha. 

 Simlai warns that a cigar must not be lit like the wick of a candle. You must roast it on the flame, not allowing it to burn but patiently wait for the layers to get a little roasted, Simlai explains. 

 Combine your cigar with 

 a great single malt in an old-fashioned glass.

 Simlais recommended proportion is one sip of the malt and then two drags of the cigar.

 Yuvraj Johar, executive assistant manager, F amp;B Taj Bengal, also prescribes staying clear of chilled beer as that tends to numb the palette.

 Warmer drinks like single malts or cognac accentuates the flavours of a cigar, explains Yuvraj.

 The drag and puff could 

 make or mar your cigar smoking experience. Cut it 

 small for a small draw if youre just beginning out, 

 suggests Yuvraj. A long draw is not recommended for beginners.

 Dont

 Rush things. Patience 

 is the key word for a connoisseurs cigar experience. 

 Enjoy a cigar slowly; it is not meant to be smoked 

 like a cigarette, says Sovan. 

 Share your cigar (and 

 no, we arent referring to Bill Clinton here). Though 

 two or three drinking buddies sharing a cigar is a common 

 sight these days, it is best to keep the cigar to yourself. 

 Tip off the cigar ash. It will loose its tightness. Wait for the ash to fall off on its own, says Yuvraj.

 Stub out a cigar. If youre done, just let it be till it goes out on its own. Then simply keep it back in your cigar case, but try and finish it the same day, offers Yuvraj. 

 Allow any contact with 

 water. Especially drinking water is a big no-no, 

 warns Simlai.

 Store it for too long, because the cigars flavour mellows with time.

 Always check for the warranty 

 seal for the date details before buying a cigar from any 

 nightclub.

 Inhale ? just roll it 

 in your mouth and enjoy.

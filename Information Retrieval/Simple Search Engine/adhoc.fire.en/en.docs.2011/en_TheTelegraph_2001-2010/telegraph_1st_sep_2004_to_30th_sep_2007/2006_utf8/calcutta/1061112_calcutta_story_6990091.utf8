 Cover-up code

 Pre-show policing, on-ramp rules... 

 Smita Roy Chowdhury on the war against wardrobe malfunction, 

 measure for prudish measure Pictures by PTI and Gajanan Dudhalkar

Two 

 international stylists, 28 dos and donts, dozens of silicone 

 bras and nipple tapes tools that put paid to all those 

 waiting for a peekaboo at the recently-concluded Lakme Fashion 

 Week (LFW) in Mumbai.

 With the moral police glued to 

 the models contours for the first hint of a slip, the fashion 

 week organisers had a tough task on their hands of ensuring 

 more than 25 shows went without a wardrobe malfunction.

 And the LFW organisers did manage 

 to do that quite successfully. All that oglers could catch 

 was a fleeting glimpse of model Sucheta Sharmas silicone 

 bra as her dress shifted during designer Seema Khans show. 

 The rebel fashion week in Mumbai 

 had created quite a stir from ramp to Assembly House 

 during its debut edition in March-April, when the nation 

 was riveted to recorded glimpses of model Carol Graciass 

 halter blouse slipping off to reveal her breasts at designer 

 Bennu Sehgalls showing (picture by Pabitra Das).

 The very next day, Gauhar Khans 

 skirt zip gave way to reveal her bare bottom, at a Lascelles 

 Symons show. Wardrobe malfunction had shown it all well, 

 almost and became the password for fashion shows in India.

 For weeks, images of Carols flash 

 of flesh was everywhere in print, on TV, on mobile phones 

 and the Internet. So this time, LFW, drawing more curious 

 eyeballs for the repeat of a malfunction drama than for 

 the designer showings themselves, was determined not to 

 let a slip spoil the show.

 Behind 

 the scenes

 For a start, the two protagonists 

 of last times malfunction designer Bennu and model Carol 

 were nowhere to be seen.

 The LFW advisory board then drew 

 up a 28-point guideline for models, designers and choreographers. 

 While the thrust of the rules was on stricter fittings schedules, 

 it was also mandatory for all models to wear nipple tapes 

 and bikini bras or silicone bras (as the outfit would demand) 

 for every show.

 We were made to sign a contract 

 that, among other rules, stated that we have to wear nipple 

 tapes and proper undergarments at all shows, irrespective 

 of whether the clothes were revealing, sheer or not, reveals 

 model Shonal Rawat.

 The fittings sessions spread over 

 four days preceding the fashion week were held under the 

 strict supervision of stylists Philip Scurrah and Kelvin 

 Harries, specially flown in from Australia to ensure international 

 standards. After the mishaps at the last fashion week, 

 the LFW advisory board took into consideration the possible 

 stages where things can go wrong. We found that the backstage 

 proceedings are so rushed that it is not possible to impose 

 any checks there. So the strictures needed to be implemented 

 at the fittings sessions, says Anil Chopra, vice-president, 

 Lakme Lever.

 The strict sessions required 

 each garment to be checked by the stylists for finish and 

 fasteners and two-three rounds of fittings. The model who 

 would be sporting it at the show was made to walk in the 

 outfit and this was photographed to rule out last-minute 

 changes. We had mini shows at every fittings session, 

 adds Chopra.

 Everybody 

 says its fine

 No ones complaining about the 

 cover-up. Not about the stern pre-show rules, not against 

 the on-ramp safety measures made mandatory here for the 

 first time ever. For models the precautions ensured safeguards 

 against nasty stares and frenzied fallout, while designers 

 got away with minor slips (think Seema Khans show).

 The fashion week went off without 

 any slips on the ramp because the organisers had ensured 

 enough precautions, says model Tupur Chatterjee. The silicone 

 bras and nipple tapes were not uncomfortable, she stresses. 

 I would never walk the ramp in something I am not comfortable 

 in. Whatever we were made to wear did not cause any discomfort. 

 In fact, I felt more confident and comfortable with such 

 measures that can help avoid embarrassing situations on 

 the ramp.

 City girl Shonal echoes: In the 

 beginning it did feel a little awkward to wear stuff like 

 nipple tapes, but then we got used to it. And when the girls 

 realised that it was done to safeguard their interests, 

 no one complained.

 The designer brigade, too, has 

 welcomed the moves, measure for prudish measure. Says designer 

 Narendra Kumar: In India, we are not in the business of 

 selling nipples and skin. The fashion week atmosphere was 

 very clean; the stylists did a commendable job and none 

 of the designers or models had any problems.

 Adds designer Payal Singhal: Though 

 the outfits in my collection had proper lining and hence 

 didnt demand nipple tapes, I would still welcome the move. 

 Like in the case of Sucheta Sharma, a malfunction was averted 

 just because of the undergarment. Also, silicone bras dont 

 affect the shape or structure of the outfits and hence theres 

 no reason why any designer should object to them.

 Officialspeak sums it up. Many 

 designers and models are saying that this should be a standard 

 at all fashion shows across the country, smiles Chopra, 

 the Lakme man.

 Dream 

 global, act local

 While our designers and models 

 have readily agreed to the no-show diktat, are such tools 

 common at international fashion weeks, too? No with a capital 

 N. I have never come across models using nipple tapes and 

 silicone bras anywhere else in the world, says Philip, 

 who has been associated with fashion weeks in New York, 

 London, Milan, Paris, Australia and New Zealand for over 

 a decade now.

 Says Shonal: I have walked the 

 ramp abroad and seen girls walking about wearing next to 

 nothing. So, silicone bras and nipple tapes are out of the 

 question there.

 So while India is taking giant 

 strides in the world fashion arena, arent these orthodox 

 measures a setback for the global image of our desi design 

 industry? With our designers wowing the West and our models 

 walking the international ramp, isnt this a case of taking 

 one step forward and three steps back?

 The industry does not seem to 

 think so. Reasons Philip: The culture in India is very 

 different from anywhere else in the world. On the international 

 catwalk, it is not considered outrageous or embarrassing 

 if a mistake or malfunction happens. But here people react 

 very strongly. So, such measures are necessary here.

 Kelvin elaborates: How much skin 

 can be shown on the ramp differs from country to country. 

 India being a conservative society, one has to be respectful 

 of audience sensitivity. Hence we advised the girls to wear 

 the required undergarments and they were very supportive. 

 After all, they are more concerned about protecting themselves 

 than anyone else.

 The contradiction of such a audience 

 sensitivity in the land of Khajuraho and Kamasutra is, 

 of course, quite another matter.

 Shonal points out how, stripped 

 of everything else, it boils down to the people and their 

 perception of fashion. Abroad, the audience sees a model 

 as a mannequin for a garment; the models body is not important. 

 But here, people ogle at a models body, often more than 

 the garment.

 Calcutta 

 call

 Anyone sitting through a fashion 

 show in Calcutta knows precisely what Shonal is talking 

 about. At the recent Manish Malhotra show, his entire collection 

 was overshadowed by the (s)excitement generated by the swimwear 

 that too through sheers round, thanks to the army of 

 salivating men.

 But chances of Calcutta borrowing 

 the Mumbai norms are remote. Primarily because western 

 wear shows in Calcutta are rare and then too designers make 

 it a point not to show more than cleavage, says event manager 

 Sanchita Kushary Bose.

 Adds city model Sanjukta Das: 

 No organiser or designer in Calcutta has asked me to wear 

 a silicone bra or nipple tape. But I prefer wearing silicones, 

 since a malfunction can happen anytime, anywhere.

 Maybe not, if the cover-up code 

 stays in place.

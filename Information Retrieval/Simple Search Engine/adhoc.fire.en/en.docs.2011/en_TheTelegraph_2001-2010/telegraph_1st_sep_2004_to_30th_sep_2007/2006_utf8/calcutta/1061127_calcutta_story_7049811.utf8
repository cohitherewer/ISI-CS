 Transcending space

 Photography is truth Jean Luc Godard. Lensmen capture the essence of truth and beauty inherent in nature all manifestations of our Creators great love for us. They are artists who help us view Gods creation from a new angle and often re-create unique images from ordinary objects lying around us. Chhayapaths 11th Interntional Salon of Photography, where lensmen from 27 countries are participating and 126 of their works are currently on display, is a testimony to this. It is amazing how the photographers have captured an astonishing variety of human emotions, from the sacred to the profane, in myriad moods, in their cameras. What really strikes the viewer is the participants keen sense of composition and a deep empathy with their subjects that transcend both time and spatial barriers. The tonal quality of the photographs add to their visual richness. Featured above, Greek lensman Dimitrios G. Markoglous portrayal of Madame Rosa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Old curiosity 

 shop

 NASEERUDDIN SHAH dons 

 the shadowy role of an old curio shop owner in Sunglass, 

 a Rituparno Ghosh film being produced by Planman Motion 

 Pictures.

 He plays a brief but significant 

 part in the film, lending a twist to the tale by handing 

 over a pair of magical sunglasses to Konkona Sen Sharma.

 On Monday, the first floor of 

 Chhatu Babu Latu Babus house on Beadon Street appeared 

 quixotic with its jumble of bricabrac strewn on two wooden 

 tables and the floor a pile of books, a brass telescope, 

 an old grandfather clock, Oriental antiques in wood, dismantled 

 glass lamps, an old telephone, a Samurai sword, an ancient 

 globe, an assortment of laboratory equipment

 And in the middle of it all, Naseeruddin 

 looking old and scruffy almost a fast forward from Kaizad 

 Gustads Bombay Boys as he hosts Konkona, who comes 

 looking for a pair of binoculars.

 Surrounded by an eclectic collection 

 of curios, the veteran actor spoke briefly on:

 The cameo in Sunglass

 I stand at such a point in my 

 career where Im not being choosy about my roles. I believe 

 in projects that will be fun to do and work with people 

 who enjoy a real passion for cinema. Whats important is 

 to do a role regardless of what capacity we are in.

 Konkona Sen Sharma

 I havent seen too many of her 

 previous works but of whatever I have seen of her performance, 

 Im just full of admiration for her. I havent seen an Indian 

 actress with such spirit and talent in a long time. I would 

 surely define her as one of the finest actresses today.

 Rituparnos London 

 Summer

 The film will be shot in London 

 but Im not yet sure of Shabana (Azmi) or my exact role 

 in the film. I have knowledge on the skeleton of the story 

 and am willing to play any part in the film as long as I 

 can ease the task of the film-maker because I believe that 

 a film always depends on the goodwill of all the people 

 involved. Im looking forward to it and just hope that he 

 (Rituparno) doesnt drop me at the last minute (laughs)!

 His next directorial venture

 Im not in a hurry to make a film 

 right now, even though Im very happy with what I have achieved 

 with my first film (Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota).

 Doing theatre in Calcutta

 I love doing theatre and have 

 been staging five short stories by playwrights like Munshi 

 Premchand and others in the recent past. I really wonder 

 why I havent been invited to the Calcutta stage for almost 

 five years. Previously it was more high profile and meant 

 for select audience with high-priced tickets but things 

 are different now and one can reach out to more people. 

 Calcuttas theatre audience has 

 always been very stimulating and I really hope that theatre 

 workers will invite me to be a part of theatrical performances 

 and workshops in the city.

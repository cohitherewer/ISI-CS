 Precious pieces 

 from period drama

 TITHI SARKAR

 STONE 

 SPLASH

 Aishwarya and (above) 

 Abhishek in Umrao Jaan 

 You couldnt have missed 

 the long diamond, ruby and emerald strands encircling Aishwarya 

 Rais neck or the diamond and emerald rings adorning 

 Abhishek Bachchans fingers in Umrao Jaan. And 

 now, you can get a chance to splurge on or at least stare 

 at these jewels as they are unveiled at the Taj Bengal 

 on Friday-Saturday.

 From designer Anna Singhs 

 flowing yards to the stone stunners on leading lady Aishwarya, 

 the entire look of Umrao Jaan exudes an old-world 

 charm. Though the film is hardly being heard of, post-release, 

 the opulent period look has been a talking point.

 And bringing the regal pieces 

 to Calcutta is Jaipur-based Golchas Jewels, which 

 designed the entire jewellery for the J.P. Dutta film.

 Fashion Quotient is what the wedding 

 exhibition providing glimpses of the precious Ash-Abhishek-Shabana 

 jewellery is called.

 Bindiya Goswami, the film-makers 

 wife, had got in touch with Vijay and Sandeep of Golchas 

 Jewels for Umrao Jaan. Our designs fitted the 

 bill perfectly. The Mughal look that they wanted was very 

 similar to our creations and perhaps thats why they 

 preferred us, an excited Vijay tells GoodLife.

 There was equal emphasis 

 on both heavy and light jewellery. While the dances required 

 heavy pieces, the other scenes had lesser or very light 

 jewellery, points out Vijay. 

 Uncut diamonds, tourmalines, firoza, 

 rubies, south pearls and emeralds have been set in gold 

 for the various creations used in the film. Chokers, long 

 neckpieces, navratna necklaces, long earrings, rani 

 haar, maang tika, finger rings, payals 

 and kurta buttons comprise most of the ornaments. There 

 is also a lot of exquisite minakari work that we 

 have done on the pieces, he adds.

 Bindiya Goswami and Anna Singh 

 acted as guides through the whole process.

 One particular ornament that Shabana 

 Azmi sported in Umrao Jaan is a favourite with the 

 designer duo. It is a choker with rubies, emerald 

 carving and rose-cut Golconda diamonds, reveals Vijay. 

 Another favourite is Abhisheks set of three finger 

 rings.

 Everybody from J.P. Dutta 

 to Abhishek Bachchan and Shabana Azmi to Aishwarya Rai and 

 Ayesha Jhulka was very pleased with the jewellery. Shabanaji 

 liked the designs so much that she bought a few pieces after 

 the shooting was over, reveals Vijay. 

 Though Umrao Jaan was the 

 Golchas first brush with a Bollywood movie, they are 

 definitely not new to the industry. Their client list boasts 

 big tinsel town names like Sridevi, Raveena Tandon, Kirron 

 Kher and, of course, Shabana. We had also designed 

 Raveenas wedding jewellery, says Vijay.

 Vijay and Sandeep are now reaping 

 rich rewards for a decades dedication to a passion 

 and profession. Their speciality lies in the antique look 

 and most of their designs are set in gold. While there are 

 pieces starting from Rs 10,000, the price tag can read in 

 crores for larger items.

 After Umrao Jaan, Golchas 

 Jewels has received film offers from other Bollywood biggies, 

 including a UTV production that had to be refused for paucity 

 of time.

 Designing for a film is 

 a full-time commitment; its a large investment and 

 requires maintaining an inventory for the whole period of 

 shooting, says Vijay. But there will be other 

 bigger offers, Im sure.

 For now, its all about our 

 city and their sparkle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 That sinking feeling

 Director Wolfgang Peterson and leading man Josh Lucas speak about the on-the-sets action of and the on-the-screen reaction to Poseidon

 Josh Lucas, Emmy Rossum and Kurt Russell in a moment from Poseidon, releasing on Friday

 One of the more anticipated big-screen adventures this summer hits city theatres on Friday. And Poseidon has many things going for it, starting with director Wolfgang Petersen (Troy, The Perfect Storm) and leading man Josh Lucas (Hulk, Stealth). The two spoke about their latest blockbuster movie.

 WOLFGANG 

 PETERSEN 

 On the story: A group of 

 about 10 people, get together under the-the leadership of 

 Josh Lucas, the poker player. He is basically more out to 

 rescue himself alone, but the group sort of clings to him, 

 and wants to follow him because he seems to have some knowledge 

 how to get out. So, this group starts the journey up out 

 of the ship, hopefully. 

 And as you can imagine, this journey is a tough one. It?s really so scary that it?s like marching right into hell. And we all want to see, what would you and me do? Not what would, let?s say Tom Cruise, do here? That?s a different movie. We want to see what we are doing. Our heroes among ourselves... 

 On the theme: It?s about 

 drowning, potentially. It?s about claustrophobia. It?s about 

 primal fear in all its forms. And people are not used to 

 it, and not trained for it, and so they learn as they go. 

 For an audience, to be in the safety of their theatre seats, 

 to go through an unbelievable, shocking, scary disaster 

 situation is just fun. Because I think we all need it. We 

 want to go through these situations. 

 Josh 

 Lucas

 On the film: The first 

 chunk of the movie is the Gone With The Wind bygone 

 era of Hollywood film-making. You have these massive set 

 pieces and this playful, wild party really, that?s going 

 on for the first 20 minutes of the film. I remember coming 

 to work one day, and saying, ?I?m just having the time of 

 my life.? And I knew in the back of my mind and I kept saying 

 to people, ?It?s going to change. It?s going to get hard.?

 On the physical toil: What 

 was so extraordinary from a physical standpoint of this 

 movie was that this is not a CGI movie. This is a movie 

 where you are, literally, inside of a boat that is sinking. 

 There?s a lot of times in this movie where I felt like we 

 weren?t acting, we were reacting. You weren?t necessarily 

 having to put something on. Because you were in a situation 

 where there was a wind machine blowing a hundred miles an 

 hour at you and there?s water blasting at you and fire, 

 and all the different elements... If anything, kind of on 

 a daily basis, you walked away from it thinking, ?I?m very 

 happy I survived that day intact.?

 On the stunts: A big, massive 

 pool of water is on fire and my character, of a last second 

 realisation, decides to jump into the pool, swim under the 

 fire with a fire hose, and crawl up the wall in order to 

 connect the two. He would basically do what would be a slide 

 for life to connect the two groups.When they came to me, 

 sort of madly I said: ?I want to do that. I really would 

 love to be able to figure out a way to shoot so that you?re 

 not using a stunt person.? 

 And stupidly I would go home after work, after being in water all day long, and literally, hold my breath for as long I possibly could, and swim back and forth underneath the water of my pool, hoping that eventually I could convince them to let me swim under this fire.

 Thai Airways is set to start the second daily service between Calcutta and Bangkok early next year. Indian airline currently operates a daily service between the city and the Thai capital.

 We will have daily return flights from Calcutta to Bangkok by next March, S.C. Kapur, district sales manager (Eastern India) of Thai Airways, told Metro.

 The airline currently operates daily flights to Southeast Asian destinations from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. From Calcutta, it operates five flights a week to Bangkok. Singapore Airlines has four flights a week to Southeast Asia from the city.

 The current price of an economy class ticket for the Bangkok roundtrip on Thai Airways is Rs 8,000 (excluding tax). An economy class roundtrip to Singapore costs Rs 14,500 (excluding tax) on the airline.

 The airline will also start operations from Hyderabad in October, stated Kapur. There will be three flights a week between Hyderabad and Bangkok from October 31.

 Bangkok is always in demand. It is the most popular tourist destination outside the country from Calcutta, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (East), Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 Earlier this year, Malaysia Airlines and Jetstar Asia, a low-cost carrier to Southeast Asia, stopped operations from Calcutta. Low passenger load and funds crunch were the reasons cited.

 According to Kapur, till mid-June this year, Thai Airways had recorded a load factor of 90 per cent. The figure went down in July, but is likely to climb up before the Pujas. We will have a 100 per cent load factor between September-end and middle of October, asserted an airline official. 

 Indian is also planning to expand operations to Southeast Asia, said an official of the airline. It already operates daily flights to Bangkok from Calcutta.

 The number of seats to Europe from Calcutta is also set to go up, with Lufthansa announcing the launch of Calcutta-Frankfurt flights three days a week. The frequency will later be increased to daily flights. Nepal Airlines also plans to restart operations from the city later this year.

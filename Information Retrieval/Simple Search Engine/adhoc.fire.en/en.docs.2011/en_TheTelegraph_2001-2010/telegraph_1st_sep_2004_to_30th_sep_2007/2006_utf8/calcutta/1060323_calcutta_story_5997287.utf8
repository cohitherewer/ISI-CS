 What: 

 Special AbLabs Programme.

 Where: Golds Gym 

 at 57, JL Nehru Road, fifth floor.

 Take a look: The gym, in association with fitness guru Chinmoy Roy, has come up with a programme to address the problem of acute stress in everyday life, often a cause for backache, spinal problems and the like.

 The programme caters to the core ? the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex, the thoracic and cervical spine.

 The programme highlights integrated core stabilisation. If the core is unstable and does not remain a solid foundation throughout movement, it will not allow optimal force reduction, production and transference to occur throughout the kinetic chain, explains Roy.

 The regimen with a scientific approach is being monitored by Roy, who is a Sports Authority of India (SAI)-certified trainer along with fitness manager John Gomes and trainer Sanjib Das.

 The exercise session includes a gradual progression from simple to complex exercises, all in sync with our day-to-day functional activities. The exercises also help you improve your posture, adds Roy.

 The programme also caters to matters abdominal. Preliminary tests are carried out to detect the amount of calorie to be lost, existing core problems and more. Each session is accompanied by music. There are 12 sessions to be attended a month.

 Pocket pinch: A monthly 

 course costs Rs 1,500.

 Voiceover: It is 

 a solution for problems linked to sedentary lifestyles and 

 rising stress levels at the work place. The programme is 

 customised to take into account different professional idiosyncrasies 

 and suit the varied needs of every one, smiles Divya 

 Himatsingka, director, Golds Gym.

 What: Spring Festival ? an exhibition of wearables, jewellery and home accessories.

 Where: Soumyas Creation, the boutique at 57/9, Ballygunge Circular Road.

 Take a look: Among wearables, there is a whole range of saris and salwar suit materials in chiffons and georgettes to pick from. The colours vary from pastel shades for daywear to deeper shades for evening wear.

 so available are light mulberry silks in pashmina prints, a selection of dupion silks and crepes.

 Chanderi dupattas reflecting the vibrant colours of the season are a steal. Also on offer are vegetable-dyed T-shirts, tailored western wear in cotton and silk, printed and embroidered kurta lengths.

 The jewellery on offer includes Swarovski crystals and summer beads with silver. There is also a small but exquisite collection of Thewa jewellery that includes some grand neckpieces.

 Kathak creations

 Innovation and experimentation without losing sight of tradition have always been the hallmark of the creations of Padatik Dance Centre. Celebration 06, a presentation by its repertory, offers a combination of several items in a range of styles based on Kathak and some innovative forms firmly founded on Kathak training and sensibilities. It begins with Swa Chhanda, conceived as a series of solo dances and woven together in rhythm with talas of pure Kathak. Sufi Music is based on four sufi songs with remixed background scores, expressing the romantic ethos and spirituality of Sufism. Rhythm Scape is a duet recital blending contemporary and Kathak styles. A fusion of Flamenco and Kathak, Oscar Lopez is rich in emotion, exploring common elements between the two classical forms. The concluding items, based on Shakti Chattopadhyays poems, are compositions that incorporate acrobatics, rope-work and balancing, along with space design. Choreography: Chetna Jalan.

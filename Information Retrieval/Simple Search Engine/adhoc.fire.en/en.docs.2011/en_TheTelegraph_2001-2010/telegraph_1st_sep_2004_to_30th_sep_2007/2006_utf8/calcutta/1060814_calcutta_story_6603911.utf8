The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week 

 without

 Celebrating your freedom

 Take 

 a long overdue weekend holiday to rekindle the romance or 

 spend time painting flags with the kids, indoors. This I-Day 

 is all about sharing your I time with your loved 

 ones. The singletons, on the other hand, can take full advantage 

 of their independence by doing exactly what pleases them 

 staying indoors with popcorn, chocolates and back-to-back 

 movies or getting their fill of mid-month shopping. Also, 

 plan a peppy desi party with tricolour drinks, eats, 

 outfits... the works.

 Catching up on filmi fashion 

 Some will watch it for Sexy Sam Amitabh Bachchan. Some for 

 Sexy Son Abhishek. Some will go for the sheer grandeur of 

 a Karan Johar movie and for some, the leading ladies will 

 do the trick. Whatever your reason for watching Kabhi 

 Alvida Naa Kehna might be, dont forget to soak 

 in the fashion quotient as you get blown away by Manish 

 Malhotras magical drapes all over again. Sir or miss, 

 if nothing else, your style statement is definitely bound 

 to crank up after you watch KANK.

 Feasting your eyes at midnight

 Get your fill of fashion this week as you feast your eyes 

 on some haute statements in cool whites and beiges by none 

 other than design doyen Ritu Kumar. The ace designer will 

 showcase her pret collection under LABEL on the Tantra bartop 

 at Friday midnight as part of the Fashion Police series. 

 Now this is one show you just cannot afford to miss. And 

 going by the list of ramp scorchers who will burn the bartop 

 Deepika Padukone, Shruti Agarwal, Jesse Randhawa, Sohini 

 Jaitley, Amanpreet Wahi, Krishna Somani and Tina Chatwal 

 your husband/boyfriend wont need much convincing 

 to accompany you.

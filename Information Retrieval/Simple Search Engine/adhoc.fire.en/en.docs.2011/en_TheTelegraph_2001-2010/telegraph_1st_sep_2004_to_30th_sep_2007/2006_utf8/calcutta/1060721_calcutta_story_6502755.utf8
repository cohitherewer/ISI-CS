 An enchanting, traditional, operatic theatre of coastal Karnataka, Yakshagana (southern style) originated seven centuries ago as an art form and was initially enacted by male performers in night-long shows. Now adapted to various lengths and new types of expressions, it has nevertheless retained its quality of weaving music, dance, language, movement, costume and stage-craft into a composite dramatic design. Based on stories (prasangas) from classical and mythological sources like Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita, its verses are sung to the accompaniment of an orchestra of drums and gongs. The actors dance to the music and deliver speeches that are extempore and highly improvised. Yaksha Manjusha, this evening?s performance by renowned artistes of All India Radio, Mangalore, is part of an ongoing effort to present Yakshagana in an abridged form, through ballets and mono-acting performances. It is being performed in Hindi for north Indian audiences. Direction: Vidya Kolyur. Presented in collaboration with Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre.

 Event: Yaksha Manjusha, an operatic folk theatre in Hindi 

When: Today at 6 pm

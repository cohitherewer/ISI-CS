 Safed Haathi lost in transit, agency fined

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state consumer forum has slapped a fine on a city-based travel agency for misplacing a cassette of a popular children?s film, Safed Haathi, which it was to deliver to a broadcasting company in Belgrade.

 The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has asked National Travel Service to pay a compensation of Rs 75,000 and $240 to Gauranga Films, which had produced Safed Haathi.

 In 1998, Gauranga Films got an offer to broadcast the film, written and directed by Tapan Sinha, on a television channel in Belgrade.

 The producer sent the film?s cassette in a parcel to the travel agency, for dispatching it to Belgrade. But the cassette did not reach the consignee.

 In June 1999, following several letters from the producer, the agency announced that the cassette had been misplaced in Paris, where it was kept in the warehouse of an international airline.

 ?The consignment not having been delivered and lost track of midway, stated to be at Paris, and then finally never to be retrieved and delivered to the addressee was not immediately notified to the complainant and after many letters and telephone calls, the clear position was brought to the complainant?s notice, though no compensation was offered and paid...,? the members of the forum observed in their judgment.

 ?The cassette, booked for Belgrade with freight prepaid, was never delivered and the fact of its non-delivery or the status in transit not brought to notice of the complainant within reasonable time... not offering or paying due damages is deemed to be an act of neglect and grave deficiency of service,? they observed.

 Lawyers representing Gauranga Films argued that their client had suffered huge losses by not being able to send the cassette to the broadcaster and also lost an opportunity to sell the film across the globe.

 The agency?s lawyers said they were considering moving an appeal with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. ?There is a legal lacuna. The claim is barred by law of limitation, as it was filed two years after the consignment was sent,? said Chandranath Mukherjee, lawyer of National Travel Service.

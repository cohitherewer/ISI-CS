 Money works when you don?t

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 As soon as I saw the ad on TV, I knew it was worth writing about. And I know my age is the main culprit for making me take such a hasty decision. There is this HDFC Standard Life Insurance Pension Plan ad about a kid, his father and his grandfather. The kid drags his grandpa to a shop window where a bicycle is on display. He wants it as his birthday gift. The kid?s father overhears and looks embarrassed. He must have felt that his son has put his old man, presumably no longer an earning member, into a predicament. So the next morning he goes up to his father and offers him a cheque. His explanation is the kid would feel bad if he doesn?t get his bicycle.

 At this point, the old man calls out to his grandson who arrives on his new bicycle. The men exchange happy glances, then the old man has his parting shot. He returns the cheque to his son and says, ?Rakh lo, nahin to mujhe bura lagega.? The voiceover tells you to make sure that whenever you extend your hand it always is to give and not to take. And of course the pension plan helps you to do this.

 A man?s life after retirement could easily be as long as his working life. No one will debate that it?s prudent to invest during earning days so that money works when you do not. For the 30s of today, the lure of a new car or a fridge is far stronger than worries about the future. No wonder then that the HDFC ad is targeting the over-50s. By then the threat usually starts sinking in.

 What is the threat? Post-retirement, in the privileged part of our society, food and shelter are not the major anxieties. Thanks to medical insurance, expense on healthcare is also becoming less of an issue. Many, in any case, make a lot of compromises in their daily routine. Such quiet changes in lifestyle in fact mask an anxiety.

 There is one thing for which there still is no assurance. The respect you enjoyed in your home, office, neighbourhood and among your relations suddenly seems vulnerable. The prospect of a humiliating transition from being the main earner of the family to its main baggage haunts the mind. Everyone entering this age thus desperately seeks a shield.

 Needless to say, this protection of self-esteem is the most potent trigger for investment and savings. That the HDFC campaign recognised it and made it the fulcrum of its communication is certainly laudable. The applause will grow manifold if one remembers that it is easy to recognise the anxiety at 50. For a 30-year-old, it is a discovery. And advertising these days more often than not thinks young. GeneratioNext is the focus. 

 Most creative people are thus young in age or at least in mind. Given that, it is remarkable that some such young communicator paused and looked at Generationcient, and acknowledged an emotion that very few in the target group wear on their sleeves. It must have taken a trip on the time machine to empathise.

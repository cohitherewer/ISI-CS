 94 trees to be felled to widen 4 roads

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has got the green light from the state pollution control board (PCB), to fell 94 large trees to widen Sarat Bose Road (Lansdowne Road), Lansdowne Terrace, Nasiruddin Road and Tilak Road, all in south Calcutta.

 Mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera said the civic body has taken up the task in view of the growing traffic in the city. ?We have no other option but to remove the existing trees to widen the roads,? he said.

 The tree cutting committee of the green board has approved the civic body?s plea on the condition of compensatory plantation. The board has asked the civic body to submit a self-explanatory proposal on compensatory plantation.

 ?We prefer transplantation of trees to felling them. It takes more than 20 years for a sapling to grow to this dimension,? observed Biswajit Mukherjee, a senior law officer in the PCB. He added that for every roadside tree removed, the civic authorities will have to plant at least five trees as compensation.

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said the civic body has chosen the embankments of the Beleghata canal for compensatory plantation. ?We will try to uproot the trees first from the Sarat Bose Road area and transplant them on the canal banks,? said Khan. 

 Since the city?s green cover is much less than the national standard, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has directed chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose to transplant as many trees as possible.

 As per the national standard, a city should have a green cover at least 15 per cent of the total area of the city. In 1963, it was 5.7 per cent in Calcutta and now, after more than 40 years, it is only nine per cent.

 The state government has adopted an enactment banning indiscriminate cutting of trees in the city and urban areas. Green board law officer Mukherjee said the government will soon publish the guiding rules of the enactment.

 Till the proposed act comes into force, the tree cutting committee will act as a monitoring authority, he added.

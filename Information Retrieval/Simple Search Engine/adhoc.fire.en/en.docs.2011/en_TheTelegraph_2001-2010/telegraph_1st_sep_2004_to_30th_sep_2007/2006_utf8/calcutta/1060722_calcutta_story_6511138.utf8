 Weaving together two dying forms, Pandavani and Jhumur, and the tale of a hero, Kasba Arghya is mounting Bharatkatha on a larger-than-usual scale. The Kasba-based theatre troupe had worked on Shashi Tharoor?s Riot before the more-acclaimed Chandrabati.

 Bharatkatha is based on a war 

 episode from the Mahabharata, where the spotlight 

 is on Abhimanyu, son of Arjun and Subhadra. The narrative 

 goes straight into the 13th day of war when Bhishma is dead 

 and the chakravyuh is ready to entrap Abhimanyu. 

 ?We are looking at Abhimanyu as a human hero. I felt he?s 

 very relevant as all of us, like him, are fighting the forces 

 and are unaware of the final outcome,? says director Manish 

 Mitra.

 The play fuses Purulia?s Jhumur with the Chattisgarhi Pandavani form, both of which are strong oral traditions. Mitra and his team have sourced the rare Jhumur texts from Sindhubala Debi and Jhumuriya Amulya Kumar. 

 ?There are striking similarities between Jhumur and Pandavani, in terms of lyrics, emotion and structure,? stresses Mitra, who has opted for Darbari Jhumur that is tilted towards raag sangeet. This has allowed him greater freedom to flow into the Jhumur text from a Bharatanatyam recital with which the play starts.

 ?It is to blend the classical and folk forms which have a oneness, though some people feel they are divergent. We begin with a Ganesha vandana that is a mandatory part of all folk forms. It?s also relevant because Lord Ganesha had written the Mahabharata for Ved Vyasa,? explains Mitra. 

 The text of Bharatkatha is composed of Abhimanyu Badh Pala (Jhumur) and Chakravyuh (Pandavani) interspersed with Sanskrit slokas and a portion of a Hindi poem on Karna.

 Seema Ghosh, who has trained in Pandavani?s kapalik form under Teejan Bai, flits in and out of Abhimanyu and other characters, including the narrator?s. The team learnt the craft during a weeklong stay last October in Bhilai. Impressed with their performance, Teejan Bai gifted Seema a tambura. ?The challenge in Pandavani is in balancing the acting with the singing. You have to switch from one to another and back again in very little time,? says Seema, having picked up the style, diction and body language of her guru. ?In Bharatkatha, Abhimanyu is like a little boy, very human which makes the pala so much exciting,? adds Seema, who has also learnt the Pandavani forms of cheer harana, gadaparba and urubhangam.

 The production is using Chhau for its ?vigour? and has assembled Bipin Majhi and his team from Purulia for the purpose. But Chhau masks will not be used. With a 25-member cast, the close to two-hour-long Bharatkatha will be staged at the Academy of Fine Arts on July 30, 6.30 pm.

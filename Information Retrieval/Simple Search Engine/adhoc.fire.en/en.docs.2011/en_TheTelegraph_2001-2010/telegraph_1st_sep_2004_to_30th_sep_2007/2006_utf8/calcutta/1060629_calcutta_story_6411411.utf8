The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cost-share snag in LRT

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government has asked the private companies interested in executing the Rs 2,400-crore light rail transit (LRT) project to state how much money they are ready to pump in.

 ?We will take a final decision only after they make a declaration on investment,? chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb told Metro. 

 Transport department officials hinted that the government could, at best, share one-third of the cost. The rest will have to be provided by the private partner.

 The project may have to be shelved if the private firms do not agree to the cost-sharing pattern.

 The transport department has shortlisted four companies from among those who have responded to the expression of interest invited by the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation to execute the project on a build-operate-transfer basis.

 The four ? Siemens, Amex International, BHEL and SREI-Metrail ? on Tuesday gave a video presentation in the presence of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, chief secretary Deb, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and chief traffic and transportation engineer B.K. Sadhu. Representatives of the city police, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners and the Calcutta Tramways Company, too, attended the presentation.

 According to officials, the companies explained in detail the technology they would use and the construction methodology, but did not specify the extent of investment.

 ?We have viewed the presentations in detail and found that a monorail-type vehicle or the high-speed tram will be most suitable for the city,? Deb said. ?Now, we have to look into the major part of the issue, the share of investment.?

 The government started looking for a private partner after the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, which has expressed interest in funding the project, made it clear that the money would come in fiscal 2006-07 only if the government submitted two crucial reports by October.

 The transport department considers this an impossibility. ?Even if work starts now, the detailed project report, which has to be submitted along with an environment impact assessment report, will not be ready before January 2007,? said an official. 

 The green document, though, will be ready in time.

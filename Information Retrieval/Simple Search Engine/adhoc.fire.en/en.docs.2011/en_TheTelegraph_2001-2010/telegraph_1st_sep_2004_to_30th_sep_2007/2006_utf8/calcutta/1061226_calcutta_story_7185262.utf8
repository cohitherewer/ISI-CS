The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 People 

 are drawn to your activism, verve and fiery touch. You believe 

 firmly that you can achieve whatever it is you set your 

 mind to. You are forever on the lookout for the bigger and 

 better everything. You prefer to work with others and stick 

 to one project at a time. Kusum Bhandari

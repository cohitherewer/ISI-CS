 Cadence from Calcutta will resonate at a rare rendezvous in the US this Nine-Eleven, which also coincides with the centenary of Gandhijis first non-violent public action.

 City-based classical vocalist Santanu Bandyopadhyay and Neel Adhikari, who have collaborated for the East-West vocal fusion ensemble Class Apart, have been invited to perform at the Lincoln Memorial on September 11, when the MK Gandhi Institute calls for a global Day of Peace and Reconciliation.

 The duo will do a special set to celebrate the force of peace at the historic site in Washington, DC, joined by non-resident Bengali Broto Roy on the tabla in what will be one in a series of musical concerts in the US to commemorate Nine-Eleven.

 We are extremely honoured to be invited by Krishna K. Roy, chairman of the MK Gandhi Institute for Non-Violence, to make music on this special day at a special venue. Our set will be in sync to invoke peace, Bandyopadhyay, representing the fifth generation of the Bishnupur gharana, tells Metro.

 His disciple Adhikari is equally awed by the occasion and setting. Its like a dream-come-true and the thought of performing at the Lincoln Memorial gives me goosebumps. Well kick off with a rendition of Raag Hansadhvani, also incorporating Stop The War and Raghupati Raghava from our debut album, he says.

 Another anti-war anthem, Dont take away the sky, a fusion version of Norwegian Woods and Take this moment, featuring computer rhythms, nylon string guitar and Bandyopadhyays voice woven around Raag Megh Mallar, will also be part of their repertoire.

 The melody-mix will be preceded by a conference-cum-tribute dinner Non-violence in the age of terrorism on September 10 at Georgetown University, Washington, DC. The conference will bring together policy-makers, operations leaders, mediators, activists, educators, game developers, non-profit organisations and others to explore how diverse peace actors can work together to increase their impact.

 On its second US tour, the city dyad will also perform at the Orlando Bengali Association, the Oklahoma Indian Association, Denver, New Jersey, Transylvenia University and the Indian Association, Lexington.

 Hi-tech calls for airport

 SANJAY MANDAL

Calcutta airport is taxiing for a hi-tech take-off. 

 The age-old technology of communication through telephone lines will be replaced with a satellite-based one at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. 

 The new mode of communication ? Direct Satellite Communication Network (DSCN) system ? will ensure faster and better communication between Calcutta and other airports and help in better connectivity with the radar centre in Berhampore, Orissa, which monitors aircraft movement over the Bay of Bengal.

 ?This is part of our plan to upgrade Calcutta airport to international standards. There are also other plans in the pipeline,? said S.P.S. Bakshi, executive director of the airport.

 ?With the boom in aviation sector, there is an urgent need for improving infrastructure of the airport. It is also important for ensuring air safety,? he added. 

 Another senior official pointed out: ?At times, the telephone line goes dead because of technical reasons, creating problems in communicating with other bases. Connectivity and voice quality will improve manifold once the satellite-based system is put in place.?

 Apart from being more dependable, the satellite system will increase the speed of communication and the messages will be clearer. ?The voice messages and data will be much clearer than before. The system is 100 per cent dependable and free of error,? the official asserted.

 According to officials, the new system will also improve the surveillance of aircraft flying over the Bay. 

 The radar station installed few years ago in Berhampore for monitoring air traffic movement over the Bay will be connected with the Calcutta airport with satellite. 

 Now, the data transmitted by the radar about the position of an aircraft over the Bay is communicated to the airport through a BSNL line. Once DSCN is implemented, this communication will also take place via satellite.

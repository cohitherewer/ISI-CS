The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

All about upsets

Screen On amp; Off

 It was a bizarre set of figures from every side of the popularity prism. As Maria Goretti (picture right by Aranya Sen) and her Sabsey Favourite Kaun team from STAR Gold read out the east zone results of the first stage of polling of this year?s edition of the Bollywood poll on Sunday afternoon at INOX (City Centre), there were surprises galore.

 Who would think that Parineeta, set and shot in Calcutta with oodles of Bengaliness in every frame, wouldn?t figure in the Top 10 choices of the Sabsey Favourite Film category? Who would think that Bengali queen Rani Mukherjee would finish behind Aishwarya Rai as the Sabsey Favourite Heroine? Who would think that Shah Rukh Khan, winner of the Sabsey Favourite Hero crown for the past two years, would be number four behind Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan and Abhishek Bachchan?

 Calcutta is not to be blamed alone. The other eight towns to have voted in the east zone include Burdwan, Ranchi, Cuttack, Raipur, Bhubaneswar, Jamshedpur, Bilaspur and Asansol.

 ?It?s very surprising to us also,? admits Aalif Surti, vice-president, content, STAR India, and head, STAR Gold. ?We expected Vidya Balan to feature in the Sabsey Favourite Naya Heroine category from this zone. But we have Katrina Kaif topping the charts and Balan not even in the Top Five.?

 But the east has been loyal to Black, voting it the Sabsey Favourite Film, while all the other zones have gone with Bunty Aur Babli. And the zone has crowned Kunal ?Aslam? Kapoor the top contender for the Sabsey Favourite Naya Hero trophy.

 All the zonal choices will now be collated to draw up the final nomination list for the Sabsey Favourite Kaun Awards. The weekly show on TV ? every Sunday, 12.30 pm on STAR Gold ? will beam the zonal vote break-up before announcing the final nominees on April 9, when the voting lines will be thrown open. Almost one month of SMS, televoting and Net polling later, the final show on May 5 will declare the winners.

 ?All the film awards around are performance-based, so we don?t have a consolidated measurement of a star?s popularity. For someone like Aamir Khan, who does one film in three years, it is an interesting study to determine whether his staying away from the theatres affects his popularity or not. And this time, we have gone the extra mile by having the people decide on the nominations too,? explains Surti.

 A moment from Black

The Sabsey Favourite Election Express has been chugging 

along throughout the country, across 24,000 km through 45 towns in 14 states. 

?We have received more than one lakh votes till now and we expect the figure to 

go up to 10 lakh by the time we close the voting,? adds Surti.

 The host for the show continues to be funnyman Arshad Warsi, joined this time by wife Maria. While Arshad couldn?t be in town ? he?s shooting in Bangkok for a Raj Kaushal movie ? Maria had his message to give Calcuttans. ?Having played the character of Devdas on the show, he has picked up bits of Bengali and has told you, ?Aami aschi?,? she smiled.

 The Raghu Romeo actress, who was last seen in a special appearance in Salaam Namaste, is not too keen to take on acting roles on the big screen. ?If my baby Zeke Zidane does some movies in the future, I may sneak into some frame as his mother,? signed off Maria, referring to her fleeting role in the Salaam Namaste bookstore.

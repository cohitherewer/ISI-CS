 Mutilated infant found

 - Dog fishes out blood-stained packet from roadside drain

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The mutilated body of a newborn, wrapped in a piece of blood-stained cloth, was found by residents of Sonali Park, in the Regent Park police station area, on Friday afternoon.

 The residents first saw a street dog trying to tear open a parcel it had fished out of a roadside drain.

 A closer look revealed the body of a baby, barely a few days old. Local police were summoned to take away the body and send it for post-mortem.

 Joydeb Haldar, a local resident who was witness to the shocking discovery of the infants body, told police that around 3.30 pm, the dog was seen dragging out something from the roadside drain.

 When we realised it was a parcel soaked in blood, we rushed to the spot. By then, the dog was tearing open the packet. But we managed to chase the dog away and open the packet, Haldar recounted.

 The sight of the babys body was horrific. The head was severed and the genitals were badly bruised, said an investigating officer.

 Police are trying to ascertain whether the dog had caused the damage or whether it was a case of cold-blooded murder in an effort to destroy the evidence of illegitimacy.

 It could be that the dog had bitten into the parcel while fishing it out of the drain. But the possibility of a brutal killing is also on the cards, the officer said. 

 District superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) S.N. Gupta said local police have been asked to visit nursing homes in the area to ascertain whether a child born this week had gone missing.

 Preliminary investigations reveal that it was a newborn. We feel the body was dumped a couple of days ago, because it was in a decomposed state when we found it. I have asked my officers to visit the neighbourhood nursing homes and note down details of all babies born this week. This could help us track down the mother. However, if the baby was delivered at home, then it will be difficult to trace the mother, Gupta observed.

 Residents reacted with shock and tempers were frayed when the needle of suspicion swung towards two families living near the spot where the babys body was found.

 Two adjoining houses were attacked and partially ransacked, police said.

 The attack was carried out on the basis of rumours and so, no arrests have been carried out. We went to the spot and restored order before things took an ugly turn, said an officer at the site, admitting to simmering tension in the locality.

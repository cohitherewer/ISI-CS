 Hangman Nata Mullick, three years short of 90, has signed up with a jatra troupe as an actor. He claims the governments refusal to offer him financial help, despite repeated requests, has forced him into the role at this age.

 Have you ever seen an 87-year-old man moving from place to place to earn money? asks Nata. I am being forced to do so as the government is indifferent towards me. It makes tall promises whenever someone has to be hanged, but forgets its word later. I was driven out when I went to Presidency jail recently to meet senior officers.

 The hangman is playing the role of a jester in Desher Satru Neta, Baper Satru Beta, being produced by the Rabindra Sarani-based Mangaldeep Opera. Manager Haradhan Roy said the troupe is eyeing a pre-Puja release for the pala.

 The man who has hanged more than 70 convicts, with his father and alone, will speak against capital punishment in the play.

 Nata is happy and looking forward to his new assignment, spanning 100 shows across the state. I am very excited. Besides, the shows will bring me money. What else can I do? How long can I depend on my sons? I get scared every time I fall ill, as there is no money for treatment. Recently, I was admitted to a hospital where doctors advised a special check-up, but I could not afford it.

 He also hopes that peoples perception of him will change after seeing him on stage. People used to think that Nata can only hang people. Now, they will know he can also sing and act, he said.

 Having roped in the hangman, Mangaldeep Opera, too, is excited. There is so much talent in him that hasnt been tapped. He can sing and act. We are taking a chance and lets see what happens. We cannot pay him according to his expectation, but we are trying our best to stand by him, so he lives the rest of his life with dignity, said Uttam Maity, of the troupe.

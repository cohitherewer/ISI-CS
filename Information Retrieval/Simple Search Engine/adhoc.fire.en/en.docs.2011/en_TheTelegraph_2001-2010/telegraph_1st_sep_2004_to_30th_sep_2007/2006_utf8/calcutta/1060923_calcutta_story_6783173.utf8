What you will

Stage On amp; Off 

Ananda Lal

 Her story: Lushin Dubey, who has mesmerised Mumbai 

audiences with her Lady Macbeth act in Alyque Padamsees Macbeth, breezed through 

town last Saturday with Muskaan. Staged at Tollygunge Club, the production had 

Dubey playing a woman in her 40s who gets HIV from her husband. Picture by Bishwarup 

Dutta 

Farces in Hindi and Bengali romped merrily through 

the city recently. While Ashwin Gidwanis presentation of Mahesh Dattanis Arre! 

Mad about Money!! flew down from Mumbai to Kala Mandir, local debutantes The 

Performers Wing winged it over Gyan Manch with Sukumar Rays Lakshmaner Shaktishel.

Fans of Dattani may protest that he could not have 

penned a drama with such a crass title. Absolutely right. Paritosh Painter concocted 

this Hinglishism for his translation of Dattanis first full-length play, Where 

Theres a Will. But other than that and some resequencing and updating of 

scenes (Dattani wrote it 20 years ago), he has stuck to the script.

In this comedy of conflict between generations, the 

ground constantly shifts beneath the audiences feet. As the patriarch blusters 

about the clout he wields, blasts his wastrel son and domineers over the women, 

senior self-made men in the auditorium nod in assent. By the time we reach the 

end, however, the tables have turned. The wife, mistress and daughter-in-law join 

forces to expose his tyranny, so the female and younger spectators have the last 

laugh.

The production clicks thanks to the text, not the 

acting. Only the stalwart comedian, Paintal, holds his own in the main role. Suchitra 

Pillai is leaden as the mistress, whereas Rimta Jaykar (the wife) and Dipika Amin 

(the daughter-in-law) behave more naturally. Pushkar (the son) has a poor delivery 

with a pronounced lisp.

Staging Lakshamaner Shaktishel on 9/11 

and publicising it with pictures of monkeys, planes and the twin towers made the 

objective of The Performers Wing clear. They would interpret Rays classic in 

its original spirit as full-tilt pastiche, but from an adult perspective and against 

a contemporary political backdrop.

So we see Ramas army in camouflage fatigues with 

toy guns and Hanumans cohorts going ape in RSS vests and shorts. Ravana appears 

in Batwoman garb and Yama in black mini-skirt. Ravana sends Sugriva packing 

by tossing a cardboard cut-out of an airliner at him.

All this creates an air of utter madness and some 

great slapstick, though anyone would find it difficult to rationally link associations 

behind the symbolism.

Joyraj Bhattacharjees exceptional acrobatic skills 

rubbed off on his direction of the team. Particularly noteworthy among them, because 

they had characters to convey as opposed to caricatures, were Parni Ray as a sentimental, 

cowardly Vibhishan and Rohini Chaki as an aggro minister Jambuban.

Impressive cameos included Yajnaseni Das (Ravana) 

and Sukanya Chakrabarti (Yamadut). Abhijay Guptas towering and deep triple-level 

set of bamboo, wood and rope looked superb.

Return to roots

An urge to archive the fading traditions of rural 

Bengal has pushed film-maker Ashoke Viswanathan to capture the life and times 

of village folk artistes on celluloid. The result: two documentaries, Folk 

Theatre of Bengal and Legend of Manasa, funded by Eastern Zonal Cultural 

Centre. Both were screened at Max Mueller Bhavan recently.

In Folk Theatre of Bengal, Viswanathan embarks 

on a fascinating tour of the districts, starting with Ghatal and Hooghly where 

villagers still practise the folk form Bharjatra. The journey takes him to the 

Alkaap artistes of Murshidabad who have slowly lost out. 

Folk theatre reflects a multiplicity of culture and 

traditions that emanates from society, says Viswanathan. 

In Legend of Manasa, Viswanathan analyses the 

socio-political reasons behind the emergence of Manasamangal. Viswanathan has 

Madhumanti Maitra as co-narrator.

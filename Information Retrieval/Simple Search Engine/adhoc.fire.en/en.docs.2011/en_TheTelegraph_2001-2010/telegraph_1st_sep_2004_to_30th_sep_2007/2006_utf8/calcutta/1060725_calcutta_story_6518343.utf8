The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Loan bar for realty minus green nod

 JAYANTA BASU

 No real estate project in the city or beyond will be sanctioned a bank loan if it does not have the mandatory environment clearance, from the state pollution control board or the Centre (depending on the nature of the project).

 The decision was taken in principle at a recent meeting called by the state board. Besides officials of the board, state environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee and representatives of around 20 banks attended the meeting.

 ?The in-principle decision ? of not sanctioning a loan to a real estate project that does not have the necessary green clearance ?will be implemented after follow-up meetings with the banks and other stakeholders. Reserve Bank of India, too, has sent a circular to all banks on the matter,? state board chairman Sudip Banerjee told Metro.

 The circular ? 8899 CPRMD 2005-2006/20/dt. 28 September 2005 ? expressed concern over the substantial increase in lending to the real estate sector in the past few years and asked all banks to ensure the borrowers have obtained consent from the government, local authority (civic body) and other statutory agencies.

 ?It may be a bit difficult, but I guess we have to fall in line with the board directive,? said Thomas Joseph, deputy general manager of Federal Bank, who attended the meeting.

 ?We could not attend the meeting, but our general manager has communicated the RBI circular to all our branches,? said S.K. Manglik, assistant general manager of Allahabad Bank. 

 In June, the deputy general manager of UCO Bank had written to the state pollution control board chairman, seeking to know the status of certain projects that had applied for bank loans.

 ?The practice of sanctioning loans to realty projects that do not have the mandatory green clearance needs to be stopped. It is creating several problems,? pointed out Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the state board.

 ?Whenever the board takes any action against a developer, especially when a closure order is issued, there is a problem of repayment. If work gets stalled, the fate of the money loaned to the developer and also individual apartment-buyers becomes uncertain,? he clarified.

 A case in point are two mega housing projects coming up within the East Calcutta Wetlands. 

 A few months ago, Calcutta High Court had ordered demolition of both projects (the matter is now pending in the Supreme Court). A multinational bank had lent money to both the developers and flat-buyers.

 Commenting on the pollution control board?s decision, Credai vice-president Santosh Rungta said: ?I generally agree with the contention of not disbursing loans to real estate projects that do not have the requisite clearances, but I have reservations about the RBI lending policy as a whole.?

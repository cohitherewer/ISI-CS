The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Window for global vision 

 - Effective development centre for children in crisis

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On a hot May afternoon, Paro Khatoon is busy manoeuvring delicacies on her plate inside a Park Hotel restaurant. 

 A couple of years back, you would have found Paro begging with her partially-blind mother around Majestic cinema. Those were her hard days, when she lost two brothers and a sister to poverty. 

 Things changed after World Vision India?s Snehadeep Street Children Project took nine-year-old Paro under its wing. As an inmate of YMCA Ranaghat, Paro is now studying in an English-medium school. 

 Sunita Kumari still considers the pavement outside the Medical College her home. Her mother, who sells firewood, was worried about her security and education. She approached the Bob Pierce Home for Adolescent Girls in Baruipur, which is also part of the World Vision programme. 

 ?At first, I was reluctant to go there, but now I love it. I want to take up doll-making as my career,? said Sunita.

 Sunita, Paro, Kunal Raut and Sujit Paswan were the ambassadors of ?Children in Crisis? campaign, organised by World Vision India. 

 Established in 1950, the organisation made its first intervention in Calcutta a year later. ?Initially, we use to distribute milk from a clinic on BB Ganguly Street, and run health checks on the children brought in,? recalled Jayanth Vincent of World Vision. 

 Headquartered in Chennai, the organisation, with an average annual layout of Rs 150-160 crore (thanks to donations from India and abroad), runs over 144 projects across 24 states. The organisation has started campaigns for the HIV-infected children, forced labourers in bidi and fire-cracker factories, juvenile sex workers in Jaipur and even for those affected during the natural disasters in Latur, Orissa, Gujarat and, recently, Kashmir.

 ?Our aim is not just giving relief but capacity-building, so that some day, these people can handle their own problems,? said Remi Manoj, programme manager of Snehadeep. 

 Currently, World Vision is busy with two events for children. The first is an oratory competition for child labourers. The winners will accompany World Vision representatives to Delhi and hand over to the President a strategy to combat the ills against kids . 

 They will also launch a book of photographs, India Tomorrow, carrying the views and dreams of 30 children.

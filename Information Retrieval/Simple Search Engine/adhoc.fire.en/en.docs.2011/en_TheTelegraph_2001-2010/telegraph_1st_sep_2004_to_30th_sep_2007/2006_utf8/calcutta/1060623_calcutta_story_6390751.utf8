 Caper classic comeback

 Om Puri and Paresh Rawal for Pran and Ashok Kumar. It can?t get more apt than that in the remake of Victoria No. 203, discovers Pratim D. Gupta

 Remember Pran and Ashok Kumar in weird wigs indulging in a bizarre skirt-chasing act and going Do bechaare bina sahaare? Well, 34 years later, Om Puri and Paresh Rawal have been asked to step into the same shoes ? rather than don the same wigs ?and play Raja and Rana, as Ananth Mahadevan sets out to re-make the 1972 classic caper Victoria No. 203.

 Intriguingly, the new Victoria No. 203 will be co-produced by Kamal Sadanah, son of Brij Sadanah, who had directed the original film three-and-a-half decades back. Kamal, of course, is the same failed actor who acted in movies like Bekhudi and Rang and was linked to Kajol ages ago. Rahul Rawail was initially approached to direct the new version, but Ananth, basking in Aksar glory, has finally been asked to take charge.

 ?You ask anybody about his or her favourite 20 Bollywood films and Victoria No. 203 will surely be up there with the likes of Golmaal and Chupke Chupke,? Ananth says. ?This is surely one of the cult caper films to have come on the Indian screen.?

 The announcement of a new Victoria No. 203 comes on the heels of other big-screen remake plans like Don (Farhan Akhtar), Sholay (Ram Gopal Varma) and Amar Akbar Anthony (David Dhawan).

 Ananth is very particular about retaining the original flavour. ?We are definitely styling the film for today but it?s just an upgrade to a modern setting,? he clarifies.

 To be honest, I havent 

 seen Victoria No. 303 (sic). But I do consider Saira 

 Banu as one of the timeless beauties of the Indian screen. 

 I have always been a big fan of hers and obviously remember 

 the song sequence of her in a bath towel in the film. 

 You know what, many people feel that I look a lot like 

 her. I remember when I shot for the wedding scene in 

 Khel sporting a bouffant, many people came up to me 

 and said how I resembled Saira Banu from one of those 

 Shammi Kapoor movies. I never imagined that someday 

 I would be offered a role played by her. Although its 

 not finalised yet, I really want this film to happen. 

 CELINA JAITLEY

 Casting Paresh and Om was as natural 

 as the original pairing of Pran and Dadamoni. ?If you look 

 through the decades, Paresh and Om are the modern counterparts 

 of the two great actors. These two can set up a laugh riot 

 in their own way,? says Ananth.

 Dino Morea will be playing the character Navin Nischol had portrayed in the original. ?There will be a lot more of his character than there was in the old film,? Ananth adds. ?These days you cannot expect the audience to just go and watch an older couple in action. So we are trying to balance it out by fleshing out the characters of the newer generation.?

 But who will play the part of a stunning Saira Banu? ?We haven?t decided yet but we are looking at Celina Jaitley as an option,? Ananth reveals. 

 ?And that shower song Thoda sa thehro will definitely be there. Himesh Reshammiya will be remaking that song along with Do bechaare? besides creating a whole new soundtrack for the movie? We should start principal photography by December and it should be ready for a summer release next year.?

 But won?t Victoria No. 203 ?then? have a more visible link with Victoria No. 203 ?now?? ?We are trying to get everyone from Pransaab and Navin Nischol to Saira Banu and Helen to make special appearances in the new film,? Ananth plays his trump card.

 Biz plan contest in growth mode 

 - New 

 adaptability test, online game at IIM flagship event 

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE 

 The scope and scale of i2I (ideas to Implementation), the annual business plan contest of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC), has been expanded every year, and this year will be no different.

 The organisers, the entrepreneurship cell of the premier B-school, are confident that the fifth edition of the contest, which was launched on October 20, will touch new heights.

 The registrations have started and we are expecting entries to start pouring in. Last year, we had received about 250 entries. We are expecting the number to cross 400 this year, said Mihir Kulkarni, a second-year student of IIMC who is part of the organising team. 

 One of the flagship events on the B-schools calendar, i2I was conceived in 2001 with the objective of providing students a platform to showcase their entrepreneurial skills. Venture capital funds and corporate houses have supported the contest since its inception and encouraged the young brains to come up with ideas. 

 The rules of the game are not much different from the previous editions. The contestants will have to submit executive summaries of their business plans by November 10. A panel of judges, drawn from the world of business and academia, will shortlist 50 plans, which will then have to be submitted in detail by December 7. Six of the 50 will be selected for the finals, scheduled for December 29 and 30. 

 But the finals this year will have an added twist. Apart from presenting the business plans, the finalists will have to adapt them to deal with unexpected but plausible business scenarios, to be set by the judges.

 We are introducing the new element to test the adaptability of the contestants and their understanding of the industry, said Mikin Lala, a second-year IIMC student who heads the entrepreneurship cell.

 The two top plans will win cash prizes of Rs 40,000 and Rs 25,000, besides financial and technical support from venture capital funds to fine-tune the ideas and implement them as businesses.

 A select few will get seed capital to start business ventures. A panel of venture capital companies have agreed to chip in with the money required to help some of the bright ideas, added Lala. 

 Another attraction in this years contest will be an online game that will simulate the dynamic business environment and challenges faced by entrepreneurs during execution of their ideas.

 Also, i2I is expanding its reach from the business plan contest to an entrepreneurial conclave. There will be a discussion on social entrepreneurship by a panel comprising corporate leaders, social entrepreneurs, academics and government officials.

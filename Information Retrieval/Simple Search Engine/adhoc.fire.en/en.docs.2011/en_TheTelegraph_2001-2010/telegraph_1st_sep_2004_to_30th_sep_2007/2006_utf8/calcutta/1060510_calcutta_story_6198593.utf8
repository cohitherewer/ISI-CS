 Ballot clue to hawker call

 Today?s question: Do you support the mayor?s call to bring hawkers back to the pavement?

 Open-air market: A day in the life 

 of a pavement

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 Unauthorised occupation of pavements by traders has become commonplace in the city. Though the mayor may not realise it, hawkers have become the terror of pedestrians, who are forced to walk along dug-up and ill-maintained carriageways. There are hawkers in other Indian cities, but nowhere are they as disruptive as in Calcutta. And all because of political patronage. If the administration fails to curb the menace, the city will turn into the world?s biggest open-air bazaar.

 It is unfortunate that the mayor has made such an irresponsible statement when the number of pedestrians is several times the number of hawkers. It implies that he benefits more by appeasing hawkers than by ensuring the comfort and safety of the majority of citizens. The assumption that hawkers won?t take up more than one-third of the pavements is ridiculous.

 Ronita Dutta,

 Jadavpur 

 The pavements are not for the hawkers; they are for the free and safe movement of pedestrians. The hawkers should keep in mind that the mayor?s call is a pathetic attempt to attract votes. He would abandon them after the elections.

 Pijus Kanti Sarkar, 

 Acharyyapalli

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya is quite fond of gimmicks. At the height of bird flu, he insisted that it was safe to eat chicken. Now, he wants to bring hawkers back to the pavement.

 Abhishek Law,

 Bidhan Sarani

 During the tenure of the previous mayor, the city pavements were reduced so that the carriageways could be widened. On top of that if the hawkers start encroaching on whatever is left of the pavements, the pedestrians will be left with no other option but to become helpless victims of mishaps. The mayor?s call defies logic. He should instead ensure that the hawkers are rehabilitated in the markets.

 Footpaths are meant only for pedestrians.They are not for hawkers. The mayor has sounded the call with an eye on the elections. If the civic body indeed allows hawkers to settle on the pavements, it will cause severe problems. Several important roads like Brabourne Road and Gariahat Road have already been taken over by the hawkers. This cannot be allowed to continue.

 Usha Ram,

 Garden Reach Road

 I fully support the mayor?s call. Hawking is the only source of income of many families. By setting up stalls on the pavement, the hawkers inconvenience the pedestrians, but removing them will have serious repercussions.

 Atif Ayaz, 

 Serampore

 Removing hawkers would increase the crime rate in the city, but if they are allowed to stay pedestrians would suffer. I feel calling the hawkers back to the pavements is just a pre-poll gimmick.

Md. Sohail,

 Address not given

 No, not at all. The mayor?s decision is completely wrong. Allowing hawkers back to the pavement would have serious consequences. Every day, I struggle to walk along JL Nehru Road, near the Park Street crossing, due to hawkers blocking the pavement. The government must move them elsewhere.

 Sohini Roy, 

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

 The mayor?s call to bring hawkers back to the pavement will increase the chaos on the roads. Accidents are likely to rise. The government has to think of other ways to rehabilitate hawkers.

 Mehjibin Yunus,

 Bright Street

 Removing hawkers from the pavements might cause them financial distress, but that doesn?t mean that they should be allowed to remain where they are. If the mayor really wishes hawkers well, then he should rehabilitate them in a market.

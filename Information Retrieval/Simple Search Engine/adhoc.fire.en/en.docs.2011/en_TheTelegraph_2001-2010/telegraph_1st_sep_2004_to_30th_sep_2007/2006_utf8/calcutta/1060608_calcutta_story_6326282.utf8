 Usha Uthup: Switching 

 roles

 How is Usha Uthup minus the trademark big bindi, gajra and kanjeevaram silks? We will know if her Malayalam film ever makes it to Calcutta. Emerging from the shell of her singer persona, Usha is quietly getting ready to slip into the shoes of a lawyer for the Malayalam big screen this monsoon.

 In Pothen Vava (The Name), Usha plays the strong-willed Catholic mother of southern superstar Mammootty. The film revolves around the various phases in Mammootty?s life as he goes through a series of ups and downs, battling obstacles relating to the inter-religion marriage of his parents.

 Though she has played herself in films like Bombay to Goa ? apart from a cameo for Anjan Dutt?s yet-to-release Bow Barracks Forever ? the Malayalam film will mark Usha?s first full-fledged stint on screen.

 What clinched the film for her was a combination of a strong role and a good script. ?The lawyer I play is a Catholic married to a Hindu and is a very strong personality. The film is about national integration of religions, which is after my heart,? says Usha, taking a break from recording.

 ?I had been offered a few Hindi films before but nothing came of it as the roles were never strong and also because my children were growing up then. I remember I was offered a small role as Dharmendra?s sister in a Hindi film,? says Usha.

 Born into a south Indian family, she began her career crooning at Trincas, which used to be frequented by some star names of tinsel town. ?In the film, the son faces a lot of dilemma and as a mother I am very supportive of him? And some of the situations in the film are so real-life. Like my character in the film, I am a Hindu married into a Christian family but I have never faced her problems because I have been very open about it and my in-laws have also understood and supported me,? she adds. 

 Coincidentally, her screen hubby turns out to be a musician. A mainstream film, Pothen Vava will be directed by popular Malayalam director Joshy; shooting begins in Cochin this August. Usha admits having to make an effort to be fluent in Malayalam, a language she is less comfortable in than Tamil. And yes, she will also probably sing a song in the film.

 Reshmi Ghosh: Feisty figure

 Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi has just taken a 20-year leap into the future. With that, seven new faces have been added to the ever-growing Virani family. 

 Shantiniketan, the Virani household, 

 has never been the same since Tulsi left. In this chaos, 

 Kyunki... surges ahead by 20 years and brings in 

 some freshness with the fourth generation of Viranis. 

 The most important member to watch out for will be the heir to Tulsi?s legacy, a girl called Krishna Tulsi. Like her role model, she too will be rooted to culture and family values, combined with grey cells and a go-getter attitude.

 ?It?s time Tulsi passes on the baton to the younger generation. I was very particular about what I wanted from the actor as it is a very important role that she, as Krishna Tulsi, will be playing and I am happy that I narrowed down to the best. I am quite sure she will do full justice to the role,? said Ekta Kapoor, the powerhouse behind Kyunki...

 Reshmi Ghosh breezes into the long-running serial as Bhumi. She?s the feisty tomboyish daughter of Tanya and Karan. ?Bhumi is what Reshmi is not,? admitted the model-turned-actress from Calcutta now based in Mumbai.

 But why settle for the small screen? 

 ?I have been waiting for my films to release for a long 

 time and so decided not to waste any more time. And what 

 better option than Balaji,? Reshmi told Metro.

 That apart, there?s the mischievous but sensitive son of Sahil and Ganga; and Nakul who is bitter for not being wealthy enough. Akashdeep Saighal (who played Ansh, the dead villainous son of Tulsi) returns to the show as Eklavya. He plays Ansh?s son but in a positive light.

 The family mix is complete with Manthan, son of Karan and Tanya, who like Meera and Mandira is shrewd and manipulative. Living with this family is also the lovable Joydeep, a distant relative whom Sahil has adopted. 

 The fourth generation of Viranis 

 marched in from June 7. Kyunki... comes on air Monday 

 to Friday, at 10.30 pm on STAR Plus.

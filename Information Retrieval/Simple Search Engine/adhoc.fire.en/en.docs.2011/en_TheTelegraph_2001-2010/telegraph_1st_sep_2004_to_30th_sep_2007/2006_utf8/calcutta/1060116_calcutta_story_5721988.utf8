 Southern spread

What: The soft launch of Rasam, a south Indian 

speciality restaurant.

 Where: The Stadel in Salt Lake.

 When: January 14. 

 The ambience: Neat and no-fuss, this restaurant has a cream span of marble as the floor and yellow textured walls. Huge glass windows and sleek wooden tables further characterise this new eatery. The traditional south Indian touch is added in the form of ethnic wooden artefacts and idols. 

 The food: A typical south Indian menu that boasts a wide variety of Uthappam, Rava Dosa, Cheese Dosa, Masala Dosa, Vada and Idli. The Rasam special menu has a host of delicacies like Kanchipuram Idli, Mysore Dosa, Dry Fruit Uthappam and Payasam. 

 Pocket pinch: The prices hover in the modest range of Rs 15 to Rs 60, with the exception of the Family Dosa that costs Rs 120. 

 Voiceover: Calcuttans seem to be harbouring a special affinity for south Indian cuisine and so this speciality restaurant, says Anil Bhutoria, director of The Stadel. Chef Narayan Chatterjee recommends the Special Chutney and the Rasam. We make it differently, a top trade secret, he smiles. The full-fledged opening is slated for February.

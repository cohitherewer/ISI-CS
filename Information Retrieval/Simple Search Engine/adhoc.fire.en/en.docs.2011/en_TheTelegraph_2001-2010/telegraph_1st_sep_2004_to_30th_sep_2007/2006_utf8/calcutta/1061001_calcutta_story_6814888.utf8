The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Right click for virtual Puja spirit

 Too lazy to brave the crowd crush at the award-winning puja in Dum Dum Park but not ready to give pandal-hopping a miss either? Log on to www.telegraph.in to check out the idols from Paikpara to Patuli.

 And if you want the goddess on the go, browse to www.telegraph.in/wap on your cellphone. It is the first attempt by an Indian newspaper to set up a WAP Puja gallery. The address will contain all the images on the parent site.

 More is in store for the iPod generation in the form of podcasts and videocasts, to be uploaded on the website soon. Download the files to your iPod to carry a piece of Puja with you, always. The Net gains will include the latest episode of Mahishasur Pala, where the demon king tells his side of the story. 

 Those without iPods need not fret. The site will host multimedia presentations and a flash movie on this edition of the Puja before long.

 You, too, can send in your MMS 

 clips to 9831313699 or e-mail them to ttfeedbackabpmail.com.

 Class test on cards, review bar lowered

 - 25 changes in university exam revamp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Regular class tests and a preparatory test before each of the three-part exams of BA, B.Sc and B.Com are among the 25 changes announced by Calcutta University (CU) to modernise its undergraduate system.

 The new rules will come into effect from 2007 in all three streams of undergraduate courses, the universitys pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das said on Thursday.

 The 140-odd affiliated colleges will be informed of the changes on Friday.

 Also from the next academic session, a student will not lose a year if he fails in a paper in the final exams. For instance, if a student fails in a paper in Part I, he will have the option of writing the paper the following year, along with Part II papers.

 Besides, a student scoring 35 per cent on an average in each subject will have the right to get his answer scripts re-examined. The cut-off mark now is 40 per cent.

 Das linked the decision on class tests and preparatory tests to the universitys quest to follow an advanced system of teaching in classrooms and to ensure accountability of teachers.

 The university, however, will not be involved in these tests. It will be the responsibility of the colleges to ensure that their students clear these tests before they are allowed to sit for the Part I, II or III exams.

 Officials said the university felt the need to modernise the undergraduate system of education following the introduction of the three-part curriculum, each of a years duration. Earlier, the course comprised two parts, of two years and then one year.

 The new 1+1+1 structure is among the most modern at the undergraduate level, though some universities have gone a step further and introduced the semester system, said an official.

 A special meeting of the syndicate the universitys highest policy-making body approved the changes on Thursday.

 The proposals, contained in a four-page note, were referred to the syndicate by the undergraduate council of the university last week.

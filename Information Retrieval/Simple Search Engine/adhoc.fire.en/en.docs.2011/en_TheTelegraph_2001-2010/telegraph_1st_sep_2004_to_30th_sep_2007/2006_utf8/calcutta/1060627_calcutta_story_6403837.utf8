 Rath bar on key arteries

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fearing snarls, police will not allow any rathayatra processions on CR Avenue on Tuesday. An application by ISKCON to organise a rally on the artery, one of the busiest in the city, has been rejected.

 ?Tuesday is a working day. The traffic load will be like any other weekday. If we had allowed rathayatra rallies on CR Avenue, north-bound traffic would grind to a halt,? a traffic department officer explained on Monday.

 The ISKCON rally will start from Raja Subodh Mullick Square and wind through Nirmal Chandra Street, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, SN Banerjee Road, Esplanade, JL Nehru Road and Park Street, before terminating at the Park Circus Maidan.

 ?The march will start at 1 pm and continue till 5 pm,? said Pradip Mukherjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters). ?Commuters will run into snarls in some pockets.?

 Apart from CR Avenue, the AJC Bose Road flyover, bridge no. 4 (Park Circus), New Park Street, Theatre Road and the Park Circus-EM Bypass connector have been declared out of bounds for rathayatras.

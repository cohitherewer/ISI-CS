 He fought for the cause of human rights alongside the likes of Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu, spent 26 years behind bars for a free country, and helped build the new South Africa. 

 Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada is a freedom fighter, nation-builder, author and more.

 But now, the 76-year-old is ?just an ordinary functionary of the ANC (African National Congress)?. Seated in the garden at Raj Bhavan, the soft-spoken South African of Indian descent talked of India, South Africa, ANC, Robben Island prison and Mandela.

 ?On a personal level, it is very special to be at the Raj Bhavan, to meet Governor Gandhi. He was the second Indian high commissioner in the new South Africa. We had become good friends, and it?s lovely to spend time with him,? said the septuagenarian, popularly known as Kathy.

 In India for the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, he is touring the country, courtesy Indian Council for Cultural Relations. After Hyderabad and Bangalore, he arrived in Calcutta on Wednesday and leaves for Delhi on Thursday. On his fourth trip to the country, Kathrada said the signs of progress were evident.

 ?Everything is new, even in Calcutta. In Hyderabad and Bangalore, there are constructions everywhere. But the traffic is something I cannot understand. It?s almost like there are no rules. But people are so warm, friendly, patient and tolerant. Perhaps that?s why there is no road rage. It?s like divine patience,? he chuckled.

 Although the former MP in South Africa?s first democratically-elected government missed the 94th year celebrations of the ANC on January 8, he kept abreast of the news. ?The branch I am a member of, Lenasia (the Indian area outside Johannesburg segregated under the apartheid regime) won the best branch of the year prize,? he smiled.

 Despite the troubles ailing South Africa today ? mirrored by controversies plaguing the ANC ? the chairperson of the Robben Island Museum Council is a staunch supporter of his country and his party. But while he lists the improvements, Kathrada admits that there?s a long way to go. 

 ?We inherited a lot of baggage. We have already improved conditions in terms of sanitation, running water, housing and electricity. In the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, too, we are making headway. But it?s only been 11 years. That?s not enough time,? asserted the author of Memoirs and Letters from Robben Island.

 The ANC scandals, the latest involving Jacob Zuma, are not symptoms of a disease, he emphasised. ?The deputy president was fired before he is proven guilty. That?s a strength of the party, not a weakness.? 

 But the passion that inspired his generation does not exist among the youth today, sighed the former ANC national executive committee member.

 ?We had to fight for our freedom. And we had inspiring leaders. When Mandela was offered to be let off working in prison, he refused. When he was offered freedom in 1977, he refused. So, when I was offered freedom in 1982, I refused. Walter Sisulu?s daughter was tortured, yet he continued to fight,? he recalled. 

 But if there is an opium for the masses today, it?s TV! ?When we were given TV in prison, I stopped studying,? recounted Kathrada.

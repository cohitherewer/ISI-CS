 Resale trend in Rajarhat

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The land boom in New Town is prompting a section of entrepreneurs to attempt ?resale? of plots even before getting their possession by paying the full amount.

 According to Hidco officials, the implementing agency of the Rajarhat township, individuals or companies who have been allotted plots for setting up IT units or other commercial ventures are obtaining allotment letters by paying the first instalment of the cost of land and then trying to resell the plots illegally. 

 Officials said all such attempts have been foiled.

 Unlike Salt Lake, there is no bar on resale of plots in New Town. ?Any owner can sell his plot to anybody and at any cost without seeking Hidco?s consent. But before a resale, the first buyer will have to get possession of the plot by paying the entire cost and get it registered,?? an official said.

 However, in the cases that have come to Hidco?s notice, most owners are yet to get possession of their plots. 

 The trend was first witnessed in the small-scale IT sector.

 Hidco had allotted 30 acres to 48 small and medium IT companies, but only 18 have paid the price in full and are about to get possession of their plots. The deadline for the payment had expired on March 31, 2006.

 ?We had earmarked 30 acres and asked Webel to give us a list of aspirants who want to set up IT units in New Town,? said Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathi. ?However, most companies on the list do not seem to be interested in getting possession of the plots, as they have not paid the cost. They actually intend to resell the plots by showing the allotment letters to the buyers.?

 Hidco detected the tendency when some applicant companies sought its approval to change the names of their directors. ?The intention was different. They wanted to resell the plots and so tried to include the names of the directors of the companies that are willing to buy them. But the permission was denied to all,? Tripathi pointed out. 

 ?We won?t allow any change in the directorship of any company to which land has been allotted until it gets the plot registered,? he asserted.

Life

 Trend talk for tots

 CAPRIS AMP; CARTOONS, 

 GLARES AMP; GIRLIE GOODIES, THE LITTLE ONES ARE FLAUNTING 

 FADS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. SHRADHA AGARWAL TRACKS THE 

 TOP FIVE

 3/4 pants

 Cargos, denims, printed or plain, three-quarter pants are the top childrens choice at the moment. Perfect to wade into the monsoon waters and make a splash, the capris for little boys and girls are both cute and comfortable.

 Camouflage pants and peppy colours make a great style statement; little women can up their glam quotient further with a sprinkle of sequins.

 Raid the racks at Westside, Pantaloons, Metro Plaza, New Market, Liliput, Freelook?

 PS: Team with solid hued tees and a smart belt for the pants to look even cooler.

 Barbie bests

 Halters, mini-skirts, tube tops, strappy dresses, jeans or shorts? Whatever your little girl likes to sport, there just has to be a bit of Barbie. The Mattel brand has moved beyond dollhouses and entered mainstream fashion. This seasons predominant colour is pretty pink, in all its shades and variations.

 Shiny sequins, floral printed belts and a few surprise frills are some of our favourite things in the collection.

 Check out the full Barbie range at Shoppers Stop. Also look into Little Shop in Forum and Spectrum in Metro Plaza.

 PS: Do check out the Barbie range of accessories ? scooty, strolley and stationery ? to match make a real sweet set.

 Theme shades

 A Bob the Builder tee with Bob the Builder shades, a Barbie frock with Barbie shades ? kids today love their shades to be co-ordinated with their clothes. Not the easiest task or the most economical proposition, but then kids must be kids.

 For clothes that dont have a pair of theme glares, team them with at least same-colour shades. Polka-dotted, shell-framed, aviator-style, engraved and more? The options are endless. Imported from China and Thailand, these shades are available at most stores across the city. Take a trek into Toy Planet at Forum, the GKB outlets and other leading style stops.

 PS: Pick up a neat case for kiddies to keep their shades in!

 Big-dial watches

 No chronometers yet, but studying the style graph, dont be surprised if little boys are soon seen sporting them. For the moment, they are happy with chunky dials. There are entire lines from Casio, Swatch and Timex for boys. Little girls can choose from cute cartoon characters including Powerpuff Girls. 

 Another highlight: the fancy straps. Plastic patterned or washable canvas, simple is certainly not the right term to describe them.

 PS: Most of these fancy watches are not waterproof; teach them to handle with care.

 Zip-up boots

 Butterflies and flowers glittering on little girls feet and superheroes shining on tiny tykes, these colourful shoes are a must-have in the kiddo wardrobe. Available in pastel pinks, yellows, greens, whites and more, these ankle-high boots have an easy zipper by the sides.

 Mostly imported, these shoes are available in New Market and Pantaloons. Priced a little steep it is, but when it comes to your toddlers style statement today, the limit is, well, limitless.

 PS: These ankle-high boots dont really need socks, so dont saddle the kids.

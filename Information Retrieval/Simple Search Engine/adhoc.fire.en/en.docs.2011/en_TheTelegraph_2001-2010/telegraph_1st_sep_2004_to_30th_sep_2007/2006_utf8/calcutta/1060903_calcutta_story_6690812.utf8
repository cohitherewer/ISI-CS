The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Lull, lethargic or strategic

 Much before the festival, the market arrives. While some are biding their time, has the travel trade lost out?

 As the aircraft rolled to the point from where it would start its skyward run, a few innocent flowery bushes on the side of the runway caught my attention. Known as kashphool in Bengali, they announce the arrival of autumn, and thus remind everyone of Durga Puja. Like the kashphool, Puja is still a few weeks away from full bloom. The roads are just about being marked for the erection of the pandals. Idols are being given the first coat of paint in Kumartuli. Puja numbers with their literary fare are just beginning to hit the stands. Yet, like a long-distance train leaving the platform the slow motion is pregnant with promise. The Puja fever is about to gather speed.

 Puja the festival may still be a distant signal, but Puja the market has already arrived. Last year a study was done to estimate the size of the Puja market. The findings suggested that during the month-and-a-half preceding the festival, more than Rs 3,500 crore worth of goods are bought and sold. As one would expect, the largest chunk of Puja spend is on garments. Some have already started their purchases for the Puja and others will soon begin theirs. The advertisers are waiting in the wings soon our daily paper and evening TV will get filled up with ads from textile giants and readymade garment manufacturers. The retail chains and individual outlets will also get into the act. The makers of consumer durables like refrigerator and television will soon enter the fray. The lull is strategic rather than lethargic. They are waiting for the prey to get into the reckless mood. Then they will start their hunt.

 For one group of business, however, 

 this wait could be a week too many. It may come as a surprise 

 to many that after garments, the next big-ticket item on 

 the Puja shopping list is spending on travel. We all know 

 and talk about the passion that people in this city have 

 for travel to all sorts of touristy destinations. Not 

 many amongst us however would have been able to guess what 

 the Puja study told us. During Pujas, as a collective, we 

 spend nearly as much on travel as on clothes! Another interesting 

 aspect of these expenses is that while the actual money 

 is spent during or after the Puja days, the buying decisions 

 are taken earlier. 

 Plans are made much in advance. Train tickets open two months in advance. Hotels are booked as soon as the journey is confirmed.The travel industry has not yet made its presence felt in the media. They have possibly missed out on the opportunity to persuade. People have thus continued to make their choices based on word of mouth or individual initiative to acquire information. In this golden era of consumerism many in Calcutta are still wondering today where they should head for Hardwar or Jaipur with their given budget.

 That is not all. The popular definition of the travel industry confines itself to transportation and hospitality. There is in reality a whole lot of travel-related consumption. From luggage to woollens to handycam, the canvas of travel consumption has become really wide. Rs 500 crore is the estimated expenditure of Calcuttans on Puja travel.

 The travel industry has possibly missed the bus again this year. And the lost opportunity is not only for individual brands but as a collective, they have neglected the chance of demand generation. Even on this Puja holiday, the Sens may carry their battered suitcase, the Banerjees will like last year make do with borrowed woollens, and the Majumdars will stay in the Dharamshala again instead of that highly affordable next-door resort.

 But then, there is always a next time. Hopefully.

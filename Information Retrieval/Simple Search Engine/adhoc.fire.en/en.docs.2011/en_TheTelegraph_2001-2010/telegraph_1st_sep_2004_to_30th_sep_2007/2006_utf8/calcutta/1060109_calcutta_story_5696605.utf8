 Facility revamp for fast food pie 

 Debipada Bhattacharya: There is strong competition in the fast food market. What steps are you taking to keep your competitors at bay?

 We are currently upgrading our central kitchen and storage facilities in Salt Lake. The work should be complete by the end of this month. The chief minister would inaugurate the revamped facility.

 Benfish will soon be the only cooperative undertaking in the state with ISO certification. We are also about to obtain ISI?s HACCP certificate.

 In addition to this, we are investing Rs 80 lakh to set up a laboratory to test raw materials and finished products. The Marine Product Export Development Agency is collaborating with us in this regard.

 We have also appointed a professional processing manager to serve the people better.

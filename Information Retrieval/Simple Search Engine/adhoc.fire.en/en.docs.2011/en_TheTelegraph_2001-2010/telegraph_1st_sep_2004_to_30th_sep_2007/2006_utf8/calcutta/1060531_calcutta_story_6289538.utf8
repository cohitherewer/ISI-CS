 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday directed the state government to ensure that the anti-quota strike by medical students and junior doctors did not hinder the treatment of patients.

 According to a PTI report, a vacation bench comprising Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta and Justice S.P. Mitra ordered the director of state health services to submit a report by June 9 on steps taken to ensure proper treatment of patients in hospitals and whether medicos there had resorted to strike.

 The bench observed that no one had the right to prevent patients from entering hospitals or receiving treatment. It acted on a PIL moved by advocate Idris Ali against denial of healthcare services to patients by the striking medicos.

 Ali alleged that the protesters had prevented patients from entering hospitals.

 Members of Youth for Equality, the national body of agitating medical students and junior doctors, on Tuesday reiterated its decision to continue with the strike. They ran a ?parallel outpatients? department? at Medical College and Hospital during the day.

 ?We are not stopping any patient from visiting the outpatients? departments. Nor are we disrupting the emergency services of the hospital,? said Avrojit Raha, a final-year MBBS student at Medical College and a member of Youth for Equality.

 The Students? Federation of India (SFI) on Tuesday vowed to intensify pressure on the protesters to end the stir.

 ?The Supreme Court?s expression of unhappiness has vindicated our stand. The strike by medical students and junior doctors under the banner of Youth for Equality is a hasty job. A number of patients are suffering due to the strike. We will intensify pressure on the agitators to bring back normalcy to the hospitals,? stated SFI state president Sudip Sengupta.

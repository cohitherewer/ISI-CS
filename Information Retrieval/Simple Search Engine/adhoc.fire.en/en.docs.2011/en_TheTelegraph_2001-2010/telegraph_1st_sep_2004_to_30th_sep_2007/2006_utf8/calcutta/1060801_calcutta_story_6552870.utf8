 Omkara

 Vishal Bhardwaj?s adaptation of Shakespeare?s Othello 

 has UP gangster Omi Shukla (Ajay Devgan) choosing Kesu 

 Firangi (Viveik Oberoi) as his bahubali (successor) and 

 enraging the evil Langda Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan). Convincing 

 Omi that his lady love Dolly (Kareena Kapoor) is having an 

 affair with Kesu, Langda poisons his mind, which in turn leads 

 to destruction all around.

 Just like he did with Macbeth in Maqbool, Bhardwaj 

 is able to achieve the difficult task of remaining true to 

 the Bard while weaving the tragic plot against the mafia backdrop 

 of the UP heartlands. 

 Omkara belongs to Saif. He not only gives Iago a 

 chillingly rational persona but manages to take Langda Tyagi 

 in the league of Bollywood?s best villains like Gabbar Singh, 

 Shakaal and Mocambo.

 Ajay?s Othello is more assertive and the actor underplays 

 his part beautifully. Kareena looks beautiful without the 

 usual layers of pancake and she lends a natural naiveness 

 to Desdemona. Konkona is expectedly effective in her small 

 role.

 Tassaduq Hussain?s cinematography lends the barren terrains 

 of Satara an infectious energy while Bharadwaj?s music breathes 

 romance into the rustic region. 

 Despite using up almost three hours of screen duration, 

 Bhardwaj fails to play up the passion between Omi and Dolly 

 and so when the inevitable occurs, you somehow do not feel 

 the pain.

 The 

 dialect the characters use may be authentic to the region 

 but it is difficult to follow at many places and the liberal 

 usage of expletives may not go down well with the family 

 audience.

 Last word: You 

 do not need to be a Shakespeare freak to enjoy Bhardwaj?s 

 interpretation of Othello. It may not hit you hard enough 

 as a tragedy, but the all-star experience is worth every 

 frame of it.

 The law-keepers themselves are now under the scanner.

 In a bid to identify officers who are rude to people who have come to lodge complaints, the authorities have decided to instal closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in police stations across the city.

 ?Besides video-graphing the officer and the complainant, the conversation between the two will be recorded. The system will preserve the clippings for seven days,? Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner (administration), said on Sunday.

 ?People, including politicians, complain to us that officers misbehave with them at thanas when they go there to lodge a complaint or seek assistance. When we demand an explanation from the officers concerned, they either refuse to furnish one, or blame the complainants for misbehaving with them. The CCTVs will clear this confusion,? Singh added.

 The joint commissioner agreed that at times, complainants, too, have made false allegations. ?Once we complete the project, we will get a clear picture within seconds of what exactly happened,? he pointed out.

 Senior officers said the decision of installing CCTVs is part of the community policing scheme. ?We want people to provide us with information about criminal activities in their neighbourhoods. For this, we need to interact with them politely,? said an officer.

 ?Officers at times demand bribes from complainants. Even if an officer leaves his seat and asks a visitor to follow him, we may suspect that something dubious is going on,? the officer added. A camera will also be installed in the lock-up of every police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bouquet set to return

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cable television viewers in the city serviced by multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable can now hope for a return of channels like STAR One and Disney on their television sets.

 The MSO scored a victory against STAR when the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) ? where the two were locked in a dues dispute ? ruled in its favour on Wednesday.

 Airing of STAR?s second bouquet ? comprising STAR One, Hungama and two Disney channels ? and payment of a seven per cent inflation increment were some of the issues of contention.

 ?According to the TDSAT judgment, we neither have to pay the seven per cent increase nor any amount for the second bouquet, which we stopped airing in December,? said an official of SitiCable, which covers nearly 55 per cent of cable homes in the Calcutta Metropolitan area.

 The tribunal reportedly also asked the two parties to reconcile the due amount keeping in mind operator migration, and work out a solution.

 With the court case out of the way, the channels can now make a comeback on SitiCable. ?There is no objection from our side,? the official added.

 STAR is locked in a similar battle with another city MSO, Manthan, in TDSAT. The STAR beam is currently off-air on Manthan and the case will next be heard on Friday in the Capital.

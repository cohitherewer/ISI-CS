 Rani estate to be rebuilt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Rebuilding the section of Rani Rashmonis property at Janbazar, which collapsed on Wednesday, is on the cards. 

 The reconstruction will start after Kali puja and will cost not less than Rs 20 lakh.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Friday promised a tax relief for the heritage building at 18, SN Banerjee Road if the present owners reconstruct the damaged portion and maintain the building properly.

 The co-sharers and descendants of Rani Rashmoni who live in the sprawling building, at a meeting on Friday, unanimously resolved to take up reconstruction of the damaged portion immediately. 

 The high property tax Rs 18,500 per quarter figured in the meeting. It was decided that we will make an appeal to the mayor and the municipal commissioner to downsize the tax, said Prasun Hazra, a participant in the meeting, on Friday. 

 He said the reconstruction cost has been calculated at about Rs 20 lakh. 

 The co-sharers of the building have agreed to share the expenses from their own coffers. 

 Anuradha Chowdhury occupies the portion at 18/3A, SN Banerjee Road, which collapsed. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said if the family approaches the civic body for technical consultancy and expertise to restore the structure, the civic authorities will extend their support.

 He has directed deputy chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma to submit a report on the condition of the entire structure at 18, SN Banerjee Road.

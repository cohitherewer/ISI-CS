 Bengal potential sways German biz

 The Bengal tiger could turn out to be more adroit than the Indian elephant, after all. At least, the German business delegation from Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony), left Calcutta with enough positive pointers after Friday?s reconnoitre to believe so.

 ?The most important achievement was breaking through the invisible barrier that often isolates the eastern part of India from the rest of the country, blame it on politics or perception,? Walter Hirche, minister for economics, labour and transport of Niedersachsen, told Metro after wrapping up the day?s proceedings.

 Hirche, who led the 45-member, largest-ever German biz team to town, felt the chances of joint ventures and manufacturing bases had brightened considerably following the one-to-one matchmaking sessions with local companies organised by the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (IGCC).

 Responding to state commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen?s ?special interest? in automobile components, Hirche felt chances of German car giants sourcing parts from Bengal were extremely realistic. Even Volkswagen, scouting for more options in India, could have Calcutta on its radar, he observed.

 A 100-sq m stall has been allotted to West Bengal and a ?special day? reserved for the state at the April Hannover Industry Fair. It will be the ?first Indian state? to do a focused presentation on its strengths at the fair and the same honour has been extended to Brand Bengal?s star IT wing at CeBIT, the worlds largest infotech and communications expo, this week.

 ?It?s crucial for Bengal to be present at forums like CeBIT and tell European companies what could be done in Calcutta. Sector V units like Skytech are eloquent examples of how the Indian IT industry has progressed so systematically,? said Wilfried Prewo, chief executive, Hannover Chamber of Industry and Commerce.

 Prewo, who has been in Calcutta ?thrice in the past eight months?, felt the recce trip by the Niedersachsen team has been ?an eye-opener? for the German IT companies. ?Some of them are so excited, they could be back here in the next two months. We have opened the door for these 45 members who could see for themselves the new Calcutta. Now there would be hundreds willing to check out the place,? he smiled.

 The Hannover chamber chief promised to facilitate a delegation from Niedersachsen to Calcutta at least once a year, like the northern German province ? well-endowed in the mobility, food-processing and IT sectors ? does in China. ?I was already convinced of the potential here, and I?m glad many of those who accompanied me on this trip agree this is a good place to do business,? Prewo said.

 His colleague Tilmann Brunner, director, foreign trade in the Hannover chamber, shares Prewo?s exuberance. ?The meetings went off even better than we hoped they would, and this dialogue is a great starting point for concrete alliances. Moreover, compared to say Bangalore, which is getting progressively choked, Calcutta seems to be on a planned growth path,? Brunner pointed out.

 If the IT firms were bullish on business and keen to return to seal deals, Wolfgang Reichelt, chief executive director, BLOCK Transformatoren-Elektronik GmbH amp; Co KG, has already committed a city footprint. ?We will source spherical electrical transformers and ferrite components from Calcutta,? he declared.

 BLOCK is the second largest company of its kind in Germany and a member of the International Electrical Commission. ?We have 500 employees and are experts in maintaining voltage supply quality,? Reichelt said.

 What: 

 Fashion Police by Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi.

 Where: Tantra, The Park.

 When: Friday, post-midnight.

 Take a look: The show lasted all of 15 minutes, providing glimpses of some signature Cue statements. With fast-paced choreography by Meenu and Meetu, the show displayed 30-odd garments by the Delhi-based designer duo. A restricted colour story comprising white, black and red split the show into three distinct sequences.

 The catwalk kicked off with a white line of foil prints and metallic embellishments in gold and silver. The white-and-silver and white-and-gold looks with trademark foil printing, touches of shimmer, applique, cutwork and lacework defined the first sequence.

 A wide array of dresses empire lines, baby doll, asymmetrical flowing and more and skirts in various shapes made up the line.

 A few black-and-white combos gave way to a full black line of super-sexy silhouettes. Ornamentation was minimal here, with more of textures and techniques. Dresses and skirts again were the highlights of the line.

 The show wrapped up with a line in red-and-black. The look here was more structured than the earlier two lines, with body-fitted tops, jackets, corsets teamed with asymmetrical calf-length layered skirts, minis and in-between lengths.

 The first two lines looked fluid and sensuous with georgettes, chiffons and crepes, while the glamorous third collection used jacquard for structure. 

 Puff sleeves, gathers, pleating, quilting and ruching were abundant. For men, the look was super-structured, with short shirts, quilted jackets and slim trousers.

 An edited version of Rahul and Rohits autumn-winter 2006-07 line showcased at the grand finale of the India Fashion Week in Delhi this April, the collection, though impressive, held very few surprises. A skirt with porcelain blue cutwork over ivory underlayer from the duos spring-summer 2007 collection showcased at the recently-concluded India Fashion Week in Delhi was a whiff of fresh air in an otherwise much-seen collection.

 The Kill Bill tune, a sureshot recipe for a rocking show, was too much of a rewind to the Rohit Bal show in Delhi, but it still managed to pep up proceedings.

 Sonalika Sahay, Carol Gracias, Roopa Baid, Anusha Chauhan, Krishna Somani and Arti Sharma shared the bartop ramp at Tantra with city models Jessica, Ishika, Neeraj and Ananda.

 Crowd profile: It sure showed some improvement from the previous editions of Fashion Police. For one, the crowd crush was a little less and so one could breathe a little easier than during the earlier editions. Also, the crowd quality was a shade better than usual.

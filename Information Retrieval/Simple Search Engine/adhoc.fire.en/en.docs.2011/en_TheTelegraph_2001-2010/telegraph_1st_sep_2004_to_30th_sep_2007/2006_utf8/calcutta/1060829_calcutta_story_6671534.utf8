The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The best of his bittersweet tales

 Over four decades, Hrishikesh Mukherjee churned out some real celluloid classics. Metro picks five favourites from the filmography of the man who used to make movies about us

 Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh 

 Khanna in Anand

 Anand

 He didnt want his best friend to die on screen. And so the human being in him overruled the director in him and Mukherjee decided only to dedicate Anand to Raj Kapoor, and not cast him in the title role. Even brother Shashi Kapoor was thought of, but Rajesh Khanna was always destined to wander around the beaches singing Salil Choudhurys immortal composition Zindagi kaisi hai paheli...

 Everyone in the theatres and later in the drawing rooms knew that Anand was going to die in the end but that didnt stop them from shedding those tears. As the telly re-runs come on every second channel, people still want to be his Murarilal and be part of a memorable journey, doomed yet delightful.

 Rajesh Khanna became the face of hope for struggling souls seeking solace. Perhaps no one could say Babumoshay the way Kakaji could. That one call not only melted the stubborn Bhaskar Banerjee (Amitabh Bachchan) but also gave an entire generation of Bengalis a new nickname. And fittingly so, because Babumoshay was Raj Kapoors chosen term of endearment for Mukherjee himself.

 Amol Palekar and 

 Bindiya Goswami in Golmaal

 Golmaal

 You may find people who havent seen the battles of Mughal-e-Azam, the farms of Mother India, the cricket match of Lagaan but its difficult to hunt out someone who hasnt seen Utpal Dutt twirling his moustache and going iiiisshhh in Golmaal.

 If Anand taught the rest of India Babumoshay, Golmaal introduced verbal gems like dant kelane banchharam. Punctuated with delightfully hilarious comic set-pieces, the Utpal Dutt-Amol Palekar cat-and-mouse game with Dina Pathak as a fabulous fake mom has become such a cult comedy with time, that the very playback of the Golmaal hai bhai sab golmaal hai theme spells mischief in the air.

 Some would argue that the Pancham-Kishore Kumar classic Aanewala pal was wasted on an insipid Bindiya Goswami, but then in Amol Palekars own words: Hrishida didnt want to impress the audience with a great shot composition. And perhaps because he just let the song roll, it still hasnt gathered any moss. Neither has the film.

 Hrishikesh Mukherjee

 Chupke Chupke

 If t-o is to, then why isnt g-o goo? Cracked up again? Well, Hrishidas original recipe with its secret blend is no less than what your favourite phuchkawallah conjures up and leaves you craving for more.

 Another case of mistaken identities and another classic! If Dutt and Palekar created Golmaal, a grumpy Om Prakash and a charming Dharmendra orchestrated the funny moments in this irresistible rom com. And the hide-and-seek post-marital romance between Dharmendra and Sharmila Tagore had its own khatta-meetha situations. Even Amitabh and Jaya chipped in with delightful cameos. Chupke Chupke was all the more remarkable on Mukherjees part because the same year saw Amitabh, Dharmendra and Jaya appear in completely different avatars for Ramesh Sippy chapati western Sholay.

 In many ways, Mukherjee was the Hitchcock of comedy. Like Hitchcock would give his audiences the privilege of knowing more than his protagonists thus heightening the suspense, Mukherjee would pass on more information to the viewers allowing them to have a blast at the expense of his characters. Thats why the karela always tasted so much sweeter than the corolla.

 Khoobsurat

 You have drooled over her in Utsav, liked her as Umrao Jaan but as Manju, Rekha was at her adorable best in Khoobsurat. Chirpy, chatty, chulbuli, she was given a complete image makeover after her Khoon Pasina and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar days. Her nemesis? A hard as nails Dina Pathak. Just like he did with Palekar-Dutt and Om Prakash-Dharmendra, Mukherjee plays with physical extremes creating both a tonal and visual contrast.

 If Amelie took the world by storm in 2001 by helping suffering souls, Rekhas Manju did it two decades back, and how. Bringing relief to a Hitler home, she breezed through, winning hearts and changing lives. And what better way than the Saare niyam tod do track signalling the winds of change. Another instance of Mukherjee using home truths to lay bare social inconsistencies.

 In 1985, with an almost similar theme and cast in Jhoothi, Mukherjee tried to repeat the Khoobsurat success and salvage a sagging career just like he would try later with the Golmaal reworking in Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kate. But the beauty of Khoobsurat, like Golmaal, lay in its spontaneity and not even the man himself could recreate it.

 Amitabh and Jaya in Abhimaan

 Abhimaan

 There have been rave reviews on how KANK has brought taboo topics out of the closet. But in 1973, when Mukherjee explored the fatal fallacies of the male ego, he was easily breaking new grounds by giving cinematic voice to unspoken home truths. Yes, it took off from the 1954 James Mason-Judy Garland classic A Star is Born but Hrishida gave Abhimaan his signature stamp by weaving the plot around SD Burmans evergreen music. Theres even a Ramayana parallel to the tale in how Amitabhs Subir casts aspersions on the integrity of Jayas Uma and an intriguing extra-marital sub-plot with Bindu. The redemption may be very filmi but a fitting finale to two stars who exchanged vows the same year.

 In the recent past, movies like Naach and Sur have tried to take a fresh look at the man-woman ego war but have not struck the right chord. You can remake a Sholay or a Don but not an intimate tale like Abhimaan.

 They just dont make em like 

 you any more, Hrishida.

 This is our selection, straight 

 from the heart. If you feel strongly about any other Hrishikesh 

 Mukherjee film that should have made it to this list, please

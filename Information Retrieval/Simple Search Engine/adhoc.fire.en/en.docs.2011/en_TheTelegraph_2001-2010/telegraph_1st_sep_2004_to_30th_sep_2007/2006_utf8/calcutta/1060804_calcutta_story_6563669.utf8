 Being staged as part of Rabindra Utsav, a festival of Tagores plays in multilingual interpretations, Raja is a deeply philosophical story that questions conventional notions of beauty, love and fidelity. The Malayalam version of the play is a unique exercise in which words, phrases and metaphors do not signify a specific objective phenomenon as in other forms of literature. Instead, they function as profound symbols with multiple layers of meaning. There is an essential natyadharmi quality about the poetic interludes in the play, which is an integral part of Tagores style of storytelling. Moreover, native rhythm and cadence have been used in recreating the songs in Malayalam. Not an exhaustive or exact literary translation of the original text, it builds up its own chronological sequences to probe into its core, formless content. The layers woven by the parable have to be broken into to grasp its inner energy. Direction: K.N. Panikkar. Hosted by the department of information and cultural affairs, government of West Bengal, Airtel Expressions and Happenings.

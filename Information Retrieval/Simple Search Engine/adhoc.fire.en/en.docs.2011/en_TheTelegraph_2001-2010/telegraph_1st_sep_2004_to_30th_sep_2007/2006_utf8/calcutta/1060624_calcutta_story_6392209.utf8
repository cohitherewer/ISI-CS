 Ready to take over

 - Hrithik starrer breaks snub pact of plexes

 Hrithik Roshan in Krrish: Here comes the son

 The thought of Rehan Qadri romancing Zooni Beg at a standalone theatre has helped Krishna become Krrish at two multiplexes out of four in town.

 For, the Hrithik Roshan-starrer proved big enough to vault the distributor-multiplex divide over revenue sharing? that had forced Fanaa to open only at single-screeners ? and break the pact of the plexes.

 With the standalone theatres raking it in with the Aamir-Kajol love saga, national distributors Yash Raj managed to convince INOX ? as late as Thursday afternoon ? to screen Rakesh Roshan?s Rs 50-crore sequel to Koi? Mil Gaya from Friday, and that too, eight shows each at Forum and City Centre.

 ?Like during Fanaa, this time also, it has been a decision at the national level and all the properties in our chain are playing Krrish,? revealed Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum).

 But the no-show for Bollywood biggies continues at Fame (Hiland Park) and 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi). While the other Fame properties across the country are playing Krrish, its Calcutta four-screener has given the mega release a miss.

 ?We have come in with a total of 30 prints in Bengal and the response till now has been phenomenal,? said Harsh Manchanda, Bengal distributor for Krrish. ?As of now, the single screens like Hind, Jyoti and Mitra are doing better than the plexes because the advances opened earlier but the INOX screens are bound to catch up.?

 The three-hour-plus superhero caper is already attracting block booking from companies like Blue Dart, Birla Sunlife and UTI Bank at INOX. The standalone theatres are eyeing a Fanaa encore, and more. 

 ?The Krrish opening has been as good as Fanaa,? revealed a spokesperson for Hind, where a weekend balcony ticket is tagged at Rs 150.

 The hype surrounding the sequel to the super hit Koi? Mil Gaya, in which ?the son will rise? as a superhero, peaked on Thursday evening with a special star-studded preview at PVR (Juhu) in Mumbai. Papa Rakesh Roshan was a tense man, cellphone glued to his ear.

 But with the Friday openings being described as ?phenomenal? and a rising clamour for Krrish merchandise, son Hrithik Roshan?s ?birth of a superhero? ? that?s how he defined Krrish in Singapore earlier this week ? looks poised to hit a healthy growth curve. ?This guy can be a superhero. By the time the film ends, this man is ready to take on the world,? Hrithik added.

 For now, he has to take on the Bollywood box office.

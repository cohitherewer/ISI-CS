 Indias first floating hotel was all set to welcome guests on board in style. At the entrance was a traditional welcome with flower rangoli and diyas along the way. It was a smart Navy dress code for the crew members.

 The Compass Room, the Indian speciality sizzler restaurant, was converted into the venue that extended to the deck. The pleasant evening breeze, soft watery ripples and the illuminated Howrah bridge added up to make the ambience quite magical.

 Sip n bite: The elaborate spread included Subz Kurkuri, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Tandoori Prawn, Smoked Chicken Achari Tikka Tarts along with wine, juices and more.

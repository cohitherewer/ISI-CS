 B-school alumni meets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It?s raining alumni meets, with two of India?s premier management institutes, IIM Calcutta and Lucknow, determined to round off their summer break with an evening of fun and frolic and social messages.

 IIM Calcutta celebrated its annual alumni meet, Nostalgia 2006, at Bengal Club on May 14, with around 70 alumni and faculty members of the Joka campus in attendance. 

 Hosted by a group of summer interns, the evening brought back memories of hostel life for the alumni spread across 41 batches.

 IIMC Alumni Association chairman Mrinmoy Roy, from the fourth batch, said: ?We look forward to this event, where we get to know about what is happening in our alma mater. The younger crowd reminds us of our golden days in the institute.? Roy is now executive director of SAIL. 

 Anindya Sen, dean, programme initiatives, gave an insight into the development activities on campus. 

 He talked about the new hostel coming up and the new batch of students who are going to join next month.

 IIM Lucknow, too, celebrated its alumni get-together on Saturday. 

 While the attendance might not have been too impressive, the freshers organising the event and the alumni made sure that the evening was one to remember.

 ?It?s always nice to meet your seniors and those who have passed out well before we joined the institute. An alumni meet is the perfect platform to interact with them and learn quite a bit how they faced challenges thrown at them,? said an IIM Lucknow student.

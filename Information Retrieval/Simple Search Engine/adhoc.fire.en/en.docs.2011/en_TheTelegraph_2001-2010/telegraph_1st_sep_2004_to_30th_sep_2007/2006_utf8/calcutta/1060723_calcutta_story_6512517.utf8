The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Farmhouse for 

 sale, at market online

 techtalk

 For 

 those still wary of shopping online, here is a farmhouse 

 for thought. Jammu resident Madhushree Singh has listed 

 online a farmhouse and land for sale in Rajasthan?s Nawalgarh. 

 The starting price: Rs 11.30 crore!

 This makes the 79,000 sq m plot, 

 with a farmhouse, the most expensive item ever listed on 

 eBay India. The entry has received over 2,200 unique visitors 

 till date.

 A premier online marketplace, 

 eBay was launched in India in 2000. The portal was earlier 

 known as Baazee.com.

 The house, located in the heart 

 of Nawalgarh town, has a commanding view and overlooks the 

 farm from a height of 35-40 feet. The property was once 

 used as an outhouse and farm by the erstwhile rulers of 

 Nawalgarh.

 Says Madhushree Singh: ?I have 

 inherited the farmhouse and due to financial challenges 

 would like to dispose of it and pick up a place in the city. 

 The response on eBay has been amazing. I have received more 

 than 100 offers and most of them are from the US. In India, 

 I was contacted by buyers from Delhi, Mumbai and Jaipur.?

 ?Being married to an army officer, 

 I have to move every two years. Selling on eBay is convenient 

 as I am able to manage my shop from the remotest part of 

 the country and at the same time reach out to international 

 buyers,? she adds.

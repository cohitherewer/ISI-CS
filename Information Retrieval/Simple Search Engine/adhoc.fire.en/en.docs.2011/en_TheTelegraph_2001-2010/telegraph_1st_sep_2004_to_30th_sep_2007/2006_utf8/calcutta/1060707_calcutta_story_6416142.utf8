 Targets both: The 

 Lake, a haunt of snatchers: (below) policemen as protectors, 

 not protected 

 Apropos the report ?Biz boost 

 beckons recruiter?, May 24, even a decade back, recruitment 

 through agencies was rare in the state. Along with information 

 technology companies, employment agencies have since proliferated 

 in Bengal and are doing brisk business. But if my cousin?s 

 bitter experience is anything to go by, their mode of functioning 

 leaves much to be desired. 

 It is natural that the employment agencies will charge a fee from the companies that appoint them, but why are they also asking for money from the people they employ? The state government should see to it that the agencies do not charge exorbitant rates from job-seekers or take them for a ride. 

 The recruitment agencies seldom write to a job-seeker asking him or her to appear for an interview. Instead, they call up the candidates. Several agencies place advertisements in newspapers without mentioning their addresses. 

 Queries about the company the agencies are representing and the salary being offered are seldom answered. After the selected candidate joins work, he or she often finds the pay package promised by the employment agency to be misleading. Vital terms and conditions of the job are also withheld from the applicants by the employment agencies. 

 For the sake of transparency and to prevent foul play, companies themselves should issue advertisements seeking employees. All important information should be mentioned in the advertisements. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the reports ?Peril at lake placid? and ?Teasers attack brave cop?, May 26, eve-teasing and snatching have become commonplace in Calcutta. It is a matter of concern that criminals are attacking even policemen who put up a resistance. Plainclothesmen should be posted outside schools and colleges and in parks. Morning-walkers, on their part, should leave even their watches at home and venture out in groups. A reason for the increase in such incidents is that bystanders are afraid to protest. We should not forget our social obligation. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 It is frightening that snatchers 

 and eve-teasers are at work at Dhakuria Lake at dawn. If 

 the administration does not wake up, people would stop going 

 there for morning walks. Consequently, the Lakes would become 

 a den of criminals. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala. 

 The report underlines the dangers 

 faced by elderly morning-walkers at Rabindra Sarobar. The 

 crimes depict the cops in poor light. Thanks to them, the 

 senior citizens are being deprived of one of the pleasures 

 of leisure. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road.

 No praise is enough for policeman 

 Niren Chatterjee. The harassment of a woman in broad daylight 

 in Tallah Park is worrying. But the fact that the guilty 

 attacked a policeman is positively shocking. If a cop is 

 beaten up by a criminal, one can well imagine the fate of 

 the common people. The criminals are emboldened by the knowledge 

 that most of their brethren escape the clutches of the law. 

 The lumpen culture of the cowbelt is steadily making inroads 

 into Bengal. The top brass of police needs to ensure that 

 the culprits are punished befittingly. 

 Kajal Chatterjee, 

 Sodepur.

 The article, ?Whither the Other Direction??, June 12, is riddled with errors. ?Installations by four artists associated with Rabindra Bharati? who, at some point of time, were associated with Rabindra Bharati.? 

 Sanchayan Ghosh has no associations with Rabindra Bharati University. Besides, the institutional associations implied in the article are objectionable because we are exhibiting in our capacity as individual practising artists and not by virtue of our institutional affiliations. 

 ?? the supposedly more progressive Rabindra Bharati University cannot think of anything but installations.? 

 Birla Academy invited us to exhibit installations. So the question of thinking otherwise did not arise. 

 And installation is not part of Rabindra Bharati?s curriculum. 

 ? ? the four serve up ideas surely tired of being recycled?? ?and last but not the least, borrowed ideas?. 

 These statements fall barely short of accusing the artists of plagiarism. If such an accusation is being levelled, it must also be justified by adequate proof. Else readers are misled. 

 Sanchayan Ghosh?s work is a documentation of an ongoing community activity. If community art as a practice is a ?borrowed idea? or tools such as video, animation, or digital prints are looked upon as a ?borrowed? language, this sense of ?borrowedness? extends to every language. No language originates on its own. 

 The use of the offensive expression ?Ingo-Bongo? to describe the anglicised nature of a household is in poor taste. 

 Adip Dutta has been in the profession for five years and not 10 as mentioned. 

 As artists we register our protest against the review. 

 Paula Sengupta, Adip Dutta, 

 Sanchayan Ghosh, 

 Debanjan Roy,Short Street.

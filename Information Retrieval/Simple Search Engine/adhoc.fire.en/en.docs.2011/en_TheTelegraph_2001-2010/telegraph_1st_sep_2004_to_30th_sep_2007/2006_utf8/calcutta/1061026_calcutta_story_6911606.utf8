 After several false starts, renovation of the Kalighat temple has finally got underway. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) started work about a fortnight ago. 

 The temple committee is no longer creating a hurdle. We have started constructing an administrative building outside the temple. We will then take up the work on the premises, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 The first phase of the project also includes setting up of 26 kiosks, and redevelopment and restoration of the temple.

 The expenditure has been estimated at Rs 79 crore, of which the Centre has provided its share of Rs 5 crore to the state tourism department which, in turn, will hand over the money to the CMC. The rest of the funds will come from International Foundation for Sustainable Development (IFSD), an organisation of NRIs.

 We have already given Rs 1 crore to the CMC to start construction of the administrative building. We will release the rest of the money as and when required, said tourism department secretary G.D. Gautama.The temple committee will meet officials of the tourism department, IFSD and the CMC in October-end to finalise plans for the development of the temple premises.

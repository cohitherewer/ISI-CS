 A tragic vengeance

 A play that takes Shakespeares Hamlet and places it in the present socio-political context, Hemlat The Prince of Garanhata offers a hard-hitting critique of the extreme ineptitude, indifference and coldly violent attitudes of the present generation. As in the original, the protagonists father, Sadhan, has been murdered by his uncle, Kadu. Kadu, who now lives with Hemlats mother, Manorama, runs a catering business and is trying to sell the family home to real estate developers, on terms most favourable to him. Other residents of Garanhata include Hemlats childhood sweetheart, Shefalia, her drunkard father, Paul, the local councillor, Sukhen and a cluster of other characters who are passively waiting for an end to their daily trials and the dawn of a new day. The plot thickens when the ghost of Hemlats father suddenly appears, making events rush towards their predestined end. Drama, direction and acting: Bratya Basu.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Hemlat The Prince of Garanhata, produced by Swapnasuchana 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Madhusudan Mancha

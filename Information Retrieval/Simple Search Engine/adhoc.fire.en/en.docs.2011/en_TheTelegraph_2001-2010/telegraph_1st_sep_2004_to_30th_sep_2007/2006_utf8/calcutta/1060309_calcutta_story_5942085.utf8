 The blasts in Varanasi that killed at least 15 people have prompted the police to bolster security around city temples. 

 Officers of the anti-terrorist cell of the detective department and the special branch have joined hands to keep a watch on the temple premises and the areas around them.

 The move to strengthen security was initiated after an alert from Delhi was conveyed to the police commissioner on Tuesday night. The divisional deputy commissioners and other senior officers were immediately informed about the alert.

 ?The safety net has been fortified as a precautionary measure,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma on Wednesday. ?Plainclothesmen are monitoring the entry and exits to the temples. They have been asked to be on the lookout for those acting suspiciously.?

 The Kalighat and Dakshineswar temples are on top of the police protection list.

 ?We are even monitoring the roads that lead to the Dakshineswar temple. Policemen are keeping an eye on the nearby railway stations,? stated superintendent of North 24-Parganas police Praveen Kumar.

 Similar measures have been adopted at Kalighat.

 Policemen have also been deployed at Lake Kalibari, the Swaminarayan, Lakshminarayan and Jain temples.

 ?At least 10 policemen have been posted at each of the temples. The police stations, under whose jurisdiction the temples fall, have also been asked to deploy their men on the premises,? said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 A detective department officer elaborated on the surveillance measures: ?The devotees will not notice the policemen at a glance. But the cops on duty are all armed with nine mm pistols and revolvers.?

 The entry and exit points of the city are also being manned, especially at night.

 ?Vehicles passing through strategic points like the Park Circus-Eastern Metropolitan Bypass connector, Ultadanga and Kasba connectors are being checked. The policemen have been provided with metal detectors and arms for the purpose,? added the officer.

 Calcutta Police is also in touch with its counterparts in North 24-Parganas, Nadia and Murshidabad to keep a tab on suspected terrorists. 

 ?These three districts are known to be gateways to India from Bangladesh,? elaborated an officer of the anti-terrorist cell. 

 ?Both the central and state intelligence departments have reported that intruders, including ISI operatives, are entering the country through the districts,? he pointed out.

 The Border Security Force (BSF), too, is helping the cops. ?The BSF has been asked to intensify its vigil. It is clear that if we want to keep Calcutta safe, the surveillance on the India-Bangladesh border has to be strengthened,? observed a senior officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A new look, inside out

 Stage On amp; Off

 Moment from Ethnomedia?s 

 Ron 

 Non-resident Bengalis are all 

 too happy living out the great American dream, aren?t they? 

 A New Jersey stage production with an all-Bengali cast told 

 a very different story.

 Ron, a bilingual play in 

 English and Bengali that was staged on Tuesday as part of 

 the Ganakrishti Natyotsav at Rabindra Sadan, portrayed the 

 confusion and crisis lying at the core of the probashi 

 (non-resident) Bangali in the US.

 ?We have shown two generations 

 of non-resident Bengalis and the clash of values between 

 them ? issues of loyalty towards one homeland, conflict 

 of values and the confusion of where one should be. These 

 are our problems and they are more pronounced in Bengalis 

 who have been living in the US for the past 30-35 years,? 

 says theatre group Ethnomedia?s founder member Sudipta Bhawmik 

 who has scripted and directed Ron.

 Ethnomedia was formed in 2002 

 with theatre-loving people from the fields of IT, finance 

 and business, with Bhawmik, who had migrated to the US in 

 the late 1980s, at the helm. The IIT Kharagpur alumnus, 

 now working with an IT firm in New Jersey, had once trained 

 in theatre under Saoli Mitra.

 Ron begins with a Bengali 

 family settled in America faced with a crisis when the only 

 son decides to join the US army. ?Ron, (shortened version 

 of Ronobir), is deployed in Iraq triggering confusion among 

 his parents who still feel Indian at heart. They are overwhelmed 

 by a sense of guilt for having fled their homeland,? explains 

 Bhawmik, heading a team of actors who make time every week 

 to gather for rehearsals.

 Ron was first staged at 

 the South Asian Theatre Festival in the US. Before that, 

 Ethnomedia had staged Kalshuddhi at the New York 

 Fringe Festival where it was ?lapped up by the Bengali audience 

 that included Jhumpa Lahiri?.

 ?Till now we have done four productions 

 on our lives,? says Bhawmik, who stresses that there is 

 an active Bengali theatre culture in the US, with groups 

 like Epic Actors? Workshop working on classical plays. ?But 

 there are financial constraints, like elsewhere. All of 

 us pool in and raise funds through advertisements and sponsorships 

 to stage a production.?

 Bhawmik feels Ethnomedia has been 

 able to strike a chord among the non-resident Bengali youth, 

 though finding young actors for Bengali theatre is not so 

 easy.

 New York-based Amitav Roy, who 

 plays 25-year-old Ron in the play, had his first brush with 

 acting with this play. ?Time is a factor but I want to do 

 more theatre in Bengali. It has been great,? says the computer 

 science graduate.

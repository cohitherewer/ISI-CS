 Mughlai rules, okay? In July, seafood special Porto Rio gave way to it. And in September, Chinese-Italian address China Bistro was gobbled up by it.

 This Puja, diners off Park Street are being treated to Arsalan cuisine where China Bistro used to be. The kitchen at 119A, Muzaffar Ahmed Street, that served up pastas and noodles, is now dishing out biryani, chaap and kebabs for 150 covers.

 It is any restaurateurs dream to own a property around Park Street. After the success of our two outlets (at Park Circus and Circus Avenue), we have brought a taste of authentic Mughlai cuisine to the citys food hub, says Akhtar Parvez, director, RAA Arsalan Enterprises.

 This is the second new outlet of Arsalan in two months. The four-year-old chain, which started from 191, Park Street (Park Circus roundabout) in October 2002, took over 28, Circus Avenue from Porto Rio in July this year. 

 The Muzaffar Ahmed Street (China Bistro) address even has a banquet hall to be given out for small parties and conferences. The menu includes everything that is synonymous with the Arsalan platter. 

 It will be the same food that is served at our Park Circus outlet. Even the prices will remain the same, promises Akhtar.

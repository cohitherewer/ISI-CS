The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Sean Connery

 The harder you work and the busier your schedule, the happier you are. Your social insight and group awareness help you succeed in any career you choose. Youre particular about savings but generous on occasions. You have a strong desire to prove yourself and youre willing to take the risk. You detest a dull, normal and easy life. Sometimes moody, you can be a charming and romantic lover. Kusum Bhandari

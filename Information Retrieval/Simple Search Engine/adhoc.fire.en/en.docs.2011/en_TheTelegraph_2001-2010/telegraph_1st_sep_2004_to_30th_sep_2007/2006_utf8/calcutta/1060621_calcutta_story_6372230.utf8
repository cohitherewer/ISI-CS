 IT boom under scanner

 - Govt wants plot-by-plot report card from industry

 BISWAJIT ROY

 It is time to take stock of IT (information technology). In a move to measure progress in the sector, the state government has initiated a three-pronged review of reality bytes.

 This comes in the wake of a rising clamour from IT players for land at concessional rates in the Rajarhat area, and the mounting pressure on the government to prove that acquisition of farmland has begun delivering the desired results (read, jobs).

 Housing minister Goutam Deb, seen by the IT sector as the stumbling block to lowering land rates in Rajarhat, has demanded a plot-by-plot report card. ?IT-ITES industry is the largest recipient of government-acquired land so far in Rajarhat, and it continues to be top priority for us. But the progress made by IT companies is not satisfactory. It is not possible for the government to keep doling out land for companies to leave it barren. So, we will conduct a land-use review shortly,?? said Deb.

 The minister was also unimpressed by the number of jobs generated by the IT sector till date. ?These companies assured me of creating 1,000 jobs per acre of land. Going by that, more than a lakh jobs should have been created by now,?? he observed.

 New IT minister Debesh Das, too, has called a meeting of the 40 small IT units located in Rajarhat for a ?status report?. This follows a prod from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has urged Das to focus on IT-specific special economic zones while conveying a message to investors that ?the government would not like them to develop real estate instead of IT units?.

 Das, however, was optimistic about the job count in the sector. ?The BPOs, IPOs as well as call centres located in our 13 software parks and around them have already created around 42,000 jobs,?? he said.

 The review, meanwhile, is not restricted to Rajarhat. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya has got into the act by slapping showcause notices on several units ? including IT ? in Sector V, Salt Lake, for non-use of land.

 The initial reaction from the industry was mixed. ?The government has doled out land at concessional rates. It is up to the companies to grow and provide employment figures,? said S. Radhakrishnan, managing director, Descon.

 Another senior officer with a Sector V company took a different position: ?This is quite a startling development. The government must have a long-term perspective rather than a short-term view.?

 Voiceover: Tunics happen to be quite an international favourite at the moment and at Impulse they can be seen in funky patchwork, pin-tucks or happy prints. These tunics are then worked upon with Swarovski, beads, stones and sequins. Worn either with churidar or with denim capris, they are sure to make an individualist fashion statement, says the designer duo from Delhi.

 Cotton call 

 What: Exhibition by Akriti. 

 Where: Genesis Gallery at 8B, Middleton Street. 

 When: Till April 5. 

 The collection: Handloom and other natural, easy-breathing fabrics form a major part of the exhibition. Highlights are indigenous usage of khadi, vegetable dyes and kalamkari prints with a special emphasis on applique. Multi-coloured sequins and other metallic embellishments act as ornamentation in the collection. 

 On display is a range of patialas, kurtis, skirts and suits. The colour palette is vibrant, comprising happy hues like pinks, oranges and aqua tones teamed with classic ivory.

 Pocket pinch: Prices begin at Rs 1,500.

 Voiceover: Cottons may look very simple but you can do wonders if you treat the fabric well. The entire idea is to make an ordinary thing look extraordinary and therein lies the beauty of design concepts. A humble fabric can form a part of a trousseau if handled well, says designer Rita Khurana, who retails from her studio in Neelkamal building at 41, Elgin Road.

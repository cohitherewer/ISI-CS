The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Navin Nischol 

You are a fighter, ready to do anything under the sun, throwing in your body, mind and soul. But you tend to lose energy in the process. You are optimistic. You know how to say the right thing at the right time. You love helping people in distress. You are careful about your finances and understand its significance. Try moving away from trouble.

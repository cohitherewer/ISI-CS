 What: Shake your XXX with DJ Josey Kray and DJ Legacy from the UK.

 Where: Tantra at The Park.

 When: Friday night.

 The show: This was a shade different from the usual DJ nights where the table turner churns out commercial tracks and the party people groove away to glory. For, there was a cause attached to the entertainment here. The DJ duo had come with the objective of spreading awareness about HIV/AIDS amongst the Friday night crowd. They had been brought down by the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society. So, before moving to the console, Josey and Legacy hosted a brief workshop with city DJs, asking them to spread the message in their respective clubs.

 The performance at Tantra started with free distribution of condoms, T-shirts and red bands among the guests. The DJs even explained to the youngsters the virtues of sticking to one partner.

 Voiceover: Youngsters who come to discs pay a lot of attention to what a DJ says. So, its our responsibility to spread awareness about AIDS, said the duo.

 E-sounds

 What: Performance by Jalebee Cartel, an electronic band from Delhi.

 Where: Venom, the newly opened nightclub in Fort Knox.

 When: Friday night.

 The band: The hardcore electronic band has Arjun Vagale on turntables and laptop, DJ Ash on percussion (tabla and djembe) and turntables, DJ Madhav on the electronic drums and Ashvin Mani Sharma on the laptop and synthesiser. The electronic beats kept the guests ? author Shobhaa De among them ? on their feet and the live element added to the excitement. Out of all the compositions, Vande Mataram drew maximum cheers.

 Voiceover: A fully electronic band is a new concept in Calcutta. Our effort would be to bring more such concepts to the city, said Bunty Sethi, owner of Venom.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Check in early for airport bag scan 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Want to catch a flight from Calcutta airport in the next few days? Be sure to reach 15 to 30 minutes earlier than usual and head straight for security check, after check-in, if you want to avoid a delay.

 With a red alert at every airport in the wake of the Mumbai blasts, security has been stepped up at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. Passengers, as a result, are being put through a thorough ? and prolonged ? security check.

 ?Visitors? entry has been banned at the airport from Thursday and security has been beefed up,? said airport director V. K. Monga. 

 The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has instructed all airlines to strictly implement security guidelines laid down by the Bureau for Civil Aviation Security. According to airline officials and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, the hand baggage of each passenger is being checked twice.

 ?Under special instructions, the hand baggage is being checked manually after the X-ray scanning by CISF,? said an official of a private airline. Every airline has also been asked to restart ladder-point checking, just before boarding the flight.

 ?To save unnecessary delays, we appeal to passengers not to carry items banned under the aviation security guidelines,? officials said. (See box.)

 The CISF, on its part, has stepped up vigil. ?Anti-hijacking and anti-sabotage measures have been heightened and manpower augmented at access points of the airport,? revealed a senior official.

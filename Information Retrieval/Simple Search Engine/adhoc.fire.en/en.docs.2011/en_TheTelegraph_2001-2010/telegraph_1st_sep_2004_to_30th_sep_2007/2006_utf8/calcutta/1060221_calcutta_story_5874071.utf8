 Hospital trouble

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Trouble broke out at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Monday evening, following the death of a patient.

 Chandi Rani Santra, 43, was admitted to the hospital on February 17 when she was profusely bleeding through her nose. She was undergoing treatment at the hospital?s female medicine ward.

 Santra died while she was being taken from the medicine ward to the ENT ward for examinations on Monday. 

 Her relatives alleged that she died owing to the negligence of doctors and the hospital staff. ?She was being taken from one ward to another, but the doctors could not diagnose the disease. She was very ill and collapsed because she was being dragged to so many departments,? a relative alleged. They filed a complaint at Tallah police station.

 A team of policemen reached the hospital to bring the situation under control. ?The patient?s relatives quarrelled with the doctors. Things are under control now,? said an officer of the police station. 

 Hospital superintendent K. Roy said the authorities were looking into the matter. ?This is an unfortunate incident. But there was no negligence on the part of the doctors,? Roy claimed.

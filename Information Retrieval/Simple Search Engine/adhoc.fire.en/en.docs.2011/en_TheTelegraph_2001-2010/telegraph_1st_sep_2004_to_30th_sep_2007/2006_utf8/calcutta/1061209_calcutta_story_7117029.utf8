 Anyone who doubted Calcuttas 

 interest in theatre needed to be there, at the Sixth Paschim 

 Banga Natyamela held from November 23-30 across six venues. 

 People were willing to stand and watch for hours, be it at the open-air Gyanesh Mancha, at Sisir Mancha or on the stuffy top floor of Gaganendra Pradarshashala. 

 Madhusudan Mancha drew serpentine queues and even the giant Rabindra Sadan had a healthy turnout, most evenings.

 The plays for children were more popular and many groups showed amazing finesse, like Kaali Prasanna O Ora by Samathat, Hooghly, and Bonku Babur Bondhu by Swapnasandhani.

 Some audience members like Piyali Sen were uncomfortable with the experiments by Prabir Guha and his Alternative Living Theatre on November 26. Its too much to have a rape enacted and then feel strips of the victims sari falling on our lap, she shuddered. With Dhushar Pandulipi this group was introducing Theatre of Feeling where the audience is to experience part of the performance with eyes shut.

 A play-reading session on the 

 final day had Mohit Chattopadhyay, Arun Mukhopadhyay and 

 Manoj Mitra reading out from their new plays.

 Three-act treat

 Stagecraft turns 20 this year. 

 The troupe weathered testing times of late, staging no plays 

 in the last three years. So its comeback bill sounds tentative, 

 comprising three one-act scripts by rather obscure American 

 authors, held together by the theme of failing relationships. 

 After performances in Gyan Manch and Padatik, it reached 

 American Center this month.

 The first two, both from The Best Short Plays of 1975, seem dated now. In Robert Kimmel Smiths A Little Dancing, a son (Kabir Bhandari) comes home and his mother, while talking to him, insists on trying out a joint of grass that she knows he smokes. The writing belongs squarely to flower-power days, but Rajshree Gaggar expresses well the part of the stereotypical loving Jewish mother and her ambivalence towards her unseen husband.

 David Trainers The Curators Proposal seems old-fashioned from the stylistic angle of absurdism. A man compulsively obsessed with his art collection meets a curator introduced by his wife (Sudeshna Chatterjee); the stranger makes him a macabre proposal of preserving his paintings as well as him for posterity. Rohit Pombra acts too laidback as the collector, but Amit Dutt fits the character of the bizarre curator.

 The best of the trio is the last, Jeffrey Sweets Stops along the Way. A teacher is driving his former student, with whom he has had an affair gone sour, back to her husband. She tries her futile best to rekindle their spark in the course of the journey home. Perceptively, director Pombra reserves his best performers for this exploration of raw emotion. Chrys DidierSerre and Rajrupa Chakravarty bring their experience to bear on the roles, though their relatively similar ages make the teacher-student difference somewhat difficult to believe.

H.K. Dutta,

Shibpur 

England is the team of my choice in the 2006 World 

Cup. For the past few World Cups, I have been eagerly awaiting an English triumph, 

but luck has never been with the team. The ?hand of God? goal by Maradona was 

the unkindest cut of all. I am confident Rooney will recover from his injury and 

play a major role in the semi-final and final of the Cup. 

Ujjal Bhattacharya,

I will support Brazil in the World Cup. The five-time 

world champions rule the football world. No true lover of the game can ignore 

the dynamism of the squad. The strength of the Brazilian defence inspires confidence 

in the team?s prospects. A talented crop of midfielders will feed the best forward 

line in the world with balls aplenty. Assuming there are no mishaps, the boys 

from Brazil will taste glory once again.

Tuli Das, 

Salt Lake 

My choice will always be Team India. Indians have 

always been inspirational and continue to enthral the world with the expected 

and the unexpected. I ardently hope that India manages to win the World Cup one 

day.

Md. Sarfaraz Alam,

Kamarhati 

My favourite team is Germany and I think it will win 

the World Cup. History tells us that Germany has always done well in the tournament. 

This time, it will convert the home advantage to a victory.

N. Datta Roy, 

Belur 

Though Germany, Brazil, England and Argentina are 

equally good, the home team is in the best position to kiss the Cup on July 9 

because of its excellent team spirit and great fire power.

A. Bose Chowdhury,

Barrackpore 

I am not in agreement with those who believe that 

Argentina or Italy or Germany or the eternal favourite Brazil will lift the World 

Cup. The team that plays well throughout the tournament, has a strong reserve 

bench and benefits from a bit of luck would emerge victorious. Personally, I would 

love to see one of the minnows or the underdogs continue beyond the occasional 

upset and emerge as the world champion.

D. Chakraborty,

Cossipore 

Though it is difficult to make a prediction about 

the World Cup, I would say without hesitation that Brazil is the favourite. Instead 

of playing tough football, the Brazilians create magic with their feet. Almost 

all members of the squad are experienced and adept at scoring goals. 

Sourish Misra,

Salt Lake 

Though I am a supporter of Argentina, I think Brazil 

will win this World Cup. The team has the maximum number of top-class players, 

and all of them are in good form. They suffer from no injury problems and there 

is good understanding between the players and the coach. 

A.F.K. Ahmed,

Bandpur, Hooghly 

Brazil will easily win the World Cup. It has a prodigiously 

talented pool of players and can withstand pressure from the opposition. Most 

importantly, the Brazilian strikers are the best in the world. Even the country?s 

second team is capable of winning tournaments. Most of the other good teams have 

only one brilliant player in their ranks, which is not good enough to carry them 

through the tournament. Brazil is also a team which commits very few fouls. 

Chandan Ray, 

Sakuntala Park 

England is my favourite team in the 2006 World Cup. 

It has a wonderful defence with Campbell and Cole. The best midfielder of all 

ages is David Beckham, ably aided by Lampard. Owen and Rooney comprise a lethal 

forward line. 

S. Chakrabarty,

Unique Park 

Of course, Brazil. Apart from exceptional skills, 

the team has the ability to rise to big matches. And Ronaldinho is their trump 

card.

Ashok Kumar Ram,

Garden Reach Road 

My money is on France. The team will try its best 

to win the tournament for captain Zinedine Zidane, who will quit football after 

the World Cup. Henry will also try to leave a mark.

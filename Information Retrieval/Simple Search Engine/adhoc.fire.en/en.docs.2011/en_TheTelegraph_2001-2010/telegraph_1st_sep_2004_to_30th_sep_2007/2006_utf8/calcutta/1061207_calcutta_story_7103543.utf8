 The mother of all school carnivals is here. Sona Chandi The Great TTIS Challenge, the biggest inter-school fest in this part of the world, kicks off on Thursday. For three days, the event will turn Swabhumi into a riot of colour and competition, music and laughter a war zone thick with contests and a fun zone littered with prizes.

 The TTIS (The Telegraph in Schools) event is bigger than last winters, when 109 schools took part. This year, the school count for the December 7 to 9 carnival has climbed to 123.

 Prelims for more than 11 events have already been held. And there are events galore: 3 Mins to Fame (you have to impress the judges with any performance, but within three minutes), creative writing, War of RJs, fusion dance, Beyblade competition and a fashion show. This year, to add sporty spice to the carnival flavour, a dart competition and Laughter Challenge have been added. The crowning glory, of course, is the Champion of Champions. The winner will be chosen from among the winners of various contests.

 Crowding the Swabhumi grounds for three days will be treasure hunts, tattoo hubs and food stalls. Disney will put up stalls, hold spot contests and give away Disney merchandise as prizes. TTIS merchandise, like bags, caps and mobile-holders, will also be available at the carnival, held in association with Cello and Aquaguard.

 Among the judges will be P.C. Sorcar (Jr) for 3 Mins to Fame, Suchitra Bhattacharya for creative writing, Usha Ganguly for street play, Jimmy Tangree for War of the RJs, Ramaprasad Banik for Laughter Challenge, Priti Patel for fusion dance...

 The opening ceremony will keep up with the soaring spirits: it will start with a Krosswindz performance and a dance on roller-skates by children below 12 years. The closing ceremony will feature a celebrity singer. 

 Last year, so many prizes were given away that it was midnight when the event closed. To avoid the logjam, prizes will be given away every day this time.

 Last year, Champion of Champions Navojit Mukherjee of Methodist School, Dankuni, won a trip to Singapore with his family. This year, the big prize promises to be bigger.

 Contestants are busy gearing up. Arijit Das of Class XI at Don Bosco Park Circus, a finalist in 3 Mins to Fame, is confident despite this being his first crack at the carnival. I am among the top 12, says Arijit, a talented mimic.

 So, wear your talent, and the carnival spirit, on the sleeve of your uniform and head straight for Swabhumi.

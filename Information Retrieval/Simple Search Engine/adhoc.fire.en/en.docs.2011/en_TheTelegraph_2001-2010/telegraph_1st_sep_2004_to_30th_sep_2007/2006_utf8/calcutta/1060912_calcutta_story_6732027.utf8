 Innovations aplenty mark Durgas pandals 

Go vertical, make space

 The puja that stirred the hornets nest of encroachment on public space has taken the vertical route to steer clear of trouble this year. 

 Two years after Durga puja was dragged to court, thanks to a petition by a Dover Lane resident, Singhi Park Sarbojanin Durga Puja has resolved to leave more road space than is officially required in Puja 2006. 

 The pandal at the crossing of Dover Lane and Ramani Chatterjee Street, which faced Gariahat Road and the Ekdalia Evergreen puja further across, has turned towards Rashbehari Avenue this year. 

 Police have made three classifications based on the width of the road. Our road being 24 ft wide, we fall in the second group of pandals on streets 20 to 30 ft wide. So, we are supposed to leave six feet of the carriageway. But we have left 13 ft, declared president Shankar Bose. 

 The pandal is open on three sides, allowing vehicles to pass right through the structure. We have receded further on the pavement, encroaching on the driveway of an adjacent 10-storeyed building, chairman Durgaprasad Mukherjee explained. 

 The design was decided on keeping the space constraint in mind. It will be modelled on the Lotus Temple in Delhi, rising to a height of 65 ft. 

 The petals of the gigantic lotus atop will be of steel. Since making the entire structure in steel will increase the weight, the decorations and the walls will be cut out of aluminium sheets, Bose said.

 The new arrangement of the pandal, that earlier kept the crossing blocked for weeks in the run-up to and during the Puja, is receiving blessings of local residents. 

 There is no opposition, not even from a small pocket, Bose says, referring to the PIL filed in January 2005 by neighbour Tapan Kumar Mitra.

 So this year, one can view the goddess while driving by. No way. In the evening, it will be far too crowded for that, Bose laughs.

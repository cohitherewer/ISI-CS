 Wonder view from the insider

They give the right look, feel and ambience 

to the interiors. GoodLife picks four space specialists around town

Pooja Chitlangiap

 Age: 29

 Credentials: Did a course in Interior and Spatial Design from Chelsea College of Art and Design, London. Also, the Jenson and Nicholson course in interior designing from Interior Exterior Institute, Calcutta. 

 Can be found at: Envisage, 105, Southern Avenue.

 Starting point: Right from my school days, I was inclined towards designing. I started working in a firm called Inter Design soon after I left school. To pursue my interest in interior designing formally, I next went to London for a formal course, smiles Pooja. 

 Biggest break: Interiors 2006 ? the exhibition organised by ABID at the Netaji Indoor Stadium in January, where Pooja won the award for the Best Designed Stall.

 It was from there that my career really took off. Currently I am working on 10 residential projects that include big names like Silver Spring, she says.

 Signature style: Blending classic and contemporary looks is where Poojas speciality lies. This look, according to Pooja, works best for both public as well as private places.

 Spaces designed: A large number of residences and apartments across the city. 

 Spaces she wishes to design: I want to do bars and lounges because you can let your imagination run completely wild. You cannot allow yourself to experiment so much while doing up homes, says Pooja.

Vivek Rathoreq

 Age: 29

 Credentials: Architect and product designer from IIT. 

 Can be found at: Salient Pvt Ltd, Studio for Architecture Landscape Interior amp; Enterprise Pvt. Ltd, D-405, City Centre. 

 Starting point: Having a creative bent of mind, design has always been a field that interested me. And while in college itself we discovered the immense potential in this field. I realised that due to the advent of post-modernism, we were gradually losing interest in Gothic architecture. One of my main aims when I got into designing was being able to revive that form of architecture, says Vivek.

 Biggest break: Though the amusement theme park for the Uttaranchal government happened at just the right time, his big break is always the one alive on the drawing board.

 Signature style: It is always inspired by nature and the science of aesthetics.

 Spaces designed: Restaurants Little Italy, KKs Fusion and Charcoal. 

 Some of his ongoing projects include City Centre at Haldia, Town Club at Siliguri, Sunderban Cruise for Vivada, Boutique Hotel at Salt Lake, apart from a host of private residences.

 Spaces he would like to design: A resort island, an airport terminal. 

Charu Rajgarhiap

 Credentials: An arts graduate who undertook the Jenson Nicholson course at Interior Exterior Institute, Delhi, before training with interior designer Payal Kapoor.

 Biggest break: Designing 60 rooms for Hyatt Regency. 

 Signature style: Very contemporary, straight lines and user-friendly. Something that reflects a spacious look, giving peace of mind.

 Spaces designed: NIIT, Warren Tea, KIC Metallics, Surana Jewellers and more.

Karan Jainp

 Age: 28

 Credentials: Has no formal qualifications in interior designing.

 Starting point: Though I have no formal degree in this field, this was a very natural choice since it was our family business. I grew up with interior designs and sketches all around at home, says Karan.

 Biggest break: Space Circle Club, because in those days a club all by itself was a completely alien concept.

 Signature style: A harmonious blend of the classic and the contemporary.

 This look is all about straight lines of furniture, colourful walls and dim lighting for homes, he explains.

 Feluda, photos and a feel for nature

 - FRAMES AND SOUNDS OF FOREST LIFE

 What do Soumitra Chatterjee and Sabyasachi Chakraborty have in common, other than playing Prodosh Mitter on screen? A love for nature and wildlife, and a yearning for conservation.

 With the veteran Feluda stopping in front of every frame and the younger one explaining the what and where, Tuesday evening turned out to be a conducted tour of forest life at the Academy of Fine Arts, complete with the croaking of frogs and the twittering of birds. 

 The photography exhibition marked the unveiling of Sense, an NGO for nature and wildlife conservation, in the presence of Mira Bhattacharjee, among others.

 ?I often have long discussions with Sabyasachi on wildlife and nature, as this subject is close to my heart as well. I would like to be associated with whatever initiative they want me to,? said Soumitra, while Sabyasachi, vice-president of Sense, was busy taking guests around the display.

 Sense, or Society for Environment Nature and Sustainable Ecosystems, has been founded by cardiac surgeon Debal Sen ?to raise awareness and conduct studies? on nature conservation.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who was supposed to have done the inaugural honours, could not make it due to a political commitment. ?He has a lot of interest in this subject and he really wanted to come but he couldn?t. Our daughter (Suchetana) has already taken an initiative to spread awareness about nature conservation,? said Mira Bhattacharjee, who stepped up to cut the ribbon.

 On till May 22, Tales from the Woods showcases a bunch of 100 photographs taken by the organisation members, comprising zoologists, botanists, doctors, forest department officials and an actor.

 From a charging elephant at Kaziranga National Park to the night shot of cheetals with glowering eyes at Mahananda Park (both taken by Debal Sen), or frames of a wintry Bandhavgarh forest to a bird at Kanha National park (shot by Sabyasachi), the exhibition captures a wide range of forest life from across India.

 ?Each one of us has contributed 16 to 17 photographs for this exhibition. And the background music that is playing now was recorded in the forests,? said Sabyasachi. 

 The exhibition is accompanied by two multi-media presentations on the mangrove forests and the Terai.

 Idols to body parts

 - KUMARTULI ON ANATOMY MISSION

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 A giant nose being created for the anatomy park in Rajasthan

 If it were a Vivekananda or a Tagore statue, the artists at Kumartuli would have no problem. But giant models of the heart, kidney or the brain are hardly their cup of tea.

 However, over the past three months, Monty Pal and his aides have been churning out such models for a human anatomy park in Rajasthan. 

 ?We all study human anatomy from the outside, but we never felt the need to know what the leg or the ear would look from the inside,? said Pal. 

 He is just back from a trip to Udaipur, where the 15-acre park, named Dehdevalaya, is coming up. 

 The first of its kind in the country, the park will be unveiled by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam on his birthday on October 15. 

 The park is part of the Narayan Seva Sangstha hospital project, run by Kailash Manav (Agarwal), a retired government official. 

 A free polio hospital, established in 1985 by the Sangstha, has treated 15,000 patients from across the country. 

 ?Over 8,000 of the patients were from Bengal. We hold regular camps in Calcutta. The hospital has 450 beds and a 400-strong staff. The park will help people understand their body and the way it functions,? explained Manav.

 The authorities are keen to ensure that the models are as accurate as possible. Hospital employees are providing Pal with detailed drawings of various body parts.

 ?The doctors are cross-checking my models,? said Pal. The average size of the models varies from 20 to 30 ft. One model of a leg will be as long as 50 ft. Among the organs being reproduced are the kidney, liver, spine, lungs, stomach and the pancreas.

 The models are being made of steel rods, fibreglass, latex and other items. Several of them will be motorised or pneumatically animated, said Pal. 

 The face, for instance, will have a tongue that will come out to allow visitors to climb on to it for a ride inside. There will also be light and sound effects.

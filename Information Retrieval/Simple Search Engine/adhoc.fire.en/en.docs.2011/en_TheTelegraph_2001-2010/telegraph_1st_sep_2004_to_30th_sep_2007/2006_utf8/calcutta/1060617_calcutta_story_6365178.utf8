 Six full-length productions, street 

 plays, mime, puppet and 10 days of pulsating theatre across 

 six venues. Into its sixth year, Odeon, the Hutch annual 

 theatre event, has grown bigger and better, providing Bengali 

 group theatre an impressive platform.

 The festival kicks off on June 23 with a seminar that finds Sohini Halder, Saswati Biswas, Bibhas Chakraborty, Makrand Deshpande and Rajat Kapoor debating what theatre means to the youth of today.

 Apart from the couple of much-awaited plays from beyond Bengal ? this year it?s Makrand Deshpande?s Ek Kadam Agay and Rajat Kapoor?s C for Clown from Mumbai ? Odeon is dishing out four brand new Bengali productions.

 Makrand?s play is a fantasy in Hindi, with a cast involving the director and Nivedita Bhattacharya. C for Clown, directed by film-maker/actor Kapoor, is a gibberish experimental play in English.

 C for Clown takes the GD Birla Sabhagar stage on June 24, followed by Ek Kadam Agay the day after.

 As in previous years, two new Bengali productions have been picked by a three-member panel comprising Dulal Lahiri, Arun Mukhopadhyay and Samik Bandopadhyay. Theatre group Blank Verse?s Furrut and Balaka?s Maruyatra were among the bunch of 65 applications that the contest drew this time.

 ?The scripts needed to be original, and not a revival of a play. The screening process started with the initial short-listing by the panelists. After a few rounds, the number was brought down to two ? Furrut and Maruyatra. This year, we have also decided to sponsor the premiere show of the next two best plays ? Sandarbha?s Gahvar and Drishyapat?s Aguner Barnamala,? said Odeon consultant Sohag Sen on Friday. 

 The musical Furrut is based on the children?s story by Upendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury. But due to the non-availability of child actors, director Raja Bhattacharya has opted for grown-ups. One of the major characters is being played by actor Deb Shankar Halder.

 Maruyatra, directed by Swapan Biswas for his Asansol-based group, has been created by sieving several folk tales. Furrut and Maruyatra will round up the festival at Rabindra Sadan on July 1 and 2, respectively.

 Gahvar, scripted and steered by Soumitra Basu, paints disturbing personal experiences against the backdrop of contemporary politics, while Aguner Barnamala, directed by Anirban Bhattacharya, focuses on the psyche of a youth who burns his father as an act of cleansing. 

 Gahvar will be staged at Sarat Sadan in Howrah on June 28; Aguner Barnamala comes up at Sukanta Sadan, Barrackpore, on June 30.

 The Nandan compound will come alive for five days with the sights and sounds of street theatre, mime and puppetry. Jhalapala?s Bhool Rasta and Abol Tabol will be performed on the evening of June 26 and then June 29, while Ranen Chakraborty?s mime act Chair amp; Ghoosh is scheduled for June 27. 

 Subha Joarder?s puppet show Vishalyakarani will be staged on June 30. Debojit Bandopadhyay will render theatre songs at Academy of Fine Arts on June 28.

 Swapnasandhani director Koushik Sen and actress Gargi Roy Chowdhury are Odeon?s cultural associates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Spurious items under scan

 - Complaints from consumers set off raids at malls amp; marts

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 

 Look hard before you pick up those low-priced imported chocolates and perfumes filling the shelves of swank malls. For, if you think the price tag is too good to be true, you are probably right.

 In the course of surprise raids on retail racks, government officials have discovered a market flooded with spurious products, both local and foreign.

 We have conducted raids at some malls in Calcutta and in district towns after receiving complaints from consumers. We will conduct more raids, as we have found truth in these complaints, said K. Sathiavasan, secretary, consumer affairs and legal metrology department.

 From Big Bazaar and Vardaan Market to market complexes in and around Gariahat and some in district towns, the department has conducted 27 raids since early November. A wide range of consumer products (see box) have been seized for violating the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. 

 Imported products should bear the name and address of the importer, price and the licence number. Local products, too, need to adhere to such stipulations.

 As of now, we only know that there were some discrepancies with regard to the maximum retail price of certain products at Big Bazaar and we have already paid a penalty, said Atul Takle, chief, corporate communications, Pantaloons Retail. Sunder Lal Jain, secretary, Vardaan Market Shop and Office Owners Association, said the traders had suffered due to ignorance about legal provisions.

 Government officials claimed traders do not take the act seriously as they can get away by paying a minor penalty. We have urged the Union law ministry to change the provisions to give the act more teeth, said Naren De, minister, consumer affairs and legal metrology department.

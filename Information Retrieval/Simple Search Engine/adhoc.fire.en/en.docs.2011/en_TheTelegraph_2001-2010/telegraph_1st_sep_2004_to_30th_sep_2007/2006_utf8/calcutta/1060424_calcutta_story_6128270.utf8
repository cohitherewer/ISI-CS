The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Little to show for Rs 6.8-crore budget

 The Asiatic Society on Park Street. A Telegraph picture

 The bane of the Asiatic Society, which is going to the polls once again on Monday, is that an overwhelming majority of its members are more interested in clinging to it like limpets because of the feeling of power its gives them to be associated with an institution of national importance. Promoting academic excellence, which used to be its hallmark at one time, is certainly not on their agenda. 

 Ironically, that was when the Society led a hand-to-mouth existence and members used to pay from their own pockets to keep it going.

 Although this time round the election rules and regulations, about which many members had sundry complaints in the past, have been modified, its result is a foregone conclusion, for the opposition has been decimated. 

 There have been court cases over the issue. In 2000-2002, some members had forgotten to strike out the names proposed in the ?official panel?, as a result of which a candidate for the post of general secretary lost by five votes. A candidate for the post of treasurer also lost the election in a similar manner.

 Although the verdict went in favour of both candidates, it came a little too late and the winners could not savour their victory. But from that year itself, the rule of striking out the names on the ?official panel? was dropped. 

 The demand for changing the rules was first made in 2000. The regulation revision committee made some recommendations on changing these that year itself. These were implemented only in 2005. Consequently, last year, a good many members did not participate in the election.

 Ramakanta Chakrabarty, general secretary of the Asiatic Society, who, at 70-plus, also heads Bangiya Sahitya Parishat, hails the new election rules as ?democratic?. 

 However, the Society itself is still in a quagmire. It has 1,028 new members without any corresponding expansion in infrastructure, admits Chakrabarty. The Asiatic Society building at 1, Park Street, cannot be touched as it is a heritage structure.

 It is true that most members step into the building only to cast their ballot, but senior members find it difficult to work in the library where young scholars usually go for a chit-chat. While the rooms of office-bearers are becoming larger, the Society?s journal is being dumped in Metcalfe Hall.

 After 12 long years, the institution at last has a librarian. But is it not crying out for an incumbent who would be able to recognise the worth and value of its treasure trove of books? Nepotism can only support mediocrity. Yet, the Society?s annual budget of Rs 6.8 crore is nothing to be sniffed at.

 The pitiable research output of the Society?s 40 scholarship fellowships in the past five to seven years is an indication of the decline of the Society?s academic standards. Nobody worthwhile bothers to contribute in the Society?s journal, that once used to be hailed for its superlative academic standard. The publication secretary does not have many publications ? if any ? to his credit. The same holds with the historical and archaeological secretary.

 So vindictive is the ruling coterie that after historian Pradip Sinha, who had taken up a project on early 20th Century Calcutta, commented on the pitiable state of research in this state in a lecture, his project was not extended. 

 He had already addressed two seminars on the project. Yet, both Irfan Habib and Romila Thapar are on its planning board.

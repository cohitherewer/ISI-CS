 Campus cry on poll toll 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University (CU) is set to approach the state government and the ministry of human resources development, in a bid to stop the disruption in the functioning of colleges in the run-up to the elections.

 The university pointed out that undergraduate examinations have been deferred by up to two months for the polls, affecting lakhs of examinees.

 ?We are flooded with complaints from our affiliated colleges,? said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic). ?This system of taking over colleges needs to be stopped, particularly if the elections are held during the exam season.? 

 Some colleges claimed their premises were being turned into training centres for poll personnel without prior notice. Others, like Victoria College, said their campuses were being used as photography studios for voter identity cards.

 An Election Commission order has forced a CU-affiliated B.Ed college run by Ramakrishna Mission to hand over the premises for two months from next week. The varsity had to shorten the 10-month course by a month. ?This may jeopardise students? careers. But we are helpless,? added Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, controller of examinations, CU.

 ?I am not aware how many colleges have been taken over,? said Nikhil Sahana, joint chief electoral officer. He said the count could be more than earlier. ?We cannot help it. We do not have separate buildings for holding elections. The number of voters, too, has increased. We need more polling stations. We also need space to accommodate the increasing number of poll officials and paramilitary,? he added.

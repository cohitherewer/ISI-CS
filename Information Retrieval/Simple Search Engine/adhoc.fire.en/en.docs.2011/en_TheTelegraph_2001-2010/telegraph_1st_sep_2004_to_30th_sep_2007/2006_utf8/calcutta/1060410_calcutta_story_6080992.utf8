Screen On amp; Off

After 780 episodes, Kumkum today takes a leap 

in time to renew viewer interest. Pratim D. Gupta explores the whats and 

whys of bahu becoming saas overnight

It will be yet another 20-year leap on the small screen. 

Only this time, it?s not a Balaji soap taking the jump. Kumkum ? Pyara Sa Bandhan 

of B.A.G. Films, the most popular afternoon soap on television, will go bees 

saal baad from Monday with bahu becoming saas and pita 

becoming nana on the STAR Plus show.

?More than anything else, it is the demand of the 

audiences to see something new,? says Anurradha Prasad, managing director of B.A.G. 

Films. ?We have had a very successful run on TV with Kumkum being the only 

serial to sustain 780 episodes without a leap. Now, after three-and-a-half-years, 

by taking the leap we will be able to churn out a whole new story for our viewers 

to follow and their interest in the show will be renewed.?

For STAR, it is making most out of a successful brand. 

Says Shailaja Kejriwal, senior creative director, STAR India: ?Beyond a certain 

point in a daily soap, the story ends. So rather than taking it out and starting 

a new soap, we have this option of the Gen-jump, where the story becomes new but 

we don?t lose out on the brand equity. If we had shut down Kumkum, we wouldn?t 

have used the brand we created all these years.?

So, while all the old characters continue to be part 

of the Kumkum family, a whole new generation has been introduced. Dhruv 

(Jatin and Kumkum?s son) has now grown up into the dashing beta of the 

house while Sharman and Aashka, Kumkum?s twin kids with Sumeet, are the pampered 

twosome in the Wadhwa family. Taking the story forward will be Dhruv?s love story. 

While he is in love with Antara, an orphan he met in the US while studying, the 

family wants him to marry Siya, daughter of Sumeet?s best friend.

With new characters comes a new set of actors. Playing 

the pivotal Dhruv will be Vivan Bhatena, Mr India 2004, who was seen as a VJ on 

MTV before doing TV serials like Kyunkii Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Time 

Bomb. ?The best thing about this jump is that the new generation will be more 

real in their approach,? says Vivan. ?So it will be less drama and more character-based 

progression.?

Antara, of course, is being played by our very own 

Sayantani Ghosh, who has signed a one-year contract with B.A.G. Films. ?I am really 

looking forward to seeing how the national audience accepts me,? she says. ?My 

character of the US-returned girl in love with Indian customs and rituals wins 

over the hearts of all the members of the Wadhwa family. Hope it does the same 

with the viewers.?

Playing the twins Sharman and Ashka will be Gaurav 

Khanna and Chahat Khanna (who are not related in real life). ?Well, they must 

be unidentical twins,? laughs Gaurav, who?s already appeared in serials like Siddhanth 

and Bhabhi. ?I play a Casanova kind of guy, who is too much into girls. 

Somebody has to do the tough job, you see! But I am also the darling of the family 

and, of course, Kumkum?s favourite son.?

Chahat, a veteran among the younger crop of actors, 

has acted in movies like 7 1/2 Phere and The Film. ?This is the 

first time I am doing a serial and I am happy that I don?t have to do something 

over the top,? she confides. ?The nature of television acting is changing and 

it?s becoming very real, closer to life, making the job easier for us.?

 But where does all this fresh blood leave good old 

favourites Kumkum and Sumeet, one of the most successful romantic couples on TV? 

?It?s not that we will stop loving each other on screen,? declares Hussain, who 

plays Sumeet. ?It?s just that our romance will become more mature in flavour. 

Having successfully played the roles of beta, bhai and pati on 

the show, now the challenge will be to be a great pita.?

sabse favourite maa?

Juhi Parmar (left) has been one of the most 

loved faces on the small screen. But with Kumkum taking the 20-year-leap, she 

would no longer be just Sumeets loving wife, but will also have to play 

mom to three grown-up kids and eventually saas to her chosen bahu...

 On ageing: I will be the youngest and best looking mother on the small 

screen. I have been the best bahu and now I will be the most inspiring and best 

maintained mom on TV.

 On motherhood: I will be more of a friend to my kids than a mom as such. 

The respect for me will come as a friend with a warm hug, rather than touching 

my feet.

 On love: Kumkum is a love story and it will continue to remain a love 

story. It is also a very modern story. So, by jumping 20 years, the serial is 

actually going ahead of its times.

 On image: The audience today is very smart. They know that even if I 

play a mother, I have not aged as much in real life. So, when they go to see me 

performing on stage, they know they are watching Juhi and not Kumkum.

 On acting: I am an actor and I can play any character from a college 

girl to an old woman. I had played twins on the show and it was one of the most 

successful tracks for Kumkum. So, hopefully, people will continue to love me. 

Aaj bhi complain aata hai ki dopahar ko khana nahin banta, kyunki Kumkum TV pe 

aati hai...

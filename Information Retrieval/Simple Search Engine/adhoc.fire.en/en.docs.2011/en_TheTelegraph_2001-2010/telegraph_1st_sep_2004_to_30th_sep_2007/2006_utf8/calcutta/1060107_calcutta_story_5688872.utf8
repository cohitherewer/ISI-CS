 Theyre hot, theyre sizzling and they will be on your desktop all of 2006. As the New Year rolls in, Channel [V] has unveiled the first edition of its exclusive Girls On [V] 2006 calendar.

 This limited edition calendar features the gorgeous Channel [V] VJs ? Archana, Pia, Tina, Juhi and Sarah Jane ? turning up the temperature with a series of dazzling photographs.

 Promising 12 months of visual treat, the Girls On [V] calendar is a combination of fashion, beauty, glamour and fun. Set against the backdrop of the exotic beaches of south Goa, the VJs have been brilliantly captured for the calendar by ace photographer Sudhir Ramchandran.

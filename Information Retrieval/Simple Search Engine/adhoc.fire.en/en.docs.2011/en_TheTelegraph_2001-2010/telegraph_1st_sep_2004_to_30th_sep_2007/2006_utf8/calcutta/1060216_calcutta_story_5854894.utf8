 You share your birthday with...

 John McEnroe 

Your mind is very active and you constantly work on improving yourself. You?re a great person to work with; pleasant even on your worst day. You never look down on the people around you; in fact, you always seem to find something that you could learn from others. You?re a very patient and understanding teacher. People rely on you because they know you never lie or cheat. ? Kusum Bhandari

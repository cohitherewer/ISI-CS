 Death rap on builder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Saturday morning?s tank cave-in at the city?s biggest residential project, coming up on Prince Anwar Shah Road, has claimed one more life, taking the toll to three. 

 A case of ?death due to negligence? was registered on Sunday against Ahluwalia Contracts (India) Ltd, which is carrying out civil construction at the sprawling estate. The police said the three victims were among the workers hired by company for the project.

 Jhantu Pandit, who was injured in the mishap along with Rajesh Biswakarma and Birendra Rai, died at a city nursing home late on Saturday. A resident of Midnapore East, he had been working at the site for a few years.

 Early on Saturday, he and the other two victims were taking a bath in the tank when its walls gave away and the concrete came crashing down.

 While Rai, 33, died on the spot, Jhantu, 27, and Rajesh, 35, were taken to the nursing home. Rajesh succumbed to his injuries soon after being admitted to the clinic. 

 ?We have started a case of death due to negligence against the construction firm that is building the flats,? said H.K. Kusumakar, additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas.

 ?Jadavpur police will look into the details of the construction of the tank and action will be taken accordingly,? he added. Soon after the mishap, one of the labourers had lodged a complaint with Jadavpur police station, alleging negligence by the construction company. 

 The tank, measuring around 30 sq m, was one of the two makeshift waterbodies set up by the company for the labourers. Preliminary investigations suggest that the tank caved in as it was unable to bear the water pressure.

 ?We have decided to do away with the other concrete tank and put in place two plastic tanks. The company will provide due compensation to the families of the victims,? claimed Ratish Bhardwaj, vice-president of the company.

 CPM leaders had organised a demonstration at the main entrance to the project, that falls under the Dhakuria Assembly constituency, on Saturday. Local Trinamul Congress MLA Sougata Roy has demanded the arrest of those responsible for the deaths.

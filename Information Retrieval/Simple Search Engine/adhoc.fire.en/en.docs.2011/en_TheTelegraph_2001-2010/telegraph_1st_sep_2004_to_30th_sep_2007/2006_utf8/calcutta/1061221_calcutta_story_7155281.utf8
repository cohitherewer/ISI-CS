Life

 A touch of Tokyo

 Crossover Couture 

 Think Japanese, think style and think kimono. Well, not exactly! Its a misconception. Japanese dont live in kimonos. Its like saying Indians wear lehngas every day, says Tokyo-based designer Jaysree Chatterjee, in town to launch her latest collection. Her model for the day was niece Nayanika Chatterjee (in picture by Rashbehari Das).

 Marriage moved Jaysree to Japan in 1990 and once there she made her first-ever design, a typical Indian salwar kameez, that she felt didnt go down very well with the Japanese. Slowly and gradually she toned her designs down and also adapted them to suit their sensibilities.

 Sixteen years on, after her designs have adorned Japans imperial family, socialites and ministers, Jaysree says she has come full circle. Now I am trying to Indianise my garments, to suit my clients here, she smiles.

 So, the journey begins again from muted dupattas and jackets for the Japanese to saris and kurtas for Indian clients.

 The relationship with the land of the rising sun has been one of give and take. On the one hand it gave her fame and fortune and on the other hand taught her the beauty of simplistic Japanese designs. Their style is also very Zen-like. Minimalist, simple, clutter-free and earthy tones define their look, explains Jaysree. 

 Her latest Indian collection comprises saris, long skirts, pant-suits, tops and salwar kameez. The fabric story revolves around naturals like tussar, matka, raw silk and velvet; embellishments like stones, crystals, sequins and beads up the oomph quotient.

 The line is available at 7 Sarat Bose Road in 8A Dwarka (near Minto Park) with a price tag that reads Rs 2,000-plus.

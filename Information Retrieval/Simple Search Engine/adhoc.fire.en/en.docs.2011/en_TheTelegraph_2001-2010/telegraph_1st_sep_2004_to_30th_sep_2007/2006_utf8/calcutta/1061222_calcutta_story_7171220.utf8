 From the imagination of director George Miller (Mad Max, Babe) springs Happy Feet (releasing on Friday at city theatres), a comedy with music and animation that unfolds in the world of Emperor penguins.

 Miller has always been fascinated by the life of penguins. They live such extraordinary lives, richly allegorical in terms of how we conduct ourselves as humans the way they survive, huddling against the cold, sharing the warmth, singing to find a mate.

 To populate his tale, Miller sought out actors that could carry a tune in addition to their acting chops. What he ended up with is a stellar ensemble of some of the most acclaimed talents, including Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, with artistes such as Prince, Pink, Chrissie Hynde and K.D. Lang contributing to the soundtrack.

 Williams, who voices Adelie penguin Ramon, and Rockhopper advice-guru Lovelace didnt need to see the script. Just the concept struck me as being strange. Whenever you think of penguins, you go: At least theyre well dressed!

 The film follows the adventures of a young Emperor penguin named Mumble (Wood), who is born to parents Memphis (Jackman) and Norma Jean (Kidman). 

 When you first meet Norma Jean, a lot of the penguin boys are interested in her, says Kidman. But she only has eyes for Memphis.

 As he grows up, Mumble discovers that unlike his friends he doesnt have a Heartsong. Without it, no penguin can find true love.

 Later Mumble discovers that he expresses it through his tap-dancing feet! Mumbles confidence and innate sense of self is extraordinary, says Wood. He doesnt want to give up the part of himself that makes him unique. 

 His individuality drives him closer to the object of his affection, Gloria (Murphy). They (Gloria and Mumble) are just kindred soul mates, Murphy explains.

 Happy Feet is many things. But Miller hopes what comes through above all else is the emotion at the heart of the tale.

 roll, Afro jazz, salsa, Shiamaks Indo jazz and

 The fourth in the series of panel discussions organised by The Telegraph at Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on May 5 was in stark contrast to the previous sessions. The representatives of vernacular schools at the meet negated the importance of English in the all-round development of a child.

 Principal of Bethune Collegiate School Priti Mondal observed that ?only brilliant people sit for competitive exams and if needed, they will be able to learn the language?.

 While headmaster of Momin High School Md. Shahid Aslam blamed the socio-economic factor as the main deterrent in a child?s English education, Ranjit Rath, headmaster of Puddopukur Institution, emphasised that the ?intellectual, cultural and emotional development? were the primary requirements of a child. Headmistress of Shyambazar AV School for Girls Tapasi Palchaudhuri pointed out that the ?difference? in the syllabi of state and Delhi boards was responsible for the deterioration in the standard of vernacular schools. Dr. Sailendra Sekhar Kundu cited how some students from rural areas were impressive without fluency in English.

 K. Kumar, head of Behala Santi 

 Sangha Vidyayatan for Boys, was in favour of students of 

 vernacular and English-medium schools competing in inter-school 

 meets. Esha Saha Choudhuri, headmistress of Ariadaha Sarbamangala 

 Balika Vidyalaya, felt debates will boost the self-confidence 

 of the students.

 ?English is our second language, how can we give it the importance of the first? It is and will remain a link language,? summed up Hasi Sharma, teacher in-charge of M.C. Sabitri Shikshayalaya.

 Other participants in the panel discussion were Madhumita Chatterjee and Rini Chakrabarty, assistant teachers of Behala Girls? High School, Santanu Datta, assistant teacher of Beleghata Santi Sangha, Sumita Roy and Sarmistha Chandra, assistant teachers of M.C. Sabitri Shikshalaya, and Tanima Banerjee and Krishna Banerjee, assistant teacher and assistant headmistress of Ariadaha Sarbamangala Balika Vidyalaya.

 Texts for tots

 Peering into computer screens, mastering video games and matching steps with movie numbers ? toddlers these days do all that and more with aplomb. For they are super kids, gadget-friendly and ready to forget books, letters and fairy tales that appealed to their previous generations. To dispel this misconception and make books appeal to tots, Indian Montessori Lab, a research wing and Montessori house of the Indian Montessori Centre (IMC), New Alipore, recently hosted a book fair for them. The institute is one-of-its-kind in Calcutta with tie-ups with the London Montessori Centre.

 That today?s children enjoy books 

 was evident at the fair. Not satisfied with just leafing 

 through the pages, some even thought of carrying the books 

 home for a leisurely read .

 As the Montessori method stresses first on reading and then writing, books are an integral part of a child?s growth. The books at the fair were also different from normal texts ? they had been specially made to make the child aware about the environment, conscious of his immediate surroundings and develop the habit of reading independently.

 ?The fair was not only meant to help kids develop a love for books, but also for parents to identify the right books for them. We don?t stress on story-telling, but encourage the kids to develop reading skills on their own,? says Sanjana Vakharia of IMC.

Celebrating Tagore

 Ponchishe Baishakh dawned crisp and clear and Calcutta breathed, recited and sang Tagore. We at the Apeejay Group of Schools remembered the Bard in our own way. On May 10, the ambience in the auditorium resembled Santiniketan, with flowers abounding everywhere. 

 After a rendition of Anander ei sagar hote, more songs, poems and speeches followed. Noteworthy among the performances were a violin recital by Sohan Sarkar of Class II and a vocal recital by Madhuparna Chakraborty of Class IX. Up next was a dance competition in which the children of the Nehru, Tagore, Gandhi and Radhakrishnan Houses danced to songs from Gitabitan.

 A day after the Bard?s birth anniversary, teachers and students of The Assembly of God Church School, Park Street, celebrated Rabindra Jayanti with much fanfare. A recitation by Barthika Ghosal of Class XII and a dance based on Rituranga were much lauded by all.

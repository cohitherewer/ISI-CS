 Visualising an emerging sector

 Gaming and visual effects is an emerging industry in India. Not to leave Calcutta behind in the race, Ficci has organised a daylong seminar on the subject on August 11. 

 We had been conducting seminars and conferences on animation, gaming and visual effects in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Delhi, said Sumeet Gupta, senior assistant director, Ficci.

 In order to promote the sector in the eastern part of the country, we thought of doing it in Calcutta, which has a tremendous pool of creative talent, he added.

 There will be panel discussions, featuring bureaucrats, academics and corporate executives in the industry, on a variety of issues, from fostering public-private partnerships to the future of visual effects. 

 Mumbai might be the entertainment capital of the country, with Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad also very strong in animation, post-production, etc. But Calcutta isnt far behind, felt Gupta. There are studios doing regional work. I think there is a lot of creative talent in Calcutta. If proper steps are taken, we can witness a lot of work happening in future. 

 The list of participants at the seminar includes N. Baijendra Kumar, joint secretary, I amp;B ministry, Samir Banerjee, head of the computer graphics and animation department at FTII, Devranjan Dutta, MD of Webel, Jaya Kumar, CEO of Toonz Animation, and Rajesh Turakhia, CEO of Maya Entertainment.

 The aim is to address a range of issues, particularly the development of human capital. There is a shortage of trained manpower in this sector. Our research suggests that India needs over 30,000 animators. We should have centres of excellence, on the pattern of IITs and IIMs. We are also contemplating public-private partnership, added Gupta. 

 Ficci has been at the forefront in promoting the industry through events like Frames one of Asias biggest conventions in the business of entertainment and the Animation Awards instituted in 2004. The organisation has also formed the Animation and Gaming Forum to promote the development of this sector.

 In association with the California-based US Asia Business Forum and the support of California state, Ficci will be organising the India-US Trade Promotion Event and Business Expo 2006 from August 21-22 at Los Angeles. The objective is to project the opportunities in India to US companies.

 If the response at the upcoming seminar in the city is good, there will be more events in Calcutta in future, promised Gupta.

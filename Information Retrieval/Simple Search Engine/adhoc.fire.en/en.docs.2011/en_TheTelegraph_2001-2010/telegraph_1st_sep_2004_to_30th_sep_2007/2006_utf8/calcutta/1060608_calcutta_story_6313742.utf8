 On March 29, Mohammad Israful took his wife Gulshan Begum to Garden Reach State General Hospital for delivery. Hospital superintendent Siraj Ahmed, however, advised Israful to take his wife to a private hospital. The next day, after the intervention of Garden Reach Nagarik Parishad, an NGO, Ahmed asked Gulshan to come back ?as and when required?.

 Accordingly, Israful took her to the hospital on April 13, but she was refused admission, since the delivery was ?not normal?. The couple went to Medical College and Hospital, where Gulshan gave birth to a son on April 15.

 Three days later, Sabnam, another resident of the area, was taken to Garden Reach State General Hospital after her labour pains started. This time, Ahmed stated that the hospital did not have facilities for childbirth. Left with no alternative, Sabnam gave birth at her home the same day. 

 Such has been the condition of the Garden Reach hospital since it was built. When asked about the cases, superintendent Ahmed said: ?Why are you bothering yourself about these petty matters? Look into the affairs of bigger hospitals.?

 Director of health services K.C. Barui stated: ?Members of Garden Reach Nagarik Parishad have met me. I have asked the chief medical officer of health (CMOH) to conduct a detailed inquiry and submit a report.? 

 The CMOH of South 24-Parganas said he had received complaints against the superintendent and would speak with him. ?Members of Garden Reach Nagarik Parishad and relatives of patients have complained against Ahmed. There is no record in the hospital register of delivery cases being refused. I have asked Ahmed to submit a detailed report on the matter and make arrangements to start a maternity ward as early as possible. 

 Former chief minister Jyoti Basu laid the foundation stone of the hospital in 1990. Seven years later, the outdoor departments were started. The indoor departments became functional after three more years. 

 The hospital, constructed on a 30-acre plot, is supposed to house 131 beds and surgery, paediatrics, gynaecology, medicine, dentistry and ENT departments. But it only has 30 beds.

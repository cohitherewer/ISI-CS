 Gangs in spree of four dacoities

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cash and valuables worth lakhs were taken away as four shops across the city were looted between late Saturday and early Sunday. 

 Police said a massive hunt has been launched for the gangs, though no one has yet been arrested.

 The biggest of the dacoities was committed by an armed gang of five at a confectionery on BT Road around 11.10 pm.

 Prakash Singh, the shop-owner in his late thirties, was in the shop finalising plans for his sons rice-eating ceremony with other family members, who live upstairs in the same building.

 A taxi screeched to a halt in front of the shop and the five youths stepped out.

 Two of them asked those present in the shop to hand over their gold ornaments, while the rest walked towards the cash box. Finding it locked, they forced Singh at gunpoint to hand over his wallet. 

 One of the youths tried to take away the gold bangles of a woman but failed. Within 10 minutes, the gang left with around Rs 45,000, seven gold rings and two gold chains. 

 Most of those present in the shop were carrying notes of Rs 1,000 denomination and above, said an officer of Cossipore police station.

 Usually, the shop closes by 9 pm but Saturday was an exception. There was no one around when the youths entered the shop, the officer added. 

 An hour earlier, a gang stormed a grocery run by Maqbul Sarkar on CIT Road, in Beniapukur, and took away Rs 5,000 and several items. 

 They even took with them the gadgets of the Airtel PCO booth that Sarkar has recently set up.

 The youths spoke in Hindi and carried a country-made revolver. Sarkar could not cry out for help as his family lives in the same building. His six-year-old son had come to the shop while it was being looted, but Sarkar gestured him to go back, said an officer of Beniapukur police station.

 At 2.30 am, an armed gang entered a scrap shop on Canal Circular Road, under Phoolbagan police station, by lifting the top-roof cover and took away copper pieces worth around Rs 1.5 lakh. 

 Around 9.30 pm, a gang of youths broke into a shop on Hare Street and walked away with Rs 76,000 from the locker.

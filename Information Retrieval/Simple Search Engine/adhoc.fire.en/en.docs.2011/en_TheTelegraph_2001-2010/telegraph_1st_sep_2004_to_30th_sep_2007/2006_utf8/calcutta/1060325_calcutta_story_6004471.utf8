 It took almost a year to be ready and once you step in, you know exactly why. Be it the exquisite interiors, the warm ambience or the stunning view of the poolside, lush green landscape and the EM Bypass, the brand new Presidential suite at Hyatt Regency Calcutta, spread over a sprawling 2,000 sq ft, spells grandeur with a capital G.

 The suite on the seventh floor of this Salt Lake five-star address, launched on March 22, boasts interiors designed by Robert Bilkey and Oscar Llinas from Bilkey Llinas Design of Palm Beach, Florida, the firm that created the interiors for the entire hotel.

 The furniture and upholstery have been imported from Singapore. We always had the infrastructure for this suite, but wanted the final result to be perfect in all aspects. The interiors were changed a couple of times till we were completely satisfied with the way it looks, says Amit Nag, director of marketing, Hyatt.

 With the business scenario booming in Calcutta, this is perhaps the best time to come up with a venture like this, adds Nag. 

 As you enter the lounge area, a silver foil dome ceiling, plush sofa sets, wooden flooring, exquisite lampshades, beautiful showpieces resembling flower petals and a swank flat screen catch your eye.

 Lots of mirrors leave you with a feeling of ample space. Imported marbau flooring, ethnic Dholpur carvings and paintings with a very contemporary feel accentuate the look.

 Curtains in pale moss green on huge glass windows come with motorised mechanism. A small wash room stands near the entrance. To your right is the dining area, where a table for eight is laid with Villeroy amp; Boch crockery and where theres an attached pantry, complete with a microwave and a refrigerator.

 The touch of grandeur is carried forward to the large bath area that boasts a jacuzzi with a striking carved panel as the backdrop, a television and a well-stocked magazine rack. The bath area also features a whirlpool bath and walk-in rain shower.

 The closet room is just beside it, followed by the master bedroom with the carpets and curtains in shades of beige and cream creating an ambience warm and homely.

 The bed, a dressing closet, a separate worktable and a flat-screen television along with a DVD player strategically placed leave you enough room for work and play.

 Guests staying at the suite also enjoy personal butler attendance and broadband Internet facilities.

 All this at a price of Rs 30,000 

 per day.

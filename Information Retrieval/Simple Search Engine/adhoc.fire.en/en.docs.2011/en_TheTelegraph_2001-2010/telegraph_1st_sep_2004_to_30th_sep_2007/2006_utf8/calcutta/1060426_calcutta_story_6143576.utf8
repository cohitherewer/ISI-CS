 Poll panel?s tech route to masses

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 ?If your name is included in the voters? list and if you have the Elector?s Photo Identity Card (EPIC), you can know your voter serial number and details of the polling station by sending an SMS to 3247.?

 From imposing restrictions on campaigning methods to using the latest tech tools for voters? convenience, it?s the Election Commission that?s taking the lead in the Assembly polls 2006.

 The commission?s website provides a whole lot of useful poll information, like the election dates and history, constituency and candidate profiles and the electoral roll.

 ?The challenge was in ensuring a user-friendly site while dealing with the huge volume of information,? said R. Ramanan, MD amp; CEO of CMC Limited, which is managing the site. The company?s ITES wing looks after a number of election-related projects for the Centre and the states.

 But the commission clampdown has taken its toll on the use of SMS and Internet by political parties to spread the manifesto message.

 ?Basically, we had to do underground campaigning this time and relied mainly on printed handbills,? said state IT minister and CPM functionary Manab Mukherjee. ?Besides the existing central committee website, we have done nothing special for the elections. As for SMS, only a few were sent to some close people.?

 Agreed an INTUC working committee member campaigning for a Congress candidate: ?SMS use has been minimal, as we?re not very sure of what is allowed and what is not. Besides, voters may just take a look and delete the messages, so we?re emphasising on face-to-face meetings.?

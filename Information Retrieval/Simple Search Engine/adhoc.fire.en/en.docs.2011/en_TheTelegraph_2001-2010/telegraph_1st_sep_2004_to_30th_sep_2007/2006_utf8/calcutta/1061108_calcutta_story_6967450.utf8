 Sunday evening saw yet another fun-filled episode of The Telegraph Apartainment, held this time at Ananya Co-operative Housing Society (near Beleghata Jora Mandir). Bonding was the name of the game as anchor Pranam Roy kept both adults and children entertained throughout the show with interactive sessions. 

 The first event was a Sit amp; Draw competition for children of the housing society aged between three and nine years. Sixteen youngsters enthusiastically sat down with their colours as drawing sheets were handed out to all participants. While the kids were free to draw anything they felt like, most chose to illustrate images of nature.

 Nine-year-old Debopriya Ghosh came first, followed by Broti Adhikary and Biswadip Sarkar. All participants had pinned yellow TTIS badges to mark their participation in the event.

 Next up was 3 Minutes to Fame for those aged between 10 and 17 years. After a short introduction comprising academic details and hobbies, Pritam Das, the first participant, began the talent round with a joke! I was not at all nervous. The joke was my idea but my father did help me a bit, he explained after his performance.

 l credit otherwise went to the young participants. My daughter learns classical dance and this was her own initiative, said Chaitali Mandal, a proud mother. Her daughter Shrija, all jazzed up in a red top, danced to Wheres the party tonight. Sincere efforts reaped awards. I was so excited to show my talent; my parents wanted me to accompany them elsewhere but I fought to come here, said Mehul Agarwal, who ranked first in 3 Minutes to Fame with his rock-star talent show. Shrija Mondal and Shilanjani Bhattacharya came a close second and third. 

 The rest of the event saw dances, tabla performances, poetry recitals and singing. Meanwhile, questions thrown to the audience by the compere kept them busy.

 Winners of the Sit amp; Draw competition and 3 Minutes to Fame were awarded The Telegraph Apartainment Champion trophies and sun caps. The runners-up walked away with similar mementos and sun caps.

 The long-awaited Antakshari wrapped up the fun evening. Eight groups with three participants each donned different coloured headbands. All eyes were on the scoreboard as teams raced to a close finish.

 Antakshari winners were Payal Sinha, Atanu Ganguly and Tapan Sinha, cultural head of the flatowners association in Ananya.

 All residents are out of their houses to be a part of this enjoyable event on a Sunday evening, said B.K. Roy, a resident of the complex.

 Interactive events like The Telegraph Apartainment encourage unity and togetherness among residents... And the phuchkas have been a big hit, smiled Tapan Sinha. 

 The programme witnessed a gala finale with everyone singing and dancing on the makeshift stage.

 Madarsa upgraded, autonomy on anvil

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Madarsa, one of the oldest institutions of higher education in the country, will be treated as a full-fledged college.

 Announcing this on Tuesday, state higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty said the government also has plans to grant autonomy to the institution.

 Founded by the British 225 years ago to educate employees of East India Company, the madarsa has so far been under the joint control of the school education and higher education departments. 

 ?Following the upgrade in its status, it will come under the full control of the higher education department,? said Chakraborty.

 The government?s decision comes as a gift to the madarsa on its 225th anniversary year. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will attend a function on February 17 to mark the occasion.

 The madarsa, in the Wellington area of central Calcutta, now offers both school-level and undergraduate and postgraduate courses (mostly on theology). While the school, on the ground floor of the main building, is affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, the graduation and postgraduation sections are affiliated to the higher education department. 

 The autonomous status will allow the institution to run undergraduate and postgraduate courses like any university. The institution will also be eligible to offer courses in subjects like political science, history, English and the sciences.

 The Kidwai committee, formed by the state government to revive madarsa education, had suggested that Calcutta Madarsa be allowed to function as an autonomous institution.

 Minister Chakraborty said the government is working on the proposal.

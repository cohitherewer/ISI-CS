 Her father is a watchman in Howrah. Her house a small room with hardly enough space for the family of four. She broke her hand at seven. Yet this did not deter Gayatri Singh, 18, from pursuing taekwondo from age eight.

 Today she is a black-belt holder (1st dan) awarded to her by the World Taekwondo Federation in Seoul. This means if the Indian taekwondo team qualifies for the Olympic games, Gayatri is eligible to represent the country.

 Gayatri?s taekwondo trip began 10 years ago, when she took up the sport despite opposition from her parents. She had to give up Bharatanatyam because pursuing both was beyond their means. ?Since my childhood I have dreamt of becoming a police officer. I felt that to become one, a person has to be good in combat. So I decided to take up taekwondo. My parents were against the decision because we could not afford it. Moreover my broken hand was a problem,? says Gayatri.

 Her father Om Prabhu admits that initially the family was opposed to Gayatri taking up martial arts. ?But when she persisted we had to give in.?

 Besides winning many tournaments at district and state level, Gayatri won silver in the first Goodwill International Taekwondo Championship in February in Lucknow where nine countries participated.

 Once, when her family could not rustle up enough cash, Gayatri borrowed Rs 2,000. ?During my growing up years, my family?s poverty would hurt me very much. There were times when we would get a chance to represent our district outside, but I could not go because there was no money. But now I have come to terms with it. I take a loan whenever I have to go out. Moreover, I earn Rs 600 every month by teaching children,? says Gayatri.

 Gayatri wants to teach taekwondo to the poor girls who come to her from various parts of the district.

 ?If some day I am able to realise my dream of becoming an IPS officer I would like to open a martial arts school for girls. I think this is one art all girls should learn. It will help them defend themselves against all mischief. Moreover it can be a viable career option,? says Gayatri.

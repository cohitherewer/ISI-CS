The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The electric meter room in our housing complex at Baguiati 

 is in a shambles with loose wires running all over the place. 

 All the occupants in the building are living under constant 

 threat of a fire hazard. The situation is quite serious 

 because the meter room is the only exit path from the building. 

 We wrote to the CESC two months back, but nothing has been 

 done. 

 Ranjan Parekh, Baguiati. 

 After Metro informed us of the fault, CESC officials 

 have conducted an inspection. It was observed that the renovation 

 of the meter board has to be done simultaneously with shifting 

 of main switches, leading to interruption in electric supply. 

 The meter box will be fixed as soon as the building members 

 give their consent to change the main switches.

 Biswarup Mukherjee, Sr Manager, PR, CESC.

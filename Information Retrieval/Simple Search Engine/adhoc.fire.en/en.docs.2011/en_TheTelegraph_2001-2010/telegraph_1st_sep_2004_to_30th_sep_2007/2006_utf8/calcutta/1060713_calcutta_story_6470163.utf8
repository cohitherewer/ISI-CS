The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To Mumbai with faith in God

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Passengers on the Howrah- Mumbai 2859 Up Geetanjali Express left Howrah station on Wednesday afternoon with a prayer on their lips. 

 ?The day after the Mumbai blasts, there was hardly any security check at Howrah station. I shall thank God if I reach my destination safely,? admitted Chhaya Sarkar, a resident of Malda Government Colony.

 Preety Khatun, 19, a resident of Kidderpore, added: ?Some security personnel came into the compartment but left without checking any baggage. God willing, I shall reach Mumbai safely.?

 The vigil, however, was visibly stepped up on passenger trains and on platforms playing host to local trains.

 ?We do not want to harass people unnecessarily. We are only running a check if there is something suspicious,? said K. Jayraman, superintendent of railway police, Howrah.

 There was also additional deployment at the entrance and exit of Metro Rail stations.

 Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said: ?We are also trying to make security guards in multi-storeyed buildings and shopping malls aware of how to remain alert for anything untoward.?

 A special disaster management team of 15 constables has been posted at Sealdah station. ?They have been provided with fluorescent orange jackets so that people can identify them from a distance,? said S.C. Sinha, chief security commissioner, Sealdah.

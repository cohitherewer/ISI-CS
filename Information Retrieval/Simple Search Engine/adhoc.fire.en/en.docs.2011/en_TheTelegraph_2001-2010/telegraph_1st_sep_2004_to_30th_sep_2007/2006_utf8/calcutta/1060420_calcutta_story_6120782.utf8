 CPM cadre manhandle teachers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two alleged CPM activists on Wednesday afternoon raided a Higher Secondary school in Howrah and manhandled six teachers, including the teacher-in-charge.

 ?These men, known to be CPM supporters of the area, stormed into my room and started abusing me. They then manhandled five of my assistant teachers and me,? alleged Tabraiz Alam Siddiqui, teacher-in-charge of Howrah Muslim Higher Secondary High School at 45, Belilious Road.

 Later, a group of teachers went to Howrah police station and submitted a mass petition demanding that the two be arrested. ?We have asked them to lodge a formal complaint so that we can properly investigate the matter,? said Akhil Kumar Roy, superintendent of police, Howrah.

 Siddiqui said the five teachers beaten up by the ?CPM goons? had worked as booth-level officers for the Election Commission. The school falls under Howrah Central Assembly constituency, which went to the Trinamul Congress last time. Sridip Bhattacharya, CPM district secretary, said: ?This is a serious allegation. I will look into the matter.?

 However, police said an inquiry suggested it was not a political issue but a dispute between guardians and the school authorities.

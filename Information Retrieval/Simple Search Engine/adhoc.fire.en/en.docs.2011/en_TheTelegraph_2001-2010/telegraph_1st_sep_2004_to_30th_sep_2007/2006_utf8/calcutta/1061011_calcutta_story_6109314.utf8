 Gambling traditions get trendy

 - Pre-Diwali, card stakes hit the roof and easy-money lure flares up

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Diwali is still 10 days away and celebrations are yet to kick-off, but the festive exchange rate is already ticking overtime. Huge sums of money are changing hands, from star hotel room to the Burrabazar gaddi.

 The run-up to Diwali is an occasion for people to meet in groups, play cards and have a good time, says entrepreneur Richa Srimal. So, its Teen Patti and Rummy time, right from Durga puja to Diwali.

 And heres another tradition gone trendy where to gamble, when to gamble, how much to gamble, everything has undergone a change. During Diwali, people perform pujas of goddess Lakshmi and Lord Ganesha. So, they want to try their luck, explains a businessman, for whom the stakes are rising with every passing day in the Diwali countdown.

 The venues of gambling have shifted from small rundown flats in Burrabazar to plush apartments in New Alipore, clubs and five-star rooms. 

 And the gambling amounts have vaulted from a few thousand to closer-to-the-crore mark.

 Many people book rooms in star hotels to gamble in peace. Men and women form different groups and gamble. Food and beverages are just a phone call away and so they can keep on gambling, often through the night, says a hotel spokesperson.

 At Hindusthan Club, there is a dedicated card room that crackles during Diwali. The members start playing from the morning. The booty is then deposited in their club accounts, says an official of the Sarat Bose Road club.

 This year, the gambling tables were laid during Durga puja itself, and the extended Lakshmi puja weekend with the Monday bandh just stoked the gambling fires. Especially among the young, say insiders. The lure of making a quick buck is the big draw among teens and beyond to make full use of the legitimate gambling window during this time of the year. Boredom is a factor, too, fuelled by the ban on crackers, complain some first-time gamblers. And the pot of gambling gold at the end of a hard nights play? Enough easy money to buy the latest gizmo. I have my sights set on a fancy cellphone set, which I will buy with my Diwali winnings, said Sandy, a college student.

 A watercolour artist who gave his chosen medium a solidity and sense of seriousness that it previously lacked, Shyamal Dutta Ray will also be remembered for treating themes that earlier exponents of the medium never handled before. Tribute, the ongoing retrospective of his paintings, presents 40 works, some recent and some from the days of his early youth, as a salute to the genius of this artist. The inner world reflected in his paintings relates to his memories of childhood, while his imagery is mostly drawn from personal experiences. A lonely childhood, the years of World War II and the Bengal famine are subjects he commonly dealt with in his earlier paintings. Poignant images of emaciated human figures recur in his later works, embodying the decaying, dingy and defiled nature of contemporary life. Depicting the world around him just as he saw it, without being either sentimental or cynical about it, Dutta Ray has brought to the forefront several unsettling aspects of urban society that we usually try to disprove.

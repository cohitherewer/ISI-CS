 Images that rip the veil

 - WOMEN THROUGH A LENS

 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of Shahidul Alam?s photographs

 It is highly debatable whether photography or any other medium can change the world, the way some artistes would like them to. Indeed, media can heighten awareness, if they so desire, as the recently-concluded show of photographs of Shahidul Alam (Drik, Bangladesh) and Shadi Ghadirian (Iran), at Birla Academy of Art and Culture, went to prove.

 One definitely associates Calcutta of the late 1960s with the Naxalite movement, but most have no idea that it had taken root in Bangladesh as well. Alam, who began his career as a photojournalist by documenting the democratic struggle to unseat General Ershad, Bangladesh President, exhibits large portraits of Bangladeshi women Naxalites, some with Hindu first names.

 Beneath each portrait is a soundbyte on how the subject came to be involved with the movement targeted at class enemies. These tell the stories of their indoctrination and subsequent exhilaration or disenchantment. The photographs are literally in-your-face, and some, like that of the mother of a leader in a large, uninhabited room, and that of a woman who is sceptical about the efficacy of the movement are quite moving. 

 They break the silence around the lives of these women about whom little is known. Most ? going by their dialect and clothes ? are of peasant stock. The Hindu women are better turned out and educated. Middle-aged now, they seem to have accepted domesticity with equanimity.

 Shadi Ghadirian graduated in photography in Tehran. In her remarkable sepia contrivances, women in the gear of a pre-revolutionary era are photographed in a studio with painted backdrops that were fashionable in early 20th Century. However, contemporary reality impinges on the lives of these women who are equipped with labour-saving devices, such as the vacuum cleaner, and gadgets like the portable sound system, as well as with ?feminine? ones such as a make-up set and a large mirror. The last mentioned is a beautiful image, with the glass catching the sunlight. The lives of these women are circumscribed and defined by these paraphernalia.

 Equally distinguished, and perhaps a little disturbing, too, are her colour images of veiled beings with symbols of domesticity, such as a kettle, an iron, a bunch of brooms and a cleaver pasted in the space where one would expect their faces to be. Shadi?s silent but resolute voice speaks out against the position of women in modern Iranian society without making a song and dance about it, as women have down the ages in this part of the world.

Life

 Liking it better than Ludo, almost

 IT TAKES A WORLD CUP AND A VOLLEY OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA TO REALISE THAT IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING

 I am not a soccer widow. I am not a soccer orphan. I am a soccer survivor. That is because of my strong will, as it is not easy to survive football fever now in the city. It inflames the citys imagination.

 A David Beckham cushion, it has been reported, is selling like hot cake from a happening store. There is an ad for a football meal at a high-end restaurant that links Beckham with Burrah Kebabs.

 Then there is an ad on a public-minded channel that is exhibited at many public places. In it, a prominent Bengali television actress, in heavy jewellery and a sari worn Gujarati-style, exhorts the audience to watch football and then performs a little nagin dance.

 us, I dont like the game. Its beautiful, of course, to watch 22 toned male bodies in motion, but I wish they moved slower.

 so because I dont like the speed. It must have been to do with my early years, when I was an East Bengal fanatic. In the Seventies and Eighties, when the whole Bangal para in Dum Dum rose and fell to Ajay Boses pulsating voice during an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match, I would head for the ceiling, too, as my father screamed G---A-A-A-L.

 But the two teams had the decency to move at a pace I could follow ? and this international-class speed I can never adjust to. 

 That is why you can blame everything on your childhood. Or parents. And anyway, Vijay Mallya bought both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.

 Give me Ludo any day. But I am watching this World Cup. Because I watched World Cup cricket. I am watching it for the ads. They are shocking.

 In its World Cup ad, instead of the blue and yellow jerseys filled with Indian institutions who are also known as cricketers, Coke lines up only bottles filled with their dark liquid. 

 They go further: instead of Aishwarya Rai, they feature a digitised diva in a lively football bikini. She is far more real than Aishwarya.

 But the Adidas ads are revolutionary. I dont know about their corporate crimes, but thanks to Adidas, this is the first time the Indian audience is watching a young boy conjure up his greatest fantasy without the aid of Shah Rukh, Sachin, Sehwag or Amitabh Bachchan. 

 Jose and Pedro, two boys in a dusty Latin American bylane, are trying to pick their dream team with some of the worlds best players. As they call each name, the superstars, including Beckham and Zidane, walk up before them.

 But Jose wants Beckenbauer. Pedro smirks, but the legend trots in right there from the 70s, and then, too, he had a touch of the scholar. Jose tells the stars what to do. They kick off the game. Compare that with Sehwag ki Ma. Adidas does it again.

 In the second spot, Jose has Lampard shooting and Kahn in goal saving, when Joses mother, an irate, wildly gesticulating woman who wants to get her son back home in time, starts hollering from a window above. Compare that with Sehwag ki Ma talking kheer. Impossible is nothing.

 A third spot has already been sighted. That leads us to critical questions bugging all development analysts in the country looking at surplus resources and disguised unemployment: where is Mandira Bedi hiding? And was she, then, as extra as the As in Extraa Innings? 

 But you will never know the answer till you can determine the number of As that were there in Extraa Innings.

 What you do know is that a filler is possible without her and she may have morphed into someone else. The filler on ESPN, Duniya Goal Hai, is truly a filler and is truly rubbish.

 True, there is too much talk about sausages ? the food item is used even to predict the fate of a match, it being Germany and football and a mans game and all that ? but then co-host Vinay Pathak claims he is a vegetarian and cannot get all the meanings. Same for me. 

 But in one sequence, when Pathak dresses up as a hot babe, I have a strong feeling it could actually be Mandira Bedi.

 Since Duniya, however, is telecast strictly between two matches and the ad breaks happen only during the breaks, I am getting to see a lot of football.

 I saw how Argentina managed a record 24 passes before scoring one of the six goals against Serbia. I may soon start talking about Beckhams set-piece moves and pinpoint crosses.

 There are many reasons for India to try to reach World Cup football. Television programming will be so much better. 

 I may even consider switching from Ludo. Impossible is nothing.

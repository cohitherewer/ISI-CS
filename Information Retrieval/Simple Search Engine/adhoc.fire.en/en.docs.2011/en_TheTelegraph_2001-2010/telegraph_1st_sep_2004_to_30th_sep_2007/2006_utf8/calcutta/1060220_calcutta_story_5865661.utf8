The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The crowded crossings at Esplanade, College Street, Gariahat 

 and Garia are the pedestrian?s nightmare. With the footpaths 

 occupied by hawkers, people are forced to walk on the roads. 

 The bus drivers are quite reckless and often halt in the 

 middle of the road to pick up more passengers during peak 

 hours. In the process, they also end up causing accidents. 

 I request the civic authorities to evict the roadside vendors.

 During a recent trip to Hyderabad, I noticed that the price 

 of tickets at the multiplexes is lower than that in Calcutta. 

 The bus fares are also very reasonable in respect of the 

 distance covered. In the past few years, bus fares in Calcutta 

 have risen tremendously. And the tickets at all multiplexes 

 are out of reach of the middle class. Even the prices of 

 tickets at Nandan have gone up although it is a government-run 

 cinema. Buses here are not clean and the jerky ride is a 

 big nuisance. 

 Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road. 

 I am confused why trams are being allowed on Chitpur Road. 

 As it is, the narrow and congested roads in the area create 

 problems. Though the area is well-connected by Metro and 

 bus on various routes, what is the necessity of concretising 

 the tram tracks?

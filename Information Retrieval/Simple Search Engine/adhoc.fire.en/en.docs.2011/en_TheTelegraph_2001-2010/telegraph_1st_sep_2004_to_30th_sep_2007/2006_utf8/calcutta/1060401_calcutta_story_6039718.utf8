 When friendship is based on tacit, mutual agreement, unnatural or unexpected behaviour by one among the circle is bound to destroy the apparently affable relationship that the friends share. Written by Yasmina Reza, Art is a popular comedy that raises an important sociological question: Are we who we think we are, or are we who our friends think we are? It opens with Serge buying a modern painting from a fashionable artist. His fascination for expensive works of art is not shared by his old friend Marc, who thinks Serge has been fooled and fleeced. Serge takes offence, and despite the efforts of their mutual friend, Yvan, who attempts to placate both sides, the various layers of the trio?s friendship begins to unravel. What gives this remarkably wise, witty and incisive play its edge is the way in which it reveals the animosities, lies and compromises that lurk under the skin of such relationships. Direction: Vivek Mansukhani. Presented by Spandan and Sanskriti Sagar.

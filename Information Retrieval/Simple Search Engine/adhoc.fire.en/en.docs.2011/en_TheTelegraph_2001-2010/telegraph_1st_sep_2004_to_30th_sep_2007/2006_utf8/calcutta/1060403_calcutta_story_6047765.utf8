 Monitor frown on campus litter

 - World Bank team points out CU deficiencies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 For the second time in six months, the World Bank has pulled up the Calcutta University (CU) authorities for lack of initiative in keeping the Rajabazar Science College campus clean.

 The team, constituted by the World Bank to monitor the progress of a Rs 30-crore project, visited the university last week to inspect how the fund was being utilised. 

 The World Bank is sponsoring the project that aims to improve the quality of education in the eight technology departments of CU, housed in the Rajabazar Science College.

 ?The university has taken adequate measures to correct the deficiencies that were pointed out by the academic and financial auditing team during the last inspection. But the performance of the university is not satisfactory in respect of maintaining cleanliness on the campus,? the team stated in its report, according to sources in the university.

 The first inspection was conducted in October 2005.

 The shabby look of the buildings and laboratories, filth littered on the campus, poor maintenance of lawns and inadequate garbage disposal facilities are some of the problem areas that have been identified by the team this time. 

 Waking up to criticism, the authorities are planning to launch a drive to clean the Rajabazar campus.

 ?We have chalked out a comprehensive plan to clean the campus. A meeting will soon be held with authorities of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. We have sought their help in the clean-up drive,? said Manab Kumar Sengupta, the CU science secretary. 

 He is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the departments at Rajabazar Science College.

 The university wants to approach the civic body for installation of a garbage vat on the campus. It also wants to ensure that the waste is removed regularly from the vat.

 The Rs 30-crore project is part of a Rs 153-crore plan, sponsored by the World Bank, to improve the quality of technology education in the state.

 Apart from CU, the other beneficiaries are Bengal Engineering and Science University, Jadavpur University, and seven engineering and technology institutes in the state. 

 After the October inspection, the World Bank team had expressed unhappiness at the university?s failure in introducing a system of assessment of teachers by students, which is a must to avail of the fund. 

 Excepting the computer science and engineering departments, the other seven department have started assessment of teachers? performance by students. The World Bank team has urged the university to ensure that the computer science and engineering department, too, puts the system in place as soon as possible.

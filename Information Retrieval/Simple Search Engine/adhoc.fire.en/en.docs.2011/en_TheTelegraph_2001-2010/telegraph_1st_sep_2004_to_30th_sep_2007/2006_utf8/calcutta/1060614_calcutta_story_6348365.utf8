 Ganja fuels rescuer flight

 - Two youths save woman from drowning herself, run when they see police coming

 PRONAB MONDAL

Sometimes, Good Samaritans have to flee.

 On Monday afternoon at Rabindra Sarobar, two young men saw a woman jumping into the water in a bid to kill herself. They saw two policemen coming from the opposite direction, but the cops had not noticed the woman. So, the duo plunged right in, caught hold of the woman and fished her out. And then, they ran away.

 Police came to know the reason later. The two rescuers were ganja-smokers who frequented the Lakes, often drinking country liquor. They would not face the police for their life ? or anybody else?s.

 ?These addicts always run away when we go for a routine patrol in the Sarobar area. This is why the two fled as soon as they spotted the men in uniform,? said an officer of Lake police station. 

 Police said the woman (name withheld on request) was a Lake Gardens resident and the wife of a navy engineer. Police admitted her to a nursing home nearby.

 ?She had left home after an altercation with her husband. We have talked to her and she is fine now,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 Around 2.30 pm, the woman was seen loitering on the banks of the Lakes. ?She went to an isolated spot, took off her shoes and plunged into the water. The patrolling policemen realised this only after the two youths had jumped into the water,? Kumar added.

 The two had been sitting behind a tree, smoking ganja, police said, when they saw the woman. ?They rescued her, but as soon as they spotted us, they put the unconscious woman on the ground and ran away. We told them to stop, but they fled,? said the deputy commissioner.

 ?Smoking ganja is not a rarity in the Lakes, and the two feared arrest if the policemen got hold of them,? said an officer. ?We came to know about the woman?s identity when her family members came to lodge a missing diary,? he added.

 Also at the Lakes, two constables on Sunday night had rescued a 25-year-old youth attempting suicide.

 For Manish Malhotra, Bollywoods 

 favourite designer, crochet was the perfect respite when 

 he got sick of colours and loud embellishments. 

 Anju Modi uses the same to showcase her understated 

 design sensibilities and closer home, Abhishek Dutta 

 always uses crochet to infuse a dash of femininity 

 into his ensembles. 

 Crochet boasts quite a portfolio for a charming chain emerging from a simple slipknot loop on a simpler hook. After starring on the ramp for most big designer names fall-winter 2006 collection, from John Galiano to Manish Malhotra, crochet is now seen on almost every fashion rack from 85 Lansdowne to New Market. Crochet is a craze. GoodLife explores the trend. 

 Delicate detail

 When after a long run, heavy embroidery and shimmering sequins were shown the door, delicate detailing was the need of the hour. Crochet, with its pretty poise, fitted the bill. Designers turned to it gladly. It went beautifully with the forecast of the no-clutter, clean look, while allowing the designer to display as much handwork skill as with heavy embroidery. 

 There has been a lot of cleaning up in fashion ? of silhouettes, prints and embellishments. The look this season is sophisticated and classic, says designer Raghavendra Rathore. 

 Says Anju, on the comeback of crochet: Fashion is cyclical and the revival of crochet from our grandmothers generation is not surprising, specially since most of our next generation doesnt know the art. We have such easy access to skilled labour in India that crochet is just the right decorative detailing. 

 Today, crochet is everywhere. Not only on bags, belts and trimmings, but crochet also finds place on hair-bands, skirt panels, sari pallas, fish-cut lehngas and sexy shrugs. 

 Thread twist

 Woollen crochet, according to Anju, is the next big thing this fall-winter. Wool also boasts more texture than thread, making it even more interesting, she says.

 Snug wrap tops, cute cardigans and layered skirts? The style statement this fall is bound to be crochet-centric. 

 Abhishek too has been keen on crochet for the past years and metallic crochet has emerged as one of his strong signatures. A hint of crochet can give a garment a soft, feminine touch that nothing else can. Be it a skirt, corset or a bustier, a crochet edging lends a royal look, he says. 

 Heres his variation: instead of traditional threads and natural colours, he uses processed zari. The shade card? Lots of magenta, turquoise and gold to lend an antique touch as well as a twist in the tale.

 For him

 Extensive use of crochet marked Manishs mens line at Lakme Fashion Week earlier this year. The good news is that apart from the likes of model Upen Patel, men off the ramp, too, are into crochet. 

 This is because men are game for anything, specially when it comes to something feminine, he wants to drive home his point loud and clear, says Anju. 

 Enter a plethora of crocheted designs for men. And this time, these arent just skirting the edges. Collars and sleeves apart, men are sporting complete crochet panels and stoles too, says Abhishek. Anju has a word of advice: Men should stick to slightly flat, geometric crochet patterns.

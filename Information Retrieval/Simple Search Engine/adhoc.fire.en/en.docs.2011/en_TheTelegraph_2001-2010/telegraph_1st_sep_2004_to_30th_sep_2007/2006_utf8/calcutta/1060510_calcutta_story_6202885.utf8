The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Protection plea rerun

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Saraswati Sinha and her children knocked on the doors of 10, Alimuddin Street again on Tuesday, seeking protection from a gang of goons led by Dum Dum?s CPM councillor Swapan Saha.

 The family met party state secretary Biman Bose and chief minister?s personal assistant Joydeep Mukherjee and described how Saha was plotting to drive them out of even their temporary refuge, the house of Saraswati?s sister, near the airport. 

 The Sinhas have been staying there ever since their house in Kalidham was vandalised by Saha and Co. on April 28. The councillor and his men, who wanted a part of the house for a club, also assaulted Saraswati?s daughter Runu.

 ?The CPM men are now threatening my sister for providing us shelter. Tell me, where should we go?? Saraswati appealed to Bose.

 ?Joydeepbabu, whom we had earlier met on May 1, was surprised that the CPM men were still threatening us. He assured us that the issue would be resolved at a local-level meeting on May 20,? she added.

 Apart from Mukherjee, the Sinhas had also met CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar on May 1 and narrated their ordeal.

 Special inspector-general of police (Presidency range) Surojit Kar Purakayastha, asked by the state human rights commission to probe the Sinhas? complaint, has promised protection to the family.

 Purakayastha, who has sought a report from the North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar, said the local police station had been asked to arrange security for the Sinhas. 

 Metro on Tuesday had carried a report on how Saha?s men were threatening Saraswati?s sister ?with dire consequences? if the Sinhas continued to stay in her house.

 Swapan Gupta, secretary of the CPM?s Dum Dum zonal committee, claimed during the day that Saha was unaware of the threats from his aides. ?Those involved in the act will face disciplinary action,? he asserted.

Helpless hand of god

Stage On amp; Off

 Strange as it may seem, that is God above. He has come down to earth below. In mufti, of course, following the accepted practice. And his character, known as Pagal, is the most unusual one in Rangroop?s Hey Mor Debata (picture below). 

 He feigns muteness to everyone, but talks to a select few of his choice ? children and those rare adults whom he knows embody the best qualities of humanity. He also talks to us, commenting on the stage proceedings, but confides in us his powerlessness to alter human destiny. 

 Scripted by Sima Mukhopadhyay from a short story by Deborshi Saroghee, Hey Mor Debata is an otherwise simple drama pleading for pacifism in inter-community relations. 

 Set at the time of the Turk invasions, it presents the fissures in Hindu society split open by casteism. Instead of uniting to ward off the aggressor, the Brahmins persist in condemning the lower castes as inferior, who in turn plot to use this opportunity to oust them from their tyranny. 

 Only one Brahmin, significantly named Bhabananda, symbolises the non-violent spirit of love for all creation in an attempt at reconciliation. But all in vain.

 The cast puts in fine performances. As the divine ?madman? torn asunder by human folly, Shyamal Chakraborty is particularly outstanding and almost unrecognisable, confirming his place as one of the top actors in Bengali theatre. 

 Debasish Roy Choudhury also dons for him an unusual negative garb, of the criminalistic anti-Brahmin leader, and does so successfully. It is much more difficult to portray a virtuous character like Bhabananda without falling into typical saintly platitudes; Jayanta Mitra does the best he can in this situation.

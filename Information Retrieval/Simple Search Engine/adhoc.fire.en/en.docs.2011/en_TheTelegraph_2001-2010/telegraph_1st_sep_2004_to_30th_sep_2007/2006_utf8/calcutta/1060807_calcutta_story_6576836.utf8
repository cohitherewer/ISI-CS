The Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) will rebuild the damaged balconies of four apartments on BB Chatterjee Road, in Kasba, that collapsed during Saturday nights rain. There was no casualty.

 We have been removing the debris since early on Sunday for reconstructing the damaged parts, said local CPM councillor Dipu Das. 

 Fourteen families were shifted to flats in other blocks after the chain collapse of the balconies. The fourth-floor balcony of Block III of the 40-year-old CIT Buildings was the first to cave in.

 The balconies collapsed around 11.15 pm, while we were returning home after attending a meeting for organising Durga puja. We first heard a rumbling sound and then saw the balconies collapse one after another, recalled Gopal Mukherjee, who lives in a first-floor flat in the same block.

 Mukherjee said the mishap might have been fatal had it occurred by day. Children often play under the balconies, he said.

 The estate has six buildings, comprising 210 flats, constructed in 1975 to accommodate those who were evicted for the construction of Bijon Setu, connecting Ballygunge with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 Councillor Das and mayoral council member (buildings) Dipankar De visited the site on Sunday to oversee the cleaning operation. Engineers from the CIT and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation accompanied the duo. Das said officials would meet on Tuesday to discuss the modalities for renovating the affected buildings.

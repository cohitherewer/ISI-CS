 Tapas Roy, Amitabha Chakravarty and Md Sohrab have been sweating it out under the April sun, going door to door pleading for votes in the Burrabazar constituency. 

 They could have saved themselves all the trouble, if only they could sing like Sandeep Acharya.

 The boy from Bikaner, crowned the second Indian Idol on Sony late on Saturday, was the toast of Burrabazar this weekend, upstaging politicians in the run-up to Poll 2006.

 It was election come early in the trade hub last week, as fan clubs distributed free cellphones for SMS voting, conducted door-to-door campaigns and performed yagnas for the ?local boy?.

 The epicentre of voting for a song ? or rather a singer ? was P-7, Kalakar Street, a large dilapidated address housing 52 members from Sandeep Acharya?s extended family. ?We used to stay in the same house in Bikaner. He is my aunt?s son,? said Ajay Purohit. ?His father was not enthusiastic about Sandeep singing. But we encouraged him as we felt he would excel in it.?

 For Sandeep, his voters themselves campaigned with banners and pamphlets to boost his vote count ? enough to make the most seasoned politician go green with envy.

 ?At even chai shops, customers were first requested to vote for Sandeep before being served. His relatives went canvassing from door to door. Some of his supporters bought hundreds of cellphones and distributed them free, so that people could vote for Sandeep,? revealed Rajshree Bihani, a friend of the family.

 On winning the second Indian Idol crown ? which came with a Rs 1 crore Sony contract ? Sandeep said: ?I am so happy to see the kind of love and support I have been getting from the entire nation, especially from Bikaner.?

 What he probably didn?t know was that in a pocket of central Calcutta, he had managed to steal the pre-poll thunder of politicians.

 And the excitement peaked just when poll fever was catching on in Burrabazar. 

 ?Initially, the Sandeep Acharya Fan Club, opened in the Kalakar Street building two months ago, would remain vacant. But when he made it to the last 10, everything changed,? said Rajkumar Vyas, who also hails from Bikaner.

 As soon as the Sony show would start, all male members of the family ? the women were glued to the TV at home ?would gather at the club and start voting furiously for Sandeep.

 And when he won the second edition of Indian Idol on Saturday night, the celebrations at Burrabazar would have shamed political parties. 

 ?We took out a procession till 3 am. Sweets were distributed and puja was performed,? smiled Swayam Purohit, who had distributed 500 cellphones to increase Sandeep?s SMS vote share.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Writer and columnist

 The Americans with no mythology of their own need to create it via characters like Spiderman and Superman. We have always had superheroes. Krrish is not our model. It?s a western clone. There is nothing superheroic about someone who flies in the air. It?s gimmick. The superhero is technology, not the character. Indians will not relate to it. They?d rather watch Hanuman. In life, we are desperately in need of a superhero. It used to be our cricketers but they have failed us too many times. In politics or public life, there is no one to look up to. For me, it?d be Arjuna from Mahabharata. an inspiring figure with courage and vulnerability, heroism and romanticism.

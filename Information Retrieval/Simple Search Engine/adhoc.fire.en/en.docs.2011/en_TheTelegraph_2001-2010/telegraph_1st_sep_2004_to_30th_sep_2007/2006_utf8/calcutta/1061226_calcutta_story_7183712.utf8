 In a drive that continued through Christmas eve, 39 youths were rounded up across the city on the charge of mischievous conduct in public.

 Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), however, claimed that no major untoward incident was reported on Saturday night, as we had in place a tight vigil in the popular hangout zones.

 Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani and Camac Street were among the thoroughfares that were under the scanner. Cops in uniform as well as plainclothesmen were on patrol, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south).

 Most of the arrests were carried out in the central and south divisions. The youths, all in their 20s, were drunk and misbehaving with passers-by. Some were also passing lewd comments at women, said an officer of Park Street thana.

 Twelve youths were picked up in front of discos. They were so drunk that they could barely walk, but that did not stop them from disturbing others, said an officer of the south division.

 After the arrest, police first contacted their families. Cases were registered against them in front of their parents.

 Ten youths were rounded up in the west port and Watgunge areas.

 Police asserted that a similar drive would be undertaken on the December 31 night.

 We will keep a close eye on year-end revellers. Stern action would be taken against anyone found indulging in unlawful activities, said deputy commissioner Chatterjee.

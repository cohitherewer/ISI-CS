 New Market traders have stalled work on the underground car park on Lindsay Street, but CPM insiders said that the traders? fury is being fuelled by party feud.

 Last Friday, a 200-strong crowd from the market gathered on Lindsay Street, above the site of Parkomat, the two-storey parking lot being built opposite New Market. They shouted slogans against the car park and threw stones and bricks from above at the underground workers, including two engineers from Holland. 

 They were angry that the parking lot for 281 cars (lower underground floor), which will come with a shopping complex (on the upper underground floor), will destroy their livelihood. 

 The area above the car park, facing New Market, is slated to be developed into a pedestrian plaza with food courts. The traders are scared that the plaza and the car park will lure shoppers into the air-conditioned shopping complex away from New Market. 

 The protesters, who formed the S.S. Hogg Market Traders? Association led by Debu Bhattacharya and Ashok Gupta, demanded that the 20,000 sq ft shopping complex and the pedestrian plaza be dropped from the plan. 

 Since Friday, work has halted on the pedestrian plaza. Simplex Projects Ltd, Calcutta, which is building the car park with EWW Technische Bedrijven BV from Amsterdam, said it was scheduled to open before Puja 2006. Work at the underground level has resumed, but Simplex, ready to test-run 50 cars at the car park on Thursday, does not know when ?Asia?s first fully-automated underground car park? will be completed. 

 CPM insiders say that the parking lot?s fate is hanging between two councillors? camps. If the project succeeds, it will be a feather in mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya?s cap. His critics don?t want it that way. 

 On Friday, the protesters were led by councillor Sheila Kapoor and former councillor from the area Prabhakar Mandal. The protests are supported by MP Sudhangshu Sil. When municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay requested the crowd to meet mayor-in-council member Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, who is close to the mayor, they refused. 

 ?If the project materialises, Bhattacharyya would get a lot of credit. Some leaders, miffed with his appointment as mayor, don?t want that,? said a mayor-in-council member. 

 ?It is an internal feud of the party. They want to put obstacles in Bhattacharyya?s path,? said a civic official. 

 Bhattacharyya, who was out of town then, later said ?traders cannot dictate terms?.

 Traders have complained before that the construction, started in 2003, has affected the market?s sale badly.

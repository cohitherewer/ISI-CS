 Based on a true story from the court files of Bihar, Waarish tells a shocking tale of lust, abuse of power and superstition. Obsessed in his desire to produce an heir, Chiranji Chowdhury, a childless, lecherous landlord, tries to seduce Gulabi, his wife?s maid. In exchange for begetting a child by her, he offers land, property and other monetary gains to her impoverished father. He also promises that after the birth of his child, he would marry off Gulabi to Raghu, a motor mechanic with whom she is in love. Gulabi knows that she will suffer a fate similar to that of several other girls of the village, unless she accedes to Chowdhury?s desires. The depraved, superannuated landlord also tries to recover his long-lost virility by offering an infant-girl as human sacrifice. Meanwhile, Gulabi gets pregnant by Raghu, and they run away to escape from Chowdhury, who is now desperate to sire a child. Direction: Rishi Mukhopadhyay.

party at ITC Sonar Bangla, Pictures by Rashbehari Das.

What: Party hosted by Minu and Sanjay Budhia 

to celebrate the National Day of Malaysia.

 Where: Pala at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: Monday evening.

 The bash: Beautiful floral arrangements in white and silver adorned the ceiling and the walls; trees with small lamps hanging from the branches stood in the corners to create an ambience befitting a grand party.

 The annual bash hosted by the Budhias started quite early in the evening and wrapped up by midnight.

 Catching up with friends and associates while nursing a drink was just the thing to do. Sanjay and Minu welcomed each guest at the entrance, she dressed in a black Sabyasachi number and he sporting a printed black shirt.

 Spotted: The crowd was an eclectic mix from various fields art, culture, music, films, theatre, fashion, business and industry, administrative services and consulates. This included mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, Girija Devi, S.K. Birla, Harsh Neotia, Sanjiv and Preeti Goenka, Rajeev Kaul, S.B. Ganguly, Shuvaprasanna, P.K. Banerjee, Chuni Goswami, Nabanita Dev Sen and more.

 The celebrity quotient was pushed up by the presence of Debasree Roy, Rimjhim Mitra, Monami Ghosh, Arindam Sil, Tapas Pal, Bickram Ghosh, Tanmoy Bose, Mamata Shankar, Tanusree Shankar, Priti Patel, Alokananda Roy and Sharbari Datta, among others.

 Sip bite: The wide vegetarian buffet was split into street food, north Indian, south Indian and Continental, with a sumptuous dessert spread.

 Voiceover: When people respond to your invitation, you feel good. Everyone has multiple invitations and multiple choices to spend their precious evening but if they care to come, they should feel they have not wasted their evening. The idea of the party is to have fun and relax, smiled Sanjay Budhia.

 Rakhi rage

 What: Performance by Rakhi Sawant. 

 Where: Tantra.

 When: Saturday night.

 The star: It was Rakhi Sawants second trip to Calcutta in seven days but the party people in the city maange more, it seems. People started queuing up outside Tantra as early as 10 pm but the Mirchi girl made an appearance only 30 minutes after midnight.

 In a black dress, Rakhi sent the crowd into a tizzy with her raunchy moves to Yeh mera dil pyar ka deewana and Beedi. In her second coming, in another short black number, she jiggled to Shakiras Hips dont lie and Aa jaane jaan.

 While the hotbod sizzled on the bartop, mobile cameras kept zooming in. And after every sequence Rakhi would shower CDs (featuring her songs, of course), champagne and flying kisses on the raucous revellers. 

 Voiceover: The crowd in Calcutta reciprocates. Seeing people half hanging from the Bodhi Bar just to have a look at me is such a nice feeling, smiled Rakhi.

 Thai treats 

 What: Destination Thailand, hosted by Royal Thai Consulate General in Calcutta. 

 Where: The ballroom at The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Monday evening. 

 Take a look: Destination Thailand offered something for everyone from the taste of exotic Thai cuisine to the fragrance of aromatic Thai oils to a visual presentation on the landscape and a round-up with Thai music.

 Counters showcasing Nibhana Mystical Spirit of Spa, Thai Elite, Thai (airways) and Tourism Authority of Thailand, kept the guests busy. The display at Nibhana comprised a range of body scrubs made of Belgium dark chocolate, tamarind, oatmeal and milk and the aroma oil section boasted soothing mixes like jasmine-bergamot, camomile-lemongrass and lime-eucalyptus. A range of antiseptic body compresses, too.

 The presentation gave a glimpse of the hilly northern region as well as the rich marine life of south Thailand, focussing equally on the cuisine, culture and spas.

 Voiceover: Its true that Thailand is already a popular tourist pick in Calcutta but todays youth equates Thailand with Bangkok, Phuket and Pattaya. Thailand, with all its lesser-known islands, can offer much more than these three cities, and Destination Thailand will showcase it all, said Manop Mekprayoonthong, consul-general of Thailand in Calcutta.

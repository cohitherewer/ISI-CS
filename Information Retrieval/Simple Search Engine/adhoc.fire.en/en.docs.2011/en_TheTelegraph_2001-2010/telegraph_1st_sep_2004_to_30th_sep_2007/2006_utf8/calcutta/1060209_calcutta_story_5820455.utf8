 As a literary genre, the short story is remarkable for its power to articulate powerful statements and sentiments in a short span of time. This evening, Nandikar presents stage adaptations of two such stories written by two of the most popular authors of the preceding century. Chokh Gyalo (a scene from the play appears above), based on Tarashankar Bandopadhyay?s Daini, narrates the tragic tale of a woman, hounded as a witch all her life. Commenting on superstitious beliefs, born of illiteracy and ignorance, the play also examines the psychological impact of social ostracism on its victims. Directed by Goutam Halder; performed by Swatilekha Sengupta. In Barda, based on Munshi Premchand?s Bade Bhai Sahab, an old gentleman?s childhood reminiscences of his elder brother, touched with implicit pathos, remind us of the importance of traditional values, morals and an upright character. Direction and acting: Goutam Halder.

 Event: Plays in Bengali, Chokh Gyalo and Barda, produced by Nandikar 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Girish Mancha

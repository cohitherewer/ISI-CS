The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cup of joy and screen savers

 Studies, summer and now soccer ? the party spirit in Calcutta is slipping from one slump to another. But Cup or no Cup, the other entertainment zone in town ? the multiplexes ? is scaling one peak after the other. 

 With the big boys of soccer mostly playing at night (9.30 pm IST or midnight), the nightclub blues that began with the examination season and then soared with the Celsius have now been buttressed by the World Cup.

 ?At present, World Cup football is more popular than Team India cricket among the party-hopping youth. The impact is bound to show on the dance floor, just like it did on Friday night with everyone glued to the television at home,? says Saikat Sarkar, general manager, Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion.

 With football fever gripping the city and at least one big team taking the field in Germany every night, the turnout at the night spots is bound to be thinner for the next few weeks, fear managers.

 Some party places are adopting the policy of ?if you can?t beat it, join it?. Tantra, for instance, has decided to screen all matches live on a giant screen. ?Soccer is as close to the heart of the youth here as partying is. So why should they miss out on either?? argues a spokesperson for The Park.

 Others are not too sure that will work. For many football fanatics, big matches are meant to be viewed in relative quiet, with select family members and friends. Following every cross from the flank is as important as catching every word the commentator says.

 ?There is nothing like watching a game of soccer with friends at home. It?s difficult to follow a match in a nightclub,? says party regular Naveen Pai. And, the effect of soccer is already visible ? and audible ? in the party circuit. ?On Friday night, during the Germany vs Costa Rica match, a nightclub had to turn down the music so that the football fans could follow the commentary,? says DJ Akash.

 The big screen, however, seems unfazed with all the hullabaloo around soccer. In fact, even as the World Cup got underway last Friday night, the plexes entered one of the hottest weekends in recent times, with three new releases ? Phir Hera Pheri, Chup Chup Ke and Mission Impossible 3.

 ?It has been a huge weekend with an average occupancy of more than 95 per cent,? says an INOX spokesperson. While both the INOX addresses have been specially decked up for the World Cup, all the attention was on Tom Cruise and Paresh Rawal, rather than David Beckham and Dwight Yorke.

 And even the big matches may not have an effect with blockbusters like Krrish and Superman Returns around the corner. ?Like Biwi No. 1 showed during the cricket World Cup in 1999, if the content is good, people will continue to come to the theatres,? adds 89 Cinemas vice-president Prashant Shrivastava.

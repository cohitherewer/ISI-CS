The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Connected, via heritage

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Improved connectivity with mainland Europe, a facelift to basic infrastructure and professional packaging of the heritage highs could combine to make Calcutta a stopover hub for wealthy western tourists en route to southeast Asian destinations, feels Germany?s leading travel agency.

 ?The key, of course, is direct flights, and Lufthansa?s return to Calcutta later this year should be a huge step to plug that gap. However, it?s equally important to have decent infrastructure in and around the airport, like duty-free shops, contemporary cafes and the like, since that?s where the tourist?s experience begins,? Markus Nehmer of First Reisebuero told Metro on Friday.

 Nehmer is part of the 45-member German business delegation in town to explore collaboration possibilities in different areas. ?It?s realistically not feasible to project Calcutta as an independent tourist destination, since there isn?t enough to hold attention for two weeks,? he said.

 The representative of one of Europe?s largest tour operators, however, is convinced the city can earn ?serious foreign exchange? by becoming a short-stay stopover. 

 The Darjeeling Himalayas, the Dooars tea gardens, the Sunderbans mangrove forests and, of course, the tradition and cultural prowess of Calcutta need to be packaged better to do the trick, Nehmer felt.

 ?Calcutta has a very strong recall in Germany, unlike say Bangalore or Hyderabad, and there are even songs about the city sung back home. For European tourists, this is one of the most significant old cities, steeped in heritage and that?s what they want to see, not the swank new malls or the IT parks, really,? the travel trade official stressed.

 First, Reisebuero advised city tour operators to showcase Calcutta and Bengal at the ITB in Berlin, the world?s largest travel and tourism fair. 

 ?It?s important to spread the good word around and the ITB is probably the best platform to reach out to the most important members of the trade,? Nehmer underlined.

 There was acknowledgement for Calcutta?s growing stature as the region?s leading healthcare hub as well, with a top German architecture firm, specialising in hospital design and planning, hawking its expertise to city architects and prospective partners in medical facilities.

 ?In contemporary hospital design, efficient use of space is the key. Our aim is to create spaces and spatial connectivity to facilitate and support this over mere technical medicare alone,? said Volker Koelsch, managing partner, S+P International GmbH.

 Camaraderie for campus

 - Biz barons band together to set up IIM-style institute in Joka

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For once, collective effort scored over individual enterprise and collaboration counted more than competition, as some leading Marwari businessmen got together on Monday to unveil plans for a big education project.

 Coming together on the common platform of the Marwari Balika Vidyalaya Society ? an educational trust formed in 1920 ? the likes of B.M. Khaitan and S.K. Birla announced the setting up of a technology and management campus in Bishnupur, on Diamond Harbour Road, by mid-2008. The project, estimated to cost about Rs 50 crore, will be funded by the society, through contributions from philanthropists, and with institutional loans.

 ?It is a landmark moment for all of us. Instead of doing this on our own separately, we have decided to come under this banner and do something for all,? said Khaitan.

 S. K. Birla, another trustee of the society, explained the aim of the initiative: ?We plan to make this a centre of excellence in technology and management studies. Co-educational and residential in nature, the campus will attract the best students from all over India and even abroad.?

 The society has already acquired 15 acres of land, on which preliminary work has started, seven km south of the IIM Joka campus. The yet-to-be-named institute will introduce undergraduate as well as postgraduate courses, in a phased manner.

 Courses offered will be in the emerging areas of technology and management, such as chemical engineering, electronics, IT and software engineering. It is also eyeing tie-ups with universities of international repute to facilitate student and faculty exchange programmes, internship programmes and structuring of course curriculum.

 ?We have already received positive indications from an American university? We have to position ourselves in the same leagues as the IIMs,? said B. M. Khaitan.

 The board of trustees ? including G.P. Goenka, G.K. Khaitan, B.D. Sureka, G.D. Kothari, G.S. Kayan and R.N. Jhunjhunwala ? plans to seek affiliation with an appropriate university in Bengal, as per AICTE guidelines.

 What: A range of ceramic products

 Where: Osho World at Forum, fourth floor

 How much: Rs. 480 onwards

 Natural forms and sober tones, 

 some glazed and some matte, blend to make an exquisite collection 

 of ceramic ware at Osho World. Designed and executed by 

 city-based ceramic designer Aanupamaa G. Jalan, the line 

 exudes calm and serenity, in sync with the essence of Osho 

 World.

 Inspired by all things natural, 

 the product range comprises dip plates, bowls, mugs, plates, 

 candleholders, soup bowls and Buddha heads. The collection 

 comprising five different series is surely worth more than 

 just a look. 

 The Champa series consists mostly 

 of decorative pieces like candleholders and stands, also 

 some bowls and plates. The champa flower has 

 an inherent architectural feel to it, its shape being made 

 of simple squares and rounds, explains Aanupamaa. 

 Translated on ceramics, along 

 with its buds and leaves, these take the shape of simple 

 plates and bowls, very much like the original flower. 

 The spiral series boasts exotic 

 bowls and plates in metallic brown. To take the circular 

 form further, the flow extends to the spiral form attached 

 to these pieces. There is a hint of transparency within 

 to enhance the spiral movement, explains Aanupamaa. 

 The third series comprising bowls 

 and plates is inspired by a turned leaf. Shiny 

 and glazed in both look and feel, to bring out the natural 

 sheen of a leaf, this is available in a set, one resembling 

 a dried leaf and the other a fresh one. They are made 

 deeper to increase the utility quotient, she says.

 The other two series inspired 

 by the lotus flower is refreshingly beautiful. More so, 

 because according to Osho, the lotus flower was special 

 and he considered it a symbol of sannyas in 

 the east. Design-wise too, the lotus boasts additional 

 qualities. The lotus flower has its unique characteristics 

 and it can be used well on a flat surface, says Aanupamaa. 

 Thus emerged a collection of plates 

 and bowls, diya holders and candlelight holders that 

 were then placed on bamboo to enhance the touch of 

 nature. The deep-green and brown lotus-leaf series, 

 she adds, is inspired from a lotus pond in Santiniketan.

 The lotus appliqu? series boasts 

 a line of plates and bowls, varying interestingly in width 

 dimensions. The part where the flower is placed is 

 wider than the other end. This is what make the otherwise 

 simple, round piece interesting, explains Aanupamaa. 

 The glazed dark blue boasts a textured centre that draws 

 the eye to the flower despite the depth of the centre.

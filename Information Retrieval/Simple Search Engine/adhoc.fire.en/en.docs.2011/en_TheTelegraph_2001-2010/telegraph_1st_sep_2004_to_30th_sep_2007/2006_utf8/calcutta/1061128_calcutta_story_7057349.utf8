 Artist impossible to pigeon-hole

 SOUMITRA DAS

 As an artist, Partha Pratim Deb remains as elusive as ever. It is well nigh impossible to pin down the hallmarks of his work. Is he only an excellent draughtsman? He is not, because there is proof of superior painterly qualities in his recent work that challenges such as an assertion. These are on show at Akriti gallery.

 One cannot say he is an abstract artist either. Human figures pop up in both his drawings and paintings. Add to that his cheeky sense of humour and ability to make light of the gravest of situations.

 Debs creativity is not confined to paperwork. He cobbles together pulp, terracotta, plywood, pieces of rejected canvas and whatever is readily available to produce simple works that speak volumes for his clarity of vision. 

 Many of his paintings have figures but they are, at times, overwhelmed by the painted areas. Even when he uses oil and acrylic on canvas, from afar they look like large prints because he often uses the imprints of a variety of material that give his pictures a highlytextured skin.

 In one painting, the painted space is divided into two horizontal halves yellow and green with a red-and-black striped air sock rearing its head above the horizon. The mottled surface looks like gouache but it is actually oil colour.

 In an acrylic, a toad-like form appears against the deep red and bottle green surface. Deb often makes use of such forms that have little to do with the real world. His colours seem to have a life of their own and assume fanciful shapes. He introduces figures amidst layers of paint floating like clouds or rising to a crescendo.

 His middle-aged human figures verging on caricature are depicted as vulnerable creatures caught in moments that make them look pitiably ludicrous sky diving, swimming with flippers on, or just skinny dipping for joy, with their buns and glasses on. A mild poke at the follies of the middle-aged.

 His line drawings are the best. In some, a skein of black thread seems to unwind and create these humans close to primates. There are large figures with big areas of black and white. In the space in between, the black disintegrates into fine lines. His quirky lines go on a rollercoaster ride, twisting and turning and wrapping themselves around pieces of a checkerboard. For sheer innovativeness there are few to match Partha Pratim Deb.

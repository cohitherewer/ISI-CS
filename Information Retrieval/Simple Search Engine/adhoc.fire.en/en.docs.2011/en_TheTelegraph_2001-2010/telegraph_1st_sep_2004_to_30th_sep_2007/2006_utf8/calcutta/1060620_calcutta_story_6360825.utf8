Damages for estate

 A STAFF REPORTER

The state consumer disputes redressal commission has directed the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to pay a compensation of more than Rs 20 lakh to people allotted flats at Sourav Abasan, in Salt Lake. The commission acted on a petition by the cooperative housing society of the estate.

 The cooperative members alleged that several construction defects were detected after the CMDA handed over the flats to the allottees in December 2002. The flats, in Salt Lake?s EE block, were leased to 106 people for 999 years. 

 ?The CMDA shall remove the defects as pointed out by a chartered engineering firm within a period of 90 days from the date of communication of this order, failing which it shall pay a compensation of Rs 18,51,823 to the complainant cooperative society,? the commission said in its order.

 It also directed the CMDA to pay another Rs 2 lakh to the cooperative members for harassment and mental agony.

 The commission found that the CMDA had neglected to take ?corrective steps to remove defects in the newly-constructed flats? and made ?restrictive provisions in the lease deed?.

 In their complaint to the commission, the housing society had stated that in the deed of lease, the CMDA had deliberately incorporated clauses to cover up defects.

 The agreement exempted the CMDA from undertaking repair or rectification of any defect in any flat once it was handed over to the lessee or the allottee-members. 

 No complaints regarding design layout, accommodation specification, fittings and fixtures, and amenities provided in the flats would be entertained by the CMDA after the transfer, the document stated.

 The lessees had appointed an engineering firm that figures on the list of Registered Valuers of Calcutta High Court. It submitted a survey report on November 26, 2004, identifying defects in several areas, including the sewerage system, service drain, waterlogging in lift-well, waste lines, shutters, marble and kota floors, water tank on roof, roof tiles and painting of the inside and outside walls.

 ?We will take a decision once we get a copy of the verdict,? said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the CMDA.

 200 crore to boost water network

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has drawn up a plan to bring 85 per cent of the citys population within the filtered surface water network by 2009. It is investing over Rs 200 crore for the project.

 At present, 62 per cent of the population is supplied with filtered surface water. 

 The previous Trinamul Congress-BJP civic board had invested a whopping Rs 390 crore to provide a major boost to the water supply infrastructure. But the efforts failed to expand the network, with only 35 of the 300 deep tubewells having been sealed.

 People in pockets of east Calcutta, Garden Reach and Behala continue to face severe water crisis.

 To redress the water supply problem, we have taken up an integrated plan at a cost of Rs 204 crore, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Monday.

 As part of the revamp, the civic body will give the Calcutta Metropolitan Water Supply Authority (CMWSA) Rs 36 crore to set up a 15-million-gallon-capacity plant on the premises of the Garden Reach Waterworks.

 Bibhas Maity, acting chief engineer (water supply), said a water treatment plant will be set up at Dhapa and two booster pumping stations, in Mukundapur and Patuli, for the benefit of people living in Kalikapur, Mukundapur, Madurdaha, Dhapa and Patuli.

 Another treatment plant will come up in Garden Reach, with two booster stations in Daspara and Siriti for the people of Behala, Thakurpukur, Daspara and Siriti.

 People living in the far-flung areas of Garden Reach will also benefit with the commissioning of the plant, with a booster station at Gandhi Maidan by the CMWSA.

 The civic body will invest more than Rs 10.5 crore to lay the supply network.

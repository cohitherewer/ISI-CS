 Hillary Swank and Clint 

 Eastwood in moments from Million Dollar Baby

 As part of its Oscar festival, STAR Movies is beaming Million Dollar Baby from 9 pm on Friday. The film had swept the major Academy Awards in 2005 including Best Director for Clint Eastwood (Frankie) and Best Actress for Hillary Swank (Maggie). This is what the two had to say about the movie.

 MAGGIE

 On the offer: The producers 

 at Lakeshore sent me the script and said, ?We think you?d 

 be great in this.? I read it and I laughed, I cried, I was 

 inspired, I was moved. I thought Paul Haggis did an amazing 

 adaptation. I instantly got the short story and read the 

 short story as well. I said, ?I love this.? I got a call 

 a couple of weeks later saying, ?Guess what, Clint Eastwood 

 is going to star in it and wants to direct it and we?ve 

 got to set up a meeting with you guys.? I almost fell off 

 my chair.

 On Clint Eastwood: I walked 

 in and Clint can leave you speechless and you kind of just 

 sit there and you gawk, you take him in. He?s incredible, 

 but then he also makes you feel really comfortable and at 

 ease. And then we started talking like I?d known him forever. 

 I mean, he?s an icon, he?s a legend, he?s part of our film 

 history in a way. I grew up watching his movies. He?s been 

 making movies longer than I?ve been alive... There will 

 never be another Clint Eastwood. There just won?t. And the 

 great, most amazing thing I think is that I had such high 

 expectations, our expectations I think are really hard to 

 match most of the time, but Clint exceeded my expectations. 

 On the experience: I only 

 had three months to get ready, which I realise in retrospect 

 was barely enough time. I had trainers say to me, ?You?re 

 never going to be able to gain 10 pounds in three months.? 

 And I?d say, ?Well, okay, but you?re not my trainer, because 

 I have to.? Clint ended up introducing me to Grant Roberts, 

 a weight trainer he knew really well, who said, ?Yup, we 

 can do it.? And together we put 19 pounds of muscle on me. 

 So between him, Hector Roca, my boxing trainer, and Oz Garcia, 

 my nutritionist, I got myself ready. It was the most physically 

 challenging thing I?d ever done. 

 FRANKIE

 On the film: It wasn?t 

 hard to make, but it was just hard to get the studio interested. 

 It seems nowadays everyone?s so interested in sequels, remakes, 

 etc, it?s hard to do dramas, character studies or anything. 

 They just don?t get them off the paper. Million Dollar 

 Baby has nothing to do with other films... Fate took 

 it in a tough direction. Here?s this young girl, and life 

 should be great as the dream world goes, but it doesn?t 

 come out that way. He?s the father that died that she loved 

 very much, she?s the daughter that he?s estranged from, 

 and he has the greatest moral dilemma. When I think about 

 it, if somebody told me now, I?d say: ?You?d have to be 

 pretty brave to try to pull that off, because what else 

 could be worse in life??

 On his style: A lot of 

 times, a crew will be used to a person who does maybe 10 

 or 20 (takes), so they set it up and they know we?re going 

 to be here grinding for a while, but I prefer not to. There 

 are certain scenes in this particular picture that are very 

 difficult for me that I just wanted to shoot. I didn?t want 

 to rehearse ?em, I didn?t want to hear lines. I just wanted 

 to say them for the first time. The scene in the church 

 with the priest took one take. Because they?re highly emotional 

 moments, you want to capture them while they?re still highly 

 emotional in your mind. There?s 

 othing technical in ?em. So the ultimate reaction you want from your audience is that every scene sounds like it?s said for the first time. If a person can do that 10 times in a row and make it sound like it?s the first time, that?s terrific. 

 On acting: Back when I 

 first started directing in 1970, I was thinking that eventually 

 someday, I?d look on the screen, and I?d be tired of looking 

 at that guy, so I took to directing. That way, if I got 

 tired of looking, I could just work behind the camera. And 

 that?s happened periodically, but there?s no real earth-shattering 

 reason for it all, other than that I probably will in the 

 coming years do more directing, not acting. I thought it 

 might happen sooner, but it hasn?t. There?s just enough 

 roles for older guys that I could slide in a few, like this 

 last one. This was a wonderful role, but there?s not going 

 to be a lot of roles for guys my age other than cameos or 

 small roles that are repetitive of things I?ve done before, 

 and I don?t want to repeat myself at this stage in life. 

 Maybe when I was younger. You have to change with the times, 

 change with your life. If you?re not constantly developing, 

 then you just stop and slide off the scale.

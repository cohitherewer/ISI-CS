 Millennium Park: A better deal. A Telegraph picture

 To make the parks in the city and on its fringes more attractive, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has decided to go for a public-private partnership (PPP) and has floated fresh tenders for their renovation.

 A meeting between urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and senior CMDA officers shortlisted Satyajit Ray Park at Baishnabghata Patuli, off EM Bypass, and Millennium Park, on Strand Road, for renovation. 

 We are always in favour of such partnerships. This will help the department earn money and strengthen its coffers, said general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee P.B. Nag. 

 According to CMDA officers, both the parks are in a shambles for want of proper maintenance. Spread over two acres, Satyajit Ray Park houses an office of Sandesh, the Bengali magazine published by Ray, and an art gallery with works of Ray and other artists.

 According to the proposed plan, an open-air auditorium and a restaurant will be built. Tenders have been floated. The highest bidder will be given the contract for the upkeep of the art gallery and running the auditorium and eatery. 

 On similar lines, a glass-walled cafeteria will be built at Millennium Park, on the banks of the Hooghly.

 A cup of coffee by the river will be the USP of the park. We want both parks to cater to visitors, a senior CMDA officer said.

 The bidders will also be responsible for collection of gate fees, security and other services in the parks. Plans are afoot to expand Millennium Park, for which the Calcutta Port Trust has provided land.

 We are through with our preliminary discussions. We will expand the park and then float tenders for its proper maintenance, another official said.

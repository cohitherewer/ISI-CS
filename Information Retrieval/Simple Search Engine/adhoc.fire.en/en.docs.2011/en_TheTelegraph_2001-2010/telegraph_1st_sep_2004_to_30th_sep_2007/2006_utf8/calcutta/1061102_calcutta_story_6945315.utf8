 The rare celestial event of Mercurys transit across the disc of the Sun will occur in the night between Wednesday and Thursday. But Calcuttans will miss it, as the sun will rise in the city nine minutes after the transit ends.

 The transit starts at 00.42 am (IST) on November 9 and will take about five hours to complete. The small disc of Mercury, the smallest among the recently-defined classical planets, will touch the solar disc internally at 5.38 am and will exit at 5.40 am.

 The sun will rise in Calcutta on November 9 at 5.49 am.

 The transit is a rare phenomenon, as it occurs on an average only 13 times in 100 years. Calcuttans, unfortunately, will miss it by a few minutes, said Debiprosad Duari, director, research and academic, MP Birla Planetarium.

 In India, the end-phase of the transit will be visible from a few places in the Northeast, like Agartala, Aizawl, Imphal, Itanagar, Jorhat, Kohima and Silchar, and from Port Blair and Nicobar in the Andamans. 

 The full transit can be viewed from east Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Antartica and North America.

 The transit occurs between May 8 and November 10, as Mercurys orbit is inclined by seven degrees to Earths orbit. It intersects Earths orbit at two points or nodes, and if the conditions are proper, the transit occurs, Duari added. The event can be viewed through a projection system or solar filters. A telescope, however, will provide the best viewing.

 The last transit of Mercury across the Sun occurred in 2003. And the next is due on May 9, 2016, but at 8.27 pm. From India, the next viewing opportunity will be on November 13, 2032, when the transit will occur around 2.24 pm.

Preity?s looking for a date

Screen On amp; Off

 Just Chill: Preity Zinta

 From walking the ramp in friend Manish Malhotra?s designs to promoting a T-shirt brand in the United States, Preity Zinta has been chilling out after the hectic twin shooting schedule in New York. She not only shot for Karan Johar?s Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna, but also faced the arclights for Shirish Kunder?s Jaaneman. The two should easily be two of the most eagerly anticipated films of the year.

 Now, thanks to Zee Muzic, the 24-hour music channel from Zee Network, you can be part of Preity?s chilled out schedule. The popular channel has launched a Preity Zinta Fan Club and is inviting viewers and fans of the bubbly Bollywood actress to be a part of the Fan Club. 

 All you need to do is message FANPREITY to 7575 and answer a few simple questions on the Kya Kehna actress. If you get all the questions right, you are eligible to win your dream date with Preity Zinta.

 Speaking on the association, Irshwin Balwani, business head of Zee Muzic, said: ?The decision to launch a Preity Zinta Fan Club was taken on requests from our viewers. We have already received a stupendous response and look forward to announcing the lucky winner shortly.? 

 Back in Favour: Chunkey Pandey

 He believes in his birthdays being sponsored by third parties. So when the new Sahara film channel Filmy decided to celebrate their host Chunkey Pandey?s birthday, the Aankhen star was more than happy. 

 ?On April 29, that is my birthday, big stars will come on my show on Filmy to wish me,? Chunkey told Metro. ?It feels great to be Rokkky on the show, as I consider myself to be the biggest movie buff of all time. My character is a mix of many superstars of the industry.?

 Having returned to the big screen with D, Chunkey will also be seen in Ram Gopal Varma?s Darwaza Bandh Rakho, Sangeeth Sivan?s Apna Sapna Money Money, Ahmed Khan?s Fool And Final and in a special appearance in Farhan Akhtar?s Don. ?I too play a don in the film but not the real one,? he chuckles.

 Pop Choice: Jackie Chan

 His film may be busting The Myth that co-star Mallika Sherawat had created back home but Jackie Chan?s own persona remains larger than life. He ? or rather, his animated avatar ? will now appear in Cartoon Network?s new series Jackie Chan Adventures.

 As seen in the previous series, Chan teams up with his 11-year-old niece Jade, traversing the globe to locate a dozen magical talismans before the sinister Dark Hand does. Helping Jackie and Jade is their uncle, a cantankerous but wise antiquities expert. Though officially Jackie works as an archaeologist, in reality he assists Captain Black, leader of the covert police squad Section 13. 

 On their journeys round the world, Jackie and Jade run into many an adventure which requires the animation hero to fall back on the martial arts that the action star is known for in his movies. The series premieres on April 23 at 10.30 am.

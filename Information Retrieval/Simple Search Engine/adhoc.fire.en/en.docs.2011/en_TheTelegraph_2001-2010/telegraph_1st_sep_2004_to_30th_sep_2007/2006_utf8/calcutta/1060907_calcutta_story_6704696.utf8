Meet the Indian, Hyderabadi

DO INDIANS ABROAD END UP BECOMING GLOBAL 

BECAUSE THEY HAVE FRIENDS FROM THAILAND, AUSTRALIA AND ARGENTINA, WONDERS RUPALI

Online expat forums are useful things, at least for 

me. Whenever we move to a new country these message boards become little windows 

into the new place its customs, local behaviour and all of that kind of stuff 

in the sort of anecdotal detail you wont get from a Lonely Planet 

guide. And because all of this information is filtered through expat experiences, 

it comes with its own kind of prejudice, and that can be quite useful too. 

A recent post on an online Singapore expat message 

board was from an Indian woman about to relocate to Singapore. She asked a number 

of questions that could not reasonably be answered without some amount of legwork 

and phonework (Can I find an apartment easily in X area? Will 

the apartment be within my budget? Is there an Indian school nearby? 

Will it be easy for my daughter to find Indian friends to play with?) 

 and in the general way of most Indians posting on such message boards she hoped 

other forum members would answer in as much detail as possible. 

The ideal, I suppose, would be to actually find an 

apartment for her and a school complete with nice friends for her daughter, and 

save her a load of trouble. 

Just to digress for a moment here, another poster 

on the same online board introduced himself as Indian, Hyderabadi 

a couple of weeks ago and went on to ask: Hi, I am an Indian, Hyderabadi. 

I want to visit Singapore, I have no friends or relatives there. How do I apply 

for Singapore visa on my own? What are the requirements? Waiting for your reply! 

Someone helpfully suggested that Indian, Hyderabadi 

contact the Singapore embassy in India. Obviously not the reply Indian, Hyderabadi 

was waiting for. 

Back to the first woman. Her set of questions ended 

up offending a fellow Indian on the message board. He scolded her for insisting 

on looking for an Indian school and Indian friends for her daughter. He raved 

on about how she was missing the whole global point by insisting on 

an exclusive Indian interaction for her daughter while living in a foreign country, 

and ended his post by saying sternly: I suppose a person like you would 

look for Maharashtrian children for your daughter to play with if you lived in 

Bangalore (the woman had mentioned in her original post that she was a Maharashtrian). 

This man was righteously angry. So starting any sort 

of virtual debate with him would have been futile, but here I come to my question. 

Is there really a whole global point to people living in foreign countries? 

Do long-term residents in a foreign country actually end up becoming global 

citizens merely because they have friends from Thailand, Australia and Argentina? 

And are you still a global citizen when the foreign country youve 

chosen to call home or travel through, prefers to categorise you as an alien 

or foreigner or guest-worker or immigrant? 

Post Script: Waiting for our early morning flight 

back to Singapore from Siem Reaps newly-renovated airport, I went to get 

a coffee from the little airports French bakery. Ahead of me in the fair-sized 

queue was a middle-aged man with his wife. What do you want to eat Lolly? 

she asked him with a perfectly regular Indian English accent. 

Lolly, who could safely trace his roots back to somewhere 

north of the Vindhyas, scrutinised the small menu of brioches and croissants and 

whined in his best American drawl: There are no doughnuts how I can start 

my day without doughnuts, derling? No chai-biskoot for this 

Amrikawalla Lolly puttar. 

After stints in Tokyo and Taipei, the writer is currently

 State to challenge order on vehicle ban

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 The state government has decided to challenge the Calcutta High Court order quashing the ban on pre-1990 vehicles in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) before a division bench of the court.

 The government had banned pre-1990 commercial vehicles in the CMA in a notification dated May 24, 2005. Bengal Bus Syndicate challenged the order before a single-judge bench of the high court, which quashed it in March this year.

 ?We had issued the order after a lot of homework and in consultation with the environment department. The idea was to cut down fume emission by old and polluting vehicles,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said on Sunday.

 Following a green signal from transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, the transport department has written to the legal remembrancer for referring an appeal before the division bench. 

 The department plans to move the appeal soon after the court reopens on June 5.

 ?The basic thrust in the appeal will be whether power can be derived from the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, to debar vehicles on basis of their age,? said a senior transport department official.

 Bengal Bus Syndicate had challenged the notification, saying the government did not have the authority to ban vehicles on the basis of their age. Only the Centre could issue such an order.

 Justice Jayanta Kumar Biswas, while striking down the ban order, had observed that the Central Motor Vehicles Act did not allow vehicles to be debarred on basis of their age.

 ?We had argued that we had derived the power to fix an age limit for vehicles from the Act. Several other states have regulated the age limit for commercial vehicles by amending their Motor Vehicle Rules. We will cite this before the division bench,? said the official.

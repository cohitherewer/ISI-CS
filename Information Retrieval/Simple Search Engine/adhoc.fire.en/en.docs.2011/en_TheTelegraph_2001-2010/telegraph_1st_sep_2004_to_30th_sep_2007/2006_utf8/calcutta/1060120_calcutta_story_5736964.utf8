 It all started a little more than 20 years ago, from a garage in a Jodhpur Park house that served as the bakery and the kitchen. On December 15, 1985, Calcutta got its first Kookie Jar outlet, on Rawdon Street. The store swiftly become a landmark on the citys confectionery platter. Spreading wings slowly in other parts of the city, the pastry shop chain by Lovey Burman is today the most prominent one in its segment.

 The aim now is to take it to the next level. And thats precisely where the Kookie Jar cafe, the plush 1,200 sq ft outlet at The Enclave in Alipore, comes into play.

 People would come to the Rawdon Street store and often ask for exotic coffees. Thats what gave birth to the idea of a full-fledged cafe, says Lovey.

 The latest offering from the Kookie Jar stable has been up and running since April 2005. The concept is of a casual cafe with all-day dining. Our regular takeaway product line of cakes, pastries and savouries of course features in a big way, says the confectionery expert.

 With an extensive menu ? light bites, desserts and exotic coffees ? and an interactive sandwich bar, the cafe is truly one of its kind. The swank interiors of the 18-seater cafe has been done up by pastry shop and restaurant decor specialist Franco Costa of the Costa Group of Italy. Right from the chairs and tables to the glass counters, from the lights to the decoratives, everything has been imported from Italy, reveals Puja Kapur at the store. The colour code is a mix of red, orange and white, with touches of dark wood and steel.

 The sandwich bar allows one to mix and match the ingredients according to taste. One can choose from fillings of Grilled Mushrooms, Grilled Vegetables, Vegetable Stroganoff, Golden Corn and Cheese and Butter Paneer Masala for the Grilled Vegetarian Sandwich. The non-vegetarian counterpart offers choices from Roast Chicken, Butter Chicken Masala, Chicken Stroganoff and Masala Omelette.

 Among the savoury treats, a runaway hit is the Giant Cheese Balls with Hot Garlic Sauce. The other hits on the menu are Chicken Souvlaki Pita with Tahina, Red Relish and Salad; Herbed Crepes with choice of fillings topped with Salsa; Falafal Sandwich with Tahina, Red Relish and Salad, among others. A pasta spread offers Homemade Fettuccine tossed in a choice of sauces.

 The sweet section titled Desserts to Die For lives up to its name. Special ones like Cheese Cake with Blueberry Sauce, Hot Apple Pie with Vanilla Sauce, Death by Chocolate, Hot Chocolate Mud Pie, Zucotta, Chocolate Brownie Mousse and Hot Fudge Brownies are on offer, in addition to the pastry fare.

 Coffee flavours like Cappuccino, Cafe Latte, Cafe Mocha and Espresso, La Maison Hot Chocolate (French-style rich hot chocolate), Viennese Hot Chocolate and thick milk shakes with chocolate, coffee and fruits round up the menu.

 While the little cafe is drawing big footfalls, expansion plans are already firmed up. We have taken up the entire left portion of the ground floor of The Enclave and will expand into a 50-seater cafe in three months, reveals Lovey.

 Expanding on the same concept, the cafe will essentially serve as an all-day dining haunt, with a cocktail and wine bar.

 The menu will be European, but not formal dining or any speciality cuisine. Serving anytime bites in an informal ambience is the idea, explains Lovey.

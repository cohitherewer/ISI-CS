 Once I was playing in Hyderabad when I saw a placard in the crowd which said Sania, will you marry me? And then there was a continuation and me and me and me

 Calcuttas men can queue up for Sania Mirzas hand, starting Tuesday, when she takes the Netaji Indoor Stadium court for her first round match in Sunfeast Open 2006.

 But on Monday, a marriage proposal must have been the last thing on the mind of the 19-year-old glamour girl of Indian tennis.

 For, the morning was spent in class, not on court, and among young, awestruck girls at one school and a teenybopper crowd at another. And the afternoon began at the lunch table with her mother at Eden Pavilion, the coffee shop of ITC Sonar Bangla. Lunch for Sania was pasta, as usual, and on Monday, it was penne with Arrabiata sauce.

 Sania really likes pasta. She is very specific about its preparation and communicates it clearly. She prefers a tomato-based sauce and is not fond of spices, revealed a source at the star hotel busy playing host to the tennis star, known as much for her forehand as for her nose rings.

 The preference for pasta is carried over to dinner, as well, where Sania also goes for garlic bread with less butter.

 But breakfast for the hot property from Hyderabad is always a cereal (either bran flakes or museli) with fruit and milk.

 If Sania ranked 70 is fairly straitjacketed when it comes to meal matters, the other star guest at the hotel Martina Hingis, ranked 9 is far more freewheeling. Martina, who is quite a buffet fan at the Eden Pavilion, also feasted on Teppanyaki at Pan Asian and a hotpot, added the source.

 The Swiss Miss, with five Grand Slam singles crowns, is surely the big name in the Calcutta tourney, but on Monday, at St Thomas Day School in Kidderpore and Heritage School, it was clear who the youth icon was.

 Chants of Saniaaaa, Sania/Saniaaaa, Sania greeted the girl dressed in a black-and-white printed empire-line tunic with black tights, at St Thomas. Sneha Jain summed up the sentiments of the Sania-struck: If I ever want to emulate anybody, it would be Sania Mirza. She is such a good sportsperson and so popular for her looks.

 Overheard: She is so hot, from a group of gaping girls.

 At Heritage School, where the sight of girls and boys huddled together reminded her of her school days, Sania prescribed a perfect balance of sports and academics, and mingled freely with the kids.

 Play over, its time for Sania to get back to work on Tuesday.

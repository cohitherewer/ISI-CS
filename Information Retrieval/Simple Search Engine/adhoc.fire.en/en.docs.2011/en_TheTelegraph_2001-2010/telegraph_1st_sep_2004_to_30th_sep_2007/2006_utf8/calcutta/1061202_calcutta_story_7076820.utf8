 Drama in diversity

 Stylefile 2006

 Anamika Khanna creation 

 The wait is finally over. 

 Tonight, 11 designers from Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai will 

 unveil their latest collections at the Stylefile Winter 

 Show 2006. The open-air fashion gala at the Sunderbans, 

 ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers, has The Telegraph 

 as media partner.

 Calcutta designer Anamika 

 Khanna has created a new line specially for Stylefile. 

 The collection, she says, is dramatic and experimental.

 The shapes are varied from 

 coats to longer dresses and the silhouettes are basically 

 Indian but styled in a Western manner. The collection 

 is over-the-top by my standards, smiles Anamika, known 

 for her understated elegant designs.

 With lots of volume and lots 

 of colour, the pieces, in Anamikas signature style, 

 will boast international elements. The colour story begins 

 from ivory and beige and moves on to black.

 There is a dose of shimmer, 

 too. And gold features in the collection, sometimes as detailing 

 on cuffs and sometimes in a bigger, bolder way, signs 

 off the designer with a studio on Outram Street.

 Black beauty

 An eclectic mix of influences 

 from the world over the Stylefile Winter Show 2006 tonight 

 is about this and much more. 

 For Delhi-based young designer 

 Vivek Narang, who will showcase a winter party line on the 

 ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers ramp, the inspiration 

 comes from central Asia.

 I have drawn inspiration 

 from Suzani, a textile form of central Asia, specifically 

 from Bukhara and Uzbekistan, says Vivek. 

 Cotton thread embroidery on 

 raw silk is the defining look. The look is very simple 

 and minimalist, almost Zen-like. I hope it works for Calcutta, 

 adds Vivek.

 The silhouettes are narrow, 

 straight and fitted, sexy without being body-revealing 

 or vulgar. There are dresses long and flowy cocktail 

 ones, coats and sherwanis. 

 The line is all-black, in 

 keeping with the New Year party hue. 

 Black somehow has become 

 the New Year uniform the world over and hence I decided 

 to do an all-black line for Stylefile. Its a winter 

 line, though there are lots of sleeveless garments, 

 says Vivek.

 The show, the designer promises, 

 will be avant garde.

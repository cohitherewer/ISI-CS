The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Samba the flavour in soccer carnival

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Brazil supporters in Germany, snapped by Parthapratim Datta 

 Parthapratim Dutta was waiting for a bus at the hotel gate when he turned, casually. And there were Alessandro Del Piero and Francesco Totti, chatting. They, too, were waiting to be taken to the Hanover stadium for the Italy vs Ghana tie.

 Dutta did what any soccer-crazy Calcuttan would give so much to achieve ? he walked up to the Italian stars and took their autographs.

 He was one of the lucky seven from India whom Coca-Cola sent to the FIFA World Cup. Not just Italy, Dutta saw the two Calcutta favourites, Brazil and Argentina, in action. At the Olympiastadion in Berlin, watching Brazil beat Croatia, Dutta realised how universal the support for samba stars truly is.

 ?The entire gallery was rooting for them ? Germans, Asians, Africans? everyone, except the Croatians,? said the engineer living in Kalikapur, off the EM Bypass, for whom a single SMS opened the gate to Germany 2006.

 Dutta accounted for one in ?around 450 visas? issued by the German consulate-general in Calcutta to football enthusiasts from this part of the world. ?The visa team expects at least 150 more football fans to head for Germany in the next week solely for the Cup,? was the official word from the consulate.

 The count of 600 is just Cup-specific travel out of Calcutta. To this can be added all those now in Germany on business or holiday. Many of them may have scheduled their trip to coincide with World Cup 2006.

 According to a spokesperson, no less than 1,800 Indians passing through the German consulate-general in Calcutta are likely to be catching the World Cup action in Germany right now.

 ?One football fan is flying to Germany this week with three Cup tickets for three consecutive days in his pocket. He is making an air dash for these three days only and will fly back on the fourth day,? the consulate spokesperson added.

 Cup tourists procure their match tickets beforehand, since they need to show the tickets at the time of applying for visas, along with other necessary papers.

 Emirates, one of the official sponsors of the World Cup, is operating six flights per week from Calcutta and flying to four different German cities. Their Visit World Cup packages include round-trip, stadium tickets and hotel accommodation. So far, around 20 people from here have signed up.

 And if Parthapratim Datta?s experience was anything to go by, money?s worth, and some, is guaranteed. ?It is like Durga puja, a carnival. The World Cup is everywhere? And we say we are passionate about sport!?

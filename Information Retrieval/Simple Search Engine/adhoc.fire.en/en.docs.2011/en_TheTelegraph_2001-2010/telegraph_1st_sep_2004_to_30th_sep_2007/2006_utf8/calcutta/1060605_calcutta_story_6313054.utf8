When you were making Page 3, did you plan 

to make a trilogy or was the idea born out of the success of the film?

No, I always had the trilogy in mind but yes, success 

does supplement ideas. When I was researching for Page 3, I had met a lot 

of corporate people. It was then that their way of life interested me. I had decided 

that I would make a film on boardroom politics and open up this world to everyone. 

That became Corporate. Then later, of course, I thought of Signal, about 

the many lives associated with traffic signals in Mumbai.

What was it about the corporate life that attracted 

you?

When two businessmen got chatting, I would stand there 

and not understand a single word they said. I have never belonged to this corporate 

world, having come from a very middle-class family. So, I found everything about 

them very new, very interesting. Their body language, their lingo? it was absolutely 

different from the kind of people we all get to meet. Also the fact that nobody?s 

made a full-fledged film on the corporate world in India. 

But does the corporate culture provide the backdrop 

or is the story strung together with boardroom politics?

The basic premise is the corporate world but there 

is also an intense relationship between the characters played by Kay Kay Menon 

and Bipasha Basu. There has to be a human angle to the story, otherwise it would 

be difficult for audiences to identify with the characters. The modus operandi 

shown in the film, however, is strictly from the corporate world.

The child molestation in Chandni Bar, the 

paedophile in Page 3... you have gone for shock endings in both your acclaimed 

films. Is that a deliberate ploy to disturb audiences?

Not at all. I have only treated the subjects in the 

way they demanded. What elements go into a film depend entirely on the subject 

I am dealing with. Even in Satta, which wasn?t seen much during its release, 

people said how murky politics can get. All the incidents that I show are mostly 

inspired by newspapers clippings. I just show them.

As with the trilogies of good directors, will there 

be some leitmotif or recurrent image in Page 3, Corporate and Signal?

The subjects may be all different but I am the same 

maker. Of course there will be images that will remind you of another film that 

I made. See, every time I shoot a bar scene, people feel that I am making Chandni 

Bar, every time I shoot a political scene, people feel I am making Satta. 

There is a sequence in Corporate where five people are drinking in a bar. 

Now although the backdrop may be different, the images are bound to be similar 

because I am the same person behind the camera. That?s not conscious. But yes, 

in Signal, which is the third film of the trilogy, there will be references 

to Page 3 and Corporate.

Has Bipasha been able to deliver as a corporate 

honcho?

When I cast Bipasha in Corporate, lots of eyebrows 

were raised. She has never been considered a brilliant actor. She has been associated 

with dancing roles and item songs. But when I do my casting, I do it as per my 

characters. I have given Bipasha a completely different look in Corporate 

and even changed her dialogue pattern. Once people see her as Nishigandha Dasgupta, 

they will forget the Bipasha of Jism and No Entry. She will surely 

get a whole new image and perspective.

For the male lead you have gone for someone non-mainstream 

like Kay Kay...

People did tell me that after Page 3 I could 

have gone for any big actor. But Kay Kay fits the character in my film. Even for 

Signal, when several big stars were in contention, I went for Kunal Khemu 

because he looks like a guy on the streets.

At the end of the day, I am not a commercial film-maker, 

I am an experimental director. I did make Aan but that failed miserably 

and my friends and fans just ripped me apart. So I am not trying that again.

Apart from Kunal, you have gone back to your Page 

3 star Konkona for Signal...

Yes, she was very reluctant to play the role of the 

prostitute in the film but I was very confident. And she has done a fabulous job 

and I am sure this will break her Page 3 image, which was reserved and 

sober. Here she is an extrovert and very chatty.

Finally, do you see Corporate and Signal 

being able to appeal to all like Page 3?

My first target is the multiplex audience but then 

I have kept elements for the masses too. If in Page 3 I got the viewpoints 

of drivers, in Corporate you will get to hear the voices of peons and bodyguards.

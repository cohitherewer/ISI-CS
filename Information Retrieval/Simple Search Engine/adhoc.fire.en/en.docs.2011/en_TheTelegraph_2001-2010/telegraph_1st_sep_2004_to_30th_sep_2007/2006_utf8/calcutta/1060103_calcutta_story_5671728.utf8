The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 War, words and a low profile

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Greer: Very busy

 Germaine Greer has been around the world and back, igniting controversy ? and minds ? wherever she goes. She was in Calcutta on Monday, a stopover sandwiched between Dhaka and Bhubaneswar.

 ?A big piece on the 1971 war in Bangladesh? is keeping the feminist, anarchist, communist, activist, author and campaigner busy these days. Busy enough for her to keep the passing through town under wraps and shun all publicity.

 The 66-year-old Australian told Metro she was ?really very busy? with her latest project.

 ?I was in Dhaka for 10 days, talking to people and collecting information. There are so many people who want to talk, they all have something to say. I have to sort it all out. It?s quite a big piece I?m writing,? Greer said, adding that she was leaving on Tuesday ?for Bhubaneswar?.

 This is the second stint in Bangladesh for the icon, variously described as a ?clever fool?, ?feminist misogynist?, ?brilliant?, ?delightful? and everything in between.

 In the early 1970s, Greer had spent a few years travelling, which included a trip to Bangladesh to find out about the women victims of the conflict with Pakistan.

 The author of the 1970 bestseller The Female Eunuch rarely fails to shock, but as she said on Monday, ?I prefer to speak through my work, for then I know exactly what I have said?.

 Crucible of creativity

 In celebration of its third anniversary, Artists Circle is hosting Southern Alternative, a group exhibition of works by renowned artists of south India. Featuring paintings by Adimoolan, R.B. Bhaskaran, K.S. Rao, K. Muralidharan, Palaniappan, Achutan Kudallur, Gopinath, Surya Prakash, M. Senathipathy (a painting by him appears left) and S. Vasudev, it brings together the creative output of a representative fraction of a region that has contributed enormously in the making of contemporary Indian visual text. What makes the show specially significant is that the works, seen from the perspective of current concerns, practices and expectations, provide a kind of crucible of the art of the moment. They are self-referential, often steeped in a personal vision that is intimate and preoccupied with form, space and myth. At the same time, they affirm the importance of emotional effect more than that of any historically-derived meaning. Their viewing will result not in familiarity but in fresh discoveries.

 Event: Paintings by artists from south India 

When: Till November 10, 2 pm - 7 pm

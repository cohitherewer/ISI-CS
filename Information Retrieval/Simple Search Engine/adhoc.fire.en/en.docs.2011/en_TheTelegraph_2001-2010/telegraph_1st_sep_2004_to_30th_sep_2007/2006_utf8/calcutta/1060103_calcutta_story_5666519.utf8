 Theres something about men in suits? While most youngsters today cringe at the idea of slipping into one, this is one style statement that still makes so many women go weak in their knees.

 Ditto for jacket, the less-rich but equally famous cousin, which in its many forms finds favour with men of all ages the world over.

 Be it a classic cut worn by the Bachchans or the sexy leather one sported by John Abraham in Dhoom, theres no ignoring the appeal of jackets.

 GoodLife presents the hot-me-up factors of jackets as we see them today. 

 Trendy twist

 I have mixed the classic with the funky in my line of jackets this season, says designer Abhishek Dutta. Enter a range of formal jackets that are juxtaposed with quintessentially non-formal elements. Single-breasted jackets take an interesting turn when stitched with a kalamkari lining. Add a hint on the lapels too and you are ready with a smart reversible piece, offers Abhishek.

 Similarly, the typical one-colour leather jacket is now witnessing a sea change, all thanks to Bollywood blockbusters. Remember the time when Salman Khans Maine Pyar Kiya jackets were seen on all and sundry? Well, seems like John has managed to recreate the same rage with his Dhoom jacket.

 According to designer Medhavini Khaitan, the classic length of the jacket has also become a bit shorter. And with that, the vent at the back also becomes optional, since shorter ones dont need two vents anymore, she says.

 Classic cuts 

 Indian classic jackets have a very rich historical past, says fashion designer Sharbari Datta, who loves working around traditional cuts and styles, simultaneously reviving the same. Some pieces like the bandhgala Nehru jacket and the double-breasted Rajasthani tie-up are always popular, she says.

 According to Arshad Amin from Barkat Ali, Jodhpuris or prince jackets are fast catching the fancy of fashionistas. Amongst the classic cuts, the three-button jackets with two vents on the side are hot at the moment, says Arshad. 

 assic styles will always remain so, but Arshad says that things like vents and the number of buttons vary with seasons. Blazers ? with or without patch pockets ? are also going to be huge in 2006, he predicts.

 The jackets might remain basic down the years, but what changes is the way you carry them off. The powder blues and whites of yesteryears have been replaced by stronger hues, adds Arshad. 

 Fabric feel 

 Not everyone can carry off a cool leather jacket like AB Senior did in the Bunty Aur Babli rap and the classic Reid amp; Taylor suit from KBC at the same time. Nonetheless, jackets these days come in a wide variety of fabrics.

 Far from the traditional woollen or warm blends, linens and cotton jackets rule the charts these days. Just right for the neutral Calcutta temperature, fabrics like heavier linens and corduroy work beautifully for our kind of weather.

 Softer fabrics work well these days. Jackets made of these are meant to be semi- structured, but not too stiff, says Medhavini. According to her, heavy, textured polynosics that give a slightly woollen look but are a cotton-mix fabric work very well.

 The favourite for sporty jackets is tweed. For an ethnic style jacket, Sharbari Datta opts for quilted fabrics and pure silks.

 Leather, too, is now viewed as a year-round fabric, thanks to the availability of lighter options and new-age designs, says Imran Zaki of Dolphin Leather. He picks sheep nappa as the best-seller followed by natural dry mill and antique. After sheep nappa, the second most popular ones are goat, followed by calf leather. 

 Detail drama

 Jackets previously used to have a strong minimalist appeal underlining them, but not anymore. True, nothing comes close to beating the magic of a well-cut plain blazer, but in this ornate day and age, jackets too have undergone an image makeover.

 Abhisheks collection of jackets boasts some unusual detailing. There is a distinct influence of street wear in my jackets. Other than regular play of rivets, eyelets and zippers, Abhishek has introduced character in the form of patchwork combined with kantha. 

 Medhavini, on the other hand, prefers the detailing to be more subtle and sober. A hint of a contrast piping peeping out looks very understated and stylish, she says. 

 Sharbari likes to up the drama quotient of her jackets by treating each of her pieces like a canvas. It could be embroidery, zari, appliqu? or Swarovski and the placements could be anywhere ? borders, back, contrasting or asymmetrical.

 Winged menace evade larvicide

 Srikumar Chattopadhyay: Fogging is not good for health, particularly for those with respiratory tract problems. Why are you continuing the practice?

 We have already restricted the use of fogging. If someone is found to be suffering from malaria, then we undertake fogging only around that building. The objective is to kill adult mosquitoes that can act as a potent vector of malaria-causing parasite. Pyretrum, extracted from Chrysanthemum, is used in fogging. 

 Larvicide is effective against mosquitoes before they grow wings. But it is a particular type of winged mosquito that carries the malaria germ. Hence, we still continue to use fogging.

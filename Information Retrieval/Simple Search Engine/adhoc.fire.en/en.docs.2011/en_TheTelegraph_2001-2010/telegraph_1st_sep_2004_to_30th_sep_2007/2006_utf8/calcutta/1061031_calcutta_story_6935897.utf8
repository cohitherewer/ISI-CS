The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pedal pushers for a green dream

 Aamir Khan overcame all hurdles to win the cycling championship 

 in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar. Sean Connery cycled his 

 way through New York in Finding Forrester... But 

 they did not motivate Rahul Saha and Soumik Das, fourth-year 

 law students at National University of Juridical Sciences. 

 Cyclist Lance Armstrongs autobiography inspired the duo 

 to take up cycling as a serious sport. 

 Rahul and Soumik recently cycled their way from Calcutta to Hyderabad in 11 days, finishing a day ahead of schedule. But the boys had more on mind than just sport on their 1,591-km trip, which started on September 15. They named the tour Pedalling Green Dreams and promoted cycling as an eco-friendly mode of transport, as well as a sport. The idea came to us during the recent hue and cry over rising petroleum prices, said Rahul. The expedition was sponsored by PUBLIC (People United for Better Living In Calcutta) and Eastern Institute of Management.

 The two were well-prepared. Besides emergency kits, the young cyclists took along a football in case they needed entertainment. It was great fun but also difficult at times, said Rahul. On Viswakarma puja, one of the cycles broke down about 100 km from Cuttack and the boys had to trek a long distance before they could find a mechanic willing to help. They got caught in a cyclonic storm in Andhra Pradesh and had to keep to the highway all night to maintain the schedule. Just about 500 km from their destination, Soumik fell off the bike while trying to avoid a speeding vehicle from the opposite direction. He suffered minor injuries.

 But all the risks are worth taking for a cause, the duo feels. At least 10 to 15 times every day, passers-by asked about the purpose of our tour. Some even raced with us on the dirt-tracks along the highway. We told them that bicycles are such an efficient mode of transport. The metros need to wake up to this fact, said Soumik.

 I agree cycling is difficult on city roads with no separate lanes for cyclists but it is the only practical way of reducing traffic congestion. People can at least start travelling short distances on bicycles. We are having talks with citizens groups in Bangalore to celebrate a No Car Day. We are also planning shorter trips to places like Santiniketan to spread the word, said Rahul. 

 I used to cycle to school and now I often cycle to college, said Soumik, who stays in Kalyani. The law students went to the firms where they were interns in their formals, but on their cycles. They are also members of the cycling squad of their college. 

 The duo cycled to Uluberia and to Kharagpur during the spring festival this year. The trip to and back from Uluberia took them just four hours.

 Cycling has never been as popular a sport as cricket and football for manifold reasons. The sport is quite expensive. Professional bicycles cost around Rs 3 to 4 lakh, said Rahul. The sport has never been promoted properly, added Soumik.

 A cultural event and a symposium were organised by the Bangla department at Apeejay School on October 28. Students of several schools and their Bengali teachers participated. 

 Dattatreya Dutta, professor at Rabindra Bharati Universitys department of drama, Anindya Sanyal, Bengali short-story writer, and Gauri Dey, Bengali novelist for children attended the event.

 We started the day with a small cultural presentation of Bengali song and dance, followed by a panel discussion on Bhashar Rajnitite ki Bangla Pichhiye? (Is Bengali lagging behind in the politics of language?). 

 The consensus was that like many other regional languages, Bengali was losing its importance. Bengali teachers from Birla High School for Boys and Girls and Park English School spoke about teaching Bengali in English-medium schools.

 THE DIARY 

 She

 Her friends exiled in far-off 

 lands,

 Her truth distorted by alien hands.

 Her power diminished 

 by tyrannous fate, 

 Her smile vanquished 

 by fear and hate.

 Her thirst quenched 

 by only dreamless sleep,

 Her dreams entrapped, 

 for others to keep,

 Her silence visited 

 by earth-shattering screams,

 Her mind overwhelmed 

 by how easy it seemed.

 Her insides possessed 

 by a hellish need,

 Her life denying her freedoms creed.

 She walks and is 

 She lies with me, 

 She. 

 (This poem is dedicated to 

 oppressed women all across the globe)

 Fairy to newborn

 Inside/outside

 Two different worlds;

 Universes two.

 Living one and looking one;

 What laughs in the heart,

 What lives in the mirror;

 Pane and pain 

 Are they the same,

 Or,

 Which shall you choose?

 I believe in faces

 But feel the hearts:

 The mirror cracks.

 Laugh. Evolve. Fly.

 Yet your essence let it remain

 All in a days work: Sorious 

 Samura in the film

 He has found himself in front of the barrel of a gun in Somalia, with knives held to his throat in a prison cell in Liberia, sleeping in the middle of nowhere with smugglers in France All in the course of a days work. 

 Sorious Samura is a journalist with a difference. He lives out the lives of the people he reports on. CNN features the award-winning Samura in a powerful documentary in which he spends a month as an illegal immigrant. He trudges from Morocco through Spain and France, finally across the English Channel to Britain in Living with Illegals which beams this Saturday at 11.30 am with a repeat at 7.30 pm.

 The journey begins in Northern Morocco, where hundreds live in forests waiting to break into Ceuta, a Spanish enclave at the tip of Africa. All that separates them from Ceuta and Europe is an 8 km long, 6 m high fence. For them, Europe is the promised land. As one says: If I have to, Ill wash the toilets, bathrooms or train stations. Forget I am a graduate. 

 Huddled together in cold, flimsy tents and hounded by police, bonding with his subjects was natural. Samura writes in an e-mailed response: Some of the young men I spent Christmas with in the bush, while making the film, were almost family. It is difficult to forget their sufferings and switch to the sweet bits of life.

 Lives do not cost much. Take Gus and Theo who decided to swim around the fence into Europe. The next day, news arrives that only one made it. Samura travels through mainland Spain, where he roughs it out. I have seen people at their worst but in most I also see the good. 

 So while there were those who tried to con him, Samura would rather remember Thommy who helped him raise money. There was also the extraordinary love the Alamnui family of Ethiopia showed as they sacrificed the little food they had for him.

 Through a connection man, Samura crosses the border to Calais, the hub for immigrants trying to enter the UK. The living conditions are as bad as in Morocco. As Arick, a Sudanese immigrant, tells him: Every second, every minute I am trying to get to England. At least in London they treat you like a human being. That night, Samura and Arick break into a lorry heading for the UK. But after an hour they are caught.

 Sometimes, the stories I do feel like peeling layers of my very past its so emotionally draining that you almost want to walk away, Samura confesses.

 Yet after so many heart-wrenching sojourns, he feels he still has a job at hand. In most parts in the West, the truth stands mostly naked but in Africa our politicians and businessmen prefer we cover it all up in corrupt clothing. I have the advantage to keep asking very challenging questions about Africa and very few Africans have that platform. So I know I cant take my foot off the gas just yet. 

 As for the film, both Samura and Arick do reach their final destination. It is an incredible journey, but was all the suffering really worth it? 

 The time seems ripe for the launch of second seasons of popular shows on STAR One. After Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai, the next in line is none other than the hugely popular reality show, Nach Baliye. The second season of the dance-based show will be launched on the channel in mid-September. 

 Although the channel does not want to reveal the names of the shortlisted candidates, the second season will feature new celebrity contestants and maybe new jury members too. As many as 25 couples have been picked and the channel will eventually freeze in on the final 10 soon. 

 The show is taking a hiatus of 10 months before returning on the small screen. Some of the shortlisted candidates include Kiran and Rinku Karmarkar, Gauri and Hiten Tejwani, Neelam and Ronit Roy, Aamna Sharif and Rajeev Khandelwal, Gautami and Ram Kapoor, Shweta and Manav Gohil, Ashutosh Rana and Renuka Shahane. 

 Says Deepak Segal, executive vice-president, content and communications, STAR India: Yes, Nach Baliye will be back on air for a brand new season, beginning September. The show promises to bring back the fun, excitement and nailbiting tension of the previous season with a whole lot of surprises thrown in. In fact, the couples on air will be revealed in the most unique manner by mid-August.

 The Diary

 Stale Water Sonnet

 nThe clock ticks upon the corpse

 the night vibrates

 like a winged ant

 in the mummy?s throat

 Someone calls your name 

 at the wrong time

 It is not the time for someone to call

 A poem orbits in the fog, time betrays

 a thousand-year-old prayer

 you let the wound

 sink into the soul

 The firefly appears

 Inam Hussain Mullick, English, JU

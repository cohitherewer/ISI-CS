 What: Christian Diors celebration of International Womens Day.

 Where: Shoppers Stop, Forum, ground floor. 

 When: March 8.

 The makeover: As part of its Womens Day celebrations, Christian Dior invited 15 of its loyal clients for free makeover sessions. On the agenda was to pamper some walk-in ladies with free makeovers. The event also saw the formal launch of the Dior Spring Look 2006.

 The star product this spring is Dior Gourmette, a make-up bracelet that cleverly houses a lip gloss duo to add that perfect colour and shine, said Amrita Sengupta, regional head, east, Euro Traditions, exclusive distributor of Christian Dior in India. 

 Priced at Rs 2,905, the bracelet was launched along with two five-colour eye-shadow palettes boasting two new colour stories suited for Indian skin tones.

 Fiona Caroline, national trainer for Dior in India, carried out 30-minute makeovers. Along with chalking out a comprehensive make-up routine for participants, Fiona also touched upon various aspects of skin care and fragrance. Make-up is like an accessory, it makes a woman feel more confident and beautiful. It is not a chore that needs to be breezed through for the sake of it, explained Fiona. 

 The two most blaring make-up mistakes that women make, feels Fiona, is the use of compact as a beginners tool and pronounced lip liners. Compact should be used only as a touch-up freshener during the day. Darker lip liner should be merged well with the lipstick towards the centre of the lips, she advises.

 Voiceover: Its our special way of pampering Dior loyalists on this occasion, smiled Amrita.

 Beauty binge

 What: Shoppers Stop, City Centre, celebration of International Womens Day in association with Baccarose Perfumes amp; Beauty Products.

 When: March 8.

 The makeover: In an effort to celebrate the sprit of womanhood, the sprawling store played host to a makeover session on Wednesday. Entries were booked on a first-come-first-served basis.

 The look chosen was Good Vibrations from Clarins, a brand from the house of Baccarose that offers a host of colour cosmetics, face, skin and body care products. Shoppers Stop, City Centre, is the only retailer for Clarins in Calcutta.

 The subtle look focussed on highlighting the eyes. Eye shadows in hues of vibrant violet, groove green, blazing brown and urban grey were used. A royal blue mascara highlighted the lashes. For the lips there were cool shades to go with different skin tones.

 Voiceover: Women today are beauty conscious like never before. In an effort to felicitate the essence of womanhood, there could be nothing better than pampering them with a make-up session, smiled Santanu Ghosh, unit head of Shoppers Stop, City Centre.

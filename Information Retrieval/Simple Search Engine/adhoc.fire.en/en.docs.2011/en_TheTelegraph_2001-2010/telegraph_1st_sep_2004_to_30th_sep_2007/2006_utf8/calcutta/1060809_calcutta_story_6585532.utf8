 Raising the beauty bar

 IN TOWN FOR A DAY, CELEBRITY 

 MAKE-UP ARTIST COLLEEN KIRK TALKS TO SHRADHA AGARWAL ABOUT 

 HER BRUSH WITH FAMOUS FACES

 Madonna

 Starry stint 

 The idea of doing up famous faces 

 sounds super-starry but contrary to all the surrounding 

 hype, it involves a lot of pressure that stems from celeb 

 insecurities someones nose is too big and 

 someones eyes are too small making it oh-so-tough 

 to create the illusion of perfection.

 My first famous assignment was 

 Cher, who I had worked on as an assistant before. Janet 

 Jackson is another fun person to work with and so is Madonna, 

 whose famous Marilyn Monroe lip colour I had created for 

 Material girl. Daryl Hannahs mermaid make-up 

 for Tom Hanks-starrer Splash was another challenge 

 in my 10-year starry stint.

 Wish list

 I would love to work on Catherine 

 Zeta Jones, who is the now version of the classic Audrey 

 Hepburn. I would experiment with a funky look, quite like 

 Chicago tipped eyeliner and heavy lashes but 

 without the bob. Her lips would be pale, frosty pink and 

 her hair very 60s, extremely feminine and flirtatious. 

 Others on my wish list are Goldie 

 Hawn and Susan Sarandon women I look up to, women who 

 I think have rewritten the perception of beauty, post-40.

 Age appeal

 At a time when only youth sells 

 in the form of Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, looking 

 young is essential, but so is age-appropriate make-up. You 

 cant wear the same make-up at 40 what you did at 20. 

 Heres a list of what should be kept in mind for the 

 40-plus.

 Your skin needs to be really looked 

 after. Great skin is what can take off 10 years from your 

 face no kind of make-up ever can.

 Eyes need to be brightened.

 Follow trends but pick up only a few elements. Say shimmer 

 is in and so is purple mascara, I would recommend shimmer 

 for the eyes and instead of purple on the eyes, play up 

 your lips.

 Focus on your positives. If you have well-defined eyebrows 

 or a nice mouth, accentuate them. 

 Miss India

 Colleen Kirk. Picture 

 by Rashbehari Das 

 Aishwarya Rai, from what I have 

 seen from the trailers of Mistress of Spices, is 

 beautiful. She is so multi-cultural, that if you dont 

 announce shes Indian, no one will ever guess! Given 

 a chance, I would love to give her a light-eyes-dark-lips 

 combo that would bring out her natural beauty. 

 Heres a checklist for Indian 

 skin tones.

 They need colour correction to even out the tone. Use 

 a concealer with a yellow or a gold undertone to neutralise 

 the grey near the eye area and mouth. Dust loose powder 

 to set in the base and proceed with the colours. 

 Stay away from muddy hues. They do nothing for your 

 complexion. 

 Use warm and textured shades like bronze, gold and orange.

 New look

 The new look is all about red 

 lips, but not the overpowering, jarring, flat red mouth 

 that makes you go, Oh, youre wearing red! 

 Instead, this fall-winter, the red is wearable, it is softer 

 and textured, maybe lifted with some gold or any other shimmer. 

 Youthful skin, as always, is again going to be a huge statement.

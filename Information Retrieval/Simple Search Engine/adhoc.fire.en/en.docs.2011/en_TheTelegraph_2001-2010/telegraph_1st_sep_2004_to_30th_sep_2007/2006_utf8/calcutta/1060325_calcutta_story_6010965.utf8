 Insider hand in question leak 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hare School was in a tizzy after a question paper leak came to light on Friday. 

 The authorities of the state government-run institution lodged a complaint with the police, saying the mathematics question paper for the annual examination of Class VIII had leaked.

 The school authorities said they had come upon a photocopy of the original question paper. They are yet to announce whether the mathematics examination, that was to be held on March 28, will be rescheduled on not.

 Police see the hand of an insider in the leak. ?It appears that some insiders are behind the leak. We shall talk to the staff as well as the teachers,? said an officer of Jorasanko police station.

 According to the complaint lodged by Harekrishna Bhattacharya, headmaster of Hare School, a leather bag containing the question paper was kept in a locked almirah in the office-room. 

 ?The keys were in another bag kept in the same room,? said the officer.

 The school authorities were surprised when a photocopy of the question paper reached Bhattacharya. ?They discovered that the keys were not in the bag. The almirah in which the question paper was kept was open and the question paper was missing,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma. ?Bhattacharya then came to the police station and recorded the complaint.?

 Police came to know that photocopies of the question paper had already been circulated among some students. ?We are sure this was done for money,? said another officer working on this case.

 Police ruled out involvement of students in the theft. ?They would not have known where it was kept and where to find the keys of the almirah. Either a staff member or somebody attached to the institution is behind it,? said police.

 Cloud over animal tests

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta University (CU) research projects on fields like drug development are suffering. Reason: the 150-year-old institution does not have the proper infrastructure to provide shelter to animals used in experiments.

 The Centre has warned CU that it will not release funds for any research project that requires animals until it adopts a concrete policy on maintaining shelters for them.

 The existing animal shelters of the university lack the facilities mandatory under the guidelines of the animal ethics committee of the Centre. All research and educational institutes are supposed to abide by the norms. 

 Alarmed by the warning, the university, for the first time, convened a meeting last week to thrash out the issue. Heads of the zoology, physiology, biochemistry and biophysics departments, which require live birds and animals for experiments, attended the meet.

 The heads have been asked to draft a policy on how to upgrade CU?s animal shelters. Funds were earmarked at the meeting to set up a modern animal house, which will be jointly used by all the departments.

 ?There is an urgent need to conduct advanced research in bioscience and biotechnology. We have a number of scholars who can do brilliant work in these areas. We are trying our best to upgrade the present system of keeping animals to meet the norms set by the Centre,? said D.J. Chattopadhyay, dean (science), CU.

 At present mice, rats, guinea pigs, toads, birds like pigeon and duck, and various species of fish are used for experiments by various departments of the university.

 As per the central directive, animals and birds cannot be used in large numbers, since that may upset the ecological balance. Instead, the institutions must have the facilities to rear the required species on campus. 

 CU research scholars pointed out that the enclosures in which the animals are kept are very small and unhygienic. There is no system of controlling the temperature, though they should be air-conditioned.

 The committee also insists on the animals not being subjected to torture and that they be made unconscious during experiments. However, such stipulations are seldom adhered to in CU.

 According to the guidelines, the university must ensure that not even a single bird or animal is killed in a cruel manner. Moreover, it is mandatory for the institutions to have a proper system of disposal of dead animals.

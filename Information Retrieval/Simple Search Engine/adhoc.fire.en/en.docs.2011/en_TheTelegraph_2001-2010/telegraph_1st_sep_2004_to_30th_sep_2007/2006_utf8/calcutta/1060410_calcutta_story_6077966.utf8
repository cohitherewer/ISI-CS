 ?The annals of the department furnishes numerous instances of runners having been carried away by tigers, drowned in flooded rivers, bitten by venomous snakes, buried in avalanches or murdered by robbers? In the face of all these dangers the mail runners seldom shrank from performing their duty??

 Laudatory words from L.F. Rushbrook Williams, director of public information, Government of India, in 1922-23, documenting the loss of lives in service. The next time you hear Hemanta Mukherjee sing in praise of the runner, know that poet Sukanta Bhattacharya did not draw from fantasy to romanticise an institution that seems apocryphal in the age of e-mail.

 Such nuggets from the past are what India Post has compiled in its offering to celebrate the sesquicentennial year of its being. The book, Milepost, was released by the chief minister in April 2005 for limited circulation. Now a priced edition has come to the market, with the chief postmaster general unveiling it at a programme at Landmark.

 The book is not the story of the evolution of the Indian postal service though. That, as the preface points out, has been chronicled in Story of the Indian Post Office, edited by Mulk Raj Anand, in 1954, the centenary year. This volume is what it is called ? a ?Milepost on a long journey?, tracing the story of communication from the establishment of the early mail routes in Greece, China, Central Asia and India centuries before Christ.

 ?Did you know our postmen used to deliver people along with mail?? asks Chatterjee. The system was started during the Anglo-Maratha war for the benefit of East India Company officials who were unfamiliar with the routes.

 A person had to apply to the postmaster general and deposit an advance and a portion of the demurrage. The journey included stay at well-manned resting places on the way. ?The charge for a dak palki from Calcutta to Benaras in 1796 was Rs 500,? Chatterjee added.

 City philatelists have played a stellar role in the production of the book. While S.C. Sukhani, possessor of the costliest Indian stamp, the 1854 four annas inverted head, Basudeb Ganguli and Manik Jain allowed articles from their collection to be photographed, Dipak Dey designed the layout.

 ?The job took three-four months,? said the bearded designer about the copiously illustrated book which has drawn from the British Library collection, now archived in the Postal Museum and Philatelic Library, Calcutta.

 One such is a 1910 photograph of the Calcutta General Post Office. Though the present building with its magnificent dome and Corinthian columns came into being in 1868 at a cost of Rs 6.5 lakh, postal service in the city has existed long before with the Old Court House functioning as an exchange post office.

 A philatelic counter operated at the Landmark over the weekend where first day covers and stamps were being sold. The good news is the bookstore will now stock books and commemorative stamps.

 ?We were getting enquiries about accessories like albums. This will benefit youngsters interested in picking up the hobby,? said store CEO Gautam Jatia.

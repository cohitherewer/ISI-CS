The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Slap suit on rogue cop, says court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A day after rapping police for perpetuating ?jungle raj? across the state, Calcutta High Court on Friday asked two litigants to file criminal complaints against two officers for harassing them.

 Justice G.G. Gupta directed Tara Chand Gupta and brother Radheshyam to initiate criminal proceedings against Dulal Chakraborty and A.K. Das, former officer-in-charge (OC) and investigating officer (IO) of Jorabagan police station, who had allegedly picked up the two from home and forced them to sign a cheque for Rs 6.45 lakh. 

 The Guptas have filed a petition, alleging that they were picked up by a team from their Panchanantala house, in south Calcutta, on December 1, 2003, and taken to Jorabagan thana. 

 ?The OC and the IO told us they had received an order from the chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) asking them to probe allegations made against us by Pawan Kumar. The officers said Kumar had complained to the CMM that we had taken Rs 6.45 lakh from him,? the brothers said in their petition.

 Their lawyer Tapas Bhanja told the judge that the officers had ?tortured his clients? to get the cheque signed by them. 

 ?It?s true that Kumar had lodged a criminal case against my clients and that the CMM had directed police to probe the charges. But police, in the name of interrogation, forced my clients to sign the cheque,? Bhanja said.

 He informed the judge that the CMM had quashed the criminal proceedings against his clients.

 Bhanja?s submission, however, was opposed by government lawyer Bikash Bakshi, who told the court that the Guptas had signed the cheque on their own and that there had been no pressure on them from police.

 After hearing out both sides, the court ordered the petitioners to lodge a criminal case against the two officers. ?The petitioner also has the liberty to file a criminal case against Pawan Kumar,? it ruled.

 On Thursday, the same judge had hauled up Burdwan police for not helping a person construct a building on his land. The court had observed that police had failed to protect the man from local toughs, who were not allowing him to build a house as he had refused to pay them money.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diaspora ditches Durga-biz deal

 SUBHRO SAHA

 LUKEWARM RESPONSE: A traditional Durga worshipped in Calcutta. A Telegraph picture

 The citys first structured Puja push has sailed into an entrepreneurial obstacle and could end up going nowhere.

 Happenings, the NGO which kicked off Mahotsav as a pilot project to underline the international tourism potential of the Durga puja festival, has all but thrown in the towel three years into the test-trek, citing a lack of response, both at home and abroad.

 We feel we havent been able to project the festival as a business opportunity to the Bengali diaspora overseas, nor have we managed to galvanise local entrepreneurs. The desired response to Mahotsav never happened and we continue to miss the bus, laments Viji Iyengar, one of the prime movers of Happenings.

 The support group, which had initially set off to peddle the Puja package to outstation and overseas niche tourists as a three-year start-up and then leave the stage for professionals to take over, has decided to give it one last shot, hoping industry would pick up the baton.

 True, we have tried to introduce new elements in the parcel this year, like recreating a typical Bengali zamindari jalsa at the Mullicks Marble Palace on Muktaram Babu Street. Still, theres no escaping the bitter truth that we havent traversed the distance we would have liked to and the response from entrepreneurs has been quite lukewarm, says Nupur Mitra of Happenings.

 Mitra, a touch crestfallen after a recent none-too-fruitful Mahotsav-showcasing tour of the US, feels Happenings has done its job as a facilitator on an experimental scale. Now, its up to the travel and hospitality trade to grow the market and carry it forward. The NGO is stopping at 120 tourists this year, down from 164 last Pujas, to ensure better personal attention.

 The downcast drift isnt echoed by all, though. I feel one has to give this project a lead time of at least five years, and itll happen. We must remember that three years back, there was nothing to show in terms of packaging the Pujas. Now, it is gaining currency through word of mouth, says Ranvir Bhandari, general manager of ITC Sonar Bangla, which is hosting all the Mahotsav tourists this year.

 Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India, stresses the trade is now keen to propel the Puja wrap-sell forward. We are willing to take the lead and spread awareness about the festival elsewhere in the country and abroad through our 2,000-plus members, declares Punjabi.

 Iyengar feels travel operators can tie up with big airlines like British Airways, Jet Airways and Lufthansa, which is scheduled to fly the Calcutta-Frankfurt sector from December. For the past five years, Bengal has been marketed from Bengal. Now its time for others to chip in from the outside, he adds.

 The NGO officials admit two main roadblocks have been the inability to draw the non-resident Bengalis into the frame and enthuse local entrepreneurs. If we cant sell our own festival, the deficiency is ours, and perhaps there are many people making money from the Pujas in a traditional way and dont want to consider an alternative route, smiles Iyengar.

 With Darjeeling as the sole beep on the global tourists radar, mass tourism in Bengal is still a pie in the sky a backdrop which puts the Mahotsav niche-tourism pilot drive in sharper focus, feel the promoters.

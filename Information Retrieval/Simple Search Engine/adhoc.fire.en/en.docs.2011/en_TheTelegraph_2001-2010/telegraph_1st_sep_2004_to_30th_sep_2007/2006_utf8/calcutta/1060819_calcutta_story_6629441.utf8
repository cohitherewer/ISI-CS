 Our lives, their world

 So long, the spotlight has always 

 been firmly on her, whether she was taking the stage or 

 steering the show from backstage. But now Saoli Mitra is 

 keen to pass on the baton. For Poshu Khamar, to premiere 

 on August 22 at Academy of Fine Arts, Saoli has delegated 

 the directorial task to troupe member Arpita Ghosh and settled 

 for a small but significant role in a 36-strong cast.

 I thought I would look after 

 the music and lighting arrangements this time Its time 

 my juniors learnt to do it themselves, smiles Saoli.

 Pancham Vaidik has taken up George 

 Orwells anti-establishment novel Animal Farm for 

 the group feels the content is still very relevant.

 I feel Animal Farm is 

 a pro-democratic novel and it has tremendous parallels with 

 our present-day lives. Everywhere its the politicians who 

 are deciding what we should do Poshu Khamar is not 

 aimed at any particular political set-up in Bengal because 

 the play has a bigger dimension, says Saoli. Adapting 

 a novel into a play was very difficult, but there are no 

 traces of the novel in Poshu Khamar. We have tried 

 to retain Orwells satire which is very subtle.

 Saoli plays Clover, a stout motherly 

 mare, in the play where animals behave like humans and 

 gang up to overthrow their oppressive human masters before 

 succumbing to the same dictatorial flaws themselves.

 Clover is a very important character 

 and its significance increases from the third act onwards, 

 says director Arpita who dramatised the novel and cajoled 

 Saoli into enacting the role.

 Arpita, who had earlier translated 

 Jean-Paul Sartre for Ekti Rajnaitik Hotya, has deviated 

 from Orwell and ended the play on an optimistic note as 

 she felt Animal Farm couldnt only have been a satire.

 Poshu Khamar will not use 

 any animal costumes, instead the human characters will wear 

 masks. The play is being staged on August 22 to mark Sambhu 

 Mitras birth anniversary. Thats our tribute to him, 

 says Saoli.

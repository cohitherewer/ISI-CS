The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Tiger Woods

 You are honest, patient and idealistic. You are a master of the art of persuasion. You are casual about your spending, but punctual about deadlines. You have tremendous empathy and kindness. You like to work in small teams and are made for positions of power. Your jovial nature makes you popular. Kusum Bhandari

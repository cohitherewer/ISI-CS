 She stole Aamir Khans heart away and prompted him to break into Pehla nasha in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander, the romance anthem for a generation.

 Films, theatre and television, Pooja Bedi has dabbled in them all. 

 A not-so-successful filmi career and a series of personal mishaps were not enough to slow the daughter of celebrity couple Kabir Bedi and the late Protima down.

 After a long hiatus, Pooja resurfaced as a television hostess some time back.

 Pooja, the brand ambassador for beauty and skin care chain Kaya Skin Clinic, was in town on Tuesday for the launch of Kaya Age Control Solutions at Grain of Salt, the restaurant at 22, Camac Street.

 GoodLife engaged the glamorous lady in a tete-a-tete on health, fitness and more.

 Feel fit: Pooja is a fitness freak. Fitness is skin deep and very essential for general well being. It should be a perfect balance of healthy emotions, body and skin. You will never look fit if your skin lacks radiance and vice versa. Spiritual well being is an important factor too. So eat well, think well and exercise, smiles the lady with a much-talked-about body she is hardly shy to flaunt. 

 Fitness secrets: The secret lies in the fact that I am so hyperactive and constantly on the move, jokes Pooja.

 On a more serious note, she adds: A walk in the morning and occasional visits to the gym keep me fit. I also believe in artistic yoga for perfect muscle toning.

 For the bindaas Bedi babe, theres something more to fitness than the physicality. Happiness can do wonders, so I laugh a lot!

 Diet chart: Food is the source of energy and less intake of food will only slow you down. I do not restrict myself, I eat whenever I am hungry.

 The ladys a true tea addict. I drink lots of tea but I like it light and not the thick milky variety, she clarifies.

 The recipe for a healthy body, the Bedi way, lies in the right intake of food. Listen to your body. If you are hungry 10 times, eat that many times. But monitor your quantity and do not over eat. Drinking water flushes our body of toxins, but make sure you do not overdo it. Excess of water intake risks loss of essential minerals from the body, points out Pooja.

 Beauty tips: A daily cleansing routine followed by applying ice all over the face is the secret behind her age-defying looks.

 I put drops of rose water along with normal water in the ice tray and refrigerate. It feels extremely soothing when rubbed all over face. It purifies, revitalises and wakes you up. Cucumber works very well for stressed eyes. Putting on a good night cream is essential too, offers Pooja.

 If you are sleeping in an air-conditioned room, keep a bowl of water at your bedside. This prevents moisture loss from the skin, she adds.

 Hot bod: Looking hot in a flowy beige skirt and chocolate brown top, Pooja picks Shilpa Shetty, Sushmita Sen and Priyanka Chopra as the bodies beautiful in Bollywood. 

 Feminine beauty is synonymous with curves. Women walking the ramp with stick-like figures set bad examples for us women, who need some amount of fat during pregnancy, argues Pooja.

 Among the men, Antonio Banderas, George Clooney and John Abraham figure as her favourites.

 Woman of substance: The lady who juggles work and family with ease believes in the importance of time management. The Bedi bottomline: You matter. So take care of yourself and give yourself enough time. If you are fit, everything falls into place.

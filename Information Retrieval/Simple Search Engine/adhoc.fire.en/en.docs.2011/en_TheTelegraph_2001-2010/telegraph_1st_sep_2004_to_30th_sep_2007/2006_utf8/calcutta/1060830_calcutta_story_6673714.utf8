The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Honeymoon, waterworld

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The two most favourite international tourist destinations of Indians are laying out the red carpet for Calcuttans. While Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is focussing on the honeymooners, the Dubai tourism authority wants to prolong the holidays by building an underwater luxury resort and other attractions.

 Singapore Airlines will partner STB to offer a promotional honeymoon package in Calcutta. Couples can avail of the package from October to December, the marriage season in this part of the country, Kenneth Lim, area director, STB told Metro.

 Select tour operators in the city will be asked to sell the package. It will offer something exclusive for honeymooners even at conventional tourist spots, added Lim.

 According to him, picnics will be organised for couples on private beaches, where tourists are not allowed normally. A candlelight dinner on a cable car, offering a panoramic view of Singapore and its harbour will be the special attraction of the package.

 Singapore Airlines is planning to offer special fares to honeymooning couples.

 Besides the underwater resort, a sports city and an eco-tourism centre will be the new draws for tourists in Dubai.

 Most people come to Dubai on three-day-four-night packages. We want to increase the average length of stay of a tourist, said Carl Vaz, director, Dubai Representative Office in India. He is taking part in the two-day International Tourism Summit, organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which started in the city on Tuesday.

 Hydropolis, the underwater resort, will consist of 220 guest suites. It is to thrown open late next year, stated Vaz. Tunnels and boats will connect the resort with the city.

 A sports city with several stadiums and Eco Tourism World, which will showcase the famous forests of the world, are also coming up in Dubai. 

 A large number of low-cost hotels are also being constructed, keeping in mind budget tourists. Currently, there are 391 hotels and hotel resorts in Dubai, most of which are either three or four star addresses. It is important to have low-end hotels to attract budget tourists, observed Vaz.

 Statistics reveal that Dubai is the most favourite international destination for Indians after Singapore. Every year, 360,000 leisure and business tourists visit Dubai from India. Five per cent of them are from the east and Northeast.

 With the introduction of Emirates direct flights between Calcutta and Dubai, the tourism authorities are expecting a significant rise in number of tourists from the city.

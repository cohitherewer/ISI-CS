 Green touch for riverfront

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The green bench of Calcutta High Court has taken a move for beautification of the riverfront of Calcutta and Howrah.

 An expert committee appointed by the court to monitor pollution in the Hooghly has been asked to formulate a scheme to remove closed godowns and factories, khatals and unauthorised business establishments from both banks of the river.

 The court has also directed the committee to file a report at the earliest by interacting with various agencies of the state government and the Centre. Besides, the green bench has made Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), the custodian of the riverfront of the twin cities, a party to the case.

 If the UK can maintain cleanliness of the Thames in London, why cant we keep our riverfront clean? asked Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar, presiding judge of the green bench.

 The court held that beautification of the riverfront should be part of the centrally-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP) in West Bengal.

 While hearing a petition filed by environment activist Subhas Dutta on August 11, the green bench observed that the CPT should be involved in the case, as the organisation was primarily responsible for allowing unauthorised structures on both banks of the Hooghly.

 The CPT has allowed shopkeepers to construct permanent structures on both banks of the river, opposite Howrah station, said petitioner Dutta.

 Moreover, the abandoned godowns owned by the CPT are preventing the state urban development department from beautifying a portion of the riverfront, adjacent to Millennium Park, he added.

 Following Duttas submission, the court directed the CPT to send its representatives when the matter relating to pollution in the Hooghly would come up for hearing.

 Both the Centre and the state governments have ignored our repeated appeals to remove the garbage dumps, old godowns and closed factories from the banks of the Hooghly, said Dutta, also general secretary of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti.

 The indifferent attitude of the state and the Centre had prompted me to mention the matter in the court. Both Howrah and Calcutta are being deprived of advantages that riverside cities across the world enjoy, he alleged.

 Earlier, a few social organisations had sought the green benchs intervention in beautifying the riverfront.

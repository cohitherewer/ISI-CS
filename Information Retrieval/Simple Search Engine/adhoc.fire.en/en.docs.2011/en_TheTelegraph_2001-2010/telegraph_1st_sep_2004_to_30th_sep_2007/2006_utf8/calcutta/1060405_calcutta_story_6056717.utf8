 We Ask You Answer

 Touch not chicken, watch in fear

 Today?s question: Is the drop in chicken consumption more panic than precaution?

 P.N. Pal, 

 Ballygunge

 Excluding chicken from the menu is more a precautionary measure than an act of panic. The rapid spread of avian flu through the world has alarmed almost everyone. The media has also highlighted the dangers of eating chicken. The unconvincing statements by the people in power have not done anything to dispel the fear. Under the circumstances, it would be downright foolish to consume chicken.

 Naren Sen, 

 Howrah

 The drop in chicken consumption is a panic reaction rather than a precautionary measure. The state health department has made it clear that chicken and egg can be consumed after proper cooking without any risk. Besides, infected chickens have not been detected in Bengal yet. Despite this, the people are avoiding chicken partly due to the negative role played by the media.

Suyash Jaiswal,

 Hungerford Street 

 In most households across the city, chicken is cooked properly, but there are many eateries that are lax in the matter of hygiene. Because of this, it is best to avoid consumption of chicken outside home. Foolhardiness might pave the way for an avian flu outbreak that will hit Calcutta hard not only in terms of health, but also economically.

 Samyak Nandy,

 Bangur Avenue

 The drop in chicken consumption is definitely more panic than precaution. Abstinence from chicken is spreading through word of mouth due to lack of awareness. Today, even a beggar without any knowledge of bird flu would refuse to eat chicken. 

 Jyoti Agarwal, 

 Alipore

 It cannot be denied that drop in consumption of chicken is mostly due to panic triggered by the media. But as the adage goes, prevention is better than cure. There is no harm in caution, at least for the time being. 

K.B. Goswami,

 Central Park

 From the moment the news of bird flu in Maharashtra was reported by the media, shock and panic spread to every part of the country. Leave alone consuming chicken, many people are reluctant to even go near chickens. The panic has subsided but a wariness remains. People are still avoiding poultry products. It would take some time for the public to shake off its inhibition.

 Abhishek Law,

 Bidhan Sarani 

 The drop in chicken consumption is more panic than precaution. No human cases have been reported here so far. The government has also asserted that there is no risk in consuming properly cooked chicken, yet people are avoid poultry products like plague. It would, however, be misleading to only accuse the public of being unreasonable. Chicken items had apparently disappeared from the Parliament menu as well.

 Sachindra Nath Mitra

 Beleghata

 The government has failed to prevent avian flu from entering India. Naturally, people have stopped consuming chicken altogether. 

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

 Entally

 The drop in chicken consumption is more panic than precaution. Nevertheless, it has served a useful purpose by minimising the possibility of the spread of bird flu. Most people have a general idea about the problem, but are overestimating the threat posed by the virus. Lack of credible information from the health officials has not helped matters. The government ought to educate the people about the root causes of the disease and ways to avoid it. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Moira Street

 The drop in chicken consumption is more panic that precaution and avoidance of poultry products has hit the industry hard. The government should take steps to reassure the public. They should also provide sops to the poultry-owners so that they can recover from this setback.

 Debalina Das,

 Tollygunge

 To date, not a single human being has been infected in Bengal. The panic has hit the poultry industry hard. Just weeks ago, a poultry-owner committed suicide. Without information about how to control the virus, such tragedies may recur. Surprisingly rather than spreading awareness, the government has wiped the issue off its agenda.

 Santanu Chakrabarty,

 Garia

 It is because people are panicky that they are taking precautions. Though the government is announcing that it is safe to consume properly-cooked chicken, it is doubtful whether eateries are adhering to hygiene norms. Hence, it would be wise to stick to home-made chicken dishes for some more time.

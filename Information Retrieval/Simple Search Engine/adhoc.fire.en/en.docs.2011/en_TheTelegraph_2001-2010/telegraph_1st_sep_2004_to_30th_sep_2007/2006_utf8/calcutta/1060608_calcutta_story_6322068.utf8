 Having kicked off with the bold body paint act by Tania Zaetta last month, the Fashion Police series at Tantra is ready to roll on. This Friday, the second chapter of the fashion series will see a sizzling club wear and swimwear collection by Delhi-based designer Jattinn Kochhar. Leading models like Jesse Randhawa, Angela, Sonalika Sahay, Tina and Amanpreet will parade the clothes on the Tantra bartop.

 The spring-summer 2006 line draws inspiration from tribal hand embroidery in various states of India ? Phulkari from Punjab, Kutch from Gujarat and Jamevar from Kashmir ? that is digitally printed on the fabric. Hindi script prints, Sanskrit shlokas and Maharaja prints of Rajasthan feature on the garments.

 Vibrant Indian tones like ruby red, Indian blue, aubergine, mauve, ash grey, saffron, fuschia, magenta and brown colour the clothes. Swimwear for men and women, evening gowns and cocktail dresses and club shirts for men make up the range.

 The last show I did in Calcutta was 10 years back at The Oberoi Grand. Ive heard a lot has changed in the city in terms of fashion and I am really looking forward to the show, Jattinn tells GoodLife.

 While club wear and swimwear have been Jattinns forte for the past 15 years, the designer will be treading a whole new territory with his Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (spring-summer) collection to be showcased in Delhi in end-August. He will be unveiling a maternity wear line, a rare sight on the Indian ramp. Ill actually do three collections for WLIFW ? maternity wear, mens wear and regular womens wear, he reveals.

 The designer is clearly most excited about the maternity range. I think theres a huge ready market for maternity clothes in India, which is largely untapped, says Jattinn, whose first-hand experience when his wife was pregnant was reason enough to venture into this virgin category.

 This is a time in a womans life when she feels on top of the world and people around also want to pamper her. But in India, theres no way she can look her best because theres absolutely no nice clothes available for pregnant women. Women here cant even lead an active social life during this period since they cant go out in oversized T-shirts and loose pants, explains the versatile designer.

 Jattinn also has his hands full with a couple of uniform designing assignments. Having lent his creativity to create uniforms for airlines, schools, hotels, cafes and nightclubs, he is now busy working on the dresses of the Air Hostess Training Academy and Delhis New Era Public School. I love designing uniforms because it gives me a huge opportunity to interact with different professions, says Jattinn.

 Creating school uniforms is particularly challenging. Uniforms give students a sense of belonging to their schools and hence play a big role. Designing school uniforms is a slow and lengthy process that sometimes takes up to six months. I interact with the students first and get their feedback on the image, design and colour they want. Then I go about designing different looks for summer, winter, sports etc.

 The designer who has played anchor for some popular television shows on fashion in the past, is now dabbling in film costumes. Jattinn has done the entire wardrobe for a crossover film titled Fuzion starring Nandana Sen, Parveen Dabbas, Farooque Sheikh and Kitu Gidwani. Its a family comedy in the same genre as Monsoon Wedding and deals with the way the process of marriage works in India. Its realistic and hilarious at the same time, he reveals. The wardrobe comprises clothes that real people wear in their daily lives.

 While the film from the Chapter One banner is still under production, Jattinn has done his bit and moved on to a more exciting stage. In all likelihood, I will be doing the costumes for a Broadway musical. Its a huge production that will also travel to different countries, he says. The look is period, ethnic Indian and extremely sensual, largely comprising drapes.

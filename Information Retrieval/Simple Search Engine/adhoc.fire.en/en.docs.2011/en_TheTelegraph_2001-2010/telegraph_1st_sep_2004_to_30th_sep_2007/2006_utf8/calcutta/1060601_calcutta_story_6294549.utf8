The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Special team steers repeal 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 What the chief minister had let slip on Monday, his Cabinet made official on Wednesday.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee new Cabinet, in its first meeting, unanimously agreed to repeal The West Bengal Prevention of Property Defacement Act, 1976.

 A three-member committee headed by law minister Rabilal Moitra was set up to suggest measures to repeal the Act referred to as ?draconian? by Bhattacharjee on Tuesday.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra are the other members of the committee that must submit its views to the government in two months.

 The committee will decide whether the Act should be completely abolished or whether some restriction on graffiti should remain.

 The chief minister raised the repeal issue at the meeting. ?Amar mone hoye, dewal lekhar adhikar thaka uchit (I think we should have the right to wall graffiti),? he said. ?In fact, all political parties want wall graffiti and so we should consider repealing the existing Act.?

 He was supported by most of his Cabinet colleagues. ?The logic is that when commercial billboards are allowed, why should political parties be restrained in a democratic set-up,? said a minister after the meeting.

 With the die being cast for the repeal of the Act, the administration is expected to turn a blind eye to the writing on the wall being readied for June 21, when the Left Front celebrates 30 years in power.

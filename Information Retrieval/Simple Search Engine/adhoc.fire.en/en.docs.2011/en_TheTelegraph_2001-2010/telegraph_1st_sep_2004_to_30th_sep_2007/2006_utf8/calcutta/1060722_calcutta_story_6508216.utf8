 Craters raise repair cry

 - Quick fix will last only till next shower, warn engineers

 KINSUK BASU

 If the rains don?t get you, the roads surely will. The Wednesday watershed may not happen again in a hurry, but the scars it has left on city streets will take some time to heal.

 With prime stretches resembling the moon?s surface, babus have pushed the panic button and called for immediate repairs, but engineers on the ground have warned that the present patchwork will last only till the next downpour.

 Target zone one is the city?s showpiece, Sector V. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Friday admitted that one heavy shower had messed up the tech township, and spelt out a three-point plan for crisis management ? clear outflow channels, keep more pumps ready, repair potholes at once.

 ?A Rs 2.4-crore project has been sanctioned to repair the roads of Sector V. The work had just started when the rains came down. The repair work will now be all about filling up potholes,? said a senior engineer the CMDA.

 Next on the priority list is the vital Park Circus connector. The traffic police have asked the CMDA?s traffic and transportation department to repair the 2.6-km stretch from Parama Island to the approach of No. 4 bridge on a war footing.

 ?This stretch has not witnessed maintenance for the past three years and to make matters worse, the gully pits are all clogged. In an emergency, we have decided to repair the stretch with bricks and a layer of bitumen. But this is not the way this road is supposed to be repaired,? said Debdas Bhattacharya, chief engineer of the CMDA.

 The CMDA has already drawn up a Rs 3.4-crore project for this stretch, where the craters have reduced traffic to a crawl. This includes de-silting of drains, repair of sewer lines and concretising two lanes each at two intersections near Gobinda Khatik Road and Kohinoor Market.

 With potholed roads turning traffic management into mission impossible, Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic), has urged all agencies to rush road repairs.

 ?Several stretches, including parts of Kidderpore, are in a mess and yet no one seems ready to take responsibility,? alleged Shamim.

 HRBC contractors working on tram-track concretisation on Lenin Sarani have also been asked to speed up work.

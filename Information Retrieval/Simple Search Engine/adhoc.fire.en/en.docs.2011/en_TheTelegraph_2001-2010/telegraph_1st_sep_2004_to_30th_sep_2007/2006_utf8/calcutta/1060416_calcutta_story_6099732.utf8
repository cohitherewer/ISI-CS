 Look young

 Sipping beer on a cruise and looking 

 out on the blue sheet of water through the glass fa?ade 

 ? in the heart of Calcutta?s central business district.

 That?s the look-and-feel created 

 at the new renovated pub next to the Calcutta Swimming Club 

 (CSC) outdoor pool.

 ?To complement the Main Bar, a 

 watering hole favoured more by the middle-aged and senior 

 members, we have totally refurbished the pub to give it 

 a hip, aqua feel,? says club president Ravi Todi.

 Designed by young architect-designer 

 Pooja Khanna, the pub overlooking the outdoor pool has been 

 reorganised as a lounge bar ?with a submarine feel?, seating 

 52 people and equipped to hold a party crowd of up to 100. 

 The dance floor too has been expanded and a new, hi-fi sound 

 system installed.

 ?The brief from the management 

 was to do a lively and young place and I thought of designing 

 the lounge bar as a cruise on the swimming pool. Hence the 

 wave pattern on the flooring, concentric rings on the ceiling 

 to depict ripples, pebbles and blue tiles to accentuate 

 the underwater feel,? explains Pooja.

 Large mirrors are placed at strategic 

 positions to play with reflections, while the predominant 

 colours everywhere are turquoise and aqua blue. A couple 

 of steel-and-glass meshes have been created with maple leaves 

 behind, near the front and next to the dance floor, to depict 

 the seabed, while the glass of the standing counter has 

 been designed like stalactites and stalagmites.

 The hydraulic chairs, circular-glass 

 windows and the bottle-castles at the bar counter, the aqua 

 blue toilet with a rope design resembling a ship?s anchor, 

 are all elements that add to the underwater ambience.

 ?More than 40 per cent of our 

 members are below 35 years and our efforts recently have 

 been directed towards making the club a more youth-friendly 

 institution. The redesigned lounge bar is such an initiative,? 

 says Todi, adding that the place can now serve as a perfect 

 party pad.

 Imported timed disco lights, a 

 new sound system, a plasma TV and liberal use of steel and 

 glass also contribute to the contemporary look and feel.

 ?To add to the Tandoori platter 

 from Amber, we have introduced Just Desserts cuisine, while 

 talks with Rikki Dewan of Don Giovanni are also on,? the 

 club president declares.

 The CSC management is also renovating 

 the eight guestrooms, again redesigned by Pooja. ?We will 

 offer four-star facilities at two-star prices and are trying 

 to work out a bed-and-breakfast concept,? reveals Todi.

 A resolution has been passed on 

 minimum billing for members, as well as increasing the monthly 

 subscription.

 On the waterfront, while the management 

 has thrown open the annual swim-a-mile competition (April 

 23) to other clubs this year, plans are also afoot to start 

 a Merchants? Cup swimming competition ?for the first time 

 in the city?.

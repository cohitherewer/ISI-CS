 Dreams grew wings for 20 creative 

 talent from the field of fashion design, photography, textile 

 design and art on Friday evening at the Nirmaan awards instituted 

 by the BD Bangur Endowment. They secured loans and grants, 

 shared the limelight with art and fashion stalwarts and 

 picked up valuable tips on career moves, while family and 

 friends cheered them on.

 Manjushree Bangur, trustee, BD 

 Bangur Endowment, said: Project Nirmaan aims to identify 

 the best of talent across the country and help them to be 

 successful entrepreneurs by offering them the right medley 

 of opportunity, exposure, finance and training.

 Started three years ago, the awards 

 are already up and running. When we started we would 

 chase people and institutes to get them or their candidates 

 to apply. Today, applications just flow in. In future we 

 would like to have more applications from outside the city, 

 added Manjushree.

 This time, more than 1,000 entries 

 came in from Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, 

 Bhopal, Kota, Vadodara and more. The jury comprising industry 

 biggies like artist Anjolie Ela Menon, photographer Avinash 

 Pasricha, fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh and textile 

 designer Rahul Jain shortlisted the 20 finalists on the 

 basis of work samples, technical parameters, interviews, 

 focus quotient, project planning in future...

 Five candidates were chosen from 

 each field. While the winner walked away with a trophy and 

 a grant of Rs 1 lakh, the other four were awarded zero-interest 

 loans for the same amount. We have also tied up with 

 leading fashion stores and galleries to promote the winners, 

 revealed Manjushree.

 On Friday, the evening at Crystal 

 Room, Taj Bengal, kicked off with a discussion involving 

 Anjolie, Avinash, Pratap and Rahul, moderated by Aveek Sen 

 of The Telegraph. What kind of education and exposure 

 is important for young creators? The eye and the hand 

 are tools that can be trained, but then there is also the 

 mind that will instrument how one uses the tools, 

 said Anjolie.

 While Avinash stressed the importance 

 of inspiration, creativity, challenges and learning 

 with practice, Rahul was concerned about strong 

 regional sensibilities and the need to broaden horizons.

 Young creators and their relationship 

 with the market was another talking point. If you 

 have the perfect design scheme, creativity commercial aspects 

 will follow, felt Pratap. The discussion ended with 

 an interesting chit-chat on the influence of media.

 Finally, the awards ceremony. 

 In the photography category, Aniruddha Pal was the winner 

 while Nilanjan Ray, Swapan Nayak, Arindam Mukherjee and 

 Kirti Dinanath Lokhande walked away with the loan amounts. 

 In the fashion category, Rita 

 Shome bagged the top honours, followed by Amrit Raj Maity, 

 Ateev Anand, Vandana Jadwani and Gargi Mazumdar. Arunava 

 Mandal was the winner in the textile category, with Sourav 

 Saha, Chandan Panda, Shrabani Biswas and Vivek Kumar sharing 

 the other honours. Sangeeta Pathak from Bhopal won in the 

 art category, beating Subha Basu, Mahmud Husain Laskar, 

 Jayanta Naskar and Alakananda Sengupta.

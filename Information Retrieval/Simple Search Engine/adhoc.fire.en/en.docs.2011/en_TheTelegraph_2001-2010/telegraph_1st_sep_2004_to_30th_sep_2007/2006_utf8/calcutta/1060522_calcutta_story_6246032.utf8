 What: Launch of Colours of Royalty, a range of studded jewellery.

 Where: Tanishq showroom on Camac Street.

 When: Friday.

 The collection: Was unveiled by actress Indrani Halder. The assortment comprises neckpieces, earrings, finger rings, pendant sets and bangles. Set in rubies, emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, the motifs and designs of the studded ornaments have plenty of fine detailing.

 The designs look towards the past and draw inspiration from the Victorian era ? art, architecture, fashion and more.

 Yet they are highly wearable and are an ode to the modern Indian woman. This is the largest collection of diamonds that has ever been launched by Tanishq. The bangles have 3-D detailing to give an appearance of enhanced volume.

 Pocket pinch: Between Rs 6,500 and Rs 15 lakh.

 Voiceover: Besides being of high aesthetic value, the jewellery is affordable and also a good investment option. Instead of gold, buyers choices are leaning towards diamonds these days. The old-world charm of the Victorian period has been brought to life through these creations that give an impression of grandeur, said Debashish Mishra, designer of Tanishq Design Studio.

 Tea-off

 What: Launch of a new Tea Room menu.

 Where: Flurys on Park Street. 

 When: Saturday afternoon. 

 The spread: Some Flurys classics and some brand new additions ? the new menu at this popular tea room boasts all this and more. So, we have Italian Ciabatta with Tomato, Ham and Mozzarella giving company to Chicken Mustard Sandwich, and Cinnamon Rolls mingling with the Danish Pastries.

 so check out the all-new pasta section from the Lunch and Dinner Menu that lets you choose from Penne, Tagliatelle, Spaghetti or Fusilli served with Pesto Sauce, Tomato Basil Sauce, Arrabiata, Creamy Smoked Chicken or Bolognaise.

 Unlike the old menu, this time there are no Tea Specials and Elegant Yet Filling sections. Foodies can order any dish of their choice any time of the day. 

 For todays travelling client who is forever jetlagged, how can there be a time specification? Moreover, we follow a policy of never say no to guests, smiled Thierry Thonnate, executive chef at Flurys. Also, the old Beverages section is now split into Coffee, Tea and Beverages.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 18. 

 Voiceover: The new menu is a result of tremendous brainstorming with the entire team. The final list was drawn up after endless trials, costings and innovations, reveals Thierry.

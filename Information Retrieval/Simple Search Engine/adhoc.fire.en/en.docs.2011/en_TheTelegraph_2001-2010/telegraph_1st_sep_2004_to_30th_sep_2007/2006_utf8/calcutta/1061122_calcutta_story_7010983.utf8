 SEBANTI SARKAR

 A work by Beena Pradhan

 Robust and vibrant, with bold lines and sweeping colours, yet in all of it, a surprising sensitivity. A range of sounds, a boisterous band, symphonies surging out of gramophones, the soft clink of a bunch of keys suspended from a saris pallu and then the inaudible sounds that touch your inner self. 

 These are memories one carries back from Beena Pradhans latest cache of acrylics, to be on display at the Academy of Fine Arts between November 24-30.

 A self-taught painter who dabbled in watercolour, pastel, oil and mixed media since high school took up painting in earnest since she made Calcutta her home in 1990. There is a feel about this place, which convinced me that this the ideal place for an artist, smiles Beena. 

 With 13 solos behind her, she doesnt recall exactly how she developed or which artists inspired her most. Her works reminds one of Bikash Bhattacharjee or Sunil Das. But there is an undeniable individuality in her expression.

 I love colours. I like to splash them around, work them up I use big brushes and I work fast, says Beena, gazing at the large canvas glowing with patches of colour like cadmium red, viridian green, cobalt blue, white and chrome yellow, played against each other or merged smoothly. 

 Her characters are divided into two groups listeners and non-listeners. One notices that most of the non-listeners are male. In the canvas titled Reverberations the Ocean Invoked, a woman listens all agog with the sound of the sea but the male figure sleeps unmoved. 

 I always draw women in the centre and men in the periphery or background because I feel women are stronger, deeper. Men I depict as band musicians, explains Pradhan. 

 The eyes are strong points of interaction in her paintings. Large, liquid pools of colour or a dot in a suggestive haze, they are almost over-expressive at times.

 What: 

 The Romance of Indian Textiles, an interactive session organised 

 by Ladies Study Group (LSG).

 Where: The Pala, ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: Tuesday afternoon, 3.30 pm.

 The speakers: Meera Kumar, currently researching Indias textiles and also co-author of Dance of the Peacock, a book on Indian jewellery; textile expert Umang Hutheesing, member of Fashion Design Council of India, striving to spread awareness on Indian art and culture; fashion designer Kavita Bhartia representing the growing fashion industry of India.

 The event: Meera began the journey of Indian textiles with a brief glimpse into history, circa 2 AD, a time when India was most advanced in cotton weaving and dyeing techniques. Her tools ? slides of sculptures, paintings and literature ? backed her beautifully as she progressed on the visual journey.

 Buddha sculptures, Benaras gharana and Mughal influences featured most prominently in her presentation. The advent of gold in textiles, in the form of various forms of embroidery, was specially traced.

 Umang focused on textile heritage and traditions of Gujarat as he elaborated on cotton and indigo plantations, right from the Indus Valley civilisation. He carried his audience back to the time when Mahatmas khadi became the warp and weft of Indian Independence. Patola, gharchola, brocade, badla, bandhani, mashru, khadi? Umang touched upon all this before rounding it off with an international trade angle. Also on display were some rare textiles from Umangs collection. 

 Spotted: Preeti Goenka, Madhu Neotia, Sharbari Datta, Darshan Shah, Rita Bhimani, Ruby Pal Chowdhuri, Sucheta Merh and many other distinguished ladies.

 Voiceover: It is amazing how the eminent speakers have capsuled such a vast subject for our members and guests, smiled Bharti Deveshwar, president of LSG.

 Debut do

 What: Debut of all-girl band Fame.

 Where: Someplace Else.

 When: Saturday, July 15.

 Tune in: The Park Street pub was fuller than usual from 10 pm. The four ladies ? Rila, Arunima, Anita and Tanya ? took the stage around 10.30 pm, kick-starting the show with a cover of Bananaramas Venus. 

 They then took turns with songs like Whats Love Got To Do With It, Chain of Fools, Move Over, Highway To Hell, Are You Gonna Go My Way and Fame, the track that had brought everything together and given the girl gang its name.

 Rila also sang an original composition called Fragile Intentions. The fun finally came to an end a little after midnight with the crowd craving for more. The last song of the night: Shania Twains Man I Feel Like A Woman!

 Voiceover: It was an amazing experience. We had a blast and everyone, including the musicians, was happy. The crowd just kept swelling and some of them said later that it was the best gig they had attended. We are approaching some of the clubs to take things forward from here, said Arunima.

 High hub 

 What: Launch of lounge bar Little High.

 Where: Eighth floor of Fort Knox, 6 Camac Street.

 When: Sunday, July 16.

 Take a look: After the success of the all-vegetarian eatery Little Italy, a brand new lounge bar adjacent to it is all set to get you high with a lounging experience. The 1,100 sq ft lounge bar opened its doors on Sunday. While drinks and finger food flowed freely at the launch party, the mood was set by DJ Tanveer churning out tracks like Im Alive, Sexy Lady, Woh lamhe, Fanaa and more. 

 Little High is not an extension of Little Italy. It is rather an effort on our part to come up with a new concept; the concept of a lounge bar in its truest sense, devoid of nightclub elements, claims Little High proprietor Amit Kajaria. 

 The ambience is warm and comfortable, suitable for a few drinks, some chit-chat and great music.

 Psychedelic lights have been strictly avoided; dim and soft lighting adds to the warmth. The colour story revolves around soft pastels and dark coffee brown, complementing the wooden flooring. Cosy sofas and low-seaters have been placed strategically to create a feeling of ample space. Water elements add a soothing touch.

 To pep up the sober surroundings, the bar with its red backdrop has crystal embellishments set against mirrors.

 Console call: DJs Tanveer and Jay will be in charge of the console. providing a different musical experience every day. On Mondays the music flavour will be lounge, while Tuesdays will be devoted to R amp;B. Hip-hop and commercial will rule on Wednesdays and Thursdays, while Fridays are for house music. Saturdays will feature freestyle, while one can rewind on Sundays with music from the 70s and 80s. 

 On a platter: Whisky, gin, brandy, cognac, beer?the bar counter serves a good variety. Also on offer is an array of cocktails and mocktails.

 The food menu comprises Italian 

 and Mexican. We will shortly come up with Lebanese 

 delicacies too, adds Amit. The lounge will be open 

 every evening, from 7 pm.

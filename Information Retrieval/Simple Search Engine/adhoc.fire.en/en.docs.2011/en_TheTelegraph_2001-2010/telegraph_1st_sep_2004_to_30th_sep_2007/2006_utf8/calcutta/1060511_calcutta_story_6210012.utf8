The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A yolk goddess? Eggjactly

 Eggstatic: Udita 

 Goswami

 Imagine being drowned in egg yolk 

 ? and surfacing with a smile. Well, that?s exactly what 

 Bollywood hot bod Udita Goswami did recently. Gone are the 

 days of being body-painted or even soaked in chocolate, 

 the Paap girl went a few steps further and got her 

 face drenched in egg yellow.

 And it wasn?t even for a big Bollywood blockbuster, but just on a request from a friend for a ?fun shoot?. To hold off the dreaded stench, Udita had baby oil splattered over her face but the eggs did leave an indelible mark all right. Days after the photo shoot, she felt she could smell the eggs all over her!

 The Dehra Dun girl may not be eggstatic about discussing the episode, but in a candid interview to Channel [V] VJ Sarah Jane, Udita does talk about her journey from the world of modelling to tinsel town. Catch Udita speak on Maybelline New York [V] Goddess Festival on Thursday, 7 pm on Channel [V].

 You can also catch Udita doing 

 an item number for the first time in director Aditya Datt?s 

 (Aashiq Banaya Apne) second film Dil Diya Hai. 

 And if you are wondering how the music would be, well, it 

 is scored by Himesh Reshammiya and the film stars Emraan 

 Hashmi!

 Karunya call

 On song: Rajkumar Hirani, 

 Shantanu Moitra, N. Karunya, Vinod Chopra

 He?s got luckier than his predecessors. 

 The likes of Abhijeet Sawant, Qazi Tauqeer and Ruprekha 

 Banerjee may still be looking for the big Bollywood song 

 but this year?s Indian Idol runner-up N. Karunya 

 has already landed a huge break. The Hyderabadi voice has 

 been chosen to sing for the sequel to Munnabhai MBBS, 

 Munnabhai 2nd Innings.

 Highly impressed with his vocal skills, the film?s producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra got Karunya to record a track Aane char aane for the Rajkumar Hirani film starring Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, Vidya Balan and Boman Irani. With lyrics by Swanand Kirkire and music by Shantanu Moitra, Aane char aane was recorded by Karunya at Mumbai?s Media Mind Studio. 

 And there were no butterflies in the stomach with Karunya finishing the song in 15 minutes flat. Vinod had first heard about Karunya when sister Shelly burst into his Los Angeles hotel room in tears, because ?the Abhishek Bachchan lookalike? had not become the Indian Idol. Earlier Vinod had given a break to another reality hunt singer ? Sa Re Ga Ma Pa?s Sanjeevani in Kareeb.

 Munnabhai 2nd Innings releases 

 on August 25 and the Shantanu Moitra soundtrack a couple 

 of weeks before that.

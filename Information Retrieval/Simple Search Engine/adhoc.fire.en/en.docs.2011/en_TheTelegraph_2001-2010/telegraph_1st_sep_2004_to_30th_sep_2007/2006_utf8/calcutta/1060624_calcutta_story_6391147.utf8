 As part of its ongoing initiative to promote the cultural heritage of Calcutta, Hutch presents Hutch Odeon 2006, its sixth staging of a festival of quality plays. Marking its beginning is C for Clown, a play created completely out of improvisations on the rehearsal floor. Six clowns enact a day in the life of members of a circus or theatre troupe. As they go through the motions of their daily routine, they encounter a series of human emotions, love and death. The performers? act, including mime, pantomime, acrobatics and dance, along with a bit of spoken language, is a tribute to comedy in the silent era of cinema, and also to all fools, clowns and jesters who have entertained audiences over the ages. In the production, lighting, set, properties, make-up and costume-design go hand-in-hand with the devices of theatrical expression. A complete theatrical creation based on an actor?s experience on and off stage, it represents the first effort of its kind in Indian theatre. Direction: Rajat Kapoor.

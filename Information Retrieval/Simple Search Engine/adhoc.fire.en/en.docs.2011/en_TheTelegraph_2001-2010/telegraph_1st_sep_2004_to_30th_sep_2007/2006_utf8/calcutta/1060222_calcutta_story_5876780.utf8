 Cooking up careers

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Be it banking or baking, theres no substitute for textbook knowledge and hands-on experience. With leading food chain Mainland China launching a first-of-its-kind catering institute in the city, those aspiring to build a career in the hospitality industry can gain both theoretical and practical expertise.

 This is not just another hotel management institute. Mainland Institute of Oriental Catering (MIOC), backed by Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, will impart specialised training in Oriental cuisine. 

 Scheduled to be up within a year, the institute will be built over 25 cottahs in DD Block, Salt Lake Sector I.

 The only specialised Oriental training institute in the country, MIOC will provide degree and diploma courses in Oriental cuisine and culture, state-of-the-art technology and management expertise on the campus behind Gorkha Bhavan.

 The foundation stone of MIOC was unveiled on Tuesday afternoon by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, in the presence of veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee, chairman of Bidhannagar municipality Biswajiban Majumdar, artist Shuvaprasanna, theatre personality Rudraprasad Sengupta, ex-cricketer Sambaran Banerjee and, of course, Anjan Chatterjee, chairman and managing director of Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd.

 The hospitality and entertainment segment is an integral part of the service sector. As more and more hotels come up, we need more skilled individuals to join the catering and hotel industry. The government congratulates the efforts for such an initiative, said the chief minister.

 Soumitra Chatterjee, too, praised the venture: Be it the industry, tourism or hospitality sector, when a state develops there is need for growth in all spheres. The setting up of such an institute is proof enough of a healthy environment in West Bengal.

 The curriculum will provide knowledge and training in Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Thai and Indian cuisines, revealed Anjan.

 The catering industry has undergone a sea change in the past 10 to 12 years and a career in this field is socially more acceptable. Today, Bengal provides around 40 per cent of the manpower to five stars, four stars and fine-dining restaurants. The courses we offer will throw up greater opportunities for personnel trained in this sphere, he stressed.

 The institute will focus on providing knowledge of international standards of hospitality, create professionally trained manpower and avenues of employment, both national and international. MIOC also aims to generate a pool of entrepreneurs who will in turn create more employment opportunities.

 The institute will start with around 24 faculty members, including skilled professionals in the areas concerned. The student capacity will be around 3,000 per year. Talks are on with leading institutes for affiliation. 

 MIOC will provide a three-tier system of education. Tier One will offer six-month intensive training in specific areas of catering. Tier Two courses of 18 months duration will offer training in more than one area of catering. This will generate professionals for the mid-level units in the hospitality industry.

 Tier Three course of over three years will cover all critical aspects of catering. There will be a special course with emphasis on Bengali cuisine, added Anjan. Extensive courses for existing players in the industry are also being planned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Chocolates amp; chillies

 Shaun Kenworthy

 I thought Id have a 

 change from the norm this week and talk about cheese and 

 wine. Not such a big step away from dessert really. In Europe 

 when we think about finishing a delicious meal, 50 per cent 

 of the time people would opt for a plate of cheese rather 

 than a plate of pudding. Theres a whole world of cheese 

 to be explored and a wide variety of cheeses from all corners 

 of the globe.

 Sadly, the word cheese in 

 India generally describes something processed that either 

 comes out of a can, as a nicely-packaged slice or in spreadable 

 form. But in reality, India has an age-old tradition of 

 making cheese. Most, if not all, of the ones I have eaten 

 have been hard and semi-hard cheese, coming from the mountain 

 and hill regions of India. They have been similar to those 

 found in Austria and Switzerland (Gouda, Edam, Gruyere, 

 etc).

 Even close by, Darjeeling, 

 Kalimpong, etc produce some fantastic cheese but sadly you 

 will find none of them in Calcutta. (If Im out of 

 place saying that, Id love to know otherwise). Ive 

 asked suppliers many times in the past if they could source 

 a regular supply of local cheeses but to no avail. I managed 

 to put a platter of Indian cheeses together for a menu in 

 Delhi but havent been able to do the same elsewhere 

 in India.

 Most of the time, all you 

 find from the suppliers are imported castaways from Europe 

 (with the odd exception, of course) and ridiculous things 

 like Danish Feta and Camembert! The Feta comes in a tetra 

 pack and worse, the Camembert comes packaged in a ring-pull 

 can! But because it says Camembert on the packaging, it 

 will do.

 This isnt cheese to 

 me. Real cheese is something that is unpasteurised and doesnt 

 come out of plastic packaging or a can. Call me a snob here, 

 but cheese is one of those things where compromise is something 

 I just cant understand. I was a member of the cheese 

 society of Great Britain for many years where we used to 

 taste cheeses from all over Europe, so try to understand 

 where Im coming from here. Some of these small artisans 

 will only produce a few hundred cheeses a year so its 

 nothing to do with the money, its all about passion 

 and tradition.

 Magic Marriage: Wine amp; 

 Cheese

 I wanted to talk a bit about 

 cheese and wine basics. A marriage made in heaven if you 

 asked most French about the subject and something that could 

 put a happy mushy smile on their faces. Successful wine 

 and cheese matching is based mostly on similarities rather 

 than contrasts. Take some fresh, delicate cheeses like Mozzarella, 

 Ricotta, Feta and Chevre with milky, tangy flavours. Dont 

 hit them over the head with a big fat hairy Shiraz. If you 

 want to enhance them, choose a light-bodied white wine. 

 Sauvignon Blanc, Reisling and young sparkling wines would 

 be perfect its up to your personal choice.

 Instead of a recipe this week, 

 heres a guideline to some tried-and-tested cheese 

 and wine matches. 

 Cheeses like Ricotta, Feta, 

 Mozzarella, Bocconcini and Chevre are fresh, soft, still 

 milky, with simple direct flavours and tangy, sometimes 

 with herbs added. Treat them like a lady. Match with young 

 wines that also have the same notes and match the acidity 

 in the cheese Sauvignon Blanc, Reisling or young sparkling 

 wine.

 White mould cheeses like 

 Brie and Camembert. When mature they have an oozy, creamy, 

 golden centre and stronger-flavoured rind, so you need wine 

 with a fuller bouquet. A classic match is Chardonnay or 

 Pinot Noir. 

 Washed rind cheeses like 

 Taleggio, Raclette and Tilsit. A diverse group ranging 

 from mild, moist cheese to crazy, runny and stinky. Start 

 with a range from an aged sparkling wine to a full-bodied 

 Pinot Noir or Reisling.

 Blue cheeses like Stilton, 

 Gorgonzola and Cashel. These can be salty and tangy 

 or rich and creamy. People would say these can be tricky 

 to match with wine and the safest match is a time-honoured 

 one: sweet wine. For the milder blue, a Reisling and 

 for the more powerful blues, increase the power in the wine, 

 experiment with Muscat and Tawny Port.

 Semi-hard cheeses like 

 Edam, Gruyere, Havarti and Swiss-styles. Another diverse 

 group, but at last you have landed in red wine territory. 

 The older the cheese the more robust the wine. Choose a 

 good Shiraz or Cabernet Sauvignon. 

 Hard cheeses like Parmesan, 

 Pecorino, Cheddar and Double Gloucester can have a strong 

 yet slightly sweet nutty flavour. Match these with fortified 

 wines like Muscat that also have sweet nutty flavours 

 and have the weight or strength to stand up to these powerful 

 cheeses. 

 If you are looking for a cheese 

 to match that red youve had cellared away for a few 

 years, this is the cheese style to do it with.

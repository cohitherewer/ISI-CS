The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rights cry by drug suit accused 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After being kept behind bars for 39 months, 45-year-old H. Lalawizauva, one of the alleged members of the drug racket busted at the Salt Lake residence of former CBI additional director Upen Biswas in 2003, has threatened to approach the state human rights commission against the treatment meted out to him.

 The former receptionist at Mizoram House in Salt Lake held the prison authorities responsible for the loss of six teeth and claimed that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the agency probing the case, had failed to come up with evidence against him.

 The division bench of Calcutta High Court had observed while granting Lalawizauva bail last week that no document was produced necessitating the detention of the accused.

 Lalawizauvas wife Laltinrengi Tochhong alleged that though he had suffered a teeth infection in jail in May 2003, he was forced to eat solid food, which worsened the condition.

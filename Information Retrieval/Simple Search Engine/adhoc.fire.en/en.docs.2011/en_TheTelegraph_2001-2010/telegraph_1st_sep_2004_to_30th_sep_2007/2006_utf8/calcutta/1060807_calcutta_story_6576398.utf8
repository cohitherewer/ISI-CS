 Autopsy debut in medical syllabus 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The real cause of a patients death in a teaching hospital will no longer be shrouded in secrecy, as the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to introduce pathological autopsy in the medical curriculum.

 Pathological autopsy, mandatory in some premier health institutions in the country, helps determine the exact cause of death through analysis of tissues taken from various parts of the corpse.

 The course will benefit students in a big way and will also boost medical research in our institutes, said director of medical education Jayashree Mitra. Several modalities, however, need to be worked out before the subject is introduced.

 Under the proposed system, pathological autopsy will have to be performed after at least six hours of a patients death and preceded by a no-objection letter from the patients relatives.

 There are two types of autopsy medico-legal (commonly known as post-mortem), which is carried out in case of unnatural deaths, and pathological. 

 Medical or pathological autopsy is conducted to find out the exact cause of death and also to verify whether the patient was administered the right treatment, explained a health department official.

 The West Bengal University of Health Sciences, which affiliates medical colleges in the state, has initiated the process of introducing the topic in the curriculum. 

 We are trying to find out how best pathological autopsy can be incorporated into the syllabus, said vice-chancellor S. Majumdar. 

 Under the existing system, a medical student is required to attend 12 post-mortem cases at the undergraduate level.

 Officials pointed out that the health department has started the practice of auditing prescriptions in government hospitals. 

 We are finding out, case by case, whether patients are being administered the correct medicines. The findings of pathological autopsy will supplement the audit results, said an official.

 Pathological autopsy is a must in many top hospitals in the country like PGI (Chandigarh), AIIMS (Delhi) and Chennai Medical College. If the system is introduced here, it will usher in a sea change in the field of medical education and research, said Brojo Roy, of Ganadarpan, a city-based NGO that has long been fighting for the introduction of the subject.

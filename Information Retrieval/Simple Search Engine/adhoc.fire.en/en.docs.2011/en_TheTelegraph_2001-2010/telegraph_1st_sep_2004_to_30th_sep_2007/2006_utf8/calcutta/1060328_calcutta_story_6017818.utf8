What: First anniversary celebrations of Yo 

Foodies, the food court at Hiland Park. 

 Where: The Metropolis, 1925 Chak Garia.

 When: A weeklong celebration that began on March 24.

 Take a look: The celebrations kicked off on a noble note with the launch of Chalti Ka Naam Wheelchair by artist Suvaprasanna, a fund-raising venture from the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP). Darshan Shah, proprietor of Weavers Studio, and danseuse Priti Patel were present at the launch. This is an anniversary celebration with a difference, where physically challenged individuals have been given a reason to smile. I hope other organisations follow their example, smiled Suvaprasanna. 

 Children from IICP flagged off the celebrations by singing Muskurata hai aaj ye jahan.

 In the evening, a puppet show for children and a performance by Francis Lepcha kept the birthday mood going. Saturday saw a display of art and talent at the sit-and-draw competition for children. There were quiz rounds on Saturday and Sunday.

 As part of the week-long anniversary celebrations, there are special combo meals available at the food court. Offers include a free Pepsi with an Indian platter, a bowl of soup free with an Oriental platter and so on.

 Voiceover: In the past one year we have received an overwhelming response and want to carry the success story further with more value additions. We are glad that the IICP children are here today as a part of the celebrations, smiled Apratim Dhar from Yo Foodies.

 Floor fashion

 What: Launch of Pergo Design Centre.

 Where: 6-A, Middleton Street.

 When: March 25.

 Take a look: This is the 14th Pergo store across India and the first of its kind in eastern India. Matte, oiled, textured, natural or polished? The 400 sq ft showroom specialises in a wide range of laminate wooden flooring solutions.

 The wear-resistant surface is made of durable melamine laminate and is bonded to a wooden based substrate. The laminate is a combination of several different layers merged together under heat and high pressure.

 The patented TitanX Surface technology (a coating of aluminium oxide spray) guards against scratches and the Smartlock system provides a tongue-and-groove system to ensure easy and accurate installation. They come with warranty against staining, fading, fire and water damage.

 The range includes Pergo Original, inspired by Scandinavian designs, and includes classic styles in oak, mahogany, maple and beech finish. 

 The Pergo Exotic in saturated colours of the tropics has a burnished finish. On offer are styles like Fire Red Walnut, Java Teak and so on. 

 The Pergo Vintage draws inspiration from the late 19th century and has a characteristic rustic appeal. On offer are styles like White Pine, Vintage Chestnut and Aged Elm. Other categories include the Pergo Universal that is a combination of good looks and durability and Pergo Uniq.

 A special software has been created so that customers can choose their flooring in accordance with their wall colours.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start around Rs 130 per sq ft.

 Voiceover: We stand for wide range, quality and durability. With the real estate scenario booming, we are expecting to do well in this part of the country. A showroom in Bhubaneswar is in the pipeline, says K.R. Shivshankar, CEO of Pergo.

 Costume call

 What: Maaya, a creative jewellery exhibition from Jaipur.

 Where: APN Square at 5A, Robinson Street and Saturday Club.

 Take a look: The exhibition houses contemporary pieces as well as some traditional Rajasthani ornaments. On display are some exotic pieces in silver, gold-plating, rose-cut diamonds or polki. Stones like lapis lazuli, coral, crystal, pearls and topaz interplay with metals.

 The eye-catcher at this show is the collection of beaded scarves. Priced between Rs 4,500 and 6,500, these scarves are available in various hues like coral, turquoise, black, white, amethyst, orange and aquamarine.

 This line of jewellery by Banu Bajoria will be available at APN Square on a regular basis once the exhibition is over.

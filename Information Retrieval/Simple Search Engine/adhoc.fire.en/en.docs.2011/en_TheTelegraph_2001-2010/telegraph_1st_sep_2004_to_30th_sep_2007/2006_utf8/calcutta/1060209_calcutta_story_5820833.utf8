 Lone witness: The remains of the razed church after the demolition drive 

 The report ?Small turnout, big turmoil?, January 18, reminded me of what John Fitzgerald Kennedy had said about politicians. ?Politicians are there only to unsettle the settled things,? the former President of the United States of America had once remarked. 

 The January 17 Youth Congress meeting, held opposite Victoria House, underscored once again how right Kennedy was. What else can be said about the people who organised a chaotic rally that kept children waiting in buses for hours on their way home from school and stranded ambulances in the middle of the road? 

 Thousands all over the city were affected by the widespread traffic disruption that stretched from north to south. The political leaders could not care less about the fact that President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was visiting the city on the same day. 

 If the leaders are under the impression that unsettling the settled schedule of the public on a weekday afternoon would help them earn votes, then they cannot be farther off the mark. 

 If the rally had been organised on the Sahid Minar grounds, instead of the stretch in front of Victoria House, not only would the public have not been inconvenienced, but the party would have found some sympathisers for its cause. The politicians, as usual, did not bother about the hardships of the common man, and ended up alienating them further.

 Apropos the report ?Airport route church razed?, January 16, the demolition of Christ Ashram Church, though justified, was not carried out in the proper manner by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). 

 Some months ago, the ministry of civil aviation had targeted a mosque that allegedly encroaches on the Dum Dum airport runway. Despite the hardline stance of the clerics, the matter did not turn into an unsavoury controversy due to the timely intervention of the civil aviation minister. 

 The CMDA obviously enjoyed the support of the state government, but bungled the demolition drive. More transparency regarding rehabilitation measures was desperately needed. 

 Perhaps, the road could also have been constructed without demolishing the church. 

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati. 

 If a church can be demolished for greater good, why can?t a temple or a mosque? A small mosque encroaches on the runway of the Calcutta airport. Despite pressure from the Centre, it can neither be razed or shifted. Faced with such a situation, why did the government dither to issue a demolition order? Does this lack of political will not betray the pseudo-secular nature of the government? 

 Pradip Kumar Chowdhury, 

 Raja Kali Krishna Lane. 

 It is unfortunate that the church authority could not produce any document to prove that it owned the plot. Several temples and mosques have illegally come up across the city. The number of such structures, which also illegally use water supplied by the civic department and power, is growing rapidly, blocking important roads in the process. The citizens are having to pay for them by way of higher taxes. 

 D. Ghosh, 

 Salt Lake. 

 It is heartening that the government is removing hurdles in the way of development. But if the structure was a mosque instead of a church, would the government and the court have been so positive? The presence of a mosque on the airport premises begs the question. Has the Christian community been singled out because it is non-violent? 

 Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street. 

 The demolition of a church to build a road was nothing but an election gimmick. The ruling party need not have taken so extreme a step, the Opposition being what it is. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Apropos the report ?Board status raises brow?, January 14, the joint entrance board has rather belatedly decided to pose only multiple-choice questions in the examination from this year. The move is unfair since it has given the examinees this year little time to prepare. However, objective type questions will help students in the long run. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala. 

 It is wonderful that an exhibition of archival and contemporary photographs of the tribals of Arunachal Pradesh was organised at Academy of Fine Arts (Light on hinterland, January 20). It is high time the Indians realise that the country extends far beyond the confines of Bollywood, Cyberabad and New Delhi. The culture of the Northeast is an asset, but sadly it is never highlighted by the media, which is out to woo and promote the ?mainstream?. More such exhibitions will not only acquaint us with the North-east, and make the people living there feel less like aliens. 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur. 

 Apropos the report ?Life of birds and beasts, on film?, January 19, it is good that Nandan has hosted the third Aranyak Wildlife Film Festival. Wildlife awareness in the country has to be increased manifold to stop poaching. The youngsters, especially, should be made aware of the importance of protecting wildlife. Such film festivals would influence people to act against tree-felling. 

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane. 

 Apropos the report ?Advantages of ex-army expertise?, January 16, the resettlement board has taken the right step to solve the crisis of the growing number of retired army personnel. The technical expertise that the army personnel acquire should not be wasted. Given their trouble-shooting expertise, employers will be eager to have them on the rolls. Mid-level personnel, however, still struggle to land suitable jobs. 

 Amit V. Sengupta,

 Sarat Colony. 

 Apropos the report ?Why angel lost its twirl?, January 19, it is sad to learn that the angel atop the Victoria Memorial Hall has not rotated since 1985. The authority should leave no stone unturned to get it rotating. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Next weekend you can be at Nurpur?, January 22, there is a direct bus to Nurpur. There is also a boat service from Nurpur to Geonkhali. 

 R.E. Mistry,

 Park Street.

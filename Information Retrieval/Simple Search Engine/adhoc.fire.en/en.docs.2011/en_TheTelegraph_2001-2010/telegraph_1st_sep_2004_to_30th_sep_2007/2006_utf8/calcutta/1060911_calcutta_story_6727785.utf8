 Pre-Puja patch-up of roads

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A patch-up job on incomplete tram track repairs is the best the city can hope for before the Puja.

 With the festival round the corner, patchwork on tram tracks will have to completed by 10 days. Permanent repairs will be carried out after the Puja, announced finance minister Asim Dasgupta at Writers Buildings on Sunday afternoon.

 He had earlier discussed the matter with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera and officials of the transport department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 The finance minister expressed dissatisfaction at the absence of representatives of the agency carrying out the repairs at the meeting.

 Dasgupta, accompanied by the transport minister, the mayor and the officials, later visited several spots in north, central and east Calcutta to assess the progress of the tram track repairs. 

 About 80 per cent of the repairs have been completed. We want people to have a trouble-free commute during the Puja, stated Dasgupta.

 Transport minister Chakraborty said the repair work was hampered by the two-day tanker strike that ended on Sunday morning. 

 The repairs could not be carried out due to unavailability of bitumen, he claimed.

 jacket just right

 Boleros, bandhgalas trenches, 

 shrugs, crossovers, blazers, mini-coats And then, there 

 are jackets of a few more kinds fencing, sporty and swing. 

 Just a cover for cold, you still think? 

 Jackets appear every winter, in 

 strict international silhouettes or with some desi dash.

 This year, jackets come in a minimal 

 avatar, says designer Sucheta Merh no fuss, no clutter, 

 no decoration and a sprinkle of just-about-there 

 embellishments. 

 The fabric is in focus, the texture 

 is striking and the putting together very western. 

 She shares with GoodLife some ways to complement 

 typical body types with the perfect jacket. 

 Size 8

 Any jacket style will 

 complement this body type. Choose from a sporty one to a 

 bandhgala. 

 Fabrics could be heavier 

 cottons or lightweight chiffons, multiple layered. 

 Play with a riot of rainbow 

 colours. 

 Team up with anything 

 from baby-doll dresses to capris to leggings. And raise 

 the oomph factor with a pair of flat ballerina shoes. 

 Top-heavy 

 A mini-coat looks great. 

 Keep top half clutter-free 

 not to draw attention to the bust. 

 Accentuate the cuffs with 

 some embroidery, crochet or thread work. 

 You can carry on the cuff 

 detailing to the hemline for an added effect. 

 Pick bright, happy colours. 

 Make sure they are solid colours to cut down 

 the bulk. 

 Team it with a pair of 

 well-fitted jeans or a skirt with the length varying from 

 mid-calf to ankle.

 Pear-shaped 

 A trench works best. Also, 

 try a waist-length bolero, dress coat or Nehru jacket. 

 The length of the jacket 

 is of prime importance. It should cover the hips.

 Play around with the top 

 half of the piece. An exaggerated collar design will look 

 nice.

 Stay away from extra light 

 colours and fabrics.

 Size 14 

 A cape-style, mantle or 

 cloak jacket will suit larger frames. 

 Variations of a trench 

 will also work. 

 A great hide for excess 

 weight is a shawl-jacket or poncho-jacket.

 Pick fabrics like traditional 

 cottons, wool blends and pashmina for the shawl- jacket. 

 Emphasise self-detailed 

 fabrics like a subtle print, tone-on-tone. 

 Team the jacket with pants 

 that suit your frame. 

 Darker colours always 

 lend an illusion of a slim look. Choose from 

 blacks, navy, maroon or the seasons hottest hue, chocolate 

 brown. 

 Stay away from exaggerated 

 collars.

 Add-on appeal

 Styling assumes great importance 

 this season. Three must-haves to get the most of a jacket 

 are some belts, a pair of boots (ankle, knee or calf-length) 

 and some cool head accessories like bands, clips and caps, 

 adds Sucheta. 

 Heres more from her on how 

 to max the belt fabric or leather.

 The belt is the perfect 

 waist-controlling factor. 

 A wide belt accentuates 

 a slim waistline and a narrow belt covers up a wider waist. 

 Big, chunky belts are 

 in.

 Jazz up the belt with 

 a play of brooches or exotic pins. 

 Trimmings on belts look 

 hot.

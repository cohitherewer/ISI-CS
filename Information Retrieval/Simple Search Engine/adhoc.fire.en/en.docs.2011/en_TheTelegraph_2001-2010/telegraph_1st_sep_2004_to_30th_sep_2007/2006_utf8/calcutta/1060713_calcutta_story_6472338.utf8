The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Come, make a movie for me

 Screen On amp; Off

 Big corporate banners are now signing 

 up smaller production houses to deliver a fixed number of 

 films within a fixed budget in a fixed time, finds Pratim 

 D. Gupta

 The corporate connection in Bollywood 

 is not going to fizzle out with Madhur Bhandarkar?s latest 

 film. Gone are the days when a bank or a company chipping 

 in for a commercial movie would make national news. These 

 days it?s difficult to imagine a film that doesn?t have 

 a Percept Picture Company or Adlabs Films or Sahara One 

 tucked away somewhere.

 And this corporate-creative marriage 

 is entering a new phase in tinsel town. The biggest of film 

 corporations are now signing up the biggest of movie directors 

 for multiple projects. And this despite these directors 

 themselves heading smaller companies.

 So you have an Adlabs Films signing 

 Ram Gopal Varma for 10 films at a cost Rs 100 crores to 

 be produced in the next two years. Now, Ramu himself may 

 not be directing all the movies himself and would have his 

 Factory makers dishing out the movies for Adlabs. As Adlabs 

 Films chairman-cum-managing director Manmohan Shetty tells 

 Metro: ?Actually all the film-makers that we have 

 tied up with have their own production houses. This brings 

 in more synergy as they will work as line producers. We 

 will shortlist the subjects together and they will produce 

 it on behalf of Adlabs.?

 Apart from Varma, Adlabs has signed 

 up Vipul Shah for 12 films for Rs 210 crore over three years, 

 Prakash Jha for five films at a cost of Rs 80 crore over 

 two years and Rohan Sippy for three films at a cost of Rs 

 20 crore over two years.

 Isn?t this like jumping the gun 

 in an industry that rises or falls with every Friday? ?As 

 an entertainment conglomerate we need to be producing around 

 10 films a year and so we are looking at around 30 films 

 over a period of two to three years,? explains Shetty. ?And 

 entertainment needs planning since it?s a long process from 

 deciding the script to talking to the proposed cast for 

 blocking dates to finalising the crew to pre-production, 

 production, post-production and then the release itself.?

 And it?s not just Adlabs. You 

 have Sahara One signing up Madhur Bhandarkar for three films, 

 Anubhav Sinha making six films for Percept Picture Company, 

 Sanjay Gupta?s White Feather Films delivering one film every 

 six months for Ektaa Kapoor?s Balaji Films. Even the brother 

 and sister team of Saif Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan are planning 

 to get into production by making movies for Balaji.

 So why this sudden switch of sides 

 for these film-makers from independent financiers to corporate 

 houses. ?Smooth flow of structured finance,? says director 

 Sujoy Ghosh, whose two films Jhankaar Beats and Home 

 Delivery have been produced by Pritish Nandy Communications 

 and Percept Picture Company. The technical jargon Ghosh 

 uses has to do with the eight years he spent as a Reuters 

 business correspondent.

 ?When you make a film with a corporate 

 house, you work on a specified budget and a specified deadline 

 and that helps the film to be made at a certain cost and 

 within a certain time,? Sujoy adds. ?Also, with their corporate 

 set-up the creative interference is nil. At least I was 

 lucky that I had complete creative independence. No wonder 

 it is the Hollywood model to make movies.?

 There are also companies like 

 Planman Motion Pictures that insist on doing their own production 

 work. Says Planman CEO Subho Shekhar Bhattacharya: ?Producing 

 films is not just an investment option for us. We want to 

 be part of the process rather than just put in the money. 

 So all the tie-ups we have done till date ? four films with 

 Rituparno Ghosh, three films with Aziz Mirza ? we have insisted 

 on doing the production work ourselves. It is a mutual creative 

 effort.?

 Adlabs?s Shetty believes that 

 one can have a creative say without being involved hands-on. 

 ?All creative decisions will be taken together and we will 

 work towards making quality productions and the projects 

 more viable,? he spells it out. ?Such a set-up is an extension 

 of business and adds to the entire value chain. Vipul will 

 not be directing all the films we have signed with him; 

 he in turn will hire directors. Basically this studio model 

 is empowering more business (and translating into more money) 

 in the entire value chain.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Games on the move in vernacular

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Ready to play: The three games on the mobile screen in Bengali 

 For those with fingers active on the mobile keypad, here is a chance to play Malaika Rusedki, a 24-year-old Russian student of adventure tourism on a tour of Egypt, and fight an ancient curse in a pyramid. All in Bengali or Hindi, or whatever your mother tongue is.

 Wireless entertainment has gone vernacular. Mauj Telecom, India?s leading wireless solutions provider, has introduced mobile games in eight Indian languages. 

 So far, English was the only option in mobile gaming. ?Hardly three to four per cent Indians understand English. Even then, some can do only the basic reading. In the four metros, too, 50 to 70 per cent are not comfortable with the language. This is the only way to connect to the real India,? reasons Mauj Telecom COO Arun Gupta. 

 Gupta?s logic is backed by the growth curve of the mobile market. The last year, he points out, saw the highest spurt in numbers in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Gujarat, Bengal and Bihar. The metros lagged behind these spots.

 To keep up with this development, the company took the database of the three most popular games, hired full-time translators and got them to redo the storyline. 

 Thus Against All Odds ? a fight against an ancient Egyptian curse of the pyramid ? has become Sab Kichhur Biruddho while The Diffuser ? a challenge to diffuse landmines ? is reborn as Parakramee in Bengali. Some glitches have stayed though ? Airy Fairy is Uda Jahajer Katha rather than uro jahaj, the Bengali for an aeroplane.

 International trends put shooting and racing games at the top of the popularity chart. In India, arcade games, which a good player can keep playing indefinitely and which automatically upgrade to higher levels of difficulties, are equally popular. But unlike ringtones, the use of the game involves a fair bit of understanding of the language ? the storyline has to be read and manipulation of the controls understood from the instructions.

 The vernacular venture is striking a chord even with an unlikely set. ?Even people adept in English are thrilled at seeing their mother-tongue on screen,? says Gupta.

 The company, with a repertoire of 1,300 games, available on GPRS-enabled handsets, wants to release three games every month for the next one year. Plans are afoot to go gaming in Punjabi, Bhojpuri and Kannada as well.

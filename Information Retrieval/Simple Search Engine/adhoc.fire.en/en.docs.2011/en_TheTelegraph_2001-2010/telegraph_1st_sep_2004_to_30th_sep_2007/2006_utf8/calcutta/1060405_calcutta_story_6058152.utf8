 Of course it is sheer panic. Newspaper pages and television screens are flooded with chicken being slaughtered. So much blood and gore is putting people off. The disease has been in existence for some time and has been making an appearance on and off in other countries. Only this year did the media hype the disease so much. If there was logic in consumer behaviour, then duck would have been avoided as well. It is avian flu we are talking about, not chicken flu. Also chicken eggs are being consumed as before in our restaurant, as are products made with them. It is only the order for chicken that we had to reduce by half and concentrate on mutton and sea food. It will take another month for normalcy to return.

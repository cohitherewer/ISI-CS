 High-power panel seeks opinions

 - Presidency 

 College autonomy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state governments much-hyped plan to grant autonomy to Presidency College seems to be taking a shape.

 A five-member high-powered committee, set up by the government before the Assembly polls to examine the proposal of granting autonomy to the state-controlled college, has started functioning.

 After holding its first meeting this month, the panel has sought opinions from various sections associated with the institution. They have been asked to give their views by September 12.

 The panel is dealing with a very important issue. We will have to thoroughly examine the opinions. Our recommendations will be ready in three months, said Subimal Sen, convener of the committee. Sen is also vice-chairman of the West Bengal Council for Higher Education.

 Among those who have been approached for views are principal Mamata Roy Chowdhuri, and the members of the Association of Teachers of Government Colleges in West Bengal and the Alumni Association of Presidency College.

 The panel has been asked to suggest ways of granting autonomy to the college in academic, financial and administrative matters.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced in the Assembly in February that the issue would be resolved at the earliest, preferably before the start of the current academic session.

 Another city-based college St Xaviers has started functioning as autonomous institution from July.

 The government, however, felt the need to get the Presidency proposal examined by a high-powered committee after a section of teachers from state-controlled colleges, including Presidency, opposed the move.

 The teachers argued that instead of declaring the institution an autonomous college, it should be converted into a university that will have within its ambit all 17 state-run colleges across the state.

 Some suggested that the college be accorded the status of a deemed university. All staff members of Presidency, around 350, are now government employees. They will lose the status if the college is given full autonomy like that of St Xaviers.

 We have informed the government about our stand, said Harendranath Bhattacharya, a senior teacher of the college and general secretary of the Association of Teachers of Government Colleges in West Bengal. We are not against autonomy. But we want teachers to retain their present status.

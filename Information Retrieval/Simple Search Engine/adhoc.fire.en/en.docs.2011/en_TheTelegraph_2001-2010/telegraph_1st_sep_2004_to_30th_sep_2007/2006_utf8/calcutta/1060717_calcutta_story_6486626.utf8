The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic snarls stall residents 

 Baiswanor chatterjee, Trinamul Congress councillor from the Ballygunge-Dhakuria area, met readers of The Telegraph. 

Participants included Toton Basu, Dilip Upadhyay, Kailash Haldar, Rabi Dhar, Apurba Mukherjee, Ratan Haldar and Debasish Kundu

Toton Basu: Car-owners living on Gariahat Road, Lake Road and in Southend Park are facing a lot of problems due to unauthorised parking of cars on the either side of Gariahat Road, in front of AMRI Hospitals. The area has become the largest unauthorised parking zone in the city. How long will we have to suffer for a private hospital?

 I know about the problems you are facing. The entire traffic system grinds to a halt during the hospital?s visiting hours. The road is choked with vehicles and it is quite difficult to drive or even walk. Residents of Shibnath Bhavan have already lodged a complaint. I, too, have brought the matter to the notice of police. But the government and other high-ups in the city are reluctant to take any step. 

Dilip Upadhyay: Recently, a corridor was constructed by AMRI Hospitals on a plot which originally belongs to Lake View High School. How can a government-sponsored school allow such a construction on its plot for the benefit of a private hospital?

 There is an agreement between the managing committee of the school and the hospital authorities. Hence, I can do nothing about it. I was told about this development. Somebody had complained that the schoolchildren couldn?t play as there is no space. 

 On inquiring, I was told that the school authorities had allowed the construction against the grant of a development fund. On the other hand, the hospital has also assured free treatment for the students. 

 The corridor is basically a weather passage between the old and the new compound of the hospital.

Debasish Kundu: Slum-dwellers in Ballygunge are facing an acute shortage of drinking water. Of the 20,000 voters in the ward, 12,000 are in the slums. Still, we are facing several problems. Can you help us?

 I have planned to increase the number of standpipes in the slums. The Asian Development Bank is also working towards improving the basic infrastructure in the slums.

Rabi Dhar: Till 2005, the areas near Kankulia Kalibari had never faced problems related to waterlogging. But it is quite surprising that after the commissioning of Southern Avenue drainage pumping station last year, we are facing waterlogging problems. What is the reason behind this?

 It is true that with the commissioning of Southern Avenue pumping station, the waterlogging problem has worsened in these areas. 

 Some of the pipe-laying work is still not over, particularly on the northern part of the pumping station. I think the problem will be resolved soon.

Apurba Mukherjee: The residents of Gariahat Road, Southend Park, Gariahat, Panchanantala and Southern Avenue are also facing problems related to waterlogging. I feel the Southern Avenue pumping station is of no use.

 You should admit that the waterlogging problem in these areas has improved after the commissioning of the pumping station. Earlier, after every shower, the area used to be submerged for over 30 hours. Now, within an hour, the rainwater recedes. Barring a few problems that I have discussed before, the pumping station is working well.

Kailash Haldar: There is only one small strip of kutcha road, measuring about 150 m, in the area. Why don?t you take steps to metal it?

 I am aware of this road strip. It is the common space between two buildings. Before taking any initiative to metal it, I should know whether this a private road or not. I will verify its status soon. If it belongs to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), I will take steps to metal it. But if it belongs to a private party, then they will have to hand over the land to the CMC.

Ratan Haldar: Theft of manhole covers has been rampant in the area. Uncovered manholes during the monsoons are deathtraps for pedestrians. On July 9, eight manhole covers were stolen from Jatin Das Road. Can you take up the matter with the police?

 The cast-iron manhole covers are the main targets of the drug addicts, who earn a lot of profit selling these covers. More than three dozens of cast-iron covers were stolen last year. We are replacing them with RCC covers. The police are aware of these thefts but not a single cover has been recovered. 

Concluded

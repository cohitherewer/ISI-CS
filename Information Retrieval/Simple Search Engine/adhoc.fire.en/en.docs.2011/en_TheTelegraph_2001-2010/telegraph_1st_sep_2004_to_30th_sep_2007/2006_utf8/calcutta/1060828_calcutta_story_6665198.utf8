 Suicide nets wife, in-laws

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five days after 35-year old Partha Das hanged himself at his Mall Road home in Dum Dum, police on Sunday arrested his wife Pampa, mother-in-law Tripti Pal, 55, and father-in-law Mukul Pal, 62. Das used to run a stationery shop.

 Unable to bear the torture of his wife and in-laws, Das took his life on August 21. He left behind a suicide note, said superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar.

 Asked about the delay in arresting the accused, an officer said: When a woman lodges a complaint under Section 498 of the IPC, we have to arrest the accused within 24 hours. But we need a lot of evidence to arrest a woman and her parents on the basis of a suicide note.

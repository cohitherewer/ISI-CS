 Water levy in Salt Lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

Come January 1, residents of Salt Lake will have to pay for the water in their taps. This decision was taken at a chairman-in-council meeting held on Thursday.

 Water tax is being levied to finance the upgrade of sewerage and drainage systems and other development projects, said Tapas Chowdhury, sub-divisional officer and executive officer of Bidhannagar Municipality.

 The tax rates will differ for commercial and residential properties.

 Residential plot-owners, who pay a quarterly property tax up to Rs 500, will have to shell out Rs 30 per month as water tax. Those paying more will pay Rs 60 per month.

 The rate for commercial plots Rs 100, Rs 300 or Rs 500 will depend upon the size of the supply line ferrule.

 According to municipal sources, rates for commercial holdings might change in future. The bill will be sent every three months.

 At present, Bidhannagar Municipality spends Rs 6 crore annually for water. 

 There are 18,000 buildings in the planned area of Salt Lake. We hope to raise around Rs 1 crore annually, said Chowdhury.

 Salt Lake had it coming for a while. On September 20 at Writers Buildings, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya had stressed the necessity to impose water tax on the township to pave the way for funds under the Union governments Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

 Rabindra Sarobar draws even more suicide attempts than the Metro Railway tracks. In the past couple of weeks, several people have tried to take their lives by jumping into the city?s biggest waterbody. Officers of Lake police station will soon start interacting with people who visit the Lakes, including lovers, so that they can pre-empt suicide attempts.

 ?It is not possible for the police to prevent suicides in this vast area. The number of policemen we deploy here is not enough. So, we are requesting the people to help us,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 Rabindra Sarobar witnessed six suicide attempts in the past couple of weeks. Five persons were saved by police, while a woman was rescued by two youth, identified as ganja addicts. Most of the suicides were from the adjoining areas, like Lake Gardens and Tollygunge. 

 On an average, at least 15 to 20 persons in a year commit suicide in the waterbody. The figure is higher than the Metro Rail record. ?The underground tracks have witnessed 136 suicide bids in their 18-year history. At least eight to 10 people on an average die every year,? said an officer at Lalbazar police headquarters. 

 An officer of Lake police station said since ?Rabindra Sarobar is the favourite tryst for young couples, we will talk to them. First, we will make them understand why we are approaching them. We will tell them that preventing suicides will not be possible without their cooperation. People will be given an idea of what to do if they notice a person drowning.?

 Last month, a youth had consumed poison sitting a few feet away from a young couple. They did not notice that the youth was gasping. It did not escape a cop?s notice. He rushed him to hospital. Doctors said had the youth been brought five minutes later, it would have been impossible to save his life.

 The style story ahead

 Neat and simple over mix and match, international sound over cheap remix, world cuisine over para palate ? heres looking at some of the lifestyle trends of the year

 In 2006, simplicity will be back in a big way. Weve had enough of chaos in fashion for the past few years, declares Calcuttas fashion guru Sabyasachi Mukherjee.

 He elaborates: No more mix and match and no more gypsy silhouettes. Neat, simple, structured silhouettes with simple detailing will be the order of the year.

 To start off, white will be the colour this spring, with neutrals like beige and pastels being common sights. Loud colours will take a backseat for some time to come.

 The mood will be grown-up romantic and not girlie romantic, hence elegance emerges as the byword. We will see a lot of return to classics, predicts Anamika Khanna.

 While this sets the mood for the style story of 2006, lets take a sneak peek into the citys couturegraph ? the people, places and shows that will matter this year.

 People

 The year is most likely to see at least a couple of fresh Calcutta faces popping up in the fashion week circuit. If the jury verdict goes in her favour, designer Sucheta Merh will be showcasing at India Fashion Week in Delhi this April.

 Designer Abhishek Dutta is set to launch his autumn-winter 2006-07 line at the Lakme Fashion Week 2006 ramp in Mumbai, end-March. The young designer will also make his debut at Bridal Asia in Delhi later this year. I will participate in the Miami Fashion Week in May and Asia Fashion Week in Singapore in October, adds Abhishek.

 While these are the new names going national, the year will also see our fashion biggies continuing to make their mark at the international level. Sabyasachi will start the year by launching his label at Selfridges in London in February. The year will also see his second Bollywood film after Black ? Rani Mukherjees Babul ? hitting the halls.

 Anamika will be seen at both the autumn-winter and spring-summer editions of London Fashion Week. The designer will also showcase her autumn-winter 2006-07 collection in Paris and the US and launch her collection at stores the world over.

 Kiran Uttam Ghosh is making her foray into the global market in a bigger way than ever before. The designer is launching her new international pret label starting with Switzerland and then moving on to other countries in Europe. The Kiran Uttam Ghosh couture label will be launched in five new countries after the nine existing ones. 

 High on designer duo Monapalis agenda this year is expansion in the form of a line of accessories. The designers will also showcase at the World Boutique Fair in Hong Kong, mid-January.

 Stops

 Abhishek D, a furniture and home furnishing studio from designer Abhishek Dutta at 7S, Cornfield Road, will be launched in March. The studio will house the entire range of furniture and home linen created by Abhishek, the first-of-its-kind venture by a fashion designer in the city. Chic and modern furniture in lots of metal, leather and wood and theme-based upholstery and home linen will find space on the racks.

 Prana, a 5,000 sq ft lifestyle store at 13/3, Ballygunge Circular Road, is slated to open on January 12. A venture by Kavita Khaitan, the store is a platform for designers from across the country to showcase clothes, jewellery, accessories, home decor products and silverware.

 Designer Kiran Uttam Ghoshs studio in south Calcutta thats coming up with the promise of housing things quirky and precious could be a real value-add to the citys lifestyle map.

 Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon, the first-of-its-kind lounge-cum-salon in Calcutta, will be opened in January at 78B, Sarat Bose Road. A brainchild of beauty expert Bridgette Jones, the two-storey salon spread over 3,000 sq ft will have exclusive zones like a nail bar, a bridal room, a hair therapy section, facial rooms and shampoo beds, apart from the usual salon services. 

 Lounge-effect lighting in rainforest green and the decor in canary yellow give the lower level a sunshine and nature feel, while the upper level wears an intense look with shocking pink lights and silver decor. 

 The bridal room, done up in gold with period furniture, has an ornate feel to it. An in-house caf? inside the salon is an added attraction.

 Events

 The citys fashion roster promises to be fairly full with the annual fixtures and some fresh surprises as well. The spring and autumn editions of the Blenders Pride Fashion Tour will see some eight design biggies of the country showcasing in Calcutta in April and October. And while the Stylefile ramp show went missing in 2005, it should be back this year.

 These annual events apart, the year will start off with a Suneet Verma solo in end-January, produced by Showhouse. Roxy at The Park has lined up a series of fashion concept events throughout the year. 

 Promotional events for international brands on the lines of the Christian Dior show held last December will dot the diary. 

 That apart, events involving some top names of Indian fashion are in the pipeline at the cocktail bar.

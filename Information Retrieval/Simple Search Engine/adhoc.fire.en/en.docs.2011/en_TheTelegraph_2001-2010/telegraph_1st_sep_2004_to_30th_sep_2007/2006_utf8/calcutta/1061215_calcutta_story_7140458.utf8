 Bandh and the brave

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Taking a cue from tech town in Salt Lake, many workers in the industrial belt of Howrah went to work, defying the Citu bandh on Thursday. 

 Most workers of units small and big stayed on overnight at their respective factories and workshops on Wednesday, to join work the next morning. 

 We stayed back on Wednesday night and worked today. We knew we would have problems coming in the morning, said Krishnadhan Das, a worker of Burn Standard Company, a leading public sector undertaking in Howrah.

 And Das was not alone. S.K. Bhowmik, deputy general manager of Burn Standard, said more than 60 per cent of their workers had stayed back and were present at their companys workshop on Thursday. 

 We managed to produce 50 per cent of our daily production on Thursday, despite the strong presence of the Citu here, added Das.

 Work was on mainly behind the shutters of workshops. Many small unit owners feared that Citu might create havoc later, if it came to know.

 I own a small unit. I cannot afford a non-working day. At least 50 per cent of the workers were present. I had downed the main shutters, said a metal industry owner in south Howrah, on condition of anonymity.

 It is amazing the way workers showed antipathy towards the bandh and worked today. On an average, 50 to 60 per cent workers were present at their workplaces, said Soumen Dey, general secretary of Intuc, Howrah.

 Rubbishing all such incidents, Citu leaders said the claims were baseless. 

 The bandh was total and peaceful in this part of Bengal, claimed Nimai Samanta, Howrah president of Citu.

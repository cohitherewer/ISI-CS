Life

 Survival of 

 the severed link 

 What can the loss of 

 a vestigial organ possibly do? It helped Chandrima 

 S. Bhattacharya see a pattern in things 

 SEX AND THE CITY

 Last week I was operated on for 

 appendicitis. Several things came out of it. 

 First, of course, the little piece 

 of flesh that was the most obvious link to my simian past. 

 (Though somehow I still feel that when Darwin spoke about 

 men descending from monkeys, he was not really thinking 

 of women.)

 Two, the knowledge that an appendicitis 

 operation can no longer be called that ? it has become appendectomy 

 But three, and most important, 

 maybe because I linked tails and other vestigial organs 

 with men, or maybe because I thought an extraneous, hurting 

 bit of flesh can be just snipped off, I was chastised. The 

 appendix, like the past, cannot be got rid off easily. Its 

 ghost lives on, making me see things.

 Thanks to laparoscopy, a few hours 

 after my operation, I was in a condition to stare from my 

 hospital bed and trace out patterns in clouds. But soon 

 the patterns seemed to jump out of the sky and take hold 

 of my life. It was eerie.

 It began with a book borrowed 

 from a friend, Burning Patience by the Chilean writer 

 Antonio Skarmeta. Its a miraculous love story set 

 in a small Chilean fishing village Isla Negra that has a 

 17-year-old postman with only one client: Latin Americas 

 greatest poet Pablo Neruda.

 The rest of the villagers are 

 barely illiterate. (Yes, yes, its the original of 

 the film Il Postilo.) The boy forces his friendship 

 on the poet and makes full use of Nerudas words to 

 woo his beloved, the tantalising Beatriz.

 The boy woos with metaphors, to 

 the great consternation of her mother, who prefers the real. 

 Her smile stretches across her face like a butterfly, the 

 postman tells Beatriz. But the obstacles to the path of 

 love vanish and the postman marries the girl and their marriage 

 is like one long spell of love. Well, almost, till the menacing 

 political landscape, which had showed a spurt of hope with 

 the election of Salvador Allende as President, closes in 

 ? on the country, and on the postman. He has to pay the 

 price for acting out poetry in real life.

 I finished the slim volume at 

 break-neck speed and tried to walk. It was difficult. I 

 went on to the next book. It was called Season of the 

 Rainbirds by Pakistani writer Nadeem Aslam. A few pages 

 into the book ? and I knew something was happening.

 The story, set in an obscure village 

 in Pakistani Punjab in the early 80s, is also about letters. 

 A bag of letters, lost 19 years ago, turns up and leaves 

 a trail of death. The village turns against two lovers, 

 a Christian servant girl and a highly-placed Muslim official, 

 who live together defying convention.

 Its the same sense of disaster, 

 same sense of love threatened by an impending calamity, 

 by social forces that are hostile to anything that does 

 not serve their interest, as much in a tiny village in Chile 

 as in Pakistan, where the rain forms the backdrop. One of 

 the letters written 19 years ago ? written by a woman to 

 her lover ? says: It rains on my soul all night.

 Then I got started on David Gutersons 

 Snow Falling on Cedars. It was beginning to be spooky. 

 Set in the obscure San Piedro Island, north of Puget Sound, 

 in the US, Snow Falling on Cedars begins with the 

 trial of a Japanese American fisherman charged with murder. 

 It is also the story of the love 

 between the Japanese girl, who grew up to be the wife of 

 the accused man, and a white man, against the backdrop of 

 World War II. As if that was not enough, the snow here seems 

 to fall on cedars as inexorably as the rain in the small 

 village in Pakistan. 

 Was there no story that was not 

 about isolation, memory, shadows ? and loss? What was I 

 talking about ? stories I had read, or me lying stretched 

 on my bed, waiting to be taken into the OT? I dont 

 know. It could be spooky. But it was also like music.

 I told a friend who had dropped 

 in ? I was back home ? that I was seeing patterns in things. 

 She asked me to consult Nikola Tesla, the genius credited 

 with inventing alternating current, among other things, 

 and who saw connections between everything.

 So I watched, again, the film 

 Coffee and Cigarettes, which is a series of apparently 

 unconnected scenes, because I knew that one episode in it 

 was called Jack shows Meg his Tesla Coil. Hmmm.

 Jack has put together the Tesla 

 Coil, based on Teslas original designs. It is an air-transformer 

 that converts low-voltage high current to high-voltage low 

 current. 

 But what hits Meg really is what 

 Jack happens to mention: that Tesla thought of the earth 

 as a conductor of acoustical resonance. She hits the spoon 

 against the coffee cup, and the soft clinking sound spreads 

 in gentle waves and everything in the film also falls into 

 place. 

 It is about patterns. All the 

 scenes are set in empty cafes, with two, at the most three, 

 characters over endless cups of coffee and cigarettes, over 

 chess-board table-tops and table-cloths. Over the same conversations, 

 too. The last episode, in which two old men drink coffee 

 from paper cups and pretend that it is champagne, has one 

 of them remembering that Tesla said that the earth is a 

 conductor of acoustical resonance. It was a fitting finale 

 to my delirium.

 I am fine now. I still dont 

 know whether Darwin was thinking of women at all when he 

 said men descended from monkeys, but I seem to be part of 

 a grand design.

 I have made peace with my severed 

 appendix. I still dont know what it was meant for. 

 But far from being exorcised, it lives on, linking me to 

 things.

 Everything is connected. Nothing 

 goes away.

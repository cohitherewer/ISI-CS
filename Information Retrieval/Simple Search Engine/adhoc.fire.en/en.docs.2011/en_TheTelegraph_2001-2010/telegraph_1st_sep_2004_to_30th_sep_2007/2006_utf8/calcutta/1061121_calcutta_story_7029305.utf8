A fault is foul or funny

 Be it a Jaipur foot, an eye patch, scars, speech impairment or any other physical disability, it is always associated with the foul or the funny on screen.

 Such associations create a wrong idea of disability amongst the audience, and we develop stereotypical notions about people with disabilities, said Ritika Sahani, singer-performer-activist and secretary of Trinayani. 

 Trinayani, a trust fund which works with and for people with disability, organised a workshop at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) to spread awareness about issues of disability. This workshop was a part of the Look at Me film festival organised by Trinayani in Calcutta schools.

 There are so many things we take for granted when we see or make movies. I had never thought about the way we portray villains but it is so true, said Praveen Kumar, a cinematography student at SRFTI.

 Movies are a very powerful medium with a far reaching effect and one should be careful of what is being shown, stressed Ritika. 

 In the course of the two-and-a-half-hour-long workshop, a number of short films were screened.

 Moments from Majid Majidis Color of Paradise and the audio described version of Munnabhai MBBS were shown.

 Now, Himesh Reshammiya alone is not good enough. For Vipul Shahs Namaste London starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif, Rhythm Dhol Bass (RDB), a popular UK band, will be singing for the soundtrack scored by Himesh. 

 RDB, known for its Bhangra music, is a group of three brothers from Bradford Kuly, Manj and Surj Singh. This would mark their debut in a Hindi film.

 RDB is huge in UK, having sold over 100,000 copies this year alone. The trio has performed in virtually every UK city, and also toured some parts of Europe, the US, Singapore, Dubai and even Australia.

 Says Vipul Shah: I needed RDB for one song because Namaste London is about cultural amalgamation between Indians and NRIs in the UK. British Asian Music is a perfect example of this fusion. It is hip, contemporary and has great rhythm.

 Last week saw the [V] brigade travel across the country auditioning potential faces to be the next VJ with the countrys top music channel. The second episode of [V] VJ Freshers will unveil the eight lucky finalists who will join the race.

 Jury members for the contest are Ranvir Shourie and Vinay Pathak, who started out as VJs with Channel [V] before becoming regular fixtures in films and TV shows.

 The two will guide the aspiring contestants through their journey, testing them and judging them all the way to the top.

 Watch the finalists do a little jig to the latest Bollywood chartbusters as they are judged for their spontaneity and presence of mind. VJ Freshers beams on Sunday, at noon.

 Dibakar Banerjees Khosla Ka Ghosla will be screened at the Kara Film Festival in Karachi this December. The UTV film will be part of the Indian package headed for the Karachi festival, between December 7 and 17.

 In its sixth year, Kara Film festival is an initiative towards the development of the film industry in Pakistan.

 Says Ronnie Screwvala, CEO of UTV: Khosla Ka Ghosla is a simple story that immediately connects with the human heart, thus breaking all physical boundaries. We are hopeful that the film creates the same magic in Pakistan as it did in India.

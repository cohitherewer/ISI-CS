 MITA MUKHERJEE

 It?s time parents inquired about the safety of their daughters on their way to and from school.

 A study being conducted by a Calcutta-based organisation has revealed that minor girls are most exposed to sexual abuse during their journey to school and back.

 Of more than 400 girls ? from English and Bengali-medium schools ? covered by the study, around 320 admitted to have been abused. Half of them were abused while they were travelling to school or returning home.

 The perpetrators, the study reveals, were family drivers, helps working on school buses and rickshaw-pullers. Those availing of public transport are scared of co-passengers and conductors. For the rest of the victims, the abusers were neighbours, relatives or even teachers.

 ?The problem is alarming. Parents, especially mothers, and the school authorities need to be cautious about it,? warned Subarna Ghosh, president, Society for Nature Education and Health (SNEH).

 The study is being carried out by SNEH under a human resources development ministry project, titled Strengthening Education in Human Values. Launched in April, it will continue till March next year. 

 Girls studying in classes III, IV and V ? between seven and 11 years of age ? have been interviewed.

 ?Girls are abused in a number of ways,? said Sramana Das Gupta, a psychologist and SNEH coordinator. ?Many of them said they don?t like the way their kaku (uncle) in the school bus tries to hold them tightly in his arms. A number of them have complained how uncomfortable they feel when the kaku forces them to sit on his lap when they don?t get a seat.?

 She added: ?Child abuse is an old problem. But the trend of little girls being victimised by people close to them is alarming.?

 In its report to be submitted to the Union ministry, SNEH will recommend that schools organise seminars and workshops with parents to create awareness among them on the issue.

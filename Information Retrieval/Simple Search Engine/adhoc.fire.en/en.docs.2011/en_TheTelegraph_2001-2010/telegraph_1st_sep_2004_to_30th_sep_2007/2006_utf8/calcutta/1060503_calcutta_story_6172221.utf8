 Speaking a global language, art transcends boundaries imposed by dialects and cultures, reaching out through richly expressive mediums of forms, colours and surfaces. The Voices of the Canvas, presents works by 30 artists that speak to the viewer on an extremely personal level. Creating a dialogue between the viewer and the viewed, the paintings often enable the former to gain an insight into the thoughts and ideas that inspired the artist to produce his work of art. Besides highlighting this unique confluence between the creator and the viewer, the exhibition also offers pure visual delight to the common art lover by way of its vivid, colourful and joyous representation of life and nature. Participating artists include Prokash Karmakar, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Suhas Roy, Sanatan Dinda, Bratin Khan, Aditya Basak, Ajoy Bandyopadhyay, Shyamal Mukherjee, Swapan Das, Subroto Gangopadhyay (one of his paintings appears above) and Sujit Karan.

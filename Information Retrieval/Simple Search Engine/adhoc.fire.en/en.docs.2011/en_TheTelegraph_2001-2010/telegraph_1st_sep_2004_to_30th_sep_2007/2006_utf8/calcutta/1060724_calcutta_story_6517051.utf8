 Four men struggle with work 

 and relationships while helping one another through the 

 often-comical roadblocks fate decides to throw their way.

 Based on the book by Kyle Smith, 

 Love Monkeyis an enticing drama that centres on a single 

 30-something record executive and his three male friends, 

 each at different stages of love and life.

 Tom and his friends face the 

 pleasures and pitfalls of dating and marriage while trying 

 to learn what really makes a woman tick.

 Golden Globe nominee THOMAS 

 CAVANAGH, who plays the central character, speaks about 

 the show that premiered on Sunday at 10 pm on Zee Caf?.

 Why is the show called Love Monkey? 

 Love Monkey is based on a book by Kyle Smith and we couldn?t come up with a better coupling of those two words or a better title so we thought we?d stick with what he gave us. Monkey Love, hmm? interesting, but might have been a different show. And the international audience might not be too happy with Monkey Love!

 Tell us about your character... 

 In Love Monkey, I play Tom Farell, a guy who signs bands, looks for bands for a music label, a rock label in this case. So his job is to pull the next big thing out of all the tonnes of CDs and live shows that he goes to see. 

 Do you have any say on the bands that might appear in future 

 shows? 

 Sure, I absolutely do, although I should be careful about what I say to you because it?s a deluge already with the CDs. Umm, I know this is very immodest to say, but the title track for the show was my own personal gig for a small group in Canada called The Odds and they do a song called, Someone who is cool, and that?s our title track. 

 How do you think that the show will go down with international 

 audiences? 

 Why the hell should we watch this crap? I don?t think international audiences will care much for it simply because of the acting. I tell you we can do so much better (laughs). Actually, it?s a cliche to say but it?s fairly obvious? music is one of the universal languages and people like music regardless of ? you look at the number of all the famous bands that cross the cultural and language barriers? Certainly we have that going for us. 

 Do 

 you think the show is going to launch some hit artistes? 

 Yeah. In the first episode we have this young talent, Teddy Geiger. In the story, the character I play discovers him in this smoky small bar in the mid-west. Geiger?s story paralleled with our story because while we were shooting the pilot, Teddy who had been playing in his garage up in New York signed a six-record deal with Columbia, and now he is on a 30-city tour, he?s on magazines... He?s a colossal talent and he?s 17! 

 How important is music in real life? 

 I don?t really care much for music. It?s just a job for me! (Grins)? No actually I?m a huge music fan. I played in a band in college, very poorly I might add, and I have a number of friends who are in the music industry which is sort of one of the reasons I wanted to try this out. And I am a music fan. I have about 10,000 songs on the iPod.

 Another character on the show is New York City? 

 New York City is a great place to shoot in. Everybody knows of NY City, everybody wants to visit NY City if they haven?t already. It is one of the destinations of the world. It?s a boon to shoot there and not only that it adds instant legitimacy to the show. Because we say no matter how bad the foreground acting is at least the background looks good because there is going to be the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building in the background!

 What: Pongal Festival.

 Where: Swabhumi.

 When: January 14, 10.30 am to 6:30 pm. 

 The festival: The programme saw 16 Tamil organisations celebrating Pongal, the four-day harvest festival of Tamil Nadu, under one roof. Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi graced the occasion, inaugurating the website www.kolkatatamilsangam.org of the Bharathi Tamil Sangam. He also unveiled a book titled Know Your Bengali by R. Nakkeerar.

 Attended by the young and old, the celebrations included a variety of cultural programmes. A Kavi Sammelan saw participants reciting poems on Pongal and an interesting film presentation showcased Jallikkatu, Tamil Nadus famous bullfight. A traditional festive speciality called Pongal was cooked and distributed among all present. But the folk dances ? an assortment of dummy horse dancers, fire dance, Karagam and Kavadi ? were the real show stealers.

 Voiceover: It is an auspicious event where we have all come together to celebrate a festival very dear to us. Moreover, this year Tamil has been acknowledged as a classical language and that too called for a celebration, said D. Gnanasekaran, convenor of Bengal Tamils Co-ordination Committee and president of Bharathi Tamil Sangam.

 Just chill

 What: Social evening of the Young Leaders Forum wing of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. 

 Where: Rang Durbar at Swabhumi.

 When: January 16, 8 pm onwards.

 The evening: The occasion was to celebrate the appointment of Sumit Dabriwal as the new president of the Young Leaders Forum. With a bonfire in the middle to keep oneself warm under the cold January sky, guests were seen interacting with each other, catching up with old friends, till of course Orient Express took the stage. 

 In the half-an-hour performance, the band went mostly instrumental, alongside some popular hits like Staying Alive and Summer of 69. Guests put on their dancing shoes and the first to take the dance floor was Sumit himself with jewellery designer Nilanjana Chakraborty. They were soon joined by musician Bikram Ghosh and his wife Jaya and the others followed. A bamboo dance performance by a group from the Northeast brought the fun-filled evening to a perfect close.

 Sip n bite: While an assortment of kebabs served as the perfect starters washed down with drinks, the main course was a fine mix that included Aloo Do Pyaza, Mushroom with Broccoli and Cheese, Palak Paneer, Dal Makhni, Chicken Butter Masala and Fish Sicilian. For a sweet ending, there was hot jalebi and ice-cream.

 Voiceover: The idea is to chill out, catch up with friends and have a good time with some great food, music and loads of drinks. The bonfire adds to the chilled-out atmosphere, giving it a touch of informality, said Sumit Dabriwal of Hiland Park fame.

 Buy binge

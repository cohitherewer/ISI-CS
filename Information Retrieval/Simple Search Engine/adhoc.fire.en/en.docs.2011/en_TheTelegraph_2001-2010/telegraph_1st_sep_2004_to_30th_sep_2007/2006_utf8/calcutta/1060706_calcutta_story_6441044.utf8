 Arrests in bank fraud 

 KINSUK BASU

 The manager and assistant manager of a Budge Budge bank have been arrested for their involvement in siphoning off money from depositors? accounts.

 Bank manager Manoj Behera and his assistant Sadasiv Sambarsa were held after the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) uncovered leads suggesting their involvement in the Rs 1.5-crore scam. 

 The case is being called pigmy scam, since it involves small depositors. 

 Two bank employees working as ?pigmy? agents, aided by Behera and Sambarsa, had allegedly withdrawn money from the accounts of several customers of the bank.

 ?This is the first time we have arrested senior bank officers for their involvement in a financial fraud. It appears that on several occasions, the bank manager had verified the signature of a loan applicant without checking the original signature. This, when the applicant did not want a loan in the first place. The assistant manager, too, ensured that the applications were cleared,? said a senior officer of the CID. 

 According to the investigators, a man named Pradip Kumar Mondal would go around Budge Budge collecting money on behalf of the bank?s ?pigmy? agent Vinod Kumar Raut. Mondal, who posed as a bank employee, had reportedly connived with the bank?s top brass to ensure that loan applications were passed.

 ?Mondal forged the signatures of some small depositors to apply for a loan from the bank. He persuaded the manager and the assistant manager to sanction the loans in exchange of a percentage of the amounts. In certain cases, the money was withdrawn from the savings accounts of depositors on the basis of forged signatures,? explained the investigator.

 Both Mondal and Raut have managed to give a slip to the CID sleuths.

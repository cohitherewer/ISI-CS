The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Lured by an advertisement in an English daily about a new BSNL scheme, I bought a recharge card worth Rs 2,000 with a talktime of Rs 2,500. After recharging my mobile, I was utterly surprised when the dealer asked me to cough up Rs 2,204, whereas the recharge card clearly said ?Rs 2,000, inclusive of all taxes and administrative charges?. After a heated argument with the dealer, he said it was ?the company?s rule of recharging, whether or not it was mentioned on the card?. He told me very rudely to pay the amount or just ?get lost?. When it is clearly written on the card that I have to pay Rs 2,000 inclusive of all taxes and administrative charges, why should I pay an extra Rs 204? Why are all these instructions not clearly mentioned on the recharge cards and the dealers in the know about the schemes?

 lFrom the customer?s point of view, it may seem like the dealer has cheated him. But actually he has not. The amount of Rs 204 the dealer charged is the 10.2 per cent tax on the Rs 2,000 recharge card. Few cards initially carried these instructions. But after the tariff change, to avoid such misunderstandings, we introduced a paper sticker for all Rs 2,000 recharge cards, which says ?pay Rs 2,204?. I think in this case the dealer might have forgotten to put the sticker on the card, or maybe, he didn?t get fresh instructions from BSNL to put the sticker. This is an exceptional case. Most of our recharge cards carry proper instructions.

Lessons to be learnt in Lion City

 The city-state of Singapore, easily accessible 

 through its vast air links, has one of the worlds 

 busiest container ports and is regarded as one of the most 

 network-ready countries in the world. Every year, more than 

 two million people from around the world converge on the 

 island nation for business and meetings, incentive travel, 

 conventions and exhibitions, attracted by its ability to 

 offer networking and business opportunities.

 The dynamic city rich in 

 contrast and colour was recently the setting for the launch 

 of Ivory The Indian Kitchen, a speciality Indian coastal 

 cuisine eating house, which also marked Calcuttas 

 first foray into the gourmet capital of Southeast Asia.

 Here are some lessons the promoters 

 of Ivory the team behind Grain of Salt learnt from their 

 Singapore sojourn, which could add some food for thought 

 to our F amp;B table.

Registration: The registration process is a 

swim in Singapore; anybody wishing to open an F amp;B outlet can apply on the 

Net.

Theres no ambiguity, with the dos and 

donts clearly spelt out. All you have to do is fill in the boxes and you 

get your licences, says Pankaj Tandon, managing director of PDK Shenaz Singapore 

Pte Ltd.

Obtaining 20-odd licences took less than a month for 

the 100 per cent subsidiary of PDK Shenaz, which had set up Grain of Salt (now 

also called Ivory) at 22, Camac Street.

Dignity of labour: Working in a restaurant 

or a bar is not considered to be a thankless job in Singapore, and personnel at 

all F amp;B outlets are treated with respect by the customers. Screaming 

at waiters if something is not right doesnt only mess up the ambience, it 

sends out wrong signals to the next-door diner, who could be a foreigner and take 

that unpleasant image back home, says Nitin Kohli, director, PDK Shenaz. 

In Singapore, the clientele at an F amp;B outlet is encouraged to voice complaints 

in a structured, disciplined manner and every complaint is addressed professionally.

A special programme initiated by the government called 

GEMS (service with a smile) aims to boost service standards further. You can recommend 

a waiters name to the management for some reward, which serves as an incentive 

for better service.

Standardisation: Whether you order a dish worth 

(Sing)$5 or (Sing)$30, you can be assured of the same quality and value for money. 

Singapore has layers of F amp;B outlets from food courts to hawker centres to 

fine dining.

The government watches you closely, monitors your 

performance and standards, because they want you to be successful, not to 

flex muscle, observes Arvind Bhatnagar, executive director, operations, 

of the Singapore company.

All the raw materials are HACCP-certified passing 

through the most stringent quality controls and state-of-the-art infrastructure 

ensures standardised systems. Availability of almost every kind of ingredient 

is another huge plus for any aspiring restaurateur, whatever be the cuisine.

Heritage preservation: Singapore has been at 

the forefront of restoration and adaptive reuse of its heritage structures, like 

most European countries have done so effectively. A case in point is Clarke Quay, 

on the edge of The Singapore River, where Ivory is located. Rows of 19th-century 

heritage shop-houses, which were once used as warehouses, have been restored and 

converted into hip clubs, bars and bistros.

Through clear and attractive signage, careful selection 

of the spread and innovative ideas to draw footfalls, the owners CapitaLand have 

created one of the most famous food-and-entertainment hubs in the world. Something 

our own Park Street can take a leaf out of. To begin with, can we have a fresh 

coat of paint for the crumbling Armenian edifices, clean up the sidewalks and 

instal attractive signage and street furniture?

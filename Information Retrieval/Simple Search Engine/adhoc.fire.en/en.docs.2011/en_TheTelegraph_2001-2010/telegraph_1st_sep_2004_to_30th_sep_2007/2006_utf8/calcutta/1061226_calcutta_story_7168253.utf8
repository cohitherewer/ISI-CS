The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cellphone data at risk, say hackers

 PRONAB MONDAL

 We are a group of hackers and we can access the data stored in your cellphone whenever we want to. 

 This is the crux of a letter sent to some cellphone users and service providers in town. 

 A copy of the letter was also sent to the cyber crime wing of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) a week ago. The sender identified himself as Sanju Vaidyanathan and said he was part of a hacker group from Hyderabad.

 We had hacked the databases of two leading cellphone service providers during our stay in the city six months ago. We have found that the companies havent bolstered their security yet, Vaidyanathan wrote in the letter mailed to CID deputy inspector-general (operations) Rajeev Kumar.

 The data obtained by the hackers had been mailed to the cellphone users, as reported in Metro on December 12. Some of the victims had lodged complaints with police.

 Cellphone service provider Hutchs Bengal head Sridhar Rao said: I have no information about these hackers. We will do the needful to protect our subscribers data.

 We never disclose the data we unearth to anyone but the subscribers. We have no intention of harming any subscriber. Their personal details are safe with us, claimed the hacker, who said he was a follower of Ankit Fadia, a pioneer of ethical hacking.

 Fadia denied any link with Vaidyanathan. I dont support what he and his men are doing. This is not ethical hacking, said the computer security expert.

 The hacker also claimed he had informed the service providers about the loopholes in security. They, however, did not respond or state their stand publicly, Vaidyanathan wrote in a letter sent to Metro.

 He assumed full responsibility for the unauthorised access and apologised to those whose data had been hacked: Your data has been shared only with you, no one else knows about it. We are here only to prove how your service provider is neglecting security. We are trying to force them to take an initiative to protect their clients data.

 In the letter to Kumar, the hackers requested him to impress upon the service providers the need to upgrade their security systems.

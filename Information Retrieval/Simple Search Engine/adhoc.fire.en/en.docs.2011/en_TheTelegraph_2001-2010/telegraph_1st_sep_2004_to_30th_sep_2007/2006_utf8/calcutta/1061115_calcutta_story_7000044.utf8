 Provocative art

 Presenting a powerful repertoire of art works that belong in the shadow area between iconoclasm and faith, Borderline, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, installations, stampworks and photographs by Ashim Purkayastha, attempts to shock viewers out of their complacent slumber and awaken social and political consciousness. In his works, the imagery of Gandhi, which defaces his popular representation as an idol of the republic, offers a strong critique of a nation whose symbolism has become hollow and which has betrayed the ideals that had inspired its foundation. Deformed and distorted images of revenue and postage stamps express the acute alienation, dislocation and sense of inequality felt by the artist himself as a citizen, a Bengali-speaking Assamese, who now lives and works in Delhi. In his sculptural installations, he turns the concept of the military on its head and points out the irony and futility of warfare.

 Event: Paintings, installations, stampworks and photographs by Ashim Purkayastha

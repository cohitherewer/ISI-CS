Weve seen his drapes spin magic on the silver 

screen. Weve seen his styles shining on the biggest stars. And now its 

time for Calcutta to get up close and personal with Bollywood fashion badshah 

Manish Malhotra. On Saturday night, Day II of Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2006 

at The Oberoi Grand. 

Very excited to show in Calcutta for the 

first time, Manish is bringing his spring-summer 2007 collection, the sensual 

line that earned him rave reviews at the India Fashion Week in New Delhi. 

I have thrown in some couture pieces for the 

festive season too some saris, lehngas and a few heavier ensembles, 

Manish tells GoodLife from Mumbai.

The ramp will see a mix: skirts and dresses from his 

diffusion line with couture pieces. Theres some fashion flow for men, too 

with some cool shirts and jackets.

The colours will be light (Calcutta should see 

my signature shades), gold and beige being the two hot picks. Some whites 

and also lots of prints. Basically, the show will flaunt exactly what my 

label stands for a bit of diffusion and a bit of couture, he promises.

 The fashion finale will also see Delhi-based designer 

duo Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna. They stormed the Calcutta scene just weeks 

ago in Tantra and they are back with good reason. 

The first city we chose to tour is Calcutta. 

Thats how much we love the place, says Rahul, from Delhi. The duo 

will showcase a glamorous festive collection.

Blenders Pride is a great platform for pret 

designers. It is like a mini fashion week. Its lots of fun and unlike the 

fashion week, when one gets to meet buying agents, this event gets us closer to 

the client, our real buyer, says Rahul. Their label is touring a third time 

with Blenders Pride. 

The silhouettes comprise skirts and dresses and there 

is lots of satin, lace and crochet. A festive colour palette 

is usually all red and fuchsia but we are offering lots of rose-pinks, browns 

and beige. The line also has some bling very different from the last India Fashion 

Week collection that was matte with blue, adds Rahul with a promise to be 

back in Calcutta for Stylefile in December.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Krrish crash averted

 - Pirated master CD seized

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Hrithik Roshan in and as Krrish

 It was meant to send Krrish crashing on the big screen. But thanks to the combined efforts of the Eastern Indian Motion Pictures? Association (EIMPA) and Calcutta Police, India?s first superhero continues to scale new heights at the city box-office.

 On Sunday afternoon, police at Calcutta airport seized a pirated master CD of the Hrithik Roshan film, flying in from Delhi, following a complaint lodged by EIMPA?s anti-piracy cell. The CD was to be made into thousands of copies for the grey market, to be sold for anything between Rs 50 and Rs 100 ? as opposed to one multiplex ticket of Rs 200.

 ?On Saturday, we had received a tip-off about the CD coming in a parcel (consignment no 57272994) from Delhi,? said EIMPA?s Babla Dey. ?The airport?s cargo officials confirmed that the parcel was being sent from Delhi?s Old Lajpat Rai Market to a Chandni Chowk address.?

 But no one turned up to claim the consignment. ?We finally opened the packet and found that the CD was, indeed, of Krrish,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 Krrish?s Bengal distributor Harsh Manchanda said they have been able to restrict pirated copies of the film from entering the city from other metros and Bangladesh.

 ?It?s only because Krrish is a big film and there?s a lot of heat around the movie that piracy hasn?t been able to penetrate markets so easily,? said Arijit Dutta, whose Priya has been running packed shows of Krrish since Friday.

 One nail-biting wait has ended but another has just begun.

 Following the announcement of the Plus-II results, students seeking admission to engineering or medical courses are waiting with fingers crossed for the publication of the merit lists of the entrance tests and allotment of seats.

 The merit lists of the IIT joint entrance and the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE) have been published, but counselling has not begun.

 The results of the West Bengal joint entrance exams (JEE) are yet to be published.

 Unless the AIEEE authorities conduct the counselling session, the successful students are not sure whether they will get a seat in an institute of their choice or a seat at all. The uncertainty is forcing even students whose names figure on the merit list to scout for admission forms in colleges. 

 ?I want to study medicine and since my AIEEE rank is 47 and 2966 at the state and national levels, I think I have a fair chance of securing a seat in an institute anywhere in the country,? said Aghniva Dutta of Hindu School, who ranked eighth in the Higher Secondary exams.

 ?But,? he added, ?I can?t be absolutely sure unless a seat is allotted to me. And since the counselling has not begun, I have collected forms for physics and mathematics honours from Presidency College.?

 Tanaya Das, a student of Hariyana Vidya Mandir, said: ?My AIEEE rank is below 1100 and I stand a chance of getting a berth in one of the reputed engineering institutes. But as the counselling is pending, I am also seeking admission to a reputed college for B.Sc honours.?

 As for the delay in the publication of the results of the state JEE, the authorities are blaming the Assembly poll schedule. N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor of Bengal Engineering and Science University and chairman of the state JEE board, said: ?The tests could not be conducted before the third week of May because of the polls. We would have got hardly 15 days if we had published the merit list before the HS results. All steps are being taken to ensure that the results are out in the next few days.?

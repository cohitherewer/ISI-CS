 CLUB 

 SANDWICH

 The Saturday Club Beauty Parlour 

 At a time when the city is experiencing 

 a salon spurt, Saturday Club is all set to offer its members 

 and their guests an all-new beauty destination. The Saturday 

 Club Beauty Parlour, run by Julie Sen, is soon going to 

 shift out of its 400 sq ft room and into a larger, more 

 swank 1,000 sq ft address, adjacent to the swimming pool.

 ?This new salon promises to provide 

 quality services at very affordable rates exclusively to 

 Saturday Club members and their guests,? says a spokesperson 

 for the club.

 The highlight of the ?new, improved 

 state-of-the-art salon? is an exclusive men?s section. ?Earlier, 

 men were allowed only on Sundays, and that too between 10 

 am and 6 pm. But now we will give them a separate massage 

 section attended by male masseurs, shower facilities and 

 shampoo stations,? adds the spokesperson.

 The ladies too have a lot of value-addition 

 to look forward to. Apart from regular services like hair 

 styling, cutting, colouring, spas, skin treatments, waxing 

 and threading, there will now be a fancy mehndi corner, 

 a novel nail bar, tattoo and massage facilities.

 The interiors of this beauty parlour 

 will help create the ?perfect ambience? and mood. ?Relaxation 

 is going to be the keyword,? smiles another spokesperson. 

 Proof: individual enclosures for facials, other skin treatments 

 and beauty services.

 ?I think upgrading the parlour 

 with an all-new look is a great idea. They already have 

 a great team that is extremely competent and well trained. 

 Basically, ladies love pampering themselves in a good-looking 

 and relaxing environment, hence I am looking forward to 

 the new salon,? smiles Renu Roy, convenor of the club?s 

 entertainment committee and a regular at the Saturday Club 

 Beauty Parlour.

 Modern beauty equipment, latest 

 colours and trends and trained beauty therapists are going 

 to characterise the salon. The current strength of 15 staff 

 members at the parlour is also expected to ?double?.

 ?In fact, the best thing about 

 the club beauty parlour is the friendly staff, always willing 

 to go out of their way to help us. It is the little things 

 that matter and for them, a service is never just a service. 

 This is definitely one of the biggest reasons that we club 

 members keep going back, instead of shifting to other happening 

 addresses,? reveals another salon regular.

 The big question now is, when? 

 The salon, Saturday Club officials say, will open its doors 

 by the ?end of May or the first week of June?. The timings 

 will be from 10 am to 6:30 pm, though some ?flexible timings 

 for me? cannot be ruled out, in true personal care style.

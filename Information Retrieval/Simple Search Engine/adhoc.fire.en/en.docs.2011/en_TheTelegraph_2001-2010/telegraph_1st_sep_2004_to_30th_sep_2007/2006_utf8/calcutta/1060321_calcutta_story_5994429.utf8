 You share your birthday with...

 Rani Mukherjee 

You?re very talented, loyal and averse to risks. You are giving and always ready to help; one of those whom relatives and friends swear by. You have an inherent charm that gets you favours without much effort. Avoid sycophants. Do one thing at a time; it increases your efficiency. ? Kusum Bhandari

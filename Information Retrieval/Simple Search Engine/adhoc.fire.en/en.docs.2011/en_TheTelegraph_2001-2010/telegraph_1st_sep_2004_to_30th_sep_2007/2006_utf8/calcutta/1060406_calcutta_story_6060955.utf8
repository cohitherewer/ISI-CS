 They are on a mission to usher in change in their locality. And with the help of a handful of Samaritans, they have managed to make a difference. 

 Seven young men and two young women ? some with MBA and MCA degrees, the others pursuing their education ? are running an NGO named Margam in the port area, with the aim of improving the socio-economic condition of the slum-dwellers.

 They teach the slum children free. They also collect donations to bear the educational expenses of 31 children in the age group of six to 13.

 ?Kidderpore is known for all the wrong reasons. People have preconceived notions about the place. We used to feel bad when our friends in college used to say only bad things about Kidderpore. So, in 2003, we formed a group and started teaching slum children,? says Chandak Sahu, co-founder of Margam. He has done an M.Sc from Calcutta University. 

 He blames the shift of business from the Calcutta port to Haldia for the problems of Kidderpore. ?A large number of people have become jobless. Many of them are poor and lead a hand-to-mouth existence. The number of drop-outs in the government-aided schools of the area is on the rise, as the parents cannot afford educational expenses?, explained Rimi Halder. She is an MBA. 

 ?When these drop-outs grow up, they take to smuggling and indulge in anti-social activities. They cannot be blamed, as they have to do something to survive. This is why we are focussing on the children,? added Rimi.

 According to another Margam member: ?All the students are first-generation learners. Our objective is to bring them into the mainstream. We make them take part in theatre. We believe they will be able to turn the tide.?

 Impressed with the work of Margam, several people have come forward to lend a helping hand. After an inquiry through the local police station, deputy inspector-general (cell) Sanjay Mukherjee agreed to sponsor the educational expenses of one child. 

 ?These young people are doing an excellent job. What impressed me most is that they help children. This is the correct approach,? he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Letters

 Through the year, you have wielded the pen in despair 

and delight, and spurred us ahead on the news trail. This selection of views, 

inventive and vitriolic, is a toast to you, the reader.

Teacher barred from using lipstick: In this 

age, when even men have started wearing make-up, it is quite strange that the 

headmistress of a girls? school in the city is not willing to let lady teachers 

wear lipstick in class (Saris or salwars, but no lipstick for teachers, January 

5).

Rabindranath Kar, 

Sankar Ghosh Lane.

Police pledge peace to couples: Apropos ?Pester 

police play cupid?, January 31, the harassment of couples by police at popular 

hangouts is not a new phenomenon. Thankfully, the practice is not as dangerous 

as letting heavy vehicles enter no-entry zones by taking bribes.

Chandan Ray, 

Sarsuna.

Student rusticated for half sleeves: The schools 

in the state should organise a fashion show every year to let the students and 

teachers know the sartorial preferences of the authorities (School under scan, 

February 3). 

Kanish Majumdar, 

Madan Chatterjee Lane.

Cloud over Metro expansion: In Hong Kong, Victoria 

and Kowloon Islands are connected by under-sea roads and tube rails (East-West 

route trip takes a U-turn, February 10). We hoped to get at least a Metro link 

in Calcutta passing under the Hooghly. Will at least a Salt Lake to Writers? Buildings 

link get the green signal?

A.K. Ghosh,

CIT Road.

Tortured husband attempts suicide: Apropos 

Husband in burning bid, March 1, women quite often, they take advantage 

of their gender and legal weapons like Section 498 to harass men.

Diptimoy Ghosh, 

Salt Lake.

Station home for woman: The life of Sandhya 

Pal is a shame on society (Driven by destiny, chasing elusive peace, 

April 1). I know of a widow who earns her livelihood by reciting poems aboard 

local trains. Hawkers frown if she boards a compartment as her recitation distracts 

their customers. Even educated, otherwise well-behaved customers make fun of her. 

The state government, however, conferred an award on this minstrel.

Debyani Basu,

Behala.

Court sends warring couple to Puri: Apropos 

Couple to stay together, May 3, parents should be held legally accountable 

for their role in breaking up their childrens marriage. 

Jayanta Kumar Dutt,

Beltola Road.

Aged queue up at post office from dawn: The 

state that has no qualms in squandering billions for space research fails to increase 

the staff strength of post offices, forcing senior citizens to queue up for hours 

from the break of dawn to collect interest from the monthly income scheme (Dawn 

vigil for the aged, May 13). 

Kajal Chatterjee, 

Sodepur.

No entry for umbrellas in park: Apropos ?Umbrellas 

barred in park?, May 24, what supposedly happens in those parks is constantly 

bombarded into our homes via the TV. 

Subhankar Mukherjee, 

Borehat, Burdwan.

Police crackdown on students: Apropos CPM 

seal for baton, June 14, being the former registrar of a government engineering 

college, I am sure the impasse could have been avoided if the administrators handled 

the situation rationally.

Jatindra Nath Mitra,

Kalyani.

Truck runs over cop: Apropos ?Truck mows down 

sergeant?, June 15, in Calcutta the man behind the wheels hate traffic sergeants. 

Perhaps Saha Mondal paid with his life for the corruption of his ilk.

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

Landmark takes a hit: Apropos ?Barge bang off 

course?, June 25, the owner of MV Moni might pay for the repair, but he 

cannot ever compensate for the wound he inflicted on the hearts of Calcuttans.

Purnima Vasudeva, 

Alipore.

Broken leg of mayor: Apropos the picture ?Mayor 

in repose?, June 23, all pedestrians risk their life and limb but such accidents 

get little publicity unless one happens to be mayoral candidate.

A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur.

Sarkar runs out of steam: I totally agree with 

the review of Sarkar (No myth, no magic, only factory finish, July 5). The disappointment 

of the public was evident from the movement of the share price Sarkars production 

company, K. Sera Sera Productions.

Subhankar Mukherjee, 

Borehat, Burdwan.

Round-the-clock retail: Apropos Shopping 

for 24x7 mall hours, August 2, people go to shops more often than police 

stations or hospitals. If they can remain open 24x7, why cant shops?

Tapan Pal, 

Batanagar.

Celebrity tease at City Centre: Apropos ?School 

boys held for eve-tease?, August 8, hundreds of women are teased in Calcutta every 

day by motorcycle-borne lumpens, but few show the courage to fight back. The media 

should publish the photographs of the eve teasers so that they can be socially 

censured. 

Biswajyoti Bagchi, 

Alipore.

 Pandal rule in revelry way: Apropos Mayor 

soft on park puja stalls, September 5, Durga puja is the biggest of the 

Bengali festivals and therefore, the rules for it might be relaxed a little.

Subrata Mitra, 

Address not given.

Walk to work, says transport minister: Apropos 

?Walk, says Subhas as bus, taxi slam brakes?, September 20, the fare structure 

is determined considering the sitting and standing capacity of buses and the assumption 

that each passenger travels a distance of 4 km. The commuters, however, are packed 

into overcrowded buses and often get off before 4 km. 

Jatindra Nath Bhowmick, 

Kalyani.

Dispute over dengue check: Apropos ?Mayor rues 

lack of support from NGOs in vector war?, September 15, had the mayor admitted 

the dengue problem earlier, may be more NGOs would have sprung to his aid. And 

the non-government agencies any day do a better job. 

Kamruddin Ahmed, 

Bandpur, Hooghly.

Dhaks decorated with feathers: Apropos Plumed 

drums beat death knell, October 1, the puja organisers can help stop this 

slaughter by refusing to employ dhakis who decorate their instrument with real 

plumes. Artificial feathers and pith decorations would look just as fine.

Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar.

Research at undergraduate level: Apropos Research 

for undergrads, October 21, opportunity of research from the undergraduate 

level will prepare the students for the rigours of higher education and put them 

on a par with counterparts in the West. Involvement in academics will keep them 

away from agitations.

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala.

Foul fumes of old vehicles: Apropos ?City trails 

in fuel switch?, November 7, it is disheartening that the chief minister is not 

as enthusiastic about cleaning up the city air as he is about attracting foreign 

investment and even reining in his party cadres. 

Sunil Banerjee, 

VIP Road.

Missing manhole covers: Apropos Cover 

thefts organised, December 1, the missing covers make their way back to 

the civic office, via contractors, from the stolen good markets of Bowbazar and 

Sealdah.

Abul Fateh Kamruddin, 

Chandbati.

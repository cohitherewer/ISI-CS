 In cinema, you have to let the script and the camera do everything. The moment you try to show? ? Rajat Kapoor springs to his feet and puffs up his chest, soldier-like ? it becomes Aamir Khan in Mangal Pandey. The faces, rapt in concentration in a semi-circle around him, melt into smiles of familiarity at the sight of the film-maker with a clean-shaven corporate look mimicking a nineteenth century mustachioed sepoy. 

 The bunch of 10 that forms the audience for the maker of Raghu Romeo and Mixed Doubles can appreciate the humour of the situation. They are not aspiring actors but cartoonists. The students and staff members of The Academy of Animation Arts amp; Technology had a sit-in with Rajat Kapoor, in town to act in a Bengali film, to explore acting and emoting in animation. 

 Explaining the power of the camera and the director, he draws on Pather Panchali. ?Everyone in Ray?s film is real. They may not be great actors but they have beautiful faces which Ray uses to create moments.? Moments differ from medium to medium. If in films an actor is ?not to show?, cartoons are all about exaggeration.

 But Kapoor has a pointer ? ?start with a real emotion and then exaggerate?. His next tip is the use of objects. ?Like this.? He lets drop an imaginary ball and manages to catch it in mid-air at an awkward angle. ?In films, we just do dialoguebaazi. There is no attempt to use objects.? 

 For the next query, however, he has to reach for an object-heavy moment in a film to make his point. A student wants tips on how to pass on information to the audience. Kapoor picks a scene in Satya where Makrand Deshpande and Saurabh Shukla speak while one of them tries to light a match. The character?s failure to do so at one go allows the director to pass on plot-related information through their conversation. ?Our situations are so cliched, uss mein samajhne ka hai hi kya! It is only we film-makers who think background information is vital,? shrugs Kapoor.

 The workshop had the FTII graduate effortlessly switching roles from actor to director. He draws a love triangle where the wife is trying to pack off the husband to office to clear the coast for the paramour. ?Think of the husband as a child whom his mother is dressing up for school,? he suggests, drawing peals of laughter. The next moment he becomes the boyfriend, peeping into the classroom, tiptoeing in and being startled by the door banging shut behind him. ?I am the boyfriend entering a jungle,? he adds.

 Settling down with coffee after the two-hour workshop, the former stage actor is all aglow about Konkona Sen Sharma who features in his just-released Mixed Doubles. ?She is choosing the right scripts rather than going for big banners, unlike our stars.? 

 That brings out his frustration with the course that Indian cinema is taking. ?We have lost three decades producing terrible films with the Jeetendras and the Govindas. Why did Mr Bachchan have to do films like Suryavansham and Lal Badshah??

 But if the screen is looking sleek today, that does not mean Bollywood has progressed from the 60s. ?Mother India had great camera work.? Though editing might have improved, India ranks nowhere in special effects. ?If we cannot make a Matrix, we cannot make a Spider-Man.? 

 But the local animation industry can take heart from the success of Hanuman.

 The students walked out on a confident note. ?We needed an outsider?s comment on our work,? smiled Biplab Chandra, who had screened his two-minute Manglu ki Kismat for the guest faculty.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Glamour sheen to gallop show

 The cup?s painstakingly crafted by the Queen?s jewellers, Garrard, and flown out of the UK through the diplomatic channel every year, from the time the Raja of Ramnad won the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Cup riding Gold Kale in 1953, and retains its dazzling sheen till date.

 Now, the nine-race card at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) with the Queen?s Cup as the icing, already special as only the second such event outside the British Isles, besides the one at Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, is set to gather fresh momentum, adding glamour to gallop.

 ?We are converting the Queen Elizabeth II Cup (on February 4) into an international race day, with city consular heads of seven different countries donating trophies for different races,? says RCTC steward Sujit Bhattacharyya. British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall will give away the gold-plated Queen?s Cup bearing Her Majesty?s insignia.

 Consuls-general of Germany and Thailand and honorary consuls of France, Switzerland, Chile, Portugal and The Philippines will be present on the occasion, along with captains of industry. A pre-event dinner on Friday, with ?a very British theme and d?cor?, will feature a string sextet from Calcutta School of Music playing Broadway hits and Nondon Bagchis Hip-Pocket belting out classic rock covers.

 ?The idea is to get people to the venue and highlight the fun and sporting elements, while downplaying the betting angle,? stresses Bhattacharyya. The race course recently played host to an evening of fusion jazz featuring Swedish bass virtuoso Jonas Hellborg and Tanmoy Bose.

 If the turf club has resorted to global glamour and melody mix to get the footfall flowing through the turnstiles again, the ?hundred guineas? Queen?s Cup itself carries a legacy laced with quaint Britishiana.

 ?Even now, we have to rush a telegram to Buckingham Palace immediately after the race, notifying the Queen about the winner and furnishing details of the race, and she wires a congratulatory message in reply,? says Boman Parakh, secretary, RCTC.

 Bhattacharyya feels the international race day could serve as a catalyst to marry this tradition with trade by drawing decision-makers to the course.

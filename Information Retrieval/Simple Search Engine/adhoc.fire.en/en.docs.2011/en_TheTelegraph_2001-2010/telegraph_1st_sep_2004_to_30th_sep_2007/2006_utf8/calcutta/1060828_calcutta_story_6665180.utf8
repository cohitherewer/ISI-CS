The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Smooth pathways for Durga puja

 CRATER COURSE: KD Mukherjee Road, in Behala, after 

a shower. A Telegraph picture

Somnath Chakraborty: Several roads in Behala have 

been dug up and are in a bad state. Waterlogging is also a big problem here. There 

are many big pujas in these areas and unless the work is completed near Parnasree, 

pandal-hoppers as well as the local residents will face great difficulties during 

the Pujas. 

 We are doing some temporary patchwork of the roads and I am hoping that you will not face any problems during the Pujas. In fact, plans are on the anvil of metalling these roads. But due to the rainy season, we cannot start work as bitumen cannot be laid properly. Our engineers have assured us that within six to seven months, the roads will be back in shape.

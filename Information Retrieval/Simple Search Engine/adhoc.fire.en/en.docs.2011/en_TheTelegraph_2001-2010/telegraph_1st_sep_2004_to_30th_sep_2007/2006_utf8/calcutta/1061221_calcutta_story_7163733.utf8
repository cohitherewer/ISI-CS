 Musical masterpiece

 Amelting pot of contemporary theatre practices, Nandikars 23rd National Theatre Festival provides an important platform for the development and dissemination of an enduring tradition of drama. To be presented this evening as part of the festival, Gokula Nirgamana is a richly lyrical dance-drama that fuses content and form flawlessly. It narrates a familiar episode from the Bhagavad Gita where a playful, adolescent Lord Krishna departs from Gokula leaving the villagers unhappy. Loved by one and all, the adventurous Krishna and Balarama and their cowherd friends, live in a world all their own. Akrura arrives in Gokula with a deceitful invitation from his maternal uncle Kansa, to take Krishna and Balarama to Mathura for an archery festival. As Krishna gets ready to leave, he flings his flute to the ground. A saddened Radha and her friends wish him victory and see him off. They pick up his flute and secure it inside a tree trunk where tender shoots are sprouting. Direction: B.V. Karanth.

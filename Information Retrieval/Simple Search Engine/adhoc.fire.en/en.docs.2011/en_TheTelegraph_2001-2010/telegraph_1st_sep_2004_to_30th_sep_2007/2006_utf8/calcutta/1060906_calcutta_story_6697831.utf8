 With Puja approaching, differences have surfaced between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the state forest department over illegal trimming of trees.

 While the civic body believes that the problem has been checked, the forest department is loath to agree. Officials of the department said tree trimming by puja committees has started, as in previous years.

 In 2001, puja committees had illegally felled about 2,000 trees across Calcutta, prompting a public interest litigation. According to statistics made available by the forest department, branches of about 8,000 to 10,000 trees in the city are unscientifically trimmed every year before the Puja.

 The trees are trimmed to instal decorative lights, to allow billboards to be visible and for free movement of idols. 

 Ruthless trimming of branches not only hampers the growth of trees, but also harms the ecological balance. If trees are trimmed unscientifically, they take three to four years to grow back to their previous heights. Hundreds of trees die in the process, said deputy conservator (urban forestry) Somnath Mukherjee.

 The civic body, however, does not want to go by the forest departments statistics. Officials claimed that unscientific trimming of trees has gone down in recent years. 

 The CMC has held a meeting with police and puja committees to familiarise them with the civic code regarding illegal trimming of trees.

 We have asked the puja committees to follow the guideline strictly. They should approach us for trimming of trees. Those who do not follow the guideline will be penalised, warned Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, mayoral council member (parks and gardens).

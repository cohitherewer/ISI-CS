 Rajnis suit set to resume

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The case of budding cricketer Rajnis Patel?s death will be taken up at the Alipore chief judicial magistrate?s court on Monday, after nearly two months.

 A witness attached to SSKM Hospital, where the teenager died, allegedly due to medical negligence, will be examined on Monday.

 Rajnis, 17, died on June 2, 2003, after five botched surgeries on his shinbone, which he had fractured on February 6 of the same year during a practice match. His parents charged five doctors with negligence.

 The trial of the case started within six months of the death but the inordinate delay in its disposal has since frustrated the family. 

 Rajnis?s father Manoj said: ?The rate of progress of the case suggests that it will take a long time for a verdict to be delivered. I was hoping justice would be dispensed swiftly.? 

 He added: ?Nearly three years have passed but out of 40 witnesses, less than a dozen have been examined. I will soon submit a plea for speedy trial in Calcutta High Court.?

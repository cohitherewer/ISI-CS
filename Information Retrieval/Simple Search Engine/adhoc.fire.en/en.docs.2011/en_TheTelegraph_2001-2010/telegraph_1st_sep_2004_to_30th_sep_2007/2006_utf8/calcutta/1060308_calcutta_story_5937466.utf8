 Panic epidemic in flu-free zone

 Today?s question: Is the drop in chicken consumption more panic than precaution? More responses will be published next week

 Distress call: A seller waits for customers in vain

 Santosh Chakravarty,

 The government and the media are responsible for creating confusion among the public on the issue of bird flu. Insecurity has prompted people to adopt precautionary measures. Even after the scientists have declared that there is no chance of contracting bird flu by consuming properly boiled egg or chicken, the majority continues to remain afraid. Panic and irrationality have overcome logic and intelligence.

 I do not think the drop in chicken consumption is more panic than precaution. Prevention is always better than cure. It is prudent to avoid any food item that might take a toll on health. Avoiding chicken is the need of the hour.

 Gauri Mitra,

 Given the possibility of avian flu, it is sensible to stop consumption of chicken. The risk of the disease is difficult to eliminate. Can the authorities give an assurance that the poultry in all parts of the state is being properly monitored? Can they guarantee a cure if the flu spreads to human beings? People have acted rationally, and not out of panic, by stopping consumption of chicken.

 Of course, panic has resulted in the drop in chicken consumption across the city. The fear can be dispelled only by the combined effort of the industry and the government.

 Detection of the avian flu virus in Maharashtra does not warrant a drop in chicken consumption in faraway Bengal. The reaction of the people is certainly more panic than precaution. Most people are not aware of the characteristics of the bird flu virus and what precautions they should take. Hence, the extreme reaction on their part.

 Proper breeding and precautionary measures are needed to prevent the spread of chicken flu.

 We all know that prevention is better than cure. In the absence of a potent vaccine and proper information, it is better to be cautious than brave. Having said that, the drop in chicken consumption is partly due to panic. However, there are also many who have made an informed choice. The media is responsible for confusion among the public.

 I feel that the drop in chicken consumption, though not totally illogical, is more due to panic than precaution. There is virtually no chance of contracting avian flu by consuming properly cooked chicken. Besides, the disease is still limited to a small area in Maharashtra.

 the mid-fifties, I lived in a small town in the interiors of the state. We had more than a dozen chickens in our backyard. One day, the majority of the birds died due to a mysterious disease. We ate the ones that survived without giving any thought to the nature of the disease. Ignorance was probably bliss for us.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 There can be no doubt that people are refusing to consume chicken due to panic. Those who are trying to be rational are becoming nervous due to the reaction of others. Lack of awareness and rumours are overshadowing scientific knowledge.

 Arjun Chaudhuri, 

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

 The drop in chicken consumption is certainly a precautionary measure, at least in eastern India, where there has been no report of the spread of the bird flu virus. It is certainly prudent not to consume chicken and egg as there is hardly any cure for the human version of the disease. In those parts of the country where bird flu has been reported, one can?t really blame the people for panicking.

 The drop in chicken consumption is more panic than precaution. Most people do not know much about avian influenza. Hence, everyone panics on hearing about the disease.

 Arpita Chowdhury,

 East Sinthi Road

 The drop in chicken consumption indicates that even educated people are susceptible to bouts of panic. No case of bird flu has been reported in our state and doctors are repeatedly assuring people that the virus cannot spread through consumption of cooked chicken, yet we are reacting blindly. The number of smokers would have decreased if the majority was genuinely cautious. 

 Tuli Das,

 Salt Lake

 No. Prevention is always better than cure. Most people are timid and cannot suddenly be expected to show daring in the matter of bird flu. The disease is not akin to a natural calamity and can be controlled through scientific methods. Vegetables and dairy products being as nutritious as chicken, it is better to avoid the latter.

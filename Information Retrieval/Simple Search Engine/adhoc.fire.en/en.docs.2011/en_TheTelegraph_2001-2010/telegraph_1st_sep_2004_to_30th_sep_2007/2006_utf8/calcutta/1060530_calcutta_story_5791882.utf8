 On any given morning, she can be spotted at the Moulali bus stand, poring over her books, a weather-beaten school bag on one side and a torn teddy bear (her only toy) on the other.

 For Tamina Khatoon, the bus stand is her world ? this is where she was born 10 years ago and this is where she has lived ever since.

 Tamina?s day starts at 6 am, helping out her mother with the household chores. Then, she sits down to prepare her lessons before leaving for Entally Hindu Balika Vidyamandir, on Convent Road. Back home at 3.30 pm, she has lunch and plays with other kids on the pavement. In the evening, she studies by the light of the bus stand.

 What sets Tamina apart from her pavement playmates is the dedication to her books and the desire to make her parents proud. Tamina?s father, Sheikh Raju, is a rickshaw-puller who struggles to earn Rs 100 a day. Her mother Mariam Bibi is a domestic help who brings home Rs 400 every month. This couple from North 24-Parganas made the bus stand their shelter and its rear end their kitchen.

 Driving them on is one dream ? their daughter?s education. ?Our parents did not have the means to educate us. So, we are lying here on a bus stop and struggling so hard to survive. We do not want our daughter to suffer the same fate. Education will help her live with her head held high. We have not been able to give her a normal house, but we are trying to provide for her education,? says Mariam.

 And Tamina is well aware of the responsibility on her frail shoulders. ?I love going to school and would never like to stop it. I know my parents have to pay Rs 275 as my school fees. I also know what they have to suffer to arrange for that money. I always want to perform well to see them happy,? she says.

 Having always lived in a bus stop, little Tamina does not know how living in a house would be. ?Maybe one day we will? but for now, I have my studies, my household work and my friends to keep me busy,? says Tamina.

 And her dream? To be a nurse.

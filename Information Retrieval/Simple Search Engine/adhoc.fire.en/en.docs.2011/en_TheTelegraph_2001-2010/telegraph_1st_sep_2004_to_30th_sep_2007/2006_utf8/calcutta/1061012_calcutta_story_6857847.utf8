The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diwali-eve crackdown on noisy crackers

 JAYANTA BASU

 The 

 state environment department on Wednesday decided to conduct 

 joint raids, along with Calcutta Police and the pollution 

 control board, to check the sale of crackers to combat noise 

 pollution during Kali puja, Diwali and Chhat puja. The raids 

 will be carried out from Thursday.

 Officials said similar raids last 

 year had led to the seizure of more than a lakh banned crackers 

 in the city and its fringes.

 Laying down the guidelines for 

 playing microphones and bursting crackers during the festival, 

 environment minister Mohanta Chatterjee admitted that the 

 cracker manufacturers do not follow the norms laid by the 

 government. 

 We have urged them to manufacture crackers that emit light rather than a loud report. The pollution control board is ready to help them. But our pleas have fallen on deaf ears, Chatterjee said after meeting top cops at Writers Buildings on Wednesday.

 Pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee said 11 teams would monitor the situation in the city during the festival days. The control rooms will remain open till midnight, where people can lodge their complaints on toll-free number 18003453390. 

 We will keep a vigil on the highrises 

 and other known trouble spots in Salt Lake, added Banerjee. 

 However, environmentalists feel 

 such norms and raids are of no usebefore the festival. 

 What is the point raiding the hideouts and shops just a 

 week before the festival? Cracker production is on for the 

 past few months in South and North 24-Parganas, Howrah and 

 Hooghly. No one can stop production, as it enjoys the backing 

 of political leaders, said an environmentalist.

 These raids will only mar the 

 business of small traders, rued a Pradesh Atashbaji Byabsayee 

 Samity member, who added that the local CPM leaders have 

 requested the police to adopt an easy line.

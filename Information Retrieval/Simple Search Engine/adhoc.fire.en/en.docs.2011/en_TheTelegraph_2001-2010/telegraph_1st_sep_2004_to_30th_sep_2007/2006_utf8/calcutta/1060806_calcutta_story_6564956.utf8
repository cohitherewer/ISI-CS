 What: Teachers Highnights. Where: The Oberoi 

 Grand.

 When: Friday, 8 pm onwards.

 Take a look: The evening started with a small introduction 

 of Teachers Achievement Awards, which picks success 

 stories from various walks of life like sport, communication, 

 business and the arts.

 Actor Boman Irani set the ball 

 rolling as he welcomed a full house at the Ballroom at the 

 Grand.

 Former cricketer and commentator 

 Krishnamachari Srikkanth spoke extensively about achievement 

 and achievers, interspersing his narrative with anecdotes 

 from the 1983 World Cup and other interesting cricket moments.

 Srikkanths admission that 

 Calcutta hero Sourav Ganguly has been the most successful 

 captain of Team India and the manner of his omission was 

 unjustified drew the loudest cheers from the 

 crowd.

 This was followed by a tete-a-tete 

 between the actor and the cricketer, which helped lighten 

 the mood.

 However, the best was saved for 

 the last. The show-stealer came right at the end when Boman 

 had the audience in splits with his now-famous Parsi jokes. 

 The performance came to an end with Bomans take on 

 We are the world. 

 Free-flowing cocktails and an 

 elaborate dinner spread wrapped up the evening.

 Also spotted: Cricket administrator Russi Jeejeebhoy, 

 football legend P.K. Banerjee, actor Arjun Chakraborty with 

 wife Nilanjana, singer Sandeep Vyas with wife Sanaya.

 Voiceover: At the Teachers Highnights, we 

 want to give something beyond entertainment to our guests. 

 The awards, to be held on November 25, are given to honour 

 achievers in every field, said Harish Moolchandani, 

 managing director, Beam Global Spirits and Wine (India).

 Lounge bash

 What: VIP Night.

 Where: Marrakesh, the lounge at Cinnamon.

 When: Wednesday night, 

 9.30 pm onwards.

 The bash: The 2,000 sq ft lounge was jam-packed as familiar 

 party faces of Calcutta jostled for space, some inside and 

 some even settling for leg space outside. The place on Park 

 Street was buzzing with excitement, showing clearly that 

 Calcutta was ready for yet another party address in the 

 heart of town.

 The bar was predictably the centre 

 of all attention with mixologist Irrfans concoctions 

 a big hit with the crowd. The Ginger Caprioska was a top 

 draw.

 Grapes and dates skewed on a toothpick 

 went well, as did the succulent kebabs.

 True to the name of the lounge, 

 the scent of cinnamon filled the air. The bar top and bare 

 nooks had rose petals sprinkled around quaint lamps and 

 candles. 

 The music by DJ Saranjeet was 

 mostly old dance numbers, keeping a section of the crowd 

 busy on the floor.

 Voiceover: The idea behind VIP night was to showcase 

 the beauty of Marrakesh to the party people of Calcutta, 

 said Amit Hathiramani, event manager.

 Salsa steps

 What: Vive La Salsa Roxy. 

 Where: Roxy at The Park. 

 When: Wednesday night, 9 pm onwards. 

 The bash: The salsa party kicked off with some nightclub 

 friendly merengue steps demonstrated by experts Aditya 

 Upadhyay and Shaneel Mukherjee. The half-hour crash course 

 gave way to Adityas students hotting up the floor 

 with sensual salsa and merengue moves. 

 Salsa expert Neeraj Mascara (who 

 also conducted a three-day salsa workshop atSolace, the 

 day spa in Sunny Park) then took over, flaunting freestyle 

 moves and partnering Shaneel and Satyaki. Next up was a 

 Rueda (the Cuban style of salsa danced in a circle) session. 

 A host of back-to-back performances followed. 

 Voiceover: The idea behind the salsa parties at 

 Roxy is to give patrons and salsa lovers a venue where they 

 can enjoy the fruits of their salsa lessons. And for the 

 salsa novice, Aditya himself will take you through the basic 

 steps to ensure you dance like a diva, said Namrata 

 Ray, manager, events and entertainment at The Park.

 Global beat

 What: Bacardi B-Live.

 Where: Rang Manch at Swabhumi.

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: It was almost a four-hour-long wait before 

 the real dhamaka began. Till about 10 pm, you had 

 only a handful of youngsters on the dance floor warming 

 up, a few men busy at the bar counter, and some couples 

 engaged in a quiet chit-chat.

 DJ Chicko set the mood early, 

 preparing the crowd for The Loose Cannons experience. Once 

 Loes Fader and Saucy Kaiser from The Loose Cannons took 

 control of the console, the night was hot and happening.

 They welcomed the audience with 

 a namaskar and soon Princess Pebbles and Sumi Gosset 

 of Ballerina from the Royal Ballet, London, joined the duo, 

 amid huge applause.

 To begin with, it was a rocking 

 jam session of Ballerina and The Loose Cannons. Princess 

 and Sumi mesmerised the audience with their swift turns, 

 fragile and graceful moves, completely in sync with a hip-hop 

 version of Shes a man eater belted out by Loes 

 and Saucy.

 Then it was a medley of hip-hop, 

 house, pop, rap and more. Adding to the fun were some fireworks 

 on stage. In between, DJ Chicko and DJ Rohit Barker kept 

 the party mood going.

 Also spotted: Cricketers Rohan Gavaskar and Deep Dasgupta, 

 actress Pallavi Chatterjee and actor Kaushik Ganguly. 

 Voiceover: It was great to be in Calcutta. We 

 loved the Victoria Memorial, smiled Loes and Saucy, 

 who will perform in Delhi next.

The truth about Thurman

 Having killed Bill and divorced Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman finds single life has all sorts of romantic possibilities. In a Manhattan hotel room, she sits hunched at the table, gleefully stuffing three bags of crisps. ?Oooh, hello,? says Thurman. ?Will you forgive me chewing through this thing??

 So much for the fabled body-obsessive women?s magazines being awash with Thurman dietary guff. ?The ice blonde. Tall, blue-eyed. It?s just a clich?,? she shrugs. ?Before Kill Bill, people would have said I was an ?ethereal actor?, never somebody who would run around with a sword. Now people ask me if it?s a problem that I?m thought of as such a tough person. To me, it?s absurd.? 

 Prime, her latest release, is Thurman?s first romantic comedy since The Truth About Cats amp; Dogs, 10 years ago. Its significance comes with the fact that it seems an uncanny case of art imitating life. In it, Thurman plays a fragile, divorced, 35-year-old New Yorker charged with taking her first tentative steps back into the dating pool, the joke being that she cops off with a toyboy, unwittingly the son of her shrink, overactive Jewish mama Meryl Streep. 

 ?Coming out of marriage in your mid-thirties, it?s an interesting place to be,? Thurman offers, especially now with her children, Maya (seven) and Roan (four), in tow. ?And so it kind of excited me to play with that in a movie.? She goes on a bit about being able to trust people again, all that sort of stuff. ?You know, I haven?t been single since I was 25,? she adds, ?and all of a sudden, you?re 35 and your life has taken a different turn.?

 There are few actors ? indeed, people ? with an upbringing as unusual as hers. She is the daughter of the renowned Buddhist academic Bob Thurman; her Swedish mother, Nena, is a leading psychotherapist (and former Vogue model). A wealthy childhood in Massachusetts was complete with home visits from the Dalai Lama and Richard Gere. Wasn?t it a bit weird? ?I think kids actually absorb their reality as if it would be everybody?s reality,? she muses. 

 In 1996, while making the sci-fi film Gattaca, Thurman met Hawke. Suddenly, she seemed settled. Pregnancy led to a 1998 marriage and children. But in summer 2003, while filming in Canada, Hawke was caught red-handed with a 22-year-old model. A nasty legal wrangle ensued over child access. But, she says, the anger has gone. ?I don?t think love ends, actually,? she adds. ?I wish it did, but I don?t think it really does. No matter how much I dislike them, I still love everybody I ever did love in my life.? 

 There is probably more here than meets the eye. Noticeably, the break-up came while Thurman was away in China for 10 months, working with Tarantino again, getting into tiptop chop-socky shape for the Kill Bill films. ?It?s what led to it,? is all she will say, issuing a rather enigmatic Mona Lisa smirk. 

 A rumour had it that she and the director were having an affair, but she is not going down that road. No two ways about it, though, she is certainly Tarantino?s muse. ?Sure, why not? I have been. What is a muse? It?s someone who helps you with your creativity. And I don?t think that?s unfair.?

 She was also co-creator of the character of the Bride, Kill Bill?s avenging angel. ?I don?t think I?ve gotten any royalties from that,? she laughs. ?I think I?m supposed to.? She should have a word with her collaborator. She will, she says. They are good pals. 

 Home for Thurman these days is in Hyde Park, a hamlet just north of New York City. Most of her time is preoccupied with her children. ?I wanted my kids to stay still, to try to get through this divorce,? she declares. 

 Her next film is predicted to be one of the big hits of the summer: Ivan ?Ghostbusters? Reitman?s My Super-Ex Girlfriend, playing opposite Luke Wilson a dumped, needy girlfriend who also happens to be a rather miffed superhero. Then again, with Thurman, you never know. ?You know how to make God laugh?? she says. ?Tell him your plans.?

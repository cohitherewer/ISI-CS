 Legends and shared legacies

 Krishnakali ami tarei 

 boli, kalo tarey bole gnyayer lok, dekhechhilem moynaparar 

 mathey, kalo meyer kalo horin chokh.... Tagore?s tribute 

 to his black beauty would find echo in a sonnet written 

 a couple of centuries ago in a distant continent. ?In the 

 old age black was not counted fair, Or if it were, it bore 

 not beauty?s name;?? Thus goes Shakespeare?s sonnet 127 

 to his dark lady.

 Come Saturday evening, St Xavier?s College auditorium will resonate with piano notes and vocal renditions of such thematic affinities between three poets born within two weeks of each other in different centuries. Former Xaverians Soumyojit Das, Sourendro Mullick and Moubani Sorcar will put up a musical show where Soumyojit will sing, Sourendro will play the piano and Moubani will do the recitation.

 ?There are uncanny similarities informing the thought behind many compositions of Tagore, Shakespeare and Wordsworth. In the course of our research, we have hit upon quite a few instances,? says Sourendro.

 Thus, Moubani?s recitation of one of Wordsworth?s Lucy poems tracing the departed girl in ?rocks and stones and trees? will be followed by Soumyojit?s rendition of Tumi robe nirobe hridoye momo by Tagore. The background pieces for piano, forming the prelude and interlude, have been chosen keeping in mind a synergy in tone.

 ?Tumi robe nirobe is in Raag Marubihar, which follows a similar progression to a sonata in C major one minor fluctuation,? Sourendro points out. Then there is their ode to the changelessness of love through lines in Shesher Kobita?s Kaler Jatra Pothey and Shakespeare?s Sonnet 116, where he denounces love that ?alters when it alternation finds?.

 ?We tend to restrict Tagore to a very Bengali circuit. The show aims to break free of that trend,? says the trio, practising hard for what is touted to be the college?s first commercial show with tickets up for sale. The second half of the evening will be Theatrecian?s production of Tagore?s Daakghar in English.

 Tagore, Shakespeare and 

 Wordsworth: Harmony tune

 Words? worth

 Some of the best debating skills from major colleges in Calcutta were put through their paces at the AIESEC Inter College Debate at St Xavier?s College on May 6.

 Participating colleges included St Xavier?s, Presidency, JU, Heritage Institute of Technology, JD Birla Institute, NUJS and Lady Brabourne. The topic was whether public opinion is a relevant factor in decision-making processes. Two representatives from each college argued for and against the motion.

 Charanpreet Singh, vice-president, Institute of Management Studies, was the moderator. Gautam Jatia, CEO of Landmark, counsellor Adil Mushid and Sanjay Chowdhury of Ernst amp; Young were on the judges? panel. At the end of each pair?s speeches, the judges cross-examined the debaters on their arguments.

 The influence on public opinion was examined from every angle, with the speakers using Nazi Germany to tales about donkeys and vegetarian tigers to illustrate their points. The judges assessed the performance of each individual and team on a broad basis, taking note of the communication skills and body language.

 Five prizes were up for grabs, including medals and trophies for the winner. The third place in the team prizes went to JU, with St Xavier?s emerging runner-up. The winner of the day was Presidency. The best speakers were Priyanka Jain and Surma Saha.

 The winners of the debate will attend the AIESEC Conclave in July, when all the regional winners will fight it out for the national crown.

Bard birthday

 A programme was held at Shakespeare Society of Eastern India (SSEI), on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the Bard, on April 24 and 25.

 In his inaugural address, chief guest Prof Sivnarayan Banerjee highlighted the multifaceted nature of Shakespeare. He explained how the writer-poet?s relevance is undiminished even today, transcending all geographical barriers.

 Students of Asutosh College, Scottish Church College, SSEI and CU then participated in a Shakespeare quiz. A team from St John?s Diocesan School performed portions from a few of Shakespeare?s plays. Parichay Patra of Scottish Church College discussed the South African responses to Shakespeare.

 The two-day session concluded with Prof Subir Dhar of Rabindra Bharati University giving an overview of magic in Shakespeare?s times, along with a live magic presentation.

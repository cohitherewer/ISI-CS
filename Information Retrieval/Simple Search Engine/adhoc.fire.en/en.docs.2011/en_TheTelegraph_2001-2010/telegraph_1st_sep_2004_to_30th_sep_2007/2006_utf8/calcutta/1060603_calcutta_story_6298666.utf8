 Where: The Raymond Shop at 18, Rabindra Sarani (in Poddar Court).

 When: Thursday.

 Take a look: After a bamboo collection of mens wear launched a few months ago, the newest offering from the house of Raymonds is a line of suit length made from soya bean fibre. While the formal launch of the soya bean fibre collection will take place sometime in July, the range is already available at select Raymond stores across eastern India.

 A breathable fabric made out of soya bean fibre has been combined with merino wool to lend lustre. The colour palette comprises soft pastels, dark browns and ice greys. Checks, stripes and plain, there is something to suit all tastes.

 The next innovation from Raymonds is a unique milk protein fibre collection. 

 The Color Plus range of shoes that were launched more than a week ago, is all about smart formal footwear. Made of leather, they come in hues of black and tan. From the moccasin to the pointed toe, anything could be your pick. Next in line is a range of Park Avenue sunglasses.

 Pocket pinch: Price of a suit length starts at Rs 6,500. The shoes come for Rs 4,495 upwards. 

 Voiceover: The fabric with its moisture absorption capacity is perfectly suitable for the Indian climate, both in summer and winter, said Piyush Pansari, proprietor of The Raymond Shop at Poddar Court.

 What: The Designers Destiny 2006, an exhibition presented by the interior design department of NIFD (now INIFD), Salt Lake.

 There was a dummy of a swank modular kitchen. The tiles, flooring and cabinets in hues of green made for striking effect. Also on show was a cheerful childrens room. Drawings with captions traced the history of furniture. 

 But the real showstealer was A Midnight Coffee Shop where a classroom was given a complete cafe makeover. Dim lighting, hanging bulbs, sleek chairs and tables, the ambience was just right for chit-chat over a cup of coffee. Ladies dressed as attendants, a menu and the terracotta cups with midnight coffee inscribed added to the real feel. A full moon and a guitar hung from the midnight blue wall.

 Glass paintings, oil paintings, sculptures and embroidered mats were up on sale. Corporates like Balaji Glass, Asahi India Glass and Daicin India attended a seminar during the exhibition. 

 Voiceover: Exhibitions like this offer real life exposure and boost confidence of the students, said S. Chowdhury, centre head, INIFD, Salt Lake.

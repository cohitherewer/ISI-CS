 As denim keeps getting hotter and hotter on Indian retail racks in its second coming, the city finally has a shop-stop to match its rising aspiration level, with the launch of the first Levis flagship store in the east on Dashami.

 The Original Levis Store at 19A Shakespeare Sarani, near the Camac Street crossing, joins a select band of national outlets of the brand which invented the denim, promising an international ambience to go with the merchandise.

 From the trademark brass-button replica as the doorknob to the extensive use of wood and wood-finish, TMT bars and copper rivets, display walls and illumination patterns, and the bright red entry signage the flagship outlet boasts many firsts.

 This store will carry the maximum number of Red Loops and 501s (both premium Levis styles) plus the latest straight and boot-cuts (511s and 517s) and L530s, with a flared fit, declares Vijay Dugar of franchisee CS Trade Link.

 This is also the first time the Workers range of Levis has come to east India. Targeted at the young working class (18 to 30), the range is funkier, more fashion-oriented and can be worn to office.

 The girls section will stock the latest Diva collection endorsed by Sushmita Sen and will have a separate Red Loop section. 

 To ensure privacy, it will be separated by beaded curtains, and have a dressing table for a personalised feel, adds Dugar.

 The History Wall featuring photographs and artefacts tracing the evolution of denim since 1873 is another novelty, as is the signage, done from the Levis international template and approved by designers in Singapore.

 Each mannequin tells a story from the miner to the cowboy, officegoer to hip college student with retail props like basketball hoop, softboard, roller skates and ropes adding to the in-store atmosphere, Dugar says.

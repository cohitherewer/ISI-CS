 An institute for visual and performing arts, Swar Sangam was founded with the aim of providing a platform to aspiring talents to venture into the rich world of Indian art and culture. To mark its 40th anniversary, it has taken an initiative to take the cause of the arts to the less privileged sections of society. An art workshop hosted by Swar Sangam, in which the needy children of Disha participated, has identified three among them who will be imparted formal training by the institute. Their works have also been put on display at its ongoing 40th annual exhibition, showcasing the paintings of its 350 students. Expressing their creativity in a wide variety of media ranging from pastel and watercolour to tempera and gouache, the students have portrayed landscapes, portraits, flora and fauna with an innocence and simplicity that appeal directly to the emotions.

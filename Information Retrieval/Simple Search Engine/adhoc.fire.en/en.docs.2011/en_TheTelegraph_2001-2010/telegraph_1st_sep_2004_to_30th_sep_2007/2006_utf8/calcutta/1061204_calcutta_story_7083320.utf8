Life

 You cant 

 get through this week without

 Spotting Britneys flash of flesh

 Oops! She did it! Who else but Britney? Close on the heels 

 of Fed-ex, the blonde pop singer went clubbing with her 

 new-found friend, hotel heiress Paris Hilton. And look who 

 got the most out of it! Neither Britney nor Paris, but the 

 paparazzi that got grabs of the diva in a tweeny-weeny micro 

 mini, a neckline-plunging, cleavage-baring top and, of course, 

 no underwear. And its all over the world TV, Internet, 

 newspapers, mobile phones. With this act, Spears joins the 

 famous flash frat of stars like Mariah Carey, Lil 

 Kim, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan to reveal their you 

 know what to public scrutiny. What next, Britney?

 Watching Baabul

 If your eyes are hurting with all the high-octane action 

 antics in Casino Royale and D:2, its 

 time to go back to good ol Indian traditions and values. 

 This Friday, Ravi Chopra takes you inside the big Indian 

 family, where the father-in-law becomes the father for the 

 bride. You have many other reasons to watch Baabul 

 John Abraham, Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Rani Mukherjee 

 and Hema Malini. And in that order?

 Special status for college

 - Presidency autonomy on fast track, to state discomfiture

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The University Grants Commission (UGC) decision to exempt Presidency College from certain mandatory requirements for seeking autonomy has caught the state government on the wrong foot. 

 The Left Front has so far stalled the autonomy-grant process of the college. 

 By virtue of the special status granted to it by the UGC, Presidency will not need to be evaluated by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) for seeking autonomy.

 St Xavier?s College (NAAC-accredited) is currently on the last leg of the autonomy-grant process. It is likely to be declared the first autonomous undergraduate institution in the state by February-end.

 The CPM is opposed to two policies of the Centre relating to higher education ? NAAC evaluation of Presidency and 16 other undergraduate colleges controlled by the state government, and grant of autonomy to these institutions.

 According to officials in the education department, the opposition has manifested itself in the form of delaying the NAAC evaluation of the 17 colleges, mandatory for the institutions to become autonomous. The UGC decision will, however, compel the state government to take a clear stand on the issue.

 ?Presidency College has a glorious past and a record of producing brilliant graduates, who are holding positions of power all over the world. At a recent meeting, we have decided to exempt Presidency and other institutions of its stature from requiring NAAC accreditation to seek autonomous status,? stated V.N. Raja Sekharan Pillai, acting chairman of the UGC.

 The state government has now been requested to apply for Presidency?s autonomy after the decision is finalised. 

 ?We are prepared to complete the formalities ? like a spot inspection of the institution ? as soon as the government submits an application seeking the college?s autonomy,? Pillai added.

 The government is against NAAC evaluation on the grounds that government-controlled institutions maintain high standards and do not need central evaluation.

 However, after months of persuasion by teachers of Presidency, who strongly want the NAAC to evaluate the college, the state government finally appealed on its behalf for the council?s accreditation. 

 A team from NAAC is scheduled to visit Presidency on February 4 and 5.

 Senior government officials denied receiving any information from the UGC regarding the exemption granted to Presidency.

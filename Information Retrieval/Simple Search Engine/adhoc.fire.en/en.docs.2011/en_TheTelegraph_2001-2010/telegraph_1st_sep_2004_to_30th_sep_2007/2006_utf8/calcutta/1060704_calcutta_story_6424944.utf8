 Block development officers, NGOs working in distant villages and other rural organisations may no longer need to run to SDO offices, or even to the city, every time they face a problem or need information.

 Come August, a state-wide audio and video conferencing network will be launched by the panchayat and rural development department and Roopkala Kendro. Lending technical assistance to the Rs 6-crore project is Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and Bharat Electric Limited (BEL). 

 The video-conferencing network will be used for three hours, five days a week, by the panchayat department. At other times, the facility will be available on hire for other government departments and private agencies.

 The network may usher in major changes in disaster management, health, education and other areas, say officials.

 ?A digital uplink earth station at Roopkala Kendro, in Salt Lake, will, with the help of an Isro satellite, communicate with 24 two-way audio and two-way video conference centres and 341 one-way video and two-way audio centres across the state. This will make it possible to reach the benefits of development policies to the farthest corners of the state,? explained Sanjoy Mukhopadhyay, director and CEO, Roopkala Kendro.

 The Isro-piloted facility has been existing for some time in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka.

 The initial cost of installation may be high, warned Mukhopadhyay. A little over Rs 3 crore will be needed only to convert the Roopkala studio into the digital mode and turn it into a suitable learning room, and transmission and reception centre.

 But finance is not likely to be a problem, as the project ranks high on the state government?s priority list. Besides, the antenna and the hub have been sponsored and installed by Isro, while BEL has supplied TV monitors.

 Among the centres chosen for the project are Institute of Panchayat and Rural Development (Kalyani), extension training centres in Raigunj, Cooch Behar, Burdwan and Rajarhat, seven zilla parishads and the Siliguri Mohokuma Parishad. 

 M.N. Roy, principal secretary in the panchayat and rural development department, chairs the steering committee for the project. The state, he said, will bear the bulk of the cost, while some assistance will come from the Centre and a few British investors. 

 Orientation and training programmes will be held soon. Trials begin in July and transmission starts from mid-August. What is needed, according to Mukhopadhyay, is the development of more easy-to-use software.

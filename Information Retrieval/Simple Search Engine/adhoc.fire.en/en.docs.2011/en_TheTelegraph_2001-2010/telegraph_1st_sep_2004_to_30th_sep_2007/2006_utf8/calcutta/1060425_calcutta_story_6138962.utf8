The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Al Pacino You live in extremes ? either 

 the best or nothing at all. You are frank, outspoken and 

 proud of your accomplishments. You are a self-made person 

 and know how to use your talents. You are intelligent, with 

 a sharp memory. You like things your way. You have a short 

 temper and dislike being challenged. ? Kusum Bhandari

 Merc scouts out at Jadavpur

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Mercedes-Benz is ready to roll into Jadavpur University. Daimler Chrysler, the German automobile giant, has come scouting for engineering graduates on campus and is also working on a plan to join hands with the university for research projects.

 Daimler Chrysler is looking for talent from premier academic institutes in India and Jadavpur University is one of the them, confirmed Prince Anuraag Mishra of Watson and Wyatt, consultants hired by the Stuttgart-headquartered company.

 Daimler Chryslers interest is a big boost for Brand Jadavpur University as till now, the company has not looked beyond the Indian institutes of technology and the Indian institutes of management.

 The fact that Daimler Chrysler is interested in Jadavpur is very encouraging, said Siddhartha Bhattacharyya, officer, placement and training.

 A team from Watson Wyatt visited the campus recently to collect information on academic standards and overall functioning at the university.

 As part of the survey, a 15-page form was distributed among engineering students to collect information on salary expectations, preferred employers and career goals.

 We are collecting the relevant data. Now, it is up to the company (Daimler Chrysler) to take the final decision, said Mishra, from Mumbai.

 Not just the makers of Mercedes-Benz, auto majors like Ford, Tata Motors, Maruti Udyog and Ashoke Leyland are the flavour of the season at the campus interviews this year.

 We are noticing an increasing demand among the big players in the automobile industry to recruit our students on campus, said university registrar Rajat Banerjee.

 According to information available with the placement office, Maruti Udyog recruited 10 students through campus interviews this year, up from two last year. Before 2005, the company never came to our campus, said Bhattacharya.

 In a departure from the past, the placement office has received requests for computer science and electronics engineering graduates and not just students from the mechanical stream, as was the norm for automobile companies.

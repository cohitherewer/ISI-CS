 Well afloat: Stacy Ferguson 

 aka Fergie

 She?s known for her singing skills but the Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy Ferguson aka Fergie is on the big screen this week as Gloria in the disaster film Poseidon. And she didn?t exactly have the cleanest of times shooting for the Wolfgang Petersen film.

 Dwarfed by a massive, ransacked, topsy-turvy ballroom, the 30-year-old singer-turned-actress was sporting some bloody gashes and bruises for her role. Add to that she was completely soaked. ?I?ve got this dirt going on here and it?s the first time I?ve been all bloody and gashed up, and I like it,? said Fergie. 

 In the film, Fergie?s love interest is the captain of the ship, Michael Bradford, played by Andre Braugher. ?Our back story is we have a special kind of secret relationship going on. So, I?m in a lot of scenes with him. I also get to do my first real bit of dramatic acting, which is good,? she added.

 After Poseidon, Fergie will be seen in Grind House. The film is split into two 75-minute horror movies directed by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.

 Now, that sure is something to crow ? and croon about. 

 Malay magic: Suniel Shetty at the 

 GIFA launch

 After its inaugural edition in Dubai last year, the Global Indian Film Awards (GIFA) will be held in August-September this year in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor, the minister of tourism of Malaysia, officially launched the second edition of the awards in Sri Satria, Putrajaya, a couple of weeks ago in the presence of GIFA promoter Suniel Shetty.

 This year?s event kicks off on August 31, with the world premiere of a Bollywood blockbuster. The next morning, there will be a soccer match between Indian cine-stars and Malaysian ministers. In the evening, a fashion show and charity dinner will be held, featuring some of India?s top models and designers.

 On the final day of the three-day extravaganza, there will be a charity brunch hosted in aid of less fortunate children in presence of the Bollywood hot shots. Later in the evening, the awards would be given out, followed by a cocktail-dinner. The awards will be presented in 25 categories with five nominees for each category. 

 The entire show will be scripted, produced and directed by Shetty?s Popcorn Entertainment.

 Targeting the burgeoning mobile entertainment market in the country, STAR India has announced a slew of initiatives to enhance its STAR 7827 offering. In its new avatar, STAR 7827 will expand its services from television-focused interactivity to create, distribute and market content through tie-ups with Indian and international companies to eventually provide the largest collection of cutting-edge mobile content.

 The STAR 7827 website www.star7827.com has been completely redesigned to reflect this new push in content aggregation. A WAP site for mobile Internet users has also been created from where visitors will soon be able to access an exciting range of mobile content including videos.

 Speaking about the new initiatives, Sameer Nair, CEO of Star Entertainment, said: ?STAR 7827 will be one of the key focus areas of our business and is expected to contribute significantly to our revenues over the next five years.?

 Apart from its exclusive content from the STAR bouquet, STAR 7827 has also aggregated licensed content to offer popular mobile services like exclusive ringtones, astrology predictions from Bejan Daruwalla, jokes and other mobile games. 

 As part of its market strategy, STAR 7827 will launch a series of TV campaigns revolving around a quirky South Indian character Muthuswamy, played by south Indian star Chinni Jayanth.

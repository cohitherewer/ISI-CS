The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Action, as big as it gets

 Tonight?s the night. And if you?re in no mood to root for Zizou all by yourself, there are options aplenty to catch the kick-off on the big screen.

 Starting down south, the action will be on Screen 2 of Fame (Hiland Park) multiplex. ?The response has been average at Fame so far but we expect a full house for the final,? said Rahul Merchant, sales head for Shringar Cinemas.

 In comparison, Fame?s Mumbai property has done well, where, though the semi-final screening had to be cancelled due to rain, occupancy rates of the previous games were around ?60-70 per cent?.

 Special treats for the Fame (Hiland Park) viewers on Sunday night include alcohol and food combos on the menu, with the multiplex all decked up, promised Merchant.

 Official broadcasters ESPN STAR Sports (ESS) has tied up with multi and single screens like INOX (both Forum and City Centre), Priya, lounge bars like Virgose, Starstruck and Venom and hotels like Stadel. ?There are a lot of requests for permission to show the matches on the big screen. Football is such a game that people want to watch it with friends rather than alone at home,? offered an ESS spokesperson.

 Those planning to go big on the big night couldn?t agree more. ?Our gang is planning to go to Venom to watch the match on the big screen. It is not possible to watch it at home with all the friends,? said banker Arup Ray.

 ?I am a big Shisha fan and I am planning to watch the match at the lounge bar. Soccer is all about cheering your favourite team and jumping and shouting whenever a goal is scored. Shisha is the perfect place for that because I will be joined by my gang,? added entrepreneur Richa Srimal.

 Coca-Cola, too, has lined up some big-screen offerings for city soccer fans. The official sponsor of the World Cup since 1978 is showing the final at Nazrul Mancha with an ?unlimited supply? of Coke through the match.

 It has also tied up with 30 restaurants across the city. ?The objective is to provide an opportunity to dine out with the family and still catch the match,? said Inderjit Singh, general manager (franchise operations). The eateries have been done up with footballs, flags and jerseys of participating countries and replicas of the World Cup trophy.

 Airtel, a national mobile partner for the World Cup, kicked off its big-screen activities with the Argentina-Germany quarter-final in Salt Lake?s BJ block. The company?s tableau travelled across the city ? from Salt Lake to Moulali, Beleghata to Bijoygarh and Howrah to Bagbazar ? halting at various paras and housing complexes.

 ?For the Brazil match, screened at Moulali, we had around 700 people. About 350 supporters watched the Italy-Germany clash at Beleghata. The crowd consists mostly of youngsters. The number of women is significant,? said an Airtel spokesperson.

 The final halt for the mobile van will be Kumartuli on Sunday night.

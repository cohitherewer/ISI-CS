Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 You should face the north or east while 

 studying. Also, ensure that you are not studying in 

 the north-west of your room. This area has a lot of 

 movement and affects the stability and concentration 

 of the mind, not letting anyone study long hours at 

 a stretch

 Q: 

 I am a science student of Class XII. 

 I will be appearing for my Board examinations and various 

 entrance tests in 2007. My birth date is 14.1.1989. The 

 basic problem with me is that I cannot concentrate and put 

 in long hours of study. Please help me so that I can do 

 well in my exams.

 Sneha Shroff 

 The Solution:Your pillars of destiny reveal that you are a weak wood person. Presently you are going through the water period, which is strengthening your weak wood element. This should make you successful in all your entrance exams and you should do extremely well in future.

 Your concentration is being disturbed because your animal sign, Dragon, is in clash with the Dog that is in power this year. Do not worry because this is a temporary phase and can be taken care of by keeping a picture of a rabbit on your study table.

 You should face the north or east 

 while studying. Also, please ensure that you are not studying 

 in the north-west of your room. This area has lot of movement 

 and affects the stability and concentration of the mind, 

 not allowing anyone to study for long hours.

 Q: 

 I am planning to paint some stars, the 

 moon, the planets and comets on the ceiling of my bedroom 

 that will glow at night. Please advise if I should do so 

 or not.

 Rakesh

 The Solution: There 

 is no harm in what you are planning to do because Feng Shui 

 believes in trinity luck, and this includes luck from heaven, 

 human and earth. The painted moon, stars and planets will 

 provide you with heavenly luck. The floor gives you earth 

 luck. And when you will sleep on the bed, between these 

 two, you will be in perfect harmony with nature.

 Q: 

 I want to sell off my present house 

 because I have taken another flat and keeping the old one 

 will be a waste of money. We have had a number of people 

 coming to see the house since December. They have all expressed 

 an interest, but somehow things have not progressed beyond 

 this. We are desperately looking for a buyer. The entrance 

 to this flat is on the north-east and there is a bathroom 

 as you enter. Please suggest how we can be successful in 

 selling the house.

 Chinkiee

 The Solution: No one approves of a house that has a bathroom in the north-east. To set this right, place a mirror on the outside of the toilet door, and keep both the door and the pots lid closed when not in use. 

 Keep a glass bowl filled with salt till the brim. You can also have a straight, growing plant put on the window sill to absorb the negativity created by the toilet, which is otherwise a pious area. Remove any heavy object like heavy furniture or artefacts from the extreme south-west corner of the house as this area gives stability to the house and its residents.

 You can also try placing the five elements of nature ? metal, wood, earth, water and fire ? in the north-west. This can be done by taking a small metal spoon from the kitchen, a piece of wood from your house and some soil from the potted plant. Wrap them together in a blue paper, tie it with a red ribbon, meditate and then visualise your house being sold. Then place it in the north-west corner.

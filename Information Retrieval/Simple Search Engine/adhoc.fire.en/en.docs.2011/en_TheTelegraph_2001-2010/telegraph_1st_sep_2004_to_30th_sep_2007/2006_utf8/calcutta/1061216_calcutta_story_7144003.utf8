 Grades blur entry rules at colleges

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The evaluation for the school-leaving examination will be in grades, not marks, but no one quite knows how the admission process in colleges will work out next summer.

 With the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary (HS) Education yet to inform the universities about replacing the earlier system of total marks and divisions with grades from HS 2007, a cloud of confusion shrouds the admission procedure in undergraduate colleges.

 Time is ticking away, with just over six months to go, but Calcutta University (CU) and all its affiliated colleges are in a fix over revising the criteria for students seeking admissions to the 2007-08 session.

 Mention of total marks or aggregate on a students marksheet has always been the most critical admission criteria. We need to totally change our guidelines for admission to undergraduate courses if the marksheets of HS examinees do not mention their total marks, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor for academic affairs of CU.

 We have not been able to start the process as we need to get an official confirmation from the HS council about the changes they have introduced. We cannot change our guidelines on the basis of newspaper reports, added Das.

 Things are no better at Jadavpur University. We are also waiting for a confirmation from the HS council about the switch from marks to grades. Only when we get such an official notice will we start introducing the changes in the admission process, said registrar Rajat Banerjee.

 Debasish Sarkar, secretary of the HS council, admitted that no official confirmation had been sent out. We have to follow a certain procedure in sending such official notification. For instance, there has to be a gazette notification about the changes. Most of the formalities are over now and we hope to inform the universities about the changes within the next few days, Sarkar added.

 University officials said revising the admission guidelines would be a complex and time-consuming process and so it must start as soon as possible. 

 We need to examine several factors before finalising the new guidelines, pointed out a member of CUs undergraduate council.

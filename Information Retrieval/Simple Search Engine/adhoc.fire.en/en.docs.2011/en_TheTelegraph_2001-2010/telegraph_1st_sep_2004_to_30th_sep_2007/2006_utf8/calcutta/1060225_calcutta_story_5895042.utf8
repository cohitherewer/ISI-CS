 What?s on your mind this week

 Free but fair

 Censorship is one of the most sensitive of all issues. A recent example of censorship followed by the Indian press is its decision to not republish the cartoons of Prophet Mohammad that had appeared in a Danish newspaper. More than censorship, the decision reflects the respect our papers have for journalistic values. A point can be made in more ways than one. Our newspapers have, thankfully, understood that.

 Put in the words of a journalist working with a reputed organisation, ?every society has its taboos and has to respect its taboos and those of its neighbour?. The publishing of the cartoons in September 2005 by Jyllands-Posten, and other papers republishing them, are perfect examples of how freedom of the press can be misused, with life-threatening repercussions for thousands across the globe.

 However, violent protests in the UK, France, Turkey, Denmark, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries are not justified. The Prophet preached peace, austerity and brotherhood and if the protesters respect these values, they should react in a more peaceful and convincing manner.

 United in protest

 Images broadcast recently on the Australian Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) showed how US forces had cruelly treated prisoners in the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in 2004. Since the visuals this time were more gory than those before, the outrage triggered amongst Muslims was expectedly greater.

 Photographs of prisoners being kept under inhumane conditions and tortured severely clearly suggest that there is more to what has so far been brought to light. 

 The administration has appealed against the decision of freedom of information, fearing the pictures would fuel anti-American sentiments.

 But I feel the pictures should be publicised. What is wrong is wrong, and there?s no point in keeping the issue under wraps. Only public pressure will force the authorities to bring more transparency to the methods of treating war prisoners.

 The US can no longer claim that the crimes are isolated incidents and the handiwork of low-rung army guards acting on their own initiative.

 Youth all across the world, including in the US, should come out in full force to protest the misdeeds. 

 The issue is no longer nationality-specific. People all across the world have to come together to fight crimes against humanity.

 Up in smoke

 The Indian government?s appeal to the film industry to stop glorifying smoking on the big screen has to be taken with a pinch of salt.

 Smoking is not only a health hazard, but also a social menace. To prevent people from lighting up, the anti-smoking campaign has to be stronger and treated on a par with other health awareness campaigns by the government in various media. Agreed that movies are a powerful medium of mass communication and can influence people, but not necessarily as much as to motivate one to take up the bad habit.

 The government should take the risk of becoming unpopular in the short run and implement its ban on smoking in public places more stringently. An even better measure would be an apparently-dictatorial measure of stopping the manufacture, sale and consumption of tobacco in certain pockets of the country. But then, given the condition of the Indian economy, especially in terms of employment generation for unskilled and semi-skilled labourers, that would, perhaps, not be feasible.

 The Diary

 Salutation

 An open road as I walk towards destiny,

 Or rather what I think it?d be.

 Memories of a fonder tomorrow ?

 For the past had ruined that night?

 Of grief and sorrow ?

 As we part I know 

 Shall blow the winds of change 

 As they push through empty bamboo spaces, 

 right out of a whirlpool 

 as currents of mutiny blow past 

 and sorrowful agony slips by 

 before I get the better of it. 

 Mercy, be upon those who fought 

 Until the harm was undone?

 Seedling

 You?re all that I am

 I wish I knew you so I could know me

 I can cry, I can hurt

 I can grow old; just like you

 I give myself to you

 I ignore all that?s real and true

 In you I grew a life I know as me

 I?m sorry, I?m sorry

 In you I grew a life to be me

 selfless you to please selfish me

 the pain notwithstanding,

 You are my only joy, my only peace

 How long have I lived through you

 forever me and never you...

 Knack for numbers

 About 950 students from UCMAS centres from across the state battled their wits in a competition at St Xavier?s auditorium on January 29.

 In UCMAS, children aged four to 12 years are taught unique computing skills using the abacus and arithmetic.

 A special 12-member team had come down from UCMAS Chennai to ensure that the competition was fair. The best centre award was jointly won by Nutty Netters and Brain-o-vita. 

 The championship awards went to Rishi Baid (fifth level), Radhika Chamaria (fifth level) and Aditya Agarwal (sixth level) of Nutty Netters. The best course instructor prize was won by Jyoti Gondi of the same centre.

 Adieu to school

 Loreto House bid its Class XII (batch 2005-06) adieu on February 11. The day started with the captains giving up their flags and badges. This was followed by the prize distribution ceremony and a prayer service. 

 The farewell social saw the students of Class XII looking their best in traditional attires. Songs and dances, including Bhangra, Latino and jazz numbers, kept the spirits high. The on-stage action was followed by refreshments for all.

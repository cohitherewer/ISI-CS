The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 LRT finds moneybags

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The firms shortlisted for executing the Rs 2,400-crore Light Rail Transit project on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis have refused to chip in with funds, prompting the government to scout for other partners.

 And the wait was not long. Two companies ? Konkan-Essar and SREI ? have expressed their willingness to carry out the chief minister?s pet project on a BOT basis.

 Officials from the Konkan-Essar group, a joint venture between the Konkan Railways and Essar Construction, met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday and said they were ready to shoulder the financial liabilities of the project.

 The firm proposes to introduce a sky bus ? a two-compartment, tram-like vehicle that will accommodate 300 passengers and run under an elevated track. The upper part of the track can be used as pedestrian pathway.

 SREI, while expressing willingness to fund the project, said it would like to introduce a high-speed tram that runs on technology developed by Germany-based Siemens. The chief secretary himself had called up the SREI office on July 31 to know details of their proposal.

 ?Both companies are ready to take up the project on a BOT basis. We will take a decision soon,? Deb told Metro on Thursday.

 The government had earlier shortlisted two companies ? Siemens and Amex International ? for executing the project. 

 ?But they were not interested in the BOT format. They were ready to provide technology, but would not open their purse. So, we were searching for a company that would take up the project with all its financial liabilities,? Deb said.

 nBomb hoax: A man, identifying himself as Prem, called the Indian Institute of Science and Management on Thursday morning and said a bomb was planted on the Salt Lake campus. A search, however, drew a blank. 

 nAccused held: Abhishek Shaw, the absconding member of the gang of five that tried to kidnap IT professional Surojit Sikder from near his office in Salt Lake?s Sector V on Tuesday evening, was arrested on Wednesday night.

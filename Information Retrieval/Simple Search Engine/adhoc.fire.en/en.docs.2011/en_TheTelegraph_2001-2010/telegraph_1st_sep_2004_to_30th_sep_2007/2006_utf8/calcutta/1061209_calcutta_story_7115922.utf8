 Chandi The Great TTIS Challenge took off at Swabhumi 

 on December 7 with 123 participating schools. 

 Enthusiasm was naturally at a peak on Day One. First up on stage were some winners of last years fest. Krosswindz added adrenaline with renditions of Brian Adams Summer of 69, Hotel California, and their signature number, Prithibi.

 Event number one 3 Minutes to Fame was an instant hit with its dance and comic routines. Boogie Woogie contestant Rupam Gupta of Don Bosco Liluah bettered his moonwalk routine from the prelims. Upalabdhi Kanoria of Loreto Convent Entally danced to Chal Ja Re Hat Natkhat from the film Navrang. Pallavi Bhowmick of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Barrackpore (Army), presented a three-minute package including excerpts from Joy Goswamis poetry, Tagores Raktakarabi, mimicry and kathak. One had to agree with Nabil Mamsa of St Josephs College when he said variety was what made this the most popular event at the TTIS carnival.

 The serious issue of child rights was the topic for the Creative Writing Contest in which many participated. But the winter sun was aglow and one found it hard to choose from the many fun things to do, like a treasure hunt, a two-minutes-to-fame stall, a handwriting competition, hula hoops, mobile games and lucky draws.

 Gift of the gab and originality were what the judges were looking for in the War of the RJs. Yuvraj Dasguptas Radio 420 drew guffaws with its tagline only nautanki all day. Judges pretending to be callers of a live show challenged the young RJs with irate questions, only to be impressed by their panache. Saroni Chakravarti of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ballygunge, said: It was fun. I performed in front of my favourite radio jockeys.

 In Laughter Challenge, Calcutta Boys High School presented Koffee with Krissh, a spoof of popular television chat show. Delhi Public School Newtown changed the Sholay locale to Calcutta and Methodist School did a comic Ramayana.

 Eastern Solo Vocal contestant Sreosree Bhattacharya from Agrasain Balika Siksha Sadan sang an Asha Bhonsle number from the film Kaajal while Aishwarya Shankar of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Ballygunge, present a bhajan.

 Day Two of the carnival had four events. Six groups presented skits in the Street Play contest. Students of St Augustines Day school Shyamnagar wearing black costumes addressed health issues.

 The Bey Blade contest was a huge draw, with prizes at each level. It is the first time that I am taking part in the contest. I enjoyed it, said Md Arshad Khan of St Laetitias School.

 Cartoon drawing contest brought the Singur controversy to the fore. Subarna Saha of Agrasain Balika Vidyalaya said she had drawn Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister and a Tata honcho.

 Antakshari got even the teachers jiving. Unconventional Orchestra created music from buckets, computer keyboards, vases and paintbrushes.

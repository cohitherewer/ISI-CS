The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Comedy king minus the stamp

 Ready with another laugh riot, director Priyadarshan tells Pratim D. Gupta why Malamaal Weekly is different and why he can?t choose between Paresh and Puri

 Moments from Malamaal Weekly

 Is Malamaal Weekly in line with your series of crazy comedies like Hungama and Hulchul?

 Not really. You see, Malamaal Weekly is the most realistic comedy I have ever made. Usually in comedies you have fake situations that are exaggerated to force laughter. But here, none of the situations are fake and also all the characters that you see in the film, you must have met him or her somewhere in real life. I also don?t have the regular hero-heroine in the movie, just a few characters. There are also no loud songs. Malamaal Weekly is ultimately about a good story.

 But this time you don?t have any stars in your cast...

 That?s my only insecurity about the film. If Malamaal Weekly works, I don?t have to go looking for stars anymore (laughs). I am very positive about the film?s screenplay, I am sure no one is going to look for a star in the movie.

 So, what is Malamaal Weekly all about?

 It?s about a poor village in Madhya Pradesh which is starving and doesn?t even get proper water. One of the villagers wins a lottery and all the residents now want to steal that money. So, the biggest plus point of Malamaal Weekly is that everyone is a villain in the movie. Then the film goes on to trace these people, how they steal the money and how they manage to escape. All to save the village?

 Is it a satire on our failed economy?

 It is very much a comedy but yes, if you take the comic moments out of Malamaal Weekly, it is almost like a Tapan Sinha film.

 Tell us a little bit about the casting process for the film?

 I wanted really good actors for all the characters. The ensemble cast that I finally got together is a bunch of experienced theatre actors. Apart from Riteish, everyone comes from stage. Malamaal Weekly is a showcase that Indian actors are very good at humour. The two trump cards are, of course, Paresh Rawal and Om Puri. It was a pleasure to see them almost in competition to prove who is better in the film.

 As the director of the film, who do you feel is better?

 When both of them put in their best effort, it is difficult to say who is better. At least I get very confused.

 Priyadarshan

You have done all kinds of movies but only your comedies have worked at the box-office while films like Kyon Ki? have failed. Do you think you have got typecast in Bollywood?

 Don?t worry, my next two films are not comedies. I have decided that I do not want the comedy stamp on my head. So after Malaamal Weekly, there?s Chup Chup Ke, a romantic movie with Shahid Kapur, Kareena Kapoor and Neha Dhupia. After that I am planning to start a film on anti-piracy. It should be the first film in the world against piracy. We keep talking about piracy, but the common man has no idea what it is amounting to. He keeps on buying pirated music and movies. I plan to make this film with only newcomers.

 Everyone is being distributed a Malamaal Weekly lottery ticket. Will your lucky streak continue with this comedy?

 After making so many films I have realised that promotion is as important to a film as the making. So, I have given complete liberty to my producers to market my films the way they want. So, you have lottery tickets being distributed to make the people come to the theatres to watch the movie. It is a good ploy since I don?t have any crowd-puller in the film. But I am confident once the audiences are in the theatre, they will enjoy Malamaal Weekly.

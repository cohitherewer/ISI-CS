 Traffick trail of HIV

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 The link between trafficking and India?s HIV problem is not one that is embedded in the public consciousness yet. 

 To change that, the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society recently hosted a workshop by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on ?trafficking and HIV/AIDS?.

 Spread over three days from July 25, the objective of the workshop was to muster support in the fight against HIV/AIDS and trafficking.

 UNDP consultant Ravi Pradhan stressed the need for tackling both trafficking and HIV/AIDS in West Bengal. ?Awareness has to be improved, otherwise India faces a very real risk of having an Africa-style pandemic.?

 He added: ?Places like West Bengal and Kerala are not only trafficking sources, but also destinations and transit points. Worryingly, the vast majority of Indian HIV/AIDS sufferers are heterosexual and unaware that they are infected.?

 The workshop is a follow-up on an exercise in January this year to address the same issue. Currently, six states are involved in the programme, including Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are about to become a part of the group.

 New Delhi-based Human Development Resource Network (HRDN) is helping in the implementation of the programme. Saraswathi Gopala Rao of HRDN said: ?We want the Indians to be able to tackle these issues without outside help. Police and NGO interface is very important.?

 Varsha Chanda, who participated in the workshop, was encouraged by what was achieved. ?The next step is for people to put into practice what they have learnt,? she observed.

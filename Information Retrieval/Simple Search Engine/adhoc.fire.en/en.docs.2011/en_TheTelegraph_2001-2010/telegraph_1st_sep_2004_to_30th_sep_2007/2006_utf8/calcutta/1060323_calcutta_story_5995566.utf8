 Stunted splendour

 Bonsai breathes life 

 into your interiors and also boasts therapeutic powers. Shradha 

 Agarwal tells you how to nurture the plant 

 HOUSE 

 PROUD

 Bonsai, the ancient art form, 

 is the amalgamation of two Japanese words ? bon 

 (tray) and sai (planting). Bonsai, a thing of 

 beauty on your windowsill, not only breathes life into your 

 interiors but like most other forms of gardening, boasts 

 amazing therapeutic powers.

 From picking the plant to the 

 pot, from re-potting it every year to designing your own 

 little landscape in the pot, it is truly a form of art. 

 Heres the GoodLife guide for beginners on the 

 bonsai path.

 Plant pick

 Choosing the right plant is most 

 important, says bonsai expert and landscape artist Sonali 

 Roy Chowdhury. Bonsai deals with only shrubs and trees, 

 clarifies Sonali.

 After picking the plant, it is 

 necessary to cut out the taproot and also the excess roots. 

 Dipping it in an anti-fungal solution is a sensible thing 

 to do before planting it in the pot.

 The next step is to prepare the 

 three grades of soil ? base, medium and top ? that a bonsai 

 needs.

 Here is Sonalis recipe for 

 the perfect soil concoction: Mix equal parts of garden 

 soil, broken bricks and dried dung manure. Pass this mixture 

 through the sieve. What remains in the sieve is the base 

 soil and medium soil is what passes through. Repeat the 

 process. What finally passes through is the fine top soil 

 and the remains are used as medium soil.

 Pot process

 The potting procedure might come 

 across as a little complicated but it is all about following 

 a few simple steps.

 Avid gardener Shanti Agarwal feels 

 that choosing the right pot is half the bonsai battle won.

 The pot should ideally not 

 be deeper than three to four inches. Choose anything from 

 China to terracotta, something that complements both the 

 plant as well as your home interiors, she advises.

 While small details like holes 

 or stands for the pot help in draining out excess water, 

 care must be taken to nurture the aesthetic aspect as well.

 The pot holes should then be covered 

 with a nylon mesh and then stitched up with a string.

 Put a layer of the base 

 soil, followed by a layer of the top soil and then place 

 the plant. Make sure it is standing firm and then tie it 

 up with the string that seals the pot holes, says 

 Sonali.

 Pack the plant with the rest of 

 the medium soil and then cover with fine topsoil. Immerse 

 two-third of the plant in a tub full of water and keep it 

 there till the surface is moist, she adds.

 Like life-size trees, bonsai, 

 too, never grows in a straight line. So always remember 

 to plant it a little off-centre if the pot is square or 

 rectangular, with the plant at an angle, says Sonali. 

 If the pot is circular the plant can be potted near the 

 centre.

 so, take care to introduce the 

 plant to sunlight slowly. Keep it in the shade for 

 a while and expose it to partial sunlight. Top sun should 

 come in the picture only in the second week, adds 

 Sonali.

 Then acclimatise it to the sunniest 

 part of your home ?the windowsill, usually, is the best 

 location.

 After care

 The right pot is chosen and the 

 plant suns itself happily on the windowsill. But thats 

 not all the care and nourishment that your little one needs. 

 Sonali suggests you water your bonsai after taking into 

 account the current rate of evaporation of water and the 

 size of the plant.

 Immersion of the bonsai 

 is not necessary each time. You can simply dip it in a bucket 

 of water and lift it up when bubbles appear. Complete the 

 process by reapplying some top soil, she says. 

 As far as the feed is concerned, 

 sticking to organic food in a cycle of two to four weeks 

 is recommended. Flowering and fruiting plants require 

 a higher dose of phosphorus and potassium while green plants 

 need more nitrogen, explains Sonali. A small pinch 

 at the edge of the plant is adequate. 

 Pruning and pinching of your bonsai 

 is also essential to lend a healthy, groomed look. Shape 

 the branches using special bonsai scissors. Pruning 

 and pinching go a long way in inducing growth.

 The most important after care 

 is the regular dose of pesticide and insecticide. This 

 is necessary even if the plant is not attacked by pests. 

 Make your own concoction by boiling one tobacco leaf or 

 a bunch of neem leaves in a litre of water. Spray the extract 

 once a month, instructs Sonali.

 Repotting a young 

 bonsai is done every year in spring, but older plants that 

 dont grow enough newer roots can be touched after 

 a gap of three or four years. Repotting follows the 

 same process as potting, Sonali reveals.

 Design detail 

 Designing a bonsai should also 

 follow some basic guidelines. Most unexpected little things, 

 picked up from anywhere, have the ability to add aesthetic 

 appeal to the bonsai.

 Shanti suggests that you keep 

 your eyes open for any detail that can add value. Marble 

 chips from shops, sand and shells from a beach and debris 

 from a construction site are great details, besides small 

 rocks, pebbles and stones, she says.

 Build a theme around one main 

 tree or shrub and use lots of colourful flowering plants 

 around. You can also set up a waterbody or a hut, maybe 

 even a colony of huts. But keep one thing in mind: 

 recreate the landscape of a particular region by incorporating 

 the trees of that region alone. A pine tree will look out 

 of place in a Bengal set-up as will a banyan in a mountainous 

 landscape, cautions Sonali.

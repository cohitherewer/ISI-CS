 Junior doctors at SSKM Hospital went on strike on Thursday to protest the quota proposal, while their counterparts in other hospitals continued ceasework, affecting hospital services.

 The Calcutta chapter of Youth for Equality, an organisation of doctors protesting the Centre?s decision to hike reservation in higher education, will hold a rally in the city on Saturday. It will start from Medical College and Hospital at 2 pm and end at Shahid Minar.

 ?We will seek an appointment with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee,? said Kaustav Das Biswas, house-staff at the general medicine department of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital and a member of Youth for Equality. 

 ?We do not want to inconvenience patients. But the government is not paying heed. It is indirectly responsible for the patients? plight,? he added.

 There were long queues at the outpatient departments of Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, and R. Ahmed Dental College and Hospital. Few operations were performed. ?They asked me to come some other day,? cried Debeswar Sau of Barrackpore, who had come to SSKM Hospital with acute kidney trouble.

 Protest against the anti-quota activists also made its presence felt. The All India Students? Association organised a torch rally from College Square. ?The anti-quota protest is creating bad blood against the backward classes. It must stop,? said Moloy Tiwari, association secretary.

 A delegation of medical students of All India Democratic Students? Organisation met the principal secretary to the chief minister on Thursday.

 Suicide in hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man suffering from lung cancer committed suicide inside a toilet at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital early on Friday. 

 Sudhir Chandra Sarkar, 45, a resident of Kanchrapara, in North 24-Parganas, hanged himself inside the toilet of the hospitals chest department. The patient had been suffering from lung cancer for long. This led to severe depression and consequently, he committed suicide, said Krishnangshu Roy, the hospitals medical superintendent. 

 Sarkars mother, Pataka Debi, alleged that negligence on the part of the nursing staff and the indifference of doctors was at the root of her sons depression. However, no complaint was lodged with the hospital authorities.

 According to officers, Sarkar committed suicide early on Friday. A patient of the chest department went to the toilet around 4 am and found him hanging from the ceiling. He had committed suicide a little before 4 am, said an officer of the hospital.

 Sarkar, who stayed near Bager More in Kanchrapara, was admitted to RG Kar Hospital on July 8. He was on bed number 14. According to his mother, Sarkar had been suffering from lung cancer for over a year and was admitted to hospital after his condition deteriorated. The cancer was in a pretty advanced stage and this had probably caused his frustration, the hospital superintendent said. 

 The nurses did not look after my son. Even the doctors did not take his case seriously, his mother alleged. Sarkar has a 16-year-old son and a younger daughter. We had to mortgage our house for his treatment, his mother added.

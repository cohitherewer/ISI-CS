 Shift at pollution board top

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 In an unprecedented move, Prabir Banerjee, member secretary of the state pollution control board (PCB), the administrative head of the watchdog, was replaced last week by the environment departments chief environment officer Debal Roy. 

 Banerjee is inexperienced. He even took policy decisions without consulting PCB board members. So, we have replaced him with a senior Indian Forest Service official, stated environment secretary M.L. Meena.

 In his two-month stint as the member secretary, Banerjee took a number of decisions that did not go down well with the boards top brass. But last weeks order, to close down PCBs Howrah office, sealed his fate. The decision to create new circle-offices and order transfer of senior officials compounded the problem. 

 PCB had set up an office in Howrah earlier this year to cater to the needs of the units in the area and also to keep a tab on their activities. We have cancelled his order regarding shutdown of the Howrah office, creation of circle offices and mass transfer of key officials, added Meena. 

 PCB sources indicated that some senior officials were not happy with Banerjees work and brought the matter to the notice of the board chairman and the environment secretary. He had passed an order asking everybody to leave office by 5.30 pm The work in the PCB laboratory was suffering because of this, explained an official. 

 The environment lobby peeved at the recent scrapping of public hearing at the boards office and growing influence of the realtors in decision making has blamed the government for its unprofessional handling of the board.

 If your office is somewhere on or around Central Avenue and you want to dig into succulent Mutton Pasinda or savour Chicken Biryani during your lunch break, you now have a new address to head to. 

 Rahmania, the restaurant on Park Circus famous for its Mughlai delicacies, has opened its ninth outlet at 34, CR Avenue. The outlet opposite the Indian Airlines building also delivers food to offices in the area.

 From Mutton Shammi Kebab to Chicken Korma, the 35-cover outlet will be dishing out all the items Rahmania is popular for. In this locality, we are going to cater to the office crowd that is always looking for variety during lunchtime. Now they will be able to savour our famous biryanis and pasinda, says owner K.P. Md Sharif. 

 There is also a sizeable chunk of residential customers staying in and around College Street who we would be catering to, he adds.

 Besides the meal-time delicacies, there is an array of rolls catering to the flying customers. The restaurant is open for all from noon till 10 pm every day.

 Like all other Rahmania outlets, the production is centralised with the cooking being done in the Park Circus kitchen. The food is then transported to the other outlets. Keeping in mind our guest profile, we have to be extra careful with the way our food is prepared. For example, our cooking medium is white oil and we avoid unnecessary spices, explains Sharif.

 In five years, the restaurant chain has opened nine outlets in prime locations throughout the city.

 We plan to open two-three more outlets. We want to build a network that will cater to each and every Calcuttan in every part of the city. Even now we cover most parts of the city because we have a presence almost everywhere, says Sharif.

 Next Stop: Calcutta Greens, Survey Park, off the EM Bypass.

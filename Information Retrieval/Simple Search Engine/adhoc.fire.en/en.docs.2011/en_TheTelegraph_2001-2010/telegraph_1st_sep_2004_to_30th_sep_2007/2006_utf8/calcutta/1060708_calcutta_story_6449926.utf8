The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court prod on temple mess

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Kalighat temple: Zero upkeep. A Telegraph picture

Calcutta High Court on Friday asked the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to report within three weeks how it plans to spend a corpus of Rs 6 crore that the Centre has allocated for the upkeep of the Kalighat temple.

 The Centre had sanctioned the amount for the development of the temple and its surrounding areas, and the CMC was entrusted with the job. It was decided that the state, too, would make a matching grant.

 Apart from the temple renovation, the money was to have been spent on building a hospital, a rest house and charitable institutions on the shrine premises.

 But the fund remains unutilised following a difference of opinion between the temple committee and the CMC. According to the agreement, it will have to be refunded if work does not start by July 31.

 The bench, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya, also expressed concern at the way the temple funds are being misused by the sebayets. 

 ?We are surprised to know that the sebayets open pranami boxes and collect the entire the amount. Who is allowing this?? the judges wondered.

 They ordered the South 24-Parganas district judge, who is ex-officio chairman of the temple committee, to immediately appoint someone who will be responsible for keeping the temple premises clean, so pilgrims can enter the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) unhindered.

 The order followed a public interest litigation by Prahlad Goenka, a devotee, who has complained of financial irregularities by the sebayets. He has also alleged that the temple?s account has not been audited for the past 15 years.

 The chief justice remarked that he had a bitter experience during his last visit to the temple. ?No one is bothered about keeping the premises clean.?

 The petitioner suggested that the South 24-Parganas district magistrate, Bengal Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta University and religious organisations be involved to look after the financial and other affairs of the temple.

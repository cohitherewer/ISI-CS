 Bank cash missing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bundles of currency notes, adding up to Rs 3 lakh, went missing from the cabin of a cashier of an Andhra Bank branch in the Exide crossing on Wednesday morning.

 This was the fourth incident of money going missing from the bank in the past year.

 Police are clueless about Wednesday?s theft. ?The employees, including the cashier, failed to provide any leads that could help us nail the culprit,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 According to police, the theft took place around 10.30 am, half an hour after the bank opened. 

 ?Cashier Tapan Chatterjee was in his cabin and a number of bundles were kept behind his chair. The cabin was enclosed with a grille that has a single entry-exit point, behind the chair,? said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station, where a complaint has been lodged.

 Chatterjee told police that moments before the theft was detected, he was talking to two customers through the grille window.

 ?The two were asking me questions regarding some investments. They continued talking for at least 10 minutes,? he told police.

 The officers also grilled two other employees who sit close to Chatterjee?s cabin.

 ?They said that one person came to them and asked some irrelevant questions. But they could not recall the queries,? said deputy commissioner Singh.

 According to Chatterjee, he noticed the theft a few minutes after the duo left. ?Some bundles of Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes had been kept in the cabin. While counting the notes, he found a few bundles missing,? said an officer working on the case.

 Singh, however, pointed out that it was almost impossible for the two customers who had engaged the cashier for 10 minutes to lift the bundles.

 ?If anyone wanted to enter the cabin, he would have to pass through rows of employees. Chatterjee?s colleagues could not recall as having seen anyone walk past them and enter the cabin,? he said.

 The sleuths have not ruled out an insider?s hand in the theft. ?We?re interrogating the employees thoroughly,? said an officer.

 ?Three cases of theft have been reported from the bank, on the first floor of the building that houses Haldiram,? said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

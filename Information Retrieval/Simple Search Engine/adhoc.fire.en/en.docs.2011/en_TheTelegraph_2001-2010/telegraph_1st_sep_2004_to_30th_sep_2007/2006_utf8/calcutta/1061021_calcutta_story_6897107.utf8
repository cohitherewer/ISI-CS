The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Remake makes the fans troop in

 Dancing in the aisles got a new meaning at midnight on Thursday, when members of the audience at the special paid preview of Don in Priya took the stage. 

 As Shah Rukh Khan gave Khaike paan Banaraswala a new look on screen, his fans did their own thing, their swivelling silhouettes punctuating Saroj Khans steps.

 Just like Fanaa, standalone screens registered a screaming return with Don. From the opening shot of Shah Rukh slipping on his shades in a Paris bistro near Eiffel Tower to the final shot in Malaysia where he declares himself The King, Calcutta gave a defeaning welcome to the new Don.

 Despite its slick look and feel, Don, with its nostalgia, all the old and loveable characters and the legendary dialogues, is more of a mass film, says Priya owner Arijit Dutta. Typical of a remake, the crowds know most of the songs and situations beforehand and that adds to the buzz inside the theatre.

 Don was no less a draw at the multiplexes on Friday, though less defeaning. After Lage Raho Munnabhai, this is the second film this year where the usually restrained plex people cheered and clapped, reported Prashant Shrivastava, vice-president of 89 Cinemas (Swabhumi).

 Before the plexes unveiled the Farhan Akhtar remake, the Shah Rukh Khan Fan Club took to the streets of north Calcutta to make the first day first show a noisy affair. 

 Black T-shirts, leather jackets, sunglasses and green head bands they didnt exactly look like the cool sophisticated killer whose poster they were carrying but with their band baja and horse chariots, they sure made a splash.

 If the club premises near Scottish Church College was their starting point, Star theatre was their destination. We are here for the first show, said Arnab Roy, secretary of the Shah Rukh Fan Club. Don is an old film remade and Star theatre is an old hall revamped...

 Still, the Don dhamaka has not been able to silence the other Diwali release, Jaan-e-Mann. The Salman-Preity-Akshay love triangle has opened strong at the plexes as the obvious second choice.

 Says Subhashish Ganguly, general manager of INOX (City Centre): The dark horse often goes on to be the bigger hit... Don will definitely be the winner in the first week, but Jaan-e-Man should be in for a long run.

 But then taking on Don was never going to be easy in the Diwali weekend, because as Shah Rukh says: Dons enemys biggest mistake is being Dons enemy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Book Fair should not be a carnival of cacophony. More than a thousand people live, bathe, cook and answer the call of nature here for weeks before the fair starts. To curb this ravaging of the city?s lungs, it is imperative to keep the number of stalls at the fair to the minimum. Therefore it makes sense to do away with stalls of every other product than books. There should only be a shelter for fire-fighting arrangements and an office for the organisers. Those who want to enjoy a food feast at the Book Fair would surely not mind moving a few kilometres away to the Bypass. Once the Book Fair shifts there, the organisers are welcome to put up any product for sale.

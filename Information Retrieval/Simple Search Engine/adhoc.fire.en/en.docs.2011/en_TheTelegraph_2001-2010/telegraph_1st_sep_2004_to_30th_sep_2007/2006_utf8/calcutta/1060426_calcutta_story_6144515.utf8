The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Quiet guest, very decent 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Simple shirt, simple trousers and a pair of slip-ons.

 Sher Singh Rana?s attire was as modest as his demeanour, at least to the staff who served him at Hotel Blue Moon, in central Calcutta.

 Rana, who had allegedly pulled the trigger on Phoolan Devi, had been absconding since his escape from Tihar jail in 2004. He had been in the city hotel since April 9, except for a five-day interlude.

 The staff of the hotel, who had no clue about Rana?s antecedents, described him as a ?perfect gentleman?, one who kept to himself and exchanged smiles on his way in and out. 

 Having stayed at Blue Moon for 11 days, he had even picked up the names of some of the staff members, but would never enter into a conversation with them.

 ?No one came to meet him while he was at the hotel. Innocent-looking and clean-shaven, there was no reason for anyone to suspect that he was a criminal,? said Sarfaraz Khan, son of the hotel-owner Jalil Khan.

 Only one thing about Joy Tirkey, the name Rana had assumed, had piqued the curiosity of the staff: he stepped out every time he had to make a call, even though there was an STD/ISD counter on the same floor of the hotel. 

 ?Rana would usually go out around 5.30 in the evening and return about four hours later, after having his dinner. On a handful of occasions, he told us he was stepping out to make STD calls. We told him that there was a booth on the same floor but he ignored us. We left him to his ways,? recounted a hotel worker.

 Rana had checked into the hotel around 2.35 in the afternoon on April 9. He gave his father?s name as Peter Tirkey. The address he wrote on the register is vague: Raj Mansion, near Hinu Bridge, Ranchi.

 In the column seeking his profession, he wrote ?for visa work?. 

 Six days later, on April 15, he left the city around 6 in the morning. 

 Rana returned on April 20, carrying a small bag. This time, he did not write his address or the purpose for which he was in the city. He, however, opted for the same room ? a non-AC, 80-sq-ft chamber with an attached bath. The tariff was Rs 200 per day. 

 On Monday, he stepped out around 5.30 in the evening and did not return. ?Around 10.30 am on Tuesday, four officers of Delhi police went to his room and took away his luggage,? stated Golam Khan, who works in the hotel.

 Another girl missing

 BY A STAFF REPORTER

 Sedna Ali: A call to disappear

 While police failed to make any breakthrough in the mysterious disappearance of three Class X girl students since January 16, another city girl, 15-year-old Moni Roy, is missing for the past four days from the Burtola area. 

 According to the complaint lodged by the girl?s mother Rita Roy with Burtola police station, her daughter was abducted from the doorstep of their Imam Baks Lane residence on January 18. Police have not been able to find anyone who witnessed the abduction and feel the girl left home on her own.

 Anxious relatives of two of the three girls lost for the past seven days are pointing fingers at each other now.

 Sedna Ali, Shreyashi Talukdar and Swagata Das are residents of Topsia and Sodepur, respectively. While Sedna is a student of The Academy in the Park Street area, the other two are classmates at Pratt Memorial School. The three families have neither received any ransom call nor any message from the missing trio.

 ?Sedna had received a telephone call from Shreyashi around 8 pm on January 15. The next day, she left home around 8.30 am. That was the last time we saw her,? said Sahid Ali, Sedna?s father, at their Orient Row residence, under Topsia police station. Sahid claimed his daughter was kidnapped and ?I am ready for any eventuality?.

 ?We are not sure that Shreyashi called Sedna. There is a telephone at home and Shreyashi may or may not have called Sedna. Maybe Sedna called her up instead. How can Sahid Ali be so sure of it? He was reluctant to go to police when we requested him after the girls went missing,? countered Prabir Talukdar, Shreyashi?s father, at their School Road residence at Sodepur, under Ghola police station. 

 Swagata?s uncle Ashim Das said at his home in Lokenath Bose Garden Lane, under Topsia police station, that he had taken the missing girl and two of her cousins to school that day. 

 ?But later I learnt she didn?t write the examination scheduled for that day,? he said. This was corroborated by Somasree Kundu, a classmate and neighbour of Shreyashi?s.

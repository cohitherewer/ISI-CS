 SHAUN KENWORTHY

 Aqua, the poolside lounge at The Park in Delhi

Im going to go off in a different direction just for this week. I had a couple of days in Delhi last week, with one of my partners, (business). We were looking to pick up some stuff for a restaurant that we are working on at the moment. 

 It was quite late by the time we checked into our hotel. By the time we freshened up, almost every place was closed, so we decided to go and check out Aqua at The Park. Unfortunately, it was closed for a private party so we ate at Mist, the coffee shop at The Park. It was almost midnight by then, so we shared a kebab platter, had a couple of beers and headed back to the hotel for some sleep.

 Most of the day was filled with meetings, with no time for proper lunch, so we grabbed a quick bite and made plans for the evening. Its been a couple of years since I last went to Olive and I wanted my partner to check out the place because I think it is one of the best places in Delhi and well worth the drive, too.

 Its a converted haveli with fantastic use of space, white-washed candlelit walls, a bar and a fantastic outdoor dining area, perfect for this time of the year. It gives you a feeling that you are in Greece or somewhere. There were five of us. We had a couple of glasses of wine, shared a pizza and a Caesar salad. Then we set off to find Tonino, another restaurant in the area, suggested by a friend.

 On the same lines as Olive restaurant, outdoor area, bar, but this time, traditionally Italian Tonino has terracotta outdoor areas and a very traditional indoor, Italian opera and all. 

 The place was relatively empty. We had some more wine and decided go back to last nights original destination Aqua, the place that everyone is going on about. It was relatively quiet when we reached around 10.30 pm. A cool space, it almost resembles a posh resort in Koh Samui, rather than a five-star in the middle of Delhi. 

 A nice lounging feel, with small booths all around the pool, some with love swings and others with low seating. A DJ played lounge music that started to raise the tempo slowly as 1 clock came closer and more and more good looking people started to arrive. 

 By this time we were even more glasses of wine further in and it was far too late to eat a heavy dinner. We ordered a couple of sandwiches and a side of fries and sluggishly headed off back to the hotel to bed.

 Thursday morning arrived far too soon and after a couple of paracetamols and a heavy breakfast, we headed off to our meetings. We rushed to finish as soon as possible. We had a lunch appointment to keep for 1.30 with Marryam, a journalist friend I hadnt met for a couple of years. A restaurant of her choice, Ploof in Lodhi Colony, one I wasnt familiar with, but a great choice anyway. In the middle of a load of government housing sparkled this gem. The menu was somewhat of a fusion, east Asian/Mediterranean, with an emphasis on seafood. 

 For starters we shared a Thai Seafood Salad, Satay-style Prawns with a Cucumber Peanut Relish and a Smoked Salmon Salad. For the mains, Grilled Teriyaki-style Salmon with Asparagus and Sweet Potato, a simple Grilled Trout and a miserably overcooked Grilled Tuna dish with Truffle Mash Potato. We chatted about restaurants and people in India and London. 

 We then said our goodbyes and with a couple of hours to spare before the airport, we went to a delicatessen called Steakhouse where Ive not been to for at least three years. Again, close to Lodhi Road, this place is another gem. 

 It is the only place in the country that sells and tries to promote Indian cheeses and locally made salamis and sausages. I bought a bagful of Mountain Gouda, a smoked cheese from Delhi, Maharashtrian Taleggio and cheddar from Kalimpong. A fabulous place that any serious foodie should seek out, though expensive. I couldnt believe how the prices in these restaurants have changed in the past couple of years. At this level, you are looking at around Rs 1,200-1,500 per head without wine. (There is hope for us restaurateurs yet)

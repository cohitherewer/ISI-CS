 Quake cry, reality check

 - Comprehensive study ahead on steps to combat calamity

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 With the central department of science and technology sounding an earthquake alert for Calcutta and its surrounding areas, the state government has decided to run a ground reality check.

 As Step I to combat calamities, a comprehensive study said to be the first of its kind in the country has been commissioned to assess area-wise ground response characteristics in and around Calcutta.

 It is in zone IV of the seismic zone, which means the possibility of an earthquake hazard is high in the region. But we do not have specific data to initiate measures and minimise potential losses from seismic and other natural hazards, said P.K. Bose, professor, department of geological sciences, Jadavpur University (JU).

 So, the first step will be the creation of a data bank on the regions topography, geological setting, geophysical properties and various other soil-quality features.

 The state science and technology department will steer the data gathering process. Besides JU, it has already tied up with Geological Survey of India, city-based NGO West Bengal Academy of Science and Technology, and the Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute for the project. 

 We are also seeking research proposals on Calcutta from experts in earth sciences from reputed institutes across the country, said Parthasarathi Chakrabarti, principal scientist of the state science and technology department.

 According to scientists, the data bank will be used to forecast the likelihood of damage and also the extent of losses to property from a natural disaster, like an earthquake.

 We will also utilise the research to identify vulnerable sites. For instance, a huge portion of a road in east Calcutta had recently subsided. The studies will help us identify such sites, prone to subsidence. So, appropriate action can be taken well in advance, said Chakrabarti. 

 In addition, the outcome of the studies will be applied to draw up a list of dos and donts for construction in various zones.

 Research on low-cost technology for building blocks to minimise damage from natural calamities is also part of the exercise.

 The project involves various agencies and it covers an entire gamut of streams Next month, we are organising an interactive session with experts to decide how to go about things in a time-bound manner, said Chakrabarti.

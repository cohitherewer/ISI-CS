 Pen Power: Javed Akhtar at Jadavpur University 

on Monday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal

 Not all good-looking men get into acting, quipped Javed Akhtar labelling his walk-in appearance in Madhur Bhandarkar?s forthcoming film Corporate as just a one-off friendly gesture. The packed KP Basu Memorial auditorium at Jadavpur University, of course, erupted in laughter, appreciating once more the writer-lyricist-poet?s sense of humour.

 Javedsaab was in town on Monday to not only recite some of his choicest Urdu poetry to the students of the Arts department but also talk about Indian cinema in general, a body he has been part of in various capacities ? story, screenplay and dialogue writer, songwriter and now, as an actor (a tag he obviously doesn?t approve of).

 ?Madhur?s a person I have known and he just wanted me to walk in and hand over an award as myself in a scene in his film where corporate awards are being given away,? said Javedsaab. ?Will you call that acting??

 The man, of course, did have a lot to say about the changing face of Indian cinema. ?I am often asked these days why don?t we have songs like the ones in Pyaasa? I ask them do you have films like that today where such songs can find space?? said Javedsaab.

 He, in fact, urged the students listening to him in rapt attention to come out and reject everything from bad cinema to wrong dialogues to grammatically incorrect lyrics. ?If you don?t reject them, the makers would continue to produce such material,? announced Javed Akhtar.

 ?One hit film from David Dhawan makes 15 times more money than all the good films. In the late-80s and early-90s, film-makers were using very vulgar lyrics in their films. Only when people protested in different places did they take such words out of their movies.?

 Javedsaab did back films like Devdas and Parineeta which are adapted from literary classics. ?There also, the stories are not told in a simple manner. There is a tendency to step on two boats. But at least they know that there is another boat,? he said to loud cheers and claps.

 But it was Javed Akhtar?s poetry that once again was the toast of the evening. ?Many people who just know me as a Hindi film songwriter get a cultural shock when they hear my poetry,? he revealed. ?Then they ask whether I write romantic poetry. I tell them, ?Yes I do, but not for free?.?

 Apart from reciting some of his most famous poems like Banjara, Javedsaab even dedicated the poem he had written for his daughter Zoya to all the girls sitting in the auditorium. ?It?s called Doraha or Crossroads and it is strictly for the girls here.?

 In between his recitation and his criticism of New Bollywood, Javedsaab went back in time to some of the poets he liked. ?In the 1950s and 1960s you had such great writers like Sahir Ludhianvi, Shailendra, Majrooh Sultanpuri and Kaifi Azmi. They were great poets who came to the film industry having established a name for themselves in writing.?

 Supporting the use of songs in Hindi films, Javedsaab said: ?From the time of nautanki to Sanskrit plays, we have always used music to tell our stories. That is the language we know. You as a viewer can accept it or reject it but the original Indian cinema will always be the one using songs in its narrative.?

 The man who gave birth to the angry-young-man image in Indian cinema, is dismayed that the very face of Indian cinema has changed. ?The urban middle class is having one big party and they don?t want the party to end. So today?s hero doesn?t work and he walks out on the meadows of Switzerland so that some poor Indian doesn?t come into the frame somewhere in the background. Consumerism has taken over our cinema and film producers today ignore the 72 per cent audiences in the villages.?

 As for his own work, Javedsaab has just written eight ghazals for the new Umrao Jaan by J.P. Dutta and is set to write some more ghazals for a private album by Lata Mangeshkar.

 BABY'S DAY IN

 A reading session 

 by Storytellers at Landmark 

 Pretty princess, prince charming, 

 fairy godmother, flying horses, fearsome monsters? All part 

 of the many memorable storytelling sessions that most of 

 us have grown up on. Sadly, in most urban homes today, such 

 sessions are things of the past. Only to be taken over by 

 hours in front of the television.

 The closest the GenX child comes 

 to such tales are the bits and pieces that mummy tells on 

 the dining table. However, there is more to storytelling 

 than mere distraction as your kid gulps down vegetables, 

 fruits and milk that he/she is least fond of.

 Heres a GoodLife 

 guide to help your little one discover the simple joys of 

 storytelling, an activity that combines fun, learning and 

 character development.

 Plus points

 Most educators believe storytelling 

 is a successful way to initiate a childs mental growth 

 and improve communication skills. As Sumana Mukherjee, teacher 

 at Mongrace Montessori House on 1, Short Street, puts it: 

 Today, our lifestyle is such that not only working 

 mothers, even homemakers dont indulge in storytelling 

 sessions. Little do they realise that when you narrate a 

 story to your child, it improves creative abilities and 

 visual imagination.

 Agrees Arundhati Gupta, founder 

 member of Storytellers, an organisation that conducts narrative 

 sessions. Children have a fertile brain. Stories introduce 

 them to the fantasy world and strengthen imaginary powers 

 that are later translated into greater comprehending and 

 writing skills. Plus, a story has many layers ? it is informative, 

 value-based, educates the child about geographical, historical 

 and scientific aspects. All this is transferred to the child 

 through narration, feels Arundhati.

 Storytelling also incorporates 

 reading habits and increases vocabulary. Children 

 begin to discover the interesting aspects and scope of a 

 storybook. It is only a matter of time before they take 

 to reading it themselves, says Arundhati. 

 Most importantly, storytelling 

 is a great way to bond with children. Says Sumana: It 

 is an exercise where parents have an active participation, 

 giving the child enough time and being a part of the world 

 he/she can relate too. The kid feels wanted.

 Read right

 It is necessary to incorporate 

 a storytelling session in the childs routine right 

 from the age he/she can comprehend your phrases. 

 The reader must be fluent with 

 the language. Fumbling will only lead to the child being 

 disinterested. Pronunciation and articulation need to be 

 taken care of, as the child will pick them up from you. 

 Read loud and slow with proper expressions and voice modulation. 

 To make it interesting, 

 introduce drama. For instance, if you are reading Little 

 Red Riding Hood, passages of the wolf can be read out 

 in a gruff voice and that of Red Riding Hood in a childish 

 voice, suggests Sumana.

 A good idea is to let the child 

 read along with you. A story has different characters. 

 Let them read out a character they like best. Let them hold 

 and touch the book and look at the pictures. Also, take 

 time to answer their queries, says Arundhati.

 Sumana also suggests introducing 

 fun activities related to the tale. All you need are 

 dollops of imagination. Begin with simple exercises like 

 drawing their favourite character and letting them colour.

 Lastly, time it right. Bedtime 

 is convenient as the child has finished his/her homework 

 and you are relatively relaxed. 

 Buy basics 

 Choosing the right book is the 

 key to a successful storytelling session. Here are some 

 pointers:

 Pick up books according to your 

 childs age. Involve them when you go book-shopping

 Begin with short stories with 

 short sentences. It takes time to develop a childs 

 concentration level

 Begin with books related to fields 

 that interest them

 Move over to fairytales, mythology, 

 folklore and fables. Opt for books in vernacular languages 

 too

 Stories with repetitive phrases 

 and actions are useful. They familiarise the kid with the 

 language

 A book must be colourful and full 

 of illustrations; the language should be lucid

 Make sure the book in no way makes 

 fun of physical disabilities or a community. It should not 

 talk about crime and violence

 If your child is addicted to the 

 television, to get him/her interested in stories, start 

 with books that deal with cartoon characters he/she catches 

 on TV. The book exploring greater details and aspects of 

 toon faves is sure to interest them

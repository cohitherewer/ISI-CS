 Stringed symphony

 Ancient Indian musical instruments produced anaahat (un-struck) by means of aahat (plucked). This is said to represent the three constituent sounds of omkaar generating from the navel, heart and throat points of the spinal cord of the human body or gaatra-veena. Myths say that the concept of the veena sprang from this realisation. Further, mythology, philosophy and science have come together in the idea that the living human body is a microcosm of the macrocosmic universe. According to Hindu mythology, Brahma, the creator of the universe, personified Saraswati as the deity of celestial music and the Goddess plays the veena with gentle, feminine grace. Rudraveena, as its name signifies, symbolises the power of rudra or masculinity. While playing this majestic yet almost extinct variety of the veena, the musician sits in vajrasana. This evening, Bahauddin Dagar presents a rudraveena recital, accompanied by Tapas Das on the pakhawaj.

 Event: Rudraveena recital by Bahauddin Dagar 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall, Gol Park

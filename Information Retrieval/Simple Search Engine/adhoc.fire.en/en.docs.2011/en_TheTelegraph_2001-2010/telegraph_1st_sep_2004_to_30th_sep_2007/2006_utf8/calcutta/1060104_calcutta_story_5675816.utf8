Life

 For the penny to drop

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Dont go by their size or age. Clothes, music or simply saving up their pocket money ? kids today aspire to do everything in style. 

 Chances then are that they would refuse to stash their savings away in old chocolate boxes or oh-so-common terracotta pitcher-like piggy banks. 

 A piggy bank these days must be so good looking, that they can easily be a part of the childs brightly decorated room.

 So, if you are on the lookout for coin holders that would impress your tiny tots and be stylish enough to add cheer to their room, Archies at City Centre is the right place to look.

 The animal-shaped coin holders come in two varieties ? polyresin and ceramic. These imported coin holders are a great combination of utility as well as decorative value. Many people are buying them as gifts as well as for their homes. From the high-end ones to the reasonably priced, there are enough varieties to suit every pocket, says Gautam Shroff at Archies.

 The ceramic ones are slightly bigger and come in the form of cows, pigs and elephants.

 Ceramic coin holders have always been a top choice over the years. But now they have had an image makeover. New age in concept, colour combinations, designing and finish, these are a treasure to own, points out Shroff.

The stylish cow with horns is interestingly painted all over with wavy stripes in splashes of black, red and yellow. The other attractive colour combination is an off-white base with a sober blend of green, blue and pink.

 The elephants are sweet and stout from the front and the rear view actually resembles the face of a man! The pigs are also adorned with red and blue stars and stripes. 

 The polyresin ones come in all possible shapes and sizes. Its a complete animal kingdom with a little elephant in mauve, plump Mr Giraffe in green and a cute little cat in orange. Dotted with colourful plastic flower embellishments and patches, they all have a narrow slit at the back to drop the jingling coins. 

 The little fish-shaped ones are in bright yellow and blue stripes or pink with mauve stripes. The latter stands out because of the stylish side fins in purple. Bright eyes and lips curling into broad smiles complete the effect.

 The beetle-shaped ones are electric red with big black dots. A cheerful off-white cow with black patches jostles for attention. It has flowers and butterflies all over. 

 Colourful walls for the childrens room are in vogue. With the large variety on offer, you can pick up piggy banks that are in sync with the wall paint, adds a spokesperson from Archies.

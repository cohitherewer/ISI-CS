 Clean fuel falls foul

 - High price, low supply force rethink

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Confronted with the spiralling cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and the shortage in its supply, the state government is on a rethink on promoting the fuel.

 ?We will have to review our LPG policy. Its price has risen sharply over the past year and it is no longer feasible as a commercial fuel. We?re writing to the chief minister, informing him of the situation and seeking directions from him,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury on Wednesday. 

 Representatives of Hindustan Motors (HM), which manufactures cars that run on LPG, and officials of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP have met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and apprised him of the situation.

 ?There has been a 55 per cent hike in LPG price over the past year ? from Rs 19.33 per litre in April 2004 to Rs 29.96 per litre in December 2005. In comparison, diesel prices have risen by only 30 per cent,? stated Dipak Jain, general manager (marketing), HM.

 As part of its commitment to clean up the air in the city, the state government tried to make LPG mandatory for old taxis and autorickshaws. 

 Over 1,600 LPG autorickshaws ply in the city currently, of which more than 90 per cent are petrol vehicles that have converted to the green fuel, following the government?s phase-out threat. In addition, about 150 new taxis and 800 private cars are running on the fuel in the city.

 ?I have been suffering ever since I bought an LPG taxi eight months ago. It gives a mileage only 7.5 km per litre. When we approached the transport minister last week, he promised to get our LPG taxis exchanged for diesel ones,? said Gouri Shankar Misra, a cab driver. 

 A transport department official admitted that oil companies have been unable to provide a steady supply of LPG to these vehicles. ?Only 10 of the city?s 12 auto LPG refuelling stations are functional. But even they are dry half the time. There are takers for LPG, but the uncertainty over supply is holding people back,? opined a HM official.

 IOC officials refuted the claim. ?There was a problem in December, but the situation is back to normal. We are operating at one-fifth of our capacity. The average monthly sale through the five IOC pumps is only around 90 metric tonnes,? said an official.

 Bangalore, where LPG was introduced around the same time as Calcutta, sells more than 500 metric tonnes of LPG per month, he added. ?In Delhi, the government subsidised CNG. In Bengal, the state government continues to charge 12.5 per cent sales tax on LPG in addition to a Re 1 cess,? pointed out the HM official.

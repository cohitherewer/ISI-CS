 Universality of folk tales

 Antonio R. Almodovar: Ties and lore

 Antonio R. Almodovar, a winner of Spain?s National Prize for Children and Young Literature 2005, found ?the living metaphor? he was looking for in the Botanical Gardens. 

 At the speech organised by the Publishers and Booksellers? Guild at the Book Fair, Almodovar said Indo-European languages are like the offshoots of the Giant Banyan Tree which continue to flourish and are linked to the one source even if that source is no longer visible. 

 With the help of interpreter Bhashwati Thakurta, Almodovar traced the similarities in folk tales from around the world. For Denmark?s ancient tale of Princess and the Pea, he found a parallel in a 3rd Century BC Indian tale about three brothers, one of whom was so sensitive he could feel a hair under several layers of mattresses.

 ?I have lived so long among the tales of Panchatantra, the Mahabharata, that they are a part of my existence,? Almodovar, the first to begin writing down Spain?s vast collection of oral stories, told Metro. His initiation into oral traditions came through his grandmother?s tales, which fired his imagination and cultivated an almost instinctive ability to find in all literature (which he later studied at university) a basic similarity. 

 He learnt the richness of oral literature from meetings with farming folk in his neighbourhood. Later, when he read a Spanish translation of the Rig Veda and discovered a semblance of the popular tale of The Happy Prince, his thirst for the literary traditions of India grew manifold. 

 In subsequent endeavours, he noticed patterns and a basic attempt of all cultures to propagate moral values, social mores and a positive attitude to life. ?What if the old ties between Eastern and Western cultural traditions were renewed?? wondered the author.

 Folk tales and fairy tales, he admitted, were not too popular with the modern generation in Spain until the books began to come out. Now, Almodovar?s books, like Tales of the Little Half Moon and A Place Like Paradise, are not only hits with kids but also top the charts as TV productions.

 Currently working on four new stories, he summed up: ?Folk tales, now staple in most schools in Spain, are essential because they help introduce concepts of right and wrong.?

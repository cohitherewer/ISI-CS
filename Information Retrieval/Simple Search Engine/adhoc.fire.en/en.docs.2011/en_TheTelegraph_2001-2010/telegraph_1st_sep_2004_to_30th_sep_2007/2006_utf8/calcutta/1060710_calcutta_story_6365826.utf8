 The monsoon is finally here and the state?s information technology showpiece is scurrying for cover. The lack of streetlights and security are a given, but what of the potholed roads soon to be submerged and transformed from the disgusting to the deadly?

 Passing the buck had been the norm when it came to setting things right at Sector V. Now, the buck has stopped at the door of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, formed in January 2006, to monitor and implement infrastructure development in Sector V.

 Whose responsibility is it anyway, and what is the way out? Metro went on a fact-finding mission on what ails the streets of Sector V.

 What we saw: The main thoroughfare in front of the Bengal Intelligent Park and Cognizant Technology Solutions has crater-sized potholes and though there has been some repair work, the road condition is still quite shoddy, making driving a nightmare, even in daylight.

 Industry: ?The roads are in very bad condition in some parts. They have neither been laid out properly nor sloped with care. The drainage system is terrible. When one turns right from Nicco Park, there is a huge pothole. I just wonder what impression visitors get once they enter Sector V.? ? R.C. Bhattacharya, director, Globsyn Business School.

 l?The roads have to be repaired promptly and the streetlights must be in working condition.? ? D.K. Chaudhuri, CEO, Skytech Solutions.

 Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority: ?Due to the rains, we cannot do anything now, but we plan to address the problem very soon. Also, the recent Assembly elections delayed a number of projects.? ? Subrata Sen, vice-chairman, Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

 What we saw: Potholes dominate the road to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), with one side of the lane in very bad shape. Road dividers are broken on the entire stretch, from Webel SDF building to the 215A bus stop. Telephone and power lines are coiled haphazardly around the poles. The ends of the wires trail on the ground.

 Industry: ?The stretch in front our office is reduced to a one-lane potholed one, with the other lane inaccessible.? ? a PwC source.

 Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority: ?Road repair is going on, though it is just patchwork by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). Once we have our full-fledged office, we can address such problems? ? Subrata Sen.

 WhO BUILDS AND MAINTAINS THE ROAD: Currently, for the building or repairing any road in Sector V, a tender notice is circulated and the lowest quotation is selected. Only public works department-enlisted contractors are eligible for the bid, held every five years. Government-approved materials are used. But the roads, and the repairs, refuse to last.

 Who is to blame: ?The roads were constructed by the state urban development department; maintenance was also its responsibility? ? Dilip Gupta, ex-chairman, Bidhannagar Municipality.

 l?All this while, Bidhannagar Municipality was in charge of Sector V, and there may have been some laxity in its work process ? Subrata Sen of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

 What happens next? ?Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority has authorised the CMDA to repair the roads. Some of the work will be directly done by the CMDA, while the rest will be completed under the private-public partnership model.? ? municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 l?Almost Rs 15.50 crore has been allotted for Sector V. All companies must sign an undertaking to complete repairs in their vicinity. We plan to repair and construct new road dividers and pavements.? ? Subrata Sen.

 What?s the way out? The maintenance of such a high-profile hub should not be entrusted to the government or the municipal authorities and handed over to a competent independent body.

 ?We have not thought about that. Till date, roads have never been handed over to any independent body.? ? S.A. Ahmed, chairman, Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

 Bottomline: Potholed Sector V is more shame than showpiece.

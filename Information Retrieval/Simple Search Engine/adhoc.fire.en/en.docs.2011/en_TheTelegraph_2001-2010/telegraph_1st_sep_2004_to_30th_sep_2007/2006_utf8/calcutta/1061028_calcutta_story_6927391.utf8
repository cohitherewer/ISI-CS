The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Julia Roberts and Bill Gates

 You are sensitive, artistic but complacent. You have tremendous tenacity but prefer to work at a casual pace. You are an independent thinker and generous with money but not too realistic with personal investments. Your options are conventional, rather than controversial, because displays of emotion scare you. Kusum Bhandari

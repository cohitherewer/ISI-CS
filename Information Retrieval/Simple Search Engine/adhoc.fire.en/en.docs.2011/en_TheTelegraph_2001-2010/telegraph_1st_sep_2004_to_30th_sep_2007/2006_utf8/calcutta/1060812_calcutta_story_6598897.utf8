 Tagore has perhaps made the deepest influence on the psyche of the people of Bengal. His creations, particularly his songs, beautifully express the various shades of human emotion and passion. Touching the very depths of our feelings, they have the power to stay close to our hearts even across the horizons of time. Over the years, however, their style of presentation has evolved with a lot of experimentation being attempted in the post-copyright era. Sab Haranor Pare, a solo recital of Tagores songs of love presented by Rahul Mitra, seeks to underline the true spirit of the poets romantic vision. Comprising a selection of 24 soul-searching songs that adhere to tradition, they evoke the awe, admiration, wonder and worship that distinguish such compositions. The songs will be interspersed with poignant and thought-provoking readings and recitations on the theme of love from Tagores works in prose and verse by Soumitra Chattopadhyay. Hosted by Silpimon and P amp;M Records.

 Event: Tagore songs by Rahul Mitra, along with recitation by Soumitra Chattopadhyay

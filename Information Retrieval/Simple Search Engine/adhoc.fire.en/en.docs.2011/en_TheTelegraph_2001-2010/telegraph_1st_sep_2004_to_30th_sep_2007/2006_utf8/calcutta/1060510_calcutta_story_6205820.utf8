Beckingham beckons 

Screen On amp; Off

 ALL SPICE: Victoria and 

 David Beckham

 They are one of the more sought after couples in showbiz but the real stories of David and Victoria Beckham remain locked behind closed doors. This Wednesday at 10 pm, the Fabulous Life of the Beckhams on Vh1 tries to cast the inner eye on the lavish lifestyle of the soccer icon and the former Spice girl.

 There?s a lowdown on the cars the Beckhams use to move around. They choose between an Aston Martin, a Mercedes and a Bentley, all custom-made with the names of the family embossed on the body of the cars. That?s not all. They also have a Jaguar, a Range Rover and a Lincoln SUV totalling $ 370,000. Not to mention two BMWs worth $ 625,000. Oh, David also has a mini-fleet of Ferraris.

 There?s a separate section on Beckingham Palace, the tabloid media?s name for their enormous estate in England. The couple purchased it for $ 4 million and then spent another $ 5 million just doing it up. This 25-acre spread features 50,000 flowers, a recording studio, gold-plated toilets and a jungle-theme room completely covered with leopard print.

 Beckham Jr, son Brooklyn, has a $ 30,000 dome in his room so it feels like he?s sleeping under the night sky every evening. But if that gets boring, there?s his $ 13,000 tree house with a spiral staircase, furnished by a decorator.

 Name game: Omkara

 The title for Vishal Bhardawaj?s 

 interpretation of Shakespeare?s Othello has been 

 decided as Omkara after a lot of heartburn, confusion 

 and even a nationwide contest. The opinions of the cast, 

 crew and producers of the film starring Ajay Devgan, Kareena 

 Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Bipasha Basu, Viveik Oberoi, Naseeruddin 

 Shah and Konkona Sen Sharma had sparked such a debate that 

 it was left to an audience poll for the final call.

 The public voting in had to decide between Omkara, Issak and O Saathi Re. The verdict came from all quarters with a thundering vote (more than 80 per cent) for Omkara. Bhardawaj is a relieved man, having always wanted the title Omkara. ?I was expecting that I would get the title I wanted,? he said. ?I believe that if I desire something passionately enough, I will get it.? 

 But the man who plays Omkara in the film is not convinced. ?Yes, I wanted Issak. People were a bit confused and that?s why we had an audience poll. Now there?s no confusion,? says Ajay. In contrast, co-star Saif was jubilant: ?I am very happy, as I was always partial to the title Omkara.?

 Bipasha summed up the name game: ?Omkara is the director?s vision and when the director?s happy, everyone?s happy.?

 ?I have never used any artificial stunts or tricks to get publicity in my career,? fumes Raveena Tandon. In an exclusive appearance on Filmy?s Aaj Ki Filmy Khabar, the Mast mast actress denies having used her dog to make national news. The episode airs on May 10 at 7.30 pm. 

 Ravs says she has been very cautious about ethics throughout her career. ?Then how can I stoop to a level of cheap publicity?? demands Raveena, who feels strongly for animals and would like to have X-ray, ECG and sonography facilities for them. 

 About her escapade of pouring wine on her husband?s ex-wife in a party, Raveena admits she enjoyed doing that and adds that it was not just impulse. ?Had I gone legal, the person would have been trapped badly. My objective was to publicly humiliate and teach her a lesson and not spoil her life,? says Raveena. 

 On her plans to return to mainstream cinema or television, Raveena says she is hearing out scripts but is still enjoying the sabbatical of motherhood.

 Toon tales: A moment from The King 

 and the Mockingbird

 department is organising a week-long festival of animation

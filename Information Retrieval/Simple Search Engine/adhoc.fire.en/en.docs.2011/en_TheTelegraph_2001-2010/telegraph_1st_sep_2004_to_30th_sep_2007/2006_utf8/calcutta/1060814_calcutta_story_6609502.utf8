The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Family is the cake, love is the crust

 Feeling like an anxious parent on KANK day, KARAN JOHAR tells Pratim D. Gupta that he will be happy if his latest magnum opus evokes surprise rather than shock

 You have a release date after five years. How does it feel?

 I feel anxious. I feel nervous. I am not a parent but if giving birth is this painful then I dont want to give birth ever!

 Five years back, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, 

 you spoke about families. In Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, 

 Dev (Shah Rukh) and Maya (Rani) mock families. Have you 

 changed in these five years?

 More than me changing, I think it is the reflection of the environment around us. I am not known for making movies on social causes. I do not make films on socially prevailing disorders. But my films do deal with emotions. In my first two films, my characters have been white. In KANK, I have tinted them with a tad grey colour. These are flawed characters. They make mistakes, realise their flaws and own up in the end.

 Despite all the problems they face, in the end they 

 do get together. So you are walking the extra mile after 

 Silsila?

 No. See for me, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna doesnt have a happy ending. It cannot have. When Dev and Maya walk into the sunset or maybe even into the crowd, they are alone. Theirs is a half-hearted life because they are bearing the consequences of hurting their loved ones. Dev tells Maya: Khushi aur gham to baant chuke, abhi adhoori zindagi ek saath baant lete hain. They are both suffering for their faults but they want to share it together.

 So are you for or against the institution of marriage?

 I believe in the institution of family. I have grown up in a very happy family. KANK is my way of warning people that marriage is not your identity. It does not define you. You should not marry until and unless you are sure that the time and person are right for you. You need to live, but you do not need to be married.

 I do not agree to arranged marriages. But love, yes. Love is essential for families. Because love is a strong foundation. Even love may fail with times. Gold rusts, diamonds get eroded, a Van Gogh painting decays but they were all brilliant once. Just like love. Love is the crux.

 If family is the cake, love is the crust. If the crust is bad, the cake wont be strong.

 But only flawed people have failed marriages?

 See Ranis character in the film. Many people may ask, and I expect them to ask, that why doesnt she love her husband. She is the boldest character in the film and in any of my films. Despite being married to Abhishek, she does not feel the passion for him. She respects the person but treats him maternally. I think you havent seen such a character in mainstream Indian cinema before.

 How could you feel and understand all this without 

 being married?

 Its better when you are away than when you are in. When you are away, you can stare, see and even make films about it. You can be most objective about the whole subject. Like Dev tells Maya at the beginning of the film that strangers are often more helpful than known people. I am a stranger to the institution of marriage but I am an observer. And my movies are the reflection of life and relationships around me

 I am a silent observer of human nature. And I feel I am really lucky that I can express my observations on a platter called movies.

 The biggest stars in Bollywood are your closest friends. 

 Does your casting come first or your characters?

 I wrote the film first. But yes, I would love to work with Shah Rukh always. I also have great associations with the Bachchans. So while I write every film first, I end up casting all these lovely people whom I love and respect. And the main protagonist is invariably Shah Rukh. He is indispensable to my films.

 And is the guaranteed box-office success back there 

 somewhere in the mind?

 Star cast does pull in but regardless of how many stars you have if your film is not good it will not work. Yes, the initial excitement is generated but havent we all seen big multi-star cast films biting the dust? Ultimately the content is the king. Just like the consumer is the king.

 There are references and tributes to films like Silsila 

 and Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge in KANK. 

 Are these conscious?

 There are two shots. One is the autumn shot (used in the Tumhi dekho na song featuring Shah Rukh and Rani) from Kabhi Kabhie and the other is the song (Tujhe dekha to yeh featuring Shah Rukhs screen son) from Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. See, I have grown up watching the Yash Chopra cinema and I am a great admirer of his movies. So these are like silent tributes. I am a product, a derivative of the Yash Chopra school of film-making. I just hope that some day people emulate me as a film-maker just like I emulate him.

 Why make such a fleeting appearance?

 I am glad its fleeting. I am surprised how you noticed it. I didnt want to be there. It was minus 14 degrees but they dragged me on to the set because it was the last scene. And I just fitted in there two rows behind Shah Rukhs seat and even in that one second I did what I do best talking on the phone.

 Star directors are alien to Indian cinema. We know 

 a Quentin Tarantino or a Wong Kar-Wai but we have to add 

 Karan Johar to the list

 I am just a peoples person. I love what I do and I do everything. I do a chat show (Koffee With Karan), I host awards, I walked the ramp a couple of days back I believe we are really gifted that we are born as human beings. We could have been anything a plant on a tree or a CD on a rack. But when God has given us an opportunity to be human beings, I love to laugh, dance, cry, just do everything.

 So various doors are open to me and since you get to see so much of me everywhere, you feel that I am a star director. But its true that I am happy when I am recognised in public. I do not put up a show of being an intense, passionate film-maker. I am just me. I can be stupid at times, even uninformed at times, but I am right in front of everyone.

 What is the finest compliment you have received for 

 KANK?

 Finest compliment finest compliment Well, I got this letter from Amitji saying that KANK is the best film I have made. I got the warmest hug from Shah Rukh who complimented me on making such a bold film on such a huge scale. But the finest compliment came from Shah Rukhs eight-year-old son Aryan who said, Karan, you have made a nice film. That made my day.

 Do we have to wait for another five-year-plan for 

 your next film?

 (Laughs) I hope not. Right now I am waiting for the feedback on Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. I just hope that the drastic departure from my previous films is not taken as a shock but as a pleasant surprise. I know there will be a lot of talk around my film. But as long as the film can make you react, I am happy.

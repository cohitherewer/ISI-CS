The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Heist at cellphone outlet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five men in their mid-20s, armed with bhojalis and firearms, raided a mobile phone shop on crowded APC Roy Road on Friday afternoon, snatched two gold chains from customers, took money out of the cash box and decamped with 18 handsets.

 None of the 12 people in the shop ? eight customers, the shop-owner and his employees ? dared resist the gun-toting gangsters. 

 Besides, they pasted leucoplast on the mouths of the customers so that they could not raise a hue and cry. No one has been arrested.

 According to police, the gang stormed into the cellphone retail outlet near Sealdah around 2.10 pm. 

 ?Immediately after entering the shop, they whipped out the weapons and slid the glass door shut. People on the road had no idea what was happening inside, as the door was of tinted glass,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department).

 The gang gagged the customers and herded them into one corner, pointing a gun at them. 

 ?Two of the youths were busy opening the showcase and taking out the cellphones, while their accomplices stood guard at the entrance,? said an officer of the detective department?s anti-dacoity wing.

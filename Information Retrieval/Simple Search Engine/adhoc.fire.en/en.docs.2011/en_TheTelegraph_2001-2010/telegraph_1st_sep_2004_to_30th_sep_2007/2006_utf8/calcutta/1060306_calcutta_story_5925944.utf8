The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 School snub parried with hush huddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Most ICSE and CBSE schools in the city have refused to reply to the government?s questionnaire on their functioning, prompting the education department to approach the respective boards directly and organise ?secret meetings? with the guardians to get the necessary information.

 Around 350 unaided schools affiliated to the ICSE and CBSE boards have not sent in their replies even after a second reminder from the government two months ago. 

 The first reminder drew a blank, and only a dozen-odd schools fell in line after the second.

 ?We will not take this attitude of the schools lying down. We will talk to the highest officials of the boards,? said Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner in the school education department and chairman of a 13-member committee devising ways to regulate unaided English-medium schools.

 The panel ? which has representatives of both boards ? was set up in August last year, following complaints from guardians that the standard of education imparted by most unaided ICSE and CBSE schools was not commensurate with their high tuition and other fees.

 By circulating the questionnaire, the government intended to seek information from the schools on every aspect of their administration ? number of students, tuition and other fees, teachers? pay-scales, academic standard, students? performance in board exams, infrastructure and the facilities they offer.

 Faced with the refusal of the schools in parting with the information, the government has decided to meet guardians and ask them to voice their opinion about the institutions.

 Teachers of these schools, too, will be requested to meet the committee members and air their grievances.

 The government has so far refrained from taking any ?drastic step?, as that would have affected the students. ?But we will not allow the schools to take advantage of our leniency. They cannot disobey our order,? Biswas asserted.

 The panel he?s heading was supposed to examine the replies to the questionnaire and submit a report to the education department by February. 

 The government had announced in the Assembly last year that guidelines for disciplining the errant schools, based on the panel?s recommendations, would be ready by March this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

City girl voted out

 It?s not over: Anu Malik with Monali Thakur

 She was the darling of the contest and everyone would go ?she?s so cute? in chorus every time Monali Thakur would take the Indian Idol stage. But the audience had other ideas as the Calcutta girl ? daughter of singer-songwriter Shakti Thakur ? was voted out on the Tuesday episode of the Sony talent hunt show.

 ?I am really shocked with the results. I don?t know what is on the minds of Indian viewers. They have voted Meenal, Karunya and Monali in the bottom three. I don?t have words to express my disappointment,? said judge Anu Malik, after the announcement of the results.

 Monali, expectedly, is completely shattered. ?There is something wrong somewhere. Ami oto kharap gaini,? she told Metro just before packing her bags to take the flight back from Mumbai to Calcutta. ?I strongly believe I had the potential to move on.?

 After the shocking announcement, Monali sang Kabhi alvida na kehna with the rest of the finalists joining her in her finale.

 The only solace for Monali is judge Anu Malik?s offer to sing playback for him in his next score. ?I will come back to Mumbai and take up Anuji?s offer to sing for movies,? said the girl, still in a state of shock.

 The next gala rounds of Indian Idol will have a new telecast timing, with the Sony show now beaming on Mondays and Tuesdays at 9 pm.

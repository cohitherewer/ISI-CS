 Safety concerns and proliferation of counterfeit rubber pipes that connect cooking gas cylinders with burners have prompted oil companies to introduce a new type of tube.

 The three-layered pipe, named Suraksha Hose, has been designed and developed by LPG Equipment Research Centre, Bangalore. It has tied up with eight companies to manufacture the new pipe, which will cost Rs 170 and come with a five-year guarantee.

 A light green, soft-rubber tube is currently used to connect LPG cylinders with burners. The oil companies have deemed the hose not totally safe.

 The new, three-layered tube consists of a wired net and a casing of fire-resistant material over a rubber tube. 

 Officials of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which is the coordinator of the oil companies, met LPG distributors in the city on Wednesday and asked them to promote the new hose. 

 The LPG cylinder is 100 per sent safe and there is no report of any accident due to it. Though few in number, some accidents do occur in the kitchen because of the rubber tube in use. As it is flexible and soft, cracks develop at the burner-end due to heat. Besides, rats, cockroaches, ants and other insects damage the pipe. The resulting leakage causes accidents, said IOC deputy general manager (LPG) A.C. De.

 The new hose has been designed in such a way that it hardly develops cracks. Insects, too, will not be able to bite into it. If the kitchen catches fire for some reason, the cylinder and the hose will remain unaffected, added De. 

 The other cause of concern, according to an IOC official, is the flood of fake rubber pipes in the market. Rubber tubes for domestic LPG cylinders are available in the open market and hence, there is no quality control.

 We have decided to sell the new hoses only through the LPG dealers so that nobody gets the opportunity to sell counterfeit pipes. Consumers can order the new pipe while booking a cylinder refill. The deliveryman will bring the new pipe and replace the old one, stated the IOC deputy general manager.

 He clarified that replacement of old rubber tubes with pipes of the new model is not mandatory for the 3.5 million customers of the company, but those who have applied for new cooking gas connections will be provided new pipes.

 Our target is to complete the replacement process within three to four years. We have chalked out several programmes to make the consumers aware of the new product. We have also launched an incentive programme for the deliverymen, who have an important role in popularising the Suraksha Hose in the kitchens, said senior sales manager of IOC Ujjal Chatterjee.

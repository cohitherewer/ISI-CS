 Classical harmony

 Western classical music evolved by absorbing various influences, including formalization of improvised traditions, growth of notation, development of tuning system and innovative approaches to form. Bach and Haendel dominated the high baroque music of the early 18th century, composing music for almost every genre. Later in the century, the music of western Europe was defined by the classic style of Mozart, with the symphony, sonata and string quartet predominating. The classical style culminated in the music of Beethoven, who is perceived as the link between the classic and romantic styles. With Wagner, romantic opera expanded in terms of orchestra, scope of subject, demands on voice and so on. Later, French composers Debussy and Ravel, whose music is based on non-functional harmonic principles, prevailed. This evening, Julie Arnulfo and Nicolas Paul present a violin and cello concert featuring immortal compositions of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Haendel, Ravel and Debussy. Hosted by The French Association, French Embassy in India and Calcutta School of Music.

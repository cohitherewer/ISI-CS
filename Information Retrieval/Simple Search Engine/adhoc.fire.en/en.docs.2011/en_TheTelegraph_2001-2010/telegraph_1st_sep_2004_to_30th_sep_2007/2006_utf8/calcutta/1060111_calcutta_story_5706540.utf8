The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Jam-prone sit-in zones

 Hundreds of women, most of them elderly, sitting quietly on plastic chairs and listening to a speech, a few backbenchers munching on papad and chatting away ? all in the middle of a thoroughfare on a weekday afternoon.

 If on Monday afternoon the women?s wing of a political party had laid siege on Metro Channel, throwing traffic on Chowringhee out of gear, it was the turn of a union?s woman?s cultural wing to play traffic-stoppers on Tuesday afternoon by planting themselves on Rani Rashmoni Avenue.

 With vehicular traffic squeezed into two narrow lanes, the spillover effect of the crawl paralysed traffic at Esplanade and on SN Banerjee Road. But all that those caught in the traffic snarl on the Park Street flyover on Monday or on SN Banerjee Road on Tuesday could do was fret and fume at the administration?s decision to designate the stretch opposite Metro cinema and Rani Rashmoni Avenue as sit-in sites.

 A congregation at the third designated spot, Shahid Minar, is less disruptive, but any meeting at the other two sites ? there are 12 to 15 a month at Metro Channel and 17 to 20 a month on Rani Rashmoni Avenue ? causes maximum traffic chaos in the heart of the city.

 The day after Metro questioned the logic of allowing rallies at such critical crossroads, police admitted that they were struggling to manage traffic when a meeting was being held at the designated sites of Metro Channel and Rani Rashmoni Avenue. A review of rally sites is also on, they added.

 Agreeing that traffic snarls are triggered by meetings and rallies held at Metro Channel and Rani Rashmoni Avenue, Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said: ?A discussion is on with the superiors, including commissioner of police Prasun Mukherjee, to sort out the problem.?

 An officer added: ?Our hands are tied following the government?s submission to the high court, but we see no point in allowing meetings at Metro Channel and Rani Rashmoni Avenue.?

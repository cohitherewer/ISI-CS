 They found themselves on the same stage for the first time 

 at a private party hosted by Sanjeev and Preeti Goenka on 

 Tuesday night, but Sourav Ganguly, Bhaichung Bhutia and 

 Karan Johar chatted freely about cricket, football and, 

 of course, films.

 He is not just into campus capers, ode to parents and failed 

 marriages. Karan could identify a Paresh Maity hanging on 

 the wall at first glance. So, he had a lot to discuss with 

 artist Suvaprasanna, while Sanjeev played the perfect host.

 Not so long ago, Karan wanted to be a fashion designer and 

 even designed Shah Rukhs clothes in a couple of movies. 

 So, chatting up fashion designer Anamika Khanna came naturally 

 to KJo, while PR veteran Rita Bhimani balanced films and 

 fashion. Pictures by Rashbehari Das

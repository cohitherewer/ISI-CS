The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Tie-up for TV matter

Screen On Off

 Britain bound: Abhishek Bachchan and Rani 

Mukherjee in Bunty Aur Babli.

Adlabs Films Limited, a part of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani led Reliance group, 

will acquire a majority stake in the Siddharth Basu-helmed Synergy Communications 

in its first serious foray in television business.

Synergy, of course, has been a pioneer in TV software 

production, making such cult small-screen shows as Kaun Banega Crorepati, 

University Challenge, Mastermind India, Kamzor Kadi Kaun 

and even the new dance show on Sony, Jhalak Dikhhla Ja. In addition, it 

has done Live shows Channel [V] Awards 97-98 and successfully published the 

Mastermind series.

The Adlabs investment will be used for enhancing Synergys 

financial strength, production operations and scaling up content to include popular 

fiction and non-fiction software including reality and lifestyle shows.

Manmohan Shetty, chairman and managing director, Adlabs 

Films, said: We are very excited with the beginning of the association with Synergy. 

The quality of content they have created consistently over a period of time is 

truly of international standards. We believe in Siddharth Basus vision and approach, 

and he would continue to manage the company. While Adlabs is acquiring 51 per 

cent controlling stake in Synergy Communications, operational control will remain 

with the original promoters of Synergy.

Siddharth Basu, on his part, said: The alliance with 

Adlabs would allow Synergy to not only consolidate its ability to deliver fine 

TV programmes with world-class production values in different genres, but would 

also enable us to develop an exciting range and depth of content for emerging 

opportunities in a variety of media.

Chopra time

Channel 4, one of the more popular channels in the UK, is paying tribute to Yash 

Chopra through a special film festival. Starting Monday, September 18, and continuing 

right up to November 6, The World of Yash Chopra will air on Mondays on Channel 

4. 

Each of the eight movies will have a special introduction 

either by Chopra or the director and star of the movie. Included in the festival 

will be films both directed by Chopra or produced under the banner of Yash Raj 

Films.

The festival aims to introduce a wide section of British 

television audiences to the more contemporary creations of Yash Raj Films, as 

well as the later-day hits directed by Yash Chopra. So, besides Veer-Zaara, 

Dil To Pagal Hai, Darr and Lamhe, the festival will air Dhoom, 

Hum Tum and Bunty Aur Babli. The show wraps up with the Aditya Chopra-directed 

Mohabbatein.

I am truly grateful for this honour, said Yash Chopra. 

It has always been my belief that at Yash Raj Films we make movies for the entire 

world, and this special festival simply reaffirms this belief.

Feluda abroad

 Brain and brawn: Sabyasachi Chakraborty (right) 

and Tota Roy Chowdhury on the sets of Tintorettor Jishu

Feluda is all set to nail the thieves who stole a Tintoretto painting from a house 

on the outskirts of Calcutta, and the chase is going to take the strapping sleuth 

to Hong Kong this September.

Film-maker Sandip Ray and his team leave for Hong 

Kong on September 18 to shoot the climax for Tintorettor Jishu. Apart from 

Feluda Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Topshe Parambrata Chatterjee and Jatayu Bibhu Bhattacharya, 

there will be Tota Roy Chowdhury and Paran Bandopadhyay in pivotal roles for this 

schedule of the film being produced by Kamal Bansal.

Sandip has zeroed in on Hong Kong and Kowloon. We 

will shoot on both the islands. The city of Hong Kong will be very much a part 

of the film, he said. Hong Kong has a very unusual topography. It has mountains, 

sea and skyscrapers, and is visually dazzling, which is a sharp contrast to Kowloon.

Tota, who plays Robin Chowdhury an ally of Feluda 

in the Tintoretto investigation, will get to show off his martial arts skills 

in some action scenes. Paran Bandopadhyay will be Feludas local contact in Hong 

Kong, added the film-maker whose last Feluda film, Bombaiyer Bombete, 

had beaten a few box-office records.

The Hong Kong shoot will be wrapped up in 10 to 12 

days, with help from local artistes. We will have to take some artistes from 

Hong Kong. We will decide on the cast soon; their pictures will be sent to us 

over e-mail, said Sandip, who is yet to finalise the casting of the villain.

Its a big help that we will be carrying our equipment. 

We will also need a production assistant from Hong Kong. The only problem in Hong 

Kong is language because not too many people are conversant in English A very 

small portion of Calcutta shooting is left, but that will be dictated by the Hong 

Kong schedule.

The Tintorettor shoot had begun in the dacoit-infested 

forests of Jhargram in early February, where a palace was turned into Baikunthapur, 

a sprawling house in Rays text from where an original Tintoretto painting is 

smuggled out to Hong Kong.

Back to 9/11

 Terror trek: A scene from The Path to 9/11.

It is being touted as the first ever official version of what happened on September 

9, 2001. On Sunday, Zee Studio premieres The Path to 9/11, a dramatisation 

of the events leading up to the fateful morning. The mini-series is based on the 

report of the 9/11 Commission published in July 2004.

Writer Cyrus Nowrasteh uses this historic document 

as the basis for a powerful story with action as gripping and far reaching as 

the source material itself. Shot in Toronto, Morocco, New York and Washington 

DC, actors portray the famous and infamous, along with the formerly anonymous 

and often-heroic people thrust onto historys stage.

The five-hour mini-series will be divided into two 

parts on Sunday, September 10, from 9 pm to 12 midnight and on Monday, September 

11 from 9 pm to 11 pm.

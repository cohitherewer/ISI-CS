 Rapid transit buses on the anvil

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city is set to get a bus rapid transit system (BRTS), which combines the advantages of railway networks with the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of on-road vehicles. 

 The system is being introduced in Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad and Jaipur. It will be launched in Calcutta on a pilot basis. 

 The BRTS does not require separate tracks like other rapid transit systems. Under the system, specially-designed, low-floor or elevated platform buses ply on dedicated lanes on existing roads.

 The introduction of a kilometre of the BRTS requires an investment of Rs 5 to Rs 20 crore. It costs between Rs 100-200 crore to set up a kilometre of underground railway.

 Acting on a recommendation by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme (TRIPP) of IIT Delhi made a presentation to the chief minister on implementation of the BRTS. A modified report was submitted to the chief minister on Tuesday after incorporating the changes suggested by him, said chamber president Aloke Mookherjea.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said at the annual general meeting of the chamber on Tuesday that he would carry the process of implementation forward and the project would be taken up on a pilot basis.

 The system has been introduced on a 3.5-km stretch in Pune. It will be introduced on another 65 km at a cost of Rs 600 crore. New Delhi will have 120 km of the BRTS by 2010. Ahmedabad will implement the system over 58 km at a cost of Rs 500 crore, Indore over 12 km for Rs 98 crore, Bhopal over 22 km, Jaipur over 18 km and Hyderabad over 17 km, stated TRIPP chair associate professor of transportation planning at IIT Delhi Geetam Tiwari.

 The report submitted on Tuesday comprises plans to implement the project on a 9.5-km stretch of Lenin Sarani, APC Road and SN Banerjee Road. The investment will be around Rs 80 crore. Sixty per cent of the funds will come from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The state government will foot the rest of the bill.

 When contacted, the principal secretary of the transport department denied knowledge of the proposed project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New hepatitis drug

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With over 40 million people estimated to be infected with Hepatitis B in India, the city, with a large percentage of its population on the move, is vulnerable to this silent killer. A recent study has concluded that the disease in some way affects nearly 10 per cent of the citizens.

 The conventional treatment consists of a course of interferons and anti-virals. Recently, however, a new form of therapy has been developed, involving pegylated interferons. Patients have been found to respond quicker to the new treatment.

 Pegylated interferons are in the process of changing Hepatitis treatment. It is far more convenient to administer and has proven to be more effective, said Mahesh Goenka, gastroenterologist from Apollo Hospitals. 

 Pegylated interferons have the advantage of reaching the liver faster than standard interferons and requiring only one injection a week.

 Pegasys, the newest Hepatitis C product, is delivered by a weekly subcutaneous injection. It has been patented by Roche.

 The chronic form of Hepatitis B affects more than 350 million people worldwide. The number of cases of Hepatitis C is also assuming alarming proportions. Approximately 30 per cent of HIV patients in northeast India simultaneously suffer from Hepatitis C. 

 Goenka stressed: Even among physicians, there must be awareness on whom to treat, when to treat and how to treat. All the high-risk groups should be screened. Any abnormalities in liver function tests must be thoroughly probed and investigated for Hepatitis B and C.

 The doctor pointed out that the figures for Calcutta are worrying. Roughly four per cent of Calcutta is infected with Hepatitis B, while two per cent are infected with Hepatitis C.

 All for a stylish splash

Trendy suits and funky accessories make 

swimming a fun feast for the tiny ones. Anumita Ghosh runs a rack check

 Back home with a mud-splattered uniform, gobbling up an ice-cream just before the exams, getting wet in the rain, glued to the favourite cartoon channel while homework takes a backseat, smashing the vase that you so cherished ? all in a days work for your tiny tot.

 While all this can bring out the Hitler in you (seeing it through the childs eyes, of course), theres something you can do together this season that can leave you both smiling ? taking a plunge into the nearest swimming pool.

 But make no mistake ? for your little one, making a splash could be as much about staying fit as about doing it in style. The water, you see, is both for fun and fashion.

 Just like he/she decides on a party dress in sync with the style trends, theres no stopping the little ones when it comes to choosing swimwear ? the right style, the latest cuts and the trendy colour.

 Infants to early teens, the market is flooded with stylish kids swimwear and accessories, making swimming a cool affair.

 From Rs 100 to Rs 700, there are varieties to suit every pocket. GoodLife swims through the trends, themes and more.

 Trend talk

 With magazines and television channels, children follow beauty pageants closely from an early age. Little girls just freak out on bikinis and frock styles, says Prashant Arora, proprietor of Cott Corner at AC Market on Shakespeare Sarani.

 Agrees Manjari Almal, co-owner of Lilliput at The Enclave, Alipore: Children love the designer element in their swimsuit and can carry off a bikini in style. Parents today are not the conservative kind, and they hardly object... Since swimming is a daily affair, children are not satisfied with just a pair of swimsuits, but would rather sport something different regularly.

 And parents dont mind dishing out those extra bucks, points out Shiv H. Daswani from Little Shop at Forum.

 When it comes to colour, cheerful shades rule. So shop racks are stocked with sunny lemons, electric blue, fluorescent pink and so on.

 Since the look factor is top priority, they go for colours that are striking contrasts to the blue pool, says a spokesperson for Guddi at AC Market.

 Cartoon characters and nature patterns find favour. While some come adorned with a cute little Minnie Mouse or a smiling baby elephant, some have bright flowers and fruit prints.

 Market watch

 At shops in AC Market, swimwear in stretch material comes in V-shape, shorts style, frock style, skirt-top style and shorts-top style. These come adorned with waves, flowers, cute little dragons and Hello Kitty motifs in a riot of colours. For boys, the trunk style or tight shorts rule. Stone-wash finish and abstract prints are the hits here.

 Little Shop in Forum is home to imported suits in lycra that come in V-shapes and has Winnie the Pooh up to various tricks, frock style with laces and more. For boys there is swimwear from the brand Lobster. Infants and one-year-olds can flaunt skin-friendly cotton beachwear.

 The imported suits at Lilliput at The Enclave stand out for their super fashionable twist in the form of patchwork and aquatic prints with motifs of Little Mermaid, sea horses, shells and more.

 The quality and designs make them stand out from the local varieties, says Manjari. Those with belts and white buckles are definite eye-catchers.

 Bath robes in pastel hues of baby pink, ice blue and more are on offer at most stores. So a dip can be followed by an easy soak. Some with pockets have pandas and elephants on them.

 Add-ons

 Swimming fashion doesnt end at a trendy suit. An entire range of fashionable accessories like caps, swimming goggles, ear plugs and armbands complete the pool picture.

 The caps come in varied shades to match the swimsuit. At Guddi, the caps have whales splashed on them. The goggles with bands attached at the back have circular rims. At Little Shop, you have Speedo caps and goggles. 

 Water getting into the ears shouldnt be a deterrent anymore, for ear plugs at Little Shop and Cott Corner will provide the necessary protection.

 Freestyle, backstroke, butterfly? when these get tiring, a lazy float can be quite relaxing. Floating tubes shaped like crabs, ducks and tortoise at Nik Nish will help your little one do just that. Other floating aids include armbands and long floating mattresses. Those with backrest allow the child to sit and wade through. These come in Bunny and Hello Kitty shapes. 

Do and dont

 Armed with the fashion gear and fun accessories, your child is ready to make a splash. But make sure he/she follows a few do and dont basics to ensure that his/her skin and hair are not affected by the chlorinated water. 

 For kids under 12, regular moisturising and shampoo after a swim should be enough, says beauty expert Rita Mohan. She draws up a skin and hair care regimen for GoodLife.

 To avoid sun tan, use a sunscreen before you 

enter the pool. Follow it up by washing your face with a face wash and applying 

moisturiser.

 A gentle face massage with milk helps guard 

against the chlorine.

 Oil your hair well before you enter the pool 

and shampoo after the swim. Thorough conditioning is a must for kids with naturally 

rough hair.

More than 175 different styles of footwear and 500 

styles of apparel and accessories spread over 10,000 sq ft across three levels...

The Reebok Arena Store on Sarat Bose Road is the largest 

in Asia, offering a never-before shopping experience to the 

consumer, in terms of the global product profile, depth of product range in footwear, 

apparel and equipment and the manner in which the product offering is made.

We believe the consumer doesnt evaluate 

each product as a standalone item, analysing its features and benefits. Rather, 

he/she asks how each product fits into the overall consumption situation and the 

experience provided by the consumption situation. So, for us, it was but a natural 

step to move in this direction of experiential marketing, Subhinder 

Singh Prem, managing director, Reebok India Company, tells GoodLife.

The mammoth outlet (franchisee Ankush Commercial) 

has exclusive zones for men, women and kids, besides live DJ and the Kreate 

your own Shoe section. The broad product categories are footwear, apparel, 

accessories and equipment, across lifestyle, performance 

and fitness ranges.

As an organisation, we are growing at a scorching 

pace and expanding our retail reach rapidly. In 2006, we have opened one store 

every second day. At present, we have 400 exclusive stores, 200 shop-in-shops 

and 1,500 multi-brand outlets. The Arena Store is an effort in that direction 

where the customer can consume the brand holistically, explains Sajid Shamim, 

director marketing.

The store promises to take shopping entertainment 

to the next level with live DJ during peak shopping hours, half pipe 

for skateboarding outside the store, stimulated retail concepts like Stay Fit, 

Technology Stories 

At the Kreate your own Shoe section, one 

can customise and design a shoe to his/her liking, choosing from a wide array 

of leathers, laces, soles and styles and the shoe will be delivered in 21 days.

But why pick Calcutta for the Arena Store? East 

and specifically Calcutta is a growing market for us, so much so, that we have 

doubled our business here in the last one year. We believe the city is set to 

become the next IT/bio-technology destination of the country, says Shamim.

Reebok has very aggressive plans for Calcutta 

and the east, to expand consumer touch-points and deliver a truly international 

experience. We hope to nurture the market further and bring more exciting 

concepts and formats to Calcutta, promises Prem.

The brand intent: The consumer should feel and 

profess that Reebok is the brand that fits me.

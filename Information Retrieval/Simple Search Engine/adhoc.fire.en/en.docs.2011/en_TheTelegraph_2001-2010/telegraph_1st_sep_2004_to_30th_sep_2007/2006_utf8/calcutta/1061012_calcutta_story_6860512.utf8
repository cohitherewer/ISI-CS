 Directors cut: Parambrata Chatterjee

 Actor-turned-director Parambrata Chatterjee is set for his most ambitious directorial venture. Having bagged a slot on Zee Banglas Robbarer Bioscope, Parambrata will be scooting off to Pedong, near Kalimpong, with his cast and crew by the middle of this month for his fifth telefilm, titled Bhul.

 Starring Tota Roy Chowdhury, Bidipta Chakraborty and 13-year-old Rohit Sarkar, the telefilm revolves around the life of a hitman who tries to free himself from the shackles of his past life by retreating to a life of domesticity in a hill town with his wife and son. But the past catches up before long, forcing him to face a reality that threatens to rip his peaceful life apart.

 Parambrata, who has penned the story, is also planning to rope in director Kaushik Ganguly for a special role. That would be the surprise element in the film, says Parambrata. The film is a sort of thriller that also lends an insight into the fact that however much one may try to erase ones past, it keeps coming back, again and again.

 Back from the hills after his telefilm shoot, Parambrata will be ready to take on the lead role of Animesh in Goutam Ghoses adaptation of Samaresh Mazumdars Kaal Bela for Doordarshan.

 But his latest resolution is to cut down on telesoaps and serials. I have already reduced taking on too many television projects and want to concentrate on feature films now. I can never sever ties with television because that has been my platform, but I am trying to be more prudent about my choices, he explains.

 Aiming for the big screen, Parambrata is taking time out in between his shooting schedules to script the story line for his debut feature film.

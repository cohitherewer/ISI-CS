 ?Spy? had culled dossier on army

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Waqar Salim, arrested on Monday and accused of being a Pakistani spy, had a front-row seat at the army parade on Red Road on Republic Day.

 This came to light during the interrogation of Salim, along with his city-based aide Ainul Haque. The latter was held at the Esplanade depot on Monday, while he was waiting for a bus to Basirhat. He was headed for Dhaka.

 Salim was arrested in Howrah. Police claim he is an agent trained by the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). 

 ?He obtained the pass to the parade from Haque. After minutely observing the army show of strength, Salim prepared a short report mentioning the names and capacity of the weapons displayed. He would have e-mailed the information to Pakistan,? stated an officer of the detective department.

 According to police, the duo had been assigned by the ISI to collect information related to the army. Salim had been put through rigorous training in Karachi to prepare him for the job, they added.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I), detective department, said: ?Salim sneaked into India through the border with Nepal in mid-2003 without any valid documents. He stayed in a number of cities in north India for a year-and-a-half. During this period, he assumed the name of Suraj Chowdhury.?

 The electronic engineering diploma-holder from Karachi had started to suspect that the intelligence agencies were on the lookout for him. ?So, he fled to Bangladesh through the Petrapole-Benapole border in North 24-Parganas in early-2005 and stayed there till December,? added an officer of the detective department.

 ?In Bangladesh, he worked in camps backed by the ISI. He was then asked to visit Calcutta and gather information about the army?s eastern command headquarters,? the officer continued.

 ?Salim entered the city on December 24 through Basirhat and got in touch with Haque,? said deputy commissioner Singh.

 The documents seized from Haque indicate that Salim had collected information about the army bases in eastern India and was sending the data to Dhaka.

 Police are searching for two aides of the duo.

 Walk a day wont keep doc away

 - Physical exertion beyond tolerance level can be fatal, warn physicians

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Alls not well with the morning walk. For, a few brisk steps to begin the day could aggravate, rather than allay, ailments. They could even prove fatal if certain basic guidelines are not followed.

 A case in point is a 52-year-old resident of Salt Lake, who died a few weeks ago of a cardiac arrest within half an hour of completing his morning walk. Cardiologists often get patients, especially those above 45, with complaints of breathlessness, palpitation and chest pain after a walk.

 A common feature among them is exercise intolerance or physical exertion, which includes a morning walk, beyond the tolerance level of an individual, said Kunal Sarkar, cardiac surgeon at Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences. People should be encouraged to exercise but they must assess their physical condition first.

 Doctors and fitness experts have been warning morning-walkers against overstressing themselves. Walking above the tolerance level can cause serious complications, warned Saikat Chandra, city-based wellness management consultant. Most people do not follow some simple guidelines, like a thorough medical check-up, which can help avoid a lot of trouble,

 According to Chandra, a beginner used to a sedentary lifestyle should start with around 10 to 15 minutes walk each day and increase it by 10 to15 minutes every week. At the end of four to six weeks, the walk span should be around 45 minutes.

 Adequate fluid intake before and during a walk is a must, said orthopaedic surgeon Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta. As one loses body fluid during a walk, it is imperative for the walker to hydrate himself, he pointed out.

 Walking gear is of vital importance. Preetom Mukherjee-Roy, fitness expert with Solace gym, prescribes the right kind of shoes (faulty footwear causes knee injury), lots of water and not stepping out on an empty stomach. One must drink water every eight to 10 minutes while walking, said Preetom, adding that a morning walk on an empty stomach can cause dizziness and even loss of consciousness.

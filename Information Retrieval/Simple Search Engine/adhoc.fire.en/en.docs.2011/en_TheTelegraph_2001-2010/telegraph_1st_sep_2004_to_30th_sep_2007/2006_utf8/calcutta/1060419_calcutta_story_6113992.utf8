 Depressed with the perfunctory nature of urban existence, which appears to him to be devoid of all emotion, intensity and energy, painter Manoj Mitra seeks escape into a realm of beauty, romance and happiness. The ongoing exhibition of his paintings finds the artist attempting to dissociate himself from the clamour and commotion of modern life and seeking solitary refuge in an imaginary faraway land of the idyllic past. His preoccupation with nature is an important and interesting feature of his recent works. Expressing his desire to experience bucolic bliss through images redolent with the fragrance of fresh flowers and the rain-soaked earth, he conveys, at the same time, man?s own folly in alienating himself from nature and the urgent need to restore ecological balance. His portrayal of serene, delicate-looking female figures symbolising purity and innocence expresses his regret at the passing away of a time when these virtues prevailed.

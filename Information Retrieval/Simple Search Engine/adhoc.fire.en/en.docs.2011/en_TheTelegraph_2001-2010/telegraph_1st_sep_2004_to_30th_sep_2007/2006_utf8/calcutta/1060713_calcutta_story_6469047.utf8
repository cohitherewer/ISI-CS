 SHAUN KENWORTHY

 Me and my wife have just spent the past week in England. I decided to fly with Emirates this time to break that long tedious flight to London and connect to Manchester from there. 

 I cant tell you how much better it was with only an hour and a half each way for flight connections. 

 We had glorious sunshine the whole week and 25-33O C everyday, which is something you dont quite expect. I even came back with a bit of a suntan, which was even more unexpected. 

 Sadly, the main reason for us going back was to attend my grandfathers funeral (but I suppose 87 aint a bad innings for someone who worked in factories all his life and used to smoke about 60 cigarettes a day for 50 years of his life). Enough said. 

 The UK food scene has come a long way in the past 15 years. The supermarkets are stacked high with everything you could ever imagine from all corners of the globe, but it has to be said that the amount of packaged and processed foods is becoming too much. 

 Aisle after aisle in the supermarket is packed with the stuff. And the TV is crammed with cookery shows, almost a foodie voyeurism! Everyone you speak to is hooked on, but it seems that very few people really have the time to cook anything! 

 I got around to making biryani one day that a few of us enjoyed al fresco ? by the way, the spices I got there from the Indian supermarket just didnt come up to local standard in the freshness and fragrance ? watching the England and Portugal match in the garden with a nice bottle of Chardonnay. 

 The biryani was great and all thoroughly enjoyed it (which was more than what could be said for the game). A friend was quite shocked ? saying the biryani was nothing like the one they were used to from the local Indian takeaway that came with red, white and green coloured rice, garnished with an omelette, a slice of tomato and cucumber and with a choice of either korma or Madras Curry sauces!...

 Im giving a recipe this week for an east-meets-west dessert as I am still on the India-England inspiration high. Its dead easy to make at home and the portions will easily feed four.

 Bruschetta of Butter-fried 

 Mangoes with Mishti Doi and Almonds

 Peel and remove the stones from four (not overly ripe) mangoes, slice them and set aside (this would work as well with plums, peaches, strawberries or apples). 

 Then take a nice crusty French loaf and slice into 1-inch thick slices cut at a 45O angle, butter on both sides and sprinkle with a little sugar and ground cinnamon. Set aside again. Lastly slice a few almonds and roast them a little until golden brown and once more, set aside.

 To assemble: Heat a non-stick pan over a medium flame and place the slices of bread. Cook on both sides until golden brown and the sugar has started to caramelise. 

 Remove from the pan and place one slice in the centre of each plate. Place the pan back onto the flame and add 2 tbs each of butter and sugar. Stir this continuously until the butter and sugar start to caramelise. 

 Add the mango and toss briskly for about one minute until the sugar has dissolved. (At this point you could throw in some alcohol if youre feeling a bit frisky, something like peach schnapps would be fabulous). Spoon the mangoes over the Bruschetta and top it with a good dollop of Mishti Doi (vanilla ice cream would be great too!) and sprinkle over the nuts. You wont be disappointed.

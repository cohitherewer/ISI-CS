 Colour, canvas and nature, passions 

 that Chandrani Bhaumik nurtured since childhood. The 26-year-old 

 left no stones unturned to live her dreams to the fullest, 

 that of doing something creative, something on her 

 own. Today Chandrani is the proud creator of Muniyas, 

 a designer label that was unveiled at Outram Club on Friday.

 Just another fashion label by 

 just another designer? No way. For Chandrani or Muniya, 

 as she is popularly known among friends and family, is the 

 perfect example of talent against all odds. Being speech-and-hearing 

 impaired since birth, the Kala Bhavan pass-out expresses 

 herself through her clothes, treating textiles, weaving 

 tapestry and painting. As a kid, Chandrani spent hours 

 with her box of crayons and colour pencils. She was a perfectionist. 

 Her colours would hardly stray from the pencil outlines, 

 says Nandini Sinha, Chandranis mother. 

 After Madhyamik, Chandrani got 

 through Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan, and there was no looking 

 back. Armed with a first class in Bachelor of Fine Arts 

 (diploma) in textile design and a first class in Masters 

 of Fine Arts (diploma) with specialisation in weaving, the 

 debutante designer loves experimenting with vegetable, chemical, 

 natural and acid dyes, embellishments, weaves and block 

 printing. She takes pride in creating her own blocks. While 

 at Kala Bhavan, Chandrani further mastered techniques of 

 dyeing and weaving at the institute of Weavers Service 

 Centre at Santiniketan. 

 Speaking of Chandrani, Nandini 

 says: Academics was more of a struggle with people 

 doubting her capabilities often, but at the art college, 

 she was never underestimated. Her professors pushed her 

 to do her best. She adds: Initially Chandrani 

 was interested in animation and graphics, but her professors 

 influenced her to specialise in weaving. A decision 

 that helped her to work better with fabrics once she started 

 fashion designing. 

 Chandranis tryst with fashion 

 designing took off full-time after meeting Calcutta-based 

 designer Chhuti back in 2002. Chhuti unfolded the 

 unlimited scopes in fashion, the array of mediums and the 

 wonders you could create with fabrics. She also guided her 

 through the nuances of this field and the finer aspects 

 of commercialisation, adds Nandini. Chhuti, on the 

 other hand, believes all this was possible because 

 Chandrani is really hardworking. She will do great in future. 

 The young lady, who will scribble 

 artistically on anything she lays her hands on, has been 

 quite busy since last year. Juggling visits to emporiums 

 and markets to choose fabrics, finalising designs, grasping 

 the fabric falls, spending time at her Southern Avenue and 

 Santiniketan workshops and marriage that happened in November 

 2005. Her other engagements include training two others 

 in block printing and stitching. 

 Wearable clothes is 

 Chandranis focus. Muniyas offers an array of 

 kurtis, salwar suits, and dupattas. The fabrics 

 used are mostly khadi, tussar and tussar-cotton blend. From 

 sea green to ochre to browns to whites, the colours are 

 close to nature with occasional purples and reds. The design 

 scheme is more of foliage illustrations too. The look is 

 further accentuated with batik, applique, sequins 

 and bandhni. Intricate kantha work lends the 

 kurtas and shirts for men a rich look. 

 Her next collection with geometric 

 patterns and an interesting colour palette promises to be 

 quite different from this pre-Puja collection. As of now, 

 Chandrani is eagerly awaiting a positive response from her 

 first exhibition at Rotary Sadan, which is scheduled to 

 be unveiled on September 1 at 5 pm and continues till September 

 3. The timings are 2 pm to 8pm. After the exhibition, Chandrani 

 plans to retail from Vasundhara, Block 2, 204 NSC Bose Road. 

 Apart from the clothes line, the 

 three-day exhibition will also showcase framed tapestry 

 woven on handloom, bed and table linen, cushion covers, 

 bags and kalamkari lampshades. 

 Talking about Chandranis 

 future, Nandini says that her daughter dreams of opening 

 a boutique one day. Till then it is working hard with colours 

 and fabrics, studying the market and living life to the 

 fullest.

 Science City will celebrate 2007, the International Year of Planet Earth, by adding to its list of attractions. 

 A Terra Dome is set to come up in the vacant space close to where visitors get off the cable cars near the Dynamotion Hall. 

 The igloo-shaped building will house all kinds of information about our planet, said Ingit Mukherjee, director-general, National Council of Science Museums, of which Science City is a part.

 The architects plans are awaiting sanction. The project should be ready by the middle of 2007, said T.K. Ganguly, director, Science City. 

 The dome will cover around 1000 sq m and be about 12 m high. There will be a huge globe at the centre and the two floors will be positioned in a way that viewers will be able to access the two hemispheres by turns. 

 The air-conditioned Earth centre will have some of the most hi-tech equipment ever.

 We are also trying to establish VSAT connectivity, so viewers can get updated news of research findings in different corners of the globe, said Mukherjee.

 Parallel salve for patients

 The focus of the anti-quota protests on Monday shifted from Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital to Medical College and Hospital, where agitating students and junior doctors ran a parallel outpatients? department (OPD), causing confusion among patients.

 Youth for Equality, which has been spearheading the protests across the country, announced on Sunday that it would not allow the OPDs of the two hospitals to function on Monday and Tuesday and would run parallel services to avoid patients? inconvenience.

 The OPD at National Medical College, where protesters have been on a relay hunger strike for the past few days, was not affected.

 At Medical College, the agitators tried to close down the OPD but were resisted by the Junior Doctors? Council and a section of patients.

 The agitators later created a human wall at the OPD entrance and prevented patients from stepping in. The official OPD wore a deserted look, but the parallel one, run by around 40 junior doctors, was crowded with patients.

 ?I came with my four-year-old cousin, who suddenly developed rashes all over his face. As I was denied entry into the official OPD, I had to bring him to the parallel one,? said Farida Jubeen, a resident of College Street.

 While Farida reluctantly yielded to the pressure from the agitators, Purnima Jaiswal, a resident of Bowbazar, took away her ailing mother without visiting either unit.

 ?I brought my mother here as her asthma intensified alarmingly over the past couple of days. The agitating doctors insisted that I take her to the OPD run by them,? she said. ?But what guarantee is there that the hospital will accept the ticket issued by Youth for Equality if my mother needs hospitalisation later? I prefer taking her to some other hospital.? 

 Her fear seemed justified, as the hospital?s deputy superintendent A.N. Biswas said: ?The OPD run by the protesters is illegal. But unless patients lodge a complaint, it is difficult to take action.?

 Some patients, however, expressed satisfaction over the functioning of the parallel OPD. ?Normally, I have to wait for hours before a doctor can attend to me at the OPD. But today, the entire process was over within 10 minutes at the parallel unit,? said Bimal Chandra Majumdar, a resident of Talbagan Colony, on the northern fringes of the city.

 ?The parallel OPD will continue and we will further intensify our protests against reservation,? said Avrojit Raha, a final-year student at Medical College and a member of Youth for Equality. The scheduled 24-hour hunger strike that started at 6 pm on the Medical College campus will continue for 48 hours, he added.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra on Monday admitted that services were affected at government hospitals because of the agitation, but denied that work had come to a standstill. ?No one?s interests have been harmed so far. The protesters should not disrupt work. We will decide our stand after receiving Delhi?s guidelines, but not before discussing the issue with all sections.?

 CPM state secretary Biman Bose, too, appealed to junior doctors and medical students to call off the agitation.

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Southeast Asia is pass?. This summer, Calcuttans are gearing up to explore newer tourist destinations.

 If flight bookings for the season starting May are any indication, the favoured stops are Australia, West Asia and some European cities.

 Tourism industry sources attribute the change in choice to a host of factors ? withdrawal of two airlines, launching of one and the popular stops in southeast Asia reaching a saturation point.

 Malaysian Airlines and Jetstar Asia, both flying to southeast Asia, have withdrawn operations from Calcutta, while Emirates has launched its six days-a-week service from the city to Dubai and other places.

 ?People are still buying tickets for Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and other places in Southeast Asia, but there is a great demand for destinations in Europe, Australia and West Asia,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 According to him, while the ticket prices on the southeast Asia route have gone up by more than 20 per cent on an average, there are attractive offers from other sectors. 

 ?Tourists are not preferring to pay more and go to the destinations they have already visited,? Punjabi pointed out.

 ?Against a 20 per cent growth in passenger traffic to Australia and New Zealand this year, there has been a 40 per cent rise in bookings for European cities like London and Rome,? said Bharat Mahadevan, manager (east) of Singapore Airlines. 

 The airline has dropped its Internet booking price for tickets to Australia from Rs 32,000 to Rs 20,000 (excluding tax). The offer is valid till May 31.

 Thai International Airways officials said there has been a 30 per cent growth in passenger traffic to Australia. ?People are still visiting Singapore, Thailand and Kuala Lumpur. But they want to explore new places, too,? said S.C. Kapur, district sales manager (eastern India) of the airline. 

 ?There is also a rise in leisure traffic to China, which till recently had been largely the destination of only business people,? Kapur pointed out. The Far East, once a must-stop for only traders and manufacturers who would take part in the various trade fairs and exhibitions, is fast emerging as a tourist destination.

 The West Asian stops drawing crowds are Dubai, Sharjah, Muscat and Bahrain.

 A number of passengers are also booking tickets on the Calcutta-Dubai-London route, with a free stay in Dubai. ?This is a new route, about which we are getting a lot of queries from passengers,? said a city-based travel agent.

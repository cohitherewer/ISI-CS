 Inspirational insights

 In a world that is increasingly becoming antagonistic, insular and prejudiced, Nandikars plays make persistent effort to restore the light of faith, confidence and optimism in our lives. This evening, it stages two simple, fable-like stories by Leela Mazumder, that carry a message of abiding, unconditional love, kindness, hope and inspiration for children and adults alike. Pakhi (direction: Swatilekha Sengupta) illustrates, through poignant parallels, how a wounded goose which cannot fly is able to inspire a little girl with walking disability. Dulia (a scene from the play appears above) tells the heart-rending story of an old milkmaid, who is going from Doiwalla station to Dulia station by train. On her head, she carries three shiny brass pitchers, full of fresh milk for her grandfather, father, husband, daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren. Yet, when she meets some poor, hungry urchins during the journey, she instinctively feeds them the milk, as they are no less dear to her than her own family. Direction: Swatilekha Sengupta and Goutam Halder.

 Silver lining in arthritis treatment

 A STAFF REPORTER

 She was a successful young software professional. But at age 32, her career seemed headed for a premature end as she was struck by arthritis and soon became wheelchair-bound.

 But things now look brighter for her. She has undergone hip-replacement surgery at a city hospital and is back at work.

 ?Most modern facilities are now available for joint replacement surgery in the city and fewer patients are leaving the city for treatment,? said city-based orthopaedic surgeon Chandrasekhar Dhar. ?The infrastructure for such surgery in city hospitals has improved with modern operating theatres and better pre and post-surgical care,? Dhar said.

 According to orthopaedic surgeons, most modern joint implants are now available in the city. ?A few years ago, the implant available in Calcutta could help a patient to bend the knee joints at a 90-degree angle. Now, with state-of-the-art implants, the knee joint can be bent to full length and the patient can perform all normal activities,? Dhar explained. 

 The durability of these implants has also increased from an average of 15 years to 20.

 Of the two types of arthritis, osteoarthritis is common among people above the age of 55. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is prevalent even among patients in their early 20s. 

 Rheumatoid arthritis, orthopaedic surgeons say, is a disease, with genetic or hereditary factors behind it.

 Doctors feel there is a need to raise more awareness among people about arthritis. 

 ?If arthritis is not treated properly, the patient can become completely crippled. In many cases, people come for treatment too late and only after the damage is severe,? said a doctor.

 To raise awareness and set up base for proper research in the city, some leading orthopaedic surgeons have formed West Bengal Arthroplasty Society (WBAS). According to members of the organisation, the country?s first registry on joint-related problems will be started in the city.

 It will record the number of joint replacement surgeries, types, post-surgical infections, durability of implantation and other data. 

 ?The society will also undertake regular training programmes for young surgeons, hold clinical case discussions and maintain authentic records,? said Indrajit Sardar, vice president of WBAS.

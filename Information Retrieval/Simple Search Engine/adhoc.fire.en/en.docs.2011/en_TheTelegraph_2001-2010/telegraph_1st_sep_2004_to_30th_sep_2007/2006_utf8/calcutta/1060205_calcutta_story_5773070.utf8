The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 From first slip to third man

 A cricket series is on. India is playing Pakistan. The involvement level of the man on the street is very high. Such frenzy augurs well for TV viewership and thus for advertiser interest. There is a new sponsor for the series. The air time between the overs is also crowded. So everything is quite as it should be. Except one thing. There is someone who has moved away to a space on the cricket stage that appears to be close to the wing rather than the centre. Cricket in India at the turn of the century had seen the dominance of Sachin Tendulkar on the field and Pepsi off it. Sachin?s elder statesman status is well understood. What remains enigmatic is the eclipse of Pepsi as a cricket entertainer.

 For many years, every new cricket series has seen a new campaign from the soft drinks giant. Be it a dig on rivals Coca Cola and Thums Up or just a simple fun and frolic ad with celebrities. It is not that Coca Cola has remained silent. It has the Sar Utha Ke Pio campaign running in more than one incarnation. Add to this the huge publicity that has ushered in Rang De Basanti starring Aamir Khan, the stable Coke icon. The campaign has got tremendous support from this unconnected reminder campaign. So the competitive pressures on Pepsi must be huge. 

 Yet all they have currently on TV is a low-key Kareena Kapoor film. It is contextual, as it does refer to the Indo-Pak rivalry. But many feel it is obtuse, scores low on entertainment as well as star value. Even more important is the amount spent on it. In every cricket series there are some advertisers who hog the limelight and others who fill up the rest of the space. Pepsi has joined the ranks of these also rans.

 Many explanations are available. Some say winter is not the best time to advertise colas. The most plausible explanation cites the state of the Cola market. Apparently the volumes are down, so are the profits. These are critical business issues and it is quite likely that Pepsi?s withdrawal from first slip to third man is a sound business decision. However, there is just one issue. Unique associations between an event and a sponsor are rare and thus priceless. When a brand acquires the privilege, it achieves the Herculean task of raising advertising from being an expense to an investment in fixed asset. And it makes sense to nurture such assets. This is what makes the Pepsi case intriguing. 

 One is reminded of an example from the Calcutta of the 60s. Boroline, a much loved brand of this city, used to favour a few chosen Durga puja organisers by erecting gates on the streets leading to their pandal. Boroline gates soon become an icon of Durga puja in Calcutta. Boroline over the years has vacated that property. The name of the modern pan-Indian Durga Puja is cricket. One wonders whether Pepsi is going the same way as Boroline. Owning real estate in the consumer mind takes a lot of doing. Vacating it quietly betrays symptoms of marketing myopia.

 Memorial to be freed of dogs 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Acting on a Calcutta High Court order, the civic body has decided to engage an NGO to control the canine population on Victoria Memorial Hall campus and its adjacent areas.

 According to the proposal, Love-N-Care for Animals will take care of stray dogs for five years at Victoria Memorial and its adjacent areas, like Rabindra Sadan, SSKM Hospital, JL Nehru Road, Shakespeare Sarani, Park Street and the Maidan.

 We are planning to engage Love-N-Care for Animals to control the dog menace in this area. They will take around five years to clear the campus of strays, said secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall Chittaranjan Panda.

 According to a field study, the report of which has been submitted to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, there are more than 385 stray dogs in the area. If the plan works out well, the authorities hope there will be no stray dogs in the area by August 2010. 

 The dog drive will cost around Rs 1 lakh. The Victoria Memorial authorities will cough up Rs 45,000.

 Following a public interest litigation, the high court had asked the Memorial authorities to take steps to curb the dog menace.

 Chief municipal health officer Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay said the NGO would vaccinate and sterilise the strays and share 50 per cent of the expenditure. 

 We have spotted about a few dozen dogs at the Memorial. To control the dog population, we need to create a buffer zone, said Sushmita Roy, of Love-N-Care for Animals.

 Oil pump in English school: Left steps in

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state governments plans to establish control over ICSE and CBSE schools seems to be taking shape.

 In a first-ever move, the government on Thursday intervened in an internal matter of a school run by Christian missionaries in Dum Dum and promised the authorities to find a solution to the problem posed by a petrol pump on the premises.

 St Stephens School, run by the Barrackpore diocese of the Church of North India, had recently lodged a complaint with the government, alleging that the petrol station was creating environment pollution and exposing the 4,000-odd students to fire hazards. 

 The outlet is attached to the main building of the school, facing Jessore Road.

 School education minister Partha De visited the school on Thursday and discussed the matter with the authorities. I have heard about the problems faced by the school. Officials will examine the papers and take steps accordingly, De later said.

 The school authorities had let out the plot, on which the pump stands, for 10 years in 1973. The agreement was renewed in 1983. 

 But we refused a third renewal in 1993, because by that time, the number of students had increased. But the pump owner is refusing to vacate the plot, said principal H.P. Das. 

 The guardians, he added, have repeatedly approached the authorities for relocating the pump.

 Sudip Kundu, an employee of the fuel station, however, said they have taken necessary measures to ensure the safety of the students.

 The fuel station has been existing for more than three decades. The government had allowed the school to construct its new building after examining the site. Its surprising that the school is now raising this issue, he added.

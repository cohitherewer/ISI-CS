 Main hoon na: Shah Rukh 

 Khan

 You can?t keep Shah Rukh Khan in the wings for long. The superstar, who had just one release last year in Paheli, is all set to be back in a big way in 2006. Before he comes roaring on Karan Johar?s camera in Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna later in the year, King Khan will be seen in a series of commercials for the plenty of products he endorses.

 So, while his Compaq commercial ? shot by Pradeep Sarkar ? is still very fresh on the airwaves, Shah Rukh is now being seen promoting ?the world?s smallest air-conditioner?. Before you start racking your brains trying to associate an electronics giant with Bollywood?s King Khan, the product in question is Navratna Cool Talc, an extension of the Emami brand Navratna. 

 In the ad, shot by Prahlad Kakkar, Shah Rukh has his support team following him on the sets with an air-conditioner to keep the star cool between the shots. When the whole process gets a tad too cumbersome, SRK discovers Navratna Cool Talc!

 Once these small screen commitments are taken care of, Shah Rukh is slated to shoot for Shimit Amin?s Yashraj film, Chak De, where he is reportedly playing the coach of a women?s hockey team!

 Eye for an eye: Rituparna Sengupta 

 with Sudhanshu Pandey in Unns

 She may have a slew of films lined up in Tollywood, but her thumb rule in Bollywood is to win the race slow and steady. Though quite a few offers are coming her way, Rituparna Sengupta is choosing her roles carefully. Her forthcoming Hindi film Unns, tentatively slated for an April 20 release, once again features her as a woman of substance, as had Chandan Arora?s Main Meri Patni Aur Woh last year.

 Unns, the Arabic word for love, co-stars Sanjay Kapoor, Sudhanshu Pandey, Juhi Parmar and Aman Verma, and has been directed by Bhupendra Gupta.

 ?I have a very powerful role. My character goes through a wide range of emotions, which gave me a lot of scope to act,? says Rituparna. She plays Ria, a model married happily to corporate guy Rahul (Sanjay Kapoor), till she meets ex-flame Rishi (Sudhanshu), whom she had deserted when she found out he was married. To get over Rishi, Ria weds Rahul.

 The old relationship springs to life during a chance meeting and with Rahul out on tour. The consequences are disastrous ? Ria conceives, is faced with a spate of problems and decides to walk out of her marriage though her husband is willing to give it a chance.

 The matter lands up in court where best friend and lawyer (Juhi) sides with Rahul, and Ria finds an ally in Juhi?s fiance (Aman). 

 ?The film is a must-see for all married people and also those who are about to get married. It probes the sanctity of marriage and has a strong message for the young generation,? says Rituparna, busy shooting for Apabad on Wednesday. 

 After Main Meri Patni Aur Woh, the actress feels more responsible. ?I am choosing my roles carefully because I want to make a mark in Bollywood and I am in no hurry,? stresses Rituparna.

 Jingle genius: A. R. Rahman

 After Airtel, it?s going to be Worldspace satellite radio for A.R. Rahman. The music genius, still basking in the glory of the chartbusting soundtrack of Rang De Basanti and the opening of The Lord of the Rings on stage earlier this week, has been signed as the Indian brand ambassador by the global leader in satellite-based digital radio services.

 As part of Worldspace satellite radio?s advertising and promotional activity ? designed to reach music lovers across the country ? Rahman will produce an exclusive song and will also endorse its associated products. ?We are delighted to partner with A. R. Rahman, as he is world-renowned for bringing global rhythms and Indian tunes together to create a distinctive international sound,? Shishir Lall, managing director of Worldspace India, said about the tie-up. ?Our association with him fits our goal perfectly, as we set out to define the future of radio in India.?

 For Rahman, it?s about bonding with the best. ?It is my pleasure to be associated with a brand that provides such an extensive range of music, with over 40 dedicated channels that showcase a bouquet of genres from Carnatic music to hip-hop,? he said.

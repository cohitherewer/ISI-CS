 Pop pick: Shah Rukh Khan

 The Sabsey Favourite Kaun Awards on STAR Gold, which recognises a star just on his or her popularity rather than one performance, has gone international this time. And Shah Rukh Khan, who has been winning the Sabsey Favourite Hero award for the last three years, is getting most of the votes from places like London and Dubai.

 I would be upset with all my fans if I was not leading the polls, says Shah Rukh. Sabse Favourite is a special award for me as it makes me feel wanted in the industry and by the people who watch my films. I dont want to ever lose the top spot.

 While Shah Rukh has been garnering all the international votes, Hrithik Roshan and Salman Khan have emerged as the national favourites. Says Hrithik: I would love to win the award as it would mean that not just my performance in one film but my work throughout the years would have been appreciated.

 Amitabh Bachchan is the clear favourite in small towns of India and has almost double the votes of his closest competition but son Abhishek has fallen after the release of Dhoom:2. I dont think anyone can compete my Dad, says Cub B. I could never imagine winning in any competition where my father was also part of the same category.

 As to who actually wins the Sabsey Favourite Hero will be known this Sunday when the Sabsey Favourite Awards are given away in Mumbai. The awards night will be telecast on December 30 on STAR Gold.

 Taking over: Shilpa Saklani on the 

 sets of Fame X

 After soaps and serials, now there is a replacement on a reality show. Shilpa Saklani will take over from Sophie Chowdhury as the host of SABs Fame X. While the official reason being given by Vikas Bahl, business head of SAB, is Sophie was not connecting with the viewers as well as the 14 contestants, sources on the sets say that it is the MTV VJs attitude that got her thrown out of the show. 

 Sophie used to throw her weight around and demanded to be treated like a diva, reveals the source. She always had a time constraint for shooting in spite of giving dates for the show. She also forgot her lines and kept speaking in English all the time and thats not done on a Hindi channel.

 The new host Shilpa has no such problems and her recent hosting stint on STAR Pluss Mera Star Superstar is coming in handy. I am not aware of what happened before I joined the show, she told Metro. I am absolutely elated to be coming on board.

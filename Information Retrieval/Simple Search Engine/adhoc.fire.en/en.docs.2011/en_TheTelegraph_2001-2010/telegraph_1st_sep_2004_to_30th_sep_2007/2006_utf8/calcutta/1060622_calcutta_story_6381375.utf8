 Indian art, with its emphasis on minutely-crafted forms and intricate designs is distinctly different from Western art, which is dominated by massive, larger-than-life structures. Over the years it has undergone gradual transformation, the art of each era bearing traces of its historical and social influences. Yet, traditional approaches to art remain to this day. As its name suggests, Stylistic Variations, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by eminent artists, presents works in two diverse styles, traditional and contemporary. Featuring works on eternally relevant themes like nature, love, religion and man?s quest for the infinite, it provides interesting stylistic parallels that offer an important insight into the evolution of Indian art. Participating artists include Bijon Chowdhury, D.N. Brahma, Haren Das (one of his paintings appears above), Paritosh Sen, Prokash Karmakar, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Ratan Acharya, Sanat Kar, Santi Ranjan Mukherjee and Sudhansu Prasad Ghosh.

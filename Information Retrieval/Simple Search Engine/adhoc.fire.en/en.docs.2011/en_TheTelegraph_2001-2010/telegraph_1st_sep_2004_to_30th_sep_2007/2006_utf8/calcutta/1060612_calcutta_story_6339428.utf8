 Meeting overture melts students

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The deadlock at Presidency College over distribution of admission forms was resolved late on Saturday after principal Mamata Roy Choudhuri promised to convene a meeting to look into the admission procedure. 

 ?Student representatives and teaching and non-teaching staff will meet to discuss every aspect of the admission procedure. The issue of marksheets being stamped before admission forms are given will also be considered at the meeting,? said a teacher who attended the daylong teachers? council meeting that ended around 10.15 on Saturday night.

 After spending several hours in a closed room, secretary of the teachers? council Anik Chatterjee was reportedly taken ill in the evening. Soon after, the student representatives and teachers reached an agreement on the way to resolve differences, leading to withdrawal of the hunger strike.

 The students assured the authorities that there would be no further disruption in this year?s admission process.

 Members of the Independents? Consolidation-led Presidency College Students? Union had started the hunger strike alleging that admission forms were being illegally distributed by members of Students? Federation of India (SFI) and that the college administration was not taking note of the matter.

 According to Students? Union member Anirban Mondol, two out of their three demands had been addressed. 

 ?The principal had termed our protest as ?shameful and inappropriate?. We requested her to give us a written statement withdrawing the allegations, but she has refused. We do not want to create any further confusion, but we are going to continue with our protest on Monday, after the distribution of admission forms is over,? he stated.

 Another student, Priyankar Dey, claimed the principal was ready to sign a letter stating that the college administration sympathises with the students and has full faith in them. ?We do not want her sympathy. It is our democratic right to protest against a malpractice. We are only trying to make life easy for admission-seekers,? he asserted.

 The teachers, however, ruled out the possibility of furnishing a written declaration. 

 ?If the students are responsible, they will appreciate our stand and not bring up the topic again,? observed a teacher.

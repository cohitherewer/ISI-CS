 Intricate terracotta patterns, set on plywood: Rs 4,000-5,000. Small blocks set around the borders: Rs 500 a piece. The mural in front: Rs 8,000.

 Welcome to the post-Puja sale of the pandal, piece by piece.

 On Wednesday afternoon, outside Bosepukur Sitala Mandir on the Rashbehari Connector, the queue braving the downpour was not of pandal-hoppers but of buyers. The sellers also known as puja committee members were struggling to put up sold tags on every inch of the giant pandal as the Devi inside waited to embark on her final journey. 

 What was a trickle with the erstwhile Srishti in Behala showing the way in 2003 by selling its terracotta idol to a star hotel is now a flood, with the demand for pandal items growing by the year.

 In the past, a few art-lovers would turn up to pick up odd pieces. But this time, its a craze. From Navami, people have been coming in to book their favourite pieces, said Samir Sutradhar of Bosepukur Sitala Mandir. A group from Chandernagore wanted to pick up the entire pandal for Jagaddhatri puja, quoting Rs 3.5 lakh. But we realised it would be difficult and turned down the offer.

 Haridevpur 41 Pally had no such problems. The tribal comb-clad pandal will make its way to the Jagaddhatri puja of Chandannagar Kantapukur Sarbojanin. They are taking 80 per cent of the structure, made of bamboo slices, for about Rs 60,000, said coordinator Dipankar Chatterjee. 

 This recycling revenue stream will be utilised for our orphanage and for the running of the club, he added.

 The story is no different at Avijan Club in Haridevpur, where the pandal was the creation of art college students. The price tag on the idol is around Rs 25,000 and on the pandal around Rs 65,000.

 The buyer brigade stormed Kalighats Badamtala Ashar Sangha on foot and Matador, to take away the dolls, made of fibre-glass or wood by a tribal artist from the interiors of Burdwan.

 Among them was Pushpita Mukherjee, a research scholar working on dolls and the vanishing tribal art forms of Bengal. You dont get to see these dolls, made of ropes and straw, these days and I have bought them as they form a part of my work, revealed the resident of Behala.

 The buy-it-all bonanza makes business sense for most puja committees, but not all. We never sell any part of our pandal on principle, stressed Hillol Bose of Ajeya Sanghati, in Haridevpur.

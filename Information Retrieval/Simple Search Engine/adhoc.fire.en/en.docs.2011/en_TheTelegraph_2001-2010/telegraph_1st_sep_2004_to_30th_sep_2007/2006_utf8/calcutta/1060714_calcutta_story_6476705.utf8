The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Though a child at heart, you have no time for superficial 

 people; you prefer those whose lives have purpose and direction. 

 Many of you are homebodies and private persons. You have 

 the ability to know when to make concessions, and are mellow 

 in the role of a mediator. Always practical with personal 

 investments, you have a healthy respect for time and material 

 things. ? Kusum Bhandari

 We Ask You Answer

 Freedom, not for all

 Today?s question: Should all colleges with adequate facilities be granted autonomy? More responses will be published next week

Moumita Nandi,

Behala 

Whatever facilities colleges boast of, not even one 

of them should be granted autonomy. The status, privilege and dignity of a university 

degree is recognised worldwide. Even reputed colleges would struggle to acquire 

the affiliations that a university has. Degrees should never be awarded by colleges. 

Granting of autonomy would have a disastrous effect on students. 

Sohini Roy, 

Sarat Chatterjee Avenue 

Even colleges with adequate facilities should not 

be granted autonomy. If all the colleges are granted autonomy, then the universities, 

too, would effectively become colleges.

Sayan Banerjee, 

Belgachhia 

Yes. If the facilities, infrastructure and the quality 

of management and teaching of a college are good enough, the government should 

grant it autonomy. The institution would thus become free of red tape and can 

try out new ways of imparting education and evaluating students. However, the 

ability of a college to function on its own should be assessed before it is granted 

autonomy. 

Biswajit Guha Roy,

Taratala 

Colleges that have done well for 10 years or more, 

and have sound administrative infrastructure and adequate facilities deserve autonomy. 

However, the other colleges should not follow suit automatically.

Samyak Nandy, 

Bangur Avenue 

I don?t think that all adequately equipped colleges 

should be given autonomy. A college should be declared autonomous on the basis 

of its academic and placement record, ability to cope with challenges and its 

credentials.

Tuli Das,

Salt Lake 

Yes. College teachers are in closer contact with the 

students than professors in universities. Hence, they understand the potential 

of their students as well as their shortcomings. The students, on the other hand, 

find it easier to belong to a smaller institution. But at the end of the day, 

no college can make up for lack of facilities. 

Chameli Pal, 

Batanagar

Nondescript colleges have mushroomed in Bengal over 

the past three decades. As we have seen in the cases of St Xavier?s and Presidency, 

granting autonomy to colleges is more a political decision than an academic one. 

In this scenario, the assessment of facilities is susceptible to political manipulation 

since, technically, all colleges have ?adequate facilities? ? they would not have 

been recognised otherwise. Some good colleges deserve autonomy; the rest should 

remain under university control. 

Avishek ganguly, 

Howrah 

All colleges should not be granted autonomy. Their 

performance should be taken into account at first. Random autonomy grant might 

lead to malpractice. It must also be remembered that college administrators are 

sometimes held hostage by the student unions. A feasible idea would be to grant 

autonomy to a few colleges, judge their performance over a period of time and 

then decide on the next move. 

Owais Khateeb, 

College Street

Autonomy should not be granted to all colleges even 

if they have adequate facilities. If autonomy is granted to every college,the 

students might be exploited in various ways. The academic standard might also 

fall. Monitoring an autonomous colleges would be very difficult. The tuition and 

other fees might also spiral out of the reach of middle-class students, making 

education for all a mere pipe dream. 

Joydeep Chatterjee,

Shyambazar 

Certainly not. Autonomy should only be granted to 

colleges which are capable of functioning on their own.

Diptimoy Ghosh,

Salt Lake 

Some colleges might have adequate infrastructure, 

but not the other requisites of being autonomous. For example, the location of 

an institution. It is neither possible nor feasible for all institutions to be 

autonomous. If a number of colleges are given autonomy, the students will suffer 

a setback.

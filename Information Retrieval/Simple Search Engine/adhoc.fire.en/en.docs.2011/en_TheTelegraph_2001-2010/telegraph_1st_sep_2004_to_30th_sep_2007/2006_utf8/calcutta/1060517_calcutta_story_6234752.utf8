The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The Chinese goods sold in the markets are not at all dependable. Recently, 

I bought six bulbs from Chandni Chowk, and found that three of them were fused. 

Later, when I asked the shopkeeper to replace those three bulbs, he refused to 

change them saying that he did not sell such bulbs. Such incidents are on rise. 

Fake electrical goods have conquered the market and are selling like hot cakes. 

But why are the authorities silent over the whole issue ? 

 Sunil Banerjee, Kaikhali. 

 I regularly take a taxi from Bhowanipore to Lenin Sarani. Most of the days 

I have found that the fares vary from taxi to taxi. Though I take the same route 

every day, the meter readings are different and in some cases sharply higher. 

The authority concerned should regularly check taxi meters and keep a tab on the 

cab drivers.

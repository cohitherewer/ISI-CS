 For drivers, tips to tackle traffic snarls

 A common sight on the city thoroughfares. 

 Plans are afoot to set up a training centre for the 

 drivers and helpers. A Telegraph picture

 Sandip Banerjee: What are your plans to control the number of accidents on the road? Are you planning to train your drivers?

 It is very unfortunate that a few drivers are not properly sensitised to the present situation where the number of vehicles are shooting up each day, making the traffic situation chaotic. We had already conducted several workshops in our depots, where we have demonstrated to them the way to tackle difficult traffic snarls. And trust me, we have found that the training sessions were quite effective. We have also organised interactive sessions for the drivers and helpers of private buses.

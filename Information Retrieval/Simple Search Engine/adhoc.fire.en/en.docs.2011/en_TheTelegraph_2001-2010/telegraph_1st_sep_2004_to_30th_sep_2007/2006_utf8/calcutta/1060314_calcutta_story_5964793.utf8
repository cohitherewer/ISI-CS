The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Play it bright, play it right

Holi hai! As you drown in the spirit of the festival 

of colours, Metro takes you through the dos and don?ts and also tells you 

how to have a terrific Tuesday, at home or outside.

Crowd curb

Processions complying with Calcutta High Court and 

Pollution Control Board guidelines can be taken out on Keshub Sen Street, College 

Street, MG Road, parts of Mechhuabazar Street and Rabindra Sarani, Zakaria Street, 

Phoolbagan Road, Colootola Street, Eden Hospital Road, CR Avenue, Bhupen Bose 

Avenue and Watgunge Road.

Processions will not be allowed on the thoroughfare 

in front of Writers? Buildings and Lalbazar police headquarters. Processionists 

will not be allowed to carry lathis, fire or weapons.

Revelry rule

No celebrations in public places or while riding a 

truck or other vehicles; no spraying colour on policemen, army personnel or anyone 

in uniform; no keeping colours and sprinklers in open spaces; no splashing colour 

on passing vehicles; no fireworks; no use of harmful colours or spraying colours 

from highrises. Violation will lead to arrest and penalty, warn police.

Transport time

Of the 2,500 minibuses, 600 will ply from 12.30 pm; 

CSTC buses will ply from 1.30 pm till midnight; CTC buses to run after 2.30 pm.

Metro Rail services will be available between 2 pm 

and 9.45 pm, at 15-minute intervals.

Only a handful of the daily fleet of 16,000 taxis 

is expected to ply till noon. Regular services to resume after that.

Trams to start plying after 2.30 pm.

Water wellness

Additional filtered water to be supplied to south 

Calcutta, Park Circus, Kidderpore and parts of east Calcutta from 11 am, allowing 

revellers to wash the colours away.

Dry half-day

No alcohol to be served till 3 pm at pubs, nightclubs 

and hotels. After that, expect a free flow.

Screen scene

All city multiplexes ? INOX (Forum and City Centre), 

89 Cinemas (Swabhumi) and Fame (Hiland Park) ? will open for the post-noon shows. 

Going by advance bookings, Priyadarshan?s Malamaal Weekly is the movie 

to watch, followed by Memoirs of a Geisha, Taxi No. 9211 and Rang 

De Basanti.

For those reluctant to step out of home, catching 

a repeat of Sunday?s historic South Africa-Australia match on ESPN from 2 pm could 

be the best bet.

Colour care

Statutory warning: the colours that make up this carnival 

do not always have joyous after-effects, with rashes, allergies and stains that 

refuse to go.

?Colours sold at roadsides are not sanctioned by the 

government and may contain chemicals and metallic substances. Buy branded colours,? 

advises Dr Aparna Santhanam, head of medical services, Kaya Skin Clinic.

Party spirit

Done-to-death Bollywood Holi staples like Rang 

barse and Bhaang ka rang are out at this year?s Holi bash. ?The craze 

this time is Marwari songs like Pallo latke, which have a Holi feel,? says 

DJ Akash.

Tradition is taking a tumble in the drinks department, 

too. Not bhaang but beer and Breezers are the party picks. ?Bhaang 

causes a big hangover which can last for 48 hours (and Wednesday is a working 

day). Beer is also the choice for summer,? says party hopper Saket Agarwal.

Laugh out loud

The Hasya Kavi Sammelan, particularly among north 

Indian communities, is a craze at this time of the year. 

So be it professionals on stage, like The Great Indian 

Laughter Show on March 10 at Science City, or do-it-yourself joke sessions at 

home, it?s all a big laugh this Holi.

?The Laughter Challenge comedians are in great demand 

in the city? Their back-to-back shows in the past few days have been running to 

capacity crowds with Ehsaan Qureshi leading the popular pack,? says Gurpreet Kaur 

Sethi of RGV Events, who organises Laughter Challenge shows in Calcutta.

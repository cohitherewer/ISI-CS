 The City Diary

 Safiq Ali, 28, was arrested in Bhowanipore early on Sunday for allegedly molesting a four-year-old. The victim is a resident of Sambhunath Pandit Road and was missing since 1 am on Sunday. Ali reportedly said that the girl was in a taxi with him and ran away when the cops rounded him up.

 An unidentified man, in his fifties, died after being run over by a truck near HB Town, in Sodepur, on the northern fringes of the city, on Sunday morning. Police said the man was returning home from the local market. He fell on the road when the truck hit the cycle he was riding. The driver then lost control and crushed his head.

 Trinamul Congress has threatened to block EM Bypass if police fail to arrest the killers of Mohammad Kamal, a resident of Tiljala, within 24 hours. This was announced by local Trinamul MLA and councillor Javed Ahmed Khan on Sunday. Kamal, a resident of Sapgachhi First Lane, died after being beaten up by a gang last week. Khan also protested police inaction in containing drug-peddling in the area. A local youth was stabbed by a drug peddler on Saturday.

 Two youths, both drunk, allegedly entered a house on Kumud Ghoshal Road, near Dakshineswar, on Friday night and urinated in the lawn, sparking trouble in the area on Saturday. Police said the house-owner, Prasanta Chatterjee, protested as the local youths, Tuli Bera and Sunny Bera, were leaving the house. They allegedly assaulted Chatterjee and his 22-year-old daughter Manjari. Chatterjees nephew Kaushik Ganguly and Arit Ganguly were also beaten up. 

 Rahul Singh, 10, was electrocuted in Naihati, on the northern fringes of the city, on Sunday morning. Police said the boy came in contact with a live wire while returning home after taking a dip in the Hooghly. He was taken to a local health centre, where he was pronounced dead.

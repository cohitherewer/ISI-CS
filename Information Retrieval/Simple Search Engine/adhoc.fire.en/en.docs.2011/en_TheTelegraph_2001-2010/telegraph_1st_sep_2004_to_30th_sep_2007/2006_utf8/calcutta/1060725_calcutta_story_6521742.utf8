The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Creating, not be re-created

 Screen On amp; Off

 Satya star CHEKRAVARTHY turns 

 director with Darwaza Bandh Rakho. He talks to Pratim 

 D. Gupta about acting on the sets to manage 35 brats under 

 one roof

 Chekravarthy 

 No one remembers you as the college baddie JD in Shiva?

 See, Shiva was made by 

 Ram Gopal Varma in Telugu and then dubbed in Hindi. So down 

 south, I came to be known as JD Chekravarthy. You go there 

 and ask about me and they will say: ?Chekr-avarthy who?? 

 You have to put JD before my name in the south. That?s how 

 popular my cameo was after the movie released.

 How did your first Hindi film Satya happen?

 Ramuji has produced more 

 than 22 films with me in Telugu. So we were throughout in 

 touch, even though I wasn?t acting in his Hindi films. Now 

 he is not a formal person at all; he never asks, ?How are 

 you?? or asks you to ?Take care?. Once when I had just landed 

 in the US, he called up from Mumbai and asked me: ?Have 

 you reached?? I was really surprised because it was very 

 uncharacteristic of him. It was June 30 and he said: ?I 

 am starting Satya on July 4. You can come whenever 

 you want but be here before that day.?

 After Satya, Manoj Bajpai became huge but you didn?t 

 really cash in on the film despite playing Satya?

 Because I was a very busy hero 

 in the south. I had already committed to four or five films 

 when Satya was happening. So regardless of how the 

 film did, I would have been busy for the next one-and-a-half 

 years. In fact, Ramuji called me up to do another 

 film with him soon after Satya but I was in the middle 

 of a schedule at that time. 

 Aftab Shivdasani and Chunky 

 Pandey in Darwaza Bandh Rakho 

 Durga, which had the tagline ?A film by Chekravarthy?, 

 was touted as a sequel to Satya but it sank without 

 a trace...

 That was a pure gimmick because 

 I was not being able to sell the dubbed Telugu film in Mumbai. 

 The film was produced, not directed, by me. The gimmick 

 paid off half my debts. But I have no clue why Satya 

 worked and Durga didn?t. I guess it would have been 

 a bad film. It did just okay in the south.

 Why did you choose a Sushmita Sen vehicle like Vaastu 

 Shastra for your Hindi comeback?

 As I told you, I was always actively 

 involved with all of Ramuji?s projects. In the south, 

 I was either acting in his productions or writing the screenplays. 

 I even did the post-production for some of his Hindi films. 

 So, I was always a part of Factory and Vaastu Shastra 

 came up as an acting assignment. The only major change 

 from Satya was that I had to cut off my moustache 

 (laughs). 

 Was Darwaza Bandh Rakho Ramuji?s idea?

 Yes, he bounced off the idea in 

 one of the Vaastu Shastra meetings. And I just laughed 

 my lungs out. I hate to assign a genre to the movie but 

 you have to call Darwaza... a comedy. While none 

 of the characters is doing any comedy and even the situations 

 are extremely serious, the audience will find it very funny. 

 So I enjoyed the process of making a script out of the idea. 

 Now you have to see and decide whether I developed his idea 

 or screwed it up.

 Isha Sharvani in the movie 

 So, what is this big idea of Darwaza...?

 Four young guys kidnap a richie-rich 

 girl. There are no sad reasons like dahej or debt. 

 They just want to make quick money. They then randomly barge 

 into a Gujarati house. It?s here that there is a small twist 

 and they somehow can?t make the deal happen with the girl?s 

 father. Finally the whole plan goes for a toss with the 

 four having to manage 35 hostages in that house.

 What was it like helming an ensemble cast including everyone 

 from Aftab Shivdasani and Isha Sharvani to Manisha Koirala 

 and Chunky Pandey?

 It was like one big picnic. You 

 have heard that before, right? Well, for me, it wasn?t! 

 I never enjoyed doing it. You can?t, when there are 35 brats 

 under one roof. It was like an unruly classroom and I realised 

 age is no bar when it comes to being mischievous. 

 So I started acting, as if I am 

 this short-tempered director who can punch you any moment. 

 It was only towards the end they realised that I was acting. 

 Otherwise we would have never been able to finish the movie.

 So you prefer acting to directing?

 Not really. An actor is a dependant 

 person; he has to do what the director asks him to do. The 

 director, on the other hand, has the capacity to create. 

 So I prefer creating rather being re-created.

 Why not do both in the same movie?

 I didn?t want to act while directing, 

 especially when it is my first directorial venture. I wanted 

 to be a full-fledged director rather than be a part of it. 

 Also, the film didn?t require me, I could not associate 

 myself with any of the characters. And having done 50 films 

 as an actor, I was not desperate to appear in one scene.

 Has Ramuji seen your finished film?

 Yes. He had no clue how I was 

 developing the script. He had no clue how I was shooting 

 it. But I was never tense when he wanted to see the final 

 film. He would have liked it or hated it, nothing in between. 

 Now, knowing him, he had no choice to hate it because it 

 was a finished project and he couldn?t have done anything 

 (laughs).

 Darwaza... is coming a week after Omkara and 

 a week before Kabhi Alvida...

 Any good film will work regardless 

 of which film comes before, with or after it. Kisna and 

 Page 3 released on the same day and you know what 

 happened. So did Dil and Ghayal, and both 

 worked. I want all films to do well, but my film has 

 to do well.

 Where do we see you next? Behind or in front of the camera?

 I was supposed to act in a Factory 

 film called Sattu. And no, that has nothing to do 

 with Satya. That?s been postponed by a couple of 

 months. I am now working on my next film called Creature 

 which will need some time since a lot of special effects 

 is involved.

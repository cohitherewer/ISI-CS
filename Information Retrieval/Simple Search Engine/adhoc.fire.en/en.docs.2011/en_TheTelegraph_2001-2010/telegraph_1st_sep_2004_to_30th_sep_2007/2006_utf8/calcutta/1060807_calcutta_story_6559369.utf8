 For a hint of nature 

 BE IT A PRETTY ARRANGEMENT 

 WITH PETALS OR A GREEN CORNER WITH LEAVES AND TWIGS, SHRADHA 

 AGARWAL EXPLORES TODAYS TRENDS

 Flower and foliage. Beauty and 

 calm. When these two come together, its nature in 

 its purest form. On the centre table, too.

 Every story now revolves around 

 trends. Same for flower arrangements.

 GoodLife explores todays 

 trends on the green block.

 Floral forms

 There are two trends today, 

 says floral artist Baisakhi Ghosh. The first is about 

 the creation of designer sculptures and structures and the 

 second is about a casual approach, like simply stacking 

 loose flowers in a transparent vase.

 While sculptures using exotic 

 bamboo, wood or willows are more suited for commercial, 

 larger spaces, stacking loose flowers works fine for home.

 A flower arrangement should 

 look anything but an arrangement. It should be casual, quite 

 like the trend prevalent in Bengal 20-30 years ago, the 

 only difference being that glass has replaced metal vases, 

 says Baisakhi.

 Keeping it simple and casual may 

 be the way forward but a few pointers never hurt anyone.

 Here is Baisakhis do-it 

 list.

 Colour co-ordination comes first. Stark shades is not the 

 flavour of the season, whites and pastels dominate the scene.

 Dont stress on rules, instead focus on your aesthetics 

 and intuition.

 When it comes to vases, straight lines are in. Flowers like 

 herconia, bird of Paradise and long-stemmed lilies work 

 well for tall vases. For shorter ones, opt for orchids, 

 roses and carnations.

 When you want a corner arrangement, a structure to elevate 

 the flowers is a must. 

 Add drama by bending some flowers at a right angle in a 

 straight vase.

 Coloured stones, white stone chips, sand and other tiny 

 trinkets add glamour to the transparent vase. 

 Foliage fix 

 Red, yellow, white, grey and all 

 possible shades of green Still thinking floral arrangements? 

 Well, quite right, but sans flowers this time. 

 Welcome to the green world of 

 foliage arrangements. Around as a strong category in floral 

 competitions for quite some time now, foliage arrangements 

 are fast becoming popular in the city. 

 Kavita Poddar, president of flower 

 arrangers body Pushpa Bitan Society, says: Foliage 

 is equally interesting and there is a large variety available 

 to create beautiful arrangements. 

 The key ingredient here is the 

 right choice of leaves. Technically and aesthetically, there 

 are some leaves that are more suitable for arrangements 

 than others.

 Choose a combination of Erica 

 palm leaf, China palm, philodendron, dracaena, croton, aralia, 

 umbrella leaf, dried lotus leaf and also a variety of grasses.

 But whatever leaves you 

 pick, it is important to condition them, says Kavita. 

 Cut out the leaves from stalks 

 and place them in a bucket of water to which some salt and 

 sugar is added.

 at leaves like money plant and 

 other climbers need to be immersed completely to provide 

 them with the required moisture. 

 The location and occasion are 

 both important. So create something low as the centrepiece 

 on the dining table and something dominating for the bare 

 nook at home, adds Kavita. 

 Here are some of her tips.

 Decide a day in advance, because unlike flowers that you 

 can buy off the shelf, foliage is difficult to hunt down. 

 Order in advance or simply beg, borrow or steal.

 The foliage is inserted in an oasis a sponge brick soaked 

 in water for two minutes. Use an electricians black 

 tape to fix the oasis to any base steel plate, metal tray, 

 thermocol or plastic. But never insert the foliage more 

 than half-an-inch for risk of the oasis crumbling.

 Dont create a flat back in the arrangement. 

 Movement is a must, so slope a larger leaf or tilt a twig 

 but make sure that there are no straight lines at the end. 

 Asymmetrical is the key word here. Then bank on your aesthetic 

 sense.

 Apart from candles, moss, twigs and sand, use unusual natural 

 accessories like cinnamon sticks, loofahs, broken chai 

 khullars

 Remember that all arrangements hate the fan. Try and find 

 them a cool and shady place. 

 Sprinkle water regularly, once or twice a day, depending 

 on the type of foliage and the weather. Dont forget 

 to spray the leaves.

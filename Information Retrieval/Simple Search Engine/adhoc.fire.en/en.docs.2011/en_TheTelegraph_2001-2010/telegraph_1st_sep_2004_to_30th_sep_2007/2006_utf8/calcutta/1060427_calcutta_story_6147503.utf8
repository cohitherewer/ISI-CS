 An inherent fascination for China led Mala Mukerjee to travel to that country and absorb its unique appealing sights and sounds. China Diary, the ongoing exhibition of her photographs, has been strung together with a selection of her memories from the numerous scenes that she captured on her lens. With its focus on the people of China as seen from the perspective of the changes sweeping across the country, it provides an interesting insight into the impact of political changes on the sociological lives of people. Images abound of men, women and children in urban settings and rural surroundings, in many moods and pursuits, in the glamour of bright lights and in shades, and, in the glory of their past and among the inevitable contrasts of their rapidly changing present. Above all, Mukerjee has portrayed the spirit of the country and its people, caught in the travails that inexorably accompany any change that attempts to transform the quality of life of over 1300 million people.

 A hectic shoot schedule for Krishnakali kept him busy all through his 20-day stay in town, but the artist in Amol Palekar took time out after a day?s hard work to drop in for an exhibition last weekend. The display showcased the works of some young talents from Bengal in the Palladian Lounge at Bengal Chamber of Commerce. 

 ?It is very refreshing to see such lovely work on landscapes in watercolours, especially at a time when everyone?s moving at break-neck speed with not a moment to spare. It is soothing to unwind to such beautiful work. I was tempted to visit the exhibition after a hectic day only because I am a painter myself,? said Palekar, checking out the array of watercolours.

 The actor-turned-director, who wrapped up the first-leg shoot of the Doordarshan serial with a Bengali cast, is saddened by the fact that artists were often neglected. ?A collective effort should be made to bring these promising talents on a pedestal so that their works are not overlooked or unacknowledged,? he observed.

 A student of JJ School of Art in Mumbai, Palekar started his career as a painter before turning to films. And he has done much more than just dabble in painting alongside carving out a career in acting, and then direction.

 With a fascination for watercolours, Palekar has had seven solo exhibitions and finds ?refuge? in his passion for the canvas. ?People often ask me whether I prefer being a director, an actor or a painter and I say, if I can manage to imbibe all three then maybe I can weave them together and enjoy doing them all.? 

 Being a receptive artist, Palekar felt, has allowed him to ?assimilate wit, wisdom and art? in his acting, film-making and theatre.

 A firm grasp over the various art forms has also sharpened his aesthetic sense and influenced his directorial eye. ?You will always find my films very visually appealing, like Paheli,? said Palekar, who prefers to sit with the art director of his films to create the frames and colour schemes.

 One of Palekar?s favourite artists is V.S. Gaitonde, whose abstract paintings can keep him musing for hours. 

 ?I?d walk miles to take a look at Gaitonde?s extraordinary paintings just the way I?d walk miles to listen to the strains of Kishori Amonkar?s beautiful voice,? smiled Palekar.

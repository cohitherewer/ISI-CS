The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New site for IT players by March

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 The state government has finally set itself a deadline March 2007 to resolve the impasse over price and plot for the proposed development centres of Wipro, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and ITC Infotech.

 I spoke to industries minister Nirupam Sen yesterday and was told that West Bengal Industrial Development Corporations (WBIDC) land acquisition process opposite Vedic Village is on track. By March 2007, we will be able to offer land to the four companies, said state IT minister Debesh Das on Tuesday.

 With Sector V saturated and Rajarhat pricing itself out of the market, the state government has set its sights on 1,000 acres opposite Vedic Village.

 WBIDC officials were not available for comment on the status of land acquisition in the area between Rajarhat and the airport. Sources said the administration has just started the process by issuing notices to landowners.

 There is a great opportunity before Bengal today and we do not want any delay. We are confident of sticking to the schedule and handing over the site to the companies, asserted Das.

 The first choice for Wipro, Infosys, TCS and ITC Infotech was Rajarhat. Wipro and ITC Infotech had even received allotment letters. Wipro lost interest due to the price tag of Rs 2.16 crore per acre, while ITC Infotech backed out after being denied its preferred plot. Price was the peeve for Infosys and TCS as well.

 We met Wipro officials in Bangalore recently and they were keen on the plot we are offering them. ITC Infotech has also agreed on the new site, said Das, adding that talks are on with the other companies to allay their concerns about the location.

 Infrastructure, or the lack of it, in the zone opposite Vedic Village, around 10 km from the airport, has been cited as the main reason for the lukewarm response from the IT industry. 

 The state government is, however, confident that the necessary facilities will be in place before a formal offer is made to the companies.

 If we look at infrastructure, Calcutta is much better than cities like Bangalore and we need to cash in on that, remarked Das, who took part in BangaloreIT.in 2006 last week. 

 A number of small and medium IT companies eager to kick off operations in the city will also be offered land in the area opposite Vedic Village, added the minister.

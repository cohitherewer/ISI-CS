Life

 Man with a plan

 WHATS COOKING? AD Singh at Stylefile Winter Show 2006. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 His red jacket was hard to miss, even in the crowded Stylefile evening at the sprawling Sunderbans in ITC Sonar Bangla. There was also no missing his cigar. Or his charm. Meet AD Singh AD as in AD and not A.D. because the star restaurateur was born Aditya.

 In Calcutta last weekend, ADs day trip went off well. It had to, considering he spent it doing some of his favourite things (cheering wife Sabina, as she showcased some desi drama on the Stylefile Winter Show 2006 ramp, and then catching a round of golf at Tollygunge Club).

 When GoodLife caught up with him, he freewheeled about life, his likes and, yes, why its going to be a long, long wait for Calcutta to get an Olive Bar amp; Kitchen. 

 I have spent so many days in Flurys, chilling over chai or cold coffee when Arjun, my twin, was studying at IIM (Joka). Its been more than 15 years and it feels good to be back. The place has cleaned up but the traffic hasnt. It was a nightmare then, and is a nightmare now, announces AD.

 The citys fashion scene though, he feels, has improved tremendously. AD knows because he is quite clued in. First as Sabinas husband and then because most designers are at least acquaintances, if not golf buddies or friends. 

 His world of food and fashion is far removed from his electrical engineer degree or his desire to work in NGOs after studying agricultural economics. My college couldnt give me money for the last semester and I came home for a year. But I never left.

 A short stint at Cadburys later, he launched Party Lines, a party company, and then Just Desserts, a food venture he began in 1990, thanks to his sweet tooth!

 What followed was a string of other success stories Jazz By The Bay, Copa Cabaana, Soul Fry, Soul Curry, The Bowling Co. and then Olive Bar amp; Kitchen.

 The last six years have been all for Olive. He opened first in Mumbai in November 2000 and then in Delhi in 2003. I am a hands-on person and hence moved to Delhi for a year to set it all up. The culture, the ideology, and the soul of the place it has to be mine, he adds. Olive opened in Bangalore in 2005.

 Heres some bad news for Calcutta: Olive Bar amp; Kitchen is in no hurry to come calling. Olive requires a sophisticated market of diners. The numbers in Calcutta are not comparable. If the size is missing, the market wont make sense, he says. But heres some good news, too. I am working on a new brand in Delhi and that might come here soon.

 A no chef, AD says its actually better this way. No blinkers, no set thoughts, it makes me more imaginative and fun in the food biz, he says. And it works!

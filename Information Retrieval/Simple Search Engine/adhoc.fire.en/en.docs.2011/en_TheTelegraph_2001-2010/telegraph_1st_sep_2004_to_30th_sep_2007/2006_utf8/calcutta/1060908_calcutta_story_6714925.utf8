 Marriage house guideline

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Buildings near a hospital, a place of worship, an educational institution or in the midst of a neighbourhood cannot be let out for marriage or other ceremonies.

 This forms part of the guideline the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has prepared for building-owners who let out their premises for private functions. 

 The civic authorities informed the high court about the guideline through an affidavit on Thursday.

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya had earlier asked the CMC to tell the court what rules it followed while allowing building-owners to let out their premises for ceremonies.

 The guideline states that the density of population of the area has to be taken into consideration before a building is allowed for private gatherings. Besides, the buildings should have enough parking space and not encroach on roads.

 The civic authorities told the court that an association of building-owners had challenged their authority to frame such a guideline. 

 The matter is pending before the court and we are not sure whether we will be able to execute the guideline, the CMC stated in its affidavit.

 Whether its hanging out with friends on a lazy afternoon over cups of coffee or spending the evening with your lady love in some peace and privacy, the recently opened Cafe Rustica at Ocio on 5, Belvedere Road is just the place to be. 

 Situated alongside the plush greenery of the adjoining Horticulture Society, the ambience and decor of the place is what sets this 2,700-sq-ft cafe apart.

 Conceptualised on the lines of a lounge, it is tastefully created on a fusion theme. The interiors of the 40-seater cafe have been designed by master artisans from Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Mysore, Karnataka and Rajasthan. 

 We wanted to create a place that would be informal yet classy. The decor had to be done in a way that appealed to all age groups, says J.K. Seal, general manager, Ocio.

 The tabletops are made with special bell metal Kontello tiles from Orissa inlaid on the surface by hand. These are teamed with stylish wooden seaters in the form of benches on one side and plush sofas in the more private areas. 

 With neon lights fixed on wooden panels to lend a feeling of fantasy, the ceiling is done with copper bowls in a myriad colours from Bastar in Madhya Pradesh. The walls are in shades of mosaic blue on one side and glass on the other.

 The cafe has a small corner with a synthesiser and play station, two huge plasma screens on the walls on which you can even catch movies of your choice.

 With such a huge area, we could have increased the number of covers. But we didnt want to clutter the place and compromise on the privacy factor, says Seal.

 The menu is strictly vegetarian, but quite extensive. It boasts light bites from pizzas to phuchkas and an array of mocktails and coffees. We are located in a place dominated by non-Bengalis, so we decided to go for vegetarian fare, smiles Seal.

 An appealing aspect of the menu is the modest pricing. Pizzas like Margarita and Foccacia Cheese cost as low as Rs 45, while the must-pick Tandoori Masala is priced at Rs 50. 

 The sandwich section includes Coleslaw Plain Cheese Sandwich, Grilled Coriander Potato Sandwich and Grilled Vegetable Foccacia, as well as Chilli Paneer Burger, Cheese Burger and more.

 This menu perfectly suits those who come here to grab a bite in the late hours of the afternoon, mostly after college. Its tasty, healthy and not too heavy on the stomach, offers Seal. 

 If you prefer the roadside junk food, take your pick from the chaat section that serves everything, including phuchkas, dahi phuchkas, bhel puri, tikka chhola, pav bhaji and papri chaat in authentic flavours. 

 We introduced this section so that there is something for everyone, be it the pizza-loving guy or the phuchka loving girl, smiles Seal. 

 To go with the grub, there are mocktails, shakes in a host of flavours like mango, orange and strawberry, coffees and flavoured iced teas.

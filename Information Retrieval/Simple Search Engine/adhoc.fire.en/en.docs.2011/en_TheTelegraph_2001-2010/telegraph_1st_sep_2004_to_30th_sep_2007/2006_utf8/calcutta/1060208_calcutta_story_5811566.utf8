 Cassinis Division in performance at Someplace Else

 The biggest live rock act festival in the country turns 10 this year, but participation at Great Indian Rock (GIR) from this part of India has been few and far between.

 Cassinis Division is set to change that when the quartet from Calcutta ? Rahul Guha Roy, Sukanti Roy, Ritoban Das and John Bose ? takes the stage in Delhi on February 18 at the three-day festival.

 The band was among the 12 selected from several hundred entries. Besides the stiff competition, whats also special is that GIR is a competition for professional bands, says Rahul, frontman of Cassinis Division. Along with a chance to take the stage, the groups original composition Only for a While finds a place in the GIR compilation album.

 I admire Cassinis Division for their melodic sensibility and intelligent but catchy lyric writing, says Sam Lall, executive editor of Rock Street Journal, the magazine that organises GIR.

 Lall had got in touch with the band when he was in Calcutta judging The Telegraph Band Hunt last year. I learnt from them that they had sent entries for GIR earlier but somehow it didnt reach us. So I personally looked after their entry process this time, adds Lall.

 City bands Cognac, Wise? and Krosswindzs Chandrani have featured in past GIR editions.

 Formed in 2001, Cassinis Division terms its brand of music as modern rock with punk and alternative flavours.

 The members were either holding jobs or working in family business, before they decided to turn pro. We left what we were doing for a full-time career in music. We really want to build a real rock band in India, says Rahul.

 The foursome has played in music stores, coffee shops and bookstores in Calcutta, and a host of venues around the country like Uttaranchals Woodstock, the Dhanaulti Rock Festival, last year.

 But its from our weekly set at The Parks Someplace Else that we mainly earn money, says Rahul. There are album plans with around 25 compositions ready.

 The Calcutta connection apart, GIRs 10th edition will see some other specials. Each night, along with four competing bands, the festival will feature a past winner and an international band. Orange Street, No Idea and Zero will represent the GIR champs while guest acts include El Caco from Norway, Your Codename Is: Milo from the UK and Freak Kitchen from Sweden.

 The fest will also have a one-day extension in Mumbai where five of the 12 bands and Freak Kitchen will play. Its the 10th year, we have to party a little, laughs Lall.

 Water war: Dhoni vs Sania

 - CELEB FACES ADD DRAMA TO PRE-HOLI SPRINKLER SURGE

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

 on sprinklers 

 Sania Mirza gets 

 into Holi action 

 ?Dhoni dho dalega,? a chirpy hawker calls out to a couple of teenagers scouting for the right arsenal to fight this year?s Holi water war with. The Ranchi wrecker, who has fired the imagination of the cricket world this year, is being called upon to fuel the festive spirit this week.

 And keeping Mahendra Singh Dhoni company as the face of the Holi sprinkler this year is not another Team India hero but tennis heroine Sania Mirza.

 The Dhoni water guns are flying fastest off the makeshift racks in the run-up to Holi ? from Burrabazar to BD Block in Salt Lake. If the jumbo Dhoni jet comes for Rs 30, the smaller variety costs around Rs 25.

 A scan of close to 30 shops in various localities revealed just a single Sachin Tendulkar sprinkler. What about the other cricket stars? ?Baki ko woh dho dala,? comes the explanatory grin from the young Burrabazar hawker.

 But some of his compatriots are more excited about the debut of the tennis darling on the ubiquitous pichkari. ?It is not uncommon to find the faces of cricketers on sprinklers, but no tennis player has ever made it to Holi gear. Not even Calcutta?s own Leander Paes,? observes Dilip Prasad Sonkar, manning his temporary stall of colours next to his cigarette shop bordering Posta.

 Another first-timer making a surprise entry into the Holi market is boy wizard Harry Potter. ?Somehow they (the manufacturers) did not think about using such a popular character these past few years,? concedes Sonkar.

 quot;Ebarer bajaar to Dhoni aar 

 Sania-r, quot; smiles Tapan Maiti, a grocer in BD Market, 

 Salt Lake, who has added an aabir stall.

 quot;For the parents what matters 

 is which sprinkler spurts water with the least effort. It 

 is the kids who base their demand on their favourite stars 

 staring out of sprinklers, quot; he adds.

 Besides the celeb factor, the 

 variety of shapes is an eye catcher. You can start the Holi-day 

 with a toothpaste, keep the colour kitchen well-stocked 

 with a (water) cylinder, stave off the March sun with an 

 umbrella? all by picking the right-shaped pichkari.

 And if the opponent threatens 

 to dunk the daylights out of you in the water war, just 

 light a lantern. Or fight back with gunfire, backed by a 

 fire-extinguisher.

 This curious contraption, costing 

 Rs 17, resembles an extinguisher with a clip (to be attached 

 to the waistband) and is connected to a water gun by a pipe. 

 A larger version is available in Gariahat. Here, three one-litre 

 extinguishers are joined together making a formidable arsenal. 

 It has to be strapped to the back (like a school bag). quot;Load 

 in the morning, spray till evening, quot; the seller demonstrates 

 with plain water, justifying the Rs 120 tag.

 And then theres the trident. 

 quot;Kitne ka hai? quot; Chetan Agarwal from Howrah asks 

 on Mahatma Gandhi Road. quot;Children want new styles of 

 sprinklers, quot; he adds, reaching into his pocket for 

 a Rs 50 note. The stall also stocks a giant mace to monkey 

 around with.

 Television game show addicts will 

 recognise another familiar object in Holi avatar: the magic 

 pencil of Shakalaka Boom Boom fame has made it to the festival 

 of colours, complete with the crystal ball at the top, to 

 be picked up for Rs 30 or 40, depending on size.

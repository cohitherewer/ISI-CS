The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 The melody man

 When kids his age were day dreaming 

 about a doctor-lawyer-engineer type of profession, Prasant 

 A Samadher (in picture below by Aranya Sen) knew he was 

 different. I always thought there were better things 

 in life, he says. And better things he 

 found.

 A national scholarship for music at 10, extensive training at Sangeet Research Academy in Calcutta, popular Bollywood tracks in Fiza, Taal and Dhoom and several chances to share the stage with maestros like Amjad Ali Khan, Ravi Shankar, Bhimsen Joshi, Asha Bhonsle

 Prasant also loves to teach (singing sensation Shreya Ghoshal and Indian Idol star Prajakta Shukre are both his students) and he was a trainer at Sonys Fame Gurukul. He even puts senior singers like Anuradha Paudwal and VJ Sophie through their paces.

 These days, he has a new batch 

 to train 10 finalists of Dabur Honitus Unish Kuri 

 Madhur Kantha and that is what has brought him back home 

 to a city he left nine years ago. 

 Nine years is a long time. His Hindi is now perfect even spoken Hindi (that is quite a rare feat if your benchmark happens to be Bappi Lahiri or Kumar Sanu). Thats because I speak in Hindi to all my friends, on the phone, in person Mumbai has taught me a lot, he says. 

 The lot does mean a wide range of lessons learnt. Right from the have confidence mantra to the fact that there is life beyond Bollywood in Mumbai. People always talk about the struggle. Half of it will get eliminated if they know exactly what they are capable of. If you have talent, work is not too far. Someone might be capable of a Grammy but could not be cut out for a filmi number. 

 The scene, says Prasant, is different now. There are many more opportunities today and the days of actors as heroes are gone. People are giving the singer a chance to come to the forefront, he adds.

 Coming back to actors though, Prasant feels that his voice suits Hrithik Roshan the best. Now, after so many years of training, I can alter my voice to match any actor. I also dubbed a few lines for Amitabh Bachchans songs! he reveals.

 For now, the Bengal boy is upbeat about performing regularly with Asha Bhonsle. There is so much to learn from her. She once asked me how she was singing its really not required but she did. I have also had the opportunity to play RD Burmans harmonium in her house! 

 Prasant is also part of two bands Silk and Aatma. Up next from the music man is an album.

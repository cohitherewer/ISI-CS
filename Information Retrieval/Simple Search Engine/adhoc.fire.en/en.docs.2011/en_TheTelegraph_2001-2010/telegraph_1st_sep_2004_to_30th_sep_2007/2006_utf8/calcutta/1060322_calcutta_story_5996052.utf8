 Three years later...

 n ?I heard the President say: ?For a while we were marching to war. Now we?re marching to peace.? I heard that the US military had purchased 1,500,000,000 bullets for use in the coming year. That is 58 bullets for every Iraqi adult and child.?

 Three years after the US invasion of Iraq, actor Soumitra Chattopadhyay was reading out a Bengali translation of Eliot Weinberger?s What I heard from Iraq at the Max Mueller Bhavan on Monday. 

 The event arranged by the Seagull Foundation for the Arts was in response to a call by the Berlin-based Peter-Weiss Foundation for Art and Politics to celebrate March 20 as the anniversary of the Political Lie. The text was also read on the same day at Carlton, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Durban, Zurich, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin, among other places.

 A long article of 10,347 words, What I heard from Iraq was first carried by the London Review of Books and subsequently published as a book. Adopting a feigned objectivity, Weinberger juxtaposes actual quotes from politicians, military chiefs, US soldiers and Iraqi citizens at different moments of the war to underline the inescapable pain, ambiguity and irony. 

 Soumitra himself wasn?t that satisfied, though. ?Of course I liked reading it out, but given more time I would have been able to make some changes in the content. It is too long and would not sustain the interest of general listeners at times disassociated with the Iraq event.?

 n They are namesakes. Well, almost. One is Perizaad, the other Parizaad. And the two met up on the sets of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge Dwitiya. Perizaad is making a special appearance on the fifth episode of the show hosted by Parizaad, to be aired this Friday, 10 pm, on STAR One.

 This week, the five contestants laughing it out are Tushar Shah and Jagmeet Bal from Mumbai, Abrar Mohiuddin from Lucknow, Akesh Parth from Jaipur and Kamal Basit from Karachi.

 With regular judges Shekhar Suman and Navjyot Singh Siddhu for support, Perizaad comes up with great one-liners, reminiscent of her character of Jenny in Jogger?s Park.

 n After being forced to chop the horse-riding scenes in Rang De Basanti, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra may be interested in taking tips from this new series on animal care. Viewers get exclusive access to Hollywood?s animal actors in Animal Planet at the Movies.

 From Free Willy to Benji, animals have always been a part of the movie industry, whether as stars of the show or simply filling their role as man?s best friend. But few people think about the trainers who work with them and prepare them for their time in the limelight.

 This month, Animal Planet takes its viewers behind the scenes to the animals and their trainers who are rehearsing for their latest big picture roles. 

 Some movies featured in the series include The Hawk is Dying (with Paul Giamatti), The Shaggy Dog (starring Tim Allen and Kristin Davis) and Greyfriars Bobby (starring Christopher Lee). 

 Animal Planet At The Movies airs every Sunday at 8 pm. It?s the turn of The Shaggy Dog this Sunday. Disney?s remake of the 1950s classic is the much-loved story of a family man who turns into a dog.

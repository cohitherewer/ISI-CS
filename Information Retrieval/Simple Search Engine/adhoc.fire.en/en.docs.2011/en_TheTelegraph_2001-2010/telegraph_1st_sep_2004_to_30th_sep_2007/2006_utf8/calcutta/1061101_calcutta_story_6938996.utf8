 We Ask You Answer

 Rain amp; screen thin crowd

 Todays question: Were the crowds 

 thinner this Puja? If yes, why?

 Peoples puja: The crowd 

 surge in front of Md Ali Park. Picture by Bishwarup 

 Dutta 

 S.S. Almal,

 Lower Rawdon Street 

 Even though pujas have become 

 grander, people might be losing interest in them. Many would 

 rather visit temples. I stay in the city during Puja, but 

 never visit pandals. The reasons are missing children and 

 pickpockets. I also do not like crowds ever since I got 

 lost in Sodepur mela as a child. 

T.R. Anand, 

 Budge Budge

 The crowds were thinner this Puja 

 because of waterlogging. But the number of people visiting 

 pandals fell only negligibly and that too because of the 

 rain. With the puja awards publicising winning pujas, even 

 some reluctant pandal-hoppers were goaded to step out at 

 least on one day. 

 Veena Sreelalan, 

 Bagha Jatin

 The crowds were obviously thinner 

 this Puja compared to the past few years. There are several 

 reasons for this. Teenagers prefer dandiyas and discotheques 

 to pandal-hopping. The elderly dont like crowds, so they 

 stay home and watch Puja coverage on television. To top 

 it all, the downpour left many areas in the city waterlogged.

Tuhin Purkayastha,

 Parnashree Pally 

 There is no question of thinner 

 crowds during Puja as it is the main festival of the Bengalis. 

 The festival remains an occasion when people step out with 

 their family members for a darshan of the goddess. 

 Even rain cannot dampen the mood during Puja.

 Arindam Basu,

 Birati

 There were many reasons behind 

 thinner crowds. The most important was the inclement weather. 

 Incessant rains before the festival and intermittent rain 

 on the four days played spoilsport. It marred the joyous 

 mood of the common people. The rains affected many in the 

 districts, draining them of the enthusiasm to enjoy the 

 festival.

 MD. Sohail, 

 Mcleod Street

 The crowds were thinner this Puja 

 due to rain. This forced pandal-hoppers to remain at home. 

 Many people from the outskirts could not make it to the 

 city because of the downpour.

 Naren Sen,

 Howrah

 Each Puja is much awaited, but 

 in comparison to the past few years, the crowds were definitely 

 thinner this time. Youngsters preferred to spend the holiday 

 outside the city. The aged people, on the other hand, chose 

 to see the idols on television. Many professionals took 

 the opportunity to stay home and spend quality time with 

 family. The elaborate security arrangements by police also 

 put off some people.

 S.N. Mitra,

 Beleghata

 I dont think the crowds were 

 thinner this puja. Probably, more people pandal-hopped compared 

 to the past few years. Which is a shame because just before 

 the festival, many in the districts were rendered homeless 

 by the floods. 

 Ranesh Chandra Dey,

 Parnasree 

 The crowds were thinner this Puja. 

 The reasons were sudden, sharp showers and excellent coverage 

 of Puja on television. Some were afraid of crowd rush at 

 the pandals. A few pandals, however, drew a huge number 

 of people, even in the afternoon. Though it seems difficult 

 to believe, some might have been afraid of terrorist strikes.

 D. Chakraborty , 

 Cossipore 

 The rain continued beyond Mahalaya 

 right up to the Puja. The Met office forecast of heavy rain 

 created panic among pandal-hoppers. Many opted to visit 

 the pandals during the day.

Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 I have seen Durga puja in the 

 city for the past 30 years and the crowds were definitely 

 thinner this year. The media coverage of the event played 

 a huge role. A handful were even afraid of terrorist attacks, 

 given the elaborate security arrangements. 

 Prasenjit Das,

 Jadavpur

 Definitely. Due to floods, many 

 regular visitors from the districts could not make it to 

 the city. The thundershowers in the afternoon also prevented 

 pandal-hoppers from stepping out. Threat of terrorist attacks 

 proved a put-off factor.

 Rratan Kumar Haldar,

 Behala

 Certainly not. There were huge 

 crowds in every part of the city this Puja. I went out on 

 Panchami and there were queues outside pandals in the evening. 

 The downpour on Navami kept away some people but almost 

 everyone went pandal-hopping on the other days.

 Ajit Kumar Das,

 Ghusuri, Howrah

 I do not think so. I went to Belur 

 Math on Saptami and saw a huge queue outside. On Ashtami, 

 the crowd swelled further. Some, however, were forced to 

 skip pandal-hopping due to sudden rain. The elderly found 

 it more convenient to watch the idols on television.

 C. Sarkar,

 Kasba

 The Puja spirit was very much 

 alive among the Calcuttans, but the crowd was thinner at 

 the pandals because of the whims of the weather god. Unlike 

 other years, many went pandal-hopping on Panchami and Sashthi, 

 and thereafter stayed indoors.

 Next 

 week

 Is it right to deny water supply 

 for failure to pay property tax?

 CALCUTTA COLUMN

 Traffic crawl in biz hub

 I would like to draw attention 

 to the chaotic traffic conditions at the heart of Burrabazar. 

 The Jackson Lane-Canning Street- Clive Row intersection 

 is clogged due to illegal parking and encroachments. It 

 would difficult to find another crossing as spacious that 

 has been rendered almost useless by vendors. I would request 

 the authorities to immediately crack down on illegal parking 

 and encroachment in the business hub to allow smooth flow 

 of traffic.

 Inayat Hussain,

 Marquis Street.

 Nights out

 Nurses of all ages work three 

 shifts in the city. However, women above 50 are generally 

 not up to 12-hour night shifts. Many highly experienced 

 nurses above 50 thus fail to produce their optimum output. 

 To utilise them in the best possible manner, the authorities 

 should reprieve them from taking on night duty.

 Arabinda Nagar.

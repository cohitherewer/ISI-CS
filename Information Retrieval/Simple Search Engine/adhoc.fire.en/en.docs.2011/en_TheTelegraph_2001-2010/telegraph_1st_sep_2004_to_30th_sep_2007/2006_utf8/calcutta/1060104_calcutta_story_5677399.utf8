 Teenager returns, tells tale of kidnap

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A teenager disappeared from his Salt Lake residence on Monday, but returned 24 hours later with an allegedly concocted story of abduction.

 Those investigating the case believe the boy, after being chided by his mother for regularly skipping class, took money from her purse and ran away from home. He returned once the money ran out.

 The incident took place at Baisakhi Abasan, under the jurisdiction of Bidhannagar (North) police.

 Sujit Poddar, a Class VIII student of Acharya Prafulla Chandra High School, in BK Block, used to be frequently absent from school and was inattentive in studies. On Monday morning, he left his residence for school, but did not go there.

 When Sujit returned home, she scolded him. In the evening, he went for his tuition in the neighbourhood, but did not return.

 ?We were alarmed, since he did not come back even after two hours. We looked for him in his friends? houses, but to no avail,? recounted Sujit?s mother Putul.

 The frantic family members lodged a complaint with police around midnight. 

 The Bidhannagar (North) cops alerted the other police stations in the township and Calcutta, as well as railway stations in Sealdah and Howrah. Search teams were sent to various places along with Sujit?s photograph.

 Around Tuesday evening, the boy returned on his own. He said: ?I was loitering near Baguiati when strangers in a white Maruti car asked me for directions. When I approached them, they hauled me into the car. I passed out.?

 Sujit added: ?I regained consciousness at Sealdah station on Tuesday morning and, somehow, made my way back home.?

 Even Sujit?s parents are taking his statements with a pinch of salt.

 ?We did what we can to trace the boy, since such matters cannot be taken lightly. But we are not buying the boy?s story yet,? said additional superintendent of police Tamal Basu.

 According to police, the boy had also ?disappeared? last month, only to return the same day.

 Liquor launch, flower power

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 A diva from down 

 south, a world music artiste from Mumbai and a veteran 

 singer-musician from Calcutta. All combining to create 

 some magic at Tollygunge Club this Saturday, when Priscilla 

 Corner, Isheeta Ganguly and Jeffrey Menezes stage Shining 

 Diamonds, a flashback through the decades with evergreen 

 pop, rock, jazz and blues. Well be singing 

 lots of popular songs, including some standards, 

 said Priscilla, who entered music through theatre. Well 

 look back at Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Elton John, 

 among others, offered Jeffrey, the keyboardist 

 for Skinny Alley. (Picture by Aranya Sen shows Priscilla

 What: 

 Eastern India launch of Black Dog Centenary Scotch Whisky.

 Where: Dublin at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: Wednesday evening.

 Take a sip: The nightclub at the hotel witnessed a performance by Rila Banerjee and her band to mark the launch of Black Dog Centenary whisky, the latest from the liquor label.

 Launched in India during British rule, Black Dog boasts 47 per cent of the premium scotch whisky market bottled in India.

 The latest offering is an eight-year-old blended Scotch, a complex mix of 32 fine, aged single malt and grain whiskies, handpicked from the Lowland, Highland, Speyside, Campletown and Islay regions of Scotland.

 This is available in bars and liquor stores across town.

 Pocket pinch: A 750 ml bottle costs Rs 1,140.

 Voiceover: Given the strong brand equity of Black Dog Deluxe 12-Year-Old in the Indian market, we expect Black Dog Centenary to be a success too, said Kaushik Chatterjee, chief operating officer, eastern region, United Spirits Limited.

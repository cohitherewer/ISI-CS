 Fake drugs 

 racket busted, one held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Howarh Haul

 A 

 fake medicine racket has been busted in Howrah, with the 

 arrest of the 48-year-old kingpin, Mahesh Kumar Rathi, and 

 seizure of fake medicines worth around Rs 7 lakh.

 Rathi was picked up on Wednesday 

 night following raids on his house at 197 Ramkrishnapur 

 Lane and two drug outlets, on GT Road (in Shibpur) and Banbehari 

 Bose Road (in the Howrah police station area).

 An officer said he used to paste 

 fake labels on expired medicines and sold them to retailers 

 and the public.

 We found fake medicines worth 

 lakhs in these places. Rathi has been arrested and his shops 

 sealed, said Neeraj Kumar Singh, district superintendent 

 of police. Rathi is being interrogated. A clear picture 

 will emerge soon.

 Sleuths are convinced that such 

 a huge racket it had spread as far as Hooghly and Midnapore 

 could not have been run by Rathi alone. They are trying 

 to find out who were with him.

 We are interrogating Rathi and 

 hope the entire picture will be clear soon, Singh said.

 An investigating officer said: 

 Rathi had a wholesalers drug licence. But violating its 

 terms and conditions, he used to store his supply at a place 

 different from where he was allowed to.

 Among the fake medicines seized 

 from Rathis possession, most are of the bottled variety, 

 as they are easy to repack after expiry. 

 The cops took the help of drugs 

 control personnel during the raid. Drugs control personnel 

 checked the medicines and certified them as fake. After 

 that, we moved in and arrested the dealer, superintendent 

 Singh said.

 A preliminary probe has suggested 

 that Rathi used to sell expired medicines to the people 

 from his two outlets and also to retailers of various pockets 

 in Howrah, Calcutta, Hooghly and Midnapore districts, another 

 officer said.

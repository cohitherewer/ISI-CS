 Hangman rights cry

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Hangman Nata Mullick plans to move the state human rights commission for redress of his grievances regarding pay, pension and a permanent job for his grandson. 

 Mullick, 86, has hanged 25 people; the last, Dhananjoy Chatterjee, on August 14, 2004, for raping and killing 14-year-old Hetal Parekh.

 ?The government has given me several assurances and made efforts to appease me before every hanging. As soon as the job is done, the ministers hardly recognise me,? rued Mullick.

 He has sent several missives to the jail minister and senior bureaucrats, but not a single letter has elicited a response.

 ?When it?s time to hang somebody, the ministers start making promises. But they do not keep their word. I have decided that if my demands are not met, none of my family members will take part in any hanging,? Mullick added. 

 The hangman?s three demands are: pension for himself, hike in hanging fees from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 and a permanent government job as a sweeper for his grandson Prabhat, who had helped him hang Dhananjoy. 

 Mullick?s argument is that he deserves to have a fixed income. ?Why should I always have to ask my sons for money? I am not a beggar,? he cried.

 Prabhat was reportedly promised permanent employment as a sweeper, but was only appointed on contract. 

 ?Is it a job? He has been asked to work as a sweeper-cum-hangman at Alipore Central jail on a contract basis. It can never be,? Mullick asserted. ?I will see how long the government ignores my demands.?

 ?Although Mullick?s grandson is on contract, his employment will never be terminated. We will ensure it,? stated additional inspector-general of police (prison) Ramapada Bhattacharya. ?If he wants a permanent job, he will have to apply through the employment exchange,? Bhattacharya added.

 Regarding the fee hike and pension demand, the additional inspector-general said Mullick had failed to produce any document to prove that he was appointed by the state government as a hangman.

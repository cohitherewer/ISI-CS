 Glut of tech talent, lack of teachers

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Bengal has an abundance of tech talent, shouts the governments sales pitch for the state as an attractive destination for information technology (IT) companies. But a reality check of undergraduate colleges in Bengal presents a sorry picture a case of students too many and teachers too few.

 In Bengal, over 70 per cent of the colleges do not have full-time teachers for computer science courses. While more and more students are opting for honours courses in computer science, the college service commission this year could log in only four candidates against 24 vacancies to teach computer science at the undergraduate level.

 The demand for B.Sc in computer science is rising. But we are unable to find the required number of teachers, said Ajit Banik, chairman, West Bengal College Service Commission.

 Around 70 colleges across Bengal 40 of them in the city offer computer science at the graduation level. In the absence of full-time teachers, the colleges are being forced to rope in part-timers.

 Colleges, students and even the university authorities admit that the quality of teaching is suffering due to non-availability of teachers.

 Computer science postgraduates and Ph.Ds are opting for jobs in multinational companies or going abroad and thats why there is a dearth of quality teachers, said Shyamapada Pal, member of the state higher education council.

 Physics, chemistry and biological sciences have, however, recorded a rise in the number of qualified teachers in the past few years. In the early days of the tech boom, many students from these streams had joined the IT sector. But now, they want to take up teaching because of the stiff competition in the industry, said an official.

 Aware of the danger posed by the dearth of computer science teachers, the government has been exhorting several IT majors to set up a teachers training institute in the state.

 But before that, salaries need to be competitive to lure teachers. We have to think of revising the scale of pay for computer science teachers, admitted Pal.

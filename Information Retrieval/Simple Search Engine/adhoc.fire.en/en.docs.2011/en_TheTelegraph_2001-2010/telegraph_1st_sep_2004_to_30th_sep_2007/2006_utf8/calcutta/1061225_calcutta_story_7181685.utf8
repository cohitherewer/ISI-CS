The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee

 You are simple, honest and. well liked, but when your firm opinions and temper come to the fore, all that can change. Your ideals are lofty and your nature independent. You know how to manipulate people to get the attention you need. You have a tendency to fret. Although not driven by applause, you enjoy recognition and acknowledgement of your efforts. Kusum Bhandari

 Life and nature

 The post-colonial era in India generated among artists, as among others, a globalised modernity impregnated with indigenous values. Art began to convey a contempt against subversive forces that defile nature and life, thus creating a duality between the two. Figure in Nature, the ongoing exhibition of contemporary art by 54 eminent artists, mainly belonging to the post 60s generation, attempts to examine the way they treat this duality. It illustrates the way in which globalisation has transformed Indian art, positing global values and idioms as a superstructure on the bed of Indian reality and tradition. It also offers an insight into the plurality of modes and techniques being adopted by present generation artists to portray life-nature relationship in the contemporary context. Participating artists include Ashoke Mullick, Bimal Kundu, Dhiraj Chowdhury, K. Muralidharan, Manoj Mitra (a painting by him appears above), Nirmalendu Mandal, Prakash Karmakar and Sanatan Dinda.

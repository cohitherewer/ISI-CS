 Markku Polonen looks every inch the Finn: broad and fair with the kind of beard that only people from that part of the world can cultivate. The noted film-maker?s latest film Koirankynnen Leikaaja (Dog Nail Clipper) was screened at Nandan last Friday as part of the EU Film Festival. Calcutta was Polonen?s second stop after Delhi, with a visit to the Mumbai film studios slated for next week, with fellow Finn Sadianka Ghas.

 Polonen is clearly a man out of sorts in tropical weather. ?I?ve never experienced weather like this. In Finland it is minus 10 degrees Celsius at the moment. And this (Calcutta?s weather) is apparently quite mild!? 

 The weather is not the only difference that Polonen has noticed. ?In Finland we have a long tradition of realism in films, while in India there is much emphasis on the spectacle of song and dance,? he observes. ?Finnish films can be quite gloomy sometimes. For example, in an Indian film, boy meets girl and they fall in love. In a Finnish film, boy tries to meet girl, but doesn?t. Our films are very melancholic.?

 Polonen was born in Eno near the Russian border, a very sparsely populated rural area of Finland. ?I have recently moved back to the countryside after spending some time in Helsinki. I built my house on a piece of land with a spectacular view that brings a tear to my eye.?

 The man?s passion for the Finnish countryside is reflected in many of his films, including Dog Nail Clipper which is set in the aftermath of World War II. It goes on to follow the fortunes of a brain-damaged veteran who roams the countryside looking for casual work. ?The war deeply affected Finland, because we lost to the Russians early, and that created a very distinct mindset for the later years. There are 20,000 war veterans still alive today,? he says.

 For influences, Polonen draws on the more experimental European films of the 1960s and 70s. ?Milos Forman and many of the Italian realist directors were the ones that I grew up enjoying,? he reveals. ?In Indian cinema, we used to watch lots of Satyajit Ray films in the 70s which were very impressive, but I don?t like big Bollywwod musicals much. It seems that the plot runs second to song and dance. It is just such a different attitude to film-making.? 

 But what of the Finnish film industry that rarely makes any inroads into the international market? ?You must understand that Finland is a tiny, tiny country with five million people in it. Only 15 movies are produced in a year, mostly with government funding. Each film usually costs roughly one-and-a-half million dollars, which is the catering budget for big Hollywood films!?

 The future of Finnish film-making holds a new wave, feels Polonen. ?The younger directors are much more oriented towards the urban life in Helsinki, while the older generation, such as myself, are more concerned with rural life. Those are also the two big different audiences in Finland.? 

 The short stay in Calcutta has already left an indelible impression on the mind of the maker. ?Well, we just visited Delhi and we felt that it was like an Indian version of Los Angeles,? Polonen explains. ?Calcutta has more history, is more liberal and arty, so we think that Calcutta is the San Francisco of India!?

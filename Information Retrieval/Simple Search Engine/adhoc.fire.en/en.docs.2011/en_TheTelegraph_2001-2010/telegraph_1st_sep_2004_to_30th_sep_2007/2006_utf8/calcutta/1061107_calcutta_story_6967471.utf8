The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mama gushes, then Mama growls

 Gushing about the on-screen pairing but brushing off the off-screen one, Jaya Bachchan swung from mother candid to mother cagey three days after the release of Abhishek Bachchan-Aishwarya Rais Umrao Jaan.

 I have seen Umrao Jaan... What I loved about the film is that Abhishek and Aishwarya looked very nice together And I loved that, declared Jaya, in between playing mother to Konkona Sen Sharma on the sets of Rituparno Ghoshs Sunglass on Monday afternoon.

 I cant say how good or bad a film it is. Its very difficult for me to be objective. I liked the film and I liked Abhisheks performance. He was very comfortable in the role and he gave a look to the film

 And his lady love? Aishwarya, I thought, was quite good, said the Bachchan bahu.

 Then, when the obvious question was popped so, is Abhishek going to marry Aishwarya Jaya snapped: Thats not a nice question to ask. Period.

 The not a nice question is, of course, being asked in hushed tones everywhere in the filmi fraternity. The biggest buzz in Bollywood grew louder when at the stroke of November 1, the Bachchans co-hosted a birthday bash for Aishwarya in Mumbai.

 Three days later, the Ash-Abhishek-J.P. Dutta film hit the theatres the first in a long line of Sanjay Gadhvis Dhoom 2, Mani Ratnams Guru and Ram Gopal Varmas Sarkar 2, where the two share screen space.

 Jayas Calcutta schedule for Sunglass was pushed back from September to November due to mother-in-law Teji Bachchans illness. Monday took her to St James Church and a house in south Calcutta, where some mother-daughter scenes were canned for the film that Rituparno and she had first discussed 10 years ago.

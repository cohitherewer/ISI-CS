Bridging the gap

Stage On amp; Off

 Goutam Halder in a moment from the play Barda

 In a bid to find a new language of theatre, Nandikar has produced a film version of Barda. The 43-minute solo act by Goutam Halder, based on Munshi Premchand?s short story Bade Bhai Sahab, will shortly be available in VCD and DVD formats.

 ?We have tried this as an experiment to see if a language midway between film and theatre can be created, where the essence of theatre will be retained in the garb of film,? says Halder, who directed the project with help in the camera and editing sections from two Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI) students.

 Written in the first person, the play begins with the writer (Premchand himself) giving an interview about his boyhood experiences and dwells on elder brother Barda. The performance features Halder seated in a chair on stage while a giant screen behind catches him in close-up from a different angle.

 ?As I play two characters in the act ? the writer himself, and when he assumes to be Barda ? I had to think of where to look when while acting to drive home the distinction. We also worked on changing the camera positions,? explains Halder.

 For the audio-visual project, the team divided the play into shots just like a screenplay. ?We used different camera angles and light to differentiate the two characters. We used three cameras, and shots like close-ups and mid close-ups. The whole experience is that of watching a film but the main message of theatre is retained,? says Sandipp, an SRFTI graduate in cinematography who handled the camera and worked out the shot divisions.

 The performance has also been blended with a few outdoor shots of a school, shot at Brahmo Balika Vidyalaya, and in an open field, used as imageries for Barda?s narrative. Sandipp feels the project would also add to the documentation of plays as ?we the younger generation haven?t had the chance to see Sambhu Mitra?s acting due to lack of documentation?.

 Swatilekha Sengupta has translated the Hindi story of Bade Bhai Sahab into Bengali, while Biplab Goswami of SRFTI has done the editing. 

 The dialogues, in Bengali with a Hindi slant, were pre-recorded and Halder lip-synced to the playback while shooting. ?Lip-syncing wasn?t too much of a problem because I have got the dialogues by heart after so many performances. Syncing emotionally was the difficult part,? adds Halder, who now wants to take the audio-visual format of Barda to film festivals.

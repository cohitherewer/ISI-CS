Tragedy and its trail

Screen On amp; Off

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 As the second anniversary of the 

 terrible tidal wave dawns on us, a miniseries prepares to 

 look at what it has left behind. Tsunami: The Aftermath 

 (picture above) is a fictionalised account of 

 seven characters whose lives are transformed forever. It 

 will premiere on HBO on December 26 at 9 pm with a repeat 

 on December 30.

 The majority of the stories are based on facts, Bharat Nalluri, the UK-based director of the series, clears the air over the phone from London. We chose to take this route of story-telling to humanise the cold statistics of the Biblical proportions of the disaster. 

 So there they are: a young couple searching for their child, a Thai survivor who loses his family and is trying to prevent developers from seizing the land of his village, an Englishwoman whose husband and son are missing, an ambitious reporter, a relief worker, an overwhelmed British official whose faith in the system is torn apart and a Thai meteorologist, whose forecast of the tsunami was ignored. Our writer Abi Morgan met dozens of survivors and looked at many more individual stories. Once you get down to research, you realise how endless a tragedy it is. Abi felt it would be best if we did the film in two 90-minute parts.

 Nalluri has earlier done Spooks, which won the BAFTA award for best series and was nominated for Royal Television Society Awards. He also directed Life on Mars, on time travel, and Hustle, full of conmen. There was scope to create a world in your head and do fantastic things. The challenge was to make people believe in the fantasy. But here drama was inherent in what we saw and read in the papers. Actual emoting was a lot more difficult as one could not play the usual tricks and had to be honest.

 Since it was impossible to cover the entire stretch affected by tsunami, they chose Thailand. Filmed on location in Phuket and Khao Lak, the production had the support of the local governments and communities. Local residents were interviewed prior to production, and the Thai production company Santa Film acted as adviser throughout filming.

 The majority of the sets had to be built. We redesigned a hotel swept by the waves and worked on the land where the waves would cross. We even went to a temple where they used to congregate to gather information and put up photographs of lost people and bodies. 

 Tsunami: The Aftermath premiered at London and was attended by many of the survivors. They told us that they were expecting a Hollywoodised stylisation of their tragedy but were pleasantly surprised to find it so honest. That was the greatest compliment for us.

 The experience has even left a permanent impact on Nalluris personal life. I met a BBC journalist based in Bangkok who was the first to get into the tsunami area. We got married.

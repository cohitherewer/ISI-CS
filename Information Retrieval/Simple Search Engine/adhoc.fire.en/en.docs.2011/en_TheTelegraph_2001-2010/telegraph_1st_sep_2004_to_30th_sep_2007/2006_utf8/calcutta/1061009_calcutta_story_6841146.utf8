 Shes 

 the dancing queen

 Chandrima S. 

 Bhattacharya joined in at the collective release 

 of pent-up energy inside Bengali women as they shook, trembled 

 and gyrated this Puja

 SEX 

 amp; THE CITY

 This was my first Puja in Calcutta 

 after five years. One big change was the forest of mobile 

 phones and handycams that came in between me and the protima 

 at every pandal. The other was the number of women who danced. 

 It was a cultural revolution. Its roots need to be probed.

 Since when did Bengali culture 

 permit its women to dance in the streets? Five years ago, 

 Dashami for women was restricted to sindoorkhela. 

 More or less. Their vermilion-smeared faces would provide 

 the right romantic prelude to the poignant moment of visarjan.

 Then the men would take over. 

 After the dhunuchi naach, mainly a macho thing, the 

 boys would load the protima on the truck. The more 

 responsible types would pack themselves in. The red-blooded 

 would lead the bhashan procession from the front, 

 going berserk to the heady beat of plumed dhaaks. 

 Their spinning waists would look ready to come off. Their 

 eyes would be blood-shot, presumably from the smoke and 

 not alcohol. The women would never dance in public. They 

 would go back to the pandal and wait for the men to return 

 with the post-visarjan gangajal. It 

 was a true reflection of the social order. 

 But something happened this time. 

 There were almost as many women classified under girls, 

 married women, middle-aged women and mothers as the men, 

 throwing themselves into the melee in front of the trucks, 

 dancing their feet away, on footpaths, in front of tea-stalls, 

 on the roads. They came in salwar kurtas, saris, 

 three-quarters. They came out in droves, in Salt Lake, Sodepur, 

 South 24-Parganas, North 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Konnagar, 

 Nadia, Behrampore, Coochbehar, Siliguri. The earth trembled 

 under their feet. It was an uprising.

 It could have been TV or cinema. 

 Sanjay Leela Bhansali was among the first living greats 

 to recognise that Bengali women needed to dance, even in 

 retrospect. He made Paros mother in his version of 

 Devdas a dancer.

 A Brahmani, in a caste and sub-caste-ridden 

 Bengali village about a century ago, and a dancer? Someone 

 who still dresses like a baiji and dances in front 

 of the Durga idol? We squirmed at the departure from historical 

 evidence. But Bhansali knew he was rectifying history and 

 catering to a deep need in the female Bengali psyche. That 

 when the music beats the brain into pulp and you see other 

 bodies giving themselves up to it, every two-legged creature 

 wants to dance. 

 The Bangla entertainment channels 

 attest to the same feeling. There Sandhya Hajra from Nagerbazar, 

 all of 28, rotund in a way only Bengali women are, in a 

 printed salwar kurta, abandons herself quite 

 often to Kajra Re. 

 This year, she stepped out from 

 her home, from the TV and danced in the streets. 

 Was it only TV? In an obscure 

 pandal in Baranagar, the new wife of a parar dada 

 had been bundled in during the sindoorkhela by her 

 formidable mother-in-law. The young woman was swaddled in 

 a new garad, covered by a ghomta and barely 

 looked at anyones face.

 She stayed calm throughout the 

 sindoorkhela, but during the dhunuchi naach, 

 a fiery bit of chhobra went flying from the dhunuchi 

 into her hair. She shook her hair and looked up. She stayed 

 where she was for a while, but she didnt look down 

 again.

 She saw it was not only men 

 several girls were moving to the dhaak beat. She 

 rose, pulled down her ghomta, wrapped the anchol 

 around her waist and tucked it in in one swift motion 

 and grabbed the dhunuchi. When the bhashan 

 party left for the river, she was still rocking, with all 

 the other women, to Kajra re... 

 It was like feeling hot for a 

 long time and suddenly being able to sweat.

 The fire spread from puja to puja. 

 Around the same time, at an otherwise sedate barir pujo 

 in north Calcutta, the young women suddenly felt an odd 

 stirring within themselves. They rose and surged in one 

 motion towards the dhaakis.

 Their fathers frowned. But the 

 young male cousins knew better. They formed a ring around 

 the girls. A prescient 10-year-old female member of the 

 family, ready from the morning in sneakers and headband, 

 joined in to Kajra re 

 It was like holding your breath 

 for a long time and suddenly being able to exhale. 

 At my parar pujo in Salt 

 Lake, a redoubtable kakima jumped into the fray in 

 front of the truck. She tried to pull my mother in. I forgot 

 that I was a threat to furniture and to all persons nearby 

 when I was dancing and joined in, if for a few minutes.

 Back home, as I watched the bhasan 

 processions from my balcony skirting our housing estate, 

 I saw a sea of women, shaking, gyrating, trembling, to Kajra 

 re It was not a pretty sight always. For gol-gaal, 

 tap-tup Bengali figures dont always lend themselves 

 to display. But when was Saroj Khan or Farah Khan thin? 

 Yet when I was growing up three 

 decades ago, the only permissible form of dance was classical 

 kathak, Bharatnatyam or Odissi to be learnt reluctantly 

 every Sunday morning from an auntie who learnt it because 

 it would further her marital prospects.

 The only demo we could give of 

 our skills was at the para pujo, at the annual Rabindra 

 nrityanatya. It remained that way till the mid-90s. 

 But is it possible to let oneself go with Bondhu 

 kon alo laglo chokhe? No, for that you needed 

 laissez faire, liberalisation, de-regulation, globalisation 

 and Kajra re...

 And the bhasan this year 

 marked the collective release of a force pent up for centuries 

 inside Bengali women.

 But was it only TV? Why was it 

 that it happened at the same time, on the same day, to so 

 many women, across towns, districts, villages? Isnt 

 there a greater design? Are more changes on the way? 

 Is it possible that the Devi, 

 before departing this year, unlocked the force within the 

 women that has hardly been allowed to come out? 

 Never mind. Dance, baby, dance. 

 The Force is with you.

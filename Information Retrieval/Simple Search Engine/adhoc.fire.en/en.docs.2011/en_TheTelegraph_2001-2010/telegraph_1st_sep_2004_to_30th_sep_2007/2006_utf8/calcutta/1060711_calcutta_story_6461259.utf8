The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Billboard agencies fight tax call

 - Metro Rail displays not CMC ambit, court told

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Two city-based advertisement agencies, Display Advertisement and Selvel, have moved the high court, challenging a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) notification demanding tax for erecting billboards at the entrance of a few Metro Railway stations.

 The petitioners argued that the civic authorities have no right to demand a tax as the billboards had been erected on land owned by the Metro Railway. The agencies also claimed to have obtained ?prior approval? of the railway authorities for the putting up the billboards.

 The petition, which came up in the court of Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya on Monday, has been posted for hearing on July 12.

 Counsel for the petitioners Ashok Banerjee submitted that his clients had obtained approval from Metro Railway for erecting billboards on land owned by the railway and also on the Park Street, Central and Esplanade station buildings.

 ?The railway authorities had called tenders before allowing the parties to erect the billboards. My clients had obtained permission after fulfilling all criteria of the tender process,? the lawyer claimed.

 Opposing the plea, CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh submitted that before allowing the agencies to erect billboards, Metro Railway had asked them to obtain approval from the civic authorities. ?Metro Railway has forwarded a copy of the order to the CMC. But the petitioners have violated the condition,? Ghosh alleged.

 Ghosh said the CMC was planning to ban billboards in heritage zones, like BBD Bag (Dalhousie Square). ?Central station of Metro Railway falls within the Dalhousie Square heritage zone. The CMC is not approving fresh applications for erecting billboards there,? the civic body lawyer said.

 The CMC, he pointed out, will not object if the owner of a building uses his premises to display his own advertisements. ?But if anyone else wants to use the building for advertisement purposes, he will have to take the civic authorities? permission and pay a tax.?

 A similar matter is pending before the court. Various associations of soft drink manufacturers had moved a petition, challenging the CMC?s decision to charge a tax for displaying glow-signs at retail shops, restaurants and other commercial establishments.

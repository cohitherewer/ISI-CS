 Whenever Wherever... the Shakira show

 WHY CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYYA ADMIRES THE DISARMING DIRECTNESS OF THE SEX-GODDESS SINGER WHOSE HIPS DONT LIE

 SEX amp; THE CITY 

 Last week Shakira was in the same frame again with Gabriel Garcia Marquez, with whom she opened an NGO for poor children, thereby giving me a reason to say what I wanted to say for long. 

 I have been a Shakira watcher since the blond-locked Colombian bounded into my TV singing Whenever Wherever, looking like a beautiful wild horse on the run. I have watched her since, without often understanding what she sings with my zero Spanish, less Latin and an imperfect ear for English; I wish audio CDs also came with subtitles. But I have watched Shakira for years and I love her. 

 I have watched her lose the fullness of early youth and watched her cheekbones take on a sharp edge that can define the onset of maturity in women and have loved her changing face. Shakira, who writes her own songs, is only 30, though.

 I have tried to find out why I, not a very musical person, like her so much. Its not only her sound, which is kind of barefoot like her, unadorned and less electronic, compared to many of her colleagues, though that too. Its not her wild blond hair streaming out, though that too. Its not that amazing thing she does with her hips, though that too. Its not the fact that she has won countless Grammies and the works and has one of the worlds greatest writers and fellow-Colombian Marquez and the Venezuelan rock star President Hugo Chavez rooting for her, though that reinforces my belief that great minds think alike.

 I think its her voice, its power, though some feel it is quite common but mostly the things she says. Yes, she can be loud, crude, but she is always real. She says things with a disarming directness, going deep down, peeling layers of clothes (and underclothes) off her man to get into what lies beneath. Metaphorically. She sings with her guts. And though she looks like a sex-goddess, theres some dazzling poetry breaking through her songs and a music independent of the music. Thats what must have got Marquez.

 Underneath Your Clothes, she says, theres an endless story, Theres the man I chose/ Theres my territory. Him she likens to a song written by the hands of God. 

 She can be obsessive about a body part. In Eyes like yours, she goes on Came from Bahrain, got to Beirut/ Looking for someone comparing to you/ Tearing down windows and doors/ And I could not find eyes like yours. The next lines spring a stunning visual: Oh, You know I seen/ A woman of means/ In rags and begging for pleasure/ Crossed a river of salt/ Just after I rode/ A ship thats sunk in the desert.

 The Arab world and its images are no coincidence Shakira was born Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll Reath and her father is of Lebanese Catholic descent. Shakira means the graceful one. She has taught herself English to write these and she says she can still love only in Spanish. She has stood on the edge of the world of despair and madness.

 She can look at her body clinically and talk about razors, shaving creams, her humble breasts, her strong legs, her eyes, her lips, in the same breath, while her body keeps the sex-goddess act going. Its one of Shakiras dual acts. In The One she says: So I find a reason to shave my legs/ Each single morning She can talk about mundane things easily: Id like to be/ The kind of dream youd never share/ To be your boss and to be your maid/ Your shaving cream, your razor blade/ The buttons of your shirt/ Your favourite underwear. The underwear theme again. 

 She is playful. She invents words like thereover, hereunder. She can write bad poetry. Maybe it sounds so bad because its in English, but in Objection, the first song she wrote in English, which was part of Laundry Service, she goes: Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal/ Thats why in front of your eyes Im invisibleand This is pathetic/ And sardonic/ And sadistic/ And psychotic. This doesnt work.

 Now she sings Hips Dont Lie, featuring rapper Wyclef Jean and Wyclef Jean screams Shakira, Shakira and she does that thing with her hips, which could be belly-dancing, but which looks like something that can never be taught, something one is born with, and Shakira says Oh baby when you talk like that/ You make a woman go mad/ So be wise and keep on/ Reading the signs of my body and then many women go mad too. So many times I have felt the urge to learn to do the Shakira thing. 

 But my all-time favourite is the number through which I knew her first Whenever, Wherever. It shows Shakira doing what she does best shaking, dancing, undulating her hips, and carrying out her best dual act, while she begs and pleads like a slave before her man, with elemental passion, while elements of nature like the seas, mountains and storms form the moving backdrop, she remains a monumental, towering, unsubservient women, equally desired and desiring. The whole thing may be one act, really she is a natural performer.

 But I can no longer stop myself from singing: 

 Whenever, wherever

 Were meant to be together

 Ill be there and youll be near

 And thats the deal my dear 

 Baby I would climb the Andes solely

 To count the freckles on your body

 Never could imagine there were only

 Ten million ways to love somebody 

 Le ro lo le lo le, Le ro lo le lo le

 Cant you see Im at your feet.

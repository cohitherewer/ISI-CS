 Kajra re queen: Alisha Chinai with Karunya 

and Sandeep

 She?s won every award in town for the song of 2005 and now, Alisha Chinai is going to sing Kajra re for the first time on stage. The occasion is the grand finale of Indian Idol 2 where the two contenders Karunya and Sandeep will join in with their last performance before the winner is announced. ?Both the singers are incredibly talented and it would be great to find out how well they sing Kajra re,? Alisha told Metro.

 Even though she hasn?t been following the talent hunt, Alisha has liked whatever little she?s heard of the two finalists. ?I think shows like Indian Idol are a great opportunity for singers to make a name for themselves,? she said. 

 As for her own singing, Alisha is very clear that she doesn?t want to be part of every Bollywood soundtrack. ?I have been choosy about my projects and that helps me come up with quality work,? she smiled. You can check out Alisha performing live with Karunya and Sandeep this Saturday, 8 pm on Sony. Also making an appearance in the finale would be Ishaa Koppikar. And the star guest? Kajol!

 She is awaiting two releases in the next few weeks ? Uns, the Hindi film co-starring Sanjay Kapoor and Sudhangshu Pandey, and Taposhya, the Bengali remake of Mumtaz-Rajesh Khanna?s Aaina. In one she plays a strong woman who wants to walk out of her marriage, in the other she?s an all-sacrificing bread-earner who turns to prostitution to support her family. 

But before the big screen takes over, Rituparna Sengupta 

(picture left by Aranya Sen) took time out to dabble in dance, a favourite activity 

apart from acting. The actress shot for Rabindranath Tagore?s dance drama Shapmochan, 

to be aired on ETV on May 14 as part of the bard?s birthday celebrations. It is 

presented by her production company Bhabna Aaj O Kaal.

Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya wants thousands of car parks to come up in the city to tackle the perennial problem of parking.

 Parking a car is a nightmare in Calcutta and the situation is getting worse by the day. Without active participation of private players, the problem cannot be solved in a short time, the mayor said on Tuesday, while laying the foundation stone for the citys first multi-level park plaza to be developed privately.

 The proposed six-level park, spread over 1.30 lakh sq ft, will come up on Maniktala Main Road, close the Bypass connector. It will house 620 cars and is slated to be thrown open to the public by March 2007.

 A multi-level parking plaza has been operational on Rawdon Street since 2001 and another is coming up under Lindsay Street. Both have been developed through joint ventures between the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and a private party.

 Considering the shortage of parking space, pegged at 26,000 cars, the CMC in July had appealed to developers to generate more parking facilities. The city-based Mani Group came forward with a plan for a shopping mall with multiplex and a drive-up parking lot and it was readily approved. The total investment will be around Rs 200 crore, said Sanjay Jhunjhunwala of the Mani Group.

 Two more parking plazas in private venture are to come up next year, disclosed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Hulk Hogan with daughter 

 Brooke, wife Linda and son Nick

It is difficult to imagine a ruthless wrestler best remembered for ripping apart his already-torn shirt and yelling at the top of his hoarse voice before bashing up his opponent as a doting father with discipline as his middle name. But then thats what makes the Vh1 reality show Hogan Knows Best so full of surprises.

 The weekly show on the popular music channel stars WWE legend Hulk Hogan in the role of a traditional suburban dad to 16-year-old daughter Brooke and 14-year-old son Nick. It may seem two different lives but I am the same person, Hulk says on the phone from Florida.

 Hulk is a very protective father who is leaving no stone unturned to safeguard his kids from sex, drugs and other evils of modern life. As a father I have to discipline my kids; I am a parent to them first before I am their friend, announces the wrestler with an authority that would make Mohabbateins Narayan Shankar (Amitabh Bachchan) proud. I may be an actor and entertainer inside the ring but at home my family means everything to me The show is not scripted and what you see is how it happens.

 But that wasnt the case when the cameras first rolled into the 20,000-sq-ft estate of Clearwater, Florida. For the first three or four episodes in the first season, my kids were acting differently, admits Hulk. They were very aware that they were being shot. Even my wife Linda was putting on extra make-up and fixing her hair all the time! But things settled down after those initial episodes.

 Hogan Knows Best, being aired every Tuesday at 9 pm, was not meant to project Hulk as a good parent. We did the show to help my daughter who wants to be a pop star, admits the wrestling champ. She has been trying for six or seven years but she didnt have television or movies to promote her singing career like Hillary Duff, Lindsay Lohan and the Simpson sisters, Jessica and Ashlee.

 With the show now entering Season 2 in the US, Brookes career is certainly looking up, says an excited Hulk. Shes got a fair chance, finally. People watching the show understand how hard music is and they want my daughter to do good. Even my son who wants to be a racing car driver has got a boost from the show.

 Its not that Hulk didnt want his kids to become wrestlers. I was hoping that at least one of the two will want to wrestle, he almost whispers. But then I thought I should just let them follow their hearts.

 Hulk knows exactly why Hogan Knows Best has become so popular. See, all the reality shows on television are some type of contests, he explains. And even the ones which are not have the people in the show acting up or acting like fools. We, on the other hand, are a real family.

 He expects the show to have a great response in India, in particular. You know what, Hogan should have been an Indian, he sounds like hes just got into the wrestling ring. In India, families are very important. There is so much love and support within a family. They will be able to identify with the show more than the Americans. Here, its all messed up with couples getting divorced all the time.

 He also wants Indians to know the real Hulk as opposed to the larger-than-life figure who finger wags his opponent before delivering the signature Atomic Leg Drop. They should see what I am really like, he says. Being The Hulkster is my job. Everybody thinks that in real life too I am like that, yelling and screaming around. But there is more to me and thats what Hogan Knows Best tries to show.

 Despite protests from his wife, Hulk returned to the ring on July 15. But at this age he turned 53 a couple of weeks back will he able to take on the new generation of wrestlers? No one wants me there (back in the ring) just because the young guys are jealous of me, roars The Incredible.

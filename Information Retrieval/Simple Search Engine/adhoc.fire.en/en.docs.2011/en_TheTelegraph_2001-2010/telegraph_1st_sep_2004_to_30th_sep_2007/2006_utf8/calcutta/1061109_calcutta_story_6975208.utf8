 What: 

 Launch of Dhara cookbook Madhabir Ranna-Ghor.

 Where: Gharana, The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Wednesday, 12.30 pm.

 Chief guest: Madhabi Charulata Mukherjee.

 Big bite: Meant to cater to the Bengali palate, a special cookbook featuring Madhabi Mukherjees choice of Bengali recipes was launched by Satyajit Rays favourite actress, who is also the face of Dharas recent television commercial.

 The booklets comprise a collection of detailed authentic Bengali recipes like Begun Basanti, Postor Bora, Dhokar Dalna, Chingri Maachher Paturi and Kosha Mangsho that can be prepared using Dhara Kachi Ghani Mustard Oil (KGMO).

 Available on purchase of a 1-litre pouch of Dhara KGMO is a cookbook containing five of Madhabis favourite recipes, while the cookbook with 10 of her chosen recipes come with every five-litre pack of Dhara KGMO. To highlight the relevance of mustard oil in Bengali cuisine, the recipe book also presents the Super Chef contest in which consumers can send in their original recipes made with the specific cooking medium to win an LG microwave oven.

 Voiceover: Bengali 

 food is incomplete without the flavour of mustard oil. I 

 have always loved cooking and my family and friends relish 

 the way in which I prepare dishes like ilish maachh and 

 mochar paturi. For me, the use of Dhara Kachi Ghani 

 Mustard Oil is a must and Ive been doing so for a 

 very long time. I would recommend it to all those who enjoy 

 genuine Bengali cuisine, said Madhabi.

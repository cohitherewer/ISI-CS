 Prinsep Ghat: Statue park ahead. A Telegraph picture

 Faced with a space crunch and other difficulties in installing statues in the city, the public works department has planned to come up with a dedicated statue park in Prinsep Ghat. The department has acquired a 200x40-m plot for the purpose.

 Over the years, Bengal has produced a number of great leaders and we have always made a conscious effort to remember them by creating their images. But we often face space problems in installing them. That has what prompted us to prepare a special park for statues, said public works department minister Monohar Tirkey.

 Soon after the park is set up, the department plans to erect there the eight statues that are now stacked in its warehouse. Among them are the ones of former chief minister Ajoy Mukherjee and freedom fighter Birsa Munda. Both are made of bronze and they cost Rs 16 lakh. Mundas statue is 16 ft high, while that of Mukherjees is 12 ft.

 We wanted to instal Mukherjees statue in the Assembly, but there, too, we faced a space crunch. If we find no other place to set up the image, it will be relocated to the Prinsep Ghat park, the minister added.

 The price of a statue varies according to its size and material, said P.K. Agarwal, principal secretary in the public works department. A half-size bronze statue costs around Rs 1 lakh and a full-length one more than Rs 6 lakh.

 At the moment, we do not have too many statues in our stock. Some of them have already been installed in the Governors house in Barrackpore. The rest will also be installed as soon as the department finds a suitable site, he added.

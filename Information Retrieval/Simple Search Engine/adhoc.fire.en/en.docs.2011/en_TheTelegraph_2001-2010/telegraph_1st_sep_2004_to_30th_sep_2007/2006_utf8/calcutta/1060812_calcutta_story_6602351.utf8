Youth scores in Tagore treat

 K.N. Panikkars troupe stages Raja.

The palpable buzz around the Rabindra Utsav, organised 

by Happenings with support from the government of West Bengal and Airtel, recalled 

the enthusiasm that used to greet the pioneering theatre festivals two decades 

ago, before festivals degenerated into wheeler-dealing event management.

On paper, it promised a feast of premieres by a quartet 

of national-celebrity directors. For the concept, effort and commissioning of 

the productions, therefore, the organisers deserve thanks.

On stage, however, the comparison between seniors 

and juniors three non-Bengali veterans and the sole young local ended in a 

resounding triumph for youth over experience. It seemed appropriate for an author 

who himself championed the new in such plays as Phalguni.

Suman Mukhopadhyays vision of Raktakarabi 

came closest to matching Tagores revolutionary stagecraft. With a nip and a tuck 

here and there, it could become for this generation what Sombhu Mitra did for 

his a half-century ago. 

The very first picture sticks in ones mind. The curtain 

rose to reveal barbed wire on the proscenium line, separating us from the Tritiyo 

Sutra cast gathered on the other side, staring blankly or pleadingly at us, almost 

to set them free.

It epitomised Mukhopadhyays highly visual style, 

which most Bengali theatre lacks. Sankar Debnaths forbidding set of heavy cell-like 

doors and a huge grey sculpted head upstage looked like a concentration camp, 

literally topped by a megaphone that became the perfect medium for the Rajas 

voice. The soundtrack of atmospheric music composed by Mokam evoked the ominous 

ambience.

But Mukhopadhyays biggest achievement was to make 

his actors deliver Tagores lines and even songs naturally, detonating the theory 

that only poetic speech a la Sombhu Mitra works for Tagore. All the characters 

instantly turned into flesh and blood. Anindita Das Mullick gave Nandini the aura 

of an innocent natures child.

Perhaps the Sardars could behave more oppressively, 

whereas the Gosain came across as too vampiric, robbing the dialogue of some of 

its rare satiric relief. In the given circumstances, the physicalisation of Ranjan 

and Raktakarabi by dancers in white and red respectively went against the realistic 

grain.

 H. Sabitri plays Amal in H. Kanhailals Dakghar 

And Mukhopadhyay ran out of ideas in the end. The 

greatest challenge in the play is how to show the Raja when he finally appears; 

Mukhopadhyays present solution not only cops out, it also confuses. Some rethinking 

on these areas should improve matters dramatically!

Kalakshetras Dakghar completely transformed 

young Amal into a symbol. Instead of the usual child, H. Kanhailal cast his 60-year-old 

wife, H. Sabitri. Immediately, Amal signified something else: not just the human 

spirit (which Tagore wanted), but also Manipur herself, indoctrinated and languishing 

in ill health as the doctor prescribes the cure of closing all windows. 

Kanhailal even painted Sudha negatively, stressing 

that she asks Amal to pay for her flower. Sabitris face displayed a childs feelings 

expressively, and the lyrical Manipuri dances combined with H. Tombas music suited 

the plays mood.

Most remarkably, Kanhailal included actors from Tripura, 

Silchar and upper Assam speaking Bengali, Assamese and Manipuri to make it a unified 

Northeastern statement.

Sopanams Malayalam interpretation of Raja went 

back to the traditional performances of Kerala with which K.N. Panikkar works. 

He used a script collated with Tagores final edition, Arup Ratan, evidencing 

an in-depth textual study of Tagore that most directors, Bengali or non-Bengali, 

do not pursue. He changed the invisible Raja into a phallic black Theyyam a 

ritualistic oracle.

My problem with this vision lies in its irreconcilability 

with Tagores, who resisted giving formless godhead any shape whatsoever. The 

music, on the other hand, conveyed the spiritual dimension because music in any 

case is abstract, not pictorial.

As for Naya Theatres Raj-Rakt, adapted into 

Chhattisgarhi by Habib Tanvir, little distinguished it from his disappointing 

earlier collaboration with Rangakarmee on Bisarjan. Although also billed 

as an adaptation of the source novel Rajarshi, that debt occurred only 

in some narrative portions that actually killed the theatricality.

Tanvirs obligatory tribal dancers trooped in for 

no reason at all, like a brand tag frayed at the edges. Sadly, he proved the weak 

structure of Tagores original and, in his directors note, badly mixed up the 

sequence of its various editions, matched by the inaccurate stage history in Samik 

Bandyopadhyays programme note on Tagorean drama.

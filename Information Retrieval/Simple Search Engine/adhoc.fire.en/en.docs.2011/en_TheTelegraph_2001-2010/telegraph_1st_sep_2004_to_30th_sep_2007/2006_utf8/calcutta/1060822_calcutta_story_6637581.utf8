 Pilgrimage out, globe-trotting in

 - Count of elderly couples hopping on and off flights swells by 30 per cent 

 ZEESHAN JAWED

Manchester over Mathura, Vancouver over Varanasi dont think tirth yatra for senior citizens; fun travel far and wide begins at 50 these days.

 Going by industry figures, the number of elderly couples (between 50 and 75 years) travelling abroad for VFR (visiting friends and relatives) or just to discover a new place has gone up by around 30 per cent in the past 18 months. The favourite destinations on their roving radar: Europe, Australia and Southeast Asia. The domestic destinations of choice: Goa, Kerala and Northeast.

 Senior citizens are travelling more now than ever before. This phenomenon reflects a socio-economic change in the Indian family, says Karan Anand, director, Cox amp; Kings. Parents have a healthy bank balance but the savings are not being used up by their children, who start earning a five-figure salary from their early twenties. These savings go into frequent travel tours.

 Then are those hopping on and off flights not because of their bank balance but courtesy their children settled abroad, who send them long-distance tickets, often as anniversary or birthday gifts.

 Take the Roys of Alipore, both well into the 60s. With their only daughter settled in London, 12 weeks of the year are spent touring the world with UK as epicentre, and another 12 are spent planning out their next honeymoon. We have been regular travellers for the past two years; once you get into the habit, you just cannot sit at home, they chorus.

 The most interesting travel trend emerging in recent times is the role of the kitty party. 

 Kitty parties are a new trend where couples save up money from their kitties and arrange for a group tour to their favourite destination. They plan the kitties with the sole objective of travelling abroad, confirms Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 Tour operators have been quick to take the cue and customise packages to suit the pocket and the penchant of these elderly travellers. 

 From round-the-year departure dates to food served according to the requirement of the group, tour operators are going all out to attract more senior citizens. 

 If a group of Jains is travelling, we provide food without onion and garlic. For South Indians we arrange for their cuisine, says Punjabi.

 Comfort is certainly a factor, but only after safety. As most of these travellers are on medication, operators plan tours to the T. 

 There is always a local guide with the group and sightseeing is avoided at night. Also, the guide carries a lot of common local medicines.

 The fact that travelling has become cheaper and easier has also helped the trend to soar. 

 The tour and travel agencies come up with such attractive packages that the dream of foreign travel has become a reality for many, says Anand.

 Agrees 60-year-old S.D. Agarwal, who toured France, England and Switzerland late last year: One big reason that so many elderly couples are travelling abroad is that travelling has become cheaper and smoother. There are customised travel packages for the elderly that take care of everything, from medicines to food.

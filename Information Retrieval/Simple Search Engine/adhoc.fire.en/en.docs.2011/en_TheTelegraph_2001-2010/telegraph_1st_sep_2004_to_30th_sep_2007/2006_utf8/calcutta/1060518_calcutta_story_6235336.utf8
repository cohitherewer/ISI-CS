 What: 

 Launch of new menu at Atrium Cafe, The Park.

 When: May 17. The new menu will be available from May 19.

 The spread: Comprises an elaborate and contemporary world cuisine fare with a stress on French delicacies.

 Start off with the Mediterranean Platter (marinated Bocconcicni with asparagus, olive, mushroom, sweet pepper, tabouleh, humus, pita and olive bread). The Rajmah Galouti Pita Bites (with dips and cous cous tabouleh) are also a delectable option.

 Try the Herbed Goat Cheese Salad or Poached Egg and Ostrich Confit with Walnuts and Herbs. Not to forget the wide array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian sandwiches, burgers, pizzas and pastas. 

 The Tandoori section will give you a taste of Atriums signature Paneer Almond Kebab and the Lahori Chapali Kebab (with beef and pomegranate). 

 In the main course, dig into the spicy Broccoli and Carrot Mousse with Gorgonzola Sauce or the Grilled Tiger Prawns (with sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts butter, aubergine and spinach provencal). 

 If you want to stick to the desi fare, opt for Chingri Malai Curry, Broccoli Asparagus Do Pyaza or the Paneer Tikka in Makhani Gravy. 

 Before signing off, dont forget the Baked Pineapple Cheesecake with Mango Granite or the layers of Malpoa and Rabri laced with Jaggery Sauce. 

 If you fear the menu has changed altogether, take heart: the old popular favourites are very much there.

 Pocket pinch: Around Rs 1,200 for two.

 Voiceover: The new menu has been designed keeping in mind the speciality of Atrium Cafe ? it has something for everyone. So there is some Indian, some French, some Continental and more. Incidentally, there is nothing in the menu that I dont love, revealed executive chef Yvonnick Jegat Deniau. There is a wider variety now and the dishes are perfect for the Calcutta summer.

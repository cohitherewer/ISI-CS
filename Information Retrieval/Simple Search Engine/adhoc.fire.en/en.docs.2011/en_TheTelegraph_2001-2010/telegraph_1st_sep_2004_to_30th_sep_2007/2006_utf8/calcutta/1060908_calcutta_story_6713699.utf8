 Apropos the article House rules 

 ready for New Town, August 4, I was allotted a plot in 

 Action Area I of the township. It was handed over to me 

 on February 15, 2005, after completion of the formalities. 

 Hundreds of other people, too, were similarly handed over 

 plots. We were told that after sanction of building rules, 

 which could take a few months, building plans would have 

 to be submitted to Hidco for sanction.

 It is disappointing that a year-and-a-half 

 have elapsed but the building rules have still not been 

 approved by the government and officially published. Hence, 

 the building plans cannot yet be submitted to Hidco. When 

 I called up the Hidco office after reading the report, I 

 was told that the rules had not yet been published and no 

 orders had been issued regarding submission of plans. This 

 was confirmed by the senior general manager (estate). In 

 other words, it is not yet clear when the plot-owners would 

 be able to start construction. 

 The development of New Town started 

 with promise and the initial work was done quite fast. But 

 from the time of handing over of the plots, the progress 

 has been excruciatingly slow, depriving plot-owners of invaluable 

 time at a crucial juncture in their lives. This inordinate 

 delay has caused the allotees inconvenience and financial 

 loss. The lack of concern towards the interests of the plot-owners 

 shows Hidco and the state government in poor light.

 Voices of protest: Students 

 on the Bengal Engineering and Science University campus

It has become a practice to call 

 a strike over the death of a student in a fight between 

 unions in an educational institution (Mixed effect of strike 

 call, August 15). It is unfortunate that violence has become 

 commonplace at Bengal Engineering and Science University 

 (BESU), Jadavpur University and Presidency College, where 

 most of the talented students of Bengal study. There may 

 be differences of political opinion among students, but 

 such differences should not be settled through violence. 

 Strikes, too, serve no purpose. 

 They only vitiate the campus atmosphere and after a few 

 days everybody forgets why the strike was called. But the 

 parents who lose their child in the violence cannot get 

 over the incident for a single moment in their life. Instead 

 of calling a strike, students can hold a condolence meeting 

 after class.

 Apropos the report Doctors invoke 

 God, August 11, it is unfortunate that infiltration of 

 politics into educational institutions has resulted in the 

 death of a BESU student. Student politicians, goaded by 

 party leaders, often cross boundaries. The innocent suffer 

 as a result. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala

 The ruling party cannot shrug 

 off its responsibility in the violence at BESU, leading 

 to a death. Student unions should be banned and the union 

 leaders punished to restore peace on campus. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 It is a good sign that Soumik 

 Basus death has prompted the BESU student unions to make 

 an effort to resolve their differences.

 Apropos the report Dream sail 

 out of depth, August 9, bad luck and embarrassment seems 

 to be following our workaholic and straight-speaking chief 

 minister. First, it was Rajarhat Expressway, his first track 

 to progress, which was found riddled with craters. Now his 

 bid to transform the city into Venice has been brought to 

 a halt by silt. To add to the humiliation, his cabinet colleague 

 had boasted in public about how well the canals had been 

 dredged!

 Apropos the report Canal ferry 

 ready for trial run, August 8, launch service on canals 

 will benefit many. The launch of the service might also 

 lead to an end of mosquito menace in Salt Lake.

 Apropos the report Night haven 

 for hapless girl child, August 10, Sister Cyril of Loreto 

 Day School, Sealdah, is doing a praiseworthy job in providing 

 shelter to street children. It is heartening to learn that 

 more than 65 schools have responded positively to her novel 

 proposal of allowing school premises to be used as night 

 shelter for destitute children. 

 Akhter Kamal Siddiqui,

 Park Street

 I was aghast on reading that a 

 Group D staffer of Belle Vue Clinic had molested a schoolgirl 

 (Verbal vet for hospital odd jobs, August 9). Such incidents 

 cannot be ruled out in government hospitals, but it is shocking 

 that a premier clinic turned out no better. And why was 

 there no woman nurse accompanying the girl? I am associated 

 with a nursing home where no male staff member is allowed 

 to enter the womens ward without a lady staff member accompanying 

 him.

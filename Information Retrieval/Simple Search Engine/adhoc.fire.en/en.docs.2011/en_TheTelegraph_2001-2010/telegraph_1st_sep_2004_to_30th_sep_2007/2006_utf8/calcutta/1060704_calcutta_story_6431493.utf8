 A city-based freelance photo-journalist, Sunil K. Dutt has extensively photographed the people and places of Calcutta in an illustrious career spanning more than four decades. A recipient of many prestigious national and international awards, he has worked on subjects that mainly focus on contemporary social, economic and cultural issues. The ongoing solo exhibition of his photographs features a collection that is representative of his long and rewarding relationship with the lenses. Comprising nearly 50 colour and black-and-white photographs, most of which have been put on display, perhaps, for the first time, the show bears testimony to his diverse spheres of interest. What is interesting about his works is that, though they deal with dissimilar themes, they seem to echo a lyrical rhythm that unites them all on a certain level. The photographs also express Dutt?s own concern for the future of humanity in an inequitable physical and social environment.

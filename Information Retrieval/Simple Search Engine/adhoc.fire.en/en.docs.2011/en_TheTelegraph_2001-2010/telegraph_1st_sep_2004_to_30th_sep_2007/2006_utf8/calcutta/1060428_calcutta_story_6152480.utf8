The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Under a blazing 

 sun, winding queues with expectant faces

 Four months in town, a Londoner compares 

 the laid-back poll process at home with Calcuttas war 

 frenzy

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 If one so desired, one could spend 

 the whole of a West London election day drinking beer in 

 the World?s End Pub, Chelsea. If it took your fancy, you 

 could slip out between pints and cast your vote at the polling 

 station down the road in all of five minutes. The election 

 is but a minor, passing disruption to the Londoner?s daily 

 routine.

 The notion of getting a drink 

 in a bar in Calcutta on Thursday was about as plausible 

 as David Beckham turning out in East Bengal colours. Even 

 if one were able to grab a drink, the prospect of queuing 

 up in the brutal April heat with a headful of alcohol would 

 be too gruesome for even the most enthusiastic of drinkers.

 The average working Londoner will 

 cast his vote either before or after work. Such a dilemma 

 could not affect the majority of Calcuttans, as the city 

 became a virtual ghost town on election day.

 Calcutta, on Thursday, seemed 

 to shift into a completely unique gear. The normal urban 

 energy I have come to associate with the city four months 

 into my stay here was replaced by a mood of mid-week slumber. 

 Shutters went down on shops, one got a seat on the Metro 

 at midday, College Street was deserted and it took all of 

 five minutes to go from CR Avenue to Alipore.

 Speaking of Alipore, one noticed 

 both the National Library and the large Calcutta University 

 campus opposite it occupied by the election army and so 

 many schools turned into polling stations.

 That would be unthinkable in London, 

 where election day is certainly not a holiday for schools 

 and colleges. In my last year in school, I remember hurrying 

 from my last lesson of the day to ensure that I would be 

 able to vote Labour ? a bit of a mistake, retrospectively, 

 one is forced to admit.

 The polling sites are very different 

 in these two cities. In London, supervisers are usually 

 students or pensioners who give the process a very relaxed 

 feel. Calcutta, on the other hand, was turned into something 

 of a war zone on Thursday, with lots of bored-looking soldiers 

 and policemen at the entrances, with rifles slung at all 

 kinds of inappropriate angles.

 Yet, men and women waited patiently 

 in separate queues under the blazing sun, a look of expectation 

 on their faces.

 If the voters were very visible, 

 so were the candidates. In London, the odd leaflet might 

 drop through the letter-box and candidates might canvas 

 occasionally. But they would draw nothing like the crowds 

 that gathered around a Tapas Pal or a Biplab Chatterjee 

 ? two actors slugging it out in Alipore ? on Thursday afternoon. 

 The very notion of Chelsea?s MP Malcolm Rifkind causing 

 such a commotion on King?s Road is almost amusing.

 But while London?s laid-back approach 

 to elections is, perhaps, indicative of a growing apathy 

 to politics, the poll process in Calcutta is surely alive 

 and kicking.

 Conserve cry for water resources

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The next war, it is said, will be fought over water.

 The past few decades have witnessed an increasing global concern about water management, particularly with water reserves getting depleted globally and very little effort being put into making water a sustainable resource.

 Scholars from across India and various parts of the world will discuss and debate issues related to these at a seminar being held in Jadavpur University on March 3 and 4.

 ?History of Waters in South Asia: Climate, Ecology, Deforestation, Agriculture and the Management of Nature? will attempt to address ?the broad areas of environmental concern in human societies across the globe and the complex patterns of their interaction with the nature by focusing on the history of waters?.

 ?Water resources occupies a central place in the scientific debate relating to conservation and the management of nature. The importance of the history of waters has already been acknowledged by leading environmental historians of the world,? says Ranjan Chakrabarti, a professor of history and coordinator of the UGC Special Assistance Programme on Environmental History of South Asia, which is organising the seminar.

 The situation is not too bright for India. 

 ?Around 15 per cent of the world?s population resides in India but the country has only four per cent of the world?s water resources,? Chakrabarti adds. 

 Another woe is that water cannot be created and must, therefore, be better managed.

 Participants expected at the seminar include scholars from USA, UK, Australia, Germany and Bangladesh. 

 There are plans to form an Association of South Asian Environmental Historians at the seminar. 

 ?Though there are similar bodies in the US and in Europe, it will be a first in India,? Chakrabarti offers.

 A World Water Forum conference is up next in Mexico, later this month.

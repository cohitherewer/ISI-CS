 Dowry wreaks horror toll

 - Jadavpur bank cashier strangles, bludgeons to death wife of 16 months

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 30-year-old man, married barely a year ago, strangled his wife to death and smashed her skull with a shovel at his Regent Park home early on Thursday. A couple of hours later, he turned up at Lalbazar and confessed to the crime.

 Police said Swapan Biswas, a cashier with State Bank of Indias Jadavpur branch, and his family members would torture Aparna, 26, for dowry. The two were married in April 2005.

 Swapan also suspected Aparna of having an affair with a youth of the locality and did not allow her to step out of their house or even speak to her parents over the phone.

 S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said Swapan, his younger sister and their mother Gita have been arrested. A probe has revealed that Aparna was subjected to inhuman torture for the past few months, following her refusal to bring more dowry from her parents. Swapan also suspected that his wife was having an extramarital relationship, he added.

 Aparnas father, Pathik Chandra Biswas, a retired government employee, was shattered on hearing the news. 

 It was an arranged marriage. Though her husband and in-laws tortured her often, I never thought they would kill her for money. The culprits should be punished, said Biswas, choking on his tears.

 Aparnas aunt, Minali Pailan, and elder sister Malati Giri live around a km from Swapans house in Dineshnagar, in Regent Park. Around 5.30 am, two local youths came to Minalis house and informed her that Aparna had been murdered by her husband. She immediately called Malati.

 Malati and I rushed to Aparnas house but her mother-in-law tried to prevent us from entering. We forced ourselves in and found Aparna lying on the floor, bathed in blood, her head smashed to pieces. We cried out in horror, recalled Minali. Neighbours rushed in and informed police.

 Swapan, meanwhile, left the house unnoticed and reached Lalbazar around 7.25 am, where he admitted to having killed his wife. He was later handed over to Regent Park police station.

 Minali said Swapan wanted to start a business and was mounting pressure on Aparna to arrange the capital from her father. Aparnas refusal enraged Swapan and he started assaulting her. She was not even allowed to meet her father, who lives in Sonarpur. Unable to bear the torture, she called her father last month and narrated everything.

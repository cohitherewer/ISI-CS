The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shower sequel in the air

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The city and its adjoining areas experienced pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday afternoon, and the Met office predicted a rerun over the next 24 hours.

 ?After a long time, we had all the conditions required for thundershowers. On Tuesday morning, we issued thundershower warnings for Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly and North and South 24-Parganas,? said G.C. Basu, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore. More rain is expected on Wednesday.

 Officers said there had been a heavy incursion of moisture over the past week, but there was no supporting system in the atmosphere that could cause either a Nor?wester or a thundershower.

 On Tuesday morning, a strong cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) was embedded in a trough of low pressure extending from north-east Madhya Pradesh across Jharkhand, Gangetic Bengal and Bangladesh two km above sea level. ?There was another trough of low pressure on the surface stretching from Gangetic Bengal to Jharkhand. All these systems together helped suck in volumes of moisture and trigger thundershowers,? said Basu.

 Cloud columns, 10 to 12 km tall, spread evenly across the sky over Calcutta and its neighbouring districts. These can cause more rain. 

 For a week till last Saturday, Calcutta experienced stifling heat, as the humidity level in the air soared with the wind blowing in from the Bay of Bengal. ?But there was no rain as the condition was not favourable to trigger thunder squalls. The situation changed from Sunday,? an officer said.

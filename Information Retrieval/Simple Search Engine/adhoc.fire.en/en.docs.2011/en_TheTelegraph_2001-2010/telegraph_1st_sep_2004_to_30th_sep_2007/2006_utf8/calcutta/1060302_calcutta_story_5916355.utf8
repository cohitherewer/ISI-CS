 MiSS MUSH: Simi Garewal with Maleika and Zayed Khan

 After the likes of John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra, Simi Garewal returns with yet another heart-warming Rendezvous with the newly married Zayed and Maleika Khan. Zayed?s sisters Farah, Simone and Suzanne also join the couple on the show, this Sunday, 9.30 pm, on STAR World.

 During the course of the tete-a-tete, the two talk about growing up, about the special bond they share with each other and, of course, their fairytale romance. If the previous episode was about the senior Khans, Sanjay and Zarine, this Sunday?s episode is more about the relationship Zayed shares with the four important women in his life ? his wife and three sisters.

 The best thing about the show is how wife Maleika goes candid about her handsome hubby. ?I think somehow he (Zayed) looks better on screen than off screen. He is very handsome on screen!? she gushes. 

 She doesn?t like everything about him, though. ?The thing that really gets me on the edge is even though he is wrong he is never willing to accept the fact. He is not willing to budge. For Zayed, it?s, ?I want my way or the highway?,? reveals Maleika.

 But she also has nice things to say about her man. ?He is a lovely person and I?m willing to take his complications. He makes life very happy for me, makes me very happy,? Maleika sums up.

 After Dubai and London, it?s off to Mauritius for the Zee Cine Awards. Flush with the success of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005, Zee Network announced the venue for the ninth Zee Cine Awards 2006 on Tuesday.

 Meant to be a grand celebration of Hindi cinema, the awards will be held on March 4 at Swami Vivekananda International Convention on the scenic island of Mauritius. Says Punit Goenka, director, Zee Telefilms: ?Our aim is to take Zee Cine Awards to the international platform to showcase the best of Indian cinema to the world. We hope to provide the impetus for the crossover of Indian cinema to global audiences and delight the Indian diaspora with the grandest celebration of Indian cinema.?

 Zee Cine Awards 2006 will witness some scintillating performances from the biggest names in Bollywood ? Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, Abhisekh Bachchan, John Abraham and Riteish. 

 The glamour quotient will be upped by Preity Zinta, Rani Mukherjee, Priyanka Chopra, Dia Mirza, Malaika and Amrita Arora.

 The hosts will be Karan Johar, Arjun Rampal, Mallika Sherawat, Konkona Sen Sharma and Gulshan Grover.

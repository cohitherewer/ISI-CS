Badman does good

Screen On amp; Off

 He has been missing in action 

 on the big screen for the past few years. And just when 

 the absence was getting too long for comfort, Ashish Vidyarthi 

 (with Jeet in picture left by Sanat Kr Sinha) has 

 resurfaced this time in a Bengali film.

 Vidyarthi is bored of the bad guys and wants a change of heart for his screen characters. In Shree Venkateshs Kranti, which hit the screens across Bengal on Saptami, Vidyarthi plays a bad guy again, but differently. He is suave and soft-spoken, and never holds a firearm in the film.

 Riingo (the debutante director) has managed to etch out a character. Vishnu is very flesh and blood and the situations are believable. You will empathise with him within the parameters of the film, and thats not the routine in Hindi films, says Vidyarthi, sitting in the drawing room of his in-laws at Ranikuthi. His mother-in-law is veteran Tollywood actress Shakuntala Barua.

 The closest parallel to Vishnu, in his Hindi films, would be the villain in Bichchhoo, muses Vidyarthi, adding: I mean in terms of suaveness.

 With Kranti, Vidyarthi has turned four-film-old in Tollywood and the mix has been quite eclectic. First was Probhat Roys Shesh Thikana, then Sandip Rays Bombaiyer Bombete and last year Sujit Guhas Nayak.

 I didnt sign any Hindi film in the last five years because I saw myself doing work that was boring. So I started doing films in south India which helped me get my bread and butter and at the same create a gap for myself, he explains. In five years, Vidyarthi has done 30 films in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada. 

 Of late, there has been a trickle of interesting roles from Bollywood. I am in talks for two films where I have positive and very strong roles Its a question of what I would feel comfortable with. An actor has to continuously reinvent himself. So my plea to all directors and scriptwriters is please look at me out of the box. I want to do roles which would make you start visualising me differently.

 Despite screen commitments, the 

 National School of Drama graduate continues to stage his 

 solo act Dayashankar Ki Diary. I have been doing 

 it for the past 10 years. Given a film career, its very 

 difficult to start new productions at the moment. But I 

 take classes during workshops and thats how I keep in touch 

 with my theatre roots, adds Vidyarthi with a smile.

 His faves

 Paresh Rawal: He is my 

 role model. He can do everything 

 Naseeruddin Shah: He is the epitome of what an intelligent 

 actor is all about 

 Om Puri: I admire him for the rustic earthiness in 

 his performances. Its straight from the heart 

 Meera Jackman (Malayalam): For the innocence in her 

 acting 

 Debasree Roy: I have a lot of love and respect for 

 her 

 Rani Mukherjee: Shes extremely versatile

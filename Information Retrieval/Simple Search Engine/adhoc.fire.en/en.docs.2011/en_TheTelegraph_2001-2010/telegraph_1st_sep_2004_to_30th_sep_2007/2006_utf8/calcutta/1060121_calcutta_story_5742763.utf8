The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Affinity for science 

 - Bypass knowledge hub outscores all centres in footfall, repeat crowd

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcuttans are the most scientifically inclined in the country. Only if footfalls and figures add up to funda, that is.

 The scientific basis to the perception that Calcutta has greater affinity for science than Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore stems from the fact that Science City has recorded the maximum footfalls among all such centres across India.

 The EM Bypass facility was set up by the Salt Lake-based National Council of Science Museums in 1997, after its counterparts in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore and most of the 23 other centres started functioning.

 Though a late starter, Science City spread over nearly 50 acres, draws around 1.3 million visitors a year, way ahead of its closest competitor in Bangalore, where the annual footfall is 8.5 lakh.

 And it?s not just the crowd count. The Calcutta hub has also emerged No. 1 in other categories ? repeat-visits, students? involvement and revenue generation.

 One reason for the impressive turnout, authorities feel, is that Calcutta does not have enough amusement or knowledge parks or. But the rise in number of repeat visitors and the requests for ?follow-up experiments? bear out the view that a scientific quest is catching on.

 In fact, 15 per cent of the daily crowd comprises ?repeat visitors?, eager to brush up knowledge gained during earlier visits. ?It?s a remarkable achievement,? said Ingit Mukherjee, director-general, National Council of Science Museums, under the Union cultural affairs department.

 ?Let me remind you, Science City is not an amusement park, though there is a small dose of entertainment in some shows and exhibits,? Mukherjee pointed out. ?We aim to offer hands-on experience on scientific theories and principles to visitors. We seem to be successful, as people are thronging the premises every day and taking interest in whatever they are being shown? The basic idea of the council is to make science appealing to the common people.?

 A survey of the audience profile at all the centres over the past few months show that nearly 33 per cent of the visitors at Science City are students. 

 As part of council?s policy, Science City offers a wide range of opportunities to school students for conducting experiments in physics, chemistry and mathematics.

 In another achievement, the city hub, unlike its counterparts, is self-sufficient in revenue. The money it earns through entry fees, ride charges and auditorium fees is far more than its annual expenditure of Rs 4.5 crore, it is learnt.

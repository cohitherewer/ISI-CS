 She is 16 going on 17 and already on the threshold of fame, having won the Fairever Anandalok Nayikar Khonje contest.

 Subhashree Ganguly from Burdwan came to Calcutta with dreams in her eyes, only to soon realise that her brush with the reel world was going to be for real.

 It was hard to miss the excitement in her voice as she told Metro: I couldnt believe it when they announced my name as the winner (on the Science City stage during Fairever Anandalok Puroshkar 2006). I felt elated. I love acting and have forever been awe-struck by the world of glamour. I always wanted people to watch me act and shower me with attention.

 The youngest in the final team of contestants, Subhashree has never had any formal training in acting apart from participating in school and local dance shows and plays. I thought I would finish my studies before making such an attempt but when the opportunity came my elder sister Debasree insisted that I should not let go of it, said the Class XI student of Burdwan Municipal Girls High School.

 Subhashree is thrilled that her headmistress Sapna Sinha is happy with her achievement but fears trouble in convincing the school about her attendance record. I plan to complete my Higher Secondary exams through correspondence and want to do my graduation, too. I wanted to study computer graphics but with the turn of events I dont think that will be possible, says the 16-year-old, who lives in a joint family with her parents, uncles, aunts and sister.

 The youngster is gearing up to shift base to Calcutta to kick-start her acting career, having already landed herself a handful of offers. I still dont know about my contest-winning contract but director Anurag Basu (of Murder and Gangster fame) has contacted me for a role in his new serial on Sony TV. Probhat Roy has also approached me for a role in his forthcoming film Pitribhumi. I will have to appear for a screen test before bagging any of the roles. 

 The aspiring actress with a knack for dancing follows a yoga regimen and maintains her diet as prescribed in the grooming session leading up to the contest. 

 A years break from studies is 

 what Subhashree intends to take before sorting out her filmi 

 commitments. Im already missing my home and friends in 

 Burdwan but they are all happy for me, says the girl who 

 dreams of acting with Salman Khan.

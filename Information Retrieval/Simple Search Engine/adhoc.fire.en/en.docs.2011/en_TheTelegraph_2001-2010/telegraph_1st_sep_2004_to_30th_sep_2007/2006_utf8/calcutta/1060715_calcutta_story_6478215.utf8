 Traditions are vulnerable to the passage of time and can become a part of history if not nurtured for posterity. Hindustani classical music was sustained over generations by royal patronage. The gradual disappearance of this form of support led to a dilution of musical traditions and values. Committed to promoting, propagating and creating training systems for Indian classical music in modern times, ITC-Sangeet Research Academy presents a programme of Hindustani classical music featuring ITC-SRA gurus and scholars. Participants (today): Sucheta Ganguly, Sandip Bhattacharya, Ruchira Kale and Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar (vocal) and Abir Hossain (sarod); (tomorrow) Sumana Gupta, Nilanjana Roy, Sameehan Kashalkar and Vidushi Girija Devi (vocal) and Supratik Sengupta (sitar).

 Event: Programme of Hindustani classical music 

When: Today and tomorrow at 6 pm 

Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

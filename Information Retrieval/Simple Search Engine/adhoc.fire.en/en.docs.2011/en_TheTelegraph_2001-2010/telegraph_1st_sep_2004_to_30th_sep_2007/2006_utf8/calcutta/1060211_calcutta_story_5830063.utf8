 What: National launch of 

 Silver Shadow, a fragrance for men from the house of Davidoff.

 Where: Grain of Salt.

 When: Friday noon.

 Take a look: Designed by Thierry de Baschmakoff, the rectangular bottle in smooth clear glass has a simple yet chic appeal. The fragrance by perfumer Francis Kurkdjian is fresh and boasts a combination of rich amber, saffron, bitter orange, cinnamon, clove and Siamese benzoin. 

 The range consists of natural spray eau de toilette and after shave. Silver Shadow will be available at all major stores from mid-February.

 Pocket pinch: The eau de toilette is priced at Rs 3,350 and Rs 2, 350 for the 100 ml and 50 ml packs respectively, and the 100 ml after shave bottle comes for Rs 2,300.

 Voiceover: The product is for men who are mature, intense and charismatic, smiles Tony Chin, chief executive officer of Beauty Concepts, the company marketing Davidoff in India.

 Petal push

 What: Floralia 2006. 

 Where: The Agri-Horticultural Society of India at 1, Alipore Road.

 When: Friday afternoon.

 The show: The much-awaited annual show was inaugurated on Friday by Justice Ashok Ganguly of the Calcutta High Court. A no-show by Sourav Ganguly was a big disappointment for visitors. The three-day gala displays flowers, foliage and household plants, cactus and bonsai. It also showcases flower arrangement and table display skills. The show should end on a glamorous note with Shilpa Shetty billed to make an appearance on Sunday.

 Pictorial allegories

 The paintings of Tanup Kumar Nath are charged with physical energy and sensuality, along with aesthetic charm and expressiveness. The ongoing art exhibition has on show a few of his earlier canvases and more of his recent creations. The main source of Naths works is the relation of the natural environment with men. In his paintings, natural motifs appear not as figurative accessories but with a definite character of their own, always consistent with the tone of the visual narrative. His distortion of forms or male and female human figures is spontaneous and rhythmic, giving them a distinctive quality of fluid flexibility. Figurative and symbolic in design, his compositions, however, tell a story about the social, historical and psychological pressures of contemporary society. Though his earlier works were done mostly with colours mixed with grey or black, his recent paintings are a riot of brilliant colours: red, blue, green and orange. Creating a world of fantasy and unreality, his paintings radiate unbounded joy and levity.

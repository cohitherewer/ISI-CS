The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Office-goers who board buses from Dunlop bridge to Esplanade are facing problems during peak hours due to the unending traffic snarls at Sinthi More, Chiria More, Shyambazar and especially the area around Tobin Road. Other heavy-traffic zones like Bally bridge and Tallah bridge are adding to this chaos, resulting in inconveniences to the commuters who are forced to wait for hours for public transport during office time. 

 Despite repeated requests, appeals, demonstration and memoranda, no action has been taken in this regard. I would like to request the authorities to take immediate steps to overcome this problem.

 Nowadays, the Calcutta High Court premises have become a hub of various suspicious activities. On any working day, you can find drivers playing either cards or ludo. I am sure heavy bets are involved in these innocent games. Besides, various illegal articles like illicit country-made liquor, hemp, cannabis etc are often sold here. Will the authorities look into the matter at the earliest?

 Arindam Basu, Saptagram, Bisharpara. 

 Despite smoking in public places being banned, every day I see a lot of people lighting up especially in the local trains and buses. I request the authorities to take immediate steps against such practices and penalise the offenders, so that people are deterred from creating nuisance in public places.

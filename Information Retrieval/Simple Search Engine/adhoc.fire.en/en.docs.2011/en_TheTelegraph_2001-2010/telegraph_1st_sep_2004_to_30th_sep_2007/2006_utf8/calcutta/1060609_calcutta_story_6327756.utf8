 Cellphone records lead cops to robbers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Two members of a gang of robbers were arrested on the northern fringes of the city early on Thursday. The city and district police were on the lookout for the duo. 

 Officers of Kasba police station had been tracking one of the men for the past three days. Arnab Yadav, alias Tukai, was picked up from a hideout in Bijpur, in North 24-Parganas. His associate Shibu Sen, better known as Shiba, was held in Belghoria.

 An aide of the arrested duo, identified as Kappa, managed to give police the slip. He escaped minutes before police raided the house in Belghoria.

 Superintendent of South 24-Parganas police S.N. Gupta said Tukai and Shiba were involved in the robbery of at least 20 petrol pumps, milk depots and stationery shops in and around the city over the past six months. ?We are trying to find out if they were involved in any other major crime,? he added.

 Police obtained the cellphone number of Tukai a week ago. ?We immediately got in touch with the service provider,? said an officer of Kasba police station. 

 The outgoing and incoming calls from the phone were monitored from then on.

 ?With the data supplied by the service provider, we figured out Tukai?s location. We decided to conduct the raid as soon as he entered Bijpur. A team of eight was constituted for the operation,? stated another officer. 

 While one team of officers monitored Tukai?s location from the control room, another team surrounded the area. 

 ?We combed every house in the locality to arrest Yadav,? claimed Gupta. 

 Based on the information provided by Tukai, Shiba was picked up later.

 Florian Gallenberger may have got busy with his next project 

 to be shot in China, but some of his cast members did troop 

 into town for the release of his debut feature film in Bengali, 

 Shadows of Time (Shomoyer Chhayaguli), on 

 Friday. 

 Lead pair Prashant Narayanan and Tannishtha Chatterjee, who play Ravi and Masha in this tragic love story, signed posters at INOX City Centre before rushing off to INOX Forum to catch the show with Tumpa Das, one of the two child actors in the film. Tumpa, who plays child Masha, and Sikander, who plays young Ravi, were chosen by Florian after auditioning around 7,000 schoolchildren. I am very excited to see myself on the big screen, giggled Tumpa.

 For Prashant and Tannishtha, the two-day Calcutta stay was a chance to catch up with friends and memories. The two spent the evening at Olypub on Park Street before dropping into Someplace Else at The Park.

 I have been to Calcutta several times before to shoot for TV with my friend Indranil Goswami and also with Anurag Basu. For Shadows..., I stayed here for nearly two months, and Olypub is my favourite haunt, smiled Prashant. Anjan Dutt was playing at Someplace Else. There we were joined by Subratada (Sen) and other people from the Bibar team, said Tannishtha.

 Shadows of Time is playing 

 at INOX Forum and City Centre, 89 Cinemas, Fame and Globe.

Not long ago, there was just one 

 private art gallery in the city and that too was interested 

 more in framing pictures than in organising art shows, recalled 

 veteran artist Paritosh Sen at the launch of the new art 

 website, www.contemporaryart-india.com at the Bengal Club 

 on Friday.

 The two-day show featured the 

 current ensemble of 47 artists available on this website. 

 Curators Roshmi Raychaudhuri and Baidehi Chatterjee said 

 that the site would, apart from functioning as a sourcing 

 and sales outlet, play an active part in disseminating information 

 on trends in modern Indian art, artworks and artists.

 The show is mainly meant to focus 

 on upcoming and unrecognised talents but there are several 

 big names keeping them company. From the sketches of Rabindranath 

 Tagore to Nikhil Biswass Migrators and Storm Horses, 

 from Paritosh Sens Girl Eating Corn to Reba Hores 

 Friends, they all mingle with the experimental and often 

 refreshing works of the young and not-so-young artists.

 The moon in Prakash Karmakars 

 Landscape has dropped like a golden ball under the palm 

 tree, Paresh Maitys Courtyard depicts an old north 

 Calcutta home, Chhatrapati Duttas untitled work celebrates 

 the experience of coming apart through torn books and loose 

 clothes hooks, Sajal Roy captures the First Step a 

 child takes with his mothers support, lines and contrasting 

 colours bring out the sense of emptiness and space in Subhra 

 Chatterjees Solitary, Munindra Rajbongshis Profile, 

 Malay Sahas Outside the Window... all catch the eye.

 It was not so easy for artists. 

 It was once difficult to find buyers even for a Paritosh 

 Sen or a Nikhil Biswas. Now, the artists are struggling 

 to meet the tremendous demand, said Baidehi Chatterjee, 

 whose sister Roshmi had been forced to close their gallery 

 Artage due to the depressed market.

 This time round they are not going 

 in for a permanent display area. The website, they hope, 

 will introduce the world to the creative energy in 

 Bengal. The sisters also have a store in Alipore and 

 plan to host more than four big shows a year.

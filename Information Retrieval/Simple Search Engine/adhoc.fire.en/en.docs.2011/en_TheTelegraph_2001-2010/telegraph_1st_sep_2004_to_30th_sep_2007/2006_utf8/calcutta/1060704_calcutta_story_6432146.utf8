The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Helmets decreed for tower labourers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A day after a labourer had a fatal fall from the 32nd floor of the second tower of South City, the developers of the Prince Anwar Shah Road mega housing project on Monday made it mandatory for all workers to wear safety belts and helmets.

 ?Labourers will not be allowed to work if they do not wear helmets and safety belts,? said D.J. Chakraborty, chief business development manager of the project.

 With Sujan Khatua?s death, the on-site toll has risen to six. Police have started a case of unnatural death, though the South City authorities claimed after a preliminary investigation that Khatua died because of ?his own negligence?.

 ?Our inquiry reveals that though Khatua was supplied with a safety belt and a helmet, he was not wearing them when the mishap occurred. The net that was fixed for the workers?s safety came crashing down with him,? said a project official.

 ?This is a unique project and the labourers do not have the experience of working at such heights. They have to strictly follow the safety rules,? Chakrabarty pointed out.

 Police clarified on Tuesday that there has been no complaint against the contractors. 

 ?No one has lodged a complaint against the contractors,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas. ?We are aware that there was another mishap at the site three months ago, in which three labourers were killed? But we cannot not initiate action in the absence of a complaint.?

 Talking to Metro, several labourers, however, complained about the lack of proper working conditions at the site. Some said the lifts often break down and they have to climb all 32 storeys.

 ?We keep mum, as the contractor will not give us work if we raise our voice. We are not being treated properly,? said a labourer. 

 Another said he had been ?pulled up? two months ago for protesting against ?irregular payments?.

 One moment of glory is worth an age without a name.

 Even as Sushmita Sen scribbled these words while launching a new restaurant in Salt Lake on Saturday evening, she promised many more such moments of glory when she starts her own entertainment zone early next year in Calcutta.

 Its like a completion of a cycle for me, the actress, looking resplendent in an all-white outfit, told Metro. I belong to Calcutta but I grew up everywhere else. And now that I am starting my maiden business venture, I am back to this city. Its like building a dream. Its like starting all over again.

 Sushmita has other reasons for choosing Calcutta as her first business destination. Its a metro, but unlike Mumbai and Delhi, the privatised entertainment form is still growing in this city, she explained. Calcutta is also home to my business partner Rajat Dalmia. So, what better place than this city, where I can connect at a home level?

 So, what exactly is Sushmitas entertainment hotspot all about? Its a beautiful 12,000 sq ft property on the 10th floor of a building in the heart of Calcutta overlooking Victoria Memorial, described the former Miss Universe, even as daughter Renee listened intently. The property will house a nightclub, a restaurant, a cigar lounge with the best wines around, and 4,000 sq ft of open space.

 To be promoted under a new company Sensazio Leisure Private Limited, the property will be designed by Thailand-based architects DWP (Design Worldwide Partnership), famous for building the worlds highest restaurant, Sirocco, in Bangkok. We are yet to decide on the names of all the sections but we are calling the nightclub Sssshhh, the restaurant Poison and the lounge 8, added Sushmita.

 Calling herself the creative front in the joint venture, Sushmita is clear in what her guests will have in store once they step into her entertainment haunt, which is also set to have the citys first water beds. It will be a world where you will not be judged, smiled the actress. There will be no discrimination, no biases. You dont have to come there every day, but whenever you are there, you will be able to make a moment out of it.

 And what is the target group? Aspirational remarked Sushmita. We are not only catering to a certain section of the city but to all human beings.

 One things certain, though. Come 2007, and Sushmita Sen will ensure that for Calcuttans Zindaggi Rocks.

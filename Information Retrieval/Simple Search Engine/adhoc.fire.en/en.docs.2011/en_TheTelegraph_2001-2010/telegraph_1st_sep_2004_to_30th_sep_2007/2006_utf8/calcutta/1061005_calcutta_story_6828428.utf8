 Buddha vow on studio

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After days of deliberation on the governments privatisation pitch for Technicians Studio, Tollywood won a breather on Wednesday from the man who matters.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met a group of actors and technicians at Nandan in the evening and assured them that the move to lease out the ailing studio wouldnt jeopardise the interests of the film industry. 

 The chief minister said the government would go ahead with privatisation but promised that the premises wont be used for any purpose other than studio work, said actor Biplab Chatterjee, who was present at the meeting, along with Artistes Forum secretary Prosenjit, Soumitra Chatterjee and Tapas Pal, among others.

 Technicians will be leased out to Zee Telefilms, the only private player to have submitted a tender in response to the governments privatisation call.

 The government would be forming a committee, comprising members of the CMDA, Artistes Forum and some technicians guilds in the next 10 days, Chatterjee added.

 The committee will monitor if Zee Telefilms is complying with the terms and conditions that will soon be laid out, he explained.

 The government will chalk out the terms and conditions after a meeting with representatives of Zee Telefilms.

 Chief minister Bhattacharjee will then explain the clauses to the artistes, technicians and producers, later this month.

 The 35 employees on the payroll of Technicians Studio will continue as permanent staff, said Pronab Chowdhury, secretary, Eastern India Cinetel Welfare Trust.

 We have asked for non-AC floors with acoustics, digital sound recording theatre and AVID edit set-up, which the government is willing to provide, added Chowdhury. 

 The state government took over Technicians from private ownership in 1979 when most studios were closing down.

 The decision to lease out the 70-year-old studio to a private player comes at a time when the annual drain on the state exchequer from the Tollygunge address amounts to Rs 40 lakh.

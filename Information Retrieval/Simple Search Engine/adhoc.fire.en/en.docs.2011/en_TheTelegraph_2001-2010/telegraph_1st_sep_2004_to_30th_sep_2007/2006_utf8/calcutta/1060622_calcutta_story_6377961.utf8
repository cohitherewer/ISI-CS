The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Grease palm or grind to halt

 - Another time, another place, the same story unfolds ? of truckers forced to buy safe passage

 A sergeant takes up position 

 to extort ?road tax? from defiant drivers 

 Off Fort William, 

 Gate no. 4, June 20, noon

 A sergeant (also seen supervising 

 the ?raid? in Hastings on Saturday, the pictures of which 

 appeared in Metro on Tuesday) has taken up position 

 off Fort William gate number 4.

 A traffic constable 

 stretches out his long arm ? not to uphold the law, 

 but to make a killing. Pictures by Amit Datta 

 A traffic constable gets busy 

 flagging down passing commercial vehicles. When the vehicle 

 comes to a halt, he slips his hand into the driver?s cabin. 

 Once safe passage has been ?bought?, the wheels roll on. 

 Drivers who refuse to grease the palm of the constable are 

 shepherded to the sergeant for ?verification of documents? 

 and hefty ?road? tax.

 Time-table

 The give-and-go 

 game between cops and truckers

 Ironically, the schedule for joint 

 raids to book illegal vehicles and errant drivers is drawn 

 up by the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) in 

 Lalbazar. Officers from the traffic guard and the local 

 police station team up ? for a cause. ?This is an organised 

 racket,? said an officer.

 Officialspeak

 Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee told Metro: ?Stern action is taken against any traffic sergeant found fleecing truck drivers. There are some (policemen) who indulge in such practices, but it does not mean that this is very organised. There are many policemen, especially traffic sergeants, who help people in distress.?

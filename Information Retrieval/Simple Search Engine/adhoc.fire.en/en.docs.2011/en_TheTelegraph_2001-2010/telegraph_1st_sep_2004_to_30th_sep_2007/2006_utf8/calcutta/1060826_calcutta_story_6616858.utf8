The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A victim of Hong Kong syndrome

 - Educated youths from minority community opt for illegal business abroad

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Calcutta port lies ailing and deserted. Its fortunes are linked to those of its workforce, temporary or permanent. The casual workers lost their jobs and most of the permanent employees were offered VRS. Now, the local populace can only survive by adopting a life on the grey fringes of society. A Telegraph picture 

 Anisur Mannan and his wife Jamila are eagerly waiting for Id-ul-Fitr. The Mannan household, on Maulana Mohammed Ali Road, in Kidderpore, is drawing up special plans for the October festival, which will coincide with the return of the couples only son Abdul Mannan, 28, from Hong Kong, after one-and-a-half years. 

 Our dream now is to get him married and we have already found a bride for him. The marriage will be solemnised a week after Id. I have spoken to my son and he is willing, smiles 56-year-old Anisur.

 But ask him about his sons vocation and the smile fades. Stealing a glance at Abduls laminated photograph placed on a wooden table at the corner of the 9x11 ft room in a dingy Kidderpore lane Anisur slips into silence.

 The sound of azaan from a nearby mosque lifts the veil of silence and the doting father summons the courage to speak the truth: My son is now in Hong Kong and he works in a restaurant, but illegally He was a university topper in Arabic, but instead of an academic career, he chose to be a carrier.

 As a carrier, Abduls job is to smuggle in electronic goods from Hong Kong and supply them to Fancy Market and Five Star Market, the biggest smuggled goods market in Calcutta.

 I spent whatever I could for his education But the degree could not get him a job and he fell victim to the Hong Kong syndrome, Mannan, a former employee of the Calcutta Port Trust offered VRS eight years ago, sobs as he leaves for his zohar (afternoon prayer).

 Anisur is not an isolated case. The story is much the same for over 300 Muslim youths some of them with above average academic track records in the citys port area. They work illegally in hotels and restaurants dotting the streets of Hong Kong and act as carriers to smuggle electronic goods into city markets.

 The modus operandi is simple: initially, they travel to Hong Kong on a tourist visa along with seniors in the trade and learn the rules of the game. Then, they overstay with some odd job in a restaurant or hotel. After saving some money, they surrender to the authorities and get deported to Calcutta. Within a few months, they manage new passports through paid agents and set off for Hong Kong, again.

 This is a new trend and it can be linked with the decline of Calcutta port from its position of pre-eminence, observes Ilias Islahi, former councillor of ward no. 78.

 According to him, a large number of people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh migrated to Calcutta in the Sixties and Seventies, the heydays of Calcutta port, and settled here. From around 8,000 to 10,000 labourers, permanent and temporary, the ports headcount has dwindled to 600 to 800.

 Directly and indirectly, the port had an impact on peoples livelihood in the area. But with the shift of business to Haldia, things changed. Casual workers lost jobs and permanent staffers had to opt for voluntary retirement, explains Islahi.

 The religious factor also acted as a barrier in the job market for many Muslim youths. And in the absence of any vocational training, alternative employment scope remained few and far between.

 People have told me on my face that they will not employ Muslims, says Akbar, who works in a medical shop under a false (Hindu) name. He has to marry off three sisters, but the 25-year-old is clueless how.

 Becoming a carrier seems to be a better option, smiles Akbar, who earns around Rs 3,000 per month. His monthly earnings will go up to Rs 15,000 if he decides to take the plunge and join Abdul or Mohammed Allauddin, another class-topper-turned-carrier.

 The government is aware of the trend and also the trigger behind the Hong Kong syndrome. Syed Sajjad Zaher Adnan, chairman of the West Bengal Minorities Commission, says: It is very sad that educated youths of the community are getting involved in illegal activities. Its a socio-economic problem and has to be handled properly.

 Till that happens, Abduls father will always hang his head in shame every time he is asked what his beloved son does for a living.

 More travail is in store for patients turning up at state-run teaching hospitals. 

 Students and junior doctors protesting reservation have decided to shut down the outpatients? departments (OPDs) at Medical College and Hospital and Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Monday and Tuesday.

 The agitators, however, claimed that ?parallel OPDs? would be run on the hospital premises and patients would not be inconvenienced.

 ?We will keep the OPDs closed for the coming two days, like we did on Saturday. Parallel OPDs will start functioning by 9 am and the service will not be disrupted,? said Avrojit Raha, a final-year student at Medical College and a member of the Youth for Equality, which has been spearheading anti-reservation protests across the country.

 ?No patient will have to go away without treatment and we will also distribute free medicines,? Raha claimed.

 On Saturday, agitators at Medical College and Hospital pushed the doctors and patients out of the OPDs and locked the rooms.

 An agitating doctor at National Medical College said: ?We have plans to shut down the OPDs and run parallel units. But we will not exert force on anyone. The senior doctors will be requested to leave the OPDs as a mark of support for our movement.?

 The authorities of both the hospitals asserted that they would ensure services were not disrupted. ?The agitating doctors and students have not informed us about their planned shutdown of the OPDs. If they do so, we have to take steps to keep the system running,? said National Medical College superintendent M. Mukherjee. 

 A.N. Biswas, deputy superintendent of Medical College, said the higher authorities were informed about the development. 

 The Junior Doctors? Council on Sunday vowed to oppose the move of closing the OPDs. ?We will sit with the protesters and try to dissuade them from shutting down the departments. We will move the higher authorities if they refuse to pay heed to our plea,? said Shovanendu Das, state president of the council. 

 Stepping up their protests, students and junior doctors will start a 48-hour relay hunger strike at Medical College from Monday. 

 A hunger strike is already on at National Medical College, which has been joined by students and junior doctors from all teaching hospitals in the city.

 A ceasework continued at the state-run hospitals in the city on Sunday. The emergency wards functioned, though there were reports of some patients being referred to other hospitals from the Medical College emergency ward. However, the authorities said there were no major disruption.

 After death, quibble over dengue

 A day after the death of Biswajit Pramanik at National Medical College and Hospital, civic health officials confirmed that the 35-year-old resident of Regent Park had been suffering from dengue.

 ?This has been confirmed by the test conducted by National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Disease (NICED) on the blood sample of Pramanik,? said mayoral council member (health) Subodh De.

 ?But the hospital had not asked NICED to carry out the confirmatory test to ascertain that the death was due to dengue. So, it is yet to be ascertained if the death was caused by dengue or by other medical complications,? he added.

 When contacted late on Tuesday, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said he did not know about Pramanik?s blood test report.

 But earlier in the day, the mayor had said there was ?no cause to panic? over the spread of the disease in Calcutta as only four cases of primary dengue had been detected this year and treated.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has taken up a drive to prevent dengue, he added. ?There should not be any accumulation of clear water. People should also try to protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing full-sleeves, for example,? the mayor said. 

 The dengue vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, breeds in clear water. Anti-larvae and anti-mosquito drugs are being sprayed in neighbourhoods.

 Bhattacharyya added that the CMC was conducting door-to-door surveillance. Borough 10 in south Calcutta, where dengue cases were detected last year, was getting special attention. 

 ?There are stray cases of dengue through the year and at present, there is nothing to worry,? said K. C. Barui, director of health services.

 On water accumulating in stretches dug up by the CMC, the mayor said: ?We have already taken up a drive to keep the areas free from accumulated clean water.? 

 But the city is full of dug-up patches. The intersection below Taratala flyover and Diamond Harbour Road, towards Tollygunge Circular Road, is an example. Residents said the CMC started drainage work here more than 15 days ago, but while the pipes have been laid, they are not yet covered.

 Going places with quilt art

 of International Folk Art, Santa Faye 

 She has used the art of the poor 

 mans quilt as a tool for the empowerment 

 of women in rural Bengal for as long as 24 years now.

 And if things work out as planned 

 by the West Bengal government, kantha queen Shamlu 

 Dudeja will be taking her network to several other villages 

 in the state.

 The woman and child development 

 and social welfare development department of the state government 

 has approached me to take the kantha network to the 

 villages. They want to fund the training that my team will 

 provide the women there, says Shamlu.

 The kantha enthusiast is 

 more than willing to accept the offer, provided the government 

 guarantees proper marketing and promotion of 

 kantha products. I am talking to them about 

 the feasibility of the plan, but I will be glad to get an 

 opportunity to generate more and more awareness about kantha, 

 she adds.

 While back home the humble stitch 

 is yet to get the recognition that it deserves, Shamlu is 

 happy with the increasing international acceptance of the 

 kantha. Her exhibition of kantha pieces at 

 the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Faye, New 

 Mexico, in July drew footfalls and eyeballs that surpassed 

 expectations. We sold 80 per cent of the stock we 

 were carrying. And we sold all the saris and shawls that 

 belonged to our personal wardrobes, smiles Shamlu.

 While saris, shawls, scarves, 

 jackets, throws and wall hangs received amazing response, 

 other tailored garments didnt sell that well, admits 

 Shamlu. 

 The annual fair showcases ethnic 

 arts from African and South American countries like Mexico, 

 Peru, Argentina, Chile and more, as well as from Bengal 

 and Rajasthan. It was an enriching experience with 

 the folk arts of so many countries displayed together, 

 remembers Shamlu.

 So, the kantha shared stage 

 with carpets from Uzbekistan, terracotta from Mexico and 

 France, French pottery and many more.

 The kantha fitted 

 in well, the mixed crowd liked the bright Indian colours. 

 In fact, one old lady came back on the second day with a 

 magnifying glass to see whether they were actually stitches 

 or prints. She couldnt believe her eyes, smiles 

 Shamlu.

 Just before the Santa Faye fair, 

 the lady showcased her creations at exhibitions in France 

 and London in June. She showcased in south France at a friends 

 house and also visited boutiques there with her work. Orders 

 are now pouring in from them, she reveals.

 In London, the house of a Scottish 

 couple on the banks of the Thames hosted her works. I 

 have never got so much appreciation before, she recounts, 

 visibly overwhelmed. And to follow it up, Shamlu will visit 

 many other boutiques in France next month.

 While kantha remains her 

 forte, next on Shamlus agenda is popularising Indian 

 terracotta globally.

 The terracotta work of Bengal 

 is another art that is dying for lack of marketing and recognition. 

 I am trying to focus on the revival of terracotta jewellery.

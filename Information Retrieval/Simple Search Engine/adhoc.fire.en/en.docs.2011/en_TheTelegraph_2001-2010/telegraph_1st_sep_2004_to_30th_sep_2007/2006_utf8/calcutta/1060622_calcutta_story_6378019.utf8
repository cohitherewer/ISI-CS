The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Unmoved by innovation: Expert

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 J. Visser, director of the Holland firm

 J. Visser, director, EWW Technische Bedrijven BV, the Dutch firm that is providing the technology of the car park, is still quite stunned by what happened on Friday. 

 ?I am certainly not very happy with the incident,? said Visser, who reached Calcutta on Sunday and left on Tuesday for New Delhi, where he will meet government officials for other possible car park projects. His visit was pre-planned. ?There was a small riot,? said Visser, who is based in Amsterdam. ?People were throwing stones. It seems that some people here are opposed to modern and innovative products in the country,? he added, though chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may beg to differ. 

 ?I have never experienced this in any other country,? he added. His company has built 40-odd car parks in Europe, including Germany. It has also worked in Iraq and is looking forward to projects in China and Australia. 

 Two members of Visser?s team from Holland were present during the incident. 

 But he added that he did not face any other problem and did not want to make the protest into a big issue. ?It was only an incident. The people here are very warm. When the protesters see the end product, they will understand our work,? said Visser. 

 His partner and uncle, Fj. H. Visser, who was also visiting Calcutta, said that it was encouraging to see India making the steel parts that are being used to build the car park. 

 The car park, said Visser and Simplex, the Indian partner, will be the first fully-automated underground car park in India. ?The system will be based on the Rubik?s Cube principle,? said J. Visser. A car, which will be lowered into the second underground floor after the owner leaves it at one of the five lifts on Lindsay Street, opposite New Market, will be parked mechanically according to empty slots. ?Since no one can get into the car park, it is a safe system,? said Visser. 

 He added that the Calcutta car park would be of international standards. 

 But the entrances to the car park and shopping plaza, which are being built, are run-of-the-mill designs and a contrast to the ornate red fa?ade of New Market. The vases look out of place. Not at all Amsterdam.

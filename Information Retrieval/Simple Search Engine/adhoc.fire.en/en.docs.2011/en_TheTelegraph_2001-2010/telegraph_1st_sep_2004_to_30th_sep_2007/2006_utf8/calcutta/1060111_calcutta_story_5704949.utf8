 Antique haul after arrest

 - Victorian artefacts seized from garment-seller?s residence

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ekbalpore police on Tuesday busted an antique racket by arresting a small-time seller of woollen garments and seizing 90 items, valued at over Rs 25 lakh, from his residence.

 Sohail Mullick, the 35-year-old trader, walked into a trap laid by the cops at the intersection of Ibrahim Road and Sudhir Bose Road in the afternoon. Following his arrest, sleuths have launched a hunt for the other members of his gang.

 According to cops, the gang collected antiques from different places and sold them at a premium, even outside the country. ?Quite a few of the seized items seem to be from the Victorian era. The rest seem even older. An organised racket seems to have procured them. We are trying to find out more about the matter,? said a senior officer of Ekbalpore police station.

 The items include two Nataraj statues, a Buddha head, bronze headgear, silver pieces and wooden artefacts. 

 Of the silver sculptures, the most intricate is a figure of a hound. Besides, there are masks of deities, a demon carved in wood, a brass shield and figurines to ward off evil spirits.

 All of the antiques were found carefully wrapped in clothes in two bags at Mullick?s residence.

 ?During interrogation, he claimed to have bought the items at an auction. But there are inconsistencies in his claim. A few names don?t match. Besides, how can a woollen rag seller afford to buy such costly antiques?? asked the officer.

 He added that the trader has so far not cooperated with the cops. 

 Preliminary investigations suggest Mullick, a resident of Karl Marx Sarani, was the conduit of a bigger player having links in Mumbai and Nepal. 

 He would keep the items with him and dispose of them as instructed. At times, the trader met buyers in the city.

 On a few occasions, he even delivered the antiques to the buyers, said the officers. They believe Mullick met most of the clients in the garb of a garment-seller.

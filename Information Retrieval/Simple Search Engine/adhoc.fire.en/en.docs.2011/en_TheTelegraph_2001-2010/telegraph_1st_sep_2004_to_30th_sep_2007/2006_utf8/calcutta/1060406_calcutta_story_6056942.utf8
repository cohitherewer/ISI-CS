 Understanding the future better

 NISHA LAHIRI

 Think Tank: Experiments 

 and projects for youngsters to come up with creative 

 ideas 

 It?s a conclave of a novel kind, not simply because of a meeting of minds old and young on the same platform. 

 The Knowledge Conclave, to be held at Science City from April 6 to 8, will encompass the sciences, social service and the industry for a better understanding of the future.

 ?Thinking creatively? and out of the box is the primary purpose of the event, organised by New Wave Display Services and supported by Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Department of Atomic Energy.

 The interactive platform is meant for an exchange of ideas between school and college students, as well as industry, technology providers, research establishments, academic institutions and educationists. 

 There will be plenty of panel discussion on various issues, but participating students from around 35 city schools and around 15 colleges have already been assigned social impact projects to work on. Science experiments, exhibitions, presentations and more projects complete the three-day line-up. The daily schedule is from 10 am to 5 pm.

 ?Initially, we had planned it to showcase the industry opportunities in West Bengal,? says A.K. Deb of New Display Services. ?But then, what is the future without the youth? So, the next step was to include students in the event.?

 The ?tremendous response? from educational institutions prompted Deb to add that even if the conclave couldn?t be an annual affair, it could certainly be a biennial one. 

 The idea is to help the youngsters think ?originally?, with the education system allowing little scope in that regard. ?The event is an effort towards flowering of the knowledge base,? explains Deb.

 ?So much is about learning by heart and depending on memory. We wanted to get them thinking along creative lines and search their brains for new ideas,? adds Sister Cyril of Loreto Sealdah and member, advisory committee, Knowledge Conclave ? Kolkata Convergence.

 Each school will participate with around 30 to 60 students, while Loreto Sealdah has put forward 90 girls from Classes VIII and IX. College students will share the dais with eminent personalities like state IT secretary G.D. Gautama, industrialist Harsh Neotia, Modern High School principal Devi Kar and Nasscom?s Kiran Karnik. 

 The topics up for discussion include the national and global perception of India, the country?s future science and technology base, utilising a Rs 6,000-crore education cess fund and human resources. 

 A unique activity is the literary project ? on Day I, the youngsters will be mixed and divided into groups of eight and given three quotes from famous personalities. By the final day, they will have to come up with an audio-visual presentation connecting the three ideas and merging them into one theme.

 The student social impact projects will be judged, and on Day III, the finalists will make their presentations. The top three will be awarded. ?One of the judging criteria is conviction, and so the hope is to implement the best ideas after the conclave is over,? says Sister Cyril.

 ?We hope that the Knowledge Conclave will encourage everyone to think differently,? sums up Deb.

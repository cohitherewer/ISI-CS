 Bring on the bling! Its 

 that time of the year again when weddings and parties block 

 your social diary. Enough of the OTT (over the top) look 

 replete with flashy sequins and red lips; metallic shades 

 are back in favour this season and not just in your jewellery, 

 embellishments or accessories. From Marc Jacobs to Manish 

 Malhotra to Nandita Mahtani, gold is high on every designers 

 mind at the moment. And the metallic hue extends to your 

 make-up as well.

 GoodLife finds out more 

 about the metal magic.

 Wardrobe

 Gold happens to be Bollywood designer 

 Manish Malhotras favourite colour at the moment. Kareenas 

 sexy number in Yeh mera dil from Don, Preity 

 Zintas short skirt for Wheres the party tonight 

 in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Karismas show-stopper 

 outfit in Manishs couture show in Mumbai its 

 a gold rush, honey. Gold is a very sexy colour, it 

 looks great on Indian skin tones and goes a long way in 

 making a woman look beautiful, says Manish.

 While the LBD (little black dress) 

 is being happily replaced by the sexy gold number at super-glam 

 parties, for more earthly occasions gold embellishments 

 are ruling, big time.

 The Stylefile Winter Show 2006 

 in town last weekend reiterated the trend. While some had 

 at least one metallic shimmering piece in their collections, 

 almost all the 11 designers used gold in surface ornamentation. 

 From Anamika Khanna, Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Shantanu and Nikhil 

 Mehra to Rohit Bal, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Gaurav Gupta, 

 most used the metallic shimmer to up the glam quotient of 

 their winter lines.

 For GoodLife, Tollywood 

 star Swastika Mukherjee has been bedecked in gold by city 

 designer Sayon Mitra. A corset embellished with zardosi 

 and stone work has been teamed with a jacket and boot-cut 

 trousers. While the corset is in jamevar, the trousers 

 are made of raw silk. The ensemble is in dull gold with 

 a reddish tinge.

 Make-up

 Gold shimmer for the face is being 

 recommended for all skin tones. Gold make-up is just 

 perfect for the winter party season. But one must remember 

 that when going for the gold look, dont combine brighter 

 hues; the effect should be monochromatic, says make-up 

 artist Aniruddha Chakladar.

 For Swastika, who has a light 

 complexion, Aniruddha has used a foundation that is two 

 or three tones darker than her skin tone and followed it 

 up with a compact of the same shade. For a darker person, 

 however, the foundation must be of the skin tone.

 Swastikas eye make-up has 

 been done with a mix of shades of gold and bronze along 

 with shades of wine for the outer edges. The eyes have been 

 lined with kohl and moderate mascara has been used on the 

 lashes.

 Next, her face has been washed 

 with bronze shimmer, slightly diluted with water. The 

 diluted powder shimmer can only be used with a waterproof 

 foundation. If your foundation is not waterproof, dust some 

 compressed shimmer on your face with a blush-on or shimmer 

 brush, advises Aniruddha.

 The cheekbones have been highlighted 

 with a darker shade of blush. A skin-tone lip colour with 

 bronze gloss has been used to complete the look.

 Sealing the sequel success

 Whatever the title, Munnabhai 2 is set to rock the nation. Writer-director RAJKUMAR HIRANI talks to Pratim D. Gupta about Lage Raho and the Dubya connection

 Did you always have a sequel to Munnabhai in mind 

 or was it born out of the success of the first film?

 I never thought of a sequel, not even when Munnabhai MBBS became such a huge hit. I was writing another script altogether which was not going anywhere. The main character in the film was turning out to be quite grim. One morning while taking a walk, I just thought what if the character is Munna. Then the whole script became light-hearted and funny. I bounced it off Vidhu Vinod Chopra and he found it damn interesting.

 What happened to Munnabhai LLB?

 Oh! That was just a thought. We planned to take a dig at the lawyers like we had done at doctors in MBBS. But it wasnt really developed.

 Why do you think Munnabhai MBBS became such 

 a cult film?

 I wouldnt like to analyse the success of the film. Once you get into analysis, you start making a rule for yourself and thats never the right way to go about making a movie. When I was making MBBS, people would ask me why I was doing a light-hearted film with an action hero and why there were no colourful scenes in the film. But I went by my gut feeling and made a film rooted in reality. I myself didnt expect it to be such a huge hit. It was on the lines of how Hrishikesh Mukherjee used to make his films and I knew a bunch of people would surely like it. I had no idea it would cut across every section of the audience.

 So were you under a lot of pressure while making the sequel?

 Yes, I was under pressure while writing and shooting the film. It happens when you keep comparing with the first film. But now that the film is done, I am pretty relaxed. Lage Raho Munnabhai has got what it should have had. We have not tried to cash in on the first film. 

 Going by the success of Phir Hera Pheri and Krrish, 

 you must be optimistic about the prospects of a sequel?

 Yes, sequels are working and more importantly distributors minds are changing. There are many unwritten rules here in the film industry. When I was making my first film, people had told me not to make a comedy. Then MBBS and Hera Pheri happened and everyone started making comedies and the trend is still on. Similarly, I was asked why I was making a sequel because sequels dont work in India. And now, everyones saying my film has a good chance. I can assure you, next year will be full of sequels.

 Was it difficult to recreate the chemistry between Sanjay 

 Dutt and Arshad Warsi?

 Not really, I had to make no extra effort. They took off from where they had left off in the first film, the way the two characters interacted. The chemistry is stronger in the new film because this time they knew what they were doing.

 How can Lage Raho Munnabhai be a sequel with Jimmy 

 Sheirgill coming back after having died in the first film?

 Exactly! More than a sequel, Lage Raho is a new adventure in Munnas life. We have Jimmy and Boman Irani from the first film playing very different characters. And then we have different actresses for the new film like Vidya Balan and Dia Mirza.

 So what is this new adventure all about?

 I would like to hold on to the storyline because that is integral to the film, like cricket was to Lagaan. Munna and Circuit are goons here of course and they are committing mistakes at every step, but their heart is in the right place. We are sending out a larger message through the film, a comment on the state of our country.

 Dont you think Anthony Kaun Hai? with the same lead 

 pair can spoil your sequel plans?

 No, because we have had two actors working together in many films before. Amitabh and Dharmendra used to feature in a lot of movies. People clearly know that it is a different film. Also, they will come in to watch Munna and Circuit and not Sanju and Arshad.

 What is the latest on the international version, Mira Nairs 

 Gangsta MD?

 Oh! I keep getting copies of newer drafts of the script. Although we have sold the rights to her company, they want inputs from us. It does make me feel good to know that someones making a Hollywood version of my creation.

 And will there be a third part to the Munna story?

 Lets see how this film does. Sanju is very keen to do a third one, Munnabhai Meets George Bush, but I would rather take a one-film break before returning to Munna again.

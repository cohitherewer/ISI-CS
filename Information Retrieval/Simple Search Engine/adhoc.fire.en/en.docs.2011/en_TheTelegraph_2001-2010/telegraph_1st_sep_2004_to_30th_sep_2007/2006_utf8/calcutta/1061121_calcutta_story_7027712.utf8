The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Body blow to cop image

 - Former shop staff beaten up all night, police refuse diary

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 He was confined to a room all night, punched, beaten with iron rods, kicked in the stomach and threatened with acid. 

 When he reached a police station in the morning, bleeding profusely, an officer asked him to go to the tea stall across the road, wash the blood and come back with a relative after a couple of days.

 The officer of Muchipara police station has dealt another body blow to the friendly face of the city force. He refused to lodge an FIR despite several requests from Dinabandhu Karmakar on Saturday morning. The 21-year-old, a resident of Ranaghat, in Nadia, had to travel all the way to the city on Monday to lodge the complaint.

 This time, police did the needful, prompted by queries about the incident by Metro. 

 Based on Karmakars statement, his employer Kanta Basak, a gold merchant, was arrested.

 When asked why action was not taken on Saturday, officer-in-charge of the police station, Jagat Mohan Roy said: I dont think it is a serious matter. Otherwise, my officers would have told me.

 According to Karmakar, he had quit Basaks jewellery-manufacturing unit on Nabin Chand Boral Street six months ago. Basak owed me Rs 1,900. I repeatedly requested him to pay the money, but he did not do so, said Karmakar.

 Around 9 pm on Friday, Karmakar was walking down Nabin Chand Boral Street. I met Basak on the way and asked him to pay my dues. He told me to accompany him. When we reached his shop, Basak dragged me inside, recalled Karmakar.

 After closing the door, Basak and his employee Siraj beat me with an iron rod. They tried to force me to write on a piece of paper that I had stolen gold from the unit. I refused and told them that if I had committed any crime, they should take me to the police. Basak stated his shop was the police station and I would have to face trial there.

 Around 1 am, Karmakar was taken to another shop, where he had to face one more round of torture. Around 7 am, his assailants took off his blood-soaked shirt and left him at Sealdah station. They snatched my monthly ticket and Rs 500, alleged Karmakar. A commuter at the station advised him to go to the cops.

 At Muchipara police station, Karmakar met sub-inspector Swapan Dutta.

 Instead of taking the youth to a hospital for check-up, the sub-inspector advised Karmakar to wash the blood and come back after two days. Later, Dutta made an entry in the General Diary (no. 1705, dated November 18). The record does not have legal value.

 Ocean drums matching beats with dhaks and American buffalo drums, violin strings setting up synch with jazz bass played Carnatic style or the Cyclops swaying with the slide guitar. All this on the racecourse, beneath the canopy of the starlit sky, on a crisp winter evening?

 The Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) is celebrating its pre-Derby night ? the precursor to the most-awaited racing event of the city, The Calcutta Derby Stakes ? by holding a fusion music concert in the Members? Stands of the racecourse. This will be the first such melody mix at the venue where thoroughbreds rule.

 ?Moksh ? The Raga Route, from Jazz to Tribal Beats? (Saturday, 7 pm), will feature Swedish bassist extraordinaire Jonas Hellborg alongside tabla and percussion exponent Tanmoy Bose and his Taaltantra. Pandit S. Shekhar on mridangam, Debashish Bhattacharya on his trademark ?Triveni? slide guitar, the Violin Brothers, along with two tribal drummers from Jharkhand and two dhakis from rural Bengal, besides Nirmalya on vocals, will complete the ensemble.

 ?We are striving hard to change the image of the racecourse and erase the stigma of gambling, which has unfortunately stuck. In the good old days, horse-racing was regarded as a sport, now most link the course with just betting. We want to change that perception through elements like music,? explains steward Sujit Bhattacharyya.

 The Members? Stands, which can ?comfortably seat about 400 people?, have been spruced up and the whole area covered in billowing canopies of flowing fabric. 

 The Victorian benches in the stands have been fitted with cushions and the aisles are being dimly lit to ensure not just easy access in the evening but also to add to the resplendence of the old marble steps. Little coal fires are being placed at strategic points to keep the guests warm.

 The musicians, too, are excited about the novel venue. ?I have once played inside a bull-fighting ring in Madrid, which was quite unique. Performing at the Calcutta racecourse should also be an exhilarating experience. We will do more acoustic than electric stuff to suit the setting,? observes Hellborg, who now has a dedicated fan following in the city.

 ?The concert is basically a journey through jazz, Indian classical, tribal and rural drumming,? says Bose, who had performed with Hellborg and Debashish Bhattacharya as Triveni. The trio has also recorded an album, being readied for a worldwide release.

 The concert will be followed by cocktails and dinner, served beneath little thatched canopies, with DJ Douglas at the console. ?While we are not allowed to commercially exploit the racecourse, events like this will attract a different milieu and bring back the sporting element in racing,? hopes steward Bhattacharyya.

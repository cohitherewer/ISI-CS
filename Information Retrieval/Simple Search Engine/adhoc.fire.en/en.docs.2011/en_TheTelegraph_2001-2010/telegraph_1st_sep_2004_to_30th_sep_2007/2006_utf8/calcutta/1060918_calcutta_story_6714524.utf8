 Indian tweak for software 

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 With the state government revealing its preference for open source software, companies are queuing up to offer solutions. 

 Last week, Novell launched its SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 operating system in Calcutta. 

 The company is hoping to make a significant dent in the Indian market with its new product. Towards that end, it has made the programme available in Bengali. It has also been adapted in Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati and Hindi. 

 We have been in discussion with the Bengal government with regard to ongoing projects. But no specific marketing has been done yet in the state, said Sandeep Menon, director of sales for Novell in West Asia. 

 Recently, the chief electoral officer in the state sent a notice to all district magistrates, instructing them to use Open Office for every election-related assignment. Though there has not been any official announcement yet, the government has hinted at using Linux operating systems in its initiatives. 

 We are confident that with Desktop 10, we will give Microsoft a run for its money, averred Prakash Advani, Novells practice head for the subcontinent.

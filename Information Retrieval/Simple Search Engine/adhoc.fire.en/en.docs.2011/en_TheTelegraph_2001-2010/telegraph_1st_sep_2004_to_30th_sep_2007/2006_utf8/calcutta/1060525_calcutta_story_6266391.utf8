The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Medicine men in remedy path

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Stranded inside a Tata Sumo in the oppressive Wednesday afternoon heat, three-year-old Ishita Mondal was crying on her mother?s lap. She was in pain, caused by a tumour on her lower spinal chord, but standing between her and the hospital were medical students and junior doctors.

 ?I have to take my daughter to the Institute of Child Health on Biresh Guha Street; she needs emergency medical care. We have been waiting here for half an hour and don?t know when we will reach,? cried Piyali, Ishita?s mother, tears rolling down her cheeks.

 A resident of Serampore, Piyali and husband Tapan were bringing their daughter to the hospital near Park Circus but were thwarted by anti-quota agitationists.

 While Ishita had her parents to console her, young Sabita Das, a resident of Kalikapur, on EM Bypass, had none.

 Nursing a painful swelling on her left hand, she was returning home from Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine on a C-12 bus that came to standstill on Darga Road. ?I have been stuck here for nearly an hour. I cannot take it any more,? she said.

 A passenger vacated his seat so Sabita could lie down a while. ?Why doesn?t someone do something?? shouted co-passenger Swadesh Chanda.

 His voice was drowned in the din of protest slogans as hundreds of medical students and some junior doctors held up traffic ? and patients ? at the vital link between the city and the Bypass.

 The situation was no better on Central Avenue, where another group of anti-reservation students choked traffic.

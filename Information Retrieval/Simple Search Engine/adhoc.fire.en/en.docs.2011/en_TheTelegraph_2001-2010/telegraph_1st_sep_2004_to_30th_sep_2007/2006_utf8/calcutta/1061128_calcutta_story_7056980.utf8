 Reflections on nature

 Simplicity of expression is the cornerstone of the creative works of Suktisubhra Pradhan. A keen observer of nature, her interest in the mysteries of the cosmic universe, along with a delicate understanding of the nuances of human feelings, gives her art a dimension that is profound and, at the same time, ubiquitous in its appeal. This exhibition showcases over 60 paintings and drawings on nature that transport viewers to a realm of realisation far beyond the immediate and the tangible. Key elements of Indian philosophy like spirituality, physiological and psychological transformation and immortality of the soul feature prominently in her works, reflecting the artists fascination for a time and space other than the real. Geometric symbols, used with careful discretion, have the power to impart to her works a density of meaning, often provoking the viewer to make queries of a metaphysical kind or seek insights into concepts and ideas of life to which he has hitherto been oblivious.

When: November 28 - December 3, 4 pm - 8 pm

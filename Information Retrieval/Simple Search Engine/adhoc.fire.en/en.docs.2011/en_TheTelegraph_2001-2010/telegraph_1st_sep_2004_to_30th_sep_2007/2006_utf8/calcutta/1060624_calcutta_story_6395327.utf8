The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Lionel Messi and Juan Riquelme

 You are soft and sensitive, cordial and child-like. You are full of romantic and helpful ideas, but at times turbulent on the emotional front. Others find you honest, youthful, inspiring and magnetic. You make up your mind quickly and usually stick to your decisions. Savings and budgets are not your strong points. ? Kusum Bhandari

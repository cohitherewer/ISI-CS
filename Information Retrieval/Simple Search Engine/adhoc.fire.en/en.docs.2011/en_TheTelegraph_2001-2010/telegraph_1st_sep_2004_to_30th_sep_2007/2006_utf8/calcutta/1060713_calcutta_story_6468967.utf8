The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dengue spurt alert

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The number of dengue cases in Calcutta and adjoining districts is likely to shoot up in comparison with last year, state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra warned in the Assembly on Wednesday.

 He admitted that one person had died of dengue in Calcutta since June and the number of people suffering from the disease was a matter of concern for the government.

 ?We have strengthened our dengue surveillance programme this year. Since the programme is on our priority list, we expect to record more cases this year, compared with the past few years,? stated Mishra. He was replying to a notice on dengue outbreak in the state, moved by Debaprasad Sarkar of the SUCI on July 3.

 The health minister told the House that 47 cases of dengue had been reported in Calcutta and seven districts between June 1 and July 4 this year. Of these, 28 cases were from the city.

 In 2005, 34 people had died of dengue in Calcutta and its adjoining districts. The number of dengue cases reported across the state between August and December last year was 6,375. In 2004, 70 cases of dengue were reported but there had been no death.

 Alarmed at the situation, the health department has alerted its local units and key private clinical establishments. They have been asked to send blood test reports to the government. ?We have already started receiving the reports,? claimed Mishra.

 According to the minister, the department launched an entomological survey on June 29. 

 The survey, he said, has so far been conducted at four sites. But ?the indices suggest moderate or low risk at the investigated sites?.

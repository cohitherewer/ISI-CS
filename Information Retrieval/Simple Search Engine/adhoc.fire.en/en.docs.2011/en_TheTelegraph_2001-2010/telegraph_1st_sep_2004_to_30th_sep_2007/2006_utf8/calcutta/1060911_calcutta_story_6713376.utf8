 Leather unit triggers ire

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Residents of BL Saha Road, in Behala, are up in arms against a leather goods factory in the neighbourhood, which they claim is posing a threat to their health.

 The residents had petitioned the state pollution control board in January, calling for the closure of Eastern Export Company. They had also written to local CPM legislator Kumkum Chakraborty.

 We had appealed to the pollution control board for the closure of the factory at 51/12, BL Saha Road, as the stench of leather and chemicals emanating from the unit has made life miserable for us. Minute leather particles suspended in air are causing respiratory problems for aged people living in the area, alleged Sanjiv Tewari, a local resident.

 The proprietor, Sambhu Agarwal, brings in leather at night, dries and treats the unfinished product before manufacturing gloves, stated Bhasker Roy, another resident.

 Agarwal claimed that he procures finished leather from Bantala. I have a licence to run the factory, which is located in an industrial belt.

 When the board team had visited the factory in February following the petition by 57 residents, the proprietor could not produce the trade licence or any other document authorising him to run the factory, recounted the boards senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee. We had ordered immediate closure of the unit. The CESC was asked to disconnect supply to the factory.

 According to Tewari, the unit did not stop functioning even for a day. After the CESC snapped supply, the proprietor brought a generator and continued operations.

 In June, Agarwal obtained a trade licence and permission from the District Industrial Centre to run the unit. Following its plea with the pollution control board to suspend the closure order, a temporary work order was issued in August. It is valid till September 20.

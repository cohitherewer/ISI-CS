 The Jadavpur University (JU) electrical 

 engineering department turned 100 this year. Established 

 in 1906 under the leadership of Pramatha Nath Bose, the 

 department boasts stalwarts like Professor Samiran Choudhuri, 

 ex-president of the Institution of Engineers (India) and 

 ex-secretary of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 As part of the year-long centenary celebration, a students programme was organised in association with The Telegraph at Madhusudan Mancha on November 3. Beginning with an audio-visual presentation charting the development of the department since its inception, the days events also included a quiz contest hosted by Abhijit Gupta of the English department of JU. Teams from St Xaviers College and chemical and electrical engineering departments of JU also participated. A team from English department of JU emerged the winner. 

 A garba performance by first-year students of the department was followed by a cultural evening where actor Kharaj Mukherjee and Indrani Sen entertained the audience. I.K. Basu, an alumnus and ex-additional chief engineer of WBSEB, said: Todays programme is a homely affair where it is more important to appreciate the students effort than to judge and criticise. 

 Sayantan, one of the organisers who is in his fourth year, reciprocated the sentiment: The programme would not have been possible without the constant help and contributions of the alumni and our teachers.

 The next phase of the celebrations includes a seminar on emerging trends in electrical engineering to be held at Science City on December 16.

 Cause for revelry

 Josephtsyna, the St Joseph Schools annual fest was held on the campus over three days from October 26. The theme of the fest was A hope to destroy the rope of dope. The funds raised at the event went towards Mukti, an organisation which helps drug addicts to recuperate.

 The first day witnessed off-stage events such as creative writing in English and vernacular languages, followed by bookmark designing. A round of Eastern music was categorised into solo, group and instrumental rounds.

 Day Two began with pot painting, followed by other off-stage events like ad spoof where participants were asked to link props with advertisements. An exciting jam session kept the audience on its feet. A round of Western music judged by the veteran Francis Lepcha rocked the auditorium.

 The third day saw students display their singing abilities in an antakshari organised by TTIS. Up next was a fashion show, followed by a fusion dance featuring some electrifying performances. The day concluded with the prize distribution ceremony.

 2006

Talent twosome

 One grew up drawing her grandmothers face since the age of two. The other stays up after studies to practise her passion. Meet Eshani and Pallavi, Bengals contenders for the Pogo Amazing Kids Awards 2006 that looks for talent across eight categories arts, sports, music, singing, dance, genius, leadership and entertainment. The nation-wide talent search is currently profiling the top five nominees from each category on Pogo. Three finalists out of the five in each segment will showcase their talent in the following eight episodes. Judges and viewers votes will decide the eight winners. Each winner will be awarded a child benefit policy of Rs 5 lakh and offered a deal with Pogo throughout 2007.

 With the stakes so high, no wonder Eshani Sarkar, a Class VI student of Auxilium Convent School, Bandel, is tense. What if I dont win? As a finalist, I cant even compete next year! she laments. Pallavi Majumdar, senior to Eshani by three years, is taking it easy. Its good that so many people are getting to know me through TV, the student of Bidya Bharati Girls School reasons.

 While Pallavi was featured in the inaugural episode last Saturday, Eshanis turn comes on November 11, at 7.30 pm. Rob (a Pogo anchor) visited us and I drew a village scene for him. She swam in the river and sang in the garden too on camera. Pallavi took the team to Nehru Childrens Museum, where she trains, for the shoot. Acting is a tough business, is the young artists realisation after her stint on the small screen. 

 Both have won the coveted Balshree Award, the recognition for kids from the Government of India, other than sundry prizes elsewhere. But Pogo is where their eyes are fixed, for now.

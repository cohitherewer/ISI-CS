 Dedicated to the memory of legendary sculptor Ramkinkar Baij, Somnath Dutta and Swaraj Das (one of his paintings appears left) present an exhibition of paintings that portrays urban reality from the perspective of romantic idealism. Usually reflecting what is pleasant, lovable and quaint about contemporary city life, their canvases convey a latent desire to hold on to the past and all that it stood for. Images of flocks of birds flying across the city skyline, trams trundling slowly along their tracks and towering, majestic heritage buildings are set against an almost-audible clamour associated with the city?s commercial areas, echoing sentiments that convey a perceptible loss in terms of emotional wealth. In dark and muted shades, the paintings, besides expressing sadness at the passing away of what was once beautiful and glorious, also give an impression of the illusory and transient nature of life in general.

Event: An exhibition of paintings by Somnath Dutta and Swaraj Das 

When: Till today, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, Central Gallery

 What We are Watching

Dosar

The blissful marital world of Kaveri (Konkona Sen 

Sharma) is shattered by an accident that leaves husband Kaushik (Prosenjit) wounded 

and blows the cover off his weekend escapades with colleague Mita (Chandrayee 

Ghosh). Mita, married with a son, dies on the spot. What follows is the rebuilding 

of Kaveri?s broken home, bit by excruciating bit.

The basic plot is both powerful and intriguing ? the straying husband staying 

alive to face the world; the straying wife dead and leaving her bewildered husband 

to pick up the pieces. This allows director Rituparno Ghosh to explore shock, 

trauma, anger, embarrassment and reconciliation through the anti-thesis of the 

two worlds. While Konkona grapples to find a way to deal with a deceitful husband 

and restore their relationship, cheated husband Shankar Chakraborty displays an 

impotent rage in his failure to fight his dead unfaithful wife.

Though 

the film revolves around Konkona?s character, some vital gender issues have been 

woven in to reveal how much a man?s world it still is. Case in point: Prosenjit 

remains a favourite colleague whose dalliances are easily forgiven, while Chandrayee?s 

existence is given a quick and complete burial.

The 

sub-plot of Konkona?s friends Pallavi Chatterjee and Parambrata Chatterjee as 

another fugitive couple works well, with Pallavi being torn between her husband-home 

and her young lover.

Konkona 

comes into her own a little while into the film and then carries it on her shoulders. 

Prosenjit, as the silent sufferer, is retrained and poignant.

Black-and-white 

lends a novel and soothing dimension to a film dealing with basic emotions. Chandrayee?s 

rendering of a Rabindrasangeet deserves special mention.

The 

couple on an extended Raichak romp adds nothing to the film. The shot of Shankar 

atop the prostitute strikes a jarring note. Tota?s ?condom? conversation with 

Prosenjit is cliched and almost juvenile. The end seems too pat, leaving the viewer 

with a feeling that the film could have rolled some more.

 Wanted: A hot bod.

 Deadline: May 27. 

 Not exactly a very easy goal to achieve, especially when you have only started out on May 1. 

 But then again, whats life without a few challenges? Especially when your sights are set on the Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006 crown.

 The uphill trek that began for the 20 finalists soon after the preliminary round, with grooming expert Nayanika Chatterjee taking every measurement and ascertaining who needs to lose weight where, was never going to be smooth.

 With an eye on the glittering crowns, oodles of determination and the willpower to do all it takes, 20 girls set out with one mission.

 For a few fitness freaks ? like Madhabilata Mitra, who boasts a Method of Instruction diploma from Himalaya Mountaineering Institute, or Prachi Doshi, a state-level swimmer ? the grind was all fun.

 For most others it was more work than play. 

 But when the glorious goal is the same, differences such as these are bound to dissolve sooner rather than later.

 Fitness consultant Preetom Mukherjee-Roy has been specially tracking their daily progress at Solace, the spa and fitness centre in Sunny Park, where the girls were put through a circuit-training test.

 This test is a mix of aerobics, weight training, Swiss ball, free-hand exercises and some cardio kick-boxing to check their level of stamina, reveals Preetom.

 Based on the results, the contestants were split into three groups ? weight loss and inch loss, overall toning and muscle sculpting to add shape. The workout schedule was planned accordingly.

 Though cardio-vascular is a part of each girls routine, the duration depends on a specific case, says Preetom. 

 A considerable amount of resistance training and abdominal exercises have also been part of the agenda all along. 

 The girls have even been exposed to fun group-activities like aqua aerobics and more at Solace.

 But the clock is ticking fast and the coveted crowning moment will arrive in less than a week, at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers.

 So, in store are some last-minute modifications. Now that we are nearing D-day, we are focussing on their problem areas to achieve quicker results. This week we also have a power yoga session scheduled, signed off Preetom.

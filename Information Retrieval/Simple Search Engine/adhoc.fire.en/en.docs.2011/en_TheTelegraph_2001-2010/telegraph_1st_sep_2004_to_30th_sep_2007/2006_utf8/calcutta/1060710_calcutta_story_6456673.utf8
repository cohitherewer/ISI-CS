The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Second jackpot in two months

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 A 26-year-old man, who supplies cigarettes to Topsia shops, has become the second Calcuttan to hit the Sikkim Online Super Lotto jackpot.

 On May 26, Jai Prakash Jaiswal, a scrap iron trader in central Calcutta, had won the country?s biggest-ever jackpot of Rs 17,29,15,375.

 The man from Topsia, whose winning number was 48,44,42,19,03,11, has won Rs 2.12 crore. According to the Super Lotto sources, the winner bought the ticket on Saturday, just hours before the jackpot was declared at 10.30 pm.

 ?It?s a big surprise that two people from Calcutta have hit the jackpot within such a short span,? said Aniruddha Basu, eastern region head of Playwin.

 Ever since Jaiswal?s stroke of luck was reported in the media, the online lottery has registered a huge rise in ticket sales in Calcutta.

 ?The winner contacted us and confirmed that the number belongs to him. He is not from an affluent background and earns his living by supplying cigarettes to retail counters. He lives with his family in a dingy bylane in Topsia. He said he had purchased the ticket on Saturday. After hearing the news, he got scared and is not discussing the windfall with anyone,? Basu added.

 It?s a precedent set by Jaiswal. He had first sent a relative to the Playwin office and revealed his identity only after three days of hitting the jackpot. The same day, he left for Azamgarh, in Uttar Pradesh, to avoid the public attention he was getting.

 In this case, the winner is not the only one keeping mum. Super Service Agency, near Kohinoor Market, on Topsia Road, which had issued the ticket, is also not discussing the issue publicly.

 ?Super Service Agency opened only four months ago. Like the winner, the person who owns the agency is apprehending abduction. According to rules, the agency issuing the winning ticket will get one per cent of the jackpot amount,? explained Basu.

 The winner now has a period of ?90 days to validate his ticket?. He will have to meet the Super Lotto authorities and furnish identity details to claim the amount. 

 After he furnishes all the details and fills up the forms, he will receive a bank draft within ?45 working days?.

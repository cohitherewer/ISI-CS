 What: Andarer Ati Sajja, an interior workshop organised by Sananda in association with Cocoon.

 Where: At Cocoon, a lifestyle store at 28/2, Shakespeare Sarani, first floor. 

 When: Wednesday afternoon, between 2 pm and 4 pm. 

 The panellists: Fashion designer Sharbari Datta, interior designer Anindita Saha and Feng Shui expert Sweety Arora.

 The workshop: Touching upon various aspects of home and interior design, the panellists discussed everything from empowerment of women through beautification of their space to health improvement tips related to Feng Shui. 

 Apart from the aesthetic appeal, a beautiful home also provides for great atmosphere for growing children, said Sharbari. She also shared secrets on intelligent space designing and practical pointers. 

 Anindita shared her views on the technical aspect of interiors, explaining the importance of balancing economy, aesthetics and time. Today each square foot of space is vital and the thrust should be on its optimum utilisation, that too within a fixed budget, she said.

 Sweety on her part discussed the basics of Feng Shui and taught eager participants how to activate each direction according to its colours and elements. 

 South-west direction relates to the woman of the house and hence is often related to their health issues, revealed Sweety. 

 A Feng Shui quiz followed, with five prizes for correct answers. Feng Shui is practical and hence easy to follow, added Sweety.

 Voiceover: This workshop amalgamates aesthetics and well-being beautifully, said Ajay Rawla, proprietor of Cocoon.

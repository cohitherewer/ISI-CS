The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cookie major eyes chain of stores

 - indo-australian venture attracted by Strong market

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 The Cookie Man range

 Australian Foods (I) Private Limited, the manufacturers of Cookie Man cookies in India, will be setting up retail operations in Calcutta by the end of this year. The company, which is an Indo-Australian joint venture, plans on exploiting the upturn in the food and beverages sector in Bengal in a big way. 

 Pattabhi Rama Rao, president, Cookie Man India, told Metro said that Bengal will feature prominently in the company?s nationwide expansion plans. Calcutta will also be the gateway to the growing Northeast market. ?Calcutta is a very strong market for cookies and biscuits. With the state economy growing at a fast clip, we feel that the market size is quite big. The business scenario here has been a pleasant surprise,? stated Rao.

 Cookie Man, which currently operates 108 stores globally, has a single cookie kiosk at City Centre in Salt Lake, but will be opening stores in a number of malls coming up in the city. Rao feels that Calcutta?s potential for retail is yet to be explored. 

 ?Most food and beverages brands do not understand the potential of the city market. There are a number of industries driving growth in other sectors. Most importantly, consumers here are slowly moving from being simply price-conscious to being brand-conscious,? felt Rao.

 The company, which witnessed system-wide brand sales to the tune of Rs 25 crore in the last fiscal, plans to set up 75 franchise stores and 250 express counters by 2011. While growth is purely by the franchise mode, development in Calcutta is strictly restricted to opening up of malls here.

 ?Our business model has been to start our retail operations in malls only. But it is quite obvious that the mall culture has caught on quite well here. We do not have any plans of opening a standalone store outside the malls as of right now. What we ideally look at for our mother shops is a mall with at least 500,000 sq ft space,? explained Rao.

 Cookie Man has the largest product range in the world in its category and manufactures the second-largest number of fresh-baked cookies in the world. Rao plans to roll out marketing initiatives tailored for this part of the country. 

 ?Cookies are an impulse purchase product. Therefore, the branding has to be developed largely taking into account customer experience. We will have offerings for special occasions such as Durga puja and Diwali, which are the biggest festive occasions in Bengal. Therefore, the positioning of the product will be unique to Bengal,? emphasised Rao.

 Though not in the immediate future, Cookie Man might look at setting up a manufacturing facility in the state in the next two to three years. ?It depends completely on the growth figures in this part of the world. We will have to do a substantial market analysis here in order to do so,? signed off Rao.

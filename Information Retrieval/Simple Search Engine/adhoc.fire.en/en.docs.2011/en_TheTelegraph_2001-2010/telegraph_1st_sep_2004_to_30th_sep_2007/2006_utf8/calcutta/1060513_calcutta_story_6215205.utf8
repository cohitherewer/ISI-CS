 New, larger prayer hall 

 - TEMPLE WITH DONATIONS

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Universal Temple, now under construction

 The Ramakrishna Math in Barisha, on the southern fringes of the city, is building a temple where around 400 devotees can offer prayers at a time.

 To be called Universal Temple, it will host the birth anniversary celebrations of the founders of various religious orders. The temple is being set up at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore. 

 ?We have a prayer hall, but that is not spacious enough. Devotees were requesting us to build a larger hall. We collected some funds and then sought permission from Belur Math. Following the approval, work started on July 27, 2003,? said Swami Lokanathananda, president, Ramakrishna Math, Barisha. ?Work is progressing according to availability of funds, which we are collecting from devotees and well-wishers,? he added. 

 The temple will have a garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum), a prayer hall, a big shikhara (tower) over the garbha griha, 14 small shikharas, a pradakshin path (passageway around the sanctum sanctorum) and a bedi (elevated platform) where pictures of Sri Ramakrishna, the Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda will be installed.

 The birth anniversaries of Sri Ramakrishna, the Holy Mother, Swami Vivekananda, Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ, Shankaracharya, Guru Nanak and others will be observed in the temple. 

 The Barisha Ramakrishna Math was set up in the lap of nature, on three acres of land on Motilal Gupta Road in 1983. It has a home for the aged, where 40 inmates are now staying. The Math also runs a homoeopathic clinic, where around 8,000 patients receive free medicine and treatment. It distributes winter garments, clothes and teaching aids to the underprivileged.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tee-off tuning 

 for states techies 

 - Drive to woo IT employees away from nightclubs and to the golf greens

 Hitting perforated plastic balls off a synthetic mat against a curtain, with pillows providing the slope gradients, at a star hotel during presentation breaks, a sip and a bite to bolster the swing. Or lining up a putt at the office cafeteria and perfecting the V, as you wait for lunch to be served

 Mixing business with birdies has been the magic modern mantra, from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen. While a Microsoft, an IBM or a Dell are all promoting golf in some form or the other because every gizmo freak loves the thrill of hitting a ball 180 yards, Shenzhen alone has manicured 180 holes of designer golf to attract top-gun corporates.

 Now, Calcuttas burgeoning infotech (IT) industry, touted as the states engine of growth, is set to get a tee-off tuning. Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), which drives the Indian Golf Tour, is keen to steer city techies away from smoke-filled nightclubs and to the greens.

 In Calcutta, we have 36 holes of golf separated by a road, and we must encash on this. Along with the Royal (Calcutta Golf Club), we are working on a programme designed to woo the IT gang. If we can convince the management we are doing something for generic good, it will fly, Brandon D Souza, TSM president, tells Metro.

 Come to our 19th hole, is the golf-plus swing slogan, which is 18 international-standard holes of golf. We want the IT firms to come to the Royal, we want them to throw up a certain number of corporate members, we want them here early mornings or late afternoons, declares D Souza. 

 We are even planning to illuminate the driving range so that you can hit balls after dark, he adds. 

 Be it a TechnoPlus, a SkyTech or a Wipro, golf needs to be a part of what they use as stress-busters, instead of going straight from their desks to some strange bars in dim lighting, smoking and drinking, agrees Manmohan Singh, CEO of RCGC. This is the only place they can exercise their lungs after sitting 14 hours in front of the computer, he says.

 As a first step, TSM wants to caddy to the campus with an initiation kit. In Bangalore, the tour catalysts took golf to the office cafeteria of Accenture, putting up two driving nets and a putting course to introduce the tech team to the nuances of the game.

 We want to use this as a case study in Calcutta. As you get more stressed out, you need to be spoon-fed. Thats why we will take golf to the offices, with campus clinics on the basics of driving and putting in easy and fun formats intertwining management, strategy and teamwork with golf. Once we have done that, itll be easier to reverse the trend and bring them to the course, D Souza hopes.

 If the just-concluded Merchants Cup golf meet at RCGC was any indication, Sector V is warming up to the eagle overtures. Cognizant Technology Solutions was a new entrant and it has also lined up nine senior IT professionals for corporate membership.

 Its a great idea to marry IT with golf and use the game as a platform to draw business. China has done it by developing 100 golf courses, says Anish Roy Chaudhuri. 

 Anish, who works in the Salt Lake IT hub, has participated in Shenzhens iconic Golfathon, where you play five days of 36 holes each.

 RCGC is chipping in with its reinvention bit. Closest to the pin, an event which happens every Friday over barbecue and gives even a below-average golfer a chance to drive away with goodies like a home theatre system, is already a hit. As was glow-golf, introduced during the centenary celebrations.

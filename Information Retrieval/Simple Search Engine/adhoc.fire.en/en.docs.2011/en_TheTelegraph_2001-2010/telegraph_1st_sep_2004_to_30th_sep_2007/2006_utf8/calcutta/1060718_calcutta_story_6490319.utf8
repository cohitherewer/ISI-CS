 Nine-month-old Sreyasi Mondal, suffering from a respiratory disorder, was at play with a nurse at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children on Monday afternoon, unaware that she had lost her mother a few hours back.

 Lalita Mondal, 32, hanged herself with her sari in the room of one of the doctors. She had entered the second-floor room between 8.40 and 9 am, and locked herself in.

 Around 9.15 am, an employee spotted the body hanging from the ceiling. ?The employee was passing by when he saw the body through the glass on the door,? said a hospital official. As he raised an alarm, his colleagues came rushing and broke open the door.

 The body was later sent for post-mortem.

 Lalita was married to Amiya Mondal, of Hingalganj, in North 24-Parganas, six years ago. Last year, she gave birth to Sreyasi. The couple was facing severe financial difficulties ? neither Amiya nor Lalita had a job ? and was supported by family members.

 Sreyasi, suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome, has been under a prolonged treatment. Last week, her condition became serious and she was brought to BC Roy hospital, where she was admitted. Lalita had been staying with the baby. 

 ?The child?s lungs were almost choked,? said medical superintendent M.K. Chatterjee.

 As her condition improved, the authorities withdrew the drip and oxygen. ?We were planning to release her in a day or two,? Chatterjee said. But the mother feared that Sreyasi?s condition would turn worse again and rushed downstairs to her husband.

 ?She became paranoid and had an altercation with me,? said Amiya. ?I have no complaint against the doctors.?

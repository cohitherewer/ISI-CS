The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A pitch for 

 passion

 For local soccer, there can be no 

 better time to hit back than now. The important thing is how

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 IFA 

 has got a new president: Mr Aditya Kashyap. A distinguished 

 alumnus of IIM Calcutta, he has had a chequered managerial 

 career. During his association with the Tata group he was 

 the man behind Super Soccer. The new president wants to 

 re-launch Super Soccer. Our guests would be the Sao Paolo 

 Club. The event will probably generate a surplus for IFA. 

 That is smart thinking. For, funds would be critical in 

 pursuing any goal for IFA.

 The real challenge would, however, 

 be to define what should be the goal of IFA. For example, 

 a populist goal for IFA can be that in the next 10 years 

 Bengal must win the Santosh Trophy at least eight times. 

 Or it can also be that three of the four top teams in the 

 national league should be affiliate clubs of IFA, etc etc. 

 Such goals, many would argue, are incomplete challenges. 

 They will take care of the symptom, not the disease.

 The real issue for IFA is to market 

 football in Calcutta. Any discussion on this is usually 

 punctuated by ?those were the days? sighs. There are examples 

 aplenty: a Mohun Bagan versus East Bengal match those days 

 could fetch you a promotion if you offered it to your boss! 

 Did you know that less fortunate people stood on the rampart 

 of Fort William and watched matches by hiring periscopes?

 The important thing to remember 

 is that all this was before the era of television. That 

 was when out-of-home amusement options were limited and 

 being entertained within the confines of your residence 

 was a challenge. Football was one of the few convenient 

 and inexpensive options. On your way back from work, for 

 a buck or two, a couple of hours of uncomplicated fun. But 

 the hangover was more exciting than the drink. From the 

 ground, people carried back talking points. It helped them 

 to participate in intoxicating debates back in their paras. 

 It is the passion that carried the sport to its dizzy heights 

 of popularity.

 The scenario today, as we all 

 know, has changed dramatically. There is this issue of convenience. 

 Some people in their wisdom had decided to retain the ?once 

 in three years? cricket stadium at the centre of the town 

 and move the ?hundred days a year? sport to the wilderness 

 of Salt Lake. On television we now have EPL and Champions 

 League beckoning on multiple days of the week. The local 

 product is far weaker, so it is an unequal competition. 

 The advent of the Barettos has helped, but only marginally. 

 Going beyond is almost impossible. The sigma of all this 

 is straightforward ? local football as an entertainment 

 option is weak. It is important to value-add.

 That possibly is well understood. 

 What is not acknowledged is that product enrichment will 

 necessarily be a long-term process. Immediate intervention 

 is imperative. And the arena of such short-term value addition 

 will need to be off the football pitch. For that the dormant 

 passion for the sport needs to be re-ignited. The fierce 

 loyalties for the clubs may have waned, but the love for 

 the game is possibly still in tact, even in these days of 

 one-day cricket. Many say that the cricket graph may be 

 reaching a plateau. For soccer, there can be no better time 

 to hit back. In doing so it is important to remember, that 

 even in the golden days of football in this city people 

 consumed the passion a lot more than the sport itself.

 Remember the proverbial free bucket 

 that Surf offered many years back. It did not ensure cleaner 

 clothes. The bucket got used more often for non-washing 

 purposes. Yet people loved the bucket as it added value.

 Football in Calcutta needs to 

 find its free bucket. That Mr President is your challenge. 

 That Mr President is your opportunity to become our Kerry 

 Packer.

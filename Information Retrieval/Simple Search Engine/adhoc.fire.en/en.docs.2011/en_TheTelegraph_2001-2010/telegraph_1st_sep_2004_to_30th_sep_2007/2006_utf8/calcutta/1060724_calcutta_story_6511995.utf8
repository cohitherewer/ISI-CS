 A hilarious comedy, which nevertheless carries a positive message, Bojhapara is being staged as EZCC?s monthly theatre show. It highlights the need for cooperation and understanding in our personal and social lives. The characters of the play, Aghor, Sadhucharan, Bhola, Bhaja, Reba, Neera and Abhay, live within their own pre-determined limitations. Unpleasant conflicts and clashes inevitably result whenever they interact with one another, leading to noisy, cacophonous outbursts that generate unnecessary tension amongst them. Yet, if they had conducted themselves rationally and had shown a little patience and sensitivity, they could have lived in harmony. Direction: Dilip Basuthakur.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Bojhapara, produced by Eshona, Chinsurah 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB-201 Salt Lake

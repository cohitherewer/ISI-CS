 Mystery of a second hand

 Police probing the murder of four-year-old Subham Singh on Saturday believe that tutor Manoj Prasad had kidnapped the boy to make a fast buck, and killed him to remove any evidence that may go against him. 

 Manoj, who belongs to a decent family, wanted to collect Rs 5 lakh of the Rs 60 lakh he demanded by Saturday so that he could pocket the cash before the boys body was found, said H.P. Singh, deputy inspector-general (Presidency range). 

 But there is also the theory that Manoj acted at the behest of somebody yet to be identified. According to some senior officers of Behala police station, somebody else had lent Manoj a hand to dump the boys body into a thicket in the backyard of Manojs house. 

 We need to interrogate Manoj further to get the name of this man. Besides, we need to know where he has kept the bottle of chloroform used to make Subham unconscious, said an officer of Behala police station. 

 Manoj, on his part, has already named a few members of the family of Inder Deo Singh, including his sons, claiming that they had hired him to settle old family scores. Accordingly, police have picked up Inder Deo and his three sons, Umesh, Dinesh and Ramesh. 

 In March, the two families had come to blows over business matters. A case was also registered with Behala police. We now need to know if the killing has any link with that quarrel, as Manoj is claiming, said S.N. Gupta, police superintendent of South 24-Parganas. It could well be that Manoj is trying to mislead us.

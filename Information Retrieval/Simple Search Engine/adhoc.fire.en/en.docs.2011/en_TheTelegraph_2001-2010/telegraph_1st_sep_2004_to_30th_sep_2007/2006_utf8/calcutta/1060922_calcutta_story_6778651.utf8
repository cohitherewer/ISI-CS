 A glossy revolution

 A moment from Kranti: 

 Smart move 

 Riding high on smart packaging, 

 the makers of Kranti are hoping to bring about a 

 mini revolution in the Bengali film industry. Produced by 

 Shree Venkatesh, the film starring Jeet, Swastika Mukherjee 

 and Ashish Vidyarthi releases on Saptami.

 The storyline is inspired by Ram 

 Gopal Varmas Shiva (the original, starring Nagarjuna) 

 and so is the treatment, claims debutant director Riingo. 

 Kranti, like Shiva, is set in a college where 

 the simmering Jeet erupts one day and takes a stand against 

 dadagiri.

 The villain, too, is not what 

 Bengali potboilers are used to. My villain played by Ashish 

 Vidyarthi is rather a negative character. He cries too, 

 says Riingo, who has cast several unknown faces alongside 

 TV actors Rishi Kaushik, Biswanath, Lama and Piloo. Silence 

 plays a very important role in the film, adds Riingo, making 

 a switch from ad films to feature.

 A distinct departure from the 

 run-of-the-mill potboilers is the soundtrack. The makers 

 have gone for an album with Som, Samidh and Rishi, band 

 members of Hip Pocket, for the Kranti anthem. Pratul 

 Mukhopadhyays Ami Banglay gaan gai has been sung 

 by Anindya, a former member of Paras Pathar, while Babul 

 Supriyo and Shreya Ghosal have lent their voices to a song 

 shot in Arunachal Pradeshs Tawang. The college sequences 

 were shot at SRFTI.

 I want to catch the audience 

 between Rituparno Ghosh and Haranath Chakraborty, and thats 

 a huge chunk, says Riingo.

 Puja pick

 The Stars, Superstars amp; Megastars 

 contest is back on STAR Ananda this Puja. While independent 

 family pujas are clubbed under the Star category, mega community 

 pujas will comprise the Superstar and Megastar sections. 

 Three pujas from each category will bag the awards.

 With the emphasis on viewer integration, 

 Apnar Chokhey was launched in early August inviting 

 viewers to vote their favourite jury members for the contest. 

 The jury of 20 will be picked on that basis.

 The list of pujas will be declared 

 on Mahalaya and then the jury members will begin their visits 

 escorted by the Sharad Utsab Canter from Panchami to Saptami.

 All final-round pujas will be 

 shown on Star Ananda and viewer ratings invited via SMS. 

 On Ashtami, the three winners will be announced on the basis 

 of jury votes and viewer scores.

 Plex B'day

 INOX Forum, the citys first multiplex, 

 turns three on September 26. The Bday countdown begins 

 on September 22 with a host of events. Friday is dedicated 

 to senior cine-goers where five couples will win movie tickets 

 for 12 weeks. Saturday invites youths to the INOX-Red FM 

 RJ Hunt where the winner will get to be an RJ on Red FM. 

 A fancy filmi dress competition 

 is lined up on Sunday, for five to 10-year-olds. Entry forms 

 for both contests are available at the ticket counters of 

 INOX (Forum and City Centre). Monday is for women, where 

 beauty expert Bridgette Jones will share makeup and beauty 

 tips.

 On Tuesday, September 26, underprivileged 

 children from Action Aid Society will be treated to a film 

 show. The cast of Khosla Ka Ghosla, starring Anupam 

 Kher, Boman Irani and Parvin Dabas, are also scheduled to 

 make a special birthday appearance.

 College in last lap of autonomy quest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 St Xavier?s College has entered the last lap of its quest for autonomy, as a University Grants Commission (UGC) team expressed ?happiness? over the functioning of the institution, following a day-long inspection on Tuesday.

 ?We are happy with the performance of the college. Our observations will be reflected in the report we are going to submit in a week,? said a team member.

 The four-member panel ? comprising Ramamurthy Naidu, T. Balakrishnan, Sashi Rai and A.K. Dogra ? inspected all the departments, assessed the infrastructure and interacted with students, teachers and other employees.

 ?The entire process of making the final announcement (of granting autonomy) should not take more than a month,? said a UGC official.

 Reacting to the favourable opinion of the panel, principal Father P.C. Mathew said: ?We are happy the team has expressed satisfaction with the performance of our institution.?

 Calcutta University, to which the college is affiliated, and the state higher education department had held a series of inspections at the college after the government decided that at least one undergraduate institution would be allowed to seek autonomy.

 The other institution shortlisted by the government for the status is Presidency College. 

 Autonomy will bring in a one-time UGC grant of Rs 1 crore to the college, which will also have a free hand in structuring its fees and raising funds through other means to meet its requirements. 

 And all this, plus the financial help the college now gets from the state government.

 The new status will also empower the institution to frame syllabi, hold examinations and award degrees. The certificates, though, will have a mention of Calcutta University. The college will also be able to recruit teachers.

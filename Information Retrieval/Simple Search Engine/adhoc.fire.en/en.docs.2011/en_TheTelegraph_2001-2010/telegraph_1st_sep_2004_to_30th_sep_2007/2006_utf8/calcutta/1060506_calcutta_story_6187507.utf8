 Guardians protested an ?abnormal? hike in tuition fees and also alleged that students were being overcharged for their textbooks, disrupting activities in two English-medium schools in Calcutta and Howrah on Friday.

 There was tension in the Lord Sinha Road area in the morning as a few hundred guardians demonstrated in front of Shri Shikshayatan school, demanding that the management withdraw its decision and ensure downward revision of the fees. The principal, however, claimed classes were held as usual.

 Shri Shikshayatan guardians charged that the school authorities had announced a 73 per cent hike in the annual tuition fees of students both in the primary and secondary sections. They claimed that despite the fee hike, the management was doing hardly anything about improving the facilities and teaching standards.

 The rally led to a severe traffic jam in the area from 9.30 am. Police intervened to restore the flow of vehicles.

 ?They have increased the quarterly fees from Rs 3,490 to Rs 8,500 at one go,? said Pradip Mondal, secretary of the school?s guardian?s forum. ?Guardians will have to pay a fine of Rs 200 to Rs 600 for late payment. Till last year, a fine of Rs 10 was charged,? he said. 

 What annoyed the parents even more was a hike in the session fees, from Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 a year.

 More than 100 guardians staged a prolonged rally in front of Shree Jain Vidyalaya in Howrah. They were protesting the authorities? decision to make it mandatory for students to buy books from the school store at ?abnormally high rates.?

 Olga Ghosh, school principal, however, denied the guardians? allegation. She countered by claiming that a large number of agitators had ransacked the school.

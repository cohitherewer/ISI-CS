Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 According to Feng Shui, it is best to 

 place photographs of sunrise in the east since the sun 

 rises from this direction. It is not advisable to have 

 photographs of sunset in the immediate environment because 

 it shows the end of the day. Photographs of beaches 

 should be displayed on the north wall since this direction 

 represents career

Q: 

 Photography has been my passion since 

 childhood. Now having obtained a degree in this field, I 

 am keen on opening a studio to display my work. I have a 

 collection of photographs boasting different themes like 

 sunrise, sunset, mountain peaks, temples, flying birds, 

 sea beaches and celebrities. Please guide me as to how these 

 photographs should be placed in different directions to 

 my advantage as per Feng Shui rules.

 Samir

 THE SOLUTION: 

 Some special scenes that you have captured in the walk of 

 life definitely need to be displayed in a special way in 

 your dream studio. The sun rises from the east and it is 

 best to place photographs of sunrise in this direction. 

 It is not advisable to have photographs 

 of sunset in the immediate environment because it shows 

 the end of the day. Such pictures create a gloomy atmosphere. 

 Pictures of mountain peaks placed in the south-west are said to give tremendous stability and support in life. Photographs of temples in the north-east are best to receive divine blessings.

 Soaring flying birds are best displayed on the southern wall to provide you with unlimited success in your profession. This wall is also suitable for photographs of celebrities. 

 The northern wall that is associated 

 with your career can be activated by displaying photographs 

 of sea beaches.

 Metal money 

 Q: 

 My date of birth is 02.01.1960 

 at 3.10 am. I have a trading business of bolts and nuts 

 made from iron and steel. Ive been into this for the 

 past 25 years and have really worked very hard, but havent 

 got the deserved results yet. I also traded in the stock 

 market, but that also didnt work out. Recently, I 

 have started trading in the commodity sector, working mainly 

 in silver. The results so far have been quite satisfying. 

 I also wish to trade in gold. Please suggest ways to improve 

 my financial position.

 Name and address withheld

 THE SOLUTION: 

 According to your pillars of destiny, you are a strong earth 

 person and the metal element represents your creativity. 

 This means that you will be successful in business that 

 is related with any kind of metal, whether it is silver 

 or gold.

 Fire element goes against you, 

 which represents the stock market. So I would suggest that 

 you stick to metal-related business and do not invest in 

 shares at all. 

 This is the right time to expand your business as you are under the influence of your favourable metal element for next seven years.

 Surround yourself with white, grey, blue and metallic shades. 

 North-east is your auspicious 

 direction, which will help you to go forward in life. So 

 always face this direction while sitting in the office. 

 Step by step

 Q: 

 I am building a house with a basement 

 in Delhi. I am planning to create a family area in the basement 

 where it can be personalised with lots of family photographs. 

 I would need your guidance about the location of the basement. 

 Should the number of steps leading to the basement be taken 

 into consideration?

 Manas Arora

 THE SOLUTION: 

 Basements should either run underneath all through the constructed 

 building or only in the north and east. These should never 

 be built in the south, west or south-west. 

 As for displaying photographs 

 in the basement, it is not considered fortunate to have 

 family photographs in the dead basement that is totally 

 devoid of sunlight. But if one-fourth of the basement is 

 above the ground level, allowing the sunrays to enter, then 

 you can comfortably display them. 

 Otherwise, these are best displayed in lively areas like bedrooms or personal lobbies. Care should be taken that they are not hung along the staircase wall or under the stairs, and do not see the main door at the same time. Wrong placement of photographs could be detrimental to the health of the people in the photograph. 

 The total number of stairs leading to the basement should never end in a zero. Odd numbers are considered auspicious, where only the risers are counted.

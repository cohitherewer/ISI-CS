 Debris of the Bush brigade

 George W. Bush is back in Washington after his trip to India. Though the American president didn?t touch down at Calcutta, his presence looms large here, there and everywhere on the Maidan.

 Four days after the Left Front held a rally protesting Bush?s visit, plastic carry bags and cups, paper food packets and remnants of burnt effigies continue to litter one of the last green spots in town.

 And no one seems willing to take the responsibility for the Maidan mess clean-up. 

 Public works department (PWD) minister Amar Chowdhury said on Monday that he was unaware about the sorry state of the post-rally greens. 

 ?I will will have to find out what the status is. Usually, the organisers clean up after the programme. In this case, I?m sure they didn?t seek permission for using the Maidan in the first place,? Chowdhury said.

 He added that he would ?look into the matter?. The question remains when.

 Soon after the Maidan maul, its custodians ? the army ? had said they would ask the organisers to clean up. Fort William officials said on Monday that they had tried to take up the matter with the organisers but received no reply. The army will now approach the PWD for the job.

 Last Thursday?s rally had not caused much of a traffic disruption with its modest turnout, but it did manage to turn the Maidan into a garbage dump. The protesters had parked buses, Matadors and cars on the green, trampled on the freshly-sown grass, relieved themselves in public and strewn leftovers all over.

 The Maidan?s scars, post- Book Fair, had only just started to heal, when the anti-Bush brigade descended on it.

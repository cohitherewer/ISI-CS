 Schools as shelters

 Most school campuses in the city 

 wear a deserted look after school hours. But the premises 

 of a few Loreto schools double as schools by day and homes 

 at night. After classes get over, Loreto Bowbazar, Loreto 

 House Middleton Row and Loreto Day Sealdah provide shelter 

 to around 140, 100 and 300 girl children respectively, who 

 are vulnerable to abuse on the streets.

 On August 11 and 12, a seminar on this project, also known as Rainbow Home, was held at Loreto Day Sealdah. It was attended by over 80 principals from schools across India. The programme was inaugurated by Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, who spoke of the domestic violence that these girls often face before being turned out on to the streets. He emphasised the need of this kind of space management in a country like India. After all, what better way to use big schools which are empty and unused for 16 hours every day?

 The Loreto Rainbow Home programme was the model based on which the central government issued directives to big schools in New Delhi to ensure that underprivileged children from the area constituted 20 per cent of the students in each class.

 The Catholic bishops have also issued a statement to educational institutions under them to ensure special concern for the marginalised, especially the girl child. Modification in the admission policy is also being considered, the aim being to help the disadvantaged and the socially, physically or mentally challenged. We make this a preferential option, even if academic results suffer in the process, the directive said. Recently, Loreto Dharamtala also opened its doors for girls who lived on the streets at night.

 The entire project is funded by the Partnership Foundation of Holland.

 Pillars of knowledge

 Mrinalini Datta Mahavidyapith recently wore a festive look to commemorate the inauguration of its newly-constructed buildings, housing a few departments, a library and the womens hostel, by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The programme started with a tribute of songs to Tagore. 

 On the occasion, the colleges journals and magazines of the year were also launched by Bhattacharjee. In his address, the chief minister forwarded his vision to make West Bengal a welfare state by achieving 100 per cent literacy and introducing land reforms. 

 For the purpose, he announced that 30 new colleges, offering courses in the science, commerce and humanities streams, will be started within 2006-07. The special emphasis will be on science and technology. 

 It is interesting to see that Mrinalini Datta College also offers new-age subjects like journalism and mass communication, advertising, sales promotion and sales management, along with arts, literature and commerce courses, the chief minister said. A dance performance concluded the function.

 Talking point

 The first elimination round of an intra-college freshers debate was held in Presidency College recently. Although the debators could speak on any topic of their choice, their favourite was Censorship should be censored. The participants raised questions like why should the state, the censor board or religious bodies decide what is immoral or offensive.

 While some speakers stressed the need for censorship as a tool to monitor what we expose ourselves to, others saw it as an infringement on peoples freedom of speech and expression. It reflected a society not tolerant to different views, they said.

 Thought-provoking issues were covered in topics like Education as a system breeds mediocrity and Commercialisation is a bane (or a boon). Debak Das, a first-year student of the history department, earned brownie points for his strong arguments. A total of 10 speakers will clash in the finals.

 2D or not 2D

 Having promised earlier to write about Flatland, I suppose I must do so, though the prospect both depresses and scares me. In many ways, Edwin A Abbotts Flatland: A Romance in Two Dimensions is one of the most disturbing virtual worlds ever created. Published in 1884, this novel describes the excursions of its protagonist, A. Square, in a world that has only two dimensions-in other words, is literally flat.

 How scary is that? I stare at the white of the computer screen in front of me and wonder how it would be to be suddenly translated inside the screen, a squiggle only able to move sideways in space. The prospect is scary precisely because I have experience of a third dimension. That, however, is not the case with the protagonist, whose name A. Square describes exactly what he is, a right-angled quadrilateral with equal sides.

 He? Do quadrilaterals have genders? In Abbotts world, they do. Reflecting the rigid patriarchal codes of Victorian society, women in Flatland are represented as straight lines, while men are polygons whose class and status are directly proportional to the number of sides they have. The triangles inhabit the lower rungs of hierarchy while priests are multisided polygons whose shapes approximate a circle, which is considered to be the most desirable shape. Since women are needle-shaped and liable to puncture and damage male polygons they are required to wiggle their posteriors so as to be visible to all males in the vicinity.

 Not content with describing the horrors of a 2-D world, Abbott takes A. Square to Lineland, where he attempts to convince its monarch of the existence of a second dimension. He also has a dream of Pointland, comprising a self-aware point that occupies all space and knows nothing but itself. But A. Squares complacent world-view is shattered when a three-dimensional sphere rolls into his tabletop world.

 Abbotts whimsical novel is largely forgotten today, though mathematicians and computer experts have suggested that it anticipates aspects of Einsteinian relativity and notions of hyperspace. There have been sci-fi take-offs as well, most notably AK Dewdneys Planiverse, in which a computer simulation of a 2-D world accidentally reveals the existence of a real 2-D planet called Arde.

 Towards the end of Flatland, A. Square muses on the possibility of the forbidden fourth dimension, and even tries to convince the President of Flatland about the existence of dimensions higher than two. Not surprisingly, he is sentenced to perpetual imprisonment, a fate not uncommon among visionaries in the three-dimensional world called Earth.

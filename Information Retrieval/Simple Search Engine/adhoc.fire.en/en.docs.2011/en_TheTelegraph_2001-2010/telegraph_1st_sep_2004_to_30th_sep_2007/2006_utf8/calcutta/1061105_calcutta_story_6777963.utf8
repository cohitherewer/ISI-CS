The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Walk in the clouds

 Hope, impulse and motivation make up the inspiring tale of two young girls entwined in the corporate web of their new-age jobs.

 Written by Shekhar Das and directed by Aniruddha Dhar, Meghbalika (picture by Pabitra Das) is a take on the plight of aspiring young girls from middle-class families opting for new-age career choices like being an airhostess or a TV news journalist.

 The writer zooms in on the aviation industry and news channels as glamorous platforms for the youth. The story is woven around the character of Shalmoli, an airhostess played by model Bindu, and a television reporter played by Aparajita Ghosh Das who meet under unusual circumstances and become best friends. They share common problems in both their personal and professional lives. I play a docile character who eventually goes against her family to pursue her dream career, explains Bindu.

 The face of Chandrani Pearls, Khadim Khazana and Sriniketan campaigns, and a regular GoodLife model, the serial marks Bindus debut as an actress. Ive had no experience in acting, but for two weeks I underwent an extensive workshop with Shekharda (Das) who taught me the nuances and gave me an insight into the character, says Bindu, who loves watching Bengali films.

 Bindu apart, a host of fresh faces from the modelling circuit including Imran, Ranjaboti, Tanushree, Sudeshna, Shubham and Abhishek will comprise the cabin crew. I wanted some new faces for this serial who would fit the look of an airhostess or a pilot. Those into modelling seemed to fit the bill and they were made to attend a crash course in acting under Shekhar Das, explains Dhar.

 After filming in-flight sequences in an aircraft setting at Ramoji Rao Film City in Hyderabad, Dhar and team are back in Calcutta, shooting at Technicians Studio, Princeton Club, Pailan School and the airport. We are currently focussing on domestic airlines and intend to shoot further in Delhi and Mumbai. If the serial clicks, we might take it to Hong Kong and Bangkok, states the director.

 The serial stars Chaiti Ghoshal in the role of a zonal head of an aviation company, apart from Alokananda, Rupanjana and Badshah (who plays Bindus conservative brother). Made for ETV Bangla, Meghbalika will go on air from November 13.

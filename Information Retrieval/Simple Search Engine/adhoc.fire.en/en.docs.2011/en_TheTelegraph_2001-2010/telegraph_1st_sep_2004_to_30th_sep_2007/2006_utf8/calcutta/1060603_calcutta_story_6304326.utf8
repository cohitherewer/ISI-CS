The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Results, for better or worse 

Students foxed by timing bungle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thousands of examinees went through a harrowing experience on Friday morning as a section of schools managed to collect their marksheets from the Madhyamik boards regional offices in advance and started distributing them to students nearly three hours before the official announcement of the results.

 The authorities of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had said the results would be announced at 10 am and the schools would distribute marksheets only after that. But many schools started distributing the marksheets from 6.30 am.

 There was confusion among students, as a large number of schools, abiding by the boards order, distributed the marksheets after 10 am.

 The students confusion soared as a number of television channels, too, announced the results much before the official announcement. The channels were even announcing the names of the toppers from early in the morning.

 We must find out how the schools could get marksheets in advance and under whose instruction they distributed them before the results were announced officially, said Gopa Basu, deputy secretary (examinations) of the board. 

 An inquiry, she added, will be ordered at the earliest.

 Students who could not get their marksheets before 10 am tried to log on to the boards websites for the results.

 But it was a futile exercise, as the results were not posted on any of the sites. The pages on the sites opened only after 10.30 am, said Suchitra Porel, a student of a school in Shyambazar.

 A large number of students called The Telegraph helplines to know the results. But conforming to the boards guidelines, those running the helplines answered the calls after 10 am.

 Sources in the board said only a few schools in the remote areas were allowed to distribute the marksheets before the official announcement.

 The relaxation was given only to schools in the remote areas. There was no such order for the rest, said an official. 

 Todays incident was an example of the lack of coordination among officials, said Ratan Laskar, general secretary of the Secondary Teachers and Employees Association.

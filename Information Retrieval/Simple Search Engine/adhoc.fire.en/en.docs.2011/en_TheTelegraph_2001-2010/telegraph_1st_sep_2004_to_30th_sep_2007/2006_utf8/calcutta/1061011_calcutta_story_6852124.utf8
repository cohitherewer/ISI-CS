The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 At Delhi door for light rail bail-out

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 PROJECT 

 REPORT 

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is knocking on the Centres doors for funds to be handed over to the private partner as viability gap finance that will implement the Rs 2,400-crore Light Rail Transit (LRT) project in the city.

 The government wants the project to be executed by a private partner on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. 

 Two companies Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (R-ADAG) and infrastructure finance firm SREI have expressed interest in the project and are agreeable to the BOT condition, but they want a part of the cost, in cash or kind (read land), from the state to make up for the viability gap.

 Officials said the companies want at least Rs 1,000 crore or land of equal worth in the vicinity of the city, which they will develop to raise money. 

 The government is not in a position to shell out the amount, nor does it want to be dragged into another land procurement controversy, with the Singur heat yet to die down.

 We are lobbying with Delhi for the money, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb told Metro on Tuesday. The Centre has a scheme called Viability Gap Finance, from which funds are released for implementing major urban transport infrastructure projects that takes a long time after commissioning to yield profit. We have sought funds under the scheme to implement the LRT project.

 Deb made it clear that whichever company takes up the project, it has to bear the entire cost of execution and operation. 

 But we do feel that it is impossible to raise the huge investment from ticket sales (minimum price Rs 4 to Rs 5) and by letting out advertisement space. Moreover, a major transport infrastructure project like LRT or Metro Railway has a long gestation period. So, if some financial support is not provided to the private partner, nobody will be willing to implement the project, he explained.

 Officials at Writers Buildings said while sending its proposal to the government, R-ADAG had clearly raised the issue of viability gap finance. SREI, too, had raised the mater indirectly.

 Whatever we get from the Centre, we will provide it to the private company which will be selected for the project. A clear picture is likely to emerge soon, the chief secretary said.

 Officials said the government is expecting at least Rs 500 crore from the Centre and is ready to pump in another Rs 500 crore.

 Anil Ambani and his senior officials are expected to visit the city soon and we will have a detailed discussion on the issue, Deb said.

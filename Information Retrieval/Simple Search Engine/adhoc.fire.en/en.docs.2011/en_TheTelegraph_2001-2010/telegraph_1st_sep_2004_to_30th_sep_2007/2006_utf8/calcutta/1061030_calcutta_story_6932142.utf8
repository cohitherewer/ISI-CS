 After Don 1978 comes Don 2006. After a shrine for Amitabh Bachchan comes a museum for Shah Rukh Khan.

 After ushering in Farhan Akhtars Don by smashing coconuts and dancing in the streets on Friday the 20th, the Shah Rukh Khan Fan Club is now set to unveil the heros archive on November 2, his birthday.

 SRK: The God In Many Moods will be housed in one of the three rooms of the fan clubs Bangur Avenue flat.

 We had felicitated Shah Rukh Khan with a life-sized statue and a golden crown when he had come to perform at Netaji Indoor stadium We have contacted SRK and have reason to believe that he will formally inaugurate the archive when he comes to Calcutta some time in January-February next year, declares Arnab Roy, secretary of the fan club that was formed in 1997 and now has more than 150 city members.

 What will the SRK archive have? A 5-ft-10-inch statue of the star made of bronze, documentary films on SRK by Nasreen Munni Kabir and recently-released copies of SRKs biography by Mushtaq Sheikh, called Still Reading Khan, apart from T-shirts, caps and wall-to-wall posters for sale.

 Props like the jacket and sunglasses SRK wore in Don should reach us by mid-November, hopes Roy.

 For the moment, though, Don dominates the lives of the fan club members, some having already watched the movie six times.

 Their latest slogan in Donspeak: It is not only mushkil (difficult) but namumkin (impossible) for anyone else to take SRKs place!

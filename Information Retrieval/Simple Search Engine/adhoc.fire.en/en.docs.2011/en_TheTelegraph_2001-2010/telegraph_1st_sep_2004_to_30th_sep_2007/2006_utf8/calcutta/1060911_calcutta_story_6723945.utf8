Life

 He who has 

 the gift of the gob

 Chandrima S. 

 Bhattacharya finds out the hard way why our vocabulary 

 can never be rid of the strange phrase committing nuisance

 SEX 

 amp; THE CITY

 Men and women do it differently 

 when it comes to getting rid of garbage. Women tend to package 

 it. My mother collects the garbage very neatly from the 

 kitchen and toilet bins in plastic bags and usually dumps 

 them without a murmur into the jamadars bin 

 when he comes calling every morning. 

 But on certain days, I know that 

 she has this mad urge to toss the garbage bags into the 

 middle of the street from our verandah in one deft motion. 

 She does it, too. Thats why I so often get hit on 

 my way to work by plastic bags from other verandahs of a 

 variety of micron counts containing stuff I dont want 

 to know. The sins of parents always descend on their children.

 But when it comes to men and dirt, 

 its a different story altogether. They are mainly 

 bothered with their own waste and when they get rid of 

 it, its sheer and straight-from-the-heart. Its 

 like triumphant self-expression. 

 One way of doing it is spitting. 

 Indian men, with their expertise and variety, have developed 

 it into high art. I get demos of several kinds of spitting 

 every day.

 It is difficult for a woman to 

 travel in an auto sandwiched between two men. 

 But I cant make up my mind which is worse to live 

 in the fear that the elbow belonging to the man on the right 

 may soon be grazing my midriff, or the apprehension that 

 he may start on the throat job any moment. 

 Then it starts. The man on the 

 right shifts a little, becomes still and stares ahead. Then 

 theres the sound of a small engine starting. The man 

 is working his phlegm. He has summoned up all he had in 

 his deeply congested chest and before you know, its 

 squirting out in a jet of red liquid from his mouth. It 

 spray-paints the street and the right sleeve of the auto-rickshaw 

 and fills the air with the smell of paan masala. 

 I am dead.

 The man on the left is turned 

 on by now. Its raining and I know he is looking for 

 the right puddle. Men like to spit on puddles they like 

 to make a little splash. He chooses the puddle, and a soft 

 ball pounces out of his throat and describing a perfect 

 arc, lands on the water. Plop. Its called the gift 

 of the gob. My only consolation is that he doesnt 

 know the Yiddish proverb that says Dont spit 

 into the well you might drink from it later.

 You think I am being sick? Well, 

 I go through it every day.

 There are explanations. One of 

 my friends used to tell me that some men think its 

 a mating call. She was bewildered by a man greeting her 

 with the throaty exercise every day outside her house, till 

 she realised that he fancied her.

 In the film Share Chuattor, 

 too, the oldest member of the mess, who was officially so 

 morally disapproving of women, would blow his nose with 

 a passion to draw the attention of a nubile Suchitra Sen.

 As my auto passes Keshub Chandra 

 Sen Street every day, two men come out of a pice hotel, 

 look straight at me, and blow their nose. You think thats 

 a coincidence? I think they fancy me.

 I have concluded, therefore, while 

 women are embarrassed, which leads them to plastic bags, 

 men love their emissions so much that they dont consider 

 it waste at all. Rather, they think them to be their gift 

 to the world.

 l this has taken a toll on my 

 bearing. I dont want to come between a man and his 

 happiness so I step very gingerly. Whenever I see a male 

 neck readjusting itself it may belong to the man in the 

 other auto, or the street vendor whose stall I am passing, 

 or simply the man approaching me, I squeeze myself back 

 into the seat, retreat or take a little leap, depending 

 on the circumstances. The police will stop me one day.

 But the greatest problem occurs 

 when I, from the vantage point of my first-floor verandah, 

 see men relieving themselves on our boundary 

 wall. I cant even stop them for fear of what I will 

 see. So they go on decorating the wall. That is why unlike 

 other countries, we can never rid our vocabulary of the 

 strange phrase committing nuisance.

 Thats why for their next 

 garbage drive, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation is being 

 advised to include a clause encouraging more women to go 

 to work, so that the men can stay at home and look after 

 their children and the trash bin.

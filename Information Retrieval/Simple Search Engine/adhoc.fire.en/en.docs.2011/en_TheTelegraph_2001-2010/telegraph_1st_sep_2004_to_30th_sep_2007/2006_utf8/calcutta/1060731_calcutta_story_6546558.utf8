 German tie-up to lower roads

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Laying and relaying of roads with bitumen for over half a century has raised their levels, leading to the flooding of the ground floors of houses in many areas, according to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) experts.

 The civic body has estimated that about Rs 200 crore will be needed to lower the roads to their original levels. Approximately eight inches will have to be ?shaved? off the topcoats of the roads with milling machines for the purpose.

 The civic body is in the process of tying up with a German firm for the job.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has directed the municipal commissioner to allot funds to start a pilot project before Puja 2006. Uday Shankar Sarani in south Calcutta and Northern Avenue in north Calcutta have been selected for the pilot project, that will cost about Rs 2 crore. 

 About 1,000 km of roads in Calcutta are now at least a foot higher than their original level and they need to be ?shaved? with the milling machines, the civic experts have concluded. 

 ?Since the job involves a huge expenditure, we have decided to carry it out in a phased manner. We already have one imported milling machine. We are also in the process of working out an agreement with a German firm,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 The milling machine was bought by the previous Left Front civic board in 1999. It was not used by the Trinamul Congress-led board in between. 

 The practice of laying coat after coat of bitumen on roads without scraping off the top layer of the earlier coats has led to roads becoming higher than the pavements on Brabourne Road, Lenin Sarani, Northern Avenue, Convent Road, Bertram Street, Raja Dinendra Street, Bagbazar Street, Uday Shankar Sarani, Jodhpur Park and Prince Anwar Shah Road. 

 ?The surface of some roads have, thus, become higher than the ground floors of buildings. Hence, during heavy showers, the ground floors are flooded,? explained a CMC official. 

 Chief engineer (civil) of the CMC Nilangshu Bose said German firm Writzen, which has manufactured the milling machine procured by the CMC, is likely to carry out the project. The company will charge about Rs 85 per sq m.

 A milling machine costs over Rs 1 crore. It can shave off 10 inches of the topcoat of 1,500 sq m of road in around 16 hours, said deputy engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharya.

 The shaved-off topcoat will be reused during the laying of roads in future.

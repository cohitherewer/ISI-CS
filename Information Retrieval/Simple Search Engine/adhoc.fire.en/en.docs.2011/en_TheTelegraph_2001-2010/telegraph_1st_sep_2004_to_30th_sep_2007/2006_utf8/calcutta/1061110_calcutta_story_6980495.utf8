 Guess game over results

 - Part II round the corner, Part I marks yet to be announced

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The undergraduate Part II examinations of Calcutta University are barely five months away, but the students are still in the dark about their Part I results.

 To add to the confusion, the university authorities have admitted that they are unsure when they will be able to declare the results, which are usually out by September.

 Controller of examinations Onkar Sadhan Adhikari said on Thursday it will take the authorities till the end of next week to set an estimated date for the publication of the results of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I exams.

 We are facing a crisis we have never faced before. We can understand the students problem, but we are helpless, admitted pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das.

 The university has blamed the delay on the five-phase Assembly polls held in April-May and also the early Pujas.

 We were forced to defer the undergraduate Part II exams 2006, as many of the dates clashed with the elections. A chain effect saw the Part I tests, too, being postponed, said Adhikari.

 And because of the late-September Durga puja, most teachers were unavailable for evaluation of the scripts at a crucial juncture.

 Around eight lakh answer scripts need to be examined this year for Part I alone. Its a mammoth task and we are finding it difficult getting examiners to evaluate the scripts on time, said an official.

 The Part I examinations started in August and dragged on till October. Originally, they were to be held from June to August.

 Controller of examinations Adhikari said the authorities are trying their best to announce the results of one set of the Part I tests held under the previous 2+1 scheme by the end of this month. But he could not hazard a guess about the declaration of the results under the 1+1+1 scheme.

 A university official said: We were aware that such a crisis would unfold when we postponed the examinations and had requested the Election Commission to shift the poll dates. But our plea was turned down.

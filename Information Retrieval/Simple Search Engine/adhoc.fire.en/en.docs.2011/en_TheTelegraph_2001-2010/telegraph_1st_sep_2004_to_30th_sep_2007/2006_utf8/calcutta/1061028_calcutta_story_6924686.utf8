 To spread awareness about drowning and lifesaving techniques on the sea beaches through the vehicle of sports, the Indian Life Saving Society (ILSS), and the Rashtriya Life Saving Society (RLSS) are jointly organising Rescue India 2006, a national lifesaving sports meet, in Digha on October 30 and 31. 

 The meet is being conducted in three phases. In the first phase, a two-day workshop was organised on October 25 and 26, where trained lifeguards from across the country took part. The workshop was conducted by Rozylynn Grey and Rebecca Crack of Royal Life Saving Society Commonwealth, Australia.

 This will be followed by pool events at Jadavpur Stadium Swimming Pool Complex on October 28 and 29.

 Previously, surf lifesaving events had been organised only in controlled environments like pools or lakes. This is for the first time that the meet is being held on the beach.

 In India, the concept of lifesaving is evolving. Its been in practice in Australia since the late 18th Century, where it is a part of our life. The participants here will benefit from the development in this field in the past 150 years, explained Grey.

 Delegates from the Bangladesh Swimming Federation are also attending the meet. We hope to make recommendations for starting a similar system in our country. The lifesaving facilities in Bangladesh are less than nothing, stated coach Golam Mostafa. 

 This will be the preliminary stage of a programme for setting up a permanent lifeguard training centre at Digha. The ILSS will table a formal proposal in this regard to Digha Development Authority after the meet.

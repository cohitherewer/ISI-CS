The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Direct to home and aiming sky-high

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barely two months into operation, Tata Sky has reached 796 cities and towns in the east and is eyeing a subscriber base of around 2.5 lakh in the next 10 months.

 Vikram Kaushik, managing director and CEO of Tata Sky Limited, said on Thursday the companys direct-to-home (DTH) service, launched on August 8, has a lot to offer. Tata Sky is set to revolutionise telly viewing through its digital quality picture and sound.

 The viewers will have access to more than 100 channels, including all in the Star, Sony and Zee bouquets. Those who are enrolling now will enjoy an introductory subscription fee of Rs 200 a month for the first four months (the offer ends on October 25). Equipment and installation charges, including a one-year warranty, stand at Rs 3,999.

 Those who are now reluctant to subscribe to our services should know that the rates, after the introductory offer period ends, will be on a par with the cable industry rates, Kaushik asserted.

 Tata Sky is set to experiment with several offers in the next couple of months. For instance, the subscriber can pay the installation and equipment charges in easy instalments. 

 SMS service will soon be introduced for subscribers to get in touch with Tata Sky dealers, multilingual customer service associates and after-sale-service engineers. 

 The present line of communication comprises a toll-free number (1-901-4256633) and an STD one (040-66006633). The companys website can be accessed at www.tatasky.com.

 Several bouquets of channels with different rates will be introduced, with the viewer having the choice to opt for his favourite bouquet. Free-to-air channels will be part of each package.

 We have eight interactive functionality channels for news, sports and games. The service allows the subscriber to play video games, decide on the camera angle or the language of commentary during a cricket or football match, Kaushik said.

 One can enjoy the same digital quality picture by using a 25-year-old, black-and-white TV set... A subscriber has to pay an installation charge of Rs 1,000 if he shifts residence but carries the equipment, Kaushik signed off.

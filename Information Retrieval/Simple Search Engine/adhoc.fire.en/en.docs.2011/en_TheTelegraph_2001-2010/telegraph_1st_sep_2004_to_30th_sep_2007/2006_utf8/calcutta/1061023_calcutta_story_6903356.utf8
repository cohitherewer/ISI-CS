 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: Spiritual influence. A Telegraph picture

 Come Tuesday, the hallowed portals of the state Assembly will play host to an unlikely guest Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. 

 The founder of the Art of Living will deliver the keynote address at a national seminar on Culture of Peace with Reference to Tolerance in the Assembly lobby. 

 Spiritual leaders have a great influence on society and thats why we have invited Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for the programme to celebrate United Nations Day in Calcutta, said Sitaram Sharma, secretary, West Bengal Federation of United Nations Association. 

 The organisation is part of an international NGO, World Federation of United Nations Association, which was set up in 1946 to encourage peoples involvement in United Nations. The other participants at the programme will include CPM parliamentarian Md Salim, Trinamul Congress legislator Sougata Roy and Congress leader Pradeep Bhattacharya. 

 Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, who is also the president of the state chapter of the United Nations Association, will preside over the proceedings, billed as the first of its kind in the Assembly. 

 The topic is more important than the venue. Religious tolerance is the key to ensure world peace. To make the discussions meaningful, we are also inviting representatives from the Christian and Muslim communities, added Sharma. 

 Besides addressing the gathering at the Assembly, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will teach pranayam and meditation at Rabindra Sarobar stadium till Tuesday. 

 Participants at the programme will be taught pranayam and meditation by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. He has brought to the masses ancient techniques, which were traditionally kept exclusive, said one of the organisers. 

 He added that there is a mad rush to enrol for the two-hour sessions, to be conducted twice daily for three days. 

 Percussionist and composer Bickram Ghosh performed a musical with 200 classical instrumentalists on Sunday, the opening day of the camp. He stated: People can practise these self-development modules at home to calm their minds and increase their energy. Through these programmes, thousands across the world have found ways to control depression, suicidal tendencies and aggressive behaviour. 

 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will visit Ramakrishna Mission in Narendrapur on Monday and also take stock of the Art of Living movement in the state.

 Prison data to go digital 

 - Records, rosters in networked computers for instant access

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government has taken up a Rs 2-crore computerisation programme in central jails to simplify access to prisoner records and improve security.

 According to the plan, the case histories, court orders, duty rosters of jailers and the security details will be stored in computers once the system is in place. National Informatics Centre (NIC) has developed a software for the purpose.

 In addition, all the central jails will be connected with Writers? Buildings by a network. ?The move is aimed at improving efficiency in jails and making the security fool-proof,?? said jail and social welfare secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar.

 Six central jails, including Presidency, Alipore and Dum Dum, will initially be made a part of the network. The service will be extended to the district jails in the future.

 Two officials of the jail department have been sent to Tihar jail, which has already been computerised, to find out more about the functioning of the system.

 ?It has become impossible to keep a tab on the activities in the jails and the movement of over 12,000 prisoners. Once the computerisation is over, we will be able to monitor the work in the jails better,?? the secretary stated.

 There are six central jails in the state, of which three are located in Calcutta. Each central jail has between 2,000 and 2,500 prisoners on an average. At present, the jail records are preserved on paper.

 ?On several occasions, investigating agencies and the administration of other states have sought details of criminals lodged in the central jails. We have to face a great deal of difficulty in retrieving case histories from the heaps of files. After computerisation, all the information will be available at the click of a mouse,?? Rajendrakumar added.

 He felt that digitisation of records would also be of help to the police and investigating agencies, as they will be able to instantly obtain information on criminals.

 ?It is also difficult to track the performance of the jail employees, especially of the security guards, from the headquarters. We have to depend on reports from the jail authorities and there is no scope to verify them. Computerisation will enable us to obtain the required information in an instant,? said an official of the department.

 The work on the database is expected to begin in a month.

 Carrier charts growth course

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After Bangkok, Jet Airways is planning daily flights to Singapore and Dhaka. The airline will start operating daily between Calcutta and Bangkok from January 14. 

 The details are being worked out. Hopefully, the Singapore and Dhaka operations will be finalised by the end of next year, said a senior Jet official.

 And that is not all. Chief executive officer (CEO) Wolfgang Prock-Schauer on Monday announced expansion plans of the airlines city operations in both domestic and international sectors. 

 From November 11, Jet will fly daily to Port Blair. Another evening flight in the Calcutta-Delhi sector will be introduced on December 1. 

 The Port Blair flight will take off from Calcutta at 5 am and reach the island at 7 am. The return flight will leave Port Blair at 8.40 pm and land here at 10.50 pm. The new evening flight to Delhi will take off at 5.50 pm and reach at 8 pm. It will leave Delhi at 8.40 pm and reach the city at 10.50 pm.

 The Port Blair flight has been fully booked for the next three months, which shows the traffic potential of the sector, said the Jet CEO. 

 Regarding the Calcutta-Bangkok service, Prock-Schauer said the introductory minimum return fare would be Rs 6,000 (plus Rs 3,200 tax). The offer will be valid for a month. After that, our fare will be on a par with the market standard. We are exploring more international destinations. But our focus now is on the Southeast Asian market.

 Southeast Asia is the most sought after international destination in this part of the country. On an average, 20,000 people visit places in Southeast Asia, such as Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and China, every month. 

 Half the passengers head to Bangkok. Currently, there are 17 direct flights between Calcutta and Bangkok every week. Thai Airways, Indian and Druk Air are some of airlines that operate to Bangkok from the city.

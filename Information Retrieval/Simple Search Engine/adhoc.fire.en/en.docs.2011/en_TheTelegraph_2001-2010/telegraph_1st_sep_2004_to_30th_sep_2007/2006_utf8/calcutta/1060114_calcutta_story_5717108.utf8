 Tapping talent for science

 A method to detect diabetes from public urinals, devised by a Class IX student. A keyboard-and-mouse replacement for the disabled, built by two young students of an engineering institute in Howrah.

 If these were the highlights of the Eastern India Science Fair and Engineering Fair last year, 2006 promises to bring to the forefront more such talent from among the schools and colleges of this part of the country.

 ?The amount of practical work in the school curriculum is not much, while there may be some students who are really good at creating science exhibits. This is an effort to tap and encourage them,? said Jayanta Sthanapati, director of Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM), about the 31st Eastern India Science Fair and Engineering Fair, which gets underway on January 17.

 The five-day fair has two components. While the Science Fair ? for students up to Class XII ? was started in 1975, the Engineering Fair ? for engineering college students ? is just two years old.

 For the school-level section, students from across 10 eastern states are scheduled to present their science models and projects. ?Three states ? Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Andaman amp; Nicobar Islands ? will not be able to participate due to financial problems,? said Sthanapati. 

 The participants are state-level winners of the competition, that spans over four months. Last year, 230 students from 124 schools and 12 science clubs had presented some 160-odd projects.

 The engineering section will feature colleges from the states of West Bengal, Orissa and Assam, with their ?commercially-viable? projects. The 2005 edition saw 75 students from 16 colleges offer 36 projects to the competition.

 The event is being jointly organised by BITM, the education departments of the states, NCERT and the sports and youth services department of West Bengal.

 Up for grabs is a host of prizes, including two scholarships of Rs 24,000 each, rewarding the best individual exhibit and the best team from the schools. At the college level, a one-year scholarship of Rs 12,000 honours the best team or individual effort.

 ?The fair is a great exposure and encouragement for students and the scholarship amount was useful for investing in the project,? said Subhadip Basu of MCKV Institute of Engineering, which won the top prize last year with its ?smart eye finger pointer? model.

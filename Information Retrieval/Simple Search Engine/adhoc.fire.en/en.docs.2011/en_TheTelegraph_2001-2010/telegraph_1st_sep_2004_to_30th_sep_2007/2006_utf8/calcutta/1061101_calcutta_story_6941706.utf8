SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY ON WHY THE WAIT 

FOR A WARDROBE MALFUNCTION COULD BE FUTILE

Designer Narendra Kumars statement against the 

hype over wardrobe malfunction on Tuesday; (bottom) Carol Graciass flash of flesh

A pair of red briefs with the words Male Function 

emblazoned in bold gold letters in front sure had an element of obscenity about 

it. But that was designer Narendra Kumars way of hitting back at the hype 

surrounding the wardrobe malfunctions that had marked the Lakme Fashion Week Autumn-Winter 

2006-07 in April.

The first edition of LFW last season had seen a couple 

of slips on the ramp model Carol Graciass blouse had slid down to reveal 

her breasts while Gauhar Khans skirt had ripped to show flesh.

The wardrobe malfunctions were totally blown 

out of proportion. It happens at fashion shows all over the world, but the media 

here just made a big thing out of it... This was just my way of saying that it 

was quite unnecessary, said Narendra, after his mens wear show that 

opened the Lakme Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2007 at the NCPA in Mumbai on Tuesday.

The malfunction mood in the organiser camp of LFW 

is, however, one of extreme caution. A 28-point guideline has been laid down for 

designers, models and choreographers for strict fittings sessions.

Not just that, two international stylists Philip 

Scurrah and Kelvin Harris have been flown down specially to ensure that international 

standards are followed at the fittings sessions.

After the accidents at the last fashion week, 

the LFW advisory board took into consideration the possible stages where things 

can go wrong. We found that the backstage proceedings at a show are so rushed 

that it is not possible to impose any checks there. So we decided that strictures 

needed to be implemented at the fittings sessions taking place through four days 

preceding the show, said Anil Chopra, vice-president of Lakme Lever.

He went on about the safety catch: Each garment 

was checked carefully and the model who will sport it at the show was made to 

walk in it, complete with shoes and all. You can say we had mini shows at every 

fitting session in the presence of the designer, choreographer and stylist. This 

was also photographed so that the garment is not changed before the show.

Marc Robinson, one of the show directors at LFW, confirms 

the prime-up procedure. The organisers are very strict this time. Each garment 

has to be fitted, walked in and photographed ahead of the show to rule out the 

risk factor, said Marc. This is the normal procedure at pre-show fittings, 

but this time the organisers are making sure everyone really follows it.

The designers are not yet complaining about the strict 

test runs. Its good that the organisers have not left anything to 

chance. Its okay with me, though my clothes dont fall off on the ramp, 

smiled Wendell Rodricks, who shows on Wednesday.

The two stylists, Philip and Kelvin, are checking 

each garment for the fit and the fall, the quality of zippers, buttons and other 

fasteners. If they are not satisfied with a garment, they are asking the 

designer to alter it. They are also suggesting ways to improve the fit with accessories 

like belts, explained Calcutta designer Abhishek Dutta.

The stylists are also not allowing a designer to use 

a particular part of a garment in two sequences. For instance, Abhishek was not 

allowed to use a pair of plain leggings on two models. 

And the organisers are breathing easy. The models 

and designers have been very sporting, smiled Chopra.

Sorry, oglers!

Barring a couple of wardrobe malfunctions, the Lakme Fashion Week (LFW) was progressing along predictable lines till designer Narendra Kumar decided to pep things up on Friday. His show in the evening had that special dose of drama that Fashion Week memories are made of. Models with their mouths gagged walked the ramp in pin-drop silence, as they flaunted Narendras line titled In Protest. The silence was broken only by thunderous applause at the end, rendering both the crusade and the collection successful.

 For the uninitiated, LFW was born out of a split between the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) and Lakme, the title sponsors for the past six years. Lakme then joined hands with event producers IMG to host LFW in Mumbai, while FDCI tied up with Wills Lifestyle and stuck to Delhi. And when Mumbai designers led by Narendra wanted to participate in both Mumbai and Delhi, they were allegedly asked to choose their show by FDCI. On March 28, Narendra, who had filed a case against FDCI under the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, lost. The designers LFW collection was, therefore, In Protest.

 Silence is very uncomfortable for most people and so I decided to register my protest through silence, said the designer. I may have lost the case, but I firmly believe that I was right. What I had wanted would have been good for the designer community.

 Drama apart, Narendras fall-winter 2006-07 collection also stood out for its theme. Inspired by Suketu Mehtas Maximum City and artist Jehangir Sabavalas work The Reasoning Vision, the line incorporated changes in Mumbai, the chaos of the city and the order that one strives for.

 The western collection was embellished with traditional Indian embroideries used in a minimal manner and unique prints. The palette picked on creams, khakis, olives, blacks and browns, with emphasis on tone-on-tone work.

 The show that followed was quite in contrast to the subdued elegance of Narendras collection. 

 The Peacock Girl by designer duo Falguni and Shane Peacock was all about loud colours, jewelled embellishments and dramatic accessorisation. The collection is for the seductive and feminine super-accessorised diva, said the duo.

 Earlier, Mumbai-based designer Nandita Mahtani presented a pret collection under her label Ananya. A mix of evening wear and beach clothing, the line boasted handkerchief dresses, slip dresses, shift dresses, kurtis and strappy cocktail minis.

 Kurtis with mirror work and prints, bikinis with loose over-blouses, empire-line dresses embellished with gold beads, stones and mirrors, long-sleeve chikankari summer dresses in white, long white skirts and blouses with gold edging, ultra-sexy halters, wraps and kimono silhouettes were the highlights.

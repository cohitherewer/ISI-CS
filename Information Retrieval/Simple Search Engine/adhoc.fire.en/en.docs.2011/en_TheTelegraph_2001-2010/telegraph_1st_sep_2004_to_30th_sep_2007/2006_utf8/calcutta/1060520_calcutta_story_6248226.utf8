 The second edition of The Telegraph 

 Careergraph Live Career Fair opened on May 19 to a rush 

 of students eager to sift through a multitude of courses 

 in India and abroad on offer at the 40-plus stalls spread 

 over two floors at Punjab Bhavan.

 The Telegraph Careergraph Live counselling sessions, held at Calcutta International School from May 3 to 18, had already helped many narrow down their career options. ?The counsellor confirmed that I would be doing the right thing opting for journalism and mass communication. I am here to collect as much information as possible about courses in the subject,? said Aarti Jainani of Class XII, St Thomas Girls? School, while leafing through brochures at the Acharya Institute stall.

 That the recent surge in the job markets of ICE (information, communication, entertainment), design, service sector, law, NGO, e-governance and information technology (IT) played on the minds of many students was evident from their aspirations. 

 Mayuri Bhattacharjee of Class XII, Julien Day Kalyani, reasoned: ?Many of us have come here looking for short-term courses that can land us a job in the booming IT and ITeS sector. The pay is good and after a year or two, the money can come in handy for higher studies.?

Newer job options in Sector V have also pushed up demand for many courses in local institutes. Richa Srimal of SinGem, an institute of gem and jewellery designing, said: ?After the opening of Manikanchan, the gem and jewellery park in Salt Lake, our student count has increased considerably.?

 Pincle Nandi had come to the fair looking for Ph.D or MS programmes to add to his curriculum vitae once he is through with the MBA he is pursuing at Institute of Engineering and Management. ?Why would one want to go to other cities when there are so many career opportunities right here?? he smiled.

 However, the career fair, on till May 21, is not restricted to courses in India. Tirthankar Dutta of Class XII, St Augustine?s Day School, spent a considerable amount of time at the Welingkar Institute stall enquiring about the management programmes in collaboration with universities in the UK. ?I want to do a BBA or a course in hotel management abroad. This career fair is a great platform where students can directly interact with representatives of various institutes,? he said.

 Many institutes had returned to the fair a second time after the positive feedback they got last year. ?The way education and career fairs are conducted is very important and The Telegraph Careergraph Live Career Fair is impressive,? said a spokesperson for Garden City, Bangalore.

 A seminar in the evening, Design Your Own Career, saw a packed audience in the first-floor hall pick up tips from Mala Mukherjee, a senior counsellor of Institute for Career Studies, Lucknow. Dispelling the myth that mediocre students and those from the humanities stream have fewer career options, Mukherjee stressed on youngsters discovering their strengths as early as in classes IX and X. 

 ?Most organisations these days give only 20 per cent weightage to academic/professional background. Other skills like communication, leadership and creativity score big when it comes to recruitment,? she explained.

 Day Two of the fair will fill 

 students in on more information through a seminar from 4 

 pm, on New-age Careers by Pervin Malhotra, director of Caring 

 (Career Guidance India) of New Delhi. 

 The fair is open from 10 am to 

 8 pm on May 20 and 21.

Fun day out

 Children had a blast at Super 

 Kids ? Rule Your Neighbourhood, a series of fun activities 

 organised by TTIS, at West Wind on May 6. The first 

 event of the day, a sit-and-draw contest, saw participants 

 at their creative best wielding their colours and paintbrushes. 

 In the evening, the youngsters flaunted their talent in 

 ?3 minutes to fame?. A lively antakshari rounded 

 up the programme.

 Helping hand

 The Interact Club of La Martiniere 

 handed over a cheque of Rs 80,000 to SOS Children?s Villages 

 of India in Calcutta recently. The amount will go towards 

 the Strengthening Family Programme.

 While handing over the cheque, Abhishek Ganeriwala, president of the club, said: ?We appreciate SOS?s mission to build families for needy children through its unique concept of providing a mother and home to each of them. We had donated a sum to them last year and have decided to repeat it this year.?

 Worth of work

 After the morning prayers at school 

 on May 2, we were invited to watch a May Day programme organised 

 by the students of Class V-D. Some of the students first 

 told us about the daily activities of the school?s grade 

 IV staffers. Then the bhaiyas (the staff members) 

 put up a lovely performance for us. 

 Kali bhaiya and the attendants of the kindergarten section presented Bengali songs. Then the liftmen, Ashok bhaiya and Prashant bhaiya, narrated a poem and a joke. Finally, the boys of Class V-D sang We shall overcome in English, Bengali and Hindi. Everybody joined in the chorus. We realised how indispensable the bhaiyas are to us.

 Stage smart

 The Montessori kids of Shamsi 

 English School were endearing with their jingles and nursery 

 rhymes at the annual function in April. Older children then 

 enacted a play, Pussy Cat, and students of Class 

 I danced to rhythmic poems. The function ended with the 

 distribution of certificates and singing of the National 

 Anthem.

 Correction

 The picture with the caption ?Pose 

 Poise? carried on May 16 was of kids at an event at Calcutta 

 Swimming Club held on May 6.

 The name of one of the best speakers 

 at the AIESEC Inter College Debate was erroneously printed 

 as Surma Saha instead of Surma Guha in ?Words? Worth? on 

 May 9.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 So near and 

 yet so far

 The Uttam Kumar brand promise is a 

 delicate balance of alienation and aspiration, identification 

 and imagination

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 There 

 is this adage in Bengali Baro mashe tero parbon. 

 Literally it means we have 13 festivals in 12 months. Of 

 the original 13, some like Durga puja are still running 

 houseful but many others have been forgotten. Curiously, 

 a few new ones have started taking their place. One such 

 new festival is held on September 3, the day Uttam Kumar 

 was born. Like every year, this year too, the day saw an 

 upswing in the entertainment graph of the city. TV channels 

 beamed special programmes, his films were screened through 

 the day and auditoria had special functions. All this more 

 than a quarter century after the man has left us.

 Some may argue that there are 

 enough over-the-hill people who live in this city to keep 

 the flame alight. Yet, from all accounts, it is not the 

 over-40s alone. Todays 20s join yesterdays 20s in full 

 vigour to worship the star. Perhaps more importantly, even 

 today there is a steady promise of entertainment from the 

 name Uttam Kumar (UK) for young and old alike. That, in 

 marketing terms, is saying a lot. It makes UK, a 24-carat 

 mega brand.

 What makes brand UK so special? 

 Many have talked about his evergreen looks, his histrionic 

 ability or his heart-touching smile. As contributors to 

 the amazing popularity of brand UK, none of these can be 

 disregarded. Yet perhaps there is something beyond these 

 tangibles. There is a unique positioning that brand UK had 

 been consciously fortified with by the man himself.

 Uttam Kumar as a person was always 

 the superstar personified. No one has ever seen him doing 

 anything mundane. Doing ordinary things like playing road 

 cricket with local boys or attending the opening ceremony 

 of a grocery store was not on his menu. There is this story 

 that has appeared more than once in print. Uttam Kumar once 

 saw Subhendu Chatterjee, then a budding hero, paying for 

 his petrol at a pump. When they met the next time, Uttam 

 Kumar apparently told him never to do that. After all, he 

 said, the public pays to see a star and not someone who 

 does everyday things like paying for gas. 

 Brand UK faithfully followed this 

 dictum. As a result, UK always kept his personae, the public 

 face of the brand, wrapped in cotton wool and enclosed in 

 a glass case. That, he believed, added a sparkle to the 

 star that impresses the distant viewer. It nourished the 

 star and thus the brand.

 Whats new, some might ask, dont 

 all stars do the same thing? Yes, they do. Indeed, they 

 overdo it. So much so that they carry their star identity 

 to the characters they play. This is where brand UK was, 

 arguably, path-breaking. In his portrayals, Uttam Kumar 

 constantly challenged the star aura. His acting style had 

 that rare boy-next-door touch of normalcy. He was polished 

 but never remote.

 That made for a heady cocktail. 

 UK as a person was remote and starry but UK the actor on 

 the screen through his characters presented himself as very 

 reachable. In a way it offered people an opportunity to 

 touch the star. This made the brand promise unique a delicate 

 balance between alienation and aspiration, identification 

 and dream. It made people believe that being UK was difficult, 

 but just about possible.

 In the intervening quarter century 

 since his demise generations have changed, lifestyles have 

 mutated, and technology around us has shifted gears. As 

 a result, aspirations have changed, so has the paradigm 

 of identification. Yet, even today, brand UK retains the 

 credibility of its positioning so near and yet so far. 

 That is what great brands are all about. Be it Coca Cola 

 or Dettol, IBM or Uttam Kumar, their hallmark is timelessness.

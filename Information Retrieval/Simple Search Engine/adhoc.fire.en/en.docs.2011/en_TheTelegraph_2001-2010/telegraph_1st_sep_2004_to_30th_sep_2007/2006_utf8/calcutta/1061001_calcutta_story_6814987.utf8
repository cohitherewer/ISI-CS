The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The big Bong connection

 LOG

 Puja has brought out the best 

 or worst in Bengalis who blog. Those who are not in 

 town cannot help but go on and on about being miles away 

 from the party back home.

 The Great Bongs (http://greatbong.net) 

 post titled Ive nothing to do with the Pujas seems to 

 have garnered the most online attention. Whenever I am 

 away from Calcutta, I impose a total media ban on anything 

 related to Puja I try to convince myself that Puja does 

 not exist and this illusion helps me to get over these few 

 days. After all, as Durkheim demonstrated in Suicide, 

 you feel miserable when everyone else is having fun, and 

 you are not. 

 The ban dates back to Mahalaya, 

 in fact: The only time I like to hear Mahishasuramardini 

 is at the dawn of Mahalaya, half-asleep, at home in 

 Calcutta... My heart beating in anticipation of Puja to 

 come. Listening to it at any other time is emotionally unsatisfying 

 Its like hearing the ting-a-ling of the ice-cream vendor 

 when you know that there is no ice-cream in his cart.

 Prabashi Pujas are not for this 

 Great Bong: I have never attended that staple of the NRI 

 Bengali the Durga Puja on weekends... Puja means being 

 at home, in the company of people you know. And for me the 

 NRI Puja would not be that I would know nobody there, 

 would just go, pay, see the idol, overhear some puerile 

 conversation about Dhakai sari and Makaibari tea, eat and 

 leave. Thats not Puja thats a show and a dinner. 

 Mita, at 6.31 am on Friday, had 

 something to say to that: I am in Calcutta Sector V! It 

 was raining just half-an-hour back, got drenched on the 

 way to office. Here we cant hear the announcement for anjali 

 over the loudspeaker. Venetian blinds block out the 

 silver-blue sharadiya sky. Shiuli phuler gandho 

 is out of question We are talking to or working for people 

 saat sagarer pare and do not pine (outwardly) for 

 Puja, when, just about 14 km from this place Maddox Square 

 is teeming with life and laughter! Its a fast-changing 

 world, friend... does not always matter if you are in Calcutta 

 or Cincinnati.

 comments on another aspect of Puja gone asunder abroad: 

 Sashthi te ekta notun jama porish, my mom tells 

 me over the phone. And like always I assure her that I will. 

 Even though I do not have the five days to adorn myself 

 in new saris and jewellery, I will still wear a new T-shirt 

 over my old and faded jeans when I go to work tomorrow. 

 Ritu (http://myownfairystories.com) 

 says of the posts: Its been the same since the e-boom 

 hit the country: a pre-Puja build-up in online communities, 

 people asking each other if theyre going home, cribbing 

 about being forced to stay away, ranting and reminiscing 

 on blogs. Every year. Its the Bengalis autumn imperative... 

 For most Bongs its a one-week window to fix your social/love/sex 

 life. The friendly neighbourhood pujor pandal, is 

 nothing but an exotic singles bar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Stars struck off screen by court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The fate of on-screen fortune-tellers was sealed by Calcutta High Court on Monday, when it banned astrology programmes on television.

 ?Prescription of stones and talismans by astrologers after seeing the palms of people should not be allowed to continue on television as the astrologers threaten people that without those stones and talismans they might suffer in life,? said Justice Girish Gupta.

 After Monday?s court observation, telecast of programmes on astrology would be considered violation of the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995.

 Justice Gupta made the observation while disposing of a petition moved by Banerjee Media Entertainment Private Limited and other organisers of astrology programmes on television.

 The court also held that since the petitioners had already assured police they would abide by the cable Act, the court would not intervene in the matter.

 The petitioners had moved a writ demanding clarification on a notice issued on September 20, 2005 by the deputy commissioner of police, detective department, asking them not to organise programmes on channels that propagated superstition.

 Appearing for the police, Indrajit Sarkar told the court that several television channels were engaging so-called astrologers to respond to problems of viewers and prescribe stones and talismans. ?These programmes violate the cable Act,? he stressed.

 Astrology-related programmes rake in the bulk of revenues for local cable channels. Every prod from police in the recent past has seen the programmes disappear from the channels, but only to return after a while.

 The cable channels argue that they have to run these programmes to pay multi-system operators who demand a few lakh rupees for a slot on their networks.

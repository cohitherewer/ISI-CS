 Ramps to set right high roads

 - Three links to flawed flyovers will ease car crawl on ground, make more motorists zoom above

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The flyovers were meant to ease traffic congestion on the ground and help vehicles zoom overhead. But the ground reality has not changed much, mainly because of the straight-and-narrow path the flyovers follow, with a myopic lack of link roads.

 Now, it?s time to set the flawed flyovers right by taking the ramp route.

 The transport department has decided to add three ramps to the Japan Bank for International Cooperation-funded AJC Bose Road and Park Street flyovers, at a cost of Rs 34 crore (see graphic).

 According to the plan, two arms will be added to the AJC Bose Road flyover, one allowing vehicles from Sarat Bose Road to hit the high road and the other allowing vehicles from the flyover to descend to APC Road, off Beckbagan.

 One ramp will be added to the Park Street flyover, enabling vehicles to hit Mayo Road from the high road.

 ?We have decided to add the three ramps so that vehicles can take these thoroughfares from (or to, in the case of Sarat Bose Road) the flyover. Therefore, many more vehicles would use the two flyovers. We are on the verge of completing the preliminary work and expect to start construction after Puja 2006,?? stated transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 Another ramp on the AJC Bose Road flyover climbing down to Camac Street is also on the drawing board. It would be finalised only after the first three ramps are completed, said transport officials.

 Officials of Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the implementing agency of the project, said Consulting Engineering Services and Stup Consultant had prepared the feasibility report for the three ramps. 

 ?We will start work after the detailed project report is prepared in about three months,? added HRBC officials.

 The AJC Bose Road, Gariahat, Lockgate Road and Park Street flyovers are all built straight, without any ramps. Traffic snarls in these areas will not cease until the extensions are built, according to the feasibility report.

 The design deficiencies came to the fore after the transport department realised that the chaos on the roads below and around the flyovers had not reduced. The number of vehicles using the flyovers was also below expectation.

 Transport department officials argued that they had suggested additional arms for the flyovers to the Japanese consultant prior to construction, but that had been overruled. ?We expect the traffic congestion at the intersection of Park Street and AJC Bose Road to be substantially reduced after the new arms are put in place,?? said HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee.

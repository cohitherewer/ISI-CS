 From bachelors in business administration (BBA) to bachelors in computer application (BCA), from hospitality management to travel and tourism, the newly-started career courses are the most sought after by those who haven?t done too well in this year?s Higher Secondary (HS). 

 A day after the results of the examination was declared, serpentine queues formed outside colleges like Presidency, Lady Brabourne and Goenka. 

 In contrast to the crowd looking to join professional courses, most of the admission-seekers at the premier colleges had scored at least 65 per cent in the HS. 

 ?Top colleges want high marks. It is difficult to get into a reputed institution. Under the circumstances, it is wise to study a professional course. At least this will help me shape my future,? said Anupam Mukherjee, who scored 58 per cent in the HS science stream. BBA is his first choice now.

 For students like Anupam, the decision by the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) to increase seats in the professional courses to nearly 5,000 from this year could prove to be a boon.

 ?We conduct at least 12 three-year professional degree courses. The BBA course, offered by several affiliated colleges, is in great demand this year,? said WBUT vice-chancellor Ashoke Thakur.

 Manoj Joshi of the George Telegraph group of professional colleges, affiliated to the WBUT, echoed Thakur: ?Our BBA course is the most sought after. This time, we have also noticed a spurt in demand for courses in hospitality management and travel and tourism.?

 According to WBUT officials, with malls becoming a retail fixture in Calcutta, the course in supply chain management is also drawing students. Most of the applicants have scored between 45 and 60 per cent in the examination.

 Calcutta University pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das acknowledged the tendency among students who have passed in the second division to choose professional courses over graduation without honours. ?The trend is being noticed from last year,? he said.

 Last year, there were no takers 

 for more than 2,000 non-honours B.Sc seats in city colleges. 

 ?This is a sign that students of average merit are opting 

 for non-conventional courses that are more job-oriented 

 than the B.Sc courses,? the pro vice-chancellor declared.

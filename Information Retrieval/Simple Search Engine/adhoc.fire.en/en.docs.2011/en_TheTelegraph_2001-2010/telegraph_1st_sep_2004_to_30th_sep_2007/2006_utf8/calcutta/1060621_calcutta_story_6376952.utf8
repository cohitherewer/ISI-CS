 Brazil is my favourite to win the World Cup. They have a lot of new players with great skill. Among the more experienced players, I think Ronaldinho will make an impact. Wayne Rooney?s injury has dented the chances of England, the second-best team. Among the other superstars, Beckham and Zidane have not done well in the past two years, so not much can be expected from them.

 The star-studded Brazilian team is undoubtedly my pick in this year?s World Cup. The unstoppable quartet of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka and Adriano is capable of keeping the Cup in Brazil. Roberto Carlos is another talented player who can prove a trump card.

 Brazil. It was, it is and it will remain the best football team in the world. The other 31 teams in the fray are only competing for the second spot, but can?t actually acknowledge that for fear of letting their supporters down. Brazil?s reserve bench is so strong that if it fielded two teams in the Cup, they would have met in the final.

 There are many good teams in the World Cup, but I will support Argentina because Diego Maradona once played for it. Argentina has wonderful players like Aimar, Crespo and Zanetti, and has the potential to produce one spectacular performance after another. A tough group in the preliminary round will force the team to reach top form early in the tournament.

 Brazil will lift the World Cup for the sixth time this year. Besides having the strongest team, it is the only country with a proven record of rising to the occasion.

 Undoubtedly Brazil. The team is my all-time favourite. It consists of the best players in the world. The three Rs ? Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos ? are a terror for any opposition. They can win a match by themselves. The Brazilian players are never found wanting in terms of hard work, consistency and dedication, hence they stand the best chance.

 Brazil undoubtedly has the greatest chance of lifting the World Cup. It has the most balanced side, with the internationally-acclaimed Ronaldinho providing cutting edge to the forward line.

 Germany, the host nation, is the favourite to win the tournament. Home support and familiarity with the playing conditions would prove crucial to its success. The indomitable German spirit will carry the team far in the competition. Also, Germany has not won the World Cup recently and will surely leave no stone unturned to keep the Cup at home.

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park

 With players like Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Kaka, Robinho, Roberto Carlos and the veteran Cafu,Brazil is poised for glory. Without any doubt, Ronaldinho is the best striker in the world. When he gets a ball inside the penalty box, he scores more often than not. Most importantly, the team will not lack the motivation to play as a unit.

Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur 

 Brazil is my favourite team. Its record speaks for itself. I am confident that Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos will be able to win the country the Cup. Having said that, I am constantly saddened by the fact that a country as large as India has never succeeded in participating in the World Cup.

Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala

 Being a supporter of Brazil, I hope it will bag the World Cup this year. The team hardly has any competition. Short passes and excellent ball skill make the Brazilian game the most attractive to watch. Besides, the attacking technique of the Brazilian players is the best in the world.

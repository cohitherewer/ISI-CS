 What: 

 The Great Cookie Challenge. 

 Where: ITC Sonar Bangla 

 Sheraton amp; Towers.

 When: Wednesday.

 Grab a bite: After a three-day face-off involving the patisseries of ITC hotels from across the country, the Chocolate Fudge was adjudged the Welcomcookie.

 The workshop saw the chefs creating 72 cookies in their quest for the perfect cookie. It included tasting sessions, brainstorming and perfecting recipes. Following an initial shortlisting by an internal panel of judges, 15 cookies were selected. The winning cookie was adjudged on the basis of appealing to all the senses ? visual, texture, aroma and flavour.

 A panel of judges comprising Anamika Khanna, Agnimitra Paul, Rohita Bhaskaran and Jayabrato Chatterjee chose the Chocolate Fudge cookie over Biscotti. This will now get pride of place at all ITC hotels across the country as Welcomcookie.

 Chaat corner

 What: Launch of Chaat.in Kolkata.

 Where: 24, Camac Street, next to Vardaan Market.

 When: Thursday afternoon.

 Grab a bite: A joint venture of Poddars Thandai and Pai Foods Pvt Ltd, the restaurant serves the trademark Calcutta chaat in comfortable and clean surroundings.

 The Chaat.in Kolkata menu boasts a list of perennial favourites ? Pav Bhaji, Raaj Kachori, Papri Chaat, Bhel Muri, Samosa and more. An occasional deviation from the chaat fare in the form of Vegetarian Momos, Fried Rice and Coleslaw Sandwich is on offer.

 After 30 years of serving their signature-style Thandai, an elaborate Thandai section was inevitable. Choose from Badam Milk Shake, Badam Syrup in Water, Keshar Milk Shake and Keshar Syrup in Water. The beverage menu also includes lassi, fresh fruit juices and milk shakes. 

 End on a sweet note with a choice of ice-cream, Imarti, Son Papri, Rasmalai and Kulfi. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices range from Rs 15 to Rs 60.

 Voiceover: This is our attempt to take the iconic popularity of street food in Calcutta, which has so long been marred by the lack of hygiene standards, a step further. Here we use mineral water for the chaat, said Pankaj Poddar, director of Poddars Thandai.

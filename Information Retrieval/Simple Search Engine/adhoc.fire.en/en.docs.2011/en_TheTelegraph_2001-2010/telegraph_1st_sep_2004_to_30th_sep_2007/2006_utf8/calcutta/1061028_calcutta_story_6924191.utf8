 The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) and state government representatives held a series of talks on Friday on current and potential private-public partnerships for delivering affordable but quality healthcare to the common man.

 The discussions were part of the inaugural session of Health and Lifestyle Show, 2006, being organised at Taj Bengal by the BCCI, in association with the state government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and The Telegraph. The show ends on October 29.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya spoke about the nascent collaboration in the health sector. 

 Among the other speakers were cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty, of Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiology, and Amit Ghose, chairman of the BCCIs health sub-committee.

 A team from PricewaterhouseCoopers presented its findings on the state of healthcare in Bengal.

 The issues discussed ranged from micro-insurance for the poor to access to healthcare in rural areas. Examples from the past five years were examined, with special focus on rural development. Many of the schemes involve NGOs.

 Ghose laid out the perspective of healthcare as an industry and commented on its fall and rise in the state. The early 90s were bad times for healthcare in eastern India, with many Calcuttans travelling great distances to get adequate healthcare. Since the mid-90s, this has changed, and the city is now in a position to reclaim its position as a premier healthcare hub in the country.

 He added: One has to strike a balance between making the public-private partnership worthwhile in terms of capital for the private partner and ensuring the poor man can afford the treatment.

 Concluding his presentation, Ghose elaborated on the likelihood of such partnerships becoming a regular feature in healthcare. The Indian partnership will be different from that of any other countries, such as Britain. Most people in Britain have insurance and there is a huge National Health Service.

 Mayor Bhattacharyya said: Its good to see the business community has taken the initiative to talk about the common mans health. He stressed the need for the states involvement in healthcare, as that will give confidence to the masses.

 Minister Mishra reiterated the governments stand as one favouring public-private partnership, as opposed to a private-public partnership.

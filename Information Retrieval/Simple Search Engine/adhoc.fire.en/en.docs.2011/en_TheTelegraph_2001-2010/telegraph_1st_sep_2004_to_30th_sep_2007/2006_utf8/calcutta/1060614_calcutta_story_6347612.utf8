 Learn language, not the alphabet

 ?The boy was going to school with his mother. Suddenly he saw a lovely dog,? read a young girl from the chart in front of her. Before Tuesday, she didn?t know how to speak English, much less how to read it. But after three hours of class in just one day, she even understood what lovely, dog, mother, boy and school meant. 

 That is the secret of success to the Concentrated Learning Encounter (CLE). In Calcutta, it is being implemented by Rotary Club of Calcutta Mahanagar, in association with Loreto Sealdah. 

 For the past year, around 400 teachers have been trained in the method, being implemented through the school?s Shiksha Prakalpo project in 450 centres in the city.

 ?So, overall 26,000 children will benefit from it, not just in learning English but also Bengali, Hindi and Urdu,? smiles Sister Cyril of Loreto Sealdah. ?We have even trained students of classes VIII to XI, and they will use the CLE method to educate village children every Thursday.?

 Shiv Kumar Singh, a Rotarian from Nepal, has been training the teachers. ?Some of them are not proficient in English, so they learn the language through this method, too. It?s a five-day training, after which they can go out and teach the kids,? he explains. 

 ?It?s a six-year, three-phased programme to make the children competent in the language. After the first two years, they have basic literacy, but after six years, they are functional in the language, which is what we are aiming for,? he adds.

 CLE involves directly reading a text, without first knowing the alphabet. This is done using ?starter books? developed by the teachers, centred around simple stories with illustrations. Through a series of activities, the meaning becomes clearer to the children. In this method, segregation according to age is not required.

 Research began on CLE in Australia through the efforts of John Oller, who implemented it on the Aborigines, explains Singh. It spread around the world after more research and structuring by Australian Richard Walker and Ratnawich Sawalok of Thailand. It went in into wider use around 1988. 

 It is now recognised by the governments of Thailand, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Nigeria, as well as for informal education in Turkey and Egypt, besides being in use in a number of other countries.

 On Tuesday, a batch of teachers at the end of their five-day training demonstrated the method on a bunch of children from the slums of Topsia and Tangra, at Loreto Sealdah.

 By the end of the session, not one of them was left without knowledge of at least a smattering of English, irrespective of age.

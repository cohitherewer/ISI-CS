 Funds scout for staff dues 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY 

 Impending retirements, by the hundreds, threaten to put the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) in a financial fix. The retiring employees about a third of the 3,800 on the rolls will have to be paid benefits as well as a monthly pension.

 Faced with a funds crunch, the CMDA has engaged an agency to estimate the money required and suggest ways to raise the amount.

 Hundreds of employees are going to retire in the near future. We will require a substantial amount to provide them pension benefits. If our funds prove inadequate, we will have to raise the money from other sources. We are discussing the options, said CMDA chairman and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. 

 There was a recruitment overdrive following the CMDAs establishment in 1970 and start of operations the following year. The number of employees had gone up to 6,000, but dwindled after a freeze on recruitment in 1999. On an average, 40-50 employees retire every month, but the number will double the next fiscal year, when about 1,200 employees will call it a day. Nearly 500 are from Groups A and B, the rest from Groups C and D. 

 According to the terms of service, they are entitled to gratuity, provident fund with interest and leave encashment benefits at the time of retirement. The amount varies from about Rs 4.5 lakh for Group D employees to Rs 15-17 lakh for an engineer. Besides, all employees get monthly pension. The CMDA created a pension fund in 2004-05 with Rs 10 crore, but the money soon ran out. 

 The employees were initially under Contributory Provident Fund scheme. In 1999, the CMDA introduced the General Provident Fund scheme, under which the employees are eligible for pension benefits.

 Sale of plots will fetch nearly Rs 3,000 crore. We would request the CMDA chairman to set aside Rs 100 crore for the pension fund, said general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee P.B. Nag.

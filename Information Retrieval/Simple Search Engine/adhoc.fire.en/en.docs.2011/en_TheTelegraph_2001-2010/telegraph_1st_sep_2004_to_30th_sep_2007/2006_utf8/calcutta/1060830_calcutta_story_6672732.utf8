 Pep pill for research

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Coming up, a roadmap to revive research in basic sciences.

 In a first-of-its-kind move, the government will throw open facilities at universities and research institutes, including Calcutta and Jadavpur universities and Bengal Engineering and Science University and Bose Institute, to undergraduate college teachers and students.

 Education and research have suffered a lot in the past few years as some of the best brains have chosen engineering over basic sciences, said Parthasarathi Chakrabarti, principal scientist, state science and technology department.

 By providing the best of facilities to those keen to pursue physics, chemistry, mathematics and biological sciences, the government is hoping to give research a chance.

 To motivate teachers, the state science and technology department is organising a workshop at Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences on Wednesday, where scientists will meet 100-plus college teachers to appraise them of the facilities their institutes can offer.

 Some college teachers have brilliant academic backgrounds They are capable of conducting high-quality research. What they need is the right opportunity, observed P.N. Ghosh, former dean of science, Calcutta University. 

 At a recent meeting of the the state advisory board of physical sciences, issues like research facility at colleges and apathy to research among youth were discussed in detail.

 Non-availability of quality facilities was identified as one of the major reasons behind lack of interest in research. We think a good number of teachers and students will be drawn to research if the facilities are better, said principal scientist Chakrabarti.

 So, from now on, universities and institutes will allow undergraduate college teachers and students access to laboratories, books, journals and Internet facilities.

 Even central government-aided institutes like the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, and Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences will open their doors to those with a knack for research.

 Brushstrokes of change 

Different strokes

 - Artists show a different face at CIMA Annual 2006

 The accent of the exhibition, CIMA Annual 2006, now on at the gallery of the same name, is on some artists who have deviated from the styles by which they are identified and are trying to show something they have not shown before.

 The first names that can be mentioned in this context are Shipra Bhattacharya and Samir Mondal, who has only one watercolour to his credit but that is very different from his earlier work, which resembled posters in spite of his skills as a watercolourist. The label of soft and feminine comes to mind when one mentions Shipra Bhattacharya. Her women used to be quite squishy, in fact. Here, she presents a nude human being with body art depicting images with typically Bengal associations. The figure is set against a white background. That is a departure from the usually lush backdrop of most of her works.

 Samir Mondals style has matured with age. The portrait of the man has a lot more character than his work usually does. Chandana Hore, too, has changed for the better. Her earlier work with thick layers of oil paint was too reminiscent of certain modern masters. Now, she seems to be working towards a style where the fields of colour are bolder and the contrasts more striking.

 It is a pity that there is only work by Ram Kumar. The plus point is that it is very different from his Varanasi series, where he conjures up the steps leading to the Ganga in that ancient city with bold, spontaneous brushstrokes. His brushstrokes are still bold and the colours are still sombre blues and browns, but the figure of a woman emerges at the end of it.

 Several orbs in the colours of the rainbow form the two male figures in Sumitro Basaks two small paintings. With their striking colours the blue, green, red and yellow seem to have a life of their own they have the visual effect of op art.

 Four large, identical faces of women in red, blue and flesh tones cover huge canvases in Kingshuk Sarkars work. This artist was trained in ancient Japanese techniques of painting, which gives his colours a certain brilliance. His work looks striking as a result.

 A reclining woman is surrounded by myriad oil lamps in Reshmi Bagchi Sarkars giant work. This artist, too, was trained in Japanese painting techniques. Her work looks largely decorative.

 The two watercolours by Jatin Das are simple yet dynamic, like a Chola bronze, and all because the artist can effortlessly capture gestures with a single telling brushstroke.

 Jaya Gangulys is the most sinewy work in this large exhibition. It has strong graphic qualities. She makes the minimum use of colours.

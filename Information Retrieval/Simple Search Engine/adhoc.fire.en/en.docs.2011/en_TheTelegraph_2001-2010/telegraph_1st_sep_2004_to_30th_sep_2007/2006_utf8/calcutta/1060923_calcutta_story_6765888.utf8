 Ramakrishna Mission, since its inception, has been synonymous with social service and spiritual guidance.

 In keeping with its motto, Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekanandas Ancestral House and Cultural Centre, on Gour Mohan Mukherjee Street, in north Calcutta, has been running for the past year a project to feed and educate streetchildren and another to help people overcome stress through meditation.

 There is a history behind starting these two programmes. Two incidents stirred me and I felt an urge to do something, said Swami Jitatmananda, secretary, Swami Vivekanandas Ancestral House and Cultural Centre. 

 August 2, 2005. The centre was observing the birth anniversary of Swami Ramakrishnananda, a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna.

 I got up early that day. Stepping out, I found one-and-a-half-year-old Rinku Mallik crying bitterly. She was hungry. I lifted her in my arms and fed her, and took a vow to look after children like Rinku who need care, said the Swami.

 Since then, the centre has been feeding scores of streetchildren and also educating them so they can earn a place in society.

 Around 80 children, up to age 12, come to the centre daily. First, they have food and then sit for prayer. Schooling starts thereafter. Most teachers have retired from service. There are also three female teachers who look after the children with motherly affection. The programme is being run with donations from followers of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, said Swami Jitatmananda.

 The other project is aimed mostly at youths who have lost direction in life. 

 We organise spiritual classes, where people of different age groups practice meditation to enhance their concentration. The session was started in October last year, the secretary said.

 A girl once came to me seeking guidance. She was utterly frustrated with life and had even tried to commit suicide. A few days later, two youths came with the same symptoms. I realised that the only way to rejuvenate their minds was meditation, recalled Swami Jitatmananda.

 The meditation class now has around 250 members, divided into two groups one between 15 and 35 years age and the other above 35.

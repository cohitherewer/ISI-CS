The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Though the Election Commission (EC) is trying its best 

 to hold free and fair elections in the state, I think it 

 is helpless, as there is no solution to the red-tapism in 

 West Bengal. A few months back, the EC issued an advertisement 

 for revision of electoral rolls. But at the revision booths, 

 I was surprised to see none of the officials arriving before 

 12.30 pm, though the time mentioned in the advertisement 

 was 10 am. After working for only about 45 minutes, they 

 took a lunch break and returned after 3 pm. What can be 

 more important than election in a state with weeks to go 

 for polling day? If our so-called babus are not responsible 

 and accountable for such issues, how are they going to help 

 common people like us?

 Several steps have being taken to restore the heritage 

 buildings in the city. But nothing has been done to evacuate 

 the beggars from these heritage spots. These people litter 

 the place and pester the visitors for food and money.

 The illegal filling-up of ponds for building housing complexes 

 should be stopped at once. These waterbodies are important 

 for many reasons. They play a significant role in maintaining 

 the ecological balance. People also use these ponds for 

 various purposes like bathing and washing clothes. The waterbodies 

 serve as a means of recreation and livelihood for many.

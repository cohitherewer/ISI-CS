 Cult names send works for campus magazine

 Theyve named it Blabberwocky, the first international literary publication of its kind. 

 Cult figures from the world of writing are contributing to a magazine, to be brought out by students of the English department, Jadavpur University. As a result, the students are virtually hobnobbing with the worlds greats. 

 Terry Pratchett has sent a poem, Julian Barnes an essay and Benjamin Zepheniah three poems, grins Sudipto Sanyal, one of the brains behind the project. 

 Pratchett is the best-selling writer of the Discworld series, about a world that travels through space on the backs of four elephants that stand on the back of a giant turtle. The poem has been published before, but in some obscure publication and no one in India is likely to have read it, says Sudipto, an MA first-year student. 

 The students had even better luck with Barnes, the British novelist. His agent sent us an unpublished essay on the World Cup, adds Sudipto. 

 Zepheniah enjoys cult status as a rap poet and performer. He also told us that he was coming down to Calcutta in February, Sudipto gushes.

 There were some disappointments. Graphic novel writer Neil Gaiman and Nobel laureate Harold Pinter didnt respond. It wasnt so surprising that Pinter didnt respond. But it was heart-breaking that Gaiman, the author of the Sandman series who has as committed a fan following as Pratchett, did not get back. 

 With John Cleese, one of the comedy group Monty Python, the interaction was a little stormy. When they didnt hear from Cleese, they wrote to his agent that there were two options: a) Cleese didnt get the message, b) he couldnt be bothered. The agent replied it was probably b). 

 The magazine, named after its campus predecessor Jabberwocky, should come out by November hopefully, says Sria Chatterjee, a first-year BA student. We want students contributions from here and campuses abroad. She is collaborating on a graphic novel. 

 But the idea is not necessarily to please the reader. Blabberwocky will have a strange shape, difficult to hold, says Sudipto. It will put people off. The editors still want funds, though. And written contributions. They can be reached at sudipto.sanyalgmail.com.

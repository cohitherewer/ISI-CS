 Fire brigade to induct women foremen

 As part of the state fire and emergency services modernisation plan, Calcutta will soon have 20 women fire-fighters. A Telegraph picture

 The West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services has, for the first time, decided to recruit 20 women for fieldwork.

 ?From experience, we have found that when residents of a building are trapped in a fire, the women do not like being rescued on the shoulders of a fireman,? said fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee.

 According to state fire and emergency services director Gopal Bhattacharya, the employment exchange has been requested to send a list of women candidates.

 The recruitment of women is being made as part of the fire brigade?s modernisation scheme. 

 The candidates will have to pass a physical ability test, after which they will be sent to Fire Training Institute, in Behala, for a six-month ?rigorous training?. 

 Only then will the women be commissioned in the post of fire-fighter.

 Besides fire-fighting, they will be trained in disaster management, too.

 A team of five fire officers has been sent to Hyderabad for special training on rescue operations.

 The fire brigade is also procuring a special suit, at a cost of Rs 4 lakh, for a fireman to don before he enters a house in flames.

 Minister Chatterjee also announced last week that the government had decided to introduce gallantry awards for fire-fighters.

 The total ?face value? of the awards will be Rs 1.35 lakh. Chatterjee will hand over the gallantry awards to 20 fire-fighters and officers on April 14, on the occasion of Fire Prevention Week.

 In West Bengal, he said, the fire services wing operates as an independent directorate, though in most other states, it is a part of the police directorate and the firemen are included on the list of annual gallantry awards for cops.

 Realising that firemen are being deprived, the state government has decided to introduce the gallantry award for them, he added.

 According to director Bhattacharya, altogether 20 medals will be given in four categories ? Agni Sourya Padak (2), Vishisht Seva Padak (3), Agni Seva Padak (5) and Agni Prasanna Padak (10).

 The highest value of each award will be Rs 20,000 and the lowest Rs 5,000.

 Of 100 fire stations in the state, 20 are in Calcutta. The fire brigade estimates that every year, about 80 firemen sustain various degrees of injuries while dousing a blaze. In Calcutta alone, 466 fires had broken out in the past six months and over 40 per cent of them were big.

 Pastoral prints

 A versatile artist, philosopher and teacher, Ramendranath Chakravortys contribution to modern Indian art can never be overstated. Informed by a dilemma typical to the pre-Independence era, his works reflect a characteristic duality; revivalist with a strong swadesi bent on one hand and attuned to a wider exposure of arts in terms of both style and technique on the other. The ongoing exhibition, showcasing a retrospective of his graphic prints, is an attestation of his firm belief that art should respond to the everyday realities of contemporary life and surroundings. Fundamentally Oriental in his portrayal of native tradition and classical themes, his style is influenced by Western examples without losing the essential character of Indian art. A special feature of his work is his sympathetic handling of engraving methods; flat tones with decorative patterning of aquatint and the limitation of colour in prints from wood (as in the colour woodcut Arjun and Chitrangada; picture above).

 Minus carats,

 - Four-year research into making decorative diamonds from carbon particles

 FALL FOR THE FAUX:

 If glitter is what matters, a stone with the look but not the properties of a diamond could soon be the girls next best friend. The craze for the coveted carbon has put leading city scientists in prized pursuit of a poor mans diamond.

 The Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Salt Lake is ready to unveil diamond-like carbon (DLC) particles. The technology used in the four-year-old research project aims to make diamonds from carbon particles, to be used in jewellery sets, instead of the real thing. The particles will have the ornamental property but will lack other natural properties related to a diamonds hardness, as it will be made artificially in the laboratory.

 This project is part of an international research trend where, using nanotechnology, one is able to use various forms of carbon, including diamond, to be applied for different purposes, said Bikash Sinha, director of Saha Institute. All materials found in this universe are made up of atoms that are arranged in a fixed manner. We will simply change this arrangement to create a new variety of the same mother element. There are, of course, some limitations for this atomic modification, but as far as making diamond-like glittering particles is concerned, we have been able to make it.

 According to scientists working on the project, the DLC produced is not a unique substance but a composition of different phases of carbon that are available. 

 We only need to change its structure using nanotechnology, explained Sinha.

 The project of artificially structuring the carbon to produce diamonds dates back to 2002 at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. Last week, at an international seminar here, 20 scientists from across the globe exchanged ideas on how to make DLC commercially viable, said Sinha.

 Saha Institute has taken the plunge after assessing the immense potential to commercialise the product. 

 The nanotechnology-based product can be easily developed in the state and can be successfully commercialised. In Germany and Japan, prototype jewellery made of such DLC diamonds are a success. Iran, Hong Kong, the United States and the Czech Republic have also shown interest in the research and commercial production of DLC, Sinha added.

 The industry, meanwhile, isnt too sure about the commercial viability of DLC. 

 A market exists all right just as it does for zirconia but are there any real takers? Not really.

 Premjit Sengupta, regional manager, east, DTC (Diamond Trading Corporation), compares the project to DNA cloning. A diamond is valued for its natural properties and it takes a million years for a diamond under the earth to be what it is before it comes to the consumer... Scientists can experiment but its unlikely that consumers will want to compromise on the natural beauty of a real diamond.

 Couture jeweller Raj Mahtani of Satramdas Dhalamal, however, feels DLC will definitely have some commercial viability, as it is going to fall into a very different price bracket, serving a separate clientele.

 Real diamond lovers will not even look at them. When cubic zirconia (American diamonds) was invented, people were worried that the diamond market would crash, but nothing happened. It is like comparing silk to synthetic fabric each has its own takers, says the couture jeweller for the stars.

 Jewellery designer Varda Goenka of Diagold refuses to fall for the faux. 

 A diamond is a diamond and no carbon particle resembling a diamond can replace a real diamond, she stresses

 According to Saha Institute scientists, artificial diamonds apart, high-quality graphite can also be produced with the technology. This will open up a new field in the use of carbon particles, though the fields for application of this technology are are still being assessed, said one.

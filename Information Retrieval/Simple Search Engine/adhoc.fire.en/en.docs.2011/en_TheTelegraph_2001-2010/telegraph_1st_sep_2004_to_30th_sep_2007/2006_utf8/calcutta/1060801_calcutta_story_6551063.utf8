 Work on renovation and development of the Kalighat temple and its precincts will start soon, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) informed the high court on Monday. 

 In the first phase, an administrative building-cum-guest house will be constructed at 35A, Kalighat Road, a plot adjacent to the temple, at a cost of Rs 1 crore.

 The Union tourism ministry has sanctioned Rs 5 crore for the project and the amount has been handed over to the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC). 

 The civic body has been assigned the construction work.

 ?We have received Rs 1 crore from WBTDC,? a civic official told the court. ?The CMC had floated a tender for the job and a city-based firm, Kalimata Enterprises, has been awarded the contract.? 

 Earlier, a division bench of the court had ordered the civic authorities to declare what steps it had taken to develop the temple and its surroundings.

 The CMC has stated in an affidavit that acting on a communique from the Union tourism ministry, it had got a pilot project report prepared by the International Foundation for Sustainable Development. 

 ?Around Rs 65 crore is needed to implement the project. The Centre has given its nod to the project. Initially, Rs 5 crore will be spent on renovating the temple and its adjoining buildings, and for the construction of an administrative building-cum-guest house,? the affidavit stated.

 The pilot project includes construction of a hospital building, rehabilitation of hawkers and improving amenities for pilgrims.

 A survey by the civic body revealed that at least five crore pilgrims visit the Kali temple every year. ?But the dilapidated temple and its walls make the area unsafe for them,? the affidavit stated. 

 The matter is likely to come up before the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice N. Patherya on August 5.

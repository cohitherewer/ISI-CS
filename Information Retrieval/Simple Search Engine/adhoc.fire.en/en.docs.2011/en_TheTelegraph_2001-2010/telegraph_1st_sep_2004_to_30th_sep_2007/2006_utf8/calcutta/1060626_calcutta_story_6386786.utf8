 New shooting range

 KINSUK BASU

 Shooting skill is something Calcutta Police cannot boast of.

 In a bid to hone the ability, the authorities have decided to set up a shooting range, the third in two decades. 

 The state government has cleared the Rs 20-lakh proposal and the public works department is scheduled to start work soon.

 ?Shooting now is a different ball game and calls for more scientific and advanced training,? said Sudhir Mishra, joint commissioner of police (organisation).

 ?We have been struggling for some time to offer more scope to our men to improve their shooting skills. Now that the clearance has come for a third shooting range, which will come up at Police Training School, we will soon have more practice sessions that will bring about a greater level of accuracy,? he added.

 According to the plan, the new range will be set up adjacent to the existing shooting ranges and will have all modern facilities for small-arm shooting. 

 The range will have the facility of ?deflected target shooting?, in which a target can be hit by ensuring the bullet is reflected from a particular spot. 

 The cops will also be able to practise multiple-target shooting and precision shooting, like National Security Guards trainees at Maneswar.

 The new range, where senior officers on security duty will practise alongside Rapid Action Force personnel, will be used mostly for carbine and 9-mm pistol firing.

 With funds flowing in for the modernisation of the city force, more small arms will be procured, in keeping with the demands of the time.

 ?We are trying to make the new range sound-proof. If that is done, practice sessions need not be restricted to early hours and can take place at any time of the day,? said a senior officer in charge of the administration of the Police Training School.

 Along with setting up the shooting range, the authorities have also decided to pull down a few old structures at the school and build a sprawling administrative building that will house airy classrooms ? unlike the existing damp ones ? a recreation room and a gymnasium fitted with modern gadgets.

 The Rs 3-crore building, to be constructed by CMDA, will also have a conference room, separate offices for drill instructors and senior officers. 

 Sources said work is scheduled to begin from July.

 Group talk: The Desperate Housewives cast

 The wait is over. All you Desperados out there, the show?s back. The second season of Desperate Housewives starts this Sunday, at 10 pm on STAR World.

 The final episode of the first season left Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) in Mike Delfino?s (James Denton) house with Zach Young (Cody Kasch) holding her hostage at gunpoint. The suspense unfolds in the new season as Zach is waiting to kill Mike. But that?s not all, you have a lot more to look forward to as you return to Wisteria Lane.

 Bree (Marcia Cross) deals with her new status as a widow and will battle with her mother-in-law (Shirley Knight) who comes to town for her son Rex?s (Steven Culp) funeral and promptly sets about driving Bree nuts. Rex will be seen in flashbacks, including an episode about how all the families came to live on Wisteria Lane. Clean-obsessed Bree will hit the bottle in the new season after first struggling to come to terms with her husband?s death and then her new fianc? dying of an overdose.

 A pregnant Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) is battling similar desires when she discovers, after deciding to be faithful to her jailed husband, that the one lawyer who can help set him free might be her ideal man.

 Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman) will interview for a job at an ad agency after she and her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), agreed to flip roles and he?s staying home with their four kids. Her prospective boss (Wild Card?s Joely Fisher) is sceptical that hiring a mother will be quite a witch.

 Bree?s bisexual son Andrew Van De Kamp, who showed signs of homosexuality and is in a relationship with his teenage friend Justin, uses his sexual orientation as an advantage in order to attack the ?moral? values of his mother, who finds him and his friend in bed naked.

 The new season solves the mystery of the new residents on Wisteria Lane, Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her sons Matthew and Caleb, the latter whom she keeps tied up in her basement.

 Edie (Nicollette Sheridan) will finally get a new home, rebuilt since the fire in the series premiere. Her seven-year-old son will also appear this season.

 Mary Alice?s widowed husband, Paul Young (Mark Moses), last seen at the mercy of Mike, will be gone for a while and then he?ll make a surprising return to Wisteria Lane to find his son.

 You will also get to see Susan?s ex-husband (Richard Burgi) in a more prominent role this season. Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha Huber?s sister, who is a somewhat troublemaker to the other neighbours leaves to recover in Utah shortly after her assault involving Zach. She re-surfaces as frail Noah Taylor?s nurse.

 From her unique vantage point, Mary Alice sees more now than she ever did alive, and she?s planning to share all the delicious secrets that hide behind every neighbour?s closed door in this seemingly perfect American suburb.

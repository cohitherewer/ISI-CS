 Horror with a few telling strokes

 - JOGEN CHOWDHURY SHOW FROM TODAY AT CIMA GALLERY

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A drawing by Jogen Chowdhury exhibited at CIMA Gallery 

 The most remarkable quality about Jogen Chowdhury?s latest drawings and graphics, to be exhibited at CIMA Gallery from Friday evening, is their ambivalence. These works were engendered by the mindless acts of blood-letting, destruction, rape, humiliation, massacre and pillage that have, of late, riven the world at large, and the little worlds around us, and have upset old value systems.

 Chowdhury?s outrage at the breakdown of the world order has, in the past, manifested itself through the image of the wound on the naked body. But this time, some of these images have an unmistakable sense of tranquillity. It is as if the violence has spent its force and the peace of the graveyard has descended on earth.

 In a disquieting recall of the Gujarat riots, a pregnant woman sits with her stomach slit and foetus exposed. A foetus spills out of another victim?s stomach as she parts her legs in what seems like a horrific parody of Japanese erotic art. 

 Such is the power of Chowdhury?s lines that he brings out the horror of a situation with a few telling strokes.

 For the first time, Chowdhury has done some large drawings on dry canvas and one of these depicts an occiput held together by stitches, the zigzag lines dipping at the exact spot where the depression occurs above the neck. In one of the largest drawings, a human figure, apparently the victim of torture, lies supine. The bare lines that define the image have the quality of sculpture, not unexpected in one who had done a stint in this discipline at art college.

 Chowdhury has drawn a series of brilliant portraits, some with pen and ink. Some of these faces are exaggeratedly distorted like those of actors in Noh drama, in Kathakali or Chhou masks. As they grimace their teeth are exposed like those of the half-starved yelping cur. 

 Their pulverised skulls are held together by stitches and sutures. Drawn with black lines, the scars picked out with pink, or a dense web of lines and colour against black, some of these could have been the portraits of victims found by the wayside.

 Their visages are modelled on the images of deities. And in spite of having been brutalised they show no trace of pain. They seem to have achieved a mental state beyond pain that is indicated by their fingers rendered motionless perhaps by rigor mortis.

 In another drawing, a woman draws a man close to her in an echo of his earlier depictions of small-time lusts. But here, an exposed scar in salmon pink throbs on the bare back of the man and the woman tries to comfort and console him with a delicate gesture of tenderness.

 Chowdhury shows his flair for design in the way he positions the bodies that sprawl across the space, their rib cages or scars clearly delineated. He shows the same sense of balance when he depicts a domestic scene with a vase and a table lamp encircled by creepers.

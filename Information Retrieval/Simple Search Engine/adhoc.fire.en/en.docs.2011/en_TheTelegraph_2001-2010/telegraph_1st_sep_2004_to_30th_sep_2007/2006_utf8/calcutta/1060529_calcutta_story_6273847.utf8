 Timeout

 An accomplished cartoonist and satirist with over 5000 published works to his credit, Arthur Brendon Cardozo is also a self-taught artist whose works in charcoal and pen and ink incorporate a touch of satire to the overall visual experience. Faces and Verses, the ongoing exhibition of his sketches and poetry, unites the literary and visual arts in a novel combination, producing an effect that is associated with art performed for an audience. Comprising a heterogeneous medley of faces drawn in the style of caricatures, and verses that evoke the feelings and sentiments that the faces appear to express, the show gives vent to certain hidden aspects of human nature that we are typically reluctant to come out in the open with. The faces, embedded in layers of memory and time, along with the verses, also reveal many strong and subtle emotions with a sharpness that instantly captures the moods of everyday life. Hosted by Gallery Kanishka?s, in association with The Creative Arts and Tanishq.

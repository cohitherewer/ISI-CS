 - COLLEGE HEADS IN REIN-IN HUDDLE

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Valentine?s Day is fun, but it?s got the colleges worried. 

 Such days of ?fun? come at the expense of classes and the authorities are wondering what could be a judicious mix of the two.

 State-aided colleges in Calcutta have decided to adopt the policy of other states to rein in ?fun? on campus.

 The measures, though aimed at checking ?indecent and uncontrolled behaviour? on campus, will also ensure that the colleges do not compromise on the required number of ?instruction days?, higher education department officials say.

 For an idea of how the other states are tackling the situation, a group of principals was sent to Pune last month to interact with their counterparts there. 

 The principals are also members of the higher education department?s policy implementation committee, a high-powered panel overseeing proper execution of the government?s education policies.

 The interactive session had twin objectives: to find ways to maximise the number of teaching days in colleges and to check an increasing tendency among students to indulge in flamboyant celebration of certain days and festivals on campus.

 ?We are not against functions and soirees like sports and the annual cultural programme, but there?s a need to ensure that every activity on campus has an educational slant,? asserted Gyanankur Goswami, one of the principals who attended the Pune meet. He is also president of the council of principals of state-aided colleges.

 The interaction, he added, revealed that there was no need to encourage students to observe any event that is not beneficial to the cosmopolitan culture of the colleges. 

 The principals also felt that India being a ?country with the highest number of festivals?, colleges here do not suffer from a dearth of holidays.The team will submit a report to the government.

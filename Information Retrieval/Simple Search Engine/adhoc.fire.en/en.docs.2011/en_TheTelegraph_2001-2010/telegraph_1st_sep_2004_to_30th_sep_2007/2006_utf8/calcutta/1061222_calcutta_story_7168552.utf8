 Census to save trees

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The state forest department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have tied up for a tree census in the city.

 Mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan met state forest minister Jogesh Burman early this week to chalk out a plan to take care of the trees lining the citys roads, especially in the Maidan area.

 Khan said after the meeting special measures would be taken in the areas where trees are uprooted frequently. 

 The census will have three heads roadside trees, trees in parks and trees on residential or commercial premises. Fruit trees will be listed separately. 

 In 2005, we tried to carry out a tree census with a few NGOs and students of botany. But the project fell through for a paucity of funds, a senior civic engineer said. 

 According to national standards, at least 15 per cent of the area of a city should be under green cover. Calcuttas green cover now is 5.7 per cent, compared to nine per cent before 1963. 

 We urgently need a study to set a benchmark. The forest department has agreed to help us out. Our immediate priority is to make up for the loss of 3.3 per cent of the green cover, mayoral council member Khan said.

 He added that due to the absence of recent data on the citys green cover, it is difficult to chalk out a scheme for proper monitoring of any plantation programme.

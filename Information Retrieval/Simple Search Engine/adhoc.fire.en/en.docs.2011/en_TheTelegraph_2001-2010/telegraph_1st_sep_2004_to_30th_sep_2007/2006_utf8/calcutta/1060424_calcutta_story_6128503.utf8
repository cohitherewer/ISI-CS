 Spurred by the concern that the environment and its conservation are losing significance in our busy lives, Earth Day, established in the US in 1970, was enthusiastically celebrated on April 21 by the US consulate, in cooperation with Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Concern for Calcutta. 

 The day?s event kicked off with a walk for 50 underprivileged children around Nature Park on Loudon Street. 

 The kids came from CINI Asha and World Vision India?s Snehadeep Project. The exercise aimed at educating the children about nature and its preservation. 

 The walk was attended by US consul-general Henry V. Jardine, T.K. Gooptu of Concern for Calcutta and a few other representatives from WWF. 

 Speaking to the children in remarkably good Bengali, Jardine expressed his enthusiasm for such an exercise and asked the children to protect the environment. 

 In the second half of the day, Jardine visited the Sea Explorers? Institute, next to the River Traffic Police jetty, and interacted with the students about the environmental hazards in the city and its outskirts. 

 Founder of the Sea Explorers? Institute Dr Kiki Bandopadhyay explained the various environmental hazards in the city. He also elaborated on the problems and the present status of the Hooghly. 

 ?We have been testing and tracking water and soil from the Hooghly for some time. The heavy metal concentration in the soil of the Hooghly is of much concern,? he said.

 Jardine, quoting problems in America, said: ?The Hudson river used to be heavily polluted, but over time, through various preventive measures, it?s condition has improved enormously, and now people are fishing and swimming in it.? 

 The consul-general, while speaking about the funds pledged by the US government, said: ?We have invested over $10 million in various environmental projects in India, of which a lot has been earmarked for the eastern and north-eastern states. Some of the key issues that we are concerned about are the reduction of coal emissions, seeking cleaner alternatives, and restricting poaching in the national parks.? 

 He presented two environment-related books and posters to the institute. The session ended with a ferry ride to Belur Math, which provided a greater chance of interaction between the consul-general and the students.

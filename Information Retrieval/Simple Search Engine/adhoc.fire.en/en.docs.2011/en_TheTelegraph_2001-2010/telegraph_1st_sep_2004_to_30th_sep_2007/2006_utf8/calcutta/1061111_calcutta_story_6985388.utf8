The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Warmth amp; 

 positive energy

 - Brazil World Cup star feels immediate connect with city 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Kaka in action

 As a talismanic wide player at AC Milan and Brazil, his role was to cut through the clutter and create space and bullets for his strikers to fire. In Calcutta for the second time in two years, Leonardo de Araujo is amazed at how everything still works in this cauldron of congestion and how theres an underlying sense of order in the visible chaos.

 I felt an instantaneous emotional connect with Calcutta when I came here accompanying the Milan Under-17 squad (organised by the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry) the last time. Im glad to be back and soaking the warmth and positive energy of this historic city, the former World Cup (1994) winner told Metro on Friday.

 Leonardo, secretary-general of the AC Milan Foundation, is here to inaugurate a multi-functional sports centre at Udayan, the shelter for children of leprosy victims in Barrackpore. The Milan foundation has raised 2.5 million euros for 30 projects around the world, and this is its first venture in India. 

 Why Calcutta? Of course, there is the (Dominique) Lapierre connection, but theres much more to the city, not the least its passion for football, smiled the handsome soccer star.

 Udayan is just the beginning of a lasting relationship between Leonardo and Calcutta, built around the beautiful game. We will actively consider bringing the Milan Serie A side here. But the Brazilian, who has made Milan his home and holds the key to the Italian giants boys from Brazil led by Kaka, feels its logistically easier to bring the Brazilian national squad to the city. Ill be chipping away at both, since Calcutta deserves a treat that titanic.

 Leonardo, who plays every Thursday in the foundations fund-raiser tournament with the likes of Baresi and Donadoni, promised to also steer a Milan old-boys club to the city. Then, he hit the streets to see the real Calcutta.

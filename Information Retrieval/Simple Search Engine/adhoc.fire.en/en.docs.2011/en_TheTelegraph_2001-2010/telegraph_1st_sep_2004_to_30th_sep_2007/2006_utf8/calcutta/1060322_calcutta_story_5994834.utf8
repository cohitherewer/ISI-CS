 It is indeed ironical that in an age of technological advancements in global communication, people are losing touch with their near and dear ones. Swap deals with the breakdown of inter-personal communication that causes misunderstanding and pain, and evolves into distancing rifts. The play gets its name from the fact that its characters do not change, but only actors swap, with four people playing the role of eight characters. The plot explores the conflict between couples, portrayed in various forms through four symbolic relationships. Juxtaposed snippets of conversations and thoughts in the minds of the characters are conveyed to the audience as ?inner talk?. Such ?talk? tries to understand what goes right or wrong in love and relationships, be it in the happy-heartaches of teenagers, among schismed live-in companions or in the case of failing marriages. Written and directed by Adwaita Das.

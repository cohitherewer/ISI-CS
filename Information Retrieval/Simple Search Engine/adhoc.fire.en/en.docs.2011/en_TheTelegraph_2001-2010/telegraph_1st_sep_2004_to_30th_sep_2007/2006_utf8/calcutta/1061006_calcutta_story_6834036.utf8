The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bright amp; beautiful

 You were brilliant in Black, Ayesha And the 12-year-old little lady who stunned audiences as little Rani in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis masterpiece moved three inches closer to her mother on the brunch table, still nibbling on her bread stick.

First observation: Ayesha Kapur is not comfortable 

with compliments, related to Black (a moment from the film with Amitabh 

Bachchan, bottom) or not. So what if it has been a couple of years? Ayesha 

still does not like the you were super showers.

 Second observation: Ayesha is flawlessly beautiful. Both on-screen, and off-screen.

 It takes exactly 10 minutes and Ayesha is a friend. Yes, she loves women, she is a very girls girl, says her mom Jacqueline. She will be more than happy to show you around Pondicherry, adds dad Dilip. But be careful, this girl has the talent to sleep off anywhere and everywhere.

 Very believable, because Ayesha is already snoozing on the veranda!

 The first stop is Red Earth Riding School in Auroville. Its time for my lesson, explains Ayesha. Her passion is evident. I have been riding since I was two, she says. Actually, youve been riding since when you were in my tummy, corrects mom Jacqueline.

 Shes one curious kid, in a nice way, and in the half-hour drive to Auroville, Ayesha has learnt a lot about journalists, newspapers and life in Calcutta.

 Once at the riding school, Ayesha is a different person. She conducts a quick tour and introduces her horses Estigon, Opaline, Habibi, Khalif and Millesime. All while chatting about her likes the colour lilac, black clothes, best friend Cecelia, Potter craze (now she is a little bored though) and noodles her dislikes too many questions from probing journos and life post-Bollywood. 

 Everybody keeps asking me How was it working with Amitabh Bachchan? How was it working with Sanjay? I am fed up, says the pre-teen, visibly tired recalling Blacks pre-release interview stints.

 Its time to ride her French import Estigon. An Andalucian stallion, Estigon is Ayeshas dressage partner. There are three kinds of horse riding show jumping, eventing and dressage and Gillaume trains Ayesha in dressage, says Jacqueline. Ayesha makes a beautiful sight atop Estigon. And it all looks effortless. Thats the beauty. The simpler it looks, the more trained the rider is adds a proud Jacqueline.

 Back to Black, with a powerhouse performance as Michelle Mcnally junior, how many producers were waiting at the door to sign her on? Not many, actually. Surprising but true. Most of them thought shes really blind, reveals Jacqueline.

 But Ayesha doesnt really care. Movies dont feature in her scheme of things now. She wants to write, instead. I have written stories. Some have make-belief characters. Some are inspired by real-life incidents, she signs off.

 And shes all of 12.

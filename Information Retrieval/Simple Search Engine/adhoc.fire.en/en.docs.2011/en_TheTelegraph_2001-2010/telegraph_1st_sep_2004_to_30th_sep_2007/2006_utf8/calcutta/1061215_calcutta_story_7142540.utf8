 John and kebabs

 Rare moment: John Abraham

 calendar shot by Subi Samuel in Mumbai 

 After more than a month of dal, 

 rice and khichdi, the eight inmates of Bigg Boss 

 were allowed to serve up a feast on Thursday (to be 

 shown on Friday night on Sony at 9 pm). The Bigg Boss 

 house became the Sher-e-Bigg Boss house with the inmates 

 given two hours to prepare a grand meal from the mouth-watering 

 ingredients in the storehouse.

 The preset menu to be readied in the couple of hours included Shammi Kebab, Sheekh Kebab and Chicken Tikka for non-vegetarians and Paneer Shashlik and Hara Bhara Kebab for vegetarians. While the girls Roopali, Carol, Anupama and Ragini went about preparing the heavy-duty meal, the men Ravi, Rahul, Deepak and Amit waited with bated breath to pounce on the food.

 The kebab platter was not the 

 only treat awaiting the eight. Bollywood hunk John Abraham 

 was the star surprise of the evening, turning up for a tete-a-tete 

 with the Bigg Boss inmates. John even had a special 

 screening of Kabul Express for the bunch completely 

 shut out from the outside world in a house in Karjat, two 

 hours from Mumbai.

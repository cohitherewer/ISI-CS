The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 She style

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 The red empire-line chiffon dress flaunted by Preity Zinta in the song Humko maloom hai stays with you long after youve forgotten everything else about the highly-forgettable Jaan-E-Mann. So does the red halter and denim shorts the bubbly beauty sported in Salaam Namaste. Thats the magic of Surily Goel (in picture by Rashbehari Das), perhaps the only designer who took the Bollywood route to mainstream popularity rather than the other way round.

 So many mainstream designers are now venturing into Bollywood because actors and actresses these days are very open to experimenting with designers. Hardly anyone has a designer or look fixation now, Surily tells GoodLife, while in town for the Cirque Selecte show hosted by Standard Chartered Priority Banking at Hyatt Regency on Thursday.

 After having worked with Preity for her first two Bollywood films, Surilys third venture is a film with Rani Mukherjee, slated for an April release. But does that mean Rani has overcome her Sabya (Sabyasachi Mukherjee) fixation? I dont think Rani had any such fixations. In fact, she is very open to working with any designer. She has worked with Manish (Malhotra), Aki Narula, Sabyasachi and now me... Thats some variety, says Surily, before quickly adding: But I cant divulge any details about Ranis look now, as I am not allowed to speak about the film!

 The young designer, however, is all too happy to talk about her Jaan-E-Mann stint. I have received very good response for the wardrobe. I am very happy with the way Preitys look has evolved in the film, from the college kid in the first half to the elegant, chic woman in the second, smiles Surily.

 But Bollywood, at the moment, has taken a backseat for Surily as reaching out to different parts of the country is her priority. Ive been in the industry for three years now and have dabbled in films and television (Koffee with Karan and the Jassi makeover). So, now its time to concentrate on my business and expand, says the down-to-earth Mumbai girl.

 Her expansion plans bring Surily back to Calcutta. The designer will retail from Simaaya on Elgin Road from this weekend, followed by 85 Lansdowne where she starts supplying early next year. Calcutta apart, Surilys label will hit stores in Hyderabad, Delhi and Kuwait.

 Though my mom is from Calcutta and I have a lot of family here, the fashion market in the city is totally new for me. For now, I am starting with Indian wear, saris and salwar kameezes, since I believe Calcutta is a conservative market. But before I start doing pret for the city, I will do a full survey of consumer demands, she promises.

 Expansion apart, the designer is also busy with a long line-up of shows. I am showing at Bridal Asia in Delhi in January and have a very interesting show coming up in Mumbai next month, she shares. 

 Actually, winter is the time for serious fashion since this is the season of parties and weddings, too, so now I am concentrating fully on my business. The market is lean in the monsoons and thats the best time to take up movie assignments, explains Surily.

 On the red planet 

 Only Connect-

 Earlier, we saw earth as satellites see it, courtesy the 

 lovely people who have created Wikimapia. This week we are 

 on Mars and thank the good people at Arizona University 

 for it. The astonishing website (http://themis.asu.edu/) 

 of their Mars Odyssey Mission is probably the next best 

 thing to being on the red planet itself. 

 The images on this website are 

 relayed by a spacecraft which left Cape Kennedy in April 

 2001 and arrived at Mars in October the same year. The craft 

 uses something called Themis thermal emission imaging 

 system to record Martian images. For those who understand 

 such things, the system combines a 5-wavelength visual 

 imaging system with a 9-wavelength Infrared imaging system.

 The first thing which puzzles 

 us about Mars is its colour. What colour is Mars, exactly? 

 Is it red, as we have been so long led to believe? The maps 

 themselves are sometimes in glorious technicolour, sometimes 

 in greyscale, but we are told that these are artificial 

 colour codes and the actual colour of the planet is a rather 

 boring butterscotch.

 Boring? The Martian landscape 

 is unfailingly vivid and dramatic, but nowhere more so than 

 at the Valles Marineris or Mariners Valley, the largest, 

 longest and deepest canyon in the solar system, stretching 

 for over 3,000 miles, longer than the distance between New 

 York and Los Angeles. The distance between its rim and the 

 canyon floor is almost 9 km, which is about as much as the 

 height of Mt Everest. The Mars Odyssey Mission takes us 

 into a four-minute flight into the canyon, thanks to a movie 

 made by the Jet Propulsion Laboratorys Digital Image Animation 

 Laboratory. Though the flight itself (themis.asu.edu/valles_video) 

 is imaginary, the images are breathtakingly real.

 In the first few seconds of the 

 flight, we rush towards the canyon rim, dodging tornado-like 

 dust devils which swirl across the dust-coloured desert 

 landscape. The ground itself is pock-marked with impact 

 craters, where meteorites crash-landed millions of years 

 ago.

 Then the rim appears and we tumble 

 in. Rugged walls stretch away on all sides while the western 

 side is a prospect of giant landslides as far as the eyes 

 can see. Then there are tributary canyons, twisting and 

 turning like streams, formed when the groundwater escaped 

 and the surface collapsed. Further excursions into the canyon 

 reveal more tributaries, basins, ridges and catastrophic 

 landslides.

 As the camera pulls away for a 

 last, panoramic shot, we see the entire canyon in one endless 

 frame, like the silhouette of a dancing girl out of a Degas 

 painting, transfixed in mid-spring. One day, this too will 

 become a household image, the stuff of picture postcards 

 and kitsch. But till such time, let us be grateful that 

 such sights still exist, untainted by the greed of man.

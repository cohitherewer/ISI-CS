 Indian Railways is set to enter the tourism industry and is targeting the citys Christmas tourists.

 The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) will organise a package tour to Darjeeling and Sikkim during Christmas. Tourism is our new focus and we will kick off with a Christmas tour to the hills of north Bengal and Sikkim, said Vivek Srivastava, group general manager, IRCTC (eastern zone).

 The first tour, a package of three days and four nights, starts on December 22. It includes journey in an air-conditioned three-tier coach, dinner on board, stay in a two or four-star hotel, sightseeing and adventure sports, Srivastava said. The IRCTC is planning to accommodate 64 tourists in the inaugural run.

 The itinerary will include a sunrise view at Tiger Hill, a visit to Ghoom Monastery and a ride through Batasia Loop. White-water rafting and boating on Mirik Lake will also be arranged, officials said. 

 A special attraction will be the Christmas eve dinner.

 At Gangtok, the tour will include a visit to Rumtek Monastery, Tashi View Point and Botanical Garden.

 According to Srivastava, another trip to Darjeeling will be organised on January 26. But before that, the IRCTC is planning a cruise to the Sunderbans. We have already spoken to various authorities for a two-day-one-night trip to the Sunderbans. Once the confirmation is received, we will go ahead with it, he said.

 For the hill stations, we plan to organise trips regularly throughout the year, except in February, Srivastava added. After the initial plans materialise, the IRCTC will arrange trips to Puri, Chilika and Arakku Valley. The corporation is holding talks with city-based travel agents to market its tour programmes. It also plans to set up its own hotel at popular domestic tourist spots.

 Southeast Asia continues to be very popular for Christmas tourists from this part of the country, but this initiative by the IRCTC will boost the regions domestic tourism, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India.

 According to Punjabi, Bangkok, Singapore, Kathmandu, Malaysia, Mauritius and Colombo are most preferred international destinations this Xmas. And thanks to the introduction of Lufthansa flights, a good number of tourists are opting for a White Christmas.

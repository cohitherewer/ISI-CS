 If Tuesday afternoon was for children, Wednesday night was for the ladies. The next round of Ladies Night at Venom was kicked off by Gladrags Man Hunt finalist Sunny Kumar, performing for an all-girls audience, before dancer Shubhangi Sawant took the stage. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 

 What: Dance Masti. 

 Where: Venom, 6 Camac Street.

 When: November 14, 3 to 7 pm.

 Take a look: It was a kids day out at the disc! An excited bunch pranced their way into the party address on the eighth floor of Fort Knox to celebrate Childrens Day. The theme for the get-together was Don and so, true to the theme, little boys were in macho black while little girls looked their charming best in red.

 Grouped into two slots of under-12 and above-12, the dance floor at the discotheque was packed with young party swingers jamming to tracks by DJ Sumedh. Many a little Don moved to dance numbers from the film, recreating the Khaike paan Banaraswala and Aaj ki raat steps while games like Feed the Clown, Bowling, Fishing and Car Race kept others busy.

 Prizes included chocolate hampers, childrens apparel, stationery, CDs and other goodies. The most enthusiastic dancer, the best-dressed Don and the best-dressed Dons girlfriend also bagged prizes.

 Organised by Calcutta Central Ladies Circle 27, the proceeds of the fun-filled event will go towards building schools for the underprivileged.

 Voiceover: This annual childrens event not only provides a platform for kids to celebrate their special day but also contributes to a humanitarian cause. Last year, the proceeds of the event went towards building a school at Birohi, says Nupur Jalan, fund-raising convenor, Calcutta Central Ladies Circle 27.

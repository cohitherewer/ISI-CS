 Cop duo is man?s saviour

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 He lay on the road, bleeding, as passers-by stood around, watching. Till two cops stepped forward and took him to hospital. 

 Thanks to the prompt intervention of a traffic sergeant and a constable of the Howrah Bridge Traffic Guard, Nirmal Paramanik, who suffered a mild stroke and lay bleeding from the nose and mouth, escaped death and went back home to Bagnan on Monday. 

 It was around 11.55 am when Paramanik, in his 50s, slumped to the ground at the crossing of Strand Road and Mahatma Gandhi Road. Most pedestrians walked past the man, but a few circled around him. None thought it proper to offer the man any help.

 The crowd drew the attention of traffic sergeant Arup Banerjee, who approached the spot. As soon as he saw Paramanik ? his white kurta and dhoti were drenched in blood ? Banerjee called over constable Santu Hazra and asked him to take the man to Medical College and Hospital in a taxi.

 Hazra followed the order. He stayed put at the hospital till doctors in the emergency department examined and treated Paramanik. 

 An hour later, Paramanik was fit enough to board a bus back home.

 Doctors later said that had there been a delay in treatment, the man would have suffered a bout of strokes.

 ?When I reached the spot, Paramanik could hardly speak. His spectacles lay on one side and there was blood all over. He looked at me and gestured towards his pocket, where I found the telephone number of his office, a private firm in central Calcutta,? sergeant Banerjee said. 

 The officer-in-charge of Traffic Guard informed Paramanik?s colleagues about his condition.

 For a fusion of art and fashion

 What: The launch of The Couture Collection by Ikaya.

 Where: Moksh Gallery, 5th floor, 22 Camac Street. 

 When: Till March 8.

 The collection: Inspired by two paintings of artists Avijit Dutta and Sudipto Tiwari, designer Nisha Singh has come up with a rather interesting line of skirts, trousers, salwar kurtas, saris and tops. Both the paintings have a very distinct theme and hence the outfits boast quite a wide range ? both in terms of colour story and design.

 The two chosen artists depict various moods of a woman, something that my garments can identify with. The design sensibilities are similar and hence their piece of art has inspired me to launch this collection, explained Nisha. 

 The outfits bear a splash of prints along with some hand-painted ensembles. Some pieces also derive inspiration from the Ajanta Ellora caves and veg wood crockery.

 Pocket pinch: The art-inspired range is tagged between Rs 1,000 and Rs 4,000 whereas the bridal collection is priced at Rs 25,000-plus.

 Voiceover: Art and fashion, I feel, are extremely inter-related and hence this amalgamation is all about beauty, smiled Nisha Singh, creative director of Ikaya.

 Go Mexico 

 What: The launch of Mexican Delights, the Mexican menu at Little Italy. 

 Where: At Fort Knox, 8th floor, 6 Camac Street.

 When: Monday noon.

 The menu: A Mexican menu was added to the existing fare available at Little Italy, the vegetarian restaurant housed in the heart of the city. All-time favourites like nachos with cheese sauce, tortilla chips with salsa, bean tacos and enchiladas find pride of place along with dishes like quesadillas, cheese corn balls, Arabesca salad and Mexican salad. 

 Pocket pinch: The dishes are priced at Rs 125-plus.

 Voiceover: The blending of non-spicy and spicy cuisine seemed interesting and so we decided to merge Italian and Mexican cuisines, smiled Anjan Sanyal, F amp;B manager, Little Italy.

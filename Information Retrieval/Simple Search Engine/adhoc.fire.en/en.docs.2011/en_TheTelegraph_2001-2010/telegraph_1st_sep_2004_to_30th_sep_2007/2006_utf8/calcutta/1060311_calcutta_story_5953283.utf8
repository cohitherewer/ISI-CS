The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Abandoned finds home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barely 24 hours ago, she had just wanted to ?die in peace? on the bench at Birati railway station, that had been her refuge since Sunday morning. 

 Now, she definitely wants to live.

 Five days after being abandoned by her family members, 73-year-old Mira Moitra found strangers rallying to her side on Friday. Turned out of her brothers? homes, the old lady who can?t walk without crutches found a new home in an abode of peace.

 The generous offers of help and the genuine show of concern from hundreds, following a report of her plight in Metro on Friday, reinstated the old lady?s faith in life.

 ?I am not alone. So many people are with me. I want to live,? smiled Mira, clad in a new sari at her new-found address: the old-age home of Dakshineswar Ramkrishna Sangha Adyapeath.

 The organisation?s general secretary, Mural Bhai, said: ?She can live here as long she wants. We can support her and also bear the cost of the treatment for her spinal injuries.?

 But Mira, so used to the taunts of her loved ones, wants to do her bit for her benefactors. ?I will work in return of what the Sangha has offered me,? she stressed.

 Having spent five nights on the railway platform, alone and without anything to eat, the unmarried old woman woke up to fantasy Friday as commuters, NGO members, human rights activists and even officials ? all calling her ?thakuma? and all offering a helping hand ? descended on her.

 Officers of the local Nimta police station, who had claimed on Thursday that they could not get involved in a case under the GRP?s jurisdiction, took Mira in their protective custody on Friday.

 After studying the offers of help, they first escorted her to an old-age home in Chetla run by an NGO. But when Mira expressed a desire to live in a ?religious surrounding?, she was shifted to the Dakshineswar home.

 Contest push needed for plant 

 lovers

 Effect and Cause? Spelling 

 all awry on a roadsign. (Right) Less students had cause 

 to celebrate Madhyamik results

 Apropos the report ?Fine foliage 

 for flats?, June 6, it is unfortunate that there was a dearth 

 of takers for seedlings distributed free of cost by Suttons. 

 That must have been due to poor publicity. Calcuttans love 

 flowers and most houses have at least a handful of potted 

 plants. 

 Last year, the state forest department had sold seedlings at Eden Gardens. I purchased some of flower and fruit trees. They did not grow much and eventually died. But it was evident that there is a great demand in the city for plants that can be grown in pots. 

 The agri-horticultural society should hold regular competitions to determine the best rooftop and kitchen gardens in different localities of Calcutta and award prizes to their owners. Residents of flats are increasingly setting up gardens on windowsills and in balconies. 

 I recently read in a book called Local Solutions to Global Problems by Bruce Stokes that in ancient times, urban Greeks used to plant fast-growing seeds of lettuce, wheat and barley in earthenware containers, whereas the Romans had windowsill and balcony gardens. Even in modern Delhi, there is a kitchen garden owners? association. The members exchange views and seedlings. 

 Even the kitchen and balcony gardens help in fighting pollution. Gardening is not a costly or difficult hobby to pursue but it provides peace of mind and proves profitable for the environment.

 Spellcheck symptom

 The report ?When writing?s all wrong?, June 5, reminded me of a shop signboard proclaiming ?Bulding Material Store? opposite to the bus stop from where a friend used to take a bus to office every day. He had never noticed the mistake until I pointed it out. 

 But Writers? Buildings being described as ?Writer?s Building? and EM Bypass as ?E.M. Bye-pass? is disgraceful. The mistakes and the lack of endeavour to correct those, portrays the state government in poor light. ?Princep Street? and ?Mangolane? are further proof of their callousness.

 There is no denying the fact that the standard of English 

 spelling, pronunciation and grammar has gone downhill due 

 to the Left Front?s language policy. The advent of American 

 English and ?advertisement English? have also contributed 

 to the erosion of quality. So much so that these days the 

 common people are puzzled by Queen?s English .

 Fare tug-of-war

 Apropos the report ?Fare hike ruled out, lobby glare on cess?, June 7, the bus owners? associations have long been appealing to the state government to reduce sales tax and withdraw cess on petrol and diesel. The transport operators are not in favour of hiking fares since they realise the pressure it imposes on people. The state government can easily salvage the situation by reducing the cess and sales tax negligibly, but is not doing so. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty needs to adopt a positive attitude and agree to a slight revenue loss for the sake of the people. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur.

 Success dip

 Apropos the result ?More write test, fewer pass?, June 3, it is disappointing to learn that in this year?s Madhyamik, only 64.95 per cent of the candidates were successful. In most schools, the teachers do not teach, but remain busy securing students for their private tuitions. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia.

 Hats off for a heartwarming picture 

 of beaming school girls after declaration of their Madhyamik 

 result (June 3). It is wonderful that the toppers came from 

 a school in the rural area. The headmaster and teachers 

 of the school deserve a boost for working hard and motivating 

 the students. The school education department should focus 

 more on primary schools, which are in terrible condition. 

 After all, primary schools are the gateway to higher education.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum.

 Education is a fundamental right. 

 But in India, only well-off people can expect quality education. 

 Common students are often the victims of callousness by 

 educational authorities. This is reflected in the fall in 

 Madhyamik pass percentage from 70.51 in 2005 to 64.95 in 

 2006. The board of secondary education and the teachers 

 should provide an explanation to the public. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 In the dark

 Vehicle-owners pay road taxes for a safe and smooth drive. Yet, their expectations are seldom met. Kudos for highlighting the lack of lights on Bondel Gate bridge (Bridge yet to be lit, fixed, June 7) with suitable photographs. Two motorcycle-borne youths were involved in an accident on the bridge on May 1 as there were no lights, no signals and the surface was bumpy. It is shocking that more than a month later, the bridge was still dark. It is a clear case of irresponsibility and lack of work culture. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum.

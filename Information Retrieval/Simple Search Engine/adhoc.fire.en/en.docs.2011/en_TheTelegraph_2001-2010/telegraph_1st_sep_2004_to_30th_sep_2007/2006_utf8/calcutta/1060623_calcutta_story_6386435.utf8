 What: 

 Arabian theme fashion show.

 Where: Big Ben at The 

 Kenilworth.

 When: Wednesday night.

 Take a look: Wednesday nights belong to the ladies at this popular city nightspot. This Wednesday night saw a fashion show with an Arabian theme.

 Models Ishika, Priyanka, Anusmriti, Dimpi and Rusha paraded outfits designed by Lustrouz, an upcoming fashion house.

 The clothes, designed by Jaya Misra, were mostly of natural and woven twill fabrics. Off-whites, beiges and goldens ruled the colour scheme. The outfits were embellished with beads, sequins and threadwork.

 Voiceover: The show was quite a success and I received a few queries on the spot. However, I feel that the shows should be done more elaborately, said designer Jaya Misra.

 What: Ladies Night.

 Where: Venom in Fort Knox, 6, Camac Street.

 When: Wednesday, 9 pm to 11 pm.

 Take a look: Here too, woman power rules on Wednesday nights. At Venom, women can avail of free entry as well as wine and shots on the house for a couple of happy hours.

 This Wednesday, however, there was an element of style to spice up the special hours. Squeeze, a beauty salon on Sarat Bose Road, organised an interactive hair-styling session for Venom visitors. 

 While a slide show displayed the interiors of the salon, around 25 women at the nightclub got their hair styled, using hair extensions and add-ons. The stylists also gave tips on how to manage hair, especially on a bad hair day, and on the styles and colours in vogue at the moment.

 The highlight of the evening was the Squeeze look ? a riot of colours including red, pink and copper ? that was an instant hit, with five women trying it out.

 Voiceover: It was a fun evening. We use Keune, a Dutch brand of products, for hairstyling and the ladies were satisfied. We tried to answer as many queries as we could within the short span of time and are looking forward to more such evenings, said Sharmila Bose, director of Squeeze.

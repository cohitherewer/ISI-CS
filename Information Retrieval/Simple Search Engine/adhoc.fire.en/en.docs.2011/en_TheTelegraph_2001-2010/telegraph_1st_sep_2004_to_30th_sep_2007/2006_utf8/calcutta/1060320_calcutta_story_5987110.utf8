 Civic house takes stock of bills to pay

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A vote-on-account of Rs 253.55 crore was passed in the monthly session of the civic house on Sunday. The money will meet the establishment and overhead maintenance cost for the first quarter of the next fiscal (2006-07) till June 30, in view of the Assembly election in April. 

 The sum is about 25 per cent of the budgeted expenditure for this year. In the vote-on-accounts, a provision of Rs 10 crore has been reserved to pay the first instalment of the power bill to the CESC. 

 The Trinamul Congress walked out of the house to protest the manner in which CPM councillor Ajay Adhikari had suddenly entered the house on Saturday donning his party?s election campaign apron. 

 Leader of the Opposition Javed Ahmed Khan alleged that the mayor placed the vote-on-account without giving Opposition councillors a copy.

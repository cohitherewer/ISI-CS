of animals 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Painting by Aditya Basak

 The small exhibition at Gandhara Art Gallery on the theme of animals presents some intriguing works by artists from Calcutta, as well as Delhi and Hyderabad. Animals abound in the arts and crafts of our country and in our narrative tradition too. 

 From the Jataka tales and the mounts of deities to the giant crow in a recent classic, the presence of animals has enriched our literature. Anthropomorphism is a vital ingredient of Indian art, its myths and legends and literature but in the better works on exhibition, animals are not just non-humans. They are also the stuff that fantasies are made of.

 Aditya Basak?s strange hybrid sits motionless like the sphinx under a halo or a belljar as dragonflies flit around it. In the other Basak mixed media, the same creature is on its feet, holding a fish in its mouth. It is a delicately painted work, arresting in its quaintness.

 Delhi-based Amitava Das in his gouache creates a personalised zodiac sign shaped like an elephant that could also be interpreted as a blob of black paint that has no reference to any living form. The accompanying piece is actually a glob of colour with lugubrious eyes popping out it.

 Man?s best friend performs a trick as his master ? a little brat ? directs him. Paritosh Sen?s acrylic on canvas is a diptych where the black-and-white side is superbly balanced with the colour.

 Partha Pratim Deb?s icon of a canine form with four pairs of udders is done with a cheeky sense of humour, a quality that is rare among artists of our country.

 Jogen Chowdhury has successfully adapted folk and traditional techniques to express his ideas on contemporary life. Here he uses dry pastel to draw toys that used to be sold at every mela. So steady is his hand that he must have drawn each bird at a single go and got it right, too.

 The dog as god reappears in Ashok Bhowmik?s painting of what seems to be an adaptation of the image of an Egyptian deity. In another painting, a clockwork fish with large soulful eyes of a human being floats past a shoal.

 Manjit Bawa?s lion springs across the canvas in a blaze of colours applied to give the impression of satin. Sekhar Roy presents a mahout with his mount. Last but not least, K. Laxma Goud returns with his randy goats in a beautiful etching.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Points plenty on youth poll platter

 Members of the NGO Diksha performed 

 Es Duniya Ki Kahani at Seagull Arts and Media Resource 

 Centre on April 13. The play in progress was devised 

 by the youngsters themselves, who hail from the red-light 

 area in Kalighat, through a series of workshops. They 

 had help from facilitators like Imogen Butler-Cole, 

 a British actress and theatre activist who has worked 

 with the group before. On Monday, the team of eight 

 along with a few others left for Mumbai, where they 

 will be performing the play on child trafficking at

 Spring is heralding more than 

 a change of weather to a few parts of the world. Last month, 

 Israel elected the Kadima Party (founded by Ariel Sharon) 

 to head a coalition government led by Prime Minister Ehud 

 Olmbert. On April 9, Italy voted in favour of former EU 

 Commissioner Romano Prodi?s centre-left coalition. At home, 

 the Assembly elections are around the corner.

 Although West Bengal is one cog in the greater Indian machine, nearly double the amount of people will be casting their votes in Calcutta alone than have done in the entire 6.5 million-strong nation of Israel. In fact, the state has an electorate greater in number than that of Italy and Israel combined.

 The characteristics and concerns of these three elections couldn?t be more different. India has one of the youngest populations in the world, whilst the birth rate in Italy is dropping year on year. For the first time, Italy?s economic growth shuddered to zero per cent last year, while India?s economic growth warranted an enthusiastic US presidential visit.

 An unprecedented number of young people will be voting in the Bengal elections. What are the ambitions and desires of this enormous electorate, and how do they compare with their Israeli and Italian counterparts?

 Prospects of peace

 The most potentially volatile of the elections has come and gone ? in Israel. Yael Azgad is a 23-year-old graduate who spent the early years of her life in Israel living on a kibbutz (a collective farm), before moving to England. She is about to embark on an internship in Israel with a human rights group.

 In a country that is fundamentally split between orthodox Jews and the more liberal secular Jews, the question of withdrawal from the settlements in Gaza and the West Bank is the most pressing issue. 

 The significance of Olmbert?s election is that it shows that Israelis are prepared (with the exception of larger settlements) to unilaterally withdraw from the occupied territories. But there are critics from all ideologies.

 Azgad feels that ?though popularly heralded as the answer by many Israelis, (unilateral action) is a bastardisation of the idea of the peace process. You cannot resolve a conflict without communication with the conflicting party?.

 A recurring theme among those who want peace for Israel is dialogue, Azgad asserts. ?Israel and the Israelis must recognise that the Palestinians have grievances, with our government and our occupation, just as we have our valid security issues.?

 Growth pangs

 The young electorate in Bengal has a totally different set of priorities. With the economy on the rise, it asks why Calcutta?s economic growth has been so markedly slower than other big cities? Many cite Left Front?s past policies as the reason.

 Sumeet Thakur, an economics student of St Xavier?s College, says: ?There is no question of the Left Front losing this election. There simply is no other party that holds any significant power.?

 This sense of resignation is tempered by the Left Front?s implicit recognition that it cannot follow communist ideology strictly. ?The communists realise that they cannot implement their economic policies in the face of what is happening in the rest of the country. In the past 10 years, there has been a noticeable change,? Thakur adds.

 Abishek Banerjee, a 2005 graduate, is more concerned with what the Left Front hasn?t done. ?Whatever promises they (Left Front) have made, they haven?t backed up. Despite their proclaimed dedication to the public, we still live in an unjust society.?

 He feels, however, that there are individuals within the party who appeal to the young. ?I think Md Salim has the right intentions, but he is one of a small section. Apart from him, I think most of the politicians are corrupt.?

 Striving for stability

 In contrast to the Left Front?s overwhelming dominance of Bengali politics, Italy has suffered the least stable post-war political scenario in Europe. Since the war, the country has endured 26 prime ministers, numerous coalition collapses and rampant infighting. Silvio Berlusconi was the longest serving Prime Minister, with his Forza Italia party heading a right-wing coalition, in power since 2001.

 Now, Italy has run out of patience with Berlusconi?s media-savvy posturing. So what were the demographics of Prodi and Berlusconi voters? Hailing from Milan, Davide Quinto, 28, says ?it depends on the social class. The most abject class is more in favour of Berlusconi than the left wing?. This is not to say that Prodi?s coalition has convinced the young electorate, with Quinto adding that ?(Prodi?s) programme has not been exhaustive enough for freshers in the job market?.

 But Berlusconi?s socially conservative rhetoric struck deep chords in many Italians. Quinto concurs that for him, ?terrorism is a major issue. The liberal and communist mentality opens its arms to immigrants of any nationality inviting acts of terrorism in Italy?.

 Berlusconi trailed in the polls for two years, so it is perhaps only a surprise that il cavaliere lost by such a narrow margin in the lower house. 

 So, while young Israel seeks a solution to territorial conflict, Italy tries to revert years of economic and political instability. In West Bengal, there is a tangible frustration among the youngsters about the dominance of the Left Front. That, however, is balanced with optimism about the economy and a confidence in identity that the Israeli and Italian youth are in dire need of.

 What?s on your mind this week

 Cause for celebration

 We wait eagerly for the annual 

 college fests, which have almost become an index for determining 

 an institution?s stature. Organising such events however, 

 requires a lot of effort, and more importantly, a lot of 

 money. I have seen students scampering around in the scorching 

 heat for sponsorships and spending sleepless nights trying 

 to rope in artistes. It is a tough job indeed.

 However, college fests should not be limited to just having fun. We could channelise part of the funds and use the celebrity presence for social causes. Stalls could be put up at the venues so that visitors can donate money for charity. Awareness programmes can also be taken up as the fests draw a lot of young and educated people.

 For all those who were really inspired by Rang De Basanti, this would be a good way to start contributing meaningfully to our society.

 Brain drain

 More and more brainy college passouts 

 are flocking outside call centres aspiring to make some 

 quick money before they get better jobs. In the process, 

 they often ignore prospects of further studies. Instead, 

 they burden their productive minds with targets and deadlines.

 Agreed that call centres are good avenues of employment, but those who want to pursue other careers shouldn?t rush in lured by the promise of high pay. A huge chunk of the young population also considers it hip to be a call centre employee. Do they know that in many call centres a part-timer?s monthly pay begins at just Rs 2,500?

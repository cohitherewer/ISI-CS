 Artists impression of Grand Great Eastern hotel

 The Grand Great Eastern will rejuvenate the central business district, promise those behind the restoration design solution of the heritage address.

 We will recreate the Victorian and Edwardian charm that had made this hotel the toast of the city in the 19th Century. The popular Maxims and the famous Grand Bakery will also be reopened, Jyotsna Suri, chairperson amp; managing director, The Bharat Group of Hotels, revealed on Wednesday.

 The design team comprising architects61 of Singapore and city-based Dulal Mukherjee amp; Associates promised to retain the genus locii (the spirit of the place) and deliver a splendid but not overwhelming property.

 The hotel will have 244 rooms, all-day dining, two speciality restaurants (including Maxims), the bakery, a 6,000-sq-ft ballroom, five conference rooms, a health spa, swimming pool, a two-level car park for around 150 vehicles and a drive-in porch from Waterloo Street. The first phase of the Rs 120-crore project will be ready by end-2007 and the entire property by mid-2008.

 We dont want the Grand Great Eastern to be a bastardised version of some similar situations, stressed Ashvinkumar, director (projects), of architects61, the firm behind the Raffles restoration.

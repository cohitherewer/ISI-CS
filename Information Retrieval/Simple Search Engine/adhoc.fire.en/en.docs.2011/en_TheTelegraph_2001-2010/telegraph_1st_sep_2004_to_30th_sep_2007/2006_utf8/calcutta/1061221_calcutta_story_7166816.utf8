 Night care boon for working parents

 - Young couples out on official tour or at parties happy with facility of after-dark creche

 POULOMI BANERJEE

 And now, a creche for parents nights out.

 Young couples with babies need not spend New Years eve at home changing nappies. Recognising the need of couples, especially working couples, to take the occasional night out, a city creche is offering night care for children. Kidz Konclave, a creche on Keyatala Road, in south Calcutta, started the service this Puja.

 I would keep getting requests and, once in a while, agree to keep the child at night, says Indira Sengupta of Kidz Konclave. There is one mother who works in the tourism industry and has to travel. Her husband, too, is frequently on tour. After repeated requests from her, Sengupta started the night creche. 

 While there are a number of day-care creches in the city, night care for children is a problem, with nuclear families, untrained maids and the ayah who may not be trustworthy. I think we are the first night creche in the city, says Sengupta. 

 The facility started just before the Pujas and Sengupta had a full house during the festival. We had to say no on Ashtami. We took the kids out to pandals in the morning, had picnics and parties for them, Sengupta said.

 Parents are happy. Renuka Natu, a visiting faculty with Frankfinn, the airhostess academy, leaves her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Aaria at the night creche. My husbands job also requires us to be present at many official parties. Also, once in a while, we need to get a life, we need to party. Like on December 31, she adds. The couple doesnt want to make it a habit, but its quite comfortable with the new-age facility. 

 Entrepreneur Sarala Sharma left her child at Kidz Konclave for two days and nights, when she had go out of town.

 Other creches recognise the need but are not thinking of starting night services. Sahana Sengupta of Springdale creche, says: I do get requests from parents to keep children in the evening, but it is not possible for me to take care of them after 6 pm. 

 Beena Sharma of Dolna, a creche in Kasba, said the creche has no plans to extend its 9.30 am-6.30 pm hours.

 Pre-teen children generally have little to do with the organisation of community Durga pujas. But that has not deterred Behala Young Mens Association from vesting the responsibility of their puja on a group of five to 12-year-olds. 

 The 20 kids have been handpicked from art schools and asked to portray the goddess they envisage her. The writ extends to the other aspects of the festivities. 

 Durga puja is such a huge festival in this part of the world but surprisingly, the children do not participate in it. They are a part of the festivities, but it is their elders who conceptualise and organise the festival, said Bhabatosh Sutar, the artist who came up with the idea of holding a puja conceived by children.

 The artwork used in the Behala puja will be executed by children. Sutar cited the example of Satyajit Rays film Sonar Kella, where drawings by a boy were used to depict the images of Rajasthan.

 The children see an animal or an object the same way as we do. But their imagination registers it in their minds in a different fashion. Sometimes, whatever they see, they associate with people or situations, explained Sutar.

 It took the artist three months to give shape to his idea. The children selected are from different parts of the city. They meet at the artists studio in Behala every Sunday.

 The impromptu workshops have sprung up surprises. Images of computers and the latest toys have found their place in the puja art. Some children, for example, have drawn Beyblades and masks from Krrish. 

 The way children perceive things is completely different from the way we perceive them. A girl drew her mother as Durga, while a boy drew the help in his house as the goddess. Another child drew the idol on a kite, stated the artist. 

 The association members, too, are upbeat about the way the puja is shaping up. 

 Almost every puja is based on a theme, which ranges from controversies to spoofs. We wanted to do something different this year by giving a chance to the children, said Surajit Sen, secretary of the 57-year-old club.

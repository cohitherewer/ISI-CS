 Liquor link in drowning

 - Picnickers were warned off pond, police rule out foul play

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The two picnickers who drowned on Sunday in a pond in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, were heavily drunk, police said on Monday. 

 One them was Abhishek Saha, a Class XII student of a Kidderpore school. He celebrated his 18th birthday just four days before, on July 27. 

 The other victim was a 23-year-old Jeet Pal, a businessman. Both Jeet and Abhishek were residents of the Watgunge area.

 ?We have recovered several empty bottles of liquor from the house where the duo and six others had gone for a picnic. The bottles suggest they had partied hard,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). 

 ?We have received the post-mortem reports and there is no indication of any foul play in the death of Jeet and Abhishek,? he added.

 The group of eight ? seven boys and a girl student of Class XI ? had left for the private bungalow in Langalberia, in Sonarpur, in a Maruti Omni and an Esteem early on Sunday. 

 Jeet, who ran a business of spices, was leading the group. They took along two cooks for preparing breakfast and lunch.

 ?Towards noon, some of the team members strayed towards a pond on the compound of the bungalow. The caretaker warned them not to take a plunge, as the pond had been dug recently and was very deep,? said a senior officer of Sonarpur police station.

 There was also a signboard beside the pond declaring that swimming is prohibited.

 Abhishek sat on the edge of the pond, chatting with his friends, while Jeet was filming the group with his video recorder. Suddenly, Abhishek jumped into the pond.

 As he had earlier told his friends that he could swim, those with him did not jump after him immediately.

 It was only after Abhishek started sinking that Jeet dived to his rescue. But with Abhishek trying to cling on to Jeet in desperation, both went down. 

 Others in the group then rushed to the caretaker and even called the two cooks.

 Jeet and Abhishek were finally fished out and administered first-aid. After trying in vain to pump out the water, the friends took them to a local nursing home, from where they were referred to another private hospital on Diamond Harbour Road, in Ekbalpore.

 It was in the second hospital that doctors pronounced Jeet and Abhishek dead.

 On Monday, police interrogated the youths and even spoke to their parents, the two cooks and the caretaker.

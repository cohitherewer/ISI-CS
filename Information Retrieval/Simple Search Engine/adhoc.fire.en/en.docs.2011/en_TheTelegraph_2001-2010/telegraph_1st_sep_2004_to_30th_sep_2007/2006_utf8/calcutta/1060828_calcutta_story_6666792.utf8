 BATWOMAN: Mandira Bedi

 Come September 10 and she will be back on our streets. Before you let your imagination run wild, Mandira Bedi is just coming to town for another round of Gully Cricket. Two years after she took the Calcutta streets by storm, the uncrowned queen of womens cricket will be padding up for another roadside rendezvous.

 We do it so well because we at MAX are the only guys who do para cricket, gushes an excited Mandira on the phone from Mumbai. The last time we played, it was a build up to the England edition of Champions Trophy and this time, Gully Cricket will lead right into the tournament here in India.

 And if you think Mandira just swings the willow for the flashbulbs, go try a late cut. I have already started practising as I will have to play in more than eight cities this time, from Lucknow to Coimbatore, she says. Every evening, I get the boys who work at home to bowl at me with the tennis ball. Oh, it will be so exciting to take to the roads again and play with all the lovely ladies in their salwars and caps!

 If theres one sporting city that bowls her over, it is Calcutta. Everybody there is so much in tune with sports, she explains why. Cricket, golf, football... they always know whats happening.

 But Mandira isnt too happy with whats happening currently in the world of cricket the Hair-raising run of play. I think, for Pakistan, it was justified to have made a protest, she makes her point. But it wasnt a good idea to not come out to play. A simple black armband could have conveyed what they were trying to say.

 Mandira, of course, is most excited to pad up for her Extraaa Innings once again. We are in the process of bringing you a fantastic package of entertainment, she promises. The best thing about our show is that it is never just about the days play. Its so much more.

 Winning moves: Sangeeta

 Before going into the final of the kids series on Sonys popular dance show Boogie Woogie, most of the shows judges did not give Asansols Sangeeta much of a chance. Why? Because she could only dance in the eastern style.

 The other kids are so versatile, so even though Sangeeta is good she may lose out eventually, both Ravi Behl and Naved Jaffery had said before the episode was shot.

 But the dancing men have been proved wrong as the Asansol girl has come out on top, edging past the Mumbai competition. Judge of the final episode funnyman Johny Lever was particularly impressed with Sangeeta and predicted that she would make it big in life.

 Joining the reality wave on television, music channel Vh1 has planned a reality-based show every weeknight at 9 pm. 

 Motormouth (Mondays), Hogan Knows Best (Tuesdays) and Cribs (Wednesdays) are already on air, so the new shows Pimp My Ride and Cant Get a Date will add a fresh round of reality to the music channel on Thursdays and Fridays.

 Pimp My Ride has rap superstar and car enthusiast Xzibit and the good people at West Coast Customs transform peoples cars from dirt to pimped, worth thousands of dollars. Taking car customisation to the next level, Pimp My Ride showcases unheard of pimped-out masterpieces.

 Stepping on quite another pedal, Cant Get a Date shows that finding love aint an easy job. The show is a hypnotising portrait of ordinary people as they wrestle with this most challenging, confusing and fascinating human activity dating.

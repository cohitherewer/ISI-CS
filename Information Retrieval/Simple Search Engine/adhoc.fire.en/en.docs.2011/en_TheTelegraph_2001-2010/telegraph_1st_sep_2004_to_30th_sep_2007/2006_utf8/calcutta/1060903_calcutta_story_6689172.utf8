 All about sharing 

 and caring

 PET 

 PASSION - Dr Goutam Mukherjee

 In the Mahabharata, the 

 dog saw the path to heaven. Nowadays, the dog shows the 

 path to a long, healthy life. Dogs love their masters unconditionally. 

 In Germany, research has shown how those with pets live 

 longer and happier. 

 For the busybody: In the 

 modern world, most men have less and less time for physical 

 exercise a major cause for obesity and heart attack.

 But if such people keep a dog, 

 they are forced to wake up early to take their pet out for 

 the toilet-and- exercise routine.

 And since they are anyway stepping 

 out early in the morning, the dog owners can themselves 

 indulge in some much-needed physical exercise that could 

 go a long way in preventing heart disease.

 For the lonely child: Nowadays, 

 most families have a single child. When the father and mother 

 go to work, the child stays alone in a flat. Specially during 

 vacations, the child invariably ends up spending long hours 

 watching TV, playing video games or just lazying around. 

 The tendency to put on weight and be selfish is almost inevitable.

 But if the family has a dog, the 

 child does not feel so lonely. He can play with the pet 

 and also spend time bathing, brushing and taking care of 

 him. By doing this, the child also learns to share and care 

 from an early age.

 For the mother to be: I 

 know many childless people who have spent their lives happily 

 with their pets. I know one lady who suffered a miscarriage 

 due to excessive tension triggered by the obsessive fear 

 of losing her child. Her doctor put it down to heightened 

 levels of anxiety around the fourth month of her pregnancy. 

 But the next time she was pregnant, 

 she had a dog that had just delivered eight Golden Retriever 

 puppies. She was so busy with rearing the pups that she 

 had no time to be paranoid about her pregnancy. With her 

 mind off the fear of losing her child, she safely crossed 

 the fourth month of pregnancy and delivered normally. 

 For the aged: When they 

 retire after a busy work regimen, men and women often suffer 

 from depression. They feel very lonely and worthless. If 

 they have a dog, they can devote a lot of time to him. A 

 dog also brings a great sense of security to the house of 

 the aged.

 Drug haul duo held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday arrested two men for their alleged links with the huge amount of contraband seized from the port area a couple of days ago.

 Officers said the two Vincent Chang, of Tangra, and Michel Suanpu, of Manipur were looking for a hideout in Delhi to set up a factory to produce banned drugs. As they were yet to locate one, the consignment was not picked up for over a month and a half.

 NCB officers said the consignment comprised 2,000 kg of a white, powdery substance packed in polythene bags and barrels and sophisticated apparatus. The material and equipment can produce drugs, probably Amphetamine Type Stimulator, worth Rs 300 crore, said Sandeep Mittal, zonal director of NCB.

 Vincent had received the consignment after it reached the city from Chinas Huang Pu port, Mittal added. Michel was assigned to arrange for a space in Delhi. He fell into our trap when he landed at Dum Dum airport from Delhi today. He came here because he could not contact Vincent for the past couple of days.

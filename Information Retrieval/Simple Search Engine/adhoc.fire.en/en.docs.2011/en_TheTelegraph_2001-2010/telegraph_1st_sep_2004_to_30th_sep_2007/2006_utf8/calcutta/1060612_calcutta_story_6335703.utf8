 An individual and independent approach to visual representation distinguishes the works of the members of Scarlet, a group of young artists. The fourth exhibition of their paintings, graphics and sculptures bears testimony to their idiosyncrasies in the context of spirit and style of their works. Giving expression to diverse concepts, ideas and ideologies, their art, nonetheless, never appears overtly didactic. The paintings of Biplab Kar reflect the intricacies of the human mind, particularly in moments of confusion and stress. Dhruba Ghosh?s solid, bold structural patterns build an impression of strength and endurance in a world full of hazards and uncertainties. Pramit Parna Paul?s abstract canvases offer an opportunity to explore and examine history. The works of Santanu Chakraborty are extensions of his own imagination and opinions. Sudipta Majumdar (Spring; picture above) makes brilliant use of colours and tones to express emotional states. The works of Umakanta Das provide glimpses of life at its most intense.

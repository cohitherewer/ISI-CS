 The importance of management education in evolving business practices worldwide has been documented quite thoroughly. But with globalisation becoming the key B-word and the emergence of new economies over the past 20 years, the relevance of an MBA in today?s business environment has often been questioned.

 Michael Lawson, associate dean, School of Management, Boston University, was in town on Thursday and spoke at length at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the ever-changing global business trends and how management education has been shaping such trends.

 ?Globalisation affects every aspect of an economy, and particularly education. In the ?60s, America had only 4,000 MBA graduates. 2006 will see almost 120,000 MBAs passing out from our various business schools. China did not have a single MBA 10 years back. This year, there will be around 10,000 management students graduating from Chinese B-schools,? pointed out Lawson.

 With India rising up the global value chain at a phenomenal pace in recent times, Lawson was of the opinion that it was time for the local economy to create wealth rather than income for individuals and management education should play a major role in that process. ?The practice of management education is globalised as well as complex. It is an increasingly important field with regard to India today.?

 However, Lawson did have a word of caution for Indian B-schools. Taking the example of B-school ranking lists, he said: ?A business school cannot be driven by rankings. These features have become a business, and have forced management schools to focus more on perception than on the quality of education imparted.?

 Speaking on academic practices, Lawson asked management schools to focus on joint ventures and partnerships in order to get the best and impart the best possible management techniques to students. The Boston University School of Management dean was of the opinion that instead of concentrating on global or multinational business, there should be greater emphasis on how emerging markets burst upon the scene.

 ?We have to understand how markets move, increase or decline. With the shrinking of resources the world over, economies must learn how to ration themselves,? emphasised Lawson.

 Touching upon topics such as team learning, inclusion of soft skills in management curriculum, creation of cross-disciplinary or integrated programmes, entrepreneurship and research methodology, Lawson said the ultimate key to good management teaching was faculty. 

 ?There has to be a high-quality and skilled faculty, without which no B-school can survive. Unfortunately, management schools everywhere are not producing enough doctoral students who can come back and teach,? he signed off.

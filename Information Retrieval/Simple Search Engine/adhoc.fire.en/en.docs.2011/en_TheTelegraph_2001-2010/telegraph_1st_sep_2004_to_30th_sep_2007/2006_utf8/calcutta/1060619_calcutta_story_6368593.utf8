 Huddle over ISC marks disparity

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Worried over complaints from ?meritorious? students about not having been awarded expected marks in the ISC 2006, teachers of prominent schools in the city have decided to take up the matter with the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools and then approach the affiliating council.

 The teachers have found that several ?meritorious students? have scored marks much less than what they had expected, while students with average merit have performed brilliantly, some even scoring above 90 per cent.

 ?Teachers of a number of schools have complained that the ISC results were erratic this year,? said Ismail Nehal, president of the association and a former teacher of St James School. ?Not that they are unhappy seeing average students do well. But they cannot accept the fact that students who had scored high marks in all internal exams, including the selection test, have scored on a par with the average ones or even lower.?

 Nehal said that before approaching the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, the teachers will discuss the issue with the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools. 

 The meeting is scheduled for next Sunday.

 ?Complaints of low marks are common in almost all board exams. But this time, the matter needs to be examined thoroughly. We will take up the issue at our next meeting,? said J.K. Sen, general secretary of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools.

 A section of teachers, however, attributed the ?irregularity? in the results to the standardised ?marking scheme? the council had asked the examiners to follow. ?The marking pattern is basically meant for average students, to help them score high marks. This needs to be changed,? a teacher suggested.

 Citing an example of the ?irregularity?, a teacher pointed out that almost every student of a girls? school in south Calcutta has scored more than 90 per cent in English. ?This has never happened before.?

 Similarly, in another school, more than half the examinees in the science stream have scored 90 per cent or more in mathematics. ?Among those who have scored a ton, some had never crossed the 80-per cent mark in the internal exams. We must find out why this is happening,? another teacher said.

 Council member M.C. Alexander admitted that there were ?stray complaints of disparity?, but denied having any information about large-scale irregularities. 

 ?The council follows a scientific and transparent marking system. But if students complain of undermarking, we will definitely look into the matter,? he added.

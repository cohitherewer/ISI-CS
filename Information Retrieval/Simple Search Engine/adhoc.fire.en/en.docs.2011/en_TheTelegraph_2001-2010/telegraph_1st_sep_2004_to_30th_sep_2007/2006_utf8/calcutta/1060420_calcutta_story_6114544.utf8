What: Launch of the summer collection by Kora 

at Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindusthan Road.

 This 30-minute play, conceptualised by The Creative Arts, took the audience through the journey of a woman ? her birth, adolescence, youth and old age.

 Some of the artistes also showcased Kora creations during the play.

 The fabric story of the latest Kora collection revolves around south cottons, kalamkaris, mangalgiris and mulmuls, with a wide range of colours such as blacks and reds combined elegantly with summer pastels, ochre and olive.

 Lots of tunics, drawstring pants, capris and trousers are on offer.

 Pocket pinch: The collection comes for Rs 350-plus.

 Voiceover: Kora symbolises woman ? in all her totality and this play, Upon A Yarn, was a perfect way to bring about the connection, said Prateek Raja of Kanishkas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Staff or stuff, they?re just a tag away

 - TRACKING TECHNOLOGY

 Track workers moving deep inside coal mines or tigers roaming a reserve forest. Catch a student sneaking out a rare book from the library or check when the soap rack is empty at the supermarket.

 All this through radio frequency identification (RFID), the next big thing in tracking technology with a use in a wide range of fields.

 ?Supply chain management is the primary area for RFID use right now and the US is leading in it, but once awareness grows, it won?t be restricted to any country,? said Sukumar Ghosh, a professor of The University of Iowa and chairman of Pervcom Consulting, a city-based firm working in the area.

 An RFID system consists of a transponder (or tag), which can be programmed with a unique identification number, a reader or interrogator which sends and receives radio frequencies to and from the tags and the software that works as the interface. The tiny tag embedded in an object responds to the signal from the reader to pinpoint its location.

 Passive tags, which cost as low as Rs 25-30, are able to respond to signals only, while the more expensive active tags are able to emit signals on their own.

 ?Retail giant Wal-Mart has instructed its top 100 providers to carry RFID tags in their containers, while the US defence department is implementing RFID in its shipments from January 1, 2006,? Ghosh said. Globally, the market is pegged at $800 million.

 The technology can find uses in transport and logistics, medical applications, smart home systems and more.

 In India, the use of RFID tags is currently restricted to the laboratory and a handful of pilot projects. ?That?s largely due to lack of awareness. The technology needs to become more robust as well,? explained Ghosh.

 But those who have used the technology are feeling its benefits already. The IIT Kharagpur library has tagged 5,000 of its nearly two lakh books. ?We are now able to better utilise the people at the check-in counters in other areas,? said Kamalendu Mazumdar, assistant librarian of the institution, who worked on the project.

 At IIT, a workstation allows students to check in and out books by themselves. ?Once all books are tagged, we will be able to do a stock verification in only three days,? Mazumdar said.

 Pervcom, which organised a day-long workshop on the subject last week at IIM Calcutta, is in talks with the Central Mining Research Institute for using RFID tags in the Jharkhand coal mines. ?Besides tracking workers, material and equipment can also be monitored,? S.K. Banerjee, managing director of Pervcom. 

 RFID could also be a cheaper alternative to tracking tigers than the satellite technology in use now.

 Like all developing technologies, some issues need to be ironed out in case of RFID.

 ?Where several tags are clustered together, the reader might not be able to receive a clear signal due to data collision. Privacy invasion ? where anyone with a reader can access confidential information ? is another area of concern for some people,? Ghosh added.

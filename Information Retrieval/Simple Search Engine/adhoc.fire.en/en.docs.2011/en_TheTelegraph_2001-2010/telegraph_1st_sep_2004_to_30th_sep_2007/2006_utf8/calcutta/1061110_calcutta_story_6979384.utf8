 Enchanting nature

 Perhaps influenced by Da Vincis gospel that nature is the vital source of strength and beauty in all creation, Nirmal Dutta has portrayed landscapes with passionate zeal from the very beginning of his long and illustrious artistic career. Even while depicting the virgin, pristine glory of nature in simple, visual language, his works reveal an intrinsic fascination of the artist for its magnificence, mystery and magic. Vision of Nature showcases some of his finest paintings and drawings on nature that can also be construed as a reflection of his mind. Enriching traditional techniques of representation with his distinctive, personal style, his works go beyond the realm of photographic reality to convey moods and emotions that endow them with a life of their own. Sweeping lines, a basic element of Duttas works, enable him to develop the composition and construction of his themes. Often, a combination of soft, subdued colours with unpretentious expressions helps create an ambience of delightful tranquility.

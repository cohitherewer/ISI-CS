The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The lure of the unknown

 - Calcutta beeline to tourist spots off the beaten track

 SANJAY MANDAL

 This summer, enjoy your holidays on islands like Renong in Myanmar, explore the caves at Gua Musang or a night safari at Gending, in Malaysia. People in Calcutta are going in for unknown destinations, instead of famous tourist spots.

 ?Shopping is no more a craze among tourists going abroad. They now prefer to visit remote, isolated beaches and islands,? said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India. ?These places were till now visited mainly by western tourists. Calcuttans are now showing interest in going there,? he said. Dubai, South Africa, New Zealand and even Kenya are on the popularity charts.

 The caves at Gua Musang, located in south Kelantan in Malaysia, bordering Pahang State, boast limestone formations resembling animals and cave paintings. The other archaeological caves in south Kelantan are Gua Cha and Gua Chawas in Ulu Kelantan and Gua Jaya in Kuala Jenara.

 Ethnobotany Park is a recreational and nature park administered by the Kelantan Selatan Development Authority. Situated about three km from Gua Musang town, the park covers 94 acres of lush greenery and limestone outcrops. South Kelantan is fast attracting the attention of rock climbers. The hilly terrain of Gua Musang make it a perfect spot for organising physical endurance activities.

 Another tourist site in Malaysia is the Sabah, with world-class ecological sites. Among its ecological attractions is Kinabalu Park ? Malaysia ?s first World Heritage site designated by Unesco for its vital biological sites. A dip in the Japanese-style hot baths at Poring Hot Springs is another attraction. Other resorts on A?Famosa and Langakawi islands are also attracting tourists.

 ?Last year saw a 25 per cent rise in passengers to Malaysia, Singapore and other parts of South Asia, thanks to the unveiling of these spots,? said Punjabi.

 ?Indians can now get visas on arrival in Indonesia, making things easier for tourists,? said a tourism ministry official over the phone from Delhi. ?Direct cheaper flights to these places have added to the tourism boom there,? said Sanjay Sett, managing director, Globe Forex and Travels Ltd.

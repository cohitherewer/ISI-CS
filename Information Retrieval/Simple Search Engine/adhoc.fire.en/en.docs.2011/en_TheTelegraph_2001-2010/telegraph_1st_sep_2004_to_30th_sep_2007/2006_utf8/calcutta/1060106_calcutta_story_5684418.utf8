 Born out of a fusion of forms ranging from classical and contemporary Kathak, martial arts and Western contemporary dance, Anurekha Ghoshs unique dance style is a blend of tradition and modernity that harmoniously merge to produce a powerful, evocative language of dance. Presented by Anurekha Ghosh and Company, one of the most promising dance companies in the United Kingdom, Ruins is a celebration of hope and existence, exploring the struggles of the familiar into the unknown. A story of discovery, degeneration and decay which, at the same time, arouses feelings of inspiration and nostalgia, the performance offers an exhilarating journey from old, invisible ruins to modern ruins. Using techniques of classical and contemporary Kathak, the presentation is an artistic acknowledgement of the ruins that we see around us. Treating the concept of ruins both literally and metaphorically, it includes spellbinding music, acrobatics and dynamic dance movements, punctuated with the exquisite grace of Kathak. Using jazz beats to build up a crescendo, often mixed with powerful, complex, yet subtle tabla rhythms and sensual melodies, the choreography also interprets the emotional dimension of ruins, exploring both its positive and negative connotations. Choreographed by Kumudini Lakhia, Anurekha Ghosh, Shobana Jeyasingh and Nahid Siddiqui.

 Event: A dance production of Anurekha Ghosh amp; Company, UK

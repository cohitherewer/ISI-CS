 Power snags leave mosque in the dark

 Its the middle of the month of Ramazan, and Nakhoda Masjid, on Zakaria Street, is being subjected to long hours of power cuts every day. Devotees offering prayers in the mosque have to sweat it out.

 The mosque authorities complain that their repeated pleas to the CESC for repairs have fallen on deaf ears. Since the onset of Ramazan, power failures in the mosque have been a major problem. Sometimes, there is no electricity for hours on end, says trustee Zahid Ahmed.

 Also, because of the power cuts, there is no water in the mosque and the public address system does not work. Devotees have to suffer. Despite repeated complaints, the CESC has not taken any corrective measures, Ahmed adds.

 Namaaz is offered five times every day in the mosque, and on Fridays, thousands congregate to offer prayers in the afternoon.

 According to the management, the heritage property has been subjected to regular power cuts since Shab-e-Baraat, in the second week of September, when the mosque went without electricity and water for more than 13 hours.

 We have three AC phases and a DC phase. The AC phases are used to operate the water pumps. Two of the phases have developed snags. The single phase in use can snap any time under the load. After that, we will be left with no option, says Abdul Qadir, caretaker of the mosque.

 The CESC attributed the shortage of power to limitations imposed by the state electricity board (SEB) in supplying electricity. We are facing a shortage of electricity. As a result, there is widespread load-shedding. There was a snag a few days ago in the mosque area, which was repaired by our people, said the chief public relations officer of CESC. 

 The mosque authorities claim that earlier, they would be provided with an emergency electric connection during the month of Ramazan. That practice has been discontinued. 

 Earlier, we would get an emergency connection for Ramazan. But even that was stopped three-four years ago. We approached the CESC last month with an application to resume the service but nothing has materialised till now, says Qadir.

 Religious activity at the mosque will peak with the conclusion of Ramazan and arrival of Id. Electricity failure then can act as spoilsport.

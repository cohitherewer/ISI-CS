The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I dont find Mallika sexy

 Confesses RAHUL BOSE after experiencing Pyaar Ke Side Effects with the aggressive Jatni. He also tells Pratim D. Gupta why he has never been happier 

 The beauty and 

 the beast thats what Rahul Bose calls his pairing 

 with Mallika Sherawat in Pyaar Ke Side Effects 

 You are working with another 

 first-time director. How did this one happen?

 Well, Saket (Choudhary) came to me three years back with the script of Pyaar Ke Side Effects. I found it the funniest romantic comedy I have read in my life. It was very relevant, very contemporary. Saket couldnt find a producer for the movie for quite some time. Then I finally put him with Pritish Nandy Communications.

 So what is Pyaar Ke Side 

 Effects about?

 Its a film about a couple seeing each other for three years. Finally she loses patience and pops the question: Will you marry me? The poor guy who is watching an India-Australia cricket match is completely terrified. Come on, love is one thing and marriage is something else, shocking to say the least. So, both run away and have a new boyfriend and girlfriend and parade around each other. Its really a wonderful rom com in terms of wit and humour. Also, my character confides in the audiences and takes them through all the side-effects of romance.

 Why would you agree to work 

 with someone like Mallika Sherawat?

 When I heard that Mallika would be the one, I had three concerns. One, whether she had any comic timing, because I cant act with someone without that. Two, whether she was hard working. And three, whether she would listen as a co-actor. Well, I found that she was funny, willing to learn and very co-operative. So, the role was re-tailored for her an aggressive Jatni girl, yet very romantic.

 Mallika Sherawats image has 

 become synonymous with a sexy, dumb babe. What is your take 

 on her?

 I dont find her sexy. I dont find her dumb. I find her to be an honest, straightforward, smart and uncomplicated person. She can be funny, I can tell you that. Finally, she is like any other girl. I can understand why men find her sexy. But for me sex appeal happens in the brain. And I just cant imagine feeling something like that about my co-star.

 So you feel that real-life 

 couples never work on reel?

 I believe on-screen chemistry is a fluke. The sexual chemistry that people often talk about, it just happens. You cant plan it, you cant create it. You can be very close to your co-star, yet not ooze that chemistry.

 Being a director yourself, 

 would you have cast Mallika in your film?

 I wouldnt have written a role for her. But if I found the right role, I would have cast her far away from anything people know her as.

 The USP of the film must be 

 this odd-ball pairing

 No, I feel it is the writing of the film that is quite wonderful. I am sure when couples watch the film, the girlfriends would nudge the boyfriends and tell them, Hey, thats you!

 After English August 

 and Mumbai Matinee, Pyaar Ke Side Effects is 

 the third film where you actually interact with the audiences

 I am most comfortable in being the authorial voice. See, the whole idea of this authorial voice is to confess in front of the audiences and thus get closer to them. It can be funny, it can be tragic or it can be a combination of both. 

 What other films are you looking 

 forward to?

 Rajeev Viranis Whisperers with Manoj Bajpai should release by November. I have seen the first cut and its turned out quite well. Then theres Kerala by Santosh Sivan with Nandita Das that should premiere at Cannes next year. And theres also Aniruddha Roy Chowdhurys Anuranon with Rituparna Sengupta, Raima Sen and Rajat Kapoor. Thats a lovely mix. I have never been happier.

 Buddhadeb Dasguptas Kalpurush 

 hasnt yet released

 I am really distressed about that. Kalpurush is easily the best work I have done. And despite making it to two of the four big international film festivals Toronto, Berlin, Cannes and Venice its not released commercially. 

 Whats the status with your 

 own directorial venture?

 I am writing the screenplay now. It is based on a famous novel, which is not Indian. The casting has been done but I wouldnt want to reveal it now. Its an international project with a budget of around $ 1.1 million. Five or six financiers have shown interest. It should roll by March next year. Right now, I will start shooting for Orissa-based director Manmohan Mahapatras Hindi film with Nandita Das and Shilpa Shetty.

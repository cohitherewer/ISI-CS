 Designs on exhibitions

 - Company that makes stalls stand out in a crowd

 Replicas of the pyramids and Petronas Towers for tourism promoters, coffee lounge for corporates and even a two-storeyed stall for optimum use of space? It?s all in exhibition design.

 ?Usually exhibition stalls are done up by interior designers or pandal decorators here, but exhibition design is a well-developed field in the West. The concept is slowly catching on,? said Amit Saraogi of Design Desk, a city-based company specialising in exhibition design.

 Design Desk helps exhibition stalls ?stand out from the crowd? and has worked for clients like Microsoft, CESC, Tyco Healthcare and various tourism boards.

 ?What we try to offer to clients is expert knowledge in all the aspects ? from lighting to space management? It?s also important to understand the difference between decoration and design,? Saraogi said. ?Our charges of Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 per sq m also proves to be a cost-efficient option.?

 The company was formed a few years ago by Amit, a professional interior designer, and his brother Rohit, a marketing post-graduate, as an extension of their family business of design and decoration. Only recently have the brothers shifted focus to only exhibition design.

 The target clients for Design Desk are ?brand-conscious companies? who don?t mind spending a little extra to get their products and services noticed and are serious about participating in fairs. ?Modular solutions are very popular with clients,? said Rohit, citing how their Petronas Towers model proved to be such a hit with Malaysia Tourism that they had to build one which could be taken and displayed everywhere.

 ?The idea is to design according to the requirements of the company. If a lot of products need to be displayed, then we provide more racks and shelves. If the company is taking a B2B approach, then we create space to have discussions in a relaxed setting,? Amit explained.

 Though nationally the market isn?t very big for exhibition design ? the Saraogis peg it at Rs 30 crore ? it is expected to grow significantly in the near future. Design Desk is working on a double-storeyed stall design. The ground floor is for display and those interested can be taken to the mezzanine floor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourists robbed, stranded 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A group of 50, from 15 families of Behala, left for Puri by bus on Christmas Eve to spend the festive week by the sea.

 On Tuesday, as the tourists returned to their hotel in Swargadwar after enjoying the sunrise on the beach, they found three of their 18 rooms broken into and their cash and valuables missing.

 Following a police complaint, an employee of the hotel was detained for interrogation. The tourists, now strapped for cash, have decided to cut short their holiday.

 We left for the beach before daybreak to see the sunrise. On returning to the hotel around 7 am, we were shocked to find that the locks of three of our rooms were broken and everything had been ransacked, Amal Mazumdar, one of the tourists, told Metro over the phone from Puri. The burglars had also broken the locks of the suitcases and taken away around Rs 14,000, watches and garments.

 At a loss, the group went to the hotel manager, who was allegedly reluctant to register the complaint.

 Mazumdar and his friends then turned to the police, who took up the matter and began a probe.

 Now, we cant even shift to another hotel, as we dont have enough funds. So, we have decided to cut short our trip. We will call our relatives in Calcutta to send us some money. If everything goes well, we will start for Calcutta on December 29, said Mazumdar.

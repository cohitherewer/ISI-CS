 Blast from the past

 VIBRANT GRAPHIC PRINTS ON THE WALLS, FURNITURE IN UNUSUAL SHAPES AND FUNKY ACCESSORIES COMBINE TO FORM THE RETRO LOOK. SHRADHA AGARWAL REWINDS

 Blast from the past

 Retro music, retro lounge, retro fashion, retro mood and engulfing all that, a retro-style home. Quirky, wacky, very 60s, bold and bright ? that in a nutshell is a retro home; a home that looks like a blast from the past!

 Enter chequerboard walls, lipstick red sofas, a furry wall-to-wall carpet, textured rugs and funky surprise accessories. Leaving simplicity far behind, retro is fun redefined. 

 Retro decor boasts its very own character and being personality-based, suits smaller families best, going well with private spaces, says architect and interior designer Vivek Rathore. 

 GoodLife takes you on a walk down memory lane. 

 Furniture fact

 In design, retro stresses cool geometric shapes, bright colours and pop-art graphics, says interior designer Karan Jain. 

 The furniture in a retro home follows no rules or pattern. So spot a dining table in the designated place, but dont be surprised if you come across four chairs and one bench!

 Ditto, when three different pairs of chairs are put together as a single set.

 Or an old repainted scooter in place of a staid couch.

 Retro-style furniture is a mix of modern lines and vintage designs, splashed with the brightest upholstery available, adds Karan.

 Vivek lists some basic furniture facts for a retro home:

 The bed should be anything but boring ? try a round one, maybe

 Old sofas can be reworked for a retro finish 

 Plastic chairs look cool

 Upholstery can be polka, chequered or textured. It must be vibrant

 Beanbags make easy fillers 

 Sink-in loveseats and love-lounges (seaters without a division) are common.

 Add-on appeal

 Interior consultant Meenakshi Dutta says retro elements are perfect to give your home the much-required punch.

 Even if going all retro is not your thing, then cleverly jazz up your home using retro accents. The result screams out a fresh, happy and bold statement, she says.

 Accents are by far the smoothest way to add a retro feel to any home, agrees Karan.

 The easiest way to convert a space and give it a retro look is to concentrate on a single corner or a wall and make it the point of focus in the room, explains Vivek.

 The walls, he adds, can be done up in bright colours and textures. Hollywood posters can then be used to set the perfect retro mood ? say a Marilyn Monroe or a glossy Madonna. 

 Like the furniture, there is no real discipline when it comes to adding accents in a retro home. 

 The add-ons are fun, bright and, most of all, unexpected. Here are some other typical retro accents: 

 Old-fashioned telephones and radios

 A sundial mirror instead of a clock

 Scandinavian flower vases or other deeply enamelled pieces of pottery

 Old records

 Hanging lamps

 Old black-and-white pictures in metallic or bright wooden frames.

 Shop stop

 Retro elements are most commonly dug out of treasure trunks passed down by grandparents.

 Another hot spot to source some value products, says Vivek, is an auction house. Interesting pieces at great bargains are common here.

 You might come across interesting retro products at flea markets too.

 Its flashback time, folks!

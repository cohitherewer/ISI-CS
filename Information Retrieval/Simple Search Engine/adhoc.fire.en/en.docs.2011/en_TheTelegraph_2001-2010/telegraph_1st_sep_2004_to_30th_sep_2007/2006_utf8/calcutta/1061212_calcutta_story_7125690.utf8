The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bandh hits flight path

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Debbie Jhanginai, a non-resident Indian settled in Kenya, was to have taken a Calcutta-Mumbai Jet Airways flight on December 14, with his mother and his child, and reached Pune by the end of the day. Instead, he will be spending all of Thursday indoors, in Calcutta.

 The bandh has forced us to cancel our plans. Who dare travel that day with an aged mother and young child? asked Jhanginai.

 Confusion and cancellation is the order of the day in the countdown to the 24-hour bandh on Thursday.

 Travel agents and airlines have been receiving frantic calls from passengers with one eye on the sky and the other on the ground reality of the Citu strike.

 With the airlines poised to reschedule flights and airport officials warning of major disruptions, hopes of normalcy at the Calcutta airport on Thursday have disappeared.

 There have been around 20 percent cancellations for Thursday over the past few days. Many passengers are putting their tickets on hold till the airlines confirm their operations, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).

 The Airport Authority of India Employees Union has declared non-cooperation with the authorities. None of our members will work. However, we will not stop anyone who wishes to join duty, said Dipankar Ghosh, secretary of the employees unions Calcutta branch.

 Airport officials said they were planning contingency measures to keep flights operational. We are yet to be intimated by the airlines about their plans. But emergency measures to keep the airport functional will be taken, said a senior official.

 Air Sahara has been the first to announce rescheduling. The decision has been taken and the details will be announced on Tuesday, said an official.

 We are considering the viability of operating flights, but how will passengers reach the airport? wondered the official of another airline. 

 Alka Rathi, chairperson (eastern region) of Travel Agents Association of India, said the agencies were flooded with calls from confused customers: They want to know what exactly will happen but the airlines are yet to decide on the operations on bandh day, adding to the chaos.

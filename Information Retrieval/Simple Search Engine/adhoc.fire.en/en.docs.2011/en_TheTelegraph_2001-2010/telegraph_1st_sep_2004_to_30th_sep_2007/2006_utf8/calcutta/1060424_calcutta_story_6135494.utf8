The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Second idol takes it all

 hand over: Abhijeet Sawant with Sandeep

 n The hunt is over. The agla Indian Idol is Sandeep Acharya. The grand finale of Indian Idol 2 on Saturday night saw the ever-smiling Bikaner boy edge out Hyderabadi hunk N. Karunya. Not before Abhijeet Sawant swung to Rang de basanti, Alisha Chinai grooved to Kajra re and Ishaa Koppikar rocked to Khallas.

 Kajol, of course, was the cynosure of all eyes even as Sandeep and Karunya sang the Fanaa track Chand sifarish in her honour. After the 12 Indian Idol 2 finalists came back on stage to enthrall the audience, Sandeep was finally crowned the champion.

 ?I cannot get over the fact that I am the chosen one,? screamed an ecstatic Sandeep. ?I think it will take a few days for the feeling to sink in that I am the country?s agla Indian Idol. I am very happy to see the kind of love and support that I have been getting from the entire nation, especially from Bikaner. I cannot figure out where to begin my new life from. So I am going to take each moment as it comes.?

 A Rs 1 crore contract with Sony, an album contract with Sony BMG, a brand new Baleno, Visa card worth Rs 3 lakh and an Indian Idol memento... there were no prizes for guessing who the winner of the evening was. But it?s the guitar presented by Abhijeet Sawant that Sandeep is going to treasure for some time to come.

 n She has reached 23 million people in 107 different countries. She has been in the top three for the last 10 years in the leading celebrity list drawn up by Forbes. She is a multimedia extravaganza ? a magazine, a talk show, a production company, a movie star...

 No wonder, The Fabulous Life of Oprah Winfrey will make for some great viewing, when it is aired this Wednesday, 10 pm, on VH1. While much of her life is an open book, there are many unknown facts about the lady which will be revealed on the show.

 Knowing fully well that she is seen everyday by millions of people across the globe, Oprah has world-famous fitness guru Bob Greene to personally work her out everyday. Then she pays Chicago?s leading personal chef Art Smith to cook for her all the time. And there are $ 3,500-a-week workouts at the ?ultra-exclusive, ultra-gruelling? Ashram Spa near Malibu in California. 

 Oprah?s face is the most pampered. The once-a-month $ 400 ?re-sculpting facial? takes away 10 years of her face in under two hours. How? First, her skin is zapped with a diamond-tipped microderm abrasion, then shocked with an electric current and finally tightened with an anti-ageing cocktail bubbling with enzymes, vitamins and minerals. 

 For many more such interesting nuggets, catch the show this Wednesday on VH1.

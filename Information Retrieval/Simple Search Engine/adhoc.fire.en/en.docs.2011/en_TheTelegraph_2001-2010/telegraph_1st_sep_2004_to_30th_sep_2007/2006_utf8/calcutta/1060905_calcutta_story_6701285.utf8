 If Boogie Woogie had kids dancing for glory and Sa Re Ga Ma Pa had them singing for success, a new talent-hunt show on STAR Plus has children doing everything from singing to dancing to even acting.

 What makes Rin Mera Star Superstar all the more special is the fact that it also involves the mothers of the participating kids. After a kid performs in all three rounds, his or her mother will have to make a speech to the judges and audience inviting votes for her child and his or her special talent. She also gets to challenge the other kid to ensure her childs victory.

 Sitting in as judges for this unique talent hunt will be Farida Jalal and Sachin Pilgaonkar. I think its a lovely approach because mothers can go to any extent for their children, says Farida, who has been a favourite with kids on the show Shararat. Children also feel so much more comfortable with their mothers around. So the combo is quite deadly.

 She is right. Says Tannu Kewalramani, a mother of a participant: I am willing to go to any extent to make my child win. My daughter is really fortunate to be a part of a programme like this. She is also getting to learn a lot in the whole process.

 Hosting the show will be telly star Shilpa Saklani. I guess since it is about kids, the channel thought of me because I am so popular as Gangadidi in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, she reveals. Also, I love kids and I am totally comfortable with them. It doesnt take me time to vibe with them.

 After regional rounds in major cities, the 40 finalists of the show are currently undergoing grooming with choreographer Pooja Shetty, singer Qadir Mustafa Khan and actor Alok Ulfat. Says Pooja: These kids are immensely talented but are like uncut diamonds which need to be polished. We are grooming them so that they can perform with confidence, finesse and flair to impress the judges and audiences.

 Ironically, Farida herself had been discovered, decades ago, in a talent hunt conducted by a popular film magazine. I was performing on stage when Tarachand Barjatya saw me from the audience and cast me in his new film Taqdeer, she recalls. Its quite strange that despite being seen nationally and internationally, talent-hunt winners of recent times dont get good breaks in the industry. We were unlucky we didnt have so many opportunities and kept waiting for such a long time.

 Shilpa hopes that Rin Mera Star Superstar will be able to give a new young talent to the industry from the shortlisted children aged between five and 14 years. Its unbelievable to see these kids perform, she says. They would just go up and rock the stage like Hrithik Roshan. We are not necessarily looking for someone who can dance, sing and act together. The winner can be someone who can just dance very well or sing very nicely.

 You can get to see the national finals of Rin Mera Star Superstar, on STAR Plus every Friday from 7.30 pm, starting September 8.

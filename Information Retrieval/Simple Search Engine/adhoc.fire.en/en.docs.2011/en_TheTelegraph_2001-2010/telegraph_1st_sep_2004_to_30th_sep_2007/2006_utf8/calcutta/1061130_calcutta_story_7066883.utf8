 For Calcutta designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh, grey is the new black. At Stylefile Winter Show 2006 on Saturday, the designer will present a collection in silver grey with metallic shine defining the look.

 The winter line is an evolved version of Kirans collection showcased at the Rome Fashion Week (Couture) earlier this year. The look is that of simple and stark feel of luxury, explains the designer.

 The story behind the Rome collection was women are the new men and mens wear influence was the key point of the line. The Stylefile collection carries the story forward, she adds.

 The strong metallic look is carried out through metallic embroidery, embellishments and accessories in silver and gold. The silhouettes are voluminous with boleros, leggings, churi pants and dresses dominant.

 High waists and grown-up necklines of the 80s and 90s rule the look. The designer has combined knits with georgettes, chiffons and silks.

 Another high point lies in the prints Arabesque, pinstripes and geometric inspired by the world of mosques and grills.

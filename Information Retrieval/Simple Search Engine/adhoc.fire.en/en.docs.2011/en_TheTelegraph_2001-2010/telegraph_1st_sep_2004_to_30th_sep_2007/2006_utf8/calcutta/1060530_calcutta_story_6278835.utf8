 The great divide in Rajarhat

 - Club 

 bid to upgrade facilities

 Development work has robbed Rajarhat residents of land and jobs. A Telegraph picture

 Mominur Rehman, of Karigarpara, in Patharghata village, Rajarhat, scored 683 in his Madhyamik exams last year. His father and brothers are day labourers, but the family has higher expectations from Mominur. Some kind neighbours, relatives and friends chip in to help with money for his books. His uncle, schoolteacher Abdur Rehman, gives him extra lessons. 

 But the 17-year-old may not be able to continue with his studies, since his village of Patharghata is in danger of disappearing, with the land slowly but steadily being consumed by the real estate boom in the area. Ironically, after losing land and jobs as farmers, the villagers are finding work at the nearby construction sites as labourers. But the dearth of development on their side of the divide has left them annoyed.

 The pet peeve ? ?There are major developments happening on what used to be our land, but we haven?t been adequately compensated. The plots are being sold at almost 10 times what we were paid. And we don?t even have electricity yet. A pole was put up by the government before the elections, and then forgotten. We have to wait till the next elections to get connections.?

 Stepping in to help the village is the Rotary Club of Salt Lake, with a Rs-38 lakh project to upgrade infrastructure in the area. One of the oldest Rotary clubs in the township, it started working in the village after the residents approached it for help some years ago. The club has now adopted Patharghata, which is divided into seven paras.

 A splendid banyan tree stands in the centre of Karigarpara, over a hundred years old. ?It was here before the village,? said an elderly resident. The tree has witnessed many changes, but not enough. ?This village, with a population of 4,170, doesn?t even have a proper sanitation system, which causes a lot of water-borne diseases,? explained Dr Aruna Tantia, president of the club. ?Some of the project money has been collected, from corporate houses and NRIs. But it will take a while for the entire sum to come together. We have many plans, from tubewells to healthcare units, micro-credit projects to schools.?

 But the basics have to be in place first ? there is no electricity to operate the tubewells yet; although doctor-members of the Rotary club conduct occasional check-up camps, there are no doctors in the village. 

 ?There are weavers here, but there is not enough income from that. We can do tailoring work, like the bulk orders for school uniforms that nearby villages get, but vocational training has to be provided first,? added Abdur Rehman, village coordinator and committee member for the Rotary project.

 ?Our ultimate aim is not just to alleviate poverty here, but to make these people self-sufficient,? signed off Tantia.

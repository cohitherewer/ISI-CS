The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Year of youthful and talented

 Today?s question: Which Calcuttan in your view will be the one to watch out for in 2006?

 Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,

 Barasat

 The politicians have played with the public long enough. The Calcuttan of the year would be someone who fights for the cause of human rights. Residents of the city are denied justice at every step. Mafia and musclemen, moneyed people and leaders wreak havoc with their lives. The human rights activists are always available to lend a helping hand and establish the rule of law. 

 Payal Srivastava, 

 Howrah

 I dearly want Sourav Ganguly to be the Calcuttan of 2006. He has gone through several ups and downs last year, but has managed to survive because he is a real hero and a true sportsman.

 Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 

 CIT Road

 The Calcuttan to watch out for this year is Shilajit. His songs are experimental, pro-youth and always carry a message. We will see more from this talented artist in 2006.

 Atri Bose,

 Salt Lake 

 If there is any Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006, it is Aparna Sen. She has already made some fantastic movies, and 15 Park Avenue would further consolidate her position as a director of substance. 

Amit V. Sengupta, 

 Sarat Colony

 Konkona Sen Sharma is someone with the potential to make a huge impact this year. Her performance in Mr amp; Mrs Iyer secured her position as the leading lady of off-beat cinema, while Page 3 shot her to the limelight. Critics adore Konkona and the masses admire her. What more can anyone want?

 Sohini Roy,

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue

 Sabyasachi Mukherjee will be one of the Calcuttans to watch out for in 2006. His new collection is eagerly awaited after the Nair Sisters show.

Md. Sohail,

 Mcleod Street

 Sourav is Bengal?s pride. Though he is going through a bad phase, he will be back with a bang in 2006. He has prepared well for Shoaib and Sami?s bouncers and would steal the show in the Pakistan series. 

 Samyak Nandy,

 Bangur Avenue

 The year 2006 will mark the return of Maharaj. Sourav is like a rusty engine that needs a bit of lubrication. His determination will bear fruit this year. 

 Anuradha Raza,

 Darga Road 

 The Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006 is Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Industrial growth and development, stagnating so long, has gained momentum in his regime.

 R.M. Paulmazumdar,

 Address not given

 Sourav Ganguly is the one to watch out for in 2006. No Calcuttan, nay no Indian, created such a stir among all sections of the society. The way he is coping with pressure is unique.

 Dalim Kumar Datta,

 APC Road

 I think Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is the Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006. He is a good administrator and culturally inclined person. I expect him to do something good for backward people and the senior citizens.

Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park

 Calcutta will no doubt be watching Sourav Ganguly during 2006. It will be a do-or-die situation for him after being humiliated in every way in 2005 by selectors, coach and even the media. No other cricketer in the world has ever been vilified this way. Let us hope that the great cricketer would play till World Cup 2007.

 Saadia Sitwat,

 Linton Street

 Ruprekha Banerjee will be the Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006. From being a girl next door to winning the extremely popular Fame Jodi contest, she has made the city proud. She will take the music industry by storm. 

Prahlad Agarwala,

 Nadia

 The Assembly polls would be held after a few months. Given this backdrop, the performance of both chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the Left Front headed by CPM will be keenly watched in 2006.

Sujit De,

 Sodepur

 It will be Sourav Ganguly all the way this year. His bat will show what Bengalis are capable of in the face of injustice. Sourav will again prove that a man can be defeated but he cannot be destroyed. May the fighting quality of a man have the last laugh this year.

mahasweta saha,

 Garia

 Sourav Ganguly, arguably the most talked about Indian in the latter half of 2005, would be the one to watch out for in 2006. The upcoming tour of Pakistan would be a challenging one not only for Team India but also for Sourav.

Gitanshu Naskar,

 Howrah

 Jeet has been like a breath of fresh air for the Tollygunge film industry. He has proved that he is not a one-film wonder and will go from strength to strength in 2006. 

 Satyen Biswas,

 Behala

 My person of the year is Mahasweta Devi. She will no doubt continue the good work she has been doing in 2006.

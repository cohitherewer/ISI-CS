Goodlife Show

The Sunday showers had the city all wet and waterlogged. 

But that could hardly dampen the spirits of the members of Indian Medical Association 

(IMA), Behala Branch, their friends and family. They were all there to enjoy every 

bit of the The Telegraph GoodLife Show, held in association with DNA Perfumes 

and Deodorants.

Held at IMA House, Behala branch, 13, James Long Sarani, 

the Apartainment mood of unlimited fun and masti was evident here.

The medicos, their wives and kids were more than happy 

to spend their Sunday afternoon at the event. As Dr Sanjoy Banerjee, honorary 

secretary, IMA Behala Branch, put it: We doctors have a busy schedule and 

can hardly make time for family and friends. An occasion like this is a great 

opportunity to get together, relax and enjoy ourselves.

Creativity took centre stage at the sit-and-draw competition 

that was divided into two age groups. Group A included kids in the age group of 

five to nine years and Group B had children in the age group of nine to 15 years. 

Science to scenery, the first group had 18 toddlers drawing inspiration from it 

all. As the tots were engrossed in drawing colourful scarecrows, helicopters and 

smiling balloons, the parents backed them to the fullest.

For the elder lot of 10 in Group B it was bold and 

brisk watercolour and crayon strokes depicting the rains, Taj Mahal and village 

landscapes.

In Group A, Rohinee Halder with her illustration of 

children amidst nature stood first, bagging a trophy, memento and cap. Pratyasha 

Dasgupta and Saptasish Roy, both portraying village scenes won mementos and caps. 

From Group B, Rishav Pal was crowned winner. His painting, a rainy day with flooded 

roads and a man with a vermilion umbrella, was a treat. He won a trophy, memento 

and cap. Ridhiman Lahiri and Sneha Karmakar won mementos and caps. The others 

did not leave empty-handed either, with Cadburys chocolates and TTIS 

badges being given away as consolation prizes.

The first session over, it was time for some refreshing 

beverages and finger food. Then, it was time for a quick question-and-answer round 

on The Telegraph and some medical matters. Most seemed to know their morning 

newspaper quite well (sample this: What is the full form of etc? Entertainment, 

Television and Cinema).

The doctors, of course, had a finger on the pulse 

of every medical question hurled at them. Winners won The Telegraph badges.

Next up was Three Minutes To Fame. Dance, tabla and 

keyboard renditions, songs each bettered the other in the kids section. 

The judges for the event, Dr Sunil Kr Nag and Partha Pratim Ray, evaluated presentation, 

personality and accuracy.

The singers seemed to impress the judges the most. 

Fourteen year old Sneha Karmakar who regaled audiences with Babuji dheere chalna 

walked away with a trophy, memento and cap. Rishav Pal who sang Mitwa, 

and Suroma Nag, the youngest of them all, who matched steps to Phule phule 

stood second and third, respectively. They won mementos and caps. I love 

dancing and am glad to perform here. I love the cap I won, said an excited 

Suroma, posing for snaps, cap firmly in place.

The elders decided not to be left out and were more 

than eager to participate in the Three Minutes To Fame arranged specially for 

them. The session was full of surprises as the doctors rocked with songs, spoofs 

and jokes.

Dr Sovon Karmakar, strumming the guitar, stood first. 

My daughter and wife say it was the best performance of my life, smiled 

Sovon. Dr Sushil Pal singing Yeh dil na hota bechara in trademark Dev Anand 

style stood second. Manashi Nag came in third for her singing prowess. They received 

The Telegraph badges and DNA Deodorants and Perfumes.

It was then time for the Antakshari round moderated 

by Pranam. Anthony and his band took care of the music. In between, there was 

an Uttam Kumar special quiz that was a hit with the audience. Bipasha Gangopadhyay, 

Semanti Gangopadhyay and Torsha Gangopadhyay were the Antakshari winners. They 

walked away with a Walkman each.

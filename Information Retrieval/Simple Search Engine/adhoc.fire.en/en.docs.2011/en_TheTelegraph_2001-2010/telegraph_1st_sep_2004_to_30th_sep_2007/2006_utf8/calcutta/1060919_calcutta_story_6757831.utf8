Hairdresser a person who cuts and styles your hair. 

Try this definition on this affable tress guru and he begs to differ. For Jawed 

Habib, a hairdresser is a skilled scissor-hand who knows hair science well. 

Someone who has technical know-how at the tip of his fingers. And someone who 

convinces his client to go for what suits her/him best.

The trendsetter says: Today, the hair-styling 

business in this part of the globe has been highly commercialised. Over 95 per 

cent of this segment is unorganised unhygienic conditions, inept professionals, 

and many venturing into the business for mere profit.

Realising the need in Calcutta for more and more trained 

hairdressers and the willingness of young aspirants to give this new profession 

a try, Jawed was in town on September 15 to inaugurate Jawed Habib A Professional 

Institute at 41/B NSC Bose Road (near Ashokenagar Park in Tollygunge).

Jawed Habib A Professional Institute, the training 

wing of Jawed Habib Hair and Beauty Ltd, incorporates a comprehensive curriculum 

on hair colour, cut, line, texture, movement and dimension. Students at 

the institute are subjected to a training programme comprising interactive learning, 

lectures, demonstrations, video presentations and working on live models.

Academies from Habib Inc. find place in cities like 

Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad. Four more institutes in London, Dhaka, 

Ahmedabad and Chennai are in the pipeline. Spread across India and London, New 

York and Dhaka, internationally there are 60-plus hair and beauty salons from 

the Habibs stable. By 2007 we are targeting the 200 mark, reveals 

the master stylist. 

Space constraints at the Habibs Hair Academy and Salon 

on Rashbehari Avenue was reason enough for shifting the academy to the new address 

in Tollygunge. The response to the institute at Rashbehari Avenue was very 

good but space was a major constraint there. We had to send back many applicants, 

explains Jawed.

The Rashbehari Avenue outlet is currently operating 

as an exclusive salon. The NSC Bose Road address spread spaciously over 2,250 

sq ft is divided into sections a 1,300 sq ft-plus training institute and an 

adjoining salon. Around 60 students can be accommodated at a time. 

On offer are three courses a one-and-a-half-month 

course costing Rs 20,000 on scissors practise, salon management and more. Jawed 

recommends this for those already in the profession. The three-month course for 

freshers comes for Rs 27,500. A six-month course imparting additional education 

on aspects of cosmetology is priced at Rs 50,000. There are plans for a special 

part-time 90-day evening course.

Two full-time faculty members have been deployed along 

with trained professionals at the salon. Students will also be put through practical 

sessions and participation in salon operations. Exams on a regular basis will 

keep track of a students development.

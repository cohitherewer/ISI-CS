 A brutal exploitation

 Providing a shocking exposure of the habitual wont of so-called superpower nations to exploit and abuse less developed countries, Transplant (written by Jeremy Seabrook) makes an ironical indictment of their attitude of hegemony and supremacy. In the play, a doctor, belonging to one of the Asian countries, exports a kidney belonging to a young girl, who is a victim of child abuse, to save the life of a boy, who is the citizen of a developed nation. What makes this incident all the more fallacious are the violent circumstances of its occurrence; the boy having been shot by a psychopath killer in his school. His mothers frantic search for a donor leads her to the doctor, who agrees to let her have the abused girl-childs kidney. The cast of the play includes a few experienced actors and a group of school students who are mainly novices. Audio-visual multimedia projections, and live tabla and sarangi playing in the background are the key elements to watch out for in this presentation.

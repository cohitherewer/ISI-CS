The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One word and a revolution

 A moment from Sammy! at Kala Mandir. Picture by Aranya Sen

 After Richard Attenborough?s cinematic Gandhi, Philip Glass?s operatic Satyagraha, dozens of plays and films about the Mahatma in all the Indian languages, including recent stage hits like Gandhi viruddh Gandhi, itself translated into English as Mahatma versus Gandhi, why would anyone write another drama on him? Simple: his life is inspirational and inexhaustible.

 Prime Time Theatre?s Sammy!, brought to Calcutta by Sangit Kala Mandir, proved a very moving experience. The fourth play by Partap Sharma ? whose angry debut, A Touch of Brightness, was banned in 1967 ? it takes us on a whirlwind trip through Gandhi?s career from South Africa to India.

 After a disposable prelude in which the actors unnecessarily justify their multiple roles, the drama begins with the infamous ?Sammy? episode, when South African racists pummelled Gandhi and hurled that slur at him, an abuse derived from the fact that many indentured labourers came from south India with names ending in ?Swamy?.

 The subtitle, ?A word that broke an empire?, is of course pure hyperbole, because the demise of the British Empire surely cannot be traced to one word. It is one of the few false steps in an otherwise carefully selected narrative. Any retelling of Gandhi?s story will always raise disagreements about significant incidents that should have been included. But it must ultimately be judged by the integrity of its purpose and originality of its insight. On both counts, Sammy! scores.

 The simplicity of its action and dialogue both looks and sounds true to the Mahatma?s spirit. And dramaturgically, it is new in Gandhiana because it gives central space to Gandhi?s inner voice ? a presence seen and heard only by him, who guides him to all his crucial decisions after debating them with him. This internal dialectic presents to us a troubled man often caught in two minds.

 Lillete Dubey?s direction is suitably transparent and straightforward, allowing the lines to speak for themselves and the man to emerge without any spectacle to distract us. In the lead, Joy Sen Gupta gives probably his best performance to date, not only showing the physical change wrought by age, but also keeping intact the impish sense of humour that never left Gandhi. Ravi Dubey embodies the Mahatma?s conscience, personified as an unchanging senior mentor figure; but shouldn?t he wear wooden rather than leather sandals? Neha Dubey portrays Kasturba effectively as an equal and sometimes critical partner.

 Among the supporting cast, Denzil Smith stands out as the flummoxed Viceroy whereas Zafar Karachiwala, mainly because of the sameness of his voice, has the most trouble differentiating characters, so that his Smuts and Nehru talk quite alike! Asif Ali Beg, Anuradha Menon and Vikrant Chaturvedi share 15 other parts with aplomb.

 In the final analysis, Gandhi?s sheer sincerity, idealism, altruism and incorruptibility shine through in Sammy!, explaining the magnetism that attracted millions. This phenomenal mass appeal, contrasted with the utter lack of credibility in Indian politicians just 50 years on, has inspired audiences to accord this production standing ovations across the country.

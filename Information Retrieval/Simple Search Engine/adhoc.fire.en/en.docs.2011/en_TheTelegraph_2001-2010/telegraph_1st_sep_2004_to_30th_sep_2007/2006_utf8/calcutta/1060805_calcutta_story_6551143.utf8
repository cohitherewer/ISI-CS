 Clear clutter to move ahead

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Storeroom rule :according to Feng Shui, a mirror in the storeroom effectively doubles the clutter and this drags you behind and restricts your movement in life. Also, almirahs in the storeroom should not be cluttered with heavy household objects, especially if the storeroom is located in the eastern sector of the house. The doors of these cupboards can be adorned with soothing pictures of landscapes to create an illusion of fresh, rising energy

Q: I have a storeroom in the east of the house. It has built-in almirahs on the northern, eastern and western walls. These are stuffed with household objects and have suitcases piled on top. I am in a dilemma as there is no more space left to store extra stuff. The entry to the storeroom is from the south-west corner and there is a huge mirror on the southern wall that reflects the almirahs. Shall I remove the mirror and build another almirah in its place?

 Geetanjali

 The solution: East is the area associated with the rising energy of a new day and this brings new opportunities in life. Windows are recommended in this area so that positive energy can flow into the house. Having a storeroom that is enclosed from all the four sides deprives you of vital Chi.

 Lighten the load of this room by giving away objects that you do not require. Take a decision that before bringing in any one new item into this area, you will get rid of some unwanted stuff. 

 Do not unnecessarily clutter the area that not only occupies such valuable space in the house, but also occupies your mind. The clutter here will always drag you behind and restrict your movement in life. 

 Again, a mirror in the storeroom will expand the energy and effectively double the clutter, thus making things worse. 

 Remove the mirror from the southern wall and build a new almirah, but keep the northern and eastern cupboards light, neat, clean and well-organised.

 Do not store heavy household objects in these cupboards. Paint whatever little is visible of the walls in light shades of green and put up beautiful nature pictures like landscapes on the doors of the almirahs to create an illusion of fresh rising energy of the east.

 Career call

 Q: I was born on 08.05.1986. I have passed the Higher Secondary examination in Arts. Now I want to go for a professional course on management, media or communication. I would like to know which career option would be right for me.

 Brajesh

 The solution: Your pillars of destiny reveal that you have three elements of water as your own element. Strong water elements should make you a very good communicator and hence you should excel in professions like media, communication and marketing. 

 Take plenty of support from the metal element in its actual form and its associated colours like white and grey. Always study facing your most auspicious direction, which is north-east. From the year 2010, you will enjoy a high status in life and you will be stepping up the ladder for the next six years.

 Trade talk

 Q: I am a regular reader of your column and am very interested in following the principles of Feng Shui to improve my life. I was born on 02. 05.1971 at 6.50 pm and would like to know my kua number and favourable directions. I am in the business of trading in coal and natural rubber. I want to know my immediate future in the business. Please help me as I aspire to achieve much more.

 Ravi Khetawat

 The solution: Your birth data when converted into five elements reveal that you are a strong fire person and will do well in business that is connected with earth, metal and water. Earth related business is real estate, coal, stone, marble, granite or anything that is found from the earth.

 Metal element suggests business associated with a metal of any kind and water gets you linked with trading, export and import of goods.

 You are under the influence of your favourable earth element from the year 2000 and will continue to be in it for next 15 years. This element gives expansion in business and is supported by the water element that will help you to achieve a lot and gain status in your business. Your kua number is 2 and your favourable directions are north-east, west, north-west and south-west, in order of preference.

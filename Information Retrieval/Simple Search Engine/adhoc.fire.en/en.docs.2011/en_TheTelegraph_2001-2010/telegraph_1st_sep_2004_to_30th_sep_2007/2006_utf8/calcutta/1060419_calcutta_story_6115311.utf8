 College body poll in three months 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday appointed S.P. Roy Chowdhury, an advocate of the court, a special officer and directed him to complete the election of the governing body of Jogamaya Devi College within three months.

 The division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutt also appointed two other lawyers of the court to assist Roy Chowdhury in conducting the election.

 The election to the college governing body was held in 2002. But trouble started in the college after the governing body suspended Gargi Nath, principal, in 2004 on charges of financial irregularities.

 Nath moved the high court and the single-judge bench of the court issued a stay order on the proceedings drawn against the principal by the governing body. Challenging the validity of the single bench?s order, nine members of the governing body in 2004-end moved an appeal before the division bench of Justice Ganguly and Justice Dutt.

 The division bench ordered teacher-in-charge Indrani Mukherjee and the principal to jointly run the college. The bench restrained the principal from taking any policy decision without the governing body?s prior approval.

 Since then, there has been a continuous tussle between the principal and the governing body, as a result of which, the students have suffered. 

 Some outgoing students found it difficult to fill up their examination forms as both Mukherjee and Nath were unwilling to sign these, and both their signatures were needed. The university appointed Bharati Roy, its former vice-chancellor, administrator of the college.

 But the governing body members were not happy with the principal?s actions and alleged that she, aided by some senate members, was trying to grab control of the collage.

 They also alleged before the court that after the death of governing body president Ashokendu Roy, the principal, with the university authorities? help, had announced that Subrata Gupta, a professor, would act as president of the governing body. They also alleged that in spite of repeated appeals, the principal, who was also ex-officio secretary to the president of body, was not holding the election.

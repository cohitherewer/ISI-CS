 Water flows, not funds

 - Muncipalities owe Rs 1000 crore to supply agency

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY 

 Mounting arrears have caused a severe cash crunch in the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA).

 The government agency, a sister concern of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), owes about Rs 1,000 crore from municipalities, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), for water supply over the past two decades. The CMWSA employees are planning an agitation to recover the dues. 

 We are continuing our dialogue with the municipalities concerned to make them clear the arrears, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 The CMWSA and CMDA staff have made several representations to municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya over the non-payment of dues.

 All our efforts have proved futile. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya promised to clear the dues but has done nothing in the two-and-a-half years he has been in power. We have decided to resort to a greater movement if the government fails to take steps, said general secretary of Development Employees Joint Action Committee P.B. Nag.

 According to an official estimate, the CMWSA supplies 75 million gallon of water per day to the CMC from its Garden Reach Water Treatment Plant. The monthly bill for the supply is Rs 3.5 crore. 

 The treatment plant also caters to the Mahestala and Budge Budge municipalities.

 In addition, the CMWSA supplies water to the Serampore, Bhadreswar, Rishra, Uttarpara, Kotrang and Baidyabati municipalities, in Hooghly, from the Padmapukur water reservoir in Serampore. The bill comes to nearly Rs 8 crore per year.

 The non-payment of the bills has made it difficult for the CMWSA to meet its yearly expenditure of Rs 1 crore on electricity and Rs 2.25 crore on the salary of employees. 

 When the Kalighat booster pumping station was started in 2004 to supply drinking water in south Calcutta, the CMC had agreed to clear the money it owed to the CMWSA at the rate of 5 per cent per month and also foot the additional monthly bill of Rs 3.5 crore. But they did not keep their promise, claimed Nag. 

 The CMC earns money by supplying water to commercial establishments. It is also planning to impose area-wise water tax. 

 But they are not paying a single paisa to the CMWSA. How long can this go on? asked an employee of the CMWSA.

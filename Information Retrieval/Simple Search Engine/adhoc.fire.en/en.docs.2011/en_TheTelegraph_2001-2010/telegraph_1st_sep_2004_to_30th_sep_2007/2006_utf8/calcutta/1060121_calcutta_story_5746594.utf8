 Query on entry fee

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The high court on Friday expressed its displeasure over the army?s role in not allowing the state to open Eden Gardens and introduce an entry fee.

 ?The park should be opened at the earliest. The Supreme Court has allowed Victoria Memorial to levy an entry fee. The army has allowed a private party to collect fees from visitors at another park. Then, why is the state being prevented from introducing an entry fee at Eden Gardens?? the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly wondered.

 The bench was hearing a petition by environment activist Subhas Dutta.

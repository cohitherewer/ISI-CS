 Safety valve for students

 - Stress-buster steps in schools to combat exam pressure

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With students taking the plunge into the deep end of the examination pool in the coming days, the authorities for the first time are putting safety nets in place.

 Alarmed by the rising graph of suicide attempts by students under examination pressure, several schools and examination boards have decided to take necessary measures to help students cope better with stress. For some, the counselling has already begun in the exam countdown while for others counsellors and doctors are being posted at the venues to soothe the nerves of students on the edge.

 The Madhyamik examinations conducted by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education gets underway on February 24, while the ICSE, ISC and CBSE examinations begin next week.

 A record number of nearly 7,64,232 examinees will appear for Madhyamik 2006.

 At least a dozen suicides by students during school-leaving exams and after publication of results were reported last year.

 ?We had a series of meetings with state health department officials. They have promised to provide us adequate number of doctors and counsellors during the exam days. If we notice any examinee unable to write because of nervousness, we will immediately consult experts in the field. They will do the needful so that the child is able to complete the paper,? assured Board president Ujwal Basu.

 ICSE and CBSE schools, meanwhile, said they had already started the process of counselling every student showing symptoms of examination-related stress.

 Among the things being told to examinees repeatedly are:

 In order to ease the pressure, CBSE will allow 15 minutes extra time to students to read the question papers thoroughly before starting to write.

 ?We are taking all possible steps to ensure that the students write the papers in peace,? said Mukta Nain, principal of Birla High School, which falls under CBSE.

 Gilian Rosemary Hart, principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and a member of the executive committee of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), said counselling examinees ? particularly those suffering from examination phobia ? had been organised.

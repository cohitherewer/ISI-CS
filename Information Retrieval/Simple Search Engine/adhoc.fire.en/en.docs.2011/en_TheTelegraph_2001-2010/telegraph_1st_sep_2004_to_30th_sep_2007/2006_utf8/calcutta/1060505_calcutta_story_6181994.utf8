 Band helps doctors unwind, connect

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The Byatikromi line-up

 What does a group of senior doctors do to build better relations with patients and unwind in the process? Make music, in a band.

 Byatikromi, comprising doctors Tapas Roychowdhury, Shivaji Basu, Vivek Dutta, Raja Roy and Pallab Bannerjee, will be taking the CC amp;FC stage this Saturday for a concert of Rabindrasangeet and timeless Bengali tunes. 

 But that will not be their debut. The band already has several live performances ? including one in Bangladesh ? and an album, to its credit.

 ?Byatikromi was formed in February 2005. Some of us know each other since school, while others through the profession,? said Dr Tapas Roychowdhury, a cardiac surgeon.

 It was Samolay, a cultural body that organises programmes with people from the two Bengals, which learnt of the doctors? musical interest and planned a show with them. 

 ?The programme was attended by doctors from Bangladesh who were interested in a collaboration project. In September 2005, we recorded an album called Khela Bhangar Khela with them,? recalled Roychowdhury. 

 Byatikromi travelled to Bangladesh for the album?s release and a show, proceeds from both going to charity.

 Now, the group is ready with an album of Rabindrasangeet, scheduled for release in the city shortly.

 ?Besides relaxation, the band helps us build a relationship with patients. Particularly at live shows, where we get a good vibe from them,? offered Shivaji Basu, a urologist.

 But the best response has been from artistes and musicians. ?Be it Soumitra Chatterjee or Haimanti Shukla or Indranil Sen, who offered us the use of his studio, they have encouraged us a lot,? added Roychowdhury.

 The band now sings to music tracks recorded by professional musicians. ?But we have plans to compose some numbers by ourselves,? said Roychowdhury.

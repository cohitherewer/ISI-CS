 Those yearning for a taste of theatre from beyond Bengal are in for a treat. The 23rd National Theatre Festival presented by Nandikar will showcase some of the most well-known names from across the country the likes of B.V. Karanth, Girish Karnad, Prasanna and Mahesh Elkunchwar.

 The fest, from December 16 to 25 at Academy of Fine Arts, presents 27 plays of which as many as 17 are from outside the state. The festival is dedicated to the memory of Tapas Sen. We will have a huge exposition of photographs and a light-and-sound show developed by Khaled Chowdhury, whom we will also felicitate. Our focus is on childrens plays, of which we have quite a few, not only by our newly-formed ensemble but also by foreign troupes, says Nandikar director Rudraprasad Sengupta.

 A day, December 17, has been dedicated to childrens plays. Among the 14 childrens or child-friendly plays, the two English productions are by Teater Pero from Sweden. Orjan has been part of our festival before; I found it exceptional, says actor-director Goutam Haldar.

 While Orjan is the tale of a huge golden eagle that needs the help of a small wren to overcome its fear of heights, The Man, The Lady and Something in the Belly is about a couple struggling to find social acceptance for their offspring, a monkey. Hilarious situations arise as they try to avoid attention by hiding it in a pram. But as they discover that the child is part of their body and soul, they begin to gradually find it beautiful and loveable, explains Sengupta.

 The plays from outside Bengal are new to Calcutta, he claimed. Girish Karnads Bikhre Bimb is about a writer haunted by the idea that by writing in English and addressing a global audience she has betrayed her own language and identity. If director Prasannas Uttararamcharith is about Rama after the Lanka war, Gokula Nirgamana (Kannada), directed by B.V. Karanth, focuses on Krishnas departure to Mathura leaving Radha behind.

 Other highlights will be the Marathi play Wada by Mahesh Elkunchwar, directed by Chetan Datar on three generations of a landlords family. Badal Sircars And Indrajeet will be presented by Kalashray, Mumbai, and Poshak written and directed by Tripurari Sharma by NSD Repertory Co.

 Wapsi, directed by Hari Prakash, is about strained parent-child relationships and so is the Devendra Raj Ankur-directed Sankramana from Delhi. Hidden Fires, a Manjula Padmanabhan play directed by Arvid Gaur, is about intolerance and violence.

 Jawans to check poaching 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The forest department has joined hands with Border Security Force (BSF) to check cross-border wildlife crime.

 A three-day workshop is being conducted by the forest department in Kalyani, Krishnagar and Behrampore to train BSF personnel in fighting the crime.

 The workshops are being conducted by Rathin Banerjee, deputy conservator, Nadia, and V.K. Yadav, chief wildlife warden, Calcutta. Similar workshops will be conducted in Malda and a few other places across the state.

 In the past few years, we have recovered a large numbers of exotic birds and animal skin from the border areas. But it was just a fraction of the total deals going on across the border. Therefore, we need to sensitise the border personnel, so that these areas are free from wildlife crime, said Somesh Goel, inspector-general of BSF.

 Owing to various limitations, such as inadequate manpower to keep a tab on poachers, the forest department has to depend largely on customs officials, coast guards, railway police and the security force, a forest department official admitted. But the jawans should be briefed about the wildlife laws and about the endangered species, Yadav said on Tuesday.

Life

 Mountain melody

 A musician from Manchester falls 

 in love with a small Himalayan village and decides to stay 

 back. Seeing that there isnt a Woodstock or Glastonbury 

 in India, he decides to set up a music festival himself, 

 with a little help from friends and musicians.

 That, very briefly, is the story 

 of Andy Baines and the Dhanaulti Rocks music festival. Back 

 from the sound feast at the foot of the Himalayas, city 

 band Cassinnis Division has a few stories to tell 

 ? about the festival and the man behind it.

 It was simply an amazing experience. The journey to Dhanaulti was awesome and so was playing at the fest, says Rahul Guha Roy, frontman of Cassinnis Division, which headlined Day I of the three-day event held in the first week of June. This was the second edition of the festival. The pilot was in November last year.

 Dhanaulti is a stop-off point on the Mussoorie-Chamba road, slowly becoming popular as a tourist spot. The tourist population includes lots of foreigners. That and the young crowd from the schools nearby make it an ideal location for a music festival, offers Rahul.

 Genre is no bar at Dhanaulti Rocks, so this years performer list included singer-songwriters, Indian classical musicians and alternative rock bands like Cassinnis Division.

 It was clear that the crowd was there for the music rather than to be seen in the right place. The bands were also completely at ease playing their own music as they were not competing against each other, Rahul observes.

 Music lovers had the option of staying on the premises in tents (Woodstock style!) or hire a hotel nearby.

 And the man behind the event? Andy is doing a great job, but corporate sponsorship is needed to take the festival forward, feels Rahul. The current source of funds for Dhanaulti Rocks are Andijis Evolving Caf?, an eatery run by Baines, the money received from renting the tents (Rs 1,000 each), and contributions from the bands themselves.

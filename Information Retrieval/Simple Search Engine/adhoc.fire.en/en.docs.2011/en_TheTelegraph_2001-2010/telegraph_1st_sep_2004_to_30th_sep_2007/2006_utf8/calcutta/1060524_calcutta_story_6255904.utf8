 Dogsbody to officer-in-charge

 - How 

 perseverance paid 

 Pathik Chandra Haldar: True grit. Picture by Pabitra Das

 As Pathik Chandra Haldar makes himself comfortable in the chair reserved for the officer-in-charge of Hastings police station, he cannot help thinking about the time when his job, as a police constable, was to guard a superior officer?s bungalow and cook for him as well. A job that he hated. 

 From there, Haldar has come a long way. Even if it took him three decades. 

 In 1977, he had joined as a constable after passing his Higher Secondary, but his job profile required him to be the general dogsbody. His duties included running errands for superior officers. It was a life that did not look promising enough and Haldar vowed to pull himself up by the straps of his pair of soiled police boots. He decided to study further. 

 Life became tougher. Finding time to study was difficult. But he kept at it ? and passed his BA exam as a private candidate. Then he took the examination for the post of sub-inspector ? and cleared that, too. 

 ?I cannot forget those days of drudgery. But fed up with that life, I planned to prepare myself for the BA exam as a private candidate,? reminisces Haldar.

 ?After returning from office, I used to study for three hours every day. I passed my BA and sat for the written examination for the post of sub-inspector. The hard work paid off, and I cleared the exam in 1979,? he adds, a hint of emotion in his voice.

 That year, after clearing the sub-inspector?s exam, he was sent off to the Barrackpore police training college. And he remained a sub-inspector ? till he was promoted to the rank of inspector three years ago. 

 He doesn?t regret the long wait. Rather, he loves the fact that he is a role model for his subordinates and a source of envy for his batchmates.

 ?At times, I can?t believe my luck. After passing my Higher Secondary, I joined as a constable since I had to support my family. Finally, the dream came true and I thank God for what I am today,? Haldar says. 

 Yet, Halder remains a simple man with simple tastes. ?Things have not changed much. When I was a constable, I used to have tea with nimki. I still have it,? he smiles.

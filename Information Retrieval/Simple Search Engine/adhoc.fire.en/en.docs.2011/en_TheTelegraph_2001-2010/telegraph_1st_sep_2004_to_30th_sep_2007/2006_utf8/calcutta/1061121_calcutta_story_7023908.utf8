 Poverty moves dancer Pina

 - Revolutionary choreographer on her nascent India piece

 When Pina Bausch had first visited Calcutta way back in 1979 with her production of Stravinskys Rites of Spring, the Left Front government had already come to power and the comrades were none too happy with the idea of a nude dancer onstage. 

 The Democratic Youth Federation, of which Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was leader then, forced Bauschs company, Wuppertal Tanztheater, to stop the show.

 Bausch had returned in 1994 with Carnation and that kinetic spectacle had generated enough electricity to be still remembered. It was a startling assemblage of the brutal, beautiful and the ridiculous. 

 When Martin Waelde, director of Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB), on Friday introduced the revolutionary dancer-choreographer, he made a brief reference to that unfortunate fracas in 1979. But he readily explained that things were different now. Bausch was in town on MMBs invitation along with her troupe to collect material for her collaborative India piece last week.

 Bausch was without her trademark Camels. Her face, stark and bare, bore the marks of time. She was ill, but on occasions, she smiled brilliantly. Or she turned Sphinx.

 The night before, her young dancers had said that in Wuppertal, where they work 10 hours daily, she can be relentless. But she can also be tender, like a mother, said a Spanish troupe member.

 She may have once said: I love to dance because I was scared to speak, but Bausch unhesitatingly declared: So many poor people. How do they live? How is it possible? placing both her expressive hands on her chest. 

 She was moved by the beautiful family life but was taken aback that although some of those huge houses with their beautiful architecture (they had gone on a trip to the flower market near Howrah bridge) were neat and clean inside, nobody cares for the streets.

 The India piece is still in a nascent stage, although she has been discussing it with MMB since 2002. There is no picture yet. I can feel what it is going to be. It is very, very open. It is a long process. We will pick a few things. But we are still very nave. Like children, she said, sounding weary. 

 Her head and heart are full of impressions of everyday life. I will pick certain things from reality. Little details. It is difficult to explain. I will keep doors open. Known for linking dichotomous elements, Bausch said: There are so many different things. Opposite things. Very painful.

 She had earlier interacted with Chandralekha, but Indian dance movements will be used without copying them, at an abstract level. The piece will be premiered in Wuppertal on May 18 next year. In January 2008, the ensemble of about 35 members will present it in the Indian metros.

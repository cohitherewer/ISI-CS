 Heres the party tonight

 IF YOU HAD A CLUB BLAST LAST NIGHT, TAKE IT EASY BY CELEBRATING AT HOME WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. GOODLIFE GIVES YOU THE RECIPE FOR A YULETIDE DO 

 Music mix 

 No, we arent going to suggest you play Last Christmas! There is more to Xmas tunes. But this year, do give it up for retro. Lots of 80s and lots of rock--roll.

 Its time to sit back and not lounge, but just moderately relax. Open the evening with some good ol English numbers, move on to hip-hop and house and if you havent had your fill of Bolly beats last night, then make up tonight.

 DJ Girish from Shisha picks what your Christmas CD pack must carry. 

 Bebot

 Sexy back

 Love dont let me go

 Kya mujhe pyar hai

 Sip bite

 If Christmas Eve spells indulgence, then December 25 should be dedicated to taking it easy. Keep cooking minimal and utilise those leftovers from last night.

 Bunty Sethi of Venom suggests you serve snacky titbits. Everyone wants to go easy on the stomach so restrict the menu to a melange of all-time favourite finger food ideas.

 Choose from open sandwiches, tossed sausages, momos, pita bread, kebabs or even kathi rolls. No compromise on the sweet tooth, though. The platter should be tempting and traditional Xmas pudding, Christmas cake, the works. 

 The bar should be kept fuss-free too because many guests will be nursing a hangover from the big night.

 A great winner will be a wine cocktail. Buntys recipe: Combine red wine with orange juice and throw in peach chunks or strawberry bits. Refrigerate and garnish with an orange segment. Add cognac or rum to raise the alcohol content. 

 Fashion facts 

 Winter is one of the best times of the year to get all dressed up and party. Theres no stress about those not-so-perfect bodies (thank god for the wraps and layers that go with the December degrees), just pile em on and bring it on, the style statement that is.

 For the big Christmas night, women can don a nice dress to up their oomph effect. The dress length should graze the knees and a balloon hemline will look super sexy. 

 Stick to the jacket-denims combo if youre the safely-stylish sort. Yes, do throw in a gold clutch and good earrings or a flashy neckpiece. Whats a Christmas party with no bling! 

 The men can slip on a pair of dark corduroys with a cool shirt. And please dont ditch the jacket bonus Brownie points to help a (or make that any) damsel in a degree of distress.

 And yes, while we are at a Christmas party, a dash of red and green and white would be nice. 

 Decor drama 

 Make up for the missing red-green-white from your style statements and go all out with the decor. Bring home the festive cheer and spruce up the spirit with a display of anything and everything even remotely related to Christmas.

 A larger-than-life Christmas tree in a focal corner of your home (entrance to the hall or inside the den), and many more smaller ones all over the place to raise the festive fever just right. 

 Do up the tree for a traditional decor drama stars, bells, candy, angels, Santa faces and surprise gifts for friends and family, ribbon-packed of course. 

 Scented candles and a free hand with the snow spray should take care of the rest of ambience and mood.

 And yes, dont forget to hang up rows and rows of mistletoe. Lest couples fighting shy need a perk-up push!

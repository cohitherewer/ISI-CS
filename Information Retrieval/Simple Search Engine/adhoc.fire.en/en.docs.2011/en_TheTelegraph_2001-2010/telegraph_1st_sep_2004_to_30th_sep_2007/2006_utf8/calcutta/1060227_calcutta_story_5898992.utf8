 Excavation to reclaim wetlands 

 Rahul Roy: What about the thousands of people who had purchased plots on the East Calcutta Wetlands 15 to 20 years ago?

 The Left Front government is well aware of the problem. However, it is not possible for the land and land reforms department to allow conversion of these plots.

 The proposed wetlands reserve has three divisions ? core area, inner buffer zone and outer buffer zone. Nothing can be done for those whose plots are within the core area or the inner buffer zone. The proposed wetlands bill will be placed in the Assembly on March 8 or 9. A scheme has already been drawn up to excavate those bheris which were detected during the aerial survey, but have now been filled up.

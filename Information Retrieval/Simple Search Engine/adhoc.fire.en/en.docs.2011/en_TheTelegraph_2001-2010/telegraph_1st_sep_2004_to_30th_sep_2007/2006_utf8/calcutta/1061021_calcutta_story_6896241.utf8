 Merciful justice

 A tale of love, loyalty, law and intellect, the Bengali adaptation of William Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice is liberally interspersed with moments of fun and laughter, promising to provide wholesome entertainment to audience of all ages. Antonio, a merchant, borrows 3000 ducats from Shylock, a Jew, to help his friend Bassanio. Bassanio needs the money to marry Portia, a rich, beautiful heiress. Shylock lends the money to Antonio on condition that if he fails to pay back on time, Antonio would allow Shylock to cut off a pound of flesh nearest to his heart. Bassanio wins Portias hand and weds her, but the celebration is cut short by the news that Antonio has lost his ships at sea, and forfeited his bond with Shylock. Meanwhile, Shylocks daughter Jessica runs away with Lorenzo, a Christian. When Antonios life is at stake, Portia, along with her chambermaid, Nerissa, turn the tables on Shylock in a dramatic court scene. Antonios life is saved and Shylock is compelled by law to convert to Christianity and bequeath his estate to Lorenzo and Jessica. Direction: Prof Prasanta Kumar Ghosh.

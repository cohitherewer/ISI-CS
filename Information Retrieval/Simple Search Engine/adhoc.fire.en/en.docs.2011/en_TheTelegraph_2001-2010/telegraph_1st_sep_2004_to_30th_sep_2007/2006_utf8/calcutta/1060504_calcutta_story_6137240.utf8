 As part of the inaugural celebrations, four new collections ? The Royal Romance, Maharani Collection, Floral Beauties and Expression La Exquisite ? were unveiled. 

 The Royal Romance line of diamond jewellery includes bezel, prong and pressure settings along with the normal pave, flush and channel settings. The collection is marked by a western elegance with touches of Oriental flair.

 Maharani Collection is an assortment of gold jewellery. Contemporary patterns have been combined with traditional temple designs and Mughal art to form eye-catching pieces.

 Floral Beauties in gold emphasises 

 nature illustrations, while Expression La Exquisite has 

 diamonds combined with peridots, citrines, tourmalines, 

 tanzanite and more for a very western appeal.

 Voiceover:The showroom is an effort to reach out to our customers in this part of the city, said director of BC Sen Jewellers, Subir Kumar Sen.

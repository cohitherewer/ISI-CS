The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Death trap by day amp; night

 - Metro revisits Bondel bridge the night after the mishap...

 No proper street lights, only a few halogen lamps hanging 

 from traffic instruction poles 

 Motorists and motorcyclists ? like Debabrata, 24, and Maumau, 23, who lost their lives here on Monday night ? are at the mercy of a few small halogen lights hanging precariously, along with the wires, from the poles. These halogen lamps, used in marriages and para functions, are hopelessly inadequate in illuminating the 560-m bridge.

 PWDspeak: ?Work on lighting is always undertaken at the last stage. Though the CMDA had prepared a programme schedule and completed tender documents, work could not be started due to elections being announced. Some temporary lighting has been arranged for commuters. Work will be resumed after the poll process is over? ? minister Amar Chowdhury.

 Road surface uneven, no warning for motorists.

 The surface is bumpy in patches, posing a threat to speeding vehicles, particularly after sundown. The bridge has clearly been thrown open without the final coat of bitumen. The two young men on the motorcycle on Monday night had ?hit something? on this stretch and been flung against the railings, causing their death.

 PWDspeak: ?The road surfacing has not been completed. We will not pay the contractor till we ensure a smooth road surface. We hope the work will be complete in a month? ? minister Chowdhury.

 Pavement starts from the Tiljala Road side and ends abruptly 

 in the middle of the bridge. Also, pavement has gaps between 

 the concrete slabs and protruding hooks

 Inexplicably, the bridge has half a footpath. There are no high railings where the pavement ends. The pavement is perilous, with gaps large enough for the foot to go in, between concrete slabs. It?s a death trap in the dark, with iron hooks standing out.

 PWDspeak: ?This has come to our notice. We have asked the engineers to inspect the pavements and do the needful? ? minister Chowdhury.

 At the Rifle Range Road end, there?s no traffic signage 

 or signals

 There are three channels for vehicles, coming from the opposite direction, on the Rifle Range side of the bridge. 

 In the absence of traffic signage, vehicles are not sure which channel will take them where. 

 Confusion can lead to collision, especially after dark, with no traffic signals to prevent a pile-up .

 PWDspeak: ?We have plans to set up an automatic traffic signalling system and signages, in consultation with the traffic police. Again, tenders for the lighting and signage systems could not be floated because of the elections? ? minister Chowdhury.

 Fashion 

 Week Mumbai

 Outfits from the Design 

 Toor collection by Deepti Toor and R amp;B Enterprises

 If you thought our citys increasing visibility at 

 international fashion weeks was the only Calcutta connection 

 with global fashion, its time you did a rethink. R amp;B 

 Enterprises, a city-based fashion export house, has been 

 doing much more than that for over a decade now. 

 Set up in 1996 by brothers Swarup 

 and Arup Ghosh, R amp;B has been lending design inputs to 

 global fashion giants like Kenzo, Giorgio Armani, Isabel 

 Marrant and many more.

 We started with developing 

 textiles and for a long time we were designing fabrics for 

 foreign labels. Slowly, we also started designing garments 

 and now we supply complete garment collections as well as 

 fabrics, explains Swarup.

 The company now reaches out to 

 foreign fashion houses through 14 international agents in 

 various countries. 

 After gaining a firm foothold 

 in fashion the world over, R amp;B is now all set to venture 

 into a new territory, an area that remains largely unexplored 

 in the Indian design industry. The fashion house intends 

 to promote fresh talent by launching labels for young designers 

 under its umbrella. We have been working closely with 

 big international brands for so long. Now, we will provide 

 our knowledge and expertise to young designers and help 

 build brands. We want to have many such brands under our 

 umbrella, said Swarup.

 And the fashion house has already 

 taken the first solid step towards realising the big dream. 

 The forthcoming Lakme Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2007 in 

 Mumbai will see the launch of Design Toor by R amp;B Enterprises 

 International Pvt Ltd, a label by Haryana girl Deepti Toor, 

 from the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. 

 Deepti was one of the designers 

 who showed at the GeNext show at LFW in April. We had seen 

 her work and liked it and so we decided to present her label 

 under our banner, shared Swarup.

 Right from design specifications 

 to production and manufacturing, everything has been taken 

 care of by R amp;B, while Deepti has been the creative mind 

 behind the collection, in association with the companys 

 design team. 

 The pret collection is inspired 

 by Mughal miniature paintings that find reflection in the 

 details, surface ornamentation and colours. The look, still, 

 is minimal and stark in its simplicity. 

 The silhouettes are international 

 limited to knee-length dresses, skirts and tops. The colours 

 are muted whites, beiges, tussore, dull pinks

 The fabric story is interesting. 

 We havent used any georgettes or chiffons in 

 the collection. We have developed four-five kinds of fabrics, 

 mostly matka silks, cottons and cotton blends, all 

 Bengal handlooms. The idea was to keep the made in 

 Bengal feel in the collection, though its in 

 sync with international trends, explained Swarup.

 The next step is to retail 

 the collection successfully and the response will determine 

 how far the model we are trying to build will be feasible. 

 This is our first foray into retail, admitted Subhendu 

 Bhattacharya, business development manager of R amp;B Enterprises.

 The retail mantra of R amp;B is 

 simple competitive pricing. The 35-piece collection 

 is priced between Rs 1,200 and Rs 4,500, with one or two 

 garments touching Rs 7,000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

 You are versatile, talented and bubbling with energy and passion. Beware of taking on too many tasks at one go. You may find it difficult to concentrate on one thing for a long time. Your optimism can create misunderstandings. You find differentiating reality from fantasy rather uncomfortable. You work best in collaboration with others. ? Kusum Bhandari

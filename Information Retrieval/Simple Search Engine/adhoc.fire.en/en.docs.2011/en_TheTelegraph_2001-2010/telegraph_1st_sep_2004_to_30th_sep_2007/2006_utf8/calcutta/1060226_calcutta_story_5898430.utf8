 Pretty woman on ramp and screen

 A role model for many a wannabe ramp walker, this svelte beauty with dreamy eyes, disarming dimpled smile and an hourglass figure is currently making waves with her appearance in a Himesh Reshammiya video album. A favourite with top designers and fashion choreographers of the country, Bangalore girl Deepika Padukone was in town on Saturday for the launch of the D? Elite Collection of diamond jewellery from the house of PC Chandra. Deepika spoke to Metro about style, screen and more.

 Style mantra: ?Style for me is personality. It comes through in whatever you wear,? she says with easy confidence, looking hot in a pair of denims and a red halter top. ?I never follow trends ? one should always go for comfort and what suits your body type.?

 Just jewels: ?I am really fond of jewellery. Those with contemporary sensibilities appeal to me. I have a fetish for kundan too. Colourful stones set in intricate designs make them look attractive.?

 Dress diva: ?For parties I am more into flowy dresses, for chilling out it is more of tees and trousers.? Among her favourite designers, Wendell Rodricks and JJ Valaya top the list. ?Their taste, simple and straight, matches mine.?

 The inheritance: ?I am glad to have inherited an athletic toned body. It runs in the family,? says the daughter of badminton great Prakash Padukone.

 Film focus: ?Hindi film is where my heart lies, but then I would often wonder whether my height would be a deterrent? With the likes of Abhishek Bachchan and Hrithik Roshan making news, I am glad I am tall,? says the rising star doing Aishwarya, a Kannada love story where she is cast opposite superstar Upendra. Mum is the word on speculation of her being picked for a Farah Khan film.

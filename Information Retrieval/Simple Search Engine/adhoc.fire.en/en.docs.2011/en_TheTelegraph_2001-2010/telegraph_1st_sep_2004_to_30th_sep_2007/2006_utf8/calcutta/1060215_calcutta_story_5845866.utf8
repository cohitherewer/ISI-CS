 Ground convenor, Calcutta Book Fair 

 The Book Fair is a place where 

 one can browse over a length of time. That is why food is 

 a vital presence. If one were to just drop in, buy a title 

 of choice and leave, then College Street would have been 

 enough. Book Fair is a book lover?s haven. That is why other 

 products like music albums should not get space here as 

 that would distract consumers. But we leave about 2,000 

 sq ft to various IT companies with their bouquet of VCDs 

 and DVDs of comic strips and books from Bengali literature 

 like Handa-Bhonda and Thakumar Jhuli. This is a sign 

 that our Book Fair is moving with the times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For better surgery of joints 

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 A crack team of specialists is seeking to shake up the poor joint replacement services that Calcutta?s hospitals offer. 

 BP Poddar Hospital has launched an initiative to increase awareness of joint replacement in Calcutta.

 The team is headed by Guruva Reddy, who worked with the National Health Service in Britain for 10 years before setting up practice in Hyderabad. Joining him on the newly-founded team is Amal Bhattacharya of Calcutta, and six other doctors, whose collective expertise ranges from cardiology to anaesthesia.

 Through the new BP Poddar initiative, Reddy wants to increase awareness about the new services being brought to Calcutta. 

 ?I regularly have people travelling down from Calcutta to Hyderabad for a joint operation. With my monthly clinic, families will not have to endure the hardship of a trip down to Hyderabad for such an operation.? 

 He quoted a statistic to illustrate his point: ?Six hundred patients are operated on for joint replacement in Hyderabad, a city approximately half the size of Calcutta. Only 100 patients undergo the same operation in Calcutta.? 

 Addressing the issue of the lack of facilities in the city for joint operations, the orthopaedic surgeon said: ?Calcutta was relatively slow in comparison to other cities when it came to the establishment of corporate hospitals.? 

 Surgeon Bhattacharya confirmed that ?many of the existing facilities were set up by individual doctors and some of them are substandard. A lack of trust for joint surgery stems from the lack of proper facilities?.

 The team has ambitions to make Calcutta the centre for joint operations in northeast India, with patients coming from the Northeast states.

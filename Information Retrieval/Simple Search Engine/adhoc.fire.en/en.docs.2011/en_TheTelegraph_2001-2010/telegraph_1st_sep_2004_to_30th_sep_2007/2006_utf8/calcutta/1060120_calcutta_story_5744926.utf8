 SKIN WATCH 

 Pooja Bedi at the Kaya Skin Clinic 

 Kaya Skin Clinic, the chain of outlets providing skin solutions and services, recently signed on actress Pooja Bedi to endorse their age-control services.

 An ardent Kaya client, the vivacious actress and anchor availed of the clinics services before agreeing to promote them. I did not come to Kaya to conceal my age or shy away from it. In fact, I opted for their age-control solutions to maintain my natural look. Once I was convinced of the efficacy of the services, I instantly agreed to endorse them, says Pooja.

 For Kaya, there couldnt have been a better choice for a brand ambassador. Our association with Pooja goes back two years. Her youthful looks and vibrant personality stand as the perfect testimony of our age-control services. Thus when it came to a celebrity endorsement, she was our first choice, says Mrinmoy Mukherjee, head of marketing, Kaya Skin Clinic.

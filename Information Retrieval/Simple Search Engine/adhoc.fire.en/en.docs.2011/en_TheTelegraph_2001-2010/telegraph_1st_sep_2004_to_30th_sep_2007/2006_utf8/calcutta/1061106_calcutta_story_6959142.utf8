The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 get through this week without

 Trying touch therapy

 Submit yourself to the magic of 

 massages this week. Head, hands, feet, back, face, body 

 pamper them all with touch therapy. Not only will a massage 

 give a bouncy boost to your blood circulation, but it will 

 also prepare you for the dry winter months ahead.

 Olive oil with a dash of your 

 favourite aroma essence (lavender, primrose) works wonders 

 for the body while heated coconut or almond oil soothes 

 the scalp. Indulge in a fancy facial and try a moisture-laden 

 hair spa. The idea is to replenish and repair dryness.

 Recommended: a good ol Kerala-style 

 Abhyangam, LaStone Therapy or a super session of foot reflexology. 

 Nothing beats the oh-so-amazing feel of warm dripping oil 

 caressing your skin and caring for it. Give in. Now.

 Catching some Holly action 

 Give Bollywood a break and return 

 to good ol Marty. After Gangs of New York and 

 Aviator, Martin Scorsese, at 64, remakes a Chinese-Hong 

 Kong cop-and-robber film into The Departed. With 

 a delicious cast of Jack Nicholson, Leonardo Di Caprio and 

 Matt Damon, its your best bet on the big screen till 

 Dhoom 2 vrooms in!

 Raising the F-quotient

 The not-so-fashionable want to 

 do something about their wardrobes; the fashionable want 

 to do even more. That is the effect a fashion week has. 

 Get a dash of fashion week into your daily life. So what 

 if we saw a series of spring-summer 2007 collections, but 

 a fashionable head start never really hurt anyone. Incorporate 

 the brand new next year trends from Lakme Fashion Week ASAP. 

 And sizzle with style this winter. But remember to adapt 

 to the ongoing season. How about copying the balloon hemline 

 and carrying it longer than the knee?

 And while at it, be sure to debate 

 the elaborate pin-and-tuck measures taken to prevent a wardrobe 

 malfunction on the ramp this time.

 Panel for minority uplift

 - Leaders discuss problems with minister, call for assistance

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Close on the heels of the Prime Ministers interaction with minority community leaders in New Delhi, state minister of minorities development Abdus Sattar on Wednesday met representatives of the minority communities to discuss their problems.

 After the meeting, Sattar launched West Bengal Minorities Coordination Committee, which will henceforth be the nodal agency for carrying out work for their uplift.

 This is the first time Muslims, Christians and Sikhs, the main minority communities in Calcutta, have come together to form a committee for their development.

 The minority associations used to work separately. But from now on, the committee will be the nodal panel for undertaking programmes for the development of the minorities. The committee will formulate and implement programmes from time to time, said Herod Mullick, state general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba and ad hoc convener of the new committee.

 At the meeting, the representatives of the minorities discussed with the minister issues like education and socio-economic problems affecting their communities. 

 The Muslim leaders demanded government assistance for 100 madarsas across the state. They called for grant of madarsa status to educational institutions run by the Muslims that receive no financial aid from the government. The minister was also requested to arrange for textbooks for some of the madarsas. 

 We have asked the government to provide English, Bengali and Mathematics textbooks to the students, as most of them cannot afford to spend money on education, said Md Kamauru Zzaml, general secretary, West Bengal Minorities Youth Federation.

 The Sikhs wanted land to set up a colony with schools and gurdwaras. They also sought government assistance to build a hospital. 

 The minister gave us a patient hearing. We are hopeful something positive will follow, stated Sukhnandan Singh Aluwalia, secretary, Gurdwara Garcha Sikh Sangat.

 Education topped the agenda of the Christian leaders. There are about 100 primary schools in the city. They cater mostly to the underprivileged section of the students, of whom a remarkable percentage belongs to minority communities. What we now need is infrastructure development of these schools, for which we have appealed to the government, said Mullick.

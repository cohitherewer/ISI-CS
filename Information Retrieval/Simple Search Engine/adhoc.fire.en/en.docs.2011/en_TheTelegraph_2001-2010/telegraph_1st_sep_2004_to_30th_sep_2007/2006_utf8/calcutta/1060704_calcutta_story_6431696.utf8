 Tech sector minnows cry neglect

 - Plan for platform

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 While the state government is going out of its way to woo information technology (IT) giants such as Wipro, Infosys and ITC Infotech, the small and medium enterprises (SME) in the sector are feeling a little neglected.

 The local IT entrepreneurs are clamouring for increased support from the government in the areas of infrastructure, marketing of ventures and finance.

 ?We would like to see a more active role played by the state government and the IT department in promoting our business,? said Mahesh Shah, managing director, Pecon Software.

 ?While the IT department has gone on numerous roadshows over the past five years in India and abroad, the cause of the small and medium enterprises, comprising mostly local entrepreneurs, could have been projected in a better manner,? he added.

 The local players are also not happy with the fact that while the state government has allotted 30 acres in Rajarhat exclusively for them, they are yet to get possession of the plots.

 ?The allotment took place last year, but the handing over is due. Officials have informed us that it should take place in two-three months,? said Shah.

 The SMEs are also worried that by 2009, they will have to set up or even relocate their operations in special economic zones, since the state government has proposed to roll back all tax exemptions on revenue earned by companies situated in software technology parks. 

 This and the recent statements by housing minister Goutam Deb and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on non-utilisation of land and supposed lack of job creation in the sector have led the local players to contemplate setting up an association for themselves.

 Shah feels the formation of such a body would help them further their interests.

 ?We need time to grow. Such a body will help us initiate a greater dialogue with the state government and also address certain issues that have been plaguing the IT industry for some time, such as high attrition and sourcing of quality manpower,? pointed out Shah.

 The date for the formation of the platform has not been set. Preliminary meetings to discuss the issue are expected later this month.

 ?This will also allow us make representations to the government for sops such as tax rebates and tax incentives, increased bandwidth and setting up of special economic zones,? emphasised Shah. 

 ?We would also like the government to try and convince financial institutions to formulate a separate policy for companies like ours,? he signed off.

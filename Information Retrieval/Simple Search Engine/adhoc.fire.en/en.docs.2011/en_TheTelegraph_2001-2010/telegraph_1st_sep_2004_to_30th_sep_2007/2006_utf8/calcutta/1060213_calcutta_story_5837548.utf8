The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Loan link to civic tax reforms

 RAJIVA SINHA, project director, Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Sandip Banerjee, Srikumar Chattopadhyay, J.N. Das, Kali Shankar Ghosh, Anjana Dasgupta, Rupayan Datta, Debasish Guhathakurata, Ashok Das and Subhadyuti Datta

Subhadyuti Datta: Is there a link between the Asian Development Bank?s (ADB) loan for the improvement of the city and the water tax and property tax reforms of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)?

 Yes. According to the loan covenant, all the consumers of filtered water are to be metered by the end of fiscal year 2009-2010. It has also been mentioned in the loan covenant that the CMC shall implement property tax reforms acceptable to the ADB by the end of fiscal year 2003-2004.

Srikumar Chattopadhyay: The canals in the city are in a miserable condition. They are a source of pollution and a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The canals are interconnected, hence revamp of only a handful of them under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) will fail to produce the desired results.

 The aim of CEIP isn?t just to clean the canals. We are revamping only those canals that are essential for the project?s drainage and sewerage infrastructure scheme. The scheme would benefit residents of Behala, Garden Reach, Jadavpur and several other pockets.

 However, it is fact that we would have achieved better results if all the canals were revamped together. The state irrigation department too has taken up revamp of some canals.

Srikumar Chattopadhyay: How long will it take to clean the canals? Will they be navigable after the revamp?

 It will take 24 months to complete the work. I would like to point out that sewerage canals are not for navigation. The state irrigation department is dredging Tolly?s Nullah, Beleghata canal and Belgachhia canal for navigation purposes.

Sandip Banerjee: Why was there such a delay in starting the CEIP work, even though the loan agreement with the ADB was signed in 2001?

 I admit that the CEIP is running three years behind schedule. However, even the ADB has acknowledged that it had sanctioned the loan prematurely. The money was sanctioned on the basis of a feasibility report. The delay would not have taken place if it had been granted on the basis of the actual project report. The Calcutta experience has been an eye-opener for the ADB. It has decided that henceforth no loan will be sanctioned without a proper project report.

Sandip Banerjee: The CEIP is a time-bound project. Given the three-year delay, can you still meet the deadline?

 The loan from the ADB has been effective from April 2002. The deadline for the project was 2007. The ADB has extended it to 2010 after realising the ground realities.

Srikumar Chattopadhyay: When will the loan be repaid and at what interest rate?

 Repayment will start from July 1, 2007 and will continue till 2010 at the rate of Rs 8 crore every six months. Between 2011 and 2020, the half-yearly repayment rate will be Rs 50 crore. The repayment rate between 2026 and 2038 will be Rs 100 crore. 

 The ADB is charging four per cent interest on the loan amount but the CMC will have to pay eight per cent since the loan has been processed through the state and central governments.

J.N. Das: Revamp of drainage canals require eviction of settlers on the embankment. Where will the families go?

 The CEIP is carrying out resettlement programme at a cost Rs 23 crore. About 3,500 families have been identified for rehabilitation.

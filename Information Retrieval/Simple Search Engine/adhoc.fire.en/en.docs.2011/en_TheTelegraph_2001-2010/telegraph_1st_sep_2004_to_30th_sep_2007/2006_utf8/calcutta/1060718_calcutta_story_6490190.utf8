 The wake up call for Calcutta?s Metro Railway came as early as on 7/7, when serial blasts ripped apart the London Underground.

 The Mumbai blasts on 7/11, which killed around 200 people and left more than 500 injured, were a reminder of the fact that the mass transit system, availed of by more than 3.5 lakh commuters on a working day, is now a prime target of terrorists.

 ?We have been on alert since the London Underground blasts last year. The vigil has been stepped up and we carry out regular drills to monitor passenger safety on Metro,? says Samir Chandra Banerjee, spokesperson for Metro Railway.

 Following last Tuesday?s blasts in Mumbai, extra security men have been deployed at the stations. Passengers are being frisked and sniffer dogs are doing the rounds. 

 ?What local trains are for Mumbai, Metro is for Calcutta. So, the security has been beefed up to avert any mishap. We are leaving nothing to chance,? says Banerjee.

 Every station has closed-circuit cameras that monitor the movement of passengers on the platforms.

 ?There are between eight and 16 cameras installed at each station. We have requisitioned around 260 more. We have also decided to procure more scanners and metal detectors, so that commuters are not inconvenienced during rush hours,? said Banerjee.

 The number of security men posted at the stations, too, has gone up. Among the agencies responsible for Metro security are the Railway Protection Force (RPF), Metro Railway Police (MRP) and the Calcutta Police.

 Since the Mumbai blasts, RPF personnel have been accompanying each train.

 Banerjee admitted to certain loopholes in the security set-up. ?We, at times, receive reports that security personnel are not attending their duty. Also, the scanners at some stations are not functioning. We are trying our best to solve these problems.?

 For the authorities, commuters remain the biggest source of help. Hence, frequent announcements are being made on the public address system, urging commuters to be alert.

 ?If every passenger on the platform remains alert, it would be difficult for anyone to trigger blasts or engage in other disruptive activities in the Metro. Thanks to passengers, we had averted several mishaps in the past,? Banerjee said.

 DTH drives cablemen to clean up act

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Look what competition can do, even to the not-so-friendly neighbourhood cableman. Fearing a direct-to-home (DTH) invasion before the conditional access system (CAS) is rolled out, operators are fast closing ranks to upgrade technology and woo the viewer.

 After having often held the subscribers to ransom, the last-mile operator is now ready to roll out the sops DVD quality picture and CD quality sound; more than 55 free to air channels; pay channels chosen by the subscriber; video on demand; special features like selecting camera angles while watching cricket matches; broadband Internet connection...

 We will be able to provide a customised package of channels to each individual subscriber, stressed a cableman, adding how set-top boxes are being software-tuned to provide special effects and compete with Tata Sky or Dish TV.

 What the cablewallah cannot offer, however, is underground optic fibre clarity, a platform for interactive television viewing and services like newsroom (highlighting four news channels in separate on-screen windows).

 In an ironical twist, after months of opposing CAS, cable operators are now eyeing the system as a lifeline. 

 We will be in real trouble if CAS is not rolled out by January, said Tapas Das, an operator in south Calcutta. Its a do-or-die situation for us. If we do not take the initiative now, we may have to wind up business.

 A senior Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) official described the scenario as the best possible for viewers. Previously, most cable operators and even some service providers were resisting CAS. They wanted the cable industry to remain unorganised, so that they could keep on making money through under-declaration, said an official.

 CAS could wipe the system clean, but that is preferable for cablemen than being wiped out by DTH. Being organised for CAS is far better than being bypassed by DTH, summed up a cableman.

 Cable operators who have been recently granted licence to operate as multi-system operators (MSOs) in the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority area the CAS zone are planning a tier system to win over customers, DTH-style.

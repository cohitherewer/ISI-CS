 Consider these facts. On an average, there are 4,680 lightning strikes on Calcutta in a year with a mean strike of 5.2 per sq km. The number varies from a minimum of 1,800 to a maximum of 12,600. The figures are the highest among the Indian cities with Chennai and Bangalore emerging a distant second.

 ?In such a scenario, the protection measures against lightning strikes are woefully inadequate in Calcutta,? feels Sonjeeb Banerjee, director of Duval Messien, a French company specialising in lightning protection.

 The 175-year-old company has now tied up with Calcutta-based Macmet India to launch its third-generation lightning protection system, SATELIT-3, which, it claims, is the world?s most advanced system.

 SATELIT-3 offers a three-layer protection, being able to withstand strikes of up to 16kA (kilo ampere) and covers an area of diameter 214 metres. The traditional Franklin Rod, in comparison, is able to withstand strikes of less force and only protects an area of diameter 8 metres.

 SATELIT-3, on detecting an imminent lightning strike, generates a charge and hits the lightning about 60 metres above the tip and channelises it to the ground. The third-generation model can also distinguish between a positive and a negative lightning strike.

 ?Earlier, the device could tackle only positive strikes. A study showed us that only 10 per cent strikes in Calcutta are in fact positive. SATELIT-3 is able to determine the polarity of the strike within a very small time period, as well as its strength and distance,? explained Banerjee. The device has to be super fast since lightning travels at a speed of 15,000 km per second.

 The in-built self-check mechanism of the device can be constantly monitored from the ground with a handheld remote control.

 Made of stainless steel, SATELIT-3 is assembled entirely in France and has components from other European countries.

 It has been only two years that the product has been allowed to be sold to non-defence clients and SATELIT-3 has already been installed in over 80 countries, Duval Messien claimed. Airports, nuclear facilities, space centres, ammunition and explosive dumps, gas plants, telecom towers, hospitals and intelligent buildings are some of the places where the device is being used.

 ?In India, the product was launched only four months ago and we have been able to cover 77 installations,? said P.K. Madappa, managing director of Macmet India. The company plans to take the figure up to 5,000 in the next three years with the east contributing the largest chunk. 

 Priced between Rs 3-5 lakh, Macmet plans to target the IT parks, telecom companies, hospitals, control rooms and the airport in the city. ?Once installed, no maintenance is required for at least 25 years,? Madappa added.

 Biodiversity may be shrinking fast but World Biodiversity Day (May 22) in the Year of World Biodiversity (2006) certainly looks all set to yield a crop of events rich in variety. 

 In Calcutta, the state forest department, National Council of Science Museums and Aranyak are organising a day-long celebration at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM). 

 The programme will start at 10 am with a photography show on Calcutta?s biodiversity. This will be followed by the launch of a booklet Why Conserve Biodiversity.

 Compiled by Vinod Kumar Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden, the booklet illustrates how much we depend on biological resources. 

 ?What would happen if all the eagles, snakes, spiders, frogs and owls died or we cut all the trees? It is because there is no price tag on oxygen or the natural mechanism of pest control that we don?t appreciate their value,? said Yadav. 

 It is very important that people learn how the ecology supports the global economy, provides numerous services and works as a life support system. BITM, in collaboration with the forest department, may even launch a new gallery on biodiversity, he said. 

 From 10.45 am there will be a multimedia show entitled Wonders of Bengal?s Wilderness ? Big and Small presented by the Calcutta-based NGO Aranyak. The group has been doing commendable work in hosting the annual wildlife film shows, screenings in schools and conserving wetlands in Santragachhi, Narendrapur and the Sunderbans. 

 From 11.15 am, a panel comprising J.R.B. Alfred, director, Zoological Society of India, C.D. Singh, joint director Botanical Society of India, K.C. Gayen, principal chief conservator of forests, government of West Bengal, S.B. Mondal, principal chief conservator of wildlife, government of West Bengal, and Suchitra Ghosh, lecturer, zoology, Calcutta University, will discuss Biodiversity Conservation ? Importance, threats and strategies. A film show, Cherub of the Mist, on the endangered Red Panda will be held at 12.30 pm, after which representatives of the three organisations will take position at various street corners to distribute wildlife leaflets, stickers and posters. 

 BITM intends to propagate the need for biodiversity through more events, including the eastern India science drama and science quiz contests and the National Science Seminar. Efforts will be made to spread the message beyond mainstream children from established schools, said Jayanta Sthanapati, director, BITM.

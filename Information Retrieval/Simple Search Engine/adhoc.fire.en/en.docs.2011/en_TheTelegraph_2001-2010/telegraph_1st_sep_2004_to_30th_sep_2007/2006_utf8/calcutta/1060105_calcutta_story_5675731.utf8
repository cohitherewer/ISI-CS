Life

 Other side of midnight

SHRADHA AGARWAL

I am often called upon by youngsters to verify personal 

details about their would-be partners before their relationship takes a serious 

turn?

 The confidant and the informer is neither your gossipy neighbourhood uncle nor a super sleuth, neither a professional counsellor nor your family matchmaker.

 The verifier happens to be a manager of hookah bar Shisha. Ask Sovan Mukherjee about this outrageous addition in his job profile and his explanation is simple: One glance is all you need to judge a person in a nightclub and then, who knows them better than us? 

 Welcome to 2006. A year that will carry the party story of the city forward. And while the party people are at it, whats stopping them from making a match or two. Or unmaking an almost-fixed match or two. 

 Think about it? What better deep throat than a night club administrator or DJ, the only ones who see the party animals in action, night in and night out. Those from whom nothing remains hidden.

 Serious tying-the-knot issues or just-like-that flings, picking the right partner is the name of the game. If I really like a guy and I know about a bar he frequents, then I would surely check out his details from the club managerial, declares financial consultant Neha Agarwal, 25.

 Well, sounds all right, because like Neha, many others feel that its the real you that parties at night. 

 Drinking patterns, financial standing, profile in general and the kind of company he or she keeps ? all key factors to ascertain whether youre with the right person or not. And each of the key factors, well known to your Hey man, DJ or manager buddy.

 Simply talking to the guests for five minutes can tell you a lot about him, his tastes and preferences, family background and upbringing, confirms Sovan, an industry insider for over eight years. 

 According to event architect Amit Hathiramani, a lot of people harbour split personalities when theyre in and out of a bar. Many of them pretend to be something they are not during the day and are completely wild while clubbing. Unless youre a regular part of this crowd, youll never know. Also, its impossible for the partners to be together all the time ? only we know whats happening behind their backs.

 Theres a thin line between knowing whats up and saying whats up. Take DJ Girish for example: I give my opinion only when asked. Isnt it better to keep my mouth shut than to invade others privacy?

 While Girish does make an exception for close pals, he also makes it clear that if someones paernts ask me, then as a responsible citizen, I would definitely tell them what I know. 

 Wicked best is how DJ Sooraj likes to describe how people are late into the night at the clubs. If I see something wrong in someone then I would definitely cross-check, but if anybody wants me to match-make for them seriously then they need to convince me big time! smiles Sooraj.

 While this match-fixer says introductions is where he would draw the line and let the two take it from there, he would, at a crunch, reveal information.

 Sources at nightclubs can throw light on both morality and money matters. Anyone can run up big bills for one month but solid financial standing can be ascertained only if the standard is maintained for four months, reveals Sovan.

The big bite

Passing Through

 Shiney Ahuja at The Park on Wednesday afternoon.

I bite and the sting lingers and lingers says 

Shiney Ahuja, his grey-blue eyes fixed in a steely gaze as his lips curl into 

that signature smile. My scenes have that effect. Im told that Hazaaron 

Khwaishein Aisis climax had it and, wait and watch, so will Woh Lamhe

Bite and sting are not the chosen topics for the day, 

but the shark sure is. Close enough. Bites, stings and sharks. Adding all that 

up is Shark Tooth, the latest vodka brand from the house of Diageo. And Shiney 

as its brand ambassador fits in just right.

I wasnt interested in endorsing anything, 

but as they discussed the concept with me, I identified with it immediately and 

was on board pronto, says Shiney, in town on Wednesday to unveil the vodka.

Its a maiden venture for both of us 

Shark Tooth and me their entry into the market and my first endorsement life 

has come full circle, said the model-turned-actor. 

Concept identified with and product approved (I 

had a shot and it felt so smooth in my mouth It went down my throat well too), 

Shiney is clearly enjoying his new role. Endorsing the brand and endorsing it 

quite well.

The vodka is very much like me. It signifies 

independence, free will and goes straight for the kill, without paying any heed 

to the norms exactly what I did in Bollywood broke all rules. Not just today, 

I have been like this as a child, he says, admitting that even his army-dad 

couldnt control him. 

There was no real need for parental control, though, 

because party person is not exactly what Shiney would call himself. 

But Shark Tooth should change it, he adds with a quick wink, hinting 

at the two neat shots of the vodka he downed barely past noon not long before 

boarding the flight back home.

I really like Calcutta... I came here five years 

ago for a Peter England show and hope to be back soon. I also meet a lot of people 

in Mumbai, who are from Calcutta, signs off the Gangster. 

Theres another reason why Shiney likes Calcutta. 

It is home to Ya Ali singer Zubin Garg and that happens to be Shineys 

favourite song. It gave me a lot of mileage and Ill never forget it.

 Nor will we!

 Tech edge for poor kids

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A city-based NGO is making a novel attempt to upgrade the quality of education provided to underprivileged children at government schools and learning centres in slums, with special emphasis on technological skills.

 Vikramshila, the NGO, has started a programme to train teachers of five other NGOs that work with government schools or operate learning centres in slums.

 ?The training will provide teachers with the knowhow of modern technology. This, in turn, will make classroom learning interactive and relevant,? felt Leslie D?Gama of IL amp;FS Education and Technology Service Ltd, which is backing the programme.

 From modules on how to use a K-yan as a teaching aid to using digital cameras and doing voiceovers, the training covers a gamut of topics. 

 The K-yan is a compact media centre, including an LCD projector and a bank of 1,000 ready-to-use audio-visual lessons on various subjects. A number of private schools in the city already use the device. Each of the five NGOs has been provided with a K-yan and a digital camera.

 Bina Mooljee of Disha said: ?We already had three sessions with the device at the primary level and the children loved it.? Disha works mainly in the slums of Manoharpukur and organises remedial classes for children attending government schools.

 Pamela Mitra, a teacher at Samya Samaj, another NGO that works in government schools, has been using the K-yan to grade curriculum content anew, according to the differing abilities of children in the same class. ?We have prepared different lessons for different students by reformatting the existing syllabus material. We will use the K-yan to teach the lessons in the classroom,? she explained. Mitra plans to use the digital camera to encourage children to make films on different themes and, thus, stimulate self-learning.

 ?Technological skills will not only make the students more confident but also empower them by opening up the world, which is the need of the hour,? opined Kanupriya Jhunjhunwala of Vikramshila. Apart from introducing technology in the classrooms, the programme, called Quest (quality education for sustainable transformation), focuses on making teaching methods participatory and inculcating life skills in children.

 Quest targets kids between six and 14 years, but the thrust is on the 9-14 age-group, which has the highest dropout rate..

 Scrap trade rivalry led to killing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The firing near Sealdah station on Thursday evening that claimed a life was the fallout of a rivalry between two gangs engaged in trading scrap metal, police said on Friday.

 The victim, Panchanan Yadav, 32, was entering the station to book a parcel for New Jalpaiguri. He was acting for one of the gangs, said an officer of Muchipara thana.

 Yadav, a resident of Ara, Bihar, had been living in the Beleghata railway quarters on rent for the past two decades. Apart from trading in scrap, he worked as a tout in Sealdah and Chitpur, said Ajey Ranade, deputy commissioner (central). We have gathered a few clues that could lead us to a breakthrough.

 Yadav was walking down the passage leading to the station with two others around 6.30 pm on Thursday (picture of murder site by Pabitra Das). 

 Witnesses told police there was no sign of discord among the three. They were talking among themselves.

 Suddenly, one of them stepped back, pulled out a revolver and pumped a bullet into Yadavs left ear. The bullet went through his skull, said an officer. After the murder, the duo melted into the crowd. The incident was premeditated and occurred in a flash. No one could react, he added.

 Yadav was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, a few yards away, where he was pronounced dead.

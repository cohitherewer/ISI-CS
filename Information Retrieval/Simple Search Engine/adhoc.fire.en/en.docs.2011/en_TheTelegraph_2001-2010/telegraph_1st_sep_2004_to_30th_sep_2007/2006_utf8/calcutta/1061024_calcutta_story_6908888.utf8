 The City Diary

 There was violence at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital early on Monday following the death of a 60-year-old patient. Gopal Haldar, a resident of Nanda Kishore Road in the Tallah police station area, was brought to the emergency ward in the morning. He was an asthma patient. The doctors pronounced him dead, sparking mob fury. The men who accompanied Haldar claimed that doctors had not attended to him in time. Soon after, they attacked the doctors. Witnesses claimed that a few doctors retaliated. Before long, a group of 40 youths from Nanda Kishore Road turned up at the hospital and started beating up the doctors. Officers of Tallah police station restored order.

 A bomb scare threw traffic out of gear for nearly an hour on Howrah bridge on Monday afternoon. Some pedestrians saw a portable transistor radio set lying on the Howrah-end of the bridge around 12.30 pm. A large number of people gathered around the set causing a traffic snarl. A police team reached the spot and cordoned off the area. Bomb squad personnel later examined the transistor set and declared it harmless. 

 A police picket was posted near the house of Sudeb Das, who allegedly masterminded the murder of Durjoy Dey, a Sodepur-based trader, on Sunday. Police said the picket was posted as local youths had vandalised the house and torched it on Sunday night. The local CPM leaders had organised a street-corner meeting demanding immediate arrest of Das, who is absconding. 

 About 100 members of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity on Monday applied bhai phonta on three trees at Telkal Ghat. The Samity members washed the trees. Samity general secretary Subhas Dutta said the programme was meant to spread awareness about the risks of tree felling.

 A Kali puja pandal near Howrah fish market was gutted around 10.40 am on Monday. Two tenders put out the blaze in 45 minutes. By then, the idol and the structure were destroyed, said a fireman. The cause of the fire could not be ascertained. 

 A crack developed on a water pipeline at Kamdahari on Monday night, stalling traffic in the Regent Park area. Police said engineers of the water supply department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had visited the spot and were trying to plug the leak. 

 The CESC announced on Monday that it would soon offer call centre services for complaint redressal in its entire service area. We have call centres (1912) for south and central Calcutta. By mid-December, we hope to cover our entire service area, said CESC executive director Santanu Chatterjee. The service at the centre will improve, he claimed.

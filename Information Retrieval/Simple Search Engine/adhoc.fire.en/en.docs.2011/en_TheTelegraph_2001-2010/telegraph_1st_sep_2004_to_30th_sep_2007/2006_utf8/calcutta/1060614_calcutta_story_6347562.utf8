 New Market: Upgrade agenda. A Telegraph picture

 The city?s civic authorities have decided to rope in the Calcutta chapter of the Indian National Trust for Cultural Heritage (Intach) to monitor the proposed reconstruction of the 132-year-old New Market.

 The ambitious project will cost not less than Rs 100 crore and will take about four years to complete, said Nilangshu Basu, director-general (civil) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 It will be a private-public participation (PPP) scheme and the civic authorities are getting ready to invite an expression of interest from private parties. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who has already got a Heritage Assessment Report for New Market done by Intach, established contact with the convener of its Calcutta chapter, G.M. Kapur, on Monday evening, requesting that the trust monitor the reconstruction in lieu of a fee for services rendered.

 ?Before inviting interested parties, we have got the structural assessment report of the existing structure done by Jadavpur University (JU) and the heritage assessment by Intach,? said Bandyopadhyay on Tuesday.

 According to the structural assessment report by JU, major sections of the structure demand immediate intervention. The roof in some blocks of the market are in a deplorable and unsafe condition.

 Intach, in its report, remarked that littering and vandalism compounded the problems of the market. Add to that defacement of the structure by human agents as well as by the municipal policy on advertisements. 

 Low public awareness about its heritage value was also responsible for its present state.

 Describing the scope of future development, the report admits that a complete overhaul of the services and facilities provided by the market is necessary. 

 The CMC?s makeover proposal with private participation shall have to address the problems of upgrade while remaining sensitive to the significance of the property and need for adherence to its heritage status.

 In determining the heritage value of the structure, the report says the entire New Market complex cannot enjoy a blanket classification as the building had undergone phased development during 1883-85, 1895-97, 1903-04 and later in 1990. It comprises several structures with different degrees of historical, architectural and social significance.

 New Market?s heritage value has been classified in three grades, in accordance with the degree of interference allowable in them.

 Oral cancer cases on rise 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Smoking, tobacco consumption and pollution have contributed to a sharp increase in cases of oral cancer among young men and working women in Calcutta.

 According to doctors, the number of oral cancer cases among those between 20 and 30 has gone up by 10 per cent in three to four years.

 ?Oral cancer has now become a lifestyle disease, like cardiac ailments, obesity and diabetes,? stated Goutam Mukhopadhyay, head of the new super-speciality head and neck cancer department of AMRI Hospitals. 

 Of the 75,000 cancer cases detected in the state every year, 25,000 are head and neck cancer cases. About 91 per cent of the head and neck cancer cases are caused by tobacco. There are about 2,000 Calcuttans between 20 and 30 suffering from this type of cancer. 

 ?The hike in oral cancer cases is linked to the rise in smoking and chewing of tobacco among young people,? opined Mukhopadhyay. Cancer in the mouth or oesophagus among working women in Calcutta is also on the rise, he added. ?Pollution and passive smoking play a major role in the spread of oral cancer.? 

 Prevention is more important than treatment of oral cancer. ?Raising awareness among people against smoking is vital,? stressed Mukhopadhyay.

 ?People should be taught how to detect the early signs of oral cancer. Leukoplatia ? white patches in the oral cavity caused by smoking ? is a pre-cancerous condition that can take a deadly turn in a short time,? the doctor elaborated. ?If you see such a patch in your mouth, immediately consult a doctor.? 

 Consultant radiotherapist of NRS Medical College and Hospital Subir Ganguly explained the role of spicy food and oral hygiene in cancer. ?Too much spice irritates the oral mucus membrane, which may result in cancer.? A sharp or broken tooth could cause irritation to the tongue, which can deteriorate to cancer. 

 At AMRI?s new unit, a team of specialists, including surgical oncologists, radiotherapists and ENT, dental and reconstructive surgeons will collaborate in the treatment of cancer patients, said a spokesperson. Facilities for micro-vascular reconstruction (MVR), a modern technique in cosmetic surgery, will be available, he claimed.

 In case of head and neck cancer, the oral cavity and lymph nodes of the neck are removed. The most common procedure involves amputation of a part, followed by its reconstruction using portions from the neck, hand or chest. 

 With the help of MVR, a single-stage procedure, any part of the body can be reconstructed in its entirety.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buoyant spirit spurs change

 - Bengal 

 shine with japan aid 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Yoshikazu Takeuchi, Japanese consul-general in Calcutta.

 Light rail transit system and fast-track freight corridor, a second airport and a deep-sea port, more bridges and flyovers, medical centres of excellence and tourism triggers?

 The wish list to propel Brand Bengal forward gets longer by the day and if Japanese overtures are to be heeded, the ?look-East? policy championed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and emphatically endorsed by our chief minister himself, could power many of these projects.

 A ?stable and progress-minded? government, ample power and water, improving infrastructure, and of course, ?energetic and intelligent? people ? there?s a lot going for Calcutta and Bengal, feels Yoshikazu Takeuchi, Japanese consul-general in Calcutta.

 ?We are obviously at ease with this state, and that?s not just because Calcutta faces towards east. Bengal is the second-largest recipient of Japanese ODA (overseas development assistance) after Uttar Pradesh and Mitsubishi Chemicals in Haldia is the largest Japanese investment in a single project in India. We are keen to keep the momentum going,? the consul-general tells Metro.

 Back in Calcutta after 42 years (he was here in 1964 as a college student), the most dramatic change Takeuchi sees is the passion and new energy. 

 ?This is an invisible change, unlike the IT hub, malls and multiplexes. If after decades of stagnation, Calcutta is again on the move, it?s because of this buoyant spirit.? 

 The diplomat, who has spent 14 years of his career in the subcontinent, is glad to be in West Bengal after having served the Japanese mission in Dhaka in the past. ?It?s great to experience both the Bengals, savour the elements that had inspired Tagore and Nazrul,? Takeuchi adds.

 The 63-year-old diplomat is confident this access and openness will boost Bengal?s ties with Japan even further. ?If infrastructure improves, it helps shore up economic cooperation too, and Japanese business is only too aware of this. Hence, we have had so many delegations visiting Calcutta of late.

 Apart from the LRT project, for which Japanese companies Jetro and JART have both sent teams for feasibility study, Japan is willing to increase its involvement in the power sector, help out in the second airport plan and set up the freight corridor connecting Calcutta with Mumbai and Delhi.

 ?The freight corridor is absolutely critical for business and even our Prime Minister is interested in the project. A team to study feasibility of the Kukrahati-Raichak bridge was also here. We are responding to every request from the Bengal government and the JBIC (Japan Bank for International Cooperation) is evaluating all the proposals,? Takeuchi stressed.

 He hopes once basic infrastructure improves further and there are direct flights to Japan, the speed of investment by Japanese industry would increase manifold. 

 Medical equipment and pharmacy are other areas where the intensity of collaboration could improve.

 He is also confident Calcutta-based NICED (National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases), a Yen 21-billion project with Japanese assistance, could become ?an international hub? for research on gastrointestinal problems and produce life-saving vaccines.

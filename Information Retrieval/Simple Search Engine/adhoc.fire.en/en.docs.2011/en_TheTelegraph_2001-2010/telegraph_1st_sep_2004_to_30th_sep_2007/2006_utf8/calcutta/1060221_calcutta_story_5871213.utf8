The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Veg diet for fitness amp; fashion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Matar Aloo over Murgh Musallam, Chilli Paneer over Chicken Tandoori, Sweet and Sour Vegetables over Schezwan Chicken? But this has nothing to do with bird or flu. The change at the Calcutta dining table, visible over the past couple of years, is all about fad and fitness, taste and tradition.

 Vegetarianism in Calcutta is in, confirm restaurateurs, with the booming eating-out industry pegging the rise in consumption of vegetarian dishes at over 25 per cent since 2003.

 Enough reason for Only Parathas, the popular vegetarian chain of restaurants based out of Mumbai, to come to Calcutta next month with a 2,500-sq-ft address at the AJC Bose Road-Lord Sinha Road crossing.

 ?Not just strict vegetarians, Calcutta has a considerable chunk of non-vegetarians who appreciate good vegetarian food. Observing this trend, we have decided to come here,? said Akash Agarwal, the Calcutta franchisee for Only Parathas.

 The go-green trend is all too evident in the star hotels, which so often find diners, local or international, opting for vegetables over meat.

 ?There is a pronounced leaning towards vegetarianism in Calcutta. Seventy per cent of the guests visiting our restaurants are vegetarian,? reveals the managing director of a star hotel.

 ?The rise in consumption of vegetables is very steep in the soups and salads segment,? adds David Cananzi, executive chef, Hyatt Regency.

 At standalone restaurants dotting the city?s foodscape, chicken and mutton often lose out to paneer and palak. ?The food pattern has undergone a sea change. We frequently have families, both Bengali and non-Bengali, ordering vegetarian food. If the older generation does it for health reasons, some of the youngsters find it fashionable,? says Sanjay Mukherjee, senior executive manager, Grain of Salt.

 Health is the primary factor behind the be-vegetarian spurt. ?Many people are turning vegetarian on their own as a precautionary measure. Awareness about how vegetables are good for the heart, how they provide all minerals required by the body and strengthen the immune system is definitely growing,? says Arpita Deb, nutritionist, Belle-Vue Clinic.

 Health and fitness apart, for GenX, being ?veg? often adds to the cool quotient, what with celebrity role models from Amitabh Bachchan to John Abraham sticking to the thin green line.

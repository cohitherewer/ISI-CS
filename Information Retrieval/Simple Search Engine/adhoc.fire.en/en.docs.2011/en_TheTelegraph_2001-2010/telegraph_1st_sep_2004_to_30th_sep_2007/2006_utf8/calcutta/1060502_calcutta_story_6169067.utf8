 Real estate will now have trained professionals. A Telegraph picture

 In the US, the first college-level course in real estate was taught at the University of Wisconsin in 1892. In the UK, by 1919, a management degree in real estate began to be awarded in the University of Cambridge.

 The concept has come to town a touch late. Nonetheless, Calcutta now has its own management programme in real estate, recently started by Heritage Institute of Technology, along with developers? body Credai?s state chapter.

 The total investment required for covering the housing shortage predicted in the Ninth Plan and for urban infrastructure would be roughly Rs 4,000 billion. This would demand the best of professional talent in all areas of the business ? strategising, constructing, project management, marketing and managing.

 The six-month diploma course at the Heritage Institute of Technology aims to address these specific areas, covering all the aspects of real estate management, including project management, finance, real estate marketing, legal issues pertaining to properties, income-tax issues, and so on.

 The curriculum is designed to ?make the participants become expert real estate professionals or self-employed? in the field of real estate promoting or real estate brokerage, according to a Credai official.

 ?It is felt that in the next decade, there will be five Indians among the world?s 10 richest people and we reckon at least three of them will be realtors,? says Pradip Kumar Chopra of the PS Group, immediate past secretary of Credai?s Bengal chapter and member of the faculty.

 ?There will be a huge demand for real estate professionals who are able to coordinate and create a system for real estate business in its entirety, be it development, the legal aspect, finance, marketing, project or property management,? says a Credai official involved with the curriculum.

 The ground reality, though, is a complete vacuum of trained professionals in the real estate management and property market, feel experts. 

 And this void will be felt more and more as outstation and overseas developers join the brick-and-mortar fray.

 ?The working of foreign investors is based on projected timeframes. When they start development, there is a stipulated timeframe to complete and market the project. For this, professionals trained in various disciplines of the real estate sector will be needed,? stresses Chopra.

 City architects and planners concur the need of the hour is to promote such institutes and that industry leaders, trade associations and the government should work together to train candidates for this vast market.

 ?There are two issues involved in such courses. For companies and professionals venturing into real estate, it?s important to have the technical knowledge so that they can assess the quality of the product. It is also necessary to understand what sells where so that they can guide the designers on content,? observes city-based teaching architect Mukul Mitra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rains in hiding

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

The monsoon current over Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal is still too weak to bring in the rains, but an upper-air cyclonic circulation near Myanmar has raised hopes that the prolonged sultry spell could finally come to an end in a few days.

 Calcuttans can also expect a brief respite from the sweltering heat in the next 24 hours.

 ?The monsoon current over Gangetic West Bengal continues to be weak,? said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore. ?However, because of a heavy incursion of moisture, rain or thundershowers may occur in isolated pockets of south Bengal, including Calcutta. The thundershowers will result from localised formation of rain clouds.?

 There is also the chance of a revival of the monsoon current in the next few days, Debnath added. 

 ?We have noticed a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over North Andaman Sea, off Myanmar. If the circulation moves towards Bengal, the monsoon current could become active. But even if that happens, north Bengal will receive more rainfall that the south.?

 The last time the city received any significant rain was on Friday night. Since Saturday, the mercury has been soaring steadily. 

 On Monday, the maximum temperature shot up to 37.6 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. The humidity, too, was high, with the maximum pegged at 94 per cent.

 Met officials said the monsoon current became weak shortly after it entered south Bengal on June 6, two days ahead of schedule. It entered north Bengal on May 28, eight days before schedule.

 ?Despite the monsoon entering Bengal early, the current was not too active. Monsoon currents become active and weak in cycles. Now we are experiencing the weak phase,? said an official.

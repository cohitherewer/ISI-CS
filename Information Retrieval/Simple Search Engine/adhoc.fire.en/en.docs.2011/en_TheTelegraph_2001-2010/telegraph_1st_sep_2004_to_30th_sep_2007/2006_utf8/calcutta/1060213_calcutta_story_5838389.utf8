 Five men were killed, while another had a miraculous escape, around 11 pm on Saturday when a Tata Sumo carrying them lost control and skidded off Basanti Road, near Arupota, in the Tiljala police station area, and landed in a deep drain. The drain carries effluents from the Bantala leather complex. 

 Members of a catering company, the six were returning home after finishing with a reception at Bantala. 

 Members of the city police?s disaster management group fished out the bodies after a massive operation on Sunday afternoon. The last of the bodies was found around 2 pm. 

 The injured man, Srikanta Thakur, was admitted to Calcutta National Medical College and doctors treating him said the injuries in his head were critical.

 Of the five others injured, three ? Probir Das, alias Khokon, Rishikesh Prasad, alias Babloo, and Peter Das, alias Tridib ? are residents of Library Road, under Taltala police station. The Tata Sumo was being driven to the city down Basanti Road. 

 ?It is still not clear how the driver lost control of the vehicle. The road takes a sharp turn at the point from which the car skidded off. We did try to fish out the bodies at night, but failed because of the darkness,? said a senior officer of Tiljala police station. 

 According to the staff of the Mominpur-based catering agency, the six were part of a team that went to Bantala on assignment. While the others left the venue on their own, the six youths decided to return in the car so that they could be dropped home, one by one.

 Apart from some of the utensils, the car was carrying food items, including bottles of sauce and ketchup. Joginder Jaiswara was driving the vehicle and Srikanta was seated next to him. The rest were occupying the back seat.

 ?We heard a loud noise around 11.45 pm. We noticed the Tata Sumo which had dashed into a tree and a man groaning in pain next to it. From the marks on the edges of the drain, we could make out that some of the men had fallen into the drain,? recounted Monimoy Das, a local youth who lives behind the green project on EM Bypass. 

 A patrol jeep carrying constables of Parama Investigating Centre arrived on the scene and sent a message to Tiljala police station. 

 On Sunday morning around 10, police divers fished out the bodies, the last one being that of Joginder Jaiswara, a 28-year-old resident of Kidderpore. 

 ?He left home around seven yesterday morning. The owner of the Tata Sumo told us about the accident. We are shattered,? said Asha Devi, Joginder?s wife.

 The pearl market has witnessed a significant increase over what it was when we first came into the market. We have plans to set up shop in another four cities by March this year, added the director of Chandrani Pearls.

 The exhibition: On display is a variety of exquisite saris, scarves, quilted bags, throws and bedcovers. 

 The colour palette tilts towards ethnic Indian hues like rusts, creams and oranges and you can spot unique weaving techniques in this exhibition by Bappaditya Biswas and his team of traditional craftsmen from Burdwan and Phulia.

 You can see an interesting range of reversible saris that employ the technique of double cloth weave. Regular weaves like the herringbone also catch the eye. 

 Modern sequins find a place in tiny pockets in the creations. Chanderi with a Bengali twist and jamdani techniques in a modern avatar are some of the other highlights. 

 Voiceover: Our work is not just weaves, but exclusive pieces of art. We play around with various yarns like tussar and cotton to create novel textures. The basic idea is to lend a very contemporary look to the creations while keeping tradition intact. This goes a long way to reach a wider market, says Bappaditya.

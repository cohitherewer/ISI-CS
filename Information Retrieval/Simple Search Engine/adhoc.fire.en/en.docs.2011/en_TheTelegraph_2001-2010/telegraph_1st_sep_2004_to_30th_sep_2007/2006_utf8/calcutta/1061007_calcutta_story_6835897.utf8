 A partial martial

 The power, protocol and discipline that characterise any state establishment is just a carefully-maintained facade for the real sub-terranean system which nurtures and thrives on the crudest kind of patriarchy, egotism, prejudice and sexism. A poignant exposure of corruption of this kind within the highly distinguished portals of the military order, Court Martial makes a scathing comment on the so-called honour, propriety and righteousness of the military class. Jawan Ramchandar is court-martialled for shooting down an officer and wounding another. The extenuating circumstances being inadequate to grant him reprieve, he is sentenced to death. But what is revealed in course of the trial is the harrowing tale of a low-born man. An excellent soldier and sportsman, he is driven by continuous humiliation and deprivation to take the extreme step of attacking his superior, whose crimes against humanity loom large in the evidence accumulated in the case. Direction: Usha Ganguli.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 She has the 

 crowds at her feet

 Ma Durgas pandals have never failed 

 to rope in the numbers. Metro checks out the top draws 

 Sealdah Railway Athletic 

 Club

 The rush reason this year is a 120-ft-high pandal modelled 

 on the Mahabalipuram temple. Also worth noticing are the 

 ornaments on the idols, designed by Chandan Mazumdar of 

 Ranikuthi. The club is celebrating its 59th puja this year. 

 According to an organiser, the crowd built up right from 

 6 pm on Sashthi and there was no let-up till late into a 

 rain-splattered Saptami.

 Kumartuli Park

 The 60-ft-high volcano is generating such footfall that 

 the policeman on duty on Sashthi night reportedly had to 

 call for reinforcements. The fibreglass and plaster 

 of Paris pandal was packed by 11 pm, an organiser 

 said. Like an unexpected surge in Puja 2005, this year, 

 too, is seeing more crowd crush than what the worshippers 

 of the nine-ft idol with steel finish had steeled themselves 

 for. 

 College Square

 The Swaminarayan Temple at College Square is turning pandal-hoppers 

 into devotees. The lighting, by Chandernagore artisans in 

 and around the waterbody, showcases the ordeal of Prince 

 at the bottom of the 60-ft well in Kurukshetra, the infamous 

 head butt by Zidane during the World Cup final and the Jagannath 

 rathyatra. This is one puja which has retained its following 

 over the years.

 Badamtala Ashar Sangha

 The 10-headed Ravana at the entrance is drawing children, 

 as are the dolls of fibreglass, straw, wood and strings. 

 People are lingering in front of the gate for Ravana. 

 We got a Saptami-like crowd on Panchami night itself. The 

 numbers were swelling even on Saptami morning, said 

 an organiser of the puja near Kalighat Metro station.

 Mudiali Club

 The pandal, modelled on a mansion of a zamindar, harks 

 back to a Calcutta illuminated by gaslight. The ekchala 

 idol inside is befitting the theme of the puja in its 72nd 

 edition. We get a surge from Kalighat Metro and Tollygunge 

 Circular Rail stations. This year, even Panchami night was 

 crowded, an organiser said.

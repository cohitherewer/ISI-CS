The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Who makes the fairest of them all

 Base, shadow, blush, 

 kohl, gloss... and the hands that do it right. Metro 

 picks the top five make-up magicians in town 

 ANIRUDDHA 

 CHAKLADAR

 Age: 36.

 In the profession since: 1995.

 Starting point: I always knew that I wanted to do this but it turned out to be my career quite by chance. I began as a teacher in a grooming school where I met model Riya Mitra. She introduced me to Sanchita Kushari Bose of Dream Merchants. Work started coming my way and this is when my profession took a serious turn.

 Looks up to: His guru Pandhari Jukar, along with Mumbai-based artists Mickey Contractor and Cory Walia.

 Signature look: Kohl eyes and nude lips. Aniruddha always exaggerates the eyes with a whole lot of kohl, not just with sweeps of eye shadow.

 Big break: Working with Sharmila Tagore in Rituparno Ghoshs Shubho Mahurat. I have always looked up to her and working with her for 15 days, almost 14 hours a day was mind-blowing. In fact, we are still in touch through SMS, he smiles.

 Has worked on: Leading Tollywood actresses right from Indrani Halder to Swastika Mukherjee, along with top-notch models like Indrani Dasgupta and Nethra Raghuraman.

 Wants to work on: Angelina 

 Jolie. She seems to have great skin so I will concentrate 

 only on enhancing her eyes. As for her famous lips, all 

 they need is a sheer hint of gloss.

 ABHIJIT 

 CHANDA

 Age: 24.

 In the profession since: 1999.

 Starting point: I did a professional make-up course in Bangalore and then came back to Calcutta to look for a job. It was then that I happened to meet photographer Rana Bose. We also shot a portfolio together. Eventually, I got to know about event co-ordinators and thus began my career.

 Looks up to: Mickey Contractor, Cory Walia and Aniruddha Chakladar.

 Signature look: The mantra being less is more, his signature look is also very understated and subtle. I am not one for a cakey look. Just kajal with mascara and a hint of blush with some lip gloss.

 Big break: Assisting make-up artists Jojo and Yatan at India Fashion Week 2004. Also, working with Ambika Pillai in the Blenders Pride fashion tour last year.

 Has worked on: Actresses like Hrishita Bhatt, Suman Ranganathan and Moushumi Chatterjee.

 Wants to work on: Sushmita 

 Sen. For her beautiful features. I think I will focus 

 on her eyes alone and that should be more than enough for 

 her.

 ANITA 

 SADHUKHAN

 Age: 45.

 In the profession since: 1994.

 Starting point: I 

 was one of (the late) Prabir Des first students and 

 later accompanied him to all his bridal assignments. Thereafter, 

 he encouraged me to do a lot more work and so my career 

 started rolling.

 Looks up to: Her mentor Prabirda.

 Signature look: She sticks 

 to a very natural base, an almost nude skin tone. For 

 a studio shoot I like pale lips but a bridal get-up always 

 calls for brighter lips.

 Big break: An international shoot in Singapore with actress Locket Chatterjee. Also, the LOreal show in Calcutta last year. 

 Has worked on: Actresses like Rituparna Sengupta and Mouli Ganguly.

 Wants to work on: Hema 

 Malini and Jaya Bachchan. Though they are old their 

 grace and beauty are unmatched. I would keep their look 

 as close to natural ? something that will suit their age 

 and personality.

 MOUSHUMI 

 CHATTERJEE 

 Age: 39.

 In the profession since: 1989.

 Starting point: A friend introduced me to Prabir De and before I knew it, I had enrolled myself in his classes as one of his first students?

 Looks up to: Prabirda.

 Signature look: Is very flexible. Though I am all for a natural look, sometimes a designers shoot requires me to go with the chosen theme. At times like these, the natural look just doesnt work.

 Big break: Working on Koena Mitra for one of her shows. She is now such a huge star that I feel proud to have done up her face.

 Has worked on: Reshmi Ghosh, Celina Jaitley and models Shonal Rawat, Tupur and Tapur Chatterjee.

 Wants to work on: Rani 

 Mukherjee. I think a no make-up look would suit her 

 best. I would like to stick to her filmi look ? smoky 

 eyes and a glossy mouth.

 NABIN 

 DAS 

 Age: 31.

 In the profession since: 1994. 

 Starting point: I used to constantly experiment on my sisters, be it hair or make-up? This is how I figured out what I was truly interested in. Now I really enjoy doing it professionally ? both for brides as well as designer shoots.

 Looks up to: Late Prabir 

 De.

 Signature look: Bright eyes with a dash of glitter. He also specialises in cutting the cheek to pronounce the jaw line. He also believes that very pale lips look too dull and so favours a slight pink or peach glossy mouth.

 Big break: The Satya Paul show at Hyatt Regency Calcutta earlier this month along with shoots with designers like Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Kiran Uttam Ghosh.

 Has worked on: Actresses Mona Jassi Singh, Mandira Bedi and Perizaad Zorabian; model Yukta Mookhey. 

 Wants to work on: Amitabh Bachchan. Well, if I get the chance to touch his face, I think I will surely faint! If and when I recover, I would keep his make-up very subtle and natural.

 After Big B, Nabin would like to dab the grease paint on Aishwarya Rai. Ill give her a smudged smoky look with slight blush on the cheekbones and pale lips.

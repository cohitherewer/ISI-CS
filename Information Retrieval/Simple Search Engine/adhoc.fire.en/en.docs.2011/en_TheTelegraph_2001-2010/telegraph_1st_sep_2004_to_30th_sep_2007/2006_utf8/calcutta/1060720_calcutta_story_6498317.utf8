The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Haven for helpless and depressed

 SUBHRO SAHA 

 CARING AND SHARING: School children feed an injured camel at Ashari. A Telegraph picture

 Maianne Ben-David, a school student from Kent, UK, was visiting her grandparents in Calcutta earlier this year. A keen animal-lover and aspiring to study veterinary science, she was delighted to be allowed to help the distressed animals at Ashari, an NGO-run animal hospital-cum-shelter in Mukundapur, off the Bypass. 

 She became so attached to the place and the animals that, on her return, raised a handsome amount by motivating classmates and neighbours and had her school wire the sum across. 

 The joy Maiyanne derived from comforting an injured cat or a diseased dog at the quiet Bypass idyll can now be shared by other schoolchildren across the city as well. 

 ?There is so much competition and pressure to perform in today?s world, that we often hear about children suffering from depression. Nothing can be a better stress-buster than spending some time with innocent, often helpless, animals in the cusp of Nature. Keeping this in mind, we are approaching schools to send their students over to Ashari on short excursions as an alternative to nature clubs,? says Debasis Chakrabarti, managing trustee of People for Animals (PFA), which runs the facility. 

 Child and adolescent psychiatrist J.R. Ram agrees. ?There?s no denying that children often have a very special chemistry with animals. They feel animals can read and respond to their emotions, which itself is therapeutic, more so when we consider the growing stress levels in school. Such an excursion can also be a wonderful learning curve for the child, since he/she learns about caring and sharing,? Ram observes.

 With its out-patient and in- patient departments, diagnostics and surgery, cattle and equine shelters, dog adoption centre, holiday boarding facility for pets, captive waterbody and wetland system for waste recycling, Ashari offers a plethora of pluses ?for anyone suffering from depression?, feels Chakrabarti.

 Another wing at Ashari that could interest students is the Informatorium, which offers a library, multimedia-supported training unit ?with continuous upgradation?, and an awareness package for owners, handlers and para-vets.

 ?Our vets often spot wrong handling methods and lack of awareness among pet-owners who come to Ashari to hand over their loved ones,? adds Purnima Toolsidass of Compassionate Crusaders Trust, PFA?s strategic partner, which chips in with ambulance, mobile trauma care, dog-lifting van, emergency mobike, pet burial and memorial facility.

 And those who would simply like to spend some time in the greens, can try their hand at gardening at Ashari?s herbal garden. The hospital also has a round-the-clock animal helpline, guestroom for foreign volunteers, mobile cattle-care unit, rabies-control van, rescue van, wildlife rescue van and three-wheeler village ambulance.

 Boy appeal for help

 - POLICE OPEN TO ALL POSSIBILITIES

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fourteen-year-old Anil Yadav with his parents Jiten and Kaushalya

 ?They are forcibly keeping me here. Please save me,? 14-year-old Anil Yadav implored his uncle over the phone on Monday afternoon, more than 24 hours after he went missing from his Howrah residence. 

 Anil?s father Jiten works for a transport company and wasn?t home when his only son disappeared around 1 pm on Sunday. He has lodged a complaint with Howrah police. 

 ?We have launched an investigation into the matter and have activated our sources to determine the whereabouts of the boy,? said Kalyan Banerjee, additional superintendent of police (town).

 Residents of 29, Banbehari Bose Road, the Yadavs are traumatised by the disappearance. Anil, a student of Class VI in a local school, was studying in his room on Monday afternoon, when he ?suddenly went out, telling his mother and sister that he would be right back?, stated Jiten.

 ?We have searched everywhere ? the homes of his acquaintances, classmates and relatives, and even hospitals, but to no avail,? he lamented.

 The tension of the family mounted on Monday after uncle Bablu Yadav received the call from his nephew around 4 pm. ?Anil was sobbing. He told me that some people had taken him to an unknown place and were keeping him captive,? the uncle recounted. Hearing this, Anil?s mother Kaushalya lost consciousness.

 On being asked about the motive behind the alleged abduction, father Jiten said: ?We don?t have a clue.? 

 ?I asked Anil to describe the place he was calling from, but he kept sobbing and could not answer my question. I questioned him about the abductors, but before he could answer, the call was disconnected,? recalled Bablu. 

 ?The number from which the boy called his uncle was stored in the call register of the cell phone. We are trying to trace the number. It doesn?t seem to be from the state,? said an investigating officer.

 ?The call changed the direction our probe was taking. We have asked all our sources to be on the alert. We are investigating the case from all points of view,? the officer added.

 Police cannot yet say for certain whether Anil was abducted and nothing can be ruled out.

 ?He is my only son. Please bring him back to me. I can?t live without him,? cried Kaushalya.The neighbours, too, are upset by the disappearance.

 ?He was such a nice boy. A bit naughty, but who isn?t at his age? We can?t believe that this happened to him,? said one of them.

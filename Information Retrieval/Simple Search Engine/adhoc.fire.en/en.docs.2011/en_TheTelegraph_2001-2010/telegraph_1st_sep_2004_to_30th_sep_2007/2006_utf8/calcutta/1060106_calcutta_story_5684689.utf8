The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Come winter, big-bang beat feast

 - EFFORTS ON FOR ICONIC FEST AS CALLING CARD

 Steely Dan and Srinivas, or Derek Trucks and Debasish Bhattacharya? Maybe, even the Allman Brothers Band with Amjad Ali Khan.

 Efforts are on to stitch together a big-bang international music festival in town that will feature top-notch western exponents of jazz, blues, mainstream and progressive rock, sharing stage and mixing console with leading lights of Indian classical gharanas.

 ?An iconic music fest in Calcutta, on the lines of Montreal or Montreaux, would put the city on the world music map and act as a tourism driver,? feels Souvik Dutta, president of AbstractLogix, working in tandem with Congo Square to roll out the beat feast next winter.

 The international music label based in North Carolina has under its belt a roster of top-notch artistes, including the likes of guitar gurus John McLaughlin, Carlos Santana and Frank Zappa, besides contemporary string sultans Alan Holdsworth and Jimmy Herring, both expected to perform in Calcutta this year.

 ?Mumbai has its Jazz Yatra and Pune its Sai Gandharva Music Festival, both of which have great recall even beyond our shores. If we can strike the right balance between creative music and commercial concerns, there?s no reason why we can?t pull it off in Calcutta, which has one of the most discerning audiences,? says Dutta.

 Mandolin maestro U. Srinivas, who played in Calcutta with McLaughlin on the Remember Shakti set last January, is expected to be back in next winter?s fest, along with city-bred classical slide guitarist Debasish Bhattacharya, Herring and Swedish bass ace Jonas Hellborg.

 Through Herring, who has played with them, and the band?s current guitarist Derek Trucks, AbstractLogix is hopeful of getting even The Allman Brothers Band to Calcutta. Keen to ?bring quality music? to the city he grew up in, Souvik, owner of the big-ticket label, is not ruling out the possibility of even Santana and Jeff Beck strumming their strings in this city starved of big acts.

 ?There are so many big-time musicians we have published and many of them are keen to come and perform in Calcutta without really looking at making money from the shows. However, even to cover for the basics like airfare and accommodation, we will need active corporate support and at least one blue-chip firm to commit big,? stresses Dutta.

 Ashok Banerjee of Congo Square agrees money has been the principal roadblock to the city hosting giant acts. ?But things are changing and over the past three years, we have been able to bring in a clutch of extremely talented jazz, blues and jazz-rock artistes to Calcutta,? he says.

 Congo Square is hopeful that ?if we can kick off one major festival spread across three or four days, which could become Calcutta?s calling card?, sponsors would willingly come on board. ?It would also bring in international tourists doing this circuit, who wouldn?t come to Calcutta for DJ nights and belly-dancers, let?s face it,? adds Dutta.

 To begin with, AbstractLogix ? which is also involved in worldwide publicity and marketing of all the music it releases ? and Congo Square are looking at a budget of around Rs 30 lakh for a three-day event of ?top-quality? East-West fusion in the city. ?Top corporates spend that amount in a two-minute TV commercial. Just imagine the kind of recall a signature event like this could have,? Dutta emphasises.

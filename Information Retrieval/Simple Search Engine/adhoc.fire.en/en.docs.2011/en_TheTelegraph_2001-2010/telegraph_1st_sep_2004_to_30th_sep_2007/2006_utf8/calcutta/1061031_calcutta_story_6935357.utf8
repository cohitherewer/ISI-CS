The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Survival Kit

You cant get through this week without

 Feasting on fashion

After Delhi, it is Mumbais turn to strut its stuff. The big fat fashionable 

debate is back with a bang. Catch Lakme Fashion Week Spring-summer 2007 edition 

on the telly and in GoodLife. The designer line-up might be dwindling with 

most biggies pulling out of the Lakme camp, but with Bollywood gearing up to make 

it a star-studded extravaganza anyway, who cares! Watch out for Narendra Kumar, 

Priyadarshini Rao, Wendell Rodricks, Vikram Phadnis, Surily Goel and others unveil 

their collections. 

The Calcutta connection, both new and old, is burning bright. Watch Abhishek Dutta 

make his LFW debut and Dev amp; Nils stunning silhouettes. Cheer 

for citys GeneratioNext Ajeet Mishra and Amit Vijaya and save the best for 

last Sabyasachi Mukherjees grand fashion finale.

Welcoming winter

The sweaty, summery grind is over. Thank god. With the Celsius dropping slowly, 

its time to embrace the cold, or at least gear up to do so. Prep yourself 

with dollops of moisturiser, lip balm, endless mugs of hot drinking chocolate, 

fluffy duvets and favourite reading material. Its also time for a wardrobe 

switch, colour palette et al. Make space for some colourful woollens and stash 

the strap tops away. Bring on the closed shoes, headgear and all things layered.

Have a lawn get-together to kickstart the official party season. Barbecue, beer 

and buddies bonding never had it so good.

 Planning to catch Ash-Abhishek

Amitabh Bachchan has declared that he wants his son married. He also wants a grandson 

soon. The Bolly buzz is loud and going by what is overheard, the big day is fast 

approaching. What better way to catch Abhishek-Ash the coveted couple in action 

 than in JP Duttas Umrao Jaan. Releasing November 3, this is surely 

not one to miss.

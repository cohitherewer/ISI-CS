 Take a look: The store was inaugurated by interior designer and architect Sandeep Chadha. The launch of this 150 sq ft showroom also saw the unveiling of two new wall and wood finish collections from Pidilite. Renaissance, one of the wall-finish ranges, draws inspiration from great artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael. Currently, there are five varieties to choose from. Showcase, the collection of wood finish, offers five looks from glossy to matte.

 Six more showrooms are in the pipeline in town. Across the country, 250 showrooms should up shutters by March 07.

 Customers now want special effects in their home interiors 

 and are ready to spend. The variety in the showroom will 

 meet such requirements, said Nabankur Paul, marketing 

 manager, Pidilite Industries.

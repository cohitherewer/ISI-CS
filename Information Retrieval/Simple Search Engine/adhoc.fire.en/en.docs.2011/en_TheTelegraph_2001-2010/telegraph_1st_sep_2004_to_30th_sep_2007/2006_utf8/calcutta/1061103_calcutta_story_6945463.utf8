Bridgette Jones.

 Take a look: Beauty is always a big draw among women and when the tips came from Bridgette Jones, it ensures a full house. The expert shared tips on skin and hair care as well as the do and dont of make-up application. 

 Age is not just about numbers but how one feels. Ageing is an inevitable process, but can be slowed by combining a healthy diet and proper skin care, said Bridgette.

 First up was knowing what your body wants. For this, she prescribed lots of greens along with mineral and vitamin supplements. 

 Bridgette prescribed consulting a nutritional adviser. If you are confused, go for a multi-vitamin and mineral supplements that will provide the recommended daily amount of essential vitamins and minerals, she added.

 The must-avoid items on Bridgettes list included smoking, alcohol, consumption of excess oily fatty foods, sugar and caffeine. 

 Next, the session threw light on skin care covering different skin types. Along with daily cleansing, toning and moisturising, Bridgette stressed the importance of exfoliating skin with a mild scrub once a week.

 Problems like dark circles, acne and blemishes were also touched upon. Bridgette recommended H20+, a natural water-based brand (available at Health Shoppe) for instant rejuvenation of skin.

 The workshop then moved on to hair care tips and how hair spa treatments could be done at home. Gently massage your scalp to boost circulation and give health back to the hair naturally. Identify your hair type and use a suitable shampoo and conditioner, stressed Bridgette. At the end of the session, the ladies lapped up some effective make-up tricks.

 Voiceover: This is an effort to create awareness about how to take care of oneself and enjoy a better quality of life, said Deepak Saraf, managing director, Health Shoppe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Left-handed civic self-realisation

 No doubt with justification, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has often been accused of neglecting the work for which it collects a substantial sum of taxes from the public.

 It can be held responsible for the shabby look of most buildings that gives the city a sad appearance, for craters and mountains of garbage on most roads, for waterlogging after every drizzle, illegal constructions that can be sanctioned by greasing palms, and street lights that leave many neighbourhoods in the dark. 

 Corruption is so rife that the civic body has won the sobriquet of Chorporation, the English equivalent of chor being thief. 

 But this avalanche of daily criticism has always fallen on the deaf ears of our city fathers. Nobody would accuse them of being sensitive souls. 

 But the website, http://www.kolkatamycity.com/kolkata_history.asp tells a different story of either an extreme case of self-criticism or sheer apathy. This is the official website of the CMC.

 When we logged in on Friday afternoon, we found that the website begins with the history of Calcutta the familiar story of how Modern Kolkata was founded in 1690 by British trader Job Charnock as a trading post of the English East India Company.

 It continues with the establishment of the old Fort William to protect British interests in what is now Dalhousie Square and the attack of Siraj-ud-Dawlah on the garrison. 

 Clive recaptured the fort and, thereafter, the British reinforced their position in what became the thriving City of Palaces. The city eventually had the largest concentration of trading establishments in India, and a Western-style business district evolved by the end of the 19th Century, adds the website. 

 Post-Independence, the former European quarters were either turned into residences of the Indian rich or, as in the Park Street area, into commercial areas.

 Then comes the howler, worth quoting in full: With the dominance of leftist political parties in the Bangla state government in the late 1960s, Kolkatas municipal government also came to be controlled by Communists. Corruption and bureaucratic inefficiencies caused city services to deteriorate under this government, and today Kolkata is one of the most ill-serviced and chaotic metropolises of the world.

 No wonder, they say, the devils in the detail.

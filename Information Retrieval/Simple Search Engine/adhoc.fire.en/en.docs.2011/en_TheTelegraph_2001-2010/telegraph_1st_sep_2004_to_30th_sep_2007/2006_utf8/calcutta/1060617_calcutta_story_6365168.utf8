The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Our cup, their 

 Cup

 Hours before Spain takes on Tunisia 

 in the World Cup on June 19, schoolboys from Calcutta and 

 its suburbs will kick-off Shootout ?06 ? the TTIS 

 5-a-side football tournament that will give them a chance 

 to play out their Cup fantasies closer home.

 Sixty-four senior school teams 

 ? double the number playing in Germany ? have already signed 

 up for the annual meet to be held at CC amp;FC from June 

 19 to 30. Sixteen junior school teams have also registered. 

 Five matches will be played every day, simultaneously on 

 four pitches.

 The captain?s meet on the club 

 premises on June 15 was where most team skippers and their 

 coaches met and mingled. Once the rules and regulations 

 of the competition were spelt out, many who had previously 

 participated in the contest assessed where they stood this 

 year.

 Prosenjit Pandit, captain of defending 

 champions North Point School, looked very much the footballer 

 with what one can only assume to be a ?World Cup haircut? 

 and an earring that would make even a certain Mr Beckham 

 raise an eyebrow. The striker believes his side has what 

 it takes to go the whole way again, just like his idols 

 Ronaldo and Co. Prosenjit brushed off the fact that two 

 of his last year?s title-winning team members will be missing 

 in action: ?I don?t believe that will affect our performance; 

 we are just as strong.?

 It would be misleading, however, 

 to assume that North Point will easily dribble its way to 

 a successful title defence, for there are plenty of teams 

 sure to put a serious fight. None more so than last year?s 

 runner-up Julien Day Ganganagar, back with a reinvigorated 

 team brimming with confidence. Like his favourite team Argentina, 

 captain Nizamuddin Khan wants the boys to aim for the top. 

 ?We are coming back much stronger this year, with changes 

 to our forward line that will give us a good chance. We 

 have put in lots of preparation and expect to win.?

 With most reputed schools from 

 the city and suburbs in the fray, showcasing individual 

 skills is also on the agenda. ?This is the first time that 

 I am playing in an inter-school football match. Since there 

 will be just five players in each side, a good one will 

 get spotted easily,? reasoned Sumit Dey of Class VIII, Children?s 

 Foundation. In 2004, CC amp;FC had chosen two budding talents 

 from the tournament to play in its official team.

 The backdrop of the World Cup 

 has certainly added more excitement to the inter-school 

 meet. It was clear that the school team captains harboured 

 the dream that their teams ?match skills? with their heroes 

 in Germany. Mongal Das, captain of Future Hope School, summed 

 it up: ?Brazil and Ronaldinho are my favourites. We hope 

 to do as well in this competition as they do in the World 

 Cup.?

 When the players are so charged 

 up, their coaches must be almost as animated as Australia?s 

 Guus Hiddink. ?The World Cup has definitely increased the 

 enthusiasm this year, with the boys putting in lots of practice 

 in anticipation of the five-a-side tournament,? smiled Santanu 

 Basu, a teacher of Patha Bhavan Dankuni, reflecting on the 

 mood among the participating teams.

 The diary ? poets? corner

 Silence

 I met her standing by the river, 

 Where tiny leaves were made to quiver, 

 By the gently stroking breeze.

 She was gentle, yet forceful, 

 She was grave, yet beautiful, 

 In her eyes I found a long-lost friend, 

 Snatched away from me by a fiend. 

 I suddenly seemed to have 

 Stumbled into a new world, 

 That exists in pauses 

 That is present between words. 

 I asked her where she came from 

 Why was she not often in sight? 

 She took out a piece of paper 

 On it she did write ?

 ?Wherever words end their loud whisper 

 Where noises seem to cease 

 Wherever there is no sound of the echo, 

 You will find me.?

 We met very often, 

 Became great friends, 

 I did not know what her name was, 

 So I called her Silence.

 Vague Darkness

 My deeds define what must be true

 But thoughts truly identify me 

 I sail through life ? that bitter sea 

 I fight to keep my sanity, 

 The pain I endure sometimes becomes me, 

 My bitter sweet legacy. 

 Joy and sorrow, truth behold 

 Will time complete me and make me whole 

 I stare at you, a distant figure 

 I swear at you, a constant pain 

 Pray forgive the manner of my speech 

 It?s what I know, it?s all you teach 

 I question violence, a prayer for silence... 

 Will we learn or will they stray; 

 Anxious times! These vaguely visible days...

 Martial art

 A dance workshop was held from 

 June 1 to 8 at Paschim Bangla Rajya Sangeet Academy. It 

 was conducted by Thang-ta expert Imocha Singh, Manipuri 

 danseuse Preeti Patel and Abira Majumdar?s Mudra Creative 

 Dance Centre. The workshop, based on the ancient martial 

 art of Thang-ta, helped the participants boost energy, build 

 concentration and improve body posture. Participating in 

 the workshop were three special children with Down?s Syndrome, 

 who were just as good as the rest.

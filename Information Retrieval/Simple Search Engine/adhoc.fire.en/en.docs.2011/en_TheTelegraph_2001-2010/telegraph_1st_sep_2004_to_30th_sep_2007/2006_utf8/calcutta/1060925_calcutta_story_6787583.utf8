 Shift signal in JEE format

 - Question pattern, single-day test under consideration

 MITA MUKHERJEE

The state joint entrance examination (JEE) format next year may be similar to that of the admission tests of the IITs or the All-India Engineering Entrance Examinations conducted by the Centre.

 Unlike the present practice of staggering the test through two days, the JEE is likely to be held on a single day from 2007, and the multiple-choice questions (MCQ), introduced this year, may give way to a combination of objective-type and short-answer questions.

 Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury will meet vice-chancellors of various universities next week to finalise the changes, officials said.

 There are some proposals on revising the JEE format. Once the changes are finalised, we will announce them in the media, said N.R. Banerjea, vice-chancellor, Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), and chairman of the JEE board. 

 Heads of all institutions running engineering and technological courses such as Besu, Jadavpur University and West Bengal University of Technology will attend the meeting.

 Sources said the meeting will consider a proposal on holding the JEE on a single day, like that of the IIT admission test, and another on changing the question pattern. A section of teachers has suggested introduction of short-answer questions.

 Teachers feel the system of setting multiple-choice question should be revised, as it is not in tune with the Higher Secondary (HS) system of education, on which the JEE curriculum is mostly based. 

 The MCQ pattern does not match the HS system. The board should either abolish it or adopt a combination of multiple-choice and short-answer questions, said an engineering teacher of a state-run university.

 Several students who had scored high marks in HS 2006 either failed to make it to the JEE merit list or ranked abnormally low. 

 Topper Subhankar Roy Chowdhury, who had s cored a phenomenal 99.9 per cent 999 out of 1000 in the HS, ranked below 1500 in the JEE.

 Teachers attribute the trend to the HS students unfamiliarity with MCQ.

 Students from other boards, that follow a combination of multiple-choice, short and long-answer questions, have done much better. Though teachers have also observed that several JEE-qualifiers from other boards fared poorly in their Plus II exams.

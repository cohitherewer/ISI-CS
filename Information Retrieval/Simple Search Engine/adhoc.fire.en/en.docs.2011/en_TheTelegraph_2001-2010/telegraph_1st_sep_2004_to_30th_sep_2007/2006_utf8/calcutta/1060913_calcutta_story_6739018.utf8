The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The fresh underground water flowing out of the roadside 

 taps is often wasted. The scenario is quite bad in the Chandni 

 Chowk area. Water flows out of taps round the clock. This 

 water accumulates in the potholes and often serves as breeding 

 grounds for insects like mosquitoes. It is quite unhygienic 

 and also causes inconvenience to pedestrians. I request 

 the civic authorities to check the water wastage here and 

 supply it to areas which are facing water shortage.

 Though the government is assuring that security arrangements 

 across the city are fool-proof, sadly many loopholes still 

 remain. Recently, while travelling by the metro, I saw that 

 the policemen on duty in the station were snoring. With 

 this kind of attitude in those in charge of our security, 

 it will be quite difficult for us to check terrorism.

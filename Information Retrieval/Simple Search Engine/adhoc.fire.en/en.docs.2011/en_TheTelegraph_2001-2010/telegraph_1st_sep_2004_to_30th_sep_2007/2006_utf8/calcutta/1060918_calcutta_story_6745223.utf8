 Land-use code for Rajarhat fringes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Bhangar Rajarhat Area Development Authority has prepared a land use map and land register for the area around New Town, Rajarhat. 

 The government agency is responsible for monitoring development activities in the zone.

 About 15 mouzas, including Bhatendra, Khamar, Bishnupur, Kalaberia, Basina, Chhoto Chandpur, Jamalpara, Umarhati, Kalikapur, Kashinathpur, Sikharpur, Jhalgachhi, Ganrageri, Naoabad and Hudarait all under the jurisdiction of Rajarhat police station come under the purview of the agency.

 Officials said the map will be put on display for the public at the agencys office in New Town. The owners of the plots shown in the map can apply for correction of the data to the authorities within 30 days of the map being put up.

 According to rules, it is mandatory for land-owners in the area around New Town to obtain an approval from the agency before purchasing or selling the plots. 

 All plans, from that for a house to a tubewell, in Bhangar and Rajarhat need to be cleared by the agency.

 The Bhangar Rajarhat Area Development Authority was formed to check the free run of land sharks in the area adjoining New Town. The move followed a recommendation by a 12-member committee, headed by former IIT Kharagpur professor and planning adviser to the state government R.L. Muni Chakraborty. The panel was asked to prepare a guideline on land use and development patterns on the New Town fringes. 

 The committee had suggested a 25-year master plan and strict monitoring of land use for the peripheral areas of New Town to prevent a collapse of the township infrastructure.

 We do not have any intention of preventing owners from using their land as they wish. But we want the development to be planned. Unplanned activities in the neighbouring areas will affect New Towns master plan, stated housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb.

 The emergence of New Town, which will have modern infrastructure and amenities, has set promoters on the prowl, eager to cash in on the spin-offs on the fringes. 

 Large chunks of land have already been grabbed by private developers on the surrounding area. The cost of land on the fringes of the township has gone up manifold. 

 We want to prevent the area from becoming an unplanned concrete jungle. This is for the benefit of the people living close to the township. We are in the process of preparing a master plan for a comprehensive development of the periphery, claimed minister Deb.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City Lights

 Name of the dance game 

 Shiamak Davar rehearses 

 with his students in the city 

 It?s time to hit the dance floor 

 and, well, dance. Shiamak Davar?s Institute of Performing 

 Art?s (SDIPA), in association with Incorporated Business 

 Consultants (IBC), is starting its summer workshop from 

 April 12. With training in dance forms like jazz, hip hop, 

 rock ?n? roll, Afro-jazz, salsa, Shiamak?s Indo-jazz and 

 Shiamak?s Bollywood jazz, shaking a leg promises to be both 

 a creative exercise and a fun way to lose those extra kilos.

 If ?a performing arts experience? is the aim, ?complete dance routines? is the game. So sign up for your sessions at Bhawanipur College, from 5 pm to 8 pm. This year, classes will be held in three batches ? two at the Elgin Road college and one in Alipore, from 4 pm to 8.30 pm. The total student capacity is 500 to 800.

 ?If the response is good, then we will definitely start regular classes in Calcutta from July. This is a common query we face from Calcuttans. In this city, we have found that people prefer something on a regular basis, rather than on-off workshops, unlike in Mumbai. So that is our aim,? explains Swati Gupta, CEO, IBC.

 So far, the response has been ?terrific?, she adds, especially since the workshop is back after a full year, with no winter workshop in between. ?Some of our regulars are back, along with new students,? says Swati, adding that participants in Calcutta cover a cross-section, from students to professionals and housewives, eager to sign up for a dose of Shiamak Davar training. ?A mother of two teenaged daughters is one of our regulars. Sometimes several family members sign up together,? she offers.

 The star attraction, of course, is the chance to meet the man who makes the biggest stars in Bollywood dance to his moves and to share the spotlight on the Science City stage at the Summer Funk show on May 9. That is the grand finale for the participants, a chance to showcase their skills at the end of the workshop. This year there will be ?something special?, smiles Swati.

 Also on the cards is a Calcutta-specific online newsletter, which will kick off from August-end, with news and gossip to keep members updated.

 Under the Dancing Feat programme, the Mumbai-based dance institute trains underprivileged children from NGOs and various other welfare organisations. Last year, underprivileged kids from Apeejay School?s social service projects were taught to dance. This year, the evening school students of Don Bosco Park Circus will get the opportunity.

 ?The trainers will go to the school and work with the children there,? adds Swati. These underprivileged youngsters will then perform with the other participants at the Summer Funk show at Science City auditorium, while their parents watch from the audience.

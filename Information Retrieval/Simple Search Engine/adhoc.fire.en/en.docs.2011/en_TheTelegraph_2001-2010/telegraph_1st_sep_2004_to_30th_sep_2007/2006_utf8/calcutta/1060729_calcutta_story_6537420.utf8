Post-Puja, the fashion queen who famously fainted at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles (LA) on July 23, may come sashaying down the city streets. 

 ?We are excited about coming to 

 Calcutta,? LA-based fashion designer Sanjana Jon told Metro 

 from New York on Friday. 

 It is Sanjana?s company IG International 

 which is bringing the beauty queen down to India on the 

 IG International AIDS Awareness Tour with Miss Universe. 

 According to the company?s chairperson Shashi Abraham, who is setting up the tour, Miss Puerto Rico Zuleyka Rivera Mendoza?s dates in India are from October 23 to November 8. The tie-ups for Calcutta will take ?another 15 days to be finalised?, she said. 

 A walk for AIDS and a fashion show, where Miss Universe will take the ramp, with the group of accompanying models from New York, are likely to be common features at each stop.

 Jon was there to witness the young Puerto Rican get crowned. If she collapsed during the post-pageant news conference, Jon ascribes it to the heat of LA on the day. ?And she is just an 18-year-old. All the excitement, hundreds of flashbulbs popping? that?s too much.?

 Later, when Jon met her at the coronation ball, Zuleyka was thrilled to know about her India tour. ?She said her predecessor Natalie Glebova had told her about her great experience in the country.? 

 IG International is bringing Miss Universe to India since 2004 under the tagline ?Get Tested. It?s in Fashion?.

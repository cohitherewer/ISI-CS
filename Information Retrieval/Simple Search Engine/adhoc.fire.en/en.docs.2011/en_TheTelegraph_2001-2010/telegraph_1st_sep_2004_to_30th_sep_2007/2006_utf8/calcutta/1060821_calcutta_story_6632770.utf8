 Do you want to know how good your son is in math vis--vis children his age in the other city schools? Is your childs science teacher up there in the international bracket? Is his school lagging behind others in the country?

 The University of New South Wales is offering such a test to Calcutta schools, in collaboration with Macmillan India. We have been conducting the International Competition for Assessments since 1994. This is the third year were in India, said Matt Henderson, development manager of International Assessment, a wing of the Australian university.

 We dont just do the assessments, we work with the local education authority, he explains, recounting how the South African government had wanted something for the Class IXs. India is the only country where the body has tied up with a private company.

 The tests in Calcutta will be in math, science and computer skills. The content will be the same as for a kid in Australia, New Zealand or Hong Kong. Only cultural adjustments will be made by way of changing names and currencies. The questions are skill-based, not linked to a particular syllabus.

 Relative grading will bring out the strengths and weaknesses of individuals as well as the class. We can show a principal how his or her Class IV is faring in comparison with the Class IVs of the rest of the country. Just as an individual is taken to be lagging if he gets less than his classmates, if the class average falls far below the country average, the principal can find out if the teacher needs help or resources are lacking in some other way, Henderson pointed out.

 Strengths and weaknesses of students of a country are thrown up this way. Children of Singapore are fantastic with spellings, where that is a separate subject for testing.

 The test has found a good response in Calcutta, with Henderson meeting a spectrum of school heads at a seminar. Schools like Vivekananda Mission, Joka, and Aditya Academy, Dum Dum, and South Point attended the seminar, a Macmillan official said. 

 Indias test date falls this year on November 3 and 4. Students of classes III to XII can sit for it. The data will be sent to us electronically. Our role will be that of interpreters, Henderson concluded.

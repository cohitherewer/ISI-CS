The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scam over Bypass plot

 - Rs 25 lakh paid to 50 people for land allotted to hospital

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI 

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has unearthed a scam over acquiring an EM Bypass plot to set up a Coal India hospital during Mamata Banerjee?s tenure as coal minister. 

 After a year?s probe, the Calcutta branch of the CBI has found that Rs 25 lakh was defalcated by officials of Coal India Limited (CIL). They allegedly paid the amount to 50 people, who were not cultivating the plot, in the name of acquiring the land for the construction of the hospital.

 ?Those 50 people were not cultivating the land. The CIL officials paid Rs 25 lakh as compensation to people who were not entitled to it,? asserted a senior CBI officer. 

 In a report to the Union coal ministry, a copy of which is with the Metro, the officers of the CBI anti-corruption wing mentioned how some officials ?abused their financial position as public servants and caused wrongful loss to the CIL?.

 Chief general manager of CIL, Calcutta, R.K. Saha, said: ?There was a proposal to set up a hospital on that particular plot but that has been shelved. We had got the land from the CMC for the purpose, but the plan did not take off.?

 According to the CBI officers, CIL, in 2004, had proposed to set up a hospital for its employees in Calcutta, along the lines of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

 Mamata Banerjee sanctioned the proposal and Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) offered CIL a plot on the Bypass. The company chairman sent a letter, dated January 30, 2004, to the municipal commissioner, informing him that his representatives had inspected the plot and CIL was ready to acquire it.

 A memorandum of understanding was signed between the CIL and the CMC on January 31, 2004. Mamata Banerjee laid the foundation stone at the site on February 1, 2004.

 On January 31, 2004, the value and survey department of the civic body had informed the company that 47 people were cultivating the 10.60-acre plot allotted to the hospital.

 ?Neither in the MoU nor in the letter was CIL asked to pay any compensation to the cultivators. But it later paid Rs 50,000 each to 50 people. The payment was endorsed by the chief general manager (finance) and the director (finance) and was approved by the company chairman. The payment to 50 people was made by cheques drawn on United Bank of India (Royal Exchange Branch) on February 5, 2004,? the CBI report held.

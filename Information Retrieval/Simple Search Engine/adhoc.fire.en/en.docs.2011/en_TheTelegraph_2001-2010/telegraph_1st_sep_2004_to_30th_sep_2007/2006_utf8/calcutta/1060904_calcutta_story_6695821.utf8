The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High roads for car flow

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 To decongest the Ultadanga intersection, the government has taken up a project to build a flyover between Belgachhia and Ultadanga and a bridge over Kestopur canal, near the southern end of VIP Road.

 Belgachhia Milk Colony, near Belgachhia Metro station on Jessore Road, will be one end of the flyover. It will stretch a km to Ultadanga Main Road, 200 m from Ultadanga station. A ramp of the flyover will shoot off to Canal South Road. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 50 crore.

 The three-lane proposed bridge, adjacent to Durgapur bridge, will also terminate at Canal South Road. The bridge will cost about Rs 6.5 crore.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will aim to complete the projects within a year.

 According to urban development department officials, once the projects are ready, vehicles coming from BT Road will be able to reach VIP Road and EM Bypass without passing through the Ultadanga intersection.

 Vehicles from the Shyambazar-Maniktala-Rajabazar area will be able to take Canal East Road and Canal South Road to reach Ultadanga before crossing the new bridge over Keshtopur canal to proceed along VIP Road, explained an official.

 Currently, vehicles from north Calcutta cannot access VIP Road or EM Bypass without passing through congested intersections at Maniktala, Raja Dinendra Street, Kankurgachhi and Ultadanga.

 The projects are very important. People in north Calcutta will benefit the most from them. We have already started preliminary work, including design and drawing. Work should start by the year-end , said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 Our move is aimed at reducing traffic congestion at Ultadanga crossing. The only solution is re-engineering of traffic movement in the area. If we can enable vehicles from both the south and north to take VIP Road skirting the Ultadanga crossing, the traffic chaos at the intersection will ease, Baviskar added.

 Physicians cleared of neglect slur 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Doctors dragged to court on charges of medical negligence should take heart from a recent National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directive.

 In a recent order, the commission dismissed negligence charges filed against doctors of city-based Peerless Hospital and Research Centre by the family of a 16-year-old girl who died there.

 Ankhi Ganguly, 16, was admitted to the hospital withfever and restlessness. She was released after a month. A series of investigations was carried out and a board of medical experts set up. However, the exact cause of the fever could not be diagnosed.

 Within a month of her discharge, Ankhi was re-admitted to the hospital. After more than a month there, she went into a coma and, eventually, she died.

 Ankhi?s father, Tarun Prasad Ganguly, filed a complaint of deficiency in services at the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, alleging that the doctors did not treat her jaundice in time, which led to her death.

 However, the court rejected the charges, although it conceded that no definite diagnosis of the patient could be made by any of the super-speciality doctors. 

 After going through the 150-page hospital record, the commission observed: ?Initially, treatment was given for malaria. Subsequently, the treatment was given for meningitis and TB. As the patient became non-cooperative, a psychiatrist was consulted to ascertain the behaviour pattern of the patient.?

 Nonetheless, the commission observed that there was no deficiency in the hospital?s services.

 ?However, it is established law that a medical practitioner must have a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. A physician cannot assure the patient of full recovery in every case,? the commission observed.

 ?In this case, we find that the doctors who treated Ankhi Ganguly possessed skill and knowledge to handle the case and they have taken due care in deciding what treatment should be given,? it said.

 ?But doctors are also human beings. They can do their best only by what medical science has taught them,? the order stated.

 A recent survey by a Delhi-based voluntary organisation revealed that judgments in nearly 70 per cent of medical negligence cases in various consumer courts of the country went in the doctor?s favour.

 ?It would be difficult to hold a doctor guilty in a medical negligence case,? said Prabir Basu, advocate and a member of the State Consumer Protection Council. 

 Interestingly, since June last year, seven medical negligence cases have been heard in the state commission and verdicts in all the cases went against the doctors and medical institutes.

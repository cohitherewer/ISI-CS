The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Gender bender

 Club 

 sandwich

Cultural personality, actor, events 

 impresario, and now club vice-president. Renu Roy moving 

 into the prized post at Saturday Club could well signal 

 a new beginning on the citys club circuit. Not only is 

 it for the first time in 105 years of the Wood Street clubs 

 history that a lady has been elected vice-president, its 

 a first for Calcuttas colonial social institutions, concur 

 club old-timers.

 While Sofia Chowdhury has been 

 president of Dhaka Club for two years, Renu Roy is the first 

 vice-president of any colonial club in Calcutta, confirms 

 D.J. Banerjea, a historian and Calcutta Club veteran, calling 

 it a breakthrough.

 Renu, who contested the September 

 20 AGM and won, has served on various committees of Saturday 

 Club for the past five years, and been a member of the general 

 committee for the past three years. In the last financial 

 year, she was convenor of the entertainment sub-committee.

 I wish to work closely with the 

 president (A.K. Chatterjee, who defeated challenger Kewal 

 Nayar to the post) and the newly-elected committees to serve 

 in the best interests of the club, promises Renu.

 This is a very positive step, 

 feels Ashok Dutt, past president of CC amp;FC and Tollygunge 

 Club. Clearly, a yawning gender divide has been vaulted. 

 In Saturday Club, ladies have equal voting rights and can 

 hold positions of responsibility on various committees. 

 Bengal Club, CC amp;FC and Tollygunge Club have opened their 

 doors to lady members, but not Calcutta Club.

 Calcutta Club, which celebrates 

 its centenary next year, didnt allow ladies to enter the 

 club through the front gate till 1954 and to venture upstairs 

 till 1970. The club still refuses to take in lady members 

 and only allows members wives to use the club facilities.

 In those days, the British created 

 these social clubs as male bastions so that they could spend 

 some time with friends and colleagues without being bogged 

 down by wives and family. But in todays world, ladies must 

 have equal opportunities, stresses Dutt. 

 Banerjea agrees that the old British 

 idea of a male-only rendezvous doesnt have any relevance 

 in todays world. 

 I think women should be allowed 

 to play a more active role in the citys social clubs, 

 he stresses.

 Renu, executive director of cultural 

 organisation Spandan and director, Spandan Art Gallery, 

 would certainly like to catalyse more cultural activities 

 at the Wood Street rendezvous. Her stage and screen CV is 

 rich with accolades from Khabsoorat Bahu to Unishe 

 April to Pinky and Asha Mary.

 Now, as its first woman lady vice-president, 

 the Saturday Club is her stage.

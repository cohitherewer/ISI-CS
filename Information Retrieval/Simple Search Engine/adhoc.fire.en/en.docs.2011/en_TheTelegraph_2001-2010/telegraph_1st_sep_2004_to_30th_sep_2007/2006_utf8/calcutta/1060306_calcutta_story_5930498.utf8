 The City Diary

 With the arrest of four armed criminals last Thursday night, the Government Railway Police (GRP) in Howrah has stumbled upon a nexus of small-time rackets run by criminals operating on trains and at railway stations. 

 cting on a tip-off, a police team had conducted a raid on a platform in the old complex of Howrah station last Thursday and arrested the men armed with daggers and iron rods. ?We netted four of the gang, some of who were carrying firearms. The rest managed to escape taking advantage of the commotion among commuters. The gang was trying to rob passengers of the last Howrah-Bandel local train,? said an investigating officer.

 he arrested men revealed that there was a nexus among small-time rackets operating on trains and at railway stations across the state and outside it. ?Earlier, small gangs, consisting of not more than 10 persons, used to be involved in dacoities and snatchings on trains. But now, it seems, the gangs are coming together to spread their area of operation,? the officer said.

 ccording to Taj Mohammed, inspector-in-charge of Howrah GRP station, gangs from neighbouring Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa sometimes come to the state, commit crimes and flee. Their counterparts in Bengal supply them information, arms and transport. 

 nspector-in-charge Mohammed said GRP will conduct raids in Calcutta, North and South 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Nadia and other parts of the state to bust this nexus.

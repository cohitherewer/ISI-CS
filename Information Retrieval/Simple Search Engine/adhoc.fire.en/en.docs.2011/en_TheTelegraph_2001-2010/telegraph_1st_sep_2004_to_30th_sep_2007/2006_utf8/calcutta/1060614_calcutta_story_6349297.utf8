The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

My favourite is Brazil. Like us, Indians, they also 

are very volatile and energetic. That way we identify with their soccer tradition. 

Also the people have grown up admiring Pele and his mates. That admiration has 

been passed down the generations. At our shop there has been a definite pick-up 

in sales in the run-up to the World Cup. The jerseys of the top teams, going for 

Rs 300 to 2,500, have been a hit. But we have sold more souvenir balls than actual 

footballs. I would say this tournament will give birth to more couch-potatoes 

than players.

 The Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) is set to prepare a master plan to tackle the perennial problem of waterlogging during the monsoon, when flooded streets stall life in the city. 

 The plan envisages the renovation and further development of the sewerage and drainage systems and services of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), including the facilities and services in adjoining and downstream areas served by the CMC. 

 We are preparing the entire plan quite meticulously and it will be ready by March 2007. To execute it as faultlessly as possible, we are looking for an expert from abroad, said Rajiva Sinha, project director of CEIP. 

 Besides, a 10-member task force will be set up with engineers from CMC, CEIP, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority and the irrigation department for smooth execution. Former engineers from different departments will be inducted in it. 

 We will seek the opinion of these former engineers so that the entire plan becomes flawless. The Consulting Engineering Services will play a vital role in this project on our behalf, he added. 

 The project will be funded by Asian Development Bank. It will be included in the first phase of CEIP projects for which Rs 1,800 crore has been allotted, Sinha said

 An implementation schedule for the project components will be prepared. This will include executable phasing for construction in discussion with the task force members of the departments concerned. 

 The plan will put special emphasis on preservation of environment, public health, financial requirements, economic returns and technical feasibility. 

 According to Sinha, the master plan will provide the CMC with a vision for long and medium-term development of sewerage and drainage. It will also help CMC prepare a short-term and prioritised implementation of the plan.

 The master plan will indicate the cost estimates for implementation and the staged development plan will be subjected to an economic viability analysis, using the economic internal rate of return.

 Jyoti Basu had once stayed in a floating hotel in Saigon and on his return had wished that there was such a property in Calcutta. The veteran politician?s wish should come true in another six weeks.

 The Floatel, ?south Asia?s first four-star floating hotel?, is set to welcome guests on board soon with Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) withdrawing its distraint order (a restraint order pending resolution of a dues dispute) on January 31, following a Supreme Court verdict to that effect issued on January 23.

 So, this summer you can sip your favourite brew at The Bridge (multi-cuisine coffee shop), dine at The Compass (110-seater speciality Indian restaurant-cum-bar), enjoy a Mongolian buffet on the promenade deck, or simply watch the river flow languidly from the air-conditioned comfort of your room.

 ?We are now putting finishing touches to the interiors and will soon announce the date for opening of the property,? Manab Pal, director, Manor Floatel Limited, which owns the floating hotel, tells Metro.

 The basic hull of The Floatel, built in Singapore based on the design solution by Consafe Engineering of Gothenburg, was towed to Calcutta and parked in the Kidderpore Dock for fabrication and interior work. But the shifting of The Floatel to the site by the Strand was stalled following the dispute over dock dues demanded by CPT.

 ?All that?s water under the bridge now. I?m glad we are finally going to make a contribution to Calcutta?s riverfront development initiative and the Strand skyline, and to the overall urban regeneration of the central business district,? observes Pal, who specialised in naval architecture and admiralty law from London School of Economics (LSE).

 Built at a cost of Rs 25 crore, IDBI holds 15 per cent stake in the project with venture capital financing, while 45 per cent is held between the Pal family and its overseas corporate partner International Flowers Inc, Geneva.

 The floating hospitality address will have 55 rooms and three suites, a business centre, specialised elevator, banqueting with buffet facilities, two open decks, conference room, landscaped garden and car park, according to acting general manager Rajiv Singh.

 The hospitality side will be managed by the Orchid group, which runs hotels in Doha, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, besides having a presence in Mumbai and Delhi.

 Pal chose Calcutta because ?it?s 140 miles inshore? and the freshwater would cause less corrosion. ?We will try and turn the turbid water between the two bridges blue through a special naval technology, and create a Geneva fountain to add to the river rides being planned,? he promises.

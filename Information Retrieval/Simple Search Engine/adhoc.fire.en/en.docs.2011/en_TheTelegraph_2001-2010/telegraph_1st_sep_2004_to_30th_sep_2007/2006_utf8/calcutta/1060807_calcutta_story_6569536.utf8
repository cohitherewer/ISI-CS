 Summer wealth and more

 - Masters as well as new faces feature in CIMA Gallerys latest exhibition

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A mixed media work by Indrapramit Roy at the Summer Show of CIMA Gallery

 Besides its other attractions, perhaps the biggest draw of CIMA Gallerys Summer Show, which opened on Friday evening, is its wealth of graphics, including two woodcuts by pioneer Haren Das. 

 But, to begin with, Mokhlesur Rehman, a name with which not many could be familiar in this city. His multi-coloured woodcuts and one in variations of blue and indigo remind one of the rough-hewn surface of stone or the bark of a tree.

 Viewers will be struck by the bold designs of Arun Boses viscosity etchings. Amitabha Banerjees graphic depicts the gate of a garden with a stone wall behind it. It is beautifully detailed. The lines in Somnath Hores colour etchings are taut, like wires under great stress. These are a perfect medium for expressing human suffering in the telling manner that this master does.

 Haren Dass mastery over the medium is seen in his tiny black-and-white woodcuts. The wariness of passengers as they step out of a boat could not have been better depicted. Shafts of light stream through a village shop. The print basks in its own warmth.

 There are single paintings each by Indrapramit Roy and Nalini Malani. Roys work is part of a recent series in which he conjures up interiors in so detailed a manner that they almost look like photographs, but not quite. Nalini Malani, on the other hand, creates a world of her own that has its own mythology and terms of reference.

 S. Harshavardhan uses oil, wax and soft pastels to create landscapes that are primarily geometric shapes in muted shades of blue, red and yellow. The ground plan of a modern flat is laid out in Moloy Sahas acrylic painting. But rain clouds invade the flat and upset the apple cart.

 There are, besides, works by masters. In the midst of all this, one could not miss Shakilas beautiful collage that has the finish of a painting. Partha Pratim Debs drawings with ink stand out for their stark simplicity.

 Sculptures are also on exhibit. Jaya Viveks bronzes are like folk toys in their simplicity. By contrast, Tapas Biswass tubular form is made of an intricate mesh of bronze threads with human forms emerging from them.

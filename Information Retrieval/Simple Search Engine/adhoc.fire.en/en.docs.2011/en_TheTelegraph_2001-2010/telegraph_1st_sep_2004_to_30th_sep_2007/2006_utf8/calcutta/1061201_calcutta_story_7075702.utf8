The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Screen On 

 amp; Off 

 Bong bang

 Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury is on 

 a high after the screening of his first film Anuranon 

 at the 37th International Film Festival of India in 

 Goa. The adman-turned-directors debut shot in London deals 

 with the resonance in human relationships.

 The film played to a full house 

 and we had very interesting reactions from the audience, 

 Chowdhury told Metro. As the name Anuranon suggests, 

 all my characters shone through in perfect harmony.

 Barring Rajat Kapoor, the main 

 cast of the film including Raima Sen (picture left), Rituparna 

 Sengupta and Rahul Bose were present with the director for 

 the world premiere in the Film India World Wide section.

 It was during the question-answer 

 session at the end of the screening that we realised how 

 much everyone had liked our performance, said Raima.

 It was a special moment for Rituparna 

 who was present at the festival for both Anuranon and 

 Saibal Mitras Songshoy. I got red carpet treatment! 

 she gushed. Chowdhury, 

 meanwhile, is gearing up for a commercial release of his 

 debut film by March 2007.

 Wedding ways

 Will you marry me? Also, can 

 I have your phone number please? Thats how actor Sharad 

 Kapoor proposed to Koel Basu (Jyoti Basus granddaughter). 

 We had met through some common 

 friends five years ago, but we didnt really keep in touch, 

 Sharad told Metro. Then I saw her at The Oberoi 

 Grand (where Koel is currently working after completing 

 her course in hospitality) in June and the first thing that 

 crossed my mind was marriage!

 What started out as an out-of-the-blue 

 marriage proposal will find fruition in a closed-door engagement 

 function on December 3 in Calcutta.

 Sharad, who also has the Tangerine 

 connection in town, met Koels mother Dolly and formalised 

 things. He also met her grandfather and is looking forward 

 to spending time with the former Bengal chief minister.

 On being asked whether Sharads 

 celebrity status was cause for concern, Dolly replied: My 

 elder daughter is also married to a well-known photographer 

 and I am very happy that my second girl is now tying the 

 knot.

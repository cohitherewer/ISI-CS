 A topical play that highlights the contradictions between traditional, indigenous culture and the Western culture that holds its sway over modern society, Ramnidhi focuses on a period in Calcutta?s history that existed prior to the emergence of urban culture. Drawing parallels between the past and present, it emphasises on the process of cultural change and the insecurities and clash of beliefs that accompany every transitional phase in society. Set in early 19th century Calcutta, it tells us of the travails of a singer, Kripa Sunri, leader of a group of kabi-gaan performers. With the introduction of the popular tappa musical style by Nidhubabu, Kripa Sunri loses his former patrons one by one, as they now consider it vulgar. He then makes a desperate attempt to learn the new musical form. However, he soon realises that his efforts are in vain as the new cultural ?sensibility? looks down upon and excludes traditional artistes and their forms of entertainment. Direction: Runu Chowdhury.

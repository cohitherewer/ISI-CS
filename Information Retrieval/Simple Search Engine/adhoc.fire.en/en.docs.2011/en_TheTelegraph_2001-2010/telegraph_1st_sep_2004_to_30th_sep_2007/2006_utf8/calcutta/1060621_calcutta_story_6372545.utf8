The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Subhas Chakraborty

 Minister of sports, government of West Bengal 

 I am all for Argentina but I have a feeling that Brazil will win. It is true that Parreira?s boys are not playing as well as expected but they have not exposed all their cards yet. Why support Argentina if Brazil will win? It is because of Maradona. At the time when live telecast arrived in India, it was Maradona who was enchanting us on the football field. My weakness dates back to those days. I have seen the team?s first match but have heard how well they played to get six goals in the second.

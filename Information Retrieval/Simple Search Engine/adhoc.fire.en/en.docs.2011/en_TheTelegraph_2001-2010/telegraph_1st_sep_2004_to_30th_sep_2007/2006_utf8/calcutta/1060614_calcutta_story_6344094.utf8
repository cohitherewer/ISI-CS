What: A cookery workshop by Timothy Bruce, 

general manager of The Hyatt Regency, Calcutta.

 Where: La Cucina, the Italian speciality restaurant.

 When: June 10, 11 am onwards.

 Take a look: La Cucina has played host to many cookery workshops, but the Saturday session was different ? the chefs cap was donned by general manager Timothy Bruce, a former chef. The workshop was attended by the consular crowd of the city and executives.

 Presiding over the workshop and tutoring the participants to whip up Continental dishes, Timothy slipped into the role of a chef easily. From my stay in Calcutta, I have realised that onions and potatoes work well in this part of the globe, began Timothy. He showcased White Onion Broth (blend of sweated onions and potatoes topped with sun-dried tomatoes/saffron foam/roasted shrimps).

 Next it was Crisp Wrapped Asparagus with Warm Red Tomato Chutney scented with Basil (asparagus in a spring roll wrap of cheese, Prosciutto ham, and sage leaf, served with chutney).

 A pamphlet distributed among the participants quoted Mark Twain: The only way to keep your health is to eat what you dont like, drink what you dont like, and do what you would rather not. Timothy added on a lighter note: Its good that many of us do not follow the first few words, otherwise the hospitality industry would run into trouble.

 Also showcased was Seared Salmon with Crushed Potatoes and Port Wine Essence (pan-fried fish fillet assembled with shallot confit and port wine essence).

 Voiceover: Cooking is like learning to ride a bicycle, once you know it you never forget it. Moreover, I often cook at my apartment. The workshop was a good experience and I tried to keep the preparations simple. There are no rules in cooking but your imagination, smiled Timothy.

 Paratha pick

 What: Parathewale Gali Ke Dawat.

 Where: Saffron at The Park.

 When: Monday afternoon. The festival is on till July 9.

 The spread: The vegetarian section boasts Yellow Pumpkin Paratha (cooked mashed pumpkin mixed with Indian spices), Paratha Bhuney Matar (fresh peas sauteed with cumin and green chilli) and Aloo Sukhi Methi Ka Paratha (potatoes cooked with fenugreek). 

 If you want something innovative, you can try the Narial Paratha (fresh grated coconut milk mixed in a dough), Makai Chilli Paratha (babycorn and Indian spices) or Mirchi Paratha (mixture of fresh and dried chillies). 

 Then there are Hara Pyaz Ka Paratha (blend of spring onions, coriander and green chilli), Khumb Paratha (mushroom and cumin) and Angrezi Subzi Paratha (mixture of broccoli, red and yellow bellpepper). 

 The non-vegetarian platter has some interesting preparations like Anda Paratha (stuffed paratha with egg, coriander and chillies) and Keema Paratha (mutton mince cooked with Chettinad spices).

 Also available are traditional all-time favourites like Aloo Paratha, Gobi Paratha, Muli Paratha, Bhindi Paratha, Paneer Paratha and Palak Paratha. If you want to pamper your sweet tooth with parathas, choose from Khoya Paratha or the ones with cashew nuts, pistachio and raisins.

 The paratha combo allows you to savour Dal Makhani and Ladies Finger Stir-fried with Onion in the vegetarian section and Murgh Tak-a-tak in the non-vegetarian meal. 

 All parathas are accompanied by a variety of pickles, a choice of curd and sweet or salted lassi or fresh home-made white butter.

 Pocket pinch: A meal for two would cost approximately Rs 450, including taxes.

 Voiceover: On a trip to Delhis famous Chandni Chowk area, I got the idea of organising a paratha festival. We have picked up a few of the recipes from there, but they have been tempered to make them more palatable, said sous chef of The Park, Rajiv Khullar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 On a recent visit to a popular water park in Calcutta, I was shocked to see a dead rat floating in one of the water bodies. When I asked the staff and lifeguards to remove the carcass, our repeated requests fell on deaf ears. I was forced to take up the issue with the management, who took action much later. 

 Health and hygiene should be the top priority for amusement parks, but this incident convinced me that these water parks do not pay any attention to maintenance and are concerned only about the money that comes in. I request the authorities to look into the matter and properly maintain such parks if they want to do good business.

 On February 19, I appeared for the State Level Eligibility Test (SLET) and my centre was at Surendranath College. I was utterly surprised to notice that the college didn?t have a single women?s toilet. The only toilet for our use was in a shambles without proper doors and bolts. As a result, none of the women examinees could use it. I request the authorities to show some concern for the woman visitors.

 The drinking water sold by the roadside vendors is responsible for all sorts of water-borne diseases. With summer coming, can the authorities do something to provide us with clean, hygienic water on roads?

 Sonu ko gussa kyon aata hai

 The singer blasts music companies and Himesh Reshammiya in a chat with Pratim D. Gupta 

 Sonu Nigam is the new angry young man of Bollywood. Sometimes he is threatening to quit acting, sometimes he is threatening to quit his wife, sometimes he is threatening to quit singing. 

 While most wouldnt have a problem with his first threat and not many should have a say with his second one, none would like to lose out on Sonu the singer. And thankfully, the mans settling for a partial resignation.

 There has been too much of music and I am just planning to cut down on my singing, he says. Of the 500 songs I sing every year, only 10 or 11 songs are remembered. One song in Paheli, two songs in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna... end up being classy and memorable. 

 So, I want to sing only those many. There is so much to do in life. My house is filled with books... I do not want to die without reading them. Then I want to travel, work out, start doing taekwondo again, do some meditation.

 But how can he predict which songs are going to work? By now, I think I have enough experience to choose the right songs, is the pat reply. Then there are people whom I can never say no to. Like I can never turn down Karan Johar. Had he not given me Suraj hua maddham, I wouldnt have been anywhere today. Then theres Yash Raj and some other music director friends of mine whom I cant refuse.

 Sonu has just dedicated a single Yeh rashtra prem ki bhavna to the victims of the 7/11 Mumbai blasts. It was an Independence Day song and is still being released around the same time but the timing is apt to offer it to the sufferers, says the singer. The city needs some maram patti, some first aid. The young generation needs to be told that our country is not the best, they have to make it the best.

 For the patriotic single, Sonu has not resorted to support from any music company. As an artiste, I feel limited when I sing for music companies, he says. I can tell you this song would not have been possible with a music company. So I have invested my own money and the song will only be available on the net, heard on radio channels and seen on TV. If I can work out the commercial logistics, I can produce more music like this.

 The reason Sonu wants to go his own way is because he is not being allowed to sing his stuff. I refuse to believe that the new generation will reject good music, he almost fumes on the phone. If the music of Kal Ho Naa Ho, Parineeta and Veer-Zaara can be loved so much, arent we lying to ourselves when we say that they only accept a certain sound?

 That certain sound obviously comes from a certain Himesh Reshammiya whose winning playback singer awards wasnt exactly celebrated by Sonu. No, no let everyone Himesh, Anu Malik, Bappi Lahiri sing, you can feel the seething rage within. I can understand that people have wives to impress and parents to support. But I wouldnt want to reduce myself in my own eyes by commenting about the singing.

 Sonu has no such qualms about speaking about his own songs, though. I am really looking forward to my songs in Lage Raho Munnabhai, which is a fantabulous film, a huge morale booster. There are also two great songs in Jaan-e-Mann.

What: Beach Party at the new water park, Wet 

 Wild Beach Tropicana, at Nicco Park.

 Where: Jheel Meel, Sector IV, Salt Lake.

 When: March 26, 11:30 am onwards.

 Ambience: As the scorching sun pushed the Celsius past the 40-degree mark, Sunday turned out to be the perfect day for a dip and a splash in the water park.

 A beach effect was created right at the entrance with three-dimensional dolphins and starfish. Five acres of sprawl with palm trees around the borders, lush green landscape, a giant cliff with waterfall tumbling down, a shikara placed adjacent to it, tiny bridges over water channels and a sand-finish surface surrounding the wave pool all added to the wet-and-wild feel.

 With the joy rides in colourful splashes and the cool blue water beckoning, guests started pouring in from the early hours, hats on their heads, shades and slippers in place. The popular dress code was tees and shorts for men, sarongs and trousers for women.

 The party: It was a mixed crowd with the young and not-so-young having a blast, savouring their drink and enjoying the water. Band Shiva belting out popular chartbusters kept the party people in full swing.

 At the Kids Pool, the toddlers enjoyed their tumble tryst with mini-water slides and playful mushroom waterfall. Squeals of excitement were heard as the toppling water casket poured in a bucket full of water while they waded through.

 The Lazy River bordering it had teenagers floating with colourful tubes. The Wave Pool with six different kinds of simulated waves and roars reminiscent of a sea shore saw a large turnout ? children with life jackets enjoying a splash and some elders happy just to drown in the cool blue. The more adventurous enjoyed the thrill of the roller coaster Wave Runners.

 After all that action, it was time to lounge on recliners and easy chairs under the shades. For those on an adrenaline high, the Rain Dance floor was the place to be and move to Just chill or Kajra re.

 Sip bite: Beer, vodka, Breezer and cold drinks flowed with finger food like Finger Chips, Vegetable Roll and Keema Roll. A lavish lunch offered an Indian and Chinese spread.

 Spotted: Designer Agnimitra Paul, actor Indrajit and wife Rupam.

 Voiceover: The water park is a value addition to Nicco Park and keeps the novelty factor intact. Be it the quality of the water, services or the fun-filled ambience, everything adds to give families and youngsters a chance to have a great time, smiles Rajive Kaul, chairman, Nicco group.

 The Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005 runner-up 

Vinit Singh was in Calcutta on Saturday evening. Crowds at at Forum and City Centre 

went quite berserk when the rising star played to the galleries and said: I 

have heard so much about Calcutta from people like Shaan and Himesh (Reshammiya). 

I would like to give a full-fledged performance here. In the evening, the 

singer made a surprise visit to Fusion, the resto-bar at The Golden Park, for 

dinner. Vinit has already sung for half-a-dozen movies and is geared up for many 

more. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

 Club couture

 What: Now and Always ? Club Style, a fashion show.

 When: March 25, 8.30 pm onwards.

 Where: Saturday Club lawns. 

 The fashion show: The evening was dedicated to the members, in true by the members and for the members style. Right from the script to the choreography and catwalk to designing, it was members who stole the show.

 Reena Kataria, Shampa Mukherjee, Mallika Verma, Payal Chitlangia, Priyanjali Ray, Komal Sood, Vinni Mehta, Medhavini Khaitan, Booblie Banerjee, Rani and Jyoti Vij along with Neeta Kapur went on to become parts of the 12 designers team. Each of these designers showcased a few ensembles from their summer collections.

 The result was a melange of design sensibilities, silhouettes, colours and fabrics.

 On display was everything, from casuals to cocktail wear, bridal ensembles to kids and mens wear.

 Voiceover: Apart from the participating designers, we had about 75 members on the ramp. We were proud of our members enthusiasm and involvement. The effect was wonderful and it is rewarding to know that our efforts were much appreciated and applauded by all, said Renu Roy, convenor of the entertainment committee of Saturday Club.

 S factor

 What: Wine appreciation evening by Champagne Indage. 

 Where: Hotel Hindusthan International Banquets.

 When: Saturday evening. 

 The wine: The Indage group was founded in 1985 and it has grown into the largest producer of wine in the country with 2,000 acres of land under cultivation. They produce 4,00,000 cases annually and export to 69 countries in the world.

 The evening: Ajay Gothwal, manager, Champagne Indage and a wine connoisseur, gave valuable tips to the audience who wanted to appreciate good wine. The basis, he stressed, was the 4S formula of drinking wine ? see, sniff, swirl and sip.

 Voiceover: People mistake all the varieties of wine to be the same. There are various varieties like white, red, sparkling and rose, which are had in different ways and with different food accompaniments, said Gothwal. 

 Light wine is better had with light food (fish and chicken) and heavier wines are best had with heavier food (mutton and beef). The glass of wine should be swirled before a sip is taken as it helps release the bouquets of aroma from the wine, he added.

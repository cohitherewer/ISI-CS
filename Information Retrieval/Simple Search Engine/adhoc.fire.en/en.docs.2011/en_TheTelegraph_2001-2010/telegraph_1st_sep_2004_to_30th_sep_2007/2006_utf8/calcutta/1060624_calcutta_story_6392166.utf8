 Clear out city centre, rules court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Hawkers will have to be removed from the central business district immediately, Calcutta High Court ruled on Friday. 

 The order was in response to the plea of the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), that the eviction be put off till a rehabilitation policy was framed.

 ?The state and the CMC are being directed to carry out the court?s previous order of immediate removal of encroachers from the pavements of eight roads of the city,? the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya said.

 The eight thoroughfares are Brabourne Road, Kali Krishna Tagore Street, Kalakar Street, NS Road, Strand Road, Rabindra Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road and AJC Bose Road.

 The government and the CMC, however, have been allowed to defer eviction on the other roads till a ?comprehensive? rehabilitation policy is prepared.

 ?But we want to know about the progress of the panel that has been formed to settle the hawkers? problems. It will have to find out a formula on their rehabilitation in a separate zone,? the bench observed.

 ?I recently visited Rashbehari Avenue. The situation is terrible. The entire footpath is occupied by hawkers,? the chief justice remarked.

 Advocate-general Balai Ray submitted that his government was trying to solve the problem by holding talks with the hawkers. 

 On billboards, the court asked the CMC to file an affidavit, stating the names of the persons who allowed billboards on pavements.

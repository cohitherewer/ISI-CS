Revival is the route

 A moment from Shohan?s Megh

 Originally intended for the Utpal Dutt commemorative festival, Shohan?s Megh, now in its regular run, provides a glimpse of an unusual side to Dutt?s genius. Normally a committed Marxist, he wrote this early script as an innocuous murder mystery. No wonder that he never produced it himself, though he did cinematise it in 1961, considering it fit for the less discriminating film-going public. Lucklessly for him, they rejected it too.

 Shohan is not the first group to stage Megh; Nandiranga did it in 1995. But what marks this revival is Anish Ghosh?s interpretation of it. In his directorial note, he suggests a connection between the thriller, about an author?s desire to write the perfect murder, and Dutt?s politics. The author in Megh wants to make the assassin his real hero, ?which urges thinking people to disrupt the system, even by radicalism?. He even plots a killing in real life. But in the course of the drama he understands how all this is wrong, and eventually abjures this equivalent of ?terrorist intentions or activities?.

 But even in this revised edition by playwright Mohit Chattopadhyay, Megh remains dramatically weak, especially when everything ends happily with an anticlimactic sleight of hand. It has only two characters that challenge the actors ? the writer himself and his blackmailing former girlfriend ? both of whom receive able treatment from Anish Ghosh and Runa Banerjee respectively. Nevertheless, Ghosh?s political angle gives it an interesting twist.

 Another revival consists of Little Thespian?s Manto ne Kaha?, three of Saadat Hasan Manto?s Partition stories dramatised and directed by S.M. Azhar Aalam. An immediate comparison arises with Rangakarmee?s current Manto productions, with the implied question whether Little Thespian should have followed in the shadow of her bigger fellows.

 But it is the 50th year after Manto?s death, after all, so we can have multiple versions of his works. Besides, Little Thespian uses Manto?s own language, Urdu, not Hindi translations, and a totally different style. The famous Khol Do presents the contrast clearly. Whereas Usha Ganguli has a physical ensemble approach, Aalam applies a minimalist, storytelling technique, employing just four characters and a narrator. The impact is not diminished in any way.

 Likewise, Sahaye (about a Muslim migrating to Pakistan by ship from Bombay) and Thanda Gosht (the gruesome tale of necrophilia during the riots) leave viewers shell-shocked through suggestion rather than explicitness. Hiena Parvez gives the best performance, as the women in Khol Do and Thanda Gosht.

 But Aalam should add more pieces ? the one-hour duration kept many spectators wondering whether the show had really finished. I, for one, would like to see him attempt some of Manto?s plays, hardly-known compared to the short stories.

 Howrah sets Rs 100-cr property tax target

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) is set to bring 150,000 more buildings under the ambit of property tax.

 ?I hope the property tax revenue of the HMC crosses the Rs 100-crore mark by March 2007,? said Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee.

 Currently, owners of 72,000 houses pay property tax in the town. Last year, the civic authorities had constituted a special team to reassess the tax on those buildings and add more to the list. Following the exercise, about 150,000 buildings will start paying property tax in Howrah from this financial year. 

 Officials of the municipal affairs department, however, are sceptical about the possibility of Rs 100-crore property tax collection.

 ?We are not happy with the functioning of the HMC, which is the second largest municipal corporation in the state,? stated a joint secretary of the department. 

 According to an administrative report for 2001-2005 published by the department in June, the HMC trails the other 125 urban local bodies in the state in terms of collection of tax and non-tax revenue as percentage of the total demand raised.

 Besides, among the six municipal corporations, the HMC is the only one whose collection of total revenue from its own sources is less than its salary and wage bill. 

 The collection of total revenue as percentage of total demand raised is only 12, when the state average for urban local bodies is 28. 

 In 2004-2005, the total demand of property tax raised by the HMC was Rs 61.25 crore, but the collection was only Rs 7.03 crore.

 Admitting that the revenue collection was low, chief accountant of the HMC Bitan Basu pointed out the problems unique to Howrah. The number of sick and closed industrial units in the town is more than in other municipal areas. Also, there are several litigated properties and sick units of the state and the central government in Howrah, he said. 

 Excepting 2004-2005, there has been an upswing in revenue collection from the year 2000-01, claimed Basu. Between 2000-01 and 2003-04, the revenue collection from the HMC?s own sources grew from Rs 12.7 crore to Rs 20.48 crore. 

 ?Though there was a dip in revenue collection from Rs 20.48 crore to Rs 19 crore in 2004-05, we made up for it the following year. The total collection in 2005-2006 was Rs 24 crore,? argued the chief accountant.

 What: A talk titled Stay 

 healthy, feel beautiful during Durga Puja. 

 Where: At Dr Batras Positive Health Clinic, 227/1A AJC Bose Road.

 When: Thursday afternoon.

 Take a look: The event started off with Dr Piyali Chakravarty, city head of the chain of homoeopathy clinics, welcoming actress June. The discussion began with how Durga Puja celebrations are fuelled by enthusiasm and great joy but also bring along certain health problems.

 To promote an illness-free Puja this year, a few precautions like ensuring sufficient sleep, nutritious food and avoidance of heavy cosmetics were stressed, along with the benefits of homoeopathy. The experts also discussed why some of us are prone to ill-health because of low resistance and greater vulnerability to diseases.

 The clinic promises continuous monitoring of patients and no side-effects. I am happy that the clinic also has treatment available for HIV/AIDS patients, said June, who was handed over a special privilege membership card of the health clinic.

 Voiceover: We will try to bring home the concept of homoeopathy to stay beautiful this festive season, said Chakravarty, while elaborating on the virtues of this form of medication.

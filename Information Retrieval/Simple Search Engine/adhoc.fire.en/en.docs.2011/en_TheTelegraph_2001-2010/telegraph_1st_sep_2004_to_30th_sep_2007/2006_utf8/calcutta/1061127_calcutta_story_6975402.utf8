 New technique to reverse paralysis

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Malabika Mukherjee (name changed) suffered a cerebral stroke on the night of November 6. Around 6.30 the next morning, her husband discovered that she was unable to speak and was showing symptoms of a cerebral stroke.

 The 42-year-old was rushed to hospital. Doctors confirmed that she had suffered a massive stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain and hence, the right side of her body was paralysed. A CT scan and MRI revealed a blood clot in a major artery leading to the brain. 

 Malabika faced the threat of remaining paralysed all her life. However, thanks to intra-arterial thrombolysis, her recovery from the next day and could soon move her limbs. 

 Intra-arterial thrombolysis is a technique to dissolve clots in the arteries leading to the brain. An angiogram is carried out to locate the clot. A narrow catheter is then inserted through the groin into the neck artery. An even narrower tube is pushed through the catheter to the location of clot. The tube makes a hole through the clot and a drug is injected directly into it. 

 This is a very difficult but effective technique as the clot dissolves quickly and blood circulation to the brain is re-established within an hour, said Jayanta Roy, neurologist at AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, who was part of the team that conducted the surgery on Malabika. 

 The brain cells are not damaged for three to six hours after the blood supply is stopped. If the clot can be removed and blood supply restored to the cells within this period, paralysis can be reversed, explained Sukalyan Purkayastha, interventional neuro-radiologist at AMRI Hospitals and another member of the surgical team. 

 According to the director of National Neurosciences Centre, Calcutta, R.P. Sengupta: Intra-arterial thrombolysis is a new technique and one of the most effective ways to manage a stroke. 

 Neurosurgeon with Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta, L.N. Tripathi stated: A clot is extremely concentrated. If the drug cannot be administered directly to the clot, it cannot be dissolved. The intravenous route is not viable, since the drug will not remain concentrated enough to break the clot. 

 Between thrombosis and haemorrhagic stroke, the former is more prevalent in Calcutta. According to recent surveys, thrombosis consists of 80 to 85 per cent of the cases.

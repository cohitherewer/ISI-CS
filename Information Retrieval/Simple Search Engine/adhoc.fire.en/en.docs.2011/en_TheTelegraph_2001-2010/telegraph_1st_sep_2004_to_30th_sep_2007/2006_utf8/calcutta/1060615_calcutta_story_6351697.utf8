 What: 

 Opening of Gallery Rasa. 

 Where: 828/1, Block P, 

 New Alipore.

 When: June 10, evening.

 Take a look: A sprawling 4,000 sq ft area makes up the two-storied gallery. The entrance has metal figurines on either side of the door and the word Gallery is inscribed on wood and Rasa on metal. 

 The name Rasa reflects an essence and does not typecast the gallery, explains co-proprietor Rakesh Sahni, an Indian contemporary art consultant.

 Both floors are extended along the length. The interiors are simple, most of it in white, with touches of wood. While the minimalist look gives the feel of space, wood seems to complement the art. 

 On the right hand corner of the ground floor there is a wooden bookshelf with volumes on Indian terracotta art, Garhwal painting and books on eminent artists like Nandalal Bose. 

 The launch also kicked off a sculpture exhibition titled The Bengal Connection. On till July 8, the exhibition showcases some of the greatest artists from Bengal, including Jamini Roy, Ramkinkar Beij, Prodosh Das Gupta, Kamala Das Gupta and Chintamoni Kar. 

 Present at the opening were artists Paritosh Sen, Eleena Banik and Amitabha Banerjee. 

 The exhibition is home to some interesting art pieces, said Sen. Banik rated Ramkinkars Harvester as one of the best on display. 

 Shrouded Woman, Winter, Nagardola, Babu, Aroh Awaroh?Mounted on white pedestals were sculptures that were abstract figures or embodiments of ethnic sensibilities. 

 From bronze to wood to glazed ceramic to terracotta to sandstone, the media used were varied. 

 Next in line is a retrospective on the works of Ramendranath Chakraborty that will focus on print mediums like etching and lithography.

 Voiceover: From my childhood days of visiting Kumartuli, sculptures have been an integral part of my growing up. Compared to other fields of booming art, sculpture perhaps has been left a bit behind. An effort like this is a push to promote sculpture, said Rakesh Sahni on the launch exhibition.

 Stone style

 What: Launch of wedding collection by Tanishq.

 Where: Tanishqs showroom at Kankurgachhi.

 When: Tuesday.

 Take a look: Tanishq enters the high-value studded jewellery segment with this collection, departing from its pure gold designs. 

 The new collection includes heavy necklaces, earrings, finger rings, bangles, wristlets, bracelets and tiaras. 

 Drawing inspiration from flowers, the exquisite designs have been created with diamonds and coloured stones like rubies and emeralds. 

 Set in pure gold, the jewellery is perfect for weddings and special occasions.

 Pocket pinch: Prices range from Rs 30,000 to Rs 10 lakh.

 Voiceover: This foray will enhance our portfolio and reinforce Tanishqs image of being the jewellery brand catering to varying consumer needs, said Dwaipayan Sen, regional business manager, east.

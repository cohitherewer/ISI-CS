 Look of the day

After two days of unadulterated adda at your para pandal, Ashtami is the day to get into piety groove. As you head for the pandal to offer anjali, your dress code for the day demands ethnic finery.

 If you belong to the 20-something 

 brigade, be a little more experimental and flaunt tradition 

 with a twist. So, ditch the sari in favour of a lehnga-choli 

 in the traditional Puja colours. Swastika Mukherjee 

 (top) shows off the look in a red lehnga-choli 

 by designer Shantanu Goenka. The ensemble is embellished 

 with dull gold work. The make-up is gorgeous too, with the 

 eyes done up with wine-coloured shadow, contour of bronze 

 and antique gold highlighting. Brick-brownish blush and 

 nude-beige lips finish the look. Natural, tangled hair extensions 

 have been used. The look is just right for the Ashtami functions 

 and will go equally well for a Dandiya at night.

 If you are past the 35-mark, go 

 traditional. Bidisha Bhaduri (above) decks up in 

 a red-and-gold Dhakai jamdani from Meera Basu, draped 

 in the Bengali style. Her eyes are made up with brown shadow 

 with black outer corner contouring and kohl. Brown blush-on 

 is matched with brickish-brown lips. The hair is in a low 

 bun.

 Here, too, the ethnic appeal rules 

 on Ashtami. Max Benitz (right) shows off the look 

 in a dhoti-kurta ensemble by Sharbari Datta. The 

 kurta is in a combination of matka and Bangalore 

 silk, with all-over child art embellishment in red and tussar. 

 It has been teamed with a tussar dhoti with matching 

 red work.

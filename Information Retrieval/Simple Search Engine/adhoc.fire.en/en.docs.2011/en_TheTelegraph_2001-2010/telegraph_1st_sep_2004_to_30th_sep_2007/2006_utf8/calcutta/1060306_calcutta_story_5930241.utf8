 Rape alleged in hospital

 - Attendant?s son arrested on complaint by patient?s wife

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A housewife was allegedly raped on the Medical College and Hospital premises early on Sunday.

 The 26-year-old woman, whose husband is admitted in the hospital, was allegedly raped around 1.30 am, police said. Virendra, son of a Group D employee of the hospital, was arrested late on Sunday, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central). ?He is the son of an attendant in the hospital and lives on the same compound,? he said.

 Lalit Mondal of Bishnupur, South 24-Parganas, was admitted to the hospital?s Green Building with acute abdominal pain nine days ago. His wife usually spent the night in the hospital.

 The woman was in the waiting room of the Green Building on Saturday night, along with family members of other patients. Virendra allegedly told her that Lalit?s condition had deteriorated and she was required at his bedside.

 The woman followed Virendra. ?She was taken to a deserted place inside the hospital and allegedly raped,? a police officer said. The woman returned to the waiting hall and told relatives of other patients about the incident. 

 A commotion broke out early on Sunday when she was taken to the doctors of the emergency department, who advised her to lodge a complaint with the police. She then went to the police outpost on the compound but officers there asked her to go to Bowbazar police station. 

 Once the complaint was made, a police team reached the hospital and searched for the culprit but he had fled. Later in the evening, Virendra was arrested in a staff quarters where he was hiding. 

 ?A preliminary medical test has been conducted on the woman at the gynaecology department,? said Anup Roy, superintendent of the hospital. ?Since it was Sunday, the forensic department was closed and the detailed tests will be conducted on Monday,? 

 The hospital authorities will assist police in the investigation and will meet senior officers on Monday to take stock of the hospital?s law and order situation, particularly late at night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It?s official, Xaviers first to wrest autonomy stamp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?It?s time for celebrations, Xaverians?!? begins the only message on the bulletin board of St Xavier?s College. And why not? The college has just been granted autonomous status.

 The letter from the University Grants Commission (UGC), addressed to Calcutta University (CU), arrived at 2.17 pm on Monday. 

 The approval from CU, signed by registrar Samir Kumar Bandyopadhyay, arrived at 5.21 pm.

 ??University of Calcutta hereby confers on St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, the status of an autonomous college under the University for a period of six years? from academic year 2006-2007,? read the letter that principal Father P.C. Mathew received.

 Being the first college in the state to be granted autonomy, the freedom comes with ?terrific responsibility?, felt the principal. ?We have to raise the standards, and not compromise on quality. While we want more deserving, underprivileged students, admissions will become stricter,? he added.

 The institution now gets the right to conduct its own admissions with greater freedom, the right to decide its own syllabus, conduct exams, evaluate and declare the results, and receive an autonomy grant from the UGC. ?We get Rs 12 lakh if there are two postgraduate departments. We already have one, and will launch two more from the next academic session,? explained Father Mathew.

 The college will also be able to recruit teachers independent of the state government and without CU interference. In addition, the college can structure tuition and other fees and raise funds, though it will continue to avail of the existing financial aid from the state.

 To revise the ?outdated? curriculum and make it ?more competitive?, a Board of Studies for each department and an Academic Council will be formed.

 What: 

 Launch of PKS Jewellers. 

 Where: D-103, City Centre, 

 Salt Lake.

 When: April 15.

 Take a look: The jewellery house has been exporting to clients in the US, UK, UAE, Singapore, Bangladesh and Australia for quite some time now. The brand new 800 sq ft showroom offering exclusive gold and diamond ornaments is an effort to come closer to customers in Calcutta. 

 The showroom was inaugurated by magician P.C. Sorcar (Jr). The collection is good and when women put them on, it would definitely do some magic to their appearances, smiled Sorcar.

 From bangles to neckpieces, rings to maangtikas, the wide range of jewellery comes in a clutch of eye-catching designs. The patterns are a blend of conventional and contemporary designs. 

 For the wrist you find broad balas and thin bangles. Bangles with wave patterns catch the eye. The necklaces will spoil you for choice. Rubies, pearls, emeralds and the like have been combined to form sleek or broad neckpieces.

 They come with matching earrings. Thin chains have beautifully encrusted stone pendants. For the heavy and ornate ones, dew-shaped extensions look pretty.

 Rings in thin or broad bands come in abstract and floral designs. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 1,500. 

 Voiceover: After success overseas, its time to explore the vast market potential in the retail segment of gold and diamond jewellery here. A lot of research was done to ensure that we cater to every taste, said S.K. Saha, managing director PKS Limited, at the City Centre store.

 Cool clothes

 Pocket pinch: The clothes are priced between Rs 500 and Rs 3,000.

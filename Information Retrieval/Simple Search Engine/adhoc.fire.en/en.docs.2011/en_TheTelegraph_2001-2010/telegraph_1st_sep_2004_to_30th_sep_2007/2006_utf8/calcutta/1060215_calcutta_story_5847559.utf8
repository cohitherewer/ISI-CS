 Theft at MLA hub

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A gang sneaked into the high-security State Guest House, on Kyd Street, on Monday night and walked away with the stereos from two cars.

 The vehicles belong to Sankar Singh, Congress MLA from Nadia, and Nityananda Bera, CPM legislator from Sutahata. Both were lodged at the MLAs? Hostel, adjoining the guest house, part of which is under construction. Their drivers were not around.

 Park Street police station has started a case on a complaint lodged by the hostel superintendent. Officers of the detective department, too, have swung into action.

 No one was arrested till Monday evening, though sleuths had for hours interrogated private guards who man the hostel and launched a search for car thieves known to be active in the area.

 ?Several incidents of thefts from cars were reported from the area over the past few weeks,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 ?We have identified the gang and it?s a matter of time before we round up the criminals,? he claimed.

 Congress MLAs raised the issue in the Assembly and protested the ?lack of security? on the hostel premises. 

 The sleuths suspect the gang had probably sneaked in around midnight, when not many were around at the guest house. They removed the rubber sheets bordering the glass panes of the cars (Singh?s Bolero and Bera?s Ambassador), unlocked the doors and removed the stereos. 

 ?The thefts were discovered on Tuesday morning, when the MLAs? drivers returned from their rest room. They immediately informed the leaders,? said a senior officer of Park Street police station.

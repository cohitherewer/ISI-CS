 His sketches, posters and jottings, personal memorabilia and photos from the family album all that can throw light on the lesser-known facets of Satyajit Ray is now just a click away.

 Satyajit Ray Society, an organisation that works towards the preservation of Rays films, launched www.worldofray.com, a comprehensive and authentic website on the master film-maker at ITC Sonar Bangla on August 26, the day Pather Panchali had released in Calcutta in 1955. 

 Giving a glimpse into the various facets of Ray, the website highlights the film-maker as an illustrator, writer, graphic artist, advertising professional, photographer and family man.

 We didnt want the website to be very academic as our target is to make the young generation interested in Ray and his works. We have tried to capture all his facets and we want this to be very interactive, with reader feedback, said son Sandip Ray, member-secretary of Ray Society. 

 Apart from a regular filmography with synopses of each film, cast and crew, the website boasts a rich photo gallery and video clips of films sourced from the California-based Ray FASC. Information has been made available on the film and paper restoration work being conducted by Ray FASC and Ray Society. 

 Two stories one on Feluda and the other on Professor Shanku have also been posted. Calcutta-based ICRA Ltd has provided the technical set-up.

 The website will also come in handy for researchers. There will be a lot of things that are not widely known. For instance, the fact that he (Ray) had improvised four types of typography. People have seen only three. The fourth will be there on the website, said Sandip.

 Then there are the Sygnet Press covers that he had designed and the ads for D.J. Keymer. There are photographs taken by him of himself. There are loads of photos that he had taken while travelling abroad.

 A lot of material has come from the Ray familys personal collection, especially photos, jottings, sketches and illustrations. And there is certainly more material than the website can hold.

 We are suffering from a space crunch, laughed Sandip, planning to update the site every three to four months and add more sections with new visual elements if possible.

 Ray Society plans to incorporate a chat spot and also introduce e-shopping where people can buy Ray memorabilia exclusively designed for the website.

 The 12-year-old Society is currently working on restoring Rays paperwork and digitising the collection. The other major area of work is cataloguing his library. 

 There are his script books, drawings, notebooks, sketches, literary work and posters. We have finished 80 per cent work on the black and white materials. When we are ready we will upload a catalogue of his books too. People may like to know what kind of books he liked to read and kept in his library... A major update will be done during his birth anniversary, added Sandip.

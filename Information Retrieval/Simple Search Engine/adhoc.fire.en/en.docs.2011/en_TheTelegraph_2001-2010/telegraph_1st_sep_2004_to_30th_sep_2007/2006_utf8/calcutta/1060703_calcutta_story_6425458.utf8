The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Marriage and 

 the Mumbai local

 Travelling on the trains 

 of tinsel town is as mixed up as matrimony both are 

 treacherous terrains, both take a long time to adjust to and 

 both are hard to survive, writes Chandrima S. Bhattacharya

 SEX amp; THE 

 CITY

 In Mumbai, if you are late for 

 work and reaching the station just as the train is leaving 

 the platform, writes Suketu Mehta in his romance on the 

 city, You can run up to the packed compartments and 

 find many hands stretching out to grab you on board, unfolding 

 outwards from the train like petals. As you run alongside 

 the train, you will be picked up and some tiny space will 

 be made for your feet on the edge of the open doorway. The 

 rest is up to you. 

 This, he says, remains an abiding 

 image of Mumbai. Come on board, they say. Well 

 adjust. But I have a feeling that Mehta, who wrote 

 from a Bandra address, did not travel as much in Mumbais 

 trains as I would have liked him to.

 I am naturally jealous, as I lived 

 in Kandivli and used to travel for about an hour on the 

 train to my workplace in Worli. But in the process I possibly 

 got to know more about the local train than he ? and about 

 the spirit of the city that it embodied.

 Life on Mumbai trains is like 

 living through marriage. Both are treacherous terrains, 

 both take a long time to adjust to, both are hard to survive. 

 As soon as you take the plunge 

 ? a train stops for 40 seconds only at a platform ?and you 

 are pulled in, you also start being pushed out. 

 The initial period, as they say, 

 is the most difficult. There are columns of women guarding 

 the doorway, ostensibly ready to get out at the next station, 

 but actually trying to block the entrance and beat the hell 

 out of you ?(Hell is other people, said Jean-Paul 

 Sartre) ? so that they can breathe.

 I got thrown out twice (here I 

 am only talking about trains) ? and I used to travel in 

 ladies compartments, first class, monthly pass for 

 Rs 520. I was new to Mumbai then. Once at Andheri, the third 

 station from Kandivli towards town, and directly hit the 

 staircase.

 Next time it was worse. I was 

 lifted over by the office-returning mob surging out and 

 tossed on the platform. About 10 pairs of feet trampled 

 over me in their rush to get on to the stairs first. As 

 I lay on my back, contemplating the fleeting salwars 

 overhead, I wondered if thats what a stampede felt 

 like.

 And then as I pulled myself up 

 ? a friend helped me, annoyed that I had still not mastered 

 train se utarna ? I got the shock of 

 my life.

 Hands that had certainly pulled 

 people up just a while ago were stretched out again, this 

 time straight in the air, and as the train picked up speed, 

 one came down like a dead weight on my back and almost felled 

 me.

 As I tottered, the owner of the 

 hand looked back and grinned. My friend was even more irritated. 

 You dont even know that you shouldnt stand 

 close to the train! There are those hands, she said. 

 How then did the hands that unfurled 

 seductively like petals ? you almost see that in slow motion 

 ? to pull you in turn into blunt instruments with the deadliest 

 intent?

 But didnt I say that Mumbai 

 trains were a bit like marriage? The city, too, is a bit 

 like the people who travel in its trains. And someone should 

 soon write a book on the city as an insider, and not a tourist. 

 If he or she is not good-looking enough for an advance from 

 a foreign publishing firm, we will suggest beauty clinics 

 that do good makeover jobs. 

 But there were two consolations. 

 That is if the person got up, got on a train again, muscled 

 her way in and grabbed a seat. Which is what most do, and 

 I am not only talking about trains here. As far as Mumbai 

 trains go, they are the best form of public transport in 

 the country, with a train every three minutes, and far cheaper 

 than Metro. 

 So I learnt with time that if 

 a train was very crowded and you were nowhere near the doorway 

 and yet needed to get out at the next station, a co-commuter 

 would ask you: Can I push you?

 Then as you attached yourself 

 to the back of the person in front and as the train came 

 to a halt, heave-ho, you were given a huge push, and you 

 were out! If all partings were so gentle... 

 The other thing only women knew. 

 After evening, when the battles were lost and won and the 

 days business done and the ladies compartment was 

 not so crowded, then it became a fair. Especially the second-class 

 compartment, which was always more fun that the first, where 

 they took the class distinction very seriously. But the 

 second class permitted all. So the Koli fisherwoman sat 

 cross-legged at the gate now, facing Churchgate to get the 

 night-air from the right direction, looking relaxed after 

 the long days bargaining.

 Next to her stood a girl in a 

 backless top, talking on her mobile. Then a woman would 

 get up from Marine Lines with ready-made chapatis 

 and chopped vegetables, and both would fall upon the stuff 

 with gusto. They were both working women with the same hours 

 and needs.

 Then would follow a sari-seller, 

 a salwar kurta seller, a laundry bag seller, a young 

 man with a T-shaped board aflutter with ribbons from which 

 hung all the stuff that a household needs, from a filter 

 for the kitchen sink to a needle-and-thimble set.

 A woman would sell expensive imported 

 watches and make-up. She would just leave her boxes on several 

 laps and look out of the window. When the women had gone 

 through the stuff, she would silently collect them back. 

 They would ask after her family members. 

 My mother could visit me in Mumbai 

 only to shop on trains. The elderly woman next to me would 

 ask if I lived alone in the city and how life was. Conversations 

 never happen that easy in Mumbai. And let the backless girl 

 try to suggest to the Koli woman to shift a little. She 

 would regret the day she was born. Then it would become 

 a perfect world, if for a very short while. To revert to 

 the real world next morning.

 But I survived Mumbai trains. 

 Do I survive marriage? I dont know ? except that I 

 find the Metro Rail convenient, but boring.

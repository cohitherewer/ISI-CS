 Faithless fellowship

 Relationships form the basis of civilization and society. Our lives are nurtured and built on the strength of relationships we share with our near and dear ones. Unfortunately, the so-called progress of society has brought in its wake the destruction of this core, sustaining fibre of life. Exposing the hollow sham of modern inter-personal relationships, Satyaasatya is an ironic reflection of the faithlessness, deception and pretence that we practise in our daily lives. Based on a play by J.B. Priestley, it offers a bitter portrayal of the utter dishonesty, infidelity and futility of human relationships. Rooted in a bed of hypocritical vows and shallow promises, they are kept alive only by carefully concealing their essential void beneath a veil of false amity and harmony. But when this fallacious veil is accidentally lifted, we try to hide our embarrassment by endeavouring to restore social propriety by putting on our masks of deception once again. Direction: Shyamal Chakraborty.

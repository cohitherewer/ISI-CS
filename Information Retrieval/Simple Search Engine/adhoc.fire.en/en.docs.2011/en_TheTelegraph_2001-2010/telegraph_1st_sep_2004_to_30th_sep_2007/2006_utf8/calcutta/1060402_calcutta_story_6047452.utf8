 Game for a sip and bite

 Drain your favourite lager or savour your pet single-malt as you cheer that exquisite extra-cover drive or the fearsome in-swinging toe-crusher from the laid-back lounge on the upper deck of the spacious and very contemporary glass-front bar.

 And when hunger strikes, all you have to do is shift to the regal 40-seater dining hall adjacent to it. With the Maharajah of Coochbehar?s 1936-37 Harrow jacket and Gurbux Singh?s Olympics tie and blazer keeping you company, you can dig into a grand spread of Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

 CC amp;FC, of 1792 vintage, has transformed its mundane first-floor Centenary Hall into a swank dining rendezvous and the open-terrace pavilion into a contemporary lounge bar, with triple-level seating to accommodate 60-65 members and guests.

 ?One of the perennial peeves of our members has been the lack of any organised dining option, which prompted most of them to book tables elsewhere for dinner after a couple of drinks here. Now, they can stay on and enjoy a hearty meal at the club itself,? said president Utpal Ganguly, after the ceremonial unveiling of the wining-dining den on Wednesday.

 Designed by young architect Debmalya Guha of Polaris Architects amp; Designers, who was also involved in the Star Theatre restoration initiative, the lounge-bar overlooking the lush grounds offers a sweeping view of all the on-field action through the special-strength glass wall tilted to reduce thermal radiation by 30 per cent.

 ?Besides protection from the direct glare of the sun, the glass fa?ade is also designed to lessen the impact of a towering sixer. The main challenge in this design solution was to try and remain sensitive to the club?s history and yet deliver a modern meeting place,? Guha told Metro.

 At the lounge-bar, he has created three gradients of viewing through the upper deck, the high and the low tables. ?The bar counter had to be lively to create a very informal ambience and the seating arrangements done in such a manner so as to factor in flexibility,? Guha added.

 According to club CEO and managing member Deepankar Nandi, the restaurant will stay open for dinner from 7 pm to 11 pm except Mondays and lunch will be served Friday through Sunday, to begin with. ?We are delighted to offer members and guests this attractive F amp;B combination, a value-addition that was long overdue,? Nandi said.

 Rikki Dewan, owner of Don Giovanni?s, China Bistro and Pepper Chino, will man the kitchen for the dining hall and lounge-bar.

 Architect and urban designer Partha Ranjan Das, a CC amp;FC member who has also provided critical inputs to help in the metamorphosis, felt the lounge and restaurant has served to ?establish a visual connection? with the sporting arena, the club?s core competence.

 ?From the bar downstairs, one hardly had any contact with the sporting arena. Also, the meticulous showcasing of mementoes and trophies in glass cabinets and rare photographs hung on the walls of the dining hall would help members appreciate the club?s heritage better,? Das observed.

 From Sonny Ramadhin?s West Indies blazer, which the cricketer donated to the club, to the Cambridge Blue jacket of ex-president P.B. Dutta, also former Bengal Ranji skipper, rare gems adorn the walls of the plush place. One can even peruse the scorecard of the match played between Coochbehar Cricket Club and Calcutta Cricket Club featuring the likes of the Maharajah of Coochbehar, the Nawab of Moin-ud-Daullah and Beri Sarbadhikary.

 ?The objective is to encourage members to use the club more so that the institution earns more revenue that can be ploughed back into development work. Thanks to the cooperation of members and well-wishers, we could complete the project in record time,? said president Ganguly.

Circling the square

Chandralekha?s return to Calcutta after approximately 

10 years found connoisseurs denied the opportunity to see her recent works looking 

forward to her new production with eager anticipation. Sharira: Fire/Desire 

did not disappoint them, for which we must also thank the organisers, Vision 

Comptech and Hugli.

 Chandralekha continues to develop her pioneering efforts to express female sexuality through dance. In a 1995 essay, she had explained the essence of her approach to sharira: the ?body itself becomes the mandala ? the tense centre of an expanding cosmos. It is a dynamic principle linking inner space with outer space?. In that sense, Sharira does not break new ground, but crystallises her thoughts and activities over her entire career.

 Thus, it opens with the female dancer (Tishani Doshi) on the ground, virtually in the shape of the cosmic egg from which exploded all of creation. Chandralekha makes a point of rooting Doshi?s torso to the stage, never allowing her to stand erect. Simultaneously, therefore, she represents the earth mother as well as the skyey creative energy. Slowly, life forms evolve out of her and take wing, Doshi imperceptibly moulding fantastic creatures out of very difficult yogic postures.

 The male principle (Shaji John) enters halfway into the production, in the conventional manner of a Kalarippayattu martial artist, but is soon absorbed into the female energy, descending to Doshi?s ground level, after which they mirror and partner each other in a sexual yin-yang. We definitely get the feeling, though, that the feminine principle is more primal, to which the masculine is almost peripheral.

 Chandralekha choreographs every pattern of movement in a mandala ? what she calls ?a principle of power, of stability, of balance, of holding the earth?. The female mandala seems circular, the male rectilinear. So the narrative of Sharira literally looks like squaring the circle or circling the square, but holistically, not antagonistically; to quote again from Chandralekha in 1995, ?breaking the tension and rigidity of the vertical line by a curve?.

 If the dancers evoke space (supported by Sadanand Menon?s three-dimensional lighting), the musicians evoke time. The Gundecha brothers, eminent dhrupad maestros, accompanied by Akhilesh Gundecha on pakhawaj, parallel the journey by singing an alaap in Bhairavi alongside creation, moving into Behag and Yaman Kalyan for the erotic sequences, and ending with Ahir Bhairav.

 Both dancers conveyed Chandralekha?s aim superbly by their flexibility, proving through their perfect control that in fact the mind reigns over the body.

 The fact that Chandralekha, confined to a wheelchair, communicated her ideas to them successfully proves not only that the mind transcends the body?s limits, but also that she has empowered the bodies of her disciples with her mind, handing down her kinaesthetic knowledge to a third generation.

 BLOW BELOW THE BELT: The barge that damaged the underside of Howrah bridge. A Telegraph picture 

 Gone are the days when a Samaritan got his just reward not only from the person he helped but from the Almighty himself (Samaritan stands framed, January 6). Seeing the manner in which a doctor of Bidhannagar State General Hospital was implicated by a young road mishap victim whom he took to hospital, it will not be surprising if the do-gooder is forsaken by the Higher Power as well. Ironically, the most inhuman behaviour is being meted out for the most humane of acts. 

 If such incidents recur, most Calcuttans would stop lending a helping hand to people in trouble. What is even sadder is that the residents of the area where the mishap took place have started to doubt the credibility of the doctor. They are even failing to recollect the accident. If their memory continues to fail them, the doctor will never again trust a stranger in distress. 

 The misdemeanour of a section of Calcuttans is robbing the faith of all of us in our fellow human beings. An ugly picture of the city is being painted in the process not only for foreign tourists but also for the residents of other parts of India. 

 Recently, an elderly man died on the street in front of several people, not a single one of whom attempted to take him to hospital. The Bidhannagar doctor?s predicament has given the people who remained inactive that day one more reason to continue doing so in the future.

 The report ?Bridge under barge stress?, January 2, underscores the seriousness of the damage to the Howrah bridge after it took a hit on the underbelly by a barge. It is quite strange, however, that damage assessment was carried out on the basis of the traffic load data of 1982-83. Obviously, the load has increased manifold since then. 

 It is worrying that even the report might have underestimated the damage to the bridge. The failure of the authorities to protect the iconic structure portrays them in poor light. Using updated figures, a fresh study on the damage should be undertaken at the earliest.

 I read in the newspapers that experts have estimated Howrah bridge lost 10 per cent of its strength as a result of the damage to its underbelly. We hope the repair is started as quickly as possible. 

 But the most vital thing is to ensure that the accident does not recur. Floats with audio-visual warnings should be set up on either bank of the Hooghly to warn vessels about the rise in water level due to tides and other factors. At increased water level, vessels over a certain size should not be allowed to sail under the bridge. An alarm should be installed a metre below the bridge bottom to prevent vessels from accidentally hitting it. We cannot afford another collision.

 The report ?Around the world on a bicycle?, January 2, reminded me of Jules Verne?s novel ?Around the World in Eighty Days?. The similarities between Keiichi Iwasaki, the Japanese traveller, and Phileas Fogg, the hero of the 1874 novel, is apparent. There are, however, several differences. 

 While Fogg travelled the world to win a ?20,000 bet, Iwasaki is being driven by his passion for exploration. Like Fogg, Iwasaki has survived hair-raising experiences. His bicycle was stolen in Hong Kong and he had to travel miles without medical treatment after being bitten by a dog in Tibet. Iwasaki is certain to have more such experiences before he completes the journey. If the traveller writes a book on the journey, it will be a bestseller for sure.

 Apropos the report ?Tourist ?trauma? in Puri?, January 4, the incident in our neighbouring state proves the truth in the adage ?might is right?. It seems the definition of democracy in our country differs from that elsewhere in the globe. Which is why the cops decided to turn a blind eye to the harassment of tourists by thugs. The policemen probably thought the groups would sort out their differences on their own, so what if the law is breached in the process. If their counterparts everywhere think the same way, the rule of the jungle would prevail in India.

 Apropos the photographs titled ?A new beginning, a full house?, January 2, the procession taken out to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Govind Singh caused a great deal of inconvenience to residents of the city. I doubt whether a procession that blocked main thoroughfares for over four hours would have been allowed in any other civilised country. The processionists flouted traffic signals at will, much to the distress of pedestrians and motorists. Did the administration spare a single thought for the ailing people heading for a hospital?

 Apropos the report ?Dress Rehearsal?, January 5, it is pleasing to hear that stars like Aamir Khan are taking Indian films to the global arena by giving a new definition to professionalism in Bollywood. The actor not only does his work scrupulously, but extracts the best performances from his co-stars.

 Apropos the report ?Why a ramp? Strut the sky?, January 7, it is disheartening that the modelling and fashion scene in Calcutta is no longer promising. Perhaps the youngsters are looking for more professionalism. The remuneration and lack of recognition are the other deterrents. Those who are taking up jobs in airlines can always return to modelling when the situation improves.

 Prosenjit has proved his mettle as an actor over and over again (For him, the challenge lies ahead, January 9). His subdued performance in Chokher Bali was in stark contrast to the roles he enacts in the Bengali commercial movies. Rituparno Ghosh?s Khela could be a landmark film for him.

 Apropos the report ?Cloud over animal tests?, January 5, it is good to know that the Centre has directed Calcutta University to revamp its infrastructure of keeping animals used in scientific experiments. As a science student, I had often felt that the animals were being treated cruelly in academic institutions. All schools, colleges and universities should follow Calcutta University?s lead.

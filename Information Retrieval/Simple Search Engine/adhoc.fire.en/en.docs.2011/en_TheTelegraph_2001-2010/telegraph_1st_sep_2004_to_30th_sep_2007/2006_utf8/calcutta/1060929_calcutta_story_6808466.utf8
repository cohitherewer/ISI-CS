The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The odd and 

 the offbeat

 Innovation marks the use of material 

 in the pandals and on the idols. Metro checks out six... 

 STAR 

 POWER

 Naskarpara Pally Unnayan 

 Samiti: Its all in the stars at this Haridevpur puja 

 address. Rashi Chakra is the theme, revolving around 

 the rashis, zodiac signs and grohos. 

 The 20-ft-high pandal has been decorated with local 

 hog plums (amra). Around 3.5 lakh hog plums 

 have been used in the pandal after being chemically 

 treated. The bark of the date palm tree resembles 

 the web-like look of our palm.

 NAIL 

 TALE

 Haridevpur Adarsha Samiti: 

 What does it take to make a 32-ft-high and 35-ft-wide 

 pandal in south Calcutta? Around 80 lakh nails! And 

 if that is not enough, the theme of sarbadharma 

 (religious harmony) has been etched out with the 

 iron dust residue from the nails by creating 3-D figures 

 on the pandal walls depicting six different religions. 

 WHAT 

 A MAIZE!

 Dharamtala Sporting Club: 

 What does it take to transport a maize field from 

 Punjab to Kasba? Some 15,000 bhuttas (maize). 

 The idols, the ornaments, the decorations and even 

 the chandelier are made from some part of the bhutta. 

 The seeds have been roasted and ground for colour, 

 maize models depict various scenes of rustic life. 

 The idols are set against clay maize plants, coloured 

 green.

 STAMP 

 DUTY

 Sadhana Sangha: What does 

 it take to recreate Tarashankar Bandopadhyays Daak 

 Harkara? More than 200,000 used and discarded 

 stamps from all over the world. Yes, thats what decorates 

 the arched entrance gateway, the mandap and 

 the idol at this Hazra Road club in its diamond jubilee 

 year. The backdrop is a giant stamp from Nepal. 

 HAND 

 OF GOD

 Netaji Sangha: Football 

 fever is the name of the game at this Palta puja. 

 The Devi resembles Mother India, handing over the 

 World Cup to winning Italian captain Cannavaro, while 

 French captain Zidane and German striker Klose look 

 on. The pandal resembles the Munich stadium and the 

 insides, the Berlin stadium.

 HAIR 

 CARE

 41 Pally: Combing in search 

 of themes, this puja has hit upon what else? combs. 

 The tool that tribals, from Orissa to Arunachal Pradesh, 

 use to keep their tresses in order adorn the panels 

 as well as the Devis neck (as ornaments) in this 

 Bivas Mukherjee creation being worshipped at Haridevpur.

Life

 Dishing out favourites for five decades

 A 

 thought for food

 Circa 1956: Crabmeat 

 Cocktail to kick off a feast that moves on to the Fish Florentines 

 (bekti steak baked with cheese sauce and chopped spinach) 

 and Chicken Sicillienes, and rounds off with a Cold Everest. 

 Stanley Gomes serenading the lunch tables with his haunting 

 violin solos and Pam Craine belting out a sizzling set to 

 warm the dance floor at dinnertime?

 Circa 2006: For 

 starters, you can still mull over a Minestrone Italienne 

 or a house-favourite Mulligatawny Soup, before 

 tucking into a portion of Fish a la Diana (bekti stuffed 

 with prawn cooked in cream sauce) or a Chicken Chipolata. 

 Only, the glass dance floor with coloured lights beneath 

 has been done away with, and theres no live band to 

 entertain diners...

 Interiors of Mocambo 

 on Mirza Ghalib Street. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 For 50 years, Mocambo on Free 

 School Street (now Mirza Ghalib Street) has stuck to its 

 original avatar, serving its authentic Continental 

 cuisine to a satisfied clientele with considerable 

 consistency, without ever having to seriously reinvent.

 Quite a rarity in our times. Yes, 

 we have never felt the need to tamper with a successful 

 formula that has worked for us for half a century, 

 says present owner Nitin Kothari. His father, the late Shivji 

 V. Kothari, started the 110-cover eatery in the summer of 

 1956, as a cosy, European-style restaurant serving 

 straight-ahead delicacies from the Continent.

 This was the first restaurant 

 of its kind in India, with an Italian chef-manager (Prandhi), 

 a German interior architect (Messerschmidt) and a six-piece 

 live band (fronted by Anton Menezes) that played a heady 

 mix of jazz, blues, pop and rock, recalls Nitin.

 At 59, he is hands-on at the helm, 

 with son Siddharth on board as well, painstakingly guarding 

 one of the last remaining old-world bastions in the Park 

 Street area.

 True, theres no dancing 

 and live music anymore, but on the food front, absolutely 

 nothing has changed, and we have taken extra care to retain 

 the recipes as they were, stresses Nitin.

 The initial menu was designed 

 by Prandhi himself, which explains the generous sprinkling 

 of Italian dishes like Chicken Milanese and Chicken Tetrazzini 

 (chicken fillet cooked with pasta and green peppers and 

 mushrooms in a sherry sauce). The Latino master had meticulously 

 trained Jerome Gomes as his understudy to help preserve 

 the flair and flavour.

 Gomes remained loyal to Mocambo 

 all through and was retained way beyond the superannuating 

 age of 58 by a grateful management. I even provided 

 him with a chair in the kitchen when he could no longer 

 stand, and asked him to simply oversee operations, 

 remembers Nitin, also vice-president of the Hotel and Restaurant 

 Association of Eastern India.

 While Gomes started his own signature 

 dish Fish a la Jerome, he also perfected such perennial 

 favourites like Greek Drunken Prawns and Devilled Crab (crabmeat 

 speciality in cheese and mustard sauce served in the shell 

 from which it came). He even improvised a fiery variety 

 of the dish, Pepper Crab Devilled.

 The ambience was extremely 

 laid-back in those days, with the emphasis on a good dining 

 experience, not just grabbing a bite, and lunch would 

 stretch on till four in the afternoon.

 You could even bump into Uttam 

 Kumar or Suchitra Sen, Sharmila Tagore and the Tiger 

 Pataudi, Amitabh Bachchan or Sanjeev Kumar ? enjoying a 

 quiet Conti meal.

 We even parcelled food for 

 Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi to be served on board 

 their aircraft. Although Mocambo has been known for its 

 Continental cuisine, we have always had a strong Indian 

 menu to complement that, and even pinched a crack cook, 

 Laab Singh, from the Maharaja of Patiala, smiles Nitin.

 Nonetheless, its still the 

 firang food one associates the place with. Its Chicken 

 Orientale a la Mocambo (chicken fillet cooked in wine and 

 cream sauce with buttered rice, mushroom, fresh tomato and 

 topped with asparagus and boiled egg) tastes just the way 

 it used to a few decades back, the management, now running 

 into its third generation, pledges.

 Absolutely nothing has changed 

 in 50 years, down to the original colour scheme laid out 

 by Messerschmidt. This is repeated every time the place 

 is repainted, and the waiters are turned out in starched 

 white till date.

 However, we have had to 

 relax the entry barriers a touch over the years. So you 

 dont need to be in a dinner jacket to pass through 

 the main door anymore. The idea is to broadbase the magic 

 of Mocambo, signs off Nitin.

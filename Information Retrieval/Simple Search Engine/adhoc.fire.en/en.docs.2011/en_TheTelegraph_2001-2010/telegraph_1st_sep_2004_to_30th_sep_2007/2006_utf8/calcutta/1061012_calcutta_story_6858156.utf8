 What: 

 Launch of amita.g, a fashion label. 

 Where: Cocoon, 28/2 Shakespeare 

 Sarani.

 When: October 8.

 Take a look: Ishika, Tina, Shreya Pandey, Madhabilata and Jessica catwalked in long flowing jackets, salwar-kameez, sari, wedding wear and party attire from amita.g. The new label has been named after designer Amita Ganeriwala, who already boasts a pret label Raaga.

 The range comprises jackets embellished with kantha in muted earthy hues like burnt orange and fuchsia pink. Salwar suits in pastel shades and deeper hues of maroon and pink are given a dressy look with patchwork and embroidered yokes, many of which have been worked upon with acid and alcohol dyeing.

 Crushed lehngas in vibrant colours with gota work and block printing are ideal for the pre-wedding season or for Diwali buys. Party clothes consist largely of tunics in different styles and short kurtis with belts around the low waist. The fabrics used are mainly georgettes, chiffons, cottons and nets. The label will be retailed from the shelves of Simaaya (Elgin Road), Zenon (Park Street) and Finesse (Alipore).

 Pocket pinch: Saris and lehngas start from Rs 5,000; kurtis and tunics are Rs 1,500-plus.

 Voiceover: My label targets 20-plus girls who are out of college and looking to get married. It is a trendy and urban look, the basic idea being to blend traditional designs with western patterns, smiles designer Amita.

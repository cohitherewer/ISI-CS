Life

 An attractive all-rounder

 A petite lady with a disarming smile and easy confidence, she is someone you would be tempted to term Jack of all trades, and master of some.

 Syllonni, born into a liberal family in Delhi, is a gold medallist in badminton, has been a fashion designer, has pursued kathak, picked up painting as a hobby, takes interest in interiors, is currently busy with her musical career and already has a solo album ? yes, Syllonni ? to her credit.

 I believe in God and I guess I have been blessed to have got the opportunity to try my hand at so many things. My family has always been a pillar of strength and support... Music is not a passing phase and is here to stay as my profession, grins the gorgeous girl, in town on Saturday to perform at Tantra.

 Music has already left quite a mark on her ? once known as Binu, she christened herself Syllonni to boost her musical career. In this profession a charismatic name counts. Moreover, it suits me astrologically, smiles the believer in numerology.

 Brought up in a family of sportspersons, Syllonni is a graduate in philosophy from Hansraj College. Her father M.L. Rishi used to be a volleyball player. I was into sports but looked at badminton as a short-term goal. I am a creative person and always wanted to explore my artistic side, says the lady who even captained her college at the national student championships and remains a frequent visitor to the gym till date. After college, there was a brief stint with NIFT before she began designing independently. Nothing is as elegant yet comfortable as the sari and salwar suit, feels Syllonni.

 Music has been a constant factor in my life. Music is my first love and brings me closer to God. My mother was the first to realise that I had the potential to make it big as a singer. When I decided to take up music seriously, everything else took a backseat. I am a perfectionist and believe in doing one thing at a time, says the lady currently training under Guru Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Pandit Satya Narayan Mishra.

 Riyaaz is like an exercise for tonal quality and the voice. So riyaaz for a couple of hours in the morning is a must for Syllonni, who accompanied Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasiya and Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma on the tanpura in a musical concert in Dubai, a few years ago.

 Her album, released in the first week of March, is a compilation of eight songs out of which two are remixes of her slower versions of Macha Halla and Main Syllonni by DJ Akbar Sami.

 They are my songs. Technical elements and beats have made them peppier, she says, picking title track Bheegi chandni and Tu na humse as her personal favourites.

 The music of the album has been scored by Richard Kaashi while Shyam Anuragi, Salim Binjori and Vibha have penned the lyrics. The songs, a fusion of western, jazz, pop, Arabic and Punjabi sensibilities, are melodious, and somewhere down the line, romantic.

 The Bheegi chandni video features Hazel Rosedawn, of Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire fame, as as one of the three girls. The colourful video, aesthetically picturised has been shot at plush locations in Austria, Manali and Shimla.

 I am looking at playback offers, reveals Sylloni, who hopes to sing for A.R. Rahman. Among her favourite singers are Beyonce, Nazia Hassan and Asha Bhonsle. I also love the way Shreya Ghoshal sang Jadoo hai nasha hai, she adds.

 After Tantra, Syllonni travels to Hyderabad, Jaipur and Lucknow.

 The lady who will be back in Mumbai to play Holi with friends claims to be in love with Calcutta. The people are very warm and loving. I try and avoid sweets, but just cant seem to resist the tempting rosogollas here, she admits.

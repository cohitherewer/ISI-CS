The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Don 

 silences critics with cash

 - Remake emerges highest-ever first-week grosser in year of hit parade

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 The second-week posters have kept it simple: Don ke critic ki sabse bada galti hai ki woh Don ka critic hai!

 And they have got it dead right in Donspeak (Don ke dushman ki sabse bada galti hai ki woh Don ka dushman hai!). Despite critics panning the new Don Farhan Akhtars remake of the Chandra Barot film the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer has emerged as the highest first-week grosser in Calcutta for 2006. And thats no mean feat in the year of the hit parade Rang De Basanti, Fanaa, Krrish, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and Lage Raho Munnabhai.

 With a gross collection of Rs 1.8 crore at the box-office, Dons is one of the best-ever first-week collections of all time, Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films, the distributor of the film in Bengal, tells Metro. Even on a weekday like Thursday, when India was playing West Indies, a central Calcutta standalone theatre like Paradise ran house-full shows all day!

 Ironically, the opening of the new Don has been dramatically opposite to how the old Don arrived at theatres back in 1978. It had a weak first week, since we couldnt hype the release because of shortage of funds, recalls Barot. But once Khaike paan Banaraswala became a rage, the audiences started coming in.

 The other Diwali release, Jaan-e-Mann, touted as a big threat to Don, has turned out to be a disaster in Calcutta. The number of daily shows per plex of the Salman-Preity-Akshay film has dropped to four or five, while Don boasts seven to eight shows a day.

 Don is also the biggest first-week grosser for INOX (Forum), this year. Not only has the Elgin Road four-screener registered 98 per cent occupancy, it has also recorded more than 15 block bookings. 

 After Lage Raho Munnabhai (September 1), the audience has been waiting for a big film with good content and that is where Don delivers, feels Vikas Syal, general manager of INOX (Forum). Besides Shah Rukhs star power, families are coming back for Khaike or Yeh mera dil.

 The frenzy at the Priya ticket counter is a case in point. Says owner Arijit Dutta: Don closed at 92 per cent at Priya, which is huge these days. Krrish was big too, but nothing to match this craze.

 And how long will the Don chase last? Given the genre of the film, it may not have a long run, but it should easily stay big for the next few weeks, says distributor Soni.

 Till Dhoom 2 vrrrooms in.

 St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, is going places. The alumni association of the institute, recently made a deemed university, has opened an office in Mumbai.

 On April 15, an 11-member delegation, led by Father P.C. Mathew, principal of the college and president of St Xavier?s College Calcutta Alumni Association, inaugurated the west zone chapter.

 ?The contribution of the alumni association towards building the brand equity of St Xavier?s is incalculable. The dream of the second campus in Calcutta is yet to be achieved, and the alumni association is doing its best to achieve it,? said Father Mathew.

 The association, which had inaugurated its Singapore chapter in September 2005, took the first step towards creating a presence in the country beyond the boundaries of Bengal on Poila Baisakh.

 ?With so many developments on so many fronts, this is an extremely exciting time for both the college and the alumni association. Opening our west zone chapter is a big step towards establishing the alumni?s presence on a national scale,? said Imran Zaki, secretary of the association.

 With almost 250 members joining the Mumbai chapter, association officials are hoping to turn it into one of the most high-profile alumni bases in the country.

 ?We have had a tremendous response from our brethren in Mumbai, and are quite positive that they will take the necessary steps to push the St Xavier?s profile to the next level. In fact, a member of the newly-formed chapter immediately presented us with a cheque of Rs 51,000 to be used towards paying the fees of students with limited means,? added Zaki.

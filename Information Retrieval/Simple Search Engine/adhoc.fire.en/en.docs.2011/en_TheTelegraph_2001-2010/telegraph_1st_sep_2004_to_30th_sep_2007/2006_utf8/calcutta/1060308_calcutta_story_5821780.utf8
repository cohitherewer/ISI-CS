 Cheaper carriers adopt e-tickets

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 With a slew of airlines trying to turn their low-cost-no-frills approach to domestic air travel into a success, the technology used in customer management is undergoing a sea change as well.

 One of the main innovations adopted by these airlines is the replacement of old-style paper tickets with e-tickets that can be booked over the Internet.

 While a normal ticket would cost $9 to produce, an e-ticket costs a mere $1, thus significantly cutting down on company expenditure as well a being of much greater convenience to the customer.

 IT giant HCL has secured the services of several airlines, including a Rs 1-crore deal with Air Deccan. ?Air Deccan was looking at hi-tech methods, and we provided a new dimension to their air service, using the same principles used in the US and Europe with great success,? said George Paul, executive vice president of HCL. ?Now Air Deccan is making Rs 2-3 crore.?

 Other airlines that are adopting HCL?s system are Spicejet, Paramount, Go and Air-India Express. HCL?s advantages include domestic and international virtual private networks (VPNs), crucial local area network deployment and facilities management.

 But it?s the remote reach that works as a major plus for the IT major.

 ?In less-connected rural areas, HCL?s systems have been excellent at dealing with problems that occasionally occur,? said Colonel Arvind Saxena, spokesperson for Air Deccan.

 Low-cost air travel has revolutionised the tourist industry in Europe, especially after the price of air fares fell in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. 

 A similar style of travel now looks set to dominate on the subcontinent as well. 

 With the International Air Transport Association (IATA) soon set to demand a 100 per cent e-ticketing system from the ?low-cost? airlines, more carriers are expected to better utilise technology in their services.

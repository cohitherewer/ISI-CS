 Junoon, a way 

 of life

 Singer SALMAN AHMAD tells 

 Pratim D. Gupta that he may have gone solo

 MUSIC 

 ZONE

 Is 

 your coming out with a solo album the last nail in the coffin 

 for Junoon?

 Infiniti is an album which 

 encompasses my love for classic rock (Led Zeppelin, Beatles, 

 Santana), Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and R. D. Burmans 

 era of Bollywood music. 

 When I came up with the name Junoon 

 for my band in a dream long ago, I copyrighted it immediately 

 because Junoon stands for a state of mind, body and soul 

 and can never be extinguished. 

 You will be seeing Junoon appear 

 in different incarnations in the times to come. And Salman 

 Ahmad is one of them.

 How difficult do you feel it 

 is to break out from a successful band and create an individual 

 identity?

 Sting, Paul McCartney, Phil Collins 

 and others who have followed the solo path show that song-writing 

 is the key element of any artistes identity. They 

 have had careers which have outlasted the length of their 

 bands musical output. 

 Music is my junoon and 

 songs like Ghoom tana inspire me to embrace change 

 and to keep creating new songs for old and new listeners.

 So, is Infiniti the 

 reflection of a state of mind or the culmination of a long 

 musical journey?

 Infiniti reflects both 

 a musical and a geographical journey. I grew up in the US 

 and South Asia and was inspired by the poetry and music 

 of both east and west, rock and qawwali. 

 I recorded it in New York with 

 John Alec (Edgar Winter Band), Jay Dittamo (Frank Zappa 

 Band) and my tabla-dholak percussionist Ashiq Ali. 

 By experiencing both cultures 

 my music and poetry expresses an emotional language which 

 my audience find real and honest. 

 Since my mothers family 

 came from Patiala, I dedicated Infiniti to the people 

 of Patiala and my grandparents. Deepak Chopra recently asked 

 me to provide Ghoom tana for his film How To Know 

 God because he was looking for music which expressed 

 love, hope and unity in a traditional and a modern sense. 

 Ghoom tana shares the film 

 soundtrack with Madonnas Om shanti from her 

 album Ray of Light.

 Has Infiniti brought 

 out the best in you? 

 Infiniti has given me the 

 opportunity to express a much deeper emotion and explore 

 a wider palette of sound colours than any of my previous 

 albums with Junoon. 

 As an artiste Im always 

 trying to break new musical ground and in songs like Ghoom 

 tana, Alvida, Yaar main nachoongi, Do 

 dil, Main tumse door and Sagar, people 

 get to hear an eclectic yet memorable collection of love 

 songs, both romantic and spiritual.

 What has been the reaction 

 to the album from your Junoon mates Ali and Brian?

 Since Im based in New York, 

 most of my interaction has been with Brian and he said something 

 which struck me. 

 Brian said that Infiniti 

 reveals my real persona and still manages to push the envelope. 

 i said that he wished he had been 

 on the album.

 Ali himself and now Fuzons 

 Shafqat Amanat Ali have sung in Hindi movies. Do you not 

 want to join the Bollywood bandwagon?

 Well, as I said, I have just provided 

 Ghoom tana for Deepak Chopras film. 

 Now I am in talks with Wyclef 

 Jean to do a possible collaboration. But yes, I would love 

 to have a song in a Karan Johar film.

 Finally, is junooni 

 for life?

 Junooni is for this life 

 and beyond.

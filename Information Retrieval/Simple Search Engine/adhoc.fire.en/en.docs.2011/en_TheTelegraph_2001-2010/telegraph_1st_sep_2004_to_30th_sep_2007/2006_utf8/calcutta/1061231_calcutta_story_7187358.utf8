Life

 Year of the bubble amp; bling

 HIGH-WAISTED DRESSES, BALLOON HEMLINES, METALLIC HUES, COOL CROCHET, PRETTY PLEATS AND BEADED NECKWEAR...THE STYLE STORY OF 2006 WAS ABOUT ALL THIS AMP; MORE. SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY REWINDS

 Metallic shades were major

 Look

 The beginning of 2006 saw a cleaning-up act in fashion. Neat silhouettes, tailored uppers, slim lowersthe look was straight and structured. A return to simplicity and classicism was the mood low on bling and high on elegance. 

 As the year progressed, however, layers were back with a bang. Pile-on was big, with dresses, skirts, tops, leggings, churi pants, shrugs, jacketsmixed and matched in various combinations.

 What started as a fuss-free fashion year ended with bling being the buzzword. Metallic hues, shine and shimmer was back with a bang and dominated the look of the later half of the year.

 The year saw a few important shifts as well. The waistline moved up and so did the hemline. The waist is back to where it actually should be, is how designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee explained the shift. The higher the better emerged as the rule for the waistline.

 The hemline lingered around the knee, be it in dresses or skirts. The knee-length dress was the it silhouette and skirts too stopped at the knee.

 The bubble hemline can perhaps be dubbed the most important fashion development of the year. In dresses, skirts, tops, tunics and kurtas, the bubble or balloon hem provided a twist to every tale.

 The bubble was big

 Silhouettes

 If 2005 was the year of skirts, 2006 was definitely dedicated to dresses. And this year they came in all shapes and sizes from floor-kissing high-waisted gowns (remember the Sabyasachi black number catwalked by Katrina Kaif at the Lakme Fashion Week finale in November?) to the mid-thigh hotties (Aki Narulas sizzling silver number made famous by Priyanka Chopra in Don).

 A-line, trapeze, shift, baby doll, empire-line, bubble, balloon, coat, tentvariety was the name of the dress game.

 But while all the shapes were visible on ramps as well as racks, the balloon dress hovering around the knee emerged the winner, followed closely by the trapeze. The balloon dress, stopping at the knee or a few inches below it, made an appearance in collections of every designer worth his/her stitch.

 The other silhouette that started creeping in towards the later part of 2005 and flooded wardrobes this year is the tunic. The kurta got a smart makeover, often with a collar and a belt, and emerged in a whole new avatar of the tunic. The tunic made its appearance in every kind of wardrobe from the college-goers wardrobe in the form of floral printed cottons to the party-going fashionistas in flowing fabrics jazzed up with embellished belts.

 Colours

 The year started with gorgeous greens and deep purples on the party palette. But with the first hint of spring, the greens mellowed to olives and the purples paled to lilacs. A white summer saw hues of ivories, ecru, beiges and soft pastels colouring the racks. Earthy hues were seen aplenty throughout the year, with browns making a strong appearance in the last few months.

 When designers readied for winter, the colour story moved to brighter tones, with red being the hue of the season. Vermilion, burgundy, wine, scarlet, bloodtheyre all in favour.

 The other strong twist to the colour story of 2006 was the metallic mood. Both gold and silver were a rage towards the end of the year. A gorgeous gold (think Kareenas halter number in Don) or a sizzling silver (recall Surily Goels bubble dress sported by Rhea Pillai the Lakme Fashion Week ramp in November) item has been a must-have feature in almost every designers winter line. The metallic shine and shimmer was even more prominent as embellishments, and not just in trousseau wear. Even dresses, jackets and tops flaunted enough bling in the form of metallic ornamentation.

 Pink was big for men throughout the year, breathing in a whiff of fresh air into the staid blues, blacks and whites.

 Techniques

 Manish Malhotra made a spectacle of it with his all-white line at the Lakme Fashion Week in March and fashionistas lapped up the crochet. As whole dresses, skirts or stoles or as trimmings and ornamentation, the crochet has been widely visible.

 The other technique that found favour was cutwork. Pleats box, narrow, pintucks was used extensively. 

 Applique, lacework, patchwork, ruching and smocking were used generously, in addition to the evergreen threadwork.

 Leg focus

 Turned-up denims, leggings, cigarette pants, churi pantsthe year gone by saw a strong fashion focus on the legs. The shapes were slimmer, contouring the legs perfectly.

 Leggings were back like never before from sheer stockings to lycra tights and were teamed with anything and everything, be it a super-short skirt, a bubble dress or an ethnic knee-length kurta. Churi pants were used generously, often to lend a desi touch to dresses and jackets. Turned-up denims overshadowed every other shape, making it the strongest trend in jeans since bootlegs.

 Accessories

 The style spotlight was on the neck and chunky was spelt with a capital C. The one bold piece concept has been finally driven home and the ears mostly went minimal.

 Long multiple strands of beads combined with metallic bits encircled the neck, being crowned the accessory piece of 2006. From the street junk markets to the hautest of designer stores, these beaded beauties were on offer for every budget and to be teamed with every silhouette. 

 For the classier types, matte metallic pieces in geometric patterns were hot. Even in precious jewellery, bold was in, with uncut stones and diamonds ruling.

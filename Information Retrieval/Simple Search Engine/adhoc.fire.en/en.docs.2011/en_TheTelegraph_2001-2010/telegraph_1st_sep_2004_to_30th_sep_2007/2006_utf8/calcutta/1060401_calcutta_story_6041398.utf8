The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CAS men seek six months

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With only 10 days left for Delhi High Court?s conditional access system (CAS) implementation deadline to run out, the April 10 date is set to come and go without viewers in the four metros being empowered with the choice of channels.

 Broadcasters, multi-system operators (MSO), cable operators and consumer organisations from across the country, including Calcutta, met government officials for the second round of discussions in New Delhi on Friday.

 At the meeting chaired by information and broadcasting secretary S.K. Arora, an alliance of MSOs presented its roll-out calendar while operator groups from across the country sought ?at least six more months? for CAS roll-out.

 On Monday, the information and broadcasting ministry had convened a meeting of CAS stakeholders. Following the meeting, the ministry had asked representatives of each city to prepare a CAS calendar.

 The Centre reportedly informed participants that with the frequent meetings, it is trying to avoid a situation where any of the stakeholders is unhappy and approaches court to stop CAS.

 ?As at Monday?s talks, a demand was made on Friday, too, that broadcasters declare a la carte channel pricing and work out the revenue-share model,? said an operator from Calcutta.

 The stakeholders will take up the debate again on Monday.

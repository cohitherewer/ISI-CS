 Glimpses of Adda

 Synonymous with the once popular jingle Arambagher taaja murgir moja, the Arambagh Hatcheries Limited success story flew on the wings of its processed chicken concept, through numerous retail outlets.

 A household name today, Arambaghs Chicken is spread all over Calcutta through 74 stores and 18 convenience stores under the Arambaghs Food Mart.

 And now, the chicken chain has decided not to put all its eggs in one retail basket.

 Proof of the diversification plan: Adda Bites, the first of many coffee shops, unveiled at Kasba on Friday evening.

 We are already a household brand name. This is an effort to add more value to the integrated poultry business, said Prasun Roy, managing director, Arambagh Hatcheries Ltd.

 Conceptualised about six months back ? yes, before bird flu became a fear and sent chicken sales plummeting ? the first Adda Bites, just a few yards from Arambaghs Food Mart on the Kasba connector, took a month to complete.

 This Rs 15-lakh offering at 405 Rajendra Main Road, close to Ruby General Hospital, takes up 600 sq ft.

 The area had nothing like this before. Moreover, with cafes and lounges doing well all over, this should definitely prove to be a successful undertaking, added Roy. 

 lustrations that read Ektu Time Pass, etched walls, ceiling lamps, suspenders, a leather seater placed at one corner and glass tables, all create a warm appeal at Adda Bites. A glass wall at one end accentuates the look. A flat screen allows you to catch the latest happenings of the day. 

 The seating arrangements accommodate 37 people. And if you want to enjoy the cool breeze on a late summer evening there are seating arrangement outside as well.

 Open on all days, the sip-and-bite timings are from 9 am to 10 pm.

 On offer are coffee, mocktails, ice cream, sundae, coolers, coladas and more.

 The solid spread offers an assortment of Continental, Thai and Chinese snacks and meals.

 Those walking in hungry can hang out over Lung Fung Soup Prawn, Mongolian Fish, Chicken Banana Leaf, Corn, Cheese Triangle and more.

 In the liquid category there is Caf? Latte, Caf? Adda Bites, Ginger Spice and Orange Tango to name just a few. 

 Another coffee-cum-adda outlet will soon be coming up at Dover Lane.

 We plan to tap zones close to residential areas where something like this is missing and is sure to catch on fast, explained Prasun Roy. 

 The target audience is clearly the young brigade. As the name suggests, we want to create the ambience for loads of adda and provide for a sumptuous array of good bites for them, stressed Biyas Roy, senior manager, corporate affairs, Arambagh Hatcheries Limited.

 And she vehemently denied any role of the bird flu in the chicken chains decision to go the coffee shop route. 

 Bird Flu never happened. We kept on supplying chicken to major restaurants in the city. Adda Bites has nothing to do with exploring safer options for we believe today is the best time for everything, she summed up.

 For the Bypass brigade, its certainly a good time for adda between bites.

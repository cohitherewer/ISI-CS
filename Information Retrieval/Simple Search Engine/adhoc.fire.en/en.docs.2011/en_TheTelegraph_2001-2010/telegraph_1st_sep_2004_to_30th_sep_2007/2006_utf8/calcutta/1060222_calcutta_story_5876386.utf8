 An everlasting quest to discover the environmental melody created by geometry and art has led Arunendu Banerjee to create a series of paintings, writings, sculptures and installations that reflects nature?s inherent tendency to assimilate diverse forces and maintain equilibrium. In his works, he is inspired by Tagore and Walter Gropius; he considers both of them the forerunners of modern art and architecture of the East and West. Expanded Space: Design, Art, Engineering, the ongoing exhibition of Banerjee?s works, offers a unique aesthetic experience in which images, lines and drawings combine to give an impression of organic geometry, achieved through imagination and creativity. Poetic expressions, varied imagery, brick, cement and mortar, as well as recycled construction wastes and reinforcements, are found to transcend their traditional identities, transforming into sculptural installations, murals and architecture ? exceptional representations of the artist?s ?engineered design-forms?.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings, writings and installations by Arunendu Banerjee 

When: Till February 27, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

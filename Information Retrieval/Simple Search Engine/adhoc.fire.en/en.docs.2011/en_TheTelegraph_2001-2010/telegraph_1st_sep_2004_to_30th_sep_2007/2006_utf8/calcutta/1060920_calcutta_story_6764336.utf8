 We Ask You Answer

 Spare vendor, curb maker

 Todays question: Should vendors 

 be penalised for using plastic containers?

 Plastic benefit: A rickshaw-puller makes a raincoat 

 of what clogs the drains.

 S. Rai Chowdhury,

 College Street

 The vendors should not be punished for using plastic products. 

 Many companies continue to produce plastic products and 

 many people prefer to have tea and coffee in plastic cups. 

 Tuhin Purkayastha, 

 Parnashree Pally

 Imposing a stiff fine on vendors is the only way to make 

 them stop using plastic containers. Plastic products block 

 the drains. Disposing of them is a headache .

 Md. Sarfaraz Alam, 

 Kamarhati

 Both vendors and their customers should be penalised for 

 using plastic products. Pollution is one of the most critical 

 problems facing us and plastic is a primary cause of it. 

 It can neither be burned nor buried safely. The best way 

 to tackle the spread of plastic is by creating awareness.

 Sohini Roy,

 Sarat Chatterjee Avenue 

 Before penalising vendors for using plastic containers, 

 the government should do something to stop their production. 

 As long as the manufacture of plastic products continues, 

 their use cannot be stopped.

 A . Chatterjee, 

 Kalindi

 Traders and their patrons should both be penalised for using 

 plastic products. The government must enforce a ban to make 

 people use jute and paper bags instead of plastic packets.

 Suchanda Sen,

 Bally

 Yes, because plastic containers are doing a lot of harm 

 to our environment. Being non-biodegradable, they destroy 

 the fertility of the soil and block drains and water channels. 

 Plastic packets if eaten by stray animals can cause their 

 death.

 Ranesh Chandra Dey,

 Parnashree

 Plastic poses a threat to the environment, but banning it 

 would cause financial loss to vendors. The administration 

 should find a way of recycling plastic. Penalising vendors 

 would lead to protests, and the government will eventually 

 have to backtrack. Given that the government cannot even 

 introduce green fuel in the city, I think we will have to 

 learn to live with plastic. 

 Arindam Basu,

 Bisharpara

 Food kept in plastic containers is harmful for the body. 

 Therefore, the government should impose a heavy fine on 

 the vendors for using such containers. Plastic containers 

 were banned in Sikkim a few years ago. We should follow 

 suit as early as possible.

 A .F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly 

 No. It is the customers who demand plastic bags from vendors. 

 Why isnt the government forcing the plastic manufacturers 

 to stop production? In the absence of a clear policy, the 

 authorities should not penalise anybody for using plastic 

 products. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur

 The manufacturers of plastic should be penalised instead. 

 The vendors use plastic containers because they are the 

 cheapest option. They should not be made scapegoats in the 

 fight against plastic.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 Of course. Unless vendors are penalised for using plastic 

 containers, their use cannot be stopped. However, use of 

 plastic products of the stipulated thickness should not 

 attract punishment. However, it would be virtually impossible 

 to ensure that all plastic containers in use are of the 

 required thickness.

 Paramananda Pal,

 Kararya Road

 One of the main reasons behind the choking of the citys 

 sewage lines is the use of plastic bags. The law banning 

 the use of plastic below a certain thickness has never been 

 implemented. It is high time the law-enforcing agencies 

 take steps against vendors who use plastic bags. 

 N. Dutta Ray,

 Belur

 The rampant use of plastic containers is not a recent phenomenon. 

 For years, we have cultivated this habit of using plastic 

 packets, which clog the drains. Vendors using plastic packets 

 should have been taken to task long back. The public should 

 be made aware of the dangers of using plastic products.

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum

 Teachers can educate the young generation about the ill-effects 

 of using plastic. A massive drive should be undertaken to 

 build public opinion on the issue. Along with these steps, 

 vendors should be penalised for using plastic containers.

 Ronita Dutta,

 Jadavpur

 The use of plastic containers is disastrous for the environment. 

 Why is the government not cracking down on the use of plastic, 

 when it has been banned all over the world? Penalising only 

 the vendors will be unfair.

 A . Ayaz,

 Serampore

 Blaming the vendors for the problem is not right. Their 

 customers are just as guilty. They compel the vendors to 

 use plastic containers.

 Kaberi Mukherjee,

 Santosh Roy Road

 No. It is the customers who should be punished for disposing 

 off plastic cups and packets irresponsibly. Why dont they 

 go for shopping with a bag? That would certainly cut down 

 on use of plastic.

 CALCUTTA COLUMN

 Welcome on wrong mount

 The Gariahat crossing is chock-a-block 

 with hoardings, mostly on various pujas. One advertisement 

 sticks out inviting customers to a sari shop next door. 

 It proclaims that the Devi is coming in a boat this year, 

 while in fact her vehicle is a palanquin (dola). It is atrocious 

 that the minimum effort was not put in to collect the correct 

 information before putting out an advertisement in a public 

 place. The hoarding should be immediately removed so as 

 not to mislead the public.

 Krishna Banerjee,

 Jodhpur Park.

 Indecent ads

 The government should at once 

 ban the indecent representation of women on the billboards 

 along the roads. This has become an eyesore plus it distracts 

 drivers and passengers which may lead to accidents and mishaps. 

 The Tamil Nadu government has banned such hoardings. As 

 citizens, we should speak up against such advertisements.

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed, 

 Hooghly.

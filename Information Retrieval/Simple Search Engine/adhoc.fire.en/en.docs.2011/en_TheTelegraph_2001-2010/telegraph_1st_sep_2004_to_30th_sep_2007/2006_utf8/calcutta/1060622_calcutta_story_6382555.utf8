 The veteran saxophone player is a regular feature at the age-old confectionery shop every Friday. But on Wednesday afternoon, when Paul Mullick hit the first notes at Flurys, it was something special. 

 Paul kicked off, for the second year running, the World Music Day celebrations in Calcutta.

 Its a great feeling to start off this event again. People actually called up to ask when and where I was playing, smiled the saxophonist who has been a constant on Park Street since the 1970s.

 The third edition of Fete de la Musique, organised by The French Association and The Park, then travelled across the city for a variety of music. As the evening progressed, the tempo picked up with bands bubbling under like Eyeris and The Hobos to Someplace Else regulars like Span and Gary Lawyer.

 It was the French duo of singer Hannah Hais and DJ David Chong, however, that music lovers seemed most curious about. Hais and Chong were equally interested to know about the city and its people.

 Were amazed by the Indian people. In France, people carry their troubles with them to work and everywhere else. Here they dont, said Chong. 

 On their first visit to India, Calcutta is their fourth stop after Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai.

 Hannah, born into a musical family, took to singing at a young age. My music is house music but very alive and joyful at the same time. Though the language is French, I want to take it all over the world, said the singer who writes her own songs and counts Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra and Stevie Wonder as some of her influences.

 My pleasure is to make people happy, said David, adding that DJs should not be stuck in one style but should make the party no matter what the mood. 

 But I have so far found Indians to be very open-minded, like in Israel, offered the DJ who has already fallen in love with some of the tracks from Devdas and Lagaan.

 As for the concept of World Music Day gaining popularity in countries like India, both Hannah and David were glad that the French initiative had come so far, but felt that only one day in a year was not enough.

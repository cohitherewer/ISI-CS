 He bargains, he buys, he makes or breaks a product he is the consumer, and he rules. This was established yet again at the third edition of the Consumer Connect Awards hosted by Advertising Club Calcutta, in association with The Telegraph and other partners.

 Held at the Royal Bengal Room in City Centre on Saturday, the awards hailed the effectiveness of advertisement.

 As Sandip Chaudhuri, coordinator, Consumer Connect Awards, put it: We look at how well the advertisement works in the market; how well it connects with the consumer.

 A thorough research on consumer feedback where the brand is exposed to the target capsule, presentations judged by big guns from the advertising industry and audience votes are tabulated to decide the winner. From 60 entries, 22 were short-listed.

 Marketing, advertising and communication gurus Kiran Khalap, Shiloo Chattopadhyay, Ram Ray, Prof. Sudas Roy, V. Shantakumar and Sunil Alagh judged the presentations on the basis of assessment of the ad task, understanding the consumer and advertising solution.

 The Consumer Services award category recorded 19 entries out of which seven were nominated. FCB Ulka, Mumbai, for Naukri.com walked away with the national award, while the Calcutta award went to Radio Mirchi for the Calcutta Police Friendship Cup promos. 

 The Consumer Durables award with 16 entries and six nominees was won by FCB Ulka, Mumbai, for Indica V2, with Response, Calcutta, winning the local chapter for Sreeleathers.

 The FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) category had the maximum entries, 23, of which nine were nominated. The national trophy went to JWT, Delhi, for Kurkure.

 The Calcutta chapter had a single nominee in Response, Calcutta, for Big Ones. The judges decided there would be no winners in this category. Also, the Public Sector category had two entries, but none was nominated.

 Among the big ones, The Agency of the Year (national) award went to JWT for the second time in a row, while the Agency of the Year (Calcutta) was Response.

 The Campaign of the Year award went to FCB Ulka for Naukri.com. Prem Mehta, the man whose vision put Indian advertising on the global stage, was inducted into the Advertising Club Calcuttas Hall of Fame.

 Later in the evening, band Hip Pocket took centre stage as colleagues, friends and strangers connected over drinks, finger food and adda.

 Calling on beauties for a cause

 You can call her the India connection to Miss Universe. For it is her efforts that have been bringing Miss Universe to India every year for AIDS awareness. Many on the other face of the globe, like Paris Hilton and Alanis Morissette, would swear by her outfits, though.

 Sanjana Jon, who also counts royalty among her clients (cases in point being Princess Sara al Saud of Saudi Arabia and Princess Olivia de Borbon of Spain), has been working since the 90s with her brother Anand Jon, a familiar name in the Hollywood fashion circuit. She has also been closely associated with Donald Trumps team, designing clothes for Miss Universe for her appearances in various events. 

 Early in her career, Sanjana had got associated with Audrey Hepburns charity for children. Ever since I started my marketing consulting company, working with people like Bruce Springsteen, Backstreet Boys and Trump, I realised how much easier it was to help people if celebrities were with you, she states, over phone from New York.

 IG International, a boutique marketing and event agency, has been bringing Miss Universe to India since 2004 with the appeal Get Tested. Its in Fashion. 

 The year before, we had a fund-raiser in New York with Amelia Vega, which was built up to a fashion show in Philadelphia, attended by Manoj Night Shyamalan and the Seven Sixers basketball team. It was in aid of Chennai NGO Helping Hand, she adds.

 Sanjana admits that though Sushmita Sen and Lara Dutta won the crown much earlier, India never figured on the tour map. The need was never there. It is only in the last few years that AIDS consciousness in India is being felt to be an acute necessity. I was shocked to know that Tamil Nadu is one of the states with the highest HIV-positive count. The niece of singer Yesudas, Sanjana hails from an area on the border of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

 Another reason why India is in focus now is because 50 per cent of Indias population is under 25. It is a very young country and potentially at risk of an explosion of infection. She recalls encounters from her 2005 trip to India. There was this woman in a Chennai hospital who must have been infected by her husband who had died. Both her children were infected. And she was barely 22. Her relatives had ostracised her. 

 Another moving meeting was with an infected teenaged prostitute in Delhi who had been pushed into the trade from the age of nine. She had no idea where she got it from and to how many she had passed it on. Natalie (Glebova, Miss Universe 2005) had tears in her eyes on hearing of her plight through a translator. In fact, Natalie wants to return to India to continue the work.

 The idea to use the Miss Universe platform for AIDS awareness came to Sanjana on seeing Beyonce Knowles and Angelina Jolie promoting the cause of South Africa. Last year, when we brought Natalie down, Salman Khans whole-hearted support made a huge impact for the tour.

 This year, too, local celebrities at each stop are extending a hand of help when she comes to India in end-October with the current Miss Universe Zuleyka Mendoza.

 For Sanjana, the International Rising Star 2006 at the Vancouver Fashion Week, charity begins at home.

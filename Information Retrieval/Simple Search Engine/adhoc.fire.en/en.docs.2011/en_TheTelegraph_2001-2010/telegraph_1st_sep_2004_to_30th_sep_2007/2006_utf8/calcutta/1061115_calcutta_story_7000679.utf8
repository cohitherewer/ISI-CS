 A motorcyclist talking on his cellphone was crushed to death by a private bus at the Exide crossing of Jawaharlal Nehru Road on Tuesday afternoon.

 Two traffic constables took Surojit Bhattacharjee, 35, to SSKM Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 Bloodstains could be seen at the spot, a stones throw away from Maidan police station, even a couple of hours after the accident. The mobile phone was found beside the mangled remains of Surojits helmet.

 The driver of the bus on route 235 has been arrested and the vehicle taken to Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 Apparently, Surojit was talking on his cellphone while riding the motorcycle, said an officer. He was trying to overtake the bus, which itself was moving at high speed. The bus driver suddenly swerved right and rammed into the motorcycle. Surojit fell and his head was crushed under the rear wheels of the bus.

 It was with the help of the mobile phone that police could establish the victims identity. We called up the private service provider, who helped us locate Surojits address. Later, we informed his family, police said.

A resident of Bagbazar Street, in north Calcutta, Surojit was a bachelor and worked for a courier firm.

 He left home for his Park Street office around 9 am. The accident occurred around 2.20 pm, while he was returning to his office after meeting a client, said the officer.

 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim said his department had put up billboards across the city urging people not to talk on cellphones while driving.

 Unfortunately, the warnings are mostly ignored. Even pedestrians talk on cellphones while crossing the road, said Shamim.

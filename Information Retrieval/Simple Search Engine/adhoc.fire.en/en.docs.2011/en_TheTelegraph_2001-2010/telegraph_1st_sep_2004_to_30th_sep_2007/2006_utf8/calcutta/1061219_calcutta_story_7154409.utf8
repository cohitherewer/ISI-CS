 No childs play

 To be presented this evening as part of Nandikars ongoing 23rd National Theatre Festival, is Kahaniya, a collection of four plays for children, based on stories by Munshi Premchand. Performed by children themselves, they highlight the nuances of human emotions through crafted dialogue and persuasive body-play. Frequently adapted for the stage, Bade Bhai Saabs enduring appeal lies in its ability to convey the different shades that lurk beneath familial relationships. Idgah captures the innocent emotions of a parentless child. It is the heart-warming story of four-year-old Hamid who displays a sensibility much beyond his age when he chooses to buy a pair of tongs for his grandmother at the fair instead of toys and sweetmeats like other children. Lottery tells how the mindless desire to procure money the easy way can bring about drastic change in a familys way of living. Also, on the cards is Chori. Direction: Devendra Raj Ankur.

 Event: Plays in Hindi, Bare Bhai Saab, Chori, Idgah and Lottery produced by Sanskaar Rang Toli, Delhi 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts

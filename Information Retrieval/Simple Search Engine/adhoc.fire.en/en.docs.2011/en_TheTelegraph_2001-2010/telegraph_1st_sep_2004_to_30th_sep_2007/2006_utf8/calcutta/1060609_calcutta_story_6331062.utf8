The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Simple, not sexy

Screen On amp; Off

 She has been in the news for all the wrong reasons for quite some time, but Riya Sen wants to bury all that and let her film speak for her. Coming up for release next month is Apna Sapna Money Money, where she plays a lovelorn girl opposite Shreyas ?Iqbal? Talpade. 

 Produced by Subhash Ghai?s Mukta Arts and directed by Sangeeth Sivan, Apna Sapna? is a multi-starrer featuring a host actors ? from Jackie Shroff to Suniel Shetty, Riteish to Anupam Kher. The glam quotient belongs to a brigade of Calcutta girls ? Koena Mitra and Celina Jaitley, apart from Riya.

 Rubbishing reports of a tiff with Celina, Riya said: ?Both of us got along very well while shooting for the film and Celina?s done a great job. She has a negative role in Apna Sapna?. If I have any competition with anyone in this film, it?s her.?

 Shot in Mumbai, the film is a comedy with a labrador called Casper in the midst of the chaos. As everyone chases the money stashed in a suitcase that Casper runs away with, love blooms between Shreyas and Riya.

 ?My character is a simple girl next-door who is dominated by her father (Anupam Kher). She is in love with this guy but her father is strongly against the match. This role goes against my sexy image,? said Riya, in town on Wednesday after a holiday in Thailand with her parents and sister Raima.

 ?I don?t have too many dialogues in this film as our love story is mostly seen through the eyes of others,? added Riya, who now wants to spend more time in her hometown. ?Mumbai is home too. I have an apartment there; my sister lives with me and my parents come over often. But I miss Calcutta very much. I dropped in at the Saturday Club and it was so good to see old friends and faces,? said Moon Moon Sen?s younger daughter.

 20-plus: One of the 

 most important questions amongst Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi 

 Bahu Thi fans across the world has been how Karan (Hiten 

 Tejwani) would look once the Ektaa Kapoor TRP-topper 

 took the 20-year leap. Well, the answer lies in the 

 spectacles-and-stubble look.

 It was one of the sleeper hits earlier this year thanks to the popular touch of Himesh Reshammiya. And now Anant Mahadevan?s Aksar is premiering on the small screen this Sunday. The thriller starring Dino Morea, Udita Goswami and Emraan Hashmi will be shown at 8 pm on STAR Gold.

 There?s loads of trivia attached to the movie. Although the setting of Aksar is shown as London in the film, it was only shot for 12 days there. The rest of the film was shot in Mumbai with British structures in the background. A lot of shots were canned at Bandra?s Taj Lands End suites. Elphinstone Technical School doubled as a port.

 Udita was very wary of doing intimate scenes in the film and even refused to kiss. But who can turn down Emraan Hashmi? When she was made to realise the ?demands of the scene?, she gave in. Dino, on the other hand, was a tad worried that there were no songs for him to sing and Emraan took them all, from Lagi lagi to Soniye to the chartbuster Jhalak dikhla ja.

 After the success of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa and Business Bazigar, Zee is all geared up to launch Shabaash India. A reality show showcasing extraordinary people of the country provides a platform for unsung heroes to come up and ?display their feats of strength, perseverance, courage and pure gut?. With a tagline that claims ?namumkin kuch nahi?, Shabaash India will be hosted by Hussain and goes on air from June 19. 

 Some of the super acts include 44-year-old Mahendra Joshi from Rajasthan pulling a Boeing 737 aeroplane with his hair. There?s Snake Manoharan, 37, from Chennai who can suck in snakes through his nostrils and then bring them out from his mouth. If Kishan Pahelwan, 74, from Bihar allowed 205 kg of stone to be hammered into pieces on his chest, Amaya Pavaskar, 7, from Mumbai glided through the small gap under a car.

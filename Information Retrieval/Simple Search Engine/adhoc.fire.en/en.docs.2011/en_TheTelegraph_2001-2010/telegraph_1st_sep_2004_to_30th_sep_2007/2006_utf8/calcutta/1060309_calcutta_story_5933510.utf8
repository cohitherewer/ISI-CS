The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Oscars up for grabs on roadsides 

 - Viewers snap up pirated DVDs in bylanes long before films hit the halls

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 A still from Brokeback Mountain. Pirated DVDs of the film are flying off the pavements and surreptitious store racks

 From Hollywood?s Kodak Theatre to central Calcutta?s Chandni market, the Oscar buzz has truly spread far and wide.

 The city theatres are taking their own time to warm up to the movies of the season ? if they do so at all, that is ? but the bylanes and living rooms have come alive with the Ang Lee and George Clooney films.

 Even as Jack Nicholson was handing out the coveted Academy Award to writer-director Paul Haggis on Monday morning, DVDs of this year?s Best Film were being sold for Rs 100, everywhere from Free School Street to Kidderpore. Not just Crash, pirated discs of all the main Oscar films, from Brokeback Mountain to Walk the Line, are available with roadside vendors at throwaway prices. 

 Mostly brought in from Malaysia and Bangladesh, these ?very watchable? prints are flying off the pavements and the surreptitious store racks in no time ? faster than a Rang De Basanti or Zinda ? thanks to loyal consumers denied the pleasure of catching these on the big screen. 

 ?Brokeback is hi hafte aaya hai aur do din mein sab copies bik chuka,? said a Free School Street vendor. The original DVDs of the ?hot? movie will only be released in the US in April, and depending on tie-ups with Indian companies, will take another couple of months to hit the stores here.

 Calcuttans can watch the Oscar movies on rented DVDs, though. You can borrow titles like Crash, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Wallace amp; Gromit from video-lending libraries but the pocket pinch is Rs 75 to Rs 100 for just a day or two.

 ?We usually get five to six copies of a new film but the demand is such for films like The Constant Gardener and Walk the Line that we have had to order extra copies of each,? said a spokesperson at Raja Electronics in Beckbagan.

 Then again, such a library membership comes for a steep fee and films like Brokeback Mountain, Munich and Syriana cannot be lent out because the original DVDs haven?t yet been released in the US. With no opportunity to watch these modern-day classics at the theatres or borrowing them for home viewing, cine buffs are going for the pirated products.

 Is the piracy problem more acute in this metro because English films hardly make it to the plexes here? Vikramjit Roy, head, publicity and acquisitions, Sony Pictures India, begs to differ: ?Almost all the Oscar films have released in Mumbai but still most are buying the pirated copies. Despite the presence of strong anti-piracy cells in the metros, piracy is continuing to thrive.?

 Hoping for these movies to release in the theatres before the next Oscars, or waiting for the originals to be available on VCDs and DVDs are the only legitimate options for Calcuttans. 

 ?Piracy will always be there but if one chooses to wait for all these acclaimed films to officially release for home viewing in the country, they will get the best products, legally,? said a senior sales representative of Excel Home Video, which releases many Walt Disney and Miramax titles in India.

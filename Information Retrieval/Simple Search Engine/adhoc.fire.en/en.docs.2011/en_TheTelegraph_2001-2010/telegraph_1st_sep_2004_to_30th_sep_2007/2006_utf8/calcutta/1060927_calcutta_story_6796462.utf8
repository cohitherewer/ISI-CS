 Durga puja by Mominpur Tarun Sangha, in the port area, is much more than an invocation of the Devi. Organised mostly by Muslims, it is also an ardent expression of communal harmony.

 From collecting subscriptions to erecting the pandal and decorating the idols, Muslims youths of the locality are involved in everything related to their para puja.

 Even during the month of Ramazan, they are working round-the-clock for the puja. Its a great sight and people here are very happy, said Arunavo Mukherjee, a local resident and member of the organising committee.

 The man leading the puja pack from the front is Feroz Ahmed Khan, 52, known as Hindu Feroz in the neighbourhood. He has been secretary of the club for the past five years.

 Clad in kurta and skullcap, Feroz is now busy decorating the Durga idol with weapons. Despite being a Brahmin, I do not know how to decorate the idol, and Feroz does it with such aplomb, said Mukherjee, proud of his neighbour. Feroz even offers pushpanjali on Ashtami. We have set an example for others to follow.

 Hasnt he ever faced any resistance from his community members? Initially, some of my friends used to taunt me about my association with a Hindu festival. But now they have all joined me. We are human beings first and then Muslims or Hindus, stressed Feroz.

 The famed communal amity of the locality extends to Id. The park where Durga puja is held is also used for offering Id prayers. 

 Hindus help us clean the park and decorate it with flowers before Id. Members of both communities participate in each others festivals. We are like two families, said Arman Ali, a local Congress leader.

 Though there has been communal disturbance in Mominpur, the Tarun Sangha locality remains unaffected. The two communities have never fought each other, smiled Feroz, going back to decorate his Devi.

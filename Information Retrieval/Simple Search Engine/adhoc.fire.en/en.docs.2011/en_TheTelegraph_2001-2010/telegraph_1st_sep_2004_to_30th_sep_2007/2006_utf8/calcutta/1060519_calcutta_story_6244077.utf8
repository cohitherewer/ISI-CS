 life at stand-still: A queue in front of a polling booth 

 Apropos the report ?Criminals 

 thrive at Kali abode?, April 27, I regularly visit the Kalighat 

 temple, which is similar to most Hindu temples ? dirty, 

 surrounded by sweet shops and overrun by devotees and pandas. 

 The moment you enter the road leading to the temple, pandas surround you promising ?out of turn? darshan for a nominal dakshina. They take you to a sweet shop, where you are compelled to purchase sweets of inferior quality as prasad at a high price. You will also be asked to keep your shoes there for which service they might ask for a fee. 

 You will then be taken to the exit gate of either the garbhagriha or the exterior temple, depending upon the amount you have promised. A payment of Rs 10 to Rs 25 to the panda manning the gate will get you inside. Once the darshan is over, you will be taken outside for the puja. During the puja, you will be asked to make a sankalp. The pandas here try to extract as much money as they can, even resorting to coercion and humiliation. The amount for a sankalp ranges from Rs 51 to Rs 15,000. 

 This sankalp is in addition to the dakshina for the panda. 

 Extortion also goes on in the name of special puja, Shani puja, mangal Puja, Shani Aarti, mangal aarti, balidan and maha balidan. Outside, you are forced to pay Rs 5 to Rs 25 for ?safe custody? of your shoes. 

 Kalighat Temple Committee claims to be the governing body of the temple, but I have never experienced any governance there. 

 S.K. Sahay,

 Tollygunge. 

 Apropos the report ?Under a blazing sun, winding queues with expectant faces?, April 28, the election day in Calcutta passed off in unprecedented peace. But to a Londoner the city appeared to be a part of a war zone. 

 If we, too, can treat election as a routine affair, as is done in London, the tension around the event might subside to a great extent. In India, many people are illiterate or semi-literate. Hence, politicians try to sway them by appealing to their emotions. This contributes to the unrest during elections. 

 If the polls can be held peacefully without deployment of a huge force, the state exchequer would be saved this expenditure. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 It isn?t surprising that the election 

 process in India would inspire awe in a Londoner. We need 

 to overhaul our voting system. Instead of on spot voting, 

 can it be changed to the correspondence system? 

 Chandan Ray,

 Sakuntala Park. 

 Life was literally paralysed in 

 the city on Assembly election day due to the efforts to 

 make the polls fair. But despite the best efforts of the 

 election commission, there were unnecessary delays in the 

 voting process and disappearance of names from the voting 

 list. 

 All this begs the question: has the election commission 

 succeeded in setting a precedent? 

 Arindam Chakrabarty, 

 Garia.

 Apropos the report ?Learning suffers in suffrage sway?, April 27, it is unfortunate that the National Library was taken over by the Election Commission for distribution of electronic voting machines. A seat of learning does not deserve such treatment. With no dearth of open space in the city, why was the National Library occupied by the poll brigade? 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 Kaikhali.

 Apropos the report ?Library venue for ceremonies?, April 28, it is regrettable that a library, nearly a century old, is languishing due to the dearth of funds and is being rented out for functions. The chief minister stresses the importance of books, but his government has failed miserably in preserving such institutions of learning. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala.

 It is sad that a library Netaji 

 Subhas Bose had set foot in needs to be let out for functions 

 for survival. The government must take over the library 

 immediately. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur. 

 Apropos the report ?Library venue 

 for ceremonies?, April 28, it is unfortunate, but not surprising, 

 that a 95-year-old library is being rented out for its survival. 

 The members of libraries are dwindling due to increasing 

 interest in television. All sensible people should promote 

 reading. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Pain relief for cancer patients?, April 24, while ?pain, bleeding and vomiting, breathlessness, neurological complications? are the words used to describe the sordid end of a cancer patient, what the patient himself endures between diagnosis and death can hardly be described in words. Not to mention the feeling of helplessness and fear that shrouds the patient?s family. Under such circumstances psychological complications are bound to occur. Palliative care units are the need of the hour. 

 Avishek Law,

 Bidhan Sarani.

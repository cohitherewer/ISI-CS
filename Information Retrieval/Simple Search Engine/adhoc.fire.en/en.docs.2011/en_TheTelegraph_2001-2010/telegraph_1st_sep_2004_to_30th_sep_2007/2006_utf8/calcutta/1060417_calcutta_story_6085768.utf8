Life

 On a shifting stage

ZEESHAN JAWED

From being a beloved on the local stage, Shayne Hyrapiet 

is fast becoming a favourite for corporate shows in India and abroad. And he sure 

is not complaining.

 Last year saw Shayne going on a four-month-long whirlwind tour of Switzerland, playing for tourists from all over the world. This year too, SOTC (the company that signed him on last) is taking him on a five-month tour of Switzerland. I am quite excited about the upcoming tour. I represented my country last year and my work was appreciated by the people. I travelled to different cities and sang for people who had only a faint idea about India and its culture. I hope this time too I live up to my reputation of being a popular Indi-pop singer, says Shayne.

 The singer from Chandni Chowk is also being kept busy by a string of corporate and private shows. The major shows that I did in the past one year were for Hope Foundation and Jet Airways. In December I did more than 20 shows in 30 days. I was travelling almost every day. It was hectic but very satisfying, smiles Shayne.

 The young Armenian is also planning to produce a Christmas carol album at the end of the year, to be circulated among schools, colleges, churches and members of the Christian community.

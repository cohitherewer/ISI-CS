 SMS aid for Puja car crawl

 PRONAB MONDAL

 An SMS is all youll need to get out of traffic snarls this Puja. At least, thats what the cops are promising.

 A few days before the Puja, we will announce numbers to which people can send SMSs mentioning the location of traffic snarls. Computers in the traffic control room will store the messages, said joint commissioner of police (traffic department) Ranvir Kumar.

 Once an SMS is received, officers at the control room will alert the traffic guard concerned. And the guard will instruct the sergeants and traffic constables on how to deal with the snarl, explained an officer of the wing.

 According to Kumar, police will reply to the SMS. Once we find out about the problem, we will send an SMS to the complainant, explaining the cause of the traffic snarl and the approximate time required to sort it out. If we manage to clear the snarl, we will also inform the complainant that the problem has been fixed. 

 The joint commissioner added: We have already spoken to cellphone service providers Hutch and Airtel. However, the deal is yet to be finalised. Once thats done, we will announce the numbers for sending an SMS. 

 Another officer of the traffic department said there were heavy traffic snarls on certain stretches, like the western flank of the Gariahat flyover, the Rashbehari connector and Ultadanga Main Road. In some cases, the snarls persisted for more than 30 minutes because we came to know of them a little late, he stated.

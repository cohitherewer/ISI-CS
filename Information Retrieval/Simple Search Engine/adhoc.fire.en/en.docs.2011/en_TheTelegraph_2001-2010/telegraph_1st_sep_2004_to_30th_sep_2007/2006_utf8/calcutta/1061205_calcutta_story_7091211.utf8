 Pain of alienation

 Perhaps the most controversial and misunderstood writer of his time, Saadat Hasan Manto finally earned recognition nearly 50 years after his death, with his short stories being translated and simultaneously dramatised in several Indian languages. Conceived in the form of a collage, Sarhad Paar Manto focuses on his better-known stories on Partition, at the same time, offering a comprehensive study of the humanism that the author represented. It comprises Khol Do and Toba Tek Singh, stories born out of the pain that Manto carried with him in his own experience of exile. In both stories, Sirajuddin (in Khol Do) and Bishan Singh (in Toba Tek Singh) feel the shock of Partition as a terrible wrench. Through the loss of sanity of both characters, Manto seems to suggest that madness alone can bring a sufferer to terms with the horror of a country torn apart by communal politics. The two short plays are woven together with ironic snippets written by Manto and narrated by Usha Ganguli, who also directs.

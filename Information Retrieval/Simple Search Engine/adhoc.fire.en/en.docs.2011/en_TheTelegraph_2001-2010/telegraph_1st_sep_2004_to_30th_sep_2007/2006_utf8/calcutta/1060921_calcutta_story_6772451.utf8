The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Friends held for murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Saurav Roy and Kamal Sarkar, both in their mid-20s, were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday for allegedly murdering MBA student Joyjit Mukherjee. The body was found beside the railway tracks near Dunlop on August 17.

 Saurav is a student of the college in Baranagar where Joyjit used to study. Kamal passed out from the institute a couple of years ago. They were produced in court and remanded in police custody.

 Joyjit was last seen alive with Saurav and Kamal, said inspector general (II) of CID D.P. Tarania. They have not confessed to the crime yet. We have enough reason to suspect that they were involved in the killing. We have arrested them on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

 The Government Railway Police had initially taken up the case and come to the conclusion that the student had committed suicide. Medical examination of the body, however, revealed that the injuries hinted at homicide. The CID investigators later confirmed that Joyjit was murdered somewhere else before the body was dumped beside the railway tracks.

 The post-mortem revealed haemorrhage in Joyjits intestine. We have found some people who saw Saurav and Kamal beating up Joyjit on the evening he was killed. It appears that the haemorrhage was caused by the assault, explained Tarania.

 The inspector general stated that there were also bruises on the left side of Joyjits face and a wound on the back of his head. He was probably beaten up with an iron rod. We are now trying to find out whether the beating by the duo resulted in his death.

 A CID officer elaborated on why the investigators had started to suspect the duo: They met Joyjit in front of Sonali cinema in the afternoon when he was with his girlfriend. Saurav and Kamal were also the last people seen with Joyjit before his death.

 The probe has revealed that there was a dispute between Joyjit and laboratory assistant of his college Ramesh Balmiki over a bicycle.Joyjit had borrowed bicycles from others, too, and he was involved in scuffles with his friends over the issue, said an officer.

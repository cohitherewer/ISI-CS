 You have always claimed to 

 be the biggest film buff around?

 I still am a huge movie buff. I genuinely feel there is no life without cinema. The thing with me is that I don?t just watch films, I like talking about them, dreaming about them. Even when I am dreaming about beautiful naked big-ass women, my dream suddenly shifts to when I will be able to watch Mission Impossible 3 or Poseidon Adventure. I call myself a purist, who can give up all his relationships for his love for cinema.

 So was there this burning desire 

 to make movies yourself?

 See, I never assisted any director. Nor did I pass out from any institute. All I have done is watch movies all my life. And I started watching movies from the time there was no VHS, no DVDs, no laser discs. But yes, I kept upgrading myself, always finding newer ways to watch movies.

 Then I have always directed my own TV shows, although the credit has gone to other people. Those were all my lines and spoken my way, so it was me directing the episodes, unless there was a gag or something.

 I had directed plays and fashion shows in college. So you can say film direction was a natural progression, but the way it happened was completely out of chance.

 And how exactly did it happen?

 Ramu (Ram Gopal Varma) called me to his office to cast me in the sequel to Darna Mana Hai. While chatting I told him how the first film didn?t scare me at all. So he asked me what kind of stories scare me. I narrated a story I had heard in school when I was a kid. And Ramu completely freaked out and asked me, ?Why don?t you direct the story yourself?? He didn?t ask me about my background or my technical knowledge. He also never interfered in the creative process. Only Ramu could have done something like this. He literally put his money where his mouth was.

 So what is the horror story 

 of Darna Zaroori Hai?

 It?s about this guy who doesn?t get scared by the standard horror TV shows and films. He is a 40-year-old man who still lives with his mother. He is getting ready to go and watch Darna Mana Hai. His mother tells him not to take the shortcut to the cinema hall since the graveyard falls on the way and it is the night of amavas. He doesn?t listen to her, takes the shortcut, even gets angry and upset with the graves and literally pisses on them. He goes on to watch the movie, hates it and comes back the same way. This return trip is the longest journey he has ever taken in his life.

 That means Ramu accepts the 

 fact that Darna Mana Hai wasn?t scary enough?

 Of course he does. That?s the best thing about Ramu, he can accept his mistakes honestly. Just like I do. I think that?s what brings the two of us together.

 When you had the whole of Bollywood 

 in hand, why did you cast the little known Manoj Pahwa as 

 your protagonist?

 I had worked on a TV show with Manoj. He is this hugely fat guy but very nimble on his feet. I am convinced that no other actor could have given the expressions that he has given in the movie. Even I, who know the character inside out, could not have been able to do that. Once you see it, you will realise what I mean. His expressions will scare the daylights out of you. My story is the first of the seven stories you will see in Darna Zaroori Hai. It comes even before the titles.

 After this 15-minute trial, 

 you are on to a big Bollywood blockbuster in Hey Baby?

 I think Sajid Nadiadwala is taking a bigger risk than Ramu by putting Rs 25 crore on my vision. But then he knows me. He is well aware what I will bring to the table. I am someone who has never been carried away by emotions. Success has never gone to my head, I have never been saddened by failure. All that matters to me is the third person, which is the audience. I shouldn?t fail them.

 You have got a huge cast 

 for Hey Baby?

 I have Akshay Kumar, Fardeen Khan, Riteish and Vidya Balan. They are all there because they are gifted artistes who suit the roles. It is a comedy laced with a lot of drama and family emotions. I am sure Hey Baby will have one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. I have been a DJ for seven years, I know my music. We plan to launch the film on August 7 since it will be 7.8.6, which is a very auspicious day for me.

 Would you give up your Bollywood 

 shows on TV now that you are turning a director yourself, 

 like Kunal Kohli?

 There?s a difference between Kunal and me. Kunal was trying to be Barry Norman. I am a stand-up comedian. Of course I have the box-office facts and figures. I will never give up my anchoring job. That?s my day job. That?s what I am. Also, I am in my mid-30s now, my criticism has become witticism.

 But don?t you fear others tearing 

 your films apart like you did with theirs?

 Whether I make the world?s greatest film or the world?s worst film, I don?t give a f*** what they say about my movie. They don?t know jackshit about films. I just want to make sure that I can hold my head high after I show my film to the world. We are moving towards an era where in 10 years films will release at homes in digital format. At that time, I shouldn?t cringe.

 What happens when you win the 

 Best Director award at a show you are hosting?

 (Laughs uproariously) Tere muh mein ghee shakkar? Then also people will say he must have done the show for free. These days, awards are nothing more than pure TV entertainment. That?s why one crops up every fortnight. I am telling you, soon a time will come when nominees will have to be paid for their names to be used.

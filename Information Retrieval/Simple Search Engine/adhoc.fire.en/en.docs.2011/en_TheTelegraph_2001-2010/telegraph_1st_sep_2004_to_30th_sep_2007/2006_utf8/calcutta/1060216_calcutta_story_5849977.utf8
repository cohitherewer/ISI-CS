The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Delhi pads up for prod

 - Frown raised on eve of tabling wetlands bill in Assembly

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Union ministry of environment and forests on Wednesday decided to seek an explanation from the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government over its bid to designate some areas within the East Calcutta Wetlands as ?settlements?.

 The development in Delhi comes on the eve of the East Calcutta Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Bill, 2006, being tabled in the state Assembly on Thursday by the environment department.

 ?We have received a complaint from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), India, regarding the state government?s attempt to change the character of the East Calcutta Wetlands. We will write to the Bengal chief secretary, asking for a status report immediately,? said Siddharth Kaul, director of wetland programme in the Union ministry of environment and forests, over phone.

 This follows a petition by the WWF?s Bengal wing to the Union ministry on Tuesday, accompanied by clippings of the reports carried by Metro.

 Alerting Delhi about the state environment department?s bid to re-designate some areas in the wetlands to allow real estate development, the WWF had requested ?immediate action? be taken.

 ?Normally, the state government cannot do such a thing. We had forwarded the data sheet of the site to the Ramsar Bureau when it was designated as a Ramsar site. No changes can be made in that data sheet without the knowledge of the Ramsar convention,? stressed Kaul.

 Parikshit Goutam, director of WWF?s fresh water and wetlands programme, expressed satisfaction at the day?s development. 

 ?We have been assured by the ministry that action will be initiated,? he said.

 On Thursday morning, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah will take up the matter one more time with CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.

 Mollah has refused to discuss the matter with environment minister Manabendra Mukherjee, whose department seems intent on pushing the Bill in the Assembly that will allow the change of land character of the wetlands.

 ?I don?t know of any controversy on the matter and the bill will be tabled in the Assembly as scheduled,? Mukherjee told Metro on Wednesday.

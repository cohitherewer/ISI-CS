 Be fashionable but not a fashion victim ? international hairstylist Michael Beel believes in this mantra to the core when it comes to tress styling.

 The Asia Pacific educator for hair care major Wella and the creative director of Buoy, one of the more popular salons in Wellington, New Zealand, Michael was in town last week for a trend and technique session with the salon staff and clients at June Tomkyns.

 While sharing valuable facts and tips with the salon personnel, Michael was also packed up with women queuing up at the Ballygunge Circular Road parlour for the magical snip by the stylist who boasts the 2002 New Zealand Hairdresser of the Year title.

 The wonders a haircut can do for someone on his bad day appealed to Michael and inspired him to take up the profession.

 I was a student of psychology and once during a haircut session the hairdresser offered me a job. While learning to style, sweep and make tea at the salon, I realised that I wanted to take up hairstyling as a full-time career, he recounted.

 A bit of initial resistance from a family where children are allowed to speak their mind was not difficult to overcome.

 An apprenticeship hairdressing course with Otago Polytechnic was followed by a job with Buoy, where he has continued working for the past seven years. 

 In between, there has been a fair amount of trotting all over New Zealand and Australia to finetune and upscale the cut and style processes of hair dressers.

 Michaels contractual job with Wella has taken him places. The runners-up in the Young Visionary category at the Wella Trend Vision Awards in 2003 described his style as interpreting fashion the right way... one that celebrates the essence of womanhood. 

 He stressesd that a cut should be soft, feminine, fashionable and easily manageable.

 Building a rapport with the client is a must. It is important to know her likes and dislikes and her hair intricacies, said the 29-year-old.

 For the moment, the Sixties look is back in hair fashion, revealed Michael. Bobs, sexy waves and the pixie cut are the ones to watch out for.

 The man who has styled Hollywood actors Ian Mckellen (Gandalf) and Bernard Hill (King Theoden of Rohan) in Lord Of The Rings, idolises hair stylists Derek Elvy, Robert Lobetta, Antoinette Beenders and Richard Thompson.

 His clientele in New Zealand includes the whos who, from the deputy mayor to the high commissioners. But Michael dreams of styling the tresses of Madonna and Kylie Minogue. While he chooses the short, choppy, textured look topped with honey and golden blonde for Madonna, it would be the cute Sixties pixie cut for Kylie.

 Theres one thing apart from hairstyling that Michael is passionate about ? grooving to great music on the dance floor.

 When on the dance floor, it is a bit of me, a bit of Elvis Presley and a bit of Beyonce Knowles thrown in, he laughed.

 Talking about hairstyles in the city, Michael felt cuts and styles here were not personalised enough.

 Hairdressers need to be a bit more innovative and people should be ready to experiment, he advised. 

 There is a lot of long hair around and in some cases they are not well maintained, he added.

 The hair scene here might have failed to impress Michael, but he fell in love with the culinary delights, particularly the fish and chicken kebabs, on his first trip to Calcutta.

 Visits to the Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral and a ride on the Howrah bridge were most enjoyable. 

 For most of us abroad, for whom Calcutta is a city of poverty, visits like these are real eye-openers. The city is one place where the extremes have been balanced so well. There is a surprise around every corner and I loved each of them. This is surely the first of my many visits to Calcutta, signed off the snip artiste.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Catch it!

 The cricket coaching craze that is. From the Lakes to Salt Lake, here?s padding up for a pitch report from the star six

 Sourav Ganguly was denied a place in Team India at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Saturday morning. But there was no denying thousands of budding cricketers their place in the nets, from the Lakes to Salt Lake, this January morning. Some out to just stay fit and be with it, others pursuing the dream of being our next Sourav, and a precious few with the burning ambition to make it to the big league.

 When Sourav ? and elder brother Snehasish ? had first taken stance at the Dukhiram Coaching Centre more than two decades ago, no one could have foreseen the future. Brothers Ganguly inspired a cricket revolution on the pitch and off it, with the younger one going on to become the most successful Indian skipper in history. And now, the brothers have lent their weight behind the best-equipped cricket camp in Calcutta.

 ?There used to be just one matting wicket for the nets at the Aryan club,? recounts Snehasish. ?Compared to what kids have today, we had no facilities then, but we fought it out.?

 The oldest cricket cradle for Bengal, the Kartik Bose camp on a plot adjoining his Amherst Street house, was as rudimentary. But the passion for the game was no less.

 Now, if thousands of youngsters across the state want to be like Sourav, they also have the basic tools to help them pursue that dream ? parents who pamper their ?cricketer? sons, proper pitches rather than gully cricket, coaching clinics with full gear and add-on facilities, stars as guest coaches, a Sourav-struck chief minister all too eager to give cricket a boost...

 On any given Saturday, the 300-odd coaching camps in the state are a sea of white as aspiring cricketers go through the grind. ?The Sourav factor is enormous and the rush started ever since he made his mark in 1996,? says former Bengal cricketer Gopal Bose. The East Zone representative of the National Coaching Academy warns that the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) must improve infrastructure to turn attraction into ability.

 There is no playing down the Sourav effect. ?Though India?s World Cup win in 1983 was the first trigger and Bengal?s Ranji Trophy triumph in 1990 had some impact, it was Sourav?s emergence that opened the floodgates. Being the most successful Indian captain must be the icing on the cake,? observes former Bengal cricketer and national selector Sambaran Banerjee.

 But is the crowd crush at coaching camps being borne out by their contribution to Bengal and Indian cricket? Is quality playing second fiddle to the craze? ?Our survey shows that close to 25 per cent of the camps in the state do not have adequate infrastructure and we have actually rejected their application for participating in our sub-junior tournaments (95 Points and 110 Points),? reveals CAB secretary Saradindu Pal.

 With the game in flannels now a fashion, with Sourav still Bengal?s Hero No. 1, and coaching camps now a way of life, we take stock of the six most high-profile cricket cradles in town.

 The base, powder, shimmer and 

 shine are no longer just for the face. They are travelling 

 southwards to add that much-needed sparkle to your skin. 

 After all, whats a perfectly made-up face without 

 a body to match? Enter body make-up for that smooth and 

 satiny feel all over.

 Make-up expert Cory Walia explains 

 that there are three kinds of body make-up. The first and 

 the most essential is make-up that involves bringing all 

 the exposed areas of the body to one tone. The second involves 

 highlighting and contouring. Tattoos form the third and 

 final form of body make-up.

 GoodLife fills in the body 

 blanks.

 Tone trick

 Says make-up expert Aniruddha 

 Chakladar: On most occasions, it is tough to paint 

 all the exposed areas to match the face. The best option 

 is to reach an artificial parity by creating a new skin 

 tone altogether. So bring down the face tone, while lifting 

 the body tone.

 Dabbing the greasepaint all over, 

 cumbersome as it may be, is sometimes inevitable. Here, 

 it is important to choose the same medium as the face to 

 co-ordinate texture and shade.

 Before you begin application, 

 smooth over some moisturiser. Dot the foundation and then 

 blend with a sponge or fingers, says Aniruddha. It 

 is also advisable to choose a pan-stick or pancake rather 

 than a messy liquid foundation. Dust some compact 

 to finish, adds Aniruddha.

 If the arms are considerably darker 

 than the face and you are hard-pressed for time to indulge 

 in all-over body make-up, then Cory has a trick: Apply 

 base and colours on your face as you would have normally, 

 but leave a natural tone on the edges around the face.

 While a face requires minute application, 

 the body demands generosity. Birthmarks and scars 

 need heavier concealers or pan-sticks, says Aniruddha.

 The same goes for a bare back 

 in less-than-perfect condition. It may be tough to slap 

 make-up on a zone that you can hardly reach, but imagine 

 a back that peeps out five shades darker than your face!

 Play up

 Body make-up is also about playing 

 up your assets with a subtle touch. Aniruddha says that 

 it is necessary to apply a base coat on the body before 

 donning the shimmer and shine. Moisturise your body if the 

 skin is even-toned or else dab some foundation to bring 

 it in order.

 The application after that is 

 relatively simple, thanks to some easy-to-glide products 

 available on the make-up racks. Try Skinlights from Revlon, 

 Shadow Dust, a roll-on by Lakme, shimmer by Oriflame and 

 Aviance.

 If the shimmer is powder, just 

 brush some on the collarbones, shoulders, centre of the 

 arms and cleavage ? wherever you want to make those roaming 

 eyes rest.

 Body make-up can help highlight 

 the cleavage beautifully. Highlight the centre of 

 the cleavage in a shimmering hue and shade the edges of 

 your bust with a darker colour or a bronzer. This gives 

 the perfect depth, explains Aniruddha.

 An overall sexy glow is 

 easy to attain with a shimmer lotion. Just add some shimmer 

 powder to your daily moisturiser and create your own shiny 

 lotion, says Cory.

 Heres another style advice 

 from Cory: If your outfit is dotted with Swarovski crystals 

 and silver work, then use silver shimmer. A gold or bronze 

 shimmer is for traditional zardosi and aari 

 work. Also co-ordinate the shimmer shade with the jewellery 

 tones.

 But be very careful with 

 glitter. A dash on the shoulders is more than enough, 

 adds Cory. 

 Tattoo trend

 This popular form of body make-up 

 has a way of being in the news. If it is not a question 

 of what (say, controversial religious pattern), then its 

 all about where (say, the cleavage or the base of the spinal 

 chord to be shown off with dangerously-low denims).

 Sample a few current star tattoos: 

 Nina Manuels guardian angel perched on her left shoulder, 

 Raveena Tandons scorpion crawling up her collarbone, 

 the large red scorpion on Sanjay Dutts biceps.

 From riding a celebrity wave, 

 tattoos back home are finally gaining mileage with the party 

 people. Used to highlight and adorn various body zones, 

 the latest trend in tattoos is colourful, larger than life 

 motifs. Patterns? Take your pick from floral to football. 

 Pocket pinch? Rs 500 onwards at 

 most salons, as per the size and the degree of artistic 

 skill needed.

 acement tips: The upper arms and 

 the neck have been favourites for tattoos. The other popular 

 zones are the navel area, the neck-to-cleavage stretch, 

 the ankles, the shoulders and the base of the spinal chord.

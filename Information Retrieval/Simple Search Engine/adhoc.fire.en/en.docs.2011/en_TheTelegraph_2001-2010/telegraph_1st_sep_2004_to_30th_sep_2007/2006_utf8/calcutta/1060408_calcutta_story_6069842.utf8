 What: 

 Inauguration of a new outlet of Dominos Pizza by actor 

 Jeet.

 Where: P-108/2, Block C, Bangur Avenue (near Bank of India).

 When: April 6, afternoon.

 The outlet: Spread over an area of 850 sq ft, the outlet has a seating capacity of 25. 

 The seventh outlet of the chain in the city will deliver its pizzas to homes in Lake Town, Bangur, Dum Dum Park, Kalindi, Nagerbazar and Krishnapur.

 The spread: The menu card boasts Dominos vegetarian and non-vegetarian favourites. 

 The vegetarian spread includes Simply Veg, Veg I and Veg II, while the non-vegetarian fare comprises Simply Non-Veg, Non-Veg I and Non-Veg II. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices range between Rs 50 for a small-sized pizza and Rs 310 for a large non-vegetarian pizza.

 Voiceover: The city is growing at a phenomenal rate and there could not have been a better time for the launch of a new outlet. This part of the city is virgin when it comes to such eateries. I am sure people will welcome this and continue to show their support for us as always, said Ajay Kaul, CEO, Dominos Pizza India Limited.

 On the move

 What: Launch of GetSetGo, an Indian restaurant.

 When: April 6 afternoon.

 Where: Lee Residency, ground floor, 26, Lee Road.

 Take a look: With red, yellow and green as the GetSetGo theme colours, the ambience of this relaxed restaurant is bright and happy. 

 The furniture is easy and the wooden detailing on the ceiling is definitely an eye-catcher. 

 The counters are self-service and the promised time to ready your meal is five minutes and maybe a few extra for a Tandoori platter.

 The menu: The speciality of this eatery is a range of pre-plated meals. 

 Try either the Awadhi Set Meal, Bengali Bhoj, Tandoori Platters or the Veg Thali (cooked without onion and garlic). 

 They also serve a regular a la carte. Indian faves like Paneer Tikka, Chicken Tikka, Dal Makhni and Kasha Mangsho find a place on the menu. 

 Also available is a range of teatime snacks like Fish Finger, Sandwich, Pakoda and Biryani.

 Pocket pinch: The set meals begin at Rs 79 and go up to Rs 109. The teatime snacks come for anything between Rs 35 and Rs 79.

 Voiceover: The Elgin Road-Lee Road stretch is a great location for a fast food Indian eatery such as this. In the pipeline are more GetSetGo outlets in busier areas like Salt Lake and some north Calcutta spots like Shyambazar, revealed Swetha Ishaque, one of the directors of the restaurant.

 Fabric focus

 What: Sona Chandi, an exhibition by Rehwa Society.

 Where: Saturday Club, Small Phoenix Room.

 When: Till April 9, from 11 am to 8 pm.

 Take a look: On offer will be a wide variety of dress materials, dupattas, stoles and saris in Maheshwari fabric. Blends of silk and cotton in different proportions make this rich fabric suitable for the summer months. 

 There are prints, stripes, solids as well as ones worked with zari. 

 A touch of gold and sparkle of silver make them look dressy yet elegant. A special selection of Bagh prints on Maheshwari weaves also finds place here. 

 Organised by Rehwa Society, proceeds from the sale will be used for healthcare, education and welfare of the women weavers and their children.

 Pocket pinch: The saris start from Rs 1,000 and the dress material range from Rs 1,100. Dupattas and stoles come for anything above Rs 500.

 Voiceover: These fabrics look very rich and dressy because of the silk blend, and hence are ideal for evening and party wear in summer. They dont make you feel warm at all and, in fact, are good picks for a summer trousseau, says Ila Prakash Singh, eastern region representative of Rehwa Society.

 Night fashion

 What: Midnight Fashion Show by designer Agnimitra Paul.

 Where: Underground, the nightclub at Hotel Hindusthan International.

 When: April 5. 

 Fashion frenzy: Agnimitra presented two collections as the clock struck midnight. The first sequence saw party-wear saris in vibrant hues. The hatke factor shot up due to unusual placement of the embroidery and unique dyeing. 

 Resham, sequins and maal ka kaam merged with cool block prints to create a range of stylish saris.

 The second sequence showcased funky skirts in chiffons and muls. These were all double layered and cut differently. Teamed with silk bustiers to focus all the attention on the skirts, the ensembles were then accessorised with jazzy belts.

 Ramp rockers: Pooja, Ishika, Tina, Jessica, Indrani and Tanushree strutted the stuff on the bar tops. The sequences were choreographed by Riya Mitra.

 Celebspotting: Actress Koneenica, actors Indrajit and Jisshu Sengupta.

 Voiceover: The fashion show was not a mere crowd-pulling gimmick; it was about serious fashion exclusively for our members and guests, said Amit Hathiramani from HHI.

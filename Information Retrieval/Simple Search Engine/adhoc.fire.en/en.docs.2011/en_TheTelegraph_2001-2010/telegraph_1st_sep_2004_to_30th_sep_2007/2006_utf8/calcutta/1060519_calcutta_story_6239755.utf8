Naresh Verma, director of Red Carpet Events, introduced the three categories in which the hunt will be conducted.

 After preliminary rounds in Calcutta and Siliguri, 250 contestants will be shortlisted for the semi-finals, to be held in the third week of July.

 The finalists will then be groomed by experts from Artisan, a grooming school.

 The finals in August will select 42 winners ? three male and three female singers, six male and six female models, 12 male and 12 female dancers.

 The winners will bag a contract from B.N. Verma Productions of Mumbai for a music album.

 The 42 aspirants will go through a one-month session of professional grooming before heading for Mumbai.

 Voiceover: An event like this befits this part of the country, since over the years it has produced so much talent in various creative fields, said Naresh.

 Junk jazz 

 What: Launch of Ek Poyshar Goyna on the occasion of the fourth anniversary celebrations of Gold Factory.

 Where: Gold Factory showroom at 171/C, Rashbehari Avenue.

 When: Wednesday. 

 The collection: Developed by the in-house research and development team of Gold Factory, the unique jewellery range has been designed by Brinda Ganguly Sirkar. Trendy in appeal, the aesthetically blended contemporary and traditional designs come alive in the form of old copper coins combined with gold.

 The collection boasts of small earrings, chandeliers and pendants with small motifs on them, making the entire range very wearable.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 2,000.

 Voiceover: The collection 

 has been designed keeping in mind the tastes and preferences 

 of todays women. Far from the elaborate gold ornaments, 

 these pieces with their junk appeal are right for regular 

 use. The wide range caters to all pockets, smiled 

 Brinda.

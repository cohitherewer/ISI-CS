 Mandarin surveys rally bruises

 - Biswas wrangles army clean chit for Brigade spruce-up after inspection

 A STAFF REPORTER

 For the first time in the history of the ruling CPM in Bengal, a party secretary kept a tryst with trinamul (grassroot) of a different kind, when Anil Biswas stepped on to the greens on Thursday to inspect how much the Maidan had been mauled by the party?s January 8 rally.

 The state CPM secretary spent nearly an hour on Brigade Parade Grounds with lieutenant-colonel Amitabha Chowdhury of Headquarter Bengal Area and other army officers, inspecting the aftermath of the Sunday rally and the effects of the clean-up drive carried out by party cadre.

 ?The rally was called by our party. So, it is our duty to ensure that the Maidan is cleaned properly. The army is quite happy with the effort that has been put in by our cadre after the rally was over. Only a couple of spots need some attention, which will be cleared by this evening,? said Biswas, at the end of the joint inspection tour on foot.

 ?I, too, am in favour of preserving the greens... From today, whenever a rally is organised at Brigade, the head of the political party concerned should inspect the Maidan jointly with the army,? said the plunderer-turned-protector of the city?s most precious patch of green.

 Lieutenant-colonel Chowdhury all but gave Biswas?s brigade a clean chit. ?We are quite happy with the initiative put in by the CPM cadre. The Maidan has been restored to its original self, barring two to three spots,? he said.

 The remains of the rally day, according to the joint inspection team, were a few burnt patches in one corner and some abandoned plastic packets. Biswas claimed his people were ?probably not responsible? for the singed stretch, but promised to address the problem.

 The state CPM secretary also assured the army that the holes ? dug into the Maidan by bamboo poles ? would not merely be covered by sand, but filled with mud.

 Metro had, over the past few days, focused on how the scars left by Sunday?s rally ? the holes and the burns ? would take a full monsoon to heal.

 It was around 11 am that Biswas received a call from Fort William. ?Chowdhury and another officer offered to conduct a joint inspection of the Maidan, and I readily agreed,? he said.

 But Biswas brushed aside talk of political rallies being shifted out of the Maidan in order to preserve the greens. ?One or two rallies a year do not pollute the environment. Holes dug for playing golf also constitute damage to the Maidan. I did, however, ask the army to cordon off the entire field after the clean-up, so that nobody can damage it. But the army said they could not do so as the Maidan, after all, is public property,? said Biswas.

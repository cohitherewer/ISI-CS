The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Koyaler Bagan

 Imagine this: a monsoon afternoon in the woods. Except for the sound of your footsteps and the twittering of birds, everything is as still as can be. Suddenly, there is a movement in the bush in front of you. The first look reveals nothing. But when you look carefully, you see it: a small untidy pouch hanging from a twig. And two tiny chicks peering out of it. The mother, a flash of brown, yellow and purple, hovers in front, trying to feed the birds with her sword-like beak.

 No, this is not a scene from a documentary on your favourite television channel. The drama of the mother Purple-rumped Sunbird feeding her chicks is being played out in front of you. Before you start thinking of faraway jungles, such scenes actually unfold every day in the city?s very own bird sanctuary. 

 For those not in the know, Calcutta has a wildlife sanctuary near Narendrapur, on the city?s southern fringes. A 17-acre orchard better known as Koyaler Bagan has been transformed into Chintamoni Kar Bird Sanctuary. Much of the credit for that goes to nature and wildlife enthusiasts who organised movements to get the woods this status.

 The Chintamoni Kar bird sanctuary is well-connected by road. Autorickshaws are available from Garia bus stand. Driving down is another option. A Rs 15 entry fee is charged per visitor and the sanctuary is open from dawn to dusk.

 For Calcuttans harbouring the notion that the only birds in the crowded city are the common crows and the house sparrows, a day trip to the sanctuary will open up the world of barbets, bulbuls and parakeets.

 The thick canopy of trees and dense undergrowth is also home to other forms of wildlife such as mongoose, monitor lizard and jackal.

 Apart from sharp eyes, you will 

 need a pair of binoculars for glimpses into the lives of 

 birds. While amateur ornithologists and photographers can 

 spend hours at the sanctuary, those with an interest in 

 butterflies will not be disappointed either. Varied species 

 of butterflies and dragonflies have found shelter here.

 The forest department has grand plans for the sanctuary. The resting places for visitors, with bamboo benches and thatched roofs, blend in with the surroundings. The nature trails are well-maintained.

 Even those without an interest in birds and butterflies will enjoy visiting Koyaler Bagan. The vegetation, large ponds and the serenity make for an enchanting escape from the noisy, smoke-spewing city.

 A word of caution though. This is not a picnic spot. Smoking, music, loud conversation and anything else that might disturb the birds should be avoided.

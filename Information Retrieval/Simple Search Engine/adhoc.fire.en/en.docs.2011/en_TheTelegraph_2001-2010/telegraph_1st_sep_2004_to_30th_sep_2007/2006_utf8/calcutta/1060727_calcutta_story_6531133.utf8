 Ankur Khanna with Ayesha Takia in Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota

 The Modern High School and Loreto House alumni still miss him. They can?t stop talking about how he used to stop over at a Loudon Street ice-cream parlour every evening. And they can?t stop envying the girls who had the ?honour? of going out on a date with him. So, the first week rush for Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota in Calcutta was not only because it was a Naseeruddin Shah movie but also because it happened to feature a certain Ankur Khanna.

 Ankur, born and brought up in Calcutta, was quite a campus star from St James School thanks to his debating and dramatics skills. ?Yeah, I used to do a little bit of theatre in school,? is the modest admission from the 27-year-old. ?Badal Sircar?s son Abhijit used to be a teacher in our school and he used to direct all the school plays. I think we won 12 out of the 17 inter-school one-act play competitions organised by the British Council. I was in a couple of them.?

 The Calcutta chapter folded up once Ankur went to St Stephen?s, New Delhi, to study English literature. A Master?s in mass communication from MCRC Jamia Milia Islamia meant that the Southern Avenue boy stayed put in the capital.

 ?I kept doing plays while in college ? both in English and Bengali,? recalls Ankur.

 But Naseeruddin Shah did not pick him up from stage. In fact, the two didn?t know each other. When Ankur walked into a Mumbai office to audition for Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota, he was just another ?aspiring actor?. ?I was asked to read out a scene from the film,? he says. ?Naseer spoke to me a little bit and then called a couple of days later asking me whether I would be interested in doing the role. Of course, I was! But he never told me what he liked about me.?

 A series of workshops and rehearsals followed. ?Naseer?s workshops are very famous; he even conducted one for the Monsoon Wedding cast,? reveals Ankur who shifted to Mumbai before shooting began. ?You really learn a lot of things there, from improvisation to interaction. Also, all the actors got to know each other well and things became very easy.?

 In the film, Ankur plays a medical student named Rahul, who has got through to UCLA but is reluctant to go abroad for a reason that is revealed later. Friend Ayesha Takia helps him through his problems and Ankur does finally board the flight. ?A lot of my character changed as we shot,? he says. ?It was a much longer film and my episode was more detailed. It seems a bit rushed now... I had very sparse dialogues in the film and had to play out a lot through silence. I am not the brooding kind in real life.?

 Ankur does rate his director very high. ?Naseer is excellent with actors,? he gushes. ?He is very good in coaxing actors to do what he wants. And he doesn?t have one fixed strategy. He moulds himself according to every actor and finally gets out the desired results. After all, he has all these years of experience to fall back on.?

 Even as he soaks up the feedback ? ?mostly positive, some mixed? ? Ankur is on the lookout for meaningful scripts which, he admits, are hard to find. ?I have shot for a film called Postcards with Soha Ali Khan and I am doing another film called Kabootar about four friends lured into crime in Rajasthan. I also plan to do some theatre in Mumbai with Motley, Naseer?s theatre group.?

 When its jute... just bag it

 Times were when a bag served a strictly utilitarian purpose, as something to carry documents, money and other odds and ends comfortably. If it looked good, it was an added advantage.

 But that was before the accessories boom that made bags an important part of a womans complete look and designers put themselves on the job. Hand-crafted leather, embellished batuas and embroidered clutches theres no limit to the range today when it comes to bags.

 One material that has benefited from this boom is jute. Durable, stylish and cheap, jute bags in bright prints and embellishments are a rage with the hip and fashionable today.

 The demand for jute bags has gone up by 35 to 40 per cent in the past one year. While it is very popular with the younger generation (college-goers going for bright prints or embellishments), the sober hues have found favour with older women. Carrying jute bags is a huge fashion statement today, says Sunil Joshi, sales executive at the Park Street showroom of Ballyfabs. 

 S.S. Mukherjee of Sonali, a government of India undertaking to promote jute items, agrees: People usually associated the fabric with boring gunny bags. That perception is changing. Jute bags have emerged as the height of fashion. Designs and shapes earlier found only in leather are now being made in jute. 

 While Joshi feels the preoccupation with using eco-friendly material has worked in favour of jute, Mukherjee says: That apart, there is a preference for all things ethnic, both in the domestic as well as the international market. Jute bags with the right touch of embellishments can be made to look very ethnic.

 Not just at home, the demand for jute bags has been growing internationally. The export market has grown by 70-80 per cent, says Joshi, and though there is some competition from China and Bangladesh, India controls a sizeable chunk of the market abroad.

 Clients there send their requirements and we work according to that. They prefer heavily embellished bags and dont mind paying a little more for that, says Joshi. 

 Trendy totes

 At Ballyfabs, apart from multi-coloured prints and embroideries, jute is often blended with denim or cotton for a more trendy look. Prices start at 20 for a batua and go up to Rs 300 at most stores, even at the streetside stalls where the trends have trickled down to.

 The stretch outside New Market and the pavement near Gariahat are favoured haunts. In the past few years, at least 20 new hawkers have started selling jute bags in the area. So whatever be the rise in demand, the profit is shared among many, says Amit Kumar, whose father used to sell bags in Gariahat before him. 

 Amit feels that though jute bags now are more fashionable, their quality has gone down. Earlier, the jute used for making bags was thicker, more close-knit. But the finish has improved in recent years. 

 R.S.Sau, another hawker in the area, puts it down to export surpluses being more easily available for the domestic market. These jute bags were always manufactured in Calcutta, but we didnt have access to them. Now the surpluses or export rejects are sold to us cheap for customers here.

 So big has been the boom that Ballyfabs employs fashion graduates to design its bags.

 Many of our designers are NIFT graduates. We introduce a new collection for each season and keep track of the look introduced by the apparel designers so that the bags can complement the trends in fashion, says Joshi.

 So whether on your way to office or preparing to hit the party trail, breeze in and out in style with a jute bag slung over the shoulder. And the best thing about these bags? They are so cheap that you can co-ordinate them with each of your dresses!

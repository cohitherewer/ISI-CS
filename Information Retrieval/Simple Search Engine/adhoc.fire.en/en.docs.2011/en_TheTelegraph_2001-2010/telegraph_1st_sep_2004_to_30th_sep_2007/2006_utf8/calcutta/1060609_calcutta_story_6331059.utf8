The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three is company

 Which film to watch and why, this busy Friday

 For a couple of weeks now, it?s been Fanaa at the single-screen theatres and The Da Vinci Code ? along with Gangster, 36 China Town and X-Men 3 ? at the plexes. But this Friday, the new releases will change all that. With two Bollywood comedies and one Hollywood action-thriller, the advance counters have been extra busy since Wednesday. Metro tells you what to expect. 

 Film: Phir Hera 

 Pheri

 Director: Neeraj Vora

 Cast: Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Bipasha Basu, Rimii

 Plus: Hera Pheri was one of the best and most popular comedies in recent years. The chemistry among Akshay, Suniel and Paresh remains hilarious and when you add Johny Lever, Rajpal Yadav and Sunil Pal to the list, it?s sure to be a laugh riot.

 Minus: The popular perception is that like the first part, the sequel too is directed by Priyadarshan but in reality it is writer Vora (of Daud acting fame) who helms PHP. And Priyan has serious objections calling the new film a sequel. Also, with so many comedians, will the humour just get too heavy?

 Voice: ?I know people won?t accept one bit less than the first film. But I promise to give them two bit better. Phir Hera Pheri is an extra-ordinarily entertaining film.? Neeraj Vora, director.

 Film: Chup Chup Ke

 Director: Priyadarshan

 Cast: Shahid Kapur, Kareena Kapoor, Neha Dhupia, Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Om Puri

 Plus: The Shahid-Kareena combo apart, the film has Priyan?s favourites ? Paresh, Om, Rajpal ? coming together for yet another crazy comedy after their recent hit collaboration in Malamaal Weekly. The music by Himesh Reshammiya is a big hit already with Dil vich and Oh mere zohrajabeen rocking the charts everywhere. And, Bebo is mute in the movie!

 Minus: Too much of the same thing may not spell box-office success for Priyadarshan. Also Kareena and Shahid coming together within a month of their last release 36 China Town might spell a sense of d?j? vu for viewers and keep them away. 

 Voice: ?Priyadarshan comes up with these unique stories and he has his unique way of telling those stories. His comedy comes out of the dilemmas that his characters go through. The comedy is not created through dialogues and other farcical plots. It is the situation which in itself is funny. So even if you have an extremely serious character crying, the audience may find it funny,? Shahid Kapur, actor.

 Film: Mission Impossible 

 III

 Director: JJ Abrams

 Cast: Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Laurence Fishburne 

 Plus: You don?t need an excuse to rest your eyes on Mr Cruise. Then you have Philip Seymour Hoffman, in his first post-Capote biggie, playing the baddie. Director Abrams may be making his big-screen debut but he has helmed Lost, the cult show on the small screen, apart from scripting the Bruce Willis-starrer Armageddon.

 Minus: Part 3 of a franchise, apart from a Lord of the Rings or a Harry Potter, is usually a big disaster. And can anybody better Brian De Palma and John Woo?

 Voice: ?A wonderful addition of an emotional quantity to a suspenseful movie with action,? JJ Abrams, director, in a web interview.

 P.S. The word from the city?s most popular plex, INOX (Forum), is that Phir Hera Pheri with 75 per cent advance booking is the film to watch, followed by CCK and MI3 at 60 per cent.

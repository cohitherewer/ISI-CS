 WITH THAKUMAR JHULI 

 SET TO TURN 100, CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA REVISITS 

 IT AND IS FASCINATED BY THE WOMEN IN THE CHILDHOOD CLASSIC

 SEX 

 amp; THE CITY

 Thakumar Jhuli will soon 

 turn 100. That was one more reason to turn to the fairytales 

 that have been a part of the childhood of so many of us.

 Picking up the recent edition 

 brought out by Mitra Ghosh Publishers, a reprint of the 

 original edition of 1907, proved that one image from my 

 past was preserved. When I read the stories first, more 

 than three decaes ago, I used to believe the author and 

 illustrator of Thakumar Jhuli, Dakshinaranjan Mitra 

 Majumdar, the gentle, white-haired collector of the stories 

 whose photograph also adorns one of the first pages of this 

 edition, was somehow a variant of thakuma. Otherwise 

 there was no trace of the grandmother, the teller of the 

 stories. There is no jhuli either in the delightful 

 woodcuts that bring to life a world of mystery and twilight, 

 where the beautiful is as haunting as the grotesque. 

 How can one begin to remember 

 Thakumar Jhuli? When did I first learn about har 

 murmuri byaram (bone crunch crunch disease, a sham), 

 or kukurkundali (a contorted canine, a form arising 

 from a stupid Brahmin getting mixed up with a donkey)? How 

 they have become part of the family code, har murmuri 

 a name for a neighbour who pretends to be perennially ill?

 But going back, as an adult woman, 

 I was struck most by something else. If grandmother is missing 

 from Thakumar Jhuli though Rabindranath in his 

 introduction to the book congratulates Dakshinaranjan for 

 being able to capture the inflections of her voice, the 

 nuances of her speech, and the archaic simplicity of her 

 world the book is bristling with other kinds of women. 

 As with fairytales all over the world from Hansel and 

 Gretel to Little Red Riding Hood to the Russian 

 Tales of Princess Vassilissa Thakumar Jhuli 

 is a perilous zone. But here most of the danger comes from 

 the women.

 Women here are basically three 

 types: the good woman/queen whom the king banishes wrongfully 

 and who often turns into a ghunte-kuruni dasi (a 

 poor woman who makes her living by carrying cowdung-fuel) 

 or a bird; the princess, demonstrating the classic pose 

 of Rekhe shonar khate gaa, aar rupar khate paa (her 

 body reclines on a golden bed, her feet rest on a silver 

 bed) and the bad woman/ monster woman. 

 Kiranmala is the only girl who 

 takes care of herself and even saves her brothers. 

 But the bad woman is most fascinating. She does amazing 

 scary things, stands outside the fertility cycle and does 

 strange things to other womens babies. She is often 

 the five or six elder queens who turn against the youngest, 

 good queen. When the youngest queen delivers a baby a 

 good woman tends to get pregnant with a son in Saat 

 Bhai Champa, the six other queens bury the baby in the 

 garbage dump and produce little crawling creatures, rats 

 and crabs, in its place. Seven times. In Arun Barun Kiranmala, 

 the three children are replaced by a puppy, a kitten and 

 a wooden doll at birth. 

 But the monster is most terrible 

 as the devouring woman. Not all of them need to be Rakshashis. 

 In the first story, Kalabati Rajkanya (which became 

 popular as Buddhu Bhutum when the story was released 

 as a musical on an L.P.), Buddhu and Bhutum, the monkey 

 and owl princes, sons of two good, banished queens, man 

 the dangerous seas, trying to protect their five brother-princes, 

 the wicked sons of the wicked queens. Suddenly three old 

 women appear and gulp the five down with their Mayurpankhi 

 ship. Only Buddhu-Bhutums ingenuity saves the day. 

 The man-eating woman finds the 

 fullest expression in Lalkamal Neelkamal, the first 

 story in the section Rup Tarasi. She ends up 

 eating her child. Rup Tarasi roughly means a femme 

 fatale, the monster version. Neelkamals mother is 

 actually a Rakshashi most of the monsters in Thakumar 

 Jhuli are Rakshashis, not Rakshashas who lives as 

 the beautiful queen, unbeknown to the king. She wants to 

 cook Lalkamals tender meat with the right spices and 

 eat him. When she cant have him easy, she gobbles 

 up both Lalkamal, and her own son, Neelkamal, in one of 

 the funniest parts. Her mother also would eat up the two 

 boys, if she did not remember they were her naatis. 

 Who were the women who actually 

 wrote Thakumar Jhuli, by telling them to their children 

 and grandchildren, in the light of the lamp, or even after 

 it was turned down? When they drew their monsters, were 

 they thinking of their terrible shashuris, and nanads, 

 paranoid about the only wealth they had, their children, 

 especially the boy? 

 Their imagination turned their 

 homes into kingdoms, them into banished queens and the oppressive 

 women they knew into cannibals. But maybe if they had known 

 the outside world, which is very similar to the inner world, 

 but dominated by another sex, they would know there are 

 as many Rakshashas as Rakshashis.

 A compassionate friend

 Predominantly dealing with the theme of loneliness of children and their yearning for natural familial affection, Anubhav also highlights the presence of a more serious, social problem as visualised through their innocent eyes. When Anubhav, an orphan, takes admission in an elite boarding school, he is teased and ragged by other boys. Though they make him feel miserable, he endures their harassment without protest. When the school superintendent insults the mother of Parban, a meritorious and popular student, Anubhav is made the scapegoat and many of his classmates turn against him at Parbans behest. Later, when Parban comes to know that the relation between his parents has become strained, he feels very upset and desolate. Anubhav feels sorry for Parban because he can relate to his fear of losing the love of his parents. He leads a group of boys and launches upon a mission to bring Parbans parents together for their sons sake. Direction: Romaprasad Banik.

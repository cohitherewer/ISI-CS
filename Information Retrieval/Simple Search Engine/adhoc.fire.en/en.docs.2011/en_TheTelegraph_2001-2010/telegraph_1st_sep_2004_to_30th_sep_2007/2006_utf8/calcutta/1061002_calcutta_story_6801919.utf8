Life

 Juggling ramp and reel

 There are models on the European ramps, in comparison to whom I would definitely look fat, says model-turned-actress Dipannita Sharma, in the wake of the recent controversy over skinny models. I binge on chocolates and eat to my hearts content. Im more for looking healthy than starved, she asserts.

 Recently in town for a few hours to unveil Lakme Beauty Salons Durga puja offering and to showcase a festive look styled by the salons beauty experts, Dipannita looked every bit at ease with the greasepaint and glowing in a sari by Sabyasachi Mukherjee. 

 She has also just finished dubbing Kindle, a 20-minute short film with Sushant Singh and Dipannita is visibly excited. Nitin, the director, has been assistant to Sanjay Leela Bhansali and the film is a wonderful story about a couple and their child, she smiles. 

 The Guwahati girl has made a quiet transition from ramp to reel. Modelling happened to me by fluke, she laughs.

 While in Indraprastha College in Delhi, the leggy lass was participating in inter-college fashion shows and also got a photographer to shoot her a portfolio for free. 

 My friends told me that I should not circulate those pictures at all. But those very pictures got me a few assignments and before I knew it, I was participating in Miss India 1998, she reminisces.

 Moving to Mumbai was the next obvious step, and then on to Bollywood. While she believes that her height and bone structure work to her advantage on the ramp, they act as stumbling blocks on screen.

 The typical Indian mentality wants to see a short, petite and tiny woman on screen, who is in need of a mans protection, spells out Dipannita, as she explains her turn at the box office. I have never done any typical filmi heroine roles; the closest Ive got to that image was Asambhav. I keep getting off-beat roles and crossover movies all the time.

 Dipannita also had a brief brush with television as hostess of a musical show. But daily soaps are a no-no for her since she cant live up to the pressures of the hectic shooting schedules.

 ways one to live life by the moment, Dipannita claims that shes definitely not one of those people who would go up to producers asking for work. I choose from whatever work I am offered in the film industry, but modelling remains her first love. I am still very excited about it, even after all these years, she adds.

 On the personal front, all is calm, as rumours of alleged link-ups with Bollywood heartthrob Abhishek Bachchan have died down. Im not even looking for Mr Right. At the moment, Im enjoying being single, she smiles.

 Beef-up at hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Stung by the allegation of rape on campus, the Medical College and Hospital authorities on Tuesday drew up a plan to beef up security.

 ?Guards will be deployed in the waiting hall where relatives of patients admitted in the hospital spend the night,? said deputy superintendent A.N. Biswas. ?The guards will keep a watch on women relatives and the persons they are interacting with.?

 A 26-year-old woman, whose husband is being treated for the past few days, has alleged that she had been raped by Virendra Kumar, son of a hospital guard, on the roof of the radiotherapy building early on Sunday.

 The woman knew Virendra, as he used to work as a private attendant in the ward where her husband is admitted. On Sunday night, he came to the waiting hall and told the woman that her husband?s condition had deteriorated and asked her to accompany him to the ward.

 ?There are strong evidences that she was raped. The injury marks on various parts of the body and the broken bangles point towards that,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (central).

 To avoid such incidents, the hospital administration has decided to evict ?unauthorised people?, mostly relatives of Group-D employees, living on the compound. ?Their number is rising and we have ordered their eviction,? said an official. 

 Several pockets on the sprawling campus remain dark at night, as the street lights have gone out of order. Public works department engineers have been reportedly asked to repair the lights. ?We feel scared to cross these stretches after sundown,? said a senior house staff.

 The authorities have also asked police to provide plainclothesmen in front of the outpatients? departments and in the wards. 

 Deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar, however, said: ?The hospital compound is a huge area and it?s difficult to provide enough personnel. The hospital?s own security team has to ensure safety of the patients and their relatives.?

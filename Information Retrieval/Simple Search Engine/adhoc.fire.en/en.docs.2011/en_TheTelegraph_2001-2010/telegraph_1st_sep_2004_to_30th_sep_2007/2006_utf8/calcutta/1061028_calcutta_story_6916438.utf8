 SHAUN KENWORTHY

 Im sure Ive told you 

 this before. I used to have this old aunt, who was actually 

 one of two sisters, both spinsters and both Catholic. Everything 

 in their lives revolved around the church. The one good 

 thing about the church-going tradition is the baking tradition. 

 Aunt Josie, the softer of the two, spent most of her life 

 in the kitchen baking cakes, buns and cookies for themselves, 

 the church and just about anyone else who was interested. 

 You could walk into the kitchen anytime and there would 

 be stacks of cake tins full to the brim with all sorts of 

 goodies.

 Theres always a lot of baking 

 going on for various fetes and fairs throughout the year, 

 where the men would compete to make the best carrot wine 

 of the year. The ladies get down and dirty to try and win 

 the best Victoria sandwich competition and best dried flower 

 arrangement. All very competitive as you can imagine.

 The soggy sponge was another cracker, 

 where youd have someone like the vicar or a local 

 teacher smilingly sticking his head through a cut-out of 

 a clown and youd have to throw wet sponges at him. 

 Fantastic fun as you can imagine for an eight-year-old.

 The place Im trying to get 

 to is the biscuits that the old ladies would bring along 

 to sell to raise funds for the church roof or something. 

 They were the best. All my friends and me would see how 

 many we could woof down during the afternoon with our glasses 

 of milk. I think I remember doing about 30 once (why Im 

 probably the size I am now!) and was more than likely to 

 fall promptly sick afterwards.

 A good friend just recently was 

 reminiscing about similar things when he was younger. During 

 Durga Puja he and his friends would make a meal out of seeing 

 who could eat the most plates of bhog without throwing 

 up on Ashtami.

 At the end of the day, who doesnt 

 love cookies and biscuits and that freshly-baking smell; 

 it must be up there with freshly-brewed coffee and the smell 

 you get when you open a bar of bitter chocolate. I have 

 to say that in my case the phenomenon of the American-style 

 half-baked and deliciously chewy cookie has to be one of 

 the best things youll ever put into your mouth. Youll 

 have to trust me on this, if youve never tried one.

 The recipe below is a great base 

 recipe for the chewy American cookie and something Ill 

 give you a free rein with to pretty much add whatever you 

 will. 

 Some of my favourites would be 

 the obvious chocolate chips, a handful of nuts or raisins 

 or a good pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon or powdered ginger, 

 but really, the list is endless.

 The recipe will make loads of 

 cookies; you could either freeze or refrigerate some of 

 the dough to use later.

 My ultimate drop cookies

 Firstly, pre-heat an oven to around 

 170OC. Next, sift together 700g of flour, one-and-a-half 

 tsp of baking soda and 10g of salt (you could substitute 

 200g of cocoa for 200g of flour for chocolate cookies) and 

 set aside.

 Next, cream together 330g butter 

 and 500g of either castor or icing sugar. Beat both of these 

 together until light and creamy. Add four eggs slowly, one 

 at a time. Lastly, add a little vanilla essence, then fold 

 in the flour and whatever else you fancy.

 Take a clean baking sheet. Either 

 grease and flour lightly or place a piece of greaseproof 

 paper. Grab yourself a teaspoon and spoon a little at a 

 time on to the tray, leaving around an inch of space all 

 around each one.

 Lastly, bake until golden brown 

 but still soft and chewy.

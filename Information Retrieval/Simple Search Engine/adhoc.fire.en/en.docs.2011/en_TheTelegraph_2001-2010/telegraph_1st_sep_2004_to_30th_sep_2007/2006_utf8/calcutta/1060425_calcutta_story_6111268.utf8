 Mrs Calcutta really wants to dance, but she somehow can?t make it to the floor. Emboldened by the anonymity of the telephone, she went on a registration spree for a song-and-dance show on small screen, but when it came to taking the stage on D-day, she developed cold feet.

 Going by the phone registrations, the stage for the Calcutta leg of Boogie Woogie Mothers Special was set for 150 aspirants but only five turned up on Monday. The mystery of the missing moms took centre stage at Gariahaat Mall, with little hope of the count going up on the next two audition days.

 More than 80 mothers in Calcutta had called up and signed in for the special Sony show in just the last three days. In the same period, the number of dial-in registrations in Delhi was 65.

 ?With the number of registrations and inquiries we received from Calcutta, we were expecting a huge turnout. But a shock awaited us on the first day of the auditions,? said Gurpreet Singh Sethi of coordinating agency RGV Events, staring at the deserted dance stage.

 Reasons for the no-show ranged from the scorching heat to domestic chores, opposition from in-laws to plain lack of pluck. ?I was very keen to audition because I keep on participating in such shows at the local level. But I could not make it on Monday because I had lots of work at home. Moreover, if I am selected for the finals, there is no way I can leave my house and stay in Mumbai for so many days. With a husband and two children, I have a lot of responsibility at home,? admitted Gargi Ghosh of Jhowtala Road. 

 Just a handful made it to the Gariahaat Mall stage. 

 ?Though I do not have any formal training, I love listening to music and dancing. I organise various local musical programmes. I think this a good opportunity,? said Nidhi Singh of Taratala.

 The numbers are not expected to go up drastically on the second or third days. ?If the first day did not attract a crowd, the other two days will also be the same. Normally, the excitement is the maximum on the first day? There is no dearth of talent in the city. It?s just that they take time in coming out,? observed Sethi.

 The Mothers Special was planned keeping in mind the requests that kept pouring in from various cities.

 ?Boogie Woogie was always associated with children and youngsters. Though we introduced lots of new concepts on the show, we never did something for the mothers. A lot of mothers would approach us and request us to arrange for a contest for them,? revealed Ravi Behl, one of the producers of the popular show.

 When asked about the reluctance of moms in the city to slip on their dancing shoes, he said: ?Calcutta is a musical place and we had expected more women to come forward for the auditions, especially when there is a lack of such talent shows in that segment.?

 Next weekend you can be at... 

Yuksum

 The misty heights of the snow-capped 

 Kanchenjunga and surrounding mountains have over the years 

 drawn tourists, nature lovers, trekkers and photographers.

 Of the motorable destinations, Yuksum, in west Sikkim, offers the closest view of the mighty peak. You will not find a better place to watch Kanchenjunga turning from pinkish orange to liquid gold at daybreak and dusk.

 The town, perched on a ridge at a height of 4,500 ft, is accessible by bus and jeep from Siliguri and Gangtok. Pelling, another tourist spot, is only 32 km from Yuksum.

 The town serves as the base for the climbing courses organised by the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling. The towns name means the meeting point of three lamas. The lamas in question consecrated the first Chogyal (ruler) of Sikkim. The remnants of the ceremony stone seats and a footprint of the head lama has been preserved in Norbugang Chorten.

 Yuksum is also home to Dubdi, the oldest Gompha in Sikkim, and a mini-lake called Katok. It was here that the first ruler was crowned and given the title of Dharmaraja in 1641. The town is a trekkers paradise. One can climb a host of peaks with the resort as the base. One of the trails leads deep into the heart of the Kanchenjunga.

 But even if you are looking for a quiet holiday, Yuksum will not disappoint. The psychedelic play of colours as sunlight reflects off the snow-clad ranges will keep you captivated. Add to that the wide variety of flora and fauna and the hospitality of the residents and you have all the ingredients of a memorable vacation.

 Not to be ignored is the cultural heritage of Yuksum, preserved in the Thankas, Gomphas and Chortens. Pemayangtse Monastery and Sankha-Cho-Ling Gompha, near the Pelling helipad, are prominent pilgrimage sites.

 Multi-coloured prayer flags surround the ruins of Rabdanste Palace, a must-visit. The silence of the forest around the relics, the peace flags with their indecipherable script flapping in the wind and the mountains echoing every sound will ensure you do not forget the trip in a hurry.

 Khacho-Pal-ri or Khechiperi, the sacred lake, is just as enchanting. You wont find a leaf on the crystal-clear water. Birds fly away with the leaves as soon as they drop on the water. This is known as the Wishing Lake as local residents believe that any wish you make standing on the banks and looking at the blue water will be fulfilled.

 A trip to Yuksum will remain incomplete without a visit to Sangey, Rimbi and Kanchenjunga falls. Shingshore Bridge, the second highest gorge bridge in Asia, will make you marvel at the dexterity of the builders. A large stone dropped from the bridge takes around 10 seconds to hit the water. From the bridge, the river below is nothing but a narrow ribbon. 

 Dubdi was the first monastery established after the consecration ceremony of the first Chogyal. It is on a hilltop above the town, bordered by verdant forests. The trek to the monastery takes about an hour. No wonder the reclusive lamas find the place just right for meditation. 

 The Cham or the Mask Dance, performed 

 by the lamas, is the highlight of the monasteries calendars. 

 Visit during the festival for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

 Surrounded by a dense forest of 

 silver fir, hemlock and magnolia with rhododendrons adding 

 a sparkle of colour, Yuksum is a sight for sore eyes. Even 

 the white titans in the background peek out from behind 

 a veil of clouds to watch nature spread out her bounty in 

 this hill resort.

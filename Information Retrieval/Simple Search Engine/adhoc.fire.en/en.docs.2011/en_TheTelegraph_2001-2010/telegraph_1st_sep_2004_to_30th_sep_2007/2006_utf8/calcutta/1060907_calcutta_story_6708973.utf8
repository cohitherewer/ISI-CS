 A for arts, B for business Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees balancing act over Technicians Studio came under the spotlight on Wednesday morning, when he assured Soumitra Chatterjee that privatisation of the Tollygunge address would not jeopardise the interests of the film industry.

 After tinsel towns traffic-stopper roadshow on Monday to protest the privatisation of Technicians, the chief minister had called the most famous face of Tollywood to Alimuddin Street. The meeting was satisfactory, was all that Chatterjee, chairman of Artistes Forum, would say. But sources confirmed that Bhattacharjee had assured Rays hero that the interests of artistes and technicians would be safeguarded in the studio deal, and that he would meet members of the industrys steering committee after September 11.

 The government has decided to lease out the 70-year-old studio to a private player and check the annual drain of Rs 40 lakh from the state exchequer. That is just the running cost and maintenance would mean additional cost. So, handing it over to a private player who can run it is the only way out, Dilip Chakraborty, principal secretary, information and cultural affairs, told Metro on Wednesday.

 That was hours after Bhattacharjee met Chatterjee and promised to walk the middle path between arts and business (read: hand over the studio to realty, but with a rider).

 Dilip Chakraborty said the bidders (till now Bengal Unitech, the Merlin Group and Zee Telefilms) will first make a technical presentation before the CMDA. The chosen one must have some experience in the audio-visual industry and be committed to upgrade studio facilities, he added.

 But Tollywood is not so sure. The government has to clarify the structure of upgrade. Once a private party takes over, our shooting space could well be limited, said Pronab Chowdhury, secretary, Eastern India Cinetel Welfare Trust.

 Wednesdays meeting between the chief minister and Chatterjee was termed positive by leading man Prosenjit, who admitted being rattled by the fact that the government had not taken us into confidence and that the tender didnt specify anything about the studios upgrade.

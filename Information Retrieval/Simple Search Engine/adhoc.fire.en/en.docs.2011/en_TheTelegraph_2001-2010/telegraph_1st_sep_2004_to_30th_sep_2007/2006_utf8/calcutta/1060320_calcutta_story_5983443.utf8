 Moments of merriment

 Balloons, games, toy train rides, goodies, music, food packets? The SAP (Special Area Project) carnival Moment, organised by the youth wing of Rotary International, was certainly ?the moment? for orphans and underprivileged children. 

 But one came away wishing that other organisations, too, contributed their moments to light up the world. The events, the huddled groups of giggling girls, the frail youngsters wonder-eyed at this sudden spell of merriment ? all generated a feeling of talents wasted.

 ?100, 99, 98, 97?,? young Thabasum?s voice trails off in the Counting Backwards Contest; little Nirmala, in an oversized red frock, proffers her palm to have her name written on it, she herself being unable to write. 

 But friend Asha ( head shaven and eyebrows knit in a perpetual frown) manages the upper and lower alphabets with dexterity. A short distance away, a large group of girls are lustily singing the title song of No Entry, while tiny Nazma softly confides that had there been a drawing contest, she would have come first. 

 There are some 400 girls thronging the Loreto House playground. Most from the Rainbow Night Shelter run by Loreto Sealdah, Loreto Bowbazar and Loreto House. 

 Sister Mercy, principal, Loreto House, explained: ?The school has been allowing these street children a safe place to sleep in because they face a lot of abuse outside. Some of them attend our free school.?

 Shakir Yahiya, chairman, World Rotract Wing, was pleased as punch at the turnout. ?March 13 is the anniversary of Rotract, which we celebrate every year through a week of events, like the Moment. Ten years ago, we could reach only 10 or 12 children. Thanks to the support from social help groups, we are now able to organise a real carnival,? said Yahiya, watching the girls piling merrily into the toy train chugging round and round a makeshift track.

 Close by, girls were tumbling down an inflated Mickey Mouse. ?Just parading the kids to one of the standard amusement destinations was not enough. We wanted to be really involved in the activity. Many of the things were given to us on a subsidised rate and we spent about Rs 40,000, a small sum for such images of joy,? said Yahiya.

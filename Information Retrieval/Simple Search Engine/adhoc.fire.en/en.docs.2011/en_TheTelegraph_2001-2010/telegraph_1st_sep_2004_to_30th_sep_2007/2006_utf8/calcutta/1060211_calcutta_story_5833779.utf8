The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A bit of this, a bit of that

 As a reinvention 

 of space and theatre, Creative Commune staged American 

 playwright Tennessee Williams?s The Glass Menagerie 

 and A Streetcar Named Desire on the Landmark 

 rooftop on Friday. Blending music from the Fifties, 

 links with the Hollywood film versions and pop art, 

 the production was directed by Trina Nileena Banerjee.

 With such a strong portfolio behind 

 them, including Harold Pinter, Neil Simon, James Saunders 

 and Christopher Durang, why must Ace Productions settle 

 for inferior, imitative material like Anything but Love! 

 (at Birla Sabhagar)? The very fact that they refuse 

 to declare the dramatist?s name alerts us to the suspect 

 nature of the endeavour, a cleverly masked Indianisation 

 of Barry Creiton?s Double Act, itself an Australian 

 take-off on Durang?s Beyond Therapy.

 It has virtually the same situation 

 and characters: a divorced couple reuniting after a chance 

 meeting in a restaurant, and relating their inner feelings 

 to us through sessions of therapy with unseen shrinks. The 

 Indianiser lacks not only Durang?s dialogic finesse but 

 also his violently satirical jabs at American sexuality 

 and obsession with psychoanalysis. Director Vikranth Pawar 

 turns it into just a series of sexy jokes, reminding me 

 of some of the worst episodes of Sex and the City.

 A sad state of affairs for the 

 stars, Mandira Bedi and Samir Soni, both of whom give of 

 their best, but in a waste of time and talent. They should 

 have exercised their better judgment and rejected this obviously 

 deficient script. Bedi in particular, who knows the difference, 

 having acted in Durang?s Laughing Wild.

 In contrast, the local Theatrecian?s 

 performance of Chekhov?s Marriage Proposal (at Saturday 

 Club) shows how much more subtly a master dramatist can 

 treat the same subject of war between the sexes. It is one 

 of Chekhov?s classic 19th-century one-act plays, where a 

 man comes to his neighbour to ask for his daughter?s hand, 

 and the would-be courtship degenerates into a massively 

 farcical row, leading to the hero?s near-death experience. 

 Roshni Bose excels as the girl, slicing the air with her 

 arms and pitching her voice high in her flights of fury. 

 Calcutta?s latest comic duo, Deborshi Barat and Dhruv Mookerjee, 

 plays up the parts as wooer and father respectively.

 The men returned, partnered by 

 Ronjini Chakraborty, in two even shorter contemporary playlets 

 by David Ives, which followed Chekhov rather anticlimactically. 

 Philadelphia does not rise to the occasion at all, 

 while Sure Thing has a clever idea but becomes predictable 

 after some time. My recommendation is that Theatrecian stage 

 a full Chekhov evening instead, perhaps adding The Wedding 

 and The Anniversary as companion pieces.

 Theatrecian also visited Oxford 

 Bookstore with Pinter?s Victoria Station and a discussion 

 to mark his Nobel Prize. A lighter work by Pinter, it receives 

 full-tilt comic treatment from the aforesaid Mookerjee-Barat 

 pair.

 The former enacts a taxi dispatcher 

 on radio and the latter a recalcitrant cabbie least interested 

 in taking orders. One of Pinter?s rare plays that could 

 easily adapt into Calcutta life, retitled Howrah Station! 

 We see so many taxi drivers like Barat that it would be 

 a sure-fire hit.

 Beyond borders

 An extension of our group theatre 

 is how director Meghnad Bhattacharya describes the first 

 South Asian Theatre Festival. Organised by Epic Actor?s 

 Workshop and Mrittika Inc, it will be held from July 14-16 

 at George Street Playhouse, New Jersey.

 Founded by Dipan Ray, the Epic 

 Actor?s Workshop has for nearly a decade provided theatre-loving 

 NRIs the essential link with the Calcutta stage. Mrittika, 

 represented here by Purno Bhattacharya, propagates the language 

 and cultural heritage of India and Bangladesh.

 To showcase creative excellence 

 and strengthen community bonds, eight plays in Bengali, 

 Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati will be staged. To vault the 

 language barrier, English transcriptions of the dialogues 

 will be displayed on a cyclorama at eye-level.

 Meghnad Bhattacharya and Bibhas 

 Chakraborty are two of the directors from India, Pakistan 

 and Bangladesh invited to work with groups from New York, 

 Toronto, New Jersey, North Carolina and Washington DC. 

 Chakraborty will be taking actors 

 from the Epic Actor?s Workshop through a production of Rabindranath 

 Tagore?s Raktakarabi. Having earlier directed the 

 Epic in Chaak Bhanga Madhu and Bolidan, he 

 says the actors there may lack technical know how but not 

 dedication or passion.

 Bhattacharya, who has directed 

 Adab and Karnabati in the US, agrees. He is 

 to direct Gyan Brikkher Phol (staged in the mid-80s 

 in Calcutta) with Toronto-based Bangiya Natya Parishad.

 Ajit Rakshit of New Jersey, a 

 spokesperson for the organising team, rues that the audience 

 for Bengali plays remained restricted to NRIs. ?Perhaps 

 there?s a need to rethink the choice of plays.? But Chandan 

 Sen, who leads the technical team for Epic and several other 

 groups, points out that the play Nuraldeener Shara Jiban 

 involving Indian, Bangladeshi and American actors, won rave 

 reviews and drew Americans in droves during its two-week 

 run at New York?s 2nd Avenue.

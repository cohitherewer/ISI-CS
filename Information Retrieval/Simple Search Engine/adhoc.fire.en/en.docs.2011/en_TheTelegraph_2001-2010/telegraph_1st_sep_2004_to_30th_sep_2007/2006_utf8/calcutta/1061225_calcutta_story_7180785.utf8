 Former chief minister Jyoti Basu on Sunday laid the foundation stone of Shukhobrishti, a mass housing project of the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation in New Town Action Area III.

 The estate, with 20,000 dwelling units for low and middle-income groups will be developed by Bengal Shapoorji Housing Development, a wing of Shapoorji Pallonji and Co. Ltd. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 1,500 crore.

 The design solution has been provided by Singapore-based Subarna International.

 The estate will have two wings Spandan, with 12,000 flats costing Rs 3 lakh each, and Sparsh, with 8,000 flats priced at Rs 6 lakh each, said Ramakrishna Sharma, CEO of Shapoorji Pallonji and Co.

 Spread over 150 acres, Shukhobrishti is one of the biggest housing estates being developed for the low and middle-income groups, said external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who was present at the programme.

 Housing minister Goutam Deb thanked the farmers who had handed over their land for the estate. We have a Rs 72-crore neighbourhood development project to help the farmers, he pointed out.

 Among others present at the programme were Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and local CPM legislator Rabin Mondol.

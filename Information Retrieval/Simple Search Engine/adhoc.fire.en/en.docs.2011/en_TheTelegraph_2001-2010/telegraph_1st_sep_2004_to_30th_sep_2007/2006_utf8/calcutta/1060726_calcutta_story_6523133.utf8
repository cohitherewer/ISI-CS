 The seat of trendsetting thoughts, ideas and philosophies in literature and the fine arts, Shantiniketan has also gifted the nation a vast repertoire of talent in the field of the liberal arts. Shrishti, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, sculptures and prints by 22 artists of Shantiniketan, is a tribute by them to the place that has inspired their creativity and nurtured their genius. Ranging from simple line-sketches in sober monochromes to canvases full of rich, vivid colours, from delicately-chiselled ornate figures to sturdily-crafted heavy, opaque forms, the works on show have great variety in design, theme and workmanship, capturing the imagination of the common art lover. Participating artists include Prasun Kanti Bhattacharya, Pampa Panwar, Nandadulal Mukherjee (She; picture above), Pulak Dutta, Janak Jhankar Narzary, Mahjabin I. Majumdar, Ambarish Nandan, Pinaki Barua, Santanu Bhattacharya and Bhaskar Mukherjee.

What: Fashion Extravaganza 06, an evening 

presented by Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand.

 When: March 12, 8 pm onwards. 

 The show: A corporate event with a dash of glamour is how you would describe Fashion Extravaganza 06. Conceptualised by entrepreneur Heena Gorsia, this glittering show gained momentum after a brief cocktail session leading up to the fashion show. 

 Ten sequences, back-to-back, kept the eager audience busy ? whether seated or struggling to be seated.

 The opening act, Untamed Beauty, by Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week-bound designer Abhishek Dutta drew an enthusiastic response. The collection boasted his signature style elements like lots of leather and metallic crochet detailing. 

 The next sequence, by Rupa Kajaria of Rashee boutique, was titled Naantra. Opulent embellishments, bridal hues and interesting drapes lent a wearable feel to the collection. Aveek Bhattacharya then put up his style story, My Fair Lady, an impressive collection that saw adequate surface texturing, metallic colour palette and interesting silhouettes. Straight jackets and cigarette pants merged beautifully with voluminous Kalidaar kurtas. 

 The next sequence showcased designer Yogita Kichlus Enchant collection. Embroidered saris and exquisite lehngas dominated this line of garments. K. Padmajas funky street wear was up next, a very fresh kitsch-like line. The collection, titled Nothing in Particular, was indeed refreshing. The sixth sequence by Lata Harlalka from Palki boutique, called Fusion Clothing, showcased her trademark traditionalism and more. 

 Red Carpet, by Jaya Mishra boasted formalwear, highly embellished and glittering. Desperation by Tejas Gandhi showcased a modern design sensibility.

 Shamlu Dudejas Holi Ke Rang redefined the humble kantha stitch as she displayed a stunning line of saris and jackets, embellished exquisitely for todays woman. Finally, Anshu Modis Indian Summer saw a splash of interesting colours and textiles. 

 Model watch: Mumbai-based models Viveka Babajee, Tapur Chatterjee, Aanchal Kumar and Sheetal Menon sashayed down the ramp along with their Calcutta counterparts like Priyanka Pal, Tanushree, Amrita, Pamela, Jessica, Tina, Sreshthaa, Konkona and Saurabh.

 The finale sequence by Digjam also had Calcutta biz names like Rajiv Jindal, Ravi Todi, N.G. Khaitan, Anand Agarwal, K.K. Khemka, Preetam Jalan, Rajiv Singhi, Ramanand Agarwal, Partho Sadhan Bose and Tapas Raha walking the ramp.

 Voiceover: This is an effort to launch budding designers and showcase the talent of other established ones. This evening ? a synthesis of fashion and business ? is truly special, smiled Santosh Rungta, president of the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

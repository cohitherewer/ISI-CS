 Its only hair ? it will grow back... is what internationally renowned hairstylist John Gillespie tells his clients as he urges them to be different.

 Having the same hairstyle all the time is like wearing the same colour or outfit daily ? boring, says the stylist from Scotland. 

 John was in town on Monday to launch Satinique, an Amway hair care collection of which he is the brand ambassador.

 Having grown up with hairdresser parents, spending most hours in the salon and sweeping hair off floors, John insists that his choice of career was never planned. My father was not too excited, but by the time I was 15, I had made up my mind, he recalls.

 A training in Vidal Sassoon followed and before he knew it, John had arrived.

 He talks to GoodLife about his dreams, trends and more.

 Dream client: Angelina Jolie. She has 

never done much to her hair ? I would love to do something about it, he 

says.

 Tempted to go short with her length, John would like to give Jolie a blunt fringe. It would be like an arch, ending just above her eyebrows, something sharp, something geometric, he imagines.

 Another all-time favourite client is popstar Christina Aguilera, whom he had styled for the MTV Europe Music Awards 2004. John would like to give Christina a super short, sexy cut and leave her blonde, of course.

 The Indian beauty: Her eyes are so beautiful that I feel like getting lost in them. Not a corny Hindi movie dialogue, this is John for you.

 Simply smitten by the Indian woman is how he can be described best, Aishwarya Rais image acting as a ready reckoner at all times.

 Gaga over her eyes and her hair that accentuates her eyes further, John feels that no sight is more attractive than an Indian beauty.

 He has one complaint though: Indian women have a long hair fixation. The quality of their hair is amazing and they should experiment more often.

Tomorrows take: 

 Johns prediction for the next big look revolves around styles that showcase lots of movement, sharp, geometric cuts and a variety of browns.

 Inspirations from the 60s and 70s looks are in, very Bridgette Bardot, he says. 

 The cuts, he adds, will go sharper, shorter and more geometric, pretty much variations of the classic bob.

 Cafe latte, cappuccino, espresso, caramel, mocha?These get yummier once translated to hair colour, says the expert. 

 He suggests the use of four or five hues of brown at the same time. This will go well with Indian hair too, looking well-blended as well as healthy, since there isnt too much colour lightening involved, he adds.

 Mane mantra and myth: Whichever cut or colour might be in, John believes that one thing that fails to go out of style is healthy hair. Terrific trends can come and go. But fashion is tough, like chasing a tail. Something that was considered fashionable is no longer so, just as soon as it is seen sported by everyone, he says.

 But not so with healthy hair ? something that he considers precious asset.

 John also clears some common confusions on hair care. Daily washing is certainly not injurious to hair health, because clean hair is equal to healthy hair, he adds. 

 Years of working in close association with hair experts, scalp experts and trichologists have taught him more.

 His advice: Choose a shampoo that has mild cleansing agents, instead of harsh ones that strip off natural oils and moisture.

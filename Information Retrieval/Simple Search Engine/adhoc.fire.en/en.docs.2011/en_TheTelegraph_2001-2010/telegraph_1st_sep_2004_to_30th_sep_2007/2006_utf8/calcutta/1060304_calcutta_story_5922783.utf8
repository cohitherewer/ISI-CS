The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 May 15 date for exams

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The last bid by Calcutta University to go by the original schedule for this year?s undergraduate examinations came to a nought on Friday, after the state government informed it that the five-phase election dates cannot be changed.

 The university has called an emergency meeting of its undergraduate council on March 10 to fix a revised schedule for the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II exams. The exams, scheduled to begin from April 18, had to be postponed because the Assembly election coincides with them.

 ?Given the situation, we are unable to begin the Part II exams before May 15,? Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), said. ?We will finalise the revised time-table of the Part II exams on March 10,? he added.

 To allow students to sit for the entry tests of various institutions, including Jawaharlal Nehru University, the authorities are planning to adopt certain measures exclusively for this year. For instance, the university is likely to make special arrangements to hold the Part II exams even on Sundays and holidays.

 The university?s effort to squeeze the exams in between the five-phase elections, covering three weeks, did not work out because the state government will not be able to provide enough policemen to guard exam centres and the strong rooms where answer scripts will be stored.

 Contemporary art by Australias indigenous cultures has captured the attention of connoisseurs the world over. Being held as part of AusArts: Celebrating Australian Arts and Culture 2006-2007, the ongoing exhibition of modern aboriginal art from West Arnhem Land, Australia, showcases the vitality and innovation of current arts practice in that country. The highlight of the exhibition includes Seasons of the Kunwinjku, a collection of paintings reflecting the lyrical grace of West Arnhem Land?s rich artistic tradition. The stylistic techniques and images expressed in ochre and earth pigments in this show have been used by aboriginal artists for thousands of years. Today?s Kunwinjku artists have transposed these traditions from rock and bark to paper; a development that has allowed them to communicate with renewed intensity, some of the world?s oldest living culture. Also featuring Kiripuranji, an exhibition of strikingly beautiful works by Tiwi Island artists.

 Battle at Kali puja soiree in Buddhas locality

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Barely a week after the violence near chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees much-protected Palm Avenue neighbourhood, the area turned into a battle field late on Kali puja night. 

 According to police, trouble erupted when two girls started dancing at a function organised by a club near Bondel Gate Road.

 Members of a group asked the girls to perform a cabaret, to which some youths objected. This led to a heated exchange and subsequently, a fistfight. 

 Later, members of one group, armed with revolvers and bombs, ran amok, beating up two youths and damaging three vehicles parked close by.

 Tension prevailed in the area and the soiree had to be called off. Officers of Gariahat and Karaya police stations rushed to the spot and cordoned off the area. 

 Seven people were arrested on charges of rioting. Three of them had been arrested earlier in connection with a motorcycle theft in the area, said an officer of Karaya police station.

 Police said members of the two groups were drunk. 

 Some youths belonging to one group started passing lewd comments at the girls and asked them to remove their clothes. Tension prevailed when members of another group raised their voice and soon a clash ensued, said an officer of Karaya police station.

 The fracas continued for about half-an-hour. In retaliation, members of a group, allegedly backed by the Trinamul Congress, brought out revolvers to intimidate the other group and they damaged three vehicles, the officer said.

 The soiree is organised by the club every year on Kali puja night. Even last year, this had led to a law-and-order problem. We are now planning not to give permission for holding such programmes in such a sensitive area, he added. 

 According to local residents, crimelords shielded by political leaders in the vicinity of what should be the citys most protected locality have robbed police of sleep and left them red in the face.

 The neighbourhood has made news for all the wrong reasons over the past year and police despite having turned the stretch into a fortress have always been found chasing goons after the crime is committed, complained Atanu Das, a resident of Bamanpara.

 Members of two groups, allegedly owing allegiance to the CPM and Trinamul Congress, had fought a pitched battle and fired three rounds of bullets on Holi night this year.

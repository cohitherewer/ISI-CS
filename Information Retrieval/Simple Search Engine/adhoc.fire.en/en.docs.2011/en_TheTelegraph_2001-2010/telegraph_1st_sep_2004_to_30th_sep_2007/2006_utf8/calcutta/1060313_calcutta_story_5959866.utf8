 A fire broke out at a Union Bank of India (UBI) branch, housed on the second floor of a five-storeyed building at 55, Ezra Street, on Sunday morning. Eight fire tenders were pressed into action and the blaze was brought under control in an hour.

 Divisional officer of the fire service Deepak Kumar Sarkar said an electrical short circuit in the server room of the bank, located in the heart of Burrabazar, had caused the fire.

 ?There were three uninterrupted power supply units in the room, which function round-the-clock. One of them developed a short circuit around 11 am,? Sarkar said.

 Fire brigade officials said an inquiry would be launched to ascertain why the bank had no fire-safety system.

 ?All offices that are open to the public must have the rudimentary fire-safety measures. But I could not spot a single fire extinguisher in the bank,? said a fire department official.

 Subhash Puri, who works as electrician in the building, saw smoke bellowing out of the second floor through window shafts and called up the fire department. 

 He then opened the main supply box and snapped connection to the part of the building housing the bank.

 ?I was alarmed by a pungent smell and realised that a portion of the building was on fire. Once I confirmed where the smell was coming from, I cut off the power supply. I also sent a boy from the neighbourhood to the nearby Lalbazar fire services office,? Puri recalled.

 Within minutes, fire officials and cops from Bowbazar police station arrived at the site. ?Several offices are housed in the building. The fire could have been disastrous if we were late by even 10 minutes,? said divisional fire service officer Sarkar.

 ?Our men had problems entering the building, as it was enveloped with thick smoke. The smoke cleared a bit after the windows were broken open, and only then could the firefighters enter the bank,? he added.

 Shyamalendu Mondol, chief manager of the Ezra Street branch of UBI, said the building was being renovated for the past one and a half months. An air-conditioning system, smoke alarms and other gadgets are being set up.

 ?The fire broke out at a time when most of the the gadgets have been put in place, but are not operational yet. Our customers, however, will not face any problem operating their accounts. The bank will remain open tomorrow,? Mondol asserted.

 ?CESC officials have isolated the affected part of the building and power supply will be restored only after the investigations are over and the authorities approve a reconnection,? a fire department official said.

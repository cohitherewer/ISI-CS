The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Streetside story

 April 16 was the launch of Head over Heels 

at Oxford Bookstore, a series of five kids? activities. It kicked off with a theatre 

workshop, conducted by Ramanjit Kaur of The Creative Arts. The participants had 

to express emotions like joy, sorrow, anger and fear, and then they were taught 

improvisation. After the initial exercises performed to music, the children were 

asked to create impromptu playlets with a comic element. They came up with stories 

about crows eating up the food of seaside tourists, chicken being mixed in tea 

and flying balloons at the fair. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya

Every city has its areas where transient populations 

converge. Calcutta?s is Sudder Street. It is entirely geared towards western backpackers, 

to-ing and fro-ing across the subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Sudder Street is 

their Bengali base. A vast majority of the youngsters who stay here are on their 

?gap year? or time off. To understand Sudder Street?s unique economy, one must 

understand the nature of the gap year.

 The gap year (or simply ?year out?) has become an almost institutional rite of passage in the UK, founded upon the ideal that a young person must broaden his or her horizons before going onto the final phase of the education treadmill that is university. 

 Self-discovery and new experiences are the much trumped objectives of many people?s backpacking. Unfortunately, the whole gap year experience in India is now somewhat of a clich?. 

 For thousands of westerners, India is a distant nation which occupies a hazy place in their consciousness ? a heady mix of The Beatles at ashrams, religious mysticism, all-round exoticism, and a place where everybody is obsessed with a sport that ruined their summer afternoons at school.

 Stephen and Phillip, both 19 years old, are typical travellers from England who have come for a two-day stay in Calcutta. Wearing huge sunglasses and school football shirts, with all their possessions crammed into their huge backpacks, they resemble giant mutant beetles.

 They spent three weeks in Thailand and flew here from Bangkok. ?Calcutta is certainly a sobering experience after Thailand. We spent most of the time on the beach,? says Phillip. ?We found out about Sudder Street from the Lonely Planet guide, which made out that it is the only place in Calcutta with cheap accommodation.?

 Says Stephen: ?I?m going to be frank. I mean, apart from Park Street and Sudder Street, we haven?t been anywhere. This is probably the least beautiful place we?ve visited. We?ve only got two days before we head out west, so we?re just passing the time in the bars.?

 One unavoidable part of Sudder Street is the criminal element that sell hashish. Are they at all bothered about the number of times that they are offered drugs? ?Look, compared to where we?ve just been this (Sudder Street) is very tame. Anyway, you haven?t been travelling properly until you?ve smoked some good Indian hash.?

 By and large, it is now commonly acknowledged that you are about as likely to aid spiritual enlightenment by smoking hashish as you are from licking the toilet seat. If too much hashish doesn?t send you teetering off the tightrope of sanity, then it will invariably make you excruciatingly boring company. Naturally there are plenty of people who are around to cater for the firangi?s quest for tedious conversation.

 A rather more mature take on Sudder Street and backpacking is offered by Pierre, a 24-year-old Frenchman. Having landed in Mumbai, he then set off across the breadth of India before ending up in Calcutta, the final leg of his Indian trip.

 Like the English boys, he feels that Sudder Street is small fry as far as backpacking circuses go. ?It doesn?t bother me. You have drugs in France, so I would be surprised if they weren?t in India.?

 Most perceptively (and perhaps controversially), Pierre voiced his disillusionment with the backpackers he has encountered in India. ?I think one thing about backpacking that many people do not recognise, is that many only want to socialise with other western backpackers ? to have fun in a hot foreign place with your own kind. This is why places like this (Sudder Street) appear. Nobody would admit this kind of thing, but I think it is fundamentally true.?

 It is unlikely that Calcutta?s budget tourism industry will heave it?s rucksack-laden mass out of Sudder Street and into the wider city any time soon, and for the most superficial of reasons. There is no beach, and poverty is in your face, and not hushed out of sight. A serious working city such as Calcutta attracts those who are interested in its extraordinary history and wider Bengali culture.

Talk time

?Communication has always been a problem and will 

continue to be one for our children,? proclaimed Partha Pratim Mondal of Shyambazar 

AV School on Friday at a panel discussion organised by The Telegraph at 

Bengal Chamber of Commerce.

 Heads of institutions and senior staff of city schools met to discuss ?Role of educators in creating all-rounders for the future?. All those present contributed to the discussion. ?Orientation for teachers is very important, perhaps even more important than that for students,? felt Nupur Chatterjee, assistant mistress of Sakhawat Memorial Government Girls? High School.

 All the educators at the meeting agreed that the children from vernacular schools lacked confidence, though in most cases the children were academically brilliant.

 Saumendu Bikas Chattopadhyay, headmaster, Maharaja Cossimbazar Polytechnic Institution, said: ?Good children suffer from inferiority complexes when they are pitted against children from English-medium schools due to their lack of prowess in English.?

 Regarding all-round development of the students, almost all present believed there is no effort made by the schools as the environment does not support such activities.

 A. Rahman, assistant master, Ballygunge Government High School, felt: ?The system needs to be revamped as there is no focus on all-round development of the students.?

 Some others present at the meeting were Ashish Kumar Das of Maharaja Cossimbazar Polytechnic Institute, Suvra Mullick of Sakhawat Memorial Government Girls? High School and Lipika Gangopadhyay, headmistress, Victoria Institution.

 Beautiful spring

Where is the gentle breeze blowing?

 When are the flowers blooming?

 I can say in a sure voice

 That it is all in spring.

 When are the new leaves growing?

 When are the cuckoos singing?

 It is also true that these are

 All in spring.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tourist rape bail denied

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday rejected the bail petition of Shahid Iqbal, alias Raja, arrested in connection with the molestation and rape of a Japanese tourist.

 The bench, comprising Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Gupta, directed the state government to contact the victim through the Japanese consulate and ask her to come to Calcutta to depose before the court. 

 The judges also asked the chief metropolitan magistrate to expedite the trial.

 The victim, a resident of Tokyo, arrived in the city from Bodh Gaya, in Bihar, on July 4, 2004. She put up at a hotel on Elliot Road, where she met Raja. He introduced himself as a businessman from New Delhi.

 On July 18, the woman lodged a complaint with Park Street police station, alleging that Raja had molested her several times and raped her the day before. She also complained that he had forcibly taken $300 from her.

 Police arrested Raja the next day on the basis of the complaints. 

 ?Raja has been falsely implicated in the case. The woman alleged that he had molested her several times. Then why didn?t she approach the police before July 18?? questioned Jaimalya Bagchi and R.L. Chakraborty, Raja?s counsel, at the hearing. The public prosecutor assured the court of government help.

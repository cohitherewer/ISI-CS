 Dismissive of dengue dangers

Mohd Alamutullah Gazi: We have read in the newspapers that Tollygunge and its adjacent areas have been listed as dengue-prone zones. But the CMC has not taken any steps to control the disease. Can you tell us why the civic health department is so irresponsible?

 The Left Front civic body has no intention of saving the people in our borough. Our present mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, has argued that dengue is not a serious disease. Mayoral council member Subodh Dey, too, has said the same thing. In that case, why are people dying of dengue ? The civic body has not organised any awareness campaigns or health camps in our area. I printed posters and displayed them in Tollygunge to spread the word. A few local clubs have also helped us.

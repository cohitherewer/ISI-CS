 Hybrid and haute

 Fashion Police, the monthly fashion extravaganza at The Park, rolls on for its third edition this Friday. And club wear seems to be the genre of choice once again. After Jattinn Kocchars sizzling club wear and swim wear show last month, this Friday the Tantra bartop will host yet another club wear line, this time by Delhi-based designer Anju Modi.

 But this club wear line, contrary to its basic brief, promises to have a serious twist to it. Its a fun collection, but at the same time subtle and serious. I wanted to break free from the loud look that is associated with club wear, Anju tells GoodLife from Delhi. 

 She goes on to explain: These clothes are for people who look for meaningful evenings out where they have intelligent conversation, rather than just freaking out.

 The autumn-winter 2006-07 collection called Hybrid is an edited version of Anjus Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week 2006 (autumn-winter edition in April) line. 

 With an ivory-and-charcoal palette setting the sober mood, the clothes are digitally printed with rose motifs. An attempt to move away from shine and shimmer is reflected through minimal use of glitter. The silhouette scene revolves around skirts of various shapes ? short, knee-length, calf-length and balloons primarily ? teamed with wrap-tops, bandhgalas, angarakhas, coats, jackets, empire-line tops and more. There are some capris as well.

 The fabrics have been chosen keeping the Calcutta weather in mind. So, theres a dominance of absorbent cottons, chiffons and some lycra.

 Hybrid represents the new fashion culture of mixing influences from elements all over the world. Today, its very difficult to demarcate between eastern and western. Fashion has become a melting pot of various regional elements, explains the designer known for her passion for ethnic Indian craft forms.

 If Hybrid is all about combining regional influences, Anjus next collection ? to be unveiled at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week 2006 spring-summer edition in Delhi this August ? draws on regional poetry.

 I will be working with Bengali, Urdu, Persian and Devnagri poetry. I will translate some of the simple four-line poems into Hindi script and print them on the garments, reveals the designer who retails from 85 Lansdowne, Zenon and Ogaan in Calcutta.

 Tentatively called Poetic Expressions, the collection will be dominated by lycra ? tights, churidars, short kurtas, dresses with belts, capris, empire-line tops and more. The line will be displayed at Anjus stall at the event, as she has decided to give the ramp a miss this time. 

 On the eve of the Fashion Police 

 show in town, Anju will interact with her clients at 85 

 Lansdowne on Thursday evening.

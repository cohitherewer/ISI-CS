 A Polish concert was held in the city last Thursday to celebrate 50 years of Polands presence in India.

 The friendship between the two countries, however, goes back much earlier, to the times of Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first chairman of the Indo-Polish Friendship Association in India.

 Polish ambassador Krzysztof Majka, who was in town for the celebration, said: What better reason to be here than the cultural functions? I believe that by promoting culture... one can achieve progress in economy as well.

 Electricity and mining, he pointed out, were high on the list of areas that could see bilateral collaboration. There is demand for power in India and Poland has the expertise. We would also like to modernise the plants set up by us or by others through the modern technology available with us.

 Education is another area where the two countries can collaborate. A team of 25 rectors from several Polish colleges are coming to India on November 24. They will try and find out whether Indian students fit the Polish standards, he added.

 Majka himself did his doctorate from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and has spent almost 13 years in India.

 Also present on the occasion was R.S. Goenka, honorary consul of Poland in India and joint chairman of the Emami group.

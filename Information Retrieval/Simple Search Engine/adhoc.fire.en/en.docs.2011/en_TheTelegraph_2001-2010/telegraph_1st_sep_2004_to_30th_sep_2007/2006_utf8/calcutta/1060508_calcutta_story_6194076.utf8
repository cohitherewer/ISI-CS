 Car seized? Catch a cop zipping around in it

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Want to take a ride in someone else?s air-conditioned Tata Sumo or Ambassador in this scorching heat? Join Calcutta Police.

 Throwing rules to the winds, cops at the Lalbazar headquarters and several police stations in the city are using impounded vehicles ? most of them once used for crimes like dacoity, theft and extortion ? without obtaining the mandatory permission from court. 

 According to norms, impounded vehicles are to be kept at the police malkhana in Lalbazar and Hastings till the cases are disposed of in court. 

 If there are no claimants, they are auctioned off with court?s consent. 

 According to data available with police, two seized Sumos are being used by the motor theft section (assigned to recover stolen vehicles) and one by the detective department?s anti-rowdy section. 

 Several Ambassadors are being used by officers attached to police stations and more than 15 impounded motorcycles by traffic personnel. 

 Seeking to defend the practice, a senior IPS officer said: ?Because of a shortage of vehicles, we have no option but to use the impounded ones for maintaining law and order.? 

 Even that is illegal, he admitted. ?But in some cases, the owners request us to use their vehicles, so that they remain road-worthy. Vehicles turn into scrap if they are not driven for a long period,? he pointed out.

 ?In case of absence of claimants, we use the vehicles for patrolling and produce them in court whenever we are asked to. It?s definitely wrong if anyone uses an impounded vehicle for personal reasons,? he argued.

 Deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh and deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim refused comment, but joint commissioner (administration) Kuldiep Singh said: ?I will find out whether seized vehicles are being used by our men without the court?s consent. At times, we do use seized vehicles or their parts, but only after taking permission from court.? 

 Not just vehicles. More than 30 seized bicycles are being used by various police stations in the city. Each thana deploys two constables for bicycle patrolling at night.

 ?We have never bought bicycles for night patrolling. Most were seized from milkmen or people riding in no-cycling zones. Some, however, were donated by charitable organisations,? said an officer. 

 A senior officer was amused when questioned about the malpractice. ?Aisa Bihar aur UP police bhi karte hain (Bihar and UP police often use seized vehicles). What?s new about it??

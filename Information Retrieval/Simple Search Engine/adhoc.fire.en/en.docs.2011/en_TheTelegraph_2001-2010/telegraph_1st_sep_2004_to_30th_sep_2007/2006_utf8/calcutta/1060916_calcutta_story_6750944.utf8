The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 36 major leaks in waterline plugged

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If the new-look India Coffee House on CR Avenue had to declare a dry day and shut shop on Thursday, things limped back to normal in the second half of Friday, like the rest of the Sinthee-to-Bhowanipore belt crippled by the Tallah-Palta pipeline crisis.

 We only got water for half-an-hour during the day, said Gautam Kumar Roy at India Coffee House, adding that coffee was being served in paper cups to avoid washing and that Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials visiting the premises had assured normal supply from Saturday.

 The assurance held true for the rest of the water-starved parts of town, with CMC engineers plugging around 36 major leaks in the 100-year-old underground water mains, meeting 70 per cent of the citys requirement from Palta waterworks. The rest is supplied by the Garden Reach waterworks and deep tubewells.

 The pipeline near Indian Statistical Institute on BT Road sprang leaks late on Wednesday. Our engineers have plugged all the major leaks. Some minor leaks are being plugged now, Bibhas Maity, chief engineer of CMCs water supply department, said on Friday evening.

 The pipeline between Tallah and Palta was re-commissioned around 6 am, but it took around five more hours for the nine-million-gallon overhead reservoir at Tallah and the various booster stations to fill up and start supply. 

 The crisis lasted long enough for residents to stage protests (from Maniktala Main Road to Gariahat Road), for several state-run hospitals to push the panic button (from SSKM to Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar Medical College to Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital), for schools to struggle through classes (the afternoon session of the primary section of Patha Bhavan had to be called off), and for several restaurants and commercial establishments in north-central Calcutta to run at half-throttle.

 The civic board on Friday announced two schemes to avert such a crisis replace the old Palta-Tallah pipeline and lay a back-up pipeline between Palta-Tallah. 

 The estimated cost Rs 500 crore, to be met by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

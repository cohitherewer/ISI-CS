 Doctor?s bag found in field

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Wednesday claimed to have recovered the briefcase Jayanta Ghosh was carrying the day he was murdered. The body of the Salt Lake-based doctor was found on the morning of March 7, with its throat slit, dumped on a Murshidabad bridge.

 The blackish-brown briefcase was recovered from a field in Hatishal village, about a km from where the body was dumped. A writing pad, bearing the doctor?s name, his qualification and the address of his chamber, and a broken sphygmomanometer (the instrument for measuring blood pressure) were among the few things found in the briefcase. There was no stethoscope.

 ?The abductors discarded the briefcase to destroy evidence. The items found in it will be sent for forensic tests. The discovery is crucial for us,? said D.P. Tarenia, inspector-general of police (II), CID.

 Investigations have revealed that the car carrying the doctor had visited Sandarpur, in Murshidabad, on the night of March 6. According to local residents, the car made several rounds of the spot on the bridge over the Mayurakshi, where Ghosh?s body was dumped. ?That was between 8 and 8.30 pm on March 6,? Tarenia added.

 The residents also claimed to have seen a woman in the car. 

 On Wednesday, the sleuths grilled the owner of the STD booth in Kalyani, from where a call was made to Ghosh?s home hours after he was abducted.

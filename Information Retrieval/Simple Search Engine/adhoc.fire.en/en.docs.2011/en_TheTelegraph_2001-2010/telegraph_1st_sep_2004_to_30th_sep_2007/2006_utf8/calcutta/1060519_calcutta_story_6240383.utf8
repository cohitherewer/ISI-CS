The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Scoring neck and neck

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 When it comes to performance, Calcutta?s middle-order schools do not lag behind the top ones. 

 As in the better-known schools, particularly those run by the Christian missionaries, the number of students who scored 90 per cent and above in the ICSE and ISC examinations has considerably increased in the lesser-known schools of the city and elsewhere.

 ?Ours is an institution catering mostly to middle-class students from central and north Calcutta and Howrah as well. This year?s results are encouraging because many of our students have scored 90 per cent and above in a number of subjects. Our success rate is 100 per cent,? Gilian Rosemary Hart, principal, Welland Gouldsmith School said. 

 Over the past two decades, the number of ICSE and ISC schools in Calcutta and the districts has risen from 63 to 300. Officers of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations running the ICSE and ISC courses attributed the improved performance in lesser-known schools to the ?well-planned? syllabi structure followed by the Council and the ?scientific? method adopted by it to monitor students? progress.

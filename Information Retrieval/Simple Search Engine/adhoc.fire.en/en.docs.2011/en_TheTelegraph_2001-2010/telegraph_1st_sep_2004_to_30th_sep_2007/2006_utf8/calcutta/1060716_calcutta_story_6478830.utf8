 Party Time

 Sudeshna Banerjee 

 Italian consul-general 

 Agostino Pinna with friends at the Roxy bash

 What: Agostino Pinnas 

 party to celebrate Italys World Cup victory. 

 Where: Roxy at The Park.

 When: Thursday night. 

 The bash: Roxy was a packed 

 house as friends of the Italian consul-general joined in 

 the celebrations. The party address on Park Street resembled 

 a bit of Berlins Olympiastadion on Sunday night as 

 a special cake was cut amidst claps, cheers and champagne.

 The crowd was an eclectic mix 

 of diplomats and designers, artists and industrialists, 

 but all keen to kick-off soccer celebrations and raise a 

 toast to Cannavaro and Co. 

 Spotted: Gunter Wehrmann 

 (German consul-general), Vladimir Lazarov (Russian consul-general), 

 Nicolas Blasquez (director of the French embassy), Takenyuchi 

 (Japanese consul-general), Mekprayothong (Thai consul-general), 

 Martin Waelde (director, Max Mueller Bhavan), Suvaprasanna, 

 Agnimitra Paul, B.P. Poddar, Sishir Bajoria, Sundeep Bhutoria, 

 Karan Paul and a host of city models. 

 Sip n bite: 

 Free-flowing liquor, exotic cocktails and the best of wines 

 apart, the snacks served were named after the soccer stars 

 of the night. Sample these: Fabio Cannavaros Parmesan 

 Crusted Fish Fingers with Basil Pesto, Gianluigi Buffons 

 Olive, Caper Berries and Bellpepper Pizzette, Marco Materazzis 

 Chicken Bacon Sage Saltimbocca with Salsa Verde and Andrea 

 Pirlos Fungi with Spinach and Scamozarella with Salsa 

 Rosso. 

 Voiceover: It feels 

 very proud to have your country win, especially if you are 

 abroad. Celebrating with my friends in Calcutta is a special 

 occasion for me, smiled Agostino Pinna.

 Villain hero

 What: The French consul 

 in Calcuttas party to celebrate the National Day of 

 France. 

 Where: Hyatt Regency.

 When: July 14 (the day 

 of the fall of the Bastille).

 The bash: TV5 beamed the 

 march past direct from Champs Elyse?s, Paris, on the screen 

 put up in the Ballroom. Consul M.K. Jalan raised a toast 

 to the valiant showing by Les Bleus in Germany. The Bordeaux 

 2003 (red) and 2001 (white) flowed freely. A mini Eiffel 

 Tower in lights caressed the walls lit in muted red-white-and-blue.

 But away from the dais, the talking 

 point was Zinedine Zidane and what might have been. As Hyatts 

 general manager Timothy Bruce revealed, a contingency plan 

 was in place for the night, if only?

 Sip n bite: 

 French wine and cheese for the spirited ones. The famous 

 cordon bleu for those seeking solid French to bite into. 

 And a delectable range of pastries. And a lot of the usual, 

 of course.

 Voiceover: The party traditionally 

 is a meeting point of French students in town. Of the Lyonnaise 

 gang of Elise Depasquale, Marie Larcher, Marie Montet and 

 Frank Fourniol, while Frank questioned the technical authenticity 

 of the referee using video footage, Marie exempted Zidane 

 if Materazzi was ?si m?chant (so rude). Librarian 

 Elsa Champey was not sure the French would have made it 

 even if Zidane had stayed on. But Vive Zidane 

 was their unifying war cry.

 As for the local angle, chief 

 secretary Amit Kiran Deb was bitterly critical of the star, 

 while his Salt Lake neighbour P.K. Banerjee sympathised 

 with a moment of madness in the heat of the moment. Chess 

 grandmaster Dibyendu Barua felt Zizou had walked into a 

 trap, while Taslima Nasreen found a reflection of the patriarchal 

 mindset in the mother-sister fracas.

 Only actor Tapas Pal bayed for 

 more than a head-butt. Ma-er opoman bole katha! 

 Surely his mother would approve; or would she?

 The launch party 

 of Ego. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 

 Debut do

 What: Party to celebrate 

 the launch of Ego, the restobar and lounge.

 Where: Ego at The Peerless 

 Inn.

 When: Friday, 8 pm.

 The bash: Latest in the 

 list of restobars in the city, Ego opened its doors to Calcuttans 

 on Friday. On the opening night, the crowd comprised a mix 

 of designers and consular corps. DJ Arjun spun some lounge 

 tracks as well as some classics from the 60s and 70s as 

 the small dance floor drew many of the guests. Besides exotic 

 cocktails and mocktails, the menu boasted Chinese, Mexican, 

 Italian and Arabian delicacies.

 Voiceover: Given 

 its locational advantage and its ambience, Ego is the perfect 

 place to relax after a hard day or a lazy weekend, 

 said Nilanjan Kar, regional sales manager, The Peerless 

 Inn.

 What: 

 Opening of Kaafila. 

 Where: City Centre, Block 

 B, 3rd floor.

 When: October 20.

 Take a look: Imagine being welcomed with the traditional Afghan custom of Dastakhan or the washing of hands with fragrant rose water. 

 A lantern lights up your table set in the heart of Durri Bazaar, Suraahi Bazaar or Tasveer Bazaar as a sumptuous meal of kebabs, dal and naan awaits you.

 Spread over 2,500 sq ft, the ambience of Kaafila, the new restaurant at City Centre, lives up to its name that means caravan. 

 The 70-cover eatery replete with Afghan cultural topography is the brainchild of four Jaiswal friends Vivek, Abhishek, Mukesh and Anil who form VAMA Enterprises. All four feel that the ambience is the USP of the restaurant that serves Northwest Frontier cuisine.

 Skilfully divided into sections or bazaar, beautiful durries, suraahi or earthern pot, wall paintings, thick ropes and Afghan tiles recreate the traditional bazaar. 

 There are plans for a kids corner with portrait-sketching and story-telling. Hence the free space in the middle of the restaurant, said Abhishek. 

 Besides mocktails that are presently being served, we are looking at the possibility of a bar, he added. 

 The spread: Start with Shorba or soup. Try the kebabs, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The star dishes are Dal Pakhtooni and Kandahari Laham (mutton leg flambeed with whole spices and olive oil and served with a blue flame around it). 

 During winter, guests will be welcomed with Kawa, an Afghani green tea, and Bouranee, a traditional drink made of aged curd. 

 If you drop in with a large group, try the Khandaani Naan that serves 12 people. End on a sweet note with Phirni or ice-cream.

 Pocket pinch: While the vegetarian kebabs start from Rs 95, non-vegetarian main course dishes are priced between Rs 195 and Rs 675. The Khandaani Naan costs Rs 65.

 Kebab platter

 What: Grilled amp; Chilled.

 Where: Chowringhee Bar at The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Till October 28.

 The spread: Kebabs and beer have always made for a sizzling combo. Its no different here. 

 In the vegetarian section, try Tandoori Aloo Aur Gobhi (florets of cauliflower and baby potato spiked with chilli and carom seed), Paneer Aur Mutter Ki Tikki (green pea and cumin centred cottage cheese kebab cooked on the griddle) or Bharwan Shimla Mirch (Bellpepper filled with cottage cheese, potato, raisins and nuts, in a yoghurt marinade).

 In the non-vegetarian section, try Malai Machhli Tikka (tandoor cooked bekti, flavoured with fenugreek and raw mango powder), Lamb Tikka Kandahari (boneless lamb in a yoghurt and chilli marinade, flavoured with cardamom and raw mango powder) or Hara Sabja Murgh (half a spring chicken, marinated with green coriander, spinach and chilli).

 The show-stealers are Tandoori Khumb (cheese-filled mushroom cooked in the tandoor) and Dhaniya Coconut Chicken Tikka (morsels of chicken with coconut cream, curry leaf and black peppercorn marinade, glazed in the tandoor). You can team them with pints of chilled beer. 

 Pocket pinch: The kebabs are priced between Rs 350 and Rs 575.

 Voiceover: We believe 

 in giving something special to our regular clients also. 

 Thats the idea behind this promotion and the kebab-and-beer 

 combo has never failed, said executive chef George 

 K. George.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fish in tank to finish larvae 

 DEBASISH BISWAS, entomologist, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included Soma Basak, Dipti Bhattacharya, Srikumar Chattopadhyay, Rajasree Dasgupta, Sudipta Basak, Dhruba Nag, Bijon Kanti Das, Sushanta Pandit, Kajal Roy, Shyamal Debnath, Sandip Banerjee, Mou Basak, Nabin Chandra Mondol, Dipankar Bhattacharya and Krishna Basak.

Rajasree Dasgupta: Can fish in household tanks prevent breeding of mosquitoes?

 A World Health Organisation consultant had pointed out that household tanks and reservoirs are the main breeding grounds of the dengue causing mosquito ? Aedes aegypti. The consultant advised house-owners to release ornamental fish in the reservoirs or tanks so that they can eat up the larvae of the mosquitoes.

Dhruba Nag: Who will supply ornamental fish?

 You need not release ornamental fish in tanks. Fishes easily available in the market will serve the purpose.

Kajal Roy: Despite awareness campaigns by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), stacks of used tyres in garages, including those owned by the civic body and public vehicles department, have turned out to be breeding grounds of mosquitoes. 

 Mosquitoes breed in stacks of used-tyres in cities all over the world. During monsoon, we beef up surveillance in the garages, spray larvicide on accumulated water and serve notices on garages. We advise the owners to keep used tyres in a shed so that water cannot collect in the stacks. About 70 per cent of the people have responded positively to our counsel. The civic authorities are now contemplating harsh action against habitual offenders.

Sudipta Basak: Why does a mosquito bite itch?

 We have subcutaneous mast cells that are activated by the saliva of a mosquito to produce histamine, which causes the itching.

Dipti Bhattacharya: What action can you take if a house-owner refuses to let civic inspectors in or follow your advice on preventing the breeding of mosquitoes?

 Under the CMC Act, 1980, no house-owner can prevent a civic official from entering the premises for inspection. If a house-owner refuses to let an inspector in, he can report it to the civic medical officer. The civic authorities may file a case against the house-owner in the municipal magistrate?s court. 

Srikumar Chattopadhyay: When was Japanese Encephalitis first reported? Why isn?t it as prevalent in Calcutta as malaria or dengue?

 The disease was first reported in Japan in 1871 and in Vellore, India, in 1955. Encephalitis reached West Bengal in 1973. In Calcutta, classical dengue has been there for about 200 years. It has been a blessing in disguise for us. Our body develops an antibody following infection with dengue-causing virus. It provides some protection against encephalitis.

Sandip Banerjee: Will I be infected if a mosquito stings me soon after drawing blood from a man suffering from malaria? 

 No. Malaria parasite has a complex life cycle. You can be infected only if an Anopheles stephensi bites you at least 10 days after biting a man suffering from malaria. 

Srikumar Chattopadhyay: Where do the malaria-causing mosquitoes generally breed?

 After sucking blood, the malaria-causing mosquitoes rest for three days before laying eggs in clean water. While the dengue-causing mosquitoes prefer clean water in a dark place for laying eggs, their malaria-causing cousins prefer clean water exposed to sunlight.

Nabin Chandra Mondol: Is it a fact that mosquitoes breed in bushes?

 No. Mosquitoes need water to breed. Some species are fond of laying eggs on clean water. Mosquitoes use the bushes as their resting place. Most mosquitoes don?t carry germs of malaria or dengue.

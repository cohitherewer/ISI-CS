 It is a mixture of panic and caution that has prompted consumers to shy away from consuming chicken. From the feedback that we have been receiving from the food marts located across the city, it appears that consumers are not averse to consuming chicken. It is just that they want to tread the path of caution right now. Some people are eating chicken while some have stopped for the time being. It is very unfortunate for the industry. We just hope that consumers return to the markets and get their confidence back about chicken. Or else, the poultry industry would take its worst beating in recent history.

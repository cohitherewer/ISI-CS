 Father-son duo saved by cop 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Unable to bear the pangs of hunger, a father-son duo tried committing suicide but was saved by a Samaritan cop on Thursday afternoon. 

 According to police, Dulal Halder, in his mid 50s, and his eight-year-old son Anath, from Raidighi, in South 24-Parganas, jumped into the Dhakuria Lakes to end their lives. 

 The poor man and his son had been starving for the past few days. He said he was depressed and wanted to free himself from his acute poverty, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 Dulal left his ancestral village of Domkol, 70 km from the city, early on Thursday, telling his neighbours that his son wanted to see Viswakarma puja in Calcutta. 

 After reaching Calcutta, he came to the Lakes to commit suicide. Our police patrol noticed the father and son and were keeping an eye on them. Initially, our officers thought that like other morning-walker, Halder was taking the air with his son, Kumar added.

 It was around 1.30 pm when sub-inspector Biplab Chakraborty saw Dulal jump into the water with his son. 

 At once, he dived into the water and rescued both. They were rushed to MR Bangur Hospital for first-aid, said an officer of Lake police station.

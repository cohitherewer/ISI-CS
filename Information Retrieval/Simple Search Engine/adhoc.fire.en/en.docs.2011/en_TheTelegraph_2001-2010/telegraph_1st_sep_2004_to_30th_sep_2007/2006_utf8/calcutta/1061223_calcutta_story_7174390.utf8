 Recovery agents drive off with car

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three loan recovery agents of a private bank intercepted the car of an alleged defaulter, dragged him and his driver out and drove the vehicle away with Rs 50,000 inside.

 And all this happened in broad daylight around 7.30 am on Friday at the crossing of Lenin Sarani and Moti Sil Street.

 Following a complaint by the car-owner, Manas Mukherjee, a resident of Mahatma Gandhi Road, police have launched a search for the trio. 

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) P.K. Chatterjee said Mukherjee had bought a Maruti 800 (WB-02 6727) after taking a loan from the bank about nine months ago. He, however, allegedly failed in paying back the monthly instalments. 

 We spoke to bank officials and they admitted that the car was seized by their recovery agents. The vehicle was found at the banks garage in Beniapukur, Chatterjee said.

 Shift order: Calcutta High Court on Friday ordered the traders at College Street market to shift to Marcus Square to facilitate construction of the book mall, Barnaparichay. 

 The College Street Market Dealers Association had filed a petition against the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in the first week of December, expressing its reluctance to move to Marcus Square.

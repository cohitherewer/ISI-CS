The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 Get through this week without ...

 Hosting a rain dance

 Music, masti and monsoon? and a rain dance to link 

 them all. Chiffon saris or pedal pushers, backless blouses 

 or Superman tees, go bare feet and romance the rain, sans 

 make-up and mobiles of course. Bring on the sprinklers, 

 in case the rain gods decide to play hide-and-seek. All 

 for a long uninterrupted dose of fun without the sun. 

 Catching Pirates 2

 Jack Sparrow is back and back in style. Get your dose of 

 Johnny Depp as he returns to explore the Dead Mans 

 Chest with Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom in tow. 

 Director Gore Verbinski helms the sequel to the massively 

 successful Pirates of the Caribbean and lays the 

 foundation for the third part featuring the creepy Davy 

 Jones, a squid, a crab and a man rolled into one. You even 

 stand to win gold and silver coins along with masks, eye 

 patches, bandanas and keychains at the special Pirates 

 promotion in INOX (Forum and City Centre).

 Rustling up hilsa recipes

 Dishing out grandmas old books, surfing the Internet 

 or catch up on every cookery show on TV ? beg, borrow or 

 steal good ol hilsa recipes from just about anywhere. 

 Pick up recipes of old favourites like the Shorshe Ilish 

 and Ilish Paturi or surprise everybody with some Continental 

 innovations. Getting the recipe right is just the beginning 

 of the fish fiesta. Organise a cook-in and celebrate the 

 seasons flavour. Hail hilsa!

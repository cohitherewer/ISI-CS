 Stands in stations for state buses

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 If Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) has its way, commuters will soon be able to take a bus home from the premises of Howrah, Sealdah, Chitpur and Santragachhi railway stations.

 The company has requested the state government to initiate discussions with the railway authorities to grant it exclusive rights to ply buses from the four stations. 

 ?We have requested the government to treat the matter as a special case so that a large number of commuters can avail of bus services from the stations,? said CTC managing director P.K. Chattopadhyay.

 CTC is buying 70 new buses at a cost of Rs 7.3 crore and hopes to ply them in this sector. ?We have ordered 15 new buses to operate from the stations. Once we get the nod, we will ply more buses on the station routes,? added Chattopadhyay.

 CTC is also seeking land from the railway authorities to build bus stands inside the stations.

 ?In Chennai, private buses are not permitted to ply from the railway stations. The government policy in this regard is very clear. But here, the government buses are put at a disadvantage,? felt a transport department official.

 The CTC currently operates 275 buses, while 55 more are awaiting repairs.

 ?The buses we ply from the stations are old and breakdowns are frequent. The number of buses are not sufficient to service Howrah and Sealdah stations, where footfall has gone up by a lakh each over the past couple of years,? stated a CTC official. 

 ?It?s a good proposal. We will take it up with the railway authorities. In future, it might even be possible to work out a ticket adjustment with them. Such a system is in vogue abroad. The commuters pay only once and take a bus from the station itself,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury. 

 However, it might not be smooth sailing for CTC. ?Tickets in CTC buses are costlier. If it starts concentrating on Howrah and Sealdah stations, which are on our most lucrative routes, our revenues will fall,? pointed out Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Friendly ghosts and gentle angels

 - PAINTER, PRINT-MAKER amp; POET

 A Sanat Kar work reproduced from the book on him

 Following in the footsteps of their counterparts in Delhi and Mumbai, major Calcutta galleries have started bringing out books on artists. This is a welcome sign, for the artists of this region are notorious for their reluctance to maintain a proper record of their work, and more often than not, do not even possess transparencies or digitised versions of their past work that they themselves may need as references.

 Publishing houses, too, have become more interested in artists and their oeuvre. The boom in the Indian contemporary art market is certainly one of the reasons behind this enthusiasm but it augurs well for Bengal artists. 

 One has to wait for the rare exhibition where the works of major artists of the past can be seen. Otherwise it is impossible.

 The latest such book on an individual artist has been published by Gallery ArtsIndia, New York, and Akar Prakar, which, young as it is (it opened in 2003) has already organised some significant exhibitions where the talents of young artists have been highlighted, and also a seminar on print-making. The gallery?s latest offering is a well-produced book on Sanat Kar of Santiniketan and focuses on his practice as a painter, print-maker and poet, an aspect on which little is known.

 Sanat Kar?s best-known images of myriad Casper-like figures, wide-eyed with awe, angels and other spectral beings in clear blues, olive and in darker shades may strike one as being saccharine-sweet and sentimental. But that will only be at the expense of missing their gentle sense of humour that allows the artist, born in 1935, to turn this ?friendly ghost? (as the cartoon strip character is described) into crockery and jars and vases and cushion covers with eyes and hands popping out of their surfaces. (Series Ikebana)

 His earlier etchings, such as Faces and Head II, with their grids and grainy surfaces, were more strongly structured and contemplative, although they contain the seeds of Kar?s later work with clearly delineated faces. These were mostly monochromatic works and some of them had the quality of sculpture. The works date back to the early 60s, when he was the art teacher of a well-known school in Taltala, before he joined Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan.

 All these qualities of Sanat Kar the artist have been dealt with in-depth in essays by art historians such as Pranabranjan Ray and R. Siva Kumar. The latter, in particular, has written in detail about Sanat Kar?s prints and the sensibility that went into their making.

 ?The feeling and sensibility expressed in these prints, though not their technique and imagery, connects him with his predecessors of the Bengal School, especially someone like Kshitindranath Majumdar,? writes Siva Kumar.

 Such incisive pieces and the wealth of well-reproduced and laid out illustrations have increased the worth of this book. There is an entire section on Sanat Kar?s poetry in manuscript, along with translations and drawings. The poems express quite simple sentiments and observations on life, and, for once, the translations maintain this tone.

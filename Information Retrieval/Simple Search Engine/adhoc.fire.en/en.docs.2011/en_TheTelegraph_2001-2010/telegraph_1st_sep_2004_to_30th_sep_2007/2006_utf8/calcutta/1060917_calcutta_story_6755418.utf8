The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Formula 3 for 

 festivity

 When it comes to Durga puja success, 

 some organisers keep faith in tradition, some log on to technology 

 and a few continue to bet on a new gimmick

 Tradition tribute 

 On August 15, when the rest of 

 Calcutta was busy hoisting the Tricolour, residents in a 

 corner of Haridevpur had gathered to pray along with the 

 priest for the success of their neighbourhood puja, Vivekananda 

 Sporting Club Sarbojanin. This is the first time we are 

 doing a bhoomi puja, said secretary Apurba Chanda, 

 visibly tense.

 The stakes are high. In an area 

 that has come up as the latest hotbed of theme-based puja, 

 every alley springs up new surprises and competition is 

 cut-throat. Vivekananda Sporting is investing in 12,000 

 turbans being stitched in far-away Jaipur where theme-maker 

 Debashish Bhattacharya would soon be camping.

 So the priest is going by the 

 book an hour-and-a-half of worship followed by three hours 

 of hom. The procedures are identical to that of 

 bhit puja at the start of construction of a house, 

 says Ashok Bhattacharya, wiping the beads of sweat on his 

 forehead with his holy thread. Bhit puja is the nearest 

 approximation as the framers of the ritual rules could not 

 foresee the need for bhoomi puja for a pandal.

 Around the same time, elsewhere, 

 off Rashbehari Avenue, priests are signing up for classes 

 to perfect their trade. The training camp for priests worshipping 

 Durga and Kali, organised by publishers of the Gupta Press 

 almanac, has drawn a full house in its debut edition. Their 

 punctuations are wrong, their methodology faulty, and they 

 do not have much idea about purification of the offerings 

 and the objects to be used for worship, Pranabeshwar Smrititirtha, 

 professor at Shri Sitaram Vaidik Mahavidyalaya, bristles 

 with indignation on being asked why its time for priests 

 to enter the classroom.

 A talk with the students revealed 

 that though most had come on a self-improvement mission, 

 some puja organisers in the city are actually getting suspicious. 

 Some big-ticket pujas are even favouring priests carrying 

 certificates.

 The first batch of priests will 

 get their certificate at a convocation in Kala Mandir on 

 Monday.

 Technology twist

 Exactly a month later, on September 

 14, Abasar Sarbojanin, a little-known puja on Townshend 

 Road, is trying to make it to the popularity charts. In 

 its 56th year, it is hosting a press conference at The Saturday 

 Club, where a short film is being screened to explain its 

 focus this year sand sculpture.

 Our secretary Shyamal Nath Das 

 did the shoot on the Puri beach and at our pandal. A visual 

 representation has an immediate impact, says Chanchal Ghosh, 

 a puja committee member, about the publicity ploy of the 

 Rs 7-lakh puja.

 Putiary Club, down deep south, 

 is planning a similar screening on the making of its decorations, 

 using reeds in Bankura, on a giant screen at its pandal.

 Modern-day puja organisation needs 

 such make-up tools to face up to the spotlight. Many pujas 

 these days have done away with the sheaf of papers in a 

 fat file tucked under the arm of an organiser hunting for 

 sponsors. A PowerPoint presentation looks slicker. It adds 

 sheen to our image, smiles Sumanta Roy, president of Jodhpur 

 Park Sarbojanin.

 The presentation must have the 

 history, list of awards, details of earlier deals, contacts, 

 as well as photographs of earlier pujas. All that becomes 

 costly to print.

 So, turning to technology works 

 just fine. It is easy to find a member with a scanner and 

 a computer at home. While each colour printout costs at 

 least Rs 5, burning it all on a CD costs barely Rs 10 for 

 each extra copy. It is also easier to preserve, Roy explains.

 Piety today is easier to package 

 on a portal. A website does carry weight in the eyes of 

 corporate sponsors. But the effort is aimed mainly at our 

 former neighbours, now abroad, who want to stay involved, 

 says Partha Sarathi Pathak of 66 Palli Sarbojanin which 

 floated its site three months ago and plans to update it 

 every Puja night. These NRI neighbours also pitch in generously 

 with donations.

 Shibmandir launched its portal 

 this Independence Day. NRIs also help us with contacts 

 for sponsorships, says Partho Ghosh who has spent about 

 Rs 8,000 so far on www.shibmandir.com. Big pujas 

 on the other side of town, like Dum Dum Tarun Sangha, also 

 have e-presence. 

 But technology, as always, is 

 creating a divide in devotee ranks. We could not afford 

 the Rs 20,000 estimate that was handed to us when we went 

 to get a website designed, rues Rana Dasgupta of Lake Pally 

 Sarbojanin, Santoshpur, adding that portal pages attract 

 advertisers.

 Gimmicks galore

 Novelty is the calling card for 

 pujas that use the unlikeliest of items to pull in the crowds. 

 This years bizarre offerings include nails (Haridevpur 

 Adarsha Samity), sweet corn (Dharmatala Netaji Sporting 

 Club in Kasba), buttons (Kailash Bose Street, Chaltabagan) 

 and pearls (Dhakuria Uttarpalli Kalupara).

 We went to Hyderabad in 2003. 

 Since then, we have been trying to implement this idea, 

 said Rana Basu, an organiser of the pearl puja off Sarat 

 Ghosh Garden Road. The pearls are coming from Puri, where 

 they cost one-fifth of what they do here, reveals theme-maker 

 Maichel Bose. His students are busy pasting the sparkling 

 white gems on Jamini Roy works painted anew and then printed 

 digitally. A private security agency is being employed to 

 guard what visitors could want to pluck.

 But they better stay off the pearly 

 white sweet corns adorning pandal in neighbouring Kasba. 

 Every part of the maize is being put to use after being 

 treated with chemicals. While the raw corns are forming 

 the Devis ornaments and sari border, the hairy coat is 

 to be the hair. Burnt to a charcoal black, the skin is being 

 used for a variation of colour on the decorative panels. 

 We have used up 8,500 bhuttas, says club member 

 Sanjoy Das.

 At Chaltabagan up north, a crore 

 of buttons will be sealing the Puja fate of Kailash Bose 

 Street Sarbojanin. We are using shirt buttons to depict 

 the glory of Shiva. His tiger skin, for instance, has yellow 

 buttons punctuated by black ones, says joint secretary 

 Gopal De. 

 If these seem outlandish, Sanjoy 

 Das has an explanation: We are small pujas with no sponsors 

 to back us up for big themes or elaborate lighting. Rousing 

 curiosity is our only means to attract people.

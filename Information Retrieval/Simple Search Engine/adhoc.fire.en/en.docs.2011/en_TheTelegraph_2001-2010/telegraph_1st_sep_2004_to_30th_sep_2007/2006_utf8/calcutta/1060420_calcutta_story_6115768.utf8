 Mapping consumer mindset

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Market surveys for long have been taken to be the index for consumer behaviour and practices. But their accuracy has always been debatable. 

 To correct this anomaly, Eastern Institute of Management (EIM) organised Maxeim, a daylong session on marketing simulators, at Bengal Club on Tuesday. Students, parents and others took part.

 Both research and theme displays, along with fun elements, were part of the event, organised to provide a unique experience, combining the rigours of market research with the excitement of an amusement park. 

 ?In traditional market survey models, the responses are quite stereotyped and often misleading. Maxeim is a simulation of how a consumer arrives at a decision, with inputs of the fun element,? said Amit Sen Gupta, director, EIM.

 The four-year-old institute, which conducts a full-time MBA programme with University of Kalyani, tied up with cellphone service provider Hutch and consumer durable company Berger Paints to test their theories and analyses.

 Participants had to undergo a number of exercises structured to elicit unbiased and accurate information. The projects were attempts at tracking consumer preferences and perceptions regarding the products on display.

 ?This is actually a method of studying consumer behaviour and improving on market research. We are creating a situation for the consumer and observing his or her physical behaviour, rather than verbal responses,? explained Sen Gupta.

 The focus of the exercise was on analysing consumer likes and dislikes, price indices, product features and product development. ?We also try and track the demographics of different consumer strata, as well as find out when would be the best time for a particular product to enter a new or emerging market,? stated Sushmit Mitra, faculty, EIM. 

 EIM plans to collect the relevant raw data and do a statistical analysis before handing it over to Hutch and Berger Paints.

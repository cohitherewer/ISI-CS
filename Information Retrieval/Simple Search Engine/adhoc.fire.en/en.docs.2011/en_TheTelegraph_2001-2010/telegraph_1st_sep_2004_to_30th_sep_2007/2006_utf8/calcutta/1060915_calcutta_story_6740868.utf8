 What: 

 A panel discussion on Say Alvida To Marriage. 

 Where: Calcutta Swimming Club (CSC).

 When: Tuesday afternoon.

 Listen in: Ladies at the club met over coffee to voice their views at an hour-long debate on marriage, moderated by Rita Bhimani. Panelists included Kishore Bhimani, advertising and theatre personality Arthur Cardozo and film-maker Anindita Sarbadhicari.

 The session kicked off with Anindita voting for single parenthood. I would rather not be a part of something where vows are taken and signatures made for a man to pass on his name and assets to his GeneratioNext. Love should be the only ingredient to bind a relationship.

 Kishore was crisp and witty. Will you not eat for fear of indigestion? Have you stopped your soft drinks for fear of pesticides? So why say alvida to marriage? Arthur picked up the baton. The US has so many divorces everyday. Is it not because there is too much space? What is space? Who defines it? If compatibility is ensured, one will never regret marriage. 

 A lady from the audience added: We need to get away from the restrictions of old, traditional marriages. A couple should structure their marriage, not social norms. The two should decide their own parameters.

 Live-in relationships and extra-martial affairs were discussed. Finally, when Rita asked how many believed in not saying alvida to marriage, most hands were up.

 Voiceover: We all watched Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and formed various opinions about marriage. So we thought why not have a debate on the issue, said Sarika Todi, first lady, CSC.

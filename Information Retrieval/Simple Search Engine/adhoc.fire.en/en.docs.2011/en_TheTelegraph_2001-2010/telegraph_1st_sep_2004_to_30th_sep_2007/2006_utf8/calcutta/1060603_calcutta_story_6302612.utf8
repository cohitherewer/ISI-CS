The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Numbers back with tally tales

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The spell of math-magic that started with this years ICSE-ISC results and ran through the CBSE performance, swept away the Madhyamik examinees, too, to a record success.

 A staggering 372 students from the city have scored a ton in compulsory mathematics, against 77 last year, and 65 in additional mathematics. From the entire state, 525 examinees have scored 100 in compulsory mathematics.

 Gopa Basu, deputy secretary (examinations) of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said one reason for the spectacular success in mathematics was the fact that the question paper was easy. 

 Its true that the number of century-scorers is more in the city than the entire state, but the overall performance in the subject across Bengal is good, she added.

 A teacher of South Point School, Amal Bhowmick, attributes the success to an increasing awareness about the subject among students in city schools. Mathematics is an important subject and along with schools, parents must also encourage children to practise sums from an early age. Fortunately, Calcutta parents have understood this.

 Analysing the results, a teacher in a girls school in Bhowanipore said parents are goading students to practise mathematics from the primary level as they want their wards to study engineering after Plus II.

 Another reason for the success of Calcutta students, compared with those from the districts, is the availability of better tuition facilities, she said.

 Bibhas Guha, a senior teacher of a school in south Calcutta, however, feels the primary reason for the success in mathematics was the recent changes in the question and assessment patterns.

 The trend of Calcutta emerging as the city of number-loving students emerged with the publication of the results of the ICSE-ISC exams, conducted by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations. It was vindicated when the Central Board of Secondary Board of Secondary Education announced its Class X results.

What: A chocolate workshop as part of The Stadel 

Poorna Annapurna Workshop series.

 Where: Lords, the banquet hall at The Stadel.

 When: Saturday morning.

 The workshop: Be it demonstrations of lip-smacking global cuisine, tempting desserts or exquisite flower arrangements, the Poorna Annapurna workshops blend fun with facts. The chocolate workshop this Saturday, presided over by chocolate and pastry expert from the Netherlands Harry Mercur, was no different. 

 About 57 participants ? trained chefs, homemakers and enthusiastic youngsters ? witnessed the wonders one could do with chocolate.

 The interactive session had the cheerful 58-year-old showcasing chocolate delicacies like chocolate filled with Ganache, along with a host of useful tips on the importance of proper temperature and ways of stirring. A pretty butterfly, an archaic swan ? the host of chocolate decorations left the audience spellbound. 

 Harry, an ambassador for premium chocolate brand Barry Callebaut of Belgium, also had other interesting decor ideas up his sleeves. Balloons with the ends dipped in chocolate and a leaf coated with chocolate were left to dry for a while. When the balloons were burst and the leaf taken off, out came a beautiful chocolate basket and a longish chocolate leaf.

 Voiceover: Workshops like these help women to know chocolate better and work with it with greater ease. To make wonders with this eternal favourite, you have to have the time to play around with it and be a romantic enough to create marvels out of it, said Harry, who has a book on pastries and a cooking show for children on television to his credit.

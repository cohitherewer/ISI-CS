Air-conditioned auditorium, fresh equipment, cafeteria and a sparkling look. Though on a much smaller scale than Star or Minerva, Bijon Theatre, in Hatibagan, is poised for a turnaround.

 Four city-based theatre groups have come together to resuscitate the languishing stage address on Raja Rajkrishna Street that has hosted Soumitra Chatterjees Chandanpurer Chor and Subhendu Chatterjees Bilkis Begum.

 Sayak, Anya Theatre, Theatre Workshop and Shohan have formed Samabay Prayash and raised Rs 40 lakh for the revival project, to be carried out in two phases.

 The committee comprises theatre veterans Meghnad Bhattacharya of Sayak, Bibhas Chakraborty of Anya Theatre and Ashok Mukhopadhyay of Theatre Workshop.

 Our aim is to provide comfort to theatre-goers by renovating the hall, says Anish Ghosh, director of Shohan and assistant general secretary of Samabay Prayash.

 The revamped 516-seater auditorium will have air-conditioning equipment, cushioned seats, modern lighting and sound gear.

 Plans include widening the narrow entrance, setting up a cafeteria and constructing toilets. Bijon Theatre will be shut down from March 2007 for the work.

 We have been wanting to revamp Bijon for long but couldnt do so for lack of funds. We will start work right after winter as a number of theatre festivals are held in December-January, says Meghnad Bhattacharya, who expects the government to provide help from the MPs Local Area Development Fund. 

 The committee has roped in architect Hiren Chowdhury of Pace Consultants to steer the renovation project. Chowdhury will help redesign some portions of the hall, apart from planning the project. The hall will reopen in the winter of 2007 and then shut down for the second phase of work. It should be ready by end-2008, assures Ghosh.

 Bijon Theatre was set up in 1979 by Sayak to promote group theatre as well as professional productions. It was named after theatre stalwart Bijon Bhattacharya.

 The property, owned by Nataraj Enterprise, was taken on lease by Samabay Prayash for 10 years in 2004.

 Film stars were the main draw in theatre para, especially for those living in the suburbs, who would flock here to catch a glimpse of their favourite actors. But the popularity waned when the actors started touring the interiors of Bengal, explains Bhattacharya, management executive of Bijon Theatre.

 Sayak teamed up with the other three groups in 2002 to sustain Bijon Theatre. Now, the north Calcutta address will get a new look and a fresh lease of life.

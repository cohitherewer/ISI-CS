 The Indian bride might no longer be romancing a 50-metre ghagra as in the bygone era of royalty, but Indian exoticism remains the key word in bridal drapes even today. With the winter-spring wedding season kicking off with its own set of fashion rules, antiquity is in the air.

 There is a certain going back to tradition in bridal drapes this season. While the last few seasons saw a lot of Indian and western blends, this season the focus is on Indian traditions, says couture queen Ritu Kumar.

 So, crystals and sequins have made way for metallic embroidery in antique finish, gota and zardosi work. Motifs like paisleys and butis have taken over, replacing happy florals. While the mermaid cut was popular for a while, this season brides are going back to classic cuts.

 The palette now is a riot of reds, reds and more reds. The shades vary from vermilion to wine to burgundy. A new twist in the colour tale is the use of contrast lehngas and churnis.

 While the D-Day demands red, for the pre-wedding functions like mehndi and sangeet, pastels like peaches and olives are ruling. For these functions, one can also go for western cuts like halter cholis and fish-cut lehngas, adds Ritu.

 For the GoodLife shoot, the veteran designer has draped model Sanjukta in three distinctive lehngas. The right top one is for the pre-wedding functions; the others present two different looks for the big day.

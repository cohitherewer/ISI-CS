The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 5reasons to live at the plexes this summer

 We?re all going on a summer holiday, 

 No more working for a week or two? We?ve all seen it in the 

 movies, Now let?s see if it?s true? Cliff Richard comes 

 alive with a difference, as the city prepares to spend its 

 summer holidays at the movies. The midsummer movie madness 

 set in with the first day of May recording the highest ever 

 footfall at a single multiplex in the city (5,950 at INOX-Forum). 

 With big stars, bigger blockbusters and a world much larger 

 than life awaiting viewers, Pratim D. Gupta picks 

 the prime pull factors at the plexes this season

 THE 

 DA VINCI CODE 

 Release: 

 May 19. 

 Reason: 

 Ok, you find Tom Hanks?s hairstyle just not right 

 for the charismatic Robert Langdon and Audrey Tatou too 

 baby-faced for the stylish Sophie Neveu, but can you possibly 

 afford to give Ron Howard?s adaptation of the Dan Brown 

 bestseller a miss? The Da Vinci Code not only marks 

 the coming together of Howard and Hanks after Apollo 

 13, but also has scriptwriter Akiva Goldsman and Howard 

 teaming up after A Beautiful Mind.

 You have a fortnight to flip through the book and be coded. 

 Countdown 

 quote: ?I was in Louvre in Paris a couple of 

 weeks back and I found almost everybody had a copy of The 

 Da Vinci Code in hand as they took a tour of the museum. 

 The book is so ridiculously popular that the movie is a 

 must watch everywhere. I can?t wait for the familiar pages 

 to unfold on celluloid? ? singer-musician Neel Dutt. 

 FANAA 

 Release: 

 May 26.

 Reason: 

 Almost a couple of decades after they exploded on the Bollywood 

 big screen, Aamir Khan and Kajol are finally allowed to 

 romance, and that too on a Yash Chopra canvas, under the 

 keen production eyes of Aditya Chopra, and with the mintfresh 

 treatment of Kunal Hum Tum Kohli. Add to it Jatin-Lalit?s 

 final score and Ravi K. Chandran?s lush lenswork and you 

 are ready to be ?destroyed in love?. Also, there?s always 

 the hidden temptation to compare comeback Kajol?s visually-challenged 

 act with cousin Rani?s blind show in Black.

 Countdown 

 quote: ?The first time pairing of Aamir and Kajol 

 makes Fanaa very interesting. Aamir always is very 

 good with his selection of films and there?s the added attraction 

 of Kajol?s return. Since this is also Jatin-Lalit?s last 

 work, I am very keen to check out what they churn out as 

 their swansong? ? actor-musician Bikram Ghosh.

 KRRISH 

 Release: 

 A Friday in June.

 Reason: 

 The bulging biceps, the lightyear leaps, the magnetic 

 moves are back. And this time, there?s a mask, which is 

 a cross between Amitabh Bachchan?s Ajooba and Halle 

 Berry?s Catwoman. As the international trailers would 

 announce: This summer, from the maker of Kaho Naa? Pyaar 

 Hai and Koi? Mil Gaya comes yet another musical 

 blockbuster. The father-son duo of Rakesh and Hrithik Roshan 

 would love to score a hattrick as they use up Rs 50 crore 

 to scale the Singapore skyscrapers ? miraculous escape and 

 all.

 Countdown 

 quote: ?My son (Shivendra, 11) is eagerly awaiting 

 the release of Krrish since he completely went berserk 

 after watching Koi? Mil Gaya. He made me buy him 

 all the film?s merchandise including Jadoo and, of course, 

 the DVD when it released. He would watch it time and again 

 and even cry copiously at some points in the movie. To be 

 honest, I am looking forward to the movie, too. From whatever 

 I have seen in the promos, Hrithik?s new hairstyle is looking 

 amazing? ? actress June. 

 SUPERMAN 

 RETURNS 

 Release: 

 June 30.

 Reason: 

 You didn?t expect some hunk from Iowa seen in forgettable 

 TV soaps like Undressed and One Life To Live to 

 actually edge past heartthrobs like Ashton Kutcher and Brendan 

 Fraser to don Christopher Reeve?s celebrated blue body suit, 

 red cape and undies. But then, in his new avatar, meant 

 to be the first in a fresh trilogy, Brandon Routh as Clark 

 Kent is not confined to the crumpled pages of DC Comics, 

 and gets more real. The real attraction, though, could be 

 Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor under the watchful eyes of his 

 Usual Suspects director Bryan Singer.

 Countdown 

 quote: ?The combination of the red and blue colours 

 of Superman has over the years represented sheer force and 

 has also been used by big brands like Pepsi. The appearance 

 is really bright and catchy and is every child?s dream combo. 

 Then you have the red briefs he wears outside the pants, 

 which might be obscene for a normal man but with Superman 

 wearing it, is absolutely fantastic... The character overshadows 

 everything? ? designer Agnimitra Paul.

 PLUS...

 If the blockbusters don?t lure you, perhaps the freebies will. If you are watching a film at Fame (Hiland Park) in the next couple of months, a simple quiz contest can win you a couple of holiday packages in South Africa and five within Indian boundaries.

 At the other end of the EM Bypass, 89 Cinemas is going for lowered ticket rates to woo more footfalls. ?We are also drastically bringing down our membership card rates that is sure to boost the summer occupancies,? says vice-president Prashant Shrivastava.

 It makes sense to hard-sell at the plexes this summer, if the seasonal figures of the city?s most popular plex are anything to go by. Over the last two years, INOX (Forum) has registered the highest footfalls in the summer months. If May and June pulled in 60 and 70 per cent occupancy in 2004, the same months drew 61 and 73 per cent in 2005 and this year, with the figures already rising in April, the Elgin Road multiplex is eyeing an occupancy high of 75.

 The heat really is on, on the screen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 HALF-YEAR HITS

 Two Aamirs and two comedies, a pint 

 of patriotism and a toast to a gangster ? the first half of 

 2006 had it all as Bollywood struck a purple patch. Here?s 

 a flashback to the favourite five in city cinemas

 1Film: 

 Rang De Basanti

 Starring: Aamir Khan, Alice Patten, Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan

 Hit highlights: ?Zindagi jeene ke do hi tareeke hain? Ek jo ho raha hai hone do, bardaasht karte raho? Ya zimmedari uthao use badalne ki?? 

 Once DJ and gang took up that responsibility, patriotism got a new name and a blockbuster was born. Adopting a topical theme of corruption and plane crash, Rang De looked at the bigger picture of how only the youth can make a country perfect. Writer-director Rakeysh Mehra had promised: ?You?ll surely come out of the halls thinking.?

 The film was fun, provoked thought 

 and marked the return of A.R. Rahman to his best. Aye 

 saala... 

 2 Film: 

 Fanaa 

 Starring: Aamir Khan, Kajol

 Hit highlights: When you pair two of the biggest stars for the first time (one making a comeback after five years and the other riding the Rang De wave), have one of them kill the other at the end and yet register record business, you know you have done something right.

 Director Kunal Kohli wisely dedicated the first half of what is essentially a thriller to the romance of Rehaan Qadri and Zooni Ali Beg.

 And how can you possibly not respond 

 to Aamir whispering to a gorgeous-looking Kajol, ?Hai 

 jo seene mein qaid dariya woh chhoot jayega? Hai itna dard 

 ki tera daman bheeg jayega???

 3 Film: 

 Phir Hera Pheri 

 Starring: Paresh Rawal, Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty, Bipasha Basu, Rimii

 Hit highlights: Successful sequels were alien to Bollywood till Raju, Shyam and Babubhai returned. A new director, a new storyline and new heroines meant new interest in the franchise. Director Neeraj Vora?s promise of PHP being ?twice better than the first? didn?t fall flat as audiences kept rolling in the aisles, laughing. 

 While action stars Akshay and Suniel raised a few laughs, it was Paresh Rawal with his thick lens and hunchback gait that did the trick yet again. His big question was: ?Phir hera pheri karne ka ki nahin karne ka?? The answer? A resounding yes, loud enough for Vora and company to plan the next episode in the lives of these three men in a chawl.

 4 Film: 

 Malamaal Weekly 

 Starring: Paresh Rawal, Om Puri, Riteish, Rajpal Yadav, Reema Sen

 Hit highlights: No regular hero-heroine, no running around trees, not even the slow-mo dhishum-dhishum, yet Priyadarshan?s ?most realistic comedy? was able to piggyback on two of the best actors on Indian screen to become the first surprise hit of the year.

 Between them, Paresh Rawal and Om Puri made the screen come alive with some remarkable repartees and clean humour. In an age of Bachchans and Khans, to score with Puri and Paresh is, as a Sidhuism would go, as big as the face of Dhoni?s bat (not after the Windies washout, though).

 5 

 Film: Gangster 

 Starring: Shiney Ahuja, Emraan Hashmi, Kangna

 Hit highlights: Take four 

 chartbusters, dice in one great debut, stir in a typical 

 Bhatt controversy and mix one specialist kisser and, voila, 

 you have another sleeper hit from Vishesh Films. Shiney 

 Ahuja made Abu Salem (if at all) his very own as he scampered 

 through the streets of Seoul with a rugged vulnerability. 

 With a bag-full of medicines and chemotherapy sessions to 

 contend with, writer-director Anurag Basu waved the ?Bengalis 

 in Bollywood? baton yet again.

 fast forward: JULY-DEC

 Krrish

 Starring: Hrithik 

 Roshan, Priyanka Chopra, Naseeruddin Shah

 Why: One week old, Indias first 

 superhero has what it takes to emerge as one of the big 

 hits of the year. Completing his hit hat-trick with director 

 papa Rakesh Roshan, Hrithik will return later on the other 

 side of the law in Dhoom 2

 Omkara

 Starring: Ajay Devgan, Saif Ali Khan, 

 Viveik Oberoi, Kareena Kapoor, Konkona Sen Sharma, Bipasha 

 Basu, Naseeruddin Shah

 Why: Director Vishal Bhardwajs understanding 

 of Shakespeare and his ability to place the Bards 

 boys in todays India makes this Othello adaptation 

 irresistible. Maqbool might have lost out on stars, but 

 Omkara has all the right people to impress the crowd and 

 the connoisseur

 Salaam-e-Ishq

 Starring: Salman Khan, John Abraham, 

 Anil Kapoor, Govinda, Akshaye Khanna, Priyanka Chopra, Vidya 

 Balan, Ayesha Takia, Juhi Chawla, Perizaad Zorabian

 Why: Kal Ho Naa Ho director Nikhil Advani 

 seems best suited to handle the desi version of Love Actually 

 with a star cast good enough to be an industry on its own. 

 Plus, music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy

 Don 

 Starring: Shah Rukh Khan, Priyanka Chopra, 

 Arjun Rampal

 Why: The Farhan Akhtar-Shah Rukh combo 

 is an exciting prospect by itself and when you have them 

 trying to remake the Big B classic, theres no reason 

 why two generations wont turn up to watch the double 

 act from King Khan. Plus, Kareena doing a Helen with Yeh 

 mera dil.

 KABHI ALVIDA NAA KEHNA

 Starring: Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukherjee, 

 Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta, Amitabh Bachchan

 Why: If theres one film that cant 

 go wrong then this is it. Not only should it break domestic 

 box-office records, Karan Johars latest magnum opus 

 should topple his K3G mark abroad too

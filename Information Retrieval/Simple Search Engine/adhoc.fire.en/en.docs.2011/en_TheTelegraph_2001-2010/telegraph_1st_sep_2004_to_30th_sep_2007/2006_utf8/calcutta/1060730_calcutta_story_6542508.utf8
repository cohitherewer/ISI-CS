The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bolly and beyond

 After hitting the shores of Mumbai, Rituparna Sengupta is now on board an international project as well. The Tollywood star has signed her first English film, Hidden, and will catch a flight to Malaysia for the first round of shooting in mid-August.

 The suspense thriller with a supernatural slant stars Rituparna in the role of a divorcee with a son who travels from India to the US to be with her American boyfriend.

 Hidden is being produced in collaboration with Mumbai-based music director Tabun and a film production company headquartered in New Jersey. The film will be shot largely in London, and also in Malaysia and Mumbai. 

 ?The film is about the emotional bonding between a mother and son. The kid dies mysteriously and his soul comes back to connect with her,? says Samit, the film?s director, from Mumbai. His debut film in Hindi called Jack, featuring Shayaji Shinde, will release in September.

 ?This will be my first English film and I am very excited. My character is a sitar player who has a relationship with a US-based novelist called Walter. She has a son who goes missing one day and the film is about what happens then,? Rituparna said from Mumbai, where she was busy shooting for Saab Chai Pani?.

 The shoot schedule for Hidden starts from August 11, but before that the Tollywood actress is squeezing in a three-day shoot for a music video. Paired with Ashmit Patel, Rituparna will be seen in one of the Hindi versions of three Tagore songs in the music video. The other two tracks have Jackie Shroff-Manisha Koirala, and Anuj Shawney-Riya Sen.

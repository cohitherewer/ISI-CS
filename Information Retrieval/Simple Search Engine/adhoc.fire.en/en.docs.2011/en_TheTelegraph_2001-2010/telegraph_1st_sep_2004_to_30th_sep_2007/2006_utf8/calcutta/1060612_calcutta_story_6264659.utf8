The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Motorist at risk on fixed roads

 - Wheels skid as new mastic asphalt top coat turns slippery after shower

 KINSUK BASU

 New roads, risky roads. If this sounds strange, check the traffic police records. Roads recently repaired are proving to be the most treacherous for wheels to grip.

 The reason is two-fold: a shower 

 leaves the new mastic asphalt top coat oily and slippery, 

 setting it up for a skid; while the ditches, dug for repairs 

 and never filled, catch the motorists off guard. 

 The risky Stretches

 Near St Georges? Gate, beside Jubilee Lines Army Quarters, 

 off Vidyasagar Setu, which has been covered with mastic 

 asphalt

 On a Saturday afternoon recently, at least three cars skidded on the downward slope of the Setu, lost control and overturned. A motorcyclist and a driver were injured in similar mishaps a few days earlier.

 ?The stretch becomes slippery after a shower. We?ve informed the authorities, but no action has been taken. It seems the repair has done more harm than good,? remarked a Vidyasagar Setu Traffic Guard officer.

 APC Road, near Moulali, and CIT Road, from Moulali to 

 Park Circus 

 This stretch, too, was done up with mastic asphalt. According to the traffic cops on duty, many vehicles are skidding on the oily surface. A drizzle magnifies the problem. 

 The 

 northern slope of Sealdah flyover and Creek Row 

 Not only is the surface oily, the stones embedded in it have disappeared. 

 ?We voiced our concerns at a meeting with the Lalbazar top brass. The matter has been raised with the agencies concerned, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the HRBC. Nothing has come of it yet,? said a senior officer of Sealdah Traffic Guard. 

 Between Girish Park and Mahatma Gandhi Road, on CR Avenue 

 This stretch is turning out to be dangerous for two-wheelers, once again owing to slippery mastic asphalt cover.

 ?The situation is so bad that at times, we ask the CMC not to wash the road in the morning,? said an officer of Jorabagan Traffic Guard. 

 Red Road, in front of Mohammedan Sporting Ground

 Recently, a taxi travelling at high speed skidded and inadvertently made a U-turn, minutes before the chief minister?s convoy passed by. Mastic asphalt, yet again, is the culprit. 

 BT Road, near Cossipore police station

 Like several other roads that have been dug up for repairs, this stretch, too, has an open pit. On May 11, 36-year-old Someshwar Mukhia died after the driver of a van lost control while failing to negotiate the crater.

 What can be done

 ?There is no denying that on certain 

 stretches, the mastic asphalt cover is posing a threat to 

 speeding vehicles. We have raised the issue with the PWD, 

 but in vain. All we can do is put up speedbreakers,? said 

 Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic). 

 The civic officials claim the onus of fixing the problem lies with HRBC, which in turn passes the buck to the contractors.

 Expert opinion

 ?Bitumen has to be mixed with 

 lime and stone in a cooker machine at 170-180 degrees Celsius. 

 Besides, each stone has to be embedded more than 15 mm deep 

 on the asphalt layer,? stated P.K. Dhua, deputy chief engineer 

 (roads), CMC.

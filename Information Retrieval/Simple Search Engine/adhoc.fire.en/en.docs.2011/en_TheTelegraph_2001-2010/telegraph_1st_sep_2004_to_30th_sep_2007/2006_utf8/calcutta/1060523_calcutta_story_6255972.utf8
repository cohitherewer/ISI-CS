 Informer network in the forests

 - Dubbed wildlife movies for spreading awareness

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The forest department is busy setting up its own criminal network, with a chain of informers leading to poachers and every kind of illegal trade in wildlife. Starting from Tuesday, the wildlife wing of the state forest department will begin screening of wildlife films at various correctional homes across the state.

 ?This is our first attempt. We have got permission from inspector-general of police (prisons) B.D. Sharma to screen wildlife films by the Bedi brothers and Ashish Chandola at the Dum Dum Correctional Home on May 23 from 10 am to 4 pm,? said Vinod Kumar Yadav, deputy chief wildlife warden. 

 He added that the forest department had acquired special permission from some wildlife film-makers to dub their films in Bengali. 

 The movies to be screened are Saving the Tiger, Cherub of the Mist, Lord of the Jungle and Living with Giant. While Saving the Tiger, directed by the Bedi brothers, focuses on the tigers of the Sunderbans and Kanha, Cherub of the Mist deals with the rehabilitation of captive Red Pandas and Lord of the Jungle is about elephants. Chandola?s film Living with the Giant is also based on elephant conservation. 

 ?These films were shown on television and at different film festivals, but because they were in English, they couldn?t reach the masses. So, we have dubbed them,? explained Yadav. 

 But why this screening for a literally captive audience? The inmates of correctional homes may be guilty of urban crimes like drugs, fraud or robbery, but all of them are aware of wildlife crime and may even have links with some of the poachers and traders. With rewards up to Rs 10,000, the department hopes to net in more informers, explained Yadav.

 Over the years, the forest department has realised that sensitisation is of utmost importance. And the only way to operate successfully is to collaborate ?with everyone from the BSF, railway patrol, customs, district police, coast guards to various NGOs?. Involving local people has also proved fruitful because they always recognise the poachers, who are generally outsiders.

 ?The department has tightened vigilance, started training and awareness campaigns. In the last few years, some 15 to 20 poachers have laid down arms and turned informers and protectors. And this was possible not just because of the rewards, but also because of the environmental awareness. Watching these dubbed films, many inhabitants have joined the self-help patrolling groups. Nowadays, many children in the Sunderbans have not seen the tigers, many don?t know the value of the mangrove forest they live in?. these films will help them know the surroundings,? explained Yadav. 

 The forest department will follow up Tuesday?s screening with others at Alipore Correctional Home and the districts.

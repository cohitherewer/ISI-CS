 Pedestrian Ram Krishna Kundu, 28, was critically injured after being hit by a speeding two-seater Fiat at Gol Park on Wednesday afternoon. A packet containing Rs 3.3 lakh was found on the spot.

 The red convertible (GJ13A319) knocked down Kundu from behind while he was trying to cross the road around 2.30 pm, said officer-in-charge of Gariahat police station Dulal Chakraborty. 

 The money was in a plastic packet. We are not sure if Kundu was carrying the packet or it was hurled out of the the car, added Chakraborty. 

 Kundu sustained serious injuries on his head and chest. He was rushed unconscious to AMRI Hospitals.

 The man behind the wheel, identified as Aditya Roychowdhury, was beaten up by a crowd that had gathered on the spot. He was rescued by a traffic sergeant and two constables, who took him to Apollo Hospital.

 The car was travelling at about 80 kph when the driver lost control and hit Kundu, said an officer. 

 According to police, Kundu lives in Bagha Jatin. He works in a private firm and was on his way home at the time of the accident. He had a diary in his pocket. It helped us contact his family, said the officer. 

 The convertible, not new but well-maintained, was taken to the police station.

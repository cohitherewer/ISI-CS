The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Encroach cry back in high court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Tapas Bhanja, an advocate of Calcutta High Court, on Friday moved a division bench alleging that the civic authorities and police had failed to honour an order of the court on evicting hawkers from the footpaths of eight key roads in the central business district.

 The lawyer mentioned before the bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar that the Supreme Court, in a ruling a week ago, had declared encroachments on footpaths ?illegal?. 

 He also alleged that police were not executing the court?s order on traffic management. 

 Last month, Metro had carried a series of reports on footpaths overrun by hawkers and their wares. This had followed mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya?s assurance that hawkers would be allowed to return to some pavements.

 But the high court had earlier appointed a committee to scan the thoroughfares where hawkers were not only inconveniencing pedestrians, but also contributing to traffic congestion.

 Bhanja?s plea was posted for hearing on May 19.

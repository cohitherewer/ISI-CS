 White wows in Friday fashion

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Pret 

 Power

 Whites, whites and more whites; 

 multiple layers of flowing fabrics; trademark full-bodied 

 gypsy skirts just a sneak peek into the fairly international 

 pret collection by design ace Ritu Kumar that will be splashed 

 on the Tantra bartop this Friday midnight.

 The fourth edition of Fashion 

 Police, the monthly style affair from The Park, promises 

 to be the biggest extravaganza of the series so far. Not 

 only will it see the Calcutta launch of Ritus fall-winter 

 2006-07 line, the ramp will witness some of the hottest 

 models of the country Deepika Padukone (seen sporting 

 an outfit from the line in picture), Shruti Agarwal, Jesse 

 Randhawa, Sohini Jaitley, Amanpreet Wahi, Krishna Somani 

 and Tina Chatwal parading the clothes.

 The line is part of my Label 

 collection. The look is contemporary, young and international. 

 It has a fun twist to it, Ritu told GoodLife 

 from Delhi.

 A major part of the line 

 is in white and off-white. The colour story then moves on 

 to black with a range of cocktail wear, and finally there 

 are gypsy skirts in vibrant vegetable colours, elaborated 

 the veteran designer with roots in Calcutta.

 The mood is vintage, with traditional 

 Indian elements in stylish, contemporary silhouettes. I 

 have used all natural fabrics like crepe and crinkled cotton. 

 Ive also extensively used crochet and lace, 

 she added. 

 A highlight of the line is the 

 use of multiple fabrics to create a distressed look, and 

 fabric treatments to lend a frayed and crushed feel.

 The casual party collection 

 is an edited version of the line Ritu showcased at the Wills 

 Lifestyle India Fashion Week (fall-winter) edition in Delhi 

 in April. I was looking for an opportunity to bring 

 my fashion week collection to Calcutta. And the Fashion 

 Police show is an excellent opportunity. The collection 

 will retail from my store at Forum following the show, 

 she said.

 The star designer, however, will 

 be missing from the ramp at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion 

 Week (spring-summer) to be held later this month. 

 I will only take up a stall 

 at the trade area of the fashion week. A show wont 

 be possible this time because I am showing at a pret-a-porter 

 fair in Paris on the same dates. I have been participating 

 in this fair for quite sometime now and dont want 

 to miss it, revealed Ritu.

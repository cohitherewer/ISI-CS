 Stay fit this festive season

 - Doctors advise against physical and gastronomical strain

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Pandal-hopping is not just fun. It involves a lot of physical and gastronomical strain, with many falling ill after a hectic four-day revelry regimen.

 City doctors have come out with precautions and prescriptions to help the Puja crowd stay fit through the festive season.

 We get a number of patients during and after the Puja with intestinal infection, acidity, diarrhoea and other problems, said Mahesh Goenka, consultant gastroenterologist, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. To stay fit, one should definitely avoid fast food, particularly late at night. These roadside delicacies corrode ones digestive system, he pointed out.

 The docs things to do: resist the temptation of rolls and phuchkas, avoid oily food and drink plenty of water. It is also important to make up for the lack of sleep at night. One must sleep six to eight hours in the day.

 Doctors have also warned against popping too many antacid pills. Those with cardiac problems should be extra careful. Almost every year after the Puja, our Intensive Cardiac Care Unit is full of patients, said Anil Mishra, medical director, BM Birla Heart Research Institute. Those with ischaemia and other cardiac ailments should not walk for long this Puja. The crowd can cause suffocation, added Mishra.

 With 40 per cent of the heart patients in Calcutta being diabetic, doctors have warned against irregular diet. Staying on a empty stomach for long can cause the blood sugar level to fall. A diabetic must carry snacks and munch at regular intervals, a doctor said.

 Sanjay Ghosh, medical director, Institute of Allergic and Immunologic Skin Diseases, said those with dye allergy must get new clothes, specially coloured ones, washed first.

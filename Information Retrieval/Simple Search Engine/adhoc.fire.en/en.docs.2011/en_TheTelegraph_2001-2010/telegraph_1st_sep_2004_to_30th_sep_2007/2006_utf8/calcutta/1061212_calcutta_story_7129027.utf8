 Power to GeneratioNext

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam charmed 

 with ease at the closing ceremony of the 150-year celebrations 

 of Calcutta Girls High School held at the Science City 

 auditorium on December 6. In the city for a host of events, 

 he took out time to release a commemorative volume compiled 

 by the school.

 Attired in a grey bandhgala, 

 trademark locks in place, President Kalam addressed the 

 audience with characteristic verve, taking questions from 

 students on politics, human cloning and womens rights. 

 Speaking about the need to educate the girl child, he remarked: 

 Forty eight per cent of our countrys population comprises 

 women. I hope that the Womens Reservation Bill will change 

 the status of women in the country.

 He also stressed on the imperative 

 need of the youth to participate in the political process. 

 He referred to what the schools student council president 

 Ketaki Mukhopadhyay told him before he took the stage: She 

 said that she wanted to be a political leader to remove 

 corruption in politics. The youth will have to play an active 

 role in politics if there is to be progress. They are the 

 ones who bring dynamic energy into any field. 

 Distinguishing developmental politics, 

 which focuses on development of the nation, from political 

 politics, which is all about winning seats in Parliament, 

 he said: The nation is bigger than political parties. One 

 should not spend more than 30 per cent of ones time on 

 the latter.

 Kalam responded to Class XII student 

 Sana Abduls poser about the difficulty of working women 

 in balancing home and workplace with customary panache: 

 The child will have to be the primary focus. He recalled 

 his own childhood in a joint family where a relative would 

 take care of a child in the absence of the parent. In a 

 nuclear family, either of the parents must stay at home 

 to take responsibility for the child. 

 The clash between technology and 

 environmental pollution was also brought up by a student. 

 We can prevent pollution by switching over to solar, bio 

 and nuclear power to fulfil our energy requirements, he 

 replied.

 As the teeming sea of students 

 filed out of the auditorium towards the buses waiting to 

 take them back to school, Reshmi Dutta, a student of Class 

 IX, gushed: Meeting President Kalam is a once-in a-lifetime 

 thing. I loved interacting with him and hope that he comes 

 to our school some day.

 The Diary

 Lost times

 I had her in my arms one day,

 Today in my grave I lie, 

 Sleepless and unworthy of the pleasure, 

 Of reminiscing the moments of games we played at leisure,

 Of times when we had been together, 

 A daughter and her father

 What had she said when she had, 

 for the first time, learnt to speak? 

 Do I remember her first laugh, cry or squeak? 

 Do I know what she had felt, when for the first time, her 

 hand I had held?

 I remember nothing but the times we fought, 

 Of the times in anger I had been overwrought, 

 Imposing my wills on my little child, 

 Indifferent to her tears that had turned her so wild. 

 Oh, How I wish to snatch away 

 moments from the pocket of time,

 Some forgotten giggles of her childhood, 

 Some lost twinkles of her eyes and turn into blossoms all 

 her pensive sighs.

 I do not know if flowers to my grave she brings, 

 Those unspent moments of togetherness I so dearly crave, 

 As I lie silent and reminiscing 

 in my cold and lonely grave.

 Anindita Bhattacharya, Class 

 XII, Carmel High School

 Of the unknown

 The dusky chill of the morrow,

 Brings along tidings of sorrow,

 The lint fails to weave 

 The chasm of grief. 

 Asunder the cliffs lie,

 Weary deaths the mournings die.

 Will the thunder not strike 

 The miscreant hike?

 Prongs of wilderness

 Pierce the winds 

 And when attempted to solve; 

 These mystic scuffles dissolve.

 Fest finale

 Curtains came down on Sona Chandi 

 The Great TTIS Challenge with a flourish on December 

 9. Youngsters started pouring into the Swabhumi courtyard 

 right from 6 pm to catch a show by Pakistani band Jal.

 Ranadeep Das of St Pauls Mission 

 School had turned up despite his ICSE exams knocking at 

 the door. The Enrique and Eminem enthusiast said: I havent 

 heard the band before, so just wanted to check them out.

 Soon the line-up of Farhan Saeed, 

 Gohar Mumtaz and Shazi had the crowd on its feet and singing 

 along. Budhaditya Acharya of Don Bosco Park Circus had only 

 one word for them, awesome, before adding that his favourite 

 was Farhan.

 The band belted out one popular 

 hit after another including favourites Aadat Si Ho Gayi 

 Hai and their signature number Woh Lamhe. Nothing 

 was too much to see for the youngsters who were standing 

 on anything available, from tables to ledges of shop windows 

 to catch a glimpse of it all.

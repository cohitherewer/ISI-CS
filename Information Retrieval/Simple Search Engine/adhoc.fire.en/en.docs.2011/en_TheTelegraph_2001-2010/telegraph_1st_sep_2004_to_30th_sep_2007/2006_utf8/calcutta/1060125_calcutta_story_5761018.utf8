What: Southern Spices, a south Indian food 

festival.

 Where: Saffron, the Indian speciality restaurant at The Park.

 When: Between January 27 and February 12.

 The menu: An assorted mix of tastes that picks the best of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Chettinad cuisine forms the basic flavour of this food extravaganza. 

 A great start to the meal is Attu Kal Soup (mutton paya) while vegetarians can opt for Melagu Rasam (pepper soup). Starters like Palakai Adduppil (kathal sheek), Era Suttadu (tandoori prawn) and Pomfret Porichadu (fried pomfret) provide ample choice before you can move on to an extensive main course. 

 Keerai Massial (five type saag) and Veg Kootu (mixed vegetables) are recommended in the vegetarian section, while non-vegetarians can order Kohzi Korma with Idi Appam or the Era Thukku (prawn curry). The Paruppu Podi Sadam (gun powder rice) and the Keerai Roti (saag roti) are great accompaniments. For desserts, try the traditional Arsi Pal Payasam (rice and coconut kheer).

 Pocket pinch: The a la carte dishes are priced between Rs 65 and Rs 665.

 Voiceover: South Indian cuisine is basically non-greasy, either boiled or steamed and hence is very light on the stomach, explained chef Vasanthi. 

 Spanish fare

 What: Spanish food festival.

 Where: Marco Polo at 205, Sarat Bose Road.

 When: January 25 to February 5.

 The menu: For starters you can pick Gambas Al Ajillo (garlic scampi) or Brochetas de Almeria (marinated chicken skewers). The salad section offers interesting combinations and you can choose Arros a la Marinera (rice and seafood salad) or the Ensalada de Naranja (orange salad). Bogavante a la Gallega (pan-cooked lobster), Txangurro (stuffed crab), Tumbet (baked eggplant) and Olla Gitana (gipsy stew) are good picks for the main course.

 A perfect finale is the Melocotones con Vino (peaches in wine) or the Flao (cheese flan). All the delicacies have been researched and whipped up by executive chef Amitabho Chakraborty. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices vary between Rs 95 and Rs 525. 

 Voiceover: We try and introduce Calcutta to a new cuisine every year. Last year it was Greek food and this year, keeping in mind the theme for the Book Fair, we decided to host a Spanish food festival, explained Kallol Banerjee, manager of Marco Polo.

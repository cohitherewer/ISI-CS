 The SFI strike on Monday to protest the violence on the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) campus, that had led to the death of a student, evoked a mixed response in Calcutta. 

 All exams, however, were held on schedule.

 Soumik Basu, a third-year student of electrical engineering, suffered a severe injury after falling off the second floor of a Besu hostel on Wednesday. He had been on a life-support system for three days and died on Saturday.

 Prominent English-medium schools and private engineering colleges functioned as usual but attendance at state-aided institutions was thin, almost nil on some campuses.

 It was a normal working day in our college. Classes were held as usual, said Satyajit Chakraborty, director, Institute of Engineering and Management (IEM), a private institute in Salt Lake.

 Principal Debabrata Choudhury of Asutosh College said classes remained suspended through the day. Not a single class could be held, as student attendance was almost zero.

 The response was partial at Presidency College and the engineering faculty of Jadavpur University, where the students unions are controlled by apolitical bodies. A number of classes were held at both the institutions, though the students turned out in much lesser numbers.

 Teacher attendance was normal, but full-day classes could not be held as the student turnout was thin in some departments, said Presidency College principal Mamata Roy Chowdhury.

 At Jadavpur University, there was tension when SFI supporters allegedly forced some students of the arts faculty to wear black badges and asked them not to attend classes. The situation was brought under control after senior leaders intervened. Classes were also held in the universitys engineering faculty. 

 On the Besu campus, where classes were suspended, SFI members organised a silent march. Anirban Biswas, general secretary of the SFI-supported Postgraduate Students Union, said: In the name of running an apolitical union, the Independent Consolidation (IC) is resorting to hooliganism. This must be stopped. 

 General secretary of the IC-backed BE College Students Union Soumya Souvik Hati alleged: Not a single undergraduate took part in the march. The SFI gathered students from other schools and colleges to fill the ranks.

 Chhatra Parishad and Youth Congress activists, led by former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, held a demonstration in front of Besu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Accident, says viscera report

 - Youth 

 died in friend's car of suffocation 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

The viscera report of Deepesh Singh, 18, who was found unconscious in a parked Opel Astra in New Alipore on the night of October 4 and was later pronounced dead, suggests that the death was accidental, caused by suffocation.

 We have received the preliminary viscera report from the forensic science laboratory and it is negative. It suggests that the death was accidental, assistant commissioner of police (south) Sanjib Kumar Ghosh told Metro on Sunday.

 The viscera report will be sent to the doctor who had conducted the post-mortem on Deepeshs body and the final report will be prepared by him. After that, we will take experts opinion to ascertain the cause of death, Ghosh said.

 The post-mortem had revealed traces of brown liquid in the teenagers stomach, leading police to suspect that an overdose of alcohol and drugs had caused the death. As of now, it seems the death was caused by inhaling carbon monoxide from the exhaust pipe which had somehow found its way into the car, said an officer of Alipore police station.

 Ajoy Kumar, deputy commissioner (south), said: The death was not due to poisoning, as we had suspected.

 Beside Deepesh in the car was 

 an unconscious Sohail Chaudhury, 18, (in picture) in 

 the drivers seat. He told police after regaining senses 

 that he had called Deepesh on his mobile phone around 12.35 

 am on October 4.

 Deepesh was asleep in his paan shop on Diamond Harbour Road, in front of Alipore Mint. Sohail left his New Alipore flat in Block G in his Opel Astra and reached the shop around 1.30 am. He woke up Deepesh and took a pack of cigarettes from him. They waited for Suraj, who turned up after 15 minutes.

 All three got into the car, Deepesh sitting next to Sohail and Suraj, who works in a local garage, in the rear seat. Sohail drove to Park Street, where they dropped in at a friends house. 

 They left after half-an-hour and went to Camac Street, where they bought mineral water bottles and some snacks. After visiting Park Circus and Ballygunge, they headed back home.

 Suraj got off near the mint around 4.15 am, saying he would join them soon. Sohail parked the car in the garage on the ground floor of his three-storeyed apartment block and remained inside with Deepesh. I was feeling dizzy and fell unconscious. I do not know what happened after that, Sohail had told police.

 Deepeshs father Arun, however, had lodged a complaint of foul play, alleging that Sohail had borrowed Rs 50,000 from his son and and failed to return it.

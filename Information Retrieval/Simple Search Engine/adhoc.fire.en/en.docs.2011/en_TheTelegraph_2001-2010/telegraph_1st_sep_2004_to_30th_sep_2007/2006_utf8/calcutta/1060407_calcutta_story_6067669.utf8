 Spate of mishaps

 A STAFF REPORTER

 One person was killed and two others were injured in a string of accidents in the past 24 hours in Calcutta.

 Mohammad Jaan, in his mid-20s, was knocked down by an unidentified vehicle while he was cycling down Mayo Road on Wednesday night. 

 A police patrol team noticed Jaan, a resident of Ekbalpore Road, lying on the road, bleeding from wounds in the head. He was rushed to SSKM Hospital.

 ?Doctors tried their best to save Jaan?s life, but he died around midnight,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 In another mishap, Samir Roy, driving a private car, was injured when the vehicle hit the CR Avenue divider in the Jorasanko area early on Thursday. ?He was admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he is under observation. The vehicle has been brought to the local police station,? said an officer of the traffic department.

 In a third mishap, 60-year-old Vijay Bahadur Pandit was injured when the two-wheeler he was riding collided with a taxi at the Gariahat Road-Garcha Road crossing. 

 Pandit has been admitted to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, where his condition was stated to be stable.

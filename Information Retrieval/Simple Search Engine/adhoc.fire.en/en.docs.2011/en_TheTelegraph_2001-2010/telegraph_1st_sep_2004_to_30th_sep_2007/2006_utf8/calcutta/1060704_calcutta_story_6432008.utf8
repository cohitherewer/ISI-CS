 Lakshmi Mittal is now the world?s biggest steel tycoon, and if the efforts of a Calcutta-based catalyst agency bear fruit, he might well be able to offload a substantial chunk of his produce in India soon.

 The Institute for Steel Development amp; Growth (Insdag), a non-profit-making member-based organisation established by the Union government in the city and supported by major steel producers of the country, is delving into young minds for imaginative design solutions.

 Insdag?s annual student competition for the best innovative use of steel in architecture is aimed at creating interest among students of architecture in using steel as a medium of architectural expression and in exploiting the numerous advantages of structural steel as a material of construction.

 The theme of this year?s (2005-06) competition is a ?world-class permanent trade fair complex? in Calcutta. ?This is a part of our industry-university interface. The main objective is to create awareness among the students on the high potential of structural steel,? R.K. Singh, director-general of Insdag, tells Metro. India?s per capita steel consumption is a poor 35 kg against a world average of 160 kg.

 The competition is open to all first to fifth-year architecture students from any AICTE-approved university/school of architecture in the country. Entries are ranked and screened by four zonal selection committees. The best four entries from each zone make the final round, being judged by the central selection panel.

 The top five entries receive the awards, which will be handed over at the Kennedy Hall, Institute of Jute Technology, on Ballygunge Circular Road, this Thursday. The first prize carries a cash award of Rs 30,000, a scroll of honour and a certificate.

 ?We had sent out brochures to 117 institutes for this year?s competition. While there were 192 proposals or expressions of interest, actual entries came to 92. Students can participate only in groups with a maximum of four members to a team,? says Debashis Datta, manager (civil amp; structural), Insdag.

 The competition is a ?wonderful vehicle to tap fresh minds? and use their imagination to drive home the various virtues of structural steel, feels Manju Haldar, head of the department of architecture, Bengal Engineering and Science University, and zonal coordinator (east) for the competition.

 ?The institute primarily works towards creating awareness on advantages and advances in cost-effective usage of steel application among potential users, providing steel-usage technology/design aids, teaching aids, upgrading skills/knowhow?,? says T.K. Bandyopadhyay, joint director-general of Insdag.

 Senior city architect Gopal Mitra, who will be chief guest at the awards ceremony, is confident this awareness-building is happening through the contest. 

 ?No other material can match the potential of steel in terms of versatility, which is most eloquently expressed in all contemporary airports. The response to this competition has been most encouraging and the live projects the students have to do as part of it are bringing them closer to the end-users all the time,? says Mitra.

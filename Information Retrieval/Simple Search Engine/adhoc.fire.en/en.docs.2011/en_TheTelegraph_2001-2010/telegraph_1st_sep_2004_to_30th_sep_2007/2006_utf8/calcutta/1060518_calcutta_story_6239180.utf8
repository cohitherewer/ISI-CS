 Black and Rang De Basanti 

 came to Nandan, but after running their course at the multiplexes. 

 The Da Vinci Code will not have to play the waiting 

 game ? its first day, first show at Nandan (picture of ongoing 

 renovation work by Aranya Sen) will coincide with the film?s 

 release in other city halls.

 The state-backed auditorium is gearing up to grab a chunky pie of the screen profit from the Dan Brown thriller ? whenever its gets the official green signal from Delhi, that is ? and advance booking queries are pouring in anticipating a Friday the 19th release.

 ?The film is based on a popular work of fiction and there?s a huge craze for it. So we wanted to release it and I think we will run full houses,? Nandan CEO Nilanjan Chatterjee told Metro just before the information and broadcasting ministry stepped in and threw the release date of the Code into jeopardy.

 Releasing big films at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s favourite cultural hotspot means big business for distributors. ?We had released War of the Worlds at Nandan and the profit share was substantially higher than the multiplexes. So, it makes great business sense to release a film like The Da Vinci Code in Nandan. The multiplexes and other standalone theatres will do better in the first week due to the higher ticket rates, but Nandan will give stronger collections in the long run,? explained Arijit Dutta, distributor of Code in the eastern region, who was approached by Nandan for the film?s simultaneous release.

 But Nandan?s tussle seems to be more with itself than with the multiplexes. It wants to boost its revenue stream with popular entertainment and at the same time retain its identity as the epicentre of serious film culture in the city.

 To start with, Nandan shed its image of being an intellectual citadel by allowing a slow but steady flow of popular films since last year. Black, Iqbal, War of the Worlds, Rang De Basanti and The Chronicles of Narnia have given business worth a crore. Black fared a little better than Rang De Basanti but both films have done well enough for Nandan to feel its on the right track. At Nandan I, a film runs for four weeks on an average and is extended depending on viewer response.

 ?The revenue that Nandan has given to the government in terms of amusement tax is Rs 1.38 crore between 2005-06, while the earning in 2004-05 was Rs 8.95 lakh,? said Chatterjee. ?Multiplexes are for people who can afford ticket prices starting from Rs 150. We are looking at people who can?t afford multiplexes but still try and go there for want of an alternative. By screening popular films, we want to attract young viewers and also make money? We plan to screen Mission Impossible III when it comes here.? 

 As a cine-goer who feels the pocket pinch, MBA student Sougata says: ?Nandan provides the best of facilities at very affordable rates. The multiplex rates are too steep for us.?

 But it?s really a mixed movie menu that Nandan is preparing in order to tick with the times. If the 1,000-seater Nandan I is reserved for blockbusters and big releases, the 200-seat capacity Nandan II is the hub of a different kind of activity.

 Since October 2005, the authorities have been hosting a retrospective of a film-maker every month. May is dedicated to Guru Dutt, with a package of five films. The three-day treat began on May 17 with Aar Paar and Pyasa. May 18 features Kaagaz Ke Phool and Chaudvin Ka Chand, while Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam will be screened on May 18.

 The retrospective has become a fixture on the Nandan calendar, bolstered by the audience response. ?We had more viewers than we could accommodate with a Hitchcock retrospective last year. There were many who even squatted on the floor. Last month we had one on Truffaut, and we plan to show the old classics of Frank Capra and Antonioni soon. That apart, the consulates are showing interest in organising screenings,? added Chatterjee.

 From May 22, Nandan III will come alive with a month-long film appreciation course, held annually, with 1,000 students on the rolls.

 As Calcuttans continue their quest to be counted among the more aware and eager wine-drinking crowd, and red and amber invade the party spectrum, theres now a novel nest in town offering a wine-coordinated dining experience for the first time.

 The brainchild of celebrity chef and GoodLife columnist Shaun Kenworthy, F amp;B entrepreneur Naveen Pai and hotel management graduate Pinaki Mitra, The Blue Potato (27, Shakespeare Sarani, with entry from Outram Road) promises to enthuse the citys culinary connoisseur, stressing on fine dining and fine wines of the world.

 Ive always wanted to do something in Calcutta centred around wine and jazz and I wanted the place to be small and intimate, quite like the hip jazz bars in Paris or the exclusive wine-restaurants of London and New York. The Blue Potato, with 36 covers, fits the bill, Shaun tells GoodLife.

 The restaurant, which will entertain groups of diners through reservation only and not do more than one rotation every evening, breaks the formal traditions of European cuisine adopting Asian influences. It aims to recreate the classic small fine-dining room of old Europe with this contemporary approach.

 Its a dream we share and this will be the citys first restaurant to showcase the chefs creations. The idea is to stop looking only at what the market wants, but to create a new concept and enjoy doing it. We know its a venture fraught with a few pitfalls, but Calcutta deserves a place like this and we decided to take the plunge, says Naveen.

 Shaun agrees its a harsh step to take, not selling hard liquor, but is backing his gut feel and his memories of a very cosy and sexy Manchester jazz bar, Lagitane, which had changed his life, besides the incredibly stylish Paris haunts.

 The actual blue potato that grows across California is a hybrid, like the Shakespeare Sarani restaurant and its cuisine. The diner at The Blue Potato will experience a modern French-Italian fusion feel in cooking techniques and presentation with influences and flavours from the world over.

 The menu will be split into two different dining concepts. The weekly-changing set fare, non-vegetarian and vegetarian, will offer two choices a two-course or a three-course menu, while an abbreviated a la carte selection is divided into starters, mains and desserts.

 Its very contemporary European fare, with no rules and this is great fun for the chef and the diner alike, smiles Shaun. A wide array of domestic and world wines, sparkling wines, beers and juices, and post-dinner French pressed coffee or freshly brewed tea will complement the cuisine.

 The decor is designed to create a relaxed setting for the special wine-dine experience. The dimmed lighting, pebbles and wooden beams, foliage and a blue potato, glass slits in the frontage where you can see whats happening inside and candles on the windows for the warm glow on the faade every element, as you enter through the porch, adds to the ambience.

 The simple light colours grey, white, light blue with the natural look and feel of Burmese teak, a few pieces of abstract artwork and photographic art on the walls, candlelight and strains of jazz, all contribute to embellish the eatery.

 Doctored drinks duo held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A couple from Murshidabad was arrested on Thursday on charges of fleecing people by offering them spiked food or drinks. The couple?s first victim was NGO worker Sudipta Sarkar. The youth, in his early 20s, was part of a team that was conducting a pollution-awareness campaign in front of Tata Centre on Wednesday.

 A woman, identified as Sima Bibi, approached him and said she wanted to know about pollution in detail. ?She requested Sudipta to move away from the crowd so she could listen to him,? said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner (south). 

 Once away from public view, Sima offered Sudipta spiked mango juice. Some time later, he was found lying unconscious on the pavement of Robinson Street, his cellphone and watch missing. He was admitted to a private hospital.

 As the news reached police, Babu alerted all police stations under his jurisdiction.

 ?Around 8 pm on Thursday, plainclothesmen spotted a young woman approaching another near Victoria Memorial. A man was standing a few feet away, keeping a watch on the two women. The cops intercepted the man and the first woman. Three packets of spiked biscuits and a packet of spiked mango juice were found in her bag. They confessed to having duped Sudipta a day before. The man has been identified as Akhtar,? said Babu.

 The couple has been remanded in police custody till May 10.

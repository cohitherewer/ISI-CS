 It's Your Birthday So...

 If there?s anything close to perfect, it?s probably you. You?re a serious worker, once you feel for a cause. Your emotional stability and intellectual capacity give you the competitive edge. Your powerful personality comes across easily. Try to let people learn from their mistakes, rather than telling them what to do at all times.You have it in you to motivate people; you?ll make a great team leader. ? Kusum Bhandari

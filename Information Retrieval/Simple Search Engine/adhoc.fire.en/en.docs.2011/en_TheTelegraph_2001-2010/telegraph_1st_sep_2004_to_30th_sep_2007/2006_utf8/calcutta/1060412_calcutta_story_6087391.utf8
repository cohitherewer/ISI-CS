The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Parking solution linked to revamp

 - Mayor tours Great Eastern Hotel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Restoration of a heritage hospitality address, which had hosted the likes of Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling and Michael Madhusudan Dutta, could well catalyse parking solutions to relieve congestion in Calcutta?s central business district, if the civic body has its say.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who did a walk-through of Great Eastern Hotel on Tuesday evening, emphasised that adequate parking facilities in or around the property should be a primary pre-requisite for restoration of the 165-year-old hotel.

 The site tour was piloted by city architect Dulal Mukherjee, who is creating the design solution for Bharat Hotels Ltd of Lalit Suri, in tandem with Singapore-based Architect 61 of Raffles fame, and Victoria Memorial curator Chittaranjan Panda, adviser to the project. A Powerpoint presentation of the proposed plans was also made.

 ?Parking is a major problem in this area and great care must be taken to address this issue to make the born-again Great Eastern a sustainable venture,? the mayor stressed. He also promised to speak to Writers? to find out the status of the underground parking plaza linked to retail at Curzon Park, designed by architect Mukherjee for a Singapore consortium, besides the Lal Dighi parking plan.

 Prompted by Bandyopadhyay, Mukherjee and his team will make a presentation of the project plan before the police commissioner on Wednesday for Lalbazar?s directive on optimum parking required for the hotel. A similar showcase before the heritage committee is also lined up. According to current plans, a twin-level basement parking lot has been proposed to hold 150 cars, which the Corporation feels is inadequate.

 The restored Great Eastern will become a ?five-star deluxe hotel? with over 250 rooms, a swimming pool, spa, health club, new banqueting facilities, contemporary nightlife options, speciality restaurants and shopping arcade? The aim is to retain the heritage footprint and pull down vestigial structures.

 ?We will try to remove post-Independence elements from the old block and hark back to the Raj style to the extent possible, while retaining landmarks like the Maxim restaurant. The new 10 to 12-storeyed structure to be built at the rear will be understated to blend with the inherent design and we are looking at the possibility of giving a facelift to adjacent unkempt structures to create a seamless urbanscape,? Mukherjee told Metro.

 Among the recommendations are rebuilding a smooth-functioning circulation circuit by ?providing missing links? between service cores, a landscaped courtyard on the ground level and tall trees to block unseemly views. ?We plan to create a palm group by growing trees on the ground level and sprouting them through holes in the open terrace to present a unique ambience,? the architect said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Political twist to hawker eviction

 Encroachment of pavements by hawkers at 

 Hatibagan. A Telegraph picture

Arka Bose: As the former mayor, do you support the present mayor?s decision of pedestrians sharing the pavements with hawkers? 

 This is a part of a bigger political game, where just the CPM leaders will gain in the long run. This decision will permanently damage the city?s business environment. It will also give impetus to the illegal business of selling pavements to the hawkers. Do you know that these spaces are sold for Rs 1 lakh. And the present civic board is claiming that they are helping the unemployed youths. Hawkers are no longer a socio-economic problem in Bengal. Common people are the worst sufferers. In areas like Gariahat, Hatibagan and Shyambazar, pedestrians are forced to walk on the streets. Hawkers should be rehabilitated in a proper marketplace, where they can run their business without any hassles and fear.

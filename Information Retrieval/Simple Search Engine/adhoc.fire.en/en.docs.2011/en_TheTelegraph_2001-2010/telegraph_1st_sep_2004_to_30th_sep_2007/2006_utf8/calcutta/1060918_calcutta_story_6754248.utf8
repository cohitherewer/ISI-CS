 Ode to womanhood

 A colourful precursor to Durga Puja, the annual autumnal festival of Bengal, Tribute to Durga, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures, also attempts to celebrate woman power as visualised by artists. Featuring the works of 23 artists of Calcutta, young and old, the show brings together awe-inspiring compositions in varied styles and techniques. Some paintings, done on canvas or paper, are designed in geometric and graphic forms, while others are surrealistic. Among the sculptures, terracotta images of Durga, modelled in traditional Indian style, deserve special mention. Exploring themes that weave around traditional Indian art as well as French and modern art, the works on show evoke feelings of veneration, adoration and worship. Besides being depicted as a figure of divinity, the goddess is also portrayed in her earthly attributes, perhaps suggesting womens empowerment as also conveying the artists respect and reverence to womanhood. Participating artists include Subrata Chowdhury, Debashish Deb, Nirmalendu Mandal, Shyamal Roy and Parag Adhikary.

 Baruipur, if not Rajarhat

 - SPACE JAM IN IT ZONE

 BISWAJIT ROY

 Space jam in the information technology (IT) sector has prompted the state IT department to ask the urban development department for 500 acres in Baruipur, on the southern fringes of the city. If allotted, the department intends setting up an IT park on the plot.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the issue would be discussed at his scheduled meeting with IT minister Debesh Das on June 28.

 The IT department owns 330 acres in Rajarhat, which are being allotted to various units, and has got approval for setting up a 130-acre special economic zone (SEZ) at Bantala Leather Complex. 

 The government is developing 13 software parks with 13 million sq ft of built-up area.

 The IT department?s move to acquire land in Baruipur follows a scramble for space among industry players and Hidco?s refusal to provide it at a concessional rate in Rajarhat. Hidco?s stand has made uncertain the future of Wipro?s proposed IT-specific SEZ.

 The IT minister?s meeting with housing minister Goutam Deb last week failed to break the deadlock over price. ?Land will be provided to all genuine investors, but all cannot be accommodated in Rajarhat,? Deb had said.

 According to Das, Hidco has already scaled down the land price in Rajarhat from Rs 2.16 crore an acre to Rs 1.5 crore. But Wipro wants a further reduction.

 Das said the government had also offered land to Wipro at Bantala SEZ at Rs 86 lakh an acre. ?But the company is more keen on Rajarhat, because of its proximity to the airport. Its parent unit in Bangalore, though, is away from the city.?

 He added: ?We will try to renegotiate the price with Wipro and request them to see plots in Jagadishpur, off Rajarhat, as well as in areas close to Vedic Village. If they are interested, we can also show them land in Kharagpur.?

 The tug-of-war over land price also marks the negotiation between the government and another IT major, Infosys.

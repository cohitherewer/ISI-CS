The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Designer star and style

 Thanks largely to a new crop of actors, filmi fashion has finally taken a professional turn in Tollywood, says Reshmi Sengupta

 You wouldn?t catch Swastika Mukherjee dead in a puff-sleeved frock with piping on the borders, or Jeet in a tacky shirt teamed with an outlandish jacket. And Koel Mullick is aeons away from those coarse synthetic saris her senior colleagues simpered in while romancing their heroes.

 All three believe in sporting a chic, cool and casual look off screen. All three are fashion-conscious, have a flair for clothes and swear by a smattering of designer wear to spice up their personal wardrobe.

 And now, this style statement is starting to show on screen. Yes, even in typical Tollywood blockbusters. Thanks to the initiative of this new star crop, production houses are roping in fashion designers to brainstorm the look, paving the path for a band of Manish Malhotras and Neeta Lullas.

 The seeds were sown two summers ago when Venkatesh Films assigned designer Agnimitra Paul to create the ensembles for Jeet and Koel in Bandhan. Now there?s Snehasish Bhattacharya, Sunipa Samadder, Atreyi Basu, Seema Saraf, Chandrani Singh Flora and Saberi, either working with film production units or supplying clothes to actors for their projects.

 ?I like to have some designer clothes for special occasions like award ceremonies, shows and appearances. Having a professional designing the costumes adds to the look of the film,? says Jeet, who also shops from Mumbai designer labels like Rocky S.

 Sheer fabric, colour co-ordination and smart cuts enhance the visual quality. ?It?s such a welcome change that even the production houses are happy,? echoes Swastika, who gets her personal wardrobe done by Atreyi Basu and also shops for western outfits abroad. For her forthcoming film co-starring Jisshu, she has got her outfits from Snehasish Bhattacharya?s Darzee.

 Director Probhat Roy, who has engaged as many as three designers for Priyatama starring Jeet, Swastika and Shreya Pande, is a relieved man. ?Assigning the costumes to a designer rids us off a huge headache. They make the garments according to the trends and also take care of the fitting. It?s good value for money as the visual impact is enhanced. Otherwise, one has to accompany the artistes to the shops,? says Roy, who remembers going shopping with Aparna Sen to buy her saris for Swet Patharer Thala.

 The changing room

 From colour coordination to styling, the designers have a big role to play in upping the glam quotient. And the best thing is to get a bunch of designers to work on a single film, feels Koel. ?I like to experiment with many designers, so that there?s no repetition and the look is different in each song sequence,? she explains. If Chandrani Singh Flora did her outfits in Chore Chore Mustuto Bhai, Saberi took charge of Eri Naam Prem.

 The groundwork for filmi fashion begins with a joint sitting of the director/producer and the designer where the storyline and characters are discussed. Then, the designer works on the look and styling after discussions with the actors.

 ?We find out the actors? preferences and accordingly decide on the look. The only thing one has to keep in mind is not giving the heroines any short clothes. That?s still unacceptable among the audience,? says Agnimitra, whose list of high-profile clientele has a recent addition in the form of Mithun Chakraborty. Apart from designing Mithun and Debasree?s costumes for a Swapan Saha film, Agnimitra assignments include Sharon Dutta?s Shikar (for Koel), a Venkatesh film starring newcomers, Probhat Roy?s Priyatama (for Swastika) and a film starring Anu Chowdhury and Amitabha.

 Sunipa?s tinsel town story started with Swastika approaching her to do the costumes for Kranti, another Venkatesh production. Now she is designing western outfits for Swastika and newcomer Shreya Pande in Priyatama. Draped and layered skirts, blazers, jackets and corsets are Swastika?s ensembles while Shreya has been given a host of suits and fitting shirts for her corporate woman look. ?The trick lies in understanding the characters and what the script requires from them in specific scenes,? stresses Sunipa.

 Budding designer Seema Saraf has crafted the Indian wear for Shreya. For a rich man wooing a regular college-goer, NIFT graduate Atreyi Basu has packed Jeet?s costumes with ?classy and sophisticated? shirts and semi-formals in Priyatama. ?I have been designing for Jeet for almost a year ? his personal clothing, wardrobe for shows and some films,? says the designer who has trained under Manish Malhotra. 

 But there is still some way to go before Tollywood truly goes designer. ?The problem is that many designers can?t deliver on time. And since it?s done at the last hour, the fitting is also unsatisfactory. I think they need to spend more time on this if this is to take off as a really fruitful venture,? cautions Swastika.

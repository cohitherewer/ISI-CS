The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Traffic in free run

 A STAFF REPORTER

 How many mishaps must VIP Road see before the authorities decide to do something about this killer stretch? The twin mishaps on Tuesday afternoon brought some of the traffic faults on VIP Road into sharp focus.

 Inadequate policing: There are not enough traffic policemen at vital intersections. With few policemen around, bus drivers have a free run. Despite a string of mishaps, nothing is done. Many cops are too busy collecting bribes to bother, alleged a retired government employee in Lake Town.

 Rogue Drivers: They step on it as soon as they hit VIP Road. Racing buses on similar routes is a favourite pastime. Bus drivers accelerate on the stretch and drive recklessly. That is what caused the accidents on Tuesday, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), adding that more policemen would be deployed soon to slam the brakes.

 Crossroad Chaos: From Ultadanga to Baguiati, due to lack of traffic planning and management, there is a free-for-all, with both pedestrians and vehicles in peril.

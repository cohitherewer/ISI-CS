Simultaneous Chess Display 2006 was held at IndianOil Bhavan on December 9, with Grandmaster Surya Shekhar Ganguly taking on 112 opponents in a tournament that lasted around six hours.

 The preliminary rounds were conducted by Udayan Ghosh, international arbiter, at 26 city schools as per the rules of classic chess. Apart from school students, there were also participants from IndianOil and CU.

 This was the first time that Ganguly participated in such a tournament, playing with white chessmen, according to simultaneous chess rules.

 Ganguly remained undefeated, with only Abhratanu Dutta being able to draw the game against the Grandmaster. The student of Class VII at St James School said: I had almost closed the game in my favour, but Ganguly is very good at lightning chess. 

 Abhratanu received a cash prize of Rs 2,500, with Subroto Ghosh, general manager (regional services), IndianOil eastern region, announcing a special award of Rs 5,000 for him as well. Actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty gave away the prizes to Abhratanu and to five other top performers.

 All five Grandmasters of West Bengal, including Dibyendu Barua, Neelotpal Das and Sandipan Chanda, were present. Barua, however, said that he was sad that none of the participants had been able to defeat Ganguly.

 A quiz on chess was conducted along the sidelines, in which Debayan Mazumdar of St James School, Aritro De of Salt Lake School and Raj Goenka of Bhawanipur Gujarati Educational Society School won the first three positions.

 Ganguly said: I was pleasantly surprised to find national-level players participating. Chess does not enjoy the kind of financial backing that sports like cricket and football do. So, young players do not come up with as much frequency. I hope this tournament will make a difference.

 Seasons flick

 Open Season, the first animation film from Sony Pictures, is now available in VCD.

 In the family comedy-action-adventure, Boog (Martin Lawrence), a domesticated grizzly bear with no survival skills, has his perfect world turned upside down when he meets Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), a scrawny, fast-talking mule deer. When Elliot convinces Boog to leave his cushy home in a park rangers garage to get a taste of the great outdoors, things quickly spiral out of control.

 With each VCD of the movie comes a free Open Season School Essentials kit and the inside of the VCD jacket has a Boog amp; Elliot board game, which is based on the storyline. A contest is also on in which kids need to match character names to the pictures of the characters. Winners will get Open Season Christmas gifts.

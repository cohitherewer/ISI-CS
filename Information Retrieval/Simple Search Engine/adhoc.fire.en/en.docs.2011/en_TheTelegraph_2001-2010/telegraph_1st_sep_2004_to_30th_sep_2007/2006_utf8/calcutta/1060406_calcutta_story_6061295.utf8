 - BRAND BRANDISH ON CELLULOID

 Brand brandishing on celluloid is nothing novel, as high-profile gadgets, apparel labels and assorted objects of desire have been showcased on the big screen since the concept of organised marketing was born.

 Now, ?for the first time, a company headquartered in Calcutta has done real-time product placement to gel with? a Bollywood movie. Attitude, which retails ?the best? from the stable of Tvilum-Scanbirk A/S, the Denmark-based global leader in home furniture, feeding brands like IKEA, Home Depot and B amp;Q, has placed its products in the Raj Kanwar movie Humko Deewana Kar Gaye, set for an April 14 release.

 The Akshay Kumar-Katrina Kaif-Bipasha Basu starrer, a T-Series production, has drawn liberally from the Attitude range of latest international-style, high-end furniture. So, while the retail brand?s best-selling Naia Wenge bed is used for Katrina?s wedding night sequence, the Camizion bed adorns Akshay?s house and Bipasha retires in the Attitude Cubic bed, another global rage on the retail racks.

 ?We have collaborated with the director and producer to use our products appropriately to add value to the set and specific sequences. This is a subtle branding tool designed to underline that Attitude isn?t a me-too brand in a scenario where everyone is importing furniture,? says Gaurav Goenka of the Kitply family, CEO amp; customer companion, Universal Specialities Ltd, owners of the Attitude brand.

 Calcutta houses the flagship store of the chain, which has recently launched in Bangalore and is looking at 50 outlets all over the country in the next two years. The premium beds, leather sofa sets, cabinets, chests and coffee tables used in the movie are not part of a special edition, but picked from the routine catalogue.

 Goenka, who is convinced this indirect backend advertising of his products would lead to better brand recall by playing on the customer?s subconscious, has agreed to chip in with marketing of the movie as well. ?We are putting up billboards of the film at significant intersections and also using stills featuring our products in our stores as a continuous co-branding exercise,? he says.

 Pantaloons did it with the Miss India pageant recently to prop up its Fresh Fashion range and Goenka feels such ?out-of-the-box? methods to connect better with the consumer will pretty much be the order of the day. ?More and more retail brands might opt to leverage the magic pull of the big screen soon,? says the Attitude boss, who is soon launching a ?budget brand? called Kitfurn, to be retailed from small furniture outlets.

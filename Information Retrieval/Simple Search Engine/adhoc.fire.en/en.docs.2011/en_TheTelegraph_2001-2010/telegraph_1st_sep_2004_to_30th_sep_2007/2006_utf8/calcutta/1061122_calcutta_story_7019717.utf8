 Data hunt to fix research

 - Exercise afoot to plan upgrade and check plagiarism

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Are too many research projects of the same type going on in institutes of higher education?

 Which are the most sought-after 

 areas for research?

 What are the key areas being 

 neglected by researchers?

 Why are more women scholars 

 joining research institutes? What steps can be taken to 

 improve the research scenario?

 The state government has flagged off an exercise in colleges, universities and research institutes to find answers to such questions. The aim is to collect comprehensive data on research and its infrastructure in order to plan an upgrade and check plagiarism.

 The exercise will cover state-aided universities like Calcutta and Jadavpur universities, engineering and medical colleges and research institutes run by the Centre, including Indian Institute of Chemical Biology and Indian Association of Cultivation of Science, said Parthasarathi Chakrabarti, principal scientist, state science and technology department.

 The questionnaire has been prepared and will soon be sent to the institutions for collection of data. The officials will then visit the campuses for a detailed study.

 The department will submit the report to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is reportedly keen that the standard of research in basic sciences improves.

 According to officials, cries of plagiarism have also prompted the survey. Earlier this year, the executive council of Jadavpur University had started an inquiry against two senior teachers for pursuing research on the same topic and submitting identical theses.

 A senior teacher of Calcutta University was recently ordered not to act as research guide following charges of aiding plagiarism.

 We want to find out why scholars are showing an interest in conducting research on the same subject. Is it because the institutions lack infrastructure? said an official.

 The state also wants to ascertain why an overwhelming majority of researchers are women. We are told by various institutes that 75 per cent of the research scholars in most departments are women. We want to understand this trend and identify fields where women are more inclined towards research, added principal scientist Chakrabarti.

 The number of students and teachers engaged in research in an institute and the names of agencies sponsoring the projects have also been sought in the questionnaire.

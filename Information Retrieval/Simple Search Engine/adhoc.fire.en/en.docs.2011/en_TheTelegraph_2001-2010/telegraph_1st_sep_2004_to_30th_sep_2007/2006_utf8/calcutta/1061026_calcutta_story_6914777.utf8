 The police have sounded a high alert before the annual general meeting (AGM) of the Academy of Fine Arts on October 27. 

 The existing executive committee members are sharply divided over the AGM and election of a new executive committee, as one faction levels charges against another. 

 The executive committee has decided to hold the AGM for fiscal 2003-2004 on October 27, 2006. No sooner had this decision been announced than some senior members of the committee challenged the validity and motive behind it.

 How can an AGM for 2003-2004 be held in 2006? This is ridiculous, says Pradipta Kanungo, vice-president of the executive committee since 1998. She alleged that the committee had undemocratically made void the memberships of some 155 Academy members and included in their place 86 new members. 

 Besides, she charged, while the executive committee letter said the first date for filing nominations to the new executive committee was October 5, it also announced a panel of new executive committee members that included the names of those whose memberships had been cancelled by the committee itself. 

 Among the ousted members are some well-known people like Harshavardhan Neotia, Usha Ganguly and Ramaprasad Banik, said Kanungo, whose name was not included in the proposed panel of new committee members.

 How can the executive committee run the academy properly if it handles matters in such an undemocratic manner? Kanungo wondered. 

 This indicates that vested interests are at work here. We have 2,710 rare exhibits in our gallery, including 37 original paintings of Rabindranath. Their value is well over Rs 500 crore, she said. 

 However, the executive committee members, against whom Kanungo and some of her senior colleagues have made these allegations, rubbished the charges.

 Those who headed the previous committee ran the Academy in a most inefficient manner. Now that we are trying to instil discipline, they are raising baseless allegations against us. They want to enjoy power without responsibility and our endeavour to hold the AGM and the executive committee election goes against them, said Shyam Kanu Borthakur, honorary joint secretary of the culture hub.

 Both parties have moved police. We advised them not to hold the AGM without sorting out the differences. Besides, additional forces will be deployed at the Academy, said a senior officer of Hastings police station, under whose jurisdiction Academy of Fine Arts falls.

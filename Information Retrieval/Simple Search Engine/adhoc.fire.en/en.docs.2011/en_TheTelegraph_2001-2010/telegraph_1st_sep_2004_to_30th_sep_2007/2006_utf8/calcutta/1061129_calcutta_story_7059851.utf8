The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boost to civic drainage capacity

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 To cut down on expenditure, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and its sister concern Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) are handing over 18 drainage pumping stations and a sewage treatment plant to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).

 The handover will be completed by December. The step will help the CMC augment its drainage capacity under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, with funds from the Asian Development Bank.

 According to a CMDA official, the pumping stations and the treatment plant changing hands were built in the 1980s at a cost of nearly Rs 60 crore. It had been decided that they would be handed over to the CMC on completion, but that could not be done because of technical reasons. 

 On an average, the CMDA spends Rs 5 crore annually on the upkeep of the pumping stations.

 If the CMDA can save such a hefty sum, it can create more assets and at the same time boost its financial position, said the official.

 Chief engineer (electrical and mechanical) of the CMDA Bidyut Baran Bhattacharya stated: It had been decided that the units would be handed over by November 30, but the CMC sought more time. The process is likely to be completed by December 31. The CMC would decide the fate of the employees working at these units.

 Of the 18 pumping stations, three are in Borough I, four in Borough XII, three in Borough XIV and one each in boroughs VII, XV and XI. The sewage treatment plant is near Mahestala. The pumping stations in boroughs VII and XI are run by the CMWSA.

 Bhattacharya said teams from the CMDA, CMWSA and the CMC would inspect the pumping stations before the handover. Hopefully, the formalities will soon be over and there will be no problems in handing over the pumping stations to the CMC by the end of December, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fowl falls foul of tech town menu

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The prescription is for precaution over panic, but Sector V has already decided to log chicken out of its kitchen. 

 The tech bastion of Bengal pushed the panic button as soon as reports of bird flu in Maharashtra trickled in. Most IT companies have instructed their caterers to strike chicken off the menu.

 ?The brief from the firms we cater to is clear ? till further notice, we are not to send any chicken preparation. Chicken will be replaced by mutton and fish,? said Naveen Pai of Pai Caterers, feeding IBM.

 But replacing chicken overnight is neither easy nor profitable for caterers. ?Chicken forms a very big portion of any meal that we serve in Sector V. Lamb and fish are more expensive and so, the impact will be major,? said Ashim Mewar of ABNM Restaurants Private Limited. The catering wing of Red Kitchen and Lounge manages meals at Wipro and HSBC.

 For some catering companies, the change has not been overnight, as the food format at the technology hub was undergoing a subtle shift over the past fortnight.

 ?With bird flu being reported in other countries, the consumption of fish and vegetable dishes had gone up by 30 per cent in the past two weeks. From Monday, of course, chicken consumption will be zero,? said S. Ramani, partner, Savourites, which caters to Cognizant and TCS.

 The bird flu factor looms at a time when eating out is a way of daily life in Calcutta. So, fish should be the fad of the fortnight, even in standalone restaurants around town. ?We will be offering a separate fish menu from Monday,? said Kanishka Mazumdar of Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion.

 ?The movement of chicken will go down for sure and if the situation so demands, we may discontinue chicken for a while,? revealed Rajesh Dubey, chef, Mainland China. 

 At star addresses, ?extra careful? was the byword. ?Chicken and eggs are so basic that one really can?t rule them out entirely. But we are employing a two-level security system, one at the supplier level and the other in the kitchen. We will also avoid chicken in salads and encourage people to try out bekti and other fish,? said a spokesperson at Hyatt.

 ?Along with the cooking temperatures, we are monitoring storage temperatures very carefully and our lab experts are on the alert,? said an official at The Park.

 So, at food stops around town, the coming week will be spent taking extra safety measures and gearing up for the greater demand for fish and mutton dishes.

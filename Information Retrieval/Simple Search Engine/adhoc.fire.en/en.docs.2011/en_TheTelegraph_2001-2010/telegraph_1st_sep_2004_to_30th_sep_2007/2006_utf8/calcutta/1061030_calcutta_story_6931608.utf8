 Tenants to be party to demolitions

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is ready to amend its building rules to demolish unsafe houses. Tenants, for the first time, will be party to the demolition and reconstruction.

 The death of at least six people in building collapses in the city since 1998 has prompted the move, say civic officials.

 The CMC has faced strident opposition from tenants in demolishing dilapidated houses. On many occasions, tenants have chased away civic workers or moved court during demolition drives. 

 The CMC now plans to slap notices on house-owners, directing them to make tenants a part of the process by promising them rehabilitation.

 The owners of 1,100 dilapidated buildings, most of them in north and central Calcutta, have already been asked to enter into such agreements with their tenants, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Sunday. Of these buildings, the condition of 600 are very serious. We want to demolish them first, he added.

 This will enable us to avoid opposition from tenants during demolition drives, claimed a civic official.

 The idea of involving tenants in building demolition came up during hearing of a case in the high court, filed by tenants of 10, Kiran Shankar Roy Road. The tenants moved court after the civic body started demolishing the second floor of the building after its portico collapsed on September 1.

 The tenants lawyer argued that the owner had not repaired the house despite repeated requests. Why should the tenants suffer for the owners failure? he asked. The judge then asked for a list of tenants in the building.

 Aloke Ghosh, who represented the CMC in the high court, pointed out: The civic body already has special powers to demolish any building it deems unsafe. 

 Heritage structures will not come under the purview of the amendment.

 On the occasion of the golden jubilee of its Blind Boys? Academy, Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Narendrapur, presents Vivekananda, a musical mono-act play. It traces the events that led Narendranath Dutta to become a great rebel saint who changed modern history with his vision and his work. This two-hour performance begins with well-known anecdotes of his childhood, before moving on to the influence of the Brahma Samaj and his resolve to find God. His meeting with his mentor Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa and the indoctrination he received from him is handled skillfully and is beautifully depicted as the final step before he casts off his old persona and becomes Swami Vivekananda. The momentous, unforgettable speech delivered by him at the Chicago religious congress establishes his love for humanity, envisioning the world as one large family. Written, composed and enacted by Shekhar Sen, the performance promises to enlighten modern minds with Vivekananda?s revolutionary thoughts.

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama auditorium, Narendrapur

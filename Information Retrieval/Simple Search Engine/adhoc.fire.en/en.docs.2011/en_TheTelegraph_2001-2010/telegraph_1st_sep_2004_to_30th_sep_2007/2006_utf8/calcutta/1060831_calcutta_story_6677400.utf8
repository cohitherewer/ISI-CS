 Panel to scan bids for club 

 - Five-man committee set up for Behala flight school revival

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government has formed a five-member committee to assess the proposals of two private companies to revive Behala Flying Club and the training centre on its premises.

 The committee will examine the offers and assess whether the companies, Pailan Group and Manpower Development and Management Private Limited, have the capability and efficiency to run the institute, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, who heads the panel.

 The other members are representatives of the state finance department, office of the director-general of civil aviation, Airports Authority of India and the air force. The panel will meet for the first time on September 18.

 The Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation had invited expressions of interest from private companies in June for handing over the flying club and the training institute.

 Six companies, including Jet Airways, had expressed interest in taking over the club, but only Pailan and Manpower submitted their bids.

 Jet Airways wanted to set up a captive institute in the club to train its own pilots, but the government shot down the proposal.

 We have formed the committee as we do not have the expertise to judge the capability of the bidders to run a pilot training institute. We will place the offers of the two companies before the panel, which will make a choice, said chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.

 We do not want to take any decision on our own. We will go by the technical committees judgment. If the panel selects one of the bidders, we will hand over the flying club to it. If it opines that neither is capable of running the club, a fresh tender will be floated, he added.

 The government had earlier decided to scrap the tender on the grounds of unsatisfactory response. 

 But transport minister Subhas Chakraborty took up the matter with CPM secretary Biman Bose, asking him to persuade chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take experts opinions in selecting one of the two companies.

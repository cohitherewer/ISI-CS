 The official version

 - 100 

 years of America

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Worker in Power House, by Lewis Hine, shot in 1920

 It is difficult to remember the last time that the US consulate-general, Calcutta, had organised a really significant cultural event. 

 The exhibition, Picturing The Century, 100 years of photographs from the National of the US, now on at Galerie 88, makes up for this remiss in some measure.

 This is a huge exhibition, comprising about 100 mostly black-and-white photographs, many of which were shot at the turn of the 20th Century. The National and Records Administration, which administers the National Archives, is the federal agency which receives, looks after and makes available the historic records of the US government. The archives handle a phenomenal number of stills. Washington DC alone has nine million stills, and aerial stills of an equal number.

 Since many of the exhibits date back to the time when photography was born, they trace the history of the medium as well as that of the era in which they were taken. This presents the official version of events, since the projects were government-sponsored. Some notable photographers such as Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, Jack Delano and Arthur Rothenstein were involved in these projects. But most of them were taken by unknowns.

 The surprise element of this exhibition is that it does not flinch from taking a hard look at some events that did not cover the Americans with glory. These photographs are all the more relevant, in view of Gnter Grasss recent admission on his Nazi past.

 The most outstanding of these is that of the naked Japanese prisoner of war aboard a many-decked battleship surrounded by a huge crowd of curious uniformed American soldiers craning their necks as this bag of bones was being bathed, clipped and deloused before being issued GI clothing. The expressions on the faces of these men and their gestures are very telling. Some are goggle-eyed, some are contemplative. A photographer kneels down to get a better view. Nothing could be worse than men in a herd.

 The exhibition begins with a 1900 shot of an Easter Parade in the Fifth Avenue, made famous by Judy Garland and Fred Astaire in a film of the same name. There are the Wright Brothers with their original craft, and a bazaar in New York of 1903 with its wagons and awnings. There is a Chinese family in 1913 in Western dress, and an eerie view of two hooded figures with an aircraft at a KKK gathering. 

 The most famous and dynamic image of this period is that of a young worker by Lewis Hine, an investigative photographer who worked for the child labour department. His biceps swelling, the worker tightens a bolt of a steam pump in a power house. There are similar ones of a builder on the Empire State Building under construction with the Chrysler building tower in the background, and a third of a worker on a ship, wrench in hand.

 The documentation of the Depression era, child labour and the two battles that shook the world is quite remarkable for its honesty and straightforwardness. 

 In the panoramic view in four sections of San Francisco after the earthquake in 1906, the remains of a steeple or a solitary highrise stand amid the huge desert of rubble.

 Of the more recent pictures, the one of President George Bush pre enjoying a Thanksgiving dinner with US troops in the Persian Gulf, has resonances for our times.

 Facts officers with no faces

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 A year has passed since Parliament put its seal of approval on the Right to Information (RTI) Bill, but the state government is yet to inform the people of the names of its 150-odd principal information officers (PIOs).

 The RTI Act makes the government responsible for publicising the names of the officers through newspapers, TV channels or any other form of mass media, or by displaying them at a proper place. 

 But the people have got to know the names of barely five PIOs, and that, too, through the dedicated websites of their departments.

 According to the RTI Act, a petition for a piece of information has to be submitted, along with the requisite fee, to the PIO concerned.

 The state information commission said it could not publicise the names of the PIOs, as its website is not yet ready. 

 The government has made a list of the officers in various departments. We will post their names on our website once it is ready. Till then, people have to write to us for the names or approach the home (PAR) department, said chief information commissioner Arun Bhattacharya.

 How is the public being affected by the governments failure to announce the names of the PIOs? 

 Ask Moloy Bhattacharya, a resident of Salt Lake.

 He had approached the Salt Lake municipality to know whether a private telephone company had obtained the civic authorities consent before erecting towers in some housing estates.

 After being directed from one officer to another for three months, a disgusted Bhattacharya finally moved the information commission seeking a list of names of the information officers.

 A. Chakraborty, a Dhakuria resident, has a similar tale to tell. I met several senior officers of the state cooperation department to get the name of the PIO, but none could help me. Later, I had to visit Writers Buildings to trace the officer and could get his contact details after a lot of effort, Chakrabarty added.

 S. Bhattacharjee, an elderly resident of Rajarhat, said: I once tried to get the name of the assistant principal information officer of the North 24-Parganas police, but failed. Even the superintendent of police could not help me.

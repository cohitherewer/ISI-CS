 Living Crafts of Bengal, an exhibition of 22 crafts ? from daker saaj to the nearly extinct Satgaon quilt ? commemorated the birth centenary of Ila Palchoudhury at Raj Bhavan on Monday.

 Apart from being a parliamentarian, a dedicated social worker and a member of some 30 boards ? from film censorship to coffee marketing ? Palchoudhury founded Crafts Council of West Bengal with Kamala Devi Chattopadhyay. 

 Addressing the gathering at Marble Hall were Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, Justice Manjula Bose (president, Crafts Council of West Bengal), Ashok Chatterjee (president, Crafts Council of India) and scholar P. Lal. 

 While dhakis drummed up a Puja-like ambience, patuas displayed painted scrolls and sang paeans to the champion of their craft. Palchoudhury?s great granddaughter Ahona performed a Vedic chant and granddaughter Nayantara Palchoudhury outlined her life and achievements. P. Lal recalled past tete-a-tetes with her on Shakespeare and Buddha.

 Ashok Chatterjee called for a revival of the Swadeshi idealism that had given Palchoudhury, Kamala Devi and several others the sense of urgency to save indigenous crafts. Craft is in as much a crisis now as it was then, he said.

 Chatterjee cited the example of artisans of brocade in Varanasi, who were hit hard by the sudden influx of brocade from China, at one-third the price. ?Indian craft is now being manufactured in China,? he remarked, ruing the absence of market research. 

 The governor lighted a dokra lamp, unveiled a terracotta plaque and garlanded with pith flowers a bust of Palchoudhury. While India is eighth in the world in terms of the number of dollar billionaires, 75 per cent of its citizens survive only on what they produce by hand and have a monthly per capita expenditure of Rs 503, pointed out Gandhi.

 Delhi trek for minority tag

 - Christian schools on new route to retain recruitment rights

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Schools run by Christian missionaries, deemed among the best in the city, are set to seek minority status from the Centre to pre-empt the state government?s intervention in their recruitment of teachers.

 The schools that have decided to get themselves registered with the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions are St Xavier?s, Loreto and Don Bosco, said Father Faustine Brank, a Catholic priest and a spokesman for the Association of Christian Schools.

 A team of representatives of the founder bodies of the schools will leave for Delhi this week to submit their applications to the commission.

 All missionary-run schools in the city and the districts are enlisted as minority institutions by the state government, but a similar declaration from the Centre is a must for the authorities to bypass the provisions of the West Bengal School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006.

 The bill, passed by the Assembly, makes it mandatory for all government-aided minority institutions to recruit teachers through the state school service commission. 

 The state government has even informed the schools that financial help would be denied if they refused to go by the revised rulebook.

 Christian organisations claim the bill violates Article 30 of the Constitution, which allows state-aided minority institutions to pursue an independent recruitment policy.

 ?Against this background, it has become necessary for us to reassert our minority rights. Once an institution is registered with the Commission, its minority status and rights cannot be challenged,? said Father Brank. 

 ?Certain developments over the past few months suggest that the Bengal government is not willing to let us enjoy the minority rights granted to us by the Constitution, especially in regard to appointment of teachers,? he added.

 The government, firm in its stand on the bill, is not sure of its course of action in the event of missionary schools seeking minority status from the Centre. 

 ?We are not aware of the national commission?s rules and regulations. We are also not aware that certain schools are seeking registration with the panel. If need be, we will examine the rules,? said Ardhendhu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner in the school education department. 

 He, however, refused to elaborate on the issue, as the bill is yet to be enacted.

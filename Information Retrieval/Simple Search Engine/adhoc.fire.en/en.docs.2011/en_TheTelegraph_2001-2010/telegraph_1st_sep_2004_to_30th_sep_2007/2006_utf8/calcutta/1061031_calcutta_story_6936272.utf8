 Old boys back new

 KINSUK BASU 

 Activate the alumni network to place the present batch with top-notch companies the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta has worked out this new strategy for a successful summer placements season, starting November 7.

 To make it a memorable summers on the heels of alumnus Indra Nooyis appointment as PepsiCo chief at Joka, the alumni association started its groundwork well in advance.

 So, while the faculty members were shuttling between Singapore and London, the alumni association was busy networking with batchmates in London, Singapore, Canada and Los Angles to sell brand IIM Calcutta.

 We spoke to almost everyone (from IIM-C) to tell the world about the strengths of this brand, said Ashok Bannerjee, secretary of the associations city chapter. 

 The likes of Ajit Balakrishnan of rediff.com were activated. Other old-timers, including those in top B-schools like Kellogg and Long Island, were contacted to put in place a rich recruitment roster.

 The results are showing, as the list of participants in the summer placements boasts new names. European divisions of investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, private equity firms like Tano Capital, Clearwater Capital, consulting firms Value Partners and McKinsey will queue up in Joka next week to recruit summer trainees from campus.

 We want to get more global players so that students gain overseas exposure. Thanks to the alumni association, this year, things are shaping up well, said S.D. Moitra, chairman, placement committee, IIM Calcutta.

 Not just in the nature of participants, the placement cell and alumni association partnership has worked in terms of numbers, as well. Last year, 15 to 18 companies came in the vital slot zero; we are expecting that number to double this time, said a placement cell representative.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 German biz show in city rendezvous 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta could, in the near future, have a slice of the worlds largest trade fair for industry, the Hannover Messe. Of course, it must put in place a fitting fairground prior to that and also spread the good word around on its core strengths and resources.

 Not just the business climate, theres a positive buzz about the essential fabric of the city and you can feel that energy growing year on year. We could soon look at Calcutta as a possible destination for a trade show, Wolfgang Pech, managing director, Hannover Fairs, said on Tuesday.

 Pech was in town for a presentation on Hannover Messe 2007 (April 16-20), and later met state industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen to extend an invitation for industry minister Nirupam Sen to attend the fair. While a state delegation is likely to go, it is not clear if the minister will head the team.

 When it comes to trade fairs, Germany is the undisputed world leader and Hannover the perfect rendezvous where industry bigwigs come and do their backroom deals, said German consul-general in Calcutta Gnter Wehrmann.

 Bangalore will become the third venue outside Germany (after Shanghai and Istanbul) to host a Hannover Messe ancillary trade show, when it hosts the conclave on industrial automation next year (December 4-7), across 40,000 sq m of display space inside the new international trade fair ground.

 There is a lot of interest in India among the European business community and the huge response to last years Hannover Messe when India was the partner country is a pointer to that. Bangalore is our first destination in India, but surely not the last, and Calcutta could be a future stop, Pech said.

 What he left unsaid was the primary prerequisite of an international-standard trade fair ground, which the city lacks, unlike a Bangalore or a Hyderabad. Nonetheless, Hannover Messe, which has the worlds largest trade fair ground, is hopeful of improved participation from Bengal.

 While over 150 Indian companies are expected to take up 3,000 sq m of exhibition space, Indo-German Chamber of Commerce Calcutta regional director B.G. Roy felt the city representation should go up substantially from the 11 enterprises which made the trip last year.

 The buoyancy is shared by Rajesh Nath, director of the German engineering federation VDMA. Import of German machinery by India has risen 52 per cent over 2005 and export of Indian machinery to Germany has grown 28 per cent. This two-way traffic is extremely encouraging, he said.

 Hannover Messe 2007, with Turkey as partner country, will feature 13 international flagship fairs for industrial technology, with over 6,000 exhibitors from 70 countries occupying a display area of 200,000 sq m.

 HIGH-PITCHED, NOT NASAL: Himesh Reshammiya on stage 

 What has been your schedule 

 like these last few months? 

 I finished an 18-city tour of the US in July-August, where I sang in the biggest of auditoriums Air Canada Centre in Toronto and Gibson Amphitheatre in Hollywood. Then I performed at Wembley Arena, drawing more people than the biggest rock stars do. We followed it up with three more concerts in Nottingham, Bolton and Glasgow. And now this (concert) in Calcutta where there was a one-lakh audience I just have to meet my fans. This one-to-one connection is very important.

 Your shows happen on consecutive 

 nights. On the rare days you are in Mumbai, you are up till 

 dawn with music sittings. Arent you worried about a breakdown?

 I am 31. My hobby is my profession, so I dont get tired. If it wasnt, perhaps I would have.

 Composer, singer and now actor. 

 Why are you a man in a hurry?

 Maine kya galti kar diye hai ke aap mujhe man in a hurry keh rahe hain? I have cut down on work. I am concentrating on Aap kaa Surroor, The Movie. Its a dramatic thriller. We are shooting from January. The promos will come from April. It will be shot in 18 countries.

 Do you expect it to be 

 a hit?

 Release ke din dekha jayega I believe in figures.

 Why do other singers see you 

 as a threat?

 I am not competing with anyone. I have got a style of my own. I dont think anyone is competing against me.

 Then why has Sonu Nigam spoken 

 out against you?

 Sonu is the best singer of India. I dont have anything against him.

 Does it hurt to face criticism?

 (After a pause) Yes, it does. I am human.

 Are you partial to yourself 

 when you compose? Why are most Himesh hits sung by you?

 The voice is contributing to the composition in my 36 hits.

 People love you or hate 

 you. Why is that so?

 I cant say. I believe in destiny and god, and god has been very kind that 99 per cent people love me. There is this one per cent who dont and Ill try to win them over, inshallah.

 Why are you singled out for 

 criticism because of your nasal notes?

 I dont know. RD Burman, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan saab, Mukeshji sab ko main bahut respect karta hoon. Log mujhe nasal kehte hain to main yeh kahunga ki thik hai. This has won me awards and critical acclaim. I dont have a problem with it. Its not nasal, basically its a high-pitched voice. I have also sung in low pitch Kitna Pyar in Banaras, Zara jhoom, Humko deewana kar gaye... I am singing in all the three octaves. Main ab react karna chhod chuka hoon. Main kuch kahunga to naya controversy ban jayegi.

 Who are your musical inspirations? 

 I love the work of RD Burman, Shankar-Jaikishen, Laxmikant Pyarelal My dad has trained me in classical music. I simplified it for the common man to understand and made it modern so the youngster can identify with it. I tried pure classical in Banaras. It was critically acclaimed but commercially it was not successful. Tere Naam with semi-classical music was a big hit. I have tried Sufi-rock in modern style with all my new songs Aashique, Surroor... All were big hits. The basic tune has to be raga-based, orchestrated in a contemporary way. 

 You rule the disc floors. 

 Are you a regular at discs?

 I party with my friends sometimes, 

 maybe once a month. It gives me an overall view of what 

 they like. Its very important to be in touch with the young 

 audience because they are the buying crowd.

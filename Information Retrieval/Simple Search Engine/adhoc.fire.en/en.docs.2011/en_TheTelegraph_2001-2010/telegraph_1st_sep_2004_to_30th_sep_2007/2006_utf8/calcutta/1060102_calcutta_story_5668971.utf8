Numbers like Roll Out The Barrel and When The Saints Go Marching In ushered in the New Year. The Birdie Dance followed, after which commercial music took over.

The band Krosswindz then took centre stage to keep the crowd on its feet, belting out one hit number after another.

The year was ushered in amidst much fanfare as balloons dotting the club premises were let loose and people greeted each other warmly. Prizes went out to the best couple on the dance floor and others.

 Sip n bite: The Continental fare on offer, well washed down was a hit.

But once DJ Prashant took over, churning out all the latest hits from Bollywood, there was a space jam on the dance floor.

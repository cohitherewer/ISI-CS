 Of truths retold

 ?I am very eager to work with M.S. Sathyu,? says Rituparna Sengupta

 The glint in his eyes and the smile sparkling through his flowing white beard belie M.S. Sathyu?s 76 years. The man who breathed Garam Hawa, one of the most memorable Hindi films on Partition, in 1973 is now planning to get back to the director?s seat with two projects.

 First up is a film on a social issue set in contemporary times, for which Sathyu wants to sign up Rituparna Sengupta. He has written the screenplay inspired by a real-life incident. ?We often tend to accept things in the name of tradition. The practice exists among scientists too. My film is set in a scientific organisation where the prejudices of caste system are at work? I want to cast Rituparna Sengupta in the lead role of a scientist. I liked her work in some of the films I have seen ? Nishijapon, Main Meri Patni Aur Woh and another one,? said the filmmaker, in town to attend the Fifth International Social Communication Conference hosted by Roopkala Kendro at Nandan.

 Rituparna, back in town to shoot for Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury?s Anuranon, is elated. ?I have had talks with M.S. Sathyu and I am very eager to work with him,? she told Metro.

 Bangalore-based Sathyu is a revered name in the field of stage designing having been involved with IPTA productions since the late 1950s. So, next up on the big screen is a film on Dara Shikoh, a Hindi play he has staged in Delhi. ?While making a historical film, most people go for spectacle. I am interested in the ideological content. The ideological difference of secularism and fundamentalism between brothers Aurangzeb and Dara Shikoh is what I found relevant,? said Sathyu. ?There?s no use in making a film on history unless it is made relevant.?

 Yana Gupta and the fitness of things 

 From ramp to screen to calendar, the Czech charmer has been on them all. ?I do not see myself as a big star doing multi-dimensional films every year. I am trying to do a one-off movie a year and concentrate on modelling,? said Yana, in town on Saturday for the Lee Perfect Fit contest. Fitness is the other fad for the Babuji zara dheere chalo girl. ?I am big time into working out now. It?s not about attaining a particular figure; fitness is more about a healthy state of mind,? said the healthy beauty in blue jeans, black T-shirt and a blue denim jacket.

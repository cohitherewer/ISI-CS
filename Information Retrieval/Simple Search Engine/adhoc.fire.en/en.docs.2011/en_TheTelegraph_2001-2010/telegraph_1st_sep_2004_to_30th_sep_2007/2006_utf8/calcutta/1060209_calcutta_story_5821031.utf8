 You have decided on the venue for a quiet candlelit dinner, ordered the flowers she loves, picked a pretty card and are racking your brains for that perfect piece of jewellery that will make her smile and light up the night.

 Well, with jewellery houses around town dishing out an amazing variety specially for the occasion, choosing that Valentines Day gift should be anything but Mission Impossible.

 And if you pick and choose it right, your gift wont burn a hole in your pocket either. Recognising the buying trend for Valentines Day, most jewellers have launched special lightweight lines for the occasion. 

 Jewellery as a token of love is no longer restricted to the ring. Lightweight trinkets at reasonable prices are becoming popular options for Valentines Day gifts with the young and even the not so young. Many middle-aged people who missed out on such occasions when they were young dont mind pampering their wives with something precious on this day, smiles Sudakshina Banerjee from the research, development and design team of The Gold Factory. 

 Sharat Sharma, design coordinator of Tanishq, adds: It is an occasion where you wouldnt do something really elaborate, but wont mind celebrating with a little token of love. Its a time when pendants, earrings, rings and sleek neckpieces do well.

 V-Day jewellery shopping is, however, yet to pick up this year. Last February, we noticed a growing awareness about gold being a suitable gift option. This year, the sales are yet to pick up and we are hoping to do well in the coming days, says Indranil Pal, spokesperson for PC Chandra.

 The Gold Factory on Rashbehari Avenue has unveiled a V-Day collection called Patthar Ke Sanam. Precious stones, mainly ruby symbolising the colour of love, have been combined with minimal gold.

 People associate stone jewellery with heavy jadau and kundans. But we have incorporated stone into work wear and party wear ornaments, says Sudakshina.

 The collection includes neckpieces, pendants, earrings and wristlets. Pretty heart-shaped and butterfly-shaped pendants can be combined with thin chains. Sleek neckpieces come coordinated with matching studs or tiny danglers. Prices start at Rs 1,500.

 The Goldlites line from PC Chandra, a special range of lightweight pieces in 22 karat gold, has special offerings for the occasion. Starting at Rs 4,000, smart bracelets, earrings in both ethnic and western designs, rings and pendants form this collection. 

 At Tanishq, it is a fusion of traditional and contemporary designs. Small hearts and cute motifs wouldnt go down well with 25-plus women. While the young adults like to go for these V-Day motifs, for older women we have floral illustrations, reveals Sharat. The collection comes in gold, diamonds combined with gold, and also platinum.

 A special Adora collection called Your Love Forever has diamonds set in heart patterns. The 4teen Love Collection includes diamond pendants, rings, earrings, bracelets and more. These are priced at Rs 8,000-plus.

 The collection is available at Indian Gem and Jewellery, Senco Jewellery Palace and the Shoppers Stop outlets. A nationwide contest called Your Love Forever promises the winner a diamond jewellery set specially designed by Lata Mangeshkar, under her signature line Swaranjali.

 At Anjali Jewellers, it is the Dil Se collection that captures the love in the air. Pendants include a heart or tiny stars with a diamond set in one corner.

 The Hum Tum collection here throws up budget buys. Every pendant or ring has a tiny pink heart engraved on it. Prices start at Rs 1,000.

 At Indian Gem and Jewellery, pink stones rule the range. Stones have been combined with white and yellow gold in kundan, jadau and meenakari settings.

 There are some innovations, too. A finger ring can be expanded to a bracelet. Then theres the bangle that comes with an interchangeable inside band. There are seven bands that come with the set.

 The diamonds and the stones are set in such a way that the bangle assumes the colour of the inner band, thus becoming a brand new bangle with each band. Also on offer are pins and brooches. Prices start at Rs 2,000. 

 Diagold has on offer heart-shaped pendants, earrings and the Yesterday Today and Tomorrow ring that is three rings entwined in one.

 Discounts on making charges and a free Swiss watch on a purchase of Rs 15,000 and above make your shopping more fun at Diagold. Prices begin at Rs 1,000.

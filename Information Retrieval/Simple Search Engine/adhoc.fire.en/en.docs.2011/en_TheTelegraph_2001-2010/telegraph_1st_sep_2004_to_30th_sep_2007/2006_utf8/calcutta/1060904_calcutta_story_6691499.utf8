The Telegraph - Calcutta : Guwahati

 Party Time

 Retro rock amp; ramp rage 

 Guests on the dance 

 floor at Octane. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 What: Rock amp; Roll Night.

 Where: Octane at Gariahaat 

 Mall.

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: The grooving 

 theme night at the latest nightclub in town drew its inspiration 

 from the rock roll fever of the 60s and the 

 70s. 

 The ambience of the nightclub 

 sent the mercury soaring even as DJ Amits remixes 

 drew the crowd to the dance floor in no time at all.

 False sideburns and collars resembling 

 the 70s styles were distributed among guests. A dance 

 competition for couples as well as singles rewarded the 

 best on the floor. 

 Sip bite: 

 Lebanese and Indian snacks coupled with an assortment of 

 cocktails and mocktails pampered the tastebuds.

 Fashion fever

 City models at a 

 fashion show in Big Ben on Friday.Picture by Rashbehari 

 Das 

 What: Festive fashion on 

 the ramp.

 Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth.

 When: Friday night.

 Take a look: City models 

 Pragya, Preeti, Suranjana, Nilanjana, Sanchita and Madhumita 

 sashayed an array of saris and western outfits across the 

 nightclub.

 In keeping with the festive mood, 

 the colour palette saw lots of bright reds, ochres and blacks. 

 The sequence displaying silk embroidered 

 saris was a creative showcase of fabrics and embellishments.

 Quite in contrast was the western 

 wear section that made bold statements with plenty of off-shoulders, 

 micro minis, leather skirts and netted tops.

 Denim and leather were used generously 

 in this segment. The show was choreographed by Anindya.

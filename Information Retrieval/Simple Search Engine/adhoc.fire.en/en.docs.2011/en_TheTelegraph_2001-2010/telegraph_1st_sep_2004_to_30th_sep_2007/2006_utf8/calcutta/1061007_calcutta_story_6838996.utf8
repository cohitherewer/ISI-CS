The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

A city, real amp; surreal

Stage On amp; Off

Desert queens

Actors rehearse in Sydney for the stage production of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, based on the successful Australian movie of the same name. Priscilla, which has its world premiere on October 7, tells the funny and moving story of three drag queens who find themselves like fish out of water when they head west across the desert from Sydney to fulfil a performance engagement.

Nobody has written a word on them yet, but the 20-odd 

young thespians who worked under the flag of Tin Can on its inaugural production 

charmed their total of 200-odd viewers through 10 shows. The Bengali-English Intro: 

An Hour in the City offered a funny yet loving and sympathetic look at our 

metropolis in an innovative performance style that captivated not just their own 

generation but seasoned theatregoers as well.

Soumyak Kanti De Biswass script and directorial concept 

treated ordinary daily routine in a narrow Calcutta lane with an extraordinary 

mix of real and surreal colours, seen from the eyes of a boy represented by a 

muppet outside the window of Uma Gallery looking into the lane inside. The central 

subject of his gaze was a drunk Corporation sweeper (played with a perfect swagger 

by Tanaji Dasgupta) who gets hit by a car, reaches heaven and insists on rebirth 

in Calcutta even when he hears theres a waiting list.

Other memorable characters who people the alley include 

a newspaper vendor who takes justifiable pride in delivering the news without 

fail to those who read it every morning; an intellectual who spouts jargon that 

imperceptibly changes into gibberish; two street fighters who wrestle, then box 

and finally duel to dialogue from Macbeth; and two mechanical salesmen.

On the most imaginative plane, when the sweeper tosses 

his empty bottle into his wheelbarrow, a doubled-up garbage man inside (literally, 

garbage personified) rises magically and joins four garbage girls in a fantastic 

 in every sense of the word song and dance item on the dirty side of the city. 

Technically, too, Intro had many things going 

for it: bilingual fluency that made it sound natural, a highly developed visual 

design, inventive lighting and music (live and canned), energetic choreography. 

Yes, some things didnt work as well as others the arty black-and-white video 

went on too long, the brochure was self-indulgent and a few sequences fell flat 

 but these can be overlooked. Tin Can says with no humility, We are the future. 

If so, it looks bright. Perhaps they have to remain forever young, though.

Soccer scenes

This Sunday, the Academy of Fine Arts will be the 

platform for the coming together of two favourite pastimes of Bengal soccer 

and stage.

Natya Football Shokal is a one-day event tracing the 

football trail on the Bengali stage, to be hosted by Ashoknagar Nattyamukh from 

10 am on October 8.

We will felicitate theatre veterans who have presented 

stage productions on football and who have inspired us to come up with our own 

take on the game, says Nattyamukh director Avi Chakraborty.

Those to be feted are Rudraprasad Sengupta, whose 

group Nandikar presented Peter Tersons Football, Bibhas Chakraborty and 

Manoj Mitra who got together to stage Atmagopon (Manoj Mitra had scripted 

the play produced by Bibhas Chakraborty for Anya Theatre), and Raja Guha who directs 

a production also called Football.

Among soccer stars sharing the stage are Chuni Goswami, 

Subhas Bhowmick and Surajit Sengupta.

The second half of the day belongs to Operation 

2010, a play written by Bratya Basu and presented by Ashoknagar Nattyamukh. 

The play is about Indias prospects in bringing home the World Cup in 2010!

This would be followed by the 500th staging of Raja 

Guhas Football, presented by Agarpara Kalpurush.

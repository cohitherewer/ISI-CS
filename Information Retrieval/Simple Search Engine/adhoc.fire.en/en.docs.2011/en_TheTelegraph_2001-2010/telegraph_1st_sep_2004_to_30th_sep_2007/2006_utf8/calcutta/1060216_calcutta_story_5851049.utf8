 Bill clout for agencies in build activity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Assembly on Wednesday passed the West Bengal Town and Country (Planning and Development) Amendment Bill, 2006, empowering development and planning authorities to regulate building operations, frame building rules and sanction building plans.

 The government had promulgated an ordinance to this effect in December 2005.

 Tabling the Bill, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said several township projects are coming up in the state, implemented by agencies like CMDA, Hidco, ADDA and SJDA.

 Townships are coming up at Siliguri, Asansol, Haldia, Dankuni and West Howrah as well. These are at the construction stage.

 ?As the areas are under panchayats, the agencies are facing problems in regulating building activity in the new townships. A panchayat has no power to frame building rules. Only municipalities enjoy that power and the new rules will ease the problems,?? he told the House.

 The amendment states that any development authority or planning body engaged in the construction of a township can frame building rules and sanction plans. These planning bodies will enjoy these powers till a township gets an elected civic body. Hidco and CMDA have been declared planning bodies.

 The government took this initiative with an eye to New Town, the largest township in the state. Hidco allotted over 5,000 residential plots to individuals and cooperatives, but not a single owner could start construction for want of a set of building rules and a sanctioning authority. 

 Although Hidco is the implementing agency, it did not have the authority to frame building regulations.

 Under pressure from plot-owners, housing minister and Hidco chairman, Goutam Deb approached the urban development minister to amend the Town and Country (Planning and Development) Bill. 

 ?Land-owners of New Town will enjoy the immediate benefits of the new rules, as people are waiting to start construction on their plots,?? Bhattacharya said.

 Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy said the government was acquiring farm land and handing it over to promoters and private developers in the name of building townships. ?If the government does not change its policy on urbanisation, the state will lose agricultural land, which will lead to loss of foodgrain and agri-production,?? Roy said.

 ?After the Bill is passed, the problems which we have been facing in framing building regulations will be over. We have already finalised the building rules and plot-owners can start construction within a couple of months,?? said Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathi.

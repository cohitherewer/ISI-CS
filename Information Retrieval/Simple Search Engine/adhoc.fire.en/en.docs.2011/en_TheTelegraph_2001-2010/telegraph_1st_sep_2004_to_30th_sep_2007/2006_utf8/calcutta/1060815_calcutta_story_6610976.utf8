 A Tricolour 

 is two meals

 When the Tricolour is hoisted at various official functions around the country on Tuesday morning, little Anita, Bablu and Sheela will still be running after cars at the Southern Avenue traffic signal, trying desperately to sell one last miniature national flag clutched in tiny grimy hands.

 Hum nahin jante pandrah August ko kya hua tha, says teenager Sheela, with a smile. She speaks for her younger siblings Anita, 4, and Bablu, 5. The three dont know what happened on August 15 or who a certain Mahatma Gandhi was. All they know is that they have to sell as many flags as they can before another August 15 becomes history.

 Humko bola gaya hai ki yahi jhanda pandrah August ko bikta hai, explains Sheela.

 And it is only to sell such memorabilia that Sheela, Anita, Bablu and some 15 others descend every August from Sawai Madhopur, in Rajasthan. They huddle under a makeshift plastic cover on Southern Avenue for about a week to prepare and sell I-Day items.

Mira, one of the elderly women accompanying the kids, says they manage to make and sell no less than 2,000 flags for Rs 10-15 each. 

 So, it makes good business sense to keep coming down to Calcutta for a few days, to wave the flag and win two meals a day, 59 years after Independence.

 Sunita, 6, and her 10-year-old sister Seema have that and more to look forward to, thanks to this Independence Day. For, on August 16, their father Dharam Singh, who hawks this and that on the streets, has promised to take them to the nearest market in Howrah and buy them some new clothes and some sweets.

 This would be their thanksgiving gift for selling Independence Day memorabilia at Park Circus. 

 In three days, we have sold more than 600 flags, several packets of balloons and tricolour caps. Our father is very happy with us, chirps Sunita, drenched by the Monday afternoon downpour that slowed down sales.

 For little Sunita, the Tricolour means a happy father, a new dress and some sweets.

 The flag of freedom sure flies high.

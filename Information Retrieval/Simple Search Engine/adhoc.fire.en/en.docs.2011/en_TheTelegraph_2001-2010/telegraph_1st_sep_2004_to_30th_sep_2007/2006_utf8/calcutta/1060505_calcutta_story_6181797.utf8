 Meat inspectors face fury

 The civic authorities have sought police help for inspecting meat shops in Calcutta. 

 The food inspectors are reportedly reluctant to visit the shops without cops after two of them were recently driven away by chopper-wielding butchers while examining the meat being sold in Lake Market and Entally.

 The inspectors were preparing a status report on the meat shops, after mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya expressed dissatisfaction over the way they functioned. He said that most of the meat shops were not adhering to the civic guidelines and selling meat in an unhygienic manner. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay had asked the civic health department to submit the status report on the shops selling mutton, pork, beef and chicken before enforcing a civic code.

 ?The chief municipal health officer has discussed the issue of police protection with me. I will be writing to the commissioner of city police and the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, asking for their assistance,? said Bandyopadhyay on Thursday.

 According to the civic health department, only 40 per cent of the meat shops in Calcutta follow the civic guidelines. There are over 2,500 mutton and beef shops in the city. The number of chicken shops is more than 10,000.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act, 1980, bans the slaughter of animals in private and open areas. According to the civic code, meat shops should be paved with glazed tiles and smoked glass should be used to protect the meat from fumes and dust. 

 To keep a tab on the quality of meat, the CMC has set up a laboratory and is planning to regularly collect samples for tests.

 After submission of the status report, the health department will set a deadline for the butchers to remodel their shops in conformity with the civic guidelines. In case of a rule-flout, licences will be cancelled, a senior CMC official warned.

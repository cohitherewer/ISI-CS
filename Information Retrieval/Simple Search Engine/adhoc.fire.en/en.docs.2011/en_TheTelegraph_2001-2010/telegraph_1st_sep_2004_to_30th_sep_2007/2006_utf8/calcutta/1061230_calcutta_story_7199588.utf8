 Protector turns predator

 - Police officers wife protests harassment over rape probe 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Double trouble is what Meera (name changed on request) finds herself in. The wife of a Calcutta Police officer who was allegedly raped by three men in Delhi in March after she befriended them on the Net, is now being hounded by a man in uniform in her hometown.

 Yet to recover from the earlier trauma, the 41-year-old has complained of harassment by an officer of the detective department.

 Meera stays with her husband and two children in south Calcutta. She was being summoned repeatedly to Lalbazar, the city police headquarters, and asked uncomfortable questions. Last month, she was even taken on a date by the officer.

 The distraught woman has shot off letters to senior officers about her predicament. My life has become very difficult since I lodged a complaint of rape with the detective department. They have been calling me every now and then, asking a whole lot of unnecessary questions. Last month, one of the officers asked me to meet him at Lalbazar at 3 pm. He said that my presence was needed for the investigation of the case, she said.

 As soon as I reached, he asked me to recount all that had happened in Delhi. He then asked whether I was having any extra-marital affair. After half an hour, the officer asked me to accompany him to a restaurant. There, he made advances but I protested and left in a hurry, she added.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), refused comment: Right now I cannot disclose anything. An investigation is on.

 The woman, who works as a personal assistant with a private firm in the city, had met three Delhi men while chatting on the Net in January. When Meera went to attend a friends wedding in March, she met up with them. The men took her to a flat, allegedly raped her and photographed her. They later kept threatening her. 

 And now, she fears falling prey to those she has turned to for protection.

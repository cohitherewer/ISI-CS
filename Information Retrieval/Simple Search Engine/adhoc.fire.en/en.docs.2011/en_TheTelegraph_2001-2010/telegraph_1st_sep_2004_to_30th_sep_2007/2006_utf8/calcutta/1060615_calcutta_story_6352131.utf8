The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 The longest day

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 The Cha Bar at Oxford Bookstore 

 or Swabhumi, The Atrium Cafe at The Park or the Princeton 

 Club, Gary Lawyer or a DJ-and-crooner combo from France? 

 June 21 will be a busy day filled with tough ? but happy 

 ? choices for music lovers in Calcutta.

 The third edition of Fete de la Musique (World Music Day), organised by The French Association with The Park, is readying a line-up of musicians across genres, languages and ages, at venues dotting the city, on the longest day of the year.

 Kicking off proceedings on the Wednesday afternoon would be Paul Mullick on saxophone at Flurys, followed by students of The French Association singing French songs.

 Young bands C..D (at Planet M) and Eyeris (at Cha Bar) then take the baton and pass it on to students of Calcutta School of Music and the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra.

 Some more young sounds follow, including Camouflage (at the Park Street Barista), The Hobos (at Swabhumi) and Span (at INOX City Centre).

 The bigger stars would come out 

 at night, with Gary Lawyer and Hip Pocket taking the Someplace 

 Else stage, French singer Hanna Hais rocking Roxy and DJ 

 David Chong working his magic at the Tantra turntable. The 

 latest CDs of Hais and Chong would also be released at The 

 Park.

 The World Music Day is getting bigger and bigger in Calcutta. The number of venues has increased and there is much greater interest in the event with people actually coming up to us and asking about it, said Nicolas Blasquiez, director of The French Association.

 The music celebration had started in France in 1982. The past two decades have seen the festival spread to countries around the world.

 In France, its more an open-air affair. Every municipality organises something there. Maybe someday we can do the same here, too, hoped Blasquiez.

 Besides Calcutta, the event is being celebrated in over 15 Indian cities, Blasquiez added.

 Railway Week on track

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The South Eastern Railway (SER) on Monday inaugurated its Railway Week on the occasion of the centenary celebration of its headquarters building in Garden Reach.

 SER?s general manager V.K. Raina said the celebration had assumed a greater significance, as the railways had transported a record 85.90 million tonnes of freight during 2005-06, registering a 17.5 per cent growth over the previous year. ?We are aiming at a century (transporting 100 tonnes),? Raina said. 

 The earning from the freight in 2005-06 touched Rs 3,979, against Rs 3,030 crore in 2004-2005.

 The chief guest of the programme, Russi Mody, highlighted the contribution of the railways to industrial development in the country. ?When I came to this part of India in my youth, the Indian Railway was a major and highly economic mode of transportation. It still enjoys the status.?

 The Railway Week celebration will continue till April 16. Fifteen stalls, displaying various heritage items of SER, have been set up in the compound of the headquarters building, popularly known as BNR Building. 

 The building, which housed the headquarters of the erstwhile Bengal Nagpur Railway, was unveiled on April 10, 1906. 

 Raina said the railways are a lucrative business. ?Like all successful businesses, we take our customers? conveniences as our paramount responsibility,? he pointed out.

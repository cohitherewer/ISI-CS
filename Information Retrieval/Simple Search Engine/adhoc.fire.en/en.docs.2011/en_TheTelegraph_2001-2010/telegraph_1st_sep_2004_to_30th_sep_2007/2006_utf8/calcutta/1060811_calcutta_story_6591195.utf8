The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Late entrant in swift swell mode

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 It has been late in logging on to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, but Capgemini, the $8-billion information technology (IT) services conglomerate seems to be in a hurry to make up for the lost time and scale up its operations in Calcutta. 

 The Calcutta centre started operations in April and at present, has a headcount of 200-odd. By the end of this calendar year, the strength is expected to touch 500 and by end 2007, the headcount will zoom up to 2,000. 

 Our experience here has been beyond all expectations. The government has been proactive and the people have been phenomenal. The quality of manpower, well-versed in Java, J2EE, Mainframe and SAP technologies, has been as good as anywhere else in India and the work ethic has been great, said Sripada Chandrasekhar, vice-president, people relationship management, Capgemini. 

 The company, headquartered in Paris, offers a gamut of IT services, such as consulting, outsourcing, technology and professional services. Indian operations are critical to the company, which has just bagged a significant portion of the $7.5-billion contract outsourced by General Motors.

 Expansion in Calcutta is part of the India strategy, where business has grown exponentially in the past few years. 

 In India, we expect to have a workforce of over 10,000 by 2007, and were already halfway there, added Chandrasekhar. Capgemini has 30 centres across the country, and in India, it has operations in Mumbai, Bangalore and Calcutta. The centres follow a portfolio approach, so they can undertake client-specific tasks. 

 Besides the delivery centre in Salt Lakes Sector V, Capgemini is planning a second facility in the city. But it is not scouting for land to build its own campus. 

 We dont follow that model. Rather we prefer the ready-made office space model, said Chandrasekhar, while refusing to disclose any specific timeframe with regard to its second centre.

 As a part of its operational strategy for India, Capgemini has embarked on a Rs 10-crore branding and marketing initiative, aimed at increasing its corporate profile in the country.

 Rigorous jail term for rape of staff

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A former deputy general manager of a private firm was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for eight years on Thursday for raping a subordinate nine years ago.

 The judgment was delivered by Bankshal court magistrate Nirod Ranjan Ghosh. He also directed the convict to pay a fine of Rs 50,000. The money will be handed over to the woman?s family.

 Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh said Shahnawaz Khan, then in his mid-40s, had raped the 24-year-old at gunpoint.

 ?It was Sunday, June 29, 1997. The office was closed. Khan telephoned the woman, saying there was some urgent work and she would have to come to the firm. She was initially reluctant, but agreed after some time since she could not disobey her boss?s orders,? Singh stated.

 The woman came to the office around 10.40 am. ?During the course of the investigation, she told the police officers that she became wary after she discovered that there was no other staff member in the office except her,? Singh added.

 However, when Khan summoned her to his chamber, she thought it was for taking a dictation or holding a discussion on the company?s business. ?As soon as the woman entered the chamber, Khan locked the door and took out a revolver. He held the gun to her head and raped her,? the deputy commissioner continued.

 Police began the investigation after the woman lodged a complaint on July 2. ?We arrested Khan on July 8 and collected all the evidence to prove his crime,? said an officer of women?s grievance wing of the detective department.

 After over eight years of hearings, the case was referred to the fifth fast track court. ?The magistrate was convinced once he went through the evidence,? the officer added.

 Probe into tour scam accused?s links abroad

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police have decided to probe the dealings that travel scam accused Indranil Mitra had with a host of travel agencies in Europe.

 After being on the run for days, Indranil and his father Pannalal were arrested early on Tuesday. Indranil, owner of Endeavour Holiday, was arrested in Mumbai and flown to the city late on Tuesday. Pannalal was produced before a city court on Tuesday and was remanded in police custody.

 After producing Indranil in Bankshal court on Wednesday, detective department officers said that they would interrogate Indranil and Pannalal separately. 

 The cops added that Indranil?s version was quite different from what Pannalal said. 

 ?There are inconsistencies in Indranil?s version about how he had planned the trip to Germany. We need to look into the facts and crosscheck them to find the truth,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Among Indranil?s alleged victims were 32 football lovers, who had paid Rs 1.5 lakh each, to catch the matches live in Germany. 

 A Zurich-based travel agency moved a petition in a city court on Tuesday, alleging that Indranil had cheated it of Rs 26.34 lakh by producing forged bank documents.The chief metropolitan magistrate has directed the city police to probe the charges.

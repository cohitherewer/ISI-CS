 Gaping at danger: Missing links of 

 Howrah bridge. Pictures by Amit Datta

 lThe army?s effort to encourage Bengalis to join the force is laudable but how could a senior officer dare to state that Bengalis do not want to join the army for fear of going to battle? (On offer, army jobs, May 15). 

 Indian historians may cleverly consign the Khudiram Boses, Bagha Jatins and Surya Sens to oblivion, but the fact remains that as far as sacrificing lives for the sake of freedom is concerned, Bengali youths were way ahead of other ethnic groups. 

 The Indian National Army, which shook the foundation of the British Empire, was led by none other than a certain Bengali named Subhas Chandra Bose. 

 From the two World Wars, Indo-Pak wars of 1948, 1965 and 1971 and India-China war of 1962 to the Kargil war, umpteen Bengalis have laid down their lives to defend the country?s sovereignty. The rest of the country can learn from Bengalis what bravery is all about. 

 Each and every community has its preferred professions. While Marwaris and Gujaratis go for trade and commerce, Sikhs and Gurkhas prefer to join the armed forces. Similarly, Bengalis and Tamils like to excel in academics, arts and sciences. This is precisely the reason why the percentage of Bengalis in the army or in business is low. 

 Thanks to the dwindling of jobs in the service sector, Bengalis are looking for greener pastures in the army. If the army is sincere in wooing Bengalis, why doesn?t it set up a Bengal regiment? 

 Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur. 

 Apropos the report ?Mind the gap or go into Hooghly?, May 9, it is unfortunate that deathtraps are lurking on the Howrah bridge due to lack of maintenance. 

 Since last year, the bridge has been suffering the consequences of mismanagement. The hit by the barge and the lunatic?s ascent to the top are pointers to official neglect. If the government remains unconcerned, a tragedy will occur any day. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

 It is alarming to learn that there 

 are at least four open holes on the Howrah bridge?s southern 

 footpath. A teenager from Delhi lost his life by slipping 

 through such a hole around two decades back. The authorities 

 should immediately undertake repairs. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia.

 Apropos the report ?Joka sets out alone on Rs 90-cr campus revamp?, May 10, it is heartening that the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta is set to take up an expansion drive. What is praiseworthy is that the institute is utilising its own resources for the drive. Once completed, the upgrade will add a feather to the cap of the illustrious institution. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP Road . 

 As a lover of Bengali music, it gave me pleasure to know that Bhoomi will perform at the UN headquarters on July 12 this year (Folk tunes for global audience, May 8). The group has won the hearts of music-lovers in the rural areas. Its repertoire of folk tunes will create a huge impact among the audience abroad. Earlier, another Bengali band Chandrabindoo had toured several cities of the US. I wish Bhoomi all the success on their foreign tour. 

 Bhupen Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the report ?Printer for the blind?, May 10, it is wonderful to know that some technology enthusiasts have developed a printer for the visually-challenged. The most important part of the innovation is that since the components are locally sourced, the gadget comes cheap. Unfortunately, the state government is not coming forward to help. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake. 

 In a civilised society, students are not supposed to be punished in a cruel manner, as is done in India (Girl jumps off school floor, May 11). Arachana Arora committed suicide due to the treatment meted out by her English teacher. The teachers should never forget the nobility of their vocation and treat their job like any other. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata. 

 The effort by a group of NGOs to get birth certificates issued for street children in the city is much needed (?Ahead, birth rights?, May 12). Parents of most of these children are illiterate and ignorant about the need for birth certificates. So when the certificates are handed over, they should be made aware of their importance. The NGOs should retain a copy. Similar steps should be taken for street children of the suburbs. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata. 

 Apropos the report ?Heart attack hits 20-plus age group?, May 8, it is alarming that cardiac problems and stomach disorders are being caused by work-related stress. Modern lifestyle is not conducive to healthy living. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum.

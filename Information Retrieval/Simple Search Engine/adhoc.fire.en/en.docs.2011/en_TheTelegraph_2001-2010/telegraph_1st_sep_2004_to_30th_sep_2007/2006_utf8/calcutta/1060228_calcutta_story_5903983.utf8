The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Student?s admit card restored

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shrabani Pal could not have written her Madhyamik English paper on Monday had police not come to her rescue.

 Shrabani left behind her admit card in a minibus on the Birati-BBD Bag route, that she boarded in Dakshindari on her way to the examination centre near Girish Park. She realised her mistake after entering the centre, Singhibagan High School, and called the cops.

 Moments before the exam bell, the admit card was returned to her.

 ?The girl did not lose her cool and called the Lalbazar control room for help,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters).

 The only information she could provide was the route of the bus and the place and time she got off. Officers immediately passed on the information to the traffic control room, from where it was circulated among all traffic sergeants on duty. 

 Sergeant T.K. Manna spotted the bus at BBD Bag. He searched the vehicle and found the admit card under a seat.

 Manna immediately handed over the document to Reserve Force inspector Rajat Kishan, who hit headlines a few years ago after intercepting minister Asok Bhattacharya?s vehicle during a cricket match at Eden Gardens.

 ?The exam was to start in 20 minutes. Rajat took just half the time to reach the school,? said Sharma. ?He saw the girl standing outside the school, fearing she would not be allowed to sit for the test.?

 Shrabani ran in as soon as she got back the admit card.

 Billboard ban in wetlands

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities have decided to ban billboards in the wetlands on the city?s eastern fringes. According to a civic estimate, there are about 150 billboards, some of them huge, in the wetlands bordering EM Bypass and along the Park Circus connector. 

 ?The mayoral council has approved the decision. We will not allow billboards even on floats in the waterbodies,? stated municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 ?The pulling down of several billboards will affect the civic coffers, but the matter should not be decided in terms of money. We will cover the loss by rationalising our billboard policy,? added Bandyopadhyay.

 The heritage committee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had advocated the ban. A guideline for its implementation is yet to be framed.

 Chief municipal architect and town planner Anindya Karforma has been directed to carry out a survey of billboards on waterbodies in the municipal area and submit a list mentioning the advertising agencies that erected them.

 The revenue loss per year due to the billboard ban in the central business district and on the city?s eastern fringes will be to the tune of Rs 7.5 crore.

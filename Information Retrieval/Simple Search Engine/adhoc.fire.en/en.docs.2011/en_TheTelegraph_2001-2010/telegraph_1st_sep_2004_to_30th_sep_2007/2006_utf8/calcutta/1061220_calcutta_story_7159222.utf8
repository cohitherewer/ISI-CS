 With winter vacations round the corner, The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS) has lined up a treat for the young ones in the form of a book fair, exclusively for children. The fair was inaugurated at Salt Lakes Bidhannagar Fair Grounds on December 17.

 After launching Childrens Book Fair, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee was all praise for the effort. Books are, indeed, the dearest and most loyal friends of man and we find ourselves returning to our favourite books over and over again, he said.

 Knowledge has no fixed language or medium and can even be imparted to children through interesting characters and stories, he continued. 

 Chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality Biswajiban Majumdar appealed to parents to encourage the young ones to look beyond text books. When we were children, we used to read many books. Children today are more interested in television. Parents should read out stories to their kids and inculcate positive habits in them. Only then can they grow up to become citizens whom the country can be proud of, he said. 

 Also present at the inauguration were industrialist Harsh Neotia, state information technology minister Debesh Das, poet Nirendranath Chakraborty and painter Shuvaprasanna. 

 The fair consists of 200 stalls, selling books brought out by 40 publishers, stationery, toys and utility items for students. Debates, elocution contests and music and dance programmes will be held as part of the fair. Counselling sessions for parents and children are also on the cards. The fair will continue till December 26.

 Chatterjee also launched a Salt Lake handbook, compiled by Bidhannagar Bikash Mancha, at the opening ceremony. The handbook provides detailed data on the township, including sector-wise maps and addresses and telephone numbers of banks, educational institutes and restaurants. 

 Chairman of Childrens Book Fair Justice (retired) G.N. Ray concluded the opening ceremony with his address. Books are a major draw even in other fairs. A book fair for children had been on our minds for a long time. We hope that our effort goes a long way in developing young minds.

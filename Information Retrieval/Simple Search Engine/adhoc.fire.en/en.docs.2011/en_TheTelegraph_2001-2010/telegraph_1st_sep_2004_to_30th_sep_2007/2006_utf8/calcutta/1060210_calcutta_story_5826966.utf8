The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Safety lies in unity, say traders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 United we stand, divided we fall. This is the motto adopted by Burrabazar?s businessmen in their battle against the bullies hounding the area.

 Members of Onkar Chitpur Vyabsayik Samity ? the outfit formed in 1996 to drive out criminals from the trade hub ? adopted a resolution on Thursday urging all other traders? bodies in the area to form a common platform to take the fight to the goons.

 ?We are holding discussions with the other unions, who are responding,? said P.R. Goenka, president of the Samity. ?There are more than 100 unions in the Burrabazar -Posta area. If they all stand united, no criminal can create any trouble here.? 

 The unity move comes close on the heels of the assault on Haribansh Rai, vice-president of the Samity, by armed men on Saturday night in full public view. Revolver-butt blows were rained on Rai?s face and chest.

 ?The attack on Rai was a threat message from the criminals. They want to turn the area into a terror zone, just like it was five years ago,? alleged Goenka.

 After a series of protest meetings by members of the Samity and a sustained campaign by Metro, police finally rounded up Vivek Srestha, Shahid Alam and Zahid Hussain in the Rai assault case from the Howrah station premises late on Wednesday.

 ?They were fleeing to Patna, after having taken refuge in various local hideouts. Their names had been mentioned in the complaint lodged by Rai with Burrabazar police,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 On interrogation, police came to know that the trio was in the Burrabazar-Posta area till two days after the attack. 

 ?They were holed up in a house on Cotton Street,? said an officer of Burrabazar police station.

 Police are looking for six others who had a hand in the attack. ?Following these arrests, we are confident of busting the crime network in the Burrabazar belt,? added the officer.

 As police finally get their act together, the traders are determined to safeguard their business and their lives.

 Elaborating on the move to bring all unions under one umbrella, Nirmal Nangalia, member of the Vyabsayik Samity, said: ?For the past five years, life in Burrabazar has been peaceful. We are trying to convince other associations to unite in the battle against criminals staging a comeback in the area. This will not only ensure the safety and security of the 1,000 Samity members, but also of others settled in the Burrabazar-Posta area.?

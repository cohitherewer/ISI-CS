 It will not be ready before November, but Tapas Sens promise to make Howrah bridge shimmer in all its glory was renewed on Wednesday.

 A trial for the scheme was conducted after sundown by the organisations involved Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and Philips India Ltd. Only one-eighth of the equipment installed was put to use and 46 kw of electricity consumed, but the effect was spectacular. 

 The trial was for the basic of the three-tier lighting arrangement (the other two being lighting for weekends and festive lighting for special occasions), said Sudeshna Mukhopadhyay, chief designer of the Philips team.

 As switches were turned on at the Calcutta Port Trust control station near Posta, a fascinating drama of light and shade unfolded. The giant, imported Archavision search lights at the base of the pylons caught the silver-textured surface of the bridge in its white light, as blue Light Emitting Diodes went on along the topmost edge of the landmark structure.

 Tapas Sens son Joy has been working on the project as artistic consultant, since his fathers death.

 More cabling and rearranging of lights are required before the white, magenta and yellow lights can be turned on, said CPT chairman A.K. Chanda.

 nEmergency numbers: The numbers for CESCs round-the-clock emergency service during the Pujas are 9831083700 and 9831079666.

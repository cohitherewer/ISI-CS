The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Central green panel visits mega projects

 JAYANTA BASU

 The environment impact assessment committee of the Union ministry of environment and forest, entrusted with clearing mega housing and infrastructure projects, was recently in town for a spot assessment of 13 such projects in Calcutta and across Bengal. 

 The projects have received no-objection certificates from the state pollution control board but construction can start only after the Union ministry issues the final clearance, which is still pending.

 That is the rule for all mega projects, ones that meet any of the three criterion ? investment of Rs 50 crore or more, housing capacity for 1,000 families or more, and daily effluent discharge of 50,000 litres or more.

 The committee, however, found that some of the project proponents, in violation of rules, have started construction. ?We visited four sites on Thursday and found that construction has started at two without the central approval. At one place, construction is 40 per cent complete,? said N.H. Hosabettu, member-secretary of the panel and director in the ministry.

 ?We asked the violators to stop construction immediately. The ministry will act only after the committee submits its findings and recommendations? We are here to take a first-hand stock of the projects,? the official said.

 Some of the projects, residential as well as commercial, the committee visited are scheduled to come up on Tiljala Road, Diamond Harbour Road, Beleghata Main Road, Kabitirtha Sarani, APC Road, Raja SC Mullick Road, Gurusaday Road, Ho Chi Minh Sarani and Binobha Bhave Road.

 Metro visited a few projects on Saturday and found work was in progress.

 The project proponents argued before the panel during its three-day stay in the city that construction started only after they received a no-objection certificate from the state green board and after completion of the mandatory public hearing. Hosabettu and his colleagues, however, rubbished the excuse.

 ?It would have been better if the state board had stopped construction on its own,? said a member of the nine-member panel.

 Board chairman Sudip Banerjee claimed: ?While giving the provisional no-objection certificate, we had made it clear to the project proponents that they could start construction only after obtaining the central clearance.?

 Senior law officer of the board Biswajit Mukherjee said: ?We have already slapped stop-work notices on a few housing projects where construction had started without the central clearance. Besides, FIRs have been lodged against the proponents.? 

 On the Calcutta visit, Hosabettu said: ?We have come here to hold a regular meeting of the committee. Meetings were earlier held in Mumbai and Bangalore. The decision to come to Calcutta was taken as the number of building proposals from the region has increased sharply.?

 He, however, admitted that the such visits have a ?shaking effect on unscrupulous elements in the business?.

 ?We only hope that central or state, any green agency will pass proper strictures and ensure their implementation. Violations should not be swept under the carpet,? said an environmentalist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sector V gears to beat bandh

 - Stay on overnight, log in before 6 am

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Yesterdays mantra: do what Bangalore does, work 24x7.

 Todays mantra: Dont do on Monday what Bangalore did last Wednesday. 

 Bangalore was logged out as pro-Kannadiga agitators forced a total shutdown on October 4, the second time in six months, causing loss of both revenue and face for business addresses in IT town.

 But Trinamul Congress, which has called a 12-hour bandh on Monday, will find it difficult to force a repeat of Bangalore in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, with the IT sector determined to fly its business-as-usual flag.

 On October 9, we will try to get our employees in before 6 am. Besides, we are making arrangements to put up around 100 of our employees in Salt Lake to ensure they can report to work the next day, said a Tata Consultancy Services official in Sector V.

 Most of the IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) companies have sent out messages to their employees to treat Monday as a normal working day. 

 Our clients do not know about bandhs. All of us will report to work, stressed D.K. Choudhury, CEO, Skytech Solutions.

 Even the food supply chains, feeding over 20,000 techies in 150-plus firms of Sector V, have been activated to defy the bandh diktat. Weve been told it will be a normal working day. We will not take any chances and our team will stay back, said an official of ABNM Restaurants, food supplier to several Sector V canteens.

 The authorities are also gearing up to do their bit from deploying extra force to sealing entry and exit points of Salt Lake. The strike will not affect work, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman, Nabadiganta, the fledgling municipal body.

 The IT department has, however, decided not to distribute essential services stickers to companies this time. The stickers unnecessarily draw attention There will be enough protection for those willing to go to work, said IT secretary Siddharth.

 CITU, which had forced a Sector V shutdown on September 29 last year, has vowed to lend a helping hand to provide smooth passage to the techies. We oppose this bandh. Our boys will be out on the streets to help the common man, said Kali Ghosh, general secretary, CITU.

 Footnote: If you feel Mondays the best day to bunk work and spend time at the multiplexes, dont book your seats just yet. For, the plexes are in wait-and-watch mode and may decide to open only after 6 pm on bandh day.

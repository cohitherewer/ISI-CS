 An officer and a gentleman

 - Samaritan sergeant saves teenaged hawker lying senseless on pavement

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A traffic sergeant played Good Samaritan on Friday afternoon when he rescued a 14-year-old boy lying unconscious on a Chowringhee pavement in full public view for over half an hour. The officer, Samir Diwari, hired a taxi and took Ilarappan, a street hawker, to the nearest hospital, where he was admitted and revived.

 What Diwari found shocking was that pedestrians were walking past the boy, without sparing him a second glance. Worse still, a motley group was standing at a distance and watching the scene, inert. 

 It was around 12.30 pm when Diwari noticed the boy, in tattered clothes, lying on his back on the pavement of the Park Street-JL Nehru Road crossing, a few feet from his food stall that sells idli and vada.

 The sergeant was on his daily rounds. ?He requested the pedestrians to help him take the boy to a taxi. No one came forward. In fact, the small group disappeared within a minute,? said an officer of Park Street police station.

 Diwari then lifted the boy in his arms, hailed a taxi and went to Assembly of God Church Hospital. ?Seeing Ilarappan?s condition, the authorities admitted him immediately,? said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 Doctors found during a check-up that the boy was suffering from high fever. ?Ilarappan later told Diwari that he had left home with a high temperature. He felt giddy while manning the stall and slumped to the pavement. According to a witness, he lost consciousness immediately. Some people rushed to him, but walked away as soon as they realised that the boy was unconscious,? said Shamim.

 Diwari waited at the hospital till Ilarappan regained his senses. He asked him his address and informed his parents, who live in Kidderpore. The good cop left only after the parents arrived.

 ?Not just policemen, but all residents of the city should learn from Diwari?s deed,? deputy commissioner Shamim said.

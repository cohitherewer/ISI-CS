 The sensible insane

 A satiric comedy exposing the invisible borderline between sanity and madness, Mister Kakatua is a bitter testament of the truth that in modern society, so-called worldly wisdom is but a cover for meanness, selfishness and chicanery. Exasperated with her brothers friendship with an imaginary cockatoo, a lady decides to take psychiatric help. However, misled by the genteel, polished behaviour of the man and the high-strung attitudes of the woman, the doctors think the latter to be their patient. Finally, when the confusion is cleared, they assure the sister that her brother would be given a dynamic, new method of treatment and, when cured, would become absolutely normal like any other person. This makes the sister review her decision to cure her brother, for she knows that normal people like herself and her husband are self-seeking, exploitative and corrupt, unlike those considered insane. She takes her brother home, leaving the audience to speculate whether it is actually better to be insane. Direction: Kumar Roy.

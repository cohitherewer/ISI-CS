 Yash and Manjari in Faltu

 A short story?s long journey to the celluloid is the topic of a talk revolving around Anjan Das?s forthcoming release Faltu, produced by Planman Motion Pictures. The discussion ? Chhoto Galpo, Boro Pordaye ? will dwell on the scope and problems of adapting a short story into a feature-length screenplay at Oxford Bookstore, 4 pm, on January 19. 

 The panel features writers Shirshendu Mukherjee, Bani Basu and Dibyendu Palit, Roopkala Kendra director Sanjay Mukherjee and the film?s director. Rituparno Ghosh will moderate the session.

 Faltu is based on Syed Mujtaba Siraj?s short story Ranirghater Brittanto. The story starts in 1951 when a mad woman (played by Indrani Halder) takes shelter at Ranirghat, a habitation of some uprooted people. There, she is raped by five men from the village and later gives birth to Faltu. Twenty years after that, the past comes calling as Faltu embarks on a journey of self-identity.

 Slated for a February 10 release, the film also stars Yash Pandit and Manjari Fadnis, who had debuted in Rok Sako To Rok Lo, and Soumitra Chatterjee. Faltu has been shot on location in Behrampore and in Sian, a village near Santiniketan. 

 The plot is nothing short of a Hollywood blockbuster. The mission is to crack and clean out the Las Vegas casino coffers and the protagonists are some of the least likely hustlers in Vegas history ? a diminutive woman who fleeced casinos and cheats alike; a man with an IQ of 169; an MBA from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration; a young, ambitious, straitlaced MIT math professor obsessed with computing...

 Premiering on January 19 at 9 pm on The History Channel, Breaking Vegas promises to bring alive the inside story of some of the greatest gambling scams in history.

 The 13-part series takes viewers into the world of those who cracked the casino system. Sometimes they got away with it, and sometimes the odds ? and the law ? caught up with them.

 Dramatic re-enactments bring to light the interesting lives of the gamblers who were ambitious and armed with complex gadgets but were chased, blacklisted and gunned down by sheriffs and casino toughs.

 Tune in every Thursday at 9 pm to catch up with the greatest conmen out to bust the casino system.

 In the jungle of television channels and 24x7 programming, Animal Planet is trying to introduce some discipline. On Wednesday, the ?world?s only channel devoted exclusively to the relationship between animals and human beings? announced the launch of distinct theme-based time bands for its programmes. Of them, there would also be a one-hour weekly slot exclusively for India-based shows.

 ?This will be a viewer-friendly schedule which will allow people to choose the kind of programmes they want to see and tune in during the specific time band. This way, one can be prepared for their kind of show on air at a stipulated time,? says Rajiv Bakshi, the channel?s corporate communications manager.

 On weekdays, one can have fun on all fours with Fun Zone at 8 pm, take a walk on the wild side in Safari at 9 pm, join Masters of the Jungle like Jeff Corwin, Steve Irwin, O?Shea and Austin Stevens in their breath-taking escapades at 10 pm and meet creatures of the dark in the rainforests of the Equator and in the depths of the Atlantic in Unexplained, Unexplored at 11 pm. The Friday 9 pm slot is for Indian Safari wherein the Royal Bengal tiger or the Asiatic lion holds court with local experts like Valmik Thapar. 

 ?Last year, we have done phenomenally well, increasing our viewership to 24 million,? claims Bakshi.

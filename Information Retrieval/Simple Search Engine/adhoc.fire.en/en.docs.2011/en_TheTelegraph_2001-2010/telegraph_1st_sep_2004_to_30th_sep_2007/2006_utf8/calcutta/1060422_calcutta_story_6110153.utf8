 Reflection 

 rules for the bedroom 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Feng Shui does not recommend mirrors on 

 a wall where our bodies are reflected while sleeping. 

 It is not considered auspicious to have them on a wall 

 where you would see yourself first thing in the morning 

 and last thing at night. Also, mirrors should never 

 reflect the door of the bedroom. Again, it should not 

 be placed on a wall where it reflects the bathroom door. 

 Q: 

 I have read in your column that mirrors should 

 not be hung in the bedroom where the body is directly reflected 

 while sleeping. But can I hang them on a wall where our 

 bodies will not be reflected?

 Sarika Agarwal

 The solution: Feng Shui is certainly against mirrors on a wall where our bodies are reflected while sleeping. Mirrors are powerful energy expanders and we should be very careful about their placement in the bedroom. 

 The basic principle is that mirrors should never reflect the bedroom door from where the cosmic energy flows in. If this energy gets reflected and bounces back instead of entering the room, it leaves the occupants starved of the nourishing chi. 

 Again, it should not be placed on any wall where it reflects the toilet door. Here it would multiply its negative energy.

 It is also not considered auspicious 

 to place them on a wall where you would see yourself first 

 thing in the morning and last thing at night. 

 Building bane 

 Q: 

 I live in a single-storied house that 

 has a big playground for children at the back and a tall 

 building in front. Recently, two highrise buildings have 

 come up on either side of my house. Ever since, there has 

 been a lot of unhappiness in the family due to ill health 

 and financial problems. Is there any way I can get out of 

 this situation?

 Suchitra

 The solution: It is your bad luck that your house has not only been sandwiched between two high buildings on either side but is also blocked by a tall one in front. Adding to this is a big playground on the back.

 Tall structures behind the house are considered auspicious because they give support to the house. And open areas are welcome in front where the chi energy gathers in abundance to flow into the house. Your house lacks support from behind and is confronted by a tall building in front that is symbolic of a mountain. This acts as an obstruction for the residents of the house. 

 Moreover, when the house is sandwiched between two tall buildings the energy gets suffocated and cannot move around freely. The best Feng Shui remedy in such cases is to install lights all around the boundary wall at regular intervals. Lights here will open up the tight areas created by the neighbouring tall buildings.

 Raise the height of the back wall 

 with a wrought iron fence and build tall metal or wooden 

 poles from behind the house. You can also plant tall trees 

 to give the support you are looking for and place bright 

 lights on the terrace to lift the otherwise restricted energy. 

 This should take care of your financial and health problems.

 Cut chaos 

 Q: 

 We moved into a new house two years 

 ago and since then have witnessed a sharp decline in our 

 business. As a result, my husband has totally lost his self-confidence 

 and feels that he will never be able to rise in life again. 

 A friend told us that this could be due to a major cut in 

 the northern part of our house. Do you think this could 

 be the reason? If yes, please suggest a remedy to overcome 

 this problem. 

 Geetika

 The solution: You must always look into the positive and negative qualities of a house before finalising the deal. Houses are lifetime assets and support us through good and bad times. Small cuts in any direction can be tolerated and remedied, but big cuts are very difficult to deal with. 

 The virtues of the ruling water energy of the northern sector, which is connected with our career and business, represents confidence, motivation, courage and enthusiasm. When this area falls out of the house, the water energy gets off-balance and the earning member of the family loses self-esteem. 

 When this area is stimulated, it helps regain our sense of worth and generate new ideas and career opportunities. Paint the internal northern wall in any shade of blue and place furniture and artefacts that are asymmetrical, irregular and free flowing in shape.

 Support this area with its mother 

 element metal by adding round metal objects like pots, plates, 

 bowls, vases, clocks and mirrors in white, copper, gold 

 and silver.

 Tide turn

 Q: 

 I was born on September 13, 1970, at 

 9 am in Calcutta. I am working in Muscat and am going through 

 acute financial crisis. I have worked with many companies 

 but have never been able to get a handsome salary with attractive 

 incentives. I am married and have a son. I am very worried 

 about the future. Please help.

 Lawrence Dessa

 The solution: Your pillars of destiny reveal that you are a fire person loaded with metal elements that represent wealth for you. Presently you are going through yang water period, which brings turmoil to your life. You will enter into the earth period in 2009, which represents your intelligence.

 This means that you will be able to generate lots of wealth through your creative elements and will continue to be in this period for the next 10 years.

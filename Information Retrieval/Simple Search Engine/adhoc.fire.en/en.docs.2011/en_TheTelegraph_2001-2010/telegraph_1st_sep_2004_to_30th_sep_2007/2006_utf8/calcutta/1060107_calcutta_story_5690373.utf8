 Liberal build rules for New Town

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Ending a long wait for thousands of plot-owners, Hidco has drawn up a draft of the building rules and regulations for New Town.

 Once finalised ? hopefully in a fortnight ? the Rajarhat township will become the third urban cluster in the state, after Calcutta and Salt Lake, to have independent building rules.

 And learning from the experience in Calcutta and Salt Lake, Hidco has made the rules ?liberal?, giving freedom to house-owners to use their buildings as they like.

 To start with, unlike in Salt Lake, there is no bar on floor height. In Salt Lake, the height of a building has to be commensurate with the size of the plot. In New Town, it will depend on the width of the road on which the plot is located. 

 Officials of Hidco, the implementing agency of New Town, said plot-owners would have enough permissible height and the maximum built-up area. One major advantage is that plot-owners can build a mezzanine floor and are free to appoint architects to prepare building plans.

 In another instance of departure from Salt Lake norms, Hidco will allow 10 per cent of the covered area for commercial use.

 ?We had kept in mind the problems in Salt Lake and Calcutta while preparing the rules,? said a senior official of Hidco. ?We have also taken suggestions from architects, engineers and city planners. The rules have been prepared in a way that plot-owners do not face any problem while building houses.?

 Another official pointed out: ?We will allow owners to put a part of the house to commercial use. Moreover, the area will remain vibrant if there are small shops, restaurants and cyber cafes.?

 Safety and comfort of the residents, too, had been factored in by the planners.

 Hidco has allotted over 5,000 residential plots to individuals and cooperatives, but not a single owner could start construction, as there was neither any building rule nor a sanctioning authority.

 Being the implementing agency, Hidco could procure land and develop it, build infrastructure and allot plots. But it did not have the authority to frame building rules.

 By a recent ordinance, the government has amended the Town and Country Planning Act and empowered Hidco to frame building rules and sanction plans for the Rajarhat township. The agency will cease to enjoy the right once New Town gets a civic authority.

 Housing minister and Hidco chairman Goutam Deb said engineers and architects engaged in drafting the rules had focussed on the needs of the people. ?We expect the rules will be made available to the public in a month,?? said a senior Hidco engineer.

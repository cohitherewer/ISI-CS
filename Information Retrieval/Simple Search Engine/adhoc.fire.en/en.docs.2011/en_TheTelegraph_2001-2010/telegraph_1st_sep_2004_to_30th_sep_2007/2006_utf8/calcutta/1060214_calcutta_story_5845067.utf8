 It's Your Birthday So...

 You?re a quick and eager learner, and this gives you the chance to pick up varied skills. Others are in awe of your fearlessness. You?re a perfect lover, taking care of all emotions and feelings of your partner. Checking your bank balance before making purchases is a good idea. Though your ideas are creative, keep yourself open to some positive criticism without getting dejected. You will never trample on someone to get your way. ? Kusum Bhandari

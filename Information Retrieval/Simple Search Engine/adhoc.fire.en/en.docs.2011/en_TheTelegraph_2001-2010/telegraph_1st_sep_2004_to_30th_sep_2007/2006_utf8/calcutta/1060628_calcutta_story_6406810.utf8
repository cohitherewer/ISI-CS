 Brides-to-be in dire distress

 - Wedding hall fails to pay dues, water and power lines cut

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 The invitations have been set out, the guests have arrived and the auspicious moment is hours away ? the wedding is on, but where is the venue?

 That is the question vexing families who had booked Rotunda, the banquet hall in Manikanchan, in Sector V, for weddings this week. 

 ?The building belongs to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) which had leased the fourth and the fifth floors to Techno Cart. The company failed to pay a particular sum to the WBIDC and on June 21, it issued a notification and disconnected the electricity and water connections to both the floors on June 26,? said a source in Techno Cart. The WBIDC refused comment.

 With the wedding season on and hall bookings done months in advance, families banking on the Manikanchan fourth floor have been left in the lurch. ?We had booked the auditorium for July 2 on April 18? With the electricity and water lines disconnected, how will the marriage take place? And how will we find an alternative venue at such short notice?? cried the father of a bride.

 ?I am running from pillar to post but getting hold of another wedding hall now is next to impossible. This will be such a huge embarrassment for the family, and for no fault of ours,? said G. Khandelwal, whose daughter was to have got married at Rotunda on June 29.

 The sudden loss of the wedding venue highlights the ?too many weddings and too few venues? syndrome plaguing not just Salt Lake, but the city at large. 

 ?The demand during the wedding season is huge. We have to turn down so many applications,? revealed a spokesperson for The Stadel, the stadium hotel that hosts more than 60 marriages in a season.

 ?The number of families in the township has grown by leaps and bounds. The community halls are not just not enough to match the demand. As a result, venues like the Rotunda, The Royal Bengal Room in City Centre, and Nalban Food Park are extremely popular,? said a member of the GD Block Resident?s Association.

 Shrouded in mythology, the Ganges is a part of the cultural fabric of the nation. Mighty cities have grown along its banks, among them Calcutta, once the seat of the British empire. 

 The event Ganges, organised by The Telegraph and Bharathidasan Institute of Management Trichy Alumni Association, aboard MV Sumangal on Saturday, was an attempt to recollect the history the river has been witness to.

 The launch ride on the Hooghly on the balmy evening saw Rudrangshu Mukherjee of The Telegraph, architect and urban planner Anjan Mitra and Presidency College professor Prasanta Ray speaking about the river that TS Eliot referred to as the brown god.

 As the vessel cut through the dark waters whose ripples reflected the glow of the full moon, the geography of the river was brought to life through recollections of events past. A dance performance by Tanusree Shankars troupe wrapped up the evening.

 While Mukherjee spoke about appropriation of the river as an icon by religious fundamentalists, Ray went back to the time he spent as a child on the banks of the river.

 Santanu Das, who teaches at the University of London, observed: In Europe, too, there are rivers, but one does not see so many people. You would not see a boy diving into the water. Our impression of the Ganga is tied up with religion, but it goes beyond communal sentiment. Rays words showed that politics should not overshadow emotional attachment.

 For others, like film-maker Rinita Banerjee, the event was an opportunity to reflect on the identity of the city as shaped by the river. She liked the overall presentation but admitted that she had expected a more detailed discussion.

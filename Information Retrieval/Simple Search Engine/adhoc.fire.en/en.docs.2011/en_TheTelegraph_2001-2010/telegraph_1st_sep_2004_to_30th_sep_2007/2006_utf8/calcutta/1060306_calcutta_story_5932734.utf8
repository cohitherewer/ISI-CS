After Germany and France, it?s now the turn of Japan to contribute to the cultural life of Calcutta. 

 The 21st Annual Cultural Function, Happyokai, organised by the Japanese language school Nihongo Kaiwa Kyookai, in association with the consulate-general of Japan, was held at Kala Kunj, the basement of Kala Mandir, on March 4.

 The idea of the programme was to incorporate all forms of arts, including poetry, music, drama and dance, both Indian, Japanese, and beyond.

 Addressing the gathering, Japanese consul-general in Calcutta Yoshikazu Takeuchi praised the ?increasingly strong relations between India and Japan? and said ?events such as this are valuable for maintaining such relations?.

 Japanese and Indian languages, however, were not the only ones that were celebrated at the show ? there were also performances by German and Italian language students of the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park.

 A selection of poems and songs by Rabindranath Tagore, read out in the original and also in German and English translations ? formed the backbone of the German students? performance, whilst the Italian students chose a popular Italian love song to sing.

 The best performances were yet to come, with the definite highlight being a performance by Japanese sitarist Hideyuki Iwai, who electrified the theatre with his smooth and rapid playing. 

 Iwai?s performance was followed by Megumi Hero Mitsu, who performed a repertoire of Kathak dance. 

 Halfway through her performance, she revealed: ?I have been learning Kathak for less than a year, so forgive me if I make many mistakes.? 

 She need not have worried, as her show was remarkably polished considering the time she has been learning the dance.

 The rest of the programme involved folk dances, a piece of the Japanese drama Tora ga kita and a song sung by students of Nihongo Kaiwa Kyookai.

 Scheme for civic levy 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Wednesday announced a self-assessment scheme for owners of unassessed and under-assessed properties. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the scheme, to be launched in April, is an attempt to widen the property tax net before the introduction of area-wise levy. 

 The civic bodys annual revenue loss due to buildings remaining unassessed or under-assessed is over Rs 200 crore. 

 The CMC will publish a schedule of rates per square foot of covered area in different parts of the city before the launch of the scheme. House-owners will be able to calculate their annual property tax using the schedule.

 It has not been decided whether the owners of unassessed buildings will have clear pending payments or will be offered a one-time exemption.

 According to a civic estimate, about 400,000 buildings and flats in the city are outside the purview of property tax or are under-assessed.

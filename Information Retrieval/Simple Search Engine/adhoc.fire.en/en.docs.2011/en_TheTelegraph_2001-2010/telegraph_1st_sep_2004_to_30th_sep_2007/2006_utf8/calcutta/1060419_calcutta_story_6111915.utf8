They are an urban couple ? he a teacher of English and she an editor in a publishing house. Yet, both have found in baul music a sense of peace and an expression of their spiritual quest. Meet Kaushik and Antara, whose debut performance was hosted by theatre group Samikhan at Gyan Manch on Poila Baisakh. 

 Senior stage designer Khaled Chaudhury introduced the two. An aficionado of Bengali folk music, he bemoaned the degeneration and loss of original tunes and lyrics, since baul is an oral tradition and there are no copyrights. Chaudhury praised Kaushik and Antara for striving to present only the ?authentic? and ?the traditional?. 

 Among other numbers, the husband-wife team sang the original versions of familiar pieces such as ?Rakhithe narili premo jal? and ?O jodi gur khabire nalin dana? in their debut performance. They sketched a journey from the physical to the spiritual, using images of rivers, boats, banks, roads, trees and flowers.

 Kaushik traced the origins of his passion for baul music to a 1988 visit to the Poush mela in Santiniketan. At Jadavpur University, the interest developed further, ?just because most of the people around me regarded it with scorn?.

 Wife Antara grew up ?with the usual Bengali girl?s diet of classical music and Rabindrasangeet?. She caught the baul bug from Kaushik.

 Over the past 15 years, the two have haunted melas and baul macchaps of every kind, sharing food and shelter with the singers just to listen to and record their live performances. ?Travelling across Nadia, north Bengal and Bangladesh, we have grown close to bauls like Paban Das, Subol Das, Gour Khepa, Kalachand Dorbesh and others who have helped us understand the allegories and underlying philosophy,? said Kaushik.

 ?In the age of globalisation, many will find solace in baul music because it is a part of our roots,? he added.

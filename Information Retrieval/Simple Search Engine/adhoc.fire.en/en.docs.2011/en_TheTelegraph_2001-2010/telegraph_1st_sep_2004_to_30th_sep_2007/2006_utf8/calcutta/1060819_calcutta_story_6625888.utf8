 He began at a time when the costume 

 designer was looked upon as a yes man of the hero. 

 Today, this costume director has a Yes Manish 

 team of stars, instead. 

 Been there and done that, says 

 the badshah of Bollywood fashion. And what completes 

 his list of 24 awards and more than 1,000 film assignments 

 is his chance to present the finale of Wills Lifestyle India 

 Fashion Week in New Delhi on September 3, something he feels 

 establishes his acceptance in mainstream 

 fashion. 

 His collection, Sensuality, will 

 show signature Manish elements full of colour, 

 textures and cuts and will, of course, be sensual to say 

 the least. Infused with grace and confidence, Manish is 

 sure that the ensembles will awaken the inner sensuality 

 of the wearer because his idea of success is to make 

 the person feel young and pretty.

 In town to kick-start the WLIFW 

 party, Manish Malhotra spoke to GoodLife about his 

 three favourite Fs food, fashion and films.

 I didnt get into fashion 

 because I liked films; it was very much the other way round, 

 says the man whose entire education, he admits, 

 has been films, films and more films. I passed with 

 grace marks all through and was horrendous in math. But 

 I was extremely creative. Fashion came naturally to me and 

 so I took up designing. My parents were aghast but I was 

 determined to do it through the Bollywood route instead 

 of the usual one, says the man who is happy 

 to have bridged the gap between Bollywood and mainstream 

 fashion. 

 The first filmi assignment 

 was with David Dhawan (who also happened to be his cousins 

 husband), with an outfit for Juhi Chawla for a song in Swarg. 

 Five years of struggle and then fame, finally. 

 Today, his fashion-film street 

 is silk smooth and he accepts a film only if it is very 

 different or involves a real challenge (read: a makeover). 

 Like I am giving Vidya Balan a brand new look for 

 Sajid Khans Hey Baby. Very not Parineeta 

 she is set for a modern, Western-but-not-sexy look. 

 Ditto for Ayesha Takia in Kya Love Story Hai where 

 he will change her look and make-up. 

 While on films, the buzz that 

 he had generated about a directorial debut has long suffered 

 an overkill. Initially, it was supposed to be a four-hero 

 dance film and I was talking to Hrithik, but then Krrish 

 went on the floors and the rest of the casting became 

 complicated. I decided to concentrate on my label for the 

 next two years and I am very satisfied on that front, 

 muses Manish. 

 He has every reason to be. With 

 a newly-opened flagship store in Dubai and another one in 

 Mumbai set for an October 2 launch, Manish, the label, is 

 on a roll. Lots of enquiries from New York, LA, San 

 Francisco, Cape Town are pouring in, he signs off.

 And heres the good news 

 for Calcutta: the much-wanted Manish label is coming to 

 a city store, next month.

 You share your birthday with...

 Ben Stiller, actor

 You are mentally alert and agile, and manage to work your way up the ladder. You are compassionate, but always practical. Though friendly, you tend to dominate when in positions of power. You understand the value of money but arent keen on budgeting. Usually, you are too timid to ask for help. You value time and never miss an opportunity. Kusum Bhandari

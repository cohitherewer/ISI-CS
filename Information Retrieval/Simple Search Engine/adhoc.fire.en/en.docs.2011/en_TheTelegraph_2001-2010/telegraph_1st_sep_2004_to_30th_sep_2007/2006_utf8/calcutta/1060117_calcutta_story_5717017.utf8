 A cluster of around 400 pre-fabricated buildings is coming up at Nonadanga, behind Ruby General Hospital, to relocate settlers along four drainage canals in the city. 

 The ?township? is being developed by the civic body, under Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, with funds from Asian Development Bank. 

 According to deputy municipal commissioner (finance) Deb Kumar Dwibedi, the Rs 23-crore project will benefit 3,200 families living on canal banks in Chowbhaga, Anandapur, Kalikapur, Purbachal, Garfa, Naskarhat, Jinjira Bazar, Sampa Mirza Nagar and Paschim Putiari. So far, 3,000 families have been identified for resettlement and issued identity cards. Each displaced family will get a flat of 187 sq ft. The dwellers will have to share community toilets. 

 Each flat ?1,280 will be built in the first phase ? will have floor made of pre-fabricated reinforced cement concrete channels and walls of rat trap/concrete hollow bricks. For the roofs, waterproof filler slabs have been prescribed. 

 Each building will cost Rs 97,000 and a beneficiary will have to share five per cent of the construction cost of a flat. Street lights in the area will be solar-powered.

 The pre-fabrication technique has been adopted as any other method would take much more than six months ? the time limit for wrapping up the project ? for constructing the 400 buildings. ?We have already invited tenders for construction. Use of pre-fabricated structures will speed up the resettlement process. The proposed revamp of drainage canals cannot be carried out unless the settlers are removed from the banks,? said project director Rajiv Sinha.

 According to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, the Nonadanga township is the largest resettlement project undertaken in the city by any public agency like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay announced that the pace of development in the ?hitherto unmotorable pockets? along the canals will be intensified once the 50-odd concrete bridges are commissioned by December.

 These will replace wooden and bamboo bridges at different points of Churial canal, Monikhali, TP Channel and Keorapukur. The project will cost Rs 18.2 crore.

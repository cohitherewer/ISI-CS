 At The Saturday Club, it?s an 

 all-action platter, Monday through Sunday, with a big-ticket 

 lease-rent deal swinging the finance fortunes of the Wood 

 Street haunt dramatically.

 The club authorities have rented 

 out the space on its top floor vacated by Tea Trading Corporation 

 of India (TTCI) to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). After 

 retaining the open terrace and 5,000 sq ft from the carpet 

 area of 15,390 sq ft, the rest will house RIL offices for 

 the first three years in the city.

 ?The annual amount receivable 

 from Reliance is Rs 74.13 lakh, compared to the Rs 6.25 

 lakh we used to get from TTCI for the entire area. This 

 agreement makes us self-reliant and gives us the leverage 

 to be choosy about fresh induction, since we are no longer 

 dependent solely on corporate renewals,? club president 

 Arjun De tells Metro.

 RIL had offered an annual rent 

 of Rs 74 lakh, in addition to a security deposit of six 

 months? rent. The proposal was placed before the general 

 committee on March 30. A resolution was moved and approved 

 to rent out the space to RIL on the terms offered by them.

 ?The main advantage of the deal 

 is that RIL will spend around Rs 1.5 crore to renovate and 

 upgrade the space. They will also instal their own air-conditioning 

 plant. Since the lease-rent period is of three years, the 

 club stands to benefit enormously because we get the space 

 back with fitments and the AC plant at a depreciated value,? 

 De points out.

 The club is hopeful there?ll be 

 other spin-offs as well. The Mukesh Ambani group company, 

 gearing up to come in with its agri-based large-format retail, 

 has also approached The Saturday Club management for rustling 

 up around 250 lunches for its staff every working day, which 

 the club is trying to outsource.

 ?Besides, they will be using our 

 banquets and guestrooms, resulting in more revenue,? says 

 a senior member and office-bearer. The president stresses 

 that the club has saved around Rs 12 lakh by not paying 

 any brokerage for the space rented out to RIL. A portion 

 of this amount will be spent to upgrade the kitchen and 

 the changing rooms.

 Kalyan Sarangi, chief executive 

 officer, RIL, confirms ?no broker has been involved from 

 any side and no brokerage paid?.

 While the RIL deal has come as 

 a huge impetus, other upgrade projects are on track too. 

 The barbecue area being renovated at the end of the lawn 

 is to be thrown open next week. The old health club space 

 has also been renovated to accommodate a new-age beauty 

 salon, which was inaugurated on Thursday.

 The first-floor lounge is being 

 refurbished and renamed. The Light Horse Bar and the club?s 

 reception area are being redone. Work on the other first-floor 

 bar and the heated swimming pool is also complete.

 A proposal to overhaul the club 

 property on Hungerford Street housing the staff quarters 

 is going to the general committee for approval. ?The plan 

 is to do a split car-parking plaza for about 25 cars and 

 reclaim two floors for club use, while one floor can be 

 reallocated for staff accommodation,? De declares.

 Melodies from Japan

 Until the 1990s, much of Japanese contemporary music was as an extension of Western classical music. Over the last 15 years, however, musicians have begun drawing on their favourite musical grammars like pop, rock, jazz and folk music to create compositions that transcend boundaries. The accomplishments of the new generation of Japanese musicians are no longer constrained by the exclusive institutions of traditional music. Remaining rooted to tradition, the music they create sings praises of modernity. Japanese Traditional Music Today brings together musicians from Japan who will play with local performers, upholding the belief that close, cross-border interactions will increase and develop the traditions of Japan and its host country. Featuring Ai Kajigano (koto), Hiromu Motonaga (shakuhachi), Naoyuki Manabe (sho), Mita Nag (sitar) and Biplab Bhattacharya (tabla). Presented by The Consulate-General of Japan, Calcutta and The Calcutta School of Music.

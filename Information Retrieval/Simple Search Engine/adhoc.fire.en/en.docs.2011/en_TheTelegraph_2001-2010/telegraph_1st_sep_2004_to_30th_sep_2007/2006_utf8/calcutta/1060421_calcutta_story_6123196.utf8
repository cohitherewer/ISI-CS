 Having pioneered organised retail in its contemporary format in Calcutta, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd is poised to bring in cutting-edge, international-standard mall management to town through a strategic alliance with one of Asias largest property groups, CapitaLand.

 Pantaloon Retail on Wednesday joined hands with CapitaLand Retail India Investments Pte Ltd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CapitaLand Limited, for a strategic joint venture at a signing ceremony in Singapore.

 The CapitaLand Group, headquartered in Singapore, has international operations in 17 countries, with a portfolio of over 45 malls in Singapore, China, Japan and Malaysia comprising approximately 20 million sq ft of net lettable area.

 We welcome this partnership with CapitaLand, which has a proven track record in retail management, property funds and the pioneering of retail property funds as an asset class for international investors. Together, we envisage managing within the next two to three years this portfolio of assets, across approximately 19 million sq ft of retail real estate pan-India, says Kishore Biyani, managing director, Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd.

 Biyani feels Calcutta, where Pantaloon has lined up a number of new retail malls to come up in the next 12 to 36 months, would be among the major beneficiaries of this strategic tie-up.

 CapitaLand has immense experience in managing retail space and its partners Wal-Mart in China. All our new properties in Calcutta will be enriched by that expertise, he tells GoodLife.

 CapitaLand Retail India will invest $75 million in Horizon Realty Fund, an international fund managed by Kshitij Investment Advisory Co. Ltd, the asset management arm of Pantaloon Retail.

 CapitaLand has also signed a pact with Pantaloon to form a 50-50 joint-venture retail management company and a 50-50 joint-venture fund management company.

 Its a lethal combination of Indias largest retailer and Asias biggest property group. Retailing is extremely organised and evolved in Singapore and CapitaLand has the domain knowledge to play at that level. Instead of reinventing the wheel, it makes sense for us to delve into that resource pool, which would include, besides money power and mall-management inputs, design and architecture. We are extremely excited, says Shishir Baijal, CEO, Kshitij Investment Advisory Co. Ltd.

 The new mall-management company will manage the portfolio of malls under the brand Kshitij Retail Destinations.

 CapitaLand and Pantaloon, through a 50-50 joint venture fund management company, intend to create a development fund to capture the tremendous growth in the Indian retail real estate market, subject to relevant laws and regulations. For such funds, CapitaLand will invest 20 to 40 per cent as a sponsor.

 Liew Mun Leong, president and CEO, CapitaLand Group, says: Our partnership with Pantaloon, the largest shopping mall owner/manager in India, is a key milestone for CapitaLand as we venture into India, the second most populous country with one of the fastest growing retail sectors in the world.

 The JV retail management company is expected to manage a portfolio of over 50 retail malls spread across 30 cities and 14 states pan-India with an estimated total project cost of $330 million.

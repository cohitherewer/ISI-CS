 Awareness through Mosquito Week

 Sandip Banerjee: Millions of rupees are wasted every year in spraying larvicide and conducting awareness campaigns among people on ways to check the breeding of mosquitoes. They have turned out to be futile exercises as the mosquito population is increasing steadily. Why don?t you observe a Mosquito Day like the World Health Day or a Mosquito Week like the Road Safety Week?

 Our main objective is to prevent the incidence of malaria and dengue in the city. Both are mosquito-borne diseases hence we carry out drives against the insect. The mosquitoes that spread malaria or dengue mostly thrive inside houses, apartments and offices. We have been trying to persuade the people to be more vigilant. 

 It is a good suggestion to observe a Mosquito Week every year. We will take up the matter with the civic health authorities.

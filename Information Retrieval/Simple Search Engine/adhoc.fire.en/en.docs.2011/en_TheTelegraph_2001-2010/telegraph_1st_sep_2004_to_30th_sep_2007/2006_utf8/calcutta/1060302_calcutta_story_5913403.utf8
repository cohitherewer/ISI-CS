The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sharp drop in mercury

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A change in the wind pattern and a low-pressure trough brought relief to Calcuttans from the warm spell of the past fortnight.

 The maximum temperature on Wednesday was 32.6 degrees Celsius, down from 38.4 degrees on Monday. A low-pressure trough had formed over Bihar and sub-Himalayan West Bengal on Tuesday. Within 24 hours, it moved eastward. 

 ?The trough and wind from the south-east are bringing in moisture from the Bay, lowering the maximum temperature,? said a Met official. The current spell is likely to continue for the next 48 hours.

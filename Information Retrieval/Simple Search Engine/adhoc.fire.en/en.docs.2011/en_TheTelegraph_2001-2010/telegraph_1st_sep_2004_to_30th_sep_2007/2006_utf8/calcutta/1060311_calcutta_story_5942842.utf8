 Different identities at different places in different roles and yet not a hair out of place. Thats how todays woman wants to be. GoodLife draws up a fact file for four picture-perfect faces of the woman on the move with the right spring-summer look, style and more. 

 Student style

 Youngsters like Konkona are perhaps the hippest trend-setters today. Cool cuts and hot hues invariably go to their head, sometimes even way before the flamboyant fashionista has heard about them. In such cases, Najeeb, technical director of Schwarzkopf Professional, prescribes the use of neutralising colour. Konkonas hair already had copperish streaks and so the neutralising colour in Medium Blonde Matte was the best choice. Not only does this minimise the effect of the previous hue, it also packs in a fresh colour beautifully, he explains.

 As far as the styling goes, Najeeb feels students ? often the symbol of fashionable trends ? should only stick to the most happening cuts and styles. The perm is making a huge comeback. For a student, I suggest a medium-length style that boasts lots of movement with slight waves.

 Hair and beauty expert Bridgette Jones is all for correct nourishment and care of a students tresses: These are the days of stressful examinations when eating right should take top priority. Eight glasses of water is an absolute must as is a protein-rich diet comprising fish, milk, cheese and various cereals.

 Students also need to comb out their hair properly with a wide-tooth comb, de-tangling their hair from the end, working right down to the roots.

 Basically, the younger lot should be aware about the right intake of food. And they must be in tune with hair basics rather than piling on styling products and fancy gadgets, adds Bridgette.

 DJ diktat

 The DJ ? always in the nightclub limelight and always the centre of every party persons attention ? needs to take extra care to groom her hair well.

 That is precisely why I gave DJ Carlotta lots of red in her hair. The shade is Schwarzkopfs Passion Red and most of the colour frames her face, explains Najeeb. Rather than colouring all her hair red, Najeeb has applied the colour in graduation, leaving about 80 per cent of it natural. The fringe looks cool. She also sports the combo look, with adequate movement at the back and a straighter look in front.

 For the DJ, Bridgette suggests a blow dried, well-groomed look. She must also use a heat protection spray to ward off all the environmental damage, she adds.

 DJs also need to wash their hair frequently, thanks to the super smoky, polluted nightclub, but must avoid using water that is too hot. This will strip the hairs natural moisture, warns Bridgette.

 Another must do for DJs: invest in quality brushes.

 Home hues

 Najeeb has chosen an Auburn Red for Renu, the pretty homemaker. Since she is a homemaker, I advise a toned-down shade of red from the Samba Brazil Collection.

 The red hue has then been used in dual shades, using the splitting end technique. 

 Instead of colouring her entire hair the same colour, I have chosen the lighter version for the lower ends. This will look gorgeous when the hair is tied high, showing off two beautiful colours at once, explains Najeeb.

 Styling for a homemaker should be kept fuss-free and as closes to the original texture as possible. 

 Since Renus hair turns out near the shoulders, I have kept the style pretty much the same, accentuating the original fall and texture, says Najeeb.

 For Bridgette, knowing how and when to take a break is of vital importance. She just has to take time out for herself instead of perpetually running around. She needs to eat the right things at the right time, and catch some exercise.

 l the healthy lifestyle changes are fine, but the busy homemaker must also take some time out for a regular head massage. 

 This will enhance the blood circulation and make hair healthy, adds Bridgette. 

 Career crop

 A career woman, says Najeeb, should always sport a no-nonsense hair do, all for that right image.

 For Mona, I have used Hot Chocolate, but just in graduation, he says. The choice of colour here is determined by the fact that the final look shouldnt come across as too loud. 

 You can still see a lot of her natural colour and the highlights are prominent only around the frame of her face, adds Najeeb.

 The styling, for a career woman, should also be sleek and business-like. 

 Try and keep close to the original texture here, too. Mona had straight hair, so we just decided to finish the look with a hair iron. The effect is sleek and simple, feels Najeeb.

 With an easy-to-maintain style and a hassle-free final look, the hair care for such women, says Bridgette, should be proper yet simple. They must use the correct shampoo and conditioner and to remove product build-up, they must apply an occasional detox shampoo at least once a month, she rounds off.

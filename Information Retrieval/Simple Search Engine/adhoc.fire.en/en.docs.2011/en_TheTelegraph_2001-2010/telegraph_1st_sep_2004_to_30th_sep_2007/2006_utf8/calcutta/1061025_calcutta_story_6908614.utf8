 Everyday objects become fantastic

 SOUMITRA DAS

 VARIOUS LAYERS OF 

 MEANING: Two of Ashok Bhowmiks works that had been 

 on display at a recent exhibition 

 Realism is Ashok Bhowmiks vehicle for entering the world beyond reality. 

 That this first-class first of the Government College of Art and Craft, Calcutta, is a skillful draughtsman is quite evident from his just-concluded exhibition at Galerie 88. 

 Bhowmik often gleans objects and figures, many seen in everyday life, and paints them in curious juxtapositions that create various layers of meaning that never existed before. Alice in Wonderland fashion, the most ordinary objects become fantastic, given the ability to look beyond the obvious.

 An anthropomorphic flying fish hovers over a bathtub like a blimp. A horned monster lowers it head as if to charge at a clock. The bust of a crowned young woman rises from the clock. The head of a man perhaps that of the sovereign is installed under a large throne that is richly engraved. A dragon-fly confronts a mummy-like head.

 In many of these paintings uniformly with a black backdrop Bhowmik succeeds in creating a haunting quality. He borrows images and symbols from Egyptian paintings of deities, such as the large eye on the saddle of a horse wearing a mask. The cadaver lying on the autopsy table with the grasshopper under it, apparently holding a piece of parchment, is another such painting focussed on death.

 Bhowmik uses a limited number of colours in his paintings. Besides the permanent black in the background, it is mostly white and ochre with occasional touches of brighter shades of red, as in his painting of a pistol that seems to have sprouted limbs.

 One of his paintings depicts a giant flower in bloom with a tiny fairy hovering over it, while a scuba diver (or is it the close-up of some insect?) scrutinises them. It may remind a viewer of the superb black-and-white photographs of Mapplethorpe. Of course, Bhowmiks images are nothing if they are high camp.

 Bhowmik is at his best when his canvases he has painted with acrylic are uncluttered. The jug next to the jagged chimney and the womans head emerging from a snails carapace floating over a dry branch are cases in point. So is the gourd attached to a vine. These are inscrutable images that are difficult to make sense of, like episodes we visualise in dreams, without any beginning or end.

 However, he is not always successful in putting together such haunting images in all his work. The large Queen on a playing card offers little beyond surface reality. 

 Ultimately, Bhowmiks paintings arise out of a contemplation of death and the mystery of life. We get glimpses of the magic as the veil lifts momentarily. Artists of Bengal have done this idea to death. Perhaps, by his next exhibition the artist will have developed new ways of looking at this, the ultimate question. Or else, he runs the risk of becoming cliched.

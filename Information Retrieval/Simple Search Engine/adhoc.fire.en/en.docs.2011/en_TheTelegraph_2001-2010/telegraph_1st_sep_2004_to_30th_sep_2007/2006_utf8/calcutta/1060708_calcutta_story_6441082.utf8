 Safe option to hysterectomy

 SUBHRO SAHA

 At a time when the generic tilt in modern medicine is towards minimally invasive procedures, city gynaecologists feel they have found an alternative to the knife in treating dysfunctional uterine bleeding, or ?menorrhagia? ? a condition at least one in five women of reproductive age suffers from.

 Clinically defined as heavy menstrual bleeding, menorrhagia is a major social and medical problem, and almost 60 per cent of women with the condition will have hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) within five years.

 A non-invasive, non-surgical, ?fit-and-forget? option now gaining currency among doctors in Calcutta could halve the need for this operation, it is felt. 

 The novel intrauterine system (IUS), ?Mirena?, once inserted into the uterus, releases a sustained amount of drug (levonorgestrel) every day for a period of five years.

 Menorrhagia, which can occur due to the imbalance between the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, can be severely debilitating, often leading to iron deficiency and as a result, anaemia.

 ?This IUS reduces the blood loss and the number of bleeding days, and, consequently, the haemoglobin level rises,? explains Bhaskar Pal, senior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, who feels the device could be an ?ideal substitute? to the trauma of hysterectomy.

 The routine treatment options for menorrhagia are oral medications (tablets), injectables, D amp;C (dilatation and curettage), endometrial ablation (removal of the uterine lining with the help of laser), or hysterectomy, where the patient loses her uterus.

 ?Mirena gives us a safe alternative, more so in special populations like cardiac, diabetic and obese patients, and the results till now have been most encouraging,? stresses Krishnendu Gupta, gynaecologic endoscopic surgeon.

 While the core target group remains menorrhagia patients, the device is also used on women suffering from endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus where there is overgrowth of cells within and outside, leading to further complications like heavy bleeding and tumours.

 Top city gynaecologists recently met and shared their experiences with the IUS. 

 ?Besides the risk factors and morbidity, hysterectomy is irreversible and the patient loses the uterus, often leading to massive personal trauma. Now, the knife can be spared on most of them,? observes Dibyendu Banerjee, consultant gynaecologist and laparoscopic surgeon.

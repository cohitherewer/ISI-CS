 It is well past 10 pm, but David Gere is still deep in post-rehearsal discussions with the Sapphire dance unit, at their rooftop rehearsal space in Salt Lake. Sure, he is Richard Gere?s younger brother, but ?that isn?t really important? in terms of the work, especially when working for AIDS awareness. 

 A distinguished dance and music critic working for a while with Los Angeles Times, David Gere is a senior faculty member of the University of California, Los Angeles and head of the Gere Foundation India Trust. His pet project, Make Art/Stop AIDS, launched two years back, is heading for a gala display in Los Angeles this December, which will see artistes from Los Angeles, Brazil, South Africa and India.

 It was this project that had him harrying across India, watching puppet teams in Madurai and street theatre groups in Mumbai and Chennai over the past 10 days, before checking on presentations by Sapphire and Nandita Palchaudhury?s teams of patuas and Chandernagore lighting artistes. 

 But why use art for AIDS awareness? ?Unlike pamphlets or telecast information, art alone can make you feel what needs to be felt. Artists are the master communicators, the audience is quite receptive with eyes and hearts open wide. And as sex is related to AIDS, one must reach at a deeper introspective level. Works like Positive Lives by Sapphire excites me, as they are open-ended and allow discussion. Even the street plays are capable of attracting casual passers-by to watch and join in the interactive session at the end of each show,? Gere explained.

 Inspiration for this project came from the American AIDS epidemic of 1985-94. ?That time, artistes responded with a lot of powerful works, for instance dancer Bill T Jones ? And now, I can see the same kind of response in pre-epidemic India. Therefore, I decided to support groups or individuals working on such artistic projects on AIDS.?

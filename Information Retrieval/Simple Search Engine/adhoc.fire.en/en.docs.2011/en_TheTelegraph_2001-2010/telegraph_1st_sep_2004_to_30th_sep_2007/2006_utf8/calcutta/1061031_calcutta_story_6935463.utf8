The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Friends turn foe at online forums

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Shamik (name changed) had signed up for an Orkut account to get back in touch with old friends and make some new ones. Only a couple of months later, he is at the police door, complaining about a friend on the social networking website who is harassing him online.

 More and more young people like Shamik are approaching the cops after being harassed by their friends on social networking websites. Three women and a man in their early 20s, all members of Orkut, last week lodged similar complaints at Bhabani Bhavan, the headquarters of the criminal investigation department (CID).

 A couple of months ago, the daughter of a south Calcutta police officer was forced to lodge a complaint with the detective department after she stumbled upon a profile in her name on Orkut containing several obscene photographs. Her cellphone number was also uploaded on the profile.

 After receiving the complaint, deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh contacted the administrators of Orkut and had the profile deleted.

 According to deputy inspector general (operations) of CID Rajiv Kumar, most of the complainants had fictitious profiles created in their names on social networking websites. The profiles contained personal details and obscene photographs, and as a resulted attracted lewd messages.

 The motive generally is to harass a target personally as well as professionally, explained Kumar. 

 He added: This is a menace that is spreading gradually. The problem needs to be addressed immediately. As the first step, I would suggest that the people being harassed online bring it to the notice of the administrators of the websites concerned. They should provide proof of their identity and report the fictitious entries as bogus.

 On receiving such complaints, police first help the victims get in touch with their friends and explain that a fictitious profile has been created in their names. This is done as the investigation generally takes time and the situation can get complicated in between, remarked Kumar.

 With the help of administrators of social networking websites, it is possible for the investigators to track down the person who created a fake profile. It is not a problem to zero in on the culprit. For Orkut, the process is easier since one can only sign up after being invited by an existing member, claimed Kumar.

 Often the people who create fake profiles are closely associated with the victims. Otherwise, it would not be possible for them to obtain personal information. Rivalry is the most common motive. It could either be professional jealously or the fallout of a love affair, said an officer of the cyber crime team.

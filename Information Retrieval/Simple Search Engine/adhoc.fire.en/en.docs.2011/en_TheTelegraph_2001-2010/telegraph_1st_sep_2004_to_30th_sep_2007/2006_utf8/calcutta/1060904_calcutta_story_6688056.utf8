The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant get through this week 

 without

 Shaping up for the festive 

 season

 The holiday hungama is 

 about to set in. And thats reason enough to get into 

 the exercise routine youve been putting off for far 

 too long (just look at yourself in the mirror!). Pilates, 

 salsa, yoga or some circuit training in the gym, its 

 time you get going and fast. Look at the grins beyond 

 the groans not only will you look good and feel great 

 flaunting your all-new Puja wardrobe, youll also be 

 able to indulge your sweet tooth. And guilt-free!

 Getting into Don mode 

 Swooning over SRK in his 

 newest avatar as he teases you through trailers that have 

 flooded the screens both silver and small the Don 

 drama is just about beginning to unfold. And if SRK behind 

 the smoke screen and Piggychops doing a Zeenie baby dont 

 get you, Bebo doing a Helen aunty surely will.

 Dancing with the stars 

 Tune into Sony come September 

 7 as Jhalak Dikhla Ja makes its debut. You really 

 dont want to miss stars like TV actresses Mona Jassi 

 Singh, Shweta Salve, cricketer Ajay Jadeja, chef Sanjeev 

 Kapoor, film-maker Mahesh Manjrekar make the right and 

 wrong moves.

 The judges on the panel 

 are equally exciting. Catch film-maker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, 

 choreographer-turned-director Farah Khan and actress Shilpa 

 Shetty take their places to crown or cut down to size the 

 stars on the dance floor.

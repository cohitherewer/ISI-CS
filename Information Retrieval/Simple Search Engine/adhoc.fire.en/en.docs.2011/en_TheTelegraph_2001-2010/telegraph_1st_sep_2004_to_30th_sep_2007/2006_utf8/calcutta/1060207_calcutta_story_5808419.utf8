 Blood separator at state hospitals

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Getting hold of blood components in an emergency will no longer be a challenge. 

 All state-run hospitals are set to acquire blood component separation units. The state government has already sought the necessary equipment from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO).

 According to the plan, the first blood component separation facility will be installed at Medical College and Hospital. SSKM and NRS hospitals will follow suit soon after.

 ?The units will be set up in phases. The facility will also be made available in district hospitals in the near future,? said D.K. Chakraborty, joint director (blood safety), West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society.

 The Central Blood Bank, in Maniktala, and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital now offer blood components.

 At Medical College, the facility is nearly ready. While NACO is providing a number of instruments, the others will be purchased by the state government. The total project will cost Rs 50 lakh, said Indrajit Ray, principal, Medical College and Hospital.

 Lack of blood component separation facilities have put pressure on the Central Blood Bank, where there is a daily average demand of 450 units of various blood components.

 ?The crisis is most acute from mid-May to end of July, when very few blood donation camps are held. During the Pujas, too, the number of blood donation camps go down,? said an official of the blood bank.

 The authorities fear the crisis will intensify this year due to the Assembly elections. A meeting between the blood bank authorities and voluntary organisations has been called on February 8 to discuss the situation. 

 The state government has also started a training programme for doctors of private and state-run hospitals on rational use of blood. ?In several cases, doctors prescribe blood transfusion even if it is not necessary,? revealed D.K. Chakraborty. 

 Doctors of Calcutta Medical Research Institute were provided the training recently and similar programmes are being taken up at other hospitals, too, he added.

 Prasun Bhattacharya, a transfusion medicine consultant and member of the training team, stressed the importance of proper utilisation of blood.

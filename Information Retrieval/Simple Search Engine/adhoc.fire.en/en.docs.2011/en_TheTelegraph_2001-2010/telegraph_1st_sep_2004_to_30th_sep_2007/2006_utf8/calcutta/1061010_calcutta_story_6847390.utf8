 The triptych depicting the Calvary by Suhas Roy

 Suhas Roy will be remembered as the artist who replicated the ethereal face of Radha to such an extent that it has become as familiar with collectors and art-watchers, at least in India, as Warhols soup cans and Marilyn Monroe heads are in the rest of the world.

 Suhas Roys current crop of paintings, which was recently displayed at ITC Sonar Bangla amp; Sheraton Towers, before being flown out for an exhibition to a gallery in central London, was clearly influenced by the works of Renaissance artists, paintings that he was overwhelmed by during his earlier trips to Europe. This is not the first time that the artist has painted the scarred and gory head of Jesus, sometimes wearing a crown of thorns. Several of these portraits were on exhibition.

 This time, he has painted scenes from the Passion of Christ in a triptych the Calvary and Christs descent from the cross, when he was surrounded by his earthly mother and the other women who venerated him. 

 On the face of it, the painting is very similar to Medieval and Renaissance depictions of these episodes from The Bible but it has neither the transcendence of the former nor the down-to-earthedness of the latter.

 Christ is a bloodless being with a tapering body that stretches diagonally across two canvases. A cherub and a dove hover over him. Of course, Suhas Roy is a skilled draughtsman but only in a limited sense. So, it ends up looking like a wishy-washy version of those great masterpieces that are landmarks of art down the ages.

 As a matter of fact, the veteran artist has liberally mixed turpentine with pigment to produce the wash effect with oil colours and then used a charcoal stick that is like a paste for his drawings. 

 The fleshy nudes sprawled across the other canvases or in a sardine-like tangle look similarly insipid. They were apparently inspired by the frescoes of Ajanta but lack the physicality of those full-breasted women who are paradigms of Indian beauty. One of them comes close to Cranach without the pertness of his girls in nothing but headgear.

 It is strange that Suhas Roy should choose to hang the Golgotha canvas next to those of the nudes in almost sacrilegious juxtaposition. Is this artistic licence, or was it meant to juxtapose the sacred and the profane?

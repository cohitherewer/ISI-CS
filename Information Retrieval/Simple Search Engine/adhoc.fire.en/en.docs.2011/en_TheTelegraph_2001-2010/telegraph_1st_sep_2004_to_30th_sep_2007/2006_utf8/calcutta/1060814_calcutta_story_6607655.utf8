 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters, on SN Banerjee Road, is getting a facelift at a cost of Rs 15 lakh to mark Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees first visit as chief minister on August 23.

 The chief minister will visit the CMC headquarters to inaugurate a video conferencing network with civic offices, including pumping stations, across the city. The network has been set up as part of the Rs 100-cr e-governance project, being undertaken by the CMC with a grant from the UKs Department for International Development.

 Eager to accord a special welcome to the chief minister, the civic authorities have sanctioned a record amount of Rs 15 lakh to refurbish the century-old building. The chief minister is visiting the CMC for the first time and we would like to welcome him in a befitting manner, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 The authorities, however, are taking care to avoid too much of extravagance. We know the chief minister does not like unnecessary expenditure. So, we have decided to exercise restraint, he added.

 Civic engineers of borough VI said the CMC building is being given, for the first time, a coat of synthetic and plastic paint. We are spending Rs 10 lakh on painting the outside of the building. Inside, the VIP block is being painted at a cost of Rs 2 lakh, said an engineer.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay described the facelift as modest. The weather-coat on the exterior was badly required. After all, its a heritage building and has withstood wear and tear for over 100 years.

 The authorities have hired a red carpet for the occasion, as the one in possession of the civic body was purchased more than three decades ago and has worn out. 

 We are also decorating the staircase and the corridors with flower pots. The pots will be brought from our nursery in Tallah. The parks and gardens wing is holding meetings to decide on the kind of flowers to be displayed, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, mayoral council member, parks and garden.

 The authorities are also polishing eight oil paintings from the British period and two paintings of Subhas Chandra Bose and BR Ambedkar.

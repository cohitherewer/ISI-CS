 Shes Bose, Shonali Bose

 Mouthing her first Bengali words on screen, BIPASHA BASU tells Pratim D. Gupta why she said no to Dhoom but yes to Dhoom 2 and why Ash is looking hot

 Bipasha Basu with Abhishek Bachchan in Dhoom 2

 You were first offered Rimii Sens role in Dhoom

 Yes, I was offered Dhoom but it really had no role for the ladies. This time Adi (Aditya Chopra) has written a great character for me and I couldnt say no. I guess the timing was fantastic for me because I was getting fit. So Adi must have chosen me because of the physicality of the character. Working with Yash Raj Films is always a pleasant experience. I know that from the days of Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai. That was also with the Dhoom 2 director Sanjay Gadhvi.

 Did you watch Dhoom later on?

 Of course. I generally do not like to watch a film more than once, but I saw Dhoom four times in a span of 15 days. That says a lot about the film. I thought its like the Fast and the Furious style, stunts good looking people, good songs 

 And how has Dhoom 2 turned out?

 Its turned out to be a visual delight and all of us are looking as good as we can look. Like Dhoom, Dhoom 2 is like the films we like to see as the audience youthful and colourful. It has great stunts, great looking people, good styling, great bodies, good music, beautiful locations, first-time locations like Rio and South Africa... Its an action comedy and I think people worldwide like action comedies. But I dont like to ever judge a film before its release. D2 is going to be a lot of fun to watch. I just hope people like it. You cant outdo your own branding.

 From a Ford supermodel to one of Bollywoods top heroines, has it been a tough ride considering you never wanted to get into all the naach-gaana?

 I earlier couldnt identify myself with the Bollywood naach-gaana but then I forced myself to get comfortable with it. The essence of Bollywood is that naach-gaana and yet, with time, we are trying to do different kinds of things.

 By different you mean films like Dhoom 2?

 Yes. Its not like a job, while the Bollywood naach-gaana for me is a job. For something like Dhoom, I am in sync because the kind of clothes I wear in the film are very much me. Since I have been a model I can adapt to any kind of styling.

 After Nishigandha Dasgupta in Corporate, youre Shonali Bose in D2

 But in Corporate I didnt speak any Bengali! Dhoom 2 gives me a chance to speak in my mother tongue for the first time. My Bengali projects are yet to happen. So this is the first time that I will be speaking Bengali on camera. 

 During shooting Sanjay would tell me something in English or Hindi and ask me to say it in Bengali the way I liked. It was really funny to dub those Bengali lines. Also, the surname is Bose and my grandfather used to call himself KN Bose, but my father and uncle took Basu as a surname. So, its closer home I guess.

 Most of the promotion space has gone to Ash in the movie. Do you feel ignored?

 No, I think the attention is very adequate and right, because Ash has never experimented with her looks in this drastic a manner. She is always seen as this Indian girl wearing Indian clothes. For the first time you see her in short skirts and bikini tops and a tanned look. I would say wow! Its a required change and its a very positive thing; she is really looking hot.

 I have worn western clothes and I am the western girl always. The look is different for me, but not so visually different. I have not been wearing saris in all my films.

 But we all are missing John already... 

 John justified what he did in Dhoom. What Dhoom did for him, John did equally good things for Dhoom. But Dhoom 2 is a different film altogether. I am sure people will watch it as a new film.

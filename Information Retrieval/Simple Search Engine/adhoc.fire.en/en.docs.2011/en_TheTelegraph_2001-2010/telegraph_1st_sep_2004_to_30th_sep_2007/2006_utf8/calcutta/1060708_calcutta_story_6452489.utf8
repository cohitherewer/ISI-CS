Excess matter

Stage On amp; Off

 A scene from Vishalyakarani

 Economy in expression is a virtue dearly desired, and one that the Odeon Festival sorely lacked, whether in the non-Calcutta segment at Birla Sabhagar or the folkloric Bengali plays at Rabindra Sadan. Blank Verse?s Furrut and Asansol Balaka?s Maruyatra carried on from where C for Clown and Ek Kadam Aage left off, leaving our fingers itching for scissors to shear their rambling scripts into perfect dimensions.

 How can one go wrong with Upendra Kishor Raychaudhuri?s classic Tuntunir Boi? Writer-director Raja Bhattacharya shows one way, by padding Furrut with so much superfluous clowning, singing and dancing that the bloated result overkills adult and child alike. If at all he wishes to appeal to children he should chop not just the nose off the Raja, but also an hour off his dramatisation. That would make Furrut worthy of Upendra Kishor?s folk satire. It can become a big hit if Bhattacharya harnesses it tightly like he would have in his previous street-theatre experiences.

 But the performances of the adversaries redeemed the musical. I could not even recognise Debshankar Halder as the Raja, possibly his first major farcical role. His clueless open-mouthed expressions, silences as he tries to digest what just happened, comic sense and habit of forgetting lines make his characterisation memorable. Anandee Basu gives Tuntuni an acrobatic agility and penetratingly high voice like a tailorbird?s, though she has a rich lower range as well, impressively demonstrated by her delivery of ?My Heart Goes On? in ersatz Russian.

 We welcome Asansol Balaka?s debut on the Calcutta mainstage after three decades of existence. It displays remarkable maturity and poise in Maruyatra. The play, by group member Arindam Sen Gupta, also reveals originality of thought, depicting how successive generations of mankind (metaphorically placed at a crossroads) break out to choose a path and seek truth on their own.

 This truism can grow dreadfully monotonous if protracted on stage; Sen Gupta tests our patience with unnecessary subplots in the middle that had me on the point of dozing off. If director Swapan Biswas excises these portions, the sparse philosophy would strike home much more powerfully. 

 He himself acts with great composure the disciple who rejects his guru to face the harsh realities of life, and receives solid support from everyone, especially Bijoy Bhattacharjee as his aphorising mentor.

 Representing open-air puppetry, Bangaputul charmed spectators with Vishalyakarani. Subha Joardar uses traditional rod puppets (danger putul) in this environment-conscious script on the ill effects of industrial effluents and deforestation. A village girl (who looks curiously like Elvis Presley) falls sick from pollution, and the Kabiraj asks for leaves of the vishalyakarani, which has vanished from the vicinity. A pair of birds, Shuk-Sari, helps out by leading the humans to the only such tree.

 All very good by way of imaginative myth and ecological awareness, but not by science. Any quest for vishalyakarani is doomed to fail because it is a miraculous mythical herb, its name erroneously applied to many medicinal plants. And the Shuk-Sari are created as a parrot couple when, strictly, they are parrot and myna respectively. Plays encouraging a scientific mentality must themselves rely on scientific fact.

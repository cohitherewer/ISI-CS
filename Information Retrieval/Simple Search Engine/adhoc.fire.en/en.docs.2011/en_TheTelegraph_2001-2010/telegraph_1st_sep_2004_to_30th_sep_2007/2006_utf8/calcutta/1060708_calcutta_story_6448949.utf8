 Civic body eyes e-banking route

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) plans to introduce e-banking for collection of property tax, licence renewal fees and other charges, following reports of forgery in the Gariahat treasury office, bounced cheques and detection of fake currency notes.

 If the plan works out, the service will be inaugurated before Puja 2006. And once operational, it will spare house-owners or traders the hassle of standing in a queue for hours at designated civic counters.

 ?State Bank of India (SBI) has evinced interest in the proposal and talks are on to finalise the agreement,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. ?If everything goes well, our e-banking scheme will be introduced just before the Puja.?

 According to the municipal commissioner, the service will enable Calcuttans to make payments against receipt of demand notices issued by the CMC without coming to the treasury counters.

 The demand notices are issued for collection of property tax, licence renewal fees, water supply charges, drainage and sewerage charges, visual tax for billboards and building sanction fees.

 There are 16 civic treasury counters and each demand notice issued by the CMC is assigned to a particular counter. The payment against the notice has to be made at that particular counter only.

 Hence, people now have no option but to trudge to the specific counter and stand in a queue for hours to make the payment. Officer-goers are often forced to take leave of absence on the payment day.

 The situation is worse for traders. Against the 12 lakh-odd licensed traders in the city, there are only five counters where trade licence renewal fees can be deposited.

 The SBI is expected to play the role of a nodal bank in the proposed scheme for revenue collection, said chief of the finance and accounts department Debotosh Dasgupta.

 According to Dasgupta, once the tie-up is complete, several branches of SBI and a number of other banks will be linked with the civic body through a wide-area networking (WAN) system.

 The CMC is planning a link with around 100 branches of the SBI and other banks through WAN. 

 Whenever a payment is made in any of the branches, it will be immediately transferred online to the CMC account.

 Calcutta University on Monday announced a series of changes in the rules for admission to first-year BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses from the current 2006-07 academic session.

 For one, every student must clear a minimum of five compulsory subjects at the Plus-II level to be eligible for admission.

 At any Calcutta University affiliate, the rulebook says that candidates must pass in five subjects, including two languages and three electives.

 Delhi?s Central Board of Secondary Education, that conducts the CBSE Class XII exams, holds that a student can pass only four subjects, and clear the fifth subject the following year.

 Till last year, Calcutta University colleges would allow CBSE students to take provisional admission and clear the fifth subject after a year.

 ?This system has been abolished. Now, every student must clear five subjects in order to seek admission to the BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses,? said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).

 The other change, this time involving 

 ISC of Delhi?s Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, 

 deems that students who cleared business mathematics at 

 the Plus-II level will be allowed to study economics honours 

 with pure mathematics as an elective subject. Previously, 

 such students could not take pure math as an elective.

 From this academic year, students will also be required to study two honours papers in the first year itself.

 To safeguard against a dip in quality, the university also urged its affiliates not to admit a single student beyond their existing capacities.

 ?The colleges are expected to face a major rush this time because nearly 24,450 more students have cleared the HS exam. But we will not allow a college to increase a single seat without our permission,? said Das, adding that a circular to this effect would soon reach all principals.

 The colleges have also been asked to provide for longer waiting lists this time.

 According to Das, since the results of the state joint entrance examinations (JEE) have not been declared, many high-performing students who have appeared for JEE are expected to take admission in colleges and then opt out if they qualify in the competitive exam. ?The colleges must ensure that these seats do not remain vacant after that,? he stressed.

 The last date for admissions has been fixed for July 31, while the last date for changing subject combinations is August 31.

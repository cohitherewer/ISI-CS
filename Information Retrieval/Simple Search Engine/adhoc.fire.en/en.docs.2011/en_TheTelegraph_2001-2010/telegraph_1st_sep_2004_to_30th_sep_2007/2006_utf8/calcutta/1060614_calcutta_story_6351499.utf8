He wielded the camera in The World Is Not Enough. He was the director of photography of the second units of Captain Corelli?s Mandolin and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. He operated the camera for Troy and Alexander. He even worked on the images of The Da Vinci Code.

 And now, Peter Field will shoot Vipul Shah?s Namaste London.

 But why go shopping abroad for a lensman? The maker of Aankhen and Waqt has his reasons: ?I am making a romantic film and there are 50 good romantic films made from Mumbai every year. So to make my film stand out stylistically, I am hiring Peter. I needed someone of that class to handle the images of my new film and I am sure he will be able to take the product to a different level.?

 And how did Vipul manage to sign someone like Peter for Namaste London, starring Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Upen Patel and Rishi Kapoor? ?We got hold of his bio-data from the Talent Search Pool and then got in touch with him expressing our wish to sign him for the film,? reveals Vipul. ?He asked for the script and after going through it, agreed to work with us.?

 Vipul agrees that Indian cinematographers these days are top grade. ?They are on a par with the best of international cameramen. But all cinematographers in India capture London in the same way. Peter being from London will frame a different London for my film. Then he will come to Punjab to shoot the remaining film. And that will have a different look from a foreigner?s point of view.?

 So will the images be as dark and haunting as most of Peter?s work has been in the past? ?No, not really; Captain Corelli?s Mandolin was a love story and shot very brightly,? Vipul argues. ?We want to give a very vibrant look to Namaste London. It should be glamorous, yet very real. Some of our films are brilliantly shot but they go over the top and look very unreal. So we want to balance glamour and realism, which is the mainstay in Hollywood.?

 Peter?s expertise, of course, is not coming cheap. ?Oh, he?s taken my house,? laughs Vipul, who is also producing Namaste London. ?See, these technicians work in a different financial environment. So it does get difficult when they work for an Indian production. But this is my first out-and-out romance and the film really demands an international set-up. So apart from my editor, the entire crew including the sound guy are British.?

 The budget of Namaste London has been pegged at Rs 30 crore. Surely, Vipul could have signed on a Shah Rukh or an Aamir with that kind of money? ?I don?t feel Akshay Kumar is any less than any actor on the Indian screen today,? Vipul retorts. 

 ?You look at the opening and response that Phir Hera Pheri has got across the country. It?s just that he (Akshay) has never been given that pedestal by the media and is still labelled as the khiladi Kumar. But we have done two great films together and I hope we are able to achieve that level of success again.?

 Shooting for Namaste London starts in July and should finish by the end of the year.

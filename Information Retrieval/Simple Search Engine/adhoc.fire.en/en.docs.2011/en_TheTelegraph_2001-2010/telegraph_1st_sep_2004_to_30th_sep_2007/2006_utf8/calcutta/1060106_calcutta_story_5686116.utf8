 Grace on skates

 The members of Zenith Roller Skating Academy put up a wonderful show at the inaugural ceremony of the platinum jubilee celebrations at Tirthapati Institution, choreographed by Madhuchhanda Mukherjee. Some of the items based on classical dance forms were truly enthralling. Dressed in dazzling costumes and using Tricolours as props, the dancers performed to the track of Ma Tujhe Salaam, to the thunderous applause of the audience.

 Akanksha Gupta, Mayuri Garikipati and Ritwika Chaudhuri stood out for their skillful performances. Eight-year-old Rupkatha Ganguly (picture below by Sanat Kumar Sinha) also deserves special mention for her fusion dance item blending artistic skating and Odissi.

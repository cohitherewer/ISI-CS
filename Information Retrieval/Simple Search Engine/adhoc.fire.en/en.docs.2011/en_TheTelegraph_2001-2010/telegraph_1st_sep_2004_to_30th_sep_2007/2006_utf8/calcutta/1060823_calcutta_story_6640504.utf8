Ban beams for sound sleep 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Q: We live in a flat that has two bedrooms, quite small in size. Due to space crunch, the beds in both the rooms have been placed between tall wardrobes, which are connected to each other from the top. This way I get extra storage above the bed as well. But somehow none of us sleeps peacefully at night. We wake up with a heavy head in the morning. I wonder if the storage overhead is causing the problem.

THE SOLUTION: 

Any kind of heavy pressure over the head in the form of beams is bad for health. 

Your storage space works exactly like a beam that is carrying extra weight of 

the objects placed inside. The best solution would be to do away with the storage. 

Even if you decide to sleep with your head on the 

other side, the problem does not get totally solved because your feet will then 

remain under pressure.

Metal mayhem

 Q: I am studying in an engineering institute and my date of birth is June 20, 1987. I will be entering my second year starting this July. I will be taking the CAT in 2008 and hopefully start earning from July 2009. Please advise me on my favourable colours and success in the above-mentioned categories. Also let me know about my future and a favourable career.

THE SOLUTION: Your 

pillars of destiny indicate that you are a weak metal person and need nourishment 

from the earth element. Fortunately, your journey through life is very comfortable 

and you have a brilliant career ahead as you are blessed with earth and metal 

elements for the next 40 years. 

 Maximise your good luck by supporting yourself with earth and metal elements and their associated colours. 

Engineering would be the best career option for you. 

Three elements of fire reveal that you should enjoy a high status in life and 

earn lots of name, fame and recognition in your chosen profession.

Career call 

 Q: I was born on 10.06.79 at 10.25 am. Please let me know my lucky number, colours, directions and animal sign. What kind of a career is best suited for me? My room is in the north-west of the house, but I study facing the east in a different room. The bedroom is painted in light pink and I sleep with my head towards the west. What changes should I make to excel in my career and get a good job? How is my time now according to my pillars of destiny?

THE SOLUTION: Your 

date of birth when converted into five elements reveals that you are a strong 

earth person born in midsummer. This season provides you with lots of support 

in life. 

 Presently you are under the influence of metal and water, which signifies that you will generate money with your intelligence elements. Your intelligence is connected with metal, which means you should be in a profession that is connected with computers. 

 Your lucky number is 3 and the directions connected with it are east, north, south-east and south. Your animal sign is Ram and your lucky colours are white, blue and black. 

 You should try to sleep with your head towards the east and keep studying facing this direction. 

Try to introduce shades of blue to your bedroom in 

the form of accessories like cushions, rugs, linen and bedspread.

Weight Woe

According to Feng Shui, any heavy pressure over the 

head of the bed in the form of a beam or storage space can affect your sleep and 

hence is bad for health. The solution is to do away with such constructions.

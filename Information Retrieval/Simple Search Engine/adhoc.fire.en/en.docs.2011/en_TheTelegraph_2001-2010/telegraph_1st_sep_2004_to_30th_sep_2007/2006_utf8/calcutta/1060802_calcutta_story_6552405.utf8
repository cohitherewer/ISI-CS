 B-school boost for minnows

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is drawing up plans to roll out dedicated programmes for the burgeoning small and medium enterprises (SME) sector in Bengal. 

 The Delhi-based B-school, ranked among the top few in the country, will formally inaugurate its city facility on August 10. 

 We have a full-fledged centre for SME studies and activities. Given the importance of SMEs in Bengal, we want to focus on this sector, besides conducting our regular business management programmes, said Kris Rangarajan, head, Centre for SME Studies, IIFT. 

 To begin with, the B-school will offer certificate programmes in food processing, considered a sunrise sector in the state. 

 In later stages, IIFT will introduce more modules aimed at the SME segment. 

 From information technology to manufacturing, IIFT has plans to cover the entire gamut with its offerings. 

 There are over eight lakh SMEs in the state and the units have a significant contribution to the states economy. 

 The future for this segment is even brighter. With the opening of Nathu-la, the SMEs in Bengal can tap markets beyond boundaries and we want to facilitate the process, promised Rangarajan.

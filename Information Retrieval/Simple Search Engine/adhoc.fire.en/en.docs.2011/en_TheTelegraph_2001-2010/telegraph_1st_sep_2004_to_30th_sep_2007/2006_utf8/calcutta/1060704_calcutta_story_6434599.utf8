The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Metro Movie 

 Meter 

 The world?s greatest 

 saviour returns in his blue tights from his home planet Krypton. 

 This time Superman (Brandon Routh) has to stop nemesis Lex 

 Luthor (Kevin Spacey) from destroying mainland America and 

 setting up his own continent. He also has to contend with 

 an upset Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), now settled with another 

 man and a ?fragile? son.

 Usual Suspects director Bryan Singer brings a fresh 

 flavour to the pages of DC Comics. Together with long-time 

 musical collaborator Jon Ottman, he creates 150 minutes 

 of spellbinding audio-visual extravaganza.

 Brandon Routh gives a new face to the character 

 synonymous with Christopher Reeve. Routh is loveable as 

 the clumsy Clarke Kent while his broad shoulders do justice 

 to the red cape.

 Kate Bosworth is simply adorable as Lois Lane. She 

 lights up every frame she is in and refuses to be overshadowed 

 by the caped crusader.

 Kevin Spacey goes one up on Gene Hackman making 

 Luthor his very own. Using his physicality to the fullest, 

 the Oscar winner gets the best lines and delivers them in 

 a way only he can. A real knockout.

 The never-ending aircraft crisis scene building up to the 

 entry of Superman and the slowburn ending after the climactic 

 blitzkrieg.

 Last word: The best Superman 

 film till date; opens up wonderful possibilities of many 

 more to come.

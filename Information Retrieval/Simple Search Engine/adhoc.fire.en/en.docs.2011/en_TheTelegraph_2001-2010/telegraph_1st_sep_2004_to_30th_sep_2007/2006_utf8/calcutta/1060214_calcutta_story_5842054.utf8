The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 7 mishaps in 3 months

 Basanti Road, connecting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pet project Bantala leather complex with the city, has seen at least seven major mishaps in the past three months, residents say. 

 The worst two occurred on Saturday and Sunday, resulting in the death of eight people. In 2003, a bus accident on the road had claimed 42 lives.

 The reasons behind the accidents are not hard to find . The entire stretch, with canals on either side, has no lights. After dusk, only headlights illuminate the carriageway.

 There aren?t any traffic signs or speed bumps to warn drivers of impending sharp turns on the road, on which stand a high school and an engineering college.

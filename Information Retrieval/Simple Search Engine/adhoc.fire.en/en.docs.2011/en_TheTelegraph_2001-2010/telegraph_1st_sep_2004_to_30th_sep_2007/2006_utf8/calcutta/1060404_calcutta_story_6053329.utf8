 Damages for mobile phone user

 SANJAY MANDAL

 A city consumer court has slapped a fine on a mobile service provider accused of over-billing. The amount may be Rs 1,000, but the symbolism is not lost on any mobile user grappling with bewildering bills and confusing clauses.

 The three-member bench of the Calcutta District Forum Unit-I has asked Hutchison Telecom East Ltd to pay a compensation of Rs 1,000 to consumer Anjan Kumar Dutta.

 Dutta had received a bill for Rs 764 for the period March 4 to April 3, 2003. Going through the itemised record in the bill, he found that Rs 1.75 had been charged for the calls the duration of which was shown as ?0 call?. His written complaint to Hutch yielded no response, prompting him to move court.

 When contacted, Hutchison Telecom East Ltd chief executive officer S. Rao said: ?There must have been a system error. The customer must have called, but the calls were not registered. We have no intention of cheating our customers and any error is unintentional? And (as for the Forum?s verdict) we will abide by our lawyers? advice.?

 Dutta?s complaint was no exception. In the past six months, 27 cases against mobile service providers have been filed in three consumer courts ? Calcutta District Forum Unit I and II, and the South 24-Parganas District Consumer Forum. 

 ?The cases are mostly against erroneous billing, disconnection of service without any explanation and non-availability of long-distance call facilities,? said Prabir Basu, member, State Consumer Protection Council.

 Most service providers in the city stand accused of alleged irregularities on various counts, he added.

 The service providers, however, blame the rise in the complaint count to a ?communication gap? with customers. ?Calling the helpline is often not enough,? said an official of a cell service provider. ?An interaction with a customer-care executive at one of our outlets can clear the confusion.?

 A spokesperson for another operator stressed the need to ?spread awareness? among customers on how to use the system properly.

 Trader held for forgery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The proprietor of a travel agency was arrested on Friday for duping a car-owner by showing him a forged slip, purportedly issued by the Election Commission, booking his car for poll duty. 

 The accused, identified as Kaushik Sarkar, was picked up from his Shibpur residence and remanded in police custody till April 28 by the Alipore court.

 According to police, Abdul Hannan, a resident of Lenin Sarani, had made a deal with Sarkar allowing him use of a Tata Sumo against rent. Sarkar agreed to pay Hannan Rs 450 per day.

 ?For the first few months, Sarkar made regular payments. But he had not made any payments in the past couple of months. This had made Hannan suspicious,? observed deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma.

 Hannan went to the office of the travel agency run by Sarkar and demanded to see his vehicle. 

 ?He was told that the police had booked the Sumo for election duty. Sarkar even showed Hannan a forged requisition slip,? added Sharma.

 The car-owner wasn?t convinced. ?He took the slip and went to the office of the additional district magistrate (land and land acquisition), who confirmed that the registration number of the car was not in the database. After checking the serial number of the slip, it was found that the document was issued against a Scorpio,? the deputy commissioner continued. 

 Investigation revealed that the Scorpio booked by the Election Commission belonged to Sarkar. ?He made a photocopy of the requisition slip and doctored it by putting the registration number of the Sumo on it. Sarkar then made another photocopy of the forged slip and produced it before Hannan,? stated an officer of Alipore police station.

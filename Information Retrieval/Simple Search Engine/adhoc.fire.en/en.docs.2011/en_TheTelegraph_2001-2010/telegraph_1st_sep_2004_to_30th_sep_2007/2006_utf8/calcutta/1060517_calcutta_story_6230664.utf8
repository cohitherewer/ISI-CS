 Housing estates hauled up

 - 59 mega project plans pushed through minus green body nod

 JAYANTA BASU

 The state pollution control board (PCB) has recently hauled up 59 big housing estates ? mostly within the city ? that have got their plans sanctioned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation without obtaining the mandatory environment clearance.

 Of these, 53 have been found to have obtained the clearance later or have applied for it. The six that neither have the approval nor applied for it have been asked to stop construction immediately, said PCB?s senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee.

 If the developers ignore the order, the board will consider measures like imposition of pollution cost or snapping of electricity lines.

 The projects that have applied for the green sanction have been asked to carry on construction only after receiving the approval papers.

 ?Clearance from the PCB is a must for all these 59 projects as their built-up space, according to information provided by the civic body, is at least 60,000 sq ft each. Some of the projects are so big that they require approval from the central board,? said Mukherjee.

 ?We will deal with the violators stringently,? asserted Sudip Banerjee, chairman of the state green watchdog.

 In December 2003, the board had written to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), asking it not to sanction any plan of built-up space of 60,000 sq ft or more without the PCB?s nod. 

 However, several developers got their plans sanctioned by the civic body without the approval.

 Sources said the present civic board has stopped the practice. ?Now, we are not passing any plan that does not have the PCB?s clearance,? confirmed Gorachand Mondal, CMC?s chief engineer (building).

 The estates that require central clearance ? around one-third of those summoned ? now have to follow an elaborate procedure. 

 ?Most of the estates summoned by the board have either received the green nod or have applied for it,? said Pradip Chopra of Credai. 

 He complained of a delay in getting clearance from the central board. ?The state PCB takes a long time to send the applications to Delhi, and the delay is only matched by the central authorities in granting approval.? 

 According to board sources, some of these 59 projects are coming up in upmarket areas like Alipore and Ashutosh Mukherjee Road.

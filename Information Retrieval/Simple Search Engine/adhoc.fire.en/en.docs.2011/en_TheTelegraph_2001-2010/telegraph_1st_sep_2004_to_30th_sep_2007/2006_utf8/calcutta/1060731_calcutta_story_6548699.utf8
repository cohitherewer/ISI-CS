The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Landfill cry confirmed

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The South City project ?has encroached? on part of Bikramgarh Jheel, the committee set up by the chief secretary has found. Its report corroborates the findings of the P.N. Roy committee, constituted by the state pollution control board to inquire into environmental violations by the realty project. 

 ?On inspection, it is evident that the South City project has encroached on a part of the said Bikramgarh Jheel at present with the construction of a basement,? says the recently-submitted report of the chief secretary?s committee. It does not elaborate on the extent of the encroachment.

 The panel was formed in May with representatives of the environment department, fisheries department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to find out if the waterbody had been filled up. 

 ?We are not yet aware of the chief secretary?s committee report, but we have not encroached on Bikramgarh Jheel in any manner,? D.J. Chakrabarty, manager (corporate amp; PR) of South City, told Metro on Sunday.

 South City had earlier claimed in a letter to the pollution control board (a copy of which was forwarded to Metro): ?If at all there is encroachment on Bikramgarh Jheel and/or dumping of waste, the CMC is squarely liable for the same and not South City.?

 The chief secretary?s committee has recommended the creation of a 1.41-acre waterbody by South City as ?compensation? for the encroachment on Bikramgarh Jheel. The pollution control board had made a similar recommendation.

 Additional solicitor-general R. Mohon had, however, opined that the pollution control board ?does not have any power to allow filling up of the waterbody and give direction to create another waterbody?. 

 The report also calls for upkeep of ?the remaining portion of the property of South City within the Bikramgarh Jheel?. The project authorities will have ?to contribute a sufficient amount to the CMC for upkeep of the said wetland?.

 Blood group and cancer

 - O most susceptible, AB least, to malignancy, says research

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Research by a Barasat-based institute, which has won a pat from President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has nailed blood group O as most susceptible, and AB as least, to malignant cell disorders resulting in cancer.

 Cancer Research and Welfare Centre, on the northern fringes of the city, has been involved in research for over two years on the correlation between malignant disorder of body cells and blood groups.

 Phase I of the project is over and the findings yet to be subjected to peer review have been published in the institutes house journal.

 The President had visited the centre in 2004, soon after the research started, and encouraged the scientists to complete the study at the earliest.

 We have completed just the first phase of our research and come across some interesting facts about the prevalence of cancer. The President has been informed about the development and he has asked us to continue the research for some more specific details, said R. Roy, institute secretary.

 According to the preliminary study, completed about two months ago, persons with blood group AB are least, and those with blood group O most, prone to malignancy.

 The focus of the study is on ABO malignant blood disorder. Analysing around 2,000 samples, we have got some statistics about these disorders which we think will be helpful to diagnose those that cause various types of cancer, said a doctor of the institute.

 Another objective of the study is to caution individuals in the high-risk groups, so they take precautions early. The findings will help at least a few concerned persons to keep a tab on their health and any anomaly noticed can be diagnosed and treated early, he added.

 According to the research, persons with blood group B have 54 per cent chance of contracting stomach cancer, while females with blood group A carry 56 per cent risk of developing ovarian cancer.

 The chances of blood cancer among individuals with blood group O is 75 per cent and the risk of other types of malignancy, like oral cancer, is as high as 82 per cent. The chances of prostate cancer among males with blood group O is 62 per cent and of ovarian cancer among females is 56 per cent, said an official.

 Sounding a note of warning for those with blood group O, Roy said: O positive and O negative individuals are more vulnerable to malignancy disorders than the rest and hence, should be extra cautious about their health. They must immediately consult a doctor if they feel any problem or notice any deformity in their body.

 Weekend Romeos torment campus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Rabindra Bharati University campus on BT Road: Eve-teasers on the prowl. A Telegraph picture

 Polly Ghosh (name changed), a student of MA Part I at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU), is running around the Marakat Kunja building on campus, a youth on her trail. The youth lives in Polly?s neighbourhood in Bally, Howrah, and has been harassing her for some time. Her ordeal ends only when guards drive away the youth.

 The incident is not an isolated one at RBU ? the authorities of the BT Road campus are, of late, being flooded with complaints of eve-teasing and harassment. 

 ?In the past month, I myself caught two boys who had entered the campus pretending to be students and were harassing girls, who had turned up to attend the personal contact programme of the distance education courses,? said registrar S.K. Ghorui.

 According to the security officials, 26 cases of harassment were reported in the past three months. Most of the incidents took place on Saturdays and Sundays, when the personal contact classes are held. 

 In almost all cases, road Romeos and agents of various tutorial colleges, who make a beeline to the campus to enrol distance education students, were found to be guilty. 

 A few youths were recently arrested on charges of eve-teasing after the authorities lodged complaints with Cossipore and Belghoria police.

 ?Around 4,000 students, mostly girls, attend the weekend classes. As most of the departments are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, the eve-teasers think the authorities can not act against them even if they get caught,? said Tapas Banerjee, security officer of the university.

 Officials claimed that it was not always possible to prevent unauthorised entry into the campus.

 ?Several students attending the distance education classes come from faraway districts. They are often accompanied by their parents or relatives. So, it is not feasible to enforce a rule that only students would be allowed on the campus. Also, it is difficult to check the identity cards of so many students,? said an official. 

 Some students alleged that agents of tutorial colleges threaten them if they refuse to buy their suggestions or enrol with their coaching classes.

 ?An agent of a Kidderpore- based tutorial centre kept harassing me till I bought a suggestion booklet from him for Rs 50,? said a student.

 Registrar Ghorui said the new RBU campus in Salt Lake will have stricter security.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Chris O?Donnell and Paolo Maldini

 You aim to please, but you also have an inner need to do it your way. You are practical, cool and conscientious. You?d do well in careers like sales and education. Though saving is not your thing, you are clever enough to stay away from financial obligations. ? Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Raped on first visit to city 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 She left home in Burdwan after picking a fight with her mother and came to Calcutta, where she had never been before, to spend a few days with a relative.

 But hours after she stepped into the city on Saturday, she was raped.

 Alone at Howrah station and clueless about the address of the relative, the 23-year-old stepped into a taxi, taken in by the driver?s words of comfort. 

 The driver, instead, took her to a house on Premchand Boral Street, a red-light area, where he raped her repeatedly.

 Early on Sunday, a little over 12 hours after she reached Howrah from Burdwan, the woman found her way to Bowbazar police station and lodged a complaint.

 Based on her description, police identified the place where she had been trapped.

 Following a medical test confirming rape, a case has been registered by Muchipara police station, as Premchand Boral Street falls under its jurisdiction.

 ?It?s an extremely unfortunate incident. We have arrested the man, Chandra Prasad Yadav, who had let out a room to the taxi driver for the night,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (central).

 ?A hunt is on for the driver. It?s difficult to trace him, as the woman did not notice the taxi number. Yet, we will try our best,? he added.

 A resident of Morolpara village, in the Sarkarhat area of Burdwan, the woman left home on Saturday afternoon after a heated quarrel with mother Kalpana. A zari worker and a widow, Kalpana was not too sure about where her daughter was headed for.

 ?From the little she has told us, it appears the victim took a local train and reached Howrah around 5.45 pm. She knew that the relative?s house is in the Hastings area, but had no clue about the address,? said an officer of Muchipara police station.

 At Howrah station, the woman went from one platform to another, asking whoever she could for directions to reach Hastings. 

 But with no help forthcoming, she stepped out of the station and broke down.

 It was then that the taxi driver offered her help. She got into the vehicle and was taken from one place to another. New to the city, she could not make out where she was being taken to.

 ?She could only recall the final stop. She said many women were huddled there and a goat was tied to a post outside the house,? the officer added.

 A team of officers took her out on a round and after visiting certain spots, the woman identified the house on Premchand Boral Street. 

 On a second visit, she identified the man who had let out the room to the driver.

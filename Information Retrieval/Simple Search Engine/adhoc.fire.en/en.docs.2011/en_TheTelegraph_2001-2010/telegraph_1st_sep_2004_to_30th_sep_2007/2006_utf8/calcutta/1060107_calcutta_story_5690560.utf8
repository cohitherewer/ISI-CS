To mark the running of the Calcutta Derby on January 8, the RCTC along with 100 Pipers, presents a concert, Moksh ?

The repertoire includes serious jazz to foot-tapping earth drumming including the drumstick, ocean drums, udu and cyclops, native American buffalo drums to dhamsa and dhak. It is an odyssey traversed from tabla via a host of other musical instruments.

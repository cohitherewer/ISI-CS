 Techie grab sequel, four held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A gang of five abducted software professional Surojit Sikder, 32, from almost the doorstep of his office in Salt Lake?s Sector V on Tuesday evening. 

 While being whisked away in a car towards Chingrihata, he raised an alarm, drawing the attention of a police patrol.

 The cops intercepted the car and rescued Sikder, a Behala resident. Four of the abductors, in their early 30s, have been arrested.

 Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said the gang had abducted Sikder once earlier, around four months ago. He was released after the kidnappers, all residents of Behala and its adjoining areas, were paid a ransom of Rs 70,000.

 On Tuesday, one of the gang members, later identified as Kunal Haldar, had called Sikder on his mobile phone around 5 pm.

 Haldar identified himself as a representative of an FM radio channel and told Sikder that he had won a prize announced by his organisation. Haldar requested Sikder to step out of office and meet him.

 As Sikder came out, Haldar asked him to accompany him to the channel?s office near Rashbehari Avenue, where the prize would be handed over to him. Haldar said a car was waiting nearby.

 Sikder agreed to accompany Haldar to the channel?s office. As they approached the SDF Building, three more youths surrounded Sikder.

 The four then dragged Sikder into the car and told the driver to head for Chingrihata. 

 Realising that he had been abducted, Surojit tried to resist the gang and raised an alarm.

 ?Fortunately, the car got stuck in a traffic snarl and a team of policemen from Bidhannagar (South) police station, deployed at the Chingrihata outpost, heard the distress call. They intercepted the car. Seeing the cops, three of the abductors fled, while the other two fell into the cop net,? said police superintendent Kumar. 

 The arrested duo was Haldar and Shibu Roy.

 ?After a night-long raid, Debu Das and Sentu Jana were arrested. Abhijit is absconding,? the officer added.

 According to Kumar, it was in the car that Sikder realised that it was the same gang that had abducted him four months ago. ?Sikder recognised Haldar, who is also a resident of Behala. The gang had then confined Sikder in an abandoned house and released him after being paid Rs 70,000,? he added.

 During interrogation, Haldar and his gang reportedly admitted to the crime.

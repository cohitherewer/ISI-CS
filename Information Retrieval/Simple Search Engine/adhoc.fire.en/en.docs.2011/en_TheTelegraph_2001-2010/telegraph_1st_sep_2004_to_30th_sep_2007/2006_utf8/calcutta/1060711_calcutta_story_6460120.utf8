 Molest trio held, blames alcohol

 A STAFF REPORTER

 All four accused in the rape of a 17-year-old in the port area are now in the police net.

 A day after arresting Mohammad Jafar on charges of committing the crime, police late on Sunday picked up three of his accomplices.

 Mohammad Phul, Akhtar Ali (alias Jocky) and Mohammad Allarakha have reportedly confessed during interrogation that they had raped the girl under the influence of alcohol.

 All three held on Sunday are in their mid-twenties and residents of Mayurbhanj Road and Bhukailash Road, in the Ekbalpore police station area. With the trio?s arrest, police said the entire gang that had committed the crime is in their custody.

 ?We will not go by mere confessions,? said an officer of South Port police station. ?The four will have to appear before the victim in a test identification parade. Charges will be framed after that.?

 Reconstructing the series of events that led to the rape, an officer said the gang of four had abducted the victim around 7.45 pm last Tuesday, while she was taking a stroll near her Belilious Road house in Howrah.

 She was dragged into the taxi and forced to sit in the back with three of the accused, while Akhtar sat beside the driver.

 From Howrah, the youths came to Remount Road, in the port area, and stopped in front of a dark, abandoned Calcutta Port Trust quarters. The girl was dragged inside and the youths gathered around her downing their drink. They then gangraped her.

 ?It seems the youths had first tried to win over the girl by offering her money. They had, in fact, gone to Howrah to pick up a sex worker. Spotting the 17-year-old girl walking alone, they decided to abduct her,? said an officer.

 ?They brought her to the port area because they are familiar with the locality. They also thought that the Remount Road hideout would be safe,? he added.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that Phul, Akhtar and Allarakha are known in their neighbourhoods for their involvement in ?various criminal activities?, though they had done nothing till the night of July 4 for police to brand them ?hardened criminals?.

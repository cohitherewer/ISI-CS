The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dark tales, dream tunes

 Ya ali wins the Best Song honours in our year-end Bollywood poll. Even as Himesh and Rahman go missing, two of the top five, picked by our readers, are by city boy Pritam

 1. 

 No Himesh. No Rahman. Not even Anu Malik. Pritams Ya 

 ali, which is a copy-paste job of the band Guitaras 

 Ya ghali, is the best song of the year. But only 

 just, with 22.6 per cent votes. The Best Song category 

 has turned out to be the most fiercely contested of 

 them all. While A.R. Rahmans Rang de basanti has 

 just missed out being in the Top Five, Himeshs Jhalak 

 dikhhla ja could manage just four per cent votes! 

 The readers refused to take sides with remixed songs 

 as Dons Yeh mera dil finished right at the bottom 

 of the list. So, Ya ali it is! The Gangster 

 song was initially supposed to be sung by Kailash 

 Kher but Assam wonder boy Zubeen sung the alaap 

 so well that he got the full song.

 2. 

 Onirs Bas Ek Pal may have had just a weeklong 

 run in Calcutta but the Atif Aslam chartbuster Tere 

 bin was able to touch the right chords. With 16.3 

 per cent votes, Tere bin is a thumbs up to new 

 music director Mithoons foray into Bollywood music 

 3. 

 Jatin Lalits swansong in Fanaa gets recognition 

 with Chand sifarish coming third (14.2 per cent 

 votes) in the year-end list. With Kailash Khers Subhanallah 

 refrain, Shaan breezes through what was Aamir Khans 

 opening ode to Kajol in the Kunal Kohli 

 4. 

 Pritam, again! And another Shiney-Kangana movie, too. 

 K.K.s Kya mujhe pyar hai makes it to number four 

 in the SMS poll for Best Song. Woh Lamhe, much like 

 Gangster, scored high on music and, as the Bhatts have 

 shown year in and year out, that is half the job done 

 at the Bolly box-office 

 5. 

 Shankar Ehsaan Loy, who had a mixed year in 2006 with 

 KANK and Don not quite living up to their high standards, 

 manage to sneak into the Top Five with Mitwaa. Pakistani 

 singer Shafqat Amanat Ali makes most of this Javed Akhtar-penned 

 number, picturised on Shah Rukh and Rani

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fewer trams for car flow

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Less than a month after work resumed on the Kidderpore flyover, the traffic police have been forced to seek the help of the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) to ease vehicular movement in the area. 

 The cops have also asked the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), which has taken up the project, to ensure that the flyover is not delayed, since traffic movement over a large area is being affected due to the work.

 ?I visited the construction site and saw the mess. Dumpers had been parked on the road and debris dumped on the sides, leaving very little space for traffic. We have appealed to the CTC to ply fewer trams on the Kidderpore route to allow other vehicles to move freely,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic). 

 Flagged off in 1997 and abandoned in 2000, the Kidderpore flyover received a fresh lease of life in February 2005 after the state government showed the green light for the resumption of the project, with an additional investment of Rs 34.30 crore. After the floating of tenders and other formalities, the flyover construction began recently. 

 With most of the road space taken up from the intersection of CGR Road and Diamond Harbour Road, vehicles can only ply along the tram tracks. Traffic snarls have become common during office time, with cars and buses getting stuck behind trams.

 To complicate matters further, the civic body has dug up a long stretch of Watgunge Street to carry out repairs of underground pipelines. 

 ?Both north and south-bound traffic is facing immense problem in crossing the intersection of Diamond Harbour Road and Watgunge Street. The trams worsen the traffic snarls. Besides, if you are right behind a tram and there is power cut, there is no way you can move ahead,? said a senior officer of the Vidyasagar Setu traffic guard.

 Traffic police officers deployed in the area claimed that power cuts are frequent and the trams often jump the rails.

 The persistent traffic congestion has forced the traffic police brass to request the CTC authorities to cut down on the number of trams plying on the Kidderpore route to allow other vehicles a smoother passage through the zone. 

 The HRBC officials, responsible for ensuring that the flyover is built within the deadline, are upbeat about the project. 

 ?The flyover will help ease the flow of south-bound traffic across the city. Behala and places on Diamond Harbour Road will be easier to reach,? remarked a senior official of the agency. 

 ?We hope to improve the connectivity with the port and establish a better link between the city and South 24-Parganas. The flyover is part of the government?s endeavour to improve transport infrastructure in the city and its peripheral areas,? the HRBC official added.

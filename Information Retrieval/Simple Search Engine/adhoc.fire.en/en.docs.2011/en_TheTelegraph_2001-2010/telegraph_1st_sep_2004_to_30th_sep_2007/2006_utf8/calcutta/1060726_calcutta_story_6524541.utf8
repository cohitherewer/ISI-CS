The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Escape from Borivli blasts

 SANJAY MANDAL

 If he had been couple of yards closer to the train that pulled into Borivli station on the evening of July 11, Moloy Koley may not have lived to recount his near-brush with death.

 On Tuesday, after being discharged from a private city hospital, the 25-year-old who was visiting family and friends in Mumbai, recounted the minutes of madness that could so easily have claimed his life.

 ?I was standing at Borivli station around 6.30 pm when I heard a deafening sound and was flung aside,? said Koley, son of M.K. Koley, an employee with the Airports Authority of India at Calcutta airport.

 ?I lost consciousness on the platform. When I came around, I was still lying on the platform? Everything was blurred and I was not able to think clearly. I only heard voices shouting around me and saw injured and bleeding men and women being taken away,? recounted Koley.

 Bleeding from a gash in his forehead, Koley was helped out of the station by police personnel and a friend, with whom he had gone to Borivli National Park that afternoon and was waiting to catch a train back home.

 ?After the initial shock passed, I felt a severe pain in my stomach that persisted even when I returned to Calcutta and so I got admitted to hospital,? said Koley, who had gone to Mumbai two weeks before the blasts and was staying at Nalasopara.

 After being treated by a doctor, Koley tried to contact his family but could not get through. He finally managed to contact them the next day.

 For his father, mother Anima and younger brother Prahlad, the night of July 11 was the longest. ?We spent a sleepless night? We finally heard from him the next day and told him to return at once,? his father stated.

 On Tuesday afternoon, Koley was discharged from Apollo Gleneagles Hospital and he returned to his Singur home in Hooghly.

 ?His condition is stable now,? said surgeon Sudip Roy. ?He is okay now but if his stomach pain recurs, then he must come to the hospital for a check- up.?

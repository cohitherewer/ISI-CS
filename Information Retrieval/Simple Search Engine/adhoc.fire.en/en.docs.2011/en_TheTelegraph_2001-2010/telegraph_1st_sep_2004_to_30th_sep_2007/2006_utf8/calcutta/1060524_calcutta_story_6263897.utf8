The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Romance in reality realm

 The space remains constant but the clock goes back and forth in SHOOJIT SIRCAR?s next directorial venture being scripted by Gulzar, finds Pratim D. Gupta

 After shooting Yahaan 

 in Kashmir, Shoojit Sircar is planning his next film 

 in HimachalSaif Ali Khan is slated to play the lead 

 in Shoojit?s untitled new venture 

 His Amarjeet hasn?t been able to take off in the dingy north Calcutta bylanes thanks to the actor in the title role, opposite Lara Dutta, being missing in action. So, even as he shoots the biggest of celebrities in minute-long commercials, Shoojit Sircar continues his quest for a fitting follow-up to his impressive directorial debut, Yahaan.

 While Amarjeet?s stuck because neither Sunny Deol or Ajay Devgan or Viveik Oberoi could be locked as the lawyer fighting Lara?s case in the film, Shoojit?s other ambitious venture about an LTTE soldier is also not working out at the moment. 

 But these delays have actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise with the director recently striking gold, literally. Shoojit?s got Gulzar ? who penned the songs of Yahaan ? to write the screenplay of what should be his next film. While the master lyricist had written the dialogues for Saathiya, this is the first time he will be scripting a feature film after his own directorial venture Hu Tu Tu in 1999. 

 ?Around six months back, I thought of a story and narrated it to Gulzarsaab and he liked it instantly,? Shoojit says. ?Initially, he was inclined to write just the dialogues and lyrics for the film but then as we kept discussing the idea, I asked him: ?Why don?t you write the screenplay too?? And he agreed to write it.?

 It was the intriguing story that drew Gulzar so close to the film. ?It?s a love story played out between two time zones separated by 50 years,? Shoojit reveals. ?While there is a time difference, the space remains the same. The story is set against the backdrop of the laying of railway tracks between Solan and Kalka in Shimla. Apart from the present time period, the other time zone is in the 1940s when Shimla was the summer capital of the British.?

 For over a month now, Shoojit and Gulzar have been sitting every evening for a two-hour session. ?We have finished the basic structure of the screenplay and now he has also started writing the dialogues,? the man from Barrackpore says. ?Gulzarsaab is a master screenplay writer and it is an absolute delight to interact with him. I wait the whole day for those two hours when I can discuss my film with him.?

 To be produced by Ramesh Taurani of Tips, Shoojit?s untitled venture will be shot in Himachal and Palampur, apart from an elaborate high-voltage under-the-waterfall action sequence in New Zealand. 

 ?I intend to start by the end of the year or early next year,? he adds. ?First we have to lock in the stars. Both Gulzarsaab and I have Saif in mind for the male lead. The girl is yet to be decided. Shantanu (Moitra) should do the music even though the producer has to take that call.?

 While he plans to rope in Saif for the big screen, he?s recently shot everybody from Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan to Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Zohra Sehgal for the small screen.

 Saif Ali Khan is slated to play the lead 

 in Shoojits untitled new venture

Says Shoojit: ?I have shot Mr Bachchan before on a number of occasions. This latest ad was for Cadbury?s which is already on air. He plays a villager in the storyboard. The man is an absolute legend and learns his character so well once he knows the script.?

 For Dhoni?s Sonata commercial, Shoojit decided to go for a nostalgia trip. ?In the ad, he?s going to meet his old friend in Jamshedpur, the place he hails from,? the prolific ad-maker says. ?I found Dhoni to be a very good actor knowing exactly how to perform. Since he is a very down-to-earth person, we connected very well.?

 The clincher, however, was the Titan ad with Aamir Khan and Zohra Sehgal where she agrees to his marriage because of the wrist watch. ?While Aamir is always very good, Zohra Sehgal at 94 is simply on fire,? Shoojit says excitedly. 

 ?Whenever she is on the sets, there is so much life and everyone is having so much fun. She just walked in and recited a sher to Aamir addressing him as the greatest actor and how privileged she was to work with him. It was amazing...?

 But it is on the movie sets that Shoojit wants to call the shots really soon. And with the backdrop shifting from Kashmir to Himachal, it?s set to be another rich romantic rendezvous.

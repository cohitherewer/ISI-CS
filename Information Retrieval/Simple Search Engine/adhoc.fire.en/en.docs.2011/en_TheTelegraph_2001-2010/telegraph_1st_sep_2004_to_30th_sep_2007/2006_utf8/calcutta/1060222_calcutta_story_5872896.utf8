The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Nowadays, autorickshaws have become the main reason behind the pandemonium on the city roads. Travelling by autos is becoming dangerous by the day. Auto drivers are reckless in the narrow lanes and by-lanes of the city and its outskirts, where most of the time traffic guards or sergeants are not present. One such route is Baguiati-Satgachhi, where six passengers squeeze into an auto at a time. The autos don?t have proper headlights, and moreover, many drivers here don?t have a valid licence. I would like to request the authorities to take adequate steps to stop the nuisance. 

 Shubhajit Chakraborty, 

 Salt Lake. 

 These past few months, I am not receiving my letters and parcels on time. I have suffered huge financial losses on a few occasions because of this. I request the postal department officials to look into the matter. 

 Mahesh Prasad,

 Hooghly. 

 During my recent visit to Mumbai, I observed that the local trains there are much better-maintained. Eastern and South Eastern railway coaches are no patch on them. The bogies are dirty and the seats do not have planks. In comparison, the trains in Mumbai and Chennai are punctual and have proper seating arrangements. I request the railway authorities to take prompt action for proper upkeep of the bogies and railway platforms.

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum.

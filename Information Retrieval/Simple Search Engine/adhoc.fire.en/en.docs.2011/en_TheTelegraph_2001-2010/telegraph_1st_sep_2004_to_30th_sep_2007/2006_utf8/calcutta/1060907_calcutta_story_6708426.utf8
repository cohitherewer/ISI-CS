 Satabdi, Pathasena and Aina, three theatre groups led by Badal Sircar, presented Nichak Bhuter Gappo, Hatta Malar Opare and Karigor on the premises of Loreto Day School Sealdah in the last week of August. This is one of their regular venues, along with the Nandan complex, where they perform on the first and third Sundays of every month from 3 pm.

 Although there are no tickets and no formal pre-event publicity, every week the groups find an audience. In Loreto, the audience mostly comprise underprivileged children who are given shelter on the campus at night. But on August 25, 26 and 29, word of mouth publicity had roped in many others as well.

 The four to 12-year-olds squatted around the performance area and watched in wide-eyed disbelief as ghosts in long-sleeved black robes and masks pranced around scaring villagers in Nichak Bhuter Gappo. Because the theatre groups use very few props, minimal lighting and no audio aids, the stress is on the acting and background music.

 Nichak Bhuter Gappo focuses on the attempts of a young man to make the poor villagers realise how their ignorance is making them susceptible to exploitation. Based on Sunil Gangopadhyays Garam Bhat O Bhuter Galpo, the play was first staged in the 1980s. It was brought out from cold storage two years ago after Pathasena was convinced of its continuing importance, said one of its members.

 Hatta Malar Opare, a play written by Badal Sircar and presented by Satabdi, also forces viewers to take a second look at society and human behaviour. Based on a story by Premendra Mitra and Leela Mazumdar, the play revolves around two thieves who fall into a river while trying to escape and reach the other side of Hattamala (which is our known world). Beyond Hattamala the laws and social norms we know dont work and the thieves face new problems.

 Karigor, written by members of Aina, uses a fantasy to convey the tension, strongly felt today, between commerce and artistic creativity.

 Within and Without (Antare-Bahire), 

 an exhibition of photographs by 12 underprivileged children 

 from Kalighat, was organised by The Daywalka Foundation 

 in collaboration with New Light Home at Oxford Bookstore 

 on August 25 (Picture by Pradip Sanyal).

 The children were divided into six groups, each of which was given a camera. They were then asked to photograph their neighbourhood and the world outside. We were free to choose any topic, said Mohd Asiq, one of the young photographers.

 It was the first time that most 

 of the kids were handling a camera. Initially, I could 

 not do anything with the camera. But then I slowly learned, 

 said Feroza.

 Captain's call

 Entertainment channel for kids Hungama TV is all set to 

 launch its third season of Parle-G Hungama TV Captains Hunt. 

 The objective of the hunt this year is to find some of the 

 smartest kids in order to quot;find and shape the future 

 leaders of India quot;.

 After scouring almost 500 schools 

 across Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, 

 Ludhiana, Lucknow, Indore and Baroda, the channel will shortlist 

 1,000 students within the age group of eight to 14 years 

 by mid-September.

 quot;The entry forms will be 

 distributed in various schools in the cities. The test has 

 been designed after the format of the Common Admission Test 

 (CAT) in order to assess their IQ,. said Siddharth Roy Kapoor, 

 senior vice-president of marketing and communications,UTV.

 Based on further rounds of elimination, 

 comprising group discussions and extempore on varied topics, 

 the aspirants will be evaluated on grounds of articulation, 

 intelligence,

 ambition, confidence and talent, after which the selected 

 20 semi-finalists will fight it out in the grand finale 

 in Mumbai.

 The final 10 contestants join 

 the board of directors as captains.Appointed for a year, 

 they will play an integral part in evaluation of the feedback 

 from the audience and taking decisions on planning and programming 

 on what they feel calls for the success and failings of 

 a show on Hungama TV.

 quot;The select group of children 

 will continue with their normal routine but will be brought 

 to Mumbai to attend board meetings, held on a quarterly 

 basis,when we also ensure that they have a plenty of fun, quot; 

 said Kapoor.

 quot;The quality of response that we' ve received from 

 children in the contest in the previous years has been very 

 good. We have incorporated changes based on

 their inputs. quot;

 With a range of opportunities 

 in store for the captains, the budding leaders will enjoy 

 the scope of seeking guidance from a Captains Advisory Council, 

 comprising leaders from the fields of politics, sports, 

 entertainment and education. The personalities will mentor 

 these children.

 The final captains will be with 

 proper funding and coaching, so that their talents are nurtured. 

 quot;Unlike our other contest John Aur Kaun,where we are 

 looking for performers, here we are on the lookout for young 

 leaders whose talents can be fostered. So, once a

 captain, always a captain, quot; asserted Kapoor. The grand 

 finale of the Captains Hunt will be telecast on Hungama 

 TV sometime during the first week of January next year.

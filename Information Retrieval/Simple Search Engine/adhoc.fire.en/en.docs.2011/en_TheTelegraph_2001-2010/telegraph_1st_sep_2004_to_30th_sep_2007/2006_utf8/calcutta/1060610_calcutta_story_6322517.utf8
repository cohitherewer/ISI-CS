Life

 Watch out while you workout 

 Even the most commonly-used 

 gym equipment demand certain rules to be followed for optimum 

 effect. Shradha Agarwal finds out the fitness 

 facts 

 Talking on the cellphone 

 and turning around are strict no-nos while working out 

 on most gym equipment 

 Chocolates and cheese are out. 

 All waking hours are spent in the gym. Yet the waistline 

 is growing. 

 Its a common complaint. Maybe its time to check if, instead of you, the workout is really working out.

 GoodLife picks the most commonly used gym equipment and explores how to use them most effectively. 

 Treadmill

 The most popular piece of equipment always comes with a queue and a huge rush to hop onto it. That apart, the treadmill can be defined as a machine that simulates outside walking conditions, lending a complete lower body workout, increasing stamina and burning fat. Some treadmills also have special courses like hill climbing and random programmes that simulate a trek. 

 But simple as it may look, the treadmill demands following some rules. Fitness expert at Solace, Preetom Mukheree Roy lists a few. 

 Dont drink water 

 while walking. Unless you are an expert, dont assume 

 that you can handle too many things ? bottles, glasses ? 

 on the treadmill.

 Dont talk. On the 

 mobile, or with your neighbour. 

 Dont turn around. 

 Use the mirror reflection to communicate with gym buddies. 

 Walk straight, concentrating 

 on the placing of your feet. 

 It is a simulation of 

 real walking, so theres no need to hold on for dear 

 life. The handles are for an emergency. 

 The incline should be 

 inversely proportional to the speed ? the steeper the slope, 

 the slower the speed. 

 Wear the safety clip with 

 its string attached to the emergency stop button. If you 

 trip, the string yanks off the stop button and the treadmill 

 comes to a halt.

 Never leave shoelaces 

 untied. Stop, tie and then continue.

 Always focus and be aware 

 of what youre doing. 

 Bike

 An exercise cycle works the lower muscles and simulates outdoor cycling. It offers various courses like cross-country and also recreates different terrain as well as a flat, straight course. 

 Recumbent cycles have a back support and hence the correct posture is easily maintained, but in an upright cycle the posture must be checked at regular intervals. 

 Fight the tendency to 

 lean forward because it could lead to back pain. Neural 

 alignment has to be straight, says Bijoy Sarkar, head 

 fitness instructor at Golds Gym. 

 It is okay to drink water 

 on the cycle, but use a sipper.

 Firmly grip the handles 

 during the workout.

 Row machine

 Just like rowing a boat, a rowing machine helps a total body workout, burning more calories.

 Though a rowing machine offers no separate courses, a simultaneous lower and upper body workout is possible by adjusting resistance and speed, says Preetom.

 Bijoy says that the back must always be contracted 

 because this is the only equipment that moves the entire body. 

 Apply even pressure. 

 Push off with the legs 

 and simultaneously pull with the upper body. 

 Movement should be fluid, 

 not jerky. 

 Cross trainer

 The cross trainer is designed to simulate cross-country skiing and jogging.

 Its elliptical movement, says Preetom, ensures little strain on the knees. A complete upper and lower body exercise, it helps burn a lot of calories. Various courses like hill and aerobic conditioning add to the high. 

 Dont lift the heel 

 off the footrest, says Bijoy. 

 The placement should be 

 even and the feet should stay on the same mark ? so watch 

 out every few minutes. Not adhering to this can lead 

 to uneven toning of the legs, adds Preetom. 

 Like with other cardio-vascular 

 machines, ignore cellphones and television. Concentration 

 is a must. 

 Watch the posture and 

 keep the spinal column stretched. 

 Strength machines 

 These machines go a long way to increase muscular strength and endurance. Great for body sculpting, firming and toning of inches, these pieces, unlike free weights, are great without causing worry about balance and form. Whats more is that the cables ensure fluid movements, causing little strain on the joints. 

 The most commonly used ones are the high-lat pulley, leg presses and the pec-dec often referred to as the butterfly. 

 Adjust the machine according 

 to height, otherwise you are not working the right area. 

 Never let the plates touch 

 each other, they should stop short of contact. This ensures 

 fluid movement. 

 The machine should not 

 be controlling you; you should control the machine. 

 Very heavy weights can 

 result in injury. 

 Breathe out in the positive 

 repetition and inhale during the negative repetition. The 

 initial movement is called positive while the movement of 

 going back to the starting position is the negative one. 

 The second requires more resistance.

 A thought for food

 What: Curtain-raiser to International Institute of Hotel Managements (IIHM) seventh Food and Drink Festival, presented in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: The institute premises in Sector V, Salt Lake.

 When: December 13. The event will be held at Nalban on December 22 and 23.

 Take a look: Students of the institute welcomed guests with tilak and rose. We must learn to do everything as it happens the professional way, explained one of the front office students. Inside, a presentation was on. Final-year students Cyrus and Soumyajit were teaching the basics of Mediterranean cuisine. There was another series of slides on wines. At the bar counter, trainer Niladri Sarkar started off a balancing act with many a bottle.

 The spread: As many as 45 dishes were awaiting the guests as soon as they put down their glasses. That in itself was not easy considering there were products of the vineyards of the US and south-eastern Australia, wood-stored port from Portugal and a range from Chateau Indage other than vodka, gin and whisky on offer. Those who carried the glasses into the dining area were given tips on which drink goes with which main course. So, pair Quail a la Milanaise with Riviera white wine, Pesce Spada Alla Grigtia with Vin Ballet White Wine and so on.

 But before that, there were the nine kinds of salads to be had. The longest-to-cook item at the festival was Lamb Shoulder on Saffron Pilaf. The festival brought dishes whose names gave away little of what they were. How many of us would know Mazzancolle alla Roma as crumb-fried prawns or Samak Harra to be spicy fish, cooked Lebanese style? But that hardly deterred the crowd, that just went by the look of the dishes.

 In the dessert section, there was something for the diabetic too. The Orange Salad uses natural fruits while the Dates Banana Pudding avoids sugar and uses diet cream. A lot of research is underway on how to make diet food, especially desserts, said IIHM faculty member in bakery, Joydeep Arya.

 Voiceover: We try to follow authentic recipes, explained Vinay Goel, in charge of the event among the students. So much so that many of the rarer herbs were brought down from Delhi. 

 Davide Cananzi, executive chef of The Park, gave the students a thumbs up. The boys are right to say that it is the dawn of the wine era. Wine is increasingly being accepted as the right complement for dinner, especially for grilled meat or seafood, he said.

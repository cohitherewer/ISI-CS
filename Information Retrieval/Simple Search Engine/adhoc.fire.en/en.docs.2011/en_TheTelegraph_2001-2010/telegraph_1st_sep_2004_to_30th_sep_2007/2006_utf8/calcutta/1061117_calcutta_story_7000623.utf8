 Pay tax to spruce up tech hub 

 KINSUK BASU

 Saltlec will be doing tomorrow what tech hubs like Cyberabad and Noida have been doing since yesterday. The Nabadiganta Township Authority is poised to impose a corporate tax to generate funds for the revamp and maintenance of the electronics complex in Salt Lakes Sector V. 

 The recently-formed nodal authority plans to collect Re 1 per sq ft from firms operating in the information technology hub. The rate in Cyberabad, Bengaluru and Noida ranges from 60 paise to Rs 1.50 per sq ft.

 Its not something that has been decided in haste. We had several rounds of talks with representatives of different bodies before drawing up the draft proposal, said Nabadiganta chairman S.A. Ahmed. There will be another round of talks before the proposal is passed. I dont foresee roadblocks.

 The confidence stems from assurances by Sector V firms, some of whom occupy over 650,000 sq ft, who are willing to pay a price for proper infrastructure.

 Heads of several companies, claimed Nabadiganta officials, have expressed their support for the new tax, on condition that the funds will be used for the upgrade of water supply, sewerage, street lights, road repair and transport system.

 If you look at the national scenario, the tax structure is on a par with others. If the amount collected is utilised for revamping services, it should be fine, said Rabindra Chamaria, chairman of Infinity. 

 Nabadiganta has picked an agency to spruce up the tech hub, by setting up street furniture, help booths and bus shelters, besides decorating the area with plants and lights, said Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar. 

 With CMDA, Nabadiganta will build two food courts. The bigger one, near Nalban, will have space to host conferences.

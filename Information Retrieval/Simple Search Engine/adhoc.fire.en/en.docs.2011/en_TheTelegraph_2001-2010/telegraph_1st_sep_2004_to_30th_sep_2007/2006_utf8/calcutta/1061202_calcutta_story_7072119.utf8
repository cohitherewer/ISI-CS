 What: 

 Launch of Dzing collection. 

 Where: The Gold Factory, 

 Gariahat (next to Pam shopping mall).

 When: November 29.

 Be dazzled: Running out 

 of luck these days? Try sporting Tibetan dzi beads, 

 known to bring good luck by warding off the evil eye. A 

 real dzi is a rarity, but its imitation is largely 

 used for ornamentation. The beads have distinctive geometric 

 patterns created in dark lines on an artificially whitened 

 background.

 The in-house design team at The 

 Gold Factory has beautifully blended Tibetan dzi 

 beads with gold and red glass beads. With its contemporary 

 ethnic look, it can be worn on all occasions. In Tibet, 

 genuine dzi of unusual patterns continues to be valued 

 far above any natural stone.

 The Dzing collection will be available 

 in both the outlets of The Gold Factory at Gariahat and 

 Behala.

 Pocket pinch: Necklaces 

 and earrings are priced at Rs 3,000-plus.

 Voiceover: The Gold Factory 

 is all about innovative combination jewellery. In the past, 

 we have experimented with exotic combinations of ceramic, 

 beetle-nuts, shells, terracotta, bamboo, thewa with 

 gold and now with dzi beads, said Brinda Ganguly 

 Sirkar from The Gold Factory.

 What: 

 Epar-Bangla Opar-Bangla, a fashion show. 

 Where: The Poolside Pub 

 at Calcutta Swimming Club.

 When: June 3, 9 pm onwards.

 Take a look: The event 

 showcased ensembles from designer Santanu Guha Thakurtas 

 spring-summer collection. Models Sraboni, Joyita, Poojashree 

 and Indira sashayed down in summer saris, salwar suits, 

 kurtis and dupattas. 

 The colour story revolved around 

 sober pastels as well as bright reds and greens. The designs, 

 a blend of traditional and contemporary, were accentuated 

 with kathiawari, Gujarati and zardosi embroideries 

 and cutwork, block and hand prints. 

 The first sequence showcased Bangladeshi 

 Dhakai Jamdanis. Handpicked from Rupshi, a village in Bangladesh, 

 the weave is a blend of silk and cotton, rendering a subtle 

 shine to the fabric. Traditional butis and borders 

 ruled this sequence.

 Loose lowers and flowing kameezes 

 made up the collection of cotton salwar suits in 

 block prints. Next in line were kurtis in crepe and 

 georgette teamed with minis and capris. Sequins and light 

 embroidery make them suitable for parties and evenings out.

 The fourth sequence showcased 

 chiffon, organza, tussar and cotton dupattas 

 that can be teamed with salwar suits and Indo-western 

 attires.

 Voiceover: The collection 

 is a fusion of Bangladeshi and Indian sensibilities. Much 

 of it was conceived in Bangladesh, when I discussed trends 

 with Bangladeshi designers like Rina Latif, Zumaira Khan 

 and Lipi. The collection will also be displayed in an exhibition 

 held in Dhaka in September, said designer Santanu 

 Guha Thakurta.

 Stylish 60s

 What: Summer Wear Wardrobe, 

 a fashion show. 

 Where: Royal Calcutta Golf 

 Club. 

 When: Saturday night. 

 Take a look: Lots of white 

 and a splash of pastels set the mood. The silhouettes were 

 simple and summery, going perfectly with the weather. Adding 

 to it all was not regular trance but old 60s numbers like 

 Pyaar hua, Babuji dheere chalna, Aplam 

 chaplam and Chand mera dil.

 The garments showcased on the 

 ramp were by labels Aakriti, Swish, Shradha Manaktala, Modi 

 Jalans Creation and Mayur Saraogi. Mostly saris, suits 

 and kurtis along with Mayur Saraogis mens 

 creations presented a very wearable look.

 The jewellery was by Shreejee, 

 R.R. Agarwal and Diamond Dimension. City models like Jessica, 

 Tina, Ishika, Priyanka Kohli, Shreya Pandey, Anusmriti, 

 Sumit and Rishi walked the ramp. The make-up was done by 

 Tressbay salon.

 Voiceover: There 

 is an overdose of western influence in fashion. The idea 

 behind this show was to go back to 60s, the era of Meena 

 Kumari and Raj Kapoor, said choreographer Prithvi 

 Raj Ghosh.

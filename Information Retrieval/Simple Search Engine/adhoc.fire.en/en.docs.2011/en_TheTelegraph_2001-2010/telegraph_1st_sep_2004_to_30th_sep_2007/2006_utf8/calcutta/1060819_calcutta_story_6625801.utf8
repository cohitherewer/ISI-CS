 Writer, actor and director, Utpal Dutt (1929 - 1993), was a radical figure who dominated Bengali theatre and cinema for over four decades. Under the aegis of Airtel Expressions, Airtel is commemorating the death anniversary of the stage-legend with a three-day festival of plays (at Rabindra Sadan), beginning today. Organised in association with Peoples Little Theatre and government of West Bengal, the festival will feature the plays Noti, Manusher Odhikare (produced by Beharampore Repertoire; tomorrow at 6.30 pm) and Louho Manab (produced by Peoples Little Theatre; August 21 at 6.30 pm).

 Parents know how tough it is to 

 deal with Gen X kids when it comes to their music. The tech-savvy 

 tot demands his own music, and sometimes, his own system. 

 But much as your child claims 

 to know the workings of the swank audio system, you are 

 not comfortable with him fidgeting with an electronic gadget. 

 You would like him to be safe and the music system in 

 one piece, too! 

 The little ones would be happy 

 to know that theres a range of radios just for them. 

 Archies has come up with little cartoon-shaped radios.

 Children can relate to these. 

 They are popular with pre-teen kids. Parents readily agree 

 to buy them as they are not only functional but make for 

 great room decor for children, too, says Gautam Shroff 

 from Archies in City Centre.

 Imported mostly from China, these 

 plastic radios come in a host of eyecatching shapes. With 

 the FIFA fever in full swing, it is the miniature football 

 in black and white that would catch the attention of tiny 

 Beckham and Ronaldinho fans. 

 Getting wet in the rain is fun, 

 but mummy may not like it. The dewdrop shaped radio is surely 

 some consolation. Sneakers on and lanky royal blue hands 

 that move in all direction, Mr Water Drop is surely fond 

 of activity. The bright popping eyes act as the reset and 

 scan buttons.

 A green little naughty frog winks 

 at you. Its pink blushes on both cheeks are the function 

 keys. Also on offer are radios that look like maple leaves 

 and apples.

 A heart-shaped soft toy in pink 

 and mauve is another radio. Prices start at Rs 175 and can 

 go up to Rs 499.

 Ghosts and the dark

 THE UNSEEN WORLD IS EXACTLY 

 AS FAR FROM MIDTOWN AS HER BEDROOM IS. AND IT IS OPEN ALL 

 NIGHT, REVEALS CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 I am scared of the dark. I dont 

 believe in them, but I am afraid of ghosts. Ditto for God, 

 though I dont know if He is a He. I am afraid of men, 

 too.

 I dont know which of them 

 it is, but when I have to spend a night alone in a flat, 

 I am terrified of all of them and the unseen world closes 

 in upon me. 

 Its the bedroom window primarily. 

 I come back from work, I take a bath, I wear a loose dress, 

 I have my dinner, I watch TV. I clean my ears. I massage 

 my little toe on my left foot with anti-wrinkle cream and 

 watch it grow younger. I am ready to retire. Or so I think. 

 I pick up War and Peace 

 and lie down on my bed. (PG Wodehouse prescribes reading 

 out Russian novels to the offender as a form of punishment. 

 I wont go so far, but if not anything else, their 

 weight, I think, ensures burning calories and lulling me 

 to sleep.) I switch off the light. Then it starts to happen... 

 I cant take my eyes off 

 the window. The window seems to be floating on a sea of 

 darkness. The darkness is crawling with possibilities. 

 Its silly, I know, but do 

 I see a shape forming? A head, faceless, bobbing on the 

 darkness? A mass of darkness, darker than the dark, separating 

 itself from the night just to see what I have got to say 

 to it?

 I get up and switch on the light. 

 Then I go back to the living room and switch on the TV. 

 I tune into a news channel at volume 16. It sounds almost 

 like conversation.

 But the window is not the only 

 source of trouble. Back to bed, I have to keep a watch on 

 the door, too.

 I lie supine, glancing right at 

 the window once, left at the door next. It is exercise for 

 my neck for which I dont have time during the day. 

 If I go on long enough, I will be a Kathakali expert.

 The unseen world is exactly as 

 far from midtown as my bedroom is. And it is open all night. 

 But what am I afraid of? Not I 

 alone. So many of the women friends living alone admit to 

 doing this. Why do men fare better? Do women marry just 

 to get rid of the darkness?

 What is behind this experience, 

 asks Woody Allen. Or for that matter, he charges, in front 

 of them?

 Fortunately, he adds, 

 these questions about psychic phenomena are answered 

 in a soon to be published work, Boo! by Dr Osgood 

 Mulford Twelge, the noted parapsycholologist and professor 

 of ectoplasm at Columbia University. I will read the 

 book.

 I will read the book, but could 

 it be something that had happened in the course of the day?

 When I was living in Mira Road 

 in Mumbai, one of the security men turned up at my door 

 on a still Sunday afternoon when all my neighbours were 

 sleeping, and demanded a drink of fridge water.

 The fierceness with which he demanded 

 it and the look in his eyes suggested that it was not fridge 

 water alone that he was after. He also knew that I didnt 

 have a fridge.

 Five years later, am I still expecting 

 him to turn up in the dead of the night?

 Living in the Mira Road flat, 

 I had another deadly experience. Every night when I returned 

 home, switched on the lights and flung open the curtains 

 (something I like to do; it lets the world in), I would 

 let the world in.

 I would always find a row of disembodied 

 hands in a row waving at me from a window of the flat opposite 

 me. When I went to the other room, the hands would follow 

 me, too. They would be there as long as the lights would 

 burn in my flat.

 Then the security men, yes, including 

 the one above, found out that a group of young men sharing 

 the flat knew I was alone and were entertaining themselves.

 That they were from Calcutta, 

 too, added another dimension to my experience. But disembodied 

 hands are followed by torsos and feet and it was not easy 

 going to bed with such knowledge. 

 Am I expecting them to turn up 

 still? And suddenly, a scene from The Sixth Sense the 

 one in which a young girl with a terribly mutilated face 

 leaps up from below the bed erupts in my mind. With the 

 sound effect. Then I realise that it is something rattling 

 inside the fan.

 I must have fallen asleep, for 

 I am awake again. The gentle breeze had blown the curtain 

 in and it touched me and woke me up.

 Now the darkness outside seems 

 to have cooled down and the soul floats up, hovers over 

 my body and swims out, out of my flat, descends slowly down 

 the stairwell, floats up it again, gingerly enters the flat 

 and reunites with my body. I have checked out the darkness. 

 Then I lie awake again. In the 

 giant multi-storeyeds around me, which look like ghost ships 

 looming on the night, there are some flats a few, very 

 few where the lights are still shining.

 There are people like me. People 

 who live through the night. 

 I see the first streak of light 

 on the grey sky. Another day begins.

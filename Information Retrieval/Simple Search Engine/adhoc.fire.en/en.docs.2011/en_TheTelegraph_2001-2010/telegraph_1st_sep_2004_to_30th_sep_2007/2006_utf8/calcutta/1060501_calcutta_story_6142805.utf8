A petal-soft skin is what you wish your child would 

possess throughout his or her life. But the supple feel is often lost earlier 

than you think, given the stress and strain of todays lifestyle.

 Responding to the roll call at a neighbourhood kindergarten from nine months of age, preparing for class tests, anxiously awaiting good results, slogging it out at tuition classes, busy juggling extra-curricular activities, grabbing a burger or pizza on the run? All this and, of course, the dirt and smoke take a toll on the young skin quite prematurely.

 Dark circles, roughness, rashes, acne? the tender skin could suffer them all. But promising to take care of all these is a plethora of kids beauty care solutions flooding the market.GoodLife scouts the kids cosmetic market ? a real baby boomer.

 Retail roll

 This new segment of the cosmetic industry is growing really fast, feels Shiv H. Daswani of Little Shop in Forum.

 Higher disposable income, greater awareness and consumers growing out of an age-old brand loyalty mould are some of the major factors, he points out.

 Earlier, parents would have to be satisfied with the limited range of bare essentials like kids shampoos and soaps. But now they are spoilt for choice and mothers are confident enough to experiment with a variety of imported brands on offer.

 And why not?

 The foreign companies send their bestsellers to this part of the world and these products become instant hits, feels Shiv.

 In the past three years, Little Shop in Forum has witnessed a major sales spurt in the cosmetics section. Reason enough for it to give this section more footage at the next store in South City Mall.

 Imported kids cosmetics definitely has a fan following, feel industry players. Kids today grow up seeing their moms taking proper beauty care, hence from a young age they are aware of their skin and hair requirements, says Naveen Misra, unit head of Shoppers Stop in Forum.

 One might sweet-talk parents to go in for a particular dress or toy, but when it comes to choosing cosmetics, no amount of tricks will work. Mothers today are well-read and beauty conscious themselves. They perfectly know the utility of each element in a composition and what is best suited for their little ones, points out Ankur Agarwal, proprietor of Please Mom, a kids store at City Centre.

 Market watch

Please Mom houses Japanese and Singaporean brands 

like Tollijoy and Pigeon. While products from Tollijoy are pH-balanced and boast 

of aloe vera, Pigeon stocks items with jojoba extracts.

 The Tollijoy shampoo cleanses the hair without depleting its natural oil and the body lotion shields the child against weather irritants with a long-lasting fragrance.

 The lotion from Pigeon maintains optimum skin moisture and the liquid soap protects sensitive skin. The shampoo keeps the hair tangle-free and promises not to sting the eye.

 The Banana Boat sunscreen is waterproof with aloe vera and vitamin E and provides protection from UVA and UVB rays. You can find select Tollijoy products in both the Shoppers Stop outlets at Forum and City Centre.

 At Little Shop you have an assortment of Tollijoy, Pigeon and UK-based Mother Care products.

 Most Mother Care items include camomile extracts. The powder is hypoallergenic and dermatologically tested, the body oil contains olive oil and aloe vera, the conditioning shampoo contains honey, camomile and aloe vera extracts.

 One can pick up Mother Care products from Pantaloons too.

 Salon way

 Kids are very conscious these days and beauty forms a major part of their chit-chat, especially among the girls. They discuss products, exchange tips and are receptive to advice. I think there shouldnt be an obsessive inquisitiveness, but some awareness is good, says beauty expert Bridgette Jones.

 At June Tomkyns, on Ballygunge Circular Road, tress wash with chemical-free, cola-flavoured Biotouch Kids Shampoo from Wella is a hit. Another favoured session is the head massage with almond oil.

 At Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon on Sarat Bose Road, kids can treat themselves to mini facials, mini manicure and pedicure.

 A mini facial includes deep cleansing, mild exfoliation followed by a clay mask that keeps away impurities and guards against over-secretion of oil glands.

 A mini manicure and pedicure includes pampering the kids with a bubble bath followed by a gentle rub with a soft brush, an after-massage that is rounded off with nail art. The net result: Kids simply love it.

 Bridgette uses a special line of childrens products from Oriflame.

 She recommends some amount of daily home care. When kids are seven or eight years old, they need to be taught hygiene habits, proper application of shampoo and other products, she feels.

 Bridgette also plans to organise beauty workshops for the little ones that will blend fun with skin and hair care facts.

 Home care

 Bridgette draws up a daily routine for the tot kings and queens:

 Two showers a day is necessary, using a loofah for scrubbing the body.

 Use a gentle cleanser for the face, avoid using soap.

 Applying cream and body lotion is a must for those sleeping in air-conditioned rooms. Use sunscreen while going outdoors.

 Avoid using too much powder. Roll-on deodorants are always better than sprays.

 Four to five almonds in the daily diet can work magic. If the child is not too fond of almonds, grind them and put it in lentils.

 Combine the top 10 food items for the perfect diet, the secret to good skin and hair: oatmeal, egg, peanut butter, yoghurt, water melon, broccoli, sweet potato, soya/tofu/fish, brown rice/whole wheat bread and sweet lime juice.

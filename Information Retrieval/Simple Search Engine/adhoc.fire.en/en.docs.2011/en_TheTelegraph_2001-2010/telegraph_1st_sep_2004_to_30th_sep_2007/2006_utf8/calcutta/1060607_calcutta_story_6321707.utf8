All-star smash hit

Screen On amp; Off

 Ace anchor: Diana Hayden

 As FedEx charges into the round of 16 at the French Open, watch him all smiles by the side of arch-rival Rafael on the red carpet. The occasion is the seventh annual Laureus World Sports Awards, in Barcelona. The Oscar of sports will be telecast on Sahara One this Sunday, June 11, at 8 pm.

 The Laureus World Sports Awards honours the greatest sportsmen and women across all sports every year. Tennis was the big winner at this year?s edition in Barcelona as Switzerland?s Roger Federer and Martina Hingis, along with Spain?s Rafael Nadal won major honours. The Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year Award went to Croatia?s ski star Janica Kostelic, who has won more Olympic Alpine skiing medals than any other woman.

 Hosted by actress-model Diana Hayden, guests included Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman, CSI Miami star Adam Rodriguez and Argentine supermodel Valeria Mazza. But what?s sport to Indians without cricket? So, there would be a dose of bat and ball with Ian Botham, Kapil Dev and Steve Waugh representing Laureus World Sports Academy.

 The journey: Moment from The Motorcycle 

 Diaries

 A four-day film screening on Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara gets underway at Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre from June 14, at 6 pm.

 Che Lives, the package of four films presented by the Seagull Foundation for the Arts, starts with I Am Cuba. The Russian film made by Mikheil Kalatozishvili traces the seeds of revolution in Cuba.

 The Spanish film El Che, directed by Anibal Di Salvo and Maurice Dugowson, is a biography of Che ? from his growing-up days in Argentina to his trips to Latin America, his meeting with Fidel Castro and his heroic role in the Cuban revolution.

 Tracing Che, a Canadian film directed by Lawrence Ellman, is a documentary tracking a group of Cubans unsuccessfully trying to find the spot where Che lies buried. The film follows the intense and complicated relationship that the Argentine shared with his adopted country, Cuba.

 June 17 is the big day ? the screening of the Spanish film The Motorcycle Diaries, directed by Walter Salles. An adaptation of the journal that Che wrote as a 23-year-old, it begins as a road film chasing Che and his friend Alberto?s fun trip before graduation. The two travel across Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Peru in order to do their medical residency in a leper colony. It turns out to be a life-changing journey.

 Busy as ever: Moushumi Chatterjee

 There?s a bubbly restless teenager in Moushumi Chatterjee even in her mid-50s. As she sauntered in for the VCD launch of Neel Akasher Neeche, a film produced by her father-in-law Hemanta Mukhopadhyay and directed by Mrinal Sen, she was more chirpy than her two daughters, Payel and Megha. And as if to drive the point home further, she can be seen on screen playing cousin sister to younger daughter Megha in her debut film Bhalobashar Anek Naam.

 The film is extra special for her as it is directed by Tarun Majumder, the man who had unveiled Moushumi four decades ago as Balika Bodhu.

 With mother-in-law Bela Mukhopadhyay by her side, and her daughters not too far away, Moushumi gushed about the projects on hand ? a ?social film? with Ram Gopal Varma, and comedies by Meghna Gulzar and Basu Chatterjee.

 Comedy has been her forte ? from Ogo Bodhu Sundari and Angoor to Bollywood Hollywood ? but Moushumi prefers films that blend ?entertainment with a message?.

 ?Most of my roles these days have a comic shade but I look for some variation in them, otherwise all these seem so flat,? said she. ?One either goes by the role, the money being offered, how big the banner is or a known producer/director with whom you have worked several times.?

 In Basu Chatterjee?s untitled film, for which she has finished two shoot schedules, Moushumi plays a jealous and possessive wife to Satish Kaushik. ?Then, Meghna?s film will be a comedy about a couple,? she added.

 Moushumi is currently dubbing for Tanuja Chandra?s Sushmita Sen-starrer Zindaggi Rocks, where she juggles a double role. ?One of the characters is a widow and the other is single and a bit cracked like me,? she laughed, before adding: ?And Sushmita is excellent but I don?t think she takes acting too seriously!?

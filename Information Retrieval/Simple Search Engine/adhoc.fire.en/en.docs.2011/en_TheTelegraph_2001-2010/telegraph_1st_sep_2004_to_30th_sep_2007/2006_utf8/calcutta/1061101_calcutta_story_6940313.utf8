What: Winter Magic, a Hidesign fashion show. 

 Where: The Galaxy at The Park. 

 When: Monday evening. 

 On the ramp: Desire. Passion. Possession. And the unveiling of Hidesigns winter collection. Winter Magic aimed at weaving all this into a crisp 30-minute fashion show. 

 Delhi-based modern dancer Briar Chatterjee kickstarted the party as she romanced the evenings sole covet a Hidesign bag. Formal work-wear was showcased first. The sequence was almost purely black and white. 

 Lots of black leather jackets in classic cuts and styles were offset with a collection of formal workbags for men and women, very big and very bold. 

 The women flaunted a series of huge white bags, the new black of the season, as dubbed by Hidesign president Dilip Kapur.

 The second sequence revolved around travel. Formal jackets were replaced by trench styles and some shorter, sporty designs. 

 Chunky zippers, big flaps and great detailing were the highlights of the travel series lots of carry-bags and strolleys for men and some interesting silhouettes with shorter, grab handles for women. 

 The third sequence was casual work-wear. Brown, the comeback colour for men this year, was featured generously, with a dash of red for the ladies. Red has moved away from the party this season and is well-accepted at work. It may be not be as classic as black or white but it has a beauty of its own, said Dilip. 

 The next sequence showcased Salsa by Hidesign. More trendy, more hip, more fun, more sporty and more colour Salsa, unlike Hidesign, follows fashion forecasts, added Dilip. 

 The final collection flaunted Hidesigns party range. The colours were brighter blues and corals. 

 Winter Magic also marked the launch of The Parks new 5,000 sq ft banquet, The Galaxy. Modern decor, contrasted with old-world chandeliers, state-of-the-art facilities and an innovative snacks menu mark the new venue at The Park. 

 Ramp scorchers: Familiar faces like Aryan Vaid and Dipannita Sharma mingled with current hotties Sonalika Sahay and Amarpreet Wahi. Also seen on the ramp were regulars from the Calcutta circuit Neeraj Surana and Jessica. 

 Sip 'n' bite: A cocktail do preceded the fashion show. Free-flowing drinks apart, the list of snacks stretched long and elaborate. There was Philadelphia Cheese Bite, Carrot Ginger Orange Compote on Ciabatta Bread, Broccoli and Asparagus with English Cheddar, Glass Noodle Spring Role with Nam Chin Dip, Assorted Vegetable Tempura, Chicken Seekh Kebab, Fresh Bread Crumb and Crush Parmesan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 2000 crore for airport upgrade

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An extended second runway, a new third runway, a separate cargo complex and more aero-bridges are some of the highlights of a Rs 2,000-crore upgrade plan the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has chalked out for its Calcutta facility.

 AAI chairman K. Ramalingam and officiating regional director S.P.S. Bakshi presented the revamp blueprint to chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury at Writers? Building on Monday morning.

 In the first phase, the AAI intends spending Rs 225 crore by 2007. ?We have forwarded the phase-I proposal to the Public Investment Board for approval,? said an official.

 The state government has agreed to allot three acres to AAI for extending the second runway by 400 metres. ?Post-extension, the runway will be around 3,800 metres long and will be able to handle Boeing planes. The capacity will go up to handling 35 aircraft an hour,? said Chowdhury.

 Also figuring in the upgrade plan are a third runway, new buildings for both international and domestic terminals, aprons, six aero-bridges for the international and 10 for the domestic terminals and an elevated ramp connecting the airport from VIP Road (the ramp will lead to the first-floor departure section). 

 All arrivals will be handled on the ground floor. 

 ?The third runway, subject to the availability of 1,500 acres, is scheduled to be laid on the eastern side of the two runways and will fulfil our requirement for the next 50 years,? said an official.

 After the meeting at Writers? Buildings, the AAI team visited Behala Flying Club. The AAI has decided to pump in Rs 20 crore to upgrade the club into an airport for smaller aircraft.

 ?We plan to begin commercial operations from Behala within a year. Major players like Jet Airways and Deccan Airways have offered to operate from here,? said a senior AAI official.

 Army tips for police 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In the wake of the Maoist threat and terror strikes across the country, Calcutta Police commandos have travelled to north Bengal for training by the army. This is the first such exercise. 

 About 150 commandos are being trained at Pedong, near Kalimpong town. They will learn how to handle critical situations, said a senior IPS officer. According to him, the commandos will be provided tips on defusing explosives and landmines, rescuing hostages and countering terrorist activities. 

 They will also be taught to use weapons and sophisticated equipment.

 The rigorous training will continue for three months. The commandos will then be posted at Police Training School, said another officer. 

 The decision to send commandos for army training was taken by the chief minister at a recent meeting.

 In view of the Maoist attacks in the districts, we proposed the setting up of a specialised force to prevent such strikes in the city. The decision was taken after much deliberation, said the officer.

 We Ask You Answer

 Buddha as best man

 Today?s question: Which Calcuttan in your view will be the one to watch out for in 2006? More responses will be published next week

 Saikat Hazra,

 Uttarpara

 The most sought-after Calcuttan in 2006 will be Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ? not just because of the election, but due to his image and the work he is trying to do in Bengal. Even if the Left Front loses in the elections, Bhattacharjee will remain a prominent figure in state politics for a long time. 

 Santosh Chakravarty, 

 Unique Park

 The biggest celebrities in the city are Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Sourav Ganguly. And there?s no doubt that the former is doing better than the latter at the moment. If the Left Front returns to power, the chief minister will without doubt be the Calcuttan of the year. Besides, his success will benefit more people than Sourav?s.

S. maiti, 

 Behala

 Cricket being one of the most discussed topics in the country, Sourav Ganguly will be the Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006. Dada?s reinstatement in the national team, against all odds, will receive a lot of attention.

 Naren Sen, 

 Ramrajatola

 All eyes will be on the chief minister this year. With elections round the corner, Bhattacharjee is expected to increase his efforts at attracting foreign investment. This will lead to development of the state and hence his efforts must be appreciated.

B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 These days, even housewives are fanatical about cricket, but no player has captured Bengali hearts like Sourav has. He has won countless matches for the country, inspiring millions in the process. He has also groomed several young talents. I strongly feel that Sourav will be in the thick of action this year.

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake 

 The Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006 is the chief minister. During his tenure, the state has developed in many areas. He has successfully attracted foreign investment and is valiantly trying to better the law and order situation. I hope this process continues under Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s able guidance.

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur

 The Calcuttan of the year will be someone kind and courageous, one who does not shy away from taking an injured pedestrian to the nearest hospital. He will the one who protests injustice and fights dacoits, even if they are raiding his neighbour?s house.

 Sandhya Banerjee, 

 Salt Lake

 Since 2006 is an election year, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be the one to watch out for. Unlike his predecessor, the chief minister has played a major part in the industrial revival of the state and is expected to win another term.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 The erstwhile chief minister of Bengal Siddhartha Shankar Ray could be in the news this year. Age has slowed him down, but it has not affected his remarkable mind. He will no doubt try his best to oust the CPM from power this year.

 Udayan Banerjee,

 Bhadrakali

 Sourav Ganguly is the one to watch out for this year. The Pakistan series will be the litmus test for him. Failure to score runs could mean a premature end to his career. To come up triumphant, Sourav will not only have to face Shoaib?s bouncers on the field but Greg Chappell?s poisonous darts off it. I am confident, he would still emerge the man of the year.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

 The chief minister will be cynosure of all eyes in 2006. With the Assembly elections fast approaching, more and more foreign investors will be invited to the state and people are likely to witness the announcement of a slew of projects. Once Bhattacharjee is re-elected, he is likely to take tough decisions that would prove beneficial in the long run. 

Sutanwi Lahiri,

 Ballygunge 

 I suspect Sourav?s form will continue to occupy the newspaper headlines, but it is time we shift our focus to the underdogs ? the Surya Sekhar Gangulys, Soma Biswases and Bula Chowdhurys. After all, in a democracy, the ?Prince? and the commoners should be on a par.

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta, 

 Moira Street

 It is really difficult to single out one person as the Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006. Sourav Ganguly, Mamata Banerjee, Konkona Sensharma and Rituparno Ghosh will all play important roles during the year, but none more so than Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The chief minister has emerged as a statesman par excellence and will remain in the limelight in 2006. I hope he does not succumb to the temptation of cheap publicity and continues to put reforms above all else.

 Ankhi Mukherjee,

 Address not given

 Roopam Islam, the lead vocalist of the band Fossils, will be the one to watch in 2006. He has added a dimension to modern Bengali music and has become an icon of the youth. He will continue to make rapid musical progress this year as well.

 Arjun Chaudhuri,

 Mohesh Chaudhuri Lane

 After Sourav Ganguly and Deep Dasgupta, it seems Sourasish Lahiri will wear the Team India cap. The spinner has been bagging scores of wickets in the domestic circuit for a number of seasons on the trot. With Murali Karthik failing to show consistency in international matches and Piyush Chawla inexperienced even at the first-class level, Lahiri can be a good support to Kumble and Harbhajan. Besides, he can be effective in the shorter version of the game by wielding the long handle.

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 Ramrajatola

 Several Calcuttans are in the news at the moment, but chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be the one to watch out for in 2006. Bhattacharjee has been instrumental behind a facelift of the city. His concern for work culture in Calcutta, clean image and intellectual flair will keep him in the limelight.

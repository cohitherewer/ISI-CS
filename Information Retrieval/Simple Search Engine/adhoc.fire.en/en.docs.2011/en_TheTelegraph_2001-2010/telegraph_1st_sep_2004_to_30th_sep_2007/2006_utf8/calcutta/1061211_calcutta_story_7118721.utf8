 Shapes and strokes

 A young artist with a difference, Prasun Ghosh shows immense promise and potential in his handling of subjects, colours and mediums. Besides a wide variety of creations on canvas, he also makes ceramic sculptures. Unconventional in style and technique, his works have the unique ability to clearly articulate the awesome passion and power that inspired their own making. Sometimes, he appears to create images and forms with an almost brutish, physical force. Sharp or sensuous, erotic or delicate, crude or graceful, his art is nevertheless clothed by an aura of sensitivity, that unfailingly fascinates and captivates the viewers imagination. Original, and often, bold in his choice of theme and presentation, Ghosh manages, at the same time, to highlight concerns that have current or universal significance. The ongoing exhibition, showcasing some of his major works till date, is a reflection of the artists own aesthetic beliefs and convictions.

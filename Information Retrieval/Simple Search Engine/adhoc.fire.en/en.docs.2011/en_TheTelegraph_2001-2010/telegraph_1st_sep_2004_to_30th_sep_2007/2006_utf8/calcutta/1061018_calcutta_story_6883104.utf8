The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fraud by ex-cop in Lalbazar

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 A constable sacked in 1987 entered the Lalbazar police headquarters in an inspectors uniform on Monday afternoon and moved around freely for two hours before being apprehended. He was accompanied by a youth, whom he had promised a job in the force.

 Sukumar Biswas, who was dismissed on a charge of cheating, entered Lalbazar with Manoj Das around 12.45 pm. 

 Biswas introduced Das to an accounts department officer and then took him to the traffic department. 

 An officer intercepted the two after he found their movements suspicious.

 The uniform of an assistant sub-inspector of the Railway Protection Force was found in the bag Biswas, a resident of Bankura, was carrying. Since he used to travel to Calcutta frequently, he saved the fare by donning the sub-inspectors uniform on the train. After reaching the city, he used to change into the inspectors uniform, explained an officer.

 We have arrested Biswas for impersonation, under Section 419 of Indian Penal Code, Premabrata Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Hare Street police station, told Metro on Tuesday. A probe revealed that the ex-constable had been involved in impersonation and fraud since his dismissal.

 Das told police: Last week, Biswas had asked for Rs 40,000 to get me a constables job. He brought me to Lalbazar to flaunt his connections.

 Fusion mall eyes new pasture

 - Rajarhat debut for branded amp; generic retail

 Replicating success: An artist?s impression of City Centre, New Town

 Marrying brand binge with bazaar buzz, cheek by jowl, emanating the zing and feel of a bustling downtown, with vibrant designs and a rich array of textures to entice the senses, and letting a butterfly sit on you?

 That?s what City Centre, New Town promises to be. Set to be ready and running by the middle of next year, the sequel to the Charles Correa-signature City Centre Salt Lake will carry forward the fused-format concept, which works on the primary premise of blending branded and generic retail.

 Designed by Mumbai-based architect Kapil Bhalla, the 550,000-sq ft development in New Town Rajarhat, will have a 425,000-sq ft retail-and-entertainment zone, 50 per cent larger than in City Centre Salt Lake. The foundation stone will be laid by former chief minister Jyoti Basu on Thursday, in the presence of Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath and state housing minister Gautam Deb.

 ?We have always felt the need to fuse the great Indian bazaar concept, which allows individual entrepreneurs to sell a wide range of products to a very wide swathe of society, with that of a classic western mall, that caters essentially to segmented customers. The New Town property will follow the same principle,? says Harsh Neotia.

 The managing director of Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Limited, the company developing the Rs 150-crore project, admits that the learning curve from the Salt Lake project has been incorporated into the New Town sequel. ?The picture is much clearer now and its a more mature step ahead.?

 Unlike the defined geometry, which repeats itself over and over again in the Correa design, the Rajarhat retail rendezvous has a more pluralistic architectural vocabulary. ?The New Town project is not just an enchanting picture, but also has a different picture frame where things are not repeated ad nauseam,? says Neotia.

 How?s the homogeneity in massing broken to deliver a spry town square? Architect Bhalla feels there?s no typical formula to demystify the success of a mall. ?Here, we have tried to be people-centric and partial to the senses, with a goal to boost retail through cognitive mapping that helps the consumer chart out a route and course of action very easily,? he explains.

 Bhalla has avoided dead-ends and turnarounds to create a continuous flow pattern and created a ?wow space? in the form of a butterfly park that could become the mall magnet. ?No downtown zone is complete without a museum and the butterfly park, with its 40 different species of butterflies, is like a natural history museum, an idea replicated from similar concepts in the US, England and Singapore,? the architect says.

 The configuration of City Centre New Town will be less complicated than its Salt Lake ancestor, but not shorn of surprises, promises Neotia. ?The time taken to figure out this property will surely be lesser, but we haven?t compromised on the continuous change of vistas that allures visitors and draws them back. While volumes must be driven by shopping, the aspiration is to entertain as well,? he observes.

 Besides the four-screen cineplex by 89 Cinemas seating 1,250, fine dining and banquets, the eat-shop-hangout concourse will also house a 150-room airport hotel, ?three or four-star?, on the fourth to eighth levels.

 Adequate car parking facility is another area the Rajarhat destination has stressed on. The company has acquired a one-acre plot from Hidco next to the development for a captive car-park building, housing 550 to 600 cars. Together with the double-basement and street-side parking slots, City Centre New Town will accommodate more than 1,500 cars.

 ?This is in synch with our commitment to reduce surface vehicular congestion. Having also designed Ujjwala and studied the proposed urban scape of Rajarhat extensively, I have fortunately picked up a fair bit of inputs on the emerging township. This has helped in shaping City Centre New Town better,? says Bhalla.

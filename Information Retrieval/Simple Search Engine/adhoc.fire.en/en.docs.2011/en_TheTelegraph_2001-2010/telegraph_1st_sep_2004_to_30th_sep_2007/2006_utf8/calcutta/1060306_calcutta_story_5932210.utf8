The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Three bags full

 Bengal, bolly amp; beyond: Dia Mirza

 She hasn?t had a solo hit in years but Dia Mirza is far from done. She may be dancing in small-screen shows like Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge but the former Miss India Asia Pacific is getting some big offers on the big screen ? in Bengal, Bollywood and beyond.

 Half-Bengali, Dia has indeed signed Raja Mukherjee?s ? better known as Rani Mukherjee?s brother ? directorial debut Bidhaatar Lekha co-starring Jeet and Priyanshu Chatterjee. 

 ?It?s all for my mother, kind of a return to roots for me,? smiles Dia. ?It?s quite a female-centric love story. It is a very commercial film. So it is not going to win me major awards or anything. But yes, the audiences in the region will definitely know me much more.?

 Before Dia goes off to Darjeeling in August to shoot for Bidhaatar Lekha, she has many interesting Hindi films to look forward to. First up is photographer Subi Samuel?s maiden production Alag, opposite Akshay Kapoor of Popcorn Khao! Mast Ho Jao fame. ?It is directed by Ashu Trikha, with whom I have earlier worked in Deewanapan,? reveals Dia.

 The petite actress, who?s made many a trip to Calcutta recently for everything from film promotion to product launch to beauty clinic inauguration, has also been added to the ensemble cast of Farhan Akhtar?s Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd being directed by Reema Kagti. ?Although it has many actors, everyone has a well-defined and beautifully written role,? observes Dia.

 Then there are two more Bollywood films featuring her in the lead. ?Neeraj Vohra is directing one and there?s this new film with Ananth Mahadevan opposite Fardeen Khan,? says Dia.

 But the real clincher is an Indo-Chinese co-production that the actress has signed recently. ?I can?t reveal much about it except the fact that it is being made by a Chinese crew,? she smiles. ?Half of the film will be shot in Hong Kong while the other half will be canned in India. Apart from me, Arshad Warsi will be the other Indian actor in the main cast.?

 The real surprise, though, is Dia?s tryst with Munnabhai Meets Mahatma Gandhi. ?Yes, I have a very special role in Munnabhai 2 which I can?t talk about. Yes, Vidya Balan is very much there in the movie but I have a lovely role, too,? she says. If this cameo works as beautifully as it did in Parineeta, then Dia is sure to bag many such special roles.

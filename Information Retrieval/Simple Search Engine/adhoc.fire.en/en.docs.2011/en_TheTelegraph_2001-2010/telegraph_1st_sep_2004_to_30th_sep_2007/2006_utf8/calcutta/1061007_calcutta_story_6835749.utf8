 Deluge shadow on winter prices 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 If the spiralling prices of fruits and vegetables have already burnt a hole in your pocket, brace yourself for more in the run-up to winter.

 On Friday, officials declared that the crop of winter vegetables has been severely hit by the pre-Puja deluge.

 Of the total agricultural loss due to the rains, were most worried about vegetables. Over 50 per cent of Calcuttas supplies have been destroyed. The loss of paddy will not be felt immediately, but a vegetable crisis is imminent, D. Konar, director (agriculture), warned on Friday.

 Konar will leave for Behrampore on Saturday to assess the damage in Murshidabad, the principal supplier of vegetables to the city.

 Consumers have started feeling the pinch already.

 With Kali puja and the marriage season coming up, the rain has burnt a big hole in our pockets. Were having to procure vegetables, flowers and fish at prohibitive prices, said Arup Nag, general secretary, Decorators Samanyaya Samiti, on Lakshmi puja.

 While brinjals have jumped from Rs 20 to Rs 40 a kg, potato prices have shot up from Rs 7 to Rs 11.

 Even flower prices have skyrocketed, though theyre likely to stabilise after Kali puja. Vegetable prices, however, will not normalise till December-January, felt Nag. 

 Supplies of fish, too, have been hit. We are coughing up Rs 70 to Rs 80 more for every kg of bekti, while the price of rohu has gone up from Rs 70 to Rs 90, he rued.

 The damage has been most severe in North and South 24-Parganas, Burdwan (Kalna and Katwa), Murshidabad (Beldanga) and parts of Howrah and Nadia. There are reports of waterlogging even now in Udaynarayanpur (Howrah), Nakashipara (Nadia) and Beldanga, Konar said.

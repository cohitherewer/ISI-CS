 Expectations from the first leg of Nandikars 23rd National Theatre Festival buzzed around how two master directors, Chetan Datar and the late BV Karanth, had treated two masterworks.

 Datar edited Mahesh Elkunchwars celebrated Marathi Wada trilogy (1985-94) down to two hours for Awishkar, Mumbai, by placing the present generation of the Deshpande family as a frame that flashes back to the events in the first two plays and returns to now. The ensemble acting is impeccable, but the compression doesnt work because Elkunchwar wrote about feelings, not incidents. To condense inevitably prioritises the plot and sacrifices characterisation, which requires extended time to develop fully.

 In 1993, Karanth had revived the operatic Gokula Nirgamana (1945) by P.T. Narasimhachar for Benaka, Bangalore. It became a landmark production that resurrected the old-guard classicist Kannada author from critical neglect and located contemporary nuances in the verse-drama Krishna leaving Gokula for Kamsas kingdom alluded to youth departing from India for foreign climes, or soldiers going off to war never to return. 

 But viewing it posthumously brought out none of these interpretations until the very end, when a simple village boy picks up and plays Krishnas flute, symbolising that he lives within us. Karanths full and eclectic musical score, however, evoked rasas superbly. 

 And Indrajit by Kalashray, Mumbai, was a disappointment as Jayadev Hattangady handled the text (Pratibha Agrawals Hindi translation of Badal Sircars classic) with excessive veneration.

 Teater Pero flew down from Stockholm after two years with its brand of childrens theatre in English, directed by Peter Engkvist. Orjan retold the fable of an acrophobic eagle taught to fly by a wren; The Man, the Lady and Something in the Belly related a parable about accepting difference. The kids who should have watched were missing. The adults greeted the performers enthusiastically for their versatile singing, acrobatic and mime talents.

 The National School of Dramas new theatre-in-education company, Sanskar Rang Toli, presented a quartet of Premchand stories in Hindi that carried significant messages for children. 

 The famous Bade Bhai Sab and Idgah click with their human warmth, whereas Lottery and Chori use too much time and loud performances by grownups behaving childish to convey their moralistic value education.

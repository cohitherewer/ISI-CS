 Lessons from a nature trail

 At times, we all want to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. To observe and be a part of the life of the tribals, 65 youngsters from Art of Living set off for Ghatsila, in Singhbhum district of Jharkhand. Our first destination was Haludbani, where we visited a tribal school. 

 The sense of hygiene among the tribal children, their dedication to maintaining their natural surroundings and their commitment to learning left us amazed. We realised that what comes easy to us comes at a heavy price for them. Many of the students walk miles on kuchha roads, have no power or drinking water at home, nor do they have access to healthcare facilities. 

 This, despite the administration trying to help them. Sheds and tubewells have been set up at the school. Besides formal education, the children are taught hygiene, moral values, yoga, meditation, folk music and dance.

 We then visited a cattle shed where we saw vermicompost being made into natural fertilisers. We observed that organic farming had to a certain extent restored the villagers confidence in the age-old methods of agriculture.

 Our final destination was Hinduljori, where we dropped by at another school. The friendly tribal children there even taught us archery. A modest game of football showcased their excellent footwork on the field.

 What struck us most was that the students had developed their skills even under adverse conditions. To help them later in life, the school also has vocational courses in stitching, embroidery, knitting, crafts and more.

Talent hunt

 The National Geographic Channel this week launched Nat Geo Junior Hunt, a new national quest to find Indias superkid a Nat Geo Junior who is curious, adventurous, articulate, energetic and smart. The hunt will cover 380 schools in 10 cities across the country. Over three-and-a-half lakh children aged between 10 and 14 years will be participating in the contest.

 After a thorough selection process based on aptitude and logical reasoning, designed by iDiscoveri Education, 20 city finalists will be sent to Youreka, iDiscoveris outdoor division. They will then take up a variety of individual and group challenges, including games, puzzles, physical activities and thinking out of the box. Joy Bhattacharjya, senior vice-president of programming at National Geographic Channel India, said: Nat Geos endeavour is to stimulate the intellect of our young audiences and make them Think Again by encouraging them to learn more about the world that they live in. 

 Ashish Rajpul, co-founder and CEO of iDiscoveri Education, echoed: Intelligence today has expanded to include a lot more than just academic achievement. We firmly believe that the Nat Geo Junior Hunt reflects this aspiration.

 After the gauntlet at Youreka, just four of the 20 city finalists will be chosen to take part in the national finals. But before the ultimate showdown, these youngsters will be trained to host their own show called Nat Geo Junior. The winner will get a Nat Geo Junior Hunt Fund, which will contribute towards his/her education. The youngster will also be given a three-month slot for hosting Nat Geo Junior shows, as well as plenty of prizes from partners of the event such as ICICI Pru Smart Kid and Lenovo.

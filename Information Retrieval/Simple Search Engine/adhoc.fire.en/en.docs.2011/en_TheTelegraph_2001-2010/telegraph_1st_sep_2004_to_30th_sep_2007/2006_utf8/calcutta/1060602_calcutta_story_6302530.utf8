The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Steve Waugh

 You have an easy-going, low-key approach to relationships. You are pretty good at getting things done your own way. You love listening to and helping others. Because of your natural charm, you stand out in contrast to those who dramatically struggle for centre stage. Communication is your biggest strength. You like work where you can learn and grow.

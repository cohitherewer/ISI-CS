 Brows raised over green board role

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The contradictory roles played by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board with regard to the South City project have come into sharp focus, following the board?s recent directive to the developers.

 In a February 20 order, the board?s senior law officer Biswajit Mukherjee barred the project from handing over flats till allegations of filling up ponds in and around the Prince Anwar Shah Road construction site were addressed.

 Environmentalists, however, point out that the board?s role in South City has been far from transparent in the past couple of years. ?Under which law did the board allow the developers to fill up 1.31 acres of waterbody?? asked green activist Subhas Dutta. 

 Alleging ?a scam? involving the board officials, environmentalist Mohit Roy of Basundhara Foundation said: ?How could the board allow them to fill up a waterbody against a paltry bank guarantee of Rs 20 lakh, when the cost of creating an alternative one would be at least Rs 2 crore??

 According to sources, it was the board?s chief engineer who had given written permission to fill up the 1.31-acre waterbody against the bank guarantee. The board has also been accused of failing to react when complaints were initially lodged against the project.

 ?Whenever we complained, a hearing was called, but nothing concrete emerged,? said a member of the NGO Golf Link, which has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) against the project.

 Another allegation against the board is that it didnt stress the need for central clearance after issuing the ?no-objection certificate? to the mammoth development.

 ?How could the developers complete construction up to the plinth level within July 7, 2004 (the cut-off date for requiring central nod), if we consider that they broke ground in March 2004 as they claim?? demanded Trinamul leader Javed Khan, who has also filed a PIL against South City.

 After receiving the initial sanction in end-2003, the developers applied for a revised plan, which was only sanctioned in 2005.

 The civic body has also swung into action after receiving a complaint from the governor?s office on the filling up of Bikramgarh Jheel.

 ?We have directed the project authorities to stop work in or on the waterbody and a detailed probe is on,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

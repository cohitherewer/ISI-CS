 In keeping with its tradition of celebrating Holi, this year, ITC Sangeet Research Academy hosts Saras Vasante, an evening of Indian classical music. It will begin with Basant Ritu Ke Bandishen, a performance by SRA scholars, singing songs of the season. This will be followed by Pakhawaj Ke Paramparik Rachnaye, a pakhawaj recital by Dr Raj Khushiram. Presenting rhythmic compositions that have survived the test of time, it traces a rich musical heritage and, at the same time, identifies certain aspects of classical music that have evolved with time to be adapted to contemporary strains. The concert will conclude with Malwa Ke Vasant Geet, a vocal recital by the mother-daughter duo, Vasundhara Komkali and Kalapini Komkali (picture above). Together they will recreate the beauty of Malwa in spring. Accompanists: Sanjay Deshpande and Sandip Ray Chaudhuri (tabla), Bhuvandesh Komkali (vocal), Chaitanya Kunte, Hiranmay Mitra and Rupashree Bhattacharya (harmonium) and Rajendra Durkar (dholak).

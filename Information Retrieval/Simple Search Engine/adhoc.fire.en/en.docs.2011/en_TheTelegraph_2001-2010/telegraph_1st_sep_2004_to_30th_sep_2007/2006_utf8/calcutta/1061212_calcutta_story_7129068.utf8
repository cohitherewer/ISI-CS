 Playing it cool: Rimii 

 Sen

 After mouthing more Bengali than Bipasha Basus Shonali Bose in her five-minute cameo in Dhoom 2, Rimii Sen is busy shooting for Milan Luthria-directed UTVs Hat Trick. Having completing the shooting schedule in London, she is currently shooting for the film in Mumbai with Kunal Kapoor. 

 During the schedule last week, Rimii and Kunal had a long day shooting an intimate scene. Says Milan Luthria: We were stuck with a scene till 2 in the morning. In the particular shot, Rimii is trying to seduce Kunal with an ice cube and all Kunal has to do is put the ice cube inside her top.

 But poor Kunal, the shy guy that he is, got cold feet. He just could not take the ice cube and put it in Rimiis dress.The repeated takes continued for over an hour. Everybody in the Hat Trick unit was dead tired and just wanted the shot to be okayed somehow. 

 Finally Luthria changed things around a bit. The ice cube was put inside a big tumbler and Kunal was asked to put the ice straight from the tumbler inside Rimiis top. After another round of harried efforts, Kunal got the shot right.

 Beyond boundaries: Mohit Suri, Mahesh 

 Bhatt and Gulshan Grover at the Kara Film Festival in 

 Pakistan 

 The Bhatt camp got a rousing reception at the sixth Kara Film Festival in Karachi. Mahesh Bhatt along with Gulshan Grover and Mohit Suri (director of Kalyug and Woh Lamhe) were pleasantly surprised to see hundreds of people present at the airport to welcome them in the middle of the night. 

 Bhatt is the Indian ambassador of the Kara Film Festival and has been to all the previous five editions of the festival. But not just him, all his proteges got a warm reception in Pakistan. Present at the opening night of the festival at Mohatta Palace was the governor of Sindh apart from the top film and music celebrities of Pakistan who personally received Bhatt, Tanuja Chandra, Mohit and Grover.

 And then the governor invited Bhatt and Grover to the Governors Palace for tea. Next day at the Palace, while tea was being served, Indian film songs were playing in the background. To round it all off, the governor presented a carpet and silver bowls to his Indian guests.

 Film-maker Basu Chatterjee is in town and he has just bought the rights of Manoj Mitras celebrated play Shajano Bagan. It is my favourite play, Chatterjee told Metro on Saturday. Chatterjee, who has already finalised the script, said that the film would be on the floors in two months. 

 It will be a full length Hindi feature film said Chatterjee and may be called Bancharam Ke Bagicha. Casting has not been finalised but topping Chatterjees wish list are Pankaj Kapoor and Nana Patekar. 

 Manoj Mitra was elated by the development. Tapan Sinha had made Sajano Bagan into a Bengali film in which I played Bancharam and another Hindi film Yeh Hai Zindagi was based on it with Pran playing the main role, he said. 

 Asked why he had felt the need of doing a film based on the play when there was one in Hindi already, Basu Chatterjee said They had turned the script upside down. My film will be different. And had he made any changes? Why should I? The script is perfect as it is, said Chatterjee.

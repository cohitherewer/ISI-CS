 The lure of Rs 40 lakh proved too strong to resist for 21-year-old Amrish Mauriya, who escaped with his employer?s bag containing the amount in cash. Only to be brought to book by the long arm of the law a week later.

 Amrish, who used to earn a salary of Rs 2,500 per month, and his associate Suraj Garai were arrested near the Sealdah flyover on Monday afternoon. Raids on their houses in Liluah yielded Rs 39.35 lakh.

 ?We found four cellphones in their possession,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division). ?Besides, we have came to know that Amrish deposited Rs 38,000 in a bank account. The duo had only spent Rs 27,000 of the stolen money.?

 According to police, paint merchant Pankaj Agarwal had asked his employees ?Amrish and Sushanta Bhatt ? to deposit Rs 40 lakh at HDFC?s BBD Bag branch.

 ?After coming out of Agarwal?s office on NS Road, Amrish asked Sushanta to fetch the cellphone that he had left in the office,? said an officer.

 By the time Sushanta returned with the cellphone, Amrish had disappeared. Sushanta immediately informed Agarwal, who lodged a complaint with Hare Street police station.

 ?We raided Amrish and his accomplice?s residences in Liluah soon after. But they were not there,? said Premabrata Majumdar, officer-in-charge.

 ?We then contacted the service provider of Amrish?s cellphone and started examining the call records,? continued Majumdar.

 The phone was traced to the Kanpur-Mughalsarai-Jaunpur area. ?Tracking the calls, we came to know that the two had come back to Calcutta two days ago. The officers then started shadowing Amrish,? revealed Kumar. ?Police zeroed in on Amrish and Suraj when they met in Sealdah to chalk out a plan to flee with the money.?

 ?During interrogation, Amrish confessed to the crime and led police to an abandoned house in Liluah, where we found a portion of the money. The rest of the money was kept at Suraj?s house in the locality. Amrish said he wanted to start a business with the money,? Kumar added.

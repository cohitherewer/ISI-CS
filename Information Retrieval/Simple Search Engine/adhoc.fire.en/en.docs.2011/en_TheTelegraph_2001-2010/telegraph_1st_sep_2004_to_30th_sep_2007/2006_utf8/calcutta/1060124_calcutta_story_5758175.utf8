 Finance firm boys held for suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Threats by a private financial company to repay a loan has forced a trader to end his life.

 Four representatives of the company, who met Shyamal Roy on Sunday morning, hours before he killed himself, have been arrested.

 Roy, in his late 40s, was desperate to expand his business of supplying building material in his locality, Thakurpukur?s Pragati Pally.

 The boom in the real estate business in the area, coupled with the rising demand for building material, led him to believe that a few thousands more would make all the difference to his prospects. 

 Unable to collect the money from any other source, he fell back on the private company for a loan of Rs 22,000.

 When the company readily sanctioned the amount, the father of two sons felt it was only a matter of time before he reached his goal. 

 But the euphoria was short-lived. As the company started pressing him to pay back the money, Roy slid into depression and became a psychic patient. Unable to bear the pressure any more, he killed himself on Sunday.

 ?The victim?s son has lodged a specific complaint against the four. The body has been sent for post-mortem,? said a senior officer of Thakurpukur police station.

 On Sunday morning, as Roy was preparing to open his shop, the four youths, riding two motorcycles, entered the locality searching for Roy. 

 On reaching his house, they asked Roy?s elder son Soumen, in his twenties, to call his father. 

 ?Soon after Roy arrived, there was a heated exchange between him and the youths. They were talking about a loan, but we could not hear the details as we were at a distance,? said a neighbour.

 According to police, the four youths asked Roy to keep the interest amount ready by noon, when they would come again. Roy sought some more time, but they refused. 

 The youths returned in the afternoon. They called Soumen and asked him to fetch his father. But as he entered the house, he saw his father hanging from the ceiling. 

 He immediately stepped out and called the neighbours. After learning about his father?s fate from him, the neighbours grabbed the four youths and beat them up. 

 Soumen then went to Thakurpukur police station and lodged a complaint. The four have been remanded in judicial custody till January 27.

 Employees and visitors at Writers Buildings will be spared the secretariats drinking water crisis from the summer of 2007, when an 80,000-litre underground reservoir will be commissioned.

 A project of the public works department (PWD), Writerss sixth underground reservoir will be constructed between blocks IV and V.

 More than 10,000 people visit Writers every day. They face a problem fetching drinking water, especially in summer. We hope the problem will be solved once the new reservoir is operational, said PWD chief engineer Swapan Kumar Das.

 Along with increasing the storage capacity, the Writers authorities have decided to switch from underground water to surface water. This is the first time the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will supply filtered surface water to the secretariat, for which a network of pipelines has been laid.

 We are now dependent entirely on deep tubewells for drinking water. But most people do not like the taste of the water because of its high iron content, Das added. 

 The PWD is spending Rs 5 lakh to construct the underground reservoir and Rs 2 lakh to lay the pipes. Apart from serving drinking water, the reservoir will be of great help in case of a fire. 

 A senior PWD officer said that though Writers has a pumping network in Laldighi dedicated to fire-fighting operations, an underground reservoir on the premises is a must.

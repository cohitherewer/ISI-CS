The civic authorities have come up with a plan to beautify small, unutilised public plots across the city by involving local residents or clubs and business establishments.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will soon invite letters of interest from the public under the ?Nurture Your Own City Space? programme, disclosed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 People will be allowed to set up gardens and fountains and instal aquariums on the plots. If there is enough space, a plot can be converted into a children?s park.

 If a club or a business house looking after a plot so wishes, it can erect a fence around the garden. But the fence should not be tall enough to block the sight of viewers, the municipal commissioner pointed out.

 The club or the business house will be allowed to erect a small board displaying its name as the undertaker of the plot.

 The undertaker will have to sign an agreement with the civic body, stating that it will paint the fencing ever year, clean the space at least once a week and water the plants regularly.

 ?The beautification drive aims at checking the Calcuttans? habit of dumping trash indiscriminately on vacant plots or even roads and lanes,? said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 According to the civic conservancy department, there are around 10,000 empty, roadside public plots across the city.

 Chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar said that despite ?regular door-to-door collection of household trash? by the conservancy department, around 30 per cent of the households, mostly living in apartments, do not hand over garbage to the civic staff. They either throw polythene trash bags on the road at night or dump them in a nearby empty plot.

 Illegal dumping of trash is most rampant in the Burrabazar, Chitpur, Sealdah, Kalabagan, Bhowanipore, Fern Road, Jadavpur, Tiljala, Beleghata, Kasba, Natore Park, Picnic Garden Road, Rifle Range Road, Broad Street and the Bondel Road areas.

 On the side of every road or street, there are at least five to10 illegal dumps.

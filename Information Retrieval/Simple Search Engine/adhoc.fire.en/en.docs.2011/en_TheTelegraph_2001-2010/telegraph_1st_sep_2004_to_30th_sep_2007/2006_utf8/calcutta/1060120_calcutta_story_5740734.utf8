The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 After the recce, the big bite

 - Burger giant buoyed by positive signals, pushes forward debut date

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Big Mac is firming up arrival plans

 Big Mac is back ? to decide when and where to start from, that is. If the last Calcutta visit by a McDonald?s team in the third week of December was ?just a recce?, the one in the third week of January meant serious business.

 The team started its trek of the city under CEO (India) Vikram Bakshi, who came down following positive feedback from his recce team. First up on the route radar of the fast food giant were two prominent eateries on Park Street and Elgin Road.

 The team clicked photographs of the properties and sought other details about the addresses and their adjoining area ? total area of the property, floating footfalls in the area, commercial ventures in the adjoining area and the traffic scenario during rush hour and on weekends.

 On Thursday, the Big Mac brigade went (under-construction) mall-hopping, from South City to Forum II to Avani Galleria. Having trekked from Prince Anwar Shah Road to Park Street, CEO Bakshi, said sources, was ?very impressed with the way Calcutta has changed? and dubbed the Salt Lake area ?as the perfect IT destination?.

 And in what would be music to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ears, the McDonald?s men felt Calcutta scored over Mumbai in its traffic system and in the quality of its upcoming malls.

 ?McDonald?s is now very keen to set up business in Calcutta. They have realised that this is the best time to dig into the Calcutta food pie, as the other food chains are doing particularly well in the city. Just an example of their aggression is that they have brought forward their plans of a Calcutta launch from end-2006 to mid-2006,? said a source.

 McDonald?s is said to be eyeing 12 to 15 outlets in Calcutta, including standalones, ?drive-thrus? and kiosks. And the big plans of Big Mac have sparked off quite a scramble among entrepreneurs and restaurateurs to jump on to the burger bandwagon. ?All the fast food brands, led by KFC, that have dropped anchor in Calcutta in the past year, are doing phenomenally well. And every mall would like to have a McDonald?s,? a restaurateur told Metro.

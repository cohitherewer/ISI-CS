 Pick me up, served sunny side up

 Flirt with aqua splashes, give your room a pastel makeover and update your wardrobe with citrus hues...Shradha Agarwal lists the spring must dos

 Spring-summer 2006 ? like any other season, this one too can get pretty staid. The horrible heat and the sultry sweat; add to that mundane daily chores and life seems far from exciting.

 At times like these, all you need is a bagful of instant pick me ups. Whats the best boosters for you? 

 Some may enjoy flirting with aqua ? sipping, soaking, splashing or exercising ? while a therapeutic session of spring cleaning works for others.

 Pick me ups, you see, can be as diverse as Dravid and Dhoni. 

 But heres the GoodLife guide to breeze through this season, in style. Some, you see, are bound to click.

 Home hues

 Summers always make us spend those extra hours chilling at home. Lolling in front of the telly with drawn curtains and an icy cool beverage adding up to bliss.

 Picture perfect, you think? Well, think again, because heres how you can further raise the chill factor, just by adding a few fresh elements in your home decor. 

 Experience an instant pick me up when you are out shopping for them and then enjoy the lasting effect once you have given pride of place to these beauties at home.

 Refresh your home interiors with a melange of flowers. White roses, tuberoses, canary sunflowers or pink gerberas ? whatever pretty petals you prefer ? just go all out to create floral magic. Float the petals in a clear bowl of water, arrange them all in a vase or just slip in a single stem into a slender piece. Flowers do magic directing summer breeze into your haven.

 Make your bed summer-friendly by picking up a few new sets of bed linen, all in cotton of course. Plain pastel shades and happy prints in happier colours; just go natural this season and pack the satins away for later.

 Gift yourself a new air-conditioner or cooler or at least service the old one. The autumn-winter weeks inevitably spell dust and grime, so remember to get your set checked by maintenance. Wash the filter and also clean the exteriors with an effective agent.

 Ship shape

 Those days of being tucked inside the duvet, buried under multiple layers of clothes and munching away to glory are gone. Its time now to shrug them off and shine bright.

 Heres some diet advice for the lazy ones and some activity advice for the not so lazy. 

 Nutritionist Dr Shikha Sharma advises cutting out calorie-dense dry fruits, a hangover from the Diwali days.

 Summer is the time to relish cool and crunchy salads. These summer months can also get a little dry, so dont forget to add a dash of olive oil in your salad, suggests Shikha. 

 Lighter food and small, frequent meals? the diet funda seems quite sorted out, but are the results showing? Those stuck at the same measure on the weighing scale should try a once-a-week detox, suggests Shikha.

 Limit yourself to only sprouts, fruits, vegetable juices and soups, one day of the week. It is an amazing way to feel good, summer style, smiles the good doctor. 

 Swimming apart, fitness expert Preetom Mukherjee-Roy ticks aqua aerobics as a fun routine this summer.

 Since you sweat less, you also manage working out more in the water, that too without exerting any pressure on your joints. 

 Another pointer, says Preetom, is never to work out between 10 am and 4 pm during the summers and to frequent climate control gyms only.

 Dying to show off your sleeveless summer wardrobe but wondering what to do with your arms? 

 Preetom suggests single dumb-bell curls for the biceps, tricep kickbacks, bicep cable pull-downs and tricep cable press-downs. You can also incorporate additional sets of bicep pull-ups and tricep dips to get those perfect, toned arms, he adds.

 Style check

 Summer also happens to be the perfect time to up your haute meter. Run a quick style check on yourself, ascertain the missing links and then splurge on them one by one.

 Here are some things that you might need an update on. Browse through the air-conditioned malls while you gather your summer special wardrobe wows.

 ?A sunscreen is an absolute must to stave off the summer months. So buy yourself a good one and chuck the umbrella.

 Make-up expert Abhijit Chanda suggests the use of a sunscreen base, the perfect two-in-one solution. In any case, a light make-up base pretty much works as a sunscreen, says Abhijit.

 A super cool pair of shades. Blue, pink or lemon, aviators or wrap arounds, a funky pair of sunglasses is the killer accessory this season. 

 Flaunt well-groomed feet in strappy sandals. Indulge in a spa pedicure and paint your toenails in your favourite hue. Complete the pampering exercise by buying one of those sexy, flat sandals.

 Let yourself into the world of linen. Nothing better to beat the heat than natural fibres and soothing colours. Trousers, kurtis, even salwar kurtas? linen look great in every design. Team them with light cotton pants. 

 Indulge in a new fresh fragrance. Choose from aqua, citrus-based or a light floral, but a scintillating scent is a must. And yes, remember to stock up on the deo as well.

 Splash your wardrobe with cool hues ? aquamarine blue, citrus, lime green, coral et al. Peach and powder blue is going to be huge this season, feels designer Agnimitra Paul. 

 She suggests brightening up pastels with happier tones in accessories.

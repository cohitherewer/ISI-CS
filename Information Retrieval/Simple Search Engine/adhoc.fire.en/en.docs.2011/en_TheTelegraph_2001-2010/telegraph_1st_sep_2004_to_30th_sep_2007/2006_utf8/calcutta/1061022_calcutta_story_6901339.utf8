The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A toast to the true spirit

 The Model Puja team 

 receives its award.

 When we started out we had little expectations. This was a novel concept, encouraging responsibility alongside the enjoyment. But as we proceeded from year to year, the numbers increased and our confidence grew... faced with a full house at Vidya Mandir on Friday evening, Prabir Bose of CESC could not help but be nostalgic.

 The concept has now grown into a movement called CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, supported by Calcutta Police, West Bengal Fire Services, CMC, PCB and Concern for Calcutta and drawing response from over 400 Puja organisers and participation from 175 chosen from among them.

 The Durga puja people were all there at the awards function on Kali puja-eve. What distinguished this set of organisers from the rest was a caring conscience. That is what merited the applause every time representatives of a puja went up on stage from Kankurgachhi to Shahidnagar, Salt Lake to Howrah 

 More and more hands joined in the clapping as the star status of the award grew, and the cheer reached a crescendo when the Model Puja team Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha walked up to the beat of a couple of dhaks. Our responsibility has increased, admitted the club members who had taken home a Three Star status the year before.

 Another strikingly improved showing was that of Mudiali Club, jumping from Two to Five Star this year. The puja had used solar lights to take load off the generator. It did come handy. There was a power cut for about 10 minutes on Saptami evening, beamed an organiser.

 Striking gold on debut were Naktala Udayan Sangha and Behala Nutan Dal. While the first, bagging a Three Star, owed it to fire safety and electric arrangements, the Behala puja pointed to the True Spirit Four Star shining bright among the 19 awards it had won for Ma Khepir Chatal. We will plant and maintain the 30 ferns at our pandal tended to over three months on James Long Sarani, was their green vow.

 Putiary Club, which won a Four Star, had planned ahead for the Rs 15,000 coming its way: We will help out Ashar Alo, a school for the challenged in Bankura from where our pandal-maker comes. 

 Others were already planning a more spirited showing next year. Suruchi Sangha, the years biggest crowd-puller, had installed eight cameras to keep an eye on the crowd as well as the power points, while a software checked the electric lines for overloading. We will try and do better, they pledged.

 But is all the effort made with an an eye on award and applause? Not at all, came the chorus of protests. Many of the puja organisers claimed they would keep showing the same care towards visitors even if there was no such award to look forward to.

 Lunch for the underprivileged on Ashtami is a tradition in our locality, said a member of Mudiali Club. What we do is for the people, not judges, stressed a representative of Manicktala Chaltabagan Lohapatty Durgapuja Committee, which will be donating its entire prize money of Rs 15,000 to neighbour 32-year-old Rashmi Gupta for a kidney transplant.

 Social commitment during Puja within the confines of the housing complexes was also saluted. Taking a DVD home were the residents of Victoria Greens, Garia. It is great the way The Telegraph Hand in Hand initiative involves families in the housing co-operatives. There is more enthusiasm in everything from dhunuchi naach to drawing contests. This encouragement improves the quality of participation, smiled one.

 The apartment residents had remembered to spread some cheer in the lives of the less-privileged, feeding and distributing clothes among many on Panchami.

 Friday evenings festivities ended on a musical note, with Lopamudra Mitra obliging loud requests for Benimadhab, Jao Pakhi and Hobu Raja.

 Bank agent hand in credit card fraud

 KINSUK BASU

 If you think you know everything about credit card fraud, it?s time for a reality check. Many in the city are being duped of thousands of rupees by those who issued them the credit cards. 

 Police have received several such complaints of late. They have also recorded cases where the cards have been misused after being taken away for an ?upgrade?. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), too, has registered complaints of credit card fraud. 

 The count of complaints has prompted the police brass to ask, for the first time, the banks concerned to immediately run a check on those working in the credit card sections. 

 ?It is the bank?s responsibility to ensure that a cardholder is not unnecessarily harassed. We want the bank authorities not to violate business ethics so that the customers do not have to seek police help,? said joint commissioner of Calcutta Police Kuldiep Singh.

 Many cardholders, however, are left with no option other than seeking police help. Probir Roy Chaudhury (name changed) of Salt Lake approached the cops after he realised that the people who took away his card for ?an upgrade? had left him poorer by Rs 39,000.

 An engineer with a government development agency, Roy Chaudhury lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar (East) police station. The CID subsequently took up the case. 

 ?Two young men and a woman had turned up at Roy Chaudhury?s residence. They took away his gold credit card against a receipt and went on a spending spree. In 15 minutes, they blew up Rs 11,632 using the card. They even went to a bar to celebrate their success,? said an officer of the CID.

 The detectives have obtained the details of the transactions and have even got a sketch made of the gang leader on the basis of descriptions by witnesses. But not a single arrest has been made.

 So far, Calcutta Police has arrested only two people ? Sandip Ghosh of Bally, in Howrah, and Abhishek Gupta of KK Tagore Street ? in connection with another credit card fraud. The duo allegedly cheated a man named Anirban Sengupta by using the security number of his credit card.

 They obtained the security number while purchasing five airline tickets online for Sengupta. Ghosh was an agent of the bank that had issued the credit card. 

 Both Chaudhury and Sengupta at least had credit cards. Swarup Dutta of Haripal, in Hooghly, had never even applied for a credit card, but was sent a Rs 39,000 bill, with details of purchases made, by a bank. The amount is close to the credit limit of the card on which the bill had been run up. 

 The CID found that a man staying in Entally had made the purchases. How he got the card and why the bill was not sent to Entally is not clear.

 ?We have decided to impress upon the banks that they need to keep a close watch on those who are operating on their behalf. A bank cannot shrug off its responsibility,? said D.P. Tarenia, inspector-general, CID.

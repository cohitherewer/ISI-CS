 Rs 41 crore to lay Rajarhat roads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Connectivity within New Town will soon get a boost, with the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) firming up plans to lay an elaborate network of roads and lanes, spanning 44 km.

 We have allotted Rs 41 crore to build internal roads in Action Area I. Tenders have been floated for awarding the contract for the job. We expect to start work soon after the Puja and wrap up in a year, R.K. Tripathy, managing director of Hidco, implementing agency of the Rajarhat township, said on Friday.

 Though Hidco has built the main thoroughfare of the township that connects Salt Lakes Sector V with VIP Road and is in the process of laying some more arteries, setting up of internal roads linking the various blocks has so far been ignored. 

 Only a few internal roads have been laid in the pocket where housing estates have come up.

 Hidco has allotted around 5,000 plots to individuals and cooperatives. Most are being denied access to the plots because of a lack of link roads. The plot-holders have been mounting pressure on the Hidco authorities to build the connecting roads.

 Our initial thrust was on building major arterial roads. But now that most of the owners have got possession of their plots, we have taken the initiative of building the connecting roads. Our target is to build all the internal roads, around 44 km in length, within a year, Tripathy said.

 Hidco has just published the building rules for New Town and hopes the plot-owners would start construction within a couple of months. 

 It will take at least eight-10 months to build their houses. The internal roads will be ready by that time. During construction, the plot-owners can ferry building material through the temporary roads or vacant plots, the managing director added.

 We had planned to build the internal roads in 2004 using modern technology, which would have saved time, said Hidco director-general (engineering) Subodh Bhattacharya.

 We had engaged experts and procured the automatic road-building machine. But for technical and other reasons, the machine failed to work, forcing us to revert to the conventional method. As the alignment and ground surface are now ready for laying roads, we will be able to finish work fast, he added.

 Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna

 It may have got a mixed response from the critics but the crowds all over seem to be loving every moment of the 3-hour-12-minute magnum opus called Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. 

 Bubblegum romance maker Karan Johars much-hyped coming-of-age movie has made more money in its first weekend in the UK and US than his parent ode Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham five years back.

 Closer home, you can get lucky by just watching the Shah Rukh-Rani Mukherjee romance.

 The newest multiplex in town Fame (Hiland Park), along with its Mumbai counterparts at Andheri, Malad and Kandivali, Fame (Pimpri) and Fame (Nasik), is offering a bonanza for viewers. 

 Any patron watching KANK at these Fame multiplexes and answering four simple questions on the movie correctly stands to win a trip for two to New York, the location where cinematographer Anil Sharma captured the beautiful frames of the grand blockbuster.

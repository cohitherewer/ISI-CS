The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Timeout

 Old Calcutta revisited

 Black-and-white is possibly the best choice of colours with which to capture the vibrant, effervescent mood of the city of Calcutta. As the city reinvents itself everyday as a swank, bustling, 21st century metropolis, it is important to look back on its past to understand the magnitude of the journey and the nature of the change that has taken place within a few decades. The ongoing exhibition of black-and-white photographs on Calcutta by Arun Ganguly offers a fascinating insight into the old face of the city. Featuring 30 photographs, it promises to be of interest to anyone who loves Calcutta or is interested to know more about the city. Viewed through his lens, the city comes to life and develops a unique identity. Besides images of popular landmarks, what makes the show special is its emphasis on personal lifestyles, oddities and idiosyncrasies that endowed the city with its peculiar charm and character.

 Event: A exhibition of photographs by Arun Ganguly 

When: Till December 31, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Boi-Chitra Gallery, College Street Coffee House

 Joka sets out alone on Rs 90-cr campus revamp

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) has embarked on an expansion drive with no help from the government, just yet.

 The Joka campus will be spending close to Rs 90 crore over a period of three years to upgrade its facilities by refurbishing the entire campus, setting up new hostels, classrooms, a management development centre, auditoriums and seminar halls.

 The government?s stand ? stated or otherwise ? has been ?foot your own expansion bill and then we will see?. 

 So, the Joka campus has decided to go it alone, tapping various sources to raise the required funds.

 If things go according to plan, the ambitious infrastructure project will be driven by funds from the institute?s corpus, from executive and short-term programmes as well as from an alumni foundation approved by the board recently.

 ?We plan to organise a number of functions and initiatives through the foundation,? disclosed Ambuj Mohanty, dean of planning and administration.

 Waiting for government assistance is no longer an option on a campus crying out for expansion.

 ?In fact, none of the IIMs have gone to the government for funding in this regard. We do not want our hands tied, and the human resources development ministry?s position has always been ?spend the corpus to expand?, irrespective of which government has been in power. We would rather look at this expenditure as a return on investment,? said an IIMC faculty member.

 While work has already started on campus, the institute expects to have ?at least 80 per cent? of the value additions ready by 2009. 

 ?We have already appointed the architect for the project and the necessary details, with regard to the total outlay of costs, are being worked out as well,? said Mohanty.

 This year will see the institute admitting close to 340 students for its Postgraduate Programme in Management (PGP), by far the largest intake of students amongst all IIMs. 

 With the one-year, full-time and residential Postgraduate Programme for Executives (PGPEX) also scheduled to take off this year, increased space and adequate infrastructure facilities are of prime concern.

 ?The student intake will increase quite a bit from this year. Our executive programme offerings are on the rise as well. IIM Calcutta expects to take in 400 students for the PGP programme quite soon and we also plan to ramp up the number of seats in the PGPEX programme to 120. Therefore, we have to make the necessary arrangements,? pointed out Anindya Sen, dean of programme initiatives.

 The new-look campus will be geared to the future, wi-fi enabled and all.

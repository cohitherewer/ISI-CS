The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 City link in fake licences

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A prominent Calcutta connection has emerged to an inter-state fake registration certificate and driving licence racket busted in Gurgaon.

 Police in Gurgaon recently seized hundreds of blank vehicle-registration certificates and driving licences, bearing the names of issuing authorities in Calcutta and other parts of Bengal. Fake vehicle registration certificates were confiscated during the arrest of the alleged kingpin Naushad on December 30. 

 He has been booked for cheating and forgery and was remanded in police custody by a local court.

 ?It has been learnt that Naushad visited Calcutta and Guwahati frequently. There is a possibility that he somehow procured the certificates from the city. Since the issuing authority was the public vehicles department, it can be concluded that the nexus extended to Calcutta, said an officer of Gurgaon police.

 ?Naushad would charge between Rs 200 and Rs 400 for a fake driving licence. He has confessed to having sold more than 200 fake licences to drivers of heavy vehicles,?? Hanif Qureshi, senior superintendent of Gurgaon police, told Metro on phone.

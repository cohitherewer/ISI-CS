The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Probe signal for green scam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A recent study by the Delhi-based National Institute of Environment Studies has ranked Calcutta last among 16 major cities in green count.

 Not just realty boom or population growth, but irregularities by certain sections of the government are playing their part in earning for the city this dubious distinction.

 A case in point is the execution of the Rs 23-lakh Calcutta Greening Project. The initial grant for the scheme, based on bloated figures, was fixed at Rs 50 lakh.

 A report by principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) K.C. Gayen, a copy of which is with Metro, gives a detailed account of the careless manner in which the project was executed on the Maidan, Salt Lake, Diamond Harbour Road, EM Bypass, Alipore, Garden Reach and other places.

 The PCCF has ordered a probe against Somenath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of urban and recreational forestry, who was the mastermind of the project.

 Violating norms, which require a project report to be passed by the forest directorate and the PCCF, Mukherjees proposals were allowed to be presented directly to the forest department. 

 According to Gayen, the project report pegged the cost of a sapling at Rs 100, against the market rate of Rs 19. Similarly, block plantation on an acre does not require more than Rs 20,000, but the report had placed a demand of Rs 1 lakh for the work.

 The grant amount was reduced to Rs 23 lakh after the chief conservators intervention. An additional Rs 3 lakh was later granted for protective metal railings.

 Somenath Mukherjee claimed: The project has been highly successful and we expect 90 per cent survival rate for the plants. The payments are pending, but we have run up a bill of Rs 35 lakh.

 The money arrived only in late July, though the ideal time for plantation is June-July. Besides, as the forest directorate was not informed in advance, it could not provide the required number of saplings on time.

 The PCCF inspection report states that at most sites, six-inch plantation pits were dug instead of the required two-ft holes. It also points out that several saplings were planted in the shade of trees and less than two metres apart, reducing their chances of survival.

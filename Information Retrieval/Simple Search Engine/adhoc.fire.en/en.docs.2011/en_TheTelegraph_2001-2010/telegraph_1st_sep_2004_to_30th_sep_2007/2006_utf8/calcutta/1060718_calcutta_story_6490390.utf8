?This year, we added a few centres in the eastern 

region, like Jamshedpur, Ranchi and Bhubaneswar. Our efforts to take the debate 

beyond Calcutta in the eastern region have borne fruit as both the best school 

and college awards were bagged by institutions from outside the city,? said Mukta 

Nain, principal, Birla High School (boys).

category and Rangin Pallav Tripathy in the college category ? will compete in

 Hurray for Hartley?s

 Under the supervision of our camp commander Joydeep Ghoshal and trainers Samaresh Sir, Saikat Sir and Gaurav, members of Duke of Edinburgh Foundation from Hartley?s School set out for yet another expedition recently. 

 It was no cake walk, as the boys had to cover 25 km of rugged terrain and steep slopes on foot and compete for the bronze medal. Madhuri Singh Roy, our award leader, was very motivating. The courses on knot-tying, rock climbing and rappelling during the trip ensured that the boys completed the expedition in record time. 

 The first stop was New Jalpaiguri, from where a bus ride was taken to Manebhanjang. During the overnight stay, we were given tips on survival strategies and map-reading lessons. We then trekked to Tumling camp, our final destination. We returned to Calcutta with a bagful of exciting memories. We now eagerly await the next trip.

Touching trip

 It was a unique experience for all of us who recently visited Nabanir, an old age home for women. The ?grandmothers? laughed and clapped as we put up a performance for them. Happiness twinkled in their eyes as we spoke to them. They asked us about our families and school. We could sense how lonely they were without their own families.

 We had taken with us rice, pulses, wheat flour, oil, potatoes, tea, sugar and biscuits, all of which we bought with the money raised by selling lemonade on our school premises. In return, we got their priceless love, affection and blessings.

 We realised how our mere presence could bring such happiness to others. As we were leaving they held our hands and told us ?abar esho, dadubhai?.

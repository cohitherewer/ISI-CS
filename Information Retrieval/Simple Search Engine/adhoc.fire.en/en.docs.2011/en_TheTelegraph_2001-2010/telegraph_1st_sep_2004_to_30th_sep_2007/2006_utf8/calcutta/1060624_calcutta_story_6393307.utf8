 Penned pain and poison

 ?The coffin is ready and I am going in/My cremation ceremony is about to begin.?

 A couple of hours after Aritra and his father Manoj Mukhopadhyay were rushed to hospital, a poem titled Destination Death was found scrawled on a single sheet of paper, tucked away among a pile of books near the foot of the bed of the hotel room.

 Aritra Mukherjee ? that is how he signed his name at the bottom of the page of poetry ? goes on to write: ?Death is calling me? I cried, I died in the end.?

 Till late on Friday, Aritra ? who loved reading Harry Potter, watching Bicycle Thieves and listening to Bruce Springsteen ? was struggling for life after he, along with his father and mother, had consumed poison in a final desperate attempt to beat their debt trap, forever.

 The suicide pact had been planned out meticulously by the family, police said. 

 The bottle of Metacid 50 found at the site ?was potent enough to kill, and kill quickly?, sleuths added.

 A.K. Gupta, head of forensic science department of Medical College and Hospital, said the father and son may have survived because they had been wheeled in in the nick of time. The poison mixed with food slows down its effect, Gupta explained.

 The family, that would ask the hotel staff to hail a taxi for them every day, did not leave their room since Wednesday. The last time the bellboys saw Manoj was late on Thursday afternoon, when he stepped out once.

 Hotel staff and sleuths now feel Manoj, who hailed from Shantipur, in Nadia, may have stepped out to fetch the food and the bottle of pesticide.

 The remains of a lunch on a small table adjacent to the bed in room 311 suggest the pesticide was mixed with the food. This was possibly on Thursday evening, following which the television set was turned on to shut out any other sound from the room.

 The TV was finally switched off after police entered the room on Friday morning.

 But Aritra?s words, penned on paper, rang out loud in the silent room: ?My heart is shattered and my dreams are all broken/I gave a little fight but I lost it all again.?

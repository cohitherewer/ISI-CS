 It was one hot, hot evening in Calcutta on Saturday and no one was feeling the heat more than the 12 quizzers battling it out at the Bengal Club lawns for the prestigious Second Annual Bengal Club Quiz trophy. 

 The general quiz, presented by The Telegraph in association with Hutch, saw 40-odd teams writing out the preliminary rounds as the man of the day, quizmaster Siddhartha Basu, was warming up to an evening of fun, funda and everything in between.

 After the 25-question elimination round, the six two-member teams to make it to the finals were Dalhousie Institute, Irregulars, Inmaniacs, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Octette and Indian. With the quiz being open to both institutions and individuals, the final line-up comprised a lovely mix of corporate charisma and individual flamboyance.

 Once on stage, the Q amp;A shifted to the screen with Basu resorting to his quiz software that he so lovingly calls Quizine. From cryptic clues to audio cues, the quiz saw the Mastermind man at his ?mindblowing? best.

 And he himself enjoyed the stint a lot. ?People keep talking about places like Bangalore and Delhi and what not, but when it comes to quizzing, Calcutta has that edge. Many of the participants here made it to Mastermind and that is, indeed, a big thing,? said Basu.

 A lot of the questions in the final hovered around the Bengal Club turf with such lovely anecdotes as how Prince Charles put up in one of the rooms and now, the club has that room named after him. There was also a special round on clubs around the country from Darjeeling Club to Shillong Golf Club.

 There were hordes of questions for the audiences and the packed Bengal Club lawns were more than happy to answer them. A right reply won the audience member a T-shirt or a CD or a box of chocolates. 

 But even as the quizmaster spent quality time amidst the audience, the big fight on stage was getting bigger. TCS and Inmaniacs were into a mini-battle of their own as the buzzer button kept deciding who was on top of the leaderboard (that?s what Basu calls the scoreboard).

 Then came the all-important round, All or Nothing, where if you can spot the six correct options to a question from the nine given, you get 30 points straightaway but one wrong choice would mean your score stays intact. The topics ranged from brands and their inventors to school and college drop-outs to the nomenclature of airports.

 The last round, on the buzzer, turned out to be the deciding one in the end. The TCS team of Srikanth and Sabyasachi, which has been almost invincible in the recent quiz contests in and around town, won again. The two took home the latest handsets from Nokia bolstered with a Hutch post-paid connection.

 The second prize ? DVD players ? went to Gautam and Anil of Inmaniacs while Octette, comprising Jayashree and Soumyadip, came third and took home vacuum cleaners. Apart from the special prizes, all the top three teams won tea hampers, whisky bottles and CD sets.

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi sat through the full quiz while former footballer P.K. Banerjee made a guest appearance.

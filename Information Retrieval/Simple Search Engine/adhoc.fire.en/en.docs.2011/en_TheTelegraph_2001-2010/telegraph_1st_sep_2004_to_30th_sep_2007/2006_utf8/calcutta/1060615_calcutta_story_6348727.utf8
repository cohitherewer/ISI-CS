 He makes defenders around the world dance to his tune, but what Brazilian beat does Ronaldinho rock to? He bends it better than anyone else, but what does it take to be in David Beckham?s shoes?

 All these answers await Calcuttans on the retail racks, and they are just lapping it all up. Cashing in on the World Cup craze are soccer-sourced CDs, VCDs, DVDs and board games, books and biographies.

 ?It?s amazing to see how much people want to know about football and their footballers. We have run out of the autobiographies of Pele and Maradona. The current craze are Ronaldo?s biography and Beckham?s autobiography,? says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. 

 Other swift sellers are The Rupa Football World Cup Fact Book and Complete Book of the World Cup 2006, a compendium of every Cup since 1930.

 The sights and sounds of soccer merge at MusicWorld and Landmark, where VCDs and DVDs on Cup glory are bestsellers. ?The football fever is so high that people are picking up anything even remotely associated with football or football stars,? said a floor manager at MusicWorld, where one full rack dedicated to football merchandise is selling more than ?20 units a day?. 

 A hot tip: Ronaldinho?s favourite 14 Brazilian tracks.

 The FIFA CD-ROM (computer game) and a football version of Monopoly have taken Landmark by storm. 

 ?The importers of the FIFA CD-ROM completely underestimated the demand for the game. Most stores have run out of stock. We have sold 50 of these CD-ROMs (priced at Rs 1,299) and have advance bookings for another 30,? said Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark. 

 ?In a cricket-crazy city, the popularity of Ronaldinho and Raul is completely unparalleled,? he added.

 Those denied the fun of virtual football have turned to a board game. Funskool has launched Monopoly: 2006 FIFA World Cup Edition (Rs 499), targeting the young soccer fan wanting to fill up idle hours between Cup games with football, football and more football.

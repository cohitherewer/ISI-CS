 The day after a church in Kalikapur was demolished by the CMDA to pave way for laying a wider road to the airport, its members on Monday vowed to fight tooth and nail.

 ?We will not budge an inch from the site. If necessary, it will become our graveyard,? declared Reverend Sukrit Roy of Christ Mission Ashram. 

 He was among the hundreds who had assembled at the spot where the church once stood. 

 The space will be utilised to construct the Prince Anwar Shah Road-EM Bypass connector.

 A representative of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba said the organisation would try to meet the President during his visit to the city on Tuesday and raise the issue. The church authorities have also arranged a demonstration at the site. 

 The church, a creche, a women?s hostel and a school stood on the 33-cottah plot occupied by the Ashram. All the structures were demolished on Sunday. 

 While the church authorities are claiming that they have not been offered land by the government for relocation, CMDA officials maintain that they are ready with a compensation package, to be granted to those with the necessary papers.

 During the day, the church members were busy clearing the rubble. They surrounded the area with aluminium sheets to protect the properties and provide shelter to people who lived on the premises. 

 Roy remained firm on the decision to not approach the government for help. The church authorities would hold demonstrations and convene a meeting to explain their stand, he added.

 Officials of the CMDA, too, did not soften their stand. ?We have simply complied with a court order. Anyone can visit our office and see the order. The debris will soon be cleared and construction of the road started,? asserted Debdas Bhattacharya, chief engineer (traffic and transportation), CMDA.

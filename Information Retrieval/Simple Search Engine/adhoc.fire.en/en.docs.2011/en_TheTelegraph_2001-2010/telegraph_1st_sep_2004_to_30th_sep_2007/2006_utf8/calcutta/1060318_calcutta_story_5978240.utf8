The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Beam ranks close with blackout 

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 With the conditional access system (CAS) rollout a few weeks away ? on paper, that is ? the viewer continues to be held to ransom with broadcasters and service providers back in the ring over dues disputes.

 Friday found nearly 75 per cent of the 20-lakh-odd cable and satellite homes in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area going without the STAR channels as multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable yanked off the bouquet for 24 hours.

 On Wednesday, STAR had switched off its channels on the Manthan network owing to non-payment of dues.

 According to a message displayed on the blank screens of SitiCable and Manthan viewers, the MSOs were on a ?token strike? to protest STAR?s ?high-handedness?.

 ?There are several issues, like STAR asking for hikes and not willing to sort out disputes in the presence of an arbitrator,? a SitiCable official said.

 STAR officials said Manthan and SitiCable were making ?unwarranted and false propaganda? against the broadcaster. ?There has been no price hike since last year and viewers pay less than Rs 2 per day for all the STAR channels combined,? pointed out Yash Khanna, senior vice-president, corporate affairs, STAR India.

 STAR is also fighting Manthan and Indian Cable Net (a unit of SitiCable) on dues disputes in the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal.

 Viewers on Friday waiting to catch Kasautii Zindagii Kay on STAR Plus or Laughter Challenge II on STAR One, got a breather with MSO CableComm and Purvalaya, a unit of SitiCable, refusing to switch off the channels on their own networks.

 ?We are a corporate body and our board has categorically stated that it would not allow subscriber interest to be harmed,? said Dileep Singh Mehta, of the Descon-controlled MSO CableComm.

 ?At a meeting called on Thursday night by the operators? associations and the two other MSOs, we made it clear that we?re willing to discuss issues concerning the industry but not payment disputes of other MSOs,? Mehta added.

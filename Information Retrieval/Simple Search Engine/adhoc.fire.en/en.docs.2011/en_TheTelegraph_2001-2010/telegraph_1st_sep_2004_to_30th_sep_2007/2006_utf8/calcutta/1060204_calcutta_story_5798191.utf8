 Cinnamon for diabetes, L-Carnitine for obesity, Korean Ginseng for stress or Ginkgo Biloba for healthy circulation?

 As more and more Calcuttans seek better tools and techniques to live better, Health Shoppe, the countrys first one-stop self-help alternate-care store, which opened three months ago on Rowland Road, is gearing up to spread its wings.

 Next on the roadmap is a second store in City Centre, Salt Lake, scheduled to open in mid-March. Its a space-sharing model, where we will co-exist with the Apollo Pharmacy in the mall, sans boundaries, but with clearly demarcated floor space, says Amit Mohta, CEO, Nantra Retailing and Distribution Limited, which owns the Health Shoppe brand.

 Calcuttas second Health Shoppe will replicate the format of the Rowland Road store in style and content. Self-help products in body care, personal care, speciality food, vitamins and supplements, magnetic therapy, footcare, hair and skin care will adorn 19 cabinets, with the look and feel exactly the same.

 Our City Centre outlet will be a co-shop format where Apollo Pharmacy and we can leverage each others strengths ? we are doing alternative health, they are doing prescription products and theres definite retail synergy. We would like to do similar co-shop formats elsewhere in the country, declares director Deepak Saraf.

 With the Ts crossed and the Is dotted at Rowland Road, and the initial response very favourable even without any concerted campaign, the chain is now comfortable kicking off its expansion programme to make living better a habit with its clientele.

 We are looking at around 100 stores all over India in the next three to five years, with at least six in Calcutta, in all three formats ? own store, franchisee and co-shop. Health Shoppe would eventually be like your neighbourhood Boots or Holland amp; Barrett store, promises Saraf.

 The group is participating in the Art of Living fair in Bangalore (February 17-19) to promote the Health Shoppe brand nationally, create awareness about the model and network with potential franchisees. As a clean retail avenue, more and more people are willing to enter the healthcare segment and with increasing awareness on well-being, the market is growing all the time, observes Mohta.

 Nantra Retailing and Distribution, which now has its supply chain management system firmly in place, has beefed up import of natural self-help products to cater to the increasing demand. On the racks, there are new items like fish oil and flaxseed oil for the heart, joint-support complex for arthritis, Lutein and Eyetamins for the eyes and borage oil for healthy skin and nails.

 A clutch of antioxidants and anti-stress compositions are also moving well, as are the specially imported Total Vitamin kits and chewable multivitamins for children, says Saraf. Acidophilus for balancing intestinal microflora, shark cartilage capsules for joint support and milk thistle for a healthy liver function are also in demand at the alternative care address.

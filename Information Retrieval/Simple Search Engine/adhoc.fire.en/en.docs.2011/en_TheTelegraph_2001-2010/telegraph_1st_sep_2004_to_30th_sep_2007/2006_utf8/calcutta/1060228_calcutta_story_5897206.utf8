 What: PC Chandra Sananda Dream Diamonds evening.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand.

 When: Saturday, 7 pm onwards.

 Take a look: The evening was a celebration of the aura of a womans best friend ? diamonds. The show kicked off with winners of the PC Chandra Sananda Dream Diamonds contest being felicitated on stage.

 The contest with a celebrity panel of judges ? designer Sharbari Datta, actress Aparajita Ghosh Das, photographer Vivek Das and musician Anindo Chatterjee ? drew close to 500 entries. Besides Calcutta, there were entries from places like Guwahati and Hyderabad. Out of the 50 shortlisted participants, the final winners were chosen on the basis of grace, poise and overall appeal.

 In sync with the flavour of the evening, winner Suchitra Mayuri Devi from Guwahati won a sparkling diamond set. First runner-up Chandrima Datta and second runner-up Arki Datta Chowdhury bagged diamond earrings and a ring, respectively.

 Fashion focus: Next on stage was the much-awaited fashion show that showcased diamond jewellery set in gold by PC Chandra.

 Ramp rocker Jesse Randhawa, actress Mahek Chahal and actor Rahul Raj Singh, along with city models Aritri, Bidita, Pamela, Devdutta and Tollywood actress Sayantani displayed the brand new D Elite collection from the jewellery house.

 The theme of the fashion show, broken up into five sequences, was love in its various stages. And the models enacted the different stages ? boy meets girl, love is in the air, dating and proposal, celebration, and engagement ? draped in outfits by designer duo Dev and Nil.

 Live music by the band A Class Apart matched the mood of each sequence. The show was choreographed by Dream Merchants, while Aniruddha Chakladar dolled up the models.

 The first sequence ? boy meets girl ? began on a filmi note. As the song Hello played in the background, a girl in all white looked for her prince charming and finally found him, their eyes meeting for the first time. The sequence boasted a collection of jewellery blending tradition and modernity ? delicate diamond pendants and brooches aesthetically set in gold.

 The second sequence ? love is in the air ? had the song You fill up my senses playing in the background. Girls in layered skirts and off-shoulder tops walked the ramp flaunting diamond pendants and bracelets combined with coloured stones.

 The evening progressed as A Class Apart regaled the audience with an old Beatles number peppered with classical renditions.

 The fashion show returned with a continuation of the romantic theme. The dating sequence with the background score as I just called to say, had beautiful necklaces, pendants and chokers where diamonds were intricately combined with drop-cut sapphires and triangular-cut amethysts.

 The next session was all about celebrating the nuances of a new relationship. Necklaces, earrings and bangles had diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds making quite a collection. The showstealer was a diamond neckpiece ornately set in white gold.

 The final sequence was engagement, where models in saris showcased traditional bridal sets in classic solitaire, well-cut diamonds, pearls, rubies and semi-precious stones. The collection was a fine mesh of Indian, European and Egyptian motifs. An earring covering the whole ear, moving on with thin extensions to form a crown was the big hit. 

 The fashion show was followed by an audio-visual presentation that showcased the collection once again. 

 Voiceover: Diamonds are the purest form of jewellery. This evening we celebrate it and revel in its grandeur, smiled Prashanto Chandra, deputy managing director of the brand.

 Also spotted: Designer Sharbari Datta, singer and actor Shilajit and TV actor Rudraneil.

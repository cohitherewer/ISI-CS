SHAUN KENWORTHY

The other day one of my friends was whining about 

fusion food. He said it was all a load of rubbish. I asked him what he meant, 

to which he answered that people should just keep things as they were supposed 

to be (sounding like my grandfather) and stop trying to ruin them. For me, there 

are no rules with food. Good food will be good and bad will be bad. No rules, 

no barriers. It just comes down to natural progression. 

But Ive said this many times and Im sticking to it now Indian food really hasnt come any further forward in the past 100 years. Not in this country at least, with the exception of maybe a handful of restaurants. Menus are still stuffed with the same old names: Butter Chicken, Mutton Rogan Josh, Tandoori Chicken. All fantastic dishes in their own right, but menu after menu reads the same.

 There are all sorts of ingredients available now in India and all Im saying is that chefs and cooks should start embracing them and using them within the parameters of their cuisine. In my eyes there are two areas where change can take place. Indian food is a fantastic world of tastes and flavours, but it now needs to evolve and catch up with the world to make itself more viable for an international market. At the moment, its just too rich and stodgy for most of the rest of the world. People are becoming more and more health-conscious every day. French food took a reality check about 20 years ago, when all that cream, butter and animal fats were reduced.

 Indian food also needs to start incorporating other food types. There is so much available now on the supermarket shelves. Ive played around with all sorts of things. Just be adventurous and use your imagination. The dessert below may give you a couple of tips. I wont call it fusion. It is a naturally progressive dessert that uses some readily available international ingredients.

American Sweet Potato Pancakes with Date Compote, 

Rabri and Pecan Gur Butter 

 For the pancakes, mix together in a bowl 150g brown sugar, one tsp baking powder, a pinch of salt, 250g flour, tsp ground cinnamon, tsp ground nutmeg, 200ml milk, one and a half eggs, three tbsp vegetable oil, tsp vanilla essence and 120g mashed yam. Beat all this together and allow to sit at room temperature for around one hour. Next, in a clean saucepan place 150g fresh dates and a grating of orange zest and add 100ml gur syrup and a splash of brandy. Simmer gently for around one minute. For the pecan gur butter, you will need 100g butter (room temperature), four tbsp gur syrup, 50 g of toasted pecans (or any other nut). Combine all together and set aside. Last, in a non-stick frying pan, heat around one tsp vegetable oil over medium heat, spoon in around one tbsp of batter. Cook until it turns relatively dark brown on both sides. Keep repeating until all the batter is used up. To assemble, simply stack the pancakes with a spoon of rabri, a spoon of dates and a small blob of the butter.

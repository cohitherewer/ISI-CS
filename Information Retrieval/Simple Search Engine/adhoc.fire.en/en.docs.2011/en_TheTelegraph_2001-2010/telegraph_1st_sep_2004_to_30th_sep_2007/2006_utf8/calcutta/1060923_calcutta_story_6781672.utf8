The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Awash, late or shut 

 For many, tarpan time on Mahalaya was pushed back 

 because of waterlogging. By 8.30 am, the ghats were dotted 

 with devotees, three lakh of whom offered prayers to their 

 ancestors.

 Stranded passengers and anxious relatives were the order 

 of the day at Sealdah and Howrah railway stations, as train 

 services were disrupted. EMU locals had to be short-terminated, 

 while a few South Eastern Railway trains left from Santragachhi 

 and Shalimar instead of Howrah, and some long-distance trains, 

 led by Poorva Express, were delayed.

 On Elgin Road, Crossword bookstore was closed due to waterlogging. 

 Down the road, Forum mall was open but 50 per cent of the 

 shops kept their shutters down.

 It was a mixed bag at the multiplexes. There was a 40 per 

 cent drop in Friday occupancy at INOX (Forum) and a 50 per 

 cent drop at 89 Cinemas, but INOX (City Centre) raked in 

 the holiday crowd with a 40 per cent rise in footfall.

 Calcutta couldnt put on its golfing shoes as the courses 

 at both Royal Calcutta Golf Club and Tollygunge Club were 

 declared off-limits. Saturday, too, is unlikely to see a 

 tee-off at either venue.

 Autumn array on Cue

 Neha Kapur sports a Cue creation at the India Fashion Week grand finale in April 

 Basking in the glory of their recent success at the India Fashion Week in New Delhi, Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi of Cue have their hands full right now. A host of orders and enquiries from international buyers and a long line-up of shows promise to keep the designers busy for the next few months. 

 For starters, the duo from Delhi is set to scorch the ramp at Tantra on Friday night, as it unveils its fall-winter 2006-07 collection at the Fashion Police show.

 The monthly midnight style affair at The Park will see an eveningwear line from the designers, a take-off from the collection showcased at the grand finale of the April edition of India Fashion Week. 

 We have a very good market in Calcutta and people there follow our collections very well. So, theres no way we can show an old line. Were making a new line for the Fashion Police show, which is on the lines of our grand finale collection, Rahul told GoodLife from Delhi.

 The high-on-glamour line comprises skirts in an array of shapes, along with a variety of dresses. Puff sleeves, gathers, ruching, laces, patchwork, applique and foil printing describe the look. 

 Theres also a lot of metallic embellishment lending white-and-gold or white-and-silver effect. The colours are whites, off-whites, blacks and black-and-white combos.

 Georgettes, crepes, chiffons and knits shape the clothes. The designers will showcase about 30 garments, including some mens wear pieces as well.

 The look is very young and the show will also be very dramatic. We are concentrating a lot on the music, shares Rahul. 

 After the show, the collection will find a place on the racks of 85 Lansdowne. The designers will also be present at the store for personal consultation on Saturday. Were very excited about coming to Calcutta, adds Rohit.

 The Fashion Police show is just the start of the duos style stint with Calcutta this season. Rahul and Rohit will be back in the city for the Blenders Pride Fashion Tour in October and for the Stylefile show in December. But we will show different collections at each show, promises Rahul.

 Shows apart, the designers are busy with buyer enquiries following their successful showing at the India Fashion Week earlier this month, where the duo showcased a crisp international line in white and blue inspired by Dutch dolls and porcelain. 

 Apart from our regular buyers, weve tied up with quite a few new international stores. This includes a big Japanese store and talks are on with Galeries Lafayette in Paris, reveals Rahul.

 Till Friday midnight, then...

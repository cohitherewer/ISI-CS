 Civic body to take over ponds

 Bachan Bose: The promoter raj has endangered waterbodies and wetlands in the city. What steps have you taken to protect them?

 There are about 3,800 registered waterbodies in Calcutta. The borough executive engineers have been asked to ensure that not a single waterbody gets filled behind the civic body?s back. The CMC has decided to take over the management and control of the waterbodies under landfill threat.

 We have already taken over a 58-cottah private pond in the Cossipore area and restored it. A notice has been slapped on those who tried to fill up a waterbody in Topsia. We have also taken steps against filling of four ponds in Behala. I want local residents, NGOs and school students to start an awareness campaign and movement against filling of waterbodies.

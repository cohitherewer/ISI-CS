 Matter of life 

 and death

 Ronnie loves playing video games 

 and chatting with his friends. But he hardly has the time 

 for these small joys of childhood. Even his Sunday schedule 

 is jam-packed with coaching classes. After all, he has to 

 stand in the Madhyamik this year to fulfil his parents 

 dreams. Amu, the domestic help at Ronnies house, is of 

 his age. However, she has a burden of a different kind 

 earning for her poverty-stricken family back in the village. 

 Ronnie does well in his exams but he doesnt become the 

 top-ranker. Disappointed with his performance, his parents 

 mount more pressure on him and a time comes when Ronnie 

 buckles under it. He attempts to take his life but Amu saves 

 him in the nick of time.

 The story revolving around adolescent 

 suicide was narrated through a street play by schoolchildren 

 at five venues in the city on October 10, to mark World 

 Mental Health Day. The street plays were part of a programme 

 organised by NGO Chip to spread awareness about suicide 

 in the age group of 14 to 21-year-olds. The programme was 

 supported by Hope Foundation, Hive India, Samikshani, All 

 Bengal Womens Union, Tomorrow Foundation and Crisis Intervention.

 Children from Modern High School 

 and from bustees in the Tangra area, where Chip does a lot 

 of work, participated in rallies on Gobinda Khatick Road 

 and Syed Amir Ali Avenue. A debate in Bengali on Parents 

 and the educational system are responsible for adolescent 

 stress and suicide was held at Modern High School in the 

 evening.

 One of the participants in the 

 debate, Moon Moon Pal of Tomorrow Foundation, pointed out 

 how many children are forced into too many extra-curricular 

 activities by their parents. The second speaker S.K. Sitara 

 of Future Hope School blamed youngsters for distancing themselves 

 from family and friends after getting involved in superficial 

 love affairs. Debayan Majumdar of St James School criticised 

 the government for the present education system ,which endorses 

 only the overall topper, and not the student who scores 

 high only in the subjects of his or her liking. 

 All the eight participants felt 

 that suicide was not a solution to adolescent woes. They 

 urged youngsters suffering from depression to seek help 

 from family, friends, teachers or NGOs instead of building 

 up the frustration within oneself. Hive Indias Sahayata

 Kick-off

 The semi-finals of a football 

 tournament held in our school saw a spirited contest between 

 Nalanda and Ujjaini houses and between Taxila and Vikramshila 

 houses. All the students crowded around the playground, 

 with even the teachers cheering on their favourites. Taxila 

 won 5-4, while Ujjaini won in the second match 2-1. The 

 finals are sure to be a treat for all of us.

 In an inter-school basketball 

 tournament for boys, organised by The Matrix, our schools 

 Interact club, St Thomas Boys emerged the winner and MP 

 Birla was the runner-up. In the girls competition, the 

 host school was the topper.

 Whiff of nostalgia

 Nostalgia, the reunion of the 

 Calcutta chapter of the North Point Alumni Association, 

 was presented by The Telegraph at Oberoi Grand recently. 

 A quiz saw former students of other schools in and around 

 the city also joining in. Kalyan Gupta of the 1974 batch 

 of North Point remarked that the event was a way of bringing 

 the old boys together.

 The contest included more than 

 60 teams, scaled down to eight in the elimination round. 

 Rather than stressing on current affairs, it was a looking 

 back on events past and present. Quizmaster Barry OBrien 

 set the tone for the evening with the question: Name the 

 stations you would pass on the train ride from NJP (New 

 Jalpaiguri) to Ghoom.

 The eight teams included St Xaviers 

 Collegiate School, Calcutta Boys High School, La Martiniere 

 for Boys and Phanindra Deb Institution from Jalpaiguri. 

 They battled it out in four rounds, the clincher being the 

 buzzer round of 20 questions. The winner was the Kendriya 

 Vidyalaya team which included city quizzer Jayshree Mohanta.

 The organisers felicitated Manoj 

 Ghosh, headmaster of Chandanpur Primary School, Barasat, 

 and Mary Pinto, former teacher of St Teresas Secondary 

 School. The money from the meet will go towards improving 

 the school building.

 Chit Chat

 The Chalk Circle staged in September 

 at Padatik

 Stage pull

 British theatre director JAMES 

 WILLIAMS came to Calcutta in August to conduct a drama workshop 

 with schoolchildren, organised by British Council. After 

 the workshop, while enjoying a well-earned vacation, he 

 hit upon the idea of The Chalk Circle, an adaptation 

 of Brechts The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Collaborating 

 with members of Theatrician, many of whom had been a part 

 of the British Council workshop, he put up the production 

 within five days in September.

 Heres what the artistic director 

 in The Living Theatre Company had to say about youngsters 

 into theatre in Calcutta.

 How did you manage 

 to train the kids in just five days?

 We did a lot of improvisation 

 to bring the play alive to them. For instance, we had the 

 poor people physically carrying the rich to portray the 

 relationship between the classes. These exercises increase 

 their comfort level on the stage.

 What is the difference 

 between theatre in India and in Britain?

 In India, theatre is not economically 

 viable as it is in Britain. Here, it is seen more as a hobby 

 during school or college. Later, the pressure of work often 

 compels kids to give it up. Paradoxically, people in theatre 

 are extremely committed to accommodate their passion. The 

 way people here balance theatre with a profession is fantastic.

 Are youngsters 

 here any different?

 Youngsters are pretty much the 

 same everywhere. But discipline is worse in the UK. Also, 

 the kids here are more eager to play around with ideas. 

 Surprisingly, physical inhibitions are less. They know it 

 is difficult to make a career in theatre. For kids in Britain, 

 workshops are often a stepping stone to drama college.

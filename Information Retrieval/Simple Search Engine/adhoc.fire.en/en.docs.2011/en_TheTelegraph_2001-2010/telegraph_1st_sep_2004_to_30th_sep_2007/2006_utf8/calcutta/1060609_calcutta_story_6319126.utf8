 The frenzied wait is finally over. The FIFA World Cup 2006 kicks off on Friday night as soccer fever peaks in the city. 

 The Calcutta football fanatic is dangerously close to where the action is ? with the matches live from Germany on screen and the flavours of Germany on his platter.

 The Taj group of hotels, with Central Marketing Organisation Of German Agricultural Industries and Lufthansa, is hosting Taste Of Germany, a one-month event showcasing the diversity of German cuisine ? theres much more to it than beer ? while the World Cup plays on a plasma screen.

 During the past Cups, the menu had football-related names and games. This year, the idea is to make the experience more intensive? Catching the game on the plasma screen and munching on authentic German delights, says Modhurima Sinha, director, public relations, Taj Bengal.

 Five experts, including a master chef, a butcher, a baker and two confectioners from Germany, will whip up the dishes at Taj hotels in Calcutta, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chennai, Goa, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune from June 9 to July 9.

 Taj Bengal in Calcutta will host three specialists ? master chef Gerd Noppel, baker and confectioner Wolfgang Altenburger and master-confectioner Lothar Buss ? for 10 days.

 There will be sausages, black-forest salami, black-forest ham, 12 varieties of cheese, Bavarian mustard, meat loaves and Pumpernikel bread, all imported specially from Germany.

 We have made sure the items are not Indianised at all, says executive sous chef Nitin Mathur from Taj Bengal. 

 Lothar, already here, is upbeat about the German food fiesta. I have come with my set of ideas and am getting to know Indian culture and cuisine. The outcome should be a blend of both in my chocolates, smiles the man who runs his own chocolate firm in Germany, Chocolateroom.

 Truffle with Kirsch and Marzipan Fruits are some yummy treats that Lothar will gift the city. Truffle with Chilli and Chocolate Rock Salt are items that he will whip up keeping the Indian palate in mind.

 Gerd and Wolfgang will pamper your tastebuds with Cheese Spatzle (a noodle preparation), Onion Cake Reibekuchen (a German pancake) and authentic delicacies like Kirschmichel Semmelknodel Chicken Geschnetzeltes.

 The festival will be on at Hub, the 24-hour international food theatre, the bar Junction and the nightclub Incognito simultaneously. 

 While the Hub buffet, available for both lunch and dinner, will be home to German main course preparations and desserts, Junction will focus on finger food. The Hub buffet is priced at Rs 650 plus taxes on weekdays and Rs 725 plus taxes on weekends. 

 At Incognito, there will be unlimited food and drink on the night of the matches for an entry fee of Rs 600 per football fan.

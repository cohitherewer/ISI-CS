 New age impressions

 Exploding the myth that there is continuity in art, Gen Next, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by artists of the modern generation, also provides specific proof of a definite trend in artistic creativity at different periods in history; one that is independent of the creative output of preceding eras. Featuring works by 27 artists, mainly from Bengal, the show represents the dawn of a new age in art, brimming with youthful energy and reflecting the attitudes of the present with no obligation to the past. Painters have generally expressed themselves in loud pallettes, with improvised forms bearing a hint of irreverence on the part of the artist. Sculptors have treated their medium, whether bronze, stone or wood, as a musical instrument to be played upon without inhibition. Each work is an expression of imagination, curiosity and intelligence. Participating artists include Barun Chowdhury, Debanjan Roy, Farhad Hussain (a painting by him appears left), Jayanta Paul, Nobina Gupta, Ritendra Roy, Sourav Jana and Sutanu Chatterjee.

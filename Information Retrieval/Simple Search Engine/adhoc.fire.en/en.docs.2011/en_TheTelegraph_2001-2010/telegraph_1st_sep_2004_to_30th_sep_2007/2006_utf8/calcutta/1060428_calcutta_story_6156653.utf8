The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Meet the super six

 On a day when the city 

 exercised its democratic right to pick the best in the political 

 arena, GoodLife votes for the citys 

 current lifestyle leaders who have made a difference in their 

 fields 

 RAMP 

 RULER (FEMALE):

 The only female model from the city in the national 

 news recently, Sreshthaa 

 was second runners-up at the Ford Supermodel Contest. 

 The dusky beauty also took the ramp at the Wills Lifestyle 

 India Fashion Week earlier this month

 Beauty 

 BIZ: 

 Bridgette Jones 

 just gifted the city its finest beauty address. Bridgette 

 Jones Fashion Salon, the swank two-storey salon on 

 Sarat Bose Road that opened its doors this February, 

 introduces the Calcutta clientele to some never-before-experienced 

 beauty concepts

 MAKE-UP 

 room: 

 Aniruddha Chakladar 

 tops the list of the handful of make-up artistes filling 

 the void left behind by the death of Prabir De last 

 year. Be it model shoots or ramp affairs, Aniruddha 

 is usually the preferred pick of most designers 

 DJ 

 CONSOLE:

 He introduced international sounds to the city, 

 breaking away from the Bollywood beat fixation. Thanks 

 to DJ Girish, 

 the crowd at Shisha rocks to progressive house and 

 hip hop on Wednesdays and Fridays, while remixes rule 

 the other party spots in town

 FASHION 

 ARENA:

 The undisputed couture king of the city, Sabyasachi 

 Mukherjee did it again this year. The designer 

 rocked the Mumbai ramp with his most mature 

 collection The Snail that was unveiled at the Lakme 

 Fashion Week in end-March. The winning streak continues 

 with Sabya all set to take the New York Fashion Week 

 ramp in September

 RAMP 

 RULER (MALE): 

 After holding his own against the likes of Upen Patel 

 on the city ramps for some time now, Neeraj 

 Surana made it to the finals of Grasim 

 Mr India 2006 contest held earlier this year.

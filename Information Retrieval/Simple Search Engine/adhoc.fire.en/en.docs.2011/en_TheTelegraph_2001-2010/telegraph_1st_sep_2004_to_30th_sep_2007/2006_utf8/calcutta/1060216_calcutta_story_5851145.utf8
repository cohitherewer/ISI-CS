 The army on Wednesday inspected the Maidan site of the Calcutta Book Fair 2006 and expressed its satisfaction at the clean-up drive by the Publishers and Booksellers Guild.

 It has even offered the Guild a five-day extension before the second round of joint inspections at the site on February 20. Col Malook Singh, during the inspection, said: ?The progress so far is fine and we think in another two-three days, the ground should be ready.? 

 Expressing his satisfaction, Singh, however, pointed out a few more things for the Guild to carry out on a war footing. This includes doing up patches of the ground towards the southern end of the site ? towards the Elliot Park end ? which had been left unattended. 

 ?Though this end doesn?t come under their jurisdiction, I think they need to do up the place, as all the cars were parked here,? Singh said. 

 While touring the Maidan, Singh appreciated the Guild?s effort to to sow China grass in their bid to green up the ground. 

 Earlier, senior police officers, including the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma and deputy commissioner (south) N.R. Babu toured the ground and carried out an inspection with Guild officials. Sharma said the police were satisfied and were giving the Guild another 10 days to complete the clean-up. 

 The fair organisers, too, were happy. ?We have already spent close to Rs 5 lakh for cleaning up the Maidan. Can you make out that such a huge fair was held here just a few weeks back? We have also placed a proposal to the state government, seeking permission to do up the place in terms of greenery. We just need four months and we can completely change the scenario of this area,? asserted Sudhangshu Dey, Guild?s ground secretary.

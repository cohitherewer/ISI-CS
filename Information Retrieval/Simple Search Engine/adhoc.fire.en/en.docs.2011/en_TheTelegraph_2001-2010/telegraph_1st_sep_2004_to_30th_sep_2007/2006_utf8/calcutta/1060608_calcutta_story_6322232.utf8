 Delhi thaws for Buddha pet project

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Rs 2,400-crore dream project, the Light Rail Transit (LRT), on the backburner for the past three years, is moving again, with the Centre agreeing to arrange funds from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).

 Writers? Buildings officers say the Union urban development ministry has asked the government to submit the project report, along with the environment impact assessment report, for LRT.

 A team of JBIC officers is scheduled to arrive in the city on June 19 for an on-the-spot assessment of the project. 

 The members will physically inspect the proposed LRT route, meet the chief minister and hold discussions with the government officers.

 The Japan Railway Technical Services, a consultant of the Japanese government, had submitted a feasibility report to the state government in May, in which the agency recommended implementation of the project to improve passenger transport services in and around the city.

 ?We are happy that the Centre has given the green light for the LRT project. It has asked us to submit the feasibility report along with the environment impact assessment report. The Centre is considering implementing the project with JBIC funds. We will submit the reports soon and feel that there will be no problem this time to get the JBIC funds,?? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro on Wednesday.

 The government will involve a private company to implement the project. The private firm will provide the state?s share of the investment. According to the funding pattern, JBIC will provide 85 per cent of the project cost. The rest, including operation and maintenance costs, will be borne by the government.

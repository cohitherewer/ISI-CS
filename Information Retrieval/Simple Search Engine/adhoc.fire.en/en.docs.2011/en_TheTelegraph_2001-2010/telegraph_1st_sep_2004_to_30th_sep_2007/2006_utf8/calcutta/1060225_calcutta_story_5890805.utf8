 A small country, Israel has the highest density of known archaeological sites per kilometer. Christian and, later, Muslim communities living in this land have left numerous traces of their rich, distinctive cultures. Since the middle of the last century, the search for religious and cultural roots has attracted countless travellers, scholars and clergymen to the country, leading to renewed interest in its forgotten, ancient ruins. Archaeology from the Air, the ongoing exhibition of photographs, has a selection of the best-known and most interesting archaeological sites as seen from an aerial view. The photographs offer significant insights into the civilization and culture of a period in history that has changed the destiny of a large part of the human race. Captured by Duby Tal and Moni Haramati, two former Israeli Air Force pilots who now specialise in commercial and artistic photography, the photographs provide an excellent opportunity to view the sites in their natural geographical setting.

 A moment from The Ant 

 Bully; (below) Tom Hanks

 From Academy Award nominated film-maker John A. Davis (Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius) and producers Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman (The Polar Express), The Ant Bully tells the witty and heartwarming tale of a 10-year-old boy who embarks on a remarkable journey. New in town, friendless and tormented by a neighbourhood bully, young Lucas Nickle has been taking out his frustration on the innocent ant hill in his yard. But one day the ants retaliate. This is what producer TOM HANKS has to say.

 How did you end up producing this project?

 This is a project that started off rather simply when my son checked a book out of the kindergarten library about five years ago and brought it home and read it, and before we were done we realised it would make a very delightful movie.

 John Nickle is the author, and as you can see by the sticker applied to most of the books, its now a major motion picture, and Im reading it from the book.

 What kind of commitment did the actors make to the project?

 Its a long process that these actors made, over five years, to make a full-length version of the book. These people may have had little screen time, but they had to come back again and again and again, and that commitment was important. They had the drive and wherewithal to come back each time and do more recordings.

 How did you get to director John A. Davis?

 I took my son to the Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius movie (directed by Davis) and liked it and thought John would be perfect to do it, and handed the book over to John.

 What were the changes made from the book?

 The story is very simple. We added a little more to what was there the ant colony, water hitting it, and that was it. The boy would get shrunken and would eventually get back. He grows again, and that was it. Everything else was up for grabs, but just that was enough to show to John, who was just coming out with Jimmy Neutron, and in fact I just took my son to that movie that weekend and handed the book over to John and said, What do you think?

 Why didnt you do a voice in this movie?

 I didnt have time to do the recording. If I had time to record it I would have been Ant Number 46. I had a pretty full schedule during this time.

 How did you get this high calibre of actors involved?

 The Oscar-calibre cast gathered for this had no trick to it. You just offer it and send them the book and now its been done quite a lot and you dont have a terrible time. Theres no make-up, no costumes. We went to Julias (Roberts) house in Taos, in New Mexico, where else?

 Did you give them any advice, Tom, after playing Woody the 

 cowboy in Toy Story?

 Its not easy, its quite a workout 

 for you as an actor. It tests your chops, its like a laboratory 

 atmosphere. You can cut loose in a way that you dont get 

 to do in a regular movie.

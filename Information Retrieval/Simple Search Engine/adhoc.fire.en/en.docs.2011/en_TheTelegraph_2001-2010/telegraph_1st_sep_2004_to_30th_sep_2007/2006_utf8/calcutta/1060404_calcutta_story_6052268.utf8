 A cricket crusade 

Bowled over, turned better

 The headmaster of a well-known British public school, whose boys played a cricket match against Don Bosco Calcutta on Monday, is so impressed with the educational standards and the generally impeccable behaviour he has found in this country that he is determined to offer assisted places to bright pupils from modest backgrounds in India.

 Peter Armstrong, headmaster of Worth School, in West Sussex, is accompanying his cricket team whose coach is, ironically, Raj Chaudhuri, a former Don Bosco pupil who once played Ranji Trophy for Tripura (his loyalties were today definitely with Worth).

 From the sidelines, Armstrong kept breaking off from his interview with The Telegraph to offer encouragement to his boys.

 ?Hang in there, Ed, dig in, Ed,? he said to his 17-year-old son, Edward, who batted beautifully for a while.

 For the record, Indian hospitality did not extend to allowing the visitors to win. Don Bosco scored 290 in 30 overs and bowled out Worth for 179. 

 His boys have performed brilliantly, however, on the cricket field. 

 Before coming to Calcutta, they were in Bangalore, where Worth beat four Indian establishments ? Frank Anthony, International School Bangalore, Jain International School and Lawrence School Ooty ? to take the trophy.

 Armstrong is in India to investigate whether there are parents rich and ambitious enough to spend ? 21,000 a year on sending their sons to his public school in England. A few have met him.

 However, having come to India, his perspective and values have altered fundamentally. Although he has met a number of prospective parents, he realises that ? 21,000 a year is outside the reach of the vast majority of Indian parents.

 Armstrong admitted: ??21,000 is outside the reach of most parents in Britain. English public schools are too exclusive, meaning they exclude too many people.?

 The Worth boys took time off on Sunday to visit a home for destitute children in Calcutta. ?This was the most profound experience they have had in their lives,? commented Armstrong, who is here with his wife. ?They realise how privileged they are, as are the boys from Don Bosco.?

 Meeting Indian boys took him back to a time in England when there was respect for elders. ?It is almost being in a time warp in the best possible sense,? he said.

 ?In some ways, the Indians are more British than the British,? he remarked, adding he meant this to be taken as a compliment. ?Their perfect manners and bearing hark back to a bygone age in England. They show respect to adults because they are adults. They show respect to teachers. It is astonishing, but the boys I have met speak better English ? beautiful English ? than people in England.?

 The Worth boys return home on Tuesday changed for the better, their headmaster feels. 

 He goes back a day later, resolved to find scholarship funds to help promising boys from families with limited means. Ideally, he would like to discover a future Test cricketer from a Calcutta slum.

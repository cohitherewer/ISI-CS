The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A mayor must have a dream

 HARD TALK 

 : Lake Area (1)

 Subrata mukherjee, former 

 mayor and present councillor of ward 87, met readers of 

 The Telegraph. Participants included Kamal Hazra, Swapan 

 Dasgupta, Sonali Ghosh, Uttam Mondol, Arka Bose, Ramen Pandey 

 and Nandita Banerjee

 Kamal Hazra: We are very thankful to you for the pumping 

 station on Southern Avenue. For the first time, we did not 

 have to shift our dining table to the bed and could easily 

 move around after the heavy showers last week.

 If we were elected for one more 

 term, I could have solved the waterlogging problem in every 

 pocket of the city. The present civic board should not take 

 the credit that this time Panchanantala and Southern Avenue 

 didn?t have water accumulating on the streets.

 During my first term, my aim was 

 to improve the drinking water supply. In the second term, 

 I wanted to improve the drainage and sewerage system.

 Swapan Dasgupta: The rain was not unusually heavy on July 

 11, July 13 and July 19 this year. But why were the main 

 thoroughfares under water despite 19 pumping stations commissioned 

 into service? Shouldn?t the civic body have done something 

 about this?

 You must know that the total rainfall 

 in a day is not related to the waterlogging in an area. 

 Waterlogging depends on the intensity of rain per hour. 

 I can show you that rainfall per day in July 2002 was higher 

 than this year?s. But the waterlogging was not as bad. We 

 had chalked out a proper plan to meet the crisis.

 Presently, at least 25 pumping 

 stations are needed to pump out water from the city. I added 

 two at Southern Avenue and Kalighat during my tenure. The 

 present board should also take steps in this regard.

 Sonali Ghosh: You claim to have been a successful mayor 

 and the present mayor is not. What, according to you, are 

 his shortcomings?

 The present mayor, Bikash Ranjan 

 Bhattacharyya, is a good and sensible person. But his main 

 problem, like any other communist, is that he doesn?t have 

 a dream or an aim. Unless you have a realistic dream to 

 achieve, you can never succeed in life.

 My dream was to bring Calcutta 

 up to international standards. During my term, I stressed 

 on achieving self-sufficiency in the production and supply 

 of filtered surface water.

 That effort is coming to fruition 

 with New Palta, which was inaugurated by chief minister 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee recently. 

 Several other booster pumping 

 stations are also becoming operational in different parts 

 of the city.

 Uttam Mondol: I think it would be incorrect to say that 

 the present mayor has no aim or dream. We have read in the 

 newspapers that his aim is to improve the slums. 

 Who told you I did not do anything 

 for the slum areas? I have already fulfilled the four basic 

 needs ? potable water, street lights, pucca roads and toilets. 

 At the most, Bhattacharyya can 

 offer them more standpipes, which would lead to a fall in 

 the pressure of the water supplied to the houses in the 

 neighbourhood.

 Arka Bose: Why did you neglect the interest of the middle 

 class and the poor in the city in respect of civic development?

 What do you mean by neglecting 

 the interest of the middle class and poor people? A mayor?s 

 primary duty is to improve the quality of civic services 

 and the overall standard of the city. He is for everyone 

 ? rich or poor.

 Do you think the improvement in 

 the water supply situation, the pay-and-use toilets, the 

 street lights and clean pavements are only for the rich 

 people? Have we ever restricted the poor from using these?

 Ramen Pandey: Why do some people say that you were a successful 

 mayor for the rich people only? You have also worked for 

 the poor.

 The CPM leaders have such an opinion. 

 If you go by the records, I have carried out the maximum 

 number of development activities in the slum areas. I have 

 changed the name of the department of bustee development 

 to Nagar Pally Unnayan department.

 The CPM is now popularising a 

 slogan ?bustee rekhe busteer unnayan? (improve the 

 slums but do not do away with them). What does the CPM mean 

 by such a slogan? 

 It implies that the CPM wants 

 to keep the poor in the slums forever. Because they know 

 that if the slum-dwellers are given individual apartments, 

 they would lose their strong votebank.

 Clean drains key to prevent waterlogging

 Nandita Banerjee: As you were the mayor, can you tell us 

 why the Calcutta Municipal Corportation (CMC) has failed 

 to tackle the waterlogging problem in the city? 

 Calcuttas topography is like a saucer. Every drop 

 of water on the surface has to be pumped out. At present, 

 we have 19 pumping stations at different pockets to solve 

 our purpose. The drainage and sewers should be cleared, 

 so that the water can flow down to the pumping stations 

 easily. Precautionary measures, like pump repair and other 

 measures, should be taken beforehand. I am being informed 

 that neither were the pumps repaired nor the drains de-silted 

 before the monsoon. The de-silting process is a round-the-year 

 process, therefore de-silting sewers and drains two orthree 

 months before the rainy season wont help. A proper 

 plan should be chalked out.

 To be concluded

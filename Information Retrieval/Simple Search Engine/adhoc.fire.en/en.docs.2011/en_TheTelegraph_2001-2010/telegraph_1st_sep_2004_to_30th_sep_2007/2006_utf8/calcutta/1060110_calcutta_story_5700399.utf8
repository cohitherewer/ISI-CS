The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Campus impasse continues

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Academic activities were disrupted at Presidency College on Monday, with the unrest over the students? union election results continuing for the fourth day.

 Monday saw processions, slogan-shouting and an altercation over the possession of the union room on the campus. Students stayed away from classes. 

 A large police contingent was deployed in the college, while officials held marathon meetings to resolve the dispute.

 The tribunal of the college overseeing the elections ordered an inquiry into the 37-37 tie for the assistant general secretary?s post. A re-poll had been ordered on Friday after declaration of the results.

 It has been decided that the post will remain vacant till completion of the inquiry, a senior teacher, who is a member of the tribunal, said after a meeting.

 The inquiry was ordered following a demand of the Students? Federation of India (SFI). The students? wing of the CPM wanted a re-poll for all the 11 office-bearer posts, an investigation into the 37-37 tie for the assistant general secretary?s post ? since only 73 students had voted ? and a bar on the new office-bearers assuming charge.

 There was tension on the campus in the morning after a large number of SFI supporters entered the union room and allegedly denied entry to members of the Independent Consolidation (IC) and Progressive Democratic Students? Federation (PDSF) combine, which had won the poll.

 The students owing allegiance to IC and PDSF assembled in front of the room and started shouting slogans. 

 Fearing violence, a huge contingent of police was called to the campus and deployed outside the room around 3 pm. 

 Representatives of the winning combine entered the union room in the presence of the police. 

 ?This kind of an incident ? students entering the union room in the presence of a police contingent ? is unheard of in the recent history of the college,? lamented a senior teacher of the college.

 Mamata Roy, principal, was not available for comment.

 Noted classical guitarist Roger Zimmermann has been in town for a few days, teaching at the Calcutta School of Music. A few days spent with guitar pupils culminated in a recital on Tuesday night at Sandre Hall, at the Ballygunge school. 

 The performance was an accurate reflection of Zimmermann?s tastes, featuring an eclectic selection of European pieces ranging from the 16th Century to the present day. 

 ?In order to appreciate the music of the present, one has to understand the past,? he said, explaining his choices for a programme that included pieces by Fernando Sor, Joaquin Turina, Agostin Barrios, Enrique Granados and Leo Brouwer. 

 Zimmerman hails from a small village in central Germany, or as he puts it, ?the middle of nowhere?. At age 10, he decided to take up the guitar. At first, he played the electric guitar as accompaniment in a rock band. 

 But as he grew older and more experienced as a guitarist, his taste became more sophisticated. The classical guitar proved to be his calling, with the works of Pepe Romero exerting a strong influence on the young Zimmerman. ?I found the melodies of the classical guitar much more satisfying than playing in contemporary styles.? 

 Although having visited Calcutta three times in the past, Zimmerman ?regrets not having had time to see much of the city this time. For most of this stay, I have seen just these four walls (referring to the practice room).? 

 Zimmerman is very positive about the pupils he has taught in Calcutta. ?They are very enthusiastic with a great attitude, but the facilities are not good enough for the guitar here. New guitars are needed. Some of the strings are as old as the pupils! A lot of the pupils have a great feel for the music, but they are not being given a chance to capitalise on that. There is a big gap between talent and realised potential? he said. 

 The German musician also felt that ?the pupils here have a lot to gain from studying the guitar. At the moment, the teaching and facilities are good only in Indian music. Of the western instruments, the piano is probably the best taught and provided for, but there is not always a great deal of attention paid to instruments such as the guitar. The educational possibilities are enormous here, but not fulfilled. There are some guitar teachers, but not enough. ?

 Zimmerman has performed and taught around the world, from places with a strong guitar tradition, such as Bolivia in South America, which Zimmerman called ?simply amazing, I learnt a lot there?, to Namibia, (incidentally home to a considerable German population) and South Africa. 

 The standard has been mixed wherever he has gone, with Zimmerman describing Africa as a ?cultural desert for the classical guitar?.

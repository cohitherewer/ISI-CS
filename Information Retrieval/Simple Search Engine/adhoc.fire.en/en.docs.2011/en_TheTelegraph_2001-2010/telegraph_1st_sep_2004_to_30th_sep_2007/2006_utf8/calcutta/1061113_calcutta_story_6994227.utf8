The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Illegal construction spells boom at port

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Following a drive against unauthorised construction, police and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials have ended up playing a game of hide-and-seek with criminals-turned-promoters in the port area. 

 The zone has witnessed a realty boom and over 250 illegal constructions have sprung up in the past 18 months. The racket is thriving and almost anyone can try his hand in the flourishing business.

 A criminal-turned-promoter told Metro that middlemen play a vital role in the deals. We approach the middlemen who know officers of the local thana. After a couple of days, we are asked to visit the police station and show the agreement with the landlord. They ask for information about the site where the construction is supposed to begin. Later, the middlemen inform us how much money is to be paid to the cops. This year, the rate is Rs 1 lakh per floor, he stated.

 If the cops know the promoter, he can pay the sum in instalments. The local councillor and officials of the building department also get their cut, another promoter said.

 Officers of Watgunge, Ekbalpore and South Port police stations claimed that a constable is deployed at each site to prevent illegal constructions. 

 What can we do if they work at night after our constables leave? asked Watgunge police station officer-in-charge K. Sarkar. He refused to say why there is no police posting at night.

 Deputy commissioner (port) Rajiv Mishra said policemen involved in the racket would be punished stringently. We have arrested over 100 people involved in illegal constructions over the past two years. The CMC will soon start a demolition drive and we will provide assistance, he added.

 There is resentment among the local residents regarding the racket, as promoters force them to hand over their land. The residents have written to the deputy commissioner, asking him to take action against illegal activities.

 Policemen as well as the civic officials are minting money. They are hand-in-glove with the criminals of the area, who have now turned promoters, alleged a landlord.

 By day, Ekbalpore and Watgunge police stations post a constable each at sites where illegal constructions are taking place. At night, the work continues unhindered. I wonder how illegal buildings can come up under the policemens noses, he rued.

 High school teacher Abdur Rahman said: Even promoters from other parts of the city are investing here and police are providing them protection from local hoodlums. The increase in illegal constructions in the area means good business for everyone.

 Criminals from other parts of the country, including Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, took shelter in the area and invested money in the real estate business. This had come to light with the arrest of Ismail Khan, member of a J amp;K terrorist outfit, from Garden Reach about one-and-a-half-years ago.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: Its strange that illegal constructions are still going on in the port area. We have set up a team which will work with police to crackdown on unauthorised constructions.

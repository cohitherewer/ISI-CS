 Break barriers, build bonds

 With an aim to breaking social 

 barriers and making a difference in the lives of slum-dwellers 

 near Subhas Sarovar, around 60 youngsters under the banner 

 of Art of Living have taken up a project in the area. Our 

 plan is to clean up the area opposite Swabhumi, bit by bit, 

 and organise educational and recreational activities for 

 underprivileged children in the area. Rotaract Midtown is 

 a partner in our endeavour.

 Our Seva project began on May 13. We persuaded kids from the bustee to join us in cleaning up the area, which was divided into four zones ? north, south, east and west. Over 30 children worked in each zone. On May 28, we finished clearing up a small fenced-off plot along the lake. It took us four hours of three consecutive Sunday mornings to complete the work. After every clean-up session, we distributed biscuits and toffees among the kids and put up a small song-and-dance programme to entertain them.

 We are now planning to hold regular sessions with various educational and recreational activities for the children in the locality.

 Initially, the response of the slum-dwellers to our project was very muted. It took a month of frequent interactions with the women and children to convince them of our intentions.

 One big achievement was that during the last clean-up session, some grown-ups from the slums came to watch us work. They didn?t help us, but I am sure the inclination to do so has already taken root in their hearts. They are bound to take up the broom and join us some day.

 When we see the smile on the children?s faces, we are convinced that we are moving in the right direction. The project has just begun and we have a lot more to do. And we need more youngsters to join us to help in our project. Those interested can call Shilpa at 9830996889 or Ashish at 9830601206.

 Caesar spoof

 May 12 saw a very different version of Shakespeare?s Julius Caesar at Don Bosco, Bandel. Directed and performed by a group of high-school students, the play made us think differently.

 Scripted by a student, The Caesarian Chicken was a parody that introspected on the true nature of people, how they try to be what they are not. It was quite a mental exercise for those in the audience. What if Caesar had not been murdered? What if Brutus was the main manipulator, Cassius just an ally and Antony the betrayer?

 Substituting a chicken for Caesar, who gets murdered by Cassius and kidnapped by Antony, the play proved to be a complete entertainer, but with a sting. It was not a comedy, but a mellowed-down take on the human psyche.

 ?We all know these characters and so can easily relate to them,? says the team of eight that was guided by the school?s English teachers Shanta Ghosh and Roslene Gomes.

 While the funny dialogues and expressions left the juniors in splits, the message went down very well with the seniors and the teachers. Overall, The Caesarian Chicken was a treat with its Roman costumes and period props.

Potter whiz

 Students of Calcutta University had the opportunity to meet Harry Potter?s ?godmother? and co-founder of Bloomsbury Publishers, Liz Calder, on May 24.

 In an interactive session organised by the department of book publishing at CU, Calder told the students not only of her journey from the world of modelling to book publishing, but also about the story behind the discovery of the boy wizard.

 Reading from Blue Pencils at Dawn: My Life in Publishing, Calder traced her life from her first job with Gollancz in the 70s to forming Bloomsbury. 

 She attributed the success of Harry Potter to ?well co-ordinated marketing and word of mouth publicity?. However, Potter fans were disheartened to hear that there was going to be only one more book in the series.

 My Grave

 Dig my grave deep, 

 under the soil of globalisation.

 Where freedom gets mocked,

 and rights get silenced.

 Death couldn?t scare me, but life did.

 Where some bathe in the variegated night life,

 others suffer in the curse of fate.

 I choose to die.

 Dig my fossil a century later,

 in a world of no acid rain,

 Or the expiry of Pseudo hopes,

 Just to be buried all over again.

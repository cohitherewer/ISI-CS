Life

 Living it up on the floor

 Dancing ? undoubtedly one of the most free-spirited forms of self-expression ? faces some serious issues on the dance floor. Think about it: a one, two, three followed by an Oops sorry! The next set begins almost immediately but meets the same sad fate. So is it just about going through the motions and the action replays?

 Lack of space, lack of synchronisation or lack of sheer etiquette ? whatever the reason, nightclub dancing can leave any pair of twinkle toes crushed. 

 Performing on stage is another game altogether. Also, dancing in the classroom, explains salsa expert Aditya Upadhyay, is routine oriented, involving numerous permutations and combinations of the same basic steps.

 Cut to real time action, on the nightclub floor, and the dancing is purely about cool moves and immense styling, adds Aditya. Everyone wishes to stand out while dancing in a nightclub.

 Heres the GoodLife guide to help you go footloose in the crowded club, to make most of your tiny bit of space on a packed floor, while enjoying those few minutes of hyperactive fame.

 Do

 Incorporate some filmi signature steps into your dance moves. Not only will you be an unlikely avatar of everyones screen god/goddess but will also end up having great fun.

 Popular signature steps have the entire floor rocking in a perfectly synchronised routine in no time, bonding revellers all the way. 

 Its also easy to pick up trademark steps since they are shown on the television at least 20 times a day. So just be aware and youll be moving the crowd with you, suggests dance instructor Vishal Kanoi.

 Take smaller steps on the dance floor, advises Aditya. This way, you are showcasing every bit of your grooving talent and at the same time not bumping into all and sundry. 

 Stretched-out movements look good only on screen or on a large-scale performance, adds Aditya.

 Mix and match your steps when on the cramped floor. Dont make the blunder of sticking to that one routine that you picked up way back in school. Let go of your inhibitions and warm it up as you go along with the music. Shout, jump, squat? spontaneity is the key.

 Attitude is the buzzword under those disco lights. Think cool and people will follow suit. Develop your own attitude and style. Add a body wave or even a hint of a caress, suggests Aditya.

 If any of this seems tough, learn from Abhishek Bachchan who is getting better with his movements by the day. Compare his gawky steps from the Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya days to the cool moves from Bluffmaster!. If he can do it, so can you. 

 Learn the basics of popular dance forms. Its great fun to do a quick jive or a salsa number when the clubs go into retro or Latino groove.

 Be aware of the kind of crowd around. Your dancing is bound to be different if there are lots of aunties around. Likewise, the cool quotient is at another level if there are only friends around, says Vishal.

 Dont

 Never dance all over the place. Nightclub jiving is definitely about freestyle dancing, but its always advisable to stay within a semi-confined area, says Aditya.

 A lit cigarette is a no-no as a companion on the dance floor, however much of a man it makes you feel. Space is always a jam and so if you have to burn the floor, do it with a step not a stick.

 The same goes for your drink, especially if its topped up. Even if you are careful while moving and shaking, theres no guarantee that your dancing neighbours will follow suit. You wouldnt then want to spend your evening apologising for the outfits you end up ruining.

 Dont mix up various genres of music and dance. If the music is hip-hop, then try and introduce a few moves meant for the genre. Your filmi jhatkas just wont gel with the music, warns Vishal.

 And finally, dont put yourself into straitjacket on the dance floor; the idea is to let your hair down and have some fun your own way.

 Dancing is always about expressing yourself, so let yourself loose while you feel the music, smiles Vishal.

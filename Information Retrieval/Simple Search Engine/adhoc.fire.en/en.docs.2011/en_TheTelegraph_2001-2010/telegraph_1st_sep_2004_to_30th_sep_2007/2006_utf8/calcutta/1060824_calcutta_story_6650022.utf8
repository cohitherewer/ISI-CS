 Whos the finest 

 of them all...

 Screen On amp; Off

 KISHORE NAMIT KAPOOR passed out from 

 FTII in 1972 and took to teaching. Of the present crop of 

 stars, he has groomed most, from Hrithik to Kareena. He gives 

 Sudeshna Banerjee a lowdown on the ones he taught and 

 the ones he didnt

 Kishore Namit Kapoor 

 On Amitabh Bachchan

 He was on a comfortable bus all 

 these years an unsophisticated villager to a don. Its 

 only now that he is doing more challenging roles.

 He is a master of time management. 

 People take two days to acclimatise in Leh-Ladakh; he would 

 fly back to Mumbai in between shooting at Ladakh, attend 

 some brand endorsement programme and give his shot the next 

 day. He must have sold everything except sanitary napkins! 

 Then he gets up at dawn for an hour-and-a-halfs workout. 

 At this age! And he says he feels insecure about his sons 

 future. 

 On Hrithik Roshan

 Hrithik was dubla, patla, 

 stammered a lot... People had asked him to forget about 

 a career in acting. But such was his commitment! Only once 

 had he missed a class and the next day he kept asking, Sir, 

 hum ne kya miss kiya? In fact, he had enrolled me, 

 rather than me enrolling him!

 He is our first complete actor 

 (Amitabh was not handsome in the traditional sense). Hrithik 

 came to me on the sly. His family didnt know. Towards the 

 end of the course, we did (Harold Pinters play) The 

 Caretaker for a video project. He played a creative 

 person who had lost his memory and was hallucinating. He 

 took the cassette and hesitantly showed it to his mother. 

 His mother stole the cassette and showed it to Rakesh Roshan 

 at night. At 2 am, I got a call from him saying Beta 

 to janam liya tha bahut din pehle. Today a star is born. 

 Thank you. Even today, he rehearses for six hours for a 

 two-minute ad film.

 When my book was launched Hrithik 

 not only came but also left instructions that whoever wanted 

 to buy the book and could not pay, he would pick up the 

 tab as he believed it should be read by all students of 

 cinema.

 On Akshaye Khanna

 Akshaye had his mood swings. One 

 day, he would touch your feet and hug you. On another, he 

 would just look through you. With all the problems of Vinod 

 Khanna, Osho, divorce and America, you cannot blame him. 

 There would be times when he would crouch in a corner with 

 his face between his knees. Nothing would reach him then. 

 But that boy has amazing sense of realism; hes a complete 

 natural. Too bad our films dont recognise that. On his 

 day he is so good that no one can touch him. 

 On Saif Ali Khan

 Saif was sent to me by Rahul Rawail 

 for a film he had signed him for. He had no idea what to 

 do in life acting, cricket ya aur kuch. He had 

 amazing excuses low BP, he was sinking, he needed rest 

 But he was very articulate... He would urge me to do therapeutic 

 hypnotism on him to relieve stress. Later, I realised it 

 was his excuse to sleep for five-six hours. Liars are actors 

 but actors should not be liars. When he would not show up 

 for days, I called up the family he was putting up with 

 and heard he wasnt even coming home at night. Then suddenly 

 I would spot him the next day taking diction classes downstairs, 

 as he was too scared to come up and face me. Rahul had to 

 replace him after two days of shooting!

 The industry has taught him. I 

 take no credit. Look at him in Omkara. What conviction! 

 Who would say he used to be such an average actor?

 On Salman Khan

 Kaash woh mehnat karta. 

 He actually thinks that what he does on the spur of the 

 moment is natural acting. Set pe jao, dialogue do, 

 jab tak lighting ho jayega, woh ready. 

 Its only when he is pitted against someone, he works. This 

 is something I heard There was this scene in Karan Arjun 

 where Shah Rukh and he are in the mud. It was Gauris 

 birthday so Shah Rukh was a day late in reaching. Salmans 

 shot had been taken. He was so conscious about looking good 

 that after every take he was wiping himself clean. Then 

 he saw Shah Rukh the next day diving in the mud without 

 a care. He looked so natural that Salman got insecure and 

 went up to Rakesh (Roshan) to let him take his shots again.

 On Shah Rukh Khan

 He is a bundle of energy, but 

 where is his range? He is more a star than an actor. He 

 may be a bigger actor than we know but where are the roles 

 to bring that out?

 On Kamal Haasan

 He is a textbook for actors. He 

 keeps evolving. He was brilliant in Sagar yet he 

 says today he would do Sagar differently.

 On Aamir Khan

 He is a role model. He discusses 

 a shot for six hours and acts for two. If he does two films 

 a year, they would be diametrically opposite roles. But 

 I did not like the fact that he actually got drunk for a 

 song in Raja Hindusthani. Kal agar marna hain, 

 to poison lenge kya? Thats not acting. Again, in Ghulam 

 he ran towards a train coming at him. The camera was 

 on a variable motor. Everyone on the set was shouting, Jump, 

 Aamir, jump. When he jumped, there were exactly 24 frames 

 left. So a second late and he would have crashed. The scenes 

 could have been extrapolated? He has sent his nephew Imran 

 to me. Perhaps he recognises some need for training today.

 On Govinda

 Such a fantastic dancer and such 

 a lazy man. For an evening shot, he reached at 2 am. By 

 then, Raveena (Tandon) had given her shot and gone. He even 

 missed a flight the other day when he was supposed to meet 

 Sonia Gandhi. But he does superb improvisations. David (Dhawan) 

 says saale ko main pehle se scene nahin deta 

 tha. He improvises so well that he was far better than 

 Amitabh when they acted together.

 On Kareena Kapoor

 Kareena was shy, you had to coax 

 her a lot. That has changed. Today she almost has an attitude 

 problem. Just because she did Chameli, there was 

 so much hue and cry. But she hadnt done the minimum research 

 for the role go to a chawl, watch how they (prostitutes) 

 stand, talk See Pakeezah and youll know what I 

 mean.

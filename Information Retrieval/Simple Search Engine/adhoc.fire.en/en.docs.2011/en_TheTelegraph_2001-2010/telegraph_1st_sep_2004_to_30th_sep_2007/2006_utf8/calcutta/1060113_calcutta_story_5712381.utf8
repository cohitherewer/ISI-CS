 Helping underprivileged children secure a better future, Prayasam, an NGO, works towards nurturing, training and equipping them to join the social mainstream when they become adults. Crayon?s Cry, a project conducted by Prayasam in the 38 National Child Labour Project schools of north 24 Parganas over the last three months, endeavours to impart vocational training to its students through a series of drawing and art-activity sessions, at the same time allowing them to discover and express their latent creative talents. Showcasing the works done by them during the course of the project, Crayon?s Cry, the exhibition, also provides a platform where they can interact and share their ideas and aspirations with their more fortunate counterparts. Divided into segments like ekjot (collective paintings and collages), icchedana (student?s bulletin), bayoscope (depiction of scenes from popular films), hathekhori (clay models and hand-made artifacts) and others, it provides the children full freedom to explore their varied artistic potential.

Zeal powers rise above poverty

 Ambition has wings that spread far, soaring above all constraints. Or, how else could one explain the quest of a 15-year-old girl from an underprivileged family in the interiors of Howrah to be a gymnast of international repute?

 Meet Priyanka Pradhan, daughter of a fish-seller, who has been striding steadily towards her goal, successfully representing the state in junior-level gymnastic tournaments across the country.

 Being in gymnastics since age six, she has also been a regular in meets organised by the School Games Federation of India for the past several years.

 Neither talent nor zeal, but money is the only obstacle in Priyanka?s way to success. Father Basudeb?s income is too meagre to support the family of five. ?We cannot provide her the nourishment she requires,? says Basudeb.

 The family?s financial state can, perhaps, be gauged from its one-room shack on Carrie Road ? not big enough even to house the medals and trophies Priyanka has won.

 The family had never thought that Priyanka would take to gymnastics. ?She loved sport since her childhood, but keeping our financial condition in mind, we never thought that she could pursue any discipline,? says mother Minu. 

 ?It?s her uncle who convinced us to send her to Batore Byayam Samity in the locality, where his children also practised. She took to the bars like a fish takes to water. She has excelled in every sphere and we are now all pinning all our hopes on her,? Minu adds, proud of her daughter?s feat. 

 Three years ago, the Sports Authority of India took Priyanka under its wings and since then, she has been staying in a hostel at the Salt Lake stadium. Her school has been supportive in allowing her to attend the practice sessions. ?I still try to go to school once a week, when my practice gives over early,? says Priyanka.

 Though she does not idolise any celebrity sportsperson, the girl ? who has earned a name for herself in parallel bars, balancing bars, uneven bars, vaulting bars and floor stretch ? looks up to her senior Rakhi Debnath, currently representing India at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games.

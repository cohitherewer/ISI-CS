 How to seal a deal while you chill 

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 l play and no work makes for a 

 dull nightclub. Thats precisely why the buzzing bars 

 and lazy lounges around town are not just about grooving 

 and sipping.

 Serious party people and some not-so-serious party people get together, very happily, all under one roof for that night of fun. But while some are busy taking the decibel limits to an all-new high, fun for the quieter ones means striking a quick business deal or two. 

 We get a lot of corporate bookings for business dealings these days at Roxy. In such cases, we also offer them a table upstairs along with an extended table for their presentations, etc. Someplace Else, on the other hand, is a great place to chill or socialise post-meeting, reveals Anirban Simlai, F amp;B manager at The Park.

 While talking shop at a night spot is in, the way to do it is to blend it smoothly with the fun feel of the place.

 So, heres a GoodLife guide to help you crack that deal, but in nightclub style.

 Do

 Take advantage of the 

 happy and relaxed ambience. A nightclub is essentially 

 a happy-go-lucky place where you can end up getting lucky 

 not only with girls but also with some important business 

 people, smiles party regular Dhiraj Sahni. As the 

 logic goes, happy, de-stressed people make better deals 

 than grumpy, stressed-out souls.

 Take the opportunity to 

 introduce yourself to people you have always wanted to network 

 with, but never could. A bar is a great place for informal 

 introductions. After two drinks and a hookah, many people 

 dont mind being approached.

 Time your meeting right. 

 Catch up with business associates before 10 pm. Peak 

 hours are a very bad idea because a crowded scene kills 

 the potential, says DJ Girish of Shisha. Simlai agrees: 

 The music is also soft during the early hours.

 Dress well. Just because 

 you might end up discussing work doesnt mean that 

 youll hop over in the white shirt and striped tie 

 combo. But also steer clear of the super-jazzy printed number.

 Watch yourself and those 

 around you. You never know, your future boss could 

 be standing right next to you, keeping an eye on you, 

 says Dhiraj. 

 Order non-messy food, 

 advises Simlai. Open samosas or a Lebanese 

 platter is a great idea, since these snacks dont need 

 cumbersome napkins or concentration, he feels. So, 

 while settling down with a couple of drinks during the meeting, 

 keep the snack menu short and simple.

 Brief the nightclub management 

 about your meeting beforehand. The result will be 

 special service to impress your clients, smiles Girish. 

 Dont

 Talk only business. Remember 

 that it has been a long week and nobody wants to just talk 

 work. Its always good to talk business or discuss 

 ideas and concepts with someone new, but without revealing 

 too much, advises Dhiraj. So, treat nightclub networking 

 as a great start, as the means to an end.

 Girish feels discussions 

 on your associates favourite wine will surely improve 

 your chances.

 Ask the nightclub management 

 to tone the music down to suit your work needs. After all, 

 playing party pooper in a place where most people are out 

 to have fun is a no-no.

 Get your client drunk. 

 This may end up jeopardising everything ? the morning 

 after, laughs Girish.

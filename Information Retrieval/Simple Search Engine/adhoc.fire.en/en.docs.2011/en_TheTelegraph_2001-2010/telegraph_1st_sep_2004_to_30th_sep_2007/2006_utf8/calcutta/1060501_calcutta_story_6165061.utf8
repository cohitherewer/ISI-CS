 Swapan Saha, CPM councillor of ward 14 of the Left-controlled Dum Dum municipality, along with his aides, vandalised the house of Saraswati Sinha and allegedly beat up her teenaged son and daughter at Kalidham on Saturday. The cause: the Sinhas had refused to hand over a portion of their land to set up a club.

 According to police, about 500 CPM activists, led by Saha, even assaulted half-a-dozen policemen when they reached the spot after getting an SOS from the Sinha family.

 ?Outnumbered, we were manhandled by Saha?s men who had vandalised Saraswati?s house and assaulted her son Somnath and daughter Runu,? an officer of Dum Dum police station said on Sunday.

 Amitava Bose, CPM district secretary of North 24-Parganas, said he was unaware of the incident. ?However, I will look into the matter and action will be taken against our party councillor if he is involved,? he added.

 Trouble started around 9 pm on Friday when Maya Majumdar, an activist of the local Mahila Samity, the CPM?s women?s wing, picked a quarrel with Saraswati when she heard her abusing Runu. 

 Maya mistakenly felt that Saraswati was abusing her.

 ?Maya informed Saha, who arrived with his goons. They had been threatening us for a long time to part with a piece of our land or face dire consequences. They wanted to build a club on the land,? Saraswati said.

 Runu, who received injuries in her head, is yet to recover from the shock. ?When my mother rejected their demand, Saha got infuriated. This was their excuse for vandalising our house for the next few hours. Saha and his associates ransacked the house and even smashed the tiled roof. As we tried to resist, they first beat up my mother and brother. I was busy trying to save our possessions when they attacked me,? she said, blood still trickling down from the injuries in her head.

 When Runu and Somnath went to Dum Dum police station to lodge a complaint, officer-in-charge Salil Bhattacharya refused to register it. 

 When they insisted, the officer charged Somnath with rape and put him behind bars.

 Councillor Saha admitted that the house was ransacked because his cadre needed land to build a club. 

 Officer-in-charge Bhattacharya tried to play it down as a ?minor incident? on Saturday. 

 Later in the day, a case was registered against the councillor and four of his men at district superintendent Praveen Kumar?s instance. Saraswati?s son Somnath was released.

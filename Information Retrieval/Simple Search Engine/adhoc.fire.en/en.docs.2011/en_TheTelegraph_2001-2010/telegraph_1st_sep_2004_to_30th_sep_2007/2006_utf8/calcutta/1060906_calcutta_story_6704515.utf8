The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Murder sentence upheld

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 A division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice A.K. Basu and Justice T. Giri, on Tuesday upheld a judgment by the city sessions court sentencing five men to life imprisonment for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old Anurag Agarwal in October 1988.

 In December 1991, city sessions court judge D.P. Sircar had convicted Debasish Banerjee, Bijon Barua, Pallab Mukherjee, Gopal Sardar and Ashok Roy on the charges of kidnapping Anurag, a resident of south Calcutta, and killing him. The convicts, except Bijon, had been granted bail by the high court after they spent 11 years behind bars. On Tuesday, the high court asked the four to surrender before the trial court within 15 days.

 The incident had created a stir in the city. Investigation had revealed that the kidnappers had killed Anurag the day after he was kidnapped and had dumped the body in the Hooghly in a gunny bag. The body could not be found. The five men had admitted to the kidnap and murder in court.

 The case diary had said that the men had abducted Anurag on his way to school. They had demanded a ransom of Rs 1 lakh from the boys grandfather Devi Lal Agarwal, a senior executive in a private firm.

 On October 15, 1988, the Agarwals had paid Rs 80,000 to the abductors, but they had asked for at least Rs 5,000 more to release the boy. The cops had caught Debasish Banerjee on November 4, 1988, near the Kalighat temple by laying a trap. It was found that the ransom was collected after Anurag had been killed.

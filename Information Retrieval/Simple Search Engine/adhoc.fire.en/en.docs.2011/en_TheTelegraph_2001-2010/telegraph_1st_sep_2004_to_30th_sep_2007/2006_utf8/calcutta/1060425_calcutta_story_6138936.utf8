 Over 3,000 different potential occupations are available to graduates these days, so finding the right career is becoming an ever more daunting task. 

 Walking through the sea of stalls at the 15th Career Fair, organised by Afairs at Ice Skating Rink from 22 to 24 April, proved intimidating for even the most eager graduate. 

 The aim of the fair was to help students explore the possible career options, ranging from favourites like management, IT and medicine, to more artistic jobs, like digital film-making, jewellery design and interior design. 

 But most students had only a very vague idea of what they wanted. ?MBA, IT, medicine, etc, are the most popular choices, but about 85 per cent of the visitors are not sure of what they want,? said Sheikh Fazal Mohammed of Jetking, a computer hardware and networking institute that has just opened a branch in Calcutta.

 On Sunday afternoon, the Digital Asia School of animation stall was just as crowded as the one offering MBBS options in China. 

 ?There is actually a huge job market out there, so lots of institutes are offering 100 per cent job guarantees,? added Anil Rawat, director, Institute of Business Management and Technology, Bangalore.

 To assist the youngsters was leading career counsellor Pervin Malhotra. In two interactive talks on April 23 and 24, Malhotra gave talks on Career Options After Class XII and Career Options After Graduation. In the Q amp;A sessions, the career hunters pitched their questions and worries.

 According to Malhotra, young Indians ?need not be afraid of anything,? and she urged them ?not to be saddled with the beggar mentality? when thinking about their careers. She also advised the youngsters to ask themselves very simple questions, such as ?What am I all about?? She explained that ?in this way, you can find a perfect match with a job that you can call a career. An academic qualification is only a starting point.?

 On the subject of the ever-changing job market, Malhotra had a warning: ?You must be prepared to make at least three total career changes in your life.? Malhotra also took a refreshingly relaxed approach to degrees, saying: ?Once you are in a job, your degree courses will hardly matter. Also, don?t specialise too much. A general specialist is a very good thing to be.?

 At the end of the session, Malhotra opened the floor to questions, which ranged from ?What is the best way to get into PR management?? to ?I?m doing geography, but I want to be a digital artist ? what should I do?? 

 Malhotra gave simple and straightforward solutions to almost every query that the attentive audience threw at her.

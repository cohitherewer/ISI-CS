Screen On amp; Off

 It?s time for the telecast of the first ever action awards on the Indian small screen. Come Sunday, Dino Morea will be presenting the AXN Action Awards on the popular action channel.

 Aimed at crowning the tough guys who come up with jaw-dropping performances on the big screen, the awards received more than 2,00,000 votes for the different categories.

 From biker stunts and other on-ground activities to enthusiastic responses on SMS and votes on the AXN website, action fans have added muscle to the novel concept.

 Says Rohit Bhandari, director of South Asia, marketing and sales, SPE Networks: ?Indian cinema has been producing some of the best action heroes in the world. So how could AXN resist helping our viewers to felicitate the brawniest of them all? Delivering to our viewers the best in entertainment is what we strive for. So, depending on the choice of our audiences, the entire concept of the Action Awards will be tailored around their preferences.?

 Coming on the show this Sunday at 8 pm will be former action star and current comedy king Akshay Kumar. On the show, Akki will be chatting with Dino about all the difficult stunts he has done in his career and what are the precautions that are needed to be taken. But not before he walks on to the sets through balls of fire.

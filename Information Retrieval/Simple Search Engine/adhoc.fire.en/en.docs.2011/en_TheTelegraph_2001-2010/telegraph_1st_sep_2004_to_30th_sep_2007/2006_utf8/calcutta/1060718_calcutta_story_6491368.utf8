 Kin plotted murder, changed complaint 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Monday identified Bappaditya Dey as the mastermind behind the murder of his 32-year-old brother-in-law Arghya Dam. Dey had even modified a complaint to police by Dam?s mother, according to the cops. 

 Following two ransom calls on June 11 this year, a day after Dam went missing and was murdered, his mother had drafted a complaint to police. Dey reportedly changed the complaint before submitting it at Muchipara police station.

 ?We found the original complaint in the house of a neighbour of the Dams on Monday. It was a simple missing diary. Dey, who is absconding, mentioned in his complaint that Dam had been abducted for a ransom,? stated Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Dam, a resident of Hidaram Banerjee Lane, disappeared on June 10. His body was found the next day at Dhaniakhali, in Hooghly. 

 The death was confirmed last week after his mother identified his shirt and shoes at Dhaniakhali police station. Dey disappeared a couple of days after lodging the complaint with police.

 The sleuths have found out that Dam?s mother wrote the complaint in the presence of a neighbour and Dey on the evening of June 11. 

 ?After she handed it over to Dey for submission to police, he told the neighbour that it was not written properly. He drafted a fresh complaint, stating Dam was abducted for ransom,? added Singh.

 ?Dey, along with three others, chalked out the murder plan. He called on Dam on June 10 evening. Soon after setting off in an Indica, Dey and his accomplices strangled Dam with an electrical wire. It was recovered from the spot where the body was found,? the cop continued.

 ?Dey returned to the city the next day. He even visited the Lalbazar police headquarters and provided officers misleading information about his brother-in-law?s character.?

 The detective chief claimed that he had interrogated Dey on June 13 night. ?We later found that Dam was not as bad as Dey made him out to be. He suspected that things might go against him after we started cross-checking his statement. The next day, he went missing.?

 Car-cleaner Deepak Das, who was allegedly in the car when Dam was murdered, was remanded in police custody till July 28. He was arrested on Sunday.

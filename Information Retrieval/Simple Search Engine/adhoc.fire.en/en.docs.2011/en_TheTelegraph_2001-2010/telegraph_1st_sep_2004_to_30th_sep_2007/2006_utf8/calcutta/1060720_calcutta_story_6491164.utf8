 One hails from the West Indies, the other from Madagascar. Both have settled down in Shibpur, Howrah, and spread their roots far and wide. Loved by residents of the neighbourhood, they have been christened Rasogolla and Misri.

 A member of their own clan, born and brought up in India, however, has had a mixed fortune. Erratic in its features, it has been named Mad.

 All three breathe in the same compound ? of Shibpur Botanical Garden.

 Joint director of the garden G.S. Giri said Rasogolla and Misri were brought here quite a few years ago to see whether they could survive and germinate in this climate. 

 ?We are mainly interested in conservation of trees and plants from across the world. There are primarily three types of conservation ? international, national and local. We have been successful in conserving various types of trees, including these two, in our garden,? he said.

 The scientific name of Rasogolla, brought from the West Indies, is Chrysophyllum canito L. ?It belongs to the same species as Safota, but the outer skin and flesh are white. The seed is similar to that of Safota, but slightly bigger. Its round shape and sweet taste have prompted local residents to give the tree this unique name,? Giri explained.

 Misri?s scientific name is Labromia bojery A. DC. Its fruits are sweet and look like sugar crystals. ?Both trees bear fruit between November and February. We are experimenting on the percentage of seeds that germinate and are trying to raise the percentage of germination, so people can grow them in their gardens,? Giri said.

 Mad is a ?true-type species? (trees that germinate with similar composition), and no two leaves are similar in shape or size. 

 ?Every leaf is different from the other and it truly represents the unity in diversity in Indian society,? Giri added.

 Those who are interested in growing these trees will have to collect saplings from the state forest department. ?We are not yet ready to distribute these saplings, but hope to do so soon,? Giri signed off.

 Devoted missionary

 Lord Chaitanya has been hailed as a great social and religious reformer, a brilliant scholar and the ultimate devotee of Lord Krishna who left his home and hearth to find his Lord and be one with him. But nobody ever tried to explore the psyche of Vishnupriya, his devoted wife, who remained true to her sacred vows of marriage till the very end. Manipuri Nartanalayas ballet, Samavratee, portrays the milestones of Sri Chaitanyas life through the repercussions they had on Vishnupriyas mind and sentiments. Through all of Chaitanyas activities, Vishnupriya remained a silent spectator, providing him moral support. She tried to follow his path diligently with a missionary zeal despite her turbulent state of mind. Her insecurities were further kindled by Chaitanyas preoccupation with Lord Krishna. The pangs of unrequited love tore her apart and sometimes made her want to revolt against this existence. However, in the end, she freed her beloved from the shackles of her own love, for she realised he was a very special man with a very special mission. Concept and choreography: Bimbavati Devi. 

 Event: Programme to celebrate Manipuri Nartanalayas 33rd anniversary and the 88th birth anniversary of Guru Bipin Singh.

 Maid death triggers mob rage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tension rocked Phoolbagan on Sunday morning after a domestic help died of burns sustained under mysterious circumstances. 

 Residents of neighbouring Kadapara, where the girl?s parents live, turned violent on hearing of the death. Claiming the girl had been murdered, a mob of 50 gathered in front of her employer?s house, threw stones and smashed window panes.

 Police, however, have not made any arrests. ?We are conducting a probe and have not yet found any evidence that supports the allegation of murder,? said Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

 According to police, Pratima Das,15, was found lying on the floor of a bathroom of Ramgopal Kejriwal?s second-floor apartment on CIT Road. ?The Kejriwal family found her around 7 am when they opened the bathroom. She was lying unconscious with 90 per cent burns,? said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.

 The Kejriwals rushed Pratima to NRS hospital and informed her relatives. The girl succumbed to her burns around 9 am. According to the statement the Kejriwals gave police, they had no idea when the girl set herself on fire. 

 Police have the girl?s statement saying she set herself ablaze a few minutes before she was found in the bathroom. ?But there was no signature of a doctor on the sheet on which the statement was written,? said another officer of Phoolbagan police station, adding: ?A statement without a signature does not hold any value in a court of law. We are probing who recorded the statement.?

 Pratima was employed six months ago at the Kejriwals?. ?Another domestic help of the same building referred her name. She left the job on January 19 on her own and returned to her Kadapara home. But the next day, her family came over and requested the Kejriwals to re-employ her. The family agreed,? said the officer.

 Pratima?s family has not lodged any complaint yet, but their neighbours alleged that she had been murdered.

 ?They marched down to the Kejriwal residence, started throwing stones, smashing window panes and flower pots,? said another officer of Phoolbagan police station.

 A large contingent of police, along with deputy commissioner Goyel, rushed to the spot to disperse the mob. ?As no complaint has been lodged so far, we have recorded this as an unnatural death case,? Goyel said. ?The Kejriwals are being examined.?

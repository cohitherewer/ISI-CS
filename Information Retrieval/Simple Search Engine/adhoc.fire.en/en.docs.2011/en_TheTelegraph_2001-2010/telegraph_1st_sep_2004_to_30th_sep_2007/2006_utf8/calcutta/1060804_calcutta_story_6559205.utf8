 The chief ministers plan to reopen the flight training institute in Behala has flown into an air pocket, with no partner with the requisite experience willing to take up the project.

 The poor response has prompted the government to scrap the tender it had floated in June, inviting private companies to restore, renovate and run the institute at Behala Flying Club. 

 We will invite a fresh tender, said chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.

 At least six companies, including Jet Airways, had initially expressed interest in taking over Behala Flying Club, but in response to the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporations tender, only two firms, Pailan Group and Manpower Development and Management Private Limited, submitted bids.

 Jet went out of the fray after the government rejected its proposal to turn the club into a captive institute for training its own personnel.

 Of the two companies that had responded to the tender, the government is satisfied with neither.

 Flight training is not an easy task and it needs hi-tech infrastructure, experience and expert trainers. The two companies may have the financial capability but they lack experience in running such institutes, pointed out Deb. We want to hand over the club to an organisation that has the necessary experience.

 According to transport department officials, the Pailan group runs an aviation institute for air hostesses and aircraft maintenance engineers. The group, which is into realty and also runs general and vocational institutes, has tied up with Nepals Yeti Airlines to take over the club.

 The other bidder, Manpower Development and Management Private Limited, owns hotels and also runs an aviation institute. But training air hostesses and training pilots is not the same thing, the chief secretary stressed.

 As for Jets offer, he asserted: We have made it clear that there will be no captive institute in Behala. The institute must be open to all.

 Officials said they have approached the flight training institutes in Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad with offers for taking over the Behala club.

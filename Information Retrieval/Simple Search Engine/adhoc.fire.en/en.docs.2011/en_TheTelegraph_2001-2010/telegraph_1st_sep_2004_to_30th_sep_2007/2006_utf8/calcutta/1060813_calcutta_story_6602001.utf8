The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ill act in my next life

 SANJNA KAPOOR had a chat with 

 Reshmi Sengupta, while passing through town on Thursday.

 On the Summertime Workshop 

 held at Prithvi in May-June

 The idea was to make the younger generation fall in love with theatre. Its not necessary to make actors out of them, but if there are a few then its a bonus. We have been conducting workshops for children at Prithvi for 15 years, but this is the first time we did something so big. We had 16 productions and 104 shows for 40 days at four venues. There were theatre artistes from Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta who conducted workshops on mime, mask, movements and poetry, theatre, voice modulations or just improvisations. We gave membership cards to kids to come and watch the plays for free during their summer holidays. We had about 62 per cent turnout, which is very encouraging.

 On the archive she is planning at Prithvi Theatre

 It would be wrong to call it an archive. Its rather a collection of our own stuff, and we have just begun collecting things. But we would share the information (of the collection). I am a hoarder and I cant throw things away! Our collection will have the plays and photos of Prithviraj Kapoor. 

 On the Prithviraj Kapoor exhibition in November

 The exhibition is about a man I have heard so many myths and stories about. But I dont know him. He was completely passionate about theatre. So I want to know how he lived and did his theatre, what the people of his time thought about his work or what was the theatre going around then. 

 The exhibition will be part of the annual Prithvi Theatre Festival between November 3-19 with which we will celebrate Prithviraj Kapoors birth centenary. So the whole of Prithvi Theatre will be plastered with posters and photos with visual texts. The display will try to tell a story. 

 On her return to acting

 I will act in my next life! I love acting on stage enormously but its not possible with so much to do at Prithvi. I would have if I had someone else taking care of all the work. I also love conducting workshops for children, which I will do again.

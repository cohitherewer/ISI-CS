 Licence to tax: 

 A shopping mall is a haunt of the well-to-do 

 Apropos the report Maidan orchard 

 to bring in birds, June 17, the state forest departments 

 plan to set up an orchard on the Maidan is most welcome. 

 Calcutta needs more and more trees to reduce its pollution 

 level. 

 The trees will add to the greenery of the Maidan and make the area more beautiful. The fruits will hopefully bring back the birds that have disappeared from the city over the years. Their sweet song will entertain those out on a stroll. 

 The monsoon has set in, so this is the ideal time to plant saplings. But before that, steps need to be taken for their proper care. The saplings planted should grow unhindered and bear fruits in due course. 

 Since fruits are of commercial value, the trees need to be kept under watch. The previous Calcutta Municipal Corporation board, led by Trinamul Congress, had come up with a plan to plant fruit trees on the roadside. It is not known why the plan was abandoned. 

 The forest department should make a sincere attempt to make the latest plan successful. A portion of the parks and the roadsides should be utilised to plant fruit trees. 

 Even a few years back, plantation programmes used to be undertaken under the Vanmahotsav scheme with much interest and mass participation every monsoon. The programme should be revived in the city and its adjoining areas on a large scale to solve the air pollution problem. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report Tax yoke on plex, mall, June 23, the mayors attempt to generate revenue by making multiplex tickets costlier and club memberships dearer is unfortunate. If ticket prices are increased, even the rich would think twice before going for a movie. The revenue would thus drop instead of going up. The civic body has also reneged on its responsibility of promoting sports by hiking the tax on clubs. The mayors sympathy towards IT and education is not misplaced though. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 It is wise on part of the civic 

 body to impose more taxes on multiplexes, malls and clubs. 

 Only well-to-do people go to these places. No matter how 

 much the tax is hiked, they will not feel the pinch. I hope 

 the money the Corporation earns through the levy hike will 

 be utilised for the citys development. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake.

 Apropos the report Clergy fast for school bill, June 17, it is a matter of regret that Christian missionary schools are not being allowed to recruit teachers. The government should give the institutions complete freedom. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala. 

 Apropos Blueprint to upgrade fish market, June 22, it is great that the Howrah fish market is being modernised. The Patipukur fish market, too, is in dire need of revamp. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum Park. 

 Apropos the brief Municipal plea to ignore tax notice, June 15, the municipal commissioner should have apologised to civic tax assessees before requesting them to ignore arrears shown in the bill. Instead of blaming the computers for the mistakes, he should have taken to task the men operating them. 

 C.R. Bhattacharjee,

 Lake Gardens. 

 Apropos the report Cop-basher undaunted, risks arrest, June 20, Sonia Karwalia did the right thing by slapping a constable for neglecting his duty after her two-wheeler was hit by a bus. Given that the men in uniform mostly remain busy collecting bribes, occasional knocks are welcome. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report Fix-it rap for cratered artery, July 31, the contract for the construction of Link Road through New Town from KNI Avenue to the bridge over Kestopur canal was awarded by Hidco to Bridge amp; Roof on November 15, 1999. The work commenced on February 24, 2000 and was completed on July 3, 2004 (before the extended deadline of July 31, 2004). The defect liability period elapsed on July 3, 2005. The deadline extension cannot be attributed to the contractor, as otherwise a penalty would have been imposed. The performance report rates the quality of work as very good. The technical proficiency of the contractor has also been rated very good. Any damage to the road following handover needs thorough analysis. It is inappropriate to publish any hypothetical inference. 

 K. Guha,

 General manager (HRD), Bridge amp; Roof Co. (I) 

 Ltd. 

 Metro replies: We have 

 made no comment of our own. We have simply quoted from the 

 contents of the report prepared by Sadhan Banerjee, who 

 had been asked to probe the causes for damage to the road 

 so soon after its construction. We have also quoted Hidco 

 managing director R.K. Tripathi.

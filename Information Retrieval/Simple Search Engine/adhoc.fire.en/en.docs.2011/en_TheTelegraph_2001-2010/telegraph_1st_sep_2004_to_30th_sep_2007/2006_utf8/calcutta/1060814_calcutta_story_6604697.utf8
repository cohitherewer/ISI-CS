 If youve been missing her 

 infectious smile and her bewitching noodle straps, your 

 wait ends this October with the ICC Champions Trophy. For 

 youll get to see a lot of Mandira cricket 

 Bedi on your television screens.

 Look, people dont 

 expect me to understand the finer nuances of what happens 

 between the 22 yards. And Im happy doing just that, 

 she explains.

 In town for a day for The Telegraph 

 Merchants Cup Golf 2006 Nite, Mandira is visibly excited 

 about her comeback to the small screen after a self-imposed 

 hiatus following season two of Deal Ya No Deal. An 

 adrenaline rush is a must-have for me, she says, with 

 a dazzle of pearls and dimples.

 Thats why I love doing 

 live shows be it compering an event or a cricket match 

 telecast. In comparison, when I look at pre-recorded footage, 

 I realise how slow and boring it is, she adds.

 Armed with a degree in mass communications 

 from Sophiya College, Mandira had every intention to join 

 the media world. But not in front of the camera. Had 

 I not been offered Shanti then, I would have joined 

 an ad agency and written catchy jingles, she rewinds. 

 In fact, I loved writing copies for ad jingles. 

 Since her Shanti days, 

 there has been no looking back for Mandira in the world 

 of glamour. Television offers poured in one after the other, 

 followed by Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Then there 

 were theatre shows, other live events, a trickle of Bollywood 

 movies and the life-changing cricketing role.

 Next up on the career front are 

 quite a few Bollywood films Sanjay Guptas Dus 

 Kahaniyan and two films from Percept and Red Ice. All 

 that is post-November, after the cricket tournament, of 

 course, she smiles.

 Any other plans in filmdom? Of 

 course yes. On the cards are plans for direction, as soon 

 as I get the right opportunity, she reveals.

 And its no longer going 

 to be only four members Mandira, husband Raj Kaushal and 

 their two canine companions (a labrador called Rouger and 

 a basset hound called Buster) on the home front. Yes, 

 we have begun planning for a family, she confirms.

 When Mandiras not shooting, 

 she loves reading and watching films. Raj and I are 

 great Bollywood buffs. We love catching just about any movie 

 at the theatre, she smiles.

 A regular jeans-and-tee person, 

 Mandira has an enviable collection of saris in her wardrobe 

 as well. I have a very Indian face and the sari works 

 to my advantage, always, she feels. 

 Ask her about her Bong connection 

 and she retorts, Doesnt my name sound Bengali? 

 I was born in Woodlands (nursing home) and my parents thought 

 this was a nice Bengali name, pronounced as Mon-dira. 

 We used to live in Alipore though I have lived there only 

 for the first two years of my life. Incidentally, my husband 

 is also a Bengali, comes the clincher.

 And I love chochhori, 

 begun bhaja, aloo posto and khirkadam. 

 Begun bhaja is very easy to make; I can also make 

 aloo posto, she signs off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mob led by Somen in clinic rage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mob, backed by senior Congress leaders Somen Mitra and Pradip Bhattacharya, forced its way into the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) campus in Alipore on Tuesday, demanding reinstatement of seven employees sacked seven years ago.

 The hospital authorities alleged that the agitators had used loudspeakers, causing inconvenience to patients. The services of these employees were terminated in 1999 following their arrest in connection with a criminal case, said Rupak Barua, director, growth and planning, CMRI.

 A 700-strong group, led by the Congress leaders, arrived in front of the CMRI main gate around 1.15 pm.

 The protesters wanted to submit a memorandum to the management, but police did not allow them entry. Some of them, however, forced their way in. The group dispersed after the authorities received the memorandum, said an officer of Alipore police station.

 Barua alleged that the protesters had damaged hospital property. Bhattacharya denied the charge.

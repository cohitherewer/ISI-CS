 Spurt in sexual crimes among minors

 On a Sunday afternoon, five-year-old Richa (name changed) was lured out of her house with chocolates by 15-year-old ?Dineshbhaiya?. He lived next door to the girl?s family and was a friend of her elder brother?s. Dinesh took the child to an abandoned factory in their Tangra neighbourhood, stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth and raped her. The girl returned home crying, the neighbours were alerted and the teenager was netted. After six months of trial, Dinesh was sent to a juvenile home for three years.

 Children are children no more.

 ?Over the past couple of years, we have seen a steady rise in sexual offences among children. Earlier, theft, dacoity and petty cases constituted the common juvenile offences. Sexual crimes accounted for 15 per cent of the cases. The figure has now climbed to 70 per cent. Of the 300-odd cases being tried at the juvenile court, about 200 involve sexual crimes by minors,? said Sikha Bhattacharyya, assistant public prosecutor of the court in Salt Lake.

 The accused are booked under Section 511 (attempt to rape), 376 (rape), 377 (sodomy) and 354 (assault or criminal force intending to outrage a women?s modesty) of the Indian Penal Code.

 ?In 80 per cent of the cases, the accused is aged between 12 and 16 years, while the victim is between three and six years old. In most instances, the victim knew the culprit and the offence was committed on the pretext of playing while the victim?s family was away,? observed assistant public prosecutor (Calcutta Police) Gangadhar Chakraborty.

 According to those dealing with children, there are some common elements in crimes by minors. 

 ?On interrogation, some the accused children admitted that they had watched pornographic movies on cable TV or on a DVD or VCD. Many had access to Internet and had surfed pornographic sites. Some had chanced upon family members while they were engaged in the sexual act,? stated a court official. 

 Most children booked for sexual offences claimed that they did not commit the act out of criminal intent. ?In fact, they were curious and wanted to experiment with something that ?grown-ups? did,? added the official.

 While the state juvenile justice board member Kunal Dey termed the trend ?appalling?, psychiatrist Amarnath Mullick said: ?Only around 20 to 30 per cent of juvenile sex offences are reported to the authorities. The cases mostly involve children from poor and dysfunctional families. Cases involving well-to-do families are almost always hushed up.?

 ?Cable television, with its crime shows and late-night movies, is acting as a provocation. Children use this exposure to explore their sexuality. Also, parents who take pride in their child?s ability to use a computer from childhood should, instead, keep a tab on his Internet surfing habits,? Mullick stated.

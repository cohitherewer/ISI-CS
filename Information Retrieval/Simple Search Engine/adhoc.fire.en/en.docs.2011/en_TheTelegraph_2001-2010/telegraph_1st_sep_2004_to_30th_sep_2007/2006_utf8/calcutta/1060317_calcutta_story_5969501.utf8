 College twin in site hunt

 - Presidency campus II to house hi-tech labs for new courses

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Presidency College is poised to gain a second campus for new-age courses. 

 The proposed campus, likely to come up on 15 acres off the EM Bypass or Rajarhat, will house biotechnology and other laboratories.

 Last week, the college authorities requested chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to allot the additional acres for the second campus. According to sources, the scout for a suitable plot has begun.

 ?Presidency College is renowned for offering high-quality education in conventional subjects for several decades,? said principal Mamata Roy.

 ?But for all-round development of the college, we need to attract meritorious students from all over the country at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and for research in emerging areas, like biotechnology, applied economics and environment management,? she added.

 ?To make a foray into new areas, we need well-equipped laboratories. There isn?t enough space on the present campus to set up infrastructure,? she pointed out.

 Roy said the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) had lauded Presidency College for implementing research projects to the tune of Rs 3 crore in the past five years.

 During their inspection, members of the NAAC team had suggested that the institution needed another campus to start courses in the emerging areas.

 Officials of the state public works department (PWD) have conducted a preliminary inspection to determine the amount of land required for the expansion of the college.

 With the Presidency main building and Baker Laboratory having been declared heritage structures, the PWD team ruled out vertical expansion on the present campus.

 State director of public instruction Subho Shankar Sarkar confirmed that the College Street campus was inadequate to set up sophisticated laboratories. The proposed plot for expansion is yet to be identified, he clarified.

 ?Presidency being a college controlled by the government, we are preparing a composite plan for its expansion. Not just space, other factors like the number of additional staff required are being taken into consideration,? Sarkar said.

 The demands for additional space by other government-run colleges are also being considered, he stated. 

 About a month ago, the chief minister had announced in the Assembly that the government was ready to grant autonomous status to Presidency College.

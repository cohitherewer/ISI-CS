The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rules, records for valid sale

 ABDUR REZZAK MOLLAH, state land and land reforms minister, met readers of The Telegraph on February 24 to answer their queries. Participants included Rahul Roy, Md Aamiruzzaman, Sandip Banerjee, Subhadyuti Datta, Amirul Islam, Chanchal Gupta, Swapan Datta Gupta and Sujoy Das

Md Aamiruzzaman: The state government distributed vested land in the city among the shelterless and for creating infrastructural facilities. Why doesn?t it give a part of such land for the development of educational institutions?

 There is hardly much vested land adjacent to schools in urban areas. If any educational institution requires land for extension and has funds for the purpose, it can approach the state government. The land and land reforms department has for the first time allotted a seven cottah plot to a girls? school at Narkeldanga, in the Rajabazar area.

Md Aamiruzzaman: We are thika tenants. Will you give us clearance if we desire to construct our own building on the plot?

 We will give clearance for a structure up to four storeys if the thika tenant himself wishes to construct a building on the plot where he is presently residing. The department will collect a monthly rent for the land at the rate of Rs 10 per cottah.

Swapan Datta Gupta: Realtor rackets are now active in the city for transactions in thika land. Can a thika plot be sold out by a tenant?

 As price of land in Calcutta is very high, a section of promoters and brokers are always striving to grab plots through underhand dealings. According to the rule, a thika tenant can transfer his plot only to his blood relation. But these days, some of them are illegally selling their land to big businessmen.

Sandip Banerjee: It is very difficult to find out the current status of a plot from your land records office. Why does it take so long to update the record of rights (ROR)?

 The ownership of landed properties changes frequently through registered sale deeds. But registration is not done by our department, which only maintains the ROR. Also, it is optional for a purchaser to change the ROR in his favour. Hence, it is quite possible that the owner mentioned in our record may have sold off the property or may even be dead.

 We are planning to make it mandatory for the purchaser/present owner to get the records corrected in his name within six months of the transaction. He will have to pay a fine for every month of delay.

Md Aamiruzzaman: The regional thika tenancy offices in Calcutta, at Cossipore, Narkeldanga, Tangra and Alipore, are in a bad shape. Hearings have remained pending for over 20 years for want of records. Can you not speed up the work?

 I admit people are not getting satisfactory service from these offices. The main problem is that the state did not get the records of thika plots in Calcutta from the landlords who used to collect khazna (rent for use of land) from their prajas. We depend on Form A, filled by the former prajas, and the assessment inspection book register of the Corporation to compile a list of thika land.

 In order to overcome these shortcomings, we have set up a monitoring committee which had assessed the manpower required in these regional thika tenancy offices. However, these efforts may not bear fruit.

Sujoy Das: When will you start acquiring agricultural land for the Salim group?

 I have made it clear to the company that no multi-crop or double-crop agricultural land will be given to it. Also, only if the land owner benefits from the deal will I sanction it.

Rahul Roy: What scheme is there for landless families?

 We have recently introduced a project to give landless and homeless families 10 cottahs each. The last date for application was on March 1, but we are planning to extend it further.

Concluded

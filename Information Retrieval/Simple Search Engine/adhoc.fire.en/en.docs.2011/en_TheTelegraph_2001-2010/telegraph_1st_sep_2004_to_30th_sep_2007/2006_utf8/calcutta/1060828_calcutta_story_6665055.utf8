 Malady of irregular heartbeats

 A STAFF REPORTER

Moloy Sarkar, a Dhakuria resident, often felt tired and went out of breath. The 70-year-old former central government employee attributed the symptoms to his advancing age.

 But following a near-fatal stroke he suffered a few weeks ago, he was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation, marked by heartbeats faster than normal.

 Sarkar is not alone. According to doctors, five per cent of the citys 65-plus population suffer from this ailment.

 Atrial Fibrillation, if neglected, can lead to paralysis or even death, said Amit Vora, consultant electrophysiologist, who was in the city to address a symposium on Atrial Fibrillation, organised by India Medtronic Ltd.

 The ailment results from formation from tiny electrical circuits throughout the atria, caused by angina, heart attack, valve problems or high blood pressure. Apart from irregular heartbeats, the symptoms are chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue.

 According to doctors, Atrial Fibrillation can also accompany other medical conditions, such as thyroid gland disorder. 

 Among youths in their 20s and 30s, Atrial Fibrillation is caused by a particular bacterial infection in the throat, Vora said. Spreptococci infection, which is air-borne, damages the heart valves, leading to Atrial Fibrillation.

 The normal heartbeat rate is 60-80 a minute. If the beats are much faster than this, it can cause serious problems, like a blood clot in the atrium, said Ajay Kaul, chief cardiac surgeon at BM Birla Heart Research Centre. 

 The blood clots can come loose through the blood vessel, causing damage anywhere in the body by obstructing the blood flow. When this happens in the brain, it causes a stroke. If the blood clot flows into the limbs, it causes gangrene, Kaul pointed out.

 Doctors said there are three types of treatment for Atrial Fibrillation.

 Initially, there can be drug therapy. If the patient does not respond to medication, he would have to be operated upon or a pacemaker implanted to regularise the beats, said Kaul. 

 Radio frequency ablation is another curative procedure.

 Since the ailment results mostly from a heart attack and hypertension, cardiologists feel a controlled diet would be of help. Less salt and sufficient intake of potassium (through fruits and vegetables) would bring down the risk.

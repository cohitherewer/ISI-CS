The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Channels in beam blackout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The case for conditional access system (CAS) became stronger on Wednesday, when the STAR channels disappeared from close to six lakh of the city?s cable homes.

 Less than a week after the Delhi High Court order on the roll out of CAS ? seen to be a way out of beam blocks, among other things ? channels like STAR Plus, STAR Movies, STAR Gold and National Geographic were switched off by the broadcaster on multi-system operator Manthan?s network on Wednesday morning. 

 Manthan, which stopped beaming STAR?s second bouquet of channels comprising STAR One, History Channel and two Disney channels earlier, services nearly 30 per cent of the 20 lakh-odd cable and satellite households in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.

 STAR had issued a public notice informing Manthan viewers of an impending switch-off last month, citing ?non-payment of outstanding dues and non-renewal of subscription agreement?. It had also approached the Telecom Disputes Settlement amp; Appellate Tribunal, where the matter is currently sub judice.

 ?Despite our attempts at resolving the matter, Manthan has not cooperated,? a STAR spokesperson said. STAR also alleged that post-switch-off, pirated feeds of its channels were being shown on the Manthan network. ?We do not accept the figures STAR claims as outstanding for both its bouquets,? said a Manthan official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Training foray by software player

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 Leading financial accounting software company Tally Solutions is making a fresh bid to offer training and the city figures prominently in its plan.

 The company recently launched its global certification programme. Vinod P. John, executive vice-president and head of south Asia business, Tally, said: ?Our training academies have been in place for the past four or five years, but we had adopted a low-key approach. We have now decided to increase our offerings to the market.?

 ?The academies earlier taught just the fundamentals of the Tally software. We saw that a large number of dubious private academies were claiming to produce Tally-certified professionals and decided to start a global programme. No other company is authorised to offer Tally certification,? he explained.

 There are 22 Tally academies in Calcutta, and a few more on the city fringes and in the suburbs. 

 Students, irrespective of their educational background, can join the centres and avail of placement services.

 ?We are investing about Rs 3 crore in the programme and will try to ensure placements for all Tally-certified professionals. It is going to be one of the largest placement drives in India, and will allow the certified professionals to move to their city of choice,? claimed John.

 Tally plans to tie up with a large number of its corporate clients for recruitment services. The company expects to place almost 50,000 people from all over the country over the next few months.

 ?There are 18 lakh Tally users, who are in need of Tally-certified professionals. We will be addressing the need,? stated the vice-president.

 John admitted that the 18-year-old company has been slightly ?conservative? with regard to capitalising on the IT boom in Bengal, and observed that the market in the east has surpassed Tally?s estimates by quite a bit.

 He revealed that Tally will revamp its business outlook for the east, especially with Calcutta proving to be the gateway to the Northeast.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shop stop with high-end brand focus

 Mall-eria, which has Calcutta and its fringes firmly in its grip, with retail racks springing up everywhere, is in no mood to relent.

 Even as Mani Square and South City Mall are nearing completion and Forum II and City Centre II are almost at the starting blocks, yet another shop stop is waiting to be launched by this month-end.

 The 225,000-sq-ft retail-cum-commercial address will come up on Topsia Road, next to Viswakarma, on the Park Circus connector, with Haute Street, the 80,000-sq-ft mall, spread across three levels, to be ready by mid-2008, according to developers Surya Mansions Pvt Ltd.

 We are looking at a very premium mall with high-end brands, many of which would be first-time entrants in Calcutta, promises Amit Tekriwal of Amit International, the marketing agency of the project, planned over 100 cottahs with construction cost pegged at Rs 28 crore.

 Talks are on with the likes of apparel majors Lifestyle, Piramyd and Globus and also with the Reliance hypermarket format to tie up the 30,000-sq-ft anchor tenant for Haute Street.

 The rest of the retail space, to be given out on a 100 per cent rental model, will be taken up by high-profile brands like Wills Lifestyle, Louise Philippe, Samsonite/Giordano, top-end footwear and jewellery brands, besides food and entertainment.

 The design, with a unique tapered and inclined front faade, will be absolutely contemporary, having an international feel to it, promises architect Harsh Sanon of Sanon Sen amp; Associates, in charge of the elevation and interiors.

 The 16 ft-plus height at all levels is a clincher in the retail segment and we are making it as column-free as possible, using the post-tension construction method, Sanon tells Metro. The interiors, with an imposing atrium, will also reflect the contemporary, minimalist feel, he adds.

 In the F amp;B spread, too, we will bring in formats and brands that Calcutta doesnt have till date, says Tekriwal. The promoters, a combine of the Arya Group and the Rawal Wasia Group, are aiming to deliver a focused retail rendezvous with heavy footfalls, and not just a hangout joint.

 Pinnacle, the 110,000-sq-ft commercial wing, is to be completed by end-2008 and will be the first wi-fi enabled office space in the city, says the marketing agency. There will be parking slots for 225 cars.

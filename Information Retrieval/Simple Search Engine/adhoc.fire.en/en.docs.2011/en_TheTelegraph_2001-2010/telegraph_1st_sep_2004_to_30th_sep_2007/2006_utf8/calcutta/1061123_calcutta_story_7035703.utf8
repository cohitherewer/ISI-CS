 In a magical world

 Calcutta has always been a fertile ground for nurturing all forms of artistic expressions. The large number of art exhibitions held round the year is proof enough of the Calcuttans affinity to the arts. However, out of those umpteen numbers of artists, only the very promising ones keep their indelible mark on mass memory. Bidyut Ghosh is one of them. This youth lives here, shares the same city space like us, yet transcends its limitations and reaches a higher plain, taking off on the wings of his imagination. With the subtle touch of his fingers, as he holds the brush, he transforms the canvas into a magical experience that sweeps the viewer off his feet in a grand display of colours, shades and moods. Ghosh amalgamates traditional icons with contemporary themes and gives a new dimension to his paintings. His works, done solely in acrylic and watercolour, are bright, colourful, earthy and vibrant. Use of geometric shapes and patterns, often to emphasise the 3-D effect, are some the techniques used deftly by Ghosh. Each of his paintings is like an onion that you keep peeling and more layers emerge.

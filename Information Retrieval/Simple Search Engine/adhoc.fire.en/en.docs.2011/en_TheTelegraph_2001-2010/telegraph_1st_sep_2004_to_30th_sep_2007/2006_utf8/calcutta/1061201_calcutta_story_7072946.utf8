The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 US plane blocks runway

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Before the spotlight shifted to US ambassador to India David C. Mulfords Calcutta visit, an eight-seater plane with US registration hogged all the attention on Thursday morning.

 The private chartered aircraft overshot the runway while landing in the city, holding up the main runway for over an hour.

 The eight-seater plane with US registration flew in from Bangkok. On its way to Mumbai, it had a scheduled landing at Calcutta, said airport officials. 

 The flight, with pilot and co-pilot on board, touched down on the main runway at 10.48 am. The pilot lost control and the plane rolled off the runway and on to the adjoining field. 

 According to airport officials, the last such incident dates back to October 9 last year, when an Air Sahara plane overshot the runway and got stuck in the slush, disrupting services for 82 hours.

 We swung off into the kuchcha. All operations normal. I am switching off and getting down, the pilot reportedly told the Air Traffic Control.

 A security jeep was sent to the aircraft and a fire tender was kept on standby.

 The aircraft had landed properly and slowed down. Otherwise, it could have overturned, said an airport official, adding that the aircraft rolled 22 m off the runway before coming to a halt.

 An Air Sahara flight to Hyderabad was about to take off from the main runway then. It was allowed to take off only after a security inspection.

 An Indian Air Force aircraft also took off before the main runway was shut down and aircraft brought to the parking bay.

 The secondary runway was used and there was no disruption in services, officials claimed, till the main runway was thrown open at 12.20 pm.

 The pilot and co-pilot are safe and there was no damage to the aircraft... The DGCA (directorate-general of civil aviation) is conducting an inquiry into the incident, stated airport director V.K. Monga.

 Airport sources said one of the planes engines suffered a snag, but there was no official confirmation. Things will be revealed only after the probe, maintained Monga.

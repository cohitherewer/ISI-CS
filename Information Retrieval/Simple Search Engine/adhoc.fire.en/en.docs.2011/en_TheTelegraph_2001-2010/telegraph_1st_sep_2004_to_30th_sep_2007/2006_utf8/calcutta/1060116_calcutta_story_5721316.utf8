 Secrets of the sea

From rehydrating facials and spa pedicure 

to even skin-deep problems, marine cosmetology is the latest on the beauty block, 

finds out Anumita Ghosh

 Facials and body polishing with sea minerals 

are popular at city spas and salons; Dead Sea salt is known to be an effective 

regenerative beauty agent 

There is something aesthetically tranquil and therapeutic 

about being near the sea ? the blue waves breaking at your feet, the cool breeze 

caressing your face and the soft sand soothing your senses.

 The curative powers of the sea were recognised by the Greek playwright Euripides and now thanks to extensive research by some cosmetic majors across the globe, these very powers today form a major branch of beauty and healthcare.

 Internationally, marine cosmetology is already a rage and Calcutta is catching up.

 Our blood plasma and the contents of seawater share similar compositions. Hence the skin absorbs sea minerals and vitamins easily. And these are effective in curing from within. With the booming wellness scene in India right now, people are aware of the healing touches of the sea and are ready to move over to marine cosmetology, says Devdutta Sengupta Ghosh, product manager of Luxasia.

 The company is distributing Phytomer, a popular French marine cosmetic brand, in Asia.

 GoodLife delves deeper into the rejuvenating and healing powers of the sea which are not just skin deep.

 Body care 

 Just as herbs and oils in Ayurveda have been used to reinvigorate the body and mind for ages, use of the curative properties of the Dead Sea minerals and salts date back centuries. Legendary beauties like Cleopatra and Queen of Sheba are believed to have favoured the natural spa of the Dead Sea. 

 The water of the Dead Sea about 1,300 ft below sea level contains essential minerals like potassium that regulates osmosis and water balance, magnesium that affects cell metabolism, sodium that influences muscle activity and much more.

 Minerals are the regulators and activators of many essential cellular functions. As we age, we experience stress and pollution and our body begins to lack vital minerals. These minerals are small enough in molecular size and are able to penetrate the skins basal layer to replenish de-vitalised cells, points out Bandana Moktan, beauty adviser of Mineral Line, a range of products from Odeyah Industries based in Israel.

 The Black Mud Body Mask from Mineral Line with its natural cleansing property removes excess oils and dead skin cells, the effect being a youthful skin that glows. Beauty and hair expert June Tomkyns points out: Devoid of chemicals, the Dead Sea salt that we use for body polishing not only leaves the skin soft and supple, the result is noticeable instantly.

 The Mineral Line Spa Pedicure, currently a rage in salons across the city, promises to be a de-stressing journey for the feet. After the feet are washed with Black Mud soap, a soak in warm water with a few drops of Dead Sea water and Dead Sea bath salt de-stresses and helps maintain the moisture level. 

 A gentle scrub with the Peeling Foot Cream ensures removal of dead skin, followed by a mud pack that is optional. The holistic procedure is complete with application of foot cream. 

 It not only has a feel-good effect, it also works intensively on the sensitive soles of the feet and relieves you of joint pains, points out Saira Ali, manager of the Health Club and Salon at Taj Bengal.

 Designed for both men and women, spa therapies from Phytomer combine natural sea elements with exclusive treatments like the Reflexothermale. A massage to stimulate the sensitive areas of the body is followed by mineral mud wraps on reflex zones like the soles and the spinal chord. As Devdutta of Luxasia puts it: Beauty now is no longer restricted to the facial protocol.

 The Ogenage facial, an intensive hydrating treatment, helps combat wrinkles. In the three-stage facial, the first mask applied is according to the skin type, followed by the Thermoactive Prestige Mask and Ogenage Aqualift Mask.

 Follow-up

 After undergoing a sea treatment at a spa or salon, maintenance with hydrating products is a must. So, follow-up with routine care at home with the daily use line from Phytomer, adds Devdutta.

 The product line with contents of Oligomer (frozen sea water) provides beauty care solutions for all skin types, hyper-pigmentation and dark circles. The Mineral Line range boasts after-shave balms, hand lotions, mud shampoo, night cream and lots of other regular-use products with Dead Sea minerals.

 Healing touch

 If all this is about that radiant glow on your face and body, healing properties from the sea are extensively used in food supplements too. Launched in Calcutta last year by Wonder Care, the Nikken Sohonsha range of food supplements from Japan is the outcome of several years of rigorous research.

 There is a gradual awareness about the wonders micro algae can do. An extensive research led to the launch of Nikken Sohonsha products that have no side effects, says Sujata Saraf, co-founder of Wonder Care.

 The supplements include micro algae like Dunaliella Bardawill that is rich in beta-carotene that fights toxins, Chlorella Polysaccharide enhancing immunity of body cells, Mondus Subterraneus preventing heart diseases and Isochrysis Galbana that helps build brain nerves.

 Dead Sea treasures help cure skin diseases like acne, with its high sulphur content. High magnesium and bromine contents in the Dead Sea mud helps relieve allergic symptoms too.

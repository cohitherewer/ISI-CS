 You must be banking on Banaras 

 ? A Mystic Love Story to change your fortunes?

 Although every film is important, I can?t deny the fact that Banaras is a solo film for me after a long time. Naturally, the expectations are very high. Also, there?s the fact that I am in the company of great actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Urmila Matondkar. So, people expect me to really come up with a great performance and stand up to them? The box-office performance of the film is not in my hands. I am hopeful that the film will work its magic like the city worked its magic on me.

 How did the city manage to 

 change you?

 The city of Varanasi had a lasting impression on me and it completely transformed me. I have never been a religious person, although I have been interested in spirituality a lot. But when I went to Varanasi, the place had a magical effect on me. You have millions of people coming for millions of years and putting in all their energy into one place. So, there must be a lot of energy stored in there and that presence is quite palpable. I got a jumpstart and I started believing in the power of spaces.

 In fact, the subject that we were dealing with in the movie helped me know the city better. Now, I am completely into spirituality. Also, I realised that all the beliefs and faiths that I have maintained all along were along the lines of Buddishm. That was a kind of reaffirmation that I was on the right track.

 You also met The Dalai Lama 

 recently?

 Yes, I got to meet him in Delhi a couple of months back and it was another moving interaction for me. He made a lot of things very lucid for me. He told me if something makes you happy, just do it, don?t think about it. He told me that if you can understand the difference between expectation and reality, then you will coast through life. So, these days, I have my hopes but I don?t get overtly disappointed when things don?t work out for me. Things happen for a reason and things don?t happen for a reason. After a crazy couple of years of ups and downs, I really feel transformed now. Banaras has been like a huge catalyst.

 But how did you bag Banaras?

 That you have to ask the makers. I myself could never have associated myself with a film like Banaras. In fact, the producer L.C. Singh, who is also the writer of the film, had come to meet me on the sets of a film called Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana in Madh Island where I was shooting for a song with long hair and bandanna. There was no chance they could have signed me on for a film like Banaras after seeing me in that kind of a modern get-up. But strangely, that?s what they did. They later told me that what had stuck them were my eyes. They needed very innocent yet deep eyes for the character of Soham, who is almost angelic in nature.

 How did you prepare to get 

 into the character of Soham?

 See, Banaras is not a typical Mumbai-based film. All the characters speak in a certain language, in a particular dialect. So that had to be adopted. Then I had extended discussions with the writer, who had grown up in Varanasi and had spent his formative years there. Most importantly, shooting on real locations helped get the feel of the place. As soon as I used to get into my kurta and pyjama, I would feel so much peace, calmness and serenity within me.

 What was it like working with 

 your illustrious co-stars?

 Urmila, of course, is a great actress and a fabulous dancer. We share a very good chemistry in the film, which is, at the basic level, a love story. As for Naseersaab, it?s just a pleasure watching him perform. At times, I used to be so engrossed watching him delivering his lines, that I would forget that I was in the shot. Of course, I had lots of questions for him and kept talking to him throughout the schedule.

 As for Dimple, what do I say? I have had the hugest crush on her. So getting to be in the same frame with her was another dream come true for me. Then there?s Raj Babbar, Akash Khurana? a great set of actors.

 Was Banaras a one-off 

 assignment or will you continue to do serious cinema?

 That will depend on how Banaras does. I hope it gets both commercial and critical acclaim. Leaving my selfish interests aside, I think everyone should watch the film. It will have an influence on every member of the audience, at different levels. For most, it will be a love story but for people who have questions in their minds, it will answer many spiritual questions. Banaras is a very powerful film.

 What else are you shooting 

 for?

 There?s the romantic comedy Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana next with Rekha and Mahima. Then there?s Aaditya Datt?s (Aashiq Banaya Aapne) new film Dil Diya Hai with Emraan Hashmi and a newcomer. That?s the Murder duo of Emraan and me together again. And then there?s a 3-D animation-cum-live-action film in Friends Forever with Hrishita Bhatt.

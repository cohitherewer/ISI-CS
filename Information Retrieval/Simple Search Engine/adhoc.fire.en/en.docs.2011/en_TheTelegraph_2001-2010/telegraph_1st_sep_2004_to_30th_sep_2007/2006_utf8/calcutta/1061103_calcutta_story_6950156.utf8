What: Singapore food festival.

 Where: Waterside Cafe, Hyatt Regency Calcutta.

When: Till November 4.

The spread: Relish the flavours of Singaporean 

cuisine by chefs Ronnie Han and Wee Kim Yang who have been flown in. Start with 

a wide selection of salads including Chinese Rojak (pineapple, apple, cucumber, 

prawn paste and peanuts). Move on to the main course with two varieties of noodles 

 Char Kway Teow (rice noodle with pork sausage, seafood, fish and soya sauce) 

and Ponggol Mee Goreng (yellow noodle with prawn, squid, fish cake and eggs).

You can choose from Chicken Rice, Chilli Crab, Mee 

Siam (egg, dry bean curd and green chives with tamarind sauce) and Fried Carrot 

Cake to complete your meal. The Laksa, a meal by itself, is noodles served in 

a bowl with egg, prawn and fish cake in spicy coconut gravy. End on a sweet note 

with Chocolate Mud Pie, Cherry Cheesecake, sugar-free Tiramisu, Gulab Jamun and 

more for dessert.

so, with luck on your side, you can win a return ticket 

to Singapore and stay at the Grand Hyatt in Singapore, thanks to the festival 

organised jointly by Singapore Airlines and Singapore Tourism.

Pocket pinch: The Singaporean lunch buffet 

is priced at Rs 650. The Sunday lunch and dinner buffet comes for Rs 750-plus. 

Prices of dishes, a la carte, start at Rs 575.

Voiceover: Basic Singaporean cooking 

goes with a lot of seafood but is spicy enough to suit the Indian palate, 

said Hemant Mehta, executive chef, Hyatt Regency Calcutta.

What: Launch of Subways third outlet.

Where: 175, Block G, New Alipore.

When: October 31.

Bite in: If youre looking for an alternative 

to traditional fatty fast food, this is the place to head for. Spread over 1,100 

sq ft, this is the largest Subway site in the city, the other two being at Woodburn 

Park and Salt Lakes Sector V. US consul-general Henry V. Jardine inaugurated 

the 35-cover eatery at New Alipore. There is a low-fat diet for the calorie-conscious 

crowd and a Kids Pak for the little ones. 

The USP: Fresh and healthy food nothing cooked 

or fried, everything baked or toasted seven days a week.

of sandwiches, four kinds of bread and over 10 kinds of sauces. Subs favoured 

worldwide include Chicken Teriyaki, Subway Melt and Southwest Chicken. Local subs 

include Aloo Patty, Veg Shammi and Corn and Peas. Other popular buys are Veggie 

Delite in the vegetarian section and Italian BMT (smoked chicken ham, lamb, pepperoni 

and lamb salami). 

For the spicy Indian palate theres Chicken Tikka, 

Chicken Seekh and Chicken Kali Mirch. Salads and freshly-baked cookies are also 

on offer.

Pocket pinch: Sandwiches are priced between 

Rs 50 and Rs 125. Pay a little extra and convert your 15 cm submarine sandwich 

into a footlong.

Voiceover: We hope to create the habit 

and passion for fast food in a city that has a huge growth potential owing to 

its under-saturated food market, said Rishi Bajoria, Subway development 

agent for Eastern India.

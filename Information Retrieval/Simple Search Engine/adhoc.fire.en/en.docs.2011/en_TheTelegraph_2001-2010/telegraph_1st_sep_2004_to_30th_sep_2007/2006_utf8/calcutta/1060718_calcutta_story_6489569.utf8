Opening with a track from Fanaa, Aqeel moved on to Bollywood hits like Ya Ali, Rang de basanti, Tu hi meri shab hai, Aashiqui mein teri, Chand sitaare, Ye mera dil, Tu hai wahi and many more.

 Springing surprises and changing tracks with effortless ease, Aqeel kept the guests on their toes with his charm and energy.

 While he sent out special messages for Calcutta and the ladies present, his dance moves with a group of young girls was clearly the show-stealer of the night.

 The night rocked till a few hours into Sunday as Aqeel played tracks from Don and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna to a packed house and an even more crowded dance floor.

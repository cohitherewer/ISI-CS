 Free flow of funds to fight arsenic

 JAYANTA BASU

 With Assembly elections only days away, the state government has made the biggest promise ever on containing the arsenic menace.

 Public health engineering minister Goutam Deb announced on Monday that the government would spent ?around Rs 2,000 crore in the next three to four years? to ensure that no one is forced to drink water contaminated by arsenic.

 ?The money will not come from any external funding agency, but from the government exchequer,? the minister asserted. 

 The Centre, he claimed, had agreed to the state government?s proposal to share funds on a 3:1(state) ratio for ?arsenic mitigation? projects. 

 Accordingly, a sum of Rs 600 crore will be released by New Delhi under the 12th Pay Commission. 

 The previous NDA government had stopped funding arsenic mitigation projects in Bengal.

 Deb was speaking at a seminar on Safe Drinking Water by 2006 for West Bengal, organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce. Successful case studies on arsenic mitigation were presented by experts from the USA at the seminar.

 Giving an idea of the extent of contamination in the state, public health engineering chief engineer P. K. Dutta said that more than 20 million people, including over 12 million in urban areas, across the state are living in risk zones. 

 ?Ground water in 79 of the 341 blocks in the state is contaminated with arsenic. The situation is most frightening in Murshidabad, Nadia and North 24-Parganas,? Dutta pointed out.

 But will a steady flow of funds automatically ensure that people get safe drinking water?

 ?Funds are, no doubt, necessary, but the real challenge lies in successful implementation of the projects and their maintenance. At least the formulation of a master plan is a step in the right direction,? said K.J. Nath, chairman of the Arsenic Task Force set up by the state government. 

 Others are more forthright. ?Arsenic pollution was first brought to the authorities? notice way back in 1979. What were they doing over the past two-and-a-half decades, apart from holding innumerable seminars and trying to find cost-effective engineering solutions that seldom turned out to be successful?? asked an official.

 He also pointed out that proposals for housing estates in the arsenic-affected areas are being cleared without making provisions for supply of safe potable water.

 ?The government is trying to fool everybody,? alleged environment activist Subhas Dutta. 

 ?Only a minuscule part of the money allotted for arsenic mitigation reaches the affected areas. The government is getting millions for treatment of arsenic-contaminated water, but is actually supplying normal filtered surface water to the people of the affected areas,? he added.

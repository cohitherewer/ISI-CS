The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 With KANK, I have broken my own mould

 In town to receive an award, KARAN JOHAR tells Pratim D. Gupta how he changed the comma to a question mark and why he wont wish Shah Rukh Khan on his birthday

 Karan Johar says that now 

 there will be a sense of surprise about his films 

 How does it feel to win the Outstanding Young Achievers 

 Award given by the Young Leaders Forum of Indian Chamber 

 of Commerce?

 It is always good to win an award. I take every award with an equal amount of energy and excitement. Film awards are great but when the honour is for a body of work, it means that all my hard work and passion for what I do is being appreciated.

 Its been almost three months since Kabhi Alvida Naa 

 Kehna released. Have you been happy with the response?

 I always knew that KANK would open up a Pandoras box. It was that kind of a film where people would have diverse opinions on the subject. Yes, people were shocked that someone like me would handle a rampant reality like infidelity, something not everyone wants to accept. Then many found it to be very progressive, with a strong underlying message.

 People loved it, people hated it but they were not indifferent to the film. They appreciated the pertinent questions KANK asked. Its fine if you loved the film but even those who disliked it, the message went home.

 Yes, marriage is a sacred institution but you should take a great amount of care before you step into it. In our country, many people marry under parental and social pressures but one shouldnt marry someone unless there is an intense amount of love and passion between them.

 This is the message I wanted to put across and wanted to do it on a large scale. KANK could have been made on a lower scale and maybe even with lesser stars but I wanted to reach the maximum people.

 Mukherjee in Karans Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna

 As you said, there were mixed reactions in India but what 

 about all the international festivals you travelled to?

 We went to Germany and Toronto. KANK is now being shown at the film festival in Tokyo. Then we will go to France and Terreno. You know what, the world associates India with a certain amount of tradition, culture-based movies. Now, here was an urban film from India. We may be a Third World country but the emotions are universal.

 The urban atmosphere in the west is very similar to ours. They always expect a rural, rustic film or a happy family saga from us. So, they were kind of surprised with a greyer film, that too from mainstream Indian cinema.

 And how has it done commercially?

 KANK is my biggest hit overseas. Besides the US and the UK where it has done fantastically, it got a mainstream release in Germany where it was received very well. The best thing about the whole thing is that KANK put things on the global map for India as a whole and not just me and my production house.

 Here was a mainstream Indian cinema being accepted at foreign film festivals and yet making money at the box-office. And its a great feeling to take Indian cinema forward.

 Does that mean Karan Johars cinema will be grey from now?

 Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was a reflection of my mind and growth as a film-maker. When I wrote the film two years back, I strongly felt about it. Now, this process of growth is constant. I could now stay grey, or go black or white. I am done with the Alvida thoughts and have moved on. What I have been able to do with KANK is break my own mould. Now, when you will walk in to watch a Karan Johar film, you wont know what to expect. You will be like: Whats he made now? Rather than be a comma, I would like to be a question mark. Maybe I will surprise again, maybe I will make something I have made before. The sense of wonderment is essential.

 But will that come after another five years?

 No, no (laughs). I plan not to wait for so long. I will start scripting ASAP (as soon as possible) and once the casting is done, we will roll. It should be ready for a 2008 release. A two-year gap is not that bad.

 What is the next project of Dharma Productions?

 We will be starting two films. One will be directed by Soham who made Kaal. And the other will be made by Tarun Mansukhani, who has assisted me on KANK and Kal Ho Naa Ho. They will go on the floors in 2006 itself.

 My closest release will be Koffee with Karan, which will be back on air (on STAR) in January next year.

 You 

 also shot a commercial for Airtel with Shah Rukh

 And I found it quite difficult to make something for 30 seconds having always expressed myself in three hours! I realised how it feels when someone is comfortable with his own space. Amongst all those present on the sets on the day of the shooting, I felt the most intimidated. It was like the first day of shooting for me.

 Shah Rukhs birthday is on Thursday. Is there anything you 

 want to tell him?

 We dont wish family members on their birthdays and Shah Rukh is family. But yes, his birthday is special because he is special.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

More hearts set to beat

Screen On amp; Off

 Telly dude: Shabbir Ahluwalia

 The adventure and thrill on the 

 STAR One quiz show Heart Beat ? Dil Thhaam Ke Khelo hits 

 a new high as the dude of the small screen Shabbir Ahluwalia 

 tries to keep his cardiac muscles in control. While TV actress 

 Mansi Verma will face the music on Tuesday, midway into 

 the Wednesday episode the Kahiin To Hoga star will 

 take over. 

 Earlier, other telly stars like Varun Bhadola and Supriya Pilgaonkar have had a great run on the show and now the pressure is on Shabbir to perform. While help is at hand from friends and family, it?s limited to short phone calls. All Shabbir?s got is a reclining chair, a food-and-beverage bar, a few scary plasma screens, a music player with a song list, a soothing water fountain and a fishbowl.

 Will all that help him keep his mind off the time ticker? Catch Heart Beat on Star One, Monday to Thursday at 9.30 pm.

 Not content with ruling the kids? space in India via satellite, Cartoon Network announced a new one-hour programming block Cartoon Network Duniya, on Doordarshan National. Starting July 8, the brand new one-hour block every Saturday from 10.30 am to 11.30 am will feature two of Turner?s most popular and successful original productions, M.A.D. (Music, Art and Dance) and Codename: Kids Next Door. 

 Cartoon Network Duniya will also showcase other popular series, including Turner?s most awaited original production, Galli Galli Sim Sim, the Indian version of globally renowned pre-school series Sesame Street.

 ?Doordarshan?s extensive reach across India will enable kids in non-C amp;S homes to enjoy Turner?s engaging original production that has so far been limited to C amp;S homes,? said Turner International India MD Anshuman Misra.

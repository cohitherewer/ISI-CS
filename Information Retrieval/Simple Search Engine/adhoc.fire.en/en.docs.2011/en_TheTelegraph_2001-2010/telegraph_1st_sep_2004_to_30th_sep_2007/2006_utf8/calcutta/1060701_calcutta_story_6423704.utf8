The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Destination 

 Germany

 Mayor Bhattacharyya 

 gifts roses to the team members who will attend the 

 UNESCO youth festival. Picture by Pradip Sanyal 

 India may not have made it to 

 the World Cup, but a select group of 17 youngsters will 

 make a trip to Stuttgart as part of India?s delegation to 

 the UNESCO World Youth Festival. The children are from a 

 number of city schools, including Young Horizons School 

 and Children?s Foundation. They will make a cultural presentation 

 on ?The wonder that is India? for the other nations in attendance.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya 

 gave an audience to the 17 children and wished them well 

 on their inter-continental journey. ?I?m sure my Calcutta 

 kids will do India proud, and I hope that they will establish 

 permanent friendships in the duration of their visit. I 

 am confident that they will leave their mark there.?

 During their visit to the South 

 German city, they will be welcomed by a host family who 

 will guide them around town. The children will attend workshops 

 at schools in the Stuttgart locality. Sports will obviously 

 play a prominent role in the proceedings, with a sports? 

 day featuring in the schedule, in addition to viewing the 

 World Cup matches on the huge screens that are set 

 up at Schlossplatz in the city. Their visit will culminate 

 in viewing the World Cup final from Schlossplatz on July 

 9, after having partied the entire night before in Stuttgart?s 

 city centre.

 There will, however, be plenty 

 of other activities that won?t involve the World Cup. For 

 example, the children will be able to see the development 

 of Germany?s famous car engineering at the Mercedes-Benz-Welt 

 car museum. There will also be The Festival of Friends which 

 will host displays of art and culture from all the participating 

 countries at an open-air theatre on the Hohenpark Killesberg.

 Satyajit Sen of St Joseph and 

 Mary?s School betrayed the sense of anticipation that was 

 felt among all those going on the trip. ?I really want to 

 absorb as a lot of the other nations? cultures while I am 

 there. Of course, I also want to make sure that the others 

 there get a good glimpse of Indian culture.? With the confidence 

 of Calcutta?s mayor and UNESCO, Satyajit and his team will 

 no doubt do India justice.

 Band together with rhythm and 

 raga

 Blendz practises under Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya?s 

 guidance

 What happens when students of 

 commerce, fashion design, interior design and disc jockeying 

 come together? They fuse Indian classical music with the 

 Western school, and make an audience of teens and twenties 

 rock.

 Blendz is a group of six young 

 guns, all students of The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education 

 Society. Under the musical guidance of Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya, 

 they have just finished recording his compositions for their 

 maiden album.

 ?We are using Western chords and 

 beats with Indian ragas. Ours is an instrumental band, with 

 vocals coming in only for alaap and taankari,? 

 elaborates Kunal Saha, a second-year commerce student. For 

 instance, Raga Kirwani and Darbari Kanara have been fused 

 to create Challenges, one of the tracks they have recorded. 

 ?Darbari has so many ups and downs. The track represents 

 the uncertainty that we, students, face in life ahead.? 

 Then there is Tribute to Motherland, based on Raga Bhupali. 

 Dreams uses western chords with Raga Kirwani.

 The youngsters received the incentive 

 to band together after three of them represented their college 

 at an inter-college fest in Mumbai last year. ?It was a 

 complete revelation to have the hip crowd rocking to Indian 

 classical music,? recalls Moumita Roy, the vocalist, of 

 their winning performance.

 The search then began. ?We found 

 the other group members through college fest auditions and 

 word of mouth.? While Kunal has been training on the santoor 

 under Pandit Bhattacharya, Mrinmoy Saha is a disciple of 

 tabla exponent Pandit Shankar Ghosh. Moumita too is a trained 

 vocalist. Sagar Paul?s training at the turntable makes him 

 add scratches to the music on his keyboard.

 The sextet has taken the stage 

 at corporate calls as well as public shows. Another fest 

 beckons in Mumbai in August though they are unsure whether 

 they would be able to make it as two have examinations around 

 the time. ?But usually college is not a problem as it is 

 a lean season for shows when exams happen,? says Moumita.

 Will the show go on after college? 

 ?It has to. What we have undertaken is a challenge in a 

 world feeding on Bollywood and Western music,? states Sagar.

 HERE ?N? THERE

 A song, dance and story-telling session 

 at Nehru Children?s Museum on Hellen Keller?s birth 

 anniversary on June 27

 Keller call

 They stared vaguely at everything 

 around, heads lolling at awkward angles. Yet, as the music 

 played on, there was a flicker of recognition and a hint 

 of a smile on their faces. It is not known how many of the 

 children who had assembled at Nehru Children?s Museum on 

 June 27, understood all that Arpita Chatterjee said about 

 Hellen Keller?s life on the occasion of her 126th birth 

 anniversary. Perhaps, they didn?t need to know about the 

 struggle Keller had put up. All they wanted was to be given 

 their rights, understood and loved.

 As part of the programme, organised 

 by Sruti disAbility Rights Centre, the youngsters from Manovikas 

 Kendra, Noble Mission, Diksha, Udbhas Spastic Society, Udayani 

 and Mentaid enjoyed a tour of the museum and a Storytellers? 

 presentation. Dances were then presented by children of 

 Mentaid to the songs of Bhoomi and Mohiner Ghoraguli.

 Helping hand

 The Suburban Educational Society, 

 that runs St Xavier?s Institution, Panihati, donated more 

 than Rs 2,50,000 to 195 students at a function on June 18. 

 The funds will be used for the purchase of text books and 

 uniforms, and for their school fees for the current academic 

 session.

Twisted rendezvous

Screen On amp; Off

 Simi Garewal may return for another 

 season of Rendezvous with the rich and famous but 

 she has competition this time. She?s not the only one into 

 celebrity whispering on the airwaves as Semi Girebaal is 

 ready to take her on.

 Yes, in the latest spoof on MTV, VJ Cyrus Sahukar has donned the whites to anchor the show that is called, quite obviously, Rendezvous with Semi Girebaal.

 Incidentally, Cyrus waxed his legs to get the feel of the character right. He claims to love the original show and does not mean to disrespect ?Simi Aunty? with his spoofs. In fact, if she ever meets him, Cyrus will greet her by saying, ?I am sorry, I am just doing my job.?

 This is not the first time Cyrus is playing a woman. He has done so many times right from his school days. On MTV, he has played Shania Twain, as well as an Abba girl.

 As Cyrus says in Simi, err Semi, style: ?But darlings, this is such a wonderful opportunity to meet these lovely people. They are so beautiful, yet so brave to come on my show and reveal their silly souls to me. Come, watch my show, fall in love and be touched by these exquisite specimens of humanity.?

 The first season of Rendezvous with Semi Girebaal will be shown on Sunday, 9.30 pm on MTV.

 The elusive thunderstorm finally arrived on Thursday evening, bringing relief to Calcuttans from a long spell of sweltering heat.

 The rain recorded by the Alipore weather office between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm was just 3 mm but the mercury plunged by two degrees. 

 A thunderstorm is likely on Friday, too.

 G.C. Basu, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said: ?There was a heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay since Thursday morning, in the wake of a wind from the south and south-west. In addition, a low-pressure trough, about two km from the sea level, extended from sub-Himalayan Bengal to Chhattisgarh. There was also a cyclonic circulation over sub-Himalayan Bengal.?

 The trough and cyclonic circulation helped intensify the inflow of moisture, resulting in formation of cloud columns 16-17 km tall over the city.

 Around 6.30 pm, the wind started blowing at 29 km per hour and black clouds swirled overhead. The rain started around 7 pm.

 ?Over the past fortnight, there had been several instances of incursion of moisture. What was lacking was a trigger effect, which we had today,? an official explained.

 The weather office issued a thunderstorm warning for Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly, and North and South 24-Parganas.

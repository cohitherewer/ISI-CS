The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blame the finery, not the Romeos

 EYE CANDY: Provocative clothes can attract 

 the wrong kind of attention. A Telegraph picture

Sandip Banerjee: Eve-teasing is rising at an alarming rate in the Tollygunge area. It is becoming increasingly difficult for girls or women to move alone on the roads, particularly after sunset, when drunk young men turn teasers. Police have failed to control them. What you are doing as the peoples representative of the area? 

 If girls and women move on the roads in provocative and scanty clothes, what can an MLA do? Parents should pay attention first to the clothes their daughters sport. Who will take the responsibility of controlling eve-teasing if exhibitionism becomes the fashion of daily life? 

 Second, the area is vast, from Jadavpur to Taratala, and police are the responsible authority to check the menace. But how do people, particularly women, expect security from policemen who are now more busy holding soirees at Lalbazar? Anyway, most honest citizens should remain at home in the evenings, engrossed in their favourite evening TV serials.

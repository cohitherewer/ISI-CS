The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 SRK dimple 

 vs Big B baritone

 BlogLog

 He slipped into the Big Bs big 

 shoes as Don and now Shah Rukh Khan will slip into 

 the hot seat vacated by Amitabh Bachchan on the sets of 

 Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC). Will King Khan send 

 the STAR Plus TRPs soaring? Some in the big, wide blog world 

 have their doubts, but most are optimistic about SRKs star 

 power.

 Nat (http://mbnataraj. blogspot.com) 

 feels that it would not be easy to match Amitabhs class, 

 demeanour and diction. Where is the question of Shah Rukh 

 Khan being better at it? He may, over time, develop his 

 own following, if he can come out of Amitabhs looming shadow.

 Amarjit (http://liquid-lounge. 

 blogspot.com) hopes Shah Rukh will be able to create 

 the edge-of-the-seat suspense. Hes got a personality 

 and style of his own, so it will work Bachchans booming 

 baritone will be replaced by Shah Rukhs dimpled smile. 

 Till then, SRK ko lock kiya jaye.

 For Y. Sunita Chowdhary (http://blogs.cinegoer.com) 

 money is the matter. No matter how much actors may blow 

 the love for the craft horn, trying their hardest to convince 

 us that its not the lavish living thats the driving factor, 

 its ultimately all about the money... And why not? People 

 go crazy to see their favourite star on screen twice a year 

 and if he is appearing on TV every day, four days a week, 

 can the fans maintain composure?

 Anant Rangaswamy (http://pigsandwings.blogspot.com) 

 attributes the shows success to the the magical format 

 rather than the charisma of the host: Its the format, 

 stupid! Whether its Shah Rukh Khan or Amitabh Bachchan, 

 KBC WILL get eyeballs.

 In a blog titled The if cricket 

 fails media plan, he observes that if Team India fails 

 to get its act together, where on earth are you going to 

 find those missing eyeballs? Men, Sec A, B, C, D, E, 0-99, 

 will turn to other sources of entertainment.

 Like KBC, of course.

 Asneak peek into the latest Harry 

 Potter film has generated even more attention. An online 

 clip of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, 

 due to release in the middle of 2007, features a 

 kiss between Harry and his girlfriend Cho. Blogs, expectedly, 

 are agog.

 What, you havent seen the most 

 recent Harry Potter movie trailer? Whats wrong with you? 

 asks www.filmsy.com, warning in the same breath about 

 plot spoilers in the trailer.

 Keep your fingers crossed, says 

 www.slashfilm.com, for Hogwarts in 3D. The possibility 

 of the film being converted to 3D from its IMAX version 

 is being explored, according to Greg Foster, chairman and 

 president of filmed entertainment at IMAX Corporation.

 A six-and-a-half-minute preview 

 at www.screen head.com includes interviews with the 

 stars and the new director, David Yates. Theres also a 

 not very revealing plot synopsis and Gary Oldman on the 

 intricate use of wands.

 With the addition of Helena Bonham 

 Carter and Imelda Staunton to a cast boasting the likes 

 of Ralph Fiennes and Emma Thompson, the Potter franchise 

 is becoming a repository for good British (and Irish) actors, 

 says the post on the website.

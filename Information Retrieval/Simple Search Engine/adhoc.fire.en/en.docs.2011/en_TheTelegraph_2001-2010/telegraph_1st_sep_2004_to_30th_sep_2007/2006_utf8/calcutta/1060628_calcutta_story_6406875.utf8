 Agency eyes cash from plot 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is exploring commercial ventures on a vacant plot at its staff quarters complex in Maniktala.

 Part of the proceeds will go towards repayment of provident fund dues to the 2,000-odd employees who will retire in the next two years.

 The 11-acre staff quarters complex is opposite Ultadanga railway station, near Bagmari. The CMDA, which now has 3,800 employees on its pay roll, will construct multi-storeyed buildings on the five-acre vacant plot.

 ?We have decided to commercially develop the five-acre plot. Our aim is to augment our finances, so the employees can benefit,? explained P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of the agency.

 ?During the next two years, around 2,000 employees will retire. But selling the flats, we will have enough money to pay the provident fund dues and other retirement benefits to them,? said another CMDA official.

 According to Baviskar, the agency had earlier planned to construct a flyover on the vacant plot. ?But the project had to be scrapped, as the conditions laid down by interested parties were unacceptable.?

 The Maniktala residential complex came up in 1974, four years after the CMDA was formed to supervise development work in Calcutta and its surroundings, to accommodate those evicted during the construction of the Sealdah flyover. At that time, 387 one-room flats were built.

 But a year after the Left Front government came to power in 1977, the flats were allotted to CMDA employees at a nominal rate.

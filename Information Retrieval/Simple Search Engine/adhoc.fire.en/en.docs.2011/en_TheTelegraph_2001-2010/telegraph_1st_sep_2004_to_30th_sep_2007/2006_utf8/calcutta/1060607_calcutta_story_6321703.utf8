The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 For a few gags more

 Johny Lever in performance 

 In the late 90s, the word in Bollywood was that you could get dates from Shah Rukh Khan, but not from Johny Lever. The man who could have you rolling on the floor as easily in a tense murder mystery as in a romantic comedy was also a top draw at international concerts. Fast forward to 2006 and cliched caricatures, repetitive gags and the evolution of an entire new crop of comedians ? Paresh Rawal, Boman Irani, Rajpal Yadav ? have meant that Johnybhai is no longer the popular man he used to be.

 And so as a logical progression, the man who took his first name from Johny Walker and his surname from the first company (Hindustan Lever) he worked in, is on the telly having turned down the medium many a time in the past. ?If Amitabh Bachchan can come on TV, why not me,? is his stock reply when quizzed at the media meets for his stand-up comedy show on Zee titled Johny Ala Re.

 Just like in the movies, it?s a Johny onslaught on the small screen as well. The man?s also the TV Star of the Month on MTV slated to appear on every show from Semi Girebaal to Piddu the Great.

 Metro caught up with Johny on the MTV sets of Super Select in Mumbai. Wearing the number 13 jersey of Michael Ballack, he is in a World Cup special tete-a-tete with VJ Nikhil, where he rates Mohun Bagan?s World Cup chances higher than Brazil?s.

 ?Chhota parda kyon? Kyonki usse bada parda aaj hai hi nahin,? says Johny, adjusting the special stockings he wears for the show. ?In movies there are 10 heads working at the same time and I am just a toy in the hands of the director. At times, I would be shooting somewhere and people would be writing roles for me somewhere else. Then I would discover that they have just created a caricature of one of my popular characters. Here on TV, I am getting to do things my way? apni masti se.?

 And that masti will go back more than 10 years when Johny first conceived a TV comedy with Pankuj Parashar at the time he was making Jalwa. ?Much before these Jay Lenos and Movers amp; Shakers used to come on TV,? he says.

 ?You will get to see all original ideas, original gags? There will be a lot of variety, bahut saare masalein hain show mein. Then there will be celebrity guests also. Sonu Nigam and Sunidhi Chauhan will be on the show, not only singing but making everyone laugh.?

 So is it a full stop to celluloid? ?I have done 300 films and I am tired of dancing to others? tunes,? pat comes the reply from Johny. ?I recently did 36, China Town after a long time and you will get to see me in Phir Hera Pheri. But now it will be TV for some time. If you want to see my best work in movies, you can always get hold of VCDs and DVDs of Best of Johny Lever.?

 A pause later, Johny adds: ?Maybe I will direct a film some time in the future... a nice old comedy like the films Kishoreda (Kumar) used to make.?

 Endeavouring to capture the spirit of indigenous sensibilities, Primal Force, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, graphics and sculptures mainly by folk and tribal artists of Madhya Pradesh, also aims to highlight the influence of native art conventions as a continuous, surviving tradition. The simple life of tribal communities, the starkness of the countryside, forests, waterfalls and birds organically intertwine in the works to create a unique language of visual art. Essentially, the show offers an insight into the pristine human experience that is still perceptible in the lives of Madhya Pradesh?s local inhabitants. Featuring current works by artists exposed to urban culture, it presents traditional art practices with authentic folk expressions, using contemporary materials. With a rich graphic idiom, the works are reminiscent of primordial qualities central to indigenous art, deeply spiritual, minimalist and, at times, simply enchanting.

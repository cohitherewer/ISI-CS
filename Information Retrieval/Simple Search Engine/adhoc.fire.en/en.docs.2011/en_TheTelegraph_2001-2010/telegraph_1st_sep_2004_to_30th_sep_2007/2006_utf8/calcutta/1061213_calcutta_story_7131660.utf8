The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 North 

Wind comes calling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcuttans wondering what happened to the chill factor could finally get a feel of winter from Wednesday.

 With the conditions turning favourable, we expect cold winds from the north to start blowing into Bengal from Wednesday, said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

 In a couple of days the minimum temperature is likely to dip to normal, which is 14 degrees Celsius, he added.

 Calcutta on Tuesday recorded a minimum temperature of 20.1 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal.

 The warm spell follows a brief bout of chill with the coldest day this season being December 4, when the minimum temperature dipped to 12.6 degrees Celsius.

 The mercury has been on the rise since, thanks to a sudden change in the wind pattern. Moisture-laden winds from the west had swept north India, blocking the passage of the North Wind. This was followed by a cyclonic circulation over Bihar, north Bengal and Sikkim, further delaying the arrival of winter.

 The western disturbance has moved eastwards and the cyclonic circulation is fading, said Debnath. Besides, the cold spell in the northern parts of the country will have an impact.

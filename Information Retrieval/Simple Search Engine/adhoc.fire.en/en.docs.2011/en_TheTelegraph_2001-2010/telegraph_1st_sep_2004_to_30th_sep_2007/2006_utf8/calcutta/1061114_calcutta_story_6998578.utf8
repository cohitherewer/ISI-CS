 Non Grata; Krzysztof Zanussi

 Three decades of acclaimed work and over 50 films could not stop Krzysztof Zanussi from being a tad nervous before the screening of his latest work at Nandan on Sunday afternoon.

 I am a little tense because I want to see how people will receive Persona Non Grata. I am often a jury at festivals but I am most excited when my films are shown, said the robust 67-year-old, back in the city where he has been several times before.

 Persona Non Grata, which premiered in the Venice Film Festival last year, is about a man who has lost faith in love and in his ideals. Persona Non Grata is a Latin word used when you want to kick out a diplomat. I have been with the diplomatic services but this film is not autobiographical, clarified Zanussi, during an interactive session organised by the CU Media Studies at the 12th Kolkata Film Festival.

 Zanussi had started off as a physicist before shifting to philosophy and ending up as a film-maker. The switch to film-making happened after he discovered Ingmar Bergman. I am interested in his vision of the world, he explained.

 Zanussi began making amateur movies in the 50s after a film-making course in the University of Warsaw. He worked for Polish television through the 60s and 70s before emerging as a powerful film-maker in the 80s.

 Among his significant works is Constant Factor, a film that he had partly shot in India in 1980. Some students of FTII Pune were involved in the filming. That will always be very memorable, said Zanussi, who is both interested in and critical of Bollywood.

 Bollywood is not my aesthetics and I dont find any artistic satisfaction in it. They steal from Hollywood. But I dont think Bollywood should be neglected because it reflects some deeply imprinted cultural stereotypes of India

 As for his own films, the Polish director finds enough material in what he sees around him. I write my scripts most of the time and occasionally direct stage plays. I have so many impulses from my travels. I dont adapt novels; I have never had a problem finding a story. I work in many languages and in different countries in order to be able to distribute my films internationally.

 And his best, insists Zanussi, is yet to come. You can say I am prolific. Or maybe I am very insecure, thats why I strive to work as much as possible. I am currently working on my next film Black Son, which will probably premiere in a festival next year. I hope to come back to Calcutta with it some day, smiled the professor of film studies. 

 The Lagaan-beater 

 (Top) A still from No 

 Mans Land; Dunja Klemenc

 Dunja Klemenc had snatched the Oscar from Aamir Khan in 2001. The low-budget No Mans Land, which she had co-produced, beat the mega-budget Lagaan in the last round.

 I think No Mans Land was a better film than Lagaan and we won because it was a simple touching story. People loved it because there are so many wars still being fought, says Klemenc, in town for the screening of Warchild at the 12th Calcutta Film Festival. 

 We didnt make any money out of No Mans Land because we had to put everything into the propaganda, in making people watch our film, says the Slovenia-based Klemenc who shared her Academy Award with four other co-producers from Belgium, Italy, France and the UK.

 The story of two Bosnian soldiers who enter the no mans land during the Bosnia-Herzegovina bombings in 1993 went on to win the Golden Globe for best foreign film and the best screenplay at Cannes.

 A young director who saw No Mans Land wanted Klemenc to produce his film, and so Warchild happened. Again a film set in a strife-torn country, it tracks a young mother in Sarajevo (2005) desperately trying to find her daughter who had gone missing as a toddler during the war a decade back. What follows is a conflict of emotions as she tries to uproot the now 12-year-old from her adopted family in Germany.

 Klemenc wont be able to send Warchild to the Oscars because the actors speak a medley of German, Bosnian and Slovenian. The rules for the Academy Awards have changed. There has to be one major spoken language for a film to enter the competition, she says.

 Klemenc has been a TV producer, costume designer and assistant director before coming into her own as a producer. I like to co-produce as I love to put several people together and work, she says, gearing up to take her latest production Teah to the Berlin Film Festival.

 In her plans figures a film with a bunch of Indian actors to be shot entirely in Europe. Its a very gripping story and the film will show a clash of cultures, says Klemenc, who will certainly pick her cast from India. 

 And no, Aishwarya Rai is not on her mind. I had met Aishwarya Rai at the Cannes Film Festival where she was a jury member, but shes too expensive I believe, smiles Klemenc, whose vote for the best Indian film she has seen in recent times goes to Mira Nairs Monsoon Wedding.

 In India for the first time, Klemenc has kept herself busy at Nandan, besides visiting the Indian Museum, Marble Palace and Victoria Memorial.

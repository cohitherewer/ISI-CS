 Just hot off the tawa, topped with a blob of melting butter and served with kali dal, chhole, raita and pickle. Welcome to Only Parathas, the one-stop vegetarian restaurant with more than 120 varieties of stuffed parathas.

 At 1 AJC Bose Road, leading into Lord Sinha Road, the popular Only Parathas chain promises to be a crowd-puller. And the fun doesnt just stop at parathas, you can drop in with family, friends and colleagues for mocktails, starters, chaats, Punjabi veggies, thali, rice and curries, breads and desserts.

 The ninth outlet nation-wide and the first in Calcutta serves not just fast food but proper meals. Everything and everyone from our production staff to the utensils have come down from Mumbai in order to maintain the same taste and quality, says Akashdeep Agarwal, director of the outlet.

 As you enter the 3,500 sq ft space through the towering glass doors, a live chaat counter greets you. Here you can enjoy a range of spicy tongue-ticklers Samosa Chaat, Paapdi Chaat, Alu Tikki, Dahi Vada, Matar Kulche priced between Rs 36 and Rs 54.

 Then, move into a 65-seater Indian-speciality restaurant or walk up a few steps to the 45-seater banquet or mezzanine section reserved for paratha lovers. 

 Textures like peach, orange, beige and hints of silver have been used on the walls and furniture for a comfortable and smart look. Circular mirrors and mood lighting are used to suit every mood and occasion.

 An average meal for two would not exceed Rs 275 for parathas and Rs 450 for the Indian menu. Parathas come in single or double layers at Rs 89 and Rs 98, respectively, and stuffed with choices and combinations of potato, paneer, cheese, babycorn, mushroom, green peas, pudina, onion, gobi, methi, palak, sprouts the list seems endless. 

 There are options like Jain Parathas for those averse to onion and garlic and also low-calorie parathas for the health-conscious.

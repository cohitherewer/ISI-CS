 Market traders protest new site

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Traders of the 89-year-old College Street market on Monday protested the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s plan to raze the structure and build a mall in its place.

 The CMC has decided to relocate the owners of the 1,200-odd stalls to nearby Marcus Square. Once the mall is ready, they will all be brought back.

 The traders, however, are apprehensive about generating business at Marcus Square and whether they would be allotted adequate space in the new mall.

 The ambience and location of Marcus Square are unsuitable for business, said Bimal Kumar Nag, president of the College Street Byaboshayee Samity. We do not want the centralised trade of the College Street market to suffer. Besides, Marcus Square is prone to waterlogging.

 Alleging that the civic body had not taken the traders into confidence while drawing up the revamp and rehabilitation plan, Nag said: The CMC willing, we are ready to find an alternative address.

 Given the miserable state of the market, the heritage committee of the CMC had agreed to its restoration. According to the plan, a seven-storeyed mall will come up in a joint venture between Bengal Shelter Housing Development and the CMC. Five floors will be dedicated to one-of-its-kind book mall Barnaparichoy.

 The advisory committee for Barnaparichoy, which will house bookstores by national and international publishers, is being chaired by Pratap Chandra Chunder, president of the state heritage commission. Amartya Sen is chief adviser.

 Although the market is about to receive a fresh lease of life, the traders feel neglected. The CMC has not consulted us on anything. Nor have we been shown the plan of the new building. We need a written assurance on the position of individual stalls in the mall. Besides, the CMC will have to make up for the loss the traders may incur at the new location, Nag stressed.

 He also demanded that a monitoring committee be set up with representatives of the College Street Market Byaboshayee Samity, Federation of Traders Organisation, CMC and the developers to keep tabs on the pace and quality of construction. 

 The traders will hold a demonstration in front of the College Street market office on November 22. This will be followed by a strike at the market on November 27.

 We hope the civic body will pay heed to our demands before December 10, said Nag.

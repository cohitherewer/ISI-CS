The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sri Lankans for course

 - Homoeo 

 college feat 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 At a time when reputed institutions in Calcutta are revamping their admission policy to attract foreign students, a state government-run homoeopathic college has taken the lead in this regard.

 The National Institute of Homoeopathy (NIH) in Salt Lake will soon have 10 undergraduate students from Colombo. They will pursue the five-and-a-half-year-long bachelors course in homoeopathic medicine and surgery (BHMS).

 This is a rare achievement. We have never had so many foreign students in our full-time BHMS course, said institute director L.M. Khan. The proposal to offer the course to the Sri Lankan students came from the Centre.

 According to the NIH officials, 25 Colombo-based students had written to the Centre, expressing their desire to pursue the BHMS course in India. The Sri Lankan government backed their request.

 The Centre found our institute the most suitable for the 25 students. But we could take only 10 Sri Lankan students as we do not have the infrastructure to accommodate all of them, explained Khan.

 He claimed European students have expressed interest in pursuing courses offered at the NIH and the Centre is considering the proposal. 

 The formalities for the admission of the Sri Lankan students are yet to be completed, stated the institute director. Permission from the Central Council of Homoeopathy, the national-level apex body of homoeopathy colleges and hospitals, is awaited. The West Bengal University of Health Sciences has given its nod.

 Prestigious institutions like Jadavpur University and Calcutta University hardly enrol foreign students in undergraduate courses. Their presence on Calcutta campuses is limited to courses offering diplomas, certificates and postgraduate degrees.

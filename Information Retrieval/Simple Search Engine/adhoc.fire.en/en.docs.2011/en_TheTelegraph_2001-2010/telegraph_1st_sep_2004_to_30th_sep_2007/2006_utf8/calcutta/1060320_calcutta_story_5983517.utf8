What: Launch of a diamond and coloured stone 

jewellery collection. 

 Where: RR Agarwal Jewellers at Azimganj House at 7, Camac Street.

 When: March 13.

 The collection: Is in sync with the colours of Holi and spring. Jewellery in diamond, 22 carat gold, jadau, kundan, manak and ruby forms a dominant part of the collection. The designs are mostly traditional and antique. The range includes neckpieces, earrings, bangles, wristlets and maangtikas.

 Voiceover: There is a very strong section that demands gift items in jewellery ranging between Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000. So, after gaining a hold on the bridal bazaar, we are now concentrating on capturing that market, said Ratan Lal Agarwal, director of RR Agarwal Jewellers.

 Dessert draw

 What: Eggless Dessert Festival.

 Where: La Patisserie.

 When: Till March 25.

 The spread: The eggless items are a mix of cakes, brownies and pastries. Pastries worth a try include Raspberry White Chocolate Mille Feuille, Baked Yoghurt with Forest Berries Compote, Apple and Sultana Lattice Pie, Berries Combo Torte, Bailleys A La Vienna and Fresh Fruit Tarts in Chocolate Cup.

 Hot pastry delights worth a try are the Peach Pithiviers (a puff and frangipane based dessert) and Caramel Brownie Torte.

 Cakes include Seasonal Fruit Exotic, Blueberry Cheese Cake, Citron-based Cheese Cake and Coffee Hazelnut Thousand Leaves Torte.

 Pocket pinch: While pastries start at Rs 35, the cakes are Rs 230-plus.

 Voiceover: This eggless pastry festival is being organised keeping in mind our vegetarian clientele. The desserts selected are of different bases so that they cater to the tastebuds of all, says sous chef Pratik Roy.

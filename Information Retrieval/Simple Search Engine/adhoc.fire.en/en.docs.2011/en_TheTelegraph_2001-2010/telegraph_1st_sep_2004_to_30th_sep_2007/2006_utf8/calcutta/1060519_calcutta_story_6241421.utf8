 Five days after being released on bail, model-actor Shayan Munshi was back in Barrackpore court on Thursday.

 The key witness in the Jessica Lal murder case was detained at the city airport on his way to Bangkok on May 13.

 His lawyer Tamal Mukherjee strove to sort things out on Thursday, without much success. He appealed to the court to get Shayan?s passport back, but the plea was turned down. 

 Mukherjee then called for a dismissal of the case that was started following Shayan?s arrest under Section 41 of the CrPC (arrest without a warrant).

 The lawyer told additional chief judicial magistrate Gopal Chandra Karmakar that Shayan had complied with all the court directives. The judge stated that a verdict would be delivered by July 28. Inquiry officer of Airport police station Dulal Chandar Sarkar will have to submit a report on the matter within this period.

 ?A few things are still not clear to me. I had turned in my passport the day I was released. The next day I was in New Delhi. On the next two days, May 15 and 16, I appeared before the Delhi Police?s Special Investigation Team. I returned to Calcutta with a note from the team saying that I appeared before it on two days. If this is not compliance, then what is?? asked Shayan, after the day?s proceedings. 

 ?I have seen the message that Delhi Police faxed to Airport police. It simply asks the thana here to hand me over to the economic offences wing of Delhi Police after my detention. Why didn?t the cops send me to Delhi? Why was I taken to the court and then released?? wondered Shayan, awaiting the release of Aahista Aahista, The Bong Connection and Postcards. ?I just want to be with my parents now before moving to Mumbai.?

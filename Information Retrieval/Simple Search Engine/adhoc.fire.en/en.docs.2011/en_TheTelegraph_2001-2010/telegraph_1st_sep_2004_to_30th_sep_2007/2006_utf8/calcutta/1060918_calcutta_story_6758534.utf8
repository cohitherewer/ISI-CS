The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Narrow pavements link to clogged roads

 Shashi Damani: Are the citys roads exclusively for the motorists? If no, then why are you widening the roads by trimming the pavements? 

 I admit that currently, the roads are being widened by trimming the pavements and theoretically, it is a wrong approach. This will lead to problems in future. With the growing volume of vehicular movement, there is an immense pressure on the thoroughfares and the pavements. If the pavements are trimmed, the pedestrians will be forced to walk on the roads, which will further lead to road congestion, traffic jams and then accidents.

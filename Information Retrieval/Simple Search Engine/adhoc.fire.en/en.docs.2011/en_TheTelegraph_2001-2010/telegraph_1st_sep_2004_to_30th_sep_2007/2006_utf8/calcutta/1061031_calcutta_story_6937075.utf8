The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Shop figures drop in influx flop 

 - Fall in NRI numbers hits retail racks in the festive season

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Retail stores around town have suffered a slump this Diwali due to low NRI traffic

 Feluda is flummoxed, Asterix is astounded and Sachin Dev Burman is silenced for they havent got a ticket to ride this season.

 The citys retail racks, which reap a rich harvest during the Durga Puja-Diwali festive window riding the crest of an NRI influx into town, has been hit hard by a slowdown in the seasonal home-bound traffic.

 We have seen a 15 to 20 per cent drop in NRI footfalls compared to last year, confirms Gautam Jatia, CEO, Emami Landmark. At the Lord Sinha Road books-music-gifts shop stop, the sales pattern bears this out.

 DVDs of Ray and Ghatak classics, English translations of the Feluda series, Amar Chitra Katha comics, Tintin and Asterix adventures, and Indian classical tunes some of the pop picks for non-resident shoppers havent moved with the usual momentum this season. One can also make this out by the shopping accent and bill amount.

 The ticket sizes at the cash tills of MusicWorld tell the same story, with October recording a 15-20 per cent slump in sales compared to last year. The NRI shopper, who picks up a huge amount of Indian classical and regional music, usually runs up a bill of Rs 5,000-10,000, as against our average billing amount of Rs 650, says a spokesperson for the Park Street music megastore.

 The citys travel trade has recorded a 10 to 12 per cent slackening in NRI traffic this Diwali. So, its no surprise that retail has been impacted, says Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. The primary reason? The fear of flying out to Asia.

 Punjabi feels the stifling travel restrictions imposed after the Heathrow scare and the Mumbai blasts, coupled with rising hotel tariffs in India as compared to Southeast Asian destinations, have been a huge deterrent.

 There seems to be a subtle internal message from diplomats in western countries discouraging Asians to travel unless its absolutely imperative, which has had an adverse effect on in-bound traffic, a large section of which is made up of NRIs this time of the year, quot; Punjabi laments.

 Sidharth Pansari of Crossword agrees theres a slowdown, but hopes things would pick up during the Christmas-New Year period when the NRI traffic should return to normal.

 MusicWorld, which traditionally records peak business in December having crossed the crore barrier in the last month of 2005 harbours similar hopes.

 Not just the books/music trade, apparel has taken a hit too. Business is down almost 50 per cent over the past three weeks compared to last year and fewer NRIs flying into the city has to be one of the reasons, observes Madhusudan Binani, franchisee of brands like Benetton and Adidas.

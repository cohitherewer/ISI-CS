 Undergraduates on the lookout 

 for part-time courses at Admissions Fair had a whole range 

 of programmes from over 80 institutes across the country 

 to choose from. The three-day fair that ended on June 19 

 drew around 10,000 visitors, a whopping 20 per cent more 

 than the previous year.

 Ruchira Basu, a second-year student of advertising and sales management in Gokhale College, said: ?I am searching for multimedia courses and a preparatory programme for an MBA. I have a year to go before I leave college and I want to use the time well.? 

 Flight crew training, jewellery designing, interior d?cor and marketing were some of the subjects in which the participating institutes had short-term courses. But the top draw was clearly the bio-sciences.

 bio-technology course has been best of all. Overall, we

 courses, which is very satisfactory.? 

 Information about studying in countries like Australia, New Zealand, UK, Russia and China were also provided by representatives of various universities. Courses on offer included engineering, paramedical sciences, information technology, microbiology, travel and tourism, and genetics. Added attractions were education loans and a free admissions guidebook for all visitors.

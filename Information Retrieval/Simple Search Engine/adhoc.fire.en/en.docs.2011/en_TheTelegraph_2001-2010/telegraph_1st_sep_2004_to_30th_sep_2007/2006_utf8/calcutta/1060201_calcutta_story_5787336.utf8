 The Book Fair has become the most prominent annual event in the city. Its objective is to popularise, promote and sell books, but it would become monotonous if nothing else is available at the venue. Lipsmacking fast food is an added attraction for the visitors. In this era of malls and plazas, only fairs offering varied inducements will survive. Each and every visitor is not a bookworm, but their needs cannot be ignored.

 It would become monotonous to visit the Book Fair if nothing except books are sold there. Perhaps the other stalls could be segregated from the book stalls, but they certainly should not be banned.

 Tuli Das,

 Lake Terrace

 No. The sale of other products would dilute the sanctity of the Book Fair. In addition, food stalls result in the dirtying of the fairground.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore 

 No fair, including the Book Fair, can survive without diversifying. Even after so many years, the focus of the Book Fair is solely on books, which has caused a loss of interest among ordinary people. A large number of people visit the fair without any intention of purchasing books. This is apparent from the fact that the number of tickets sold far exceeds the number of books bought. Hence, it is the right time for the authorities to encourage the sale of other creative products along with books.

 Anup Kumar Singh, 

 Cossipore Road

 Lakhs of people visit the Book Fair only for books. They are not drawn by the food sold on the fairground. Though the fair offers a wonderful opportunity to all types of businessmen to sell their wares, I would request the authorities to grant permission only to publishers and book-sellers.

 Nivedita Roy Chowdhury,

 Gopal Lal Thakur Road 

 Nothing except printed matter should be sold at the Book Fair, because the sale of other products result in irreparable damage to the Maidan. We should not forget that sale of edibles had resulted in a devastating fire at the Book Fair not too long ago. That Calcuttans are not yet civilised is evident from the amount of garbage left behind at the site of the Book Fair.

 Joydeep Chatterjee, 

 Shyambazar

 Unless the Book Fair is about books, it cannot be called that. There is no harm in selling other products, but the focus should be on books. The tradition of the fair cannot be abandoned, nor can its role in attracting people to books be forgotten.

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala

 Sale of products other than books should not be allowed at the Book Fair at any cost. There are plenty of stores in the city, so there is no need to turn the only major event for book-lovers into a shopping festival. However, there should be tea and coffee stalls on the fairground to quench the thirst of visitors. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 The authorities should be strict about maintaining the sanctity of the Book Fair. They should not allow vendors or sale of products other than books on the fairground. Food stalls, however, are necessary. 

 Soma Saha, 

 Dum Dum

 I am in favour of products other than books being sold at the Book Fair. Without other products, the Book Fair will be incomplete. The food stalls in addition to offering visitors the opportunity to refresh themselves serve as adda spots. They make the fair more enjoyable.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 A Book Fair is for and of the book-lovers. It is not a place for an outing. But given the span of the fairground, there must be tea stalls and medical facilities.

 Debashis Saha,

 Anath Nath Deb Lane

 The sale of other products should be allowed at the Book Fair, since the venue is huge. There is absolutely no harm in allowing sale of products like greeting cards, paintings, sculptures and handmade products, since they go with the spirit of the Book Fair.

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Budge Budge

 The name Book Fair answers the question. It need not be turned into a colourful festival. At most, tea stalls can be allowed on the fairground.

 Goutam Chandra Das,

 Salt Lake

 Sale of products other than books should be banned at the Book Fair since it results in a lot of commotion. Book-lovers are also distracted by the other stalls.

 D.P. Bhattacharya,

 Sonarpur

 Compared to the number of visitors, the Book Fair venue is too small. If the sale of products other than books is allowed at the fair, then the publishers and book-sellers are going to suffer.

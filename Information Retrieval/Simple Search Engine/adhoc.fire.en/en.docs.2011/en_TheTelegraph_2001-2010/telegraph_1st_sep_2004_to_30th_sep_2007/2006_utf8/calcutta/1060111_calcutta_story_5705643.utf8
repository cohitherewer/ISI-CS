 Images of violence in everyday world

 - Installation takes viewing from personal experience to public one

 It?s like a psychopath?s dream, a dark oppressive world cluttered with images of violence, except that this is the world we live in and contribute to daily ? or so says Chhatrapati Dutta?s latest installation Bone Mill Tales, on display at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture.

 Known for his unusual and exciting projects, Dutta is also one of the few serious installation artists of the city who persists, despite the fact that there still aren?t enough organisations and forums to back such projects. 

 ?Few people are willing to give it space, because installations don?t sell,? said the artist, with conceptions like Iconoclash (2005) and Purulia (1996) to Godhra (2002) and Superimposed Realities (November 2005) to his credit. But this one takes viewing experience to a new high.

 The ground-floor space of the Birla Academy is wrapped entirely in black polythene. One has to raise the curtains to enter. Upfront is a life-size plaster cast of the artist (just the torso) with a bleeding wound in his chest, strung up above a pile of legal tomes, bound volumes of AIR journals. Beyond, more shocking displays of mutilation and dismemberment is an illuminated display board with words like moral turpitude, bones and tales and pictures of surgical scissors. What we then have here is a personal experience that enlarges into a public one.

 This is a world where the smallest sounds are like explosions, ripping at the senses. Yet, as a live performance proved, this is a world where a cacophony of official and legal jargon can numb the senses. 

 During Monday?s performance, an austere legal expert was heard reading everything from the Indian Constitution to random pages of the AIR journals. 

 Accompanied to this monotonous drone, we see the live projection of a plaster cast being made behind a screened off area in real time (which is painfully slow ). 

 At the end of the whole process, however, the person whose cast was being made comes out into the open area and tears off the mould. Textual references to Heine Mueller?s Hamlet Machine, the performance of Rabindra Bharati students Partha and Rathin and the evocative music of Neel Adhikari helped in the show?s success.

 Dutta is already working on another project on Dolly the sheep.

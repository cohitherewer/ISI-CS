 The doctor murder case took fresh twists and turns as the probe inched along on Thursday. The body of Jayanta Ghosh, 62-year-old doctor whose throat was slit on Tuesday morning, was brought to his Salt Lake GD Block home late on Wednesday. The last rites were later performed at Kashi Mitra Ghat.

 Sleuths said Ghosh was ?uncomfortable? with the presence of the youth who turned up at his clinic on Monday afternoon, addressed him as ?Jayantada? and urged him to leave in a car parked in a housing estate nearby.

 This was ascertained by sleuths after interrogating Md Rafiq, a patient present in the chamber. According to the resident of Cossipore, in north Calcutta, the doctor kept his visitor waiting in his small chamber on Raja Manindra Road while he came out to treat the waiting patients.

 Based on Md Rafiq?s description, 

 CID officials have drawn a sketch of the mystery man.

 ?We are trying to find out why the doctor had to step out of his chamber to treat his patients while this man waited inside. This is one among several points that need clarification,? said D.P. Tarenia, inspector-general II, CID.

 Ghosh left his chamber around 1.30 pm with the visitor and went to a car where another person was waiting. The next morning, he was found murdered in Murshidabad.

 The visitor to the chamber was not the one who had called up the family later in the afternoon from an STD booth in Kalyani, sleuths clarified. There were several people who acted as ?links? for the abductors, they added.

 Sleuths feel the abductors could have spent Monday night in Murshidabad, trying to force the doctor to take up a particular case. When their persuasions failed, they decided to ?teach him a lesson?.

 Residents of Sandarpur village in Murshidabad have told police that on Monday night, they had spotted a blue Maruti car doing the rounds. Some had even spotted the car near the bridge from where the doctor was pushed off. 

 Meanwhile, sleuths paid a visit to Ghosh?s widow Anima on Thursday.

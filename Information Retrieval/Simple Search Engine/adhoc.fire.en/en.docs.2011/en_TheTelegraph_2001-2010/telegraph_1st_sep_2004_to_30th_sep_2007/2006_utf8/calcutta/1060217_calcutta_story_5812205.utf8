 Moinuddin would have been dead on the operating table but for Debapriya Kar, senior house staff of Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital?s cardio-thoracic department. The doctor donated blood for the 19-year old and saved his life.

 A zari worker from Domjur, Howrah, Moinuddin was suffering from portal hypertension ? an increase in the pressure in the veins connecting the spleen and intestine with the liver, causing an enlargement of the spleen.

 For the past few months, he had been vomiting blood and suffering from an abdominal pain. He was admitted to a local nursing home, but was shifted to the city hospital as his condition deteriorated.

 At the hospital, the doctors cut out his spleen and placed a graft to connect the veins of the spleen and kidney for proper blood circulation. He had to undergo blood transfusion before the surgery, as his haemoglobin level had fallen because of the blood vomiting.

 However, within five days of the operation, Moinuddin was vomiting blood again. ?The graft was probably not working and the oesophageal vessels were bleeding,? a doctor said. As a result, his haemoglobin level started falling once again. 

 It was a Saturday evening, when the patient?s condition became critical and the doctors felt that immediate intervention was required for his survival. Endoscopic sclerotherapy was carried out to stop the blood vomiting, but it required immediate blood transfusion.

 Moinuddin?s blood group, O+, was not available at the hospital. ?It would have been too late if we were to go to Central Blood Bank, Maniktala, or private blood banks at that hour,? said Abdul Mannan Mallik, his father.

 ?His condition was such that we couldn?t have waited,? agreed Plaban Mukherjee, head of the unit.

 The doctors were clueless about what was to be done. When the family was giving up hope, Kar and another house surgeon with O+ blood, Sumana Samanta, came forward. Kar donated two units of blood and that saved Moinuddin. 

 He is now living a normal life and comes to the hospital for weekly check-ups. ?I cannot repay the debts of the daktarbabu,? said Moinuddin. Kar, however, feels he did the most natural thing. ?It is my responsibility to save the patient,? he said.

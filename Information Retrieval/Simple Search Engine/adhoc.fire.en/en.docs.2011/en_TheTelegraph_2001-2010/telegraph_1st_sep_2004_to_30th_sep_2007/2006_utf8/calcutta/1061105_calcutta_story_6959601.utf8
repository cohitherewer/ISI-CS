 Greg Chappell (extreme 

 right) holds forth during a Team India practice session. 

 (PTI) 

 Greg Chappell was the pet hate 

 of Indian bloggers last week. Ever since the Australians 

 knocked the stuffing out of the Indians in the last Champions 

 Trophy group league match, posts are being put up by the 

 hundreds blasting guru Gregs gambit.

 Vishaal Bhat (http://vishaal 

 bhat.blogspot.com) points out: In 44 of the last 47 

 ODIs, Chappell has fiddled with the Indian batting order. 

 His rigid stance in not accepting the over-experimentation 

 as a mistake is cause for concern. India has only won four 

 of the last 15 ODIs and prospects for the South Africa tour 

 and the World Cup are looking rather bleak.

 He also feels there are too many 

 teams playing first-class cricket in India making it hard 

 for the selectors to choose the best lot.

 The most eloquent attack has come 

 from John Cheeran (http://johncheeran.blogspot.com): 

 I wish Indian cricketers had the time (between shooting 

 commercials) to watch the semifinals of the Champions Trophy... 

 How many Indian fast bowlers will bowl their quota of 10 

 overs on the trot the way McGrath did to strangle the Kiwis? 

 If McGrath represents one end of the chasm between India 

 and class, Chris Gayle symbolises the other end. Gayle is 

 flamboyant, but he is consistent, too. And look at the pathetic 

 sequence of scores Virender Sehwag has notched up over the 

 past two years.

 Cheeran concludes: In Indian 

 cricket we have plenty of maharajs and yuvrajs. But 

 they are without a kingdom; their only trophies are tennis 

 elbows and pulled hamstrings, and they are content to enjoy 

 the privy purses that overflow from the Indian boards cash-laden 

 coffers. 

 Mandira Bedi is another target 

 of fan frustration. And yes, the blog boos from the women 

 are just as loud. The Temptress (http:// fractalenlightenment.blogspot.com) 

 is categorical: The Extraa Innings is a blunder 

 It makes an absolute mockery of the game... Charu Sharma 

 is bearable, but Mandira really needs to start making some 

 sense. Her advise is chuck the glamour factor, get some 

 sophistication. The majority of the cricket fans want to 

 hear the experts speak.

 If cricket must be married with 

 entertainment, Kartik Kannan Iyer (http://katchucrap.blogspot.com) 

 suggests a panel comprising Mandira Bedi, Shonali Nagrani, 

 Arjun Singh and George Bush, because he cant think of 

 a greater set of lunatics providing entertainment to us 

 before and after a cricket match.

 After guru and glam, the blog 

 gun takes aim at the board. Razib Ahmed (http://www.indianraj.com) 

 says: If India performs badly, they (board officials) cannot 

 just say that the players are to blame. They must accept 

 responsibility, too.

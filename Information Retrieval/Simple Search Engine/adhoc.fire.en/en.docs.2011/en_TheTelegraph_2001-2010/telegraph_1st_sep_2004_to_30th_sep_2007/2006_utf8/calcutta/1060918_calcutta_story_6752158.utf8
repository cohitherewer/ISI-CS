Life

Song of a confused desi

Sex amp; the city

INSPIRED BY A UK-BASED GROUP OF INDIAN 

ORIGIN PERFORMING POETRY, CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA PENS A FEW LINES ABOUT 

HER IDENTITY CRISIS

Last week I attended an evening of performance poetry 

by a UK-based group of Indian origin. They were not sure where they came from 

 East Africa, from where they escaped to Britain, Britain, or India. They inspired 

me to do my own poetry, on who I am. If an NRI is confused, the desi is more so. 

Here I go: 

The Desi Backlash

Oh oh oh oh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh 

No no no no 

I am the real slim desi 

I am the real slim desi 

I am the real schizo desi 

 And so am I. 

I am the real slim desi 

My father-mother desi 

My cousin-brother desi 

But who am I? 

I was born in Benachiti

I was bred in Baguiati

I have an aunt in Cincinnati 

Macavity, Macavity, theres no one like Macavity, 

For hes a fiend in feline shape, a monster of 

depravity. 

I can deify gravity. 

I can call it Karmashakti. 

You may meet me in a by-street, you may see me in 

the square 

But when a crimes discovered, Macavitys 

not there. 

Oh yeah! 

Park Street Kabaristan 

Ragamuffin bhangra star 

Lounge bar resto bar 

Hookah bar Boubazar

Karl Marx in Central Park 

Next to him is Nazrul bust 

Westside Pantaloons 

Bras that go with noodle straps

Pre-Puja traffic jam 

Shopping rush, Peter Cat

Father-mother thought control 

Boyfriend-girlfriend no control 

Full fathom five thy father lies; 

Of his bones are coral made; 

Those are pearls that were his eyes, 

Nothing of him that does fade 

Sa Re Ga Ma Li Champs 

Bappi Lahiri is their judge 

Federer Sharapova 

Fair thee well Navratilova 

Sania tops on Howrah shelves 

Enzyme-free turtlenecks 

Lage Raho Munnabhai 

Bombay blasts bye bye 

ish shorshe tetrazzini

Brussels sprouts biriyani 

Paneer tikka macaroni 

Fusion food many many 

Chanachur Pepsi Cokes

Ciao Chill Hi there folks 

Dada is no fiasco 

Its the time to disco

City Centre Bangla band 

Chondrobindu Bhumi means land 

Orkut and online friends 

Will they come in my distress? 

MBA, corporate career 

Boss knows best have no fear 

Pink Floyd, ganjar taan

Thats only for weekend fun! 

We didnt start the fire 

It was always burning 

Since the worlds been turning 

We didnt start the fire 

No we didnt light it

But we tried to fight it

Hai agar dushman dushman 

Zamana gam nahin gam nahin 

Koi aye, koi jaye,

Koi aye, koi jaye,

Hum kississe kam nahin, kam nahin. 

I am the real slim desi 

I am the real slim desi 

I am the real schizo desi

And so am I! 

And I am not even slim. 

Ooh ooh ooh oooh

Uh Uh Uh Uh 

Oh oh Oh oh

Hun hun hun hun 

Ooh ooh ooh oooh

Uh Uh Uh Uh 

Oh oh Oh oh

Hun hun hun hun. 

Yeah!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hunt on for missing court files

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 For the first time in its 165-year history, the precinct of Calcutta High Court has come under a police probe.

 The detective department has launched an investigation into the alleged theft of at least 100 files from the mandamus section, where documents related to orders issued to the state government are stored. A team of sleuths, two sniffer dogs in tow, did the rounds of the court building on Tuesday.

 ?Files stacked on 12 racks in the section are missing. This was noticed by an employee, who immediately got in touch with the court administration. A police complaint was later lodged,? said an officer of Hare Street police station.

 High court registrar (administration) Raghunath Ray admitted that police have started an investigation into the complaints of theft, but refused to give details. ?My statements may hamper the probe,? he claimed.

 Several litigants had complained that their cases were not being taken up for hearing as the relevant documents could not be located in the mandamus section.

 ?A week ago, a widow had approached the department, alleging that a file containing orders asking the government to clear pension and other retirement benefits of her late husband had gone missing. The contempt case she filed following the government?s failure to carry out the order was not being heard because of the unavailability of the file,? the officer added.

 Similar complaints have been lodged with the court administration, prompting it to approach police for an immediate probe.

 Files missing from the mandamus section is not a recent phenomenon, said advocate Sailendu Rakshit. 

 ?The files relating to former chief minister Jyoti Basu?s son Chandan could not be traced for 16 years. The documents surfaced only after the chief justice asked the registrar to take all possible steps to locate them,? recalled Rakshit.

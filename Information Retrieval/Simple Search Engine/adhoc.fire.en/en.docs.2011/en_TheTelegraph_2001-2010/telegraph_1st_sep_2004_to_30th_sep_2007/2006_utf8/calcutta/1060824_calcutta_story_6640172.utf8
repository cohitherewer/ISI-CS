The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Same names return

 - And 

 the young artists... 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 A work by Paritosh Sen

 The same-name phenomenon has hit most private galleries in the city. There are just a fistful of artists whose works keep circulating in all of them. Although Sanskriti Gallerys current exhibition has the works of quite a few names of young practitioners from outside the city, the best works are those of the most familiar names.

 To begin with, the paintings of the younger lot of artists. S. Harsha Vardhanas works evoked a sense of dj vu. One wonders where one has seen them before. Then, suddenly, one remembers that they remind one of the paintings of his illustrious father.

 Manisha Gera Baswanis two works immediately catch the eye, if only because they are in hot pinks and oranges, with a mirror each to their credit. Their surfaces are painted over with geometric designs one sees in lattice work in windows.

 Rajeswara Raos paintings with acrylic on acrylic sheets make light of advertisements, what with a woman with thick lips and wearing thick lenses riding a bicycle, and a doggie licking the amorous couple bathed in the light of a lamp, instead of the rising sun. Vanita Guptas calligraphic strokes are neat, but they are too much like those of her better-known predecessors.

 So, we are left with a mixed bag of senior artists. Laxma Gouds beautiful womans features are defined with foliage, Dryad style. Slats in orange, red and green cover Velu Viswanadhans canvas. This artist paints variations of almost the same composition with subtle changes in the palette. 

 Paritosh Sens bird with a brilliant blue neck and a sly look in its eyes is another brilliant drawing by the senior artist. In another work, he visualises himself as a bust sitting on a pedestal while a woman cant take her eyes off it. Shuvaprasanna used to use charcoal to evoke the sooty roofscape of the city. Now, he uses the same material to draw a male nude, playing a flute in the manner of Krishna.

 There are a few drawings by Jogen Chowdhury, a beautiful Ganesh Haloi and an Akbar Padamshee watercolour.

 Bimal Kundus bronze dog is not a starving cur. It is a credible depiction of a member of the canine species.

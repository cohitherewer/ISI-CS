The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Citizen call to curb extortion

 MOHAMMAD SOHRAB, Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA from Burrabazar, met readers of The Telegraph at his office on Friday to answer their queries. 

Participants included Arif Sultan, Anil Gupta, R.Sonkar, Pravin Dhanania, Md. Akram, Sahid Ahmed Khan, Navin Mishra

Anil Gupta: Burrabazar area has grown into a haven for extortionists. Traders are regularly being threatened for money. In most cases, the traders avoid lodging complaints with the police as the cops harass the complainants. We have brought the matter before the local councillors and the MLA but nothing has been done in this regard. Can you help us?

 I have received two such complaints. One Mohan Sonkar had approached me for my permission to collect money from the traders. I had warned him and also asked the traders not to give him money or any other extortionist in the area. 

 Please inform me as soon as you get such calls. Now identifying the callers is not a difficult task. We can always trace out the culprit from the cellphone records. 

R. Sonkar: One of our fellow traders, Om Sharma, was forced to pay up money by the local goons, for changing the wall tiles of his office. Nowadays even for changing the window panes, the traders are forced to cough up money. Can we expect some relief following the change in political leadership?

 I will soon convene a co-ordination meeting with the police officers of the five police stations in my constituency. Representatives of traders associations and inspectors-in-charge of Jorasanko, Burrabazar, North Port Police Station, Hare Street and New Market will be asked to attend the meeting.

Arif Sultan: Thousands of people visit the Mechhua area daily . Many of them are from the districts and other states. But there are no pay- and-use toilets in the area. In the absence of toilet facilities, people stet the surroundings. Have you taken any step in this regard? 

 I have already taken up the matter with mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and the mayoral member, Abu Sufiyan,who is overseeing the pay-and-use toilets. I will allocate some money from my MLA local area development fund. A suitable site has also been selected. Three pay-and-use toilets will be built in the Brabourne Road and Strand Road area.

Praveen Dhanania: Power-cuts and load-shedding have become regular feature in this business hub of the city. Though the CESC earns a huge revenue from the area, it has never taken any steps to replace the old electric power supply lines and transformers. Power trips daily because of the heavy load on the power distribution installations. Can you take up this matter with the CESC?

I would like to inform you that I have already spoken 

to the CESC and I was given the assurance that two new transformers, one at Cotton 

Street and the other near Satyanarayan Park, will be installed soon.

Sahid Ahmed Khan: Is there any solution to the hawker menace in the Burrabazar and Mecchua area ? Recently, I have noticed that hawkers are coming from elsewhere and setting up stalls on the pavements or the carriageways. A section of hawker leaders are virtually selling the pavements and carriageways.

 It is for the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to decide whether hawkers will be allowed to sit on the pavements. Personally, I want eviction of hawkers with a proper rehabilitation scheme.

How can you talk about the rehabilitation of the hawkers, who are law-breakers and are creating a mess in the city?

 I want to point out a simple thing. Hawkers haven?t encroached on and filled up the pavements overnight. When the authorities have allowed them to sit there for so many decades, it is their moral responsibility to relocate them, if they want clear pavements. 

Naveen Mishra: There are many illegal constructions in the areas like Gastrin Place, India Exchange Place Old China Bazar Street and Dalhousie. A section of political leaders and civic officials have given their nod to the illegal constructions and extension of buildings. For example an eight-storey building has come up on Hare Street, though only six floors (ground floor plus five) were sanctioned.

I have brought the matter to the notice of the civic 

authorities and they are taking steps against the owner of the building. If necessary, 

I will write to the mayor.

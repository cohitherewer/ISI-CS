The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Defunct mill 

 to mega mart 

 - Mammoth joint-venture retail address ahead on VIP Road 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 City Centre has become a hugely popular hangout, the Mani Squares and Ffirangi Bazaars are nearing completion on the EM Bypass, and now VIP Road is ready to embrace a mammoth shopping-cum-entertainment stop.

 To be developed as a 50:50 joint venture between Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd and city-based builders? consortium the Diamond Group, the project with a built-up area of 500,000 sq ft, will house a hypermarket, departmental store, multiplex, branded retail, entertainment and food court.

 The location provides another instance of failed industry being replaced by retail realty ? the idle campus of the defunct Eastern Paper Mills, off the Ultadanga crossing, which was shut down in the Eighties and referred to the BIFR.

 ?We have entered into an agreement with the owners of the closed paper mill to buy out 200 cottahs of the 23 bighas of prime land lying unutilised for over two decades now,? A.N. Shroff, who heads Diamond Group, told Metro.

 The decks for the transaction, involving over Rs 44 crore, that will enable the owners of Eastern Paper Mills to pay off their creditors, were cleared by the Company Court on Friday, when it stopped ?permanently winding-up operations on the premises?.

 Besides the 500,000 sq ft of constructed area with a 280-ft frontage, the G+3 structure will also have a 150,000-sq-ft double basement for parking. The partners hope to break ground by June and complete construction in 24 months.

 The VIP Road project will be financed through the Horizon International Fund, one of the two funds launched by Kshitij Investment Advisory Co. Ltd, the asset management arm of Pantaloon Retail, revealed Shishir Baijal, CEO of Kshitij.

 Following Pantaloon Retail?s strategic-alliance pact with CapitaLand Retail India Investments Pte Ltd, signed on Wednesday, the Singapore-based property major will pump ?substantial funds? into the VIP Road mall, the first project in the city to benefit from this tie-up.

 By dint of the arrangement with the Pantaloon Group, CapitaLand Retail India is committed to invest $75 million in Horizon.

 ?We are yet to finalise the design solution and finer details, but it would surely be one of our most prestigious projects in Calcutta,? said Baijal. 

 Kshitij, managing a total capital of $330 million, plans to leverage Pantaloon?s expertise in retail to create ?quality retail infrastructure for consumers and value to investors?.

 The Horizon fund, with a corpus of $ 250 million, is in the process of being raised. It has a fund life-cycle of 20 years and targeted exit in four-five years.

 The VIP Road venture will be the Diamond Group?s second project with Pantaloon Retail. The duo is also developing the Diamond City North mall on Jessore Road, which has a four-screen cineplex by INOX.

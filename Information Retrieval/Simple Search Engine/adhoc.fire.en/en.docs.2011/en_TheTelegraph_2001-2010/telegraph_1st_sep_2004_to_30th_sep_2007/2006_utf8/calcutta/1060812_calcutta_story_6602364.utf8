Niva Arts, which runs the renovated Tapan theatre 

on Sadananda Road, had made an earnest effort to revive commercial theatre with 

the play Janani last year. The show fizzled out despite the star cast of 

Supriya Chowdhury and Madhabi Mukherjee.

But the theatre group seems to have staged a successful 

comeback this time, with Bhalobashi Tai. Under veteran actor Santu Mukherjees 

direction, the production has been witnessing a healthy footfall at Tapan theatre 

since its premiere in the last week of July. Two shows of the play are slated 

every Sunday at the south Calcutta address.

Bhalobashi Tai has a sprinkling of TV actors 

(with Chaiti Ghosal a star draw, apart from Santu Mukherjee), song-and-dance, 

and emotional highs. Set in a zamindari household on the citys fringes, 

the story revolves around the unrequited love of two idealist youths (Santu and 

Chaiti) who drift apart under family pressure. A tyrannical father, a caring aunt 

and two brothers, each with their own little tales, make up the bustling family 

scene. The second half zooms into a prostitutes quarters, where a young Chaiti 

mouths Tagores poetry and expletives in the same breath. Adding a twist to the 

tale are a scheming, vengeful vamp, mistaken identities and some tear-jerking 

moments.

The cast also features TV actors Arijit Guha and Bobby 

who support the act with strong performances as the autocratic father and as young 

Chaitis friend, respectively.

Though a lot less cerebral than highbrow group theatre, 

Bhalobashi Tai is drawing the crowds with a well-sketched story (the script 

is by Surajit Banerjee, who also pens jatra palas) broken up into short 

crisp scenes, much like a soap.

The scenes have been kept short and racy because 

the pattern of our life has changed. People lack the patience to sit through a 

three-hour play. Its best if you can keep the play at two-and-a-half hours, 

says Santu, who plays the lead role of an ageing businessman in search of his 

lost love.

I did commercial theatre 21 years ago. That was in 

Projapati which ran from 1983-85. Lets see if we can rekindle peoples 

interest in this kind of theatre As for the plays, audiences prefer a bit of 

all the nine rasas in the stories. You have to make sure that they dont 

get bored, so I am putting more stress on the performances. But its difficult 

to sustain this theatre as you need known faces and there are not too many people 

who want to work here as the money is not very good, he adds.

Of the Tollywood lot who could be roped in, Chaiti, 

who had started her acting career on the stage at age six, was more than game. 

I missed theatre all this while and I always felt that I should take up theatre 

again at some point, says Chaiti, shouldering the double role of the upright 

schoolteacher in love with Santu, and then the prostitute daughter. 

Bhalobashi Tai is not Chaitis first brush 

with commercial theatre. Having been directed by Tripti Mitra in Raktakarabi, 

Chaiti had a small stint in father Shyamal Ghoshs commercial production Thakurda 

in the mid-80s. I have done roles of high-society call girls before but never 

anything like this. My character is a grassroots prostitute and I have learnt 

a lot by observing women on the streets I thought this was a character that one 

could make a mark with, stresses Chaiti, happy to keep her Sunday tryst with 

the stage.

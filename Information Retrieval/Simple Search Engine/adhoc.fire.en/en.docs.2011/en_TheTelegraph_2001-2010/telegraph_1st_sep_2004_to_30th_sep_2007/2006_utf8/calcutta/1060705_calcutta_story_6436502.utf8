 ?I?m Bikram Choudhury, otherwise known as the Bengal tiger or the English bulldog. All these allegations against me are bullshit,? proclaims a smiling Bikram Choudhury, relaxing in his Rashbehari Avenue home on Tuesday afternoon. And he has reason to roar, or growl. ?I am going to sue the city of Los Angeles and the district attorney?s office for damages of $10 million for the harassment they have caused me.?

 In Calcutta for four days to visit his mother, the yoga expert with an A-list clientele based in LA rubbished the citations ? not charges ? levelled against him by the city attorney?s office for cramming people into overcrowded rooms and flouting fire-safety norms.

 ?I have been a victim of harassment for the past five-and-a-half years? So now, I am going to establish my yoga university and a healing centre in a hotel in Honolulu that is offering me 25,000 sq ft of space. But I am not moving out of LA. I am already building more yoga schools in the city,? announces the 60-year-old, who has found ?a business partner? in Michael Jackson. ?He has given me his ranch, Never Neverland. I am setting up a retirement home and healing centre on it.?

 LA, says Choudhury, gave him the stamp of approval before he began using the premises. ?The final permit was pending because I didn?t have enough parking space, so I rented a neighbouring parking area. But then, the mayor changed and I didn?t get my permit,? he claims.

 The 40,000-sq-ft space was developed by him ?in stages? to accommodate his growing number of pupils. But he had to break one bathroom four times that cost him a total of $800,000, because of alleged plumbing problems. ?Suddenly last month, they brought 42 citations against me. They were all minor, inconsequential charges, which I cleared in 48 hours.? The fire exits were never a problem, he claims. ?By California law, there should be two exits in a room of that size, both opening outwards. I had four, two opening outwards and two inwards.?

 He claims that city attorney Rocky Delgadillo is upset with him because the celebrity yoga guru didn?t agree to support his bid for the district attorney?s office. The parting shot of the guru, who will be back in town next month for his son?s thread ceremony: ?When god fails, people come to me as the last hope. My name makes money. They cannot do anything to me.?

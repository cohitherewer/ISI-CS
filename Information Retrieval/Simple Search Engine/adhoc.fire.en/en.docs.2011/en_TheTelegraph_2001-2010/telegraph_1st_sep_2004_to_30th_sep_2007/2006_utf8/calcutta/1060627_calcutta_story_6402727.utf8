 Fee hike at tech institutes

 - One-time payment during admission introduced

 Engineering students in private colleges will have to pay more from this year.

 The state government on Monday decided to increase the annual tuition fees in private engineering colleges from Rs 31,200 to Rs 41,000. 

 The students will also have to make a one-time payment of Rs 3,000 at the time of admission. 

 The hike was implemented on the basis of the recommendations of a committee set up two years ago to review the fee structure in the 40-odd private engineering colleges in the state. Though the institutions do not receive state aid, they have to abide by a fee structure set by the government.

 ?The revision of tuition and other fees in private engineering colleges was on hold for a long time. The new fees will be charged from the current academic session, slated to begin next month,? said director of the technical education department Sajal Dasgupta.

 The admission process is currently on at the engineering colleges. Seats are being allotted to students on the basis of their rank in the state joint entrance examination. 

 Copies of the government order were sent to the colleges on Monday. The managements of the institutions have been demanding an increase in the fees for a long time.

 ?The fees had not been increased since 1999. As we have to depend only on the fees to run our institution, an increase was necessary. We are happy that the government has finally announced the hike,? said Subir Chowdhury, director, BP Poddar Institute of Management and Technology.

 The Supreme Court had ruled in the late 1990s that all state governments should review the fees charged by the private engineering colleges and take appropriate steps.

 In 2003, the Bengal government had set up the fee structure committee, complying with the apex court?s recommendation. The committee had reportedly completed the review of the fee structure and readied its report by March.

 According to sources close to the committee, the government delayed the fee hike announcement to avoid criticism before the Assembly elections.

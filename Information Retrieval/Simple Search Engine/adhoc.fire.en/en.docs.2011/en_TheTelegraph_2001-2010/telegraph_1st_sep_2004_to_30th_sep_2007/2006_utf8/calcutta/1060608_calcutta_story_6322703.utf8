 Take a look: The concept store from MobileNXT, Indias first mobile retail chain, is offering handsets across manufacturers, connections across service providers and add-ons like ringtone downloads and mobile photo printing.

 The 600 sq ft store, inaugurated by actress Swastika Mukherjee, is the fourth MobileNXT outlet in the country after Gurgaon, Mangalore and Ahmedabad. The company plans to set up two stores in Siliguri and one each in Asansol and Durgapur in this financial year.

 Voiceover: The handsets are not arranged according to brands but according to consumer needs, said Vijay Menon, CEO of the Bangalore-based company. If you are a music fan, you can head for the MusicNXT section, or, for PDAs and smartphones you can take a look at the WorkNXT section, Menon said.

 In the next one year, we are looking at 31 stores and a turnover of Rs 48 crore, while in three years we are planning 170 stores and a turnover of Rs 400 crore, he added.

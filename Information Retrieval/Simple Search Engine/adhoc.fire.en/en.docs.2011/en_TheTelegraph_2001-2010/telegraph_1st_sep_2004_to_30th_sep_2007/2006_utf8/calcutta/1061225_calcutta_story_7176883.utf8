 The woollies are out and so are the wineglasses and plum cakes. The homely Christmas tree stands tall and Santa chokes the chimney with a bagful of goodies. The season of goodwill hunting and mistletoe moments is here. GoodLife unwraps the seasons good ol shopping specials.

 Trees

 This year, dark green artificial grass seems to be the popular choice. Landmark offers imported Christmas trees from China. They start from Rs 89 and the tallest tree, at 20 feet, comes for Rs 12,500. At Archies, trees with fibre-optic lights are new. At New Market, both glossy and glazed Xmas trees are doing the rounds.

 Decorations

 Deck the halls with boughs of holly goes a popular Christmas jingle. But its not just holly you can pick up, theres a variety to choose from. Dry flowers, painted acorns, red berries set against orange leaves and Xmas streamers are everywhere. Glitter balls, cupids, angels, doves, Christmas banners and that special star for the treetop are pop picks.

 At Party Fun in Forum, handmade decorations and imported wooden decorative pieces from Bangkok stand out as sleighs, snowmen and reindeer. The store also takes orders to decorate your home or workplace. 

 At Landmark, fancy bells with flowers and cascading bells that touch the floor are available in all colours of the rainbow. At Archies, giant bells are priced at Rs 2,500. A set of six small decorative bells comes for Rs 180. 

 On Free School Street, paper decorations dominate. Big paper bells with borders of rose embellishment and ribbons are available. Chinese lanterns also light up the space.

 Besides the usual fairy lights, there are crystal lights, rope lights, battery-operated flashing sticks and lights shaped like red berries and snowmen. They range from Rs 89 to Rs 329 at Landmark. 

 If balls and stars are meant for the tree, wreaths make their way to walls and doorways. Made of artificial grass with white snowy tips and interspersed with trumpets, they sure are pretty picks.

 Santa dolls

 Santa stuffed toys are quite a craze. They start from Rs 79 at Landmark and from Rs 99 at Archies (Forum and City Centre) and run into a few hundreds. Although red is the colour, Santa also sports golden robes this year. 

 Different poses of Santas on stilts, sitting on a wooden chair and carrying bags full of gifts are fast flying off the racks. Giant musical Santas that dance and walk cost Rs 3,599 at Archies. 

 Six-inch mini-Santas to five-feet dolls, balloons that blow into Santas and Santa cut-outs with mandolins and reindeers are on display along Free School Street. 

 Accessories

 At the stroke of midnight its time for you to play Santa for your kids. Besides dressing up your Christmas tree, you can also dress yourself up with bright Santa caps and stockings.

 At Landmark, even antler bands in red and green are available. At Pantaloons (Camac Street) and Archies (City Centre and Forum) there are plain and printed Santa caps bordered with snowy fur. They are priced between Rs 25 and Rs 100.

 Santa faces with fuzzy white beards come for Rs 45 at Giggles on Park Street. But if youre looking for the complete Santa dress robe, belt and boots there arent too many around.

Golden oldies Jim Reeves and Engelbert Humperdinck sing your favourite jingles. Flying off the racks is a special edition, Joy to the World, comprising popular Christmas carols, priced at Rs 99.

 SHAUN KENWORTHY

 Is 

 football the one thing that truly unites the world? I think 

 so, though Im not a big fan myself. Its the 

 only sport that seems to have no class boundaries (unlike 

 cricket, golf or tennis). Perhaps something as ridiculous 

 as football (Im a rugby man myself) will save the 

 human race.

 Ok, I know this is a bit long-winded, 

 but I wanted to give a quick insight into the World Cup 

 hosts eating and drinking habits. The Germans, like 

 all Europeans, are great lovers of food with their heels 

 dug deep into tradition. Their food is very meat-based ? 

 hearty stews and roasts with simple accompaniments like 

 boiled potatoes and vegetables. Meals will usually be washed 

 down with beer or wine, but pastries and desserts tend to 

 be eaten throughout the day as snacks, with thick black 

 drip coffee.

 German, Swiss and Austrian pastry 

 chefs were probably the first to really refine the art of 

 pastry-making and even today, an apprenticeship in German, 

 Austrian or Swiss confectionery and bread-making is high 

 up on the culinary hierarchy. Black Forest Gateau, Scrummy 

 Chocolate Cakes and Bavarian Creams, Apple Cakes and Strudel, 

 Sacher Torte and Linzer, Fondant Fancies and Butter Cream 

 Pastries, a lot of which you will only see in Germany, Switzerland 

 and Austria today.

 And where would the Indian confectionery 

 scene be without the humble Black Forest pastry? But its 

 miserable to see whats become of this great dessert 

 since its arrival in India. Its changed almost beyond 

 recognition to be more commercially viable and has ended 

 up as just a bit of dry, not a very chocolatey sponge with 

 some cream (usually synthetic) and a few canned cherries! 

 Abominable! Ill give you my recipe later for the best 

 one youll eat.

 German wines tend to be sweeter 

 and spicier than those of other European nations and are 

 pretty much looked down upon by most. I, too, think they 

 are a bit too sweet and a lot of Indian wines seem modelled 

 on them. Riesling, the queen of German wines, is sweet, 

 fruity and spicy and would tend to go better with pudding 

 than savoury things. If you are a Chardonnay or dry wine 

 aficionado, you are better off sticking to the pride of 

 the nation: beer.

 Proper Black Forest Gateau

 For the sponge, beat together 

 340 gm each of castor sugar and butter until light and fluffy. 

 Beat in six eggs one at a time, fold in 240 gm self-raising 

 flour (220 gm flour, 20 gm baking powder) and 100 gm cocoa, 

 which have both been sifted. Lightly butter a 20 cm loose-bottomed 

 cake tin, dust with a little plain flour and shake off the 

 excess flour.

 Line the base of the tin with 

 greaseproof paper and spoon in the mixture, bake in the 

 pre-heated oven at 180O C for 30 to 40 minutes till firm 

 and springy. Insert a clean skewer into the middle of the 

 cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready. Remove from 

 the oven and leave to cool in the tin with a damp cloth 

 over it for 15 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. 

 This will keep it lovely and moist.

 For the filling, you will need 

 300 gm sour black cherries (canned are best), which have 

 been drained. Retain the syrup and add to it a good couple 

 of measures of kirsch or rum. Once cool, using a large serrated 

 knife, slice the cake horizontally into three equally-sized 

 rounds. Place each round on a chopping board and spoon the 

 cherry syrup evenly over each disc and leave to soak. 

 For the chocolate topping, heat 

 200ml of the double cream then add 200g of good quality 

 chocolate pieces. Remove from the heat and stir gently until 

 the chocolate is melted and smooth. Allow to cool in the 

 refrigerator. (Dont worry, it will thicken.) Whip 

 400 ml of double cream until thick. Spread one of the cake 

 discs with half of the cream then cover with half of the 

 cherries, pressing them in lightly. Top with the second 

 disc of sponge and repeat the process, finishing with the 

 third disc. 

 Using a palette knife, spread 

 the chocolate topping thickly on top of the cake, so that 

 the chocolate oozes down the sides. Sprinkle with a few 

 chocolate shavings and leave the cake to set in the refrigerator. 

 Finally slice into large wedges 

 and stuff your mouths!

 What: Fosters Poolside Beer and Barbecue party. Where: Space Circle.

 When: February 19, 4:30 pm onwards.

 The party: An open-air event was a complete family affair. Club members and guests lounged around on the club lawns dotted by tiny lamps on the trees and walls. Children ran about playing their games, and some even took a dip in the pool. Elders chose to sit and savour their drink, chat with friends and family, and enjoy the sound of the band Span churning out old English numbers.

 Sip bite: The food corner was a mix of non-vegetarian and vegetarian delicacies. The menu included Paneer Barbecue Sticks, Stuffed Tomato Barbecue, Tandoori Gobi, Barbecue Pomfret, Chicken Kalmi Kebab and Dangri Prawn. With every plate of Barbecue, there was a complimentary Fosters Pint. The busy bar counter served Fosters Beer, whisky, vodka, soft drinks and juice.

 Voiceover: With the summer setting in slowly, this is the perfect time to enjoy the Sunday evenings with good food and music, said M.J. Robertson, CEO, Space Circle.

 All that jazz

 What: The adventurous sounds of Latin jazz fusion by The Future Prophecies Quartet.

 Where: Hyatt Regency.

 The show: The Future Prophecies Quartet is a bunch of highly talented young musicians. Drummer Richie Barshay has even been a member of the Herbie Hancock Quartet, pioneers of the jazz funk sound that dominated the mid-Seventies. The sound for the evening comprised an eclectic mix of Latin compositions, with at least half the material having been composed by various members of the quartet themselves. The melodic section of the band consisted of brothers Zaccai and Luques Curtis, key-boardist and bassist. Both have been playing since the age of five and are trained in jazz, classical and salsa. At the centre of this refined maelstrom was percussionist Reinaldo De Jesus Corchado, a veteran of the jazz festival circuit.

 The Future Prophecies Quartets repertoire featured various styles and moods, but with a common Latin undercurrent influencing each track. The audience, initially somewhat reserved, was quite caught up in all that jazz by the time the formal concert came to an end. The musicians then struck the opening chords to Santanas seminal Latin record Oye Come Va.

 Sip n bite: A bar, with finger food, especially set aside for the event was the centre of attraction before the concert.

 Voiceover: Many of these rhythms come straight from the villages of the place where Im from. A lot of the music in Puerto Rico has descended from West African music when the slaves arrived, explained the portly percussionist, Reinaldo.

 He man

 What: Sub-contests of the 12th Grasim Mr India contest.

 Where: Golds Gym.

 When: February 17.

 The contests: The 12th Grasim Mr India contest kicked off with three sub-contests ? Golds Gym Grasim Best Physique, Grasim Best Smile and Grasim Mr Photogenic. 

 Judges included actress Pallavi Chatterjee, photographer Indranil Mukherjee and Golds Gym director Divya Himatsingka.

 The 30 finalists walked the ramp showing off their bodies for the Best Physique award, while the next hour saw the three judges scanning the portfolios of the contestants for the Mr Photogenic and the Best Smile titles. Contestants were asked questions ranging from their hobbies to why they got into modelling.

 The winners: After the two-hour-long judging session, it was time to declare the winners. The first runners-up award for Best Physique went to Calcutta boy Neeraj Surana, while Gaurav Sachdeva from Mumbai won the second runners-up title. The winners were decided on the basis of best overall physique and vital statistics.

 Mir Muzamil of Jammu and Kashmir won the first runners-up title for Grasim Best Smile and the second runners-up title went to Gaurav Sachdeva from Mumbai.

 Two Delhi boys were declared winners in the Mr Photogenic category. While the first runners-up award was won by Yatin Sonic, Vikram Malhan bagged the second-runners up award.

 The final winners in each category will be awarded on the final day of Grasim Mr India to be held on February 25 at Netaji Indoor Stadium.

 Voiceover: Each and every contestant was promising. It is amazing to see how much they have worked towards achieving their targets. Special mention needs to be made of the boys from Calcutta. It is very nice that they have come up so much despite the fashion industry still being fledgling here, said Pallavi.

 Dogs, bomb detectors at rail stations 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Mumbai train blasts on July 11 have prompted the authorities to recast security at Howrah and Sealdah stations.

 To start with, the Eastern Railway (ER) has sought 45 sniffer dogs for the Railway Protection Force units in Howrah, Sealdah and some other busy stations. The requisition has been made to the Railway Board, the official said. At present, there are only three sniffer dogs for Howrah, Sealdah and Asansol stations. 

 The authorities are also in the process of installing four state-of-the art bomb detection machines. Known as Linear Joint Detectors, the gadgets can also be used for defusing bombs. Special mirrors that can detect bombs hidden under vehicles will be used to check all vehicles entering the two terminal stations.

 That apart, 40 door-frame metal detectors will be installed at various entry points of the stations. The ER has also asked for 150 hand-held metal detectors to conduct checks on trains before departure. Eighty detectors have already arrived. 

 A large number of surveillance cameras will be installed at Howrah, Sealdah and other suburban stations. Now, only 15 closed-circuit cameras are installed and all are in the old complex of Howrah station. According to officials, the new complex, too, will be brought under the camera scanner.

 Twenty cameras have been installed at Sealdah station. Fifteen more stations, including Dum Dum Junction and Ranaghat, have been identified for installing such cameras, said the official.

 At a recent meeting with the state government, the railway and RPF officers discussed plans to boost security at the two stations and also the newly-built Calcutta station (at Chitpur). Railway officials said the state has offered a three-day capsule course on anti-blast measures for railway security personnel.

 A.K. Maitra, divisional railway manager (Howrah), however, said: The station is huge and hundred per cent security cannot be ensured overnight. We plan to bar people from entering the platforms from the rear side. Commuters will also be barred from entering the station through the cab road on the Bankim Setu side.

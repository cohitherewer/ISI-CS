The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Bangriposi

 On a drive back to Calcutta from 

 Nagpur some years ago, I had stopped over at a pretty village 

 on the outskirts of Simlipal Tiger Reserve. The forest bordering 

 the settlement was dotted with tribal hamlets that extended 

 to the foot of the hillocks in the distance.

 I had learnt that the name of the village was Bangriposi and had wanted to go back there ever since.

 The opportunity finally presented itself when my NRI nephew wanted to spend a quiet weekend in the countryside. Without a moment?s hesitation, we headed for the getaway in Orissa.

 Before we left, I called up the executive engineer of the national highway division, Central Public Works Department, at Baripada, and booked two rooms at the inspection bungalow in Bangriposi. 

 The National Highway 6 was in perfect condition and the 230-km drive through the green fields of Bengal and Orissa was most enjoyable. We started early and managed to reach Lodhasuli before stopping for a late breakfast.

 After gorging on hot samosas and tea at Lodhasuli-Jhargram junction, we heading for Chichira, on the border of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, about 184 km from the city.

 By itself, Chichira is a nice weekend hideout with its sal forest and blue hills. There is even a resthouse maintained by the district forest officer, Midnapore (West).

 We drove on for 20-odd km before crossing the Subarnarekha at Jamsola. Just before noon, we were at Bangriposi.

 The village stole our hearts immediately. Everywhere we looked, there was greenery.

 On the horizon, hillocks like Vidyabhandar, Pathrakusi and Buraburi rose to form a wall around the tribal hamlets.

 After lunch at the bungalow, we set out to explore the surroundings. The Santhals were taking cows to graze along the highway. In the distance, we saw Lodha women working in the fields.

 The sal trees in the forest were huge. My nephew, who has been to California, likened them with the giant redwoods there.

 The beauty of Bangriposi is the coming together of forest and hills, connected by the Buribalam river. The solitude soothed our frayed city nerves.

 As the evening set in we could hear drumbeats from the Santhal and Lodha villages. We asked the caretaker of the bungalow if a dance was being held in a village close to Bangriposi.

 To our dismay, the dances were all taking place in distant villages, but the caretaker assured us that he could arrange for some entertainment in exchange of a bottle of liquor. Keen to sample some tribal music, we struck a deal.

 The next day was Saturday. In the morning, we headed for the temple of Kanak Durga, hidden in the forest about 4 km from Bangriposi. The caretaker warned us that if we want to get back to the city safe and sound, we must offer puja at the temple on Saturday.

 We had nothing much to do so we walked up the hill, along NH 6, to the temple. The buses and trucks plying along the highway were stopping at the temple and making a donation before moving on.

 We sat down in the courtyard of the temple and enjoyed the tranquility. It was very relaxing.

 When we returned to the bungalow, the caretaker informed us that a Santhal dance had been arranged in the evening in a nearby village.

 At dusk, we drove to the village, about 3 km from the bungalow. The fluid moves of the Santhal youths to the rhythm of the drums kept us mesmerised as darkness descended over the hills and the forest.

 The Buribalam soon became a silver 

 strip in the moonlight. As we watched the water sparkle, 

 we silently thanked ourselves for making the trip into a 

 serenity that is rarely found.

 Going 

 There are direct buses from the 

 Esplanade terminus to Bangriposi. You can also take a train 

 to Balasore from Howrah and from there take a bus to Bangriposi. 

 But the most enjoyable way to get to Bangriposi is by car. 

 It is a 6-7 hour drive through rural India that you are 

 likely to remember for a long time

 Staying 

 Orissa Tourism Development Corporation?s 

 Panthasala is the best option. Call up the tourist officer, 

 Baripada, at (06792)-252710 for reservation. You can also 

 call up the Calcutta office at 22443653. There are a couple 

 of hotels as well

 When chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted in the Assembly recently that a few realtors were violating green laws, little did he know that one of his pet projects off the Bypass would be caught napping on that score.

 Metro Cash amp; Carry, a German wholesale major catering mainly to the hospitality industry worldwide, has come under a green cloud for starting construction work on its first city project by allegedly filling up waterbodies and without mandatory clearances from Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the state pollution control board (PCB).

 A city-based NGO has complained to the environment secretary that Metro, set to open a 120,000-sq-ft distribution hub on eight acres of land in Mukundapur, has filled up a ?large waterbody on the eastern side of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass with sand?.

 Harsh Bahadur, managing director and head of Metro Cash amp; Carry?s India operations, said: ?We have all the necessary clearances to start the project.?

 Gorachand Mondal, director-general (building), CMC, clarified: ?We have not yet sanctioned the plan of Metro Cash amp; Carry. We asked them to first get clearances from the pollution board, fire services and traffic police.?

 PCB sources maintained the company was yet to make any formal application.

 Environment department officials confirmed that the plot was a seasonal wetland and could not be filled up according to the Fisheries Act. The filling could trigger drainage problems, they warned.

 ?Though the complaint was first made on June 13, initially to the chief secretary and subsequently to the environment secretary, the municipal commissioner and Nitai Kundu of the Institute of Wetlands Management, the filling up has continued unabated,? pointed out Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC.

 The site is now being filled up with fly ash atop of an initial layer of sand. ?We have to shore up the plot to be level with the road, and we are targeting a December inauguration,? said Abhisek Kumar, in charge of civil works at site.

 Kumar confirmed that ?on-site work started in early June?, but denied that any wetland has been filled.

 With the project valued at well over Rs 50 crore it will require a central clearance and a provisional no-objection certificate from the state pollution control board.

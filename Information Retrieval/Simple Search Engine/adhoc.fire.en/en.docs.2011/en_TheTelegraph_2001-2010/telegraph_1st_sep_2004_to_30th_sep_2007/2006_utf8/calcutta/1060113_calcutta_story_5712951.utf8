 Child wakes up to see mother hanging

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 After spending the night on duty, Vijay Kumar, an assistant engineer with a central agency, called home on Thursday morning to find out whether his five-year-old daughter had left for school. 

 Little Namita took the call herself. ?Papa, Papa, I am very scared? Mummy is not talking at all and she is on a swing,? the girl sobbed on the phone.

 Kumar rushed to his Golf Green residence around 7 am, only to find his 32-year-old wife Renu hanging from the ceiling fan by a dupatta.

 Kumar?s colleague and next-door neighbour Sanjay Sen, who was with him, recounted: ?The scene devastated Vijay. He broke down and kept asking aloud: ?What will I tell my daughter??? 

 On Wednesday night, Kumar and his colleagues at Bharat Earth Movers Ltd were busy making last-minute preparations for a three-day exhibition to be held at Netaji Indoor Stadium from January 16.

 They set up a platform at the venue through the night. It is to serve as the main stage.

 ?We were all quite tired and were preparing to return home. But Vijay said he would stay back and complete the work that was left. However, as we were walking out of the stadium, he came out running. He got into the car with us and breathlessly told us about the phone call,? said Sen.

 The engineer hails from Jehanabad, in Bihar, while Renu was from Patna. Namita, their only child, studies in Class I of Central School in Ballygunge. Her parents usually accompanied her to the school bus, which picked her up around 7 am. 

 ?On Wednesday night, five of our colleagues had left their homes after dinner for the stadium. On the way, they picked up Vijay. It was around 10.20 pm, and his wife and daughter came out to see him off. Renu was quite lively and they seemed a happy family,? Sen stated.

 According to police, Renu was probably suffering from depression.

 ?But nothing can be said for certain before the post-mortem report is available. I have asked my officers to speak with Kumar,? said additional superintendent of police (industry) H.K. Kusumakar.

 The Kumars normally had dinner around 10 pm before turning in for the night. Wednesday was no exception, a neighbour told the cops on the case. 

 ?After getting up in the morning, Namita did not see her mother. The girl initially thought that she might have gone to the toilet. But after Namita found Renu hanging from the ceiling, she became very scared. When her father called, she asked him to come home immediately,? Kusumakar added.

 Sen said Renu?s family members had been informed about the incident and would be arriving in the city soon.

 A team from Jadavpur police station turned up on the spot, after being informed by Kumar. They took away the body soon after.

 ?We are waiting for the family members of Renu to arrive before sending the body for post-mortem,? said Kusumakar.

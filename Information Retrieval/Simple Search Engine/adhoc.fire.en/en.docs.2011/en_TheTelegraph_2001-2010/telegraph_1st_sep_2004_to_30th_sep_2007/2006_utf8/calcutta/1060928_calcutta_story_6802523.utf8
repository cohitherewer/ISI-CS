 Canal ferry flagged off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday inaugurated the much-awaited ferry service on Kestopur canal. It will be opened to the public on Tuesday.

 Accompanied by housing minister Goutam Deb, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, city mayor Bikash Bhattacharyya and senior officers, Bhattacharjee boarded the launch at Chitpur Lockgate and travelled up to Lake Town.

 Both sides of New Cut and Kestopur canal were decorated with lights and banners. Wonderful, remarked Bhattacharjee, after sailing for about 10 minutes.

 He directed Deb to provide funds to clean up Circular canal to make it navigable.

 Speeding bus kills woman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Reckless driving has claimed yet another life in the city. 

 A 40-year-old woman died on the spot after being hit by a CSTC bus on route 9A at Hazra crossing on Tuesday morning. Local residents took her to SSKM Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

 Police said the victim was crossing the road when the bus hit her from behind. The driver noticed the woman, but did not bother to slam the brakes. In a moment, the woman was lying on the road, her head smashed, recalled Anirban Saha, a witness.

 The driver fled with his vehicle.

 A mob put up a roadblock at the crossing for over half an hour, demanding immediate arrest of the driver. The crowd also smashed the windscreen of another CSTC bus. The situation was brought under control after a police contingent reached the spot.

 Senior officers persuaded the protesters to lift the blockade around 9 am, said a cop attached to Kalighat thana.

 Local residents alleged that the crossing had become accident-prone because of the callousness of traffic department officers. They demanded that enough traffic constables be deployed at the crossing during peak hours.

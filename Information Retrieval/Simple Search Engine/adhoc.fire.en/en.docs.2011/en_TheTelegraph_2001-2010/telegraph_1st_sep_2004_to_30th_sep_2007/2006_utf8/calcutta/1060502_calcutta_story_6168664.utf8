 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to discontinue the century-old practice of using tongs to catch stray dogs. Lassos will be used, instead. 

 Civic dog squad workers will be taught how to use lassos at a workshop next week. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya will inaugurate the programme on the Behala premises of an NGO. 

 ?The traditional way of catching dogs with a tong is cruel and painful. Hence, we are introducing a more humane method. The civic authorities should have made the switch much earlier,? stated the mayor.

 Chief municipal health officer Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay said: ?Lassos are totally safe and there is no danger of the dog getting hurt. The system is followed in most advanced countries. It is not possible to catch the dogs in a net, as they might bite the captor.? 

 Until 1998, the civic body used to kill thousands of dogs a year to keep the stray canine count in check. Following a meeting between Maneka Gandhi and then municipal commissioner Asim Barman, it was decided that instead of killing the dogs, NGOs would be entrusted with the responsibility of sterilising and vaccinating them.

 ?The NGOs in charge of vaccination will be directed to mark the tail or an ear of the street dogs with indelible ink. The ink will last over nine months. Similarly, metal tagging will be used to mark a dog after sterilisation,? added chief municipal health officer Chattopadhyay.

 Several members of the NGO Love-N-Care for Animals have been trained in the use of lassos by a team from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, UK. 

 They will conduct next week?s programme for the civic staff.

 ?We will gift five lassos of different sizes to the CMC. A day?s training is enough for the staff to pick up the skills,? revealed Sushmita Roy of Love-N-Care for Animals.

 Under the CMC act, the civic authority is duty-bound to keep the Calcutta streets free of stray animals. According to the dog squad workers, the highest concentration of street dogs in the city is in government hospitals, slums and housing estates. 

 The total number of stray dogs in Calcutta is over 100,000, as per a civic estimate.

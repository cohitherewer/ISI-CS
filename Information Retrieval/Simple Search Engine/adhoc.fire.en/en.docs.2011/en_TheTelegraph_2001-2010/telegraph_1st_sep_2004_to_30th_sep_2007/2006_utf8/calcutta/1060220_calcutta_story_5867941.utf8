The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Healthcare?s new address

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta?s growing status as the region?s healthcare hub will get another shot in the arm with the commissioning of a new, super-speciality hospital in the city by Poila Baisakh next year.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will lay the foundation stone for the first phase of the 500-bed hospital and medical college at Mukundapur, off the EM Bypass, on Monday, to be developed by the Eastern India Healthcare Foundation (EIHF).

 State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, mayor Bikash Bhattacharyya, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and minister of state for Sunderbans development Kanti Ganguly will also be present.

 ?We will approach healthcare delivery by addressing different diseases through centres of excellence,? EIHF chairman Alok Roy told Metro on Sunday. Accordingly, the hospital will have dedicated institutes of diabetology, spinal disorders, joint replacement, minimal-access surgery and liver diseases.

 Construction of the first phase with 200 beds, to be built at a cost of Rs 51 crore, is expected to begin in two months and be completed in a year. The Rs 140-crore hospital, once complete, will also have peripheral units in Asansol, Dhanbad, Midnapore, Siliguri and Balasore.

 Each of these units will be a self-sufficient, 50 to 100-bed hospital equipped in primary care and hooked up with the main hospital through satellite link and referrals.

 ?To connect with the community better, we will have trained healthcare workers visit 25,000 households in the constituency over the next one year to record medical histories of those families for our databank. These healthcare hostesses will also be the conduits in the event of these families requiring medical aid,? Roy stressed.

 The trust is tying up with ?top medical facilities in various disciplines in India and abroad? on a knowledge-sharing basis, according to trustee Udayan Lahiry, who promised a 40 per cent price cushion ?on market rates?.

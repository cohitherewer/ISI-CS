 Pop a pill, kill the kidneys 

Painkiller preys on kidneys

 - Renal risk in indiscriminate painkiller use, warn doctors

 KINSUK BASU

Do you pop pills for instant relief from pain? If you do, then you should know that the pills could kill. They damage one of the most vital organs of the body ? the kidneys.

 The threat has always been there, but doctors are worried about the increasing number of people falling prey to kidney ailments due to their penchant for popping painkillers and antibiotics at the slightest pretext.

 This habit of self-medication, as doctors would put it, has made matters particularly worse for those with a history of kidney problems. 

 ?The indiscriminate purchase of painkillers and antibiotics over the counter and their consumption is taking a toll on the health of many urban people. Most of them think they are knowledgeable about medicines, but are seldom aware of the side-effects,? states head of the nephrology department at SSKM Hospital Abhijit Tarafdar.

 ?The kidneys take a severe beating as a result of random drug use. There have been cases where use of painkillers has resulted in allergic interstitial nephritis, a disorder that leads to acute renal failure,? adds Tarafdar. 

 Those with high blood pressure are the most vulnerable to the dangers of drug abuse. Those who use analgesics without consulting the doctor also run the risk of renal failure. In some cases, say city-based nephrologists, a short course of wrong drugs has necessitated dialysis for cleaning of the blood and restoration of the kidneys. 

 ?Drugs reach the kidneys in concentrated form before being flushed out through the urine. The high concentration of the medicines, at times, has its own side-effects, such as formation of vaso-constrictions that restrict supply of oxygen to the kidneys,? explains V.V. Laxmi Narayan of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.

 ?The problem can be handled when it occurs in those who suffer from allergic reaction to drugs. But when someone takes painkillers over a long period, the damage to the kidneys can be irreversible,? the doctor warns.

 According to nephrologists, the papilla (the V-shaped region in the kidney that drains the filtrate) is either torn away or severely damaged due to regular deposition of drugs. 

 ?Known as analgesic nephropathy, this condition is cause for serious concern as it leads to inter-tubular blockage inside the kidneys,? adds Tarafdar.

 But its not just drugs that pose a danger to the kidneys.

 ?There could be other factors causing kidney problems, but those who have been taking over-the-counter painkillers on a regular basis should check with their doctors to make sure the pills have not damaged their kidneys,? opines Arup Ratan Dutta, chief nephrologist of Wockhardt. 

 Doctors, however, do not hold any particular group of painkillers or antibiotics responsible for acute interstitial nephritis and analgesic nephropathy.

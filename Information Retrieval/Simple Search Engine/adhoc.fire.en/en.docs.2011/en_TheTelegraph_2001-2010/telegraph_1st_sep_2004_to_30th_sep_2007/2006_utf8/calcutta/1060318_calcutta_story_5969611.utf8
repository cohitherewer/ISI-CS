 Little has been done to dispel misconceptions and spread awareness about cancer. Prerak, a seven-year-old NGO working as a support group for cancer fighters (patients and families), is organising a workshop on palliative care on April 8.

 The workshop will provide the opportunity for a public interaction between health professionals, volunteers, cancer patients and those who have lost someone to the disease. The panel includes Mary-Ann Muckaden, head of department, palliative care, from Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, and Brindha Sitaram, consultant psycho-oncologist, Curie Centre of Oncology, Bangalore. The patients? concerns and fears and treatment meted out to them by society will all come to the fore.

 ?Palliative comes from a Latin word meaning cloaked. So, palliative care would be ?cloaked with treatment?. The World Health Organisation describes palliative care as total care of patients with life-limiting diseases and their families by a multi-professional team when the disease is no longer responsive to curative or life-prolonging treatment. It is something that extends far beyond physical symptoms of relief and integrates social, spiritual and social aspects of care,?? explained Rati Vajpayee of Prerak.

 Many people still believe that cancer is infectious, said Vajpayee. ?Patients and their families are socially ostracised and no one comes to visit them. Even close relatives sometimes shun patients because they feel they can?t bear to see their suffering. There is nothing to prove that cancer is hereditary but patients still have to cope with the stigma. A young girl?s parents would not allow her to get chemotherapy because they feared that people would realise she was a cancer patient and none of her sisters would get married,?? said Vajpayee.

 Prerak volunteers are present in most hospitals and attend to individual calls from patients. Most approaching Prerak are in very advanced stages of the disease. It then becomes the duty of Prerak to see that medical treatment causes patients minimum discomfort.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, all-action weekend

 OUR BUREAU

 Wheres the action this weekend? Right here in town, starting at the stroke of Friday midnight and going on non-stop till Sunday. Theres fashion blast and food for thought, model hunt and music medley, playing cricket under cover and shooting from behind a Sunglass

 The myriad weekend menu kicks off with Friday midnight fashion at Tantra as top ramp beauties (Deepika Padukone, Jesse Randhawa) sizzle on the bartop in creations by design diva Ritu Kumar. Calcutta is home to me and I always love showcasing here, said Ritu Kumar on show-eve.

 The fashion story unfolds further at high noon on Sunday with star city designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee launching the mens wear line of Aara at 54, Chowringhee. Later in the day, designer Abhishek Dutta launches his home accessories line at his Cornfield Road studio.

 But to get to the Sunday line-up one must first survive Saturday. The evening plays host to the grand finale of Unish Kuri Streax Glam Hunt 06, the first ever mega model hunt in eastern India, at Hotel Hindusthan International. Five boys and five girls will be vying for two crowns in the no-holds-barred show celebrating youth, beauty and brawn.

 Also on Saturday evening is the Tolly Monsoon Bash presented by The Telegraph. The Tollygunge Club main lawns will come alive to rain and revelry hosted by VJ Archana. This is a much-awaited fun event, says Arunava Chakravarty, deputy managing member, Tolly Club.

 On a more mellow musical note, the Calcutta School of Music on Saturday plays host to An Evening of Easy Listening with Shashi Puri playing light classical compositions on the piano followed by a newly-formed jazz quartet playing a mix of jazz standards with some Latin grooves. And then theres the 12th Someplace Else anniversary celebrations starring Soulmate, a blues band from Shillong.

 From blues to a Bollywood-style book, Vikram Chandras Sacred Games will be launched at Taj Bengal on Saturday evening with a reading. The 999-page Penguin potboiler, Chandras third, is set against the Mumbai underworld.

 Tollywood, meanwhile, has donned a magic Sunglass, with Rituparno Ghoshs comedy starring Konkona and Raima, Madhavan and Tota taking to the streets shooting in Jodhpur Park, Golf Green, the Technicians Studio and at Shrachi Towers.

 Calcutta meets Mumbai on the small screen as well with a major part of Karam Apna Apna being shot here, Roopa Ganguly starring in the K-serial and Balaji boss Ektaa Kapoor spending Saturday on the sets at Burdwan House.

 The stage strikes a more sombre note with an August 19-21 theatre festival at Rabindra Sadan to mark the 13th death anniversary of Utpal Dutt. There will also be a tribute to Tapas Sen.

 With the Colombo series a washout, cricket goes indoors with action in The Telegraph Indoor Corporate cricket tournament, engaging 64 eight-a-side corporate teams, hotting up on the Space Circle synthetic pitch.

 Its play time, folks!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 We Ask You Answer

 Between vigil and laxity

 Today?s question: Is Calcutta 

 as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai? More responses 

 will be published next week

 Khar station, Mumbai (AFP)

 No, Calcutta is definitely not 

 as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai. However, crimes 

 like theft, robbery and dacoity are more common in the city. 

 Security in Calcutta is strict with tight vigil in front 

 of Writers? Buildings, Raj Bhavan and American Center.

 Rahul Roy, 

 Dum Dum

 Though security has been beefed 

 up in Calcutta following the Mumbai blasts, it will become 

 slack again in a few days. Multiplexes, malls, movie halls 

 and nightclubs have almost no protection even now. Moreover, 

 a huge number of people cross the border every day without 

 any problem. With these loopholes, Calcutta is definitely 

 as vulnerable to terror attacks as Mumbai.

 Arindam Basu, 

 Birati

 With most of the states in India 

 under the shadow of terrorism, there is no reason to consider 

 Calcutta a safe haven. In comparison with other cities, 

 the policing here is outdated. While terrorists use the 

 latest weapons, a police constable in Calcutta is provided 

 only a lathi. It would be a daydream to expect the 

 force to put up a fight should there be a terrorist attack 

 in Calcutta. Even the vigil at landmarks is not up to the 

 mark. It is natural that members of various terrorist groups 

 choose the city as a hideout.

 T. Dey Chakrabarty,

 Barasat

 Calcutta is a metro city but it 

 cannot be compared with Mumbai. However, the fact that terrorist 

 attacks can happen here has been established long back with 

 the siege at American Center. 

 Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria

 Calcutta is no less vulnerable 

 to terror attacks than Mumbai. Not only that, the city has 

 a porous and almost unprotected border through which terrorists 

 can enter the country. Besides, the police are not equipped 

 to fight terrorists. The incident at American Center is 

 ample proof. It is just our good luck that the terrorists 

 treat this city as a hideout and not as a target. 

 Tuli Das, 

 Salt Lake

 Yes. Among Indian cities, Calcutta 

 is the most vulnerable to terrorist attacks. But we should 

 remember that there is hardly a place in the world where 

 terrorism has failed to rear its ugly head. Alarmingly, 

 the awareness about security is abysmally low among Calcuttans. 

 Metro Railway, the lifeline of the city is especially vulnerable. 

 The cops posted there spend time reading newspapers, while 

 metal detectors do not work. If the people on duty at Metro 

 stations were alert, suicides would not have happened there. 

 Danish Khan,

 Nil Madhab Sen Lane

 Of course, it is. Metro Railway 

 and the suburban train services are the easiest targets. 

 Proximity with two centres of anti-Indian activities ? Bangladesh 

 and Nepal ? does not help. It is only a matter of luck that 

 we haven?t witnessed any major terrorist attack yet. 

 T.R. Anand,

 Budge Budge 

 Calcutta will not face terrorist 

 attacks like Mumbai since the security here is superior 

 to that in the business capital. The Left Front government 

 is ruling Bengal with utmost care, so we need not bother 

 about terrorists. However, the alarm bells are ringing across 

 the country and we need to be on our toes.

 A.K. Bhowmik, 

 Kaikhali

 Terrorism has spread its wings 

 to all parts of the world, including India. The serial blasts 

 in Mumbai, attack on Parliament and the gunfight outside 

 American Center in Calcutta has exposed the vulnerability 

 of our cities. Calcuttans cannot afford to claim that we 

 are safe. The police need to be vigilant round-the-clock.

Moumita Nandi,

 Behala 

 Terrorist attacks can be carried 

 out at any place at any time. The major cities in India 

 are all prone to attacks. The government must enlist the 

 help of the military to thwart the terrorists, instead of 

 trying to pursue a policy of peace. Non-violence will not 

 achieve anything now. Peace has to be secured by defeating 

 the enemy.

 Prasun Mukherjee

 Commissioner, Calcutta Police

 Every city across the world is vulnerable to terror attacks 

 in todays context. Why single out Calcutta? Terrorism 

 is a global threat. Any attack on Calcutta will have tremendous 

 impact on eastern India as well as this part of the sub-continent 

 as the city acts as the gateway. The border is porous, especially 

 on the Bangladesh side. Blasts keep happening in Bangladesh. 

 The ISI has shifted its activities to this side as vigil 

 has become stricter on the Pakistan border. So Calcutta 

 has no reason to be complacent.

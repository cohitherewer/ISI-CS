 She caused quite a flutter at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week (WLIFW) in Delhi last month when she made Australian actress Tania Zaetta strut the ramp sporting body paint from neck to toe. Now, Delhi-based designer Neeta Bhargava is set to do an encore of the bold body act ? in Calcutta.

 On Friday night, a select crowd will see Tania moving and shaking on the Tantra bar top, dressed in body paint and bare essentials, as she unveils Neetas show titled Fatal Attraction.

 The show kick-starts a series titled Fashion Police that will be hosted by The Park over the next few months.

 Tania will be sporting body paint all over, but the motifs will be different from the Fashion Week look. And the presentation too will be very different, Neeta tells GoodLife. The idea is to present Tania as a piece of art. She will strike sculpture poses through dance movements.

 The designer, whose forte lies in her painting-based creations, will showcase an extension of her WLIFW collection. The fall-winter 2006-07 line is split into three parts ? Bronze-Sculpture, Yin and Yang, Coal and Flames. The colour stories of the three sequences are bronze, black-and-white and black-and-red.

 While the show at Fashion Week presented the three looks separately, the show at Tantra will mix and match the looks in one long sequence.

 In keeping with the Fatal Attraction theme, we have worked on the opposites attract idea. Hence, theres a lot of stark contrast of shades in the lowers and uppers, explains Neeta.

 Boasting a Bachelors degree in fine arts and specialising in Tanjore paintings till 1993, Neetas switchover to designing was a spontaneous process. Though she has changed her medium of creativity, Neeta has not shifted focus from paintings. Only now, her canvases are her clothes. And while she has always drawn inspiration from the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma as an artist, Neeta plans to use the influence in her designs as well.

 For her next collection ? to be displayed at the WLIFW spring-summer edition in August-September ? Neeta plans to do a dream project drawing inspiration from works of the Masters. It will be a tribute to the Masters where I will use snatches from their paintings, she adds.

 The lady who retails from stores in the UK, US, Kenya, Spain, Kuwait, Singapore and Hong Kong, plans to use influences from French artists, and M.F. Husain and Raja Ravi Varma closer home.

 In Calcutta for the Tantra show, Neeta is also scouting for art talent in the city. I have always got artists from the Government Art College here to work for me. Calcutta, along with Bhubaneswar, Varanasi and Jabalpur, provides a steady flow of amateur artists to Neetas unit.

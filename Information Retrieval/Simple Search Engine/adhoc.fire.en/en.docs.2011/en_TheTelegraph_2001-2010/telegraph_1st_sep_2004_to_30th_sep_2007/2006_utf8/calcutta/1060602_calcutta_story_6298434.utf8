 Coming up, a six-gallery museum housing archaeological finds unearthed since 1960, but dating back to BC second millennium.

 ?People today are more interested in heritage and archaeology than ever before,? claimed Gautam Sengupta, director, Centre for Archaeological Studies, on Thursday, unveiling a new three-storeyed museum in Behala.

 An annexe to the existing State Archaeological Museum, the new building is set to open later this month. The project is being steered by the directorate of archaeology and museums of the state information and cultural affairs department.

 The older building will continue to house a study collection for scholars and a conservation laboratory, while the new viewer-friendly galleries house pre and proto-history, and touch screen info kiosks. Plans are also on for a gallery on the ethnic craft and culture of Bengal.

 The new museum introduces visitors to Bengal?s sculptural heritage and some of its painting traditions. A fibreglass scale model of the ninth Century monastic site at Jagjeevanpur and recreations of the remains at Tilpi and Dhosa excavations provide rare insights into archaeological activity of the times.

 There are hundreds of original finds in terracotta, stone, metals and ivory, red and black pottery, plaques and statuettes. Ivory chess pieces representing the Mughal and British armies catch the eye. ?There are only two such sets in the world, both created by craftsmen in Murshidabad for Lord Clive,? said keeper Pratic Mitra.

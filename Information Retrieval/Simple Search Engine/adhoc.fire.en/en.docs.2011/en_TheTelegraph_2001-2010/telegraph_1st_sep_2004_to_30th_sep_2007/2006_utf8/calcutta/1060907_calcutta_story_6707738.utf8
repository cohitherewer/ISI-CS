 To fuel the growing interest in astronomy, Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, a unit of the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), on Wednesday inaugurated The World of Astronomical Observatories, a month-long exhibition, in the museum hall. The first-of-its-kind show will continue till October 5.

 Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Shyamal Kumar Sanyal inaugurated the exhibition. Debiprosad Duari, director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium, and Jayanta Sthanapati, director of the museum, presided over the function.

 Developed by the NCSM, the exhibition traces humanitys quest to learn more about heavenly bodies through observational astronomy, from the Stone Age to space age.

 The focus of the exhibition is primarily on technological developments in astronomy that have transformed the way men have looked at the sky, said Sthanapati at the inauguration.

 The exhibition consists of 42 panels and 17 exhibits that explain in simple language the history and science behind astronomical observatories. There are also six models of astronomical observatories. From Stonehenge to the Hubble Space Telescope, everything related to development of the discipline has been touched upon. 

 To have a clear conception of astronomy, it is important to know the basics and most importantly, the history of the subject. The exhibition excels in this aspect. It not only sums up the birth and evolution of observatories, but also provides information essential for the understanding of astronomy, observed Duari.

 The museum authorities have plans to hold exhibitions showcasing the construction of telescopes.

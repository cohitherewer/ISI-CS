 Wedding din at hospital

 - Showcause slap on staff

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Samik Roy (name changed) lay sleepless in his bed at the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital, Beleghata, as the microphone blared all through Thursday night. The child, suffering from diarrhoea, was on the drip.

 Samik and other patients at the hospital could not sleep all night as a Group D employee was celebrating his daughter?s wedding. 

 The wedding comes just a few days after the rape of a patient?s wife by the son of a Group D employee at Medical College and Hospital. 

 ?We have served a showcause notice on the employee, seeking an explanation why he had arranged the marriage on the hospital premises. If he does not give a satisfactory reply within three days, disciplinary action will be taken,? said principal Pushpa Mitra.

 A huge pandal was set up just behind the two blocks of the hospital and adjacent to the quarters of Group D employee Jagadish Dom. The pandal was in front of a club, which sources said is an illegal construction. 

 In the evening, things were under control. But as night progressed, loudspeakers blared in full volume, with the guests, mostly drunk, dancing and shouting.

 ?It was difficult for us to sleep, as there was so much noise,? said a patient?s relative. 

 The authorities have already barred employees from organising programmes on the premises and a notice has been put up in front of the wardmaster?s room.

 ?My elder daughter?s marriage was also held here but no one had complained. And I am not the only one to organise such functions,? said Dom, with the showcause notice in his hand. 

 The two blocks of Group D staff quarters house nearly 100 families, with a few others from outside. 

 ?We are CPM members, nothing will happen to us,? one of asserted. 

 The hospital has over 700 beds, but presently, there are 120 patients, officials said. Most of the patients are suffering from acute diarrhoea, cholera and other infectious diseases.

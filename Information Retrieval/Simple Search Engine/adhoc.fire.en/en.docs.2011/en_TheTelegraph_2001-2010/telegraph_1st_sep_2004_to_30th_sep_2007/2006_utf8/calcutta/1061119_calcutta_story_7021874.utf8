 Why Daniel Craig is James Bond 

 Will Daniel Craig do as Bond? The verdict in the virutal world is a resounding YES. Ladies, especially, are raving about the Bond blonde and bruised in Casino Royale. 

 Vanessa Jaye (http://vanes sajaye.blogspot.com) is categorical: Daniel Craig owns this role/character now. Its not a matter of who is your favourite Bond. Craig IS Bond! End of discussion.

 She adds: He is sexy as hell, dangerous and intense, smart and capable, confident and witty, daring and tender... And is he in shape! All over.

 Shesawriter (http://myirrationalities.blogspot.com) writes, To the naysayers, I just have one thing to say: In the words of Malcolm X, Youve been had. Youve been took. Youve been hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray, run amuck! And Ill add, youve been... shaken, stirred and tossed every which way, yet youre still clueless! Daniel Craig has left every last one of you in the dust. The man was AWESOME!

 An anonymous blogger (http://anythingbutpoetry.blogspot.com) has an entire post on one scene: Craig emerge(s) out of the ocean in a close-fitting blue shorts, much like the bikini-clad Ursula Andresss iconic entrance in Dr No. But producer Barbara Broccoli insists the moment was entirely coincidental. She explains, Daniel had to go into the sea for a scene. But when he came out all the women on the set gasped. It wasnt intended for the scene to go that way but he made a real impact. I am not sure only the women gasped!

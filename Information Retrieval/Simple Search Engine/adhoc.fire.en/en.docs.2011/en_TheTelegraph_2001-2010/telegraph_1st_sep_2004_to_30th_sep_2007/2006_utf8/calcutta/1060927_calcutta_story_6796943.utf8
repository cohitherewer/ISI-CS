 Blueprint for acres

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has prepared a master plan for utilisation of nearly 18 acres of land at Ganguly Bagan, in Jadavpur.

 The plot, in the chief ministers constituency, is owned by the refugee relief and rehabilitation department. During Bidhan Chandra Roys tenure as chief minister, flats were built there to house more than 1,000 families at a nominal rent. In 2004, portions of the flats collapsed due to lack of maintenance. Some of the families were accommodated at Baishnabghata Patuli, on EM Bypass. The flats at Ganguly Bagan were later demolished. 

 It was initially decided that cooperatives of eight to 12 families would be formed and each would be given six cottahs, where a five-storeyed building will come up. The department planned to sell the extra flats at market price. 

 Some families under the banner of United Central Refugee Council opposed the scheme and demanded separate plots for each family.

 The department then engaged the CMDA to prepare the blueprint for an infrastructure development project with attention to roads, sewage disposal, water supply, healthcare, education and shopping facilities.

 Chief engineer (bustee improvement and municipal area development) of CMDA R.K. Chowdhury said: Work will start as soon as the department gives the green signal.

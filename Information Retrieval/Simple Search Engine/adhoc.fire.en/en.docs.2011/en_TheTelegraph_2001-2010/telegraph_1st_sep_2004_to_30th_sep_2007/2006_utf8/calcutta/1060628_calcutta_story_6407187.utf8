The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Airline focus on China 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After hardselling Southeast Asia, Singapore Airlines is looking to promote China as a tourist destination. 

 ?The passenger traffic to China is currently less than 10 per cent of the total traffic out of Calcutta on our flights. In two to three years, we are aiming to increase the figure to 15,? said Ryan Pua, state manager (eastern India), Singapore Airlines.

 The airline on Tuesday announced a promotional offer to destinations in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou. 

 It is also offering reduced fairs to Southeast Asian destinations like Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Bangkok and Langkawi.

 Under the offer, the return economy-class fares have been slashed by 19 to 30 per cent. 

 For Beijing/Shanghai and Nanjing, the reduced return fare from Calcutta is Rs 21,000 (excluding tax). 

 For Guangzhou, the new return fare is Rs 12,000 (excluding tax).

 The airline also announced a special return fare of Rs 9,995 (excluding tax) for Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. For Bangkok and Langkawi, the fares will be Rs 9,995 and Rs 10,995 (excluding tax), respectively.

 To avail of the scheme, tickets must be booked before July 31, 2006. 

 The tickets will be valid for travel out of Calcutta from July 1 to August 31 this year. The offer includes a free stopover at Singapore.

 ?China is growing rapidly as a tourist destination. It is not an expensive country and there are lots of places of interest. It is also a shopper?s paradise,? stated Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

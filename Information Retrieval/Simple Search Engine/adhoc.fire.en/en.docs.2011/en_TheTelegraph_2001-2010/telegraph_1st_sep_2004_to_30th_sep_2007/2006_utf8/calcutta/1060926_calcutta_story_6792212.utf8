 Top cop calls for caution

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Dont galvanise yourself into action on seeing an unclaimed canister or anything resembling explosives near a puja pandal. Instead, get in touch with your superiors.

 That was the order from police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to his force on Puja eve.

 The fatal Lalgarh (West Midnapore) blast fresh in his mind, Mukherjee on Monday urged his men to exercise caution while on duty during the Puja days.

 Addressing cops at Alipore Bodyguard Lines on the occasion of the final briefing for the festive season, Mukherjee asked his officers to be very sure before handling anything that might look like an Improvised Explosive Device. 

 Before rushing to seek help from our specialised force, take a close look at the object and assess the situation. In case you feel there is cause for concern, dont panic. Just cordon off the area and get in touch with your superiors around. You must handle the situation with extreme care, Mukherjee advised.

 The officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations, all assistant commissioners and the officers-in-charge of the traffic guards were among those who attended the meeting. The deployment of force for the Pujas begins on Sashthi (Thursday).

 If someone informs you over the phone that a bomb has been planted in a pandal, dont make the news public. That may lead to a stampede. Do whatever needs to be done in a responsible way. All of you are experienced officers and I hope you know your job well, Mukherjee said.

 Though there is no specific intelligence input on the Puja days, police are not taking chances.

 For the first time, an assistant commissioner will be responsible for security at all Metro Railway stations. He will coordinate with the Metro Railway Police and the Government Railway Police and also personnel of the Reserve Force.

 An unprecedented number of Radio Flying Squad and Heavy Radio Flying Squad personnel will be pressed into service this year.

 nDeployment: Police on Monday announced an elaborate arrangement for the Pujas. Around 25,000 cops will be deployed in the city on the four days. A number of closed-circuit TV sets will be installed in major pandals. Twenty-five assistance booths will be set up and 150 personnel will be engaged for Metro Railway security.

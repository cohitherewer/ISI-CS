What: Milani, in association with The Telegraph. 

 Where: St Xaviers College, Calcutta.

 When: Saturday evening.

 Take a look: The evening was organised by the St Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association and Bengali Literary Society of the college to celebrate the platinum jubilee of the Bengali Literary Society.

 Milani is an example of how the college is rooted to local culture. The milieu, the music and even the food have a touch of Bengali culture, said father P.C. Mathew, principal, St Xaviers College, Calcutta.

 High points: The evening was marked by Baul songs and a fashion show, but the big draw was the Bengali cuisine at the sit-down dinner, on the college grounds, in traditional style. The menu included delicacies like Paturi, Chingri Malai Curry, Pulao and mishti. Amongst the guests present were MP Md Salim and member, mayor-in-council, Faiyaz Khan.

 Voiceover: The Bengali Literary Society is one of the oldest societies in the college and enjoys a lot of support from the students. It keeps organising cultural events all round the year, but this evening is very special, said Imran Zaki Siddiqui, general secretary of the alumni association. The best thing is the entire set-up has been done by the students. It has helped the students bond with the alumni, he added.

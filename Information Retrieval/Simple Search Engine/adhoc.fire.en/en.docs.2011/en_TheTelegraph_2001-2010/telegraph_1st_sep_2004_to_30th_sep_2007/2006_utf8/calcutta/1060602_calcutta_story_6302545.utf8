The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Always, a twist in the tale

 Ordinary book but extraordinary film; great book but poor film ? the adaptation debate rages on from the pages to the productions, says Patrick Pringle

 Amid much fanfare, The Da Vinci Code was released recently to a mixed critical reception at Cannes. Did it live up to the sensation that the book caused? The general consensus is that the film faithfully follows Dan Brown?s bestseller.

 But does a faithful adaptation of a book necessarily make for a good film? The Da Vinci Code adaptation is but the latest chapter in Hollywood?s long history of adapting successful (and not-so-successful) novels.

 Undoubtedly the biggest adaptation in recent years has been the Lord of the Rings trilogy, an enormously ambitious project by director Peter Jackson. The film imitated the epic proportions of J.R.R Tolkien?s seminal 1955 fantasy book. The result was over 10 hours of film, with all three movies grossing just under $ 3 billion worldwide.

 It is fair to say that if one didn?t like the books, then it is unlikely that one would enjoy the film ? or as one critic of the book exclaimed: ?Oh god, not another f***ing elf!? Nevertheless, Jackson and his team must be commended for undertaking such an enormous project, and most importantly doing justice to a book with one of the most obsessive fan bases in the world.

 What list of recent good adaptations would be complete without J.K Rowling?s phenomenally successful Harry Potter books? The Potter films seem to have fulfilled the same role as the Lord of The Rings Trilogy by satiating fans with the transition to the silver screen. With all the books due to make an appearance on celluloid (the latest being Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, slated for 2008), the Potter franchise looks set to be the biggest in history.

 The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, went one step ahead and dwarfed Mario Puzo?s book. The book was well received when it was published, but only in the hands of Puzo and Coppola did it become such a definitive tale.

 In terms of adaptations, Coppola arguably outdid himself four years later with Apocalypse Now (1976). Coppola took Joseph Conrad?s disconcerting colonial classic Heart of Darkness out of the Congo and into 1960s Vietnam, thus immediately drawing the comparison between American foreign policy with 19th century European imperialism.

 Like Coppola?s The Godfather, Jonathan Demme?s 1991 adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs thoroughly outclassed Thomas Harris?s book. Much of the film?s success can be attributed to the extraordinary Oscar-winning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.

 Irvine Welsh?s novel Trainspotting was also defined by a subsequent film. The novel challenged even the most intrepid of readers with its indecipherable mixture of Scottish dialect and vivid portrayal of the 1980s heroin epidemics in Edinburgh. 

 Headed by director Danny Boyle, the same team behind Shallow Grave managed to convert this impossible combination into the biggest film of 1996, and cement the reputations of many of the actors in the cast.

 There are some books that directors should never touch with a barge pole. Brett Easton Ellis?s American Psycho is one such example. Mary Harron?s 2000 adaptation starring Christian Bale was a relatively tame interpretation of the story of deranged sleaze and irrational violence that would simply have been impossible to faithfully reproduce on screen.

 Michael Crichton?s book Jurassic Park was an excellent idea that was incredibly badly articulated, and Steven Spielberg?s absurdly hyped screen adaptation did nothing more than prove how good special effects were in 1993, and scare the living daylights out of kids expecting Denver the Last Dinosaur.

 Most recently, howls of derision met the Cannes press screening of Sofia Coppola?s adaptation of Antonia Fraser?s biography Marie Antoinette, with Kirsten Dunst?s honking American accent apparently attracting many stifled laughs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Summer beeline for the Southeast

 - THAI CARRIER TO ADD FLIGHTS OUT FROM CITY

 NISHA LAHIRI

 The tourist wave 

 from Calcutta to Singapore (top) and Thailand (above) 

 shows no signs of ebbing 

 Thailand?s political problems notwithstanding, Calcutta has been flocking to the Southeast Asian destination in droves, to catch up on some sun, sea, sand and shopping. 

 Although Malaysian Airlines pulled out of the city and budget airlines Jet Star has been making similar noises, Thai Airways is all set to add flights from the city. 

 The airline has been doing brisk business since February. 

 And the May-June summer rush has seen flights leaving with over 90 per cent capacity almost every day, says general manager Krisnapong Srisinwarakool. ?So, plans are to add two more flights in July,? he says.

 If the going remains as good and the airline has enough aircraft to spare, Thai Airways will fly out from Calcutta to Bangkok seven days a week instead of the current five. 

 ?We normally don?t add flights till the new financial year in April, but if all goes well, then Calcutta will have a daily flight to Thailand from July. Even if it doesn?t work out this year, it will definitely happen post-April,? adds the general manager.

 For now, the airline is riding high on the tourism wave from Calcutta. Political chaos in the country after the national elections in April, insurgency, racial violence and security concerns are reportedly driving away global tourists, but Calcuttans seem undeterred. 

 The forecast for this year?s tourism revenue in Thailand is bleaker than the peak period in previous summers. From this part of the world, though, it?s a different story.

 ?Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines are having a field day,? says Manoj Saraf, managing director of Gainwell Travels and Tours. ?Since Malaysia Airlines pulled out, fares to Kuala Lumpur have increased. So Thai has been doing rather well.?

 Malaysia was never really competition for Thailand, but more for Singapore, he adds. ?So now, finally, Singapore Airlines can raise its fares, which they were forced to offer at rock-bottom prices to compete with Malaysia Airlines and Jet Star,? Saraf explains.

 Even with the raised fares ? up to about Rs 10,000 plus taxes from a normal rate of Rs 8,000 ? Calcutta-Bangkok-Calcutta flights are going almost full up till June 10 on Thai Airways. ?Singapore Airlines has upped fares from Rs 6,000 to Rs 14,000. So Thailand is the best option,? says Kaushik Aditya of Giananey Travels and Tours.

 ?The flurry of passengers on flights to Thailand is partly because there are only three airlines operating on this route ? Thai Airways, Singapore Airlines and Druk Air. But most importantly, holidays there, including hotels, is about 60-65 per cent of the cost for a trip to several destinations in India, like Goa or Kerala,? adds Aditya.

 There has also been a spillover to other destinations this summer, particularly with Emirates offering attractive packages. Tourist traffic to Dubai, Europe, Sri Lanka and Mauritius has gone up, while holiday travel to Malaysia has gone down.

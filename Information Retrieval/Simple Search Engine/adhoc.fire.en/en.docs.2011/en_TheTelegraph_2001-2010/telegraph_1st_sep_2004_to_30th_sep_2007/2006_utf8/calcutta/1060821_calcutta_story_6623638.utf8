 Retail is a marriage of business and technology. It is not a mere coincidence that the retail revolution in India has coincided with the growth of information technology (IT) in the country. A country like India that is a dream destination for retail is also complicated for the same reasons.

 These views were expressed by some of the panelists, comprising retail giants and representatives from the IT industry, at the Calcutta chapter of Infocom 2006 CXO Roundtable on Thursday evening. The talking point of the discussion was The Future of Retail in India and the contribution of ICT (information, communication and technology).

 Retail is being touted as the next big thing and India is considered a very hot destination for this. Infocom being the countrys biggest information, communication and technology exposition, it makes sense to ponder over the future of retail in our country, said Pramath Raj Sinha, managing director and chief executive officer of ABP Pvt Ltd.

 Were staring at a major retail revolution. Every brand worth its buy wants to join the gravy train. But are we geared to handle the tremendous accuracy and efficiency that would be required? In most cases, we witness that even the fundamentals of the supply chain are not in place, warned Minal Shanghavi, managing consultant, IBM Global Business Services.

 But the mood was upbeat about the support IT could provide to the retail industry. Not only in cities but all across the country, the penetration of retail would largely depend on the right use of available technology. From recruitment of thousands to measuring their efficiency, assessing them, communication with the hub and even a routine function like billing would require the help of technology, observed J.H. Mehta, president, Spencers Retail, RPG Group.

 The importance of communication was stressed by Himanshu Chakrawarti, COO-Landmark Retail, Trent Limited, as proper communication between the front-end and back-end is a must in getting the supply chain and product mix right. Technology can make your job easier but it cant provide the human touch. In retail, where we have mass consumers, communication is a must. We take regular feedback from our front-end workforce. This helps us understand the profile and the basic needs of every consumer.

 Online archive of heritage

 - Central help to digitise rare books, audio and video clips

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday inaugurated the Heritage Preservation Centre (HPC) at the State Central Library, near Ultadanga. The centre is working on an online archive of Bengal?s cultural and literary heritage. 

 The HPC is a unit of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), a wing of the Union ministry of communication and information technology. It is digitising rare books and other cultural heritage of Bengal with funds from the Centre. 

 ?Incredible advance in information technology has given us an opportunity to spread the power of knowledge. This is a momentous occasion. Thanks to the CDAC, our rich cultural and literary heritage is only a mouse-click away,? the chief minister said at the inauguration.

 The CDAC is currently using the state government?s infrastructure to collect books published before 1923 for digitisation. ?We will use a terabyte server (with very high storage capacity), which will feed the server of the National Informatics Centre. The centre will eventually upload the books on the Internet,? explained CDAC executive director Amiya Baran Saha. 

 This will enable people to access the digitised books without visiting the library, where the printed versions will be kept. 

 ?Not only rare books, we are storing other cultural heritage items of Bengal. Baul songs, voice and works of Rabindranath Tagore and video and audio of various historic events that took place in the state will be available on the Internet,? said Debabrata Bhadury, chief outreach coordinator (IT) of CDAC.

 ?Our target is to digitise about 14 million pages in 2005-2006. We have already scanned and stored seven million pages,? added Bhadury.

 Besides inaugurating the HPC, the chief minister on Tuesday distributed Rs 12,000 each to eight non-government and non-sponsored libraries of Calcutta, Howrah, North 24-Parganas and Birbhum.

 ?Understanding the importance of libraries in spread of knowledge, we made it mandatory for the state government to actively work for the betterment of our library culture in 1979. Now we have 12 government libraries and around 2,500 non-government aided and unaided libraries across the state. Our idea is to increase the number of libraries in Bengal and spread the network to the remotest blocks,? said Bhattacharjee.

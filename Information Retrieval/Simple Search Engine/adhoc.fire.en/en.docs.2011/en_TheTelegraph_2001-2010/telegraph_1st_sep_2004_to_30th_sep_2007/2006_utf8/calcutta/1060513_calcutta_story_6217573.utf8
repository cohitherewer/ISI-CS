The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Burrabazar in the dark

 A STAFF REPORTER

 More than 1,000 residents of Burrabazar gheraoed the local police station for more than an hour on Friday evening, protesting the prolonged power cuts over the past 24 hours. 

 They submitted a memorandum to the officer-in-charge, demanding immediate restoration of power supply.

 The situation was brought under control after senior police officers, including deputy commissioner of police (central) Ajay Kumar, and the local councillor rushed to the spot. 

 A CESC spokesman blamed overload by air-conditioners for the power cuts.

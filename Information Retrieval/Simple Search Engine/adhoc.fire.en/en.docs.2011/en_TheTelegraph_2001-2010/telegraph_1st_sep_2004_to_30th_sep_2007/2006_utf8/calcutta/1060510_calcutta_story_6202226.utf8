 Champagne and beige interiors, wooden flooring, Italian equipment and separate sections for hair, beauty, pedicure and manicure? Welcome to Lakme Beauty Salon (LBS), the latest to jump on to the fashion bandwagon rolling through town. 

 Spread over 1,000 sq ft, this plush salon located right in the heart of the city at Premalata Building on 39, Shakespeare Sarani, marks the east India foray of LBS.

 The salon was inaugurated on Tuesday afternoon by brand ambassador Raima Sen, looking gorgeous in a salmon pink tube dress. She lit the inaugural lamp and bedazzled the countless shutterbugs with her Suchitra Sen smile.

 The salon, on the lines of every other LBS in the country, offers both specialised and regular hair and beauty services, and also houses a neat retail section. Available here is the entire make-up and hair product range by Lakme. 

 The team of nine experts at the salon has been put through the paces at the Lakme Training Academy in Mumbai. They have been living in a mock parlour for the last three months to get the right feel. While hair expert Deepak Jahlan is the creative stylist in the salon, Ruby Ray is the area salon manager.

 Lakme launches two seasonal collections each year and unveils a complementary range of special services. Giving company to Happy Hour by Lakme, the summer 2006 collection interpreted by Ritu Beri that was unveiled at the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai this April, is a range of three beauty services on offer at the Shakespeare Sarani salon.

 The Happy Glow Facial priced between Rs 1,300 and Rs 1,500 promises to pamper the mind and spirit by using stone therapy with reflexology, pre-almond scrub and a rejuvenating eye soother.

 l this is completed with a hair-conditioning and blow-dry finish ? a real treat for the hair and skin. 

 You can also indulge in a Happy Touch Hand Facial that imparts the benefits of grapefruit and basil or the Happy Touch Foot Facial. A combination of a cinnamon scrub, tea tree and spearmint, this special pedicure embraces the Chakra Therapy to relax tense muscles and tired feet.

 Another summer special is the Sun Safe Facial. Available at Rs 900, this service claims to remove tan and lend a healthy glow. Ageless or enhancement facials are also on the beauty list, apart from a choice of 42 skin spa treatments.

 Our services are special because they dont end at the therapists table. We give our clients detailed attention and extra tips on maintenance of these services. What suits them, what doesnt and how they can enjoy long-lasting benefits of our beauty services...We have an answer to everything, explained Reema Chhabra, business manager of Lakme Beauty Services. 

 Thirty years and over 80 salons across the country. So what took Lakme so long to enter the east? The only thing that stopped Lakme from coming this side was the absence of enough physical bandwith. We intend to maintain the same standard in each Lakme salon and hence we didnt want to rush into it without proper infrastructure, explained Reema.

 With this entry, the beauty ball has been set rolling and you can expect eight more salons in eastern India before the year ends.

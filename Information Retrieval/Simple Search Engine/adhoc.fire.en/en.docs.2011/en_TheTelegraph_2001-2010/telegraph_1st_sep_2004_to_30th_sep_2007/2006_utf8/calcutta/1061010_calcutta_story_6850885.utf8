 Busy bee: Raima Sen. Picture 

 by Rashbehari Das

 If a fragile beauty is what she has been known as till now, Arjun Chakrabortys debut feature film is likely to break that notion. A self-willed teen who loves to shock the world with her daring actions is what Raima Sen will play in the film adaptation of Suchitra Bhattacharyas novel Neel Ghurni.

 I am very excited to do this role. My character is very headstrong and different from the roles I have done till now, which were mostly soft, said Raima, who spent the Pujas in town pandal-hopping and catching up with family.

 Koel Mullick was slated to feature in the role but Arjun says the decision to replace her was mutual understanding. I had thought of Koel but she hadnt been finalised. I think Raima is capable of doing full justice to the role. Its a very contemporary character and there are lots of shades in this woman. You scarcely come across a character like hers, says Arjun, ready to hit the floors by month-end.

 Built on complex relationships, the film is about a college girl besotted by a professor, pursuing him till he gives in. She walks out on her family for a live-in relationship with him. Arjun plays the professor.

 Neel Ghurni also features Mamata Shankar and Chaiti Ghosal, while Bickram Ghosh will score the background music. It will be produced by ARG Enterprise, a production company that Arjun has floated along with a few friends.

 Meanwhile, Raima is mapping a diverse career graph. She would be walking the ramp for star city designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee at the grand finale of the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai, on November 5.

 I am also doing a lot of commercials. I have been signed up as the brand ambassador of Ddamas. And the next round of Lakme advertisements will also start soon, said Raima, eagerly awaiting the release of a host of films. 

 In queue are the Vidhu Vinod Chopras multi-starrer Eklavya, the Farhan Akhtar-produced Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd with Shabana Azmi, Amisha Patel, Ayesha Takia, Ranvir Shorey and Boman Irani, Vinny Mitras Meridian with Irrfan, Abhay Deol, Arjun Rampal and Konkona Sen Sharma, and Mani Shankars spy thriller Mukhbir starring Suniel Shetty, Sameer Dattani and Om Puri.

 TV time: Arshad Warsi

 Circuit is in demand. After his verbal fireworks on the big screen, Arshad Warsi will be seen as the host in two shows on two channels.

 The big one is Sonys winter show Bigg Boss, adapted from the hit international format Big Brother. Arshad has been signed to play the part of the Sutradhar on the show.

 The omnipresent Bigg Boss, who sees and knows everything, now has someone to communicate his thoughts, wishes and commands in the form of Arshad. The funnyman is delighted with the role he has bagged for himself. 

 I have seen the international show and loved it, says Arshad. I know I am going to enjoy watching the 13 celebrities, the inmates of the Bigg Boss house, who will be constantly under surveillance and dictated to by the Bigg Boss. I have mixed feelings about not being in the house though. On one hand, it would have been fun and challenging to survive in that house while on the other, its going to be really tough living there.

 The celeb list of 13 will be revealed only when the show goes on air, sometime in November. 

 Before that you can catch Arshad as the host of Filmy Stock Exchange on Filmy. The game show gives Bollywood fans an opportunity to own their favourite stars. The game has started on October 1, and can be played on the mobile and Internet.

 We have tied up with msn.com and listed Indias top 30 filmstars on the shows site, Shailesh Kapoor, marketing head of Filmy, told Metro from Mumbai. On registration, one gets 1000 Filmy Rupees (FRs) to create ones portfolio. The stock prices change every hour on the basis of trading trends, box-office performance and industry news and gossip.

 To master this virtual stock market, one has to know for instance, one investing in Shah Rukh Khan has to know he has no releases after Don till end-2007. 

 Gossip counts only if it affects an actors career. If Aishwarya marries Abhishek, that should not affect her stocks unless she announces retirement or reduction of work, Kapoor explains.

 There will be no one winner, though. A player can redeem ones earned points for exciting prizes, from cars to cellphones.

 And who better than Munnabhais Man Everyday to guide you through the whole process.

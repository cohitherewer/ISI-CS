The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Buck pass in dengue backlash

 OUR BUREAU

 The dengue bomb is ticking, but state-run hospitals in the city are busy brushing the parasite under the carpet.

 The virus unit of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Wednesday that only one hospital ? National Medical College and Hospital ? had sent blood samples of suspected dengue patients for tests and close to half of them have tested positive.

 ?The hospital sent us five blood samples on Monday and Tuesday. Two have tested positive,? said an ICMR official. He feels the picture at other hospitals ? if they bother to send blood samples to ICMR ? should not be much different.

 But the hospitals are reluctant to acknowledge this. ?We have not come across any suspected dengue case and so there is no question of sending blood samples for tests,? said A.N. Biswas, deputy superintendent at Medical College and Hospital.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Wednesday claimed there had been no fresh dengue case. ?No case was reported today,? said mayoral council member (health) Subodh De. 

 ?Reports from the School of Tropical Medicine and the state health department indicate that there have been 14 dengue cases in the CMC area since January,? said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. ?In June and July, four cases were detected. One died. The civic health department has identified wards 89 and 93 as vulnerable pockets.?

 The wards, both in south Calcutta, include Gobinda Banerjee Lane and KP Roy Lane and the Katju Nagar area (behind South City).

 The civic authorities asserted that they were gearing up to face any emergency.

 Besides ICMR and School of Tropical Medicine, a private pathological clinic on Harish Mukherjee Road has joined hands with the CMC to conduct serological tests for dengue at an affordable rate.

 Calcutta High Court, meanwhile, has admitted a petition that alleges that dengue and malaria have resurfaced in the city as the civic authorities have failed to carry out earlier directives of the court. 

 A division bench of Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta and Justice Sanjib Banerjee asked the petitioner, Idris Ali, to serve notice on the CMC. The matter has been fixed for hearing on Thursday.

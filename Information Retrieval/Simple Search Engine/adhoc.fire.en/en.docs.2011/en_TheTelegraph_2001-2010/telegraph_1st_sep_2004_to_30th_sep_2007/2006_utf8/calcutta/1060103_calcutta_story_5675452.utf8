The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A date with drama, in dreamland

 They used to hunt rats and had blind faith in witchcraft and quacks. But dreamland beckoned and fate had other plans for them. After three years of hard work, a team of 14 schoolboys from Dhapganj, eight km from Jalpaiguri, set foot in Calcutta for the first time last month to show off their skills on stage.

 Though in awe of their much-experienced competitors, the team managed to impress the audiences in the finals of the 8th Ganga-Jamuna Natya Utsav, organised by Aneek, at Sisir Mancha, on December 26 and 29.

 The audiences were even more surprised to learn that till three years ago the boys had no idea what theatre was. Their parents work in tea gardens or are hired hands in agricultural fields, belonging to communities like the Santhal, Orawn, Mech, Rava, Rajbanshi and Toto.

 Bratya, the play that the group staged at the fest, was an implicit protest against the injustice meted out to the backward communities in India. The story is a collage of various events ? how Banacharis were discarded by the Aryans, Ekalavya deprived by Dronacharya to establish the supremacy of Arjun, and Hitler?s anti-Jew campaign. 

 The play depicts how over the decades the torturer has assumed new identities and taken to new ways of exploiting the vulnerable. But the plight of those exploited remains the same.

 ?These youths have seen violence. They have witnessed the protest by the Kamtapuris and the police retaliation,? said Souvik Kunda, a teacher in the government-sponsored high school where the boys study.

 ?Bratya is their third production. They have been into drama only for the past three years,? added Arnab Banerjee, their drama teacher. 

 Their efforts have already started paying off. The group bagged the second prize in the finals of the drama festival in Calcutta (picture below).

 ?We are so happy to be here. The sound and light facilities are better,? said Sujit Kumur, the only one to take part in all three productions of the amateur theatre group. 

 ?I like Calcutta better than Dhapganj,? confessed Nikhil Mondol, another member of the group.

 Convocation call

 Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan hosted its annual convocation ceremony on December 11. The function saw 250 students from the Bhowanipore and Salt Lake branches of the institute receive their postgraduate diplomas in management and communication studies.

 All-India awards for the best project on film and television studies and for the highest marks obtained in public relations and marketing management courses were also handed out.

 Shoubhonik Choudhuri and Anjali Singh were awarded gold medals in appreciation of their efforts in corporate public relations.

 The programme, held at Sisir Mancha, concluded with a medley of performances by the current batch of students.

 One of the premier management institutes of Calcutta, Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM), also held its annual convocation ceremony on December 28. IISWBM opened in 1954 and is one of the oldest management institutes in the country.

 The convocation ceremony saw almost 180 students from different management programmes get their diplomas. 

 The institute, which has identified five thrust areas ? academic, faculty, consultancy, research and fellowship and strategic development ? plans on evolving its academic and administrative set-up, to meet the rising expectations and nature of management education in India. 

 The chief guest for the ceremony, chairman of Nicco Industries, Rajive Kaul, said: ?Our premier management institutes are rated amongst the best in Asia. Most MNCs are seconding Indians for their overseas positions. This bodes very well for the managers of tomorrow. I firmly believe that our country is on the threshold of a significant knowledge space, as Indians have always had the ability to absorb new technology quicker and better. We have now overtaken America as the country with the largest knowledge pool in the world.?

 Carnival that cares

 The annual carnival of Birla High School (junior section), held on December 17, was special for us.

 Along with participants from other city schools, underprivileged children were also invited to join in the festivities. We loved showing them around the campus and playing games with them . Tattoo artistes doubling as clowns kept us in good spirits.

 The proceeds from some of the stalls were donated to a school for rural children. Joy shared is joy doubled, so our carnival was one with a difference. 

 We will ardently wait for the carnival next year and hope that we make it as joyous as the one this year.

 The Diary

 Fly fear free

 Step closer, dispel your fears,

 Your burdens of the worried years:

 Don?t blur the world through your veil of tears. 

 Has your path been crossed by crime?

 Beguiled and hoodwinked by time,

 Shall you let your Swan Song chime?

 Unravelling the mysteries of the book of life

 Cutting through chapters with fate?s tarnished knife,

 Fling it away to end your strife!

 Rustle through its pages with your fingers own,

 Show yourself before you CAN be shown

 Leave nothing left unknown...

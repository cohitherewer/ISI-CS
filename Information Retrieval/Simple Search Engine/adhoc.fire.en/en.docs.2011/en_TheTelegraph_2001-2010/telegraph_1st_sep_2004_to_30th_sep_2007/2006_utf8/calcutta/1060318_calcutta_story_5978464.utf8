 What: Dulux ColourFutures 2006, a fashion show presented by ICI Paints.

 Where: The Park. 

 When: Thursday evening. 

 The concept: ColourFutures, an annual forecast that predicts colour palettes, reaches out beyond the field of home and interiors, touching the world of fashion and more. The key colour of 2006 is golden kiwi, a hue that is expected to take the fashion and home scene by storm.

 This year, ICI Paints has chosen five distinct lifestyle trends ? Stylised Simplicity, Active Contrast, Reconstruction, Atmosphere and Extravagance ? that were interpreted by five Delhi-based designers at the show. 

 The show: A refreshingly crisp catwalk, with great silhouettes, splash of hues and brisk choreography. 

 The show began with Payal Jains interpretation of Stylised Simplicity. Lots of whites and creams with a dash of orange and scarlet made up this line.

 Interesting skirts teamed with bikini tops were the highlight of this collection that boasted silver sequins, intricate chikankari and pretty Parsi embroidery detailing.

 The second interpretation by Deepika Gehani depicted Active Contrast. Her upbeat collection was all about pop-artish prints. Flirty, asymmetrical dresses complemented by funky accessories described the mood well.

 The third collection by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna depicted Reconstruction. The colour story revolved around subdued shades of greens and earthy browns. The fabrics were varied with an interesting interplay of velvet, chiffon and felt, embellished with a mild dose of glittering gold.

 Anju Modis interpretation of Atmosphere had a serene feel to it. Dominated by pearly whites and sky blues, a bit of dull gold broke the monotony and accentuated the line. Empire line dresses, corsets, flowy skirts and sexy tunics teamed with denims were the highlights of this dreamy collection.

 The finale, by designer Mandira Wirk, showcased Extravagance. Sunny colours and vibrant fabrics in tie-and-dye dominated Mandiras line. The designer very effectively used prints and stones to create an interesting collection.

 Voiceover: We at ICI Paints have been predicting colours and trends locally since 2003. But for the last three years, all our colour consultants around the world have started zeroing in on certain similarities in the trends globally. And this year we are showcasing the key colours and lifestyle trends through this fashion show, said Nicki Barton, global marketing manager of ICI Paints.

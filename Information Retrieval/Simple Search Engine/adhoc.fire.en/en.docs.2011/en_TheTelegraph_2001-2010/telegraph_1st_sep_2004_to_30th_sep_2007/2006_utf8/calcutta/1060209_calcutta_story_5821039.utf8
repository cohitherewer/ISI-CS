 Fair offers grass cover

 Rectangular patches of greenish yellow grass amidst a muddy wasteland ? the Maidan, three days after the final day of the Calcutta Book Fair.

 The remnants of green were obviously the patches covered by the stalls and thus spared the marauding that the rest of the Maidan had to suffer for 11 days.

 Now, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild has come up with the grand plan of planting quick-growing Chinese grass to restore the mutilated Maidan. The restoration drive, pegged at Rs 7 lakh, marks a first in what is meant to be the last Book Fair on the Maidan.

 ?We have already spoken to the minister-in-charge of forests Jogesh Chandra Burman. We will start as soon as the ground is cleared,? said Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary of the Guild.

 ?We have time till February 20 to hand over the portion of the Maidan, but now with our plan of sowing China grass, we have asked for an extension till March 10,? he added.

 The expert word on the Chinese grass project, however, is hardly encouraging. ?Using Chinese grass for such a vast stretch of land is an absurd idea,? said Somenath Mukherjee, deputy chief conservator of forests (urban forestry).

 ?Growing of Chinese grass requires enormous expertise, maintenance, manpower and a lot of money. And the variety of grass is hardly grown in Bengal. It will probably have to be brought in from states like Maharashtra or Delhi,? he added.

 The solution, felt Mukherjee, could lie in using the commonly-found ?dubba grass?. But even that would take some time. ?After preparing a detailed landscape plan, the land needs to be ploughed, levelled and rolled before the actual planting,? explained Mukherjee.

 The Guild also plans to do up the tank adjoining the Book Fair ground.

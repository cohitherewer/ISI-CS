 Waterbody upkeep off civic hands

 After slapping notices under Inland Fisheries Act, 1984, against the filling up of over 150 waterbodies, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has found that it no longer enjoys the power to do so. 

 The fisheries department pointed out last week that a notification was amended to deny the municipal commissioner the right.

 Following a gazette notification on August 5, 1994 (no. 1815-fish/C1/9R17/84-3), the municipal commissioner had been acting as the agent of the state fisheries department in the CMC area. 

 Under section 17(A) of Inland Fisheries Act, 1984, the incumbent enjoyed the right to take over the management of any waterbody measuring more than five cottahs. 

 The CMC had recently taken over a waterbody in Cossipore and spent about Rs 5 lakh on its restoration. The civic body had also slapped a notice to stop the filling up of a waterbody near the Park Circus connector. 

 The state fisheries department verbally intimated to the CMC that the gazette notification has been modified recently and the municipal commissioner is no longer the agent of the department. 

 According to officials in the fisheries department, land prospectors and realtors may have played a role in the amendment of the notification. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has directed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to obtain a copy of the amended notification from the fisheries department before taking up the matter with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Bandyopadhyay wrote to the department last week, requesting a copy of the order.

 ?We have no idea about the amended notification. We must go through it first,? said the mayor.

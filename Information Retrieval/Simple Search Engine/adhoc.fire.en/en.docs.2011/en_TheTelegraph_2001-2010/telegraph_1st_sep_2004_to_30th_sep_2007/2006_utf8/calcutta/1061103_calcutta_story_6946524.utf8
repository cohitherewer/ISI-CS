 In times of terror 

 - A voice 

 raised against violence

 The rickshaw-pullers Journey through a time of terror in Eleena Baniks paintings 

An Eleena Banik work 

 Three rickshaw-pullers draw their vehicles through the street. Their faces are expressionless, pale or bloodshot, but their twisted bodies display the ravages of time and pain.

 A crescent moon, crows on the hoods of carriages, a decapitated human head on a seat, these are the subjects of Journey through a time of terror by Eleena Banik. The recent series of paintings voices a protest against the violence and terrorism in the world.

 Lately, my work has been very bright with lots of colours. But the canvasses of His/Her Story are meant to be dark, they are a protest against violence, elaborates Banik, whose works will be on display at a Mumbai art gallery from December 4.

 The oils, circa 1994-95, record her experience of violence. I feel we have a duty to protest violence. We give birth, which itself is a violent process. Yet as mothers, we hand over toy guns to our children, as if violence is something to cherish, says Banik.

 Her own reactions have been tempered by her mothers experience of the blood-letting in the 70s. Journey through a time of terror represents the incidents that happened around her para in south Calcutta. Newspapers have battered her with news of wars, terrorist attacks and domestic violence.

 But her biggest blow was when her father was stabbed by a criminal and he lost a finger. The oil that recollects this incident is the gloomiest in the series. 

 On her canvasses, figures with knives and guns threaten men and women with cords running out of their hearts.

 These are strings or blood vessels that symbolise relationships. I have made them multi-coloured because I want to make them look like synthetic pipes. For me, all modern relationships are similar to artificial disposable stuff, explains Banik.

 So is there any hope? Quiet doves gathered around a bearded figure and a figure reaching out of the frame to clutch the moon, are a few works showing some respite. My dream of a world without violence is as unrealistic as clutching a moon. But one has to make a first move, smiles Banik.

 Her impatience is visible in her drawings and no-holds-barred compositions. But isnt she afraid that art collectors may find her works too grim or brazen?

 The response has been good so far. There are people who like to hang pretty pictures in their living rooms, while there are some who give a thought to some serious issues, she concludes.

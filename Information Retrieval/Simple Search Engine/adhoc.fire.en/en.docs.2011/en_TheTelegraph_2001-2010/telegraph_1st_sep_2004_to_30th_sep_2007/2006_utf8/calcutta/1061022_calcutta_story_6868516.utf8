An indoor sports complex and rooms for visiting teams, 

international invitational tournaments and coaching clinics for rookies, better 

lights at the ground and tea etiquette... All in the quest for excellence.

CC amp;FC of 1792 vintage, the oldest cricket-playing 

club in the world, the first club to play hockey in these parts, host to the 

first-ever rugby match in India, believes it can once again become a premier 

sporting club in the world for families and non-professionals.

What I see is a tremendous shortage of built-up brick-and-mortar 

infrastructure. Over the years, we have perhaps not been able to build as much 

as we would have liked to, because this ground is in lease from the army, new 

president Noomi Mehta tells Metro.

As the first step in a slew of infrastructure-upgrade 

projects lined up, the club management is submitting plans to the army for an 

indoor sports complex in the north-west corner. We will also try to find space 

for increasing our clubhouse structure. Earlier, we never felt the need, because 

we were a male-dominated sports club. A changing room and a bar were enough for 

our needs, he smiles.

CC amp;FC is more of a family club now with new additions 

like the swimming pool and gym. Efforts are on to provide more opportunities for 

the ladies and children with the indoor sports complex.

But more than anything else, we need some covered 

space where members can just sit and lounge around. We are looking at extending 

the first-floor area, if the army authorities allow us. We can cover the existing 

swimming pool area and have an atrium of sorts, suggests Noomi (as he is known 

in the club world).

On the sporting front, the new management would like 

to improve the ground conditions further, sort out a waterlogging problem in the 

southeast corner and also improve illumination standards.

I would like to emphasise that our membership should 

once again be focused on sports. They need not actively play any game, but should 

be sports-minded and help in organising tournaments or else contribute through 

their own resources, declares Noomi.

The club is also keen that the membership profile 

becomes younger. The president, a keen sportsman himself, is planning to have 

sports stalwarts in the club ranks like Jamshed Nassiri, Santo Mitra and Pradip 

Chowdhury to interact with members on the field to inspire them.

If we have even a few of our members playing any 

sport at the highest level, then its a huge bonus. We could then act as a bridge 

with the Maidan. I also think CC amp;FC can contribute by once again encouraging 

the middle-class bhadralok to play soccer, feels Noomi.

With an eye on hosting invitational fixtures with 

overseas participation, the Ballygunge club is feeling the need for quality accommodation. 

If we can have some rooms, it would give us a great opportunity to tie up with 

some of the big soccer clubs in Europe and have some coaching schemes going. We 

can also host international matches, says the club president.

CC amp;FC is drawing up plans for 15 to 20 rooms for 

army approval. The club will then have a tea lounge with two-tier seating overlooking 

the field, even offering tips to the members on tea preparation and etiquette. 

The indoor sports complex will include badminton, table tennis and basketball.

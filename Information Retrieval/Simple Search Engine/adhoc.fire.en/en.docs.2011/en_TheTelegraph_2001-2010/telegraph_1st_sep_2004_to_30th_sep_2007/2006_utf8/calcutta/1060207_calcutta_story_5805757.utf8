 What: Launch of the spring-summer 2006 collection by Satya Paul.

 Where: The store at Forum.

 When: February 4.

 Take a look: The exclusive collection of saris is mostly in georgettes, with some crepes and tissues thrown in. From flower patterns to nature designs to abstract motifs, the concepts and the designs are an eclectic blend of tradition and modernity. 

 Saris with ornate mukaish work all over are special offerings for the summer wedding season. For parties, there are beautifully shaded ones with light work on them.

 Saris are also studded with original, certified Swarovski crystals. The collection uses a lot of zari work on hand-painted drapes, as well.

 Pocket pinch: Rs 15,000-plus.

 Voiceover: The idea is to keep on evolving through more innovations, exploring greater varieties and catering to the choices of all, says Alpana Binani at the store.

 Global grub

 What: International Food Festival 2006, in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: Saturday Club. 

 When: Saturday evening.

 The festival: The club lawns were dotted with small pavilions serving up an array of mouth-watering dishes from diverse cuisine. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, England, Italy, China, Sweden and India were represented on the menu.

 The music, however, was strictly Indian, with the club members grooving to Bollywood hits like Kajra re, Jhalak and Dus bahane churned out by DJ Feroze.

 Voiceover: The International Food Festival is one of the most awaited events on the club calendar. This is the best time to dig into the cuisine of various countries, said DJ Feroze.

 Gadget gallery

 What: Launch of The Gallery.

 Where: 1, Narendra Nagar, B.T. Road, near Dunlop Crossing.

 When: February 1.

 Take a look: The store is an exclusive outlet for all BPL Sanyo merchandise. The newly launched 21-inch Super Slim TV is also available at this swank 800 sq ft outlet.

 Voiceover: The next step is to develop our distribution network in the city to attain a particular market share, said V.G. Rajagopalan, marketing head of BPL Sanyo.

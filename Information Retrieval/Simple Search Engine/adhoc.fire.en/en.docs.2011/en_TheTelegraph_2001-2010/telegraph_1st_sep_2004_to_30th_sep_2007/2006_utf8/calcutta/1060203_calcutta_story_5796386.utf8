 Obsessed with the beauties of nature since early childhood, Nirmal Dutta is a landscape artist whose works are reminiscent of early 19th century romantic poetry. Fluid and lyrical, his canvases express his passion for nature through a rhythmical blend of lines and colours. The ongoing exhibition of his paintings is the result of his recent efforts at portraying the verdant landscape of Bengal. Depicting its picturesque, rural scenes with the eye of an antiquarian, Dutta explores nature in all its glory, painting village vignettes, fields of bountiful golden corn and rivers and streams flowing across the virgin countryside. Besides these mute moments of natural beauty, the works on show also include sketches of men and women, their customs and habitats. Developed through a balanced synthesis of oriental and occidental art, Dutta?s paintings capture reality adorned with an element of fancy. In shades of green, yellow, white and black, they also bear the essence of the heart and soul of Bengal.

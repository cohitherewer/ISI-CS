The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CAS buck passes

 - DUAL DEMAND FOR BROADCASTERS

 A STAFF REPORTER

 With less than a week to go for Delhi High Court?s conditional access system (CAS) roll-out deadline in the four metros, the ball is in the channel broadcasters? court.

 At the series of meetings conducted by the information and broadcasting ministry in the Capital in the past few weeks, multi-system operators (MSO) and cable operators have made several demands of broadcasters before CAS can be implemented. 

 The list includes broadcasters declaring the maximum retail price they will charge for each channel under CAS, and offer the channels on an a la carte basis rather than in the present bundled form.

 Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF), a representative body of broadcasters, is meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday to discuss CAS-related issues. But IBF members are unlikely to agree on either point. ?MRP and a la carte should be left to market forces,? said a member broadcaster of IBF. ?MRP on each channel cannot be declared, since purchasing power of viewers varies greatly from city to city. Also, an MSO in Calcutta may offer a different margin to its operators than an MSO in Delhi, forcing us to negotiate deals individually with them,? he added.

 ?Declaring a la carte rates would also allow the anti-CAS lobby to say that the combined cable subscription would be much higher than the present for consumers,? pointed out a sports channel official.

 On March 10, Delhi High Court had asked the Centre to implement CAS in the four metros within ?four weeks?.

 He touched the sky before Tricolour

 In 1956, Squadron Leader N.K. Sarkar was felicitated by the Number 2 Air Force Academy for having logged 2,200 flying hours without an accident. 

 Fifty years on, seeing the octogenarian gazing vacantly at the evening sky in his Tollygunge house, it is tough to picture him at the cockpit in control of the joystick. He not only kept a firm grip but passed on his knowledge to pilots who formed the Indian Air Force.

 Young Sarkar had touched the sky long before the country gained Independence, with the Royal Indian Air Force. His career took off by accident, though. 

 When Japan bombed Rangoon during World War II, I was a medical student there. A desperate trek for 45 days reached the 19-year-old to Imphal, from where he took a train to Calcutta with other evacuees. Recruitment was on for the army at Moulali. It struck me that if I opted for the air force, I could fly back to Burma. Thankfully, in those days, they did not ask for 10 certificates at every step. 

 Thus it was that the youngster left to train on how to command a parade and learn to eat with fork and spoon. Leafing through his dog-eared logbooks, Sarkar recalls his first flight in November 1943. I was under Flying Officer Murdoch. He was a short guy who thought tall, a toothless grin lights up his face. 

 Within 12 hours, he had qualified for solo flight with his Dehaveland Tiger Moth Biplane. Advanced training followed with a two-seater Harvard Trainer. The war was still on. Soon, he was making sorties to Imphal with 20 mm guns, dropping light bombs and carrying camera for reconnaissance. The Japanese were already retreating. So, we had a smooth run, he shrugs.

 As the freedom bells began to chime, Sarkar was sent to England for training as flying instructor. He was among those made responsible for training of the nascent Indian Air Force. The new recruits were trained at Begumpet and then Ambala.

 But being an air force pilot did not mean all work and no play. Sarkar had mastered a technique of formation flight and was called upon to show his aerial tricks at Eden Gardens in the early 50s while he was training the National Cadet Corps. The show was meant to create interest among the public about the air force so that they would join. The 10-minute show ended with an awe-inspiring inverted flight.

 After 13 years in the air, he put in his papers in 1956, much to the chagrin of friends and authorities. Lazy people take pension. I had joined the army for adventure, he says, without a trace of regret in his voice.

 His only regret is the number of friends he lost to engine failures and bad airfield conditions. Now, flying is as easy as driving on the streets, states the 83-year-old dismissively.

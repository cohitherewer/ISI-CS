 Theatre bonanza

 An annual event much awaited by the citys theatre-loving community, Nandikars National Theatre Festival assumes special significance in the contemporary socio-cultural and political context. Being inaugurated today, its 23rd edition features a seminar on childrens theatre and exhibitions on Tapas Sen and on women in Indian theatre, besides 27 performances of plays. With participants from leading theatre groups of Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Chandigarh and West Bengal, as well as a troupe from Sweden, the festival includes plays in several Indian languages and English. Being staged today, Badal Sircars ... And Indrajit (dir: Jayadev Hattangady; produced by Kalashray, Mumbai; 2.30 pm) depicts man in pursuit of his ideal, reaching a point of lethargy and futility, and perhaps, ending in self-annihilation. Orjan (a scene from the play appears above) is the story of an enormous golden eagle who is helped by a small wren to overcome his fear of heights and flying. Also, The Man, The Lady and Something In The Belly, a tale of love and longing, dreams and disappointments, fantasy and fulfilment (both plays directed by Peter Engkvist; produced by Teater Pero, Sweden; 6 pm).

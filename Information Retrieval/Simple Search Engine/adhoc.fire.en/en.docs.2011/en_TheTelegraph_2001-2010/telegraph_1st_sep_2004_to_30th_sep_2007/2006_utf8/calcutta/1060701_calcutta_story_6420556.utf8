 Pollution tests for cops, bus drivers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A medical check-up will be conducted on traffic policemen and drivers of state buses to ascertain the effects of pollution on them.

 The decision to conduct the check-up, for which the government has tied up with Peerless Hospital, follows complaints from various quarters about the effects of pollution on policemen and drivers.

 The plan was finalised at a meeting transport minister Subhas Chakraborty held with managing director of Peerless Hospital Shyamal Bose at Writers? Buildings on Friday.

 Initially, 200 traffic cops who are deployed on roads and 400 CSTC drivers will appear for the check-up. Drivers of private buses, too, will be enrolled at a later stage.

 The tests on traffic cops will be conducted on July 1 and 2 at Police Training School, in Alipore. For the bus drivers, a camp will be held at CSTC?s Maniktala depot in the last week of July. Another camp will be held at the Salt Lake stadium for drivers of private buses.

 ?Peerless Hospital had approached us, stating that it would conduct the tests free,? the transport minister said. ?We agreed to the proposal, as we felt that such tests were necessary. The reports will be accepted by the government, as the hospital has both qualified doctors and proper infrastructure.? 

 A large number of traffic policemen suffer from breathing problems, resulting from their prolonged exposure to poison fumes.

 Of the 2,000-odd drivers of state buses, most are afflicted with bronchial diseases and vision problems. ?If any of them is found to be unfit to sit behind the wheel, he will be deployed on some other duty,? the minister said.

 Echoing his stand, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim said if any cop is found to be suffering from a ?major ailment?, he will be shifted to some other department.

 Peerless managing director Bose said the cops and drivers would undergo lung function test, vision test, night blindness test, audiometry and blood sugar test. 

 ?We will hand over the report to the person concerned and submit a copy to the government as well,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The most mismatched couple

 RAHUL BOSE and MALLIKA SHERAWAT were caught chatting on Marine Drive, and it wasnt all about love. Here are snatches of the sparring game between the Pyaar Ke Side Effects stars

 RAHUL: Hi Mallika.

 MALLIKA: Hi Rahul. Are we going to fight or we are gonna have peaceful talks?

 R: One cant predict what Mallika wants to do. Im here with peace, love and compassion in my heart.

 M: (Laughs) Rahul you have come here... Yahaan baith kar aap intelligent baatein karenge. Bade bade baton ka gyan denge. Bade bade angrezike shabd istemal karenge. Aur main Jat hun and no self-respecting Jat is literate. So yeh sab baatein mere sar ke upar se jayengi.

 R: Oh God! There is no point in being politically correct around you.

 Praise you, praise me

 R: Everyone has been saying that we are two different people. There is a clash in our personalities you are very flamboyant, very commercial and Im not that commercial; and now we both are together for Pyaar Ke Side Effects.

 M: Its so simple. You come from this art field... tumhare liye awards bahut important hai. I come from this commercial field... mujhe box-office chahiye

 R: Maine kabhi nahin kaha ki mujhe awards chahiye. Awards are great but they are certainly not what I vote for. Its a lovely sound what you have given but its all crap.

 M: You know Rahul, when I first got the script, I was in awe of working with you. You are such an intelligent actor and I was like: Wow! Rahul Bose ke saath kaam karne ka mauka mil raha hai. I was very excited but also very nervous. Also, it was a big challenge for me, I had to match up to your standards.

 R: Oh Mallika, this is deeply embarrassing.

 M: Embarrassing! Mujhe to taareef bahut achha lagta hai, mere bhi koi taareef karo.

 R: I think no actor can act alone and every actor is as good as the other person who he is acting with. So, yes, I am extremely concerned about people I act with. Sometimes I have acted with bad actors and I regret it. So I guess when we both got together and we did the workshop, rehearsals and discussions, I realised you are a very hard-working person and that you want to learn.

 Marry me not

 M: A woman has her own stand and a man has his own and its scary when you have to get together and be in a matrimonial... Rahul, I would like to ask you why arent you married till now. Kya rugby ke dauran koi damage hua kya? (Laughs).

 R: How did u guess Mallika?

 M: Oh God! I exactly know where this is heading... I am talking about mental damage.

 R: If I was mentally damaged, somebody would feel sorry for me and marry me. I am sure lots of men have asked you for marriage and you have not answered them.

 M: The day I get a guy who does all household work, who takes care of me, mere pair dabaye... meri seva kare... aarti utare... He would fast on Karwa Chauth for me

 R: Thats quite fair. 

 M: Will you do that for your lady love?

 R: If I was in love, I would not care about gender. I dont believe in gender. I had a family where my father used to cook and my mother used to work.

 M: Rahul, now at 39, you only have two options for getting married. Either you get a divorcee or a widow at the age of 39.

 R: Oh dear me! Do you know how many women are going to hate you after listening to this?

 M: How trapped were you feeling when I asked you (to marry her) in the film? You were more interested in the match and the remote control.

 R: Oh, thats completely autobiographical. If a woman is asking me about marriage when the cricket match of India vs Australia is on, theres no question. But Sid (his character) is not like me. In general, he is funny and he really loves Trisha (Mallika). Kaafi confused hai. At the end, its a happy ending.

 M: Dont leak out the secret.

 R: Its a romantic comedy, Mallika. Theres no secret. Its like asking about a James Bond film, will James Bond die?

 Zero love game

 R: The first thing that people ask me now is how it was working with Mallika the kind of films she has done and the kind of image you have You know its really embarrassing.

 M: Working with me is embarrassing!

 R: Let me finish. I have the reputation of doing these sexy kind of films. When I came into this entire thing, I knew that you were looking upon me as this sex object because I am so desirable. You were looking at me with those hungry eyes you know. My reputation is of the lady killer.

 (Both start laughing)

 M: You really told me that Mallika you have to become literate now and you kept correcting my English throughout the shooting. You promised you are going to read Shakespeare to me.

 R: I thought I would read Hamlet to you but then I realised we would have to start with Grade 4 and Grade 5 and gradually grade ourselves up... Lots of journalists are very shy to ask me how it was working with the most sexy actress of India.

 M: They ask you how it was kissing me?

 R: All kinds of questions. Then I ask them: Do you want to ask if there was sexual arousal when I saw Mallika? They say: Nothing like that. Its just that maybe you felt I say: Zero.

 M: Dont say zero. Its a romantic comedy.

 R: Okay, off-screen zero. And then they ask me was there something physical. I say hugging, kissing. Then they ask whether I was comfortable then. I say: Of course! I am an actor, baba.

 Man and woman

 M: These guys who call themselves metrosexual, they are actually copying women. They get their hands waxed, they even get their eyebrows done. Are you metrosexual, Rahul?

 R: No way, I have never got any such thing done. Once I played a woman and got my chest waxed. No one told me its gonna be that painful. Nobel prize to women for pain tolerance.

 M: Thanks for saying women are better than men in tolerance. Someone said when God was creating men, he was just experimenting and the perfect thing he came out with was women.

 R: Oh God, we are totally in love.

 M: In the movie.

 R: No, right now as we speak there is so much of love. Perhaps the most intense, serious, evolutionary, growing love affair in the history of Bollywood.

 M: The most mismatched couple in the history of Bollywood and that is what Pyaar Ke Side Effects is all about.

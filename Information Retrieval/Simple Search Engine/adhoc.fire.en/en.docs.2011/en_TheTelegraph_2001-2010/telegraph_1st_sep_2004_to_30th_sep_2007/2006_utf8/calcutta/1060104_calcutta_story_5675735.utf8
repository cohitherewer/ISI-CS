 Known for their social and political commitment, the works of French artist Enki Bilal represent some of the most powerful and original creations in the graphic arts. Having grown up as an immigrant, his works naturally dwell on the theme of return, along with the dangers and uncertainties associated with it. Better placed than most to ponder the miseries and woes that come with the chaos of humanity, enkibilalinindia, the ongoing exhibition of his drawings, sculptures and films, is dominated by symbols of alienation and estrangement. Displaying his many facets in a multi-cultural country, the show is a tribute to the inordinate dimensions of his art. Seeking to envision modern India by his creative imagination, Bilal offers us slices of life that rouse us from the warp of our complacent sensations. The suffering woman-figure, an interesting motif in his paintings, embodies his fear of a world torn by strife and violence, and his concern to save the world from the threat of imminent doom and destruction. Presented by the French Embassy in India, the French Association, Calcutta and Victoria Memorial.

 Event: An exhibition of drawings, sculptures amp; films by Enki Bilal 

When: Till January 7, 10 am - 4 pm 

Where: Victoria Memorial Hall

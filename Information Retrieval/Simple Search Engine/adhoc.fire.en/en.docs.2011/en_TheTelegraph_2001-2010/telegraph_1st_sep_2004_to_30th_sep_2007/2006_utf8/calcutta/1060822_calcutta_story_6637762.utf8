The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You cant get through this week wtihout

Filling up your shopping bags

 Its that 

time of the year again, when you dont need to cook up excuses to hit the malls. 

With Puja round the corner, its high time you set out on Mission Splurge. The 

end-of-season sales over, the brand new stocks displayed, now is the time to hit 

the stores. Go for the seasons hottest accessories or go all out for a whole 

new look; do what you will but definitely push Puja shopping higher up your agenda 

this week. Look at it this way: the sooner you begin, the more loot youll manage 

to collect. So what are you waiting for, Christmas? 

Ditching the umbrella 

Youve been good this monsoon clicking open the umbrella at the slightest drizzle 

or running under cover the days your in-house weatherman went all wrong. This 

week, ditch all forms of protection umbrella or raincoat as you make merry 

while the sun doesnt shine. Drizzle or downpour, just roll up your denims, bare 

those feet and feel the pitter patter turn into the sweetest sound of music. And 

yes, dont forget to dry up at home and down that cuppa lest you go down with 

a wicked virus.

Joining the KANK debate

You must have totally loved it or completely hated it, but you just cant 

afford to be left out of the big Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna debate. From TV 

screens to dance floors, a question mark looms large over the modern marriage, 

thanks to KJo. The question of the hour: did pop-in-law Sexy Sam do the right 

thing by telling bahu Maya to leave his son and give love and happiness 

a chance. Join the debate, take a stand, make yourself heard today; after all, 

kal ho naa ho!

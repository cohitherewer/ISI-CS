 Theres a dare scare in tech town

 - Sector V labelled highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS following survey

 They are young and they are busy, they have cash to spare and they hardly have a care. But its time they did care. For the dreaded A-word is stalking techies and call centre employees in zip, zap, zoom Sector V.

 In a survey conducted by West Bengal AIDS Prevention and Control Society, the high-stress Sector V family has been found highly vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. The growth that IT industry in Calcutta has witnessed in the past few years has been phenomenal. Whenever an area witnesses so much growth it attracts all sorts of elements who earn their livelihood on the periphery, says Dr A. Talukdar, project officer, West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society.

 Of late, the number of sex workers in this area has gone up dramatically. Majority of the workforce in the industry is very young with high disposable income and is in contact with the sex workers. Many of these sex workers are carriers of HIV. We conducted a need-based survey to determine if we needed to intervene and found many techies indulging in unsafe sex, added Talukdar.

 The survey was conducted over a period of two months involving 97 sex workers, operating in and around Sector V, at bars, hotels and motels in Salt Lake, Ultadanga and along VIP Road. As most of the sex workers in Salt Lake are not brothel based, they were difficult to trace. They are in touch with their regular Sector V clients on mobile phones. They meet in a neighbourhood bar or restaurant and then go to hotels mushrooming in the area, says Talukdar.

 The Society has decided to intervene. We are going to make these sex workers and their regular clients aware about the consequences. We would also conduct tests for sexually-transmitted diseases. Meeting points like bars, restaurants and hotels are being taken into confidence, says Mahesh Nathan, head, project support unit of the Society.

 With the Bangalore bug where checking casual sex at and around the workplace gives so many IT employers sleepless nights soon threatening to become the Calcutta chromosome, the companies are ready to tighten the belt. We would definitely not mind conducting awareness workshops on HIV/AIDS, said C. Banerjee, human resource manager of Last Peak Solutions, a BPO in Sector V.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fare hike ruled out, lobby glare on cess

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The government on Tuesday ruled out the possibility of raising the fares of buses, minibuses and taxis, following the fuel price hike.

 ?Though the price of petrol and diesel has increased, we will not hike the fares of passenger vehicles,?? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.

 The Left Front, too, ruled out any fare hike. Front chairman Biman Bose said at Alimuddin Street: ?I have spoken to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, and the government has no plan to hike fares.??

 Although transport operators are not in favour of a fare hike, they demanded withdrawal of cess and reduction of sales tax levied by the state government. 

 Bengal Bus Syndicate on Tuesday held a meeting with bus and minibus operators and decided to pressure the government to withdraw cess on petrol and diesel, and reduce sales tax. The government levies a cess of Re 1 per litre of petrol and diesel and charges 17 per cent as sales tax.

 ?We are not demanding a fare hike. Then, people will stop taking buses. If the government withdraws the cess and cuts sales tax, our loss will be compensated,? said Swarnakamal Saha, president, Bengal Bus Syndicate.

 The Left Front will organise a rally on Wednesday to protest the fuel price hike. The city centre is likely to come to a halt after 5.30 pm.

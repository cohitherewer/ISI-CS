The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Motor shop to swank mall

 - Xmas 2007 retail rendezvous to rub shoulders with Forum 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 The magic mart gets bigger and more enchanting by the day, as Calcutta continues to embrace organised retail in its myriad modern avatars, and mall-eria keeps spreading its tentacles.

 Set to come up bang opposite Forum, the city?s original tryst with international-standard formatted shopping, a new ?high-end mall focusing on super-premium brands? hopes to add sheen to the retail rendezvous that the Elgin Road corridor is fast becoming.

 The Belani Group promises to deliver its 85,000-sq-ft swank shop stop, to be housed in the 50-cottah shell that used to be the repair workshop of the French Motor Company, as a ?Christmas gift to Calcutta? next year. The prime piece of property, opening on to both Woodburn Road and Lee Road, changed hands early this year in a big-ticket deal.

 ?We are planning a very exclusive mall, to be constructed in a G+4 format, with the ground floor dedicated to high-profile international lifestyle brands,? Nandu Belani, managing director of the group, tells Metro. The realtor firm is a key player in super-luxury housing in the city.

 While the first floor will house mainly men?s brands, the second floor is likely to be dedicated to women?s wear and accessories. The anchor, to be housed on one side of the ground and first levels, is yet to be tied up. The third floor will hold the food court and a fine-dining restaurant, while ?talks are on with INOX for a two-screen multiplex? on the top level.

 ?The biggest USP of the property is the 300-ft frontage, which is unmatched in the city and allows us to play around with the elevation. The location is another clincher, since the area already has a thriving retail culture, thanks to Forum and other high-street outlets,? says Belani, who feels his mall will ?complement? the Forum format.

 Abhijit Das, city head of international property consultants Trammell Crow Meghraj (earlier Chesterton Meghraj), which was responsible for bringing a clutch of big brands to both Forum and City Centre, agrees.

 ?Forum was the catalyst that changed the profile of Elgin Road from a residential neighbourhood to a retail-centric area. The Belani mall will complement Forum and compete with it, adding to the basket of options for the consumer,? Das says.

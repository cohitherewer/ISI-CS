The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Ferry to township by April

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The ferry service from Lock Gate to Baisakhi, which will be inaugurated by the chief minister on Friday, will be extended to New Town within six months.

 Six launches and two water taxis will initially ply on the 8.5-km route from September 23, announced Hidco chairman and housing minister Goutam Deb on Monday.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said the ferry services would be available from 7 am to 5 pm. The tickets will be priced at Rs 4 and Rs 5.

 We provided Rs 21 crore to the irrigation department for de-silting the canal from Lock Gate to Baisakhi. We will provide another Rs 20 crore to de-silt the canal up to New Town and further south. Work will start in January next year. The ferry service will remain suspended during the dredging. We expect to extend the services to New Town by April next year, stated Hidco chief Deb.

 According to the minister, Hidco will provide Rs 24 crore to de-silt the two-km stretch of Bagjola canal from Dum Dum Road to East Sinthee. 

 A road will also be built on the bank of the canal to improve connectivity between Dum Dum and BT Road.

 Apart from this, Deb added, the transport department will build a jetty at Lock Gate from where ferry services will be introduced on the Hooghly to Howrah and Belur.

 The date for inauguration of the ferry services was finalised after Deb, along with senior officials, conducted a successful trial run on the Lock Gate-Baisakhi route on Thursday.

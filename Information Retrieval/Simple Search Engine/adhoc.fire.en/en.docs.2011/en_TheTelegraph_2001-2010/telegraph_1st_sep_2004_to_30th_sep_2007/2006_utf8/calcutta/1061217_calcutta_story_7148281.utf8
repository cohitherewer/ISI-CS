 The mummy returns

 She came in an hour-and-a-half late, looking radiant in a Manish Malhotra tunic and a pair of dark blue denims. But unlike most other celebs who pass through town, Karisma Kapoor chose not to ignore the timings gone topsy-turvy. I apologise for the delay. My flight was an hour late, smiled the blue-eyed beauty, charming as ever. 

 In Calcutta (after a gap of four years) to open her innings as brand ambassador for Khaitan Electricals Limited for three years, Karisma recalled the many good times she had spent in the city. It is an emotional moment to be here today. Khaitan Electricals and me, both stand for hard work, determination and strong values, and hence the association, she smiled.

 Karisma still looks exactly the same (Thats a good thing na?). The same shining tresses and same peaches-and-cream complexion, accentuated with just a hint of eyeliner, blush and a dash of gloss, motherhood sits pretty on her petite frame. Just be a hands-down mother. Run behind your baby, that is the trick.

 Little Samaira really keeps her more than busy, with no spare time to miss the spotlight. But now with her growing up, mom is ready for a comeback. Karisma is reading five or six scripts and she promises we will hear of a film soon. The one problem she has is with the word comeback. A nurse or a secretary also goes on maternity leave. Why cant an actress take one? Lets just say that I was on maternity leave and I am coming back to my job, she signed off. 

 Till then, Karisma fans must make do with one-off appearances on the ramp or polo grounds.

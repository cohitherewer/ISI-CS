 Theres one more addition to the lengthening list of lifestyle destinations on the EM Bypass. A fashion and food hub from the house of retail major Pantaloon Retail India Limited threw open its doors to Calcuttans on Saturday.

 Fashion Station and Food Bazaar, the twin offering from Pantaloon, is situated on the EM Bypass, opposite the Salt Lake stadium.

 A demographic study showed that this area has good marketing prospects. With new housing complexes coming up nearby and the booming IT and BPO sector in Salt Lake, this is just the time to enter this area. We are also targeting Salt Lake residents, said Rajan Malhotra, head, value retail, Pantaloon Retail India Limited.

 The sprawling two-storeyed store spread over 27,000 sq ft houses Food Bazaar on the ground floor and Fashion Station on the first.

 Both stores provide great value to customers. One in terms of garments at pocket-friendly prices and the other through wholesale food prices. The focus is on the youth brigade, explained Rajan.

 This is like a neighbourhood store, a one-stop shop providing you with all your daily needs including fashion, he added.

 The plush air-conditioned interiors, the mall-like ambience and the sheer variety of offerings, however, make it much more than a neighbourhood store.

 The fifth Fashion Station outlet in the country, this boasts extensive sections for men, women and kids.

 For women, the Style Platform and Youth Xpress sections offer a mix of sporty casuals, smart formals and pretty party attire from labels like Honey, Shyla, Annabelle and more.

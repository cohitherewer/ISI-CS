 Pact for tech town boost 

 JAYANTA BASU 

 The state government is on the lookout for companies to build urban infrastructure, like drinking water supply and waste water treatment. Sector V, the tech hub of the state, is where the model will be tried out first.

 We have invited expression of interest to build infrastructure such as water supply and drainage facilities in Sector V. Six to seven companies have responded, said P.K. Pradhan, principal secretary (urban development and municipal affairs) of the state government. The government was criticised recently for failure to prevent waterlogging in the township.

 The principal secretary added that the tech town agreement is expected to be inked in a couple of months. The project will then be taken up at other urban centres in the state.

 Pradhan made the announcement at a recent seminar, organised by USAID India, in collaboration with Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), South Asia, and National Institute of Urban Affairs, on issues related to drinking water supply and waste water treatment in urban areas.

 Experts and officials from the eastern Indian states attended the seminar. It was the second in the series of four planned across the country.

 Mission director of USAID India George Deikun promised to work in partnership with state government and emphasised the importance of better financial management to sustain infrastructure.

 The participants stressed the importance of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission in funding major infrastructure related projects and catalysing reforms. 

 A number of water supply and waste water management projects have been cleared in greater Calcutta under the scheme.

 Catherine Revels of WSP pointed out that funds do not always bring about improvement in service delivery. She stated that reliability in water supply expressed in terms of average hours of supply per day has gone down in the past two decades despite huge investment in the sector.

 Vital links to ring route

 - Two roads-cum-flyovers to connect eastern fringe with airport, highways

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Two roads-cum-flyovers are being planned to link Basanti Road, on the eastern fringes of the city, with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass on the one hand and the airport, via New Town Road, on the other.

 Work is likely to kick off in February next year and end in March 2008.

 Once ready, the roads will serve as crucial links in a huge cyclical route, encompassing Chowbhaga Bazar, the Bantala Leather Complex, airport, Belghoria Expressway, Second Vivekananda Bridge, National Highway 2, National Highway 6, Kona Expressway, AJC Bose Road flyover, Bridge no. 4 (Park Circus), EM Bypass and Basanti Road/Garia (see graphic).

 The four-km link between Basanti Road and the Bypass, which will include a km-long flyover, will be laid by Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 

 The flyover will come up replacing a wooden bridge on a canal. The road will meet the Bypass near Ruby General Hospital. The Rs 30-crore project will be funded by the Centre under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. 

 The other road-cum-flyover, to be built by the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), will run six km and open a direct route from the Calcutta Leather Complex, in Bantala, to the airport (via New Town Road), bypassing the Bypass and VIP Road. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 25 crore.

 Work on the detailed project reports for both the schemes is in progress. 

 While civic engineers said the Bypass-Basanti Road link will take six months to complete, Hidco engineers are hopeful of readying the thoroughfare between the leather complex and New Town Road in about a year.

 The CMC and Hidco authorities both think the two roads will turn several thousands of acres in the Bantala, Chowbhaga, Nonadanga, Madurdaha and Boinchtala areas as the new realty hub of the city.

 The vast stretch on the eastern city fringe, bordering the East Calcutta Wetlands, will be the new address of Calcuttas residential estates. Keeping this in mind, we intend building the link road at the earliest, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.

 It is for the first time that the civic authorities have embarked on the geographical value-addition service, added commissioner Bandyopadhyay. 

 Hidco managing director R.K. Tripathy said: Our aim is to build a road network for the upcoming townships on the eastern fringe and to reduce the traffic load on the Bypass and VIP Road. The proposed six-km link artery will enable motorists of those areas to reach the airport skirting the congestion on the Bypass and VIP Road.

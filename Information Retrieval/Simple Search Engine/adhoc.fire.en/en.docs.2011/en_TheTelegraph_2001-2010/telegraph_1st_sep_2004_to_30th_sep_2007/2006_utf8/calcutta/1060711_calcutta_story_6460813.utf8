 Aseminar on Child Domestic Workers was organised recently by Save the Children, UK, and Project Partners at Max Mueller Bhavan.

 Pointing out the high prevalence of child domestic labour in the city, the speakers said that many rackets were active in trafficking adolescent children in West Bengal. South 24-Parganas is the hot spot for the illegal operations. Children are being bootlegged to north Indian states from areas like West Midnapore, Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar.

 Prof Jasodhara Bagchi, chairperson of West Bengal Commission for Women, pointed out in her address that merely rescuing the child labourer from his or her employer is not a solution. Rehabilitation is of utmost importance. Usually, reuniting the child with his/her family has a negative impact because of poverty.

 Seventy per cent of the child domestic worker respondents to a survey admitted to having been physically abused. What makes it even more difficult to protect child domestic workers is that civil society and authorities do not recognise them as ?workers?, although there is a law which affirms that government employees cannot keep child domestic helps.

 ?We are trying hard to eradicate this practice but we need strong support from all strata of society,? said Srinivas Vardhan, national policy manager, Save the Children, UK.

 Fest fiesta

 Perception 2006, a two-day inter-school fest of Apeejay School held in June turned out to be a fun-filled extravaganza for all.

 On Day One, we had off-stage events like photography, script-writing, treasure hunt, tug-of-war, computer gaming and an innovative game called Best of Waste. Apeejay bagged the prizes in photography, treasure hunt, debate and tug-of-war. Prizes were bagged for script-writing by Lakshmipat Singhania, for computer gaming by South Point and for Best of Waste by Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan.

 The on-stage events were held on the second day at Vidya Mandir. This year our school fest?s theme was ?Kai-zen?, which means ?stretch yourself a little more?.

 The quiz was the opening event and was conducted by theatre personality Parnab Mukherjee. South Point won the first prize, while Apeejay came third. The second event was a medley in which South Point stood first. Up next was Divine Chords, which saw performances by the school bands. Apeejay rocked the crowd with numbers like Adat by Jal.

 Then came the most awaited Twist Blazers, the inter-school dance competition. St Thomas was the show-stealer .

 A splendid performance of old hit numbers by music band Cod and a fashion show of ethnic wear wrapped up the fiesta.

 Calcutta-based animation studio Metaphor Studios has been awarded the Seagate Award for Excellence in Digital Technology for its first indigenous film Sand Castle. 

 The Seagate excellence awards were instituted in India, in 2001, to recognise and reward the emerging excellence in digital technology in the film and video industry. This is the only film and video industry recognition of its kind in India , says Sharad Shrivastava, country manager, Seagate India. 

 The animation film Sand Castle starts with an eight-year-old girl making a sand castle on a warm beach of Goa. Her alcoholic uncle sits near her. A middle-aged man comes to the uncle, gives him money and takes the girl away.

 This is a film about paedophiles on the beaches of Goa. Metaphor Studios was commissioned by the non-governmental organisation, Save the Children of India to create this 60-second film. The idea was to screen this film in all domestic flights to Goa. 

 According to Ranjini Mukherjee, head of Metaphor Studios: The Seagate award was unexpected but a very pleasant surprise. We are jubilant and hopeful that we can do more exciting projects in future which will add value to society. At Metaphor, we aim to bridge the gap between global animation demand and honed Indian talent. 

 As one of the Metaphors first efforts of production with the talented team from The Academy of Animation Arts and Technology (AAAT), this award has come as a great motivation and morale booster. 

 The film Sand Castle was screened at the Calcutta Film Festival on November 12 at Jibanananda Sabhagar.

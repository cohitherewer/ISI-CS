The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 First-timer?s fret fatigue

 PATRICK PRINGLE took a day?s break from his stint with The Telegraph to star as a guitar player in the background of a Tollywood film sequence

 Rituparna Sengupta, Rahul Bose and Raima Sen on the sets of Anuranon

 At the best of times, one might describe me as somewhat unphotogenic. Which is why I initially hesitated when a friend asked whether I would like to be an extra in the forthcoming Bengali film Anuranon, the debut film of ad maker Aniruddha Roy Chowdury, starring Rahul Bose, Rajat Kapoor, Rituparna Sengupta and Raima Sen.

 Not since the days of amateur ? and occasionally disastrous ? school plays have I ever been involved in any dramatic capacity. Assurance that I would be ?drinking beer and chatting in a bar scene? convinced me that this might be an enjoyable insight into the Indian film industry.

 I arrived at Virgose Bar of Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI), which was a maelstrom of actors, assistants, technicians of every imaginable type, and, of course, the extras.

 Within half an hour of arriving at the shooting site, it soon became apparent that some of the extras would have to pretend to play instruments in the band, which was playing in the bar during the 45-second scene. Goodbye, sitting and chatting at the bar. Hello, guitar and miming.

 The main player in our band was the noted tabla player Tanmoy Bose, who thankfully caught the vast majority of the camera action. Bose was also the only member of the band actually capable of competently playing his instrument. The rest of the band consisted of two English journalists, one English designer and a Nigerian footballer, with an almost negligible collective experience of their musical instruments.

 Except for Ruth, that is, an English designer who mastered the shaker with some aplomb. I had played in a dreadful ?whinge-core? band at school, and luckily could just about mimic what the guitar part was, which saved me from looking totally foolish in the close-ups.

 One aspect of film-making that one can forget about when watching the slick, finished product is just how laborious and convoluted the shortest of sequences can be to shoot. Every angle must be covered, with precise continuity being obligatory. Everything from positions of characters to the quantity of dry ice enveloping the band, must be exactly as it was in the previous shot. The lighting must be the same for each shot, with the rails for the camera being moved to accommodate every pan of the camera. The shooting for the 45-second sequence took from 11 am to 6 pm!

 The mood of actors and technicians was also striking. I expected lots of shouting and star tantrums, but there was a very calm demeanour in both the cast and crew. The actors never lost their patience, and were capable of producing the same level of performance take after take.

 The gruelling schedule will take the cast and crew to London in the forthcoming weeks, and Anuranon is expected to be finished by the end of March. 

 Stamina is a virtue that sadly one could not attribute to the guitarist lurking in the background, who shuffled about awkwardly nursing his fingers, which were smarting from so much unexpected fret action.

 For the uninitiated such as myself, the day was a fascinating insight into the world of film-making, and it of course prompted mass hysteria from my English friends when they found out that the most camera shy of people had ended up in a Bengali film.

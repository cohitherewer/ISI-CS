 Overhaul of meals in civic schools 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Realising that the best way to empower children is to provide them with nutrition and education, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is drawing up plans to overhaul the mid-day meal scheme in its 242 schools. 

 The model that has caught the civic body?s fancy to counter classroom hunger is the one championed by two non-profit organisations ? Bangalore-based Akshay Patra and Hyderabad-headquartered Naandi Foundation. 

 ?We have had exploratory meetings with representatives from both the NGOs. We even visited Bangalore and Hyderabad to understand their models. As a follow-up, they came down to Calcutta and made presentations to the mayor, mayor-in councils and also to the borough committee chairpersons,? said CMC commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 At present, the mid-day meal is cooked at standalone kitchens in the CMC-run schools, where the total enrolment is over 35,000. The government provides Rs 2 each for students, along with rice and cereals. 

 With economists like Amartya Sen endorsing the success of mid-day meals in controlling dropout numbers from schools, the government is trying to make it more effective. 

 Not just the CMC schools, even the state-run schools will also be brought within the fold of the new mid-day meal programme. According to Bandyopadhyay, a decision on the issue will be taken ?shortly? after evaluating the individual models and their strengths. The British government?s department for international development (DFID) will support the project in Calcutta. 

 ?We run all our programmes on public-private partnership principles, where government chips in with some initial funding and corporates chip in with the rest. And the entire process is transparent and KPMG, a consultant and audit major, audits the system,? said Abhay Jain, representing Akshay Patra. 

 The Bangalore-based NGO, which is backed by Infosys Foundation, runs in 10 cities and covers around 365,000 students. Naandi Foundation, with support from corporates like Dr Reddy?s Laboratory and Satyam, also uses a similar system to reach out over four lakh students in eight cities. 

 Both the NGOs run their programmes from centralised kitchens, where the mid-day meal is cooked and then distributed. The menu and the model vary from regions to suit the local conditions. 

 ?Economies of scale operate in centralised kitchens and its very much in vogue these days. Besides, it is also easier to maintain hygiene and other standards,? added Bandyopadhyay.

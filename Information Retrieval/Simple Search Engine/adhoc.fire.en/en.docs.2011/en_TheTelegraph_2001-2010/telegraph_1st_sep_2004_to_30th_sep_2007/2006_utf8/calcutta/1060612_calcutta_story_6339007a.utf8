 Heaping love on kids and being 

 their role model is what makes good parents, according to 

 Ragini Rao, who conducted the Parenting with Love 

 workshop at Crossword bookstore last week. The two-day interactive 

 session, targeted at guardians of two to 12-year-olds, attracted 

 a handful of young mothers eager for insights on how best 

 to handle their cherubs and build their personalities.

 A behavioural counsellor and certified transactional analyst 

 (psychotherapy), Ragini Rao has conducted several such workshops 

 at Bangalore, her home for over nine years. Now a counsellor 

 at the Apollo clinic in Calcutta and a volunteer at Mentaid, 

 she wants to share her experience with parents in the city.

 These are difficult times; there is too much competition 

 and too many distractions for children. Parents need special 

 skills and they need to seriously reflect on what they are 

 passing on to the next generation. Even two and three-year-olds 

 can now talk confidently on any subject. On the flip side, 

 there is a lot of aggressiveness, insensitivity and lack 

 of discipline. These must be checked on time, Rao 

 told Metro.

 And till what age is it possible to make behavioural changes? 

 It is never too late, one can admit ones faults, 

 make changes and move on even at 40, she asserted.

 Calcutta, the counsellor felt, is lucky to still have joint 

 families, unlike Bangalore, but then the family bond 

 is still strong all over India, so even where people dont 

 stay together they come together during a crisis.

 Through charts, group exercises and discussions, Rao acquainted 

 the mothers with the nurture and structure aspects 

 of parenting nurture being mental stimulation, recognition 

 and unconditional affection, while structure is the set 

 of rules for children.

 It is okay for you to tie the shoelaces of a two or 

 three-year-old but for a four or five-year-old, you should 

 ask if they need any help, advised Rao. While abuse 

 or rigidity can demean or suffocate a child, he or she might 

 be confused if the parents set absolutely no rules, said 

 the expert.

 Rao suggested ways to address behavioural problems of children 

 narrated by participants, from throwing tantrums to refusing 

 to share toys with friends. The sessions continued beyond 

 the time limit and quite a few visitors to the store showed 

 an interest.

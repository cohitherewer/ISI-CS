The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I want to be the Big W?

 Call it bad timing or bad luck but the Bad Boy isn?t amused with the bird flu. ?I came all the way to India but no one will serve me chicken tikka masala,? Will Smith grumbled to Metro from Mumbai. The Hollywood superstar is on a seven-day tour to the country to (among other things) launch Sony Entertainment Television?s new English film channel, PIX.

 ?I wanted to taste authentic chicken tikka masala but all they would bring me are shrimps. Come on, it?s not the same thing,? says the star of such blockbusters as Men In Black and Independence Day.

 But that hasn?t stopped Smith from dubbing his first India trip as ?just magical?.

 ?I flew into Delhi last weekend, drove up to Agra, saw the Taj Mahal and then came here to Mumbai,? reveals Smith, who has come down to India with a large entourage including friends (I, Robot producer James Lassiter and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air co-star Alfonso Robeiro) and family (son, cousin, brother-in-law and nephew).

 But it?s not just play ? Smith partied till late on Wednesday night with Fardeen Khan and Abhishek Bachchan ? as he?s lining up some desi work too. 

 ?I want to make a film here and I am trying to find the perfect marriage with a three-act structure between Indian movies and Hollywood,? says Smith, who spent a greater part of Wednesday meeting Bollywood producers and directors like Karan Johar, Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Manmohan Shetty. ?I believe there is a beautiful connection between the two film industries.?

 If there?s one Indian with whom Smith wants to set up that beautiful connection it is Aishwarya Rai. ?If she?s willing to do a film with me, I will, pretty much, do anything with her,? laughs the Hitch man with two more Hollywood films ? Tonight, He Comes and Pursuit of Happiness ? in his kitty.

 But before that he wants to take home a piece of the Big B. ?Just before coming here, I watched Sarkar, the first Indian film I ever saw, and Amitabh Bachchan is so powerful, I would like to be known as the Big W,? laughs Smith. ?I haven?t met him yet because he wasn?t feeling that well the other day but I hope to meet him during the weekend.?

 Once back in Hollywood, Smith is slated to give away one of the Oscar trophies at the Kodak Theatre on the big March 5 night. But he himself isn?t that desperate to lay his hands on the golden statuette after missing out a couple of years back for his portrayal of boxing legend Muhammad Ali in the biopic Ali. ?What?s more important to me is how people react when I come down the streets. I am not really a big awards fan,? states the star.

 What Smith is a fan of, though, is music. ?Although acting comes first and it is my big commitment in life but music is much closer to my heart,? says the hip-hop star who has not only rapped in many of his movies but also cut private albums at regular intervals. ?What I sing is what I feel whereas I am just a tool in the hands of my directors when it comes to acting.?

 Now, Smith wants to bring his wife, actress Jada Pinkett Smith, to India. ?Whenever she is ready, I will come back with her and show everything that I?ve seen,? signs off the man, sounding straight out of one of his movies.

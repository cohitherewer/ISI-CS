The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clean chit hits hero

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

Braveheart Anil Minda had earned a pat from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in October 2004 for having helped his police force snare a gang of three dacoits.

 Minda, a trader in motor spares residing in Phoolbagan, had resisted the gang of goons on October 31, 2002, and even pinned one down.

 Last weekend, all three of Minda?s assailants walked free, with police having failed to prove charges against the history-sheeters in court.

 ?How is that possible? They had all been caught red-handed? And no one even informed me about their acquittal,? Minda told Metro on Thursday, when informed of the judgment.

 Public prosecutor Swapan Chakraborty said Alipore fast-track first court judge Partha Pratim Das had observed in his judgment on April 29: ?I do not believe that an unarmed man (Minda) could get the better of a criminal with a loaded revolver.? The judge then acquitted the accused trio for lack of proper evidence.

 The news of the clean chit to his assailants left Minda understandably rattled, in his Prinsep Street shop. ?I am upset with the outcome of the case? They could be a threat to my family now,? he admitted.

 Minda was returning home from work in October 2002 when a taxi intercepted his car on CIT Road. Three men stepped out and demanded his bag. When Minda resisted, two of them held him at gunpoint and the third snatched the bag and ran towards the taxi.

 ?In a desperate attempt to fight back, Minda flung open the door of his car and hit one of them, Gulzar, and then pinned him to the ground. The two others, Nana and Sikander, fled but were picked up on November 6,? recalled an officer of the detective department?s anti-dacoity wing.

 Recounting the impact the recognition of his act had on him, the man in his late 30s said on Thursday: ?When I had received the bravery award from the chief minister, I was really charged up. I had decided that the next time I got a chance, I would again risk my life to rid society of criminals.?

 But the surprise acquittal has changed things. ?I do not feel at ease any more. I have to think a second time before I fight back under similar circumstances. I have a family, and their security could be under threat,? he said.

 His family, too, voiced fear of a backlash. ?What if they return to hound us? They know our house and I am sure they will not have a problem getting a gun,? said Minda?s teenaged nephew Abhishek. 

 Public prosecutor Swapan Chakraborty said he was surprised by the court order but was already preparing to challenge it in the high court.

 ?Once I get a copy of the judgment, I will find out whether the police had really failed to produce enough evidence,? observed deputy commissioner, detective department, Gyanwant Singh.

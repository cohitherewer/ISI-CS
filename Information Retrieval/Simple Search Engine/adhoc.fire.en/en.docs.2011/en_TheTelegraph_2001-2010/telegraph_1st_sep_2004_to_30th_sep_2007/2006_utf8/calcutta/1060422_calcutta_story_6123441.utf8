Life

 Supremos in 

 snip amp; streak

 They are the ones who set tress trends 

 in town. GoodLife picks the famous four mane managers

 June 

 Tomkyns 

 Age: 58

 Find her at: June Tomkyns 

 at 26/2, Ballygunge Circular Road

 At it since: 1981

 Starting point: I 

 had a serious flair for turning ordinary things into extraordinary, 

 being inclined towards beauty from a very young age. Beauty 

 always attracted me, be it wall hangings or the Japanese 

 art Ikebana.

 Credentials: Trained with 

 Toni amp; Guy in England, Vidal Sasson, Saks Academy and 

 with other international visiting hairstylists from New 

 Zealand and Australia.

 Signature style: Specialises 

 in freestyles, mostly wash-and-go haircuts that promise 

 easy maintenance and colouring techniques that complement 

 the cut. I always believe that a good hair cut doesnt 

 really need a blow dry.

 Big break: There 

 has been no one big break as such? life is a series of turning 

 points and huge moments. 

 Celeb clients: Actresses 

 Rituparna Sengupta, Koena Mitra, Raima and Riya Sen and 

 all the models of the city.

 Marvellous mane: Dimple 

 Kapadia.

 Would love to snip: Aishwarya 

 Rai. I would love to give her layers cut deep into 

 the hair, one large section falling into another that accentuates 

 her beautiful eyes and lips. 

 Likes her hair to be done by: 

 Daughter Priscilla Corner. 

 Bridgette 

 Jones 

 Age: 41 

 Find her at: Bridgette 

 Jones at 78B, Sarat Bose Road, near Maddox Square 

 At it since: 1997 

 Starting point: I 

 always had this creative streak and my mother-in-law June 

 Tomkyns gave me the opportunity to discover it. After that 

 there was no looking back.

 Credentials: Trained at 

 James Albert School of Cosmetology in California.

 Signature style: I 

 love bringing out the movement of the hair and then finishing 

 the style by adding attitude in the form of lots of colour. 

 Big break: Getting to pen 

 the weekly beauty column for Graphiti, the Sunday 

 magazine that comes with The Telegraph.

 Celeb clients: Actresses 

 Moon Moon Sen, Lara Dutta and Koneenica Banerjee, and theatre 

 personality Lillete Dubey. 

 Marvellous mane: Jennifer 

 Aniston and Priyanka Chopra. 

 Would love to snip: Jennifer 

 Lopez. She is so glamorous, I would love to give her 

 a short crop, a wispy layered cut close to the scalp.

 Would like her hair to be done 

 by: Toni Mascot from Toni amp; Guy, in London.

 Raman 

 Bharadwaj 

 Age: 33

 Find him at: AN John at 

 12H, Park Street, and City Centre

 At it since: 1999

 Starting point: AN 

 John was set up by my grandfather. Initially, I only studied 

 the technical aspects to get an insight into running the 

 salon. Its only when I finished my technical training 

 did I realise that my true calling lay in styling.

 Credentials: Trained with 

 Toni amp; Guy and Saks Academy and got hands-on experience 

 with leading international experts like Charles Worthington 

 and Trevor Sorbie. 

 Big break: Turning his 

 family salon into a chic, young and contemporary brand, 

 and successfully.

 Signature style: Specialises 

 in twin makeovers by using cut and colour put together. 

 Celeb clients: Cricketer 

 Sourav Ganguly and actress Celina Jaitely. 

 Marvellous mane: Tom Cruise.

 Would love to snip: Madonna. 

 I have been tracking her style since I can remember, 

 loving every look she sports. But given a chance I would 

 give her a short, chic look with some red on her head. 

 Likes his hair to be done by: 

 A hairstylist called Adid who works in his salon AN John, 

 Park Street.

 Sabina 

 Yah 

 Age: 41

 Find her at: Sunflower, 

 2, Russell Street

 At it since: 1990

 Starting point: Taught 

 in a school for years but her inherent interest in hairstyling 

 made her turn to mother-in-law Patsys salon Sunflower 

 for a full-fledged career. 

 Credentials: 

 Trained extensively at Toni amp; Guy, Saks Academy and 

 Vidal Sasson. Also done workshops under international experts 

 like Guy Kremer, Charles Worthington and Trevor Sorbie. 

 I update my skills each year, in either London or 

 Paris.

 Signature style: Loves 

 giving bob cuts with textured, classy, layered and uneven 

 ends. Using off-beat colours is also my forte where 

 I use minking technique.

 Big break: Winning the 

 LOreal Colour Trophy in 2000.

 Celeb clients: Models Nina 

 Manuel and Joey Mathew, VJ Ramona, actor Shayan Munshi, 

 hotelier Priya Paul, designer Anamika Khanna, director Mira 

 Nair and actresses Raveena Tandon and Swastika Mukherjee. 

 Marvellous mane: Jennifer 

 Aniston. 

 Would love to snip: Eva 

 Longoria, by keeping her length but adding flirty, choppy 

 texture to give it an extra dimension.

 This will render an out-of-the-bed 

 look. I would also give her bright copper undertones to 

 flash off the texture while bringing about a vibrant look.

 Likes her hair to be done by: 

 Herself. But yes, I could also trust any of the 

 girls at my salon.

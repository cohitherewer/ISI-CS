 Presented by 17-year-old Anagha Bharat, this evening?s Bharata Natyam recital is all set to be performed in true, vintage Tanjore style. Geometric lines and an imaginative use of the various adavus without sacrificing its classicism are only a couple of the most noteworthy characteristics of this unique performance approach, besides the traditional richness of its style. Emphasizing mastery of tempo, precision of technique, subtle expression along with dexterity in execution, it promises to be a classic connoisseur?s delight. Featuring nine individual pieces based on Alarippu Misram, Varnam, Bho Shambo, Rabindrasangeet, Thillana, Mangalam and others, it offers an exposition of a variety of moods, measures and motions. Accompanied by Sudha Bharat (nattuvangam), J. Ramesh, Sharmila Kothari (vocal), G. Suryanarayanan (mridangam) and V. Sriramachandra Murthy (violin).

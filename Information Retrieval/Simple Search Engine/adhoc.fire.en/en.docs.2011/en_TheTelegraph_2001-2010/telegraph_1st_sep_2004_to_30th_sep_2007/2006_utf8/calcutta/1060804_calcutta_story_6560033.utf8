The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 How the club was won 

Surprise element in club poll

 - Challenger stages upset by slender margin

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta Club: Poll upheaval. A Telegraph picture

 The fiercely-fought elections at the Cricket Association of Bengal drew all the limelight last week, but the battle for presidency was no less intense at Calcutta Club, which celebrates its centenary next year. 

 Uro surgeon Dipak Mukherjee threw his hat into the ring, challenged president-elect Debidas Ganguly and went on to win the contest with a slender margin of 16 votes. The results were announced three days after the polling, held last Friday. 

 Now, various theories on how Mukherjee staged an upset are doing the rounds at this elite club. 

 Mukherjee played his cards well He convinced a section of club members that if they vote in his favour, he would ensure better representation for that section in the executive committee, said a member. Referring to the behind-the-scenes game that ensured Mukherjee the magic number, he added this section had control over a chunk of members, who voted in favour of the doctor.

 Known for its tradition, the unwritten norm at Calcutta Club is that the senior-most member of the committee becomes president. So, it was the turn of Debidas Ganguly, uncle of ousted Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly. But Mukherjee challenged Ganguly and what followed was a fierce, two- month-long campaign.

 Normally, around 1,600 to 1,800 members cast their votes in the election. But this time, the turnout was around 3,000. The number points out the extent to which the candidates mobilised support to win the elections, said another member, requesting anonymity. 

 The surprise element in the poll did not end with high voter turnout and victory for the wild card entrant. Electioneering was different this year. 

 Tata Consultancy Services was roped in to conduct the elections in a transparent manner. During the process of counting, the signatures of all the voters were scrutinised by the consultancy majors representatives, which resulted in a delayed announcement of the election results.

 I cant understand why people are talking so much about the elections. Its a democratic process. But given the heightened interest this year, extra precautions were adopted. The winner simply had a more effective campaign and was more accepted by a majority of the members, said a past president of the club, stressing there was nothing unnatural in the election process. 

 But for some old-timers, the bitterness that marked polling this year has been disheartening. We know things have changed and tradition is not that important anymore. But I think the elections could have been conducted in a better atmosphere, summed up a Calcutta Club regular for the past 20 years.

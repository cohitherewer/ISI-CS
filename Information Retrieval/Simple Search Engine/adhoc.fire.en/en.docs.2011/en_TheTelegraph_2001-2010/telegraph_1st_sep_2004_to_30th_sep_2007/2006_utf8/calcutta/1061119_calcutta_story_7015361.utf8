The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of values and valuables

 The Gray-Williams black Italian marble flooring polished to a fault for that prime sheen. The curved false ceiling supported from the roof with wooden truss below. The inclined frosted-glass panel with an opaque, decorated central strip, the heavily upholstered, pure Italian-leather business lounge settees set off against more flexible upright seating formats, a laid-back, colonial-style verandah with regal awnings, and of course, the memorabilia and artefacts

 The Telegraph Hall of Fame, in the first-floor foyer of the Calcutta Club a corridor that used to host men-only parties till the 1950s is a magic fusion of old-world grandeur and charm that characterise the institution on the cusp of its centenary year, and of bold, contemporary vision that looks to take fresh guard beyond the venerable century.

 The concept, born during Probir Roys term as president in 2003 and flagged off during Dilip Boses tenure after him, was about telling untold stories of those personalities who have distinguished themselves not just in their chosen fields, but on the broader canvas of Bengal. For starters, there is the bust of Sir RN Mukherjee, founder-secretary, finding pride of place on one side of the imposing hall. Then, there are oil paintings of the first president, the Maharajah of Cooch Behar, first patron Lord Minto, eminent politician of those days T.C. Goswami, Sir Josna Ghosal and Sir Herbert Holmwood, president during 1908-09.

 If Calcutta Club as an institution stands for values, these are the valuables, explains Kalyan Chowdhury, chairman, centenary projects and house-building and maintenance. The club and The Telegraph are in the process of collecting rare and relevant stuff that would adorn the four special panels on the walls of the Hall of Fame.

 The entire place was dark and gloomy and unkempt, used only occasionally as a TV room or when a spillover crowd trickled upstairs for a chat. The challenge was to create something dignified yet lively, with a blend of the old and the new, smiles architect Dulal Mukherjee who did the design solution.

 The gothic pillars at the entrance and near it were highlighted by giving the base of each an elevated marble deck. We used the inclined glass front, while fitting the AC units on the ceiling on a wooden base. The water ducts were carried outside and concealed by wooden truss brackets with tensile steel-string embellishments, Mukherjee adds.

 The walls on either side have a 4-ft protective wooden panelling, while one corner of the archival lounge will house a digital information kiosk with facts and anecdotes on eminent personalities on CD-ROM. The fireplace has also been restored and highlighted. In those days, one had the luxury of letting space remain idle and the area was largely unutilised, till we hit upon the idea of the Hall of Fame. This is a place which can inspire us to rediscover ourselves, observes Chowdhury.

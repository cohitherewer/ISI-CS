 ean, narrow, slim structures, pristine whites with a citrus punch, liberal doses of linens and natural fabrics... elements that combine to shape the spring-summer 06 line of Bangalore-based designer Manoviraj Khosla.

 The mens wear collection that premiered in Bangalore last week was launched along with Calcutta-based designer Jyoti Khaitans summer line at her plush boutique dstudio at 5, Loudon Street on Tuesday afternoon.

 Its a semi-formal collection catering to men from 18 to 80. The outfits can be worn any time of the day ? they can double as day wear and evening wear, says Manoviraj, in town for the launch of the summery cool line.

 Still basking in the rave reviews for his much-talked-about Kingfisher Airlines uniform that has redefined cabin crew dressing in India, the designer is now busy giving finishing touches to his India Fashion Week collection (IFW).

 While he was missing in action at the Fashion Week last year, Manoviraj promises to be back with a bang on the Delhi ramp this April.

 I couldnt do India Fashion Week last year because I had my hands full with the Kingfisher uniform. But I will be back this year to showcase my autumn-winter 2006-07 collection, he says.

 The focus of his IFW line will be on the range of fabrics, reveals the designer.

 Synthetic suede, leather, silk and linen mixed with wool will shape the strictly western cuts while flaunting the ethnic flavour with touches of embroidery.

 For the veteran designer, the decision to showcase in IFW, the official fashion week, was natural and he is sceptical about the future of the Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai.

 Two fashion weeks in India are quite unnecessary. And I am not really sure how long Lakme will be able to sustain its fashion week, he clarifies.

 Manoviraj is confident that Lakme Fashion Week will not command the same respect as IFW. In the US, there are so many fashion weeks happening, like the Los Angeles Fashion Week and Miami Fashion Week, but none of them commands the same prestige as New York Fashion Week. I think the situation will be the same here as well, he explains.

 The man known best for lending his creativity to uniforms for corporate houses, hotels, bars and restaurants, has his plate full right now with a host of such projects. While he is fine-tuning the entire look for a soon-to-be-launched cigarette brand, hes also stitching together the uniform for a fast food chain that will have outlets across the country.

 I have created the entire look for this new brand of cigarettes. From the dress code of the vendors to the look of the promos, Ive designed the whole package, he smiles.

Bolly?s British Badshah

Screen On amp; Off

 Cut to cut: Akshay Kumar with Saif Ali Khan and 

Abhishek Bachchan

 He may not be considered in the top bracket of stars and may not be as popular as the Khans or the Bachchans, but there?s no denying the fact that the box-office loves Akshay Kumar. Not just domestic, even the international markets love Akki. 

 Looking back at 2005, Akshay?s films made a big splash in the UK. His five releases netted a total of ?3 million (Waqt ? ? 887,000; Dosti ? ? 707,000; Garam Masala ? ? 600,000; Bewafaa ? ? 516,000; Deewane Huye Paagal ? ? 206,000). Compare this to the other big guns of 2005 and you know who the British badshah of Bollywood is.

 Shah Rukh Khan with just Paheli grossed ? 542,000, Aamir Khan with Mangal Pandey ? The Rising could garner 

 ? 627,000, Salman Khan with Lucky and Kyon Ki... netted ? 1.5 million while Saif Ali Khan with Parineeta and Salaam Namaste could rake in ? 1.25 million.

 The star who came closest to Akshay was, in fact, Abhishek Bachchan who had moderate UK hits in Bunty Aur Babli, Dus, Sarkar and Bluffmaster. The Big B, of course, is in another league altogether with the highest grossers everywhere around the world.

 There?s more of Akshay to come in 2006. First up will be Raj Kanwar?s Humko Deewana Kar Gaye with Katrina Kaif. Then there?s Sirish Kunder?s Jaaneman with Salman Khan and Preity Zinta. And he has also been signed for Vipul Shah?s next film.

 After Jassi took the nuptial vows, it?s time for another small-screen wedding. Roshesh, the eligible bachelor of the Sarabhai family, is finally set to tie the knot. But not before a nationwide search unveils the Sarabhai Swayamvadhu. The quintessential high-society Sarabhai family will go on a multi-city hunt to find the most ?suitable? match for Roshesh, based on the entries received.

 A total of 40 girls will be shortlisted by the Sarabhais, on the basis of the profiles and photographs that the hopefuls send in. The Sarabhai family members will then visit the houses of some of these girls while the remaining will be invited for a meet-and-greet session over Chai With Sarabhai between January 17 and 20. From there four girls will be selected for the final round to compete for the title of Mrs Roshesh Sarabhai.

 Deepak Segal, executive vice-president, content, STAR India, said: ?Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai, one of the most popular shows on television, has come a long way. This Sarabhai Swayamvadhu is an initiative that will help us get up close and personal with our audiences.? A special laughter-packed episode, slated to go on air in February, will feature the four finalists trying every trick to impress the Sarabhais.

 There?s still some time for the Oscars. First up are the Golden Globes which will be in its 63rd year this time. You can catch the coveted awards show live on STAR World this Monday at 6.30 am and for those who can?t get up that early there is a primetime repeat telecast at 8 pm on the same day. 

 This year, the Golden Globe presenters include Jamie Foxx, Harrison Ford, Leonardo DiCaprio, Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Denzel Washington, Mariah Carey, Jessica Alba and John Travolta.

 This first major awards event of the year will determine which films find favour in the months to come. The hot favourites include Steven Spielberg?s Munich, George Clooney?s Good Night, and Good Luck and Ang Lee?s Brokeback Mountain. Another draw is Sir Anthony Hopkins, who will be receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.

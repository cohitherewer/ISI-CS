The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 A few months back, during the centenary celebrations of 

 Howrah station, the place wore a festive look. Temporary 

 structures and shelters in the adjoining areas were also 

 removed and hawkers evacuated. But with the passage of time, 

 the perennial occupants are back in place. The subway has 

 transformed into a business hub with hawkers occupying the 

 pavements. Hapless passengers are jostling their way to 

 the platforms with much difficulty. I request the authorities 

 to take some steps in removing these hawkers.

 Worshipped clay idols of Manasa or Sitala being left on 

 the roadside is a common sight. These are painted with toxic 

 chemicals. I have seen children playing with these idols. 

 To avoid any accidents and keep our surroundings clean, 

 these idols should be immersed and the civic authorities 

 should take steps in this regard. 

 Sunil Banerjee, VIP Road.

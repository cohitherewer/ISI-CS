 Perhaps no other season is as rich in melody, colour and the evocation of emotions as the Indian monsoon. Celebrating the eternal bond of nature with humanity, The Rainmongers presents a charming and aesthetic expression of the moods of the season. Reflecting the elegant glissandos of monsoon ragas, sitarist Abhik Mukherjee will play Miya ki Malhar and Desh. Dr Sudeshna Basu will present monsoon melodies of Tagore and Atulprasad, as well as thumris, as a counterpart to the ragas. Nipobithi Ghosh will take the audience down memory lane with her own lyrical compositions, Singing in the Rain. The poetic expressions of the evening will blossom with Barun Chanda?s recitation of The Rainstick, Bijoylakshmi Barman?s rendition of Sunil Gangopadhyay?s Borshonmala and Joy Goswami?s Meghbalika by Suchita Raychaudhuri. Anchor: Rita Bhimani. Concept and direction: Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee. Presented by Crossword Bookstore, Air-Tel Expressions and Coffee Pai.

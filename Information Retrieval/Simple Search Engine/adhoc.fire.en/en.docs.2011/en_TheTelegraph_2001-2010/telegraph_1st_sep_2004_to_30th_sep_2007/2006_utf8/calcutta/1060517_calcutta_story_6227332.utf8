Balance nature for harmony 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

Q: I 

am a budding interior designer practising independently. Most of my clients want 

to do up their house following Feng Shui. So please guide me on how the five elements 

of nature can be brought in balance in the immediate environment.

Akriti

THE SOLUTION: The environment is harmonious 

and pleasant where there is a balance of the five elements of nature. You can 

create this by bringing in elements of each one in different ways. 

Wood energy is brought into the house in the form 

of wooden furniture, panelling, flooring, fresh healthy tall green plants and 

any painting with symbols of upward movement like tall trees. 

Fire energy can be introduced in the form of lights, 

lamps, touches of red in furnishings, textured walls and vibrant paintings. 

Earth energy is best incorporated in the form of yellow 

and brown colours, marble flooring, wide and low furniture, long and heavy comfortable 

sofas, big soft cushions, square and low tables, earthen artefacts, statues, sculptures, 

heavy stone vases and crystals. 

Metal energy is extensively used in modern decor these 

days in the form of metal fixtures for lights, handles, knobs, laminates, tables 

and sofa base. 

Finally, water energy can be introduced through the 

floating shape of the sofas, chairs, upholstery, and irregular design of floor 

lamps, blue colour, fountains and aquariums. 

Metal mayhem 

Q: I 

was born on November 11, 1983. I have completed my graduation and will soon be 

joining an MBA course. Please guide me on my field of specialisation. I also suffer 

from acute skin problems and frequent stomach disorders. Please suggest a way 

out to overcome these problems.

Arun

THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal 

that you are a weak water person where metal and earth elements are totally missing. 

Lack of metal element in the body makes you prone to sensitive skin and missing 

earth element gives a very weak stomach.

You should strengthen your weak metal and earth elements 

by surrounding yourself with white, metallic and earthy colours like brown, beige, 

yellow and cream. 

Regular exercises will help strengthen the weak stomach. 

Wear a metal ring, band or chain to compensate for the missing metal element.

Presently, you are going through the metal period, 

which represents high qualification for you. You should excel in banking, finance 

and marketing.

Kid chaos

Q: We 

live in a flat where there are two bedrooms on either side of the drawing room. 

Our two small kids were initially sharing one room, but due to their frequent 

fights we made a stopgap arrangement by making our daughter sleep in the bedroom 

and our son in the drawing room. He has become more restless and irritable and 

doesnt seem to be comfortable at all. Please suggest a remedy.

Ankur

THE SOLUTION: Since your two bedrooms are placed 

on either side of the drawing room, the drawing room seems to be the centre point 

of the house, which is known as Tai Chi in Feng Shui. 

In other words, it is the brahmasthan where 

the energies from all directions flow in and merge and at the same time radiate 

back in all the directions. 

This is a vital point where the energies are at its 

peak. Hence it is not advisable to make your child sleep in the drawing room, 

which is such a volatile area. 

I would advise that he shifts back to his sisters 

room. To bring harmony between the siblings, place their photograph in a metal 

frame on the western wall.

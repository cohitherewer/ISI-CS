 Portico cave-in kills man

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man was killed and three men 

 were injured when the portico of a century-old building 

 on Kiran Shankar Roy Road collapsed on Monday morning, on 

 the heels of the smart showers on Sunday.

 The debris blocked traffic, including many vehicles headed for Howrah station. The road was cleared in the afternoon, nearly five hours after the first-floor portico collapsed around 9.30 am.

 The three-storeyed building houses about 800 shops, some of them set up decades ago. A number of lawyers of Calcutta High Court also have their offices on the premises.

 Ram Prasad Sau, 70, died in the collapse. The injured identified as Bishnupati Dey, Aniruddha Dasgupta and Nathni Shaw were admitted to SSKM Hospital.

 I was opening my shop when I heard a rumble. Within seconds, the portico had crumbled to the pavement, said Satu Shaw, who has been running a grocery shop in the building for 40 years.

 A police contingent cordoned off the area. In yet another admission of civic helplessness, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who visited the spot, said the building had been declared unsafe and its owner had been served notices twice, but to no avail.

 In the city, 700 buildings have been labelled unsafe and this was one of them. In such cases, the owner is supposed to demolish the building. Our men cannot take action as they face protests, rued Bhattacharyya.

 The mayor, though, did hint at taking a tough line. We are contemplating lodging an FIR against those who hinder us in carrying out such demolition work, he stated.

 For now, lawyers who have offices in the building moved a petition before the high court, seeking a stay on any attempt by the CMC to demolish the building. Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, in his interim order, said that the civic body would have to maintain status quo till September 8.

 According to deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Ranade, the building belongs to the Rajgarhias and an FIR has been lodged with Hare Street police station over the cave-in. A hunt for the caretaker is on.

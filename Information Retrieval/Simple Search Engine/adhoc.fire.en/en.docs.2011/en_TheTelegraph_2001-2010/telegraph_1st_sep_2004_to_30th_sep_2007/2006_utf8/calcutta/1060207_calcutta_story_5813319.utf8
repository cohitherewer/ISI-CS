 Cops see bad land deals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sachin Mukherjee: The plot thickens

 Shady deals and false promises led to the murder of Trinamul Congress leader Sachin Mukherjee, the police said on Monday.

 The 65-year-old leader, an architect, had incurred the wrath of a few whom he had promised to help bag plots against hefty payments, but failed to keep his word. 

 After voicing their resentment to Mukherjee several times, the disgruntled elements had met him two days before his murder to work out a deal. But the leader could not offer much hope. 

 Frustrated, they hired a gang to finish him off.

 On Sunday evening, three youths fired twice at Mukherjee moments after he stepped out of his office on Kali Chatterjee Road, in Sonarpur. While one bullet missed him, the other pierced his chest. 

 ?Probes suggest Mukherjee was involved in land deals and certain monetary transactions,? said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. ?We have detained one person.? From what police have gathered, the land deals seem to have been spread over Baishnabghata-Patuli, Brahmapur and Atabagan (Garia), and in some pockets of Sonarpur. 

 As a surveyor-cum-architect, Mukherjee had contacts in several departments and organisations, like the CMDA and the CPM-controlled Sonarpur-Rajpur Municipality. Banking on the contacts, he had assured a select few of handing over plots and received hefty sums from them. 

 Some of his ?clients?, however, were quick to realise that Mukherjee was not in a position to deliver the goods and started pressing him for the money. 

 On Monday evening, he had gone to Narendrapur for a family picnic. Three youths, riding two motorcycles, had turned up on the spot and inquired about the leader, sources close to the family said.

 ?Recently, a group had confronted Mukherjee at his residence in connection with some land deals in Baishnabghata-Patuli,? said a local youth, who had played a key role in the publication of Mukherjee?s two books ? Ekti Protyashar Mrittu and Baam Rajottey Haal Hakikat.

 No matter what police claim, the Trinamul is firm in its belief that Mukherjee was a victim of political rivalry. ?How can Anil Biswas say he was involved in property matters? Sachinda was an architect. Didn?t he have a right to live in this state?? party supremo Mamata Banerjee asked. She organised a march and a meeting to protest the murder.

 Rape slur on three Delhi Net friends 

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The wife of a Calcutta Police officer has lodged a complaint of rape against three New Delhi men whom she met on the Net. 

 Meera (name changed), 41, has lodged the complaint with the cyber cell of the detective department against three Delhi-based men. Meera, who works as a personal assistant with a private firm in the city, met them while chatting on the Net about four months ago. They exchanged mobile phone numbers. 

 The three introduced themselves as students of Delhi University and invited her to come to New Delhi. 

 When Meera went to attend a friend?s wedding in the capital two months ago, she called them up. They invited her to come to Janakpuri, in west Delhi. Meera met them there and had dinner with them in a restaurant . The trio then allegedly took her into a flat and raped her. They also took nude photographs of her.

 ?She has lodged a complaint of rape by three Delhi-based men. Her husband is a sub-inspector with Calcutta Police,? said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Gyanwant Singh. Meera has also lodged a complaint with Delhi Police. 

 After the alleged rape, Meera returned to her friends? place that night and told her about the incident. She later called up her husband in Calcutta, who asked her to return immediately. Meera took a train to Calcutta the next day. 

 ?In February, I met them on the Net. I did not realise that I would have to repent for that throughout my life,? she said. She stays with her husband and two children in south Calcutta.

 ?They seemed nice and that?s why I called them up when I went to Delhi to attend my friend?s wedding. The men are in their early 30?s. They took me to a flat and raped me. They told me they were criminals and had done this to several women,? she said. In April, Meera went back and lodged a complaint with Delhi Police. 

 ?They have hacked my e-mail address and send threat messages. They also harass me over phone to tell me that they will circulate my nude photographs if I do not go to New Delhi to meet them. My marriage is suffering,? Meera said. 

 Robin Hibu, deputy commissioner of police (West Delhi) said over phone: ?We have received the complaint. Investigation is being carried out. The victim did not lodge a complaint immediately after the incident. There has been no arrest.?

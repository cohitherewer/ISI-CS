 Monitor for brain-dead organ grant

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Transplantation of organs taken out from brain-dead patients has been a non-starter in Calcutta.

 To ring in a change, the state health department, with help from voluntary organisations, has framed a set of guidelines on cadaver organ donation and set up a brain stem death committee to facilitate the process.

 The committee comprises 11 specialist doctors neurophysicians, neurosurgeons, anaesthesiologists and forensic experts each from state-run and private hospitals.

 Every hospital will set up its own panel comprising the superintendent, the doctors under whom a patient is admitted and the brain stem death occurs and three members from the specialists committee to certify that the patient is brain dead. 

 The organs can be extracted from the patient after a certification from the panel.

 The government will also form a coordination centre, on the lines of Mumbais Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), to liaise between relatives of a brain-dead patient whose organs will be extracted for transplantation and the families of the beneficiaries.

 Lack of proper coordination among hospitals, doctors and relatives of the patients has been the main constraint for cadaver organ donation in Calcutta, said Debashish Banerjee, liver transplant surgeon and secretary of Ganadarpan, the voluntary organisation which will run the coordination centre.

 Trishit Roy, a member of the experts panel and director of Bangur Institute of Neurology, said the health departments move would result in increased number of organ transplants in Calcutta.

 He explained that before declaring a patient brain-dead, two of the three experts on the hospitals panel will have to be examine him separately, six hours apart.

 According to the health departments estimate, the average number of kidney transplants in Calcutta is 150 a year. In most cases, the donors are from the families of the patients suffering from kidney failure.

 Officials said a large number of patients in need of a kidney either go to other states (where organ extraction from a brain-dead patient is not much of a problem) for a transplant or, if they cannot the afford the cost, continue to be on dialysis.

 There has also been a steady stream of patients requiring liver transplant from Bengal to other states.

 In Mumbai, after the formation of ZTCC, the number of kidney transplant has gone up. The average monthly figure is two. Last month, there were four transplants in a day, said Vatsala Trivedi, transplant surgeon and general secretary, ZTCC. 

 Although kidney transplant is carried out regularly, there is hardly any hope the for vast number of patients who suffer from heart and liver failure, she rued.

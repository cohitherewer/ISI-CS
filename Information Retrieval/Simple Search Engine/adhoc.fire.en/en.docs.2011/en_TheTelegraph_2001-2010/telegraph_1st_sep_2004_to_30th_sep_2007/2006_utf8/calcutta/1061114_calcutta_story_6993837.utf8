 Turnip with tail, stainless steel woman

 - Focus 

 on younger sculptors at Akar Prakar group show 

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Mrinalini Mukherjees sculpture

 A small but significant sculpture exhibition with works culled from all over the country has opened at Akar Prakar. It has works by 31 practitioners of all ages and is very well displayed, which makes all the difference. For example, although the works of young Saurav Roychoudhury looked clumsy at an earlier crowded show, here it was easy to appreciate the poised grace of his pieces.

 A group of three musicians by Meera Mukherjee, Sarbari Roychoudhury, Sankho Chaudhuri and Somnath Hores skeletal beings are, no doubt, there, but the focus is on the works of the newer generation. Mrinalini Mukherjee is usually associated with her rope sculpture. This show presents a form resembling a leg of mutton but with tight layers like a cabbage or a rose bud. It looked curious cast in bronze, lying like a turnip with a tail on a cushion of magenta silk.

 Rajendar Tikkus tiny work has a similarly elusive quality. It is a fragment of terracotta stapled with nails and displayed on a sliver of glazed wood. Jayashree Chakravarty is known as a painter. Here there are two contemplative portraits originally made of clay and later cast in bronze. Nagji Patels works are often inspired by agricultural implements. This is quite evident from one stone piece with a pitted skin. The quaint bird with a black beak has a similarly monumental quality although it is far from large.

 P.R. Darozs two heads seemingly in meditation seem to have been inspired by the face of a bonze. B. Srinivas Reddys heads look quite decorative besides the grimness of Darozs pair.

 Prasun Ghoshs interlocked lines have a tight structure but his raised ceramic hands holding a labial mouth has become pass. Thomas Kovoors circle surrounded by minuscule figures and trees, with a something like a rhinos horn rising in the centre underlines his sense of insecurity. While these works cast in bronze have a link with traditional sculpture and have their own strength, the pieces made of wood and other material look more refreshing.

 Partha Pratim Debs pieces of found wood with paint dripping from them and Akus more structured work are more innovative. Adip Dattas large interlocked bone structure and fine drawings reflected his sensitivity. To be innovative one does not have to go overboard. Debanjan Roys fibreglass self-portrait as Natraj in Supermans tights was outr in a self-defeating way.

 P. Ladis man breaking free from a chaotic mass of clay has a painstakingly-created metallic sheen but for all his labour it resembles those Asuras that used to be produced by a certain art school-trained sculptor for the Mohammad Ali Park Durga puja.

 Seen on its own Dhruv Mistrys steatopygous female form made by assembling small stainless steel plates is remarkably slick that has a Swinging Sixties touch about it. Perhaps it should not have been viewed in isolation, instead of being seen in conjunction with his flex print (74 into 158) of a reworking of the Guernica with an Ahmedabadi twist.

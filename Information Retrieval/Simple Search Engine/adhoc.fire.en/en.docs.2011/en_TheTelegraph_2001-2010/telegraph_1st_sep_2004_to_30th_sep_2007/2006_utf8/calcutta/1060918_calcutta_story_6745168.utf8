 Civic body gropes for tax formula

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is in a fix over water tax. 

 To fulfil its commitment to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the civic body has to reintroduce the levy. But mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya is still groping in the dark for a winning formula.

 The mayor has a difficult job ahead of him. First, his formula has to be different from the one proposed by the Trinamul Congress-BJP board, and at the same time, it has to be acceptable to 100 councillors of the city proper and 41 councillors of the added areas. 

 The ADB may stop disbursing instalments of the loan amount if we dont take initiatives to impose charges on filtered water, said Bhattacharyya, who has set an April 2007 deadline for imposition of water tax. 

 The state government and the civic body signed an agreement with the funding agency in Manila in 2001 to get a Rs 1,518-crore loan to implement the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP). 

 According to the agreement, all households enjoying water supply through less-than-20-mm ferrules should have been metered by the end of fiscal 2004-2005 and all the consumers collecting filtered water from taps should be metered by the end of fiscal 2009-2010.

 Bhattacharyya is under pressure both from the funding agency and the state government for not honouring the schedule. He needs to fix the levy structure before he can introduce the charges. 

 Its a complex situation and the earlier board can be held responsible for creating this complication, claimed the mayor. 

 The biggest problem for Bhattacharyya is the divided civic house. Most of the councillors from the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur are insisting on an annual valuation of the property as the basis for levying charges for the consumption of filtered water. 

 The former Trinamul-BJP board exempted houses with annual property valuation of less than Rs 5,000 from the purview of the levy. 

 But councillors from the city proper, like Pradip Ghosh, Firhad Hakim, Suman Singh, Faiz Ahmed Khan and even former mayor Subrata Mukherjee have demanded de-linking of water charges from annual property valuation.

 Since it is a user charge, every household consuming filtered water should pay for it. I want less tax with wider coverage, said Mukherjee, who had introduced water charges in the city in November 2002. 

 According to the Trinamul-BJP board tax schedule, the house-owners had to pay Rs 150 per quarter as water tax, irrespective of the size of the ferrule, if quarterly property tax was above Rs 220. The rate was pegged at Rs 250 per quarter for house-owners paying Rs 450 or more as property tax. The tax was withdrawn following opposition from Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee. 

 Now with the Left Front civic board all set to reintroduce water tax, the Opposition parties are drawing up protest plans. We will not allow imposition of water charges in Calcutta. We will start a movement in the city if the mayor tries to introduce water tax, asserted Javed Ahmed Khan, Trinamul councillor and leader of the Opposition in the CMC.

 It was time to bid goodbye to the children of the Kalighat red-light area and the Spanish Samaritans chose to make the parting ceremony different.

 The 17-member team part of Mundo Cooperante, a Spanish NGO joined hands with over 150 kids of Kalighat to produce a cultural extravaganza at Tapan Theatre before setting off for Spain. The volunteers spent over two weeks with New Light, which works with sex workers and their children in Kalighat.

 It has been absolutely satisfying Ive gained a real vision of Calcutta and India during my stay, said Javier Pinto Sanz of Mundo Cooperante.

 New Light works for the welfare of sex workers and their children in ward 83 in Kalighat. The city-based NGO has been drawing the attention of young men and women from around the world, who come to Calcutta to spend time with the children.

 We are getting lots of volunteers from abroad. In September, another group will join us, said Arnab Basu, project coordinator for New Light.

 Besides staging the song-and-dance show, the Spanish team also actively involved itself with New Lights core programme development of facilities and infrastructure for children in Kalighat.

 And the team was, indeed, floored with the kids. The only hitch was occasional language problems. Some of the idioms in Spanish and Bengali got a little lost in translation, rued Sanz.

 For most of the volunteers, the high-point of their stay in Calcutta was the evenings entertainment programme that involved performances by the children and the volunteers, with each separate performance being based around a specific country. Some of the countries featured were Greece, Egypt, Kenya and Spain.

 Many children spend time in the street, so we wanted to broaden their horizons by bringing various parts of the world to them, explained Alban Del Pino Pardo, another member of the Mundo Cooperante team.

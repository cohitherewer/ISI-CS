 Home for mentally ill

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 A half-way home for the mentally-challenged inmates of Sane and Enthusiasts Volunteers Association of Calcutta (SEVAC) was inaugurated on Sunday by Justice (retired) Ranganath Misra, former chief justice of India, in Samali, Bishnupur.

 Spread over four bighas on the southern city fringes, the home is a model treatment and rehabilitation centre that will promote awareness about the human rights of the mentally-challenged.

 Apart from a 40-bed indoor unit, it will have an outdoor clinic and a crisis intervention, child and adolescent mental health promotion and a geriatric mental health promotion units.

 The project is funded by SEVAC, Goal (an Irish organisation) and Development Cooperation of Ireland. State Bank of India and Coal India, too, have extended their helping hands.

 Our home will work for the promotion of human rights of mental health patients languishing in correctional homes, said Prativa Sengupta, chief psychologist and coordinator of SEVAC.

 In his inaugural address, Justice (retired) Misra, who was also chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, said it had long been his dream to do something for the mentally-challenged. SEVAC has translated that dream into reality.

 Also present on the occasion were Justice (retired) V.S. Malimath, former member of the national rights commission, Justice (retired) Chittatosh Mookerjee, former chief of the state rights panel, and Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman, Coal India.

 Justice Malimath said: I have never seen such an organisation where patients are treated with genuine care.

 Explaining the reason for opening the home, SEVAC secretary Tapas Roy said: The existing building was not big enough for implementing our ideas. Upgraded services can be provided through this new home to more and more people.

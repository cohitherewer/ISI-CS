 Whether it be a stirring portrait or a decisive moment, a sublime landscape or a common sight that evokes uncommon thoughts, photographs have the power to astound, intrigue, mystify and even move us. Image 2006, the ongoing exhibition, offers a mosaic of photographs by Debatosh Sengupta. Featuring a collection of 50 of his recent works, the show covers subjects including life, nature and environment. Presented with subtle touches of imagination, the photographs represent every aspect of modern life and times, like loss of innocence, brutality towards animals and the diminishing relationship of man with his natural habitat (Daughter of the Soil; picture above). Blending science with artistic vision, some digitally-rendered images deviate from depicting a true likeness of life. The exhibition also makes an attempt, perhaps for the first time, to showcase examples of photographic art on canvas.

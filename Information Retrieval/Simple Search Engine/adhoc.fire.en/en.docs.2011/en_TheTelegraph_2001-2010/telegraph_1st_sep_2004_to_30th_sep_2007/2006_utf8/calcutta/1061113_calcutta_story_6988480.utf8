IN INDIA, WATCHING LATE-NIGHT PROGRAMMES 

WITH NEWS TICKERS CAN BE DISTURBING, FEELS CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

After the last two weeks, with men screaming at me 

for an apparent biased view on the domestic violence act, I am afraid to take 

up another womens issue. So this week I will talk about as gender-neutral 

a thing as possible: staring at the television. 

After work, after dinner, when the brain is just about 

to curdle, when you wish you could donate your heavy feet to someone else, its 

the time to switch on the telly and stare. Its one of the best tranquillisers. 

One of my aged aunts needs the television babble going 

on in the background as she goes to sleep if its switched off, she wakes 

up with a start. 

But theres a way of staring (I think men do 

that better, but I will not get into that), especially if its a news channel 

you have switched on to with the news ticker crawling at the bottom. Otherwise 

it can be very disturbing. 

I am haunted by what I saw the other night. On a news 

channel, they were beaming live a young girls attempt to create a world 

record of singing non-stop. 

The teenager, from Indore, had apparently been singing 

without a break for over two days. She was singing old Lata Mangeshkar songs. 

Her voice was cracking and she looked bleary-eyed and it was past midnight and 

she was just a child, but the crowd of friends, relatives and elders, 

including a local BJP leader, would egg her on. 

She would go on too the record was only five songs, 

four songs, now three songs away and she would sing a few lines of each song. 

It was happy reality TV. 

Likhnewaale ne likh daale sang the girl, aspiring 

to Latas nightingale high pitch and looking around and missing the high 

notes as well as the next few words, but it was working fine as I felt that comfortable 

numbness settling in on me, till my eyes fell on the ticker. The contrast was 

mesmerising. 

Ram Jethmalani says that Jessica Lals murder 

had nothing to do with a man demanding a drink from her, said the advancing ticker. 

Likhnewaale ne likh daale it was a beautiful 

old Eighties Laxmikant Pyarelal-Anand Bakshi number and the girl was given to 

repeating the first line and the ticker said that a skirmish had broken out 

between Indian and Pakistani soldiers in a Jammu prison in Bhalwal. 

Likhnewaale this time the ticker said in Rajkot 

three youth were caught for smuggling a huge amount of illegal gold. 

The girl had moved to the next song. Milo na tum 

to hum ghabraye milo to aankh churaye But the ticker, a contumacious caterpillar 

that will not be shaken off, goes on: Another farmer commits suicide in Nasik. 

Theres a fire in Chembur, Mumbai. Two terrorists killed in Doda. 

Humein kya ho gaya hai, humein kya ho gaya hai, 

sang the girl. The inexorable crawler said Babulal Marandi had won a by-election 

in Bihar and the sealing of shops was going on in New Delhi, but the Centre thinking 

of approaching the Supreme Court again. 

There was also an announcement of testing Agni III 

next year, but here the ticker was cut short, and the screen erupted into breaking 

news: the girl had done it she had sung 723 songs in 61 hours! 

It was very schizophrenic. I wished I had two pairs 

of eyes one for the top half of the screen; one for the bottom. Because this 

was true, and that was true too.

I turned to my mobile phone for comfort. It was the 

same story. The pop-up messages would not stop: the screen would light up (green) 

and the following legends would appear. 

One message said India to give terror evidence. 

To whom, I thought, but it just disappeared and the next one flashed: Which 

music director has never released an Indipop album? Who, indeed? 

Then again: Centre to open all options on sealing. 

And the next: Like dislike: Watching movies on Friday night. Only 

at 1.15 in the morning, my service provider bid me good bye after promising to 

be back soon.

I think in India, unity in diversity lies only on 

our TV and mobile screens.

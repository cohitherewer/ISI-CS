 Contemporary Indian art is characterised by its predilection towards partially-abstract images that provide a glimpse of social manners, morality and mores. North Window, an exhibition of recent paintings by a group of artists from Malda, reflects modern society and culture, as well as offers an insight into the character and disposition of the participating artists. Dedicated to the memory of Ramkinkar Baij on the occasion of his birth centenary, the show presents works with fluid forms and structures that bear resemblance to delicately modelled sculptures. The paintings of Asim Goswami, portraying the essential oneness of all living creation, make a comment in favour of universal harmony. The works of Parthasarathi Nath depict cosmic energy as the most potent force preventing chaos and maintaining equilibrium on earth. Ashis Sarkar expresses his concern for the natural environment, whose purity and beauty is being destroyed by heartless individuals. Prosenjit Dasgupta (one of his paintings appears above) affirms faith in the power of human relationships to restore peace in the world.

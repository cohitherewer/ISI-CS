 Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears and Vishal Kanoi?Wondering what the connection between the Hollywood hotties and the Calcutta choreographer can be? Well, the boy from Ballygunge who popularised jazz funk and salsa in the city is just back from a stint with Frank Hatchett, the man responsible for JLos and Britneys sexy dance moves.

 Vishal got the opportunity to train under Frank during his just-concluded four-month stint as a student of Broadway Dance Center in midtown New York.

 Not everybody gets a chance to shake a leg with the renowned jazz exponent and not everyone gets a compliment from Frank that reads: Theres a very special spot for you, Vish, with Papa Frank. When you come back, the spot will always be there? I have never met someone so special, so quick and I am glad that god has sent you to my life? I am proud of you.

 Well, the receiver of this compliment, Vishal, sure did get that chance and he plans to make the most of it.

 Having trained in Mumbai and danced for the past 13 years, Vishal has jived with Shah Rukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit in Yash Chopras Dil To Pagal Hai.

 He has also performed on stage with Bollywoods best, be it Amitabh Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan or Sushmita Sen.

 Settled in Calcutta for the past four years, Vishal runs a dance studio on Sarat Bose Road called Studio Vishal. He dabbles in various dance forms like hip-hop, salsa, rock roll and jazz funk.

 At Broadway Dance Center, Vishal added many other forms ? Latin Jazz, modern, theatre, street jazz, ballet, house, lyrical jazz and tap ? to his repertoire.

 He also got the chance to go solo in the Student Showcase at the Center.

 Instructors were impressed with his energy and performance and the student co-ordinator at Broadway Center, Bonnie Erickson, is apparently even ready to recommend Vishal to anyone whosoever.

 So, what gave Vishal the edge? We Indians emote with our faces, whereas the foreigners depend mostly on style and attitude. I think thats what really got them to notice me, says Vishal.

 This trip was an eye-opener to several dance forms, gushes the 23-year-old, still in visible awe of his teachers back in New York.

 Dancers from Janet Jacksons troupe taught us some very cool stuff. In fact, I used to think that hip-hop is one single style that boasts a lot of pep, but we had seven hip-hop trainers, each with his own interpretation, he shares.

 The student also doubled as an instructor with Vishal giving lessons in Bollywood dance styles. It all began when he happened to stroll into Lotus Music and Dance Studios, a school that teaches African, Indian, Flamenco, Polynesian and Indonesian forms of dance, and showed them his portfolio.

 Before I knew it, I was facing a cosmopolitan batch of 25 students, some NRIs but mostly foreigners, he says. Not surprising, considering how huge Bollywood now is in New York. 

 So what did they manage to learn? Lots actually, smiles Vishal. I taught them jazz funk, rock roll and a choreographed routine on Gori gori from Main Hoon Na and Ho jaata hai kaise pyar. 

 His course got over on May 2, but Vishal was asked to extend his visit for a fortnight by Frank to perform at the annual student show of Broadway Dance Center. Opening the jazz act solo is a moment I will never, ever forget, says Vishal.

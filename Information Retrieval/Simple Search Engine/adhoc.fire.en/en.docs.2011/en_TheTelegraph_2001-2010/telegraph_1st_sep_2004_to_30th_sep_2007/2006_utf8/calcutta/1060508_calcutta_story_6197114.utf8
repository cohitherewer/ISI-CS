 Light up your favourite spaces

ANUMITA GHOSH

It is not only about the glow and the gleam; home lighting today plays an integral part in creating an ambience bright and beautiful.

 With eye-catching casts and sleek moulds combined with illuminations in various hues, this segment of the industry has constantly reinvented itself to give your home a designer dimension.

 So while the old long tubes have been replaced by tiny ceiling lights and modish chandeliers, the oh-so-common yellow light bulbs have been replaced by fabric lamps and more.

 And now, you can add some flash and funk while you read and sleep, too. Start with attractive table lamps and cute little night lamps from Archies at City Centre.

 Made of fibre, the imported night lamps have a glass-like appeal combined with a bluish plastic base. Each has a tiny on/off switch in one corner. These night lights are fast flying off the racks. People relate to them as interesting gifting options that look good, are useful and pocket friendly, says a spokesperson for the store.

 A young Mickey Mouse clad in shorts, tees and boots, hands on hips and smile in place, is nice and alive. It radiates a fluorescent green glow once switched on.

 While Donald Duck looking smart with a bow and cap emits a beautiful white glow, Snoopy in a relaxed mood stands for a bright red radiance. Winnie the Pooh with a yellow base chooses to stand out, wearing the trademark red jacket and showing off his muscles.

 Put these in your room or even better in the childrens room. What better company at night for kids than their favourite cartoon characters.

 If youre a bookworm, the secret to your sound sleep at the end of a tiring day is flipping through a few pages. So, go for the paper plastic table lamps at Archies. Wrought iron moulds fused with splashes of brown and cream plastic paper give them a contemporary yet earthy look.

 A cylindrical table lamp adorned with leafy motifs and a tiny bird is the real showstealer here. For the S-shaped one, cane has been generously used against a creamish backdrop. Also find those with a woven appeal.

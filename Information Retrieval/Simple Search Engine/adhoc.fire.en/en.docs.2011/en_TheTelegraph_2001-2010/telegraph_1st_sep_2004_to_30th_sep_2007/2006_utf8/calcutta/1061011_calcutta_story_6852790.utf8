The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Port sets out on jubilee

 - LANDMARKS DELAYED

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 NOT LIT YET: Howrah bridge. A Telegraph picture

 There was a time when the river was used primarily for refuse disposal. But today, we are aiming at making the river and the riverfront attractive and productive, said A.K. Chanda, chairman of Calcutta Port Trust, which enters its 136th year on October 17. 

 The anniversary bash at Sisir Mancha will feature lectures by Royal Society fellow Ashesh Prasad Mitra on The Changing World and the Future of Bengal and on City, Port and the World by Sukanta Chaudhuri.

 Seventeen export houses will be felicitated on the same evening at Rabindra Sadan, followed by a cultural show by Port Trust employees from Calcutta and Chennai.

 But the anniversary celebrations will be bereft of two major attractions the inauguration of the Howrah bridge illumination and the Maritime Museum. 

 We could inaugurate both next week, but they are nowhere near perfection. The cabling work and rearrangement is needed before we can switch on the white, yellow and magenta lights on the bridge. And a lot more research and streamlining of displays are required for the museum, Chanda disclosed.

 The Port Trust is planning to inaugurate both landmarks by November with a few exciting additions.

 A park will be inaugurated close to the bridge anchor at the Howrah end. It will flaunt coloured fountains and trivision ads. A stamp on Howrah bridge will also be launched. 

 The maritime museum inauguration will be marked with the launch of a special archival newsletter of the Port Trust called Bollards of Time.

 We are trying to safeguard our heritage and set afloat a few new projects. The feasibility report of the proposed new port at Diamond Harbour has just come in, said Chanda.

 The trust is coming up with new projects like laser shows on the river and ports at Jellingham, near Haldia, and elsewhere, signed off Chanda.

 What: Lumiere by Satya Paul, presented by Swarovski Crystal Components Business (CCB) in association with Hyatt Regency Calcutta.

 Where: The Hyatt Regency poolside.

 When: March 8, from 9 pm.

 The ambience: The touch of class spelt out by the labels Satya Paul and Swarovski was evident in every aspect of the show. Be it the lavish spread of starters and desserts laid out during the cocktails or the brilliant lighting, the huge makeshift ramp or the music, it all went like clockwork.

 A live Tepankyaki counter and other food stalls dotted the poolside, offering the guests enough to munch on with the cocktails and the wine. A special attraction was a dessert counter that offered an impressive variety of chocolates, brownies, cheesecakes and pastries.

 The show: A special collection tailored for Calcutta by the house of Satya Paul gave glimpses of the labels spring-summer line, along with some of its latest bridal couture. The highlight of the collection, in keeping with the theme of the do, was the generous splash of Swarovski crystals ? on the ensembles as well as the stylised jewellery.

 The Swarovski CCB division supplies crystals as raw materials to designers all over the world as well as to various other fields for use in home decor and other products. We have been associated with Satya Paul for a very long time. This particular collection uses crystals as embellishments on the ensembles. We have also specially stylised some jewellery for the show, said Sanjay Sharma, country head of Swarovski CCB.

 The brief show started off with the Metallic collection ? an ornate line of saris, lehngas and kurtas defined by the distinctive Satya Paul elegance. Sheer fabrics in muted hues of dull silver, ivory and white, embellished with sensual laces, soft hand-embroidery and the Swarovski shine and shimmer made up this mesmerising collection.

 Up next on the ramp was the trademark Satya Paul palette ? black with fluorescent splashes of orange, green, yellow, red and blue ? along with the signature abstract prints. The show stealers here were the black saris with rainbow pallas.

 The colour story took a more vibrant turn in the third and final sequence of the night, with a riot of red, magenta, yellow, orange and blue ruling the ramp. The prints were abstract, with crystal highlights in abundance.

 The vibrant colour story was carried on in the jewellery too. The crystals adorning the necks and wrists of the models came in an array of hues, dominated by violets. The speciality of this line of crystals is the wide range of colours. We have also used a lot of crystal pearls. Launched by Swarovski a couple of years ago, these are artificial pearls that have crystals at the core, explained Sharma.

 Voiceover: Sanjay Sharma, managing director of Satya Paul, summed it up: We havent had a celebration since we launched our latest store in Calcutta about three months ago. You can say we are celebrating through this show. The collection was specially created for this and we are not going to showcase it in any other city. It will now be launched in Satya Paul stores across the country.

 Model watch: Showcasing the designs on the ramp were some of the top catwalkers of the country like Noyonika Chatterjee, Tupur Chatterjee, Nethra Raghuraman, Vidisha Pavate, Sonali Rozario and Rachel. They had Calcutta models Jessica, Tina, Sreshthaa and Devdutta for company. The show was choreographed by Prasad Bidappa.

 Celeb spotting: The crowd boasted quite a few designers like Kiran Uttam Ghosh, Agnimitra Paul, Snehashish Bhattacharya, Abhishek Dutta and Shamlu Dudeja. Also spotted were danseuse Alakananda Roy, model Neeraj Surana and more.

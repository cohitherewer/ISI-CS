 Shunned by kin, girl dies 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Tired of waiting for someone to take her back home, a 20-year-old inmate of Liluah Home for Destitute Women killed herself on Thursday. 

 Anita Roy, who entered the home three years ago, would often beg the home authorities to send her back to her parents or relatives. The home could not locate her parents, but got in touch with some of her relatives in Bongaon. No one wanted her back. Unable to bear the indifference, Anita hanged herself from an iron beam in the ceiling of the toilet. 

 In 1994, another girl, Meena Masna from Maharashtra, had hanged herself in the toilet.

 Anita used to live in room no. 4 in the home?s rescue section. ?She shared the room with 23 other inmates. There was only one girl in the room when the suicide took place,? said an official.

 Neera, who was in the room, said Anita left the room around 2 pm. ?After half-an-hour, I went to the toilet. I saw Anita hanging from the ceiling with a dupatta tied around her neck,? she told home officials.

 Hearing Neera scream, the staff of the home rushed to the toilet and pulled Anita?s body down. Two doctors at the home declared her dead.

 Anita had been lodged in the home since April 9, 2003. ?She was rescued by Canning police station, in South 24-Parganas,? said an official. ?She was roaming around aimlessly. They produced Anita in court and she was remanded in the home.?

 Home officials said they tried their best to send Anita to her family. ?We visited a number of places in North and South 24-Parganas and approached her relatives. But no one agreed to meet her,? said an official.

 The news of Anita?s death was sent to her family members in Bongaon. No one turned up for the body till Friday afternoon.

 Anita?s roommates told police that she had been depressed for the past two weeks. ?She almost stopped talking. Most of the time, she used to walk around the home compound aimlessly. Sometimes, she would sit in one corner of the room with tears streaming down her face,? said Bharati Bagchi, a home official.

 A group of 200 inmates collected in front her room on hearing the news of Anita?s death. ?They were crying when Anita?s body was being sent to Jaiswal Hospital. Her roommates refused to eat on Thursday night,? disclosed a home official.

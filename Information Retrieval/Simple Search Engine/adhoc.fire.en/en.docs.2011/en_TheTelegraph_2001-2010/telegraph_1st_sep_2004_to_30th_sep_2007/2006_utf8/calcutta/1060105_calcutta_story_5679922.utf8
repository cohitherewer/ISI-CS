 A drama workshop and production centre for children, Eso Natak Shikhi stages three one-act plays by them that attempts to instill patriotic pride and social consciousness among the new generation. Tatan Aar Sada Payra tells the story of a little boy, Tatan, who tries to save his country from the terrible drought. On learning that the pigeon, the bird of peace, can deliver his country from enmity and violence that have caused the calamity, he starts his journey in quest of the bird, braving all obstacles. E Aamar Desh (a scene from the play appears above) is about five boys kidnapped by terrorists at gunpoint on their way back home from school. For setting them free, the ultras demand release of their leader from jail. In the face of adversity and with a new-found love for their country, the boys plan to escape and prevent the terrorists from getting their own way. In Maranastra, the child-king of Prachinpur, a shepherd-girl and a bird together destroy a lethal weapon that threatens to endanger the life of the people. All plays directed by Tapas Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ... liplock limelight

 Here?s aiming a bit higher. Back home, before the Zidane header, we had the Mika-Rakhi Sawant liplock where a B-grade singer and a C-grade actress did all they could to hog the limelight for 15 seconds and some.

 Kiss Mat (screenshot above) is proof that they succeeded. The latest online game from Games2win is all about stealing ?a kiss from the miss? without getting photographed. So a Mika lookalike looks around furtively before trying to plant one on the miss, even as a photographer tries to catch them in the act.

 More the number of kisses, higher the score on the Pappi Meter.

 The words uttered by the ?victim? are downloadable as an audio clip, as is an MP3 of a song specially composed for the game. 

 ?We are increasingly witnessing the most bizarre incidents among celebrities being blown so out of proportion that we are using them to our advantage. Thanks to these celebs, Games2win has a list of games to make and we are responding with a vengeance,? said Alok Kejriwal, founder of Games2win.

 Wah re, Kiss Mat!

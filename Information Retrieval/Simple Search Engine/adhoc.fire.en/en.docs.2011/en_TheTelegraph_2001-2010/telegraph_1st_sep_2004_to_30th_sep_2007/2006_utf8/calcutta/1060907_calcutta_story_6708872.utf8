 Shibpur students on strike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Students of the Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) went on an indefinite strike from Wednesday.

 But the strike will be broken on Thursday, as a central team will visit the campus for talks on the proposed upgrade of the institutes status.

 We shall not budge until the authorities ask police to withdraw the pickets from the campus. Stern action can be taken against the students if found guilty, but they should not be handed over to police, said Debroop Sengupta, spokesperson for the students union on campus.

 Cases were slapped against eight second-year students for loitering on campus on August 22 beyond the 10 pm deadline. A Howrah court on Tuesday directed the institution to furnish a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh for each student.

 BESU vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea asserted: We shall not withdraw the police posting, as long as there is a possibility of disturbance on campus. And the case is between the state and the students, so we cannot withdraw it.

 Police, too, referred to the Shibpur campus as troubled. Niraj Kumar Singh, superintendent of Howrah police, said: There is a law-and-order problem at BESU and police will intervene whenever there is a threat of violence.

 On Wednesday, the eight students moved the district judges court against the bail bond order of Rs 1 lakh each.

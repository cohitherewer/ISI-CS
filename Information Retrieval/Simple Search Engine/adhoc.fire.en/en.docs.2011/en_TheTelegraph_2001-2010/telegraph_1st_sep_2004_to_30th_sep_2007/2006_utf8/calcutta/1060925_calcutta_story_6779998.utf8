 What: 

 Shoppers Stop Pujor Saaj, a fashion show as part of 

 the Shoppers Stop Sananda Pujor Bazar.

 Where: Shoppers Stop, City Centre.

 When: September 20.

 Take a look: Models Tanushree, Sanchita, Priya, Lovely, Arpita, Neeraj, Arka, Rahul and Yash took customers through a series showcasing the autumn-winter collection at the store. The show moved from casual wear to ethnic to sports to office and finally to party wear.

 From jeans and flowing skirts to cargo pants for men for Saptami morning, to embroidered suits in black and cream for the women and rust and off-white kurta sets for men on Navami evening, there was something to wow everyone at the show.

 Since Puja shopping is not just about clothes for those four days, but about replenishing ones wardrobe for the season, the show moved on to sports wear. Shorts, fitted skirts with sleeveless tees, track pants and sneakers formed this collection.

 Then there was officewear. While A-line skirts with fitted shirts and formal striped or solid-colour trousers formed the mainstay of the womens range, the mens line included linen trousers, striped shirts, semi-formal corduroys and khakis.

 While partywear for women featured a lot of dresses and smart empire lines, the men sported bolder shirts like reds and pinks in silk finish.

 The show was peppered with music and an informal quiz, with winners getting gift vouchers of Rs 100 each.

 Still to come: The Shoppers Stop Sananda Pujor Bazar, on till October 2, will host performances by Krosswindz, Dhumketu and Jojo, and Antakshari sessions with singer-anchor Parama.

 Voiceover: A fashion show is always a good idea to introduce a collection, even at a store, because customers can judge better when they see a dress on a person rather than on a hanger, said Santanu Ghosh, customer care associate and unit head, Shoppers Stop, Salt Lake.

 Royal flavours

 What: Hyderabadi Festival.

 Where: Tamarind on Sarat Bose Road.

 When: Till October 2.

 On offer: The Dawat-e-Nizam brings a lavish spread of rich legacies from the erstwhile royal kitchens. Begin with the Murg Badami Shorba, Nahari or Peethala Charu, a spicy, tangy crab soup from Andhra. Move to the Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Boti Kebab or Pathar Ka Gosht.

 In the main course, fish-loving Bengalis can choose from Hyderabadi Lagan Ki Masala Machhii and the Jhinge Malai Korma. Or sample the Hyderabadi Murg, Murg Malai Korma, Ambada Chicken and Dum Ka Chicken. Red meat lovers can binge on Leg Roast, a speciality of the Hyderabadi gharana, or Aloo Gosht Ka Keema.

 And finally theres the biryani the usual Hyderabadi Chicken and Mutton Biryani plus the special Suyani Biryani.

 The choicest delicacies of Hyderabadi cuisine are non-vegetarian, but vegetarians need not feel left out. Starting with the Tomato Dhaniya Shorba and Rasam, to vegetarian kebabs like Vegetable Lukmi and Paneer Tikka Masala to the Hyderabadi Chelmon Subzi Biryani and Achari Aloo, Baghare Baigan and Tamatar Paneer, theres enough to tickle their taste-buds.

 End on a sweet note with the famed Qubani Ka Meetha or Double Ka Meetha.

 To give a complete feel of Hyderabadi culture, Tamarind has tied up with different organisations of the city, including the Andhra Pradesh tourism department.

 While khansamas have been brought in from Hotel Shadab in Hyderabad for an authentic flavour, Moti Mahal, an exhibition-cum-sale of pearls and pearl jewellery, will showcase the collection of Sri Jagdamba Pearls. Bangle sellers from the Charminar will be present and qawwalis will be played at the restaurant.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start from Rs 40 and go up to Rs 500.

 Voiceover: Last year, we had presented Dawat-e-Nizam with a symbolic ambience, and the response was so encouraging that this year we decided to go to Hyderabad and rope in associates. Our aim is to promote the true colours of Hyderabad. We think this will go down well during the Pujas because the cuisine suits the Bengali palate, said Gautam Purakayastha, co-owner of Tamarind.

 Paper tiger

 What: Launch of Fold In Fold Out Origami Originals, a book on origami by Shivaram Narayanan, followed by an origami workshop.

 Where: Emami Landmark.

 When: September 19.

 Take a look: That 17-year-old Shivaram Narayanan loves playing with folded paper could be made out from the small figures glued to the front of his black shirt. At the origami workshop that he conducted at the bookstore, the teen prodigy took just a minute to fold a square piece of paper into a disposable cup.

 Fold In Fold Out Origami Originals, a book authored by the 17-year-old expert in the Japanese traditional art form, was launched by consul general of Japan Yoshikazu Takeuchi. The book, the first of its kind in India, features origami figures mostly made by Shivaram.

 At the workshop, the youngster urged the audience to follow him as he demonstrated how to create different figures with pieces of paper. Mentally-challenged children from the NGO Mentaid also participated in the workshop. 

 Voiceover: I love 

 origami, but I want to be a musician, said the bespectacled 

 boy with a smile on his face, before breaking out into a 

 song on origami composed by him.

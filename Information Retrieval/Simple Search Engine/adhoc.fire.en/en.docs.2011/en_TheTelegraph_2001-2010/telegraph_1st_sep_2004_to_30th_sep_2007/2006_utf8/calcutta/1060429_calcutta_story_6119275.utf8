 Illegal parking lot for trucks thrives

 Remember the illegal lot in the port area, where 25,000 AK-47 bullets were found on a Jammu and Kashmir-bound truck parked for a month? 

 More than two years have passed since then, but the parking lot still thrives, thanks to a police-criminal nexus.

 A recce on Friday revealed that about 100 alleged criminals have become custodians of the Dhobi Talab parking lot. Known as ?caretakers?, they have even built a hut with an asbestos roof that serves as the ?office?.

 Five people, in their 40s, were sitting on a wooden bench outside the hut, collecting fees from truck drivers. The rates are fixed: Rs 200 for parking a truck for 12 hours and double the amount for a day.

 Three officers of West Port police station stood guard over the queues of trucks in the parking lot. A sizeable portion of the collection allegedly goes to the thana. The rest is distributed among the caretakers.

 ?Most ?caretakers? have criminal antecedents. They now eke out a living from the parking business,? said an officer of the police station. ?They will probably return to crime if the lot is dismantled.?

 Shahjada, alias Janu, a history-sheeter, controls the parking lot operations with the help of his henchmen Shahjahan, Bhola and Aslam. The trio was arrested in February 2005 for a dacoity at Netaji Subhas Dock.

 A resident of Darbhanga, in Bihar, Shahjada was arrested in 2004 for an attempt to murder. He also runs a transport business.

 Kanchan Raha, officer-in-charge of the police station, said there was a crackdown on the parking lot following the recovery of the ammunition. ?We have asked the people manning the lot to record the registration numbers of the parked vehicles, along with details of the drivers and consignments,? he added.

 He denied that his men get a cut of the earnings.

 Deputy commissioner (port) Ajoy Ranade said the encroachments on the plot, owned by Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), would be removed. ?A drive will be undertaken after the polls,? he promised.

 He refused comment on the alleged cop-criminal nexus.

 CPT chairman A.K. Chanda expressed readiness in helping the cops dismantle the parking lot. ?If there is any illegal activity on our land, we are ready for a crackdown.?

 Additional commissioner of police Anup Chatterjee said the port authorities are planning to build a truck terminal to solve the parking problem.

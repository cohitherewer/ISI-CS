 February fancy for flowers

 RIDDHIMA SEAL

 Red is the colour of love and roses are the best means of expressing your emotions. No matter how much the mindset of todays youth has changed in all matters, the medium they choose to express their love hasnt changed at all, smiles Indira Agarwal of Ferns N Petals, Loudon Street.

 Rajesh Rathi of Right Florist echoes Indira. There is no substitute for red roses on Valentines Day. Youngsters simply dont want to settle for anything else. Also, most of the products on offer at our boutique are red, be it heart-shaped chocolates in red packs or heart-shaped red watches, says Rajesh.

 The store on Lake Road has already booked several orders for home delivery of rose bouquets and expects the number to go up to 300 by the time February 14 comes calling.

 Its the eternal red rose, but in swankier packaging, that the new-age florists are dishing out this V-Day. Complemented by candles, cushions, air pillows, chocolates, wine bottles and balloons, exquisite flower arrangements dot the racks of these boutiques.

 At Ferns N Petals, there is of course a wide variety of roses to pick from, beginning from a single stem to a whole bouquet. Bouquets are available in sets of six or 12 roses, beautifully stylised with ribbons and stars.

 A unique offering from this store is the Black Rose or the Disco Rose. Though most youngsters prefer roses, they like to see some innovation attached to them. The Disco Rose is nothing but an element of style added to the flower in the form of golden or silver glitter, says Indira.

 The roses are often complemented by crystal flowers and dry flowers, the sale of which witnesses a significant rise during this time. People want a stick or two of these artificial flowers to be incorporated in the bouquets, so that they can be treasured for long, feel both Rajesh and Indira.

Complete gifts packs for the occasion are in high demand. A pack at Ferns N Petals includes six to 12 roses combined with chocolates, wine bottles, red hearts and scented candles. The size of the packs and the components vary according to preference and budget. These days, people have very little time to go shop-hopping. These packs combine all the V-Day goodies and hence make for suitable gifts, says Indira.

 V-Day gift packs are quite popular with youngsters today, agrees Rajesh of Right Florist. While the bulk of the pack comprises flowers, we add more goodies so that you dont have to go looking for gifts separately. It also works out much more economical this way.

 A real value addition from Ferns N Petals is the V-Day special music service. On placing your flower delivery order well in advance, a guitarist will accompany the bouquet and play tunes of love at your sweethearts doorstep. 

 Music and flowers go together in creating the perfect romantic ambience. So this year we decided to gift Calcuttans this completely new concept, smiles Indira.

 Another V-Day special offering from these flower boutiques is the Valentines World Service that will deliver flowers to as many as 68 countries the world over.

 Valentines Day is no longer just about showering affection on your partner. It has now become much wider and its a day when you can show your affection for anyone you love. We have seen sons-in-law buying flowers for their mothers-in-law, kids for their mothers and vice-versa. People even buy flowers for pets on V-Day. And with friends and family living in different cities, the demand for these services is very high, offers Indira.

 Most florists will stay open round the clock on February 13 and 14, but the home delivery orders will close a day in advance. So, say it with flowers while they are still fresh.

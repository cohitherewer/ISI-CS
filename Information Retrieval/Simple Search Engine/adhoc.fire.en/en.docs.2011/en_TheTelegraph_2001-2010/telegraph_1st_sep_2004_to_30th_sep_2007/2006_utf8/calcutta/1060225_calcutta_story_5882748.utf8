 Samples swamp test hub

 Two trained doctors, two deep freezers and three assistants to deal with samples from as many as 13 states ? the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Belgachhia, the only facility in eastern India for testing poultry diseases, is crumbling.

 The laboratory is flooded with samples every day, all need to be packed in ice-filled thermocol boxes and sent off to High Security Disease Diagnostic Lab, in Bhopal, India?s only centre for testing avian flu. 

 The authorities are left with no time for their primary tasks. Research has taken a backseat and even the basic tests for the dreaded viral disease of poultry, Ranikhet, have been discontinued.

 ?Ours being the only centre of its kind in the eastern region, expectation runs high and we are doing our best to live up to it. Among our various jobs, sending samples to Bhopal is obviously the top-most priority,? said Captain A.G. Bandyopadhyay, joint director of the laboratory. 

 And it?s this priority that has sent the staff to a tizzy.

 For the two doctors, Kushal Pal and Gurucharan Dutta, the morning hours are reserved for visits to select spots in the districts for collecting samples or readying them for the tests in Bhopal.

 The second half is spent packing the samples in small boxes, filling them with ice-packs, drafting letters to the director of the Bhopal centre about the nature of the samples and collating details.

 The day ends at seven in the evening, when doctors draw up their next day?s plan. ?You can hardly catch your breath now,? said a employee who handles the samples.

 All that the room for virological tests now boasts of are two tables, a refrigerator, a glass almirah (stacked with fixing tapes, papers, glue and a few glass funnels), a chair, some pipettes, a list of dos and don?ts on bird flu and a printed manual for diagnostic tests.

 ?Earlier, we used to collect serum and test it for Ranikhet. But even that has stopped now. Work on vaccines has also come to a halt,? said an insider.

 Scare on the wane

 The bird flu scare in the city is on the wane, animal resources development minister Anisur Rahaman claimed on Friday.

 To back the ?fact? with figures, he pointed out that the Surabhi stall in Belgachhia had sold 250 chickens on its inaugural day on Wednesday. ?Till this afternoon, another 150 birds were sold out.?

 The outlet sells raw processed chicken and duck meat, in addition to mutton, quail, lamb and rabbit meat.

 J.L. Chakraborty, additional director in minister Rahaman?s department, added: ?Chicken sales in markets across Calcutta, though not back to normal, have picked up today.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Meryl Streep

 You?re full of thoughts and ideas. You have the ambitions 

 of an artiste and the mind of a businessman. You try not 

 to let imaginary guidelines and fantasies overshadow reality. 

 You?re self-reliant and gifted with a good memory. Your 

 biggest challenge lies in learning to save money. ? 

 Kusum Bhandari

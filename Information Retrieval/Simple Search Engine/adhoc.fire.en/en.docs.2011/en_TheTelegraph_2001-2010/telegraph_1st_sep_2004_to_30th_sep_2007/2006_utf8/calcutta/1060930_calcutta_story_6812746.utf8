The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The chase begins again

 On Mahashtami, Pratim D. Gupta conjures up the remakes of three classics, complete with a new cast and a fresh canvas

Nayak 

 Satyajit Rays cult classic on the life of a film star remains relevant even to this day but it definitely demands a fresh pan-Indian canvas. To be directed by Aditya Chopra, the new Nayak will bring back the Dilwale duo of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. Shah Rukh will play Uttam Kumars Arindam Mukherjee, a big Bollywood star grounded at the Singapore airport by a flash strike on his way to Malaysia to receive the Best Indian Actor at the MTV Asia Awards. Arindam is forced to take the Star Cruise from Singapore to Malaysia where he meets a lifestyle reporter also headed for the same event. Kajol plays Miss Adhunika Aditi Sengupta (Sharmila Tagore in the original). The character of Promila (Sumita Sanyal), will get more footage in the flashback sequences and will be played here by a sensuous Bipasha Basu.

Kill Bill

 Someones got to slap the Made in India tag on Quentin Tarantinos classic. Someones got to cast Sushmita Sen as the Bride (Uma Thurman). And someones got to convince Amitabh Bachchan to play Bill (David Carradine). The supporting cast should be as strong, with Sanjay Dutt playing Budd (Michael Madsen), Priyanka Chopra playing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Sameera Reddy as Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).

 The setting should be similar, but in the Mumbai underworld with portions shot in Dubai and Afghanistan. Dream director? Farhan Akhtar, post-Don.

Golmaal

 After his hilarious Munnabhai double bill, Rajkumar Hirani should helm the GenX version of Hrishikesh Mukherjees comic caper. It will be difficult to fill the shoes of Utpal Dutt, but if theres one man who can come close to being Bhavani Shankar it has to be Boman Irani. Knowing his obsession with perfection, he should pick up the Bengali twang and mouth dantkelane banchharam with an accent to make all of us proud. 

And who can play Ram Prasad Dashrath Prasad Sharma aka Lucky? After their infectious chemistry in Darna Mana Hai, Saif Ali Khan would be the perfect foil for Boman. Another challenge for the suave Chhote Nawab, the man who can do anything after Langda Tyagi. His sense of humour? Just what every Dil Chahta Hai.

 The setting? Salt Lake, where Saif works in Bomans IT firm. Salt Lake, where Saif slips out of office into the stadium to watch Mohun Bagan vs East Bengal. Salt Lake, where Saif romances Bomans dear daughter Vidya Balan (a big leap forward from the boring Bindiya Goswami).

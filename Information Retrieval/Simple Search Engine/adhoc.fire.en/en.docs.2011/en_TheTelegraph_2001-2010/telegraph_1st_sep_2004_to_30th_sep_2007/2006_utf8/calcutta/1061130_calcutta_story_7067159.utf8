The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Street chic in sin city

 Ishaa Koppikar and Priyanka Chopra in Aki Narula creations in Don 

 He has clothed the stars for 

 some of Bollywoods biggest recent hits including Bunty 

 Aur Babli, Bluffmaster and, now, Don. His hands 

 full with several other Bollywood assignments, Aki Narula 

 unveils his latest collection on the Calcutta ramp at the 

 Stylefile Winter Show 2006.

 The multi-designer fashion affair at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton amp; Towers on Saturday is being hosted with The Telegraph as media partner. 

 The ace designer from Mumbai will showcase a collection inspired by the street fashion of Camden, London. The feel of the clothes is sin city, while the aura is goth, says Aki.

 The gothic feel is played out in the colour palette, with the collection in all-black. Theres a lot of black surface detailing and texturisation on black bases.

 The silhouettes are romantic with high-waisted dresses, capes, skinny jeans, boleros and duffel coats.

 Theres a lot of accent on drapes, form and structure, adds Aki.

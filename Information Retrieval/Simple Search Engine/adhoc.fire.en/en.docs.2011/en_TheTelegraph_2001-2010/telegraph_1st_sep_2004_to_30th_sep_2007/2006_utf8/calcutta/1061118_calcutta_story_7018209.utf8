 You share your birthday with...

 Elizabeth Perkins and Chloe Sevigny

 Full of ambition, you are good at people skills. You are kind about others shortcomings, as long as they are sincere and honest. At work, you always look for better ways to make a profit, provided you dont have to invest a lot of time. Patience isnt your forte. Kusum Bhandari

 Tucked away in a narrow lane at 2, Justice Chandra Madhab Road (in Bhowanipore) is 48 Hours The Furniture Hub that prioritises solutions above all else. So, ready-to-assemble, modular, standalone, linear, ornate, corner or straight-line units pick what suits your space best. And thats not all, you also get to choose from international furniture brands from Germany and the US.

 Spread over 4,000 sq ft, 48 Hours, that upped its shutters on November 7, is the brainchild of Jaydeep Chitlangia, managing director, Sarda Plywood. Says Chitlangia: The idea is to allow the client to create his/her own space and offer interiors that suit his/her lifestyle. Our collection is contemporary and quality is guaranteed. 

 The ambience is vibrant yet soothing. To the right of the entrance is a striking fluorescent wall with maple leaf illustrations. As you climb up the wooden stairs, a huge Egyptian wall hang catches the eye.

 Carpet flooring in peach and pale red exudes a feeling of warmth. Furniture has been integrated into bedroom, living room, dining room and office set-ups. This helps you understand your furniture better, explains Jaydeep. 

 Future plans include a tiles and bathroom fittings outlet on the ground floor. Outlets at Ranchi, Bhubaneswar and Jaipur are in the pipeline, says Jaydeep.

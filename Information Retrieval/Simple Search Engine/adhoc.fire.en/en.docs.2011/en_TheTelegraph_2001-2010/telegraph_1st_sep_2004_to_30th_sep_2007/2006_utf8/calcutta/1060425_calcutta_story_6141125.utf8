 Tease tag on jawans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Jawans of the paramilitary force, in the city for the polls on April 27, have caused the first flutter ? an alleged incident of eve-teasing. 

 There was an uproar in a shanty area on Bidhannagar Main Road on Sunday night over charges against the jawans of misbehaving with women and passing lewd comments at them. 

 Residents of the slums alleged that the Central Industrial Security Force jawans had entered their locality late on Sunday and misbehaved with the women. They returned on Monday morning and harassed the women near a pond.

 Subhash Goswami, coordinator of the central paramilitary force engaged in poll duty, rubbished the allegation. 

 ?There is absolutely no truth to that allegation. But I heard there was some trouble on Monday morning while the jawans were bathing in the pond. So, we have fenced off the portion that the securitymen will use with a polythene sheet,? he stated.

 A team of officers from Ultadanga police station went to the spot to pacify the slum-dwellers. ?The officers also met the jawans,? said Badal Maity, officer-in-charge of Ultadanga police station.

 On Monday, police were deployed in the area. ?We are not taking a chance, with two days to go for the polls,? said another officer of Ultadanga thana.

 Civic body scraps tallest tower plans

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Left Front board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has dropped plans to build Banga Shikhar, a 50-storey residential-cum-commercial building, at Bainchtala, on EM Bypass. 

 The building, a pet project of former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, was to have been a joint venture of the CMC and the Bengal Ambuja group.

 At a mayoral council meeting last Friday, it was decided that the 10-acre plot would be divided into four or five parts. 

 ?The mayor has suggested construction of a restaurant-cum-auditorium for performing arts, star-rated hotels, a hospital and specialised educational institutions on the plot,? disclosed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 ?We will soon float tenders to lease out the plots, mentioning the specific use of each. The highest bidders will get to execute the projects, subject to approval of their proposals,? Bandyopadhyay added.

 The lease deeds will specifically mention that use of the plots for purposes other than the projects approved of by the CMC will lead to cancellation of the agreement.

 The civic body will also impose restrictions on the height of the structures to be built on the plots.

 The Trinamul Congress board had handed over the 10-acre plot to Coal India after Mamata Banerjee?s re-induction into the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) cabinet as coal minister. The Trinamul leader announced the setting up of a clinic on it for people involved in coal mining in eastern India.

 Accordingly, Coal India signed a memorandum of understanding with the CMC to build a hospital along the lines of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The project was scrapped after NDA?s departure from power.

 Subrata Mukherjee, who was then mayor, subsequently started discussions with private parties for the construction of the tallest building in the city on the plot. 

 Bengal Ambuja, which came on board as the civic body?s partner for the project, had suggested the name Banga Shikhar.

 A four-member committee was then formed in the CMC, headed by then municipal commissioner Debashis Som. The panel gave the green light to the 50-storey structure.

 Mukherjee, however, failed to get the proposal ratified in a mayoral council meeting, following protest from members Anup Chatterjee and Javed Ahmed Khan.

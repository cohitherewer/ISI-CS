 Used as base fabric or ornamentation, 

 net is being styled like never before, discovers Shradha 

 Agarwal

 Sheer, flowy, sensuous, dreamy?A 

 few words that come to the mind when you think nets. As 

 delicate trimmings, interlinings, veils or bridal gowns 

 and ballet dresses, this fabric never falls out of favour 

 with designers.

 But this season, the net is being 

 shaped and styled like never before. While most designers 

 are playing around with the fabric as base material, city 

 stylist Sunipa Samadder takes the story a step forward and 

 captures nets in a double role. She first uses 

 it as a base and then tops it as ornamentation.

 With sequins sandwiched 

 between appliqu?d net technique or the rouched effect 

 to give a three-dimensional appearance, net ornamentation 

 seems here to stay.

 Says Sunipa: Net is the 

 single most versatile piece that can be easily rolled and 

 carried in any handbag. Used simply as a basic throw, it 

 makes for magical makeovers for any ensemble.

 Tulle or net, whatever you might 

 choose to call it, GoodLife takes a closer look at 

 this mesh of tiny hexagons in its newest look.

 White wonder

 A length of white net is perhaps 

 the most versatile piece to possess. Thrown casually over 

 a vibrant ensemble to downplay the effect or wrapped tightly 

 around a perfect figure to play up the curves, it remains 

 a little white wonder.

 Sunipa uses the versatile number 

 as a stylised drape in the form of a sari. Teamed with a 

 crepe-tissue, chequered skirt in gold and a layered bikini 

 top, this ensemble is perfect for a formal occasion.

 An outfit like this is designed 

 for a woman who likes to make a strong style statement, 

 says Sunipa. This sari is ornamented with rouched net, sequin-sprinkled 

 tissue, and a striped silver net. The bold motifs are toned 

 down by the sheer whiteness of the sari.

 Tradition twist

 Since establishing itself as one 

 of the strongest silhouettes last year, the corset continues 

 to make waves. Sunipa has teamed a sea-green net sari with 

 a magenta corset in raw silk. This look makes for a fast, 

 easy drape ? perfect for someone who is always running against 

 time, but wants to turn heads.

 An ensemble like this can 

 be worn at an engagement ceremony or a glamorous do like 

 a film mahurat, says Sunipa, who dresses film 

 personalities.

 For a traditional twist, team 

 up a net sari with a conservative silk blouse and complete 

 the look with chunky, ethnic jewellery.

 Typical forms of embroidery like 

 zardosi and aari lend any length of net a 

 complete traditional makeover. Parsi borders also 

 make for pretty detailing for a net sari, adds Sunipa.

 This particular sari is appliqu?d 

 with a tie-and-dye crepe and pink rouched net. The motifs 

 run as wild creepers on the surface.

 Ornamented further with rhinestones, 

 beads, gold and silver metal sequins, the colour palette 

 lends a further jewelled look to the ensemble.

 Denim dazzle

 Denims, an easy top and net ? 

 ingredients for a stylish recipe. Slim-fit jeans, short 

 denim skirts or even dresses, nets can act as add-ons effortlessly. 

 Sunipa has draped an ombre-dyed 

 net sari in flaming orange over denims and a silk crushed 

 top. The sari is ornamented with sequin-sprinkled silk tulle, 

 sequins sandwiched between appliqu?d net and rouched net. 

 Orange rhinestones and beads are spread generously in clusters 

 and hung as danglers. Bold floral motifs on the sari add 

 zing to the ensemble.

 Just right to boast at a 

 high school party, this outfit, says Sunipa, can also 

 be styled comfortably over a trumpet-shaped crushed silk 

 skirt or even a denim skirt. 

 Nets used as an over-layer 

 to accentuate the existing shape and colour are great because 

 they add glamour without lending volume, keeping the silhouette 

 intact all the way, adds Sunipa.

 If saris are not exactly your 

 style, try net shrugs or boleros, detailed with delicate 

 net rosettes.

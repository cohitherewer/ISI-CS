 Vivid picturisations of the world around us are portrayed in the many-hued canvases of the students of The Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship. Parampara, the ongoing exhibition of works by them and their teachers, offers a delightful insight into an almost magical universe that has been all but forgotten in the modern age of science and technology. Innocent, childlike expressions of the heart, the paintings on display appeal directly to the emotions of the viewer. At the same time, all of them may be found to convey several layers of meaning, some of those are topical. Participating students include Madhuja Dhar, Mithu Das, Pintu Sikdar, Subha Basu, Ushasi Paul (The Doll?s House- II; picture above) and Sukanta Dutta. Participating teachers include Debashis Mitra, Dipankar Dutta, Subhas Roy, Subhashis Saha and Swapan Kumar Mallik.

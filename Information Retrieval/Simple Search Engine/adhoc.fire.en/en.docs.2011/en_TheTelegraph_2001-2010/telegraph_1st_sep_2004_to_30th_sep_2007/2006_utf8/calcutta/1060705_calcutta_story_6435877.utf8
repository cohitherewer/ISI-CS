 Coinciding with the Forestry Week from July 14, the state forest department will undertake an afforestation drive across the city.

 The drive kicks off on July 15, with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee presiding over a function at Citizens Park, where more than 50 fruit trees, flower plants and medicinal herbs will be planted.

 ?The parks in the city can be decked up by planting big trees. Several parks have been selected for the afforestation drive this year, Citizens Park being one of them,? said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forest (urban and recreational forestry).

 ?Citizens Park, in the heart of the city, is a favourite strolling ground of many a Calcuttan, but it does not have any big tree. Hence, the decision to plant fruit trees. The trees will attract birds to the park,? he added.

 Trees like mango, guava and jackfruit are on the forest department?s list for plantation. 

 The department has taken some safety measures for the success of the programme. ?We have taken a conscious decision to avoid sowing seedlings, as the survival rate of seedlings is less than that of plants,? said the deputy conservator of forest.

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which looks after Citizens Park, has given its consent to the department for the plantation drive.

 ?We are honoured that the chief minister has shown interest in the programme,? said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, mayoral council member (parks and gardens).

 The department has also chalked out a plan for planting as many as 100,000 trees across the city. The civic body and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will be responsible for the drive, in which local residents and clubs, too, will be involved.

 Presidency College, Alipore and Presidency jails and SSKM Hospital are some of the other stops in the drive.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A big gathering of world-class academics will be held in the city next month. In an attempt to showcase its contribution towards advancement of learning during the past 150 years, Calcutta University (CU), for the first time, will organise a series of international-level academic meets from November onwards, to be followed by a grand seminar next March. 

 A few hundred experts from almost every field of education, including Nobel laureates, scientists, economists, historians, and social scientists, representing top national and international institutions, will attend the meets.

 This is the first time in the past many years that so many experts from nationally and internationally famous institutions and organisations will visit the city in so short a span of time November 2006 to March 2007, said Pradip Narayan Ghosh, former dean of science of CU and chairman of the seminar and exhibition committee set up by the university to celebrate its 150th birth anniversary. These are the concluding functions of the year-long ceremony to observe completion of 150 years of the universitys existence.

 Its time to let the whole world know how we have grown and the role we have played during these 150 years. We ourselves must understand where we stand compared to other reputed institutions of our country and abroad, Ghosh said.

 The university will spend over Rs 30 lakh on the meets. A considerable portion of the expenses, in addition to the Rs 30 lakh, is being sponsored by the department of science and technology and the department of atomic energy of the Centre, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Indian Institute Chemical Biology and Bose Institute, CU sources said.

 Speakers from institutes of the US and the UK like MIT, Harvard and Cambridge are expected to attend the programmes and interact with teachers and students of the university. Participants from renowned institutions from countries such as Germany, Japan, Seoul, Austria, Switzerland, France, Indonesia, China and many more, too, will attend.

 The list of countries is huge. We aim to have participants from as many countries as possible, said Ghosh. 

 The panel will finalise the institutes at a meeting to be held shortly. We will invite at least six Nobel laureates, including Amartya Sen, to attend the seminar in March, a source said.

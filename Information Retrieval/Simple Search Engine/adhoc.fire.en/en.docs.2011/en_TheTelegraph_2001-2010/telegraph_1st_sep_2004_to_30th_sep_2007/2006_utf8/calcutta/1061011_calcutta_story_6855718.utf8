 The crowds were definitely thinner this Puja. Youngsters these days like to spend their holidays outside the city. The older people, on the other hand, have the option of watching the idols on television. Those who have to attend office every day, naturally, opt to stay home during Puja. The threat of heavy rain also acted as a deterrent. 

 Indranil Sanyal, 

 Dhakuria

 The crowds were thinner this Puja due to three main reasons. There was intermittent rain causing waterlogging on important thoroughfares in north Calcutta. The early declaration of some Puja awards resulted in concentration of people at a handful of pandals. The flood in Murshidabad, Hooghly and Birbhum also led to a drop in number of revellers.

 Yes, few people ventured out during the day this Puja. But many were out till the early hours of the morning. Has the Calcuttan become nocturnal?

Ranadip Ganguly, 

 Diamond Park

 Crowds were thinner in pandals this year as the raingod played spoilsport. However, even the showers failed to mar the festive spirit.

 Chameli Pal,

 Batanagar

 The crowd was definitely thinner this Puja. The reasons are manifold. The suburbs now host impressive pujas, so there is no longer a rush of people from there to Calcutta. The elderly have also stopped visiting pandals, thanks to live coverage of Puja on television. Finally, unlike in the past when Puja was the only time boys could manage to interact with girls, free mixing of genders has become the norm, dampening the interest of the teenagers in Puja somewhat.

U. Bhattacharyya,

 Entally

 Like every year, the goddess had crowds at Her feet this Puja. I went pandal-hopping and did not notice any drop in the number of revellers. There is no reason for the crowds to be thinner. The weather was generally good and people took the opportunity to make merry. Though afternoon showers on Saptami and Ashtami resulted in waterlogging even inside pandals, the spirits of the people were not dampened. The Puja will always attract devotees of the goddess and aficionados of art and culture.

 Vinay Shreshtha,

 Salkia 

 People have now started going out of the state to celebrate Durga puja. Hence, the crowds at the puja pandals have become thinner over the years.

 Md Sarfaraz Alam,

 Kamarhati

 The crowds were thinner this Puja because of the downpour. Heavy rain lashed central and south Calcutta forcing pandal-hoppers to scurry for shelter. There was 0.2 mm of pitter-patter on Sashthi, 14.8 mm of showers on Saptami, 5.5 mm of drizzle on Ashtami followed by 17.4 mm downpour on Navami. The festive spirit however was not hampered by the rain. 

 Ravi Khaitan, 

 Park Circus

 The number of pandal-hoppers fell this year primarily due to rain. Waterlogging in several parts of the city because of lapses on part of the civic body prevented many from going out. The revellers, however, took to the streets with gusto as soon as the sky cleared.

 Neha Almal,

 Howrah

 For most Calcuttans, the lure of indoor adda proved stronger than the desire to move from pandal to pandal this year. Frankly, staying at home and unwinding with friends and family is more enticing than being elbowed by hundreds of people and wading through slush.

 Syandika Dutta,

 Address not given

 The crowds were definitely not thinner this puja compared to the past few years. In fact, some pandals registered an increase in footfall. The crowd, in general, was more disciplined and the credit for that goes to Calcutta Police. 

 Nidhi Poddar,

 Salt Lake

 No, there was no drop in the number of pandal-hoppers this year. But some teenagers chose to go to discotheques and dandiyas instead.

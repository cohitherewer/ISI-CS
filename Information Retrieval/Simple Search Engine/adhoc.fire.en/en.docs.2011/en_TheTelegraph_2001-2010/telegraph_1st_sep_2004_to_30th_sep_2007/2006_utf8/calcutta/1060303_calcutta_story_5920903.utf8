The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Is the laughter man on line?

 Getting a word out of gag-a-minute PARESH RAWAL is no laughing matter, finds Pratim D. Gupta, as he manages to buttonhole the Malamaal Weekly hero

 A tete-a-tete with a Shah Rukh Khan or an Amitabh Bachchan is surely a much-desired affair in the star-studded career of a film reporter. But, ironically, it?s chatting up the common man on screen, a Paresh Rawal or a Naseeruddin Shah, that more often than not remains an elusive dream.

 They, unlike the Khans and Bachchans, are not really bothered about publicity. They are not even keen to share nuggets of their illustrious careers or the tricks of their masterful trade with strangers.

 So, you thank your stars ? the celestial ones this time ? when these gods of acting are requested by producers to promote their films. That, kind of, forces them to speak to reporters, albeit reluctantly. The window of opportunity is opened, to somehow make the legends talk, talk beyond that forthcoming release, and draw them out of their shell.

 He hadn?t opened his mouth about Hulchul or Garam Masala or Deewane Huye Pagaal, despite repeated requests. So, when Paresh Rawal did agree to talk about Malamaal Weekly, it was a big surprise and a welcome one at that.

 But then again, Malamaal Weekly is the first commercial Bollywood release with him in the lead role, long after Ketan Mehta made him Sardar.

 A time was set up and the call was made on his cell phone. Bryan Adams?s Heaven was the caller tone and just when one was resigned to hearing out the whole song, someone took the call. ?Can I please speak to Mr Paresh Rawal?? ?Sir to bahaar gaye hain, aap kaun?? The voice on the other side was uncannily similar to Hera Pheri?s Baburao Apte. The voice resurfaced again: ?Aap baad mein phone karo, Sir shaam tak aa jayenge??

 Maybe he didn?t wish to talk. Maybe he was in the mood to play a prank (?Babu bolchhen babu bari nei...?). Or maybe he had just based Baburao on his manager/secretary and hence the strange similarity.

 Whatever it was, the chance of talking to Paresh Rawal the actor seemed as dead as the phone line. Not until another movie, not until meeting him in person at some media conference.

 Anyway, shaam ko the call was made again and Bryan sang again. Only this time, he led to someone who did claim to be Paresh Rawal. Heaven, any one? Forget it.

 Serious, point blank and sometimes annoyingly monosyllabic, the man seemed lightyears away from the screen avatar who could even make the Mummy crack up.

 But with time ? the conversation lasted for 15 minutes at the most ? he did begin to sound a little like the man we love on screen.

 ?The reason Priyan and I work so well together is because we trust in each other and there?s a rapport going,? said Paresh, justifying his superlative performances in every Priyadarshan film ? Hera Pheri, Hungama, Hulchul, Garam Masala. ?Also, his choice of stories is very good and he has a great grasp over the comic elements in his movies.?

 But wouldn?t such comic films be left at the storyboard some years back? ?Yes, comedy as a genre has improved in this country,? Paresh agreed. ?You have films like No Entry doing so well. People have realised that humour should have wisdom, some deep insight. Only then does it work. Also, the overall scenario has improved. Bound scripts are floating around. New directors are coming up. A corporate discipline is coming in.?

 What has also happened is that Paresh is longer just a comic addition to an insipid movie. ?I still don?t consider myself to be a hero,? he admitted. ?If I am able to give 100 per cent to a project, then I feel I am a hero. But I can never be the hero who gets the girl. I think, in some films I am good and in some I am atrocious. It all depends on the director, I can?t take any credit or discredit.?

 But he didn?t mind going ga-ga over the new Priyadarshan film. ?Malamaal Weekly is a lovely comedy,? Paresh declared. ?It is a fantastically shot film set in a village. It is really mindboggling with some very tight characterisations. The film is a very human drama about how far money can take people. It is not only comedy, it has everything.?

 And it also has Om Puri. ?I admit we had a great competition on the sets as to who is better but let me tell you it is sheer joy to work with him,? Paresh quipped. ?With Omji around everything changes, there?s so much of dedication. Apart from being a great actor he is a fantastic human being. His body of work is so very wide. Compared to him and Naseer bhai, I am nothing.?

 But isn?t he more popular than the other two who have never really got a strong foothold in the commercial movie industry? ?My films may have been popular but as an actor I have a long way to go to reach their calibre,? felt Paresh.

 His popularity has given him a lot of work for sure, with Paresh slated to appear in films like 36 China Town, Chup Chup Ke and Phir Hera Pheri. ?Working on the sequel was very nostalgic for me,? Paresh revealed about Neeraj Vora?s follow-up to the Priyadarshan hit co-starring Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty. ?But we had to meet the high levels of expectations around the second part, to be able to reach the cult status that the first film was able to achieve.?

 Movies may have made him a familiar face in many a home but it is on stage that Paresh feels most at home. ?Well, I am the king over there. I can experiment with my roles and dialogues. And more than anything else, theatre is me, that?s where my entire life is. That is where I come from.?

 Before the line went cold again, one was tempted to ask him if he had answered the morning call. But then again, if Paresh Rawal isn?t entitled to some hera pheri, who is?

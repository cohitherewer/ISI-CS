 Is peeling the impossibly

 in a New Zealand neighbourhood, wonders Adrita Mukherjee 

 NON-RESIDENT 

 / Calcuttan

 An exciting thing has happened 

 in our para in Wellington. Im not talking 

 about the area near Hind Cinema in Calcutta where the Bhutias 

 set up temporary shops selling woollens every winter, but 

 a small city that happens to be the capital of an island 

 country at the other end of the globe. 

 When we rented a flat in this 

 quiet suburb almost four years ago, we did not have a single 

 Bengali neighbour. But over the past year or so, Bengalis 

 have surged in, and now we are one big happy family. Addas 

 in the true Bengali tradition have become frequent. 

 One such evening, when the famous 

 Wellington wind was howling outside, about 10 of us crowded 

 in front of the heater in my lounge, sipping tea and munching 

 muri and telebhaja. 

 Someone said she had just ordered 

 a dinner from a Chinese restaurant on the Internet for her 

 parents in Calcutta. Someone else who was going home was 

 suitably envied and advised to try out the new hot 

 spots in Calcutta. 

 Then someone mentioned The 

 Da Vinci Code and talk veered round to movies. I asked 

 what they thought about the book. It was then that a friend 

 of mine made the remark. I havent read it, 

 he said. Heavens, whos got the time to read 

 books?

 It was later that night, when 

 I was just about to fall asleep, that the remark came back 

 to haunt me in a curious way. The printed word had always 

 fascinated me. 

 In my childhood, I was scolded 

 frequently for taking a book to the dinner table, a habit, 

 I confess, I havent been able to get rid of. 

 I have always had a little pile 

 of books that looks solid and reassuring on my bedside table. 

 Maybe Id never consciously thought about my love of 

 books because my family and close friends shared this passion. 

 But here I am today, friends with someone who says that 

 he never has time to read! 

 It was a disquieting thought 

 not in itself, but because it triggered off a series of 

 questions. I knew that all of ones friends cant 

 possibly share the same interests; that friendships develop 

 between the most unlikely people but now I found myself 

 asking: how much, indeed, do I have in common with my prabasi 

 friends? 

 They are nice people, but was 

 that the sole reason we were friends? Would it have been 

 enough to bring us together if we were still living in India? 

 What kind of things do we share 

 among us? The whereabouts of the young Indian electrician 

 who doubles as a barber and comes over to your house to 

 do a haircut for half the price of any barber shop. The 

 information that frozen chingri is going absurdly 

 cheap at our fishmongers. That theres going 

 to be a special screening of Paheli in the city. 

 That the only way to peel the impossibly tough Kiwi pumpkin 

 is to microwave it first. 

 l this, and memories of the Film 

 Festival, Book Fair, rui machher jhol and langra 

 aam. 

 In fact, we share a common immigrant 

 identity and nostalgic memories of home and very little 

 else.

 And yet we are good friends. We 

 look forward to our parties. Our children enjoy playing 

 together. We look to each other for companionship, advice 

 and help. 

 We live in a strange world a 

 home thats not home and each of us provides a connection 

 for the rest to a common past. A connection that keeps our 

 friendship going.

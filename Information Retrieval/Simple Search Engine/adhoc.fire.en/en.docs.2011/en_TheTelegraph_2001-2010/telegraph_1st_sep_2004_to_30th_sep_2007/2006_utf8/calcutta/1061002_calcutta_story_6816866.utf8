The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Third eye boon for police

 A STAFF REPORTER

 LET THERE BE LIGHT: Lamps lit up to mark Sandhi puja, an integral part of Mahashtami rituals, at the Daw household in north Calcutta. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta 

 Time: 1.30 am, Ashtami.

 Place: Lalbazar Traffic Control Room.

 Officers, their eyes glued to the computer screens, are busy monitoring crowd movement and traffic chaos in and around major pandals across the city.

 Any hint of a snarl or pile-up, they are promptly sending instructions to cops posted near the pandals to clear the bottleneck.

 It has been a puja with a difference for the cops, thanks to the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in most major pandals.

 A brainchild of police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, the cameras, linked with the computers in the control room, have enabled cops to keep a close eye on crowd behaviour, traffic movement and security from the headquarters.

 Earlier, we used to depend on policemen deployed near the pandals. But now, we can see everything on the monitor, an officer said.

 We are happy with the arrangement. The feed from the CCTVs is being recorded round-the-clock. It will help us spot anyone involved in criminal activities in or around the pandals and intervene immediately, said police commissioner Mukherjee.

 The pujas under the closed-circuit or third eye scanner are Santosh Mitra Square, College Square, Mohammad Ali Park, Ekdalia Evergreen, Badamtala, Mudiali, Park Circus and Telenga Bagan. Besides, hidden cameras are installed in some pandals and are being monitored by policemen and private guards deployed there. This will help us zero in on eve-teasers and snatchers in the pandals, said an officer.

 Considering the threat perception following the serial train blasts in Mumbai and the ones in Malegaon, the third eye has come as a blessing for cops during the Puja, when thousands of people throng the roads leading to the major pandals.

 It has also been of great help in regulating traffic. If we spot a sudden crowd crush, we immediately direct our officers to divert vehicles. We can also monitor the traffic volume and act accordingly, the officer said.

 Another officer in the control room added: Occasional snags in the cameras notwithstanding, this Puja has been less hectic for us. We are being able to keep our men on the road under constant surveillance. They are doing a great job, as they know they are being watched.

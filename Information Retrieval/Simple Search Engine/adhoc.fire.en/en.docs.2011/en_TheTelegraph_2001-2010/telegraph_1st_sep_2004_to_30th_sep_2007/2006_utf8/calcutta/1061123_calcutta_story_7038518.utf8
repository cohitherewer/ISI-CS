ABHISHEK BACHCHAN

 Did you expect Dhoom to 

 be such a blockbuster?

 We actors expect all our films to be blockbusters because we put that kind of effort into them. We knew we had something unique and simple (with Dhoom). We then worked towards making the best possible film that we could make and thankfully the audiences appreciated our efforts.

 Dhoom 2 will be your 

 first sequel. Did you have to reprise your mannerisms and 

 attitude from the first role?

 Actually, my first sequel was Lage Raho Munnabhai (laughs), where I played a very prominent role! Seriously speaking, being a sequel Dhoom 2 was that much more easy, because you know the character, you know what the character can do and cannot do. We just got to tweak Jai Dixit a bit but we didnt have to establish his character. He is slightly more relaxed and thats reflective in the way he dresses and in his general attitude. Id like to believe hes a bit more cool in this film.

 How different or similar is 

 Dhoom 2 from Dhoom?

 Its the same genre but its a different film. Id like to believe its a bigger and better film. What I really like about Dhoom 2 is that its not about fast bikes and thieves; its more than that. And at first I remember questioning Adi (Aditya Chopra) and Sanjay (Gadhvi) saying that it should have more of what the original had. Adi had a very good answer that if you give them the same thing again, they are going to get bored of it. In that sense it is its own movie, but it is the same genre.

 You have Hrithik and Aishwarya 

 as your adversaries this time. What do they bring to the 

 Dhoom board?

 They bring a whole different dimension. They bring a whole lot more viewers, wed like to believe. Weve been very selfish, Uday and me Weve hired bigger stars so that more people come to watch the movie (laughs).

 In the recent past you have 

 conned people on screen. In the Dhoom films you are 

 the cop. Which is tougher?

 The endeavour is to do challenging work and to push yourself to do work that you have not done in the past. If its not challenging, its not going to be fun and youre not going to enjoy what you are doing and if you are not enjoying what you are doing, then you are going to be dishonest to your profession, which is sacrilege for us.

 The challenge in Dhoom 2 was to make Jai Dixit much more interesting. Yes, hes the same character and having kept the same foundation how do you make him more interesting this time round? How do you retain the audiences attention in him?

 How did you like the music 

 of Dhoom 2 as compared to Dhoom?

 I think the music of Dhoom 2 is weaker than Dhoom Thats because I only have one song in this film and in another song I am standing by the bar (laughs). I am convinced that I could have out-danced Aishwarya, Hrithik Roshan and Bipasha! Uday toh baye haath ka khel hai. In Dhoom I had three songs. I think its very unfair (laughs).

 Did you feel you were in competition 

 with Hrithik while shooting the film?

 No not at all. Ive never been a person who believes in competition. I would like to believe Hrithik is more of an inspiration for me. He makes me work harder, he makes me a better actor and he makes me want to do my best. I was very lucky because every actor from Hrithik to Uday to Aishwarya to Bipasha is a very close friend of mine. It was just great to be with all my friends.

AISHWARYA RAI

 Did you watch Dhoom?

 Thats evident, because at that point it was definitely a cluster breaker. The identity is youth but it became a family experience and everyone came away with an adrenaline rush. And everybody has been there, done that or has aspired to be there, do that and have all these experiences in person. If not, cinema is the perfect dream world, the closest thing to experiencing any moment in person. So it was good that Dhoom was well embraced.

 You do solo-heroine films. 

 What made you pick Dhoom 2?

 Adi knew what he was doing when he came up with this idea of Dhoom 2. When approached with the idea, I thought it was brilliant. We were all very, very happy to be in the team. Its really funny, how 20,000 ideas fly around within the team about the next Dhoom. So, it is obviously a very clever franchise. At the end of the day its a fab experience for the team as well as for the audiences. 

 What was the rationale behind 

 taking on this role with negative shades?

 Firstly, all the talk on a lot of aspects of Dhoom 2, including my character in the film, are assumptions. Thats fine, because it definitely keeps the curiosity peaking and the audience out there wondering. I am wondering whether I should shed more light or let the audience go discover for themselves in the theatres. I will not define my character as negative or positive for that matter because Sunehris a livewire in the film. It will take you a while to even figure her out. She completely throws you.

 It was definitely exciting for me to discover and deliver Sunehri. In a single moment shes hero-worshipping Mr A (Hrithik), in the next second shes turning on an attitude and challenging him. It felt very important in creating her in terms of content apart from the visual impact. That is something we all definitely focused on.

 What kind of special preparations 

 did you personally do for that visual impact?

 Here, it zeroed in on the physical appearance in terms of fitness, and it was a body language and a body type that I hadnt brought to celluloid before. And since I was going to dress a certain way, I needed to just be the person who wore those clothes very naturally. I am glad that it has turned out exciting, but that wasnt the reason for the costume.

 The clothing feels like me, it feels natural even if it means seeing me for the first time in the western mould. It doesnt seem uncomfortable and thats something (stylist) Anaita knows about me. We decided that we would go with a different hand in terms of make-up and hair styling because that again would bring a newness on board.

 You are in the middle of a 

 lot of releases. Does this different look make Dhoom 

 2 stand out for you?

 Fortunately or coincidentally I am having so many different releases Umrao Jaan, Dhoom 2 and Guru, and then theres Provoked and The Last Legion. Its great that not only visually we have arrived at a specific character, but also in terms of her mannerisms. Her personality is very, very specific and can be identified as someone who belongs solely to this film.

 How was it, working with the 

 Team D:2?

 Superlative! It really has been fantastic. I think, the fact that the three of them Hrithik, Abhishek and Uday have known each other since childhood, they constantly share their anecdotes, that just made you feel that you belong to those bunch of kids who went to those birthday parties, or hung out in their schooling years. 

 The brief moments that I got to share with Bipasha, I must say shes a real cool girl, and I am glad we are a team in this film. My pairing with Hrithik, like he himself was saying, its great that he also had eased up a lot. We had a world tour and a commercial together and, I guess, both of us had been psyched by perception about being extremely professional, being very detailed, almost obsessive about our work. Each of us had been told that about the other, but when we have worked together, I can safely say that I think thats a given.

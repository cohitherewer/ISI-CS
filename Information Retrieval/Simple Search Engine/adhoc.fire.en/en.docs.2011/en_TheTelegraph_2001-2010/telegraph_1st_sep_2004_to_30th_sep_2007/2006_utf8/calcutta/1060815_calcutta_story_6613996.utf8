 I wouldnt mind living on and 

 on I am filled with curiosity and long to know, what next?

 Isaiah Berlin

 It is their passion for theatre 

 and yearning for knowledge that Tanaji Dasgupta and Soumyak 

 Kanti De Biswas want to reflect in the works of their fledgling 

 production company Tin Can. When Soumyak says we are not 

 here to save the world, the message is clear. Tin Can is 

 a message in itself.

 The theatrical journey for the 

 two film fanatics, as they describe themselves, started 

 when they presented Jungle Book when they were in 

 St Xaviers Collegiate School. Tanaji, a Nritya Kalabid 

 in Bharatanatyam, was the main performer and Soumyak, an 

 elocutionist, gave the voice-over. Soumyak now studies English 

 literature in Jadavpur University, while Tanaji is pursuing 

 a course in mass communication and videography in St Xaviers 

 College.

 The 20-year-olds have earlier 

 worked with names like Jayant Kripalani in a workshop by 

 Seagull Foundation of Arts. In 2004, they attended the British 

 Council workshop Silk Route. After working with production 

 houses like The Red Curtain, Theatricians, Ranan, India 

 Foundation for the Arts, Spotlight and Prithvi Theatre Festival 

 in Mumbai, they decided to come up with Tin Can.

 To the rest of the world Tin Can 

 may seem to be a very lackadaisical approach towards conventional 

 theatre, but to the duo, it is their core belief in simple 

 interpretation of the everyday culture with no specific 

 barometers.

 There are about 25 members who 

 are working hard to shape up Tin Cans first production 

 Intro, which will be staged sometime in September. 

 Intro is talking about 

 the city. Everything that we see around us belongs to the 

 city we live in. Our lives start with the city and it is 

 here where we grew up, says Tanaji. 

 But if Tanaji and Soumyak are 

 the heart and soul of the production house, Mrinalini Sen 

 is indispensable to Intro. Mrinalini, 19, knew the 

 Tin Can duo since childhood. I have always been interested 

 in theatre. Tin Can gave me the opportunity to work in a 

 project that is quite different, she says.

 Tin Can is readying itself to 

 bloom at the Birkmyre Hostel where the team is rehearsing. 

 Besides the Tin Can project, the 

 boys are working on two short films. The Jugantar Project, 

 already in its formative stage, is something that is close 

 to their hearts. The film will reflect the means that were 

 used to shelve one of the leading newspapers of the 70s.

 Life is a kaleidoscope where things 

 change every moment and with every phase there are new things 

 to learn. The Tin Can team is readying to begin its journey 

 with the same ideology.

 Whats on your mind this week

 Foolish feat

 Three educated youngsters recently 

 breaching the Prime Ministers security net was shocking. 

 It was even more unbelievable when they later said they 

 had just wanted to shake hands with the PM. I wonder what 

 treatment they were expecting? A dinner invitation? But 

 despite all this, I still think that the law enforcers were 

 too harsh on them. After all, they are not criminal but 

 just foolish.

 Strike rate

 In the past two years the number 

 of students strikes has increased alarmingly. There was 

 the JU protest rally, then the medical students strike 

 and the hunger strike by Presidency College students. It 

 is appreciable that students are making good use of the 

 freedom of expression. But somehow strikes are occurring 

 too frequently for trivial causes. Moreover, the methods 

 of showing discontent have become very violent. Whether 

 the trend is for better or worse needs to be seen.

 Poetry pick

 The poem Loss published on August 

 1 in My Diary was taken from Blood and Sand, written by 

 me and Paushali Bhattacharya when we were in Calcutta Girls 

 High School and published in the 2001 issue of the school 

 magazine. But this was not acknowledged. Since poetry is 

 an intense, original, spontaneous creation, such an act 

 needs to be discouraged.

 Chit Chat

 Mini mahatma: This toddler, 

 in the guise of the Mahatma, seems deep in thought on 

 the eve of Independence Day. Children of Joyland nursery

 Monsoon melody

 DPS Newtown organised Geet Mallhar, 

 an inter-house vocal music competition, on July 14 to celebrate 

 the monsoon. Conducted by Ganga House, the theme of the 

 contest was Varsha (rain). While the participants in the 

 solo category had to choose a Rabindrasangeet on the monsoon, 

 the group contestants could sing Hindi songs embodying the 

 essence of the season.

 Music artiste Shanta Halder judged 

 the event. The students of classes IV to VIII enthralled 

 the audience with their performances. These budding talents 

 hold tremendous potential and the school is doing a commendable 

 job in honing their skills, said Halder. Ganga House emerged 

 the overall winner at the meet.

 Skits and songs

 Don Bosco School Bandel on July 

 29 hosted its interhouse competitions. First up were skits 

 on social themes. Blue House, the winner, came up with a 

 take on the film Black. Yellow House depicted how 

 humans were becoming like robots. Red House showed how a 

 middle-class family helped a needy person. Green House stood 

 first in the musical contest that followed.

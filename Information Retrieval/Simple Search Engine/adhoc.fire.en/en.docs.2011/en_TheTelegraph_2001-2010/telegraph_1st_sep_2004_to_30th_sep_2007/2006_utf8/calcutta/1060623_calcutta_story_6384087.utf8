 Business basics for techies

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 Webel, the state government?s nodal information technology (IT) agency, is planning a foray into management and computer education. 

 ?Webel has been gradually changing its focus. It is well known that the state requires a massive number of cross-functional managers and software engineers. We have been planning to enter the education sector for a while and are exploring several options,? said Webel managing director and CEO Debanjan Datta. 

 The agency plans to start a one-year general management programme for IT professionals, aimed at meeting the diverse industry requirements. It hopes to launch the programme within the next three months. The cost outlay for the project is estimated to be about Rs 16 crore. 

 The students will have to specialise in disciplines such as marketing, finance or human resources. 

 The programme will also cover technologies such as enterprise resource planning and data warehousing.

 ?There is a requirement for both functional as well as technical managers in the IT industry. Our programme is not exclusively for the techies. Any graduate working in the IT industry can join the course,? explained Datta.

 ?The programme will impart soft skills to the candidates as we feel that in today?s business environment, there is a need for well-rounded professionals rather than just technologically-proficient ones. We want to make the course as broad-based as possible,? he added.

 Webel has been in talks with a number of colleges and technology institutes to use their infrastructure to conduct the course. 

 Datta said the framework for the programme was ready and the necessary approvals had been obtained. 

 The faculty will be sourced from technology and management institutes as well as the industry.

 Webel also has plans to develop properties on its own and in partnership with private companies.

 ?There has to be a constant build-up of infrastructure to bring in new players. We plan on focussing on corporate players that have do not have a presence in the state,? stressed Datta.

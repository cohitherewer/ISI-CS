 She came, she saw, she shopped. Meet Bebo the buyer.

 In town for precisely 25 hours to launch Shobha Asars jewellery exhibition, Kareena Kapoor took out two of those for a trip to 85 Lansdowne on Wednesday. She browsed through some of Indias best designer labels before buying a bagful of Anamika Khanna and Shantanu Goenka.

 The 4 pm to 6 pm shopping spree was carried out behind locked doors, as the Lansdowne designer destination had shut shop on Bebos request.

 A long, leisurely and peaceful tour later (with only a security guard from her entourage), Kareenas shopping loot read five or six outfits from Anamika, plus two outfits and a bag from Shantanu. And while she was at it, Bebo couldnt resist some aamchi Mumbai flavour, packing in sandals by Mumbai-based label Stoffa.

 At the end of it all, the Bollywood style icon simply said: I think you should open in Mumbai, too.

 A spokesperson for the fashion address added: She told us that unlike Mumbai and Delhi, the look here is very international.

 So, what kind of a rack raider is Kareena? She is a very confident shopper who knows exactly what she wants. She simply put her hand on whatever she liked, said an official from 85 Lansdowne.

 Agreed Anamika, who was present during the stars marketing marathon: I was quite impressed with her sense of style. She was completely into casual mode and was picking up mostly Western silhouettes.

 The result: lots of jackets and some tunics, but also an ethnic lehnga (which, Anamika said, Kareena would like to style in a Western manner). The pieces were mostly muted tones, some from my fall-winter collection and some from next years spring-summer, said the designer.

 Kareena chose ensembles and accessories from Shantanus Elizabeth Collection. A moss-green digitally printed salwar kameez, a beige-rose pink apron with crocheted flowers, and a Victorian-style printed double-clutch bag embellished with applique, stones and Swarovski.

 She looked phenomenal in both outfits. The vintage colour palette stood out against her flawless radiant skin, smiled Shantanu, who made up for his absence at 85 Lansdowne on Wednesday by dropping in at her Taj Bengal suite for fittings the day afternoon.

 The apron needs an inner and the empire-line green kurta needs to be loosened, both of which we will courier her. Shes between a small and medium size and her frame is perfect for our feminine silhouettes, added Shantanu.

 After energy-sapping photo sessions and endless queries on romancing Shahid and seducing Shah Rukh (in Don), Kareena confessed before leaving town: I am so tired.

 But not of the shopping sojourn, surely.

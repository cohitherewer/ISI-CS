 Remains of the days: 

 Puja flowers dumped in the Corporations enclosure being 

 removed at Babughat 

 The recent survey by the Institute 

 of Child Health that found 25 per cent of the citys school 

 children are forced to breathe foul fumes will come as a 

 shock to many parents (Car fumes choking children, September 

 11). Inhalation of car exhaust causes asthma in youngsters. 

 While the paediatricians are pointing an accusing finger at the rising pollution levels for increase in asthma cases among children, the authorities have all but shrugged off responsibility. The doctors have also pointed out that asthma among children is extremely difficult to cure, again eliciting no reaction from the government. 

 There is little that the parents can do except take their wards to a place with lower pollution level. But that is not possible in most cases. 

 The chief minister might cry himself hoarse propounding his do it now philosophy, but his colleagues seem more interested in talking than taking constructive steps about anything. Their apathy towards work is never more apparent than when they are called upon to do something to curb the pollution level in one of the most polluted cities in India. 

 Thanks to the government inaction, a large chunk of the city residents have been afflicted with diseases caused by pollutants. The government decision to go on the backfoot on the issue of introduction of green fuel such as CNG and LPG in the city is inexplicable and very costly.

 Apropos the report Puja clean-up diktat, September 8, it is encouraging that the state pollution control board has ruled that the Hooghly must be cleaned within a day of the immersions. Every year, many waterbodies are severely polluted due to immersion of idols. Measures have not been taken against the practice. The setting up of cages near the ghats to dump garbage is praiseworthy. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 The firm stand taken by the pollution 

 control board regarding pollution of waterbodies due to 

 immersions is laudable. The dumping of used flowers and 

 other waste on riverbanks and surrounding areas must be 

 stopped. Paucity of funds should not be a problem since 

 the civic body will realise a fee for this from the puja 

 organisers. Those who award prizes to the best pujas should 

 stress on protection of environment. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

 Behala 

 The pollution control board deserves 

 kudos for acting against water pollution. Immersing idols 

 in rivers poisons the water, which is eventually going to 

 affect all of us. The puja organisers should adhere to the 

 boards norms to make the festival truly enjoyable.

 It gave me great pleasure to know that the riverbank in the city and Howrah will be beautified with trees and flowering plants (Green touch for riverfront, September 4). The high court should order the demolition of closed godowns, factories, cowsheds and unauthorised business establishments on the banks.

 Having lived in Shyambazar, I have seen the struggle of the Kumartuli artisans to protect the clay idols of the goddess and her family from rain (Site selected for idol hub, September 5). It gives me immense pleasure to know that the artisans will be shifted to a five-acre plot on Rabindra Sarani. Once the artisans move to their new settlement, they will hopefully be spared the pain of wrapping the idols in plastic sheets every time it rains. The settlement should be named Mritshilpanagar.

 Apropos the report Cloud on Kalighat temple revamp, September 12, it is unfortunate that a group of racketeers is holding up the development of Kalighat temple. The state government should immediately overthrow the governing body of the temple and elect a new committee. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Apropos the report Hall of fame and flux, September 12, it is ridiculous that those in charge of preserving the citys heritage cant figure out a way to utilise the 192-year-old Town Hall, 13 years after its renovation.

 Apropos the report Fight fuels estate feud, September 13, the fracas between the residents of Animikha housing estate was resolved in the presence of inspector-in-charge of Rajarhat police station. But the dispute over the right to use, control and manage the main entrance and the guards room is pending before court. The developer has handed over its key to co-operative society of the A amp;B block residents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 And the Oscar goes to...

 Which Indian film would have won an Academy Award? Two days of frenetic SMS voting from our readers later, the top honours went to Sholay, of course

 Ram Gopal Varma should be a happy man. As he starts shooting his Sholay from Wednesday, the original ldquo;Western curry made in India rdquo; continues to be the most popular film around. Around 35 per cent of the people voting in felt that Ramesh Sippy rsquo;s 1975 blockbuster should have won an Oscar. No film was sent from India that year as an official entry. Akira Kurosawa rsquo;s Dersu Uzala won the Best Foreign Film Oscar that year edging past Andrzej Wajda rsquo;s Polish film Land of Promise

 Around 25 per cent votes went to Aditya Chopra rsquo;s glittering directorial debut Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Interestingly, the Kamal Haasan-starrer Kurudhi Punal, directed by ace cinematographer PC Sreeram, was sent to the Oscars in 1995, the year DDLJ arrived at the theatres. At the Academy Awards, a Dutch film Antonia rsquo;s Line triumphed in the Best Foreign Film category ahead of Giuseppe Tornatore rsquo;s Italian favourite The Star Maker

 Fourteen per cent of the people voting in felt that K. Asif rsquo;s grand spectacle Mughal-e-Azam should have clinched the golden statuette. But no Indian film was sent to the Oscars in 1960, three years after Mother India had made it to the final five. Ingmar Bergman rsquo;s The Virgin Spring won the 

 Foreign Film honours that year

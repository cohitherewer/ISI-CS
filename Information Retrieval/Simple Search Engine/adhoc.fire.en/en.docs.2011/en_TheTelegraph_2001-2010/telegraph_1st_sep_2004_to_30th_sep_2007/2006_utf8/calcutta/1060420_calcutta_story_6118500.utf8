The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Setu?s privileged 500

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 No less than 500 VIPs will be allowed to cross Vidyasagar Setu without paying the toll. They will be provided with smart cards, permitting an unlimited number of free trips across the bridge.

 The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) handed over the operation of the toll plaza on Vidyasagar Setu to SMSL-IRD on April 1, 2006, against an annual payment of Rs 20.07 crore.

 From Day One, the private operator has not allowed a single vehicle to cross the bridge without paying the toll, much to the chagrin of a section of government officers.

 ?We have decided to buy 500 smart cards from the toll plaza operator for the use of VIPs and other dignitaries. A list of the people entitled to the cards free has been drawn up,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro on Wednesday.

 Apart from the 500 smart cards, he added, about 1,000 passes would be provided to vehicles owned by the state, police, fire brigade and other vehicles on government duty.

 The toll operator would allow these vehicles to pass without paying the toll. A bill would be submitted to the government at the end of every month.

 Earlier, thousands of ?VIP? cars would cross the bridge without paying the fixed fee. A large number of vehicles would allegedly evade the toll by greasing the palms of HRBC employees and policemen on the spot. This led to revenue losses to the tune of Rs 100 crore.

 Now, if a dignitary outside the designated list of 500 is required to cross the bridge without paying up, the department arranging his trip will first have to collect a pass from the transport department.

 For vehicles hired by the government departments, the rent-a-car agency will have to pick up the Setu tab. The department concerned would later reimburse the agency.

 Government officials without a pass must pay the toll on the Setu and later claim reimbursement.

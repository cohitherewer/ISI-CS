The report Buddha wields broom, August 23, with 

a photograph of the chief minister holding a broom, indicated that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

wants Calcutta to be as clean and beautiful as other Southeast Asian cities like 

Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Bhattacharjee has certainly done his best 

to attract investment for building flyovers, shopping malls, multiplexes and car 

parks. But do we really need so many malls and multiplexes when a large percentage 

of the population is poor and cannot afford to buy film tickets that cost Rs 150 

each and clothes available at malls? 

 Instead of trying to develop the city in this manner, the chief minister would do well visit parts of his constituency, particularly Mukundapur, where he had inaugurated an international heart hospital in 2000 and Armenian church trauma centre in 2005. Outside the hospital are clusters of guest houses where patients and their relatives from Bangladesh, the Northeast, north Bengal and other parts of the country come and stay before and after surgery. 

 Needless to say that such patients should live in a clean environment to avoid infection. But the area lacks even a drainage system and the vat in front of the guest houses overflows with garbage. An open urinal adds to the hygiene problems. The local councillor should look into the matter if the chief minister is too busy for that.

Apropos the report And now, Chappell is asura, 

August 28, it is nothing but craziness and blind faith on the part of puja organisers 

to depict Greg Chappell as Mahishasura. The organisers should stop this kind of 

nuisance since it spoils the ambience of the puja, makes a mockery of a solemn 

occasion and hurts religious sentiments.

The Calcutta Municipal Corporations decision to double the rates of levy for holding pujas in civic parks and by encroaching roads will put an additional burden on the organisers (Civic body doubles levy, August 25). The charges for putting up stalls have also been raised. The decision should have been taken after consulting the parties concerned. It has been stated that 40 per cent of the tax is not realised. If stringent measures are taken to collect this amount, the additional burden can be reduced to an extent. A portion of the tax can also be realised in advance.

Apropos the report Revised rule for LPG refill, 

September 6, deputy general manager of Indian Oil Corporation S.C. Dey has been 

quoted as saying that one cooking gas cylinder is enough for a family of four 

to five for 20 to 25 days. But what will happen to a family like ours where there 

are eight members and a cylinder is exhausted in 17 to 18 days? Does it mean that 

we have to go without food for more than four to five days before we can even 

book our next cylinder? Otherwise, we will have to apply in writing for an emergency 

cylinder every month, which is also not feasible.

 The practice of diverting domestic cooking gas cylinders 

to commercial establishments might be curbed by making the two in different shapes. 

Perhaps, they could be of different colours, too, so that they can be easily distinguished.

Apropos the report Local aid for free school, September 2, it is wonderful to learn that some businessmen have donated a generous sum to a free high school. Government apathy in this regard is unfortunate. The state education department has often failed to spend adequately for the upkeep and infrastructure development of schools.

Due to the failure of the underground drainage system, after every heavy shower the city roads get flooded (Roads, ravaged and recent, August 29). The water makes the surface soft and washes away the asphalt creating potholes. Calcuttas population has increased manifold since the British era when the underground drainage system was built. But only some patchwork has been done to the network since then.

 Apropos the report Litter box glitter for city, September 2, it is laudable on the part of the civic authorities to launch a clean Calcutta campaign by installing litter bins in the central business district and on important arteries. All First World cities have strategically placed garbage collection bins to maintain cleanliness. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is on the right track.

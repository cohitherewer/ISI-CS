 Motive: Brawl and spurned advances 

 - Triple murders across city, suburbs

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Twenty-two-year-old Sambhu Makal?s body was found in a pool of blood in a playground in Sultanpur, under Jagachha police station, in Howrah, on Tuesday. 

 The driver, who married in May 2005, had started the day on a festive note by playing Holi with wife Urmila and some neighbours at their Harekrishna Nagar home, in Nazirgunge, Sankrail. 

 ?Sambhu joined his friends at a neighbourhood bar later. At the bar, he had an altercation with three local youths. The men soon came to blows. After some time, Sambhu ran out, followed by the youths,? said an officer of Jagachha police station.

 Preliminary investigation has revealed that Sambhu was resting in the playground when the three caught up with him.

 ?Witnesses told us that the three men attacked Sambhu with both sharp and blunt weapons. No one came to his rescue. After the youths left, the bystanders took him to Howrah State General Hospital, where he was declared dead,? the officer added.

 District superintendent of police Akhil Roy refused to divulge the names of the assassins. ?We have identified the three men but cannot name them yet for the sake of investigation,? Roy said.

 Woman death

 The body of Mina Khatun, 28, was fished out of a well at Bandipur, in Rahara, under Khardah police station, on the northern fringes of the city. 

 Khatun was missing since March 7 and was last seen at the local factory where she worked. According to North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar, a murder case has been started on the basis of a complaint by Khatun?s family members. 

 ?Khatun?s father told the cops that some local youths were involved in the death of his daughter. We are trying to find the motive behind the murder,? Kumar said.

 Aftaruddin Mondal, Khatun?s father, alleged that a spurned lover had planned and executed the murder. ?Each time he proposed to her, she refused. On March 7, the youth telephoned her. He called her to the factory. She did not return home after that,? Mondal said.

 Body in bag

 The body of an unidentified woman was found in a jute bag in Salt Lake behind Bidhannagar Sub-Divisional Hospital, on Tuesday. The bag was placed next to a garbage vat. 

 The woman, in her early 20s, was clad in a blue salwar-kameez. ?The woman might have been strangled with her dupatta. After initial investigation, it seems she was killed elsewhere before being dumped on the spot,? said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.

 Waiver bait for illegal buildings

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The civic authorities are introducing a waiver of penalty so owners of illegal buildings can regularise their property in Bansdroni, Garia, Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. The regularisation will be allowed up to two storeys.

 The owners will get three months, from July to September, to regularise illegal residential structures by paying a sanction fee at Rs 35 per sq ft. For commercial buildings, the rate is Rs 120 per sq ft.

 The initial plan was to introduce the scheme across the city. But the mayoral council on Monday decided to first have an experimental run in 42 wards (100-141), all added areas merged with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in 1984. Judging by the success, the authorities will decide on introducing the waiver scheme in the other wards. 

 Asked why the added areas were chosen for the introductory run, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: ?There was no proper verification of building records when the wards were merged with the civic body. Besides, most of the colonies are located there. It?s likely that these wards will have a higher concentration of illegal structures.?

 According to him, stringent penalty provisions are deterring owners from regularising the illegal structures. The revenue loss because of illegal constructions over the past 20 years has been Rs 700 crore.

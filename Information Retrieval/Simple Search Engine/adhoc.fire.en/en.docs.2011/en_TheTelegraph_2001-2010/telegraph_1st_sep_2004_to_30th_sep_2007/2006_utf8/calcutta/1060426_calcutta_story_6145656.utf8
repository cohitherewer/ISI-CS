 Blaze in godown claims two

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A man and a woman died on Tuesday afternoon of burns received in Monday night?s fire at an unauthorised lubricants godown at Raipur, near Regent Park. 

 Five others, including two children, were injured in the blaze. They are being treated at MR Bangur Hospital.

 The deceased were identified as Shiekh Yaqub Ali, 56, and Sahezadi Mondal, 76.

 The godown was located in the house of Moslem Ali Mondal. Sahezadi was Moslem?s mother, while Yaqub was a relative, police said. The house was partially damaged in the fire. Moslem is one of the injured admitted to the hospital. 

 ?He was selling lubricants for a long time without a licence. He never bothered to take precautionary measures,? complained a neighbour. 

 The fire broke out around 10.30 pm after the family had gone to bed. Neighbour Jatan Sheikh first noticed the flames.

 He immediately raised an alarm. By then, a portion of the house was engulfed in the fire. Moslem and his family members sustained injuries while making their way out of the house.

 The local residents started to douse the flames with buckets of water from a reservoir. Three fire tenders arrived soon after. 

 ?Had Moslem not woken up, all the family members would have been killed. If the fire had spread, the consequences would have been disastrous as the area is congested,? said Jatan. 

 The fire-fighters took an hour to bring the blaze under control.

 When one evening in 1956, a Howrah youth who gave daily koutuk shows for a living, presented a nirbak koutuk as a special prelude he didnt realise he was doing anything new. Instead of the usual comic repartee, he just used his body to depict different kinds of couples gathered by a lake. Only later did he learn that what he had done was something akin to what all Europe was raging about Jogesh Dutta had just stumbled upon mime.

 Fifty years later, what does Dutta, the pioneer, feel about the future of Indian mime? Is it true that the art form having failed to hold attention is on its way out? Celebrating the golden jubilee of his career with a series of solo mime shows at Rabindra Sadan on October 27, Dutta feels that the students of Padaboli (his mime academy in Kalighat) are proof enough of the universal appeal of this art of silence. 

 For our four-year course we have many students coming not only from different corners of India but Bangladesh, Nepal and Switzerland as well. However, only a maximum of 30 can train under our faculty of 12 experts. And art institutes all over the country have introduced mime courses. Would so many people want to take up this as a career if there was no future? demands Dutta. 

 Dutta, who coined the phrase mukhabhinoy, has performed all over the world and won accolades including the Sangeet Natak Academy Award and now heads the government-aided Padaboli, Jogesh Mime Academy. He is also the founder of Silent World, a free mime training centre for the disabled with 16 students currently on its rolls.

 For India, mime was a rediscovery, the basic components of this form were mentioned in the Natyashastras as a part of theatre and dance, reveals the septuagenarian mime guru. Welcoming the way Indian mime is adopting elements of Indian classical dance and yoga, Dutta said: Our mime is different from the western version. Theirs is closer to ballet, clowning and acrobatics. They build up an illusion while our approach is more realistic, he explains.

 For Dutta new compositions grow out of everyday living. The group mime Atanka where he takes the stage with 20 juniors, focuses on the fear of terrorism that seems to grip all of society like a sickness today, pointed out Dutta. 

 Ticket-sale at most mime shows is nil, admits Kamal Naskar, Duttas one-time disciple who now runs the Modern Mime Academy in Behala. But he says this is not the time to count profit and loss. We are at sea, mime is yet to gain a foothold, this is the time for dedication and sacrifice.

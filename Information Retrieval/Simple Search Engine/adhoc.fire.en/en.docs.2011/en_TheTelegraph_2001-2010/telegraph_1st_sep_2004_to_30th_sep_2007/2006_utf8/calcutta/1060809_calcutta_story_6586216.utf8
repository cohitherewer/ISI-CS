 Acquitted of murder

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Tuesday acquitted Jalil Ali Molla, found guilty by a trial court of murdering an elderly woman in a Gurusaday Dutta Road highrise in 1994.

 Govind, wife of city-based businessman Ranjit Singh Monga, was the victim. She was found dead in Ajanta apartment, under the jurisdiction of Karaya police station. The murder on March 12, 1994, had created quite a stir in the city.

 The murderer had entered the flat during the day on the pretext of painting it and taken away Govinds ornaments after killing her. He had managed to hoodwink several security guards of the building. 

 Five months after the incident, the detective department had arrested Jalil Ali Molla and claimed to have recovered the weapon he had used to kill Govind. Police also stated that Molla had confessed to the crime and had even shown the detectives the shop where he had sold the stolen goods.

 A division bench of the high court, comprising Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice D. Dutta, after hearing the appeal moved by Molla against the trial courts order, observed that the prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the accused, 12 years after the crime.

 According to the judges, not enough circumstantial evidence was produced to prove that Molla had murdered Govind. So, the verdict by the city sessions court was set aside. 

 In 2001, the trial court had convicted Molla for the murder and sentenced him to imprisonment for life. The case diary states that a man had knocked on the door of the Mongas flat. Mala, the maid, opened the door. The man told her that Ranjit Singh had asked him to paint the flat.

 Mala called Govind, who allowed the man to enter the flat. After the maid left the apartment, the man hit Govind on the head with a hammer. As she fell to the floor unconscious, the man fled with her ornaments.

 When Mala came back to the flat, she found Govind lying on the floor. She immediately informed Ranjit Singh, who was in his office then.

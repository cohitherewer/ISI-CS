 Woman, 40, arrested for truck hijack

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bindu Banerjee Samanta, in her late 40s, was arrested at her Shibpur home on Wednesday for hijacking a truck loaded with raw material used for manufacturing plastic goods.

 She not only received the consignment, but also made all arrangements to sell it, said D.P. Tarania, inspector-general (II) of police, CID. We are trying to find out whether she had committed other crimes.

 Bindu, a divorcee, has a son who passed B.Com last year. 

 The truck was hijacked from Bombay Road, near Bagnan, a month ago. Four men were arrested for the crime. They told police that their leader was Bindu. The woman said she was waiting in her car while the truck was being hijacked, said an officer.

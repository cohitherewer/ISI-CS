The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Thin red line

 This week I have two simple stories 

 to tell. From all accounts, both are true. Many decades 

 ago, there was this student in the US who, like most of 

 his ilk was homesick. The high point in his week was a trip 

 to the bungalow of his married cousin in a neighbouring 

 state. Home food, a post-lunch Hindi movie and lots of adda 

 in his mother tongue made his Sundays truly memorable. 

 On one such Sunday, few minutes 

 into the drive, he glanced at the fuel gauge and suspected 

 that he would run out of gas. By then he was approaching 

 the state border. This is when he saw the billboard. It 

 said, your last chance to buy gas at 46 cents. There were 

 at least three more billboards with the same message before 

 he crossed the state border. As he got into the neighbouring 

 state, he stopped for some coffee and gas. As he went to 

 pay the bill, he realised that gas in this state cost only 

 43 cents. The billboards in his home state had said nothing 

 untrue he no longer had the chance to buy gas at 46 cents!

 The second story is more recent. 

 This concerns a brand which offers edible nutrition to its 

 consumers. Nutrition as a concept belongs to a very dodgy 

 category. In a laboratory, it is scientifically measurable, 

 but in a kitchen it can only be perceived. To add substance 

 to its message, the brand got a scientific experiment done. 

 The result: the control group 

 which only got placebos showed significantly less growth 

 effects than the experimental group served the brand in 

 question. Inspired by the results, a script was developed 

 for audio-visual advertising. Consumers loved it. More importantly, 

 it resulted in the perception of the brand on nutrition 

 value going up a notch or two in relation to the competing 

 brands.

 There was just one small but significant 

 departure. In the scientific experiment, the control group 

 was given placebos. So our brand in question competed with 

 zero nutritional stimuli and came out with flying colours. 

 The advertising, however. claimed that the members of the 

 control group were served an ordinary brand, a euphemism 

 used in advertising to refer to competition. So the advertising 

 ended up claiming that the brand delivered more nutrition 

 than other brands, something the original experiment was 

 not even designed to test.

 If you have seen Omkara (picture 

 above), you will obviously connect. The movie opens 

 with a monologue of Saif. In a language that is colourful 

 and unprintable he says there is a very thin line between 

 what can roughly, and somewhat politely, be translated as 

 simple and gullible.

 The above-mentioned campaigns 

 raise a pertinent point do creators of advertising, at 

 least some of the time, believe that we consumers belong 

 to one of those two breeds that Saif mentioned?

 Maybe the time has come for revisiting 

 the basics. David Ogilvy had said, consumer is not a moron, 

 she is your wife. Today, she is your child too.

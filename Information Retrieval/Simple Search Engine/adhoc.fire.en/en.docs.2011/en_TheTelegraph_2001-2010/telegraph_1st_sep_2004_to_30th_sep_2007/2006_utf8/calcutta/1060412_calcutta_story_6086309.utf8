 and cookie recipes

 Easter Eggs

 Can be made with dark, milk or white chocolate.

 Polish the insides 

 of two matching Easter egg moulds with clean cotton wool. 

 Break 250gm good quality chocolate and place in a small 

 heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water to melt.

 Spoon half the chocolate 

 into one mould and spread thickly up the sides with the 

 back of a teaspoon to cover evenly. 

 Place the mould hollow-side 

 down on greaseproof paper and chill for five minutes in 

 the fridge. Using the remaining chocolate, repeat with other 

 mould.

 Chill both moulds 

 for 10-15 minutes until hard. Remove the eggs from the moulds 

 and gently pull the sides of the mould to gradually release 

 the chocolate halves. Invert on to a work surface and continue 

 to loosen and press the eggs out of the mould.

 Take one egg half 

 hollow-side up and spread a little melted chocolate around 

 the shell rim using the back to spoon. Fill the egg with 

 assorted chocolate and candies, then join the halves together 

 and leave to set.

 250 gm butter

 120 gm icing sugar

 2 egg yolks

 100 gm chocolate chips/

 Preheat the oven to moderately hot. Roll out the dough

 Housewife bludgeoned in dacoity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A daylight robbery on Monday in a Bangur Avenue flat, under Lake Town police station, left 45-year-old housewife Renu Saraf critically injured.

 Police said one of the three robbers, who worked as a carpenter in the neighbourhood, was arrested and a hunt is on for the other two. 

 Superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar said Shorab Ali, the carpenter and his accomplices called on the Sarafs? Block A residence around 11.30 am on Monday. 

 Renu was alone at home, while husband Vijay was headed for his shop in Burrabazar.

 ?Renu did not hesitate to open the door as she knew Ali. But the carpenter barged in and asked Renu to hand over the keys to the almirah. Of the two accomplices, one was standing guard outside,? Kumar said.

 The woman refused to hand over the keys, prompting the three to assault her.

 ?She mustered enough courage to resist them. As she raised an alarm, Ali hit her on the head with a blunt instrument he was carrying. She immediately lost consciousness,? Kumar added.

 Once Renu was silenced, the three tried to break open the almirah, but failed.

 ?They then turned their attention to Renu, lying on the ground and bleeding profusely from the head. They took off her gold bangles and fled, leaving the door ajar,? said Tamal Bose, additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake.

 The Sarafs alleged that valuables worth Rs 2 lakh had been looted from their house. ?But a preliminary investigation suggests that only the bangles were taken. We are verifying the family?s claim,? Bose added.

 Renu was taken to a private hospital on EM Bypass, where her condition was stated to be critical. The incident has unnerved the residents of the area.

 ?This is not the first time that such an incident has taken place in our locality. We are feeling insecure. If such a robbery is possible in daylight, think of the situation after dark,? said Pawan Jaiswal, a next-door neighbour of the Sarafs.

 ?It seems the assailants were aware of the Sarafs? financial status,? additional superintendent Bose said. ?We are trying to find out whether they had teamed up with an insider. Raids will be carried out in Howrah and some pockets on the city?s southern fringes to bust the hideouts of Ali?s accomplices.?

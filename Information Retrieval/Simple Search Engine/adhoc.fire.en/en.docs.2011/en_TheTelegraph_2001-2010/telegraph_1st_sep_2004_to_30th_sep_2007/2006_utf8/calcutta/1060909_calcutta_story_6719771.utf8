The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cell-steal gang held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In overnight raids in the city and its suburbs on Thursday, police busted a gang of six expert cellphone lifters, who generally operate on Metro Railway trains. Fifteen handsets were recovered from the arrested men.

 According to police, a man in his late 20s rounded up from Lindsay Street provided them with the first lead to the gang. 

 Vineet Goyel, deputy commissioner of police (central division), said the man disclosed his identity as Sheikh Fakruddin, alias Badal, and he made contradictory statements about his own whereabouts.

 During interrogation, Badal confessed that he headed a gang of mobile lifters operating on the Metro trains. Going by his statement, police raided a hideout in Nadial, on the southern fringes of the city, and detained Mohammad Khaliq.

 After arresting the duo, we carried out a series of raids on Metiabruz, Garden Reach and Titagarh and rounded up four others Arshad Ali, Nimai Nayek, Parameshwar Paswan and Zahir Kureshi, said an officer of New Market police station.

 Elaborating on the modus operandi of the mobile phone lifters, an officer said: They preferred crowded train compartments to ensure a successful operation and targeted those commuters who keep their cellphones in their shirt pockets. One of them used to push the commuter and when the handset fell on the ground, he picked it up, said another officer. Within moments, the phone used to be handed to another member of the gang.

 Sometimes the gang members operated on the staircases of Metro platforms. They would push a man and run off after snatching his cellphone, said another officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Civic body stakes claim

 - Motor 

 vehicles tax

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), in an effort to raise funds for the services it provides, wants at least half of the state governments income from motor vehicles tax.

 I have approached the government on the issue and talks are on, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. I think something positive will come out, as the government is convinced that our claim is justified. We have explained to them about our financial commitments to agencies like CESC and Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA) I will be happy to get the entire proceeds from the tax, but that is not possible, as the civic body does not own all roads in the city.

 The state transport department earns about Rs 750 crore a year from motor vehicles tax. The civic authorities feel that unless they get half the amount, it will not be possible for them to keep paying their dues to CESC and CMWSA, and also shoulder the burden for the regular upkeep of roads and street lights.

 The CMCs annual expenditure on street lights and the 2,100 km of metalled roads it owns is Rs 250 crore. Besides, it has to cough up another Rs 150 crore a year to the CESC and CMWSA. The payment to CMWSA is on account of the filtered water the CMC receives from the Garden Reach waterworks.

 We have been demanding a share of motor vehicles tax since 1990, when Prasanta Chatterjee was mayor. I think mayor Bhattacharyya can settle the deal with the state government across the table, said mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera.

 As for the upkeep of the city roads, Bera pointed out that peoples expectations often force the civic authorities to undertake repairs even on thoroughfares owned by the public works department, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Improvement Trust and the Calcutta Port Trust.

 The latest in the line of landfill fire is a popular eatery on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. 

 Sanjha Chulha, on the Bypass stretch between Science City and Ruby Hospital, has been accused of illegal filling of a roadside waterbody on a plot opposite the existing eatery. And Friday ? the last of a 15-day CMC notice ? has been set as a demolition deadline.

 About five cottahs of land, valued at Rs 40 lakh, have apparently been reclaimed by the owners of the 88, Uttar Panchanna Gram restaurant by filling up part of the waterbody in front of a building bordering the opposite flank of the Bypass. The ground floor of the building was recently acquired by Sanjha Chulha, probably for another outlet.

 The civic authorities have also accused the Sanjha Chulha owners of ?illegal amalgamation of two separate buildings with a staircase? at the restaurant. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has issued an order to raze the illegal portions of Sanjha Chulha unless the owners restore the waterbody or produce a clearance certificate from the CMDA and pollution control board by Friday.

 When Metro approached the partners of Sanjha Chulha on Wednesday afternoon, they gave two different versions. ?Neither do we own that property, nor have we filled up the ditch,? said partner Asif Ahmed. ?That place is owned by Md Aminuddin, who happens to be an acquaintance.?

 Md Aminuddin claimed he was one of the partners of Sanjha Chulha and the ?uncle of Asif Ahmed?. He denied filling up the waterbody, blaming it on ?the local people?.

 Residents of the area told Metro that the ditch had been partially filled by Sanjha Chulha to allow easy access to the proposed new outlet.

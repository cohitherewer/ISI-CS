 Avert, rather than extinguish

 Tarit Basu: Your performance during Durga puja was fantastic. Kali puja is round the corner. What are your plans to tackle fire incidents during Diwali? 

 Preparedness has two sides preparedness on the part of puja committees and preparedness of the fire department. For us, preparedness is a part of our daily life. During any puja, our main aim is to minimise the probability of fire accidents, as prevention is better than cure. This year, we have laid a set of fire safety measures for all community pujas. This year, during Durga puja, our officers had conducted an inspection of the pandals. A 20-member team was set up for the purpose. We had also set up eight temporary fire stations in collaboration with Calcutta Police at Tollygunge, Topsia, Muchipara, Shyampukur, Lake Town, Behala, Watgunge, Metiabruz and at Bagnan and Bantra in Howrah.

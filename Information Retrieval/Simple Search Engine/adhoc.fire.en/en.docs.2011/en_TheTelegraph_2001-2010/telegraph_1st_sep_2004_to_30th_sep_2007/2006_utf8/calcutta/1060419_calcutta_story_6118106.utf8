The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 The University of Calcutta should judiciously utilise the 

 Rs 100-crore grant from the Centre. They should organise 

 more seminars and talks for the students. Along with this, 

 the authorities should give scholarships and stipends to 

 more students at the post-graduate and graduate levels. 

 We have a lot of meritorious students in our state who cannot 

 study due to shortage of funds. Besides, this would also 

 check the brain drain from West Bengal. 

 Amit V. Sengupta, Sarat Colony. 

 Metro Railway has become an integral part of our lives. 

 But even during the peak hours, only two to three ticket 

 counters out of seven or eight are functional. During the 

 rush hour when every minute is precious, we have to wait 

 in long queues and often miss our scheduled trains. I request 

 the authorities to take some steps in this regard. 

 Moumita Nandi, Behala.

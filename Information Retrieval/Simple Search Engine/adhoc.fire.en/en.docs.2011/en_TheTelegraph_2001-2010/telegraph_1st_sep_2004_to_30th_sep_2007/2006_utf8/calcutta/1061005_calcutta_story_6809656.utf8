The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Medley of musical workshops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta School of Music (CSM) has a lined up a musical treat for the festive season. 

 The recent concert by the Rome String Quartet will be followed by guitar, flute and flamenco workshops. While the guitar and flute workshops will be conducted by Duo Similia from Canada on October 11, Ballet Giralda members will hold the other workshop four days later. Both workshops will be held at the CSM auditorium and will be open to all.

 The CSM hopes to offer insights and open cultural dialogues through the programmes. The performance by the Rome String Quartet on September 26, organised jointly by the CSM and consulate of Italy in Calcutta, was also held towards that end. The performance was described as dialogues between music and painting.

 Images and sounds represent the same reality. Painters and musicians narrate the same dream through different means. Colour is in music and music is in colour,said Vittorio Di Lotti one of the founding members of the Rome quartet.

 Formed in 1976, the quartet brought together members from backgrounds such as chamber music groups, Rome opera theatre and Panartis Quartet. The have numerous recordings to their credit. Our new members share and carry forward the same passion for music, Lotti told Metro before the concert.

 The members described the city audience as one of the best outside Europe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Nothing beyond

 Calcutta warmed up for a week 

 of partying last Saturday with Beyond Barriers Chapter VIII, 

 a musical extravaganza organised by the St Xaviers College 

 (Calcutta) Alumni Association and RPG Enterprises in association 

 with The Telegraph.

 The programme kicked off with 

 performances by a few alumni members. An 8,000-strong crowd, 

 including students, parents, alumni, working executives 

 and industrialists, had turned up.

 Earlier, Xaverians had had to 

 postpone the colleges annual fest Xavotsav because of a 

 48-hour bandh call. The zestful event line-up on Saturday 

 evening made up for the disappointment as they danced to 

 Bollywood numbers on the college grounds.

 Before the stars of the evening 

 took the stage, the college principal, Father P.C. Matthews, 

 greeted the audience for Christmas.

 The association handed over a 

 cheque of Rs 25 lakh to the principal towards development 

 of the second campus of St Xaviers College, which is coming 

 up off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 Kailash signifies satyam and 

 shivam, Ujjaini, from our own city, is sundaram. 

 So today, we have satyam, shivam sundaram and nothing 

 beyond, Nihil Ultra, said the principal, introducing 

 the two singers for the night, Kailash Kher and Ujjaini 

 Mukherji.

 Up first was Ujjaini, the winner 

 of Ek Main Ek Tu, the musical talent hunt on Zee 

 TV. She performed for 45 minutes with chartbusters like 

 the title track of the film Golmaal, Its the 

 time to disco from Kal Ho Naa Ho and Salaame 

 from Dhoom.

 But it was Kher and his band Kailasa 

 who stole the show. The sufi singer walked on to the stage 

 rendering the title track from Mangal Pandey The Rising. 

 He followed it up with other hits from his album Kailasa 

 such as Tauba tauba and Teri deewani.

 The hour-and-a-half-long show 

 ended after the singer had given in to popular demand and 

 sung two songs after Allah ke bande.

 Kailash Kher and his band Kailasa thrill 

 the Beyond Barriers crowd

A dynamic self-driven singer who 

 has trained under 15 gurus, Kailash Kher comes across as 

 a humble person despite the success of his works in Main 

 Hoon Na, Fanaa and Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part 

 II.

 Who helped you get established 

 in the music industry?

 I struggled the first few years 

 of my career in the jingles industry. A lot of people have 

 influenced me as a singer and as an individual. I owe a 

 lot to my 15 gurus, especially Guru Pandit Kumar Gandharva.

 Have you changed after 

 Allah ke bande happened?

 I dont get attracted to material 

 things. I still lead a simple life of a sufi. With the blessings 

 of my parents and the Almighty I have carved a niche for 

 myself in the music industry.

 lWhere do you see yourself five 

 years from now?

 I believe in destiny. Whatever 

 I sow today I will reap tomorrow. I am a public figure so 

 after five years I will be where my fans place me. My album 

 Kailasa is a milestone of my life.

 lHow did you like Calcutta?

 It was wonderful performing here. 

 I enjoyed myself. I would urge budding singers to work hard 

 as nothing comes easy in life. Learn from Tagores famous 

 song Jodi tor daak shune keu na ashe, tobe ekla cholo 

 re

 How different are Sufi 

 songs now from what they were traditionally?

 The basic thing remains the same, 

 only the style changes. You have to serve the traditional 

 dishes in a new form to attract the youth. I am a bridge 

 between the traditional and Bollywood.

 What is Sufism for you?

 Madness about your beloved, passion 

 that goes beyond all barriers and becomes pure and out of 

 this world such that there is nothing beyond Nihil Ultra, 

 that is what Sufism is.

 Thinking green

 The city finals of the fifth Euro-Enviro 

 Quiz, organised by Eureka Forbes Institute of Environment 

 in association with TTIS, was held at Rotary Sadan 

 on December 16. It started with the audience and participants 

 taking the Enviro Pledge based on three Rs Reduce wasteful 

 consumption, Reuse everything optimally and Recycle responsibly.

 Twenty six schools from Calcutta 

 participated in the preliminary rounds which were held over 

 a month. The top four teams out of them pitted their wits 

 against each other in six rounds at Rotary Sadan (picture 

 by Sanat Kumar Sinha).

 South Point High School maintained 

 the lead from the first round till Calcutta Boys High School 

 caught up in the third round. Debasis Bishoyi and Agriva 

 Roy of South Point won in a tiebreaker against Calcutta 

 Boys. They will compete against 30 teams in Mumbai on February 

 9.

 Around 300 schools from 16 cities 

 participated in the contest which is part of the e-initiative 

 movement of Eureka Forbes Institute of Environment. We 

 never thought that we will win, smiled the jubilant Pointers.

 Food for thought

 The basement of Apeejay School, 

 Park Street, recently hosted a food carnival for students 

 of classes VI to X. The event started with an introduction 

 about types of food and their nutritional value. A computer 

 presentation followed in which the benefits of a good breakfast 

 was emphasised upon. A chef from The Park hotel then spoke 

 on the different types of breakfasts. Enthused by the response 

 from the children, he even demonstrated how to cook two 

 dishes. Later, the students took their pick from Pav Bhaji, 

 Aloo Paratha, Chaat, Biriyani, sweets and other delicacies 

 on sale at the stalls.

 A moment from Hariye Jay Manush

 Bengali theatre made Albert Camus persona non grata, just because he had rejected Marxism, for which offence the Algerian Communist Party had expelled him. In these days of local perestroika, it is a welcome change to find Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra stealing a march over their Calcutta seniors by adapting Camus?s The Just, the most successful play in his career, which scored over 400 performances on its first run beginning in 1949. What?s more, Kishore Sengupta has Indianised it very intelligently in the form of Hariye Jay Manush.

 Camus placed it among the anarchists of Russian history plotting to assassinate a Grand Duke, so as to set up a debate on the issue of violent extremism. Recognising its relevance, Sengupta turns it into India?s present concern ? a band of young revolutionaries conspiring to blow up a police superintendent in a bomb blast. Thus, he simultaneously addresses our general fears about terrorism, specifically suggests the increasing dangers of Naxalism in forested central India, and reminds us of our own history of the movement from its seeds of young idealism to the administrative crackdown that terminated it.

 Right through, he maintains Camus?s balanced and humanistic perspective of inability to choose between two immoral positions: cold-blooded murder by the subversives and ruthless suppression by the authorities. Camus gives everybody a valid point, ranging from the various stands expressed by members of the group (rigid to moderate to romantic) to the politically shrewd warden and the superintendent?s widow searching for an answer. Sengupta directs all of them in taut portrayals, his own as the guilt-ridden killer coming foremost. This is a thought-provoking production, well worth watching.

 Meanwhile across the Atlantic, Tennessee Williams had hit audiences with two stunners in a row, The Glass Menagerie (1945) and A Streetcar Named Desire (1947). The youthful Creative Commune presented digest editions of both on the terrace of Landmark. Staging just one of these classics requires fortitude; to collapse them into a double bill appeared foolhardy. But in a comparatist?s delight, it brought into sharp focus their similarities, for in each case Williams spotlighted a lonely woman who suffers abuse from men introduced to her through her sibling.

 A conceptual problem arose in the cinematic referential point that director Trina Nileena Banerjee imposed on Streetcar, constantly quoting Elia Kazan?s brilliant film. Such a method becomes interesting only if applied consistently to both works. It made little sense to play Menagerie like the drama, but Streetcar like the movie, especially since Hollywood pressured unwarranted alterations to the script. Also, the inexperienced cast could not sustain the original film accents, except for Ronaan Roy?s vocal simulation of Marlon Brando, his bellows reverberating over the rooftops. Aditya Vikram Das made a passable Mitch, Blanche?s other tormentor. But Adwaita Das provided the most individualised and believable characterisation of both shows as a shy Laura with a slight stutter.

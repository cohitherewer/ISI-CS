 Parking lot, problems aplenty

 The fate of the underground parking lot in front of New Market still hangs in balance, with traders raising a fresh set of demands after a technical committee turned down most of its earlier demands.

 As things stand, work on the project, suspended since April, is not likely to resume till the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the traders reach an agreement on the new demands.

 The project has already missed a dozen deadlines since April 2003 and is likely to miss the latest one March 31, 2007 as the promoters failed to start work by November 27, as had been agreed.

 The new demands of the SS Hogg Market Traders Association are

 Construction of a road 

 connecting New Market and Free School Street

 Evicting hawkers from 

 Bertram Street and Fenwick Bazar Street 

 Completion of the proposed 

 basement parking lot at the nearby Hudco building 

 Handing over of the open-air 

 theatre proposed to be built in the New Market area to the 

 traders association.

 The earlier demands that have been turned down by the experts committee comprising Nitin Som, Prabir Mitra and Samir Rakshit included construction of a thoroughfare along the northern flank of Lindsay Street and dropping the proposal for setting up a waterbody.

 The contents of the report was revealed to the traders on Sunday by local CPM parliamentarian Sudhansu Sil and councillor Shiela Kapur.

 We must protect the interests of the New Market traders who have been cornered by the project, Sil told Metro on Monday.

 We will allow resumption of work only when our demands are met, working secretary of SS Hogg market Traders Association Ashok Gupta asserted.

 As work gets delayed for one reason or other, the private partner in the joint venture, Simplex Projects Ltd, is counting losses. Simplex chairman B.K. Mundra a loss of more than Rs 1 crore has already been incurred.

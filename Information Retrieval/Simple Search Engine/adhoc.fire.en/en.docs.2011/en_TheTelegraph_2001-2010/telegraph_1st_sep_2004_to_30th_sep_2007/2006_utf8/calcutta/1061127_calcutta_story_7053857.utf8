The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diverse demands ring growth

 Salil Kumar Bhaduri, general manager (customer 

 relations and sales), Calcutta Telephones, met readers of 

 The Telegraph and answered their queries. Participants included 

 Shashi Damani, Mohd Sharique Ehsan, Sourish Mishra, B. Banerjee, 

 Diptimoy Ghosh, Talat Salahuddin, Sandip Banerjee, Asim 

 Majumdar, S. Sarkar, Mridul Banerjee and Sanjay Agarwal

Shashi Damani: Until recent years, the prime job of Calcutta Telephones was to provide landline connections. Now, in the age of information technology, you have entered into the multifarious business of telecommunication, including broadband and wireless services. Do you think that the diversification of your job may increase the problems of landline subscribers? 

 I do not agree with your argument. Your fears are imaginary. The situation will be quite the reverse. Landline services will be improved and will become smarter. Let me explain why. 

 The landline service is the mother of all services, like broadband, Triple Play, etc. Hence, the diversification is totally dependent on the landline services. In the coming years, there will be a demand to improve services and we will build it to earn more revenue. 

Mohd Sharique Ehsan: Your customer care officers are not competent enough. Sometimes, our complaints are not attended to for seven to eight days. Please tell us why.

 Well, our statistics say that our landline services have improved in the past few years. Complaints are generally redressed within 48 hours. However, if there is a localised problem, our officers may take some time to fix it. 

Mohd Sharique Ehsan: We are frequently facing problems in broadband connections due to theft of cables. Do you think private operators have a hand in this? 

 There is a proposal to replace overhead cables with a network of underground cables. Work has already started. Regarding the theft of cables, I would say police should unearth the motive behind it. We are just service providers.

Sourish Mishra: Are we free to instal a caller-identification device with our landline telephone instruments? Does it require any prior approval from your department?

 You are free to instal a caller-identification device in your instruments. We dont take any extra charge for the service any more. It is not mandatory to obtain an approval from Calcutta Telephones for installing it. However, if a customer applies, we then inform him about the nature of the gadget, which he intends to use. In many cases, unapproved gadgets might cause problems in the telephone line.

B. Banerjee: After surrendering a landline connection, we have to submit the deposition slip to your accounts officer to get back the security amount. But it takes a long time to get back the money. Why?

 We try to settle the claims within 60 days. But it is not feasible every time. The refund is ordered only against ano-dues certificate from different sections of the revenue department. If you have an STD facility, the certificate will reach you even later.

Diptimoy Ghosh: I have surrendered my broadband connection in July, but I am still getting monthly bills for the service. 

 It cannot be possible that even after surrendering a connection, you will be billed for it. It may be possible that your documents have not been verified. A communication gap cannot be ruled out. The service is disconnected by the revenue department and I think your papers have not reached them.

Diptimoy Ghosh: In some cases, we get a reconnection bill, even when the service has not been disconnected. Please explain why?

 Can you produce the documents? I will look into the matter. 

Talat Salahuddin: While launching the broadband service, you said it would have multipurpose utility in the future. When will we get those other services through broadband connection?

 Plans are afoot to introduce Triple Play. Lines are being upgraded. In Triple Play, if you have a broadband connection, you can get telephone service, broadband Internet connection and video or TV channels through it.

Talat Salahuddin: What will be the tariff of the Triple Play service?

 If everything goes as per our plan, Triple Play will be launched in Calcutta by next year. However, for an individual house connection, you may have to wait for some more months. The charges for the service are yet to be decided.

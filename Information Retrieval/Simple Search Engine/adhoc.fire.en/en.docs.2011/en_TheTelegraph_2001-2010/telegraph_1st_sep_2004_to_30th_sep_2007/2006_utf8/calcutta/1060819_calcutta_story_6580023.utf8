 Finger on pulse for new cure

 - Bloodless surgery or laser therapy, city on healthcare innovation high

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Bloodless liver resection, shedding fat without surgery, state-of-the-art laser therapy without the usual side effects Calcutta is trying hard to catch up with other sought-after healthcare destinations.

 For the first time in the city, a major anatomical liver resection with the vascular isolation technique, involving the use of CUSA (Cavetron Ultrasonic Sonal Aspiration machine), was carried out recently at AMRI Hospitals.

 The blood loss is minimal. CUSA emits ultrasound waves that vapourise the liver cells without damaging the blood vessels, said Debashish Banerjee, liver surgery and transplant specialist at AMRI Hospitals.

 He performed the surgery on a 63-year-old, who had a big tumour in the intestine that spread into the left lobe of the liver. With the surgery, both the tumour and the affected part of the liver were removed. The truncated liver will regain its normal size in around three weeks.

 Earlier, major liver resections were not performed in the city for fear of blood loss that might have even led to the patients death, Banerjee pointed out.

 Another first-in-town in healthcare has been notched up by Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, with the introduction of mesotherapy, a technique of shedding weight without an operation. By this technique, a mixture of medicines and vitamins is injected through fine needles into localised pouches of fat in various parts of the body.

 Microscopic contents of medicine are injected into skin to eliminate the cellulite (accumulated fat), explained Sachin Verma, consultant dermatologist at Apollo Gleneagles. This is also used as an anti-ageing therapy and to enhance the glow of skin.

 For eyes, a new software for power correction has been sourced by various units in the city. Wavefront Assisted LASIK (Laser Assisted Insitu Keratomileusis) does not have side-effects typical of any laser therapy. It minimises the chance of power regression and other complications like halos or glare after a laser therapy, said Divesh Shah, ophthalmologist with Himalaya Vision Care Centre.

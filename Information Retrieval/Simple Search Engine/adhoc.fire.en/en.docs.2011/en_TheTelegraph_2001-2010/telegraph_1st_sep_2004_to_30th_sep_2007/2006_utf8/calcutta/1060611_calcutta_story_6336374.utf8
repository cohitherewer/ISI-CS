The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Next weekend you can be at ... 

South Raipur

 When a friend suggested a place 

 called South Raipur, 32 km from the city, for a weekend 

 outing and insisted that it was totally ?out of the world?, 

 we were not convinced. However, our penchant for new destinations 

 got the better of us. We decided to try it out.

 We started early in the morning and it took us a little over one-and-a-half hours to drive to our destination via Behala, Diamond Harbour Road, Bakrahat Road, Bibirhat and Dongaria. Rural Bengal spread out its charms on both sides of the route. Our journey ended at the gates of the majestic three-storeyed Bhagirathi Inspection Bungalow.

 Adjacent to the building was a garden with a sprawling green lawn, small clay statuettes, pruned hedges and flower beds. The appearance of the bungalow and its ambience took away our weariness.

 Even when we entered the bungalow, 

 we did not have an inkling about its picturesque backdrop. 

 Only while climbing up to the first-floor balcony did we 

 see the Hooghly flowing behind the building, with just an 

 embankment separating the river from the bungalow.

 The Hooghly at South Raipur is wide and deep, and we relished the sight of large cargo and passenger vessels passing by. On the opposite bank stands Uluberia. Boats are available from the local jetty to Raichak and Diamond Harbour. We went for a cruise on the first evening.

 Bhagirathi Inspection Bungalow is owned by the public health and engineering department of the state government. Constructed in 2003, it provides comfortable accommodation at an affordable rate. There are four double-bed rooms named after mythological characters, with Rs 400 being the daily tariff. There is also a VIP room which is not let out to the public.

 The bungalow is air-conditioned and elegantly furnished. There is also Panchali, an annex that caters to tourists when there is a rush.

 A few metres away from the bungalow is a water treatment plant, one of the largest in Asia and one that supplies the arsenic-affected areas of South 24-Parganas. The water is sourced from Budge Budge. In fact, the bungalow was constructed for the use of the plant officials. For the last two years, it is being let out to tourists. 

 The next day, we spent long hours on the balcony overlooking the river listening to the sounds of silence, while the children played in the adjoining park. The food was sumptuous and varied, from typical Bengali fare like Karaishutir Kochuri and Bhetki Machher Paturi to Tandoori and Chinese items.

 The sunset at South Raipur is 

 brilliant. The last rays turned the entire river orange. 

 It was as if a painter had emptied his palette of orange 

 into the water. The fishing trawlers crawling along the 

 horizon and the chirping of birds created a dream at dusk.

 Going 

 South Raipur is 32 km from Calcutta. 

 The drive takes around 90 minutes. If you go by public transport, 

 the options are SD 26 from Babughat, and SD 30 and DS 1 

 from Taratala. Get down at the PHE bus stop. The bungalow 

 is hardly a 3-4 minute walk from the bus stop

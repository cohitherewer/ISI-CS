 Cops track down cheques left in bus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Cops sometimes do walk the extra mile to help people. Ask 26-year-old Abhijit Patra, if you find that hard to believe.

 On Monday morning, Patra, who works in a restaurant on Camac Street, boarded a Calcutta Tramways Company bus at Howrah town. He got off near Birla Planetarium, on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, leaving behind the diary he was carrying. Inside the diary were two bearer cheques, worth over Rs 6,000.

 Within minutes, Patra realised his mistake, but the bus had sped away by then. In a state of panic, he approached traffic sergeant Anirudhha Chatterjee of south traffic guard, who was deployed in the area.

 All Patra could produce was the ticket of the bus he had travelled in. Chatterjee immediately informed the Lalbazar control room, which in turn mobilised other arms of the force.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said: Patra boarded the bus near his residence in Howrah as does almost every day. The cheques inside the diary he was carrying a diary amounted to Rs 6,131.

 The deputy commissioner added: He got down from the bus around 9.55 am and almost immediately realised his mistake, but there was nothing he could do.

 Chatterjee, however, knew exactly what to do. I asked Patra to show me the ticket of the bus. It helped me to find out the registration number and route of the bus. I immediately passed on the information to the Lalbazar control room, the sergeant recounted.

 The bus was on the way to Barrackpore from Howrah. Officers in the control room first alerted the thanas on the route. Since we knew the roads the bus was going to take, we asked traffic sergeants deployed on the stretch to intercept it, added Chatterjee.

 Shyampukur police station and traffic guard were especially asked to watch out as the bus would have had to cross the Shyambazar five-point intersection, continued the sergeant.

 Within an hour of Patra approaching Chatterjee, traffic sergeant Prabhakar Singh, who is attached to Shyampukur traffic guard, saw the bus plying north along Bhupen Bose Avenue.

 He stopped the bus and boarded it with other officers. The officers asked the conductors where Patra had sat, said an officer of control room. They found the diary on the luggage rack above his seat. The cheques were inside.

 One of the officers then drove to Maidan police station, where Patra was waiting anxiously. I dont know how to thank you. Had this not happened to me, I would have believe that police could be so helpful, he told the officer before leaving the thana.

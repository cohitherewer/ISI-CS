 City Lights

 A veteran artist at work

 If the number of art galleries 

 that any particular city can boast be one of the yardsticks 

 of how seriously it takes culture, Calcutta right now is 

 on the cultural cutting edge. Galleries seem to be sprouting 

 in every other vacant space of the city ? and its peripheries 

 ? that one never associated with art exhibitions. Many of 

 them do not have the proper infrastructure, and more often 

 than not, the lighting is all wrong. Whether or not this 

 sudden spurt of activity is a boon for art and artists remains 

 to be seen.

 The latest such exhibition space to open is Gallery Royal in Alipore Apartment at 30B, Judges Court Road. A huge crowd was present at the inauguration. 

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi did the honours. The opening was a one-man show of Paritosh Sen. Here is an artist who has not slowed down with age. On the contrary, he has become more prolific, thanks to his disciplined existence.

 There is also a consistency about the quality of his work. He never seems to go wrong. Sen?s forte is drawing and he can conjure up a full-fledged work in a matter of minutes. 

 Moreover, his works are simple and have a direct appeal that can arrest the attention of even those who miss out on his biting social satire and his keen observation of social mores and of the simple joys of existence.

 Above all, there is a certain spontaneity about his work. For Sen, creation seems to be a joyous act and he can communicate this feeling to all viewers. Look at the fop with longish, flying hair regarding the bird that screeches at him. It is drawn in the tradition of caricatures but the fluent lines are a direct descendant of pata paintings. Or look at the hirsute woman with bare breasts doing up her hair. She belongs to our age but she is also a beauty in the Kansaripara or Chorebagan print tradition.

 As in this work, much of what this veteran artist creates has a strong undercurrent of sexuality that he detects in the most common of everyday situations. Like a woman of a certain age gnawing at a roasted bhutta. There are many such vignettes.

 On the other hand, there is a certain naivety and innocence in his depiction of children without turning them into sentimental idiots. A little girl gobbles green mangoes, while a large dragonfly has settled on the hand of another. Goldfish swim in a large container as a boy gapes at them. Here Sen shows the touch of a master in his use of the colour black.

 Sen?s wonderful sense of design comes to the fore when he sketches the man selling watermelons and the two young musicians. He uses colours sparsely but always with telling effect.

 Sen is among those leading artists of Bengal who show great sensitivity in their depiction of animal life. A bitch and her suckling brood, dog with bare fangs and solemn owls are masterpieces of their kind.

 Beckett in brief

 The Jadavpur University department of English staged Birth-Breath/Dearth-Death, a collage of nine rarely performed short plays by Samuel Beckett, before an ?intimate audience? of around 40 at the Padatik Little Theatre on Thursday evening.

 The department?s annual production was meant to be a tribute to the author, one of the most staged playwrights in this part of the world, in his centenary year. Born on April 13, 1906 in Ireland, Beckett made Paris his home and wrote in French and English.

 The bouquet of very short plays, or what Beckett himself called ?dramaticules?, comprised Breath, Act without Words II, Come and Go, Rockaby, Catastrophe, Ohio Impromptu, What Where, Footfalls and A Piece of Monologue. All the pieces belong to the post-Waiting for Godot period ? the play that established Beckett as one of the most powerful playwrights of the 20th century ? when his writings became more minimalist than ever before. 

 Identifying a thread to tie all the nine plays, chosen by director Prof Ananda Lal, was a tad difficult given that they drifted from Beckett?s pet theme of the futility of life (Act without Words II, Come and Go, Rockaby) and playing with fractured identities (Ohio Impromptu, Footfalls) to a protest against political aggression (Catastrophe). The production began with the shortest piece Breath, less than a minute, featuring a stage littered with rubbish. Act without Words II, the mime play which explores the drudgery of daily routine, used the Japanese Noh drama style.

 Lal had deliberately changed the gender of some of the characters in the plays. In Rockaby, which was also one of the most moving pieces, the protagonist is a man who rocks in a chair and utters ?more?, prompting a recorded voice to narrate the slow movement towards death. The crumbling facial expressions, the slowing down of the rocking chair, the cry for ?more? growing feeble and the dimming of the light made a powerful impact.

 The most lengthy play, A piece of Monologue enacted by Rohini Chaki, marked a fitting finale, the short unconnected sentences spoken as one long-winding line with a few pauses.

 Effective use of light, minimal props, non-frilly costumes and the actors an arm?s length away helped bring Beckett alive.

 Konkona: 

 Say it with a smile 

 With co-star Prosenjit giving 

 it a miss, the spotlight was all on Konkona Sen Sharma, 

 sporting an off-white silk sari and a bright smile at the 

 Friday premiere of Dosar (The Companion). ?The theme of 

 marital infidelity is something we all can relate to,? said 

 the actress about her second Bengali film with director 

 Rituparno Ghosh, before stepping in for the screening at

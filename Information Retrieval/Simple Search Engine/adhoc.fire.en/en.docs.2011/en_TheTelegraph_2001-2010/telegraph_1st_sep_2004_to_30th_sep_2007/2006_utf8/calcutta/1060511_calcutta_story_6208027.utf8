The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Studious girl, caring daughter

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A bright student, Archana Arora was liked by both her classmates and teachers at Seth Surajmal Jalan Balika Vidyalaya. Archana committed suicide by jumping off the sixth floor of her school building on Wednesday afternoon.

 A student of Class XII, she used to help support her family and fund her own education by giving private tuitions.

 A shattered Veena Arora, Archana?s mother, said: ?After her father?s death a few years ago, she and her two sisters started giving tuitions to run the family. I can only blame God for snatching my girl from me.?

 After returning home, on Nilmoni Mitra Street, in north Calcutta, from school in the afternoon, Archana would go to Burrabazar to tutor her students. 

 ?She would return around 9 pm, and after that we would have dinner together. It was our daily routine,? Veena said, tears streaming her face. 

 Archana lived in the flat with her mother, two elder sisters ? Varsha and Deepti ? and only brother Atul. 

 She was also popular in her locality, where she sang bhajans in a temple.

 ?She was studious and never had any problems with her friends,? said school secretary Nandalal Singhania. ?Seeing her dedication, we waived her fees and offered her other assistance so that she did not give up her studies. She was very ambitious, but was also very caring about her family.?

 The suicide sent shock waves among teachers and students of the school.

 ?It?s hard to believe that she is no more. Her death is a loss for the school,? said Kajal Khanna, a teacher. 

 ?A brilliant student and well-mannered, she would mix with everyone. She was popular among her friends and took part in all extra-curricular activities,? Khanna added.

 Another teacher, Manju Rakshit, said: ?Archana used to write poetry and compose bhajans. She would sing at school functions. She never bunked classes and her sincerity was exemplary.?

 Archana was also an ace debater. ?She took part in debates and extempore contests and won several awards. She was a role model for others.?

 Her classmates were too shocked to react. ?Archana helped me with studies and was very friendly,? said one of her classmates.

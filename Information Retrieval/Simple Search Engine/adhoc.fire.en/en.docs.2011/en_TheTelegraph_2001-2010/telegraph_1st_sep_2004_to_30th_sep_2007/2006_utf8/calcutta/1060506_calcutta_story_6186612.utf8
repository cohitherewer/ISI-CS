 What: 

 Style Direction 2006 ? Nvibes.

 Where: NIFD (now INIFD) 

 campus on Lindsay Street.

 When: Till May 7.

 Take a look: The exhibition has been put up by 50 students of the third and fourth semesters of the interior designing course. While some of them provided the ideas, others implemented them.

 The theme for this year is an advertising agency with students dividing the prototype interiors into reception area, business development or client interaction area, conference room, media planning, administration and marketing department, creative heads department and a photo studio. 

 True to the theme, the students have used lots of red, yellow, green and black to provide vibrancy and exciting contrasts. The designs are balanced, keeping both practicality and aesthetics in mind.

 Voiceover: The fashion design students put up a show each year and the interior design students put up an expose. This activity is extremely helpful and teaches them to translate pen-and-paper designs into reality, smiled Susan Mantosh of INIFD.

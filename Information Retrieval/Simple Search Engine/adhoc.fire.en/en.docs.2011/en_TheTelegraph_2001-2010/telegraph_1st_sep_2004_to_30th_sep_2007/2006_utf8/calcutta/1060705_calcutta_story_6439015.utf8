The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

The movie maniac

Screen On amp; Off

 He watches two films on a bad day. One a good one, the number is four. But doesn?t that take up 10 to 12 hours of the 16 work hours of the day? ?No, I fast forward the bad scenes and watch the good ones!?

 Trust Sajid Khan (picture by Aranya 

 Sen) to have a ready answer on just about anything under 

 the sun. If there?s even a whiff of celluloid, expect to 

 be at the receiving end of non-stop movie mutter. And if 

 he?s in town to only talk movies, well, keep your ear plugs 

 ready unless you too love everything from B. Subhash to 

 Brian De Palma.

 The host-and-dost of the small screen was in town on Tuesday to judge the Calcutta round of Sabse Bada Deewana, SET MAX?s search for the biggest film fanatic in the country. Having travelled to smaller cities like Bhopal, Lucknow, Jaipur and Surat, Sajid?s in Calcutta to find that one city fan who is mad about movies.

 ?My job is cut out just like (sister) Farah (Khan) had in Indian Idol,? he starts off. ?I am trying to locate the perfect film fan. I am not looking for a Shah Rukh Khan fan or an Abhishek Bachchan fan but someone who is obsessed with cinema itself. The basic love for the medium has to be there; he should not be a poster collector.?

 In his quest, Sajid has come across all kinds of people. A self-confessed Dilip Kumar fan who thinks Mughal-e-Azam was made in 1972. A Mithun Chakraborty fan who has named his two sons Mimoh and Cheemoh and still wears Disco Dancer outfits. A local goon who feels he is the real Sanjay Dutt and the one we see on screen is his duplicate!

 ?If you are fake I can catch you in minutes,? is the Sajid guarantee. ?But yes, there have been many true deewanas and it?s great to hear their stories. There was a Shah Rukh fan who celebrated his honeymoon just by going to Mumbai and sitting with his wife in Bandra Bandstand in front of Shah Rukh?s bungalow Mannat. It?s really touching to hear such stories.?

 Not many women, feels Sajid, make the cut because they are obsessed with heroes and not movies. ?They don?t care about the film, they go to watch their Brad Pitts and John Abrahams,? says Sajid. ?That?s the reason I am 34 and still unmarried. I can?t imagine marrying someone who is not mad about movies. You can say maine apni jawaani tyag di cinema ke naam par!?

 And he claims that he is not alone. Sajid would often camp with cousin Farhan Akhtar and director Ashutosh Gowariker and just chat movies. ?We don?t talk about work, we don?t talk about the latest gossip in town, we just talk films,? he says. ?Then we would be playing the DVD game Shout which is basically a movie quiz with trivia questions like which five sci-fi films had no action.?

 This crazy devotion will continue first-hand now. After having murdered many a movie on his chat and countdown shows on the small screen and even acting in a couple ? Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate and Main Hoon Na ? Sajid is ready to get into film direction full-time. He had directed the mini prelude episode of Ram Gopal Varma?s Darna Zaroori Hai.

 ?Even my getting into direction is a tribute to film fanhood,? he says. ?Whatever I know is only by watching movies, nothing else. Ever since DVDs have come out, I think it is the best school of learning films. If you listen to the director?s commentary that runs on the other audio channel with the movie, you can learn so much.?

 Now, Sajid Nadiadwala?s Rs 35-crore project Hey Baby will put to use all that online learning. ?It?s a comedy with a social message,? describes Sajid the director. ?It has Akshay Kumar, Fardeen Khan, Riteish, Vidya Balan and Boman Irani. The music is by Shankar Ehsaan Loy. I want to make the film like the way my favourite director Hrishikesh Mukherjee used to make his films.?

 But before the film is launched on August 7 (the date 07-08-06 would read ?786?), Sajid has to finish his job of finding the Sabse Bada Deewana. ?Although I would like to believe that I am the Sabse Bada Deewana, I wouldn?t mind crowning someone else who loves the movies unconditionally,? comes the spirited and smiling reply.

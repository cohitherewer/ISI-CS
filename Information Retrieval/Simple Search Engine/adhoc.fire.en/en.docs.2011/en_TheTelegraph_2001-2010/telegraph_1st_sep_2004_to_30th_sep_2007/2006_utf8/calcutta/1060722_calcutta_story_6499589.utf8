 Bag bests and basics

 The huge hobo or the 

 chic clutch, its a stunner that can do wonders to your 

 ensemble, says Shradha Agarwal

 ornate clutches are quite visible on the ramp; (below)

 It can jazz up your favourite 

 faded denims and enhance the glam quotient of your black 

 cocktail sari. An unusual shape, a quirky colour, a crazy 

 add-on, or a wild print ? your saviour stunner can boast 

 any of the above to be a show-stealer.

 Check out the Manish Arora collection at 85 Lansdowne, hunt at Be:, Hidesign and Megha Modi in Forum, Vasundhara Mantri at The Enclave in Alipore, Westside and Shoppers Stop, or raid the street marts till you find the perfect pick.

 A GoodLife guide to the current trends as well as some bag basics.

 Size matters

 One big bag tops the list of every girls purse prescription this season. A hobo (usually crescent-shaped), a tote (shaped like a shopping bag) or anything else that is oversized. These bags look upbeat and spirited and in turn reflect the owners mood and approach towards life, says style consultant Sunipa Samadder. 

 Pick your big bag in metallic leather. From golden and silver to shocking pink and turquoise, metallic is the style statement of the moment when it comes to leather, be it the hobo bags or flat slippers. 

 The newest work bags are far from boxy and dull. They are huge and other than neutral hues like black and brown, bright reds are common too, says Rukmini Roy Basu, senior manager at Hidesign in Forum.

 But heres a word of caution: petite frames should refrain from carrying grossly oversized bags for fear of looking weighed down. There has to be a line between bag and baggage, says Sunipa. 

 Hand haute 

 The clutch bags are here to stay at least till the next party season; most will ring in the New Year sporting these, says accessory designer Namrata Kanoi. 

 Big, small, satin, silk, leather, fabric, cane, jute, suede, glitter, matte? Whatever the kind, the now style in party bags is clutch.

 With a handle or without one, these bags look sexy and stand out at any social do. Wear them with a flashy cocktail ring. And, dont forget the manicure. 

 People are fed up of sequins and embroidery. Todays clutches are metallic or embellished with funky beads, neckpieces and brooches, says Namrata. Watch out for her window bags. These have in-built cut-outs to slide your fingers in, she adds. 

 Care code

 Stashed away in the cupboard corners is not the treatment your bag deserves. Namrata draws up a roster for right cleaning and storage.

 Store your purses separately 

 in a drawstring cloth bag, preferably white with tiny pores.

 Stuff it with paper or 

 plastic to maintain its original shape. 

 Allot a separate section 

 for bags in the cupboard. 

 Embellished bags need 

 to be gently wiped with soft mul dipped in soapy 

 water to remove stains. 

 Fungus-infected leather 

 bags need to be treated with petroleum or kerosene.

 Inside story 

 Keys, money, hairbrush and your lifeline in the form of the mobile phone. These constant features apart, your bag demands a host of must-haves, depending of course on the time of the day, or night. 

 All-day demand

 Your workbag should be big enough to accommodate quite a bit of stuff, but at the same time not large enough to look like a travel bag. 

 It should have multiple compartments to help you fish out important things fast when they are urgently needed, instead of last months grocery and fuel bills. 

 Keep it clutter-free and make it a point to spend two minutes throwing the junk out every other day. Heres the checklist of what your workbag should carry.

 A wallet that has credit 

 cards and your visiting cards.

 A pack of mint or chewing-gum.

 Your mobile phone.

 A hair brush.

 Two pens and a note pad.

 A pack of tissues or wipes.

 Make-up essentials like compact, kohl, neutral blush, your daily-wear lipstick and fruity lip balm.

 An emergency kit comprising a band-aid, a painkiller, a nail filer, rubber bands and some safety pins.

 Day through night

 This list is essential to transform yourself from the desk gal to disc glam. Add it to your office essentials and you are ready to face a last-minute date, confidently. 

 Face wipes or small bottle 

 of cleaning lotion.

 Some perfume.

 Throw in gloss, mascara 

 and eye shadow to your make-up bag.

 An effective accessory 

 ? scarf, earrings or a neckpiece.

 By night 

 Even the tiniest of evening bags can house these oh-so-vital extras. So pack in:

 A small mirror. 

 Your mobile phone.

 House keys.

 Touch-up make-up products 

 and your hairbrush.

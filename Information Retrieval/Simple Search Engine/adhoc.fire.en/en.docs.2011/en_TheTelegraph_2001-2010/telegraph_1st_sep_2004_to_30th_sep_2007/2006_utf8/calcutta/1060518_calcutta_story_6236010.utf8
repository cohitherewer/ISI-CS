 Couple hails Cupid court

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 One more quarrelling couple has been reunited by Calcutta High Court.

 Bulbul Dhar, who had lodged a complaint of torture against husband Surojit in 2005, told Justice S.P. Talukdar on Wednesday: ?After living with my husband for a year on a court order, I?ve come to realise that he is everything to me. I do not want to proceed with the case. The court should allow me to withdraw it.?

 The court promptly allowed Bulbul to withdraw the complaint she had lodged with Murari police station, in Birbhum, where her parents live, in April 2005. She had alleged that her husband and in-laws subjected her to both physical and mental torture.

 Following the complaint, Surojit, a resident of south Calcutta but a schoolteacher in Cooch Behar, moved the high court for anticipatory bail. His lawyer had argued: ?Surojit stays in Cooch Behar and Bulbul used to live with her in-laws in Calcutta. How could he torture her?? 

 The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra had then asked the petitioner and his wife to attend court. 

 When both turned up, the bench asked them to live together for a year.

 ?We will reject your plea and you will be arrested if you refuse to take along your wife to Cooch Behar,? the judges had warned Surojit. They also asked Bulbul to ?behave properly? with her husband.

 The matter was adjourned after the couple agreed to abide by the orders. 

 The complaint with police, however, was not withdrawn and early this year, a chargesheet was issued against Surojit. He again moved the high court, pleading that the chargesheet be squashed. 

 The case came up for hearing in the court of Justice S.P. Talukdar. Hearing the details, the judge asked Bulbul to come to court. On Wednesday, Bulbul appeared before the judge and expressed ?full faith? in her husband. 

 ?Last year, the court had asked me to live with my husband and try to win him over. I thank the judges for their decision. Now, I am very happy with Surojit,? the wife averred.

 Several estranged couples seeking separation were earlier reunited by the court. 

 In one instance, a couple was asked to go to Puri and resolve its differences.

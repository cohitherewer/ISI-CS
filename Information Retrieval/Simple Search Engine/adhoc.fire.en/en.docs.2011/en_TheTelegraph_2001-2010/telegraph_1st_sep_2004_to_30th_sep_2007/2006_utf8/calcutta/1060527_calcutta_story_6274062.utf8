The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pre-release drama peters out at plex

 One week after it opened in theatres across the world, The Da Vinci Code came to Calcutta multiplexes on Friday. But the high drama in the run-up to the release was hardly reflected in the first day first show at INOX (Forum), 11.45 am.

 MULTIPLEX 

 MOOD: Hushed 

 silence, punctuated by a few gasps, was the Code of 

 the day. Coming to a multiplex has always been more than 

 simply ?watching? a movie.

 But to its credit, The Da Vinci Code did manage to keep the viewers glued to their seats through two hours and 40 minutes. Even the normal interval exodus at the multiplexes was missing, as no one really wanted to miss any clues to the code.

 Tom Hanks was definitely the star draw ? his new look even drawing a few appreciative whistles from an otherwise subdued multiplex crowd when he made his first appearance as Robert Langdon. 

 Graphic scenes involving Silas, the self-flagellating monk played by Paul Bettany, also drew quite a few gasps and muffled shrieks.

 BOOK 

 BRIGADE: Most youngsters in the crowd, teenyboppers 

 and college-goers, had devoured Dan Brown?s bestseller and 

 were just raring to compare the book with the film.

 Talk before the film, at the half-way mark and at the very end revolved almost completely around the book vs film debate. ?I did not find the film half as thrilling as the book. With the narrative being chopped and changed, the Ron Howard movie just did not have the same impact as the Dan Brown book,? grumbled a young professional in a hurry to get back to office.

 CURIOSITY 

 CROWD: The hype has been unprecedented ? 

 with everyone from the Vatican to ?Pope? Priya Ranjan Das 

 Munshi involved in the controversy ? and so a lot of the 

 initial draw on Friday stemmed from the curiosity factor. 

 We?re here to find out what the fuss was all about, was 

 a distinct strain emerging at INOX. Some left the multiplex 

 enthused enough to buy the book ?from Crossword next door?, 

 others couldn?t really be bothered.

 HOUSE 

 NOT FULL: The ticket prices of this Hollywood 

 heavyweight are hardly forbidding at Forum ? Rs 80 and Rs 

 100 on weekdays and Rs 130 and Rs 150 on weekends ? but 

 the sales have been brisk, not bombastic. The 11.45 am show 

 was not full to the brim.

 ?The weekend should bring in the family crowd, but Monday onwards Code should rope in the college students,? said Arijit Dutta, east India distributor of the film.

 Pandal-hoppers then, shop-hoppers now an all-action month is what October has turned out to be in town. Just ask the cops.

 A fortnight after managing the Puja madness better than before, the Dhanteras-Diwali dhamaka has forced police to take cover and plan a mini action replay. Unlike the Durga puja days, police this week have the luxury to pick and choose their priority spots the traditional and new-age zones of jewellery shopping.

 All police stations have been briefed about the measures to be taken in view of the pre-Diwali rush till late hours this week, said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner (south).

 Glitter markets of Gariahat, Gol Park, Bhowanipore, Camac Street, Elgin Road, BB Ganguly Street, College Street and Hatibagan will be under special surveillance. Market committees have been told to beef up private security.

 The footfall is rising with every passing hour in the countdown to Diwali on Saturday. The fact that gold prices have dipped is, of course, a bonus. Mukesh Agarwal, proprietor of Kanak Jewellers, on Park Street, said: People are buying more and the Dhanteras market is expanding. On Thursday night, we will be open as long as we have customers.

 With the Dhanteras spirit spilling over, most jewellery stores have extended working hours. All four showrooms of Anjali jewellers will remain open till midnight on October 19 and 20, while A. Sirkar will be open all night.

 And its not just about a gold rush. Steel utensils and furniture are popular picks during Dhanteras, reveals a spokesperson for Steeljunction, on the Bypass connector, also open till late.

 Making their way into the Dhanteras shopping list are cars, crockery and home appliances. It is a recent trend and growing stronger... People booking cars from the beginning of this month want them delivered on Dhanteras, said A.K. Mohanty of Ganges Ford, on Topsia Road.

 Dhanteras-Diwali is the time to buy more for the home. Electrical appliances, like coffee makers, food processors and mixer-grinders are popular, disclosed Rishabh M. Sanghvi of Rajaniklal, on Park Street.

 With capital purchases on Dhanteras considered auspicious, this year, the LCD and plasma sets are the most sought-after, followed by frost-free refrigerators and microwaves, said Jiten Chawla of electronics store Cams Corner.

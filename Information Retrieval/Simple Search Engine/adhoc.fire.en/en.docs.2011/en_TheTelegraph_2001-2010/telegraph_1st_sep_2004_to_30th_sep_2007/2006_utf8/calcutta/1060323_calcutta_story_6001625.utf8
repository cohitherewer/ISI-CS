 - Talk on latest developments

 Thirty years is a long period of time. And in these years, technology has made dramatic advances. So dramatic, in fact, that it has changed the world along with it, particularly in the ways we connect with each other.

 In the technologically-advanced nations of the West, the science of electronics had made a great impact on the arts scene way back in the early Sixties. Korean artist Nam June Paik, who was initially involved with music, was the Father of Video Art. He held his trailblazing exhibition in Germany in 1963, where he manipulated images shown on TV to create graphic designs. The video camera came in 1965.

 The ongoing exhibition on Video Art in Germany at CIMA Gallery traces the development of this form over 30 years up to the Nineties. 

 Art historian Anja Osswald, who is here to introduce viewers to video art, in a talk on Wednesday, continued from where the exhibition ends, fast forwarding to the present-day video artists. She illustrated her talk with clips from the best-known works, that helped the audience appreciate video art better.

 The clips clearly brought out the relationship between video art and music and rhythm, and, very importantly, time. In one, the artist held the camera as he ran through a garden, and a house, then up the staircase before the screen blanks out as he jumped off the house, all in real time, with the pounding of his shoes as the background score. Music was the instrument for making time audible. 

 In one work, the speed of a John Lennon song was being changed from to time, synchronising with the movement of the artist onscreen. At times she danced like a maniac when the music became a banshee?s screech. The image warped into a graphic design.

 Some of these videos compelled viewers to reflect on the term ?art?, whether it should be autonomous or if it should not allow viewers to reflect on the way they look at the world. The pieces also raised questions about identity and self-representation, illusion and reality. The three-part installation by a Japanese artist, in which the sounds of everyday actions were played, linked video art with John Cage?s philosophy of music. Even silence could be pregnant.

 Osswald said although the borderline between video art and film was breaking down, there was a difference in the ideological sense. Also, the context matters for videos are meant to be seen in a gallery. She introduced the Loop (works that have no beginning or end and can be viewed continuously) and 3 Minute (each work of that duration) projects.

 Mathew Barney?s ?sculpturesque? The Cremaster Cycle was the most spectacular in every respect. Osswald said such projects were as expensive as Hollywood productions. It was also a comment on why video art has never caught the imagination of Indian artists.

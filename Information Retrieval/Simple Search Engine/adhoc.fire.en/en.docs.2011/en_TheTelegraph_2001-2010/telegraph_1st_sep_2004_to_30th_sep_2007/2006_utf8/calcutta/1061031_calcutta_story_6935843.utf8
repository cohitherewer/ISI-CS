When they reach there, the grass is not so green on 

the other side. Models want to eventually become actors. Some use their careers 

and contacts as a stepping stone to the big bad world of Bollywood. Once there, 

they look back and miss the good ol days of modelling. 

Meet Aryan Vaid, model-turned-actor. Been there, done 

that and now he wants to do it all over again. I miss modelling. I miss 

after-show parties most, he says, in town for a Hidesign fashion show. 

But films are good too. Even though you dont 

have much of a life left after crazy shooting schedules and extreme climates, 

he adds quickly. 

Not at a good time to complain about films, he says 

because he is finally doing some sensible cinema (after Market, 

Mr 100%, Chahat). 

Sample the sensible cinema. There is Kings 

Cross, a love story set against the London bombing episode and Anil Sharmas 

Apney, starring Dharmendra, Sunny and Bobby Deol, together for the first 

time. 

Apney sees Aryan play the role of a boxer and 

had him undergo an intense eight-month training programme under Australian professionals 

and Tapan Das, a boxing champion. 

Now I know I can beat up any number of people 

if I choose to. My arms are raring to go, he adds. 

Deadly Deols vs Aryan does his role stand a chance 

at the editors table? Of course, I play an important character. He 

has grey shades, says Aryan, trying hard not to use the V-word. Not a good 

thing to play at this age and stage!

An age and stage that should speak of alliances and 

affairs. Affairs and link-ups are fine. In fact, most actors go get their 

link-ups publicised themselves. It feels good in the beginning but not any more, 

he says, hinting at the famous Manisha Koirala affair, not forgetting Keerti Reddy. 

Now I would rather date a regular person. At 

least theres more to the relationship. There is so much to talk about. With 

a celebrity girlfriend, one tends to discuss only work writer, music director, 

director Thats boring, he says. 

us, celeb girls also come with their share of the 

paparazzi. Yes, paparazzi can be annoying. It reminds me of the story of 

my marriage. It said that I was a divorcee and was splashed all over 

Ahmedabad and Mumbai. My parents, who were in America, read it on the Internet 

and were so shocked that they called me. They wanted to know about my hidden girlfriend 

in New York, he signed off.

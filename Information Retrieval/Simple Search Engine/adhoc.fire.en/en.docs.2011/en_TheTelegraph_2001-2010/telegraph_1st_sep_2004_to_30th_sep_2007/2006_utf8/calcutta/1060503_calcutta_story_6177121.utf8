The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 While passing by the Metro Rail construction site near 

 Garia, I was aghast to see massive concrete pillars being 

 constructed virtually in the middle of the Tolly?s Nullah, 

 which inevitably will lead to an ecological disaster. The 

 Tolly?s Nullah beyond Garia has been completely silted up. 

 It is the basic of bridge engineering that scouring and 

 silting of bed in any waterway leads to obstruction.

 S. Sarkar, Lake Road. 

 Extension of Metro Railway from Tollygunge to Garia was 

 sanctioned during 1999-2000. To minimise the obstruction, 

 we have adopted single circular column and which are on 

 pile foundation with the pile cap at a depth of 5-6 m below 

 the existing bed level as required by the irrigation department. 

 Besides, we have paid Rs 7.14 crore to the irrigation department 

 for deepening and widening the canal. 

 S.C. Banerjee, Sr PRO, Metro Railway.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Gwyneth Paltrow

 You are correct, courteous and far-sighted. You are money-wise and always think twice before spending. You are very punctual and have an uncanny knack of knowing how best to utilise your time. You dont like too many changes; for you, theyre a bother. Kusum Bhandari

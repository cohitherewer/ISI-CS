 Moms the word in Bollywood. Still. Roles of substance, characters that challenge, and co-stars who understand... that may all be there, but Big Momma must still accompany the new heroine into town. From festivals in Amsterdam to shoots in Rajasthan to promotions in Calcutta.

 So, on Saturday, while Ayesha Takia was busy explaining how much pain she took to get under the skin of her Rajasthani character in Dor, her mother was busy planning a true blue Bengali lunch ilish, chingri, the works.

 With mommy is brother dearest, Nagesh Kukunoor. Yes, the director who didnt even know her before the film has become a munh-bola bhai for Ayesha after the 37-day shoot. She actually tied a rakhi on his wrist, which left the matter-of-fact maker of Hyderabad Blues quite moved.

 In the middle of this mutual admiration society is Shreyas Talpade, who is no longer mute. Iqbal claims the boy in him has become a man with Dor, a 180 degree departure from my first film.

 He went on to talk about maintaining character graphs during shooting schedules and how the changing face of Indian cinema is ready to accept him in different characters.

 I can now be M. F. Husain, announced Shreyas, who will play the barefoot painter in the maestros auto-biopic. I can be Venkatesh from Hyderabad in Main Phir Aaunga, he added. Venkatesh was the 24-year-old national-level chess player who demanded euthanasia before dying of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

 Besides these real-life characters, Shreyas also has his dose of naacha-gaana with Sangeeth Sivans Apna Sapna Money Money and Ananth Mahadevans Agar. 

 Ayesha has had her fill of reality bites for now with Naseeruddin Shahs Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota and Dor. She will next be seen in out-and-out masala movies like Nikhil Advanis Salaam-e-Ishq, Ahmed Khans Fool and Final, E. Niwass De Taali and N. R. Pachisias next production Kya Love Story Hai. I am really looking forward to Salaam-e-Ishq which is a really loud commercial film, she smiled. 

 But before all that, its all about the extended family, about the threads that bind.

 Panic in bomb call wake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Panic gripped Industry House, on Camac Street, on Thursday morning after an anonymous caller informed an office in the highrise that a bomb had been planted there.

 People and shop-owners in the area downed their shutters and started fleeing, amidst the pandemonium that continued for over a couple of hours. 

 A large poss of police, accompanied by a dog squad, reached the spot and evacuated people from the 21-storeyed building. A two-hour search, however, yielded nothing.

 It was a hoax call. Fortunately, the panic did not lead to a stampede, as our officers evacuated the people in time. No one has been arrested, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Ajoy Kumar.

 Around 11 am, an employee of Kamal Trading, an office on the 17th floor, received the anonymous call. The caller said a bomb planted in the office would explode at 3 pm. 

 He immediately contacted his seniors and Shakespeare Sarani police station. The news spread like wildfire and employees of other offices in the building started fleeing.

 As soon as we got the information, 

 we alerted officers of the detective department and the 

 special branch. Accompanied by a dog squad, the cops arrived 

 within half-an-hour. By then, people were fleeing the area,said 

 additional officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police 

 station Munshi Abdul Ahad.

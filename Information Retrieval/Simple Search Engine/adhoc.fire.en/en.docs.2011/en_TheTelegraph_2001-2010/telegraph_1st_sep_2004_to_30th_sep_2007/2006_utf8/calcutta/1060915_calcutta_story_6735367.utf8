 HIV intervention agenda at hotels

 - Condom dispensers, workshops planned

 Buladi: Safety drive

 The success of the Buladi campaign has encouraged the state health department to take up a novel HIV intervention programme. 

 The plans for the first phase of the scheme include installation of condom-vending machines in 50 hotels in central Calcutta. Workshops and seminars will also be organised at these hotels as part of the project.

 We need to reach out to every section of society, so why avoid hotels? In fact, prostitution rackets are thriving in many hotels and lodges in the city. We have shortlisted some hotels in central Calcutta, where we will launch the programme. We want to gradually extend its reach to other parts of Bengal, said Rajiv Shukla, project director of the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society. 

 The society will train about 40 men and women as part-time peer educators for the project. They will hold the workshops and seminars for the benefit of the managers of the hotels, their staff and sex workers. Two mobile clinics, comprising doctors, will visit the hotels and their neighbourhoods regularly for HIV tests and counselling.

 The state government has sanctioned a grant of Rs 20 lakh to Calcutta Samaritans, the NGO that will implement the project in central Calcutta. The NGO to cover south Calcutta has not been selected yet. Once thats done, a similar programme will be taken up in hotels and lodges in the south.

 Before drawing up the blueprint, we had conducted a sample survey in collaboration with the AIDS control society. We held talks with a number of hotel-owners and managers, apart from sex workers and their clients. We realised there is great a risk of HIV spread through unsafe sex in these hotels, stated Sabir Ahmed, project coordinator, Calcutta Samaritans.

 We have plans to tie up with the tourism department to spread the programme across Bengal, said Mahesh Nathan, project coordinator of the AIDS control society.

 There can be no doubt that the local market for paintings is expanding phenomenally. It is the signature that really sells and galleries have been mushrooming all over the city, with owners bending over backwards to persuade big names to hold their exhibitions in their charmed space, even if it happens to resemble a warehouse without any frills.

 For good enough reason, gallery owners have been wary of sculpture for the simple reason that it does not sell. 

 But in the recent past, a gallery opened in New Alipore with an exhibition devoted to sculpture, some by past masters. And now, Aakriti Art Gallery, on Hungerford Street, will open a new section exclusively for sculpture on August 12. Sculptor Nagji Patel will inaugurate the exhibition.

 Apart from the space being quite large, the first thing that would strike the viewer is its beautiful lighting. Thanks to sophisticated programming, it can be regulated according to the needs of a particular exhibition or even a particular exhibit. So, while the room can look sunlit as if it has an atrium, it can also take on a more intimate look isolating works according to need.

 Two of the best-known sculptors on exhibition will be Nagji Patel and Satish Gujral. Both of them make extensive use of stone as well as metal. 

 The other senior artists are Uma Siddhanta, Bipin Goswami, Biman Behari Das, Manik Talukdar, Tarak Garai and Janak Jhankar Narzary. 

 Among the sculptors of the next generation are O.P. Khare, Sunil Kr Das, Aku, Gopinath Roy, Rajender Kr Tiku, Bimal Kundu, Madan Lal Gupta, Shymal Ray, Pankaj Panwar, Atul Bhalla, P. Rajivanayan.

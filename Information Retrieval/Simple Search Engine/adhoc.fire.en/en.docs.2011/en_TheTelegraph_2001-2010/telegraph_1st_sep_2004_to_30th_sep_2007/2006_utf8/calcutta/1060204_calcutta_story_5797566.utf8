The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fast for health hub

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Residents of Badartala, in Garden Reach, will observe a ?fast-unto-death? from the afternoon of February 12, demanding ?immediate upgrade? of Garden Reach State General Hospital.

 The residents, under the banner of Garden Reach Nagarik Parishad, had organised several demonstrations and even called a bandh to draw the authorities? attention to the ?poor state? of the hospital, but nothing has changed.

 Hence, the decision to sit on a ?fast-unto-death? at Kachhi Sarak More, said Kushal Debnath, assistant secretary of the Parishad. ?We are yet to get a reply to our January 26 open letter to local CPM legislator and state labour minister Mohammed Amin. We are feeling quite helpless.?

 The foundation stone of the hospital was laid in 1990 by then chief minister Jyoti Basu. The outdoor department was opened seven years later and the indoor facility, after another three years.

 The government had promised that the hospital would have 131 beds, an operating theatre and facilities for paediatric, gynaecological, dental and ENT treatment. 

 ?In reality, it has only 10 beds. The emergency ward, operating theatre and paediatric, maternity, X-ray and pathology departments are yet to come up. The dental department exists only on paper,? said Ashim Chakraborty, another resident of the area.

 There are only six doctors on the 21-member staff and they hardly get an opportunity to treat patients because of a lack of necessary equipment.

 The hospital now provides only saline drips and first aid, the residents alleged.

 Chief medical officer of health (South 24-Parganas) Pradeep Kumar Mondal said he was aware of the problems and claimed to have brought them to the notice of the authorities. ?What is even more shocking is that a police station (Nadial) has come up on a part of the plot earmarked for quarters of the doctors and nurses,? Debnath said.

 Reacting to the complaint, inspector-general of police (South Bengal) Vageesh Mishra said it was a temporary arrangement. ?The police station will be shifted the moment we find a suitable site.?

 Dilip Sen, secretary of CPM?s Garden Reach zonal committee, admitted that the hospital is in a serious condition. ?However, so far as I know, the PWD has sanctioned Rs 1 crore for renovation.?

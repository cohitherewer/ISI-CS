 What brings the Kenzo team to Calcutta?

 We come to India quite often; in fact, this is my sixth or seventh visit to this country. We visit fashion houses in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta to look for designs and fabrics. We use a lot of designs and textiles from Calcutta in our collections.

 What exactly do you look for in India that you dont 

 find elsewhere?

 We primarily come to India to look for two things embroidery and fabrics. India, particularly Calcutta, is very rich in embroidery and we source a major part of our threadwork from here. We also source a lot of silks and cottons from this country that are used extensively in our pret lines.

 And why the strong Calcutta connection?

 While Delhi and Mumbai are good for finished garments, Calcutta is good with threadwork combined with beads, sequins, Swarovski crystals and such special things. A lot of similar embroidery these days are done in China, too, but that look is very flat and cheap. But Indian embroidery is of high quality and hence we source them for our high-end lines. We also source embroidery from Peru, but that again is mostly wool work and looks very simple and different. Calcutta is also strong with fabrics, especially different kinds of weaves.

 What do you think India lacks when it comes to design?

 I feel the quality of stitching and finishing is quite deficient in India. They might make a beautiful silk nightdress with elaborate work, but not a perfect simple cotton shirt; thats where the lack of good finishing shows. 

 The reason may be because embroidery has been there in the countrys culture for a long time, but stitching came much later. But even that is improving now, they are learning from international exposure gained through so many big global brands that are coming to India to get work done. 

 And Indians, I must say, are very fast learners. We have seen that they understand and adopt new techniques very fast, whereas, in others places like Indonesia and Morocco, we face a lot of difficulty to make them understand and learn anything new. 

 Does Kenzo see India as a potential market? Would you 

 like to have a retail presence here?

 We are expanding to many other countries like Taiwan etc, so a shop might happen in India in the next few years. But one thing that doesnt suit the spirit of Kenzo is to have shops inside big hotels. Most of the international fashion brands that have come to India are housed inside hotels. I realise its difficult to have a store on a Delhi or Mumbai street and sell a 3,000 euro dress, while the local store next to you might sell something for Rs 3,000. The price points make it difficult for premium global brands to have stores in Indian high streets, and hotels are the only option. But the house of Kenzo wouldnt like that.

 What is the ideal model for Kenzo stores?

 For Kenzo, the store has to reflect the spirit of the brand. For instance, the concept store that we opened in Place des Victoires in Paris is more like an art. It is the brainchild of our womens wear designer Antonio Marras. He wanted the store to look minimalistic, so that a customer doesnt see racks full of clothes stacked all around. The concept of the store the placement of the mannequins, the clothes, the sense of space everything is quite unique.

 Whats the Kenzo look for the coming seasons?

 Each season, we have a number of looks for our various sections like womens, mens, childrens, pret, couture and so on. For this winter, the pret look derived influences from China and Vietnam and the spirit was that of mixed fabrics. 

 For the coming summer, the look is soft and romantic, pastels and ecru that move on to black-and-white. Right now, we are working on our fall-winter 2007-08 look. But the basic design philosophy of Kenzo remains in all our looks the spirit of colours and mix of elements like embroidery, textiles and techniques.

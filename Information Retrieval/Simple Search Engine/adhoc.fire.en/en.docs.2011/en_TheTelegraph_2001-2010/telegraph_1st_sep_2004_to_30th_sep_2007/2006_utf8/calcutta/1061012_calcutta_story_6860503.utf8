The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I wanted Yeh mera dil to belong to me

 From seducing Shah Rukh and romancing Shahid to befriending Konkona and admiring Aamir... KAREENA KAPOOR shares it all with Pratim D. Gupta during a two-day trip to her Yuva city

 Does Calcutta still mean Yuva to you?

 I keep coming to the city for product promotions and other events but for me Calcutta will always be memorable for Yuva. The film will remain a pivotal part of my career. I not only got to work with Mani (Ratnam) Sir but also got to portray such a good role.

 You shot a lot on the streets

 Yes, thats what made it a great experience. The script was such that I got to travel and move around in Metro and trams. You know, I got a feel of the real Calcutta. When you shoot in a different city, you dont get such opportunities. But Mani Sir made that possible.

 This time youre here for a jewellery exhibition. Are you 

 a diamond person?

 I guess all women are fond of jewellery and the diamond is a girls best friend. I love the kind of work Shobhaji (Shobha Asar) does with her jewellery. They are very classy, very traditional. She uses a lot of emeralds and rubies. Emerald today is being considered a womans lucky stone. And she has lots of women wearing her jewellery. The Mumbai exhibition went off extremely well and here I am in Calcutta.

 Your Don song Yeh mera dil has become a rage, 

 all over again. But were you sceptical when you agreed to 

 do an item number for the first time?

 I was not really sceptical of the song but I wanted to get Yeh mera dil to belong to me. I wanted my name to be associated with the song once the film released. Thats what drove me to do the film. And it was a great experience. Of course, I have not been able to do it like Helenji did in the original Don, but I have done it in my way.

 The song has been received very well despite the different 

 set-up

 Once the film releases on 20th, people will understand why Yeh mera dil has been shot so differently from the original sequence. See, the whole setting is so modern the dance, the lighting, everything I am sure it will leave a mark with the audience.

 Farah Khan is very impressed with your moves

 Shes the finest we have. And shes done a great job with the song. Most of my best work has been with Farah, whether its Asoka or K3G (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham) or Don. Doing Yeh mera dil with her was completely rocking.

 Are you a part of the Don fan club, too?

 Absolutely. I have grown up watching Don. But this Don is a completely new movie, yet its a tribute from all of us in so many ways.

 You have always said that you are the biggest fan of Shah 

 Rukh Khan. What was it like seducing him?

 Oh, as a fan it came pretty easily (laughs). But Shah Rukh is just great, he makes things so very easy. He brings an amazing energy and positivity to his films. I just saw Don the day before yesterday and I couldnt imagine anyone else in the role. He is too good.

 Earlier in the year, Omkara must have given you a 

 taste of different cinema

 Omkara was a pathbreaking film and I really believe that it helped Indian cinema take its next step forward. When you count the best films of 2006, you cant leave out Omkara from Rang De Basanti and Lage Raho Munnabhai. The film will be a proud part of my career. Desdemona was always such a dream role.

 Were you a little unhappy with the audience response?

 I understand that the audiences had a problem with the diction and found the lingo too tough. But I am happy that Vishal (Bhardwaj) dared to do something so different. He should at least be given credit for entering a dangerous zone.

 So many of your Omkara scenes were with Konkona Sen 

 Sharma. How was she like as a co-star?

 After the film, we have become really good friends. We go to the same gym in Mumbai and we also have the same trainer. When we were shooting all those scenes in Omkara, it never felt for a moment that we were two actresses. We always were two characters. Konkona is a lovely person and lovely actress and thats a deadly combo.

 Of your films with Shahid, 36 China Town worked, 

 Chup Chup Ke didnt

 Yes, 36 China Town was always the hotter film of the two. It was a film for today. The promos, the music, Shahid, it was really the more hyped film and it did well.

 Was it a relief that after the dismal Fida, your 

 on-screen pairing with Shahid was accepted by the audience?

 It sure was but we need to do a love story together. We have acted in romantic films but we want to do a pure out-and-out love story. We are just not getting the right script for it. We have not consciously taken up all the films that have been offered to us together because we do not want to do run-of-the-mill stuff.

 Milenge Milenge is still there

 I dont think so. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I think the film has been stalled temporarily. When it will get done and when it will come out, it looks very bleak.

 Is marriage with Shahid on the cards?

 No. My hands are too full to even remotely think about marriage.

 Not in the next five-year plan?

 Not even in the next five years.

 You must be looking forward to Lajjo

 Mani Ratnam and Aamir Khan isnt it the biggest combo in recent years? The two of them are so creatively ahead of me as human beings. I get really scared, you know, whenever I think about it We start shooting in January.

 You have always come out in the open as a big fan of Shah 

 Rukh. What do you think of Aamir?

 Words would fall short if I try to describe Aamir. He is undoubtedly Indias finest actor and, like always, with Rang De Basanti, he has again done Indian cinema proud. I have seen the film six times. Aamir is one actor who is irreplaceable, he is unique. And to do a film with him, that too a title role, is just amazing.

 Zoya Akhtars film will bring you back with Hrithik Roshan 

 after Yaadein

 Its not really an out-and-out romantic film. It is more of a fun film, an entertaining fantasy. We start that film in April next year.

 You are doing another item number after Don

 Its for a film called Kya Love Story Hai which has Tusshar in it and is being made by friend, whom we have known for 10 years. If I do the song, it will be just a favour, something for a friend. There have been people who have stood by me and I want to stand by them too.

 What has stopped you from doing a Bengali film?

 (Laughs) I have never been offered one. I think the language will be a problem because I cant speak Bengali and I wouldnt like someone else to dub my voice. So maybe if some day I learn the language I can do a Bengali film. I was offered (Rituparno Ghoshs) Raincoat, though, but I had date problems then.

 What about sister Karisma? Are you two planning some film 

 together?

 No, no, she is too busy with her baby. So no comeback has been planned as of now.

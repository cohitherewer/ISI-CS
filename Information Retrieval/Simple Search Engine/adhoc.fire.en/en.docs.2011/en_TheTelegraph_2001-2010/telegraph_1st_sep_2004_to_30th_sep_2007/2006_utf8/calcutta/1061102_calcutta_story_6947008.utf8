A day after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee assured full support to the Ghoshes in Bally, Sharmistha, accompanied by mother-in-law Supti Ghosh and brother-in-law Chandrajit, visited Writers Buildings to meet officials in the chief ministers office. 

 As Bhattacharjee was away in Purulia, Sharmistha met his private secretary, Sailesh Mukhopadhyay, and left a letter for the chief minister. 

 We were told the chief minister himself is looking into the matter. In our letter, we have expressed our gratitude to him for coming out in our support. We have also requested him to help us in getting justice, said Prasenjits brother Chandrajit.

 A gang of CPM activists roughed up Prasenjit on October 26 after he protested his wifes harassment by Krishnendu Halder, a CPM supporter. 

 Police arrested Krishnendu and two other accused in the case, Kishu Bhaduri and Rana Ganguly. Three other accused Sudeb Guha, Rabi Bose and Shankar Maitra in the case, are yet to be arrested. 

 On Wednesday, Halder, Bhaduri and Ganguly were produced at the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah and granted interim bail. 

 The Ghosh family was upset with the verdict. They have got bail while the others are yet to be arrested We can only hope that the investigation is on the right track and we will get justice, said Sharmistha.

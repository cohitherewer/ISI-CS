 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of the paintings on display. Picture by Rashbehari Das

 At one time, Shuvaprasanna used to paint nightmarescapes of Calcutta with its dark, lowering skies, an endless vista of roofs, countless ghostly lights burning inside cramped flats. 

 These paintings evoked very effectively the stifling, claustrophobic atmosphere of the city in the late Sixties and early Seventies, when the Naxalite movement was at its bloodiest, and decapitated human beings and statues were a common sight here.

 Shuvaprasanna, who used to live near College Street in those days, painted sights still familiar in north Calcutta, such as a cacophonous meeting of crows on terraces. In another series, he had painted the many moods of a corvid, looking wryly at the viewer.

 These paintings of the bird, that deserves to be the city?s mascot, were sketched with a wit and humour that reminded one of the ancient winged creature with a raucous cry who happens to be a central character in three novels by a Bengali writer currently caught in a controversy. 

 Shuvaprasanna?s earlier works were, thus, rooted in the here and now, in a city where dreams and realities were difficult to separate from one another.

 If Shuvaprasanna?s current exhibition at ITC Sonar Bangla is anything to go by, the artist seems to have undergone a radical change, and has acquired a new face, like the city in which he lives allegedly has. Shuvaprasanna has opted for a bright and colourful new look, which has no place for the greys and blacks that dominated his earlier canvases.

 The entire series centres around the Radha-Krishna theme that would appeal to viewers from all walks of life, without taxing their brains much. Blue and yellow are the colours that dominate his palette and he uses them with skill to create striking contrasts.

 Although he has given the figures a contemporary look by his arrangement of limbs, particularly the heads of the two protagonists, in essence his paintings hark back, if only in their figuration, to the miniatures in which every generation finds a new meaning, and the minutest details are like grains of sand in which one can discover a world. 

 An art gallery has brought out a very well-produced book on these paintings, as pretty as a picture.

 A ghostly tale

 Based on a novel by Syed Mustafa Siraj, Manus Bhoot is a comedy that contends with common human vices like dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed for wealth. After cremating and performing the funeral rites of Batakesto, his family members are naturally startled when he suddenly appears before them in person. When Nibaran, a creditor, sees Batakesto when he comes to the house to recover his dues, he thinks he has seen a ghost. He is so frightened that he loses consciousness. Upon seeing this, Batakesto begins to pretend that he is a real ghost and tries to scare the wicked village-chief and his henchmen into returning him his wrongfully forfeited property and assets. Terrified, these men call in an exorcist to drive away the spirit of Batakesto. Obviously, the exorcist fails to do his job. Finally, the village-chief is forced to return Batakestos wealth and possessions to him, after which Batakesto mysteriously disappears from the village. Direction: Samir Biswas.

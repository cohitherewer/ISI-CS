 Passing Through

 Call of camera and comedy

 Parsis and Sardars are the only 

 two communities that can crack jokes about themselves, smiles 

 actor Boman Irani. In town on Friday for Teachers 

 Highnights, a prelude to Teachers Achievement Awards, 

 the actor regaled Calcutta audiences with spoofs on Parsis.

 I have a deep respect for 

 the Parsi community. I owe a lot to it, in terms of my principles 

 and values, Boman tells GoodLife. 

 I have received a lot of 

 flak from the Parsi community because of my performance 

 in Being Cyrus. They thought it showed Parsis in 

 a bad light, but that was not the intention, he asserts.

 For a man who loves to observe 

 human behaviour, photography seemed almost a natural choice 

 of career. Having captured on reel some of the most beautiful 

 faces in the glamour world, Boman maintains that beauty 

 pageants are no cakewalk.

 I have travelled to small 

 towns to select contestants. Trust me, it requires extreme 

 confidence to mug up those saintly answers and walk around 

 in a bikini when some of these girls had entered the contest 

 wearing awkward clothes and horrible make-up.

 But a full-time career in photography 

 went on the blink as the arclights beckoned. I have 

 been extremely fortunate to have been in front of and behind 

 the camera. That has helped me portray my characters better, 

 feels Boman. 

 In his debut stage act in Roshni, 

 Boman was directed by Alyque Padamsee. Vidhu Vinod 

 Chopra had noticed me then and told me that I wouldnt 

 be able to give him dates later. Indeed, thats what 

 happened after Munnabhai MBBS, he smiles.

 A string of theatre performances 

 followed, the highlights being Im Not Bajirao 

 and then Mahatma Versus Gandhi, for which he shed 

 24 kg to look the part.

 With Lets Talk, shot 

 entirely in digital format, Boman made his first foray into 

 tinsel town. Exciting times await the actor with five films 

 lined up for release Lage Raho Munnabhai, Khosla 

 Ka Ghosla, Don, Eklavya and Honeymoon 

 Travels Pvt Ltd. 

 I wasnt born with 

 a flair for comedy. I do my own thing; people find it funny, 

 insists Boman. Not every film is Munnabhai MBBS, he 

 knows, as its not imperative for every film to do 

 well at the box office. But I should enjoy being a 

 part of the process of filmmaking. Only if I get to learn 

 something from it, only if it enriches me will I then be 

 pleased to be part of the project, he says.

 Take for example Pyare Mohan 

 and Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota. I have tremendous 

 respect for Naseeruddin Shah. When he called me up, I didnt 

 even ask him about the role. I just went on the sets and 

 thoroughly enjoyed the one-and-a-half days I spent shooting. 

 On the sets of Pyare Mohan, I met some lovely young 

 people like Fardeen (Khan), Esha (Deol) and Viveik (Oberoi). 

 I hurt my knee so badly that I still cant walk straight. 

 But I have had fun and thats what matters to me at 

 the end of the day.

 But what about the photographer 

 in him? Of course, thats very much happening. 

 I wouldnt like to divulge details but I am shooting 

 people these days, reveals Boman. 

 I draw inspiration from 

 all those people who can rise above mediocrity. Art and 

 culture is a strong medium for a renaissance and there are 

 enough people around us who can bring about that change.

 When hes not pursuing his 

 passions, Boman is at home with his wife and two kids. I 

 treasure the moments I spend with my family. In the end, 

 I would like to be remembered as a good family man. And 

 a good Parsi as well, he signs off, with a smile.

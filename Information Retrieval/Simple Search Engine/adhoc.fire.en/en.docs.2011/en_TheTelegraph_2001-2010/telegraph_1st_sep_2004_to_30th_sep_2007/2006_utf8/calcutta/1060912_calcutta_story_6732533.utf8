 Wife relives fateful day

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The trial of doctor Sushil Pals murder began on Monday with the Howrah district and sessions judges court recording evidence by his wife Kanika.

 Pal, 45, attached with Walsh Hospital in Serampore, went missing on July 2, 2004. His body was found in a canal at Sankrail, in Howrah, the next day.

 Judge Shankar Coari recorded a part of Kanika Pals evidence. She recounted the chain of events after her husband left home for the Serampore hospital around 8 am on July 2, 2004. The court will record another part of her evidence on Wednesday, said special public prosecutor Asoke Bakshi. 

 The CID had taken over investigation of the case. A CPM leader of Bally, in Howrah, and a woman doctor are among the 13 accused in the murder case. 

 According to Kanika, Pal had left the couples residence on Bright Street, in Calcutta, with a bag containing his cellphone, its charger, his identity cards and stethoscope. 

 Around 11 am, he told Kanika over the phone that he was in Rishra, from where he would go to Konnagar on his way to Serampore.

 During another phone call around 1.30 pm, she heard him talking in a raised voice with some people. Sushil had, however, told her that it wasnt important and that he would be back home around 5 pm. 

 When the doctor did not return by 5.30 pm, Kanika tried to call his cellphone but found it switched off.

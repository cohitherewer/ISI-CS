The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bond, not just bruised but cut

 - Four scenes snipped from Casino Royale Indian release for U/A tag

 A still from Casino Royale

 Shes walking on the beaches in a green bikini. Hes emerging from the waters in a blue boxer. A look and a couple of one-liners later, he asks her to come and have a drink... Cut, to him lying on the floor, and she atop him, all passions spent. Thanks to the Indian censor board, whatever happened in between is anybodys guess. Even in a James Bond film.

 Not just one, but four scenes in the new 007 film Casino Royale amounting to two of the 144 minutes screened worldwide have been chopped off from the Indian release. The official word from Sony Pictures India, the national distributor of the film, is: (U/A) is a rating we wanted because this is too big a film to restrict to just adults and so we agreed to all the cuts that the Examining Committee asked for.

 So, dont go to the movies hoping to gape at the love-making scenes between Daniel Craigs James Bond and Eva Greens Vesper Lynd, first in the sea and then in a Venetian hotel suite. Not just that, even the action scene when villain Le Chiffre whips a naked Bond has been snipped off.

 The jump cuts done in Mumbai by the distributors are jarring to say the least, in the most bruising Bond film of all.

 Sony claims these minor cuts do not affect the crux of Casino Royale, a film which traces the very first assignment of Agent 007.

 But try telling that to a Bond buff. I go to watch a James Bond film for the sexual appeal. For me, its a high-powered sex-and-violence film franchise, says film-maker Anjan Dutt. Ian Fleming did not write the Bond stories for children. All art is not meant for everybody. Why should I miss out the fun of an adult film?

 The 2002 Bond film, Die Another 

 Day, rode an A certificate and Halle Berrys bikini 

 to rake in more than Rs 5.35 crore in the first three days 

 in India. This is just double standards on the part of 

 the censor board, says Casino Royales east India 

 distributor Arijit Dutta. They allow everything on TV and 

 Internet and only when it comes to the best of international 

 cinema, they order the cuts. It happened with The Da 

 Vinci Code, and it will continue to happen.

 What: 

 A quiz for Harry Potter fans, celebrating the boy wizards 

 birth month.

 Where: Patchi, the chocolate and gift items store at Forum, on Elgin Road.

 When: Monday, 5 pm to 6 pm.

 Cast a spell: A strong sense of magical excitement filled the air at the packed store, as 20 young participants, between 10 and 13 years, were grilled through three rounds of direct questions, audio-visuals and rapid fire.

 Participants chosen on a first-come-first-served basis were split into four houses ? Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. With questions ranging from Harry Potter characters, movies, spells, adventures to magic, Patchi for a brief hour mirrored a tiny Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As expected, Harrys own house Gryffindor won the day.

 l participants won beautifully-wrapped boxes of handmade chocolates, robes, witches hats and magic wands. A special Patchi hamper was gifted to the best-dressed participant.

 Voiceover: It is heart-warming to see children gather for such an edutainment programme. Unfortunately, we had to deny many registrations due to the overwhelming response. We plan to come up with more such fun events for children, said retail division manager of Patchi, Piyush Bajoria.

 Sweet skin

 What: Launch of a new exotic chocolate facial and chocolate body-wrap.

 Where: Saajo, exclusive ladies health and beauty clinic, 40/1A Bhupen Bose Avenue (near Shyambazar five-point crossing).

 Take a look: Dark, creamy and irresistible, chocolate also possesses antioxidant qualities stronger than red wine and green tea, making it an antiseptic naturally rich in minerals like magnesium, potassium, phosphorus and vitamins. While sharing such lesser-known facts about chocolate, beautician and director of Saajo, Ruby Biswas demonstrated a chocolate body spa on model Shreya.

 Shreyas skin was first left soft and supple by chocolate cleansing milk containing aloe vera, cocoa powder and glycerine. A chocolate exfoliating scrub combining walnut granules, purified water and phenoxyethanol was then used to remove dead skin cells of the epidermis, adding radiance to the face. Subsequent application of chocolate massage cream, chocolate serum and finally a chocolate face-mask served to nourish and revitalise the skin.

 Pocket pinch: The chocolate facial is priced at Rs 750, while the body spa costs Rs 500.

 Voiceover: This new concept of using chocolate as a means of treatment and cure is catching on. The feel-good factor stems from the fact that chocolate is already looked upon as a natural sweetener and anti-depressant, said Ruby, adding that the next offering from the salon is an Intense Pulse Light Treatment for removal of marks and pigmentation.

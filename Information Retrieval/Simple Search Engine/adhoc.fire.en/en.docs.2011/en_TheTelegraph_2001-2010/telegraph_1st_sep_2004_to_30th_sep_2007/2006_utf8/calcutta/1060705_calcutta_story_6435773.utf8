 In a world full of attractions and enticements, man is engaged in perpetual pursuit to attain life?s pleasures. Not content with his achievements so far, he seeks to further his success by any means, even at the cost of overstepping others? aspirations. Thus, all men become participants in a race where they fiercely compete with one another in their urge to reach their coveted goal. Barasat Anusilani?s latest production, Chhut, plays out the story of such individuals, who are constantly running after something. Its plot revolves around Guru Sharan, who is well-known for his philanthropic activities. Having amassed great wealth, he now yearns for fame and glory. Jatin, in love with Guru Sharan?s wife, Bharati, seeks gratification of his passion. While some are in a hurry to avenge a misdeed, others have no idea what they are running for. The play ends with the realisation that it is foolish to run this race as it cannot end in happiness for anybody. Instead, it leads the audience to contemplate the possibility of walking hand in hand towards a common goal. Drama and direction: Romaprasad Banik.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Chhut, produced by Barasat Anusilani

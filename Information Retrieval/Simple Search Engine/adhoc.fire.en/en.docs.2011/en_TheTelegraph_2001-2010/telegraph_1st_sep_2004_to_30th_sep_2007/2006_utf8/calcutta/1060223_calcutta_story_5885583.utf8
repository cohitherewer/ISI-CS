Clued in on Clooney

Screen On amp; Off

 November 4 2004: On a four-lane highway in the desert, 100 kilometres from the surreal skyscrapers of Dubai, George Clooney is filming his penultimate scene for Syriana, the geo-political thriller that?s been dubbed one of the ?most un-Hollywood films that Hollywood has ever made?. 

 All morning Clooney has been leaping from his car, shouting in Arabic, to find himself surrounded by armed guards. The extras wouldn?t have known who Clooney was before arriving on set, so have no idea how successfully he has disguised his matinee-idol good looks under pounds of extra weight, a receding hairline, and a salt-and-pepper beard which he pulls on distractedly.

 Nor do they realise that he?s itching to be released from his role as Bob Barnes, the melancholic, middle-aged CIA agent caught unwittingly in the cross-hairs of history. ?In the beginning it was fun not being able to get tables at restaurants,? he grins, disarmingly, ?but (being overweight) is horrible for blood pressure and my back is killing me.? 

 In the process of putting on the weight, he even called his ex-girlfriend Ren?e Zellweger to ask how she piled on the pounds a second time to play Bridget Jones. ?But you couldn?t read this script and not want to be in it,? he says of writer/director Stephen Gaghan?s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Traffic. ?It?s about everything we should be concerned about: our addiction to foreign oil, the deconstruction of the CIA, corporate corruption.?

 Now that the film has come out to almost universal acclaim in America and Clooney has earned a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor ? and an Oscar nomination in the same category ? it?s difficult to recall the sense of risk that accompanied the ambitious, globetrotting production. The material was edgy and obeyed none of the usual rules of Hollywood, having morally compromised characters and confusing politics. 

 Clooney?s maverick production company Section Eight initiated the project by buying the book See No Evil, by the former CIA agent-turned-author Bob Baer, on whom his character is based. ?It?s not that we?re saying terrorism is excusable, of course it?s not,? he continues, ?but we have to look at where it comes from, what are the conditions that create it.?

 Section Eight assembled a distinguished cast ? Matt Damon, Christopher Plummer, Chris Cooper, Amanda Peet ? alongside Clooney, which helped the green light go on at Warner Brothers, but the labyrinthine script with its interweaving storylines led to an unwieldy production schedule. Gaghan admits it was a ?miracle? the film got made. With more than 90 speaking parts in various languages (including Arabic, Urdu and Farsi), Syriana was shot over five months in three continents.

 Several weeks before reaching the Dubai desert, Clooney found himself filming in the ancient Medina that hugs Casablanca?s coastline, with the call of the muezzin in the background and no one asking for autographs.

 ?It?s been a while since I?ve visited a Third World country and it makes a huge difference,? he admits. ?Locations inform what we do as actors. Here we are in Morocco and three times a day a siren goes off and everyone stops their cars, gets out in the middle of the street, kneels down and prays. I just wish more people in our country travelled more. They?d learn a lot about how hated we are.?

 Syriana is the first international production to film in Casablanca since terrorist bombs killed dozens of people in 2003, and security cost the production $1?5 million, even with the Royal Guard on loan from the King. Not that you would have known that Clooney had any safety concerns. 

 As the technical crew are organising a timed explosion on the Avenue du Far in the Jewish quarter, he kicks back his chair in the ropy catering tent, tells stories about pranks on Ocean?s Twelve and does hilarious impressions of George W. Bush. 

 When the production reaches the United Arab Emirates, the war in Iraq feels uncomfortably close, pundits in Washington talk about ?regime changes? in Iran and Arafat slips into a coma. All that and a US election as well. ?There?s so much going on at the moment,? admits Clooney, ?especially in the Arab community, and we?re in the middle of it. It affects what we do, I think, and hopefully shows on screen.?

 Syriana needed convincing Arab actors to play characters, from corrupt, ageing emirs to terrorists and princes. Extras came from one of the poorest souks in Casablanca for a scene in a madrasah, but most of the Muslim-speaking roles went to British actors. 

 Meanwhile, back on the highway, the sun is setting over the desert. The scene is wrapped and Clooney and the Iraqi extras are slapping each other on the back and hugging like old friends. They?ve brought their families to meet him and they?re taking pictures with their mobiles.

 Clooney?s legendary charm, I note, crosses borders, religious ideology, even gender. Possibly a far more effective method of exporting democracy than anything else America has come up with so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Monday meet to thrash out CAS

 - Agenda may be rollback rather than roll-out, say cable industry insiders

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 A meeting of conditional access system (CAS) stakeholders has been called next week, but the agenda could be more pushback than roll-out.

 Two weeks after the four-week deadline on implementing CAS was set by Delhi High Court, the information and broadcasting ministry has invited ?all stakeholders ? broadcasters, multi-system operators (MSOs), cable operators and consumer organisations? from across the country to discuss aspects of CAS implementation, in Delhi on Monday.

 According to sources, the meeting is a precursor to the Centre approaching the court ? which had ordered on March 10 that CAS be rolled out in metros within four weeks ? for an extension of the deadline by ?two to three months?.

 CAS is an addressability system for cable and satellite viewers, enabling them to watch and pay for the channels of their choice, the roll-out of which has been in limbo since 2003.

 A letter from the information and broadcasting ministry, which reached city MSOs, operators and consumer organisations in the past two days, mentions discussion of ?various issues relating to implementation of Delhi High Court order dated March 10, 2006, regarding CAS implementation? as the agenda of Monday?s meeting.

 The ministry is likely to take stock on the preparedness of the service providers and the approach of consumers towards CAS at the meeting, to be presided over by I amp;B secretary S.K. Arora.

 ?We will definitely be attending the meeting and if required, provide details of how prepared we are on CAS,? Dileep Singh Mehta of city-based MSO CableComm said.

 While MSOs may be preparing to submit their status report at the ministry meet, some other ?stakeholders? have been presenting their cases before Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the cable watchdog. 

 ?We met Trai last week and requested that channel and set-top box pricing be fixed,? said Mala Banerjee of Federation of Consumer Associations, who will not make it to Monday?s meeting.

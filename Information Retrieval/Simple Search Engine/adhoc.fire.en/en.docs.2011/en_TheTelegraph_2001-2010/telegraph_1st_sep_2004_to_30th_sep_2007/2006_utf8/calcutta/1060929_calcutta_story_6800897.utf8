 Malaria cloud on Puja

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Civic health officials fear an upswing in malaria and dengue cases in Calcutta during Durga puja and immediately afterwards, thanks to the frequent wet spells.

 After reviewing the situation at a meeting with health officials, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has asked chief municipal health officer Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay to the keep borough health units, civic dispensaries, central store and the vector control wing open during the Puja days.

 People suffering from fever during the festive days do not get an opportunity to get their blood tests carried out, as most pathological centres remain closed, Bandyopadhyay said. But prompt intervention is a must in malignant malaria and haemorrhagic dengue. So, we have decided to keep ward health units open during the Puja days.

 The rains have caused puddles across the city, that are ideal breeding grounds of both dengue-causing Aedes aegypti and malaria-causing Anopheles stephensi. The vector control wing has been directed to spray larvicide on the puddles. 

 Twelve people died of dengue and three of malaria last year. The toll in malaria and dengue this year has been one and three, respectively.

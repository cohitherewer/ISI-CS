The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

The foreign factor

Screen On amp; Off

 Freedom face: VJ Archana

 When so many Indians are trying to leave their swades for foreign turf, why are hordes of foreigners coming and settling in India? That is the theme of this year?s Channel [V] Freedom Express which will be telecast Independence Day onwards, on the popular music channel.

 The Channel [V] team will be travelling to cities, towns and villages across the Indian sub-continent to identify foreign communities, tribes and personalities who have settled in India and do not intend going back to their country. VJ Archana, a Calcutta girl, was in the city on Monday having already travelled throughout Gujarat, Varanasi and Mumbai.

 ?It?s been an eye-opener for me,? the leggy veejay, who won the Get Gorgeous competition a couple of years back, tells Metro. ?I have met all kinds of people, from African tribes speaking in Gujarati to Frenchmen setting up schools for mentally handicapped children in Varanasi.?

 In Calcutta, the focus has been on the Chinese community. ?Freedom Express has even helped me discover my hometown in an all new way,? adds Archana.

 The big one: Allianz Arena in Munich

 As host nation Germany kicked off the World Cup, here?s a look at the address where it all happened, and will keep happening till the semi-final on July 7 ? the Allianz Arena in north Munich. Discovery Channel is showcasing the most modern sports arenas in history, in Built for Champions. 

 The film is about their daring and ambitious architects, their mindful planners and the hard-working construction crews, without whose toil and ingenuity these masterpieces would never become a reality.

 On Tuesday at 9 am, viewers get to follow the planning and construction of the Munich stadium, where an estimated 65,000 took their seats for the opening game. The cost of the construction itself touched 286 million euros but financing costs raised that figure to a total of 340 million. 

 In addition, the city and State incurred approximately 210 million for area development and infrastructure improvement. There are four team locker rooms (one each for the two home teams and their opponents), four coaches? locker rooms and two locker rooms for referees. There are also 550 toilets and 190 monitors in the arena.

 BBC World, the BBC?s commercially-funded international 24-hour news and information channel, is turning pay from June 15. Besides India, the change would also affect viewers in the rest of South Asia. The price for the channel, which reaches over 15 million viewers in India, is being worked out.

 According to BBC, the transition to a subscription model was a ?natural progression? and in response to the ?dynamic and rapidly expanding cable TV and DTH satellite market? in the region.

 ?BBC World launched in South Asia back in 1991, at the birth of the cable market, particularly in India. In the summer of 2001, we launched our signal in digital format, to offer cable operators and viewers enhanced picture quality. Given the evolution of the South Asian cable and satellite market as a substantial subscription market, the next logical step has been to control our signal through encryption and initiate a pay strategy with our cable partners,? says Gerry Ritchie, regional director, distribution amp; business development, Europe, Middle East amp; South Asia.

 Despite regular trouble between broadcasters and cable operators over pay channels in India, the BBC does not foresee any problem in collecting subscription. ?We are a long-term player and with an experienced team of distribution professionals are determined to provide viewers and cable partners with a high quality, international news channel,? adds Ritchie.

 Modern classics: A moment from The 

 Dreamers

 The Italian Consulate, in collaboration with Nandan and Roopkala Kendro, is organising a retrospective of Italian films, scheduled for one week every month, till October 2006. The package for this month contains four films, to be screened from June 12-15, at Nandan II, at 3 pm and 6 pm.

 After Roberto Benigni?s Life 

 is Beautiful on Monday, Franco Zeffirelli?s Romeo 

 e Giuletta (Romeo and Juliet) is to be screened 

 on Tuesday. Zeffirelli?s 1968 version broke the long-standing 

 tradition of casting over-aged players in title roles. Seventeen-year-old 

 Leonard Whiting plays Romeo with 15-year-old Olivia Hussey 

 as Juliet. The film is one of the most lasting film adaptations 

 of Shakespeare.

 Day III features Le Chiavi 

 di Casa (The Keys to the House) by Gianni Amelio, 

 revolving around a young unwed father who after years of 

 neglect tries to form a bond with his disabled teenage son.

 June 15 screens Bernardo Bertolucci?s The Dreamers. The tumultuous political landscape of Paris in 1968 is the backdrop for the story about three young cinegoers who are drawn together by their passion for films. Mathew, an American exchange student pursuing his education abroad in Paris, befriends a French brother-sister duo, named Theo and Isabelle, sharing a common love of cinema. During the 1968 student riots in Paris, the three develop a relationship that is unlike anything Mathew has ever experienced or will ever encounter again.

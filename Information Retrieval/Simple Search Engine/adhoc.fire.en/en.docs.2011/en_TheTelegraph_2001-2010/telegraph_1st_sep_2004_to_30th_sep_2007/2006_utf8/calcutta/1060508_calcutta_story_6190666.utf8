 Though she has travelled extensively around the world, Sonja Weder has been particularly influenced by India?s opulent traditions. The predominance of striking natural colours in Indian customs and ways of life has contributed immensely to her creativity, enabling her to discover a unique style of painting. The ongoing exhibition of her works presents an exposition of her fascination for the magical colour combinations in nature; be it in plants, flowers and butterflies, or even in tiny creatures like catterpillars and dragonflies. Besides, Weder has also created exclusive designs and textures on her boards with materials directly borrowed from nature. Using real plant leaves and seeds as her tools, she has arranged and placed them on non-ferrous powders, hand-made papers and hand-painted boards. Actual husks and pods, that project out from her surfaces, take her paintings to the third dimension.

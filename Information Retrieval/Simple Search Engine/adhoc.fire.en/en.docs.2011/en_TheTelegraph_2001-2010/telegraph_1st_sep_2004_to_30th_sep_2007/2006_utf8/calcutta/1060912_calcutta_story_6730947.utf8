 Jobs rain on IIMC

 CHANDREYYE CHATTERJEE

 Students of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) are walking away with their dream jobs in just a year, rather than two. Thanks to Pre Placement Offers PPO in campus lingo that the companies use to shop from the set of summer trainees. 

 The numbers from the placement office suggest that PPO figures are steadily moving northwards. 

 IIMC students have a very high conversion rate when it comes to converting summer internships to PPOs. This holds true not only in case of Indian companies, even global companies are not waiting for the final placements and offering deals after summers, said Sanchit Jain, recruitment coordinaor, placement cell. 

 Management students have to do summer internships with companies after the first year of the two-year post graduate programmes. 

 While the PPO season usually commences from September across all campuses, the offers have started pouring in from all over the world from June, just days after the summer internships ended. 

 The numbers have already touched 35, with more than half of the companies yet to make their PPOs. We are confident that it will be much higher than last years tally of 40, added Jain. 

 IIMC, with its strong emphasis on finance and quantitative skills, is a happy hunting ground for investment banking majors, consulting companies, private equity firms and specialised finance companies. 

 Maintaining the trend, most of the PPOs this year are from companies like Lehmann Brothers, DSP Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. 

 The trend is very encouraging, as it reveals that the companies dont want to wait till the final placement and lap up the best students much before that, summed up Jain.

 Kingpin of job dupe gang held

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A gang of five has gypped six unemployed youths in the port area of over Rs 15 lakh by promising them jobs abroad, including in the US, Australia and Italy. 

 The kingpin of the racket, M.M. Fateh, was arrested at his Ripon Street office on Friday, but the other gang members are still at large.

 Some of the victims are postgraduate, yet they paid such huge amounts on being promised good jobs abroad, said an officer of South Port police station, which has been probing the case.

 The gang members, he added, would introduce themselves to the youths as officials of foreign missions.

 They met the youths during cultural programmes they organised in the port area about four months ago. The group convinced the youths that it could arrange jobs for them in the US, Australia and Italy. 

 Fateh asked them to submit their bio-data, which would be forwarded to consulate offices for immigration clearance, the officer said. 

 After a month, Fateh and his men approached the youths again, saying the visas would arrive in a fortnight and that they would have to pay Rs 3 lakh each in three instalments.

 The gang claimed the money would be needed to book plane tickets and to arrange for the youths stay at the place of work. The six youths paid the gang more than Rs 15 lakh in two instalments.

 There was, however, no word from the gang after the payment. When the youths went to Fatehs office on Rippon Street in September, they were told the schedule had to be postponed as the visa papers could not be readied in time. Fateh asked them to wait for another week, but the situation remained the same. The youths then lodged a complaint with South Port police station.

 Acting on a tip-off, our officers raided Fatehs hideout on Friday morning and arrested him, said Rajiv Mishra, deputy commissioner (port). We are trying to ascertain exactly how many were cheated by Fatehs gang, he added.

 The areas where the gang operated were Kidderpore, Metiabruz and Rajabazar.

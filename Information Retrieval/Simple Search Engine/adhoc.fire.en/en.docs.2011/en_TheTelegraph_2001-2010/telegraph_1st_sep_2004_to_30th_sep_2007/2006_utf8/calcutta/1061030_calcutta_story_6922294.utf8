 Enigma is only me

 MICHAEL CRETU TELLS PRATIM 

 D. GUPTA ABOUT HIS MUSIC, INSPIRATIONS AND INDIA 

 Music 

 Zone

 Michael Cretu

Anybody addicted to MTV in the 

 90s couldnt have possibly missed images of elephants 

 moving in slow motion in the background to curious Tibetan 

 boys running around. The magnetic music of Enigma used to 

 draw so many of us to the small screen. It was very much 

 the Return to Innocence.

 So, when Michael Cretu, the man 

 behind Enigma, agreed to do a phone interview from Germany, 

 it was an event all right. But five minutes into the conversation 

 and you realise that the event may not really 

 unfold as planned.

 When Enigma had a cult following 

 in the 90s, the album covers didnt mention anything 

 about the creator or his whereabouts and now when Michael 

 wants to come into the limelight its not easy.

 It was my wish in the beginning 

 to keep the music in the front rather than who is doing 

 it, he tells GoodLife with a heavy German accent.

 And so when you mention Enigma 

 as a band, the man flares up. Enigma is not a band, 

 Michael almost shouts. It is a project. It is only 

 me. Only some guest vocalists have featured in the albums.

 Posteriori

Despite attempts at different 

 kinds of music, Michael made a mark with Enigma. Enigma 

 is the platform of music I would like to be remembered for, 

 he says. It is like a solo project of mine. So, if 

 I was working with other artistes, I was completely free 

 to do what I wanted with their contribution.

 But from where did he draw the 

 sounds of Enigma, the trademark chants and whistles? There 

 is no basic inspiration, Michael says. It was 

 engineered like this. There was no concept as such. I was 

 playing around and I liked this sound. I wanted to buy music 

 like this but I couldnt because it didnt exist. 

 So I produced it myself.

 Sounding very scientific in his 

 artistic approach, Michael even defines the music of Enigma. 

 It is instrumental music with a human touch. 

 Period.

 But it has not always been so 

 2003s Voyageur was a total makeover for the 

 project. I have always tried to transform 

 the Enigma experience with new sounds and new kinds of music, 

 Michael explains. So, I have kept changing the sound 

 from one album to the other. From classical to sophisticated 

 pop songs, the sound has always changed.

 Hasnt that driven his fans 

 away? No, claims Michael. I think my fans 

 are now used to these changes and the response to the new 

 album has been incredibly good. The initial response makes 

 many believe that it is the best Enigma album.

 This album that Michael wants 

 to talk about is A Posteriori, the latest Enigma 

 compilation, which was released worldwide on September 26 

 on EMI. The collaboration with EMI has been good, 

 he states. Next year will be 25 years together with 

 them. They have respected and appreciated the music I have 

 made.

 With A Posteriori too, 

 Michael wants to take Enigma to a new level. I am 

 very happy with the results and to me it is one of the strangest 

 albums I have done, he elaborates. I call it 

 strange because it is completely different from what listeners 

 are hearing today, totally against all odds. Strange compared 

 to what is being made as music nowadays.

 And why call it A Posteriori? 

 It is a philosophic theory which says there are two 

 directions a priori and a posteriori, 

 Michael goes on. A priori means before and 

 a posteriori means after. A priori means that 

 the way of our life is pre-programmed before birth but a 

 posteriori says no, our life depends on how we behaved 

 in our lives, the conclusion of the experiences and knowledge 

 we learn day to day. 

 Michael wants to add to his experiences 

 by coming to India. I would like to come to India 

 as a tourist and not to promote my music, he reveals. 

 I wanted to come to India 

 twice. First time, the son of Indira Gandhi was shot dead 

 and there was total chaos. And then again I wanted to go 

 to Kashmir and they had riots there. So, each time I book 

 a ticket to India, something goes wrong in your country. 

 I hope that I am not bringing you bad luck! 

 While India plans can wait, he 

 is readying for a holiday to an undecided destination.

 A few weeks of holiday and 

 then again I will start some new project, Michael 

 whispers. Maybe I will just play around the studio 

 again and come up with a new sound.

 Enigmatic!

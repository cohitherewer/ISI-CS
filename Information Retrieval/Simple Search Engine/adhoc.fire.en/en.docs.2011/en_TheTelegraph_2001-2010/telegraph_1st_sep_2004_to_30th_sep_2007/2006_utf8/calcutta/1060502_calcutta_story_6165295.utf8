The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bus facility with shop stop, club

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 A Rs 100-crore, multi-utility bus terminus, the first of its kind in the region, will come up on 4.5 acres in Action Area I of New Town, Rajarhat.

 According to the plan approved by Hidco, the implementing agency of the township, a transport complex will come up on 1.5 acres of the plot for at least 50 buses, 20 taxis and 20 autorickshaws to be parked there.

 There will also be waiting sheds, booking counters, rest houses for passengers and bus workers, eateries, fast-food centres, shops and a medical centre. An auto-emission test centre is also part of the plan.

 An eight-storeyed building will come up on the remaining three acres. Two storeys will be underground, with a parking lot for over 200 cars. The 400,000 sq-ft-built-up area on the floors above will house a mall, departmental stores and vegetable markets. The top floor has been earmarked for a club.

 ?People tend to associate bus terminuses with ramshackle sheds of asbestos, paan and bidi shops and cheap hotels. The New Town terminus has been conceived and designed differently,? said R.K. Tripathy, managing director of Hidco.

 The project will be implemented by Bengal Greenfield Housing Development Company, a joint venture of the state housing board and Greenfield. 

 The company will pay for the project and run and maintain the terminus on the plot provided by Hidco.

 ?The target for completion of the project is by January 2007,?? said Tamal Bhattacharya, general manager, Bengal Greenfield.

 The initial plan was to only build a transport complex. But Hidco chairman and housing minister Goutam Deb insisted that the terminus also serve the purpose of a shoppers? stop and a leisure hangout.

 Officials said similar terminuses would come up in Action Areas II and III.

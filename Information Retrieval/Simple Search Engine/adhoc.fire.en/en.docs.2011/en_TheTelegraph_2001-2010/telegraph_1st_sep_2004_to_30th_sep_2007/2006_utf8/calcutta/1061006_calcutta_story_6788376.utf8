 Cardiac care, trauma tools

 - US doctors conduct workshop at city heart hospital

 SUBHRO SAHA

 What to do during the critical hour after a heart attack, the time which offers the best chance to help the stricken? How to keep the critical areas of the body still post-trauma, and make a patient breathe without moving the neck?

 In the mad scramble for medical excellence and super-specialised healthcare centres, the fundamentals in handling an emergency including the ABC (airway, breathing and circulation) is often forgotten or neglected, leading to needless loss of lives, lamented Stephen Becker.

 The emergency medicine expert and instructor of ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) from Mercy Memorial Hospital, Towanda, Pennsylvania, led a team of US doctors to the city recently which conducted a three-day workshop on ACLS and BLS (Basic Life Support).

 The workshop was held in association with Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) at its Mukundapur premises, off the EM Bypass, and attracted 51 participants.

 The objective was to bring to India the concept of an organised, evidence-based, protocol-driven approach to emergency care, Becker told Metro. He felt not just healthcare personnel and ambulance drivers, but everybody, including schoolchildren, should learn BLS skills.

 Childrens minds are so wonderfully open, that they can learn the basics in half a day. So, its extremely pertinent to take the programme to schools, Becker stressed. The city BLS programme dealt with initial assessment, identification and resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest.

 It was an eight-hour workshop with audio-visual (AV) demonstration and hands-on practice on manikins (like use of bag valve mask, defibrillators). On successful demonstration of the required skills, the candidates were awarded a BLS card from the American Heart Association (AHA).

 ACLS deals with continued resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest and entails use of advanced techniques like intubation and ventilation.

 It is mandatory to have a BLS certification to be eligible to enrol for ACLS and all levels of healthcare providers preferably allopathic doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians and paramedics can apply.

 It was a structured programme involving AV demos and scenario-based teaching, said course director Sujoy Ranjan Deb, deputy medical superintendent, RTIICS.

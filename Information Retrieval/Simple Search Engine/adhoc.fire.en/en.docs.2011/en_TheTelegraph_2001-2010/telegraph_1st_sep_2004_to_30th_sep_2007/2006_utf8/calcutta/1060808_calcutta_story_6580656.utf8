 For a festive splash

 ANUMITA GHOSH

 Model Bidita flaunts 

 an ensemble from Ksaras monsoon collection.

 What: Monsoon Temptation, 

 launch of a monsoon collection from designer label Ksara.

 Where: Prana, the designer 

 studio at 13/3 Ballygunge Circular Road.

 When: August 2.

 Take a look: The launch 

 kicked off with a fashion show. Models Jessica, Bidita, 

 Tanushree, Priyanka Kohli and Debbie showcased an array 

 of ethnic, casual and party wear. Jessica choreographed 

 the show. Aniruddha Chakladar was in charge of make-up.

 Says designer Shradha Saraf: I 

 have tried to incorporate contemporary and futuristic elements 

 in my collection. The collection is for women above 25, 

 women who understand and know their style well and do not 

 ape fashion trends blindly, smiled Shradha.

 The ensembles are not made for 

 the ramp alone. Muted tones, detailed embroidery, texturing, 

 controlled volumes, feminine silhouettes and smart necklines 

 make them a wearable collection. The fabric focus is georgettes, 

 chiffons, linens, cottons, muls, lycra and chiffon. 

 Lots of floral illustrations have been used along with big 

 polkas here and there. The look is accentuated with intricate 

 mukaish work, barakh prints, zari peppered 

 with lace, crochet and net.

 The colour story revolves around 

 toned-down shades of brown, peach, olive, mud green, yellow 

 and pale pink. A lot of white, off-white and unusual combinations 

 of brown and blue has been used.

 Saris embellished with nets look 

 sensuous. Capris with a khadi finish have crochet trimmings 

 at the end. When teamed with a white halter neck, the effect 

 is stunning.

 The kurtas have been paired 

 with trendy capris, well fitted churidars or even 

 stone-wash denims. Pinafore tunics with printed yolks look 

 attractive. Evening dresses have been jazzed up with crochet, 

 netted neckline and gorgeous waist bands.

 The collection is available at 

 Prana.

 Sip bite: 

 Guests sipped on wine and apple juice. In between chats 

 they dug into cheese and finger food.

 Voiceover: It is 

 a mature and sensuous line. It might be a monsoon collection 

 but is okay to wear all through the year, smiled Shradha 

 Saraf.

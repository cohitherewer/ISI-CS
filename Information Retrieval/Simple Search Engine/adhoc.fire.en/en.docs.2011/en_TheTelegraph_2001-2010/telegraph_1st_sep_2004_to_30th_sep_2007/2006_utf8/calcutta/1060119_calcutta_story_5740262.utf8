 Breathe easy: Sporting action on the Maidan greens 

 Apropos the report ?Mishap blame on errant adults?, January 3, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has cited two isolated incidents to make the point that pedestrians, rather than drivers, are responsible for most road mishaps. 

 If the commissioner had paid more attention to the chaotic condition of the roads, he would not have reached such a conclusion. More than 90 per cent of the accidents occur due to indisciplined driving and encroachment of footpaths by hawkers. 

 The authorities have lost all control over vehicle operators. When the administration in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai can keep drivers on a leash, why can?t their counterparts in Calcutta? 

 The first step towards that end would be to root out corruption in the police force. Unless that is done, all road safety measures would fall flat. 

 On a walk down APC Road, from Rajabazar to Maniktala, on January 3, I noticed that autorickshaws were rampantly violating almost every traffic norm. Some were even parked beside the road divider. Also, not a single bus passed through the bays marked for them. All this, while the cops sat in booths, spreading awareness about the traffic safety week, from January 2-8. 

 The situation is not much different elsewhere in the city. Buses racing to overtake each other at Kankurgachhi intersection and taxis and autorickshaws blocking the Mahatma Gandhi Road are only two instances of traffic rule violation that immediately spring to mind. 

 A couple of years back, someone wrote in The Telegraph that every week should be treated as road safety week, since just one week in a year cannot change the rule-flout habit of the people. Its heartening that the suggestion might soon be implemented with the traffic police deciding to organise road safety programmes throughout the year. 

 To improve the condition of the roads, the police should first rid the footpaths of encroachments, before starting to collect random fines from autorickshaws and private buses, which often violate rules knowing fully well that the transport department and police are helpless in prevent them.

 Apropos the report ?Day II: Beat the retreat?, January 13, it is good news for the Calcuttans that sense finally dawned on the army and it backed out of the plan to hold a three-day mela on the Maidan. Unfortunately, the move does not guarantee that there will no further onslaught on the greenery. 

 Appallingly, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee has already issued the passport to ravage the city?s lungs. What is more ludicrous is that after mauling the green in phases, thanks to two massive rallies, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas has engaged the comrades to repair the damage. Someone should tell the cadre that simply filling the holes and sweeping the ground does not constitute restoration. 

 Environmentalists can at best knock on the door of the judiciary. But that is unlikely to yield dividends with the implementing authority of the court?s decisions, the administration, unwilling to go against the party. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee,

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee might be trying his best to attract investment to the state, but is certainly sending out mixed messages. Meetings on the Maidan in addition to causing serious damage to the precious patch of green throws traffic all over the city out of gear. I don?t see how entrepreneur?s are going to be enticed by unending traffic snarls.

 The strength show by CPM at the Brigade Parade Grounds inconvenienced millions of people. Not only were there unending traffic jams, but buses were hard to come by on the road. Having said that, causing problems for people is a full-time vocation of the cadre and leaders. I sometimes wonder whether our country is really a democracy! 

 Mahesh Prasad, 

 RM Sarani. 

 Every political party, Left or Right, wants to show its strength at the cost of the Maidan. One need not be an environmental expert to figure out that the damage to the green patch during rallies cannot be undone by simply by clearing the grounds. What is most irritating is that the custodians of the Maidan, the army, does little to prevent this damage.

 Apropos the report ?Treatment hub for pets?, January 2, it is wonderful news that a state-of-the-art animal hospital is being set up in Mukundapur. Calcutta deserves a proper facility for treatment of our four-legged friends. I am particularly pleased that experts from abroad would come to share expertise with local veterinarians. However, the authorities must ensure that the fees remain within the reach of the middle-class. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Apropos the report ?Whip crack for car cards?, January 5, it is disheartening that only the owners of 1.23 lakh private vehicles have so far obtained smart cards. The number constitutes a mere 16.5 per cent of the total volume of private vehicles on the road. It is even more disappointing to consider that more than six lakh cars ply on the streets without tax receipt and other documents like pollution-under-control certificate.

 Apropos the report ?South meets North at Mishti Mela?, January 6, it gave me immense pleasure that such a unique event was organised by Anadabazar Patrika. There are towns and villages in Bengal that have been made famous by certain sweets. 

 While living in Shyambazar in the 1940s, I had the opportunity to taste Dwarik?s Abar Khabo, Ramlal Ghosh?s Rabri and Bhim Nag, Nakur and Girish?s Sandesh. In the 1970s, Poyodhi by Jalajog and Kachagolla sold in the Simla Street areas were quite famous. I hope the sweet festivals will acquaint the present generation with these and other famous items.

 The pictures published along with my article entitled ?Next weekend you can be at... Sunderbans?, January 8, were taken by Partha Pratim Saha.

 Contrary to the information in ?Gulf airline sets new date?, January 18, Royal Jordanian Airlines is operating from the city as per the normal schedule.

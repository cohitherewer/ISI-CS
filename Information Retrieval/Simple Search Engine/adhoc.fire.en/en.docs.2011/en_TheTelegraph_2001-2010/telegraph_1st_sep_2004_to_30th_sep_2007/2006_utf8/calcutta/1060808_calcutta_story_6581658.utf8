 brief. A Telegraph picture

The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has finally woken up to the need for restoring the verdant glory of the Maidan by removing the obstacles that have eaten up large swathes of green. Special attention will be paid to the vicinity of Shahid Minar, that was neglected in the past.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, spearheading the campaign for clearing the citys lungs, is off to Delhi to seek defence minister Pranab Mukherjees nod. The minister, along with transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, will meet Mukherjee on August 10 and brief him about his plans for the Maidan.

 Chakraborty had written to the defence minister in March, detailing his preliminary proposal for a greener Maidan. According to department officials, the first step in the proposal is removal of the bus terminus and commercial establishments from around Shahid Minar.

 We want the Maidan, especially the Shahid Minar area, to be green throughout the year. For this, we need to stop all commercial activity there. We will first remove the bus terminus and then the shops, stalls and the public toilets. The defence ministers approval is necessary, as the Maidan belongs to the military, transport secretary Chowdhury said.

 After the obstacles are removed, the government will take up the greening drive.

 It is not, however, clear whether Chakraborty will try to address the other problem plaguing the Shahid Minar area marches and rallies.

 Political gatherings and marches converging at Shahid Minar take place almost every week. Until these are stopped, it is not possible to keep the area green, said an official.

 Ferry service: Good news 

 for those availing of the ferry service between Calcutta 

 and Howrah. The transport department is buying 20 new vessels 

 with help from the Centre.

 During his Delhi visit, the transport minister will also meet Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and seek a special subsidy for buying the vessels. Currently, we have around 20 vessels, all of which are over 15 years old. We are seeking Rs 10 crore from the Planning Commission for procuring 20 more vessels, said Chowdhury. Each vessel will cost Rs 50 lakh.

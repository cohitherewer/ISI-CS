 Street smart

 A double-storeyed swank steel store, an exclusive leather boutique, a host of shops housing the finest of car accessories, a lifestyle store, banquet halls and convention centres? The list of names adding value to the Park Circus connector is growing by the day.

 Gone are the times when travelling down the connector at night was a strict no-no. And even if you had to after dinner at your favourite Chinese food haunt in Tangra, speeding past the stretch with car windows rolled up would be the norm.

 The fairly deserted stretch from Bridge No. 4 near Park Circus to the EM Bypass that previously took you not more than seven minutes is nothing less than a 20-25 minute drive these days, any time between 8 am and 8 pm.

 There was a time not so long ago when the Vishwakarma building was the only construction to catch your eye near the traffic lights at the junction of the Tospia Road and Park Circus connector.

 Stop at the same signal now and what greets you is the 23,000 sq ft two-level steel store steeljunction (a Tata Steel venture) that raised its shutters in December. Over the past few years, the stretch has emerged as the lifeline of the city connecting the eastern fringes of the city to the central business place. It has the potential to become the second business hub of the city, says Sumit Ray, chief (retail initiatives), Tata Steel.

 A few metres from the signal there is Mirania House stocking the finest of car accessories, behind which is the citys first exclusive leather boutique, Stanley which opened in February.

 This stretch is gradually becoming a one-stop destination for home decor. The ample availability of space enabled us to display our products as stylistically as we wanted. Besides, the nightmare of parking space also does not exist here, says Khagesh Agarwal, director of Stanley, the 5,000-sq-ft showroom.

 Easy warehouse facilities also make this part of the city a preferred location. Availabilty of space enabled us to set up our warehouse in the adjoining Topsia area. This obviously brings down transportation costs and helps in offering a more competitive price to our customers, smiles Ray, at steeljunction.

 The customer profile here is also distinctive. There is very little space for impulsive shopping, as most people are very clear about the kind of specialised, high-value purchase they want to make in this area, explains Ray. 

 Agarwal at Stanley is most bullish about the location. While the so-called business hubs of the city have reached saturation point, this area is still in its nascent stages with immense growth potential. For now, this zone is being identified as the best place to shop for home and vehicle requirements.

 From home decor to car accessories to meeting and eating. The Park Banquet and Convention Centre at Topsia receives a large number of bookings on a daily basis. Easy accessibility from any part of the city works greatly in our favour. With so many residential complexes and offices in the area, there are a large number of family and commercial bookings, says a spokesperson for the Banquet.

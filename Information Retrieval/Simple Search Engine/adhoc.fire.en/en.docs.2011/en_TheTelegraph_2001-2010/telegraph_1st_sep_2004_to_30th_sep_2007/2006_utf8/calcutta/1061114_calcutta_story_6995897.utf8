The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Accounts course for free

 - Four-month module for underprivileged students

 POULOMI BANERJEE

 To celebrate its seventh anniversary, The Institute of Computer Accountants (ICA) has announced a four-month, free training programme for 1,000 underprivileged students. The institute specialises in application-based training in accountancy and computing.

 Every year we get applications from underprivileged students and we try to accommodate some of them in our courses. We have now decided to do something for the underprivileged on a bigger scale and in a more organised manner, said ICA chairman N.K. Shyamsukha.

 His team members have informed the authorities of 1,000 colleges across India about the course. The institutions have been asked to send names of needy students. Most colleges in the city from Surendranath to St Xaviers have been contacted.

 The students will have to fill up a form giving details of their parents income. In the metros, those hailing from families with a monthly income less than Rs 4,000 are eligible. In towns, the cut-off is Rs 3,000 a month, said Shyamsukha.

 College students and those who have completed their graduation this year are eligible for admission. They can either contact the ICA office directly or through their college.

 The one-year course of the ICA, with a fee of Rs 25,400, has been condensed into the four-month free programme. The colleges have started getting in touch with us. The course will commence in December and continue till March. The students will get jobs by April, stated Shyamsukha.

 ICA has tie-ups with companies like ICICI. Our students are recruited by Reliance, Chirag, Genetic and Godrej. We do not need to enter into special agreements with companies for these students. Our existing industry contacts will be enough to secure employment for the underprivileged students, added Syamsukha.

 Getting jobs in this sector is not difficult. Every company needs someone who is good at accounts and knows the latest software, because accounting is mostly done on computer these days. They also need people with knowledge of the taxes and banking operations. At ICA, we try to equip students with these skills, he explained.

 Business process outsourcing companies are the best paymasters. In Calcutta, the average starting salary for ICA pass-outs is between Rs 3,000 and Rs 7,000.

 Brangelina, the reality show

 Sex amp; the city 

 Every move they make, every vow they break, Chandrima S. Bhattacharya is watching them. From the pout to the paparazzi, from the bother to the bodyguards ...

 Since Brangelina broke out on Indian soil, I have been following every movement of the couple and of Angelinas pout closely. Its like a reality show. I have got addicted.

 I know the names of the pigeons that Brangelina and their assortment of multi-ethnic kids fed at the Gateway (I really wanted them to adopt an Indian child; that would be too cool); I know the number of the Pune auto in which the gorgeous couple displayed their children before coming to Mumbai; and I know the timing of the local train that Angelina climbed into at Charni Road station only to get down at the next station, Marine Lines, to jump into another from there to reach Churchgate, the terminus, in three minutes flat. 

 (Though I dont know why she broke the journey. No one does its just two stations. Did the blind singer who does the afternoon shift between Mumbai Central and Churchgate start singing at her too?)

 But after the fracas with the bodyguards, its clear that Brangelina need to be saved from their Indian watchers and their bodyguards some defence. 

 I am not saying that its right to call Indians bloody or hairy or oily or samosa-eating. Thats racism. Any mention of an ethnic group/identity/nationality preceded by an adjective that you wouldnt use about yourself is racism, except when Bengalis are talking about other Indian communities! 

 Brangelinas bodyguards were execrable if they pronounced the words bloody Indians. But the pressure of facing Indian crowds and the paparazzi is huge. 

 In India, in the vicinity of a big-time celeb, desi or otherwise, when a brawl breaks out between the crowds or the photographers and the celebs minders, its often quite difficult to decide who is the victim, who the perpetrator, who the abused and who the abuser. Who Moby Dick, who Captain Ahab? Who cat, who mouse? Who Thakur, who Gabbar?

 When I was in Mumbai and had to report on the death of Harivansh Rai Bachchan, gigantic crowds had gathered outside his house, not out of respect for the poet, but to see the raining of celebs come to offer condolence to the actor-son Amitabh. 

 The crowds were so huge that they darkened the skies and cheered and hooted every time a celeb was spotted and turned the occasion into such a carnival that I was happy when Amitabhs bodyguard came charging, including at me, and drove us all out.

 It was the same after Sunil Dutt died. I did not die of asphyxiation because I could escape just in time I saw actor Ajay Devgan, wrapped by bodyguards, trying to leave and quickly lined up behind him and then found the bodyguarded Anil Kapoor, too, was behind me and I could slip out from an exit that the people were trying to break down.

 Brangelina need much saving. But with the bodyguards in trouble, what to do? I will float an NGO. Then I will advise Brangelina to pay a visit to Siddhi Vinayak. 

 A numerologist tells me that its the number 7 thats causing the trouble and Brangelina wears Bata size no. 7 shoes. So she should visit Siddhi Vinayak barefoot and on a Tuesday (which has seven letters) like all celebs in trouble. 

 But in disguise. Here are some suggestions. 

 Angelina must learn to hide her well-padded pout. Latest reports claim that Madame Tussauds has approached her for permission to cast in wax only her pout for posterity. If she cant pluck it out, Angelina must grow a moustache.

 Brangelina and the bodyguards (whoever they are) can dress up as each other. With her height and build, Angelina will not find it very difficult to pass for a strongman, not tougher than Brad. The real bodyguards can wear burqas they will be automatically mistaken for the stars. 

 Angelina can dress up as her actor-father, the Oscar-winning Jon Voight. They look identical, including the pout. 

 That way, Angelina may slowly start to fade from our eyes, starting with her family and ending with her pout, which, as with the Cheshire cats grin, will remain for some time after the rest of her has gone.

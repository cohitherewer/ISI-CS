 One of the hottest topics in bilateral 

 relations between India and the US was addressed in a unique 

 manner on June 13. Sally Ironfield, non-immigrant visa chief 

 for the US embassy in New Delhi, answered pressing questions 

 on visa applications for Indian students seeking to study 

 in the US. The interactive session, conducted via webchat, 

 is the first of it?s kind to have included journalists from 

 east India.

 Ironfield, who has been involved in the US foreign service since 1987, participated in the webchat with a view to ?demystify student visas?. Ironfield stated that ?India sends the largest number of students to study in the US? We hope to surpass last year?s 18,000 student visa applicants?, explaining why the issue of student visas has become a central dialogue between the two nations. 

 The length of the time period prior to studies in which a student can apply for a visa has recently changed from 90 days to 120 days. This time extension is one step by the US State Department in what is called the Rice-Chertoff Joint Vision, in reference to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. The primary aim of the measure is ?streamlining? the application process while ?keeping US borders secure?. 

 Ironfield spelt out the American position on what constitutes a sound applicant for a student visa to the US, the process which a candidate undergoes for approval, and the rights of the student if they end up studying in a US educational institution. A subject that regularly emerged in the course of the session concerned the financial position of applicants. 

 To the question: ?By putting so much emphasis on financial strength of a candidate, can you do justice to deserving students from India?s educated but not so rich families??, Ironfield responded that ?if a deserving student can demonstrate that there are sufficient funds? there is no bar to eligibility due to the student?s financial situation.?

 While stating that ?the majority of (Indian) student applications are approved?, Ironfield went on to add that ?on occasion, a student may not receive a visa because the student is unable to convince the officer that he or she is a credible student? Or does not have a credible plan to return to India?. 

 Other issues addressed in the session included the length of time one can stay in the US after one?s studies are completed (30 days), and the likelihood of coming back to this country for employment after studies ? ?we have seen an increasing number of students returning to India to join hi-tech firms?.

 The webchat session is the first in a series that will be held at The American Center, with the US ambassador confirmed for an unscheduled date later this month.

 War of words

 The seventh Inter-Institutional LN Birla National Debate will start from June 22 with the preliminary round in Jamshedpur. ?This year we have added some centres in the eastern region, like Jamshedpur, Bhubaneswar (July 5) and Ranchi (July 7). The best speakers will compete with the champs from the Calcutta preliminaries (July 10). The Calcutta regional final is on July 11, and the topic of debate will be ?Religious liberty is detrimental to national growth?,? said Mukta Nain, principal, Birla High School (Boys). 

 Finalists from eight centres (Calcutta, New Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai and Pune) will match their wits against each other in the finals, to be held in Calcutta in November. 

 The Inter-Institutional LN Birla National Debate has become a national event for school and college students. ?It started in five cities ? Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore ? and gradually expanded to places like Hyderabad, Jaipur and Pune,? explained Sharmila Bose, principal, Birla High School (Girls). ?With the overwhelming response over the years, we decided to reach out to students from across the country.? 

 Between August and September, regional finals will be held in Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai and Pune. 

 Drug dilemma

 The Rahul Mahajan case is taking dramatic turns everyday. ?Drugs? is making daily headlines. It?s hard to believe that a boy who was on a ventilator a short while ago after a close shave with death is facing such harsh treatment and social harassment. He cuts a sorry figure. At this moment he needs proper treatment. After all, Rahul is a drug addict (if he is guilty), not a terrorist. I think it?s not just people like him who are to blame, society plays an important part too. The police should concentrate on busting the people who supply the drugs and bring the contraband into our country.

 Apropos the article by Sarit Ray 

 under ?Admission etiquette? on June 13, the procedure of 

 collecting the forms online has been done before by Presidency 

 College. This is definitely not the first time.

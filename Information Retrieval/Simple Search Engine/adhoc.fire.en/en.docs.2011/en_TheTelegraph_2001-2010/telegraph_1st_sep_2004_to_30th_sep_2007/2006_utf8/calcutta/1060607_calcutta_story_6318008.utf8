The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bridge yet 

 to be lit, fixed

 No lights, no signals and a bumpy 

 surface ? on the night of May 1, these caused the death of 

 two youngsters on a motorcycle on the Bondel Gate bridge. 

 On May 2, Metro visited the bridge to highlight how dark and 

 dangerous it was. The official word then was the bridge would 

 become better and brighter, post-poll. On June 5, Metro revisited 

 the bridge and found it darker and deadlier than before?

 The bridge was drowned in complete darkness on Monday night. 

 Even the handful of halogens that were visible on May 2 

 were missing.

 Then PWD minister Amar Chowdhury 

 had told Metro that the work of installing traffic lights 

 is undertaken at the end of the construction process. But 

 with elections approaching, work on the unfinished ? but 

 open ? bridge could not be completed.

 Copspeak: ?After 

 sunset, the bridge becomes a death trap for motorists. It 

 is also a den of criminals who take full advantage of the 

 dark? ? a local police officer.

 CMDAspeak: ?The 

 electrical and mechanical (E amp;M) section of the CMDA 

 has taken up the job of electrification and a fund of Rs 

 1.27 crore has been allotted. Work will start in a week? 

 ? B.B. Bhattacharya, chief engineer, E amp;M section, CMDA.

 The road surface continues to be patchy and uneven; the 

 bumps and rough pockets cannot be seen in the dark. The 

 final coat of bitumen has still not been applied.

 Then PWD minister Amar Chowdhury 

 had told Metro that work would be taken up immediately after 

 the elections. Twenty days have passed since Team Bhattacharjee 

 was sworn in.

 ?With monsoon 

 round the corner, we will not undertake major road repairs 

 now. We will undertake basic repairs to ensure the safety 

 of vehicles. After the rains, we will overhaul the entire 

 surface? ? Kshiti Goswami, new PWD minister.

 At the Rifle Range Road end, there is no traffic signal 

 or signage.

 Then PWD minister Amar Chowdhury 

 had told Metro that as soon as the elections were over, 

 tenders would be floated to instal an automatic traffic 

 signalling system. No sign yet.

 Copspeak: ?The 

 absence of a traffic signal at the Rifle Range Road end 

 creates a lot of confusion amongst motorists. It is difficult 

 to decide which channel to take? ? traffic officer on duty.

 CMDAspeak: ?The 

 bridge will soon have traffic signals on both sides. The 

 motorists will be able to use the bridge without any fear 

 of a head-on collision? ? B.B. Bhattacharya, chief engineer, 

 E amp;M section, CMDA.

 There are pavements that start on the Tiljala Road side 

 and end in the middle of the bridge. There are cavernous 

 gaps between two concrete slabs on the pavement and big 

 protruding hooks.

 Then PWD minister Amar Chowdhury 

 had told Metro that work would be taken up immediately after 

 the elections. Tell that to the pedestrian left hanging 

 halfway on the bridge or praying that he gets off the bridge 

 with every bone in place.

 CMDAspeak: ?All 

 construction is the responsibility of the PWD. We will immediately 

 bring this to their notice and request them to take up the 

 repair work? ? P. R. Baviskar, CEO, CMDA.

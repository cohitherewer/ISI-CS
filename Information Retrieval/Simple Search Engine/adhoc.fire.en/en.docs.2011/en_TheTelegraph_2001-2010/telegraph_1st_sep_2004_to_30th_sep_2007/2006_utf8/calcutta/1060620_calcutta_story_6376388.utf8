With a new Superman film due for release, it may be an appropriate time to look back at the preceding four Superman efforts, which tell the remarkable story of the rise and fall of Superman at the box office.

 The first modern Superman film was released in 1978, starring Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman as Superman and Lex Luthor, respectively. The film was a huge hit both critically and commercially, grossing over $100 million at the box office.

 The 1980 sequel, Superman II, was an equal success, with yet another $100 million gross at the box office.

 The joke, however, began to grow thin with Superman III bombing badly at the box office, grossing only $59 million. That was in 1983.

 The studio executives at Canon clearly didn?t realise the game was up and forged ahead with yet another sequel, this time in 1987. The real commercial and critical kryptonite was reserved for the hapless Superman IV: The Quest For Peace.

 After a battering at the theatres and in practically every magazine, the execs got the hint and Superman was grounded.

 So what chance does this new incarnation of Superman have at the box office? The history of Hollywood sequels suggests that enough time has elapsed for the rubble of Superman IV to have been cleared. A fresh start for Clark Kent is actually looking good.

 Here?s looking at a few sequel-centric genres ? 

 Action

 The longest and most successful action franchise must be James Bond. The series has so far spanned 40 years, with six actors playing the Bond role, with 22 films having been produced.

 Bond is doubly remarkable because the series has managed to maintain popularity despite the main role changing actor so many times over the years. It will be interesting to see if Superman can survive the change of actors in the same way.

 Steven Spielberg?s Indiana Jones films are among the most successful, with The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade drawing the crowds just as much as the original Raiders of the Lost Ark.

 The mixture of humour and action in the scripts has been crucial to both series, and has endeared audiences to Bond and Jones.

 Fantasy amp; Sci-Fi

 Sequels, it seems, are a particular hit with the geekier cinema demographic. George Lucas?s original Star Wars trilogy dwarfs all others not just in terms of commercial success, but also in hatching credibly extendable story lines.

 The Lord of The Rings trilogy cannot be seen in the same light as most other sequels (i.e commercially), because J.R.R. Tolkien?s book already pre-ordained any film adaptation to be comprised of several parts.

 It is debatable as to whether the Terminator films fall into the action or science fiction category, but Terminator 2: Judgement Day completely outdid its predecessor at the box office, and became the defining Terminator movie. The third instalment, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, was widely seen as a crashing failure that provided a weak post-script to two of the most successful films of recent times. Film lovers recently let out a collective groan at the announcement of a fourth addition to the series, scheduled for 2008. Whether ?The Governator? will reprise his role is yet to be confirmed.

Horror

 Two films in the 1980s were to give birth to series that came to epitomise the idea of commercial profit over artistic integrity ? Friday The 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. The original Friday The 13th film was released in 1980 and was a box office smash. Shortly afterwards Paramount studios opted to produce a second, and a year after that a third. The subsequent releases did modestly well, with 1984 bringing a sequel entitled Friday The 13th: The Final Chapter. This did remarkably well and Paramount chose to make yet another sequel called Friday The 13th: A New Beginning. This cash cow continued for six more instalments, with the rights to the Friday The 13th series being bought by New Line Studios after the improbably titled Friday The 13th: Jason Takes Manhattan.

 The original screenwriter Victor Miller admits that the original was a none-too-subtle cash-in on the success of earlier slasher film Halloween, and never bothered to see any of the subsequent films.

 Director Wes Craven never intended for his 1984 box office smash A Nightmare on Elm Street to be made as a sequel, and refused to take part in any of the sequels, until he was persuaded to direct 1994?s Wes Craven?s New Nightmare, five films after his original work!

 In an almost witty post-modern twist, New Line Studios sanctioned a film in which the two teen-slaying protagonists of each film met in a final showdown: Freddy vs. Jason.

 An appropriate end for these very flogged horses?

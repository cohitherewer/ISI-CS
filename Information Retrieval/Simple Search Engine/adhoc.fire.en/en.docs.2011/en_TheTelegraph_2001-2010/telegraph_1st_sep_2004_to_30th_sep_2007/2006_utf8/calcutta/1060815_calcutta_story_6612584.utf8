 Stench leads to body in flat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 40-year-old unidentified man was found murdered on Monday in a Baruipur apartment that had just been taken on rent by one of his acquaintances. The apartment was locked from outside.

 Police said the body had decomposed. The man might have been strangled with a towel, said the investigating officer. Its clear that the murder was committed at least two days ago, as blisters had appeared on the body.

 The sleuths are looking for the man who had rented the apartment and a woman. Three persons have been detained for interrogation.

 The apartment block is in Ganiman, close to Baruipur police station. Caretaker of the building Kuddus Mollah told police that a man, identifying himself as Mohammed Riaz Alam, met him last Monday to rent an apartment. 

 He said he was a resident of Niamat Gali, in Esplanade, and paid an advance of Rs 500 to the caretaker.

 On Friday, he came again with another man (the murder victim) and a woman. He took the keys from Kudduss wife Banu Begum, telling her that they had come to see the flat.

 We dont know what happened next. We are not even sure when they had left the building, as they did not return the keys to us, Kuddus told the investigating officer.

 On Sunday, a foul smell started emanating from the building, but neither Kuddus nor the tenants could locate the source. On Monday, the stench became unbearable, prompting Kuddus to call police, who broke open the door of Alams apartment.

 Stepping in, they found the man lying on a mattress with a towel wrapped around the throat and blood stains on the mouth.

 Additional superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas) A.K. Ghosh said circumstantial evidence indicated the murder was pre-planned. We are probing the case from all possible angles to ascertain the cause of the murder. We are also verifying Alams identity and antecedents.

 A clear picture, he added, will emerge after the post-mortem report comes in.

 An officer of Baruipur police station said Kuddus, his wife and the owner of the building, Md Ismail, a resident of north Calcutta, have been detained for interrogation.

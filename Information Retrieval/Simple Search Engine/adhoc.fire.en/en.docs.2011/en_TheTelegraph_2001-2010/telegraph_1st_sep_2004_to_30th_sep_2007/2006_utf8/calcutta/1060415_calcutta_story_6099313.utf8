The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pay less to park on road

 - Truckers choose bribe over fee; blame terminal facilities

 OUR BUREAU

 The money math is simple: Rs 100 to park a truck in a terminal and Rs 10-20 to park it illegally on the road.

 The first is the authorised fee, the second is the bribe amount and the difference between the two explains why truck terminals created with such fanfare remain empty, while the adjoining roads are clogged with parked trucks (as reported in Metro on Friday).

 And that these smoke-belching goods vehicles roll into the city, even beyond permissible hours, was confirmed by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty himself.

 ?I have seen many trucks entering the city during the prohibited hours of 8 am to 10 pm. It is the duty of police to crack down on errant drivers and impound the vehicles,? the minister added.

 To put an end to the menace that pushes up air pollution levels and adds to traffic congestion, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury had said on Thursday that his department was planning a total ban on trucks along roads where the terminals exist.

 But this has drawn flak from both truckers and environmentalists. Sections of the green lobby labelled it just a grand eyewash by the government and urged it to first get its green basics right.

 ?It?s one more impractical directive from the transport department, not meant to be implemented,? alleged Subhas Dutta, referring to several earlier orders, including the deadlines for meeting tail-pipe emission norms and the ban on old vehicles that bit the dust.

 ?The state is yet to implement a nine-year-old green bench order that emission checks must be carried out on all trucks entering the city,? pointed out Dutta. ?Besides, most trucks enter the city at night, when no pollution check is carried out.?

 An environment department official added: ?Vehicular pollution cannot be effectively curbed unless the emission-check order is strictly implemented? Banning trucks is an impractical and extreme step.?

 The truckers? contention is that the terminals will serve their purpose only when the wholesale markets in the city are relocated.

 According to the government?s grand plan, trucks should stop at the terminals and unload goods, to be ferried to the city in smaller, less-polluting vehicles.

 The terminals, claim truckers, have no infrastructure. ?There is no security, no eateries or a place to rest for drivers and their helps,? claimed Subhas Bose, assistant secretary of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators? Association.

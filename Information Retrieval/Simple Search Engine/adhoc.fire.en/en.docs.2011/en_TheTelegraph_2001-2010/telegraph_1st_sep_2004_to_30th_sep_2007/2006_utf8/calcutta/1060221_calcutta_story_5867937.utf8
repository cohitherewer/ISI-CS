 What: The Saturday Club Apna Aangan, held in association with The Telegraph.

 Where: The club premises.

 When: February 18, 7.30 pm onwards.

 The ambience: A fun-filled village fair that reflected an eclectic blend of diverse cultures and creative talent. Right from the entrance lined with many a mangal ghot to a pretty rangoli with flower petals to the scenic illustration of a boat on the waves, everything in the walk-up to the fair had a traditional touch.

 In Apna Aangan, there were coconut tree cut-outs on the boundary wall, benches wrapped in white sheets with side cushions, and a scarecrow in one corner ? not a dummy, but a man striking the perfect still-life pose!

 Take a look: Clowns with caps and colourful attires shook hands with the young and not so young. Open stages on the lawns had performers from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Bengal treating audiences to traditional folk dances.

 The Rajasthani dancers began with Kachchi Ghori, a popular dance form. The performance of girls in pink and blue ghagras with their swift turns and graceful movements was a delight. It was a feast of colour and pageantry, bringing alive the folk artistry of Rajasthan.

 Just bordering the revelry from the desert state was a glimpse of Gujarat, with men and women in traditional mirrorwork attire matching steps to folk music.

 Not far away, the tribal women from Birbhum in blue drapes with colourful flowers in their hair made a pretty picture. As the men played the drums, these women held hands and danced in a rhythm simple yet riveting.

 From the gentleness of Bengal to the vibrancy of Punjab, there was a singer belting out catchy Punjabi numbers. Energetic male dancers in colourful turbans and the female folk in colourful Patiala suits drew a lot of cheers.

 The Bhojpuri singers entertained audiences with their rough edges and distinctive accents.

 But it was the Tamil Nadu show that proved the real crowd-puller. The performers began with Kaliattam, a dance form depicting Shakti in the Kali avatar, conquering evil. Then it was all about acrobatics that left audiences mesmerised.

 The stalls hosted a variety of activities with soothsayers predicting the future of the young and old, and mehndi, bangles and kantha-stitch sari counters crowded with women browsers and buyers. If children enjoyed the giant-wheel ride, toddlers gravitated towards the balloons and masks on offer.

 The crowd: The crowds started pouring in nice and early. In sync with the carnival atmosphere, a majority chose to go the desi way. There were men in kurtas (some even in pagris) and women in ghagra cholis, colourful skirts and salwar suits. A fancy-dress Veerappan terrorised people, gun in hand.

 Sip n bite: Each stall served speciality items from a particular state. Chowpati, Falak Nama, Dandia Raas and Santiniketan served up Bhelpuri, Dosa, Mutton Halim, Kebabs, Luchi Aloo Dum and more.

 Voiceover: The idea was to bring in Indian flavours and folk traditions from all over the country and make it a unique and colourful experience for all, smiled club president Arjun De.

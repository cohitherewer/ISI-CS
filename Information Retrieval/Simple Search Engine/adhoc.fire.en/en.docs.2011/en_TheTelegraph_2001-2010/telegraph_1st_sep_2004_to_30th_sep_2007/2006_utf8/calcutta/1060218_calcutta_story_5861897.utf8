The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Match steps amp; move

 - More participants, bigger prize kitty, a marathon for one and all

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It?s time to bring out your running shoes once again and match steps with fellow Calcuttans for your city.

 The Telegraph Kolkata Marathon 2006, presented by Exide in association with CII, is set to see some 15,000 participants take off from the Basketball Grounds on Red Road, this Sunday morning.

 Besides the main marathon of 42.36 km ? the only in the city ? there will be a mini marathon for the ladies, covering 10.5 km, and a 4.2-km Fun Run for children, senior citizens and everyone else.

 From last year?s Rs 6.25 lakh, the prize kitty this year has swelled to Rs 7.6 lakh, with the winner of the main marathon receiving Rs 2.4 lakh and the top three contestants being taken to international marathons, courtesy CII. 

 The mini marathon champion gets Rs 60,000.

 The celebrities will all be there ? from small and big screen stars to sports personalities and more.

 But the morning of February 19 will belong to the Calcuttan turning up to run or cheer the marathon to success.

 Registration booths around the city have received a steady response so far. Those who haven?t been able to make it to the enrolment centres can take heart from the chance to queue up for spot registrations at the flag-off point on Sunday.

 Watchdog of schools revived

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is set to make a fresh move to establish control over the functioning of CBSE and ICSE schools.

 The 13-member ?watchdog? committee, set up by the state government last year to suggest how to regulate the schools, will meet again on June 22. The decision assumes significance against the backdrop of the government?s announcement before the Assembly polls that it would disband the panel.

 The lukewarm response from most ICSE and CBSE schools in replying to the questionnaire the panel had issued to them was believed to be the reason behind the government?s decision to discontinue the process. 

 The government had set March 31 as the deadline for the committee to submit its report, which was to be based on the schools? replies to the queries that covered most aspects of their functioning.

 Despite three reminders from the government, only 10 schools had sent in their replies by March 31.

 But the government is now beginning to receive replies from schools, prompting it to carry forward its monitoring exercise.

 ?The schools are gradually changing their attitude,? said Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner in the school education department and chairman of the committee. According to him, nearly 26 schools have sent their replies in the past month.

 ?The figure is encouraging, though it is too small compared to the 340-odd ICSE and CBSE schools in the state. Still, we need to renew our efforts because some schools have at last responded,? he said. The prominent schools are yet to respond.

 The June 22 meeting is likely to explore other ways of collecting information about the institutions. 

 ?The meeting will be crucial. Now that the committee has started functioning again, we will have to take it forward. We must find out some measures to complete the job that has been assigned to the committee,? an official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Vacant judge posts spark protest

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 There?s a murmur in the corridors of Calcutta High Court. A Telegraph picture

 It?s a first in the 165-year-old history of Calcutta High Court. Litigants and lawyers are planning a joint movement against acute shortage of judges.

 ?The situation is terrible. Thousands of litigants are facing problems as their cases are not coming up for hearing for months. They have become impatient. Several have agreed to the Bar Association?s proposal to launch a joint stir, demanding immediate filling up of the vacant judge posts,? said Amal Mukhopadhyaya, secretary of the association.

 The sanctioned strength of judges in the court is 50. At present, it is being run by only 28 judges, of whom, two are handling cases in the circuit bench of the high court at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 ?It has become impossible for the court administration to handle all these cases with so few judges. As a result, a number of maintenance, alimony, residuary, corporate and criminal cases are lying pending for days. Our repeated appeals before the central government and the Supreme Court have yielded no result,? said Uttam Majumdar, former secretary of the association. 

 He added: ?Following a Supreme Court ruling in December 2003, the lawyers have no right to take part in any agitation against the judicial administration. The court had observed during the ruling that the lawyers were mere agents of their clients. They have no authority to cease work and put their clients in distress. Considering this part of the apex court judgment, our association, in a recent resolution, decided to launch a joint stir.?

 He, however, declined to reveal whether the stir was aimed at stalling the functioning of the court. 

 ?The method of the movement is still being worked out. We still hope that considering the regular harassment of litigants, the authorities concerned will take measures on an emergent basis.?

 Rabi Shankar Chatterjee, a member of the association, stated: ?We are convincing our clients to join the movement. Most of them have agreed.?

 About a fortnight ago, a delegation from the association had met high court Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and requested him take all possible steps to fill up the vacant posts of judges. 

 ?The chief justice had sought a month?s time from us. But more than 15 days have passed, and nothing has been done yet,? association member Tapas Bhanja said.

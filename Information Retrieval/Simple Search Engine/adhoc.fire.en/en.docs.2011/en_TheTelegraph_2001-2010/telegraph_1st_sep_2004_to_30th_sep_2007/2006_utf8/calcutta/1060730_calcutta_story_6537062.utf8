Life

 Just like a tambourine

 The last Thursday night of the 

 month and the citys Tambourine Man was called upon 

 to play his music at Someplace Else (SPE, for the party 

 crowd).

 Anjan Dutt and the Music Folk 

 presented an hour of non-stop folk music punctuated with 

 some inspired guitar riffs that chipped in with Indian rhythm 

 as well.

 Anjan is just back from Osians 

 Cinefan Festival in Delhi where his new film The Bong 

 Connection received an overwhelming response. 

 Ours was the only film apart from Naseeruddin Shahs 

 Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota that was screened to a packed 

 house in the festival, smiled the singer-actor-director.

 Everybody found the film 

 extremely funny and they just loved the music, he 

 added.

 The man behind The Bong Connection 

 music, Neel Dutt, was also present at The Park hotel pub 

 on Thursday night as Dutt and Dutt started off with John 

 Denvers classic Sunshine on my shoulders, arresting 

 immediate attention from an audience till then absorbed 

 in the England-Pakistan Test match on TV.

 Once Don Mclean and Leonard Cohens 

 golden words filled the night haunt, it was truly someplace 

 else from there on.

 Some familiar faces surfaced in 

 the swaying crowd. Film-maker Subrata Sen was all smiles 

 post his Bibar triumph in Delhi. Model Sanjukta preferred 

 to just stand and soak in the music with a friend. But it 

 was difficult to stay rooted to the spot once Mrs Robinson 

 stormed the sound waves. 

 The clincher for the night, though, 

 was Just like a woman. The way Anjan made Bob Dylan 

 his own, running through the words as if mouthing them for 

 the very first time, hung in the smoke-filled SPE air long 

 after she had broken just like a little girl.

 Only one complaint, though. One 

 hour in one month just aint enough for all those tired 

 of the umpteenth Pink Floyd playback. 

 After all, were not sleepy 

 and there is no place else we are going to.

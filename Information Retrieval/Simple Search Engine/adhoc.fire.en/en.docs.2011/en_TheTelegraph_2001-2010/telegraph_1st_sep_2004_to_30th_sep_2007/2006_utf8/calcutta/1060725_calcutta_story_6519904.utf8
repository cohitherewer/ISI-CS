 A literacy programme, Concentrated 

 Learning Encounter (CLE), was recently conducted by Rotary 

 Club of Calcutta in association with Loreto Sealdah on the 

 school premises. The five-day training module saw the CLE-trained 

 teachers giving lessons to street children.

 The first training session under CLE was conducted for a batch of 20 teachers. These teachers, in turn, have passed on the methodology to about 100 students of Class IX of Loreto Day School Sealdah. The students then divided themselves into 10 teams. These groups now teach street children from across Calcutta. A 40-minute class is held twice a week on the campus.

 There has been a marked improvement in the English language communication skills and knowledge of the street children involved. Two of them are already able to read words and are even able to frame sentences and narrate stories in English.

 The Class IX students of Loreto Sealdah are now planning to go to villages once a week and teach about 3,500 children there.

 About 430 teachers from Bengali-medium schools are also ready to implement CLE in a radius of about 200 km of the city. This way, together they plan to reach out to over 22,000 children.

 Loreto Sealdah had previously initiated Shikhalaya Prakalpa, an education programme for street children. The uniqueness of this programme lies in the fact that once the children learn through the CLE programme, they are asked to teach other children in their locality.

 English language training programmes such as these encourage people to come forward and make a difference in the present social system, which provides few opportunities to street children.

 Green sleuths

 Plants play a vital role in our lives. Hence, to recognise their importance we assumed the roles of ?plant detectives? and started solving the mysteries surrounding various plant parts and their functions.

 We explored the plant world during our Nature Walks in the school garden. Observing the beautiful plants in so many hues of green and the flowers in different colours, shapes and sizes was part of our Plant World lessons.

 The gardener helped us to recognise and classify the plants. He even showed us the roots of a dead plant. The highlight of the week was the Plant Parts Salad Day for which we raided the refrigerators in our homes. Some of us accompanied our mothers on their vegetable shopping trips as we wanted to get the roots, stems, leaves and fruit we wanted for the salad.

 The chopped boiled potatoes, cucumber, radish, cabbage, lettuce, carrots sprouted gram, peanuts, tossed with a dash of lime and masalas made the salad really yummy. 

 The week ended with a special assembly in which one student from each section received a certificate for the best plant in the ?Grow a Plant? competition. 

 We also sang a song for which Arhan Dasgupta, one of the students, gave the music. Our music teacher made the song more interesting by giving it a rap feel.

 Although our plant week is over but we have just learned to be aware of the plants around us. We will now try to learn more about them.

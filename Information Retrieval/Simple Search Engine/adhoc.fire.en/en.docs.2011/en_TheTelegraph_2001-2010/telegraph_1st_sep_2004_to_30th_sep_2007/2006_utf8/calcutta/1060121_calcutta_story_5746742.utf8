The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Now, bank for cord blood stem cells

 Cord blood being processed at a CordLife facility

 Young Donny Ray Black in the Grisham bestseller The Rainmaker succumbed to leukaemia because he didn?t get the bone marrow transplant from his perfect-match twin that could have saved his life, thanks to the insurance firm playing dirty.

 Friday marked the ?first baby step? towards a different succour source to treat blood cancer and other debilitating diseases in the city, with the same results as with bone marrow, despite using a 10-fold lower cell dose, with less chances of rejection and a higher proliferation capacity.

 Cell therapy major CyGenics Ltd announced the formation of CordLife Sciences (India) Private Limited, a cord blood banking company, which will soon open its head office in Calcutta. The new company was officially launched by former prime minister of Singapore and current senior minister Goh Chok Tong.

 CyGenics will build and operate a full umbilical cord blood tissue processing and storage facility in the city, followed by regional offices in other Indian cities. It is the majority stakeholder of the new company in an equity-partnership venture with Strassenburg Pharmaceuticals Ltd and a marketing tie-up with Woodlands.

 ?With India?s burgeoning affluent and educated population base, there will be a growing demand on the healthcare delivery system. This also translates into an increasing need for autologous tissue banking and regenerative medicine,? said Steven Fang, group CEO of CyGenics.

 CordLife, a division of CyGenics, collects, processes and stores adult stem cells, which may later become potential source material for life-saving treatments. The city facility of CordLife will enable parents to preserve the cord blood of their newborns for a fee (of Rs 30,000-40,000 plus an annual processing charge 15 per cent of that amount).

 ?The cord blood will remain the property of the child for life, and will act as a source of stem cells for autologous and sibling transplants or for cellular therapies in future,? Fang explains. The company, setting up the Calcutta facility at a start-up cost of $1 million, has shortlisted a few properties and plans to kick off operations around June.

 Regenerative medicine, individual vaccines and cost-effective cell therapy are the three key areas of future application of stem cells. 

 ?The potential of this emerging science is virtually infinite and cord blood stem cells could be used in future to produce bone, cartilage, endothelium, nerve cells and skeletal muscles,? said Mark Kirkland, chief scientific officer of CyGenics.

 Recent research has also revealed stem cell efficacy in treating heart attacks, strokes and spinal cord injuries. ?Even an answer to diabetes could be on the horizon, with the possibility of creating cells that can produce insulin,? Kirkland added.

 The target of the group is to become ?the first AABB (industry gold standard for cellular banking)-accredited adult stem cell tissue and engineering facility in the Indian subcontinent?.

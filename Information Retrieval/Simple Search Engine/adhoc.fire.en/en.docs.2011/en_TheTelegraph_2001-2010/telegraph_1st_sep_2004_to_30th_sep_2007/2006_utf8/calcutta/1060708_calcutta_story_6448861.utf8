The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Often dubbed the cultural capital of India, Calcutta boasts of a wealth of talented artists. These poets of the palette celebrate, in their own distinctive styles, the unique tone and temper for which the city is famed. Besides depicting the warmth and violence, poverty and prosperity, that characterise the nooks and crannies of the city, they have also captured the pulse of the people who have made it their dwelling place. From the City of Joy, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by 20 artists from Calcutta, presents a kaleidoscopic cluster of images that promise to hold the viewer spellbound by their sheer range and diversity, both in style and theme. A blend of reality and fantasy is the common signature of their works, obviously born out of the dischotomies that exist in the life of the people of the city. Participating artists include Anirban Seth, Beena Pradhan, Dewashish Das, Partha Chatterjee, Sandip Roy, Subhendu Porel, Tamal Krsna (Prakriti; picture above) and Tirthankar Biswas. Curator: Ratnottama Sengupta.

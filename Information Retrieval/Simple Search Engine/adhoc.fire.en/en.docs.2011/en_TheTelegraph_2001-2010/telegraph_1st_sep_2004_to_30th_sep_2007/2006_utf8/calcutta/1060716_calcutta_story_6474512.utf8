 On your guard against deadly disease

 World Zoonotic Day was observed 

 on July 6. Pet owners must be aware of zoonotic diseases 

 as these are transmitted from animals to humans. Here are 

 the ones that one must guard against. Don?t panic; consult 

 your veterinarian and personal physician when you suspect 

 these diseases. Early diagnosis and veterinary care with 

 simple precautions can protect you and your pets.

 Rabies: It is caused by 

 a virus transmitted through animal saliva. Signs of rabies 

 include personality and behavioural changes, lack of coordination, 

 difficulty in swallowing and seizures. Rabies is fatal.

 Protection: Don?t handle wild 

 or stray animals. Get dogs and cats vaccinated.

 Toxoplasmosis: This is 

 caused by protozoa, the one-celled parasite. Hunting cats 

 often contract this parasite by eating small rodents and 

 then shed the cysts in their stool. The parasite is also 

 found in raw meat. Cats and humans show no signs of the 

 disease, or have only mild flu-like symptoms. Infection, 

 especially during the first three months of pregnancy, could 

 be fatal for the foetus.

 Protection: Don?t let your cat 

 hunt and don?t feed it raw meat. Pregnant women and AIDS 

 patients should wear gloves when gardening and wash their 

 hands thoroughly after handling raw meat. They should not 

 handle litter boxes.

 Roundworms: Nearly every 

 puppy is born with roundworms contracted from the mother. 

 These worms can be transmitted to people, especially children. 

 Most infections in people are mild and cause no signs at 

 all, but the potential for severe illness exists. Migrating 

 worms may damage the liver, eyes or brain. Because the eggs 

 are transmitted through the puppy?s stool, sanitation is 

 essential. Faeces should be removed and disposed of daily 

 and anyone who handles the puppy should wash his or her 

 hands frequently. This is especially important for children 

 prone to put fingers in their mouth.

 Protection: Have your vet test 

 several stool samples of your new puppy. Get tests on adult 

 dogs done every year. Some vets prescribe regular deworming 

 even in the face of negative stool tests because of these 

 risks.

 Tapeworm: Tapeworms in 

 dogs sometimes cause illness in human beings. Dog tapeworm 

 echinococcus granulosus causes hydatid cyst in the human 

 brain and liver. Protection: You are safe if you deworm 

 your pet regularly.

 Ringworm: Not a worm, but 

 a fungal skin infection. It can be difficult to diagnose 

 in animals, as the lesions do not look the same in all cases. 

 Some animals, especially cats, can carry the fungus in their 

 haircoat without showing signs of itching, scaly skin or 

 hair loss. In people, the classic lesion is a raised, reddened 

 and itchy ?ring?.

 Protection: Use anti-fungal powder 

 and consult your vet.

 Sarcoptic mange or scabies: 

 Another zoonotic skin condition in dogs. This mite burrows 

 under the skin and causes severe itching, scab and hair 

 loss. Skin scrapings, to find and identify the mite, are 

 often negative. In humans, a pinpoint red rash is often 

 found on the chest and abdomen. Treatment in dogs includes 

 multiple dips to kill the mites and medication for itching 

 and secondary infection. A new injectable drug, ivermectin, 

 can be used to treat mange, although it is not yet approved 

 for this use and should not be used in Collie dogs.

 Protection: Get skin lesions examined 

 by your vet. Fungal cultures may be the only way to confirm 

 a case of ringworm. Skin scraping tests should be done. 

 Suspected cases of ringworm or mange should be treated even 

 if unconfirmed to prevent the spread of the disease.

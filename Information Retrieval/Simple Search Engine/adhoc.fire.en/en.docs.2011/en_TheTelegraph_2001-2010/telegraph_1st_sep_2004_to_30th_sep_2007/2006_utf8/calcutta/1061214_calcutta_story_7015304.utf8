 Theres more to

 Dress diktat

 Its neither little nor black. The LBD or the Little Black Dress might boast a timeless appeal, but this winter theres much more to the dress story than this party classic. Pinafore, empire, balloon, bubble, baby doll, shift, trapeze, crossover the fashion week reviews and forecasts for the season have left you far better informed about dresses, but they have in turn deepened your doubts. Whats the it shape? Where should the waistline be? Where should the hemline stop? The list of queries is just too long.

 Lets go by some designerspeak. Says Mumbai-based designer Narendra Kumar Ahmed: The balloon hemline in various versions is the it shape of the moment. The length hovers around the knee, a result of the feminine focus in fashion. The look is more sensual than sexy. The higher the better is the motto for the waistline and empires are big too.

 If youre not too confident about flaunting the dress in its truest western avatar, take a tip or two from Kiran Uttam Ghosh on adding the ethnic edge. In Calcutta, people can easily pair a dress with a churi pant to Indianise it, advises the designer.

 Classic cut

 There has been a bombardment of jackets styles and silhouettes this season. Wraps, shrugs, denims, crossover, trench, fencing, sporty, bolero, Nehru, blazer, swing, cropped The list is long. An average Calcuttans jacket-related vocabulary has never been so rich. 

 If, amidst all this gung-ho, youre confused about what to lay your hands on this winter, and which specific style should enter your wardrobe, then go back to basics. 

 Pick a classic bandhgala and put all your cover-up concerns to rest. A bandhgala is like a white shirt, says designer Rajesh Pratap Singh, describing the timeless essential.

 Keep the accessories minimal and dont forget to keep the first few buttons open, adds the bandhgala-specialist. And you know the colour rule: when in doubt, go for black!

 Leggy Look

 Leggings can do a lot for 

 every woman. Great as a camouflage for not-so-great legs 

 and convenient to manipulate your weather-related situation, 

 leggings look hot, declares designer Anamika Khanna.

 So, no more putting away those mini skirts and tiny dresses, leggings played up with legwarmers and boots is the silhouette of the season. Team them with a belted tunic or kurta for the desi dash. Wear cotton-lycra stretch leggings they look chic, adds Anamika. But heres a word of caution from her: Be sure that your leggings dont have a run in them. That looks ugh!

 Red rage

 Red rocks like no other colour. Yes, even more than black. The last colour of the rainbow (or the first, depending on how you want to look at it) is all yours this party season. Bring it on in the form of a bright mouth, nails, hair, bag, jewellery, or outfits, but do bring it on. 

 Red is the colour of this winter and it comes in various shades. The burgundy and jewel tones are really hot, says designer Surily Goel.

 And if you think red in its raging avatar is too much for you, learn the art of playing it up or down just as you like it. Tone it down with generous doses of blacks and browns or electrify your look with an all-red ensemble. 

 l metallics also go well with the scarlet-brick-crimson-blood-burgundy-wine-vermilion family.

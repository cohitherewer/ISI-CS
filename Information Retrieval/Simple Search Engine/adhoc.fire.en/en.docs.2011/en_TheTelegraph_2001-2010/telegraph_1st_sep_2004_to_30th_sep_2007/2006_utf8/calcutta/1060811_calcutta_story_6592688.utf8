 Apropos the report Success rate 

 under review, July 4, the syllabus for West Bengal Joint 

 Entrance Examination 2006 has been changed keeping in mind 

 the national-level competitive examinations. Unfortunately, 

 the change was announced quite late last year, leaving very 

 little time for the students to prepare. 

 Till last year, preparation for JEE was not very different from preparation for the Higher Secondary (HS), as the syllabi and question pattern were similar. But it is no longer so. 

 The HS candidates who appeared for JEE this year had to suffer due to the decision to implement a major shift at a short notice. Ironically, the new syllabus was made on a par with the CBSE and ISC syllabi for the benefit of the state board students. 

 The problems faced by the HS students is reflected in the merit list. Unlike in the past, students from Delhi boards secured the top positions. I am not implying that they lack merit, but I am certain that the sudden change affected the prospects of the HS students. 

 Most questions involved calculations and to do them fast, one needs a sound background on units and measurements, which is not taught to the state board students. Thus, the move which was meant to be beneficial for the state board students proved detrimental to their interests. Many did well despite the difficulties, but what about those who could not, thanks to the whims of the powers that be?

 Kudos for publishing a picture of brushes made with mongoose bristles (Brush with the law, July 5). It will spread awareness about rampant violation of wildlife laws. It is a matter of regret that species of birds are becoming extinct in the quest to embellish dhaks and make showpieces and other commercial items. The forest department should immediately crack down against such acts.

 The report In London with Durga, July 5, highlights the fact that idols are works of art. Even the people of London have started admiring the works of artists like Nemai Chandra Paul.

 Apropos Travel course, July 3, the three-month certificate course in travel and tourism will definitely find many takers. All those who organise tours should have a clear idea about how to make them safe and enjoyable. All the possible ways of preventing hazards on tours should be made clear to the organisers. The tourists, on their part, should be on their best behaviour while on tour. Some tourists were abandoned in Germany by their tour operator during the World Cup. Such incidents should not be repeated. 

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Apropos the report Dengue shade on death, July 4, Biswajit Pramaniks family had to spend more than Rs 9,000 on drugs in a few days and additional Rs 6,000 for a blood test from Delhi. But the chief municipal officer of health claimed that the patient could not have died from dengue because the required blood test was not done and the patient did not show dengue symptoms. 

 Why should the family and friends of a dead man be put through the agony of a controversy over the real cause of death after spending thousands of rupees for medicines and medical tests at a major government hospital? 

 There can be no dispute that either the chief municipal officer (health) or the doctors at National Medical College and Hospital are responsible for causing such a fiasco.

 Apropos the report Suicide cycle complete, June 26, debt, love affair and illness are prompting many in and around the city to end their lives. Those choosing suicide are mentally ill and need psychiatric help. The majority of the middle-class now runs after comfort and luxury far beyond its means. The trend is alarming. 

 Abul Fateh Kamruddin,

 Apropos the story The cool goddess, July 3, I was amazed to read about Ralph W. Nicholas and his strong love for the culture of rural Bengal. His observations about the change in lifestyle in the villages of the state were spot on. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Apropos the Hard Talk on July 3 (Curb on filling of waterbodies), contrary to Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Ahmed Khans allegation, the Ananda and Arati Trust was not formed seven years ago. It was founded by a registered deed in 1961. The Tiljaja post office has been a tenant of the trust for 40 years. The agreement to construct the market was violated by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. 

 A.K. Mukherjee,

 Ananda and Arati Trust

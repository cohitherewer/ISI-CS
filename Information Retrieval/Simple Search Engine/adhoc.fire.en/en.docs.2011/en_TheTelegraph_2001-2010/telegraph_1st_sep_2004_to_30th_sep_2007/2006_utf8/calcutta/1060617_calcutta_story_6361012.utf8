 Kumar Prasad Mukhopadhyay (1927 - 2006) successfully set standards of excellence in all the multifarious activities of his life. One of the most analytical music critics in the country, he took to musicology and teaching, even authoring a new genre of books on classical music. His khayal singing was closest in style to that of Ustad Faiyaz Khan. A prolific trilingual orator, globetrotter, photographer, voracious reader, connoisseur of cricket, food and other finer things of life, his ready wit and humour charmed one and all. This evening, his disciples and admirers, in association with the department of information and culture, West Bengal and Jalsaghar Foundation, present a memorial programme that aims to display all aspects of his magnificent personality. Besides homage to Mukhopadhyay by the city?s eminent cultural figures, Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar will pay a musical tribute through a vocal recital.

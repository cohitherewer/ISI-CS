The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

All roads lead to Fanaa

Screen On amp; Off

 They do not like talking to the media about their movies. He may talk about the Narmada Bachao Andolan victims or how the Indian media has lost its way, but Aamir Khan won?t talk Fanaa. She may talk about her marriage or how she can?t stay away from her daughter, but Kajol won?t talk Fanaa.

 That was till today. Come Thursday night and Aamir and Kajol will speak out on the small screen before the big-screen arrival on Friday of their first movie opposite each other. The two did come together in the multi-starrer Ishq but Fanaa will be the first film where Aamir gets to romance Kajol.

 Contrary to expectation, the two will not speak only about the film but will feature in a freewheeling chat about themselves as persons and their experience of working together. 

 ?Aamir and Kajol will be talking, questioning and pondering over things together, which people don?t know and associate with them,? says a source co-ordinating the chat which will create a ?media roadblock? of sorts on Thursday at 8 pm.

 Not only will six national TV channels ? Sony, SET MAX, MTV, NDTV India, NDTV 24x7 and NDTV Profit ? beam the chat, you can even catch the web streaming of the same on both Yahoo India and MSN.

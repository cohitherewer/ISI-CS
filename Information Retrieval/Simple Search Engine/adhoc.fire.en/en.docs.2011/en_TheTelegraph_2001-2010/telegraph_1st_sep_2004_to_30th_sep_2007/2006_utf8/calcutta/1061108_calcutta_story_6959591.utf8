 What: 

 Lets Smoke Up. 

 Where: West View Bar and 

 Grill at ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton and Towers.

 When: Till November 12.

 The spread: In addition to grills on the regular menu, the festival offers an array of smoked delicacies. Start off with the Smoked Tuscan Onion Soup (though hardly smoky) with an assortment of breads. Try the Norwegian Smoked Salmon served on toasted bagels with acidulated cream and lemon embellished with herbed jardinire dressing or Vine Ripened Smoked Bell Peppers stuffed with smoked scamorza and fresh herbs on a base of rustic cherry tomato ragout.

 Freshen up your taste buds with a little Ginger and Red Wine Granita before moving on to the main course. If you want something vegetarian, opt for the Smoked Mozzarella and Mushroom Stuffed Tortellini tossed in a wild mushroom sauce with broccoli and asparagus oven-baked with scamorza. If you want non-vegetarian, you are spoilt for choice. Theres Cajun Spice Infused Smoked Spring Chicken served in a pool of shallots, mushroom and rosemary jus with a bouquetiere of vegetables and garlic mash; Herb Crusted Smoked Duck Breast drizzled with red wine and orange reduction and accompanied with sauted snow peas and parsley potatoes as well as Bavarian Beer Sausages in a smoked pepper and sun-dried tomato sauce with pommery mustard and caramelised onions. Round off your dinner with a delicious Crme Brulee.

 Pocket pinch: The a la carte dishes available for dinner are priced between Rs 700 and Rs 1,200.

 Voiceover: Innovative food promotions like these offer us a chance to break the monotony of the regular fare while giving a chance to our chefs to showcase their best, said executive chef Ramesh Javvaji.

 Woven yards

 What: Back to Bhagalpur, an exhibition. 

 Where: Darbari at P 249 Purna Das Road.

 When: Till November 10.

 Take a look: Darbari is hosting an exhibition of Bhagalpuri saris, suit pieces and dupattas. The colour palette covers a variety of shades earthy tones like rust, beige, off-white to jewel tones like turquoise, ruby red, emerald green and sapphire blue. Weavers are directly showcasing their stuff and as a result there are some unconventional patterns, textures and two-tone colour threadwork. 

 ock prints and discharge prints are also used for value addition to the Bhagalpuri pieces.

 Pocket pinch: Prices range between Rs 600 and Rs 3,500. 

 Voiceover: Darbari 

 is going to be visiting different parts of India in quest 

 of the best. The idea is to expose Calcutta to the rest 

 of our country, smiled Sujata Dey from the store.

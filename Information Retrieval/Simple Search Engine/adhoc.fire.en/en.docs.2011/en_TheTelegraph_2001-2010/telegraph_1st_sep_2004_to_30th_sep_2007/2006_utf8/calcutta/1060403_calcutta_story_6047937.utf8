 Calcutta Column

 The air-hostess training institutes are nothing but avenues to earn money by 

attracting the younger generation to ?glamourised? professions. My niece, who 

has high power in her eyes, fell into this trap and got admission in Frankfinn 

Institute of Air Hostess Training in Calcutta. While enrolling her, the authorities 

did not tell her that power in eyes could be a problem in getting a job in the 

aviation industry. After completing her course, most of the airlines have rejected 

her on this ground. Not only this, the diploma given to the passouts do not bear 

any seal or stamp of the institute. Therefore, its validity is doubtful. Besides, 

even after spending more than a lakh on a one-year course, these institutes do 

not promise 100 per cent job placement.

 The allegation is not at all true. While enrolling students, we judge them 

on various criteria like communication, appearance, eye power etc. In this, eye 

power is one of the important aspect for aviation industry. For example, we if 

find that a candidate is confident, smart and fits in all other areas except eye 

power, we at once suggest him or her to visit the doctor and get it corrected. 

And if the eye power cannot be corrected by any operation or surgery, then we 

assure them jobs in other industries like tourism or hospitality but not in aviation. 

I will request this particular candidate to visit us, so that we can try for her 

again.

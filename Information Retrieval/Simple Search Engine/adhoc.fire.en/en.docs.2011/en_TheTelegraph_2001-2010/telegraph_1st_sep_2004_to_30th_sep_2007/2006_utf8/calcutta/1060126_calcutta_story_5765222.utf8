 His world is dominated by colour, specially its luminosity. Dr Utpal Chakraborty?s paintings are a veritable hymn in praise of colours and their magical power to reflect light. The ongoing exhibition of his works articulates his desire to seek from nature the secret of its power to capture and radiate that ethereal glow which infuses life into all that it touches. In his paintings, nature appears in an indirect, abstract way, through a series of subtle shades symbolising the six seasons of his native country, Bangladesh. Whether they be the yellow of summer, the black and dark green of monsoon, the mystical blue of sarat (the early Indian autumn), the golden-ochres of hemanta (late autumn), the blue-grey of winter or the bright orange and red of spring, the hues of his homeland are covered by a warm sentimental glow, expressing Chakraborty?s nostalgic emotions. Worked upon first with an airbrush and then a paintbrush, his canvases have a softness that imparts to them a calm and serene quality.

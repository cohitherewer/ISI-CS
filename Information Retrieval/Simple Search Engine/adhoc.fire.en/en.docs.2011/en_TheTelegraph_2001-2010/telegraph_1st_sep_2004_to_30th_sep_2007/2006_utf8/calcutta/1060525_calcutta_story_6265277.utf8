 Writers? Buildings had to step in on Wednesday to broker a truce in Tollywood, torn by a dispute between two rival groups of technicians.

 The resolution, at the end of the two-hour-long meeting involving government officials and representatives of various unions, was the formation of an arbitration committee.

 The meeting was attended by the two rival unions ? Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India, and Broadcast Quality Video Technicians and Workers Association of West Bengal (also known as Video Guild) ? Artistes? Forum, Eastern India Motion Picture Association (Eimpa) and the producers? association.

 ?A committee comprising members of all five organisations is being formed to ensure that such disruptions don?t occur again. We have requested for government representation in the committee,? said Prosenjit, secretary of Artistes? Forum that helped resolve the crisis.

 As for the ongoing face-off over work distribution, it was decided that merit would be the main criterion in choosing technicians, irrespective of which association they belong to. ?And this will be the prerogative of directors and producers,? added Tollywood?s biggest star.

 On a day that saw the resumption of shooting, the Tollywood representatives met Dilip Chakraborty, principal secretary, information and cultural affairs, and Joydeep Mukherjee, confidential assistant to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 ?Under no circumstances should any shooting be stopped. If such complaints come then the government will take severe action,? said Chakraborty.

 Denying allegations of bringing shooting to a halt for two days, Video Guild vice-president Ladly Mukherjee said: ?We are satisfied with the outcome of the meeting. Apart from fair work distribution, the committee will also look into several other demands of technicians.?

From the top celebrity photographer to a Bollywood 

producer... was getting into film-making always on your agenda?

It?s been quite some time that I have been toying 

with the idea of getting into film production but I honestly didn?t know that 

it would happen so quickly. In fact, I also plan to direct a movie some day but 

before that I want to go through the routine of a film production. When I am a 

little more confident, I will digress to the other art form.

So how was your first production experience?

Alag was a beautiful and humbling experience. 

It taught me simple things like not going over the top on everything, learning 

how to deal with a situation, how to react to people. I am usually a person who 

gives in to a lot of emotions. That doesn?t work if you are a producer. There 

are so many people trusting you. You suddenly feel so responsible.

Why did you go for Ashu Trikha as your director, 

after two flop films in Deewanapan and Sheesha?

That comes from my whole take on life. See, no single 

person has had a 100 per cent success ratio. For a film to be successful, a lot 

of other factors come into play like the script, the right set-up and above all 

God?s grace. I can name you so many right films which have fallen flat because 

they were not produced correctly. You can?t discount someone as a bad talent if 

he hasn?t got a hit. 

At least you could have picked your cast from your 

friends in the industry like Abhishek or Shah Rukh, Sushmita or Bipasha?

I may sound philosophical but I would like to be in 

a certain position before approaching any of them for my film. I want to be at 

a particular stage as a professional before I can request them to be part of my 

films. It should be a mutual give and take rather than me putting them in an uncomfortable 

position by forcing them to work for me. Of course, I have plans to have stars 

like Abhishek and Shah Rukh in films from my banner. Also, people like Akshay 

Kapoor and Dia Mirza are genuinely talented in their own right and my job is to 

spot such talent.

What is the basic story of Alag?

Alag is the story of a boy who is not normal. 

He is superhuman, with special powers. But unlike a Spiderman or a Superman, he 

is not accepted in society. He is pushed aside as a freak, initially.

Are you trying to send out some message?

Yes, there are a lot of special people in society 

and the way we look at them is not right. And I am not even talking about people 

who are physically or mentally challenged. Even someone with six fingers or an 

extra toe? Our immediate reaction is, ?Oh, ok?? Here in Alag you have a 

boy who doesn?t have a strand of hair on his body because he is electromagnetic. 

And he is challenging the norm by trying to be a part of society.

Are you happy with the way your maiden venture 

has turned out?

I am proud of my film more than all my exhibitions 

and galleries put together. As for the performances of Akshay and Dia, I have 

only praise for them. They were extremely committed and very professional.

What about the movie?s similarities with Krrish?

Krrish and Alag are as similar as Batman 

and Spiderman. The fact that both the main characters have special powers may 

be same. But from what I have seen in Krrish?s promos, Hrithik?s character 

comes from a village and he is well liked there. In my film, Akshay?s character 

has been in isolation for 18 years. If someone compares my film to Rakesh Roshan?s 

film, I am honoured. But it is not fair to the man who has been at it for all 

these years. Their budget is reportedly between Rs 50 and 60 crore. That means 

that their costume budget is bigger than our total budget.

Why do you feel we are suddenly opening up to special-effects 

movies?

We Indians have become more open to watching films 

beyond the romance of a handsome Punjabi man and a beautiful south Indian lady. 

The education levels have increased and, of course, the technology is now available 

to us. Prasad Labs has done the special effects for both Krrish and Alag. 

My film has more than 50 minutes of special effects, including the last 15 minutes.

As an ace photographer, how were you involved with 

the images of Alag?

I did get into anything even remotely to do with images 

and photography. At no point of time did I exercise my power as a producer but 

I did make my points. We have gone for very dark lighting in patches to strike 

the right emotional chord. We have also gone for a definite colour palette.

Finally, what about your master stroke ? the music 

video promoting Alag?

Well, I just prayed vigorously (laughs). No, 

it?s something I have been planning for quite some time... to get together everyone 

from Shah Rukh to Abhishek to Sushmita to Bipasha to come forward and push the 

cause of the film. They all did it instantly. I am sure the video will help Alag 

get noticed.

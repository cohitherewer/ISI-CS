 Family of slain lives in fear

 - Court seeks status report from police

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 They lost their son to the menace of Kali puja subscription on October 21. They live in fear as his killers are still at large and never far from their doorstep. Police have done precious little to protect them till now and the Jhas of Kidderpore are now at the final door of despair.

 Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed Rajiv Misra, deputy commissioner of police (port), to file a report stating what steps had been taken to protect Dhaneswar Jha, whose son Bikram, 20, was murdered for refusing Kali puja subscription to a local club.

 Justice Dipankar Dutta, in his order, also asked Misra to state why he had failed to arrest two of the accused named in the FIR Dipu and Bhola. The court asked police to arrest them immediately. 

 Dhaneswar Jha, a resident of Karl Marx Sarani, in Kidderpore, under South Port police station, had petitioned the court alleging that an influential political leader of the area was shielding the culprits who were tormenting the family and almost holding them in house arrest.

 Lawyer Subroto Mookherjee said: After his sons murder on October 21, my client had lodged an FIR with South Port police station, alleging that Pankaj Gupta, Rajlal Srivastav, Dipu and Bhola had killed Bikram as he had refused to pay Rs 10,000 as Kali puja subscription to Adi Shakti Club. Police arrested Pankaj and Rajlal, but Bhola and Dipu are roaming free in the area.

 Mookherjee alleged that the Jha family was being hounded by the two. Bhola and Dipu are not allowing them to leave their residence. My client, an employee of the Nepal Consulate in Calcutta, cannot leave for office and his daughter cannot go to school. Mookherjee added: Police have told my client that a local leader was shielding the two culprits and so their hands were tied.

 Appearing on behalf of the state, advocate B. Nath argued that the key accused had been arrested and Dipu and Bhola could not be picked up as they were absconding.

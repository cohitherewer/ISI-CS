The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 This loveable, vibrant and quirky city that I call home that is what Konkona Sen Sharma has to introduce her world this Sunday at 8.30 pm. As the anchor of the Calcutta episode of Discovery Travel amp; Livings Indian Rendezvous, Konkona had quite a job on her hands.

 It is my city. But there was so much that I did not know and places I had never been to, the actress wonders aloud over phone from Mumbai.

 We wanted to present a new India and deliberately stayed away from tired images like cows crossing roads, says Ajit Oomen, director, Ariaa Productions, which has produced the series.

 So there Konkona was, tasting tea at J. Thompson and Sons, a tea-auction house in the tea-trading gateway of India. Its nothing like drinking tea. One takes a bit in the mouth, rinses with it and spits it all out after a few moments, she recalls.

 This element of surprise and fun has been a feature of every episode in the series which also covers Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. Like Konkona at the tea tasters, Sushama (Reddy, the Mumbai hostess) was a first-timer at the Mahalaxmi race course. She tried her hand at betting and lost. Nagesh (Kukunoor in Hyderabad) never knew arena polo was so fast and played in such a small ground, laughs Oomen.

 Thus, the show finds Konkona taking 

 a ride in a heritage tram, boating in Nalban, watching Bickram 

 Ghosh slap up a tabla beat and Tanushree Shankar training 

 students in new-age moves. But then theres Konkona on 

 College Street, too. Though I have been there often before, 

 the Coffee House belongs more to my mothers generation. 

 But they (the production team) had done good research, 

 Konkona says. What she forgot to mention were the rosogollas 

 she gulped at KC Das (picture above).

 Oomen points out that the anchors chosen were in sync with the character of the city. Vasundhara (Das) is laidback and chilled out like Bangalore, Sushama, an MTV VJ, embodies the frenetic pace and high energy of Mumbai while Nagesh has Hyderabads Nawabi culture. Konkona, cultured and classy, brought her inputs to the table like others, be it on football or phuchka.

 Back from Varanasi after shooting for Pradeep Sarkars yet-unnamed film with Rani Mukherjee, Konkona is happy to debut as an anchor on the international network. Its great that so many people round the world would see our city on Discovery Travel amp; Living. Ask her why Indians would watch a show on Indian cities and she flares up: If we can watch those stupid Hindi serials which are also about our lives, why cant we have time for this?

 What: Fashion Spectrum 2006, the annual fest of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT).

 Where: NIFT campus, Block LA, Plot 3B, Salt Lake.

 When: January 31 to February 2.

 E-quotient: Be it the innovative decor, the fashion choreography or the event management, every aspect of the annual extravaganza was taken care of by the students.

 In sync with the theme ? Maati ? the campus was done up with thatched stalls and jute hangings. Madhubani paintings adorned the walls. 

 The three-day affair had quite a long entertainment list. The craft workshops had artisans showcasing craft forms like clay modelling, macrame jewellery making, woodcraft and shola work. Competitions like face and body painting and dance contests added to the fun. 

 The event also displayed works by students of the institute. From sketches, textiles and samples to dresses and T-shirts with screen prints, the works were showcased through an exhibition. A stall from Sasha displayed handwoven bags, fish-shaped coin bags and photo frames among other items.

 A fashion show on Wednesday evening drew inspiration from Zapatista ? a movement in Mexico for ethnic rights. The 19 sequences designed, choreographed and modelled by the students paid tribute to revolutionaries in the sphere of art, music, politics and more.

 From coats teamed with skirts and pleated trousers, to trendy knitwear and interesting dhotis and saris, the collection was an assortment of Indian and western garbs. Electric blues, sober pinks, earthy browns and fiery oranges dominated the colour palette.

 Among the audience were designers Sharbari Datta and Abhishek Dutta along with Shantmanu, director of NIFT.

 Voiceover: ?We work very closely with rural artisans. Learning lessons from village art is a major part of our curriculum. So, we decided on Maati as the theme,? said Jayati Mukherjee, assistant professor of design and student development activity co-ordinator of NIFT.

 What: Launch of single estate tea brand Yellobright by Dwarika Investment Pvt Ltd.

 Where: Moksh at 22, Camac Street.

 When: February 1.

 The launch: Designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, quite a tea connoisseur, graced the launch, looking his usual cool self in denims and a blue shirt. ?In no part of the country is the tea culture as popular as in West Bengal. So let?s keep the spirit of tea alive,? smiled the designer.

 A visual presentation highlighted various aspects of the product. The tea leaves are from the Tirrihannah tea garden in the Terai region of Darjeeling. 

 The leaves grown within the confines of a single garden are picked with care, imparting a distinct aroma, flavour and taste. 

 It has antioxidant properties and three cups of Yellobright tea equals the nutritional value of six apples.

 Launches in Bangalore, Delhi and other major cities are on the pipeline.

 Voiceover: ?The product is priced at Rs 54 for a 250 gm packet. It will be a tea drinker?s delight,? said Archana Lakhotia, managing director, Yellobright.

 Perhaps influenced by his early training in printmaking, Dipak Banerjee is one among the very few artists in India today who believes in making his own colours. Following a traditional recipe using dyes made from herbs and vegetables, he prepares the ground of his fine silk, pasting it over paperboard. Beyond Space and Time, the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, is inspired by tantric symbolism, which offers him the best pictorial tools to structure his art. The works on show deserve a closer look for Banerjee?s ability to draw the geometric accuracy of tantric symbols with the unmistakable devotion of a master in the tradition of Indian miniature painting. His variation from cold precision to the warmth of a freer flow of line and colour in some of the paintings of the current series, proves the strength of his remarkable control on his medium, which, technically speaking, is of his own making. Though largely remaining faithful to his keen interest and understanding of Indian mystical philosophy, the veteran artist has also travelled uncharted territories of visual art to develop his theme with a matching style. A must-see exhibition for connoisseurs of the fine arts.

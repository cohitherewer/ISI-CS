 The annual South Calcutta Pigeon Flying Contest took off on the misty Christmas morning on a field off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.

 Hundreds of homing pigeons rose to the air, their plumes glistening white, black or brown in the backdrop of the morning sky. The contest was organised by Dakshin Calcutta Payra Premik Association.

 Over 100 pigeon trainers, mostly from south Calcutta and South 24-Parganas, participated in the contest.

 The birds have to find their way home. The owner who has the maximum number of birds returning to him in the shortest period of time is the winner, explained Prabir Das, 30,who has been training pigeons since childhood.

 Every winter, Das and several other trainers take their pigeons to various contests across the city and on its fringes. Over the years, the count of pigeon trainers has grown.

 I have had pigeons since my school days. We all have hectic schedules. But when I come back from work and these pigeons come fluttering around me, perching on my head and hands, I feel great, smiled Das, who works as a X-ray technician and invests a major chunk of his earnings on his feathered friends. Pigeons are available for Rs 100 to Rs 500 at the Galiff Street market, he added. 

 The contests were initially confined to central and north Calcutta, but are now held across the city on a zonal basis. The grand finale of all the contests is organised on Brigade Parade Grounds in January.

 These contests are organised on international and national levels, too. There, the thrust is on racing pigeons. In Calcutta, racing pigeons are used for contests mainly in north Calcutta and North 24-Parganas. There are contests where the criterion is how long a bird can stay in the air. Our birds are of a different breed. They fly in flocks at a medium height and come back home before three hours, he explained.

 Special diets are advised for the contestant pigeons: paddy, wheat, corn, bajra, along with special doses of health drinks like Milo, calcium and vitamins. 

 A few contestants also attempt to acquire their rivals pigeons, to increase the count. Often, the birds get confused and fly back with wrong groups. Crackers and sly traps are also used to capture them. We are tense till all our birds come back, signed off Das.

 There is no recognition for the contests, rued Das. There is no money... Our only satisfaction lies in being crowned the best trainer.

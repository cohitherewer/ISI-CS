 Demand dry, supply line choked

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The largest wholesale markets for chicken and egg in town have warned that the bird flu panic could cause the supply line to run dry by the end of this week.

 ?We have stopped taking fresh supplies from Wednesday since there are so few takers for chicken,? said chairman of New Market Poultry Owners? Welfare Association Shanawaz Khan on Wednesday.

 According to Khan, New Market, the biggest wholesale market for chicken, receives a daily supply of 50,000 broilers from Baduria, Habra and Basirhat. 

 On both Monday and Tuesday, the market received 10,000 chickens, but about 60 per cent remained unsold. ?It?s also not possible to accept supply of chickens from Andhra Pradesh or Maharashtra now,? added Khan.

 Sealdah is the biggest wholesale egg market, with a daily supply of 50 lakh eggs, mainly from Andhra Pradesh. Bibhuti Bhusan Saha, an office bearer of Sealdah Wholesale Egg Merchants Association, said: ?With demand dropping, we have informed companies in Andhra to suspend supply.?

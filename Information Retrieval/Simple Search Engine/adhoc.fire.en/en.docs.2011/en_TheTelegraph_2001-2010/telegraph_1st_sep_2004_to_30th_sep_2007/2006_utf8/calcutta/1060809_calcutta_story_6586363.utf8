 Collapse sequel 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) housing estate, where four balconies collapsed on Saturday night, suffered another mishap on Tuesday morning.

 The roof of a flat in Block II the earlier mishap struck Block III caved in, trapping 70-year-old Bokul Chakraborty and her 17-year-old granddaughter Sushama. Neighbours rushed to the spot on hearing their cries and brought them out to safety.

 We had a miraculous escape. We would have been crushed to death had the chunks fallen on us, said Bokul. The woman was offering puja when the roof caved in.

 CIT chief engineer Debabrata Biswas visited the site and said repairs would be undertaken from Wednesday. A thorough renovation, however, will have to wait for funds.

 The estate has six buildings, comprising 210 flats, constructed in 1975 to accommodate those who were evicted for the construction of Bijon Setu. No repair work was carried out in the past two decades.

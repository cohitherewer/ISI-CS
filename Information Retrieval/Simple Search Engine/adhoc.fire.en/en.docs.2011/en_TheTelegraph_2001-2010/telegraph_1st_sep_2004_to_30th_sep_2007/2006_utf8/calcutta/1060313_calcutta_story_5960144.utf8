 The post-mortem report of murdered doctor Jayanta Ghosh has revealed that his throat was slit before he was thrown off a bridge on the river Mayurakshi, in Murshidabad, and left to die.

 The 62-year-old doctor was in his senses when his throat was slit. The abductors did not drug him in any way because his stomach was found empty during post-mortem, the report said. According to the sleuths, this indicates that the men did not stop for food on the way to Murshidabad.

 ?We have received the post-mortem report. It would take us some time to analyse the findings. But it appears that the doctor was not made unconscious before being killed,? said D.P. Tarenia, inspector general of police, CID (II).

 Ghosh went missing on March 6 from his north Calcutta chamber. He was found with his throat slit on next morning. His shradh was conducted on Sunday.

 The detectives investigating the case believe the doctor was taken to Sunderpur, in Barwan, Murshidabad, at the insistence of some of the gang members. The place where the doctor was thrown off the car had been identified in advance. 

 The members of the gang in Murshidabad chose the spot since it was secluded, said the cops.

 ?The abductors had decided beforehand that they would throw off the doctor on that spot. They were sure that they would be able to do so without attracting attention. For an outsider, it is very difficult to find the spot or get there without being very sure about the terrain,? said a senior investigating officer of the CID. 

 Cops are clueless about what prompted an unidentified gang member to make a call from an STD booth in Kalyani to Ghosh?s residence in Salt Lake?s GD Block on the afternoon of March 6.

 After several rounds of interrogation of the booth-owner, the sleuths have learnt that the youth who made the call told Anima, the doctor?s wife, that the family would get to know about his whereabouts after 8 in the evening. 

 ?The caller apparently told Anima that the doctor would be late. The gang member hadn?t stopped at the booth alone. According to the owner of the booth, the caller added on the phone that Ghosh?s whereabouts will be known after 8 pm. We don?t know why he said so. For that matter, we are not sure why he made the call at all,? the officer stated. The booth-owner had subsequently received a couple of threat calls from Maharashtra. 

 The cops have questioned the owner of the chamber on Raja Manindra Road, where the doctor practised, to find out the details of the contract between them.

 From the leads obtained so far, police said, it appears that a big gang was responsible for the doctor?s murder.

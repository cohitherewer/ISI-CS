The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Talk time for text messages

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Debabrata Sengupta is 65 years old. He bought a cellphone two years ago, but cannot see the keypad clearly. He uses the phone only to call people. 

 Priyesh Shaw does not know English, and hence, cannot SMS.

 The Talk SMS offer by Airtel not only frees people like Debabrata and Priyesh from pecking at the keys, but allows them to be heard without making a call. Calcutta will be the first city where the facility will be available.

 Starting from Wednesday, any Airtel user was able to record voice messages by dialling 363 followed by the cellphone number of the recipient. An intimation will be sent to the recipient. He or she will be able to hear the message in the voice of the sender and can also reply through Talk SMS. The service will be limited to Airtel subscribers for now.

 Like text messages, each Talk SMS would cost the sender Re 1. The recipient would not be charged for hearing the message.

 ?There are many people who have some problem or the other with sending text messages. While some find the procedure complicated, those with low-end handsets have problems with settings and language. The Talk SMS is targeted at that group,? said a spokesperson of the mobile service provider. 

 N.V. Subba Rao, chief operating officer, Mobility Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd, which owns Airtel, stated: ?The Talk SMS will enable new users, those with older sets and the aged to communicate without keying in messages.?

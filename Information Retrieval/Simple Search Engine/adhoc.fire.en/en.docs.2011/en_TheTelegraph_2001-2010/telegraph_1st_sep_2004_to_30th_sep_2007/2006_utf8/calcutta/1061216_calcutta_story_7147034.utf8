 A series of theatre festivals 

 colours the citys winter months (November-January). Close 

 on the heels of the Nandikar National Theatre Festival (December 

 16-25) comes Aneeks Ganga Jamuna Natyotsav (December 25-31). 

 And if 2006 closes with an all-night theatre fest by Anya 

 Theatre, the new year begins with a nine-day festival by 

 Lokkrishti (January 6-14). The thread running through the 

 festivals is the tribute to Henrik Ibsen, George Bernard 

 Shaw and Maxim Gorky.

 The ninth edition of Ganga Jamuna Natyotsav will be staged across Rabindra Sadan, Girish Mancha, Sisir Mancha and Madhusudan Mancha. The diversity and quality of plays are the highpoints of this multilingual event, says Aneeks director Amalesh Chakraborty. 

 The spread features Dhaka-based Shubachans Khudito Pashan and Rupabati, Ichchhe Mrityu by South Asian Ibsen Centre, also from Bangladesh, Aswath Bhatts solo act Ek Mulaqat Manto Se and Orissa-based Satabdir Kalakars Ruddhadwar.

 Other participants are Samsaptaka from Delhi, Nagpur Bengali Association, Ritwik of Behrampore and Calcutta groups Pancham Vaidik (Poshukhamar), Rangakarmee (Rudali), Aneek (Punorjibon and Dwitiya Basanta) and Sayak (Dildaar), among others. 

 Childrens plays will be staged at Madhusudan Mancha Calcutta Choirs Thakumar Jhuli, Peoples Little Theatres puppet show Aswamedh and Nehru Children Museums Anubhav. The festival also showcases school and college theatre with a day-long university stage competition on December 26 at Sisir Mancha.

 Anya Theatres all-night stage bash on December 31 begins at Academy of Fine Arts at 6 pm with a speech on Ibsen and Shaw by Shamik Bandopadhyay, followed by Soumitra Chattopadhyays reading from a Shaw play. 

 The year marks the death centenary of Ibsen and the 150th birth anniversary of Shaw, and since Shaw was deeply inspired by Ibsen we thought it fitting to present a combined tribute, said Anya Theatre director Bibhas Chakraborty.

 From 10 pm, the action shifts to Rabindra Sadan where Swapnasandhani will premiere Moy Danab, an Ibsen play directed by Koushik Sen. More Ibsen in abridged forms follows with Wild Duck, directed by Suranjana Dasgupta, and A Dolls House, directed by Abanti Chakraborty. 

 Arun Mukhopadhyays adaptation of Shaws How He Lied to Her Husband and Biplab Bandopadhyays version of Dark Lady of the Sonnets will give way to Goutam Haldars innovative punch of poetry, theatre and music, Kabyegane.

 An open-air Barshobaran at midnight will be followed by Alternative Living Theatres Victimised and Anya Deshs Jakhon Andho Prakriti Chandalika.

 The Lokkrishti festival, at BD Mancha and Purbasree EZCC in Salt Lake, features Swapnasuchanas Hemlat-The Prince of Garanhata and Lokkrishtis Page 4, both directed by Bratya Basu; Cinetels Homa Pakhi directed by Soumitra Chattopadhyay; Swapnasandhanis Shuprabhat and Khonj, directed by Koushik Sen; Theatre Passions Anukul; Anya Theatres Amaresher Kando; Mohit Chattopadhyays Ai Ghum; Shanadhos Mother. 

 Theatre journal Mancha Mukhar will be launched on the occasion.

 We are holding the festival at two venues as our audiences are growing by the year, said Phalguni Chatterjee of Lokkrishti.

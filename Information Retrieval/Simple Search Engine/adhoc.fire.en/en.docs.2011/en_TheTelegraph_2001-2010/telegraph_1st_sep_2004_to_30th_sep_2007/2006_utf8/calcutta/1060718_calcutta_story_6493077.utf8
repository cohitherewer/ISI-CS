 You share your birthday with...

 Nelson Mandela and Priyanka Chopra

 You have your own set of rules and ideals. You love travelling and seeing the world. You are a person with experiences and exciting stories to tell. You live from one challenge to another. The minute you step out of your comfort zone, you succeed. You can never be crooked or sly in your dealings. ? Kusum Bhandari

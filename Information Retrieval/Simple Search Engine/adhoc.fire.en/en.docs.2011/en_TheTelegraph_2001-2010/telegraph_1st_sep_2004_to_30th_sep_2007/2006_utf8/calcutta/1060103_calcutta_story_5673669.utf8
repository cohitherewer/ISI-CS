 Residents of Tiretta Bazar, off Lalbazar police headquarters, woke up to a strange spectacle on Monday morning ? a youth sitting in a large cage meant for carrying live chicken, with the door padlocked. 

 As people flocked around and watched him in strange delight, the youth sat shivering inside, barely able to hold his body inside the cage. 

 It was much later that the residents realised that the youth had been nabbed by some night guards, who had suspected him to be a thief.

 The guards claimed that the youth had been moving around suspiciously late at night. They caught hold of him and beat him up before locking him in the cage. 

 The youth has been identified as Mohammed Kader Lashkar, a resident of Cossipur village, in Joynagar, South 24-Parganas.

 ?We came to know after a preliminary interrogation that Kader was a ragpicker. He also occasionally lifted household items. He is in our custody and we will grill him more to ascertain whether he has any his criminal antecedents,? said a senior officer of Bowbazar police station. 

 It was around 4 in the morning when a section of night guards at Tiretta Bazar spotted Kader moving around ?suspiciously? and trying to shuffle through some of items left by transport operators of the area. 

 Alarmed at the recent string of thefts, the guards immediately surrounded him and took him into their ?custody?. Even before he could utter anything, they started beating him up. 

 ?He was severely beaten up, particularly on the hands. This is very disconcerting. I pulled up the residents for taking the law into their hands, instead of informing police,? said the officer. 

 Kader was rescued much later, around noon, when a cop contingent arrived on the spot.

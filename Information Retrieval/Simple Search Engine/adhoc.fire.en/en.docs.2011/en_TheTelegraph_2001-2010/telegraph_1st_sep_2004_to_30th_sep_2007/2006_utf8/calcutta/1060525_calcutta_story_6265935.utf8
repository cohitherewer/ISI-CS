The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enter, knee surgery upgrade in city

 SUJATA SINGH ROY

 Mala Roy of Prince Anwar Shah Road is planning to take her 71-year-old mother to Apollo Hospital in Chennai for a knee-replacement surgery. Roy feels her mother will get the best treatment there, since the hospital has the latest equipment. 

 Roy is not an exception. About 60-70 patients made a beeline for Chennai and Mumbai in April for joint-replacement surgeries. Computer-aided orthopaedic surgery (CAOS) was the reason they left the city. This is set to change, with hospitals like Calcutta Medical Research Institute and Peerless Hospital gearing up to offer CAOS for knee replacement.

 According to orthopaedic and knee-replacement surgeon Chandrasekhar Dhar, CAOS cuts down the time taken for knee replacement by around half an hour. ?The equipment is new to us. The operating time will reduce once we get used to them,? he said.

 CAOS data is stored digitally for reference or investigation, should there be a need.

 A camera and sensors attached to the patient?s leg is linked with a computer screen, which reproduces a three-dimensional image of the surgical procedure, explained Dhar. 

 Metro witnessed a computer-aided knee-replacement surgery conducted by the head of the orthopaedics department of Peerless Hospital, P.K. Banerji.

 The sensors were fitted to the left leg of the patient, which was to be operated upon. The computer guided the surgeon at every step. It even helped in the alignment of the artificial joint with the patient?s body. 

 ?Computer-assisted knee replacement helps in ensuring perfect alignment of the artificial joint with the patient?s leg,? Dhar stated. 

 During the operation, the computer alerts the surgeon in case of an error. ?The error margin is, thus, brought down to zero,? the surgeon added.

 Knee-replacement by CAOS is, however, comparatively expensive. ?A conventional knee replacement costs between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. If a computer is used, the cost goes up by another Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000,? said Banerji.

 Both Banerji and Dhar felt that while traditional instruments used in knee-replacement surgery are calibrated, the use of computers is taking the procedure a step further. 

 CAOS is not a foolproof system, though. The computer cannot balance the soft tissues, ligaments and muscles around the knee. These have to be balanced by the surgeon. The final result can be cross-checked on the computer.

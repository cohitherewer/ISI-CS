The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fake disability ticket

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A businessman and his wife landed behind bars on Tuesday night for buying railway tickets at a concessional rate by falsely claiming to be physically challenged.

 Police said L. Khaitan, a Burrabazar-based trader of jute products, had even produced a certificate issued by a Kalyani hospital to prove that he was disabled.

 The ticket for his wife Saroj, too, was bought at the reduced rate, as a challenged person can take along his/her spouse as escort.

 The Khaitans were about to board the Jodhpur Express from platform No. 9 of Howrah station ? the couple had tickets for air-conditioned first-class travel ? when they were challenged by personnel of the railways? anti-fraud wing.

 Acting on a tip-off, the officers asked the Khaitans to produce their tickets and also the medical certificate. 

 Bearing no visible sign of being challenged, the trader, a resident of Howrah?s Watkins Lane, failed to convince the officers that the declaration in the certificate was true.

 Both were subsequently arrested. ?They were produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody for three days. An investigation has been launched,? said Taj Mohammed, inspector-in-charge of the Government Railway Police, Howrah.

 The sleuths are also investigating whether the trader had procured the medical certificate through a racket. 

 ?We are looking at the case from all angles. It?s unbelievable that a hospital has declared a person suffering from no disability as physically challenged,? an officer said.

 The Khaitans? arrest, however, was not an eye-opener for police. ?We have been getting tip-offs for quite some time that fit people are travelling on tickets meant for the challenged,? the officer added.

 The Indian Coffee House on CR Avenue, popularly known as House of Commons, was re-launched in a new avatar on Tuesday. On Thursday, the new-look address had to down shutters in a hurry. Reason: no water.

 The coffee house was one of the 200,000-plus household and commercial water connections that ran dry following disconnection of the Tallah pumping station from the Palta waterworks due to breaches in the five-ft-diameter water mains under BT Road, near India Statistical Institute (ISI).

 We have detected the leaks and work is on to plug them. Normal water supply will not resume before Friday morning, said chief engineer (water supply) of the civic body Bibhas Maity.

 People living in the zone between South Sinthee and Bhowanipore, entirely dependent on water from Tallah, were the worst hit.Those living between Tallah and Hatibagan did not even get their morning supply. There was no water from 7 am, said Joyeeta Banerjee of Bhowanipore. Shashi Damani of KK Tagore Street, in Burrabazar, added: Since the taps went dry abruptly this morning, we had to buy water for cooking and drinking.

 According to Arnab Das, who runs a shop near ISI, local residents had informed police late on Wednesday about water gushing out in jets from the road surface. Passengers in buses were drenched by the spray. 

 We plugged the leaks by dawn, but more breaches developed in the water mains. We had to eventually deal with about three dozen leaks on a five-metre stretch, said Maity. 

 Civic engineers took about seven hours to plug the leaks with wooden pegs before starting repairs on the 80-year-old water mains.

 Work on the line, which stretches 26 km, also disrupted traffic on BT Road.

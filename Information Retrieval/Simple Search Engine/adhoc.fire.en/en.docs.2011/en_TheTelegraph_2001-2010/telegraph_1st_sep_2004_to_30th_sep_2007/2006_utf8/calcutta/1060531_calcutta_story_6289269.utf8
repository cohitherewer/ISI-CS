The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clarion call 

 to spare the wall

 A step backwards, warns industry. 

 An ugly move, cry artists. Why must Buddha mess with our homes?

 A STAFF REPORTER

 LAW, WHAT LAW? A wall graffiti in the Taltala area, 

 in central Calcutta, hails the seventh Left Front government.

 The writing is on the wall, and 

 neither the arts nor industry likes what it says.

 The Left Front, flush from its 

 victory in the Assembly elections, has decided to repeal 

 the West Bengal Prevention of Property Defacement Act, 1976 

 , and then paint the town red.

 ?If the walls of private houses 

 can be defaced with impunity, why should Writers? Buildings 

 be spared?? demanded artist Jogen Chowdhury.

 With the CPM enjoying such superiority 

 in numbers in the Assembly, tabling the bill to repeal the 

 Act could be a mere formality. ?But this is a sad decision. 

 People paint their houses at their own expense and posters 

 will be pasted on these or graffiti will be scribbled on 

 the walls,? said Chowdhury.

 Aesthetic concerns were uppermost 

 on the mind of Ramananda Bandopadhyay, who is on the urban 

 arts commission to be set up by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 ?This election was an eye-opener. 

 It demonstrated how an election can be held successfully 

 without dirtying walls. If public opinion were sought it 

 would be clear that most people are against posters and 

 graffiti. This decision is meant to further the interests 

 of a handful of people,? alleged Bandopadhyay.

 For once, the aesthetic and the 

 industrial circles spoke in one voice. ?If this comes through, 

 it will be a retrograde step. It will be extremely counterproductive? 

 Calcutta has been quite a clean city for some time now. 

 If the government repeals the law without alternative guidelines, 

 Calcutta?s ugly syndrome is going to show its face again,? 

 warned Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, Indian Chamber of 

 Commerce (ICC).

 An official with a ringside view 

 of the state?s progress in information technology (IT) was 

 equally scathing: ?This is ridiculous? If a city has to 

 be marketed as a business destination on the fast track, 

 this is exactly what one shouldn?t do. A lot depends on 

 perception. If the walls in Sector V are covered with political 

 propaganda and posters, potential investors may even shy 

 away.?

 If the industry is worried about 

 showcasing a city plastered with political propaganda to 

 the international business community, mayor Bikash Ranjan 

 Bhattacharyya is not. Referring to the 1976 Act as ?baseless 

 and unscientific?, he said at Writers? Buildings on Tuesday: 

 ?All political parties in Bengal are responsible enough 

 and will not deface walls at random. If the owners of private 

 properties are willing to offer their walls for graffiti, 

 then why not??

 But going by what members of the 

 House Owners? Association had to say, owners of private 

 properties are hardly happy to hand over their walls. They 

 feel repealing the Act would infringe on the basic right 

 to their property and trigger turf battles among parties.

 Sukumar Rakshit of the association 

 said a movement would be launched and a writ petition filed 

 in the high court against the defacement move.

 ?Does Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee 

 have the right to infringe on another person?s personal 

 property?? demanded Samir Ghosh of the Calcutta Metropolitan 

 House Owners? Association, vowing to take the matter to 

 court.

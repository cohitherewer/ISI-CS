The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The most political of ?em all

 Metro picks Election Day to nominate the film, the actor and the actress of today on whom the changemaker tag rests the best 

 Rang De Basanti (Most political 

 film)

 There are only two ways to live 

 your life: let things be as they are, or do what you can 

 to change things around you. With these simple words, Aamir 

 Khan as DJ in Rang de Basanti urged a generation 

 in the audience to awaken ? and in the process awakened 

 the activist in the actor. Rang de Basanti is clearly 

 the most popular film with a political theme in recent times. 

 The tale tracing the life and death of DJ and gang ? from the bindaas boys on campus without a care in the world to modern-day revolutionaries ready to lay down their lives for a cause ? struck a chord with audiences young and old. 

 The juxtaposition of banter and bloodshed, tomfoolery and tragedy, yesterday?s revolution against British rule and today?s revolt against the political establishment all added up to high drama and heavy impact. 

 The result: the Rakeysh Omprakash 

 Mehra movie was the biggest hit of the year, drawing applause 

 from the audience, rocking night clubs and Nandan, and making 

 the politics of protest a talking point in classrooms and 

 kitty parties. It might not have awakened a generation, 

 but it sure did make ?E saala? quite fashionable, 

 friendship really fun and fighting for a cause most fulfilling.

 Aamir khan (Most political 

 actor)

 If Daljit Singh (DJ) grew up in a hurry in Rang de Basanti, Aamir Khan sure took time to rise from a reclusive actor into a righteous activist. The nudge may have come from wife Kiran Rao, but the push definitely came from his last three films: Lagaan, Mangal Pandey and most of all Rang de Basanti. He created history by becoming the first Bollywood superstar to step on to the streets and crusade a social cause. Narmada Bachao Andolan marked Aamir?s debut as activist. ?It is the duty of every citizen to speak out for the downtrodden and deprived,? announced the hero.

 Rahul bose (Special 

 mention)

 The actor-rugby-star-activist 

 will never generate the hype that Aamir did, but he sure 

 has backed many more socio-political causes over the years.

 Jaya bachchan

 (Most controversial political actress)

 What does it take for Jaya Bachchan 

 to beat husband Amitabh Bachchan to the front pages? A political 

 controversy, of course. The office-of-profit storm brought 

 the Mrs Bachchan vs Mrs Gandhi face-off into ugly focus, 

 and blew away both their Rajya Sabha seats ? Jaya?s by force, 

 Sonia by forfeit.

 nandita das (Most 

 political actress)

 Nandita Das defines herself as 

 a communicator rather than an actor these days. On screen, 

 she picks her parts and plays them well but it?s off screen 

 that she really seems to come into her own. Her causes range 

 from child rights to Indo-Pak relations, Gujarat riots to 

 literacy programmes. ?Acting is just a part of me; I feel 

 I need to explore so many other facets as a communicator 

 to be at some sort of peace with myself,? she says.

 A special mention for Nafisa 

 Ali for being here, there and everywhere. But A for effort, 

 Z for effect is how we would sum up her social sloganeering. 

 It would be so much better for those whose cause she champions 

 if she stayed silent!

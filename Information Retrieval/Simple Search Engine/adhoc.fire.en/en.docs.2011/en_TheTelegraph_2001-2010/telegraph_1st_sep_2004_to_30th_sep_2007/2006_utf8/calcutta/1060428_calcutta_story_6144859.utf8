 Tears at rare honour

 - Staff lays school bricks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Kamar Ali was performing the simple task of laying a brick, but he was overcome with emotion. The silver-haired employee of Calcutta International School had started working at the Lee Road campus in 1970, as a 17-year-old, having arrived from home in Orissa. 

 On Tuesday afternoon, the longest 

 serving employee of the school had the honour of being the 

 first staff member to lay a brick at the site of the new 

 campus near Ruby Hospital, on EM Bypass (picture by Pabitra

 Prior to the inauguration of the campus on April 30, each member of the staff laid bricks at the site on Tuesday. ?When I told him he had the honour of laying the founding brick, he broke into tears,? smiled principal Anuradha Das. 

 ?Sad? is how Ali felt when he first heard of the plans to move. But eventually, convinced that this would be a change for the better, he embraced the shift wholeheartedly. ?I have many memories of this place, but I look forward to the new school,? he said. 

 During his time, the character of the school has changed beyond recognition. ?When I first arrived, the children were mainly those of British expatriates, and there were only 10 staff members. Now, there are many more staff members and more Indian pupils,? stated Ali. 

 The school?s evolution over the years has brought some welcome changes, he felt. ?I got to know many more people as the school became bigger.? 

 The growth of the school from 50 to 500 pupils prompted the move, explained principal Das. The parking and congestion problems grew worse with the starting of Forum on Elgin Road, and with new developments in the pipeline, ?our situation will grow impossible?.

 But leaving the south Calcutta residence is obviously a huge wrench for the school. ?It was only the other day that the logistics of moving became an issue, and it suddenly hit me that we are actually leaving this place. The building has a lot of character. We?re all very sad to leave it, but we?ve recognised that we have simply grown too big for here,? she added.

 The new site will feature facilities that would have proven impossible to accommodate on the current campus. The new school will be three times larger than the Lee Road one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 ?They didn?t need me anymore? 

Screen On amp; Off

A year back, a lonely NAUSHAD ALI had given a rare interview 

to Metro over phone from Mumbai. We reproduce some of his lines and remember 

the musical maestro

 Moments from Mughal-e-Azam and Taj Mahal 

 one Naushads most acclaimed work, the other his most recent

 Why this conscious distancing from Bollywood music?

Mere vichaar alag hain. Unke alag hain. 

I didn?t like the projects that were being offered to me. Picturein bahut aati 

thi lekin main nahin karta tha. The youngsters are into something completely 

different these days. 

But it?s also a fact that they are watching what they 

are being made to watch and hearing what they are being made to hear. Nanga 

dance, daaku? yehi sab to 14 saal se ho raha hai. And 

all the children are growing up watching all this all the time.

 But didn?t you feel frustrated not being able 

to produce music all these years? 

Never. Main likhta raha. I have been writing 

all this while. As far as money is concerned, mujhe rupaiya thodi khana hai, 

do roti khana hai sirf. Also, I don?t think people felt my need anymore. 

 According to you, what is plaguing the film and 

music industry?

The new generation, including the film-makers, has 

no clue about our history and culture. Ask the youngsters about something traditional 

and they wouldn?t know anything about it. Kumbh ka mela unhein pata nahin, 

Benaras ka mandir unhein pata nahin, saawan ka mela unhein pata nahin. 

They don?t know enough. 

 Why do you think the music of Mughal-e-Azam 

worked even after 54 years? 

Hamare music ki buniyaad pe jo gaane bane 

hain, woh tab bhi jaise sunai dete the, aaj bhi waise sunai dete hain. Ragas 

like Bhairavi and Darbari sound the same irrespective of the year it is being 

heard. They don?t change with time. So the songs based on these simple ragas would 

appeal to everyone all the time. Raga agar dilchasp ho, to ek apnapan 

rehta hai and that?s why it works.

Know your naushad

 Naushad, who died on Friday

 Born and brought up in Lucknow, he studied 

classical music under Ustad Ghurbat Ali, Ustad Yusuf Ali and Ustad Babban Saheb.

 His musical career started by repairing harmoniums 

and composing for amateur theatre productions in Lucknow. 

 Once in Mumbai, his struggle started as he 

first worked as a pianist in composer Mushtaq Hussain?s orchestra. He then assisted 

Khemchand Prakash. 

 He composed independently for films like Prem 

Nagar (1940) and Sharda (1942) but scored big with Rattan (1944).

 One hit followed the other as Naushad helmed 

musicals like Shahjehan (1946), Anmol Ghadi (1946), Dard 

(1947), Dillagi (1949), Dulari (1949) and Andaaz (1949). 

He later scored for classics like Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam 

(1960), Ganga Jamuna (1961) and Pakeezah (1972).

 Naushad was the first to introduce sound mixing, 

separate recording of voice and music tracks, combined the flute and the clarinet, 

the sitar and the mandolin. He also introduced the accordion to Hindi film music. 

 He roped in classical artistes like Amir Khan 

and D.V. Pulaskar in Baiju Bawra (1952) and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in Mughal-e-Azam 

(1960). 

 He returned after 14 years to score music for 

Akbar Khan?s Taj Mahal in 2005.

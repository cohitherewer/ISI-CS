 Sleuths in black and white

 - Colour 

 code shift boosts force morale

 PRONAB MONDAL

 The sleuths are in for an image makeover through a change in dress and colour, which officers claim will have a therapeutic effect, too.

 Thus, out go Tees and jeans and in come white formals.

 A circular issued recently has requested all 10 officers in the detective departments dacoity wing to come to office in white shirts. And they have been barred from being seen in T-shirts or jeans while on duty.

 The entire team has accepted the colour code without a murmur of protest and is now all praise for it. 

 Colour leaves a significant impact on ones mind. It also reflects ones mindset and personality, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police, detective department. Now that the officers are donning white, they look more dignified than they used to.

 The dress scheme is the brainchild of officer-in-charge (dacoity) Abhranta Bandhu Majumdar. He was the first to wear a white shirt to office daily. A few days later, the additional officer-in-charge, who sits next to Majumdar, followed suit.

 The habit then slowly spread among the subordinates. Last month, Majumdar issued the circular asking all officers of sub-inspector rank to wear white shirts.

 The effect is telling, said an officer. The colour has boosted our confidence and given an extra weight to our personality, which tends to reassure the people.

 Majumdar said the officers have been asked to wear black trousers, if possible, to complement the white shirt.

 But why was white chosen, of all colours? Deputy commissioner Singh explained: White is the symbol of peace. And our duty is to maintain peace.

 Psychologist Mohua Ghosh feels that by wearing white, the officers of the dacoity section have segregated themselves, in a positive sense, from the rest of the force. The men now perform with a feeling that they belong to a class that is supposed to take care of your security.

 Elaborating on the ban on jeans and T-shirts, an officer said: They are fashionable and stylish, but we have nothing to do with fashion and style. 

 As for the constables, the officers are thinking of assigning a different colour, as white will be difficult for them to maintain.

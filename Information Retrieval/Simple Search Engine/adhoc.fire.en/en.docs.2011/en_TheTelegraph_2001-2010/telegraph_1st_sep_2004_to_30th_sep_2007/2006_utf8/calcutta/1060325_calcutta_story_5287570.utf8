 His home is a dingy shanty in the heart of Calcutta.

 His mother works as a domestic help to bring home Rs 1,300 a month and support his bedridden father, his ailing elder brother and him.

 His only source of nourishment is an occasional egg or cup of milk passed on by people his mother works for.

 Yet, he dreams of being a champion boxer.

 Mukesh Paswan, 15, is a braveheart boxer who refuses to throw in the towel despite every odd. 

 And with every hit that he takes in life, his resolve to rule the ring grows. Proof: the gold medal he won for Bengal in the 21st Junior National Boxing Championship at Noida in October 2005.

 But five months after the golden feat, life hasn?t been even a little less tough on the teenager. ?I don?t have my own boxing gloves? Till last month, I did not even have a pair of shoes. Somebody gave me Rs 200 and then I bought this pair for myself,? says Mukesh, at the door of a dingy room in Bhand Para, Sambhunath Pandit Street.

 That is where the budding boxer stays with his father, who would wash taxis for a living but has been confined to the bed since breaking his femur in an accident last year, his elder brother who is suffering from a prolonged bout of tuberculosis and his mother, the sole earning member.

 ?After taking care of his father and brother and running the house, I have nothing left to give to Mukesh. A boy like him needs a proper diet and training but?,? laments mother Minu Paswan.

 All that has not slowed Mukesh down. He spends two hours every day at the Bhowanipore Boxing Association, where he first started sparring at the age of 10. 

 His raw talent has earned him accolades and awards at the club and in district-level championships. 

 And then came the gold at the juniors.

 Besides giving him the confidence to go on, the medal has brought him a monthly Rs 100 stipend from the Bengal Amateur Boxing Federation.

 That, of course, amounts to nothing. 

 ?Physical fitness is a must in this sport. And that is only possible if the nourishment is proper. Mukesh is a very good boxer but given the adverse conditions, one wonders how far he would be able to go,? points out a senior at the club.

 But try telling Mukesh to hang up his gloves. ?Come what may, I am not quitting boxing for anything,? he declares. The dream of boxing bailing him and his family out drives this Million Dollar Baby.

 Wannabe parents in fertility feat 

Mid-30s limit for parents

 - Experts see taboo replaced by scramble for in vitro fertilisation

 KINSUK BASU

Nilima Chatterjee (name changed) always wanted to see herself high up on the professional ladder.

 With a degree in computer science from BE College, Shibpur (now Bengal Engineering and Science University), the 32-year-old from Narkeldanga struggled to become the team leader in an upper-end software firm in Salt Lake?s Sector V. But as she climbed up, she felt she could not afford the time to have a child.

 Nilima, who got married four years ago, wants to have a baby now, though doctors at a fertility clinic have told her that she can?t conceive naturally. Still in a hurry, Nilima can?t wait for a lengthy treatment. She and her husband have opted for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). 

 Couples who deferred having children for careers are paying a ransom for their decision. But because they still cannot afford to take a long break from their careers, couples who could have conceived naturally after treatment through medicine are opting for IVF.

 The trend has picked up so much that several city clinics have opened counselling centres to convince couples that in vitro fertilisation doesn?t guarantee pregnancy.

 ?The taboo on IVF has been replaced by a rush for it and it isn?t very healthy. We are struggling to cope with the demand. We need trained embryologists for the job and there aren?t too many,? says Dr Baidyanath Chakravarty of the Institute of Reproductive Medicine. 

 ?But what is disconcerting is that educated men and women are not realising how age would affect their chance of conceiving. If the couples had not deferred their decision to have a child, they could have avoided the problem,? Chakravarty added.

 Experts advise that couples should not postpone their decision of having a child beyond mid-30s.

 With age, the spermatozoa and the egg undergo chromosomal changes owing to loss of telomere (that hangs like a tail on the upper and lower part of a chromosome). 

 This affects fertility. Besides, the ova (eggs) produced by an older woman are not always of good quality and the endometrium (inner wall) of the ovary at times becomes thick, posing problems. 

 Prolonged exposure to stress makes matters worse, bringing down the normal rate of hormone secretion.

 ?Often, the urgency to meet office deadlines and expectations puts excessive pressure on working couples. As a result, normal urges seem to take a back seat. Many couples under treatment skipped the clinic in March because of year-end deadlines,? says Sudarsan Ghosh Dastidar, a fertility expert. 

 ?Performance anxiety? at the workplace leaves couples tired and in no state to indulge in sexual relations during the few hours they get to spend with each other. 

 ?We come across around four to five couples every month who are in the double-income group and too stressed out to lead a normal conjugal life. We try to counsel them to make them aware how they might have to pay dearly for their decisions about having a child,? says Dr Rohit Ghutgutia, who works with a fertility clinic.

 Malnutrition the GeNext malady

 - Wrong dietary habits cause deficiency of essential micronutrients

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Fatigue, low attention span or chronic diarrhoea in an otherwise healthy child, between six and 12 years of age, can be the fallout of micronutrient deficiency.

 Wrong dietary habits, resulting in inadequate intake of micronutrients, have given rise to a new type of malnutrition among children ? they tend to become overweight, crammed with calories, but lacking in essential minerals.

 Doctors estimate that more than 30 per cent of Calcutta?s schoolchildren suffer from micronutrient deficiency.

 Even a few years ago, the most visible sign of malnutrition, mostly among children from underprivileged families, was low body weight. ?Now, obesity is the symptom of the ailment,? said city-based pediatrician Debashish Biswas.

 ?Eating habits among children have undergone drastic changes in the past few years. They are now dependent on processed, preserved and dry food. As the items are rich in calories, the children tend to become obese but have their overall growth retarded,? said Apurba Ghosh, director, Institute of Child Health, Calcutta.

 The most common symptoms of malnutrition caused by micronutrient deficiency are mild but continuing diarrhoea, recurrent infection, lethargy, decreasing immunity, growth failure, anaemia, weak bones, and low attention span and alertness. ?It can even cause thyroid problems later,? Ghosh warned.

 Micronutrients are like catalysts, helping the body in proper utilisation of food and calories. Zinc, selenium, molybdenum, copper and iodine are the five micronutrients, which, along with eight vitamins, are crucial for the health, mental function and growth of a child. The eight vitamins are A, B1, niacin, riboflavin, B12, C, D and pyridoxine.

 Pediatrician Tridib Banerjee suggests that fresh fruits, vegetables and pulses ? which contain all the required vitamins and micronutrients ? should be staple diet of a child. According to some doctors, micronutrient-fortified health beverages can be an effective substitute.

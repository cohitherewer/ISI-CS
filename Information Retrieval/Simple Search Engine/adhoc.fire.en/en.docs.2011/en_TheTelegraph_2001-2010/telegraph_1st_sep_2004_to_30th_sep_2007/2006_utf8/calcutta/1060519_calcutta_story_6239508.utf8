 Interlacing the moods of the seasons with the moods of love, Rangeeniyan explores the various shades and experiences of shringar. Evoking a fluid journey through the sensuous, romantic poetry of Indian musical genres and the lyrical beauty of Kathak, a lover?s emotions are reflected in the restless thirst of summer, the eager hope of monsoon, the melancholy parting of autumn, the despondent bitterness of winter and the ecstatic bliss of spring. Conceived, choreographed and performed by Debashree Bhattacharya and Vikram Iyengar. Other participants include Aditi Bhattacharya and Sohini Debnath.

 Event: Rangeeniyan, a Kathak presentation by Ranan 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Purbashree auditorium, EZCC, Salt Lake

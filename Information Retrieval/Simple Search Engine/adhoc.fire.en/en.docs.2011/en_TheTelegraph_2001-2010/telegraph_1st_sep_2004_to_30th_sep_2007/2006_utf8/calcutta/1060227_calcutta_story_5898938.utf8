 The avian flu fright has prodded the state government to take a call on recasting the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Belgachhia, on the lines of the facility in Bhopal. 

 The animal resources development department has earmarked a building on the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biological campus in Belgachhia for the purpose. 

 The building, constructed around 18 months ago, is lying unused. The laboratory will be shifted there from its present address on the same campus. 

 The laboratory will be modernised to P-II and P-III levels to handle tests for bacteria and viral infection in animals, respectively. It will subsequently be equipped to handle complex strains of viruses, including the avian flu virus. The High Security Disease Laboratory in Bhopal already has the capability to deal with such cases. 

 The Belgachhia unit tests samples from 11 states, including the Northeastern states and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Once it shifts to the new building, the extra space will be utilised for the production of 17 types of vaccines. 

 Work is scheduled to begin in March. The animal resources development department will appoint a Hyderabad-based company as consultant. It is experienced in setting up laboratories in accordance with World Health Organisation stipulations. 

 On Friday, the company submitted its blueprint for the project. The cost of upgrading the laboratory to P-II and P-III levels will amount to over Rs 2 crore.?We want the laboratory to be on a par with the most sophisticated set-ups in the world,? said Subesh Das, secretary of the animal resources development department. 

 ?The Hyderabad-based company will be the principal consultant of the project. The execution will be carried out by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the animal resources development department,? he added.

 The current sultry spell is taking its toll on fish prices. The Met office being unable to say for sure when the rains will finally arrive to drive down the mercury, fish vendors are stocking less to save on ice.

 The drop in supply has caused the price of rohu to go up by Rs 20 a kg. Katla is even dearer, with portions being sold at Rs 140-150 a kg at Gariahat market and Jagubabur Bazaar. The scene is the same at Baithakkhana, Maniktala and Lake Market.

 According to the state fisheries department, around 300 metric tonnes of sweet-water fish like rohu and katla come daily to wholesale fish markets in Howrah, Sealdah and Patipukur from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. 

 Because of less orders being placed by fish merchants, the supply has dropped to 150-170 metric tonnes.

 Sukhendu Chakraborty, joint director in the fisheries department, said supply from local sources dries up in May-June. Hence, any curtailment in the supply from other states during this period is felt strongly in the market.

 Fish being perishable, suppliers, too, are wary of transporting the usual amount in this season. If the trucks get stranded midway, the loss will be enormous.

 ?In Howrah, we used to receive 30 to 40 trucks of fish daily from other states. But this has gone down to 22-25 trucks,? said Sheikh Alam, a trader in the Howrah wholesale fish market. 

 ?The trend will continue till the monsoon sets in and the temperature goes down a bit,? he added.

 ?More fish means more expenses on ice and the hotter the day, more is the requirement of ice,? pointed out another trader.

 Apurba Sarkar, president of the fish merchants? association in Patipukur, admitted that less stocks were being picked up only to reduce expenses on ice.

 According to Abhisek Das, a wholesaler in Patipukur, fish from other states come in crates. A truck carries 500 crates, each containing 40 kg of fish. To keep the fish fresh for 24 hours, a wholesaler spends Rs 140 for 25 kg of ice for each crate.

 Because of the rise in temperature, a fish merchant has to spend double the amount on each crate. ?But even after that, there is no guarantee that the fish will remain fresh for full 24 hours,? Das added.

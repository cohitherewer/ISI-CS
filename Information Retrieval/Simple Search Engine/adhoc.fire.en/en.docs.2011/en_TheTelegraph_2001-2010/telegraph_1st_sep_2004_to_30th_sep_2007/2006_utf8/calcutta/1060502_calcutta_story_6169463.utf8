 Killer son shunned doctor?s advice

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ananda Mazumdar probably would not have ended up killing his mother, Nandini, in a fit of rage if only he had continued to take the drugs that were prescribed. 

 The 42-year-old tended to refuse any form of medical intervention since his mother had first taken him to a psychiatrist in Gariahat, who found he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

 ?As far as I can recall, a few years ago, the mother came with her son and I found him a very difficult patient to deal with. One day, I spent long hours with him and realised he was of a very suspicious nature,? recounted psychiatrist Satyajit Ash. 

 ?Ananda trusted nobody. Besides, I recall, he didn?t have any friends. I had prescribed medicines but as far as I can make out, he had possibly stopped taking the drugs on a regular basis. In fact, the mother, too, had failed to realise the extent of her son?s illness,? added Ash.

 ?It is an extremely unfortunate case. Had the patient continued to take his drugs, he wouldn?t possibly have suffered from this bout of secondary depression that finally prompted him to do all that he did,? the doctor signed off.

 It was probably from this sense of loneliness that Ananda had taken to pouring out his pent-up feelings into a diary that the police have found in his bedroom among his books. Flipping through its pages, police have learnt that Ananda not only resented the maids and the ?outsiders? but also some family members, particularly those from his mother?s side, for their ?impression? about him. 

 This apart, Ananda jotted down his observations about all the books he would buy and read. The writings, if anything, suggest that Ananda was not only well-read but also an extremely emotional person.

 ?Ananda noted down his reactions to those with whom he was not comfortable, including a few family members. Possibly, he could not put up with the snide remarks of relatives from his mother?s side,? said a senior officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.

 Police on Monday got in touch with a Pune-based brother of Nandini?s who has agreed to come down to the city for the last rites of both mother and son.

 Doctors resume work

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Following a meeting with the minister of health, junior doctors of SSKM Hospital and Medical College and Hospital on Friday partially called off their ceasework.

 The doctors had started a 48-hour ceasework on Thursday for a 100 per cent hike in monthly stipend.

 ?We will join emergency services from tomorrow and take part in emergency surgeries,? a spokesperson of Medical College Junior Doctors? Forum said on Friday. 

 The ceasework at other departments will continue. The number of surgeries dropped by 20 per cent in the hospitals due to the ceasework.

 At the meeting, minister of state Pratyush Mukherjee promised the junior doctors a 30 per cent increase in the stipend. He also assured the doctors that health minister Surjya Kanta Misra is going to meet them on Monday.

 ?If our meeting with the health minister is not satisfactory, we will start a full-fledged strike,? the forum spokesperson asserted.

 House staff, postgraduate students and post-doctoral trainees of the medical colleges have been claiming that their monthly stipend is much less than that of their counterparts in other states. 

 The junior doctors get a monthly stipend of Rs 6,340, Rs 6,830 and Rs 7,320 in the first, second and third years, respectively. They have to pay tuition fees of Rs 1,000 a month. In comparison, junior doctors at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, receive a monthly stipend of Rs 22,000, Rs 23,000 and Rs 24,000 in the first, second and third years, respectively.

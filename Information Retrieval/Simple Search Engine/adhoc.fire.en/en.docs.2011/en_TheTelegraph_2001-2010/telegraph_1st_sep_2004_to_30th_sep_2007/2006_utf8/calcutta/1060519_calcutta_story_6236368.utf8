The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 B.Com for women at Xavier?s

 BISWARUP GOOPTU 

 There is a breach in the final male bastion on campus, but it hasn?t crumbled yet.

 The commerce department of St Xavier?s College will be opening its doors to girls from this academic session, by starting a co-educational evening course.

 The ?momentous decision? taken two months back breaks away from a tradition more than 60 years old, and comes into effect from July 1 ? the day the college officially declares its autonomous status.

 ?Admitting girls into the commerce section had been on our minds for quite some time. St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, is one of the premier commerce colleges in the country and we have decided to reach out to a larger number of students and give equal opportunity to women,? principal Father P.C. Mathew told Metro.

 The new course will be financed by the college. ?We will not get any financial help from the state government for the evening course. So, the tuition fees will be higher,? explained Father Mathew.

 The classes for the evening batch will be conducted on the Park Street campus and will start off with about 200 students. The college aims to ramp up the student count to about 600 within three years.

 ?The admissions criteria will be the same for both the morning and evening batches. A student can apply for both batches. We have sent a letter to Calcutta University. I don?t think there will be any sort of opposition in this regard,? said Father Mathew.

 The college will also open a five-year integrated course in biotechnology and a two-year postgraduate course in astrophysics. 

 ?A number of plans on other new courses are on the anvil,? signed off the principal.

 City stop on sandalwood smuggle route

 KINSUK BASU

 Some of the biggest sandalwood smugglers of south India are looking East and Calcutta figures prominently in their plans. 

 According to police, consignments of red sandalwood are being brought to the city in trucks carrying fish, fruits and vegetables from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The sandalwood is subsequently smuggled abroad in ships. 

 The sandalwood logs, hidden under layers of food items, make their way to the wholesale markets in Calcutta, said officers of the revenue intelligence department, who have been tracing the smuggling route. The trucks employed for the purpose have permits to carry perishables between states.

 ?Once the wood reaches the city, the smugglers activate their counterparts here. The logs are shifted from the wholesale markets to the port in small trucks and packed into huge iron containers,? said a senior officer of the department.

 ?The consignments are generally sent to Singapore, where there is a flourishing market for red sandalwood,? added the officer. 

 Investigation by the department has revealed that the smugglers use the exporters? codes to ensure that the sandalwood shipments easily obtain customs clearance.

 ?The way the labels are pasted on the containers, with details of the type of item being exported, the make of the item and the export code, makes it difficult for the customs personnel to figure out whether there is sandalwood inside or not,? stated the revenue intelligence officer. ?What is intriguing is how the smugglers are getting hold of the export codes.? The smugglers are apparently using the road route, too, to get consignments to Nepal and China. 

 In May this year, the department had seized near Naxalbari a shipment of red sandalwood on its way to Nepal.

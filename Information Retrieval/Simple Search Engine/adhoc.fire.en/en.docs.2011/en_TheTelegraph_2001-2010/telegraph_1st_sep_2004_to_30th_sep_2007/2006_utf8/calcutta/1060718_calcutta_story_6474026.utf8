 Interiors of TAK, the new home decor store 

on Short Street. Pictures by Rashbehari Das 

 Good things come in small packages. A look around TAK, a home decor store at 9 B amp;C Short Street, and thats what hits you first. Spread over a modest 500 sq ft, the store that raised its shutters last Friday, is home to a plethora of exclusive home furnishing products.

 Set in the lane behind St Xaviers College, TAK is a joint venture between Hemant Kanakia and Harmit Arora. I have been associated with interior designers for quite some time now. This is an effort to move out of catalogues and give my customers the actual feel of the products, smiles Hemant.

 The USP of TAK lies in its exclusivity. The products are in sync with global lifestyle, something that the city with its changing lifestyle pattern will relate to, adds Hemant.

 ans are already on to set up a second outlet in Rajarhat.

 The mood

 Once in the lane, there is no way you can miss TAK, done up in bright green with generous touches of Prussian blue. For the interiors theres caramel wooden flooring and bright walls. 

 A plush sofa in electric red is set on a platform in coffee brown. The ceiling has panels carved out, with tiny bulbs emitting a warm glow. The effect, on the whole, is quite stunning. 

 Be it the wallpaper or the wooden laminate, each decor item is placed against a backdrop that accentuates the look to the fullest. For instance, candles are set against a lime setting and paintings against a dark beige backdrop.

 Decor do

 For candles, it is The Faraway Tree, by Dimple Kapadia. While some are placed on glass racks, others are in a cabinet-like glass set-up. A few are placed on the large windowsill in Prussian blue with coloured pebbles thrown in.

 Big or small, square or cylindrical, aromatic or plain, pick what suits your home or office interiors the best. The colour code is mostly white-and-maroon.

 Beads, glitter, sequins and crystal embellishments look pretty. Some with golden fences all over are striking. Cinnamon-scented candles are top sellers. The price tag reads anything between Rs 100 and Rs 15,000.

 Art call

 We will keep contemporary and abstract works by upcoming artists, says Hemant. Currently, one finds art work by Laltu Kanakia. 

 It is not art for arts sake but pieces that will make great home decor pieces. Nature and femininity have been constant sources of inspiration, smiles Laltu.

 While Energy comes in a riot of hues, Wind Blown Moth is in white and black with streaks of red, and Durga Revisited is all about subdued shades.

 Polished wooden or metallic ones with a rustic charm, the frames are artistic. Prices start from Rs 1,500.

 Light lustre

 For a regal makeover, go in for Swarovski lighting. Classy, chunky, delicate and dazzling, they are sure to capture the attention of all. The Britannica is sleek with a luxuriously lit chamber. Celeste is traditional, creating the ambience of a durbar. Honeycomb with a Victorian feel is precise in construction and meticulously crafted. Some are peppered with coloured crystals.

 so available are preserved trees and artificial planters. An LCD screen and catalogues give you a wide variety to choose from.

 For flooring options, you can choose from laminated or wooden varieties.

 Wall wonder

 Woven effect, leafy textures, stripes, waves, and checks, the Italian and French wallpapers sure are innovative. Prices start at Rs 90 per sq ft. The variety in wall textures will spoil you for choice. Pick from among 40-plus texture types and colours. While Stucco gives your wall a marble finish, the Mother of Pearl with tinges of gold look cool. Prices start at Rs 35 per sq ft.

 Naya Theatre and Rangakarmee members stage Visarjan

 It was the most sought-after ticket in current Calcutta theatre. Never of late has one seen such a press of people desperate to get into the premiere of Visarjan, a collaboration between Habib Tanvir?s Naya Theatre and Usha Ganguli?s Rangakarmee, at Madhusudan Mancha.

 The sight of theatregoers and workers alike scouring strange faces for a possible extra ticket and pouncing on the rare one if offered, recalled scenes outside the Academy of Fine Arts three decades ago. Evidently the spectators (including this viewer) came anticipating much.

 Simply put, the results belied the buzz, culminating in lukewarm applause from the discerning Calcutta audience.

 ?Habib sahib had phoned me last year that he wanted to direct Visarjan,? recounts Ganguli, ?And I readily agreed. Rangakarmee took on this project to celebrate its 30th anniversary this month. I translated the play anew as published Hindi translations were poor.?

 This was an ambitious undertaking to begin with, since Tagore composed a full-length verse drama. By rendering it into prose, albeit smooth and idiomatic spoken Hindustani, Ganguli did away with the text?s appealing poetic quality. Thus stripped into less than two hours, this version exposed the plot, which is not its strongest feature.

 Let?s face it, Visarjan is not one of Tagore?s best plays, though its anti-fundamentalist message has become even more relevant. The problem lies in its derivative dramaturgy, for in his twenties Tagore, attacking idol worship, was still idolising the style and form of Shakespeare. Yet to discover his original theatrical voice, he converted his far superior novel Rajarshi into a five-act tragedy with multiple subplots. But neither the abrupt melodramatic death at the end nor the superfluous stapled-together subplots convince, once shorn of the poetry.

 Realising his own mistakes later on, Tagore radically revised Visarjan twice, going to the other extreme by reducing it to a one-act English translation and a simpler Bengali edition for children.

 Ganguli should have taken her cue from here, completely disassembling the script and dramatising it like she did impressively with such texts as Rudali. 

 So, both Ganguli and Tanvir treated Visarjan with too much respect. Meanwhile, in performance, the respective acting techniques of their groups clashed.

 Tanvir is famous for his Indianised variation on the Brechtian epic-theatre approach: openly presentational, with objective, detached acting. Ganguli is known for psychologically realistic theatre, often highly involved with emotions and turbo-charged action.

 In Visarjan, the performers followed one or the other style, leaving us confounded. In a parade of reversals, for example, Naya Theatre?s Ram Chandra Singh (as Raghupati) strutted and fretted passionately, whereas Rangakarmee?s Raja Ram Yagnik (Raja Gobinda Manikya), normally a fine naturalistic actor, mouthed his speeches coldly.

 A blatantly wrong choice, Nageen Tanvir played Aparna as almost mentally challenged, while Partha Sarathi Sarkar showed no motivation for Jaysinha?s sudden suicide. I thought the live goat did the best job: sensing that it was not to be sacrificed, it disdainfully surveyed the scene.

 Technically, too, the production was below par. The black backdrop went up and down without reason; the only set piece, of the temple, looked puny and its image of Kali threatened to teeter off midway, dissatisfied with the proceedings; light cues regularly misfired, with the backlighting for Kali a major disaster.

 Only Zarin Chaudhuri?s authentic Tripura costumes stood out as unusual.

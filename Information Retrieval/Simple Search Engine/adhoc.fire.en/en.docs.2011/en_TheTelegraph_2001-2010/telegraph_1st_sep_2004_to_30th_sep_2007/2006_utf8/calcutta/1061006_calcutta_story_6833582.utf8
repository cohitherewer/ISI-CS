 Traffic in turmoil, 37 hurt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The trouble-free traffic during Puja has given way to the familiar chaos on the roads even before the immersions could be completed. On Thursday, 37 people were injured in two mishaps in the city.

 Around 2.15 am, 30 people were injured when a truck carrying them overturned at the intersection of Aurobindo Sarani and APC Road after colliding with another truck. The injured, members of a puja committee, were on their way home after immersion. They were thrown off the vehicle. Bystanders and police rescued them and took them to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.

 The cops chased the other truck down APC Road for 15 minutes, before intercepting it on Beleghata Main Road, near Palmer Bazar.

 According to traffic department officials, the accident was a result of reckless driving. Since it was well after midnight, the traffic personnel had been withdrawn. Had the drivers been careful, the accident could have been averted, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim. 

 In the other mishap, seven people were injured when the driver of a private bus lost control on Topsia Road and hit five cars. The brakes of the bus were functioning and it stopped after hitting the vehicles, said an officer of Topsia police station. We rushed the injured to National Medical College and Hospital. The driver fled, leaving behind the bus.

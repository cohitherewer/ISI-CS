 The menu: For starters there were Dahi Ke Kebab, Awadhi Machhli, Kakori Kebab and the chefs speciality, Galauti Kebab. The main course comprised Gosht Reshmi Chaap, Paneer Aur Hari Mirch Ka Do Pyaaza and Dal Takshila. Atish-e-Naar and Dum-e-Biranje were served as rice dishes and rotis like Makhni Taftan and Kurkure completed the spread. Jaan-e-Azam made for the perfect sweet ending. 

 We serve more than 50 kebabs and 35 gravy dishes, said the chef. 

 Voiceover: We are catering to people on the move and with a penchant for this kind of cuisine, says Subrata Ghose Chaudhuri. Our market survey reveals that this cuisine is the most preferred at the moment.

 Go Gujarat

 What: Exhibition-cum-sale and a live demonstration of artisans from Gujarat, organised by the Garvi Gurjari emporium at Dakshinapan and sponsored by the Development Commissioner (Handicraft).

 Where: Sen Bati, 3 Mandeville Gardens.

 When: Till January 17.

 The exhibition: It is home to a variety of decor items. Cloth hangings with mirror work, interesting star-shaped and fish-shaped wall hangings with bells catch your eye. The brass items include simple candle-holders, fish studded with stones, tortoise, pretty meenakari jewellery holders and broad forks with beautifully carved ends.

 There is also a wide variety of cushion covers with zari work, applique work and stone embellishments. Those in earthy shades stand out because of their rich appeal. Then there are furniture pieces from Gujarat and mats that you can use on the table or at the door.

 The clothes are an assortment of saris in sober shades, kurtis, tops and shawls. Salwar suits with kalamkari and applique-worked lowers are worth a mention. An array of mirror-work bags could be a suitable choice for trendy teens.

 Pocket Pinch: Rs 20 to Rs 16,000.

 Voiceover: I am glad we are here and are expecting to do well. Exhibitions like these are a great way to promote our works and talent, says Nayna Gupte.

 Silk rustle

 What: A silk exhibition by Sujata Sarawgi.

 Where: Finesse at 11/1B, New Road, Alipore.

 When: January 6 to 12, 11 am to 7:30 pm.

 The exhibition: Silks, especially tussar from Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra will be on display. Available in neutral shades of gold ? honey, tawny, beige and creams ? these also come in natural dyed versions of red. Some chemical colours are also used to adapt to the changing pattern and design. The highlight of the show is the Tussar Gicha handwoven sari in vibrant hues and interesting forms.

 Voiceover: A seamless length of cloth ranging from five yards to 11 yards, the charm of the sari lies in the mysterious drape and folds with which it winds around the feminine form in myriad entrancing shapes and styles, says Sujata.

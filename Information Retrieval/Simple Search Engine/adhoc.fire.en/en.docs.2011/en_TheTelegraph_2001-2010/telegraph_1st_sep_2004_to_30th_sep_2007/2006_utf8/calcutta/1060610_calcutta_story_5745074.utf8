 Beyond the cricket craze, and now football frenzy, there are a few youngsters making a mark in sporting arenas less popular. 

 Fayiqa Halim is a rising equestrian champion. The Class VIII student of Loreto House has been riding for the past four years. She picked up the hobby in 2002, taking classes at Tollygunge Club. 

 The youngster has since been training with her coach Col P.P. Singh. In four years, she has won 19 medals in city, state and national competitions, in the jumping and tressage categories.

 ?I remember the first time I participated in a jumping competition. I was so terrified that I did it wrong and was disqualified. But I learnt a lot from that experience,? recalls the 13-year-old. ?I?ve fallen off the horse plenty of times. But if you?re afraid of it, then you?ll never get back on again.?

 The girl from Kyd Street practises at least three-four times a week, at Fort William, while her horse Muni, a seven-year-old mixed breed, is currently training with the colonel in Hyderabad. 

 ?It?s difficult managing with my studies. Last year, I concentrated more on riding, so my academics suffered a little. From this year, I have to focus on my education. But I love riding, so I?m not going to give it up,? adds Fayiqa.

 For 18-year-old Ami Parekh, there are no doubts about where her loyalties lie. 

 Born in New Jersey, USA, the ice-skating champ has parked herself in Calcutta with her brother and mother to concentrate on a career in the sport. 

 ?My brother Amar and I started skating about nine years ago. My mother had to sell the house to support us and we moved around a lot, training and participating in championships,? says the girl, who now calls a house on SN Banerjee Road her home.

 It was in the last winter Olympics that Ami noticed there was only one entrant from India. So, she made it her mission to make India proud with her skills. 

 After living here for a year, she now has Indian citizenship and is training for the Asian Games in 2007 and the next Olympics.

 ?Calcutta has a good rink, so we decided to settle here. Now I really like the city, especially the people. I?m doing school through distance learning in the US. I go back there for training every few months. Mostly though, my brother and I coach each other. Ice skating is an expensive sport and we?ve run out of funds. I need sponsorships,? says Ami.

 As far as the president of the Ice Skating Association of India and joint secretary of the Indian Olympic Association R.K. Gupta is concerned, she?s the country?s next Olympic hopeful. 

 ?She?s very good, and I?m sure Ami will make it,? he adds.

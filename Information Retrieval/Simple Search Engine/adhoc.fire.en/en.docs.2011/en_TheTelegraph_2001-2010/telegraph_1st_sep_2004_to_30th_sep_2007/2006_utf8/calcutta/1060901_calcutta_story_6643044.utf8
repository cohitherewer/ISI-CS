 Nuclear war on cancer

 - Two super-speciality medical facilities set to open doors

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Two super-speciality nuclear medicine facilities are set to open doors in Calcutta. They will introduce high-dose radio isotope therapy and PET-CT Scanner, the advanced gadget for early detection of cancer and other critical diseases.

 While Eko X-Ray and Imaging Institute is behind a 100-bed hospital, with the first indoor radio isotope therapy unit in the region, on three acres in New Town, the third phase of Apollo Gleneagles, on the existing Bypass campus, will house the other hub of nuclear medicine.

 The Eko hospital will offer treatment for thyroid cancer, neuro-endocrine tumour, metastatic cancer, joint disorder and other ailments. The blueprint for the project is ready and work will start in two months, said S.K. Sharma, director of Eko.

 The hospital is likely to be ready by next year. Of the Rs 100-crore project cost, Rs 30 crore will be spent on the PET-CT Scanner.

 The centre will house a medical cyclotrone isotope production unit. Since the lifespan of an isotope medicine is only two hours, it cannot be brought from outside, explained Soumendranath Ray, nuclear medicine specialist with Eko. 

 We have sought approval from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, Eko officials said. When contacted in Mumbai, board officials said as per the procedure for verifying an isotope therapy unit, a team would come to Calcutta soon to check if all guidelines were being followed.

 Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, too, is setting up a radio isotope therapy ward. Machinery, the radio isotope processing unit and other infrastructure are ready. We are waiting for the new building to be completed, said Debashish Chowdhury, head of the hospitals nuclear medicine department.

 According to specialists, radio isotope therapy is useful in treating cancer and other disorders that do not respond well to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It is a very important tool for treatment of some types of cancer, especially thyroid and metastatic, explained Subir Ganguly, head, department of oncology, NRS Medical College and Hospital. 

 The radio isotope is administered orally or intravenously. It emits radioactive rays that selectively destroy cancer cells, he added.

 A PET-CT Scanner is used mainly in oncology, but also in cardiology, neuro-psychiatry tackling infections, and detecting Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. It detects a cancerous cell in the molecular stage, before tumour formation. It also helps predict where the cancer will spread, said Ray of Eko..

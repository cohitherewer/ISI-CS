 Bike thief ring bust

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 A multi-crore, cross-border racket behind the theft of more than 200 two-wheelers in the city and its suburbs over the past one-and-a-half months has been busted.

 Acting on tip-offs, a special team of Howrah police conducted raids over the past month in the district, as well as in Calcutta and North and South 24-Parganas, and arrested 15 people for their involvement in the racket. 

 According to an officer, the men who stole the motorcycles would sell them to a receiver, or fence, who in turn would sell them to an agent in Bangladesh.

 A middleman coordinated the transaction between the Indian and Bangladeshi receivers.

 A stolen motorcycle in mint condition can fetch between Rs 55,000 and Rs 60,000 in Bangladesh. The volume of illegal business ran into crores, stated the officer. 

 The ground operators, who did the actual stealing, he explained, visited the house of a target in the guise of a vendor or salesman. The motorcycle was stolen later. The two-wheelers were also picked up from busy parking lots. 

 We have rounded up a number of persons involved in the racket, but some of the big shots are still at large. The investigation will continue, said the officer.

 Lissome legs of longing

 GOODLIFE ASKS 

 A FEW MEN TO VOTE FOR THEIR FAVOURITE LEGGY LASS

 Rajneesh 

 Duggal, Model

 At one point of time, Naomi 

 Campbell had the nicest legs. She was one leggy beauty. 

 Whatever she wore, on the ramp and off it, looked amazing. 

 Uma Thurman and Elizabeth Hurley also have great legs. Uma 

 was mind-blowing in Kill Bill and Liz in Bedazzled 

 was simply wow! In Bollywood, Katrina Kaif has super-sexy 

 legs and the whole country caught a glimpse of them in the 

 infamous dargah episode! Bipasha Basu has nice legs, 

 too.

 Kailash 

 Kher, singer

 One girl whose body has 

 blown me is supermodel Gisele Bundchen. This Brazilian 

 bombshell has every single thing going for her. I saw one 

 of her interviews recently and, believe me, shes one 

 crazy woman but in a nice way, of course! I wonder what 

 she does to maintain that gorgeous figure of hers does 

 she work at it at all or is it entirely god-sent... Whatever 

 the secret is, she has the best legs in the world.

 Shantanu 

 Goenka, designer

 Marilyn Monroe. When 

 you say legs, you think of her. The image from The Seven-Year 

 Itch when her white dress flies up in the air, flashing 

 a pair of beautiful legs, is engraved in my mind. Marilyn 

 had the whole package going for her the beauty spot, blonde 

 locks, red lips but the one thing that stood out: her 

 legs. That particular image became so popular that it set 

 a benchmark of sorts. Hollywood has copied it several times 

 and Pooja Bedi tried it, too, in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander. 

 In fact, even Versace used that image as a print later on.

 Tota 

 Roy Chowdhury, actor 

 Shilpa Shetty has 

 the best legs in Bollywood. People might think she is curvy 

 and sexy, but she is more than that. She is an athlete and 

 it shows on screen. The best part about her legs is that 

 they are not gym-toned. They reflect lots of sprinting, 

 jumping, running, and kick-boxing. Its a pity she 

 doesnt flash them that often. Saris have made her 

 legs a rare sight... We last saw them in the song Baras 

 ja from Fareb, looking hot as ever in a white 

 tie-up shirt and denim hot pants!

 Mir, 

 RJ-actor

 Ever since I saw Urmila 

 Matondkar in Rangeela, no legs have looked better 

 in my eyes. Her toned body, her style and oomph, everything 

 added up perfectly. After Urmila, coming a close second 

 is the newest Bollywood babe Kangana Ranaut. She was great 

 in Gangster and it is high time this leggy beauty 

 got her assets insured!

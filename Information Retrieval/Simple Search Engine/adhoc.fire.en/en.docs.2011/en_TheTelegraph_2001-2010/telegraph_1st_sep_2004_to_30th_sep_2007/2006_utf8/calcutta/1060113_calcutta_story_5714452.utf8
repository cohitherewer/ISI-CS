The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Another protest wave, more road chaos

 Barely two days ago, the ladies of Calcutta ? members of the All-India Mahila Sanskritik Sangathan ? had done it. On Thursday, a protest rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue, organised by Intuc and 5,000-member strong, once again threw the city centre out of gear.

 Vehicles came to a standstill for over an hour on the main thoroughfares leading to rambunctious Esplanade as the protesters held a meeting on Rani Rashmoni Avenue to press their demands and to protest the government?s alleged failure to run the state administration smoothly.

 Both the northern and southern flanks of the stretch ? from the Jawaharlal Nehru Road-end to Plassey Gate Road ? were occupied by the demonstrators for over three hours from 1 pm, causing a bumper-to-bumper traffic snarl on adjoining roads.

 Unable to cope with the situation, police put up barricade gates at the intersection of Jawaharlal Nehru Road and Rani Rashmoni Avenue. ?As a result, all vehicles plying on SN Banerjee Road and heading towards Babughat had to be diverted towards Mayo Road through New Road. Traffic movement around Esplanade was disrupted when the processions started reaching their venue,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).

 Motorists had a difficult time when rallies from different directions started converging on Rani Rashmoni Avenue at 1 pm. ?Processions came from both Sealdah and Howrah railway stations. As the rallies marched through APC Road, SN Banerjee Road, Brabourne Road and Strand Road, traffic movement was seriously affected,? said a traffic department officer.

 Processions came from distant places like East and West Midnapore, South 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Nadia, North 24-Parganas and Howrah and as they hit the city streets, the situation in Esplanade went out of hand. 

 Chittaranjan Avenue, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Lenin Sarani and SN Banerjee Road resembled freeze shots as vehicles came to a standstill. Vehicles were stranded on the western flank of Jawaharlal Nehru Road and the middle of the Park Street flyover was choked with traffic.

 A section of Rani Rashmoni Avenue resembled a mela ground, with vendors hawking snacks like kachouris, samosas, sandesh, and bhel puri. As on Tuesday, rows of chairs for the demonstrators occupied a 100-metre stretch of the road.

 Anticipating a traffic snarl, elaborate arrangements had been made at and around the venue. Half-a-dozen traffic sergeants and eight police vehicles were positioned at strategic points, including Chowringhee, Lenin Sarani and in front of Metro Channel.

 ?But it was ineffectual. How can vehicles move if demonstrators walk on the road itself, blocking the entire thoroughfare? We had no option but to wait for the rallies to end,? admitted a helpless traffic department officer.

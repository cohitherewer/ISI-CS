 The tide might finally be turning for Ram Sagar Sahni, forcibly evicted from his Burrabazar shop and then denied justice by ?extortionists in uniform?.

 Following Monday?s report in Metro on the travails of Sahni at Burrabazar police station, deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Kumar said he would ?personally talk? to the aggrieved.

 Kumar also said he had ordered a probe into the allegation that policemen of Burrabazar thana had demanded a bribe ? Rs 15,000 to register a complaint; Rs 40,000 to take action and restore Sahni?s fruit-juice shop to him.

 ?He (Sahni) has lodged a complaint with my office and I have gone through it. But he has not met me. Besides, I have asked my officers posted at Burrabazar police station to find out whether Sahni had any problem with the owner of the shop from where he was allegedly evicted,? added Kumar.

 When contacted, Sahni said no one from the local police station had met him. ?I will meet the deputy commissioner with all documents and talk to him in detail,? he said.

 Sahni, in his complaint, mentioned how ?three men in uniform? had demanded a bribe from him to take up his case.

 ?I was forcibly evicted from the shop on Canning Street by a section of local goons? I met all the officers at Burrabazar police station, but none of them paid any heed to my plea,? he alleged.

 Meanwhile, a preliminary police inquiry is all but prepared to give the officers of Burrabazar thana a clean chit.

 ?The feud between the shop-owner and Sahni is a civil matter and we can proceed only after getting an instruction from court. But no policeman demanded any money from Sahni,? said A.K. Lahiri, officer-in-charge of Burrabazar police station.

 Another officer added: ?Police might have refused to register the complaint because it was a matter to be resolved in court. The charge of police demanding money to register a complaint is baseless.?

 Deputy commissioner Kumar, too, stood by his men, but promised a full probe. ?No policeman can do such a thing? but a thorough inquiry is on. We will talk to the people on Canning Street, on the spot where Sahni claims an officer demanded money from him. The inquiry will also look at various aspects, like the service records of the officers. If our findings go against them, it will invite departmental action against them,? clarified Kumar.

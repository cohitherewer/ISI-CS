 A search for true self

A five-day interactive workshop 

 on emotional intelligence for youngsters started at Crossword 

 on October 4. The sessions are being conducted by Ragini 

 Rao, a behavioural counsellor and certified transactional 

 analyst (psychotherapy).

 According to Rao, it is not enough 

 to shine in academics if you dont know how to check that 

 sudden bout of anger or know how best to deal with the people 

 around you. She maintains that unlike IQ (which is god-given), 

 EQ is something one can cultivate. Using various exercises 

 and lectures, the workshop will assist candidates aged from 

 15 to 21 years to control themselves and their environment 

 better (picture above by Sanat Kumar Sinha).

 Inculcating self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills make up the five-day event. Emotional Intelligence, the title of Daniel Goldmans book, is becoming increasingly relevant in a world where a lot of stress is laid on a persons material achievements and very little on what he or she really is. Its time to bring the focus back on the person, said Rao.

In January, Father Felix Raj, vice-principal of the St Xaviers Colleges department of commerce, suggested to the first-year students to support rural children through the College to Village and Village to College Prayas programme. Under the project, each student contributed Re 1 every day and the collection every month was sent to students of Gurap and Pandua villages. Class representatives coordinated the effort.

 As part of the programme, the students of St Xaviers College sponsored 50 children of each of the villages. Father Raj insisted that the project should not limit itself to extending financial assistance, but become a learning experience for the college students. Whatever you give must come from within. It must be a sacrifice. Sacrifice one cup of tea, one singhara or even one cigarette a day to raise this money, he had said.

 Two groups of college students visited the villages in May. Then, the village children were brought down and shown around the college campus and the city. The college students have vowed to continue their assistance to these needy children. All Xaverians are requested to contribute. Contact vpbcomsxccal.edu for details.

Rhapsody, the Medical College and Hospital fest, was held from September 14 to 21, in association with The Telegraph. It saw students from various colleges, including Institute of Engineering and Management, South City College and Ashutosh College, participate.

 The most popular event was the Battle of Bands, judged by members of Bangla band Cactus. The winner was a band called 47 from Burdwan which played original numbers Nirman and Dwitiya Purush. Drummer Arindam Ghoshal said: Our band is just a month-and-a-half-old. It is unbelievable how we synchronised so well in such a short time. The scene for rock music lovers is not very good in Burdwan. We are glad to win here.

 The quiz drew 39 teams, with NRS Medical College bagging the first prize. In the debate on Is India a soft state? Presidency College student Sakshi Arora, who spoke for the motion, was declared winner. 

 Cactus entertained the crowd on Day One, while Fossils took the stage on the third day of the fest, belting out numbers like Acid and Bishakto Manush.

 Himani Fast Relief Choreography was a hit with the crowd, with the students appreciating a creditable imitation of actor Hrithik Roshans steps to the song Dil Na Diya. The winner was all-girl group Infinity from IEM.

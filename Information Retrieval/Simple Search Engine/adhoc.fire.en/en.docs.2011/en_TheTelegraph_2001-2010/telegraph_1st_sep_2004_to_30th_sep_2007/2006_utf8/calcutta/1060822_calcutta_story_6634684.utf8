What: Tolly Monsoon Bash presented by The 

Telegraph, in association with Spandan and Reliance Mobile.

Where: Tollygunge Club.

When: Saturday night.

What a blast: A light drizzle accompanied by 

artificial sprinklers created a wet and wild mood on the Tolly lawns. 

The young and the not-so-young grooved to tracks churned 

out by DJ Akash and guest DJ Jimmy Tangree.

The crowd rocked to Bollywood numbers sung by Preety 

Bhalla. 

On stage, the dance group Challengers performed to 

a music medley with Kajra re, Ishq tera, Rang barse, Dholna and 

more.

The curtains came down with VJ Archana giving away 

Swatch watches as prizes to the best dancers and best dressed couple.

Sip 'n' bite: Indian and Chinese snacks accompanied 

the beverages served from two makeshift bars.

Voiceover: This is the sixth year of 

our traditional monsoon bash that features prominently on our entertainment calendar. 

And like always, it was a huge success, said Arunava Chakravarty, deputy 

managing member of the club.

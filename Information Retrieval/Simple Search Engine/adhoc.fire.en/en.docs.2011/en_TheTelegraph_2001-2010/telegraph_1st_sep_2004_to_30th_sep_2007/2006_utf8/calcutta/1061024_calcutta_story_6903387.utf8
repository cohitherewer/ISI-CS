 Fresh salvo at schools

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is planning to have its say in the recruitment of teachers by state-aided minority schools, though its earlier attempt in this regard through a bill passed in the Assembly had fallen through.

 School education minister Partha De has called a meeting on November 3 with church representatives to discuss the proposed changes to the governments policy on minority institutions, aimed at tackling alleged irregularities.

 A source close to the school education department said the government would like to examine the educational and other qualifications of candidates seeking jobs in minority schools and also ensure that one of its representatives attends the interviews.

 The department is studying the procedure followed by Christian missionary schools in recruiting teachers and principals, the source said.

 The government does not want to curb the rights of the minority schools guaranteed by the Constitution. It only wants to ensure that they abide by the prescribed policies. The government has received several complaints alleging violation of rules in recruitment of teachers and principals, he added.

 Church-run schools are now only required to take the education departments consent for appointing a teacher. For recruiting a head, its enough to just intimate the government.

 Reacting to the governments move, general secretary of Bangiya Christiya Pariseba Herod Mullick said: We would not oppose any attempt at punishing a school that has misused its minority rights. But the government should not generalise the issue and infringe on rights.

 The organisation has prepared a draft proposal that would be placed at the November 3 meeting.

 The government had earlier tabled a bill in the Assembly seeking to make it mandatory for all state-aided minority institutions to recruit teachers through the school service commission.

 But after the school service commission bill was passed in February, more than 700 state-aided Christian schools rallied against the government, forcing withdrawal of the legislation in June.

 Minister De and Left Front chairman Biman Bose had then assured the schools that they would be consulted if any changes in recruitment rules were considered.

 OOPS! Greet Jokas curious trio

 - B-school students shun summer placement process to forge own paths

 CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE

 When you say OOPS on the Indian Institute of Management (IIM)-Joka campus, it has nothing to do with failing your exams or being a male stripper (Deepak Tijoris flop film). OOPS (Out of Placement Season) is a B-school term for rare students who choose to shun the placement process.

 The summers, which came to an end on Sunday at IIM Calcutta with a record number of slot-zero placements, threw up three real surprises students who opted out. As far as I know, nobody in IIM Calcutta has OOPS-ed in summer placements before; this is really unique, said Prashanth Swaminathan, recruitment coordinator at Joka.

 So, where is the OOPS trio headed? The Muhammad Yunus effect seems to have rubbed off on one. Deepak Dhamija has decided to take up a project with Basics, an organisation in Vidarbha engaged in the micro-financing of farmers. I always wanted to work in Vidarbha, where farmer suicides touched a four-digit figure last year. I will be able to advise farmers on alternative sources of income and come up with solutions to improve the per-hectare yield of crops, said Deepak. More than 65 per cent of the Indian population still has agriculture as the main occupation, but less than one per cent of technologically-equipped Indians do something about agriculture, rued the biz school boy who wants to make a difference.

 Next in the OOPS line is IIT Bombay alumnus Ankur Gattani, who wants to start out on his own. The placement offers on campus do not provide the broad experience that I require to start my own company, says Ankur, with sights set on being an entrepreneur with all-round business skills.

 Pankaj Parakh has also OOPS-ed to follow his dream that of setting up a company with his friends following a stint with a US-based firm, from which he has bagged an offer by applying independently.

 Given the on-campus reaction to the trio that has turned its back on the rat race, its now cool to have OOPS-ed at Joka. What they have done is admirable. Not everyone can give up the temptation of a lucrative campus placement, summed up student Abhishek Saha.

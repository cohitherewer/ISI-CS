 It is an irony of history that Max Mueller Bhavan should have brought the very significant and exciting exhibition, Video Sculpture in Germany since 1963, to this country at a time when the electronic media have pervaded our society in a way that, perhaps, no other medium has ever done before. Video art had begun in Germany way back in the Sixties as a critique of the mass media.

 This exhibition, that opened at CIMA Gallery on Sunday evening, is equally important since, owing perhaps to limited access to expensive equipment, local artists, with a few notable exceptions, have rarely tried their hand at this medium. People here are still suspicious of advanced technology as a tool of artistic expression, and this show will be an eye-opener for most.

 Curated by video expert Wulf Herzogenrath, it is a large exhibition comprising 18 video sculptures representing 13 artists covering four generations and 47 works on paper. The logistics involved were mind-boggling. Rainer Eisch, a German artist of the younger generation, is here to set it up, and art historian Anja Osswald will introduce it.

 The exhibition begins at the beginning, with the works of the Korea-born Nam June Paik, who died recently and is called the father of video art. Three photographs document the birth of this art with Paik before TV terminals in 1963. His Buddha Looking at Old Candle TV takes an anti-technology stance in the same way that sensational dadaist experiments were anti-art. It is bound to draw attention.

 Klaus vom Bruch uses video for his ironic piece where a soldier wears a strainer like a helmet, Anna Anders? ?guards? make the most of this minimalist presentation, while Marcel Odenback makes a commentary on current situations through his unsettling images of the pigeons of Venice along with news footage that gives it a critical edge.

 Dieter Kiessling presents a closed-circuit video installation. Video takes a poetic turn in Ulrike Rosenbach?s Requiem for an Oak Tree. This art gains a feminist accent in Franziska Megret?s unsettling Arachne-Vanitas. The exhibition is on till April 21.

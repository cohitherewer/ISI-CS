The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Flagship of fun-learn chain

 - Upcoming Calcutta edition of school to have UK head

 SUDESHNA BANERJEE

 Portrait of the European as a school head. Andy Gray of the UK will possibly be the first non-missionary at the helm of affairs in post-colonial Calcutta.

 Gray, who heads the governing council of EuroSchool, will be shifting base to the city from Mumbai this November. His initial job will be recruitment for the national chains Calcutta edition, ABC EuroSchool, coming up in Rajarhat and set for an April launch.

 We are planning 20 schools across India in five years, but Calcutta will be our flagship. With the scurry of development, this is the place to be, smiled the Briton, who has headed three public schools in the UK and been the chairman of the National Association of Independent Schools.

 After having done all there was to do in the UK, he took over this assignment in 2000. Since then, EuroSchool has opened in Hyderabad, Patna, Tumkur off Bangalore... Theres nothing wrong with the syllabi here, but with the way its taught. He promises to continue with the fun-learn ambience of the companys 300-strong pre-school chain, branded EuroKids. Wealth creation in the 21st Century will happen from creative ideas, not what is called mugging in India, he smiles.

 Citing a National Council of Educational Research and Training proposal to infuse enjoyment in education, passed by the Parliament in April 2006, he says when a similar leap in education policy took place in the UK 15 years ago, it was accompanied by vast expenses in teacher training. The government here may not be able to afford that investment, but private schools can.

 Another watch-out area for him is the changed socio-familial backgrounds of students. Adolescent issues are a reality today, so schools have to modernise pastoral care ideas.

 And he will teach kids how to swim at school (Thats a life skill) but not allow it to be a five-star hotel.

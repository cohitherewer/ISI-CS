The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Rally clogs exam route

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 It was the first day of the ISC examinations. Abhishek Choudhury left his Bhowanipore home early for the test centre: Calcutta Boys? School, in Taltala. Thanks to the CPM?s student wing, he reached after the chemistry question paper had been distributed.

 Abhishek wasn?t alone. Hundreds of ISC candidates were delayed on their way to exam centres by a Students? Federation of India rally, protesting the US President?s visit to the Capital 1,500 km away. 

 ?These protestors have been holding blood donation camps with loudspeakers blaring in the run-up to the test. Now, they are detaining students on their way to the exam centres,? complained a harassed parent.

 The processions started from various points in the city, including Sealdah and Howrah, around 12.30 pm and converged on Shahid Minar, before proceeding to the American Center on JL Nehru Road. 

 As the number of protesters swelled in central Calcutta, traffic had to be barred on SN Banerjee Road, while cops could only clear RR Avenue after a lathicharge. The ISC examination started at 2 pm and all the centres distributed question papers 15 minutes in advance. Several examinees were still on their way then.

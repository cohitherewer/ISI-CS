Howard with Adrien Brody in The Village

This Republic Day, we can all get patriotic in a whole new way ? catching the latest from the best Indian director in Hollywood, Manoj Night Shyamalan. 

 You can watch the Joaquin Phoenix-Adrien Brody-starrer The Village, which also boasts of a brilliant debut by Ron Howard?s daughter Bryce Dallas Howard. Before you tune in to STAR Movies this Thursday at 9 pm, read on to find out more about the writer-director who can rightfully claim the crown of the Next Hitchcock.

The writing process: The screenwriting process 

is a little different each time. On The Village, which was the longest 

one and the hardest one because of the period nature of it, I just kept writing 

notes. And it just filled up pages and pages and pages and it started to become 

a procrastinating tool. The list was so big that when I decided to start writing, 

I had a problem putting it together. Then I wrote an outline and then I wrote 

the draft. 

The inspired idea: Sometimes people ask me, 

?What do you want your name to mean in the future?? And I say, ?Originality.? 

That?s what I want it to mean. If I saw a movie that was in the genre or in the 

vein of something that I liked, I?d probably get discouraged and not write it. 

I remember I had The Sixth Sense idea years before and I put it away because 

I heard they were making Casper. I was like, ?There goes that. They?re 

already making a ghost movie?? A lot of times it will be like the kernel of an 

idea, like The Village was. I had this King Kong idea ? you come 

across this group of people who are doing their chores and incorporated in their 

chores are these rituals to keep them safe from creatures. I had that, and then 

they offered me Wuthering Heights. And I read the book again and I was 

like, ?This is the greatest book ever! No to the movie, but I?m going to write 

my own period piece.? And so in a way, I guess I get inspired by books a lot. 

The casting call: It (The Village) was 

a big concern because it was a staggeringly good (ensemble). These are easily 

the best actors in the world in each of their roles. These are some of the best 

theatre actresses. These were formidable talents and I was seriously concerned 

about that. I?d have to make that call and go, ?You know, we really cut down your 

role.? It didn?t turn out that way, luckily enough. It?s so funny that I had an 

ensemble cast like that because I had said I?d never do an ensemble cast ever. 

My theory before that was ? one star, and then surround him by unknown faces, 

so it becomes real. Of course, I totally disregarded that. I did the reverse: 

an unknown face (Howard) surrounded by all these people you know.

The music monster: We had this violinist named 

Hilary Hahn to play. Hilary is 23, the same age as Bryce, and she?s considered 

one of the top three violinists in the world. And some consider her the best violinist 

in the world. We asked her to do the score. So, she came in to be the female voice 

? the strong female voice in the movie. She killed it! It was like she came in 

and it was a concert. She stood up there in front of the orchestra and this little 

girl ? she actually has reddish hair, too ? played. And everybody (was) just floored. 

And when we put that onto the movie, it was like another actor was in the movie 

suddenly. It would only work when everything, the symphony, was working together.

The final product: Scott Rudin, the producer, 

I hired him and this was about not being safe. I wanted Scott to come in and just 

challenge the hell out of me. He did The Hours, which I love, and so I 

called Scott up and I said, ?Hey, can you come on this?? And he did what he does. 

?Why is this here? What?s going on here?? I was like, ?Oh jeez.? And that was 

at the end when I thought the script was done. He really pushed me. It really 

needed to happen because I couldn?t do what I?d done on Signs, which was 

(to) write the sofa scene in two hours. And when you see the movie, you?ll see 

there?s a whole lot going on and he really strengthened these other layers. He 

just kept pushing me to the point I was like, ?It?s done. I am done, dude.?

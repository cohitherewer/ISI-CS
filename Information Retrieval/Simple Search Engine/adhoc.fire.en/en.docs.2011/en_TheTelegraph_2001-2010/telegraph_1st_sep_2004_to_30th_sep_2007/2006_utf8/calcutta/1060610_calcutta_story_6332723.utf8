The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Accused set free as tech law trips cops

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Ignorant of the provisions of the Information and Technology (IT) Act, 2000, police on Friday failed to keep the city?s first cyber crime accused, Surojit Pal, behind bars.

 After 37 days in custody, Surojit, a software engineer with a Salt Lake firm, was granted bail by Justice S.P. Talukdar of Calcutta High Court, primarily because police had failed to follow the provisions of the Act while probing the case. 

 According to the IT Act, the investigation should be conducted by a deputy commissioner or any officer of equivalent rank. But Mukul Dutta, an assistant commissioner in the cyber crime wing, was assigned to probe Pal?s case.

 Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of the detective department, said: ?This is the first case our cyber crime wing is handling. Officers might have overlooked the provisions of the new IT Act. We will take corrective action soon.?

 The detective department arrested Surojit, a master?s degree-degree holder in information and technology from Manipal University, on May 2 on charges of mailing obscene photographs to women workers of an NGO. 

 On receiving a complaint, police contacted the Internet service provider and tracked down Surojit.

 Sending obscene pictures through the Net is an offence under Section 37 of the IT Act. The person arrested under this section can be sentenced to jail for five to 10 years.

 S. Moitra, who appeared for Pal in court, argued: ?Surojit called the NGO workers to seek their help for his treatment. He had sent the photographs to explain his state of mind and sought their advice.? 

 He also pointed out that according to the provisions of the IT Act, a police officer below the rank of deputy commissioner cannot investigate any cyber crime case.

 Surojit was the first cyber crime accused in the city to be booked under the IT Act. A fortnight ago, the city police had arrested a woman in Jadavpur for soliciting clients through the Net. 

 The case is pending in the high court. The accused has also applied for bail.

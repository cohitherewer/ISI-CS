 Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has invited Indian entrepreneurs to invest in the infrastructure, tourism and agro-processing sectors in his country.

 We have liberalised both the current and capital accounts, so investments can be made both in the public and private sectors. The money can be withdrawn if the situation does not turn out to be favourable, Museveni said at an informal meeting of business leaders in the city on Wednesday, during a stopover visit on his way to China.

 He invited a delegation from India to visit Uganda in January to explore the possibility of forging commercial links between the two countries.

 His special focus was on hydro-electricity (Uganda has been facing a power crisis), housing and roads.

 Our partnership with India dates back to the days of Jawaharlal Nehru, who had supported the African liberation movement, the President recalled. The second partnership centered around the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement. And the third is in trade. A lot of Indian goods are very popular in Uganda.

 He also projected his country as an ideal tourist destination, outlining its climate, altitude and the wealth of flora and fauna. A number of Indians who have made Uganda their home have established cultural links between the two countries as well. 

 Among those present at the meeting were Rajive Kaul, (chairman, Nicco Corporation Limited), Nimisha Madhvani (deputy high commissioner, Uganda), Sunil Kanoria (director, Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited) and Ranvir Bhandari (general manager and area manager-east, ITC).

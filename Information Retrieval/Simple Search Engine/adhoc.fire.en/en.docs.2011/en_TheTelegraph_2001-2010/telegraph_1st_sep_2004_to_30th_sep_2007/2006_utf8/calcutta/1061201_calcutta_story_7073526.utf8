 Boy death sparks rampage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 250-strong mob went on the rampage at Calcutta Medical Research Institute, Alipore, on Thursday morning, after the death of three-year-old Nasim Khan, who was admitted on November 17 with malaria.

 Nasims relatives demanded the suspension of three doctors, who they claimed were responsible for the childs death.

 A hospital spokesperson said Nasim did not die of malaria. He had come to us with malaria, but later his brain got affected. We did everything possible to improve his condition and had even consulted a neurosurgeon, but could not save him.

 Officer-in-charge of the local police station Nandadulal Pal said the relatives and their associates even ransacked the intensive care unit on the fifth-floor of the hospital. 

 The mob first pelted stones at the windowpanes on the ground floor of the hospital. Then, a group went up to the fifth floor and broke flower pots in ICU corridor and smashed the windowpanes and a few accessories in the room, said Pal.

 The situation was brought under control after a police team led by Pal and an assistant commissioner of police, Shom Chowdhury reached the hospital following a request from the authorities. No one was arrested.

 Nasims father Hassan, a Watgunge resident, alleged that his son was a victim of the doctors negligence. His condition started deteriorating from November 27. The doctors did not allow us to meet him from the following day, Hassan alleged.

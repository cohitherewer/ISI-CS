The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Post-poll campus dump

 - Strong rooms or counting rooms, the litter lies everywhere

 The Rabindra Bharati University campus, 

which bore the brunt of the five-phase poll. Before the election, Metro had focussed 

on the litter dumped on the grounds; now, it lies in the classrooms. Pictures

 Bottles of marking ink, terracotta paperweights, sheaves of paper and heaps of plastic packets scattered on the floor and wooden benches dumped on a row of tables. Enter, room number 157 on the ground floor of the main building of Rabindra Bharati University?s BT Road campus, a classroom of the economics department, now a post-poll dump.

 Five days have passed since the results were declared, and 24 hours since the clean-up deadline ran out. ?Election Commission officials overseeing the process had fixed May 15 as the deadline by when the classrooms were to be handed over to us. They have just got the roller in today to repair the field and several rooms are yet to be cleaned. We are not sure when we?ll be able to get back our rooms,? complained a senior administrative officer on campus on Tuesday afternoon.

 The election effect on the campus, used as receiving, distribution and counting centre, is reflected in the filthy classrooms in the main building and the potholed grounds.

 ?Across three floors of this main building, around 40 rooms were taken up, with 14 meant just for counting. What you see today is just a fraction of the filth. The bulk has already been removed,? claimed Sital Roy, a state government employee overseeing cleaning operations at the university on behalf of the divisional electoral officer of Calcutta Northeast. ?We should be done by Wednesday,? he added.

 The poll-ravaged picture was no less pathetic at the Alipore campus of Calcutta University, shrouded by a maze of poll posters ? right from the main entrance. The political science department bore the brunt of the five-phase poll paraphernalia. Room number C/2-7 on the first floor had been converted into a strong room for the Alipore Assembly segment. Five days after Tapas Pal had left the campus victorious, salt packets, a flowerpot, sheets of plywood and a heap of green chillies lay strewn on the floor of the strong room, of C/2-8, C/2-5 and more. Only one room was clean and fit to be handed over ? the one meant for election observer Jabbar Dhakwala.

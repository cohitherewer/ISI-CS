 Pay-up threat at tap point

 Todays question: Is it right to deny water supply for failure to pay property tax? More responses will be published next week

 Property pangs: 

 Is water supply within a buildings tax net? 

 Vinay Shrestha,

 Lake Terrace

 It is not justified because water is essential for survival. But strict measures should be taken against the defaulters who do not pay the property tax. Taxes are essential as they finance the civic amenities. 

 S. Chakraborty, 

 Baranagar

 Water is important. Therefore, the civic body should not stop the supply. They should think of alternative ways to collect property tax. The civic body should also keep in mind that many pockets of the city do not get proper supply of filtered drinking water, but the people staying there do pay the tax. 

 T.R. Anand, 

 Budge Budge

 It is right, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) should withdraw the supply of water. The erring tax payers should be punished. Once their water line is cut, they will be forced to pay up. 

 Ravi Khaitan,

 Park Circus 

 Paying taxes has become a rare feature among Calcuttans. It is a fact that a handful of citizens pay property taxes. Therefore, steps like denying water supply for not paying property tax is a perfect way to teach the defaulters a lesson.

 S. Jhunjhunwala, 

 Moira Street

 The case is similar to a passenger travelling without a ticket and enjoying the benefits at the cost of others. The CMC should snap the water supply at once. And those who manage to get an illegal water connection should also be punished. 

 R.M. Paul Majumdar,

 Address not given 

 It is really unjust and unfair to deny water supply. Other services like electricity and drainage are paid commodities; therefore, the CMC can afford to give some concession in some cases. 

 Saikat Hazra,

 Bhadrakali, Hooghly

 The property tax fixed by the civic body is nominal. And if a citizen is not paying even that, it is logical to snap their water supply.

 Titas De Sarkar

 Lake Town

 It is inhuman to deny water supply. Water is vital for sustenance. Moreover, water is not directly related to property. Therefore, charging a fine for not paying property tax is not a good option. 

 B.N. Bose, 

 Dum Dum Park

 Water is our lifeline. The 

 civic body can give notices or may levy other taxes but 

 denying water supply will not yield suitable results. It 

 may lead to mass protests. 

 Prasenjit Das, 

 Jadavpur

 The water supply should not be denied immediately. The defaulter should be given two or three notices. But the government and the civic body should sympathise with the poor citizens.

Naren Sen,

 Howrah

 As a responsible citizen, it is our duty to pay taxes, as the CMC is not a non-profit organisation. If a tax-payer feels that he is being over-charged, he should approach the authorities and clarify his doubts. The civic body, on the other hand, should issue notice before disconnecting the water lines.

 D. Mukherjee,

 Behala 

 The matter is very delicate. The civic body has every right to disconnect the water lines, if property tax does not reach the authorities on time. But before disconnecting the lines, a formal notice should be sent. The civic body should also note that many house-owners, who do not get filtered water, pay their taxes on time. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia

 The civic body incurs expenses to provide services. Therefore, taxes of any kind play an important role in meeting the expenses. It is a known fact that many people do not pay property tax, so to teach them a lesson, the CMC should take such steps.

Samiran Das,

 Station Road

 The civic body and the government should keep in mind that water is essential for living. Snapping water lines is not a solution to recover property tax. It may be possible that many people cannot pay the taxes on time due to a financial crunch. The civic body can levy penalties. 

 Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur

 Well, such a rule is quite justified on the civic bodys part. Water supply should be stopped immediately and the defaulters should be punished for not paying taxes. Threat of disconnection is also an effective tool. 

 Ujjal Bhattacharyya,

 CIT Road, Entally

 Any penalty imposed should be backed by valid reason. Therefore, the rule should not be generalised. The civic body should review all details before taking such a step. Water is an essential commodity and at the same time the CMC is not a charitable organisation and cannot afford to waive taxes.

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue

 Defaulting on the levy is a serious offence. Those who are violating the law should be punished. Tax evaders should be charged thrice the amount. For a handful of law-breakers, others should not suffer.

Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala

 Water line cannot be disconnected for non-payment of property taxes. Water is our basic need and the CMC has no right to snap it. If property tax collection has become a big problem for the government and the corporation, alternative steps should be adopted.

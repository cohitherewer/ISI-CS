 Bare truth in black

 Manasi Salvi plays the protagonist in Sati.

The circumstances are similar. Both fell prey to male assault and subsequent miscarriage of justice. Of the two, one was shot dead, while the other, a victim of rape, lived to tell her tale and fight for others like her. 

 Sati: Satya Ki Khoj does have shades of the Jessica Lal incident in the drama, admit its makers. ?That incident acted as the trigger,? says channel COO Purnendu Bose. But Sati promises much more. The serial on Sahara One was launched at a glittering event at the Taj Lands End in Mumbai on Tuesday.

 It is the story of Sati Razdan, a law student, who takes up her own case to bring the offenders to book and how she motivates others to join her crusade. The result is Swayam, a law firm where every lawyer (and even the driver) is a woman and where silenced voices are raised.

 If it sounds like a plot where fact and fiction and activism merge, the reason is Kamlesh Pandey, the conceptualiser of Sati who also wrote the youth cult film Rang De Basanti. ?Over the years, the term sati has been grossly misused, so much so that it reminds us only of Hindu women throwing themselves into the husband?s pyre. But sati means a follower of truth. Anyone can be a sati ? you or I,? he argued, adding how the sati women in ancient Hindu texts, like Ahalya or Kunti or Tara, never sacrificed themselves .

 Pandey is guiding a team of writers whose job is rooted in research. ?Women believe fiction more than fact on television. Therefore we chose to deliver our message through a serial. It is not possible to lift real-life stories and put them straight on screen, but we have tried our best,? he added.

 The channel, which has been debunking the saas-bahu stereotypes, now adds to its stable of independent and empowered women with Sati Razdan. ?Our aim is to show real women facing the real world,? affirmed Bose.

 The colour of the evening was black, with a woman in black presenting an energised dance recital to start proceedings. Even Bose and Pandey were accompanied by uniformed royal guards. The stage itself was a witness box. This is where protagonist Manasi Salvi, dressed in a shimmering black sari, was introduced. ?Andhere se ladne ki taaqat hota hai sirf andhere mein,? went the showreel. 

 ?I never had to ask the dresser which was my costume. The black one would be mine,? Manasi joked after the formal address. The 23-year-old picked up the Maharshtra Purashkar for a Marathi film last year but it was an ad for Vim that gave her her first TV break with Ashirvaad. ?For this role, I had to study the lawyers, how they are politely aggressive,? she said. The serial is not all courtroom, arguments and counter-arguments, though. ?Sati?s friends and family will share much of the spotlight,? Bose clarified.

 For now, the focus is on Manasi. The show goes on air on Monday, at 8 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cool tent or tinderbox

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An air-conditioned enclosure made of wood ? around 30x40 ft and 20-ft tall ? is being constructed in the courtyard of a residential complex in Ballygunge Place. The occasion is a happy one; the risk is huge.

 ?This AC tent for a marriage ceremony cannot be allowed. Our building has only one entry/exit point. In case of a fire, we will all be trapped,? cries K.P.B. Sanyal, former sheriff of Calcutta and a resident of the complex. ?A fire brigade inspection was conducted on Monday; this is another Meerut waiting to happen,? he warns.

 From spaces private to public, the trend of using AC tents for fairs and functions is catching on, and so the fear factor following the Meerut killer blaze on Monday is bound to rise.

 ?Calcutta does not have any permanent site for holding fairs like Delhi, Hyderabad or Chennai. For international fairs or where machines need to be brought in, an AC tent is the only option,? says exhibition designer Amit Saraogi.

 If Hyderabad?s dedicated fair space Hitex Exhibition Centre has AC ducts at ground level, Chennai?s Trade Centre is large enough to allow open space between AC hangars.

 The air-conditioners at Calcutta?s makeshift fair grounds are hung from the iron superstructures and connected via cable to the cooling units several feet away from the arena. ?But in some cases, the ACs cannot be hung and have to be placed on something. This calls for extra care being taken for fire safety,? adds Saraogi.

 The fire services department has decided to tighten the safety belt for fairs, especially those putting up AC tents. ?Following the Meerut tragedy, we will be very strict while granting the no-objection certificate. Of the 26 recommendations that are laid down as safety conditions for erection of temporary structures, an organiser must abide by at least 15,? said Gopal Krishna Bhattacharjee, acting director of fire services.

 Crystallizing the very essence of human emotions, instincts and sensitivities, miniature sculptures have the power to express a host of meaningful insights in spite of their modest dimensions. Siddhivinayak, the ongoing exhibition of miniature sculptures by Jayanta Chatterjee, presents a collection of diminutive models of Lord Ganesha that strikes us with their refreshing simplicity and playful, endearing expressions. Sculpted in the style of toy-like clay models used in animation, these tiny figures recreate in magnificent fashion the almost lost world of miniature art. On display are visually appealing tiny figures of the Elephant God in his stern, lordly, gentle and joyful aspects. Small but profound, colourful yet intense, they portray the lovable, portly god of wealth and wisdom in his different moods; sometimes visualised as the almighty creator, an ascetic, or a divine dispenser of justice, and, at others, just an ordinary fisherman (picture left).

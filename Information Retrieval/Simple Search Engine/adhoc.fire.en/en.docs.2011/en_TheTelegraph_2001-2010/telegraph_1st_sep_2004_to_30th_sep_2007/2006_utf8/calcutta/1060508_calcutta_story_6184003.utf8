 We Indians never let anybody forget that ours is an ancient civilisation. Yet, when it comes to protecting our monuments, we are most negligent. 

 The Archaeological Survey of India has 5,000 monuments under its protection. Compare this figure with England, which under its Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, had by December 1989 listed 435,000 heritage buildings in that country alone. 

 Mumbai, which played a pioneering role in protecting its built heritage, had begun listing such structures in 1991 and this was legislated as a heritage regulation in 1995. 

 But of late, with certain changes in regulations, the builders? and promoters? lobby has again got the better of the bureaucrats, says Sharada Dwivedi, conservation activist of Mumbai.

 In Calcutta, the city?s built heritage is at the mercy of the promoters, although they alone cannot be blamed as the villain of the piece. 

 The government and administration have played a passive role when it comes to protecting the heritage.

 Although the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had inventorised in detail 175 buildings, these are not easily available to the public. Now the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) is out with a well-produced book of listings, titled Calcutta Built Heritage Today. 

 Sponsored by AmbujaRealty, it lists about 500 buildings, and as Nilina Deb Lal, who had undertaken the phenomenal though rewarding job of documentation, compiling and photographing the buildings, says: ?This is only a sampling.?

 Gour Mohan Kapur, convener, Intach West Bengal and Calcutta regional chapters, says the NGO has already published such books for the public on the built heritage of Delhi and Chennai. Way back in 1987, Intach had commissioned Debashis Nayak to produce a list of 300 buildings, followed by another effort by a team in the 1990s. But when Deb Lal proceeded to update the material, she found that much of it was ?inadequate and inaccurate?, says Kapur.

 She worked from July 2003 to April 2005 to get this listing ready. Kapur explained that this listing has no official sanction. ?It is Intach?s impression of the buildings that need to be preserved. Even if these are subsequently destroyed, at least they will remain documented for posterity,? he said, adding that this will be followed up by a listing of 1,500-2,000 buildings.

 Deb Lal says she had worked so intensively, and the volume of material she had collected was so huge that at times she was ?close to tears.? Quite obviously, she did not cover the new wards in east and south-east Calcutta. 

 The information provided is classified under several heads, such as categories of buildings, information on individual buildings like date on which it came up, ownership and occupancy, current usage, maintenance and features. Address, grading on the basis of archaeological significance, historical or social merit, architectural merit are all there. Besides, there is a location map, which comes in handy. 

 One wishes she had provided a bit more detail about ownership instead of the label ?private?. The Chorbagan Mitra house on Muktaram Babu Street should have been mentioned as such, as she has in the case of the Durgacharan Mitra Lane house. There is no mention of the city?s only dochala temple on Kshirode Bidyabinode Avenue.

 There are some minor inaccuracies. The Star theatre where Binodini Dasi had appeared in the role of Chaitanya was on Beadon Street and not in Hatibagan. And the first public performance of a play (not Nildarpan) was held in Ghariwala Mullickbari in Chitpur. One wishes there was some mention of the Anglo-Indian homes in Ripon Street-Elliot Road area. 

 It is easy to pick holes but as the first handbook of its kind, it should have a tremendous impact on raising conservation awareness. Before its launch, the book is available at Bingsha Satabdi at 75C, Park Street.

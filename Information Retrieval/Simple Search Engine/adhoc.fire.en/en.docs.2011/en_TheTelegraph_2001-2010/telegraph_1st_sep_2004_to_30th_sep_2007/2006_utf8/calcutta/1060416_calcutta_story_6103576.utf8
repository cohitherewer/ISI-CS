 What: Shoppers 

 Stop Poila Baisakh Celebration in association with Sananda.

 Where: Both the outlets, at City Centre and Forum. 

 When: April 8 to 15.

 Take a look: As part of the Bengali new year celebrations, Shoppers Stop had quite an entertainment line-up for its customers ? musical performances by fusion band Prithivi, folk band Kaya, Baisakher Gaan by Rupankar, fashion shows and audio visual game shows. 

 Astrologers, flute players, bangle sellers and Baul artistes added to the traditional charm.

 The celebrations culminated with a fashion show on Saturday afternoon. Titled Banglar Besh Bhusha ? Shekal--Ekal, the show was divided into six sequences. Choreographed by Riya Mitra, the show displayed the summer collection from Shoppers Stop and saris by Satya Paul.

 Models Priyanka Pal, Tanusree, Ankush, Pooja, Sanchita and others walked down the escalators and stairs, showcasing an array of traditional and contemporary garments.

 The colour palette included summer shades like off-white, pale brown, baby pink, ice blue as well as solid blacks, pinks and reds.

 Taant saris with ornate borders and butis were teamed with strappy cholis and smart blouses. Some went the off-shoulder way. Then there were short kurtas teamed with embroidered churidars, long ones with floral prints and silk ones in tussar and khadi.

 Saris from Satya Paul featured trademark polkas, stripes and abstract prints in hues of grey, citrine and blood red.

 For formal wear, there were striped shirts, straight line skirts and blazers teamed with well-fitted trousers. Casual wear included gypsy skirts, long and knee length, capris and hot pants.

 The men showcased plain long kurtas with broad pintucks, and blazers.

 Voiceover: It is an effort to usher in the Bengali new year in style. The events ensured an exciting shopping experience for our customers. We play host to stylish buys and what better way to showcase the spring summer collection than a fashion show? smiled Santanu Ghosh, unit head of Shoppers Stop, City Centre.

 Lounge launch

 What: Inaugural bash of 

 I. 

 Where: The Metropolis mall, 

 Hiland Park.

 When: April 14 and 15.

 Take a look: Dim lights, mood music, flowers on the walls, jasmines generously sprinkled on the tables and candles in cheerful splashes?

 The 3,500 sq ft lounge restaurant looked all geared up for a grand opening on Friday evening. Guests, mostly from the corporate sector, chilled out, unwinding and catching up with friends.

 As the evening progressed, the party mood picked up with DJ Akash belting out chartbusters like Bin tere sanam, Pathshala, Neele neele ambar and Superstar. The ladies took to the floor first, soon to be joined by the men in the crowd.

 Then came the much-awaited part of the evening ? a rocking performance by Usha Uthup. Sporting her trademark bindi, gajra and South Indian drape, she did not disappoint.

 The Dont Worry Kolkata lady started with I Believe in Music, moving over to Dum maro dum, Shaan se, Cha Cha Cha and more.

 The high-energy performance ensured that the dance floor was packed, with the crowd cheering, grooving and clapping along.

 Meanwhile, a champagne bottle popped open and an I-shaped cake was cut. 

 Usha switched to hip hop and then to current hits like Dus bahane and Kajra re. 

 If the music was rocking, the busy bar counter was happening, too. Flair bartenders displayed their juggling skills and fire acts.

 The celebrations continued on Saturday with a performance by musician Bikram Ghosh.

 Sip n bite: The 

 party people sipped on Breezer, vodka, Blue Berry Blush, 

 Ginger Colada and more. And they munched on loads of finger 

 food. The dinner spread was an assortment of Indian and 

 Chinese delicacies.

 Spotted: A host of familiar names and faces including Suvaprasanna, Sweety Arora, Oindrilla Dutt, Nandita Raja, Darshan Shah, Jayabrato Chatterjee, Indrajit, Nilanjana Chakraborty, Sumit Dabriwala and Priti Patel.

 Voiceover: We want 

 people coming to I to let their hair down and hang out the 

 way they like best. So, we kept the inaugural bash very 

 informal. The performance by Usha was definitely a value 

 addition, smiled Vishal Kapur, one of the four partners 

 of I.

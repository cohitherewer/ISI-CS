The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Drizzle lowers mercury

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 An overcast sky through the day gave way to a drizzle on Thursday evening.

 The weather is likely to remain unchanged on Friday, said the Met office, with grey skies and the occasional drizzle. The weekend, however, should be sunny and pleasant.

 We expect light to moderate rain in the city and its neighbourhood. The rainfall will be heavier in the districts, stated G.C. Debnath, director (weather) of Alipore Regional Meteorological Centre.

 Heavy incursion of moisture over the past two days from a low-pressure trough over the Bay of Bengal has been causing the rain, explained Met officials.

 The trough extends from the south-west Bay to the coastal areas of Bengal, they added.

 Once the sky clears, wind from the north and the north-west is likely to bring down the temperature.

 This should not be confused with the onset of winter. Around this time, northern India gets moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean Sea, which we call the Western Disturbance. Winds blow from a low-pressure zone to cause cloudy skies, rain and a dip in temperature in Bengal, said a Met official.

 The winds that bring in winter are still far off and not expected here before December, added the official.

 But the weather will remain pleasant till then. In December, the sky clears up in north India and cold, dry winds blow unhindered across Bihar and Jharkhand into Bengal. This causes the mercury to drop here, along with fog and mist, explained another Met official.

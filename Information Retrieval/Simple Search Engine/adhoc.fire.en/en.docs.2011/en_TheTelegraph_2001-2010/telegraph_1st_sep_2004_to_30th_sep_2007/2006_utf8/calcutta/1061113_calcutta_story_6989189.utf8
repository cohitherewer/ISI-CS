The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

You cant get through this week without

 Cheering for children 

You dont have to wait for November 14 

to pamper the tiny ones, but Childrens Day does have a special ring to it. 

Take out time for kids yours and others and gift them a day they will 

remember for a long time to come. Spend time playing, lounging, chatting, or maybe 

doing nothing more than giving them your full and undivided attention. Double 

their joy with presents. Choose from a trip to the games parlour, take them to 

Garfield 2, shower them with goodie hampers, kiddie gadgets Top it with 

a treat at their favourite dessert parlour.

Tuning in to Bigg Boss

 Bobby Darling is voted out and that is just 

the beginning of the dramatic three months ahead. Catch celebrities be themselves 

as they try to make Bigg Bosss home their own. Rakhi Sawants 

domestication, Aryan Vaid trying to woo Anupama Verma, girls ganging 

up against Ragini, Deepak Parashers mummy-like ways Entertainment takes 

a new turn in this Sony reality show hosted by Arshad Warsi. So, are you in it? 

Mastering pile-on

 Perfect the pile-on technique this winter as 

you play around with jackets of varying lengths, from shrugs to overcoats The 

art lies in combining them aesthetically, balancing the silhouette all the way. 

Long sleeves under shorter sleeves, waistcoats over tees, shirts over a jacket 

Let your sense of fashion ride wild. Choose shades from a similar colour family 

for a muted, toned-down look or pick contrasts from two ends of the palette for 

the shock effect.

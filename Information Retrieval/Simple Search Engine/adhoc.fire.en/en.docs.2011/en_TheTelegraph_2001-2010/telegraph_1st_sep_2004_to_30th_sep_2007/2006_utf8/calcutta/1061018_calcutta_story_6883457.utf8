 SUBHRO SAHA

 Listen to your favourite number on an array of audio options in studio silence before making your choice. Settle into a massage chair while choosing the right projection TV. Figure out if the pot of mishti doi sits snug in the fridge you are eyeing...

 Great Eastern Technocity, the first electronics mall in town, is ready to unveil its range of consumer electronic gadgets with an experience shopping theme at 15B, Sarat Bose Road on Thursday to catch the Dhanteras-Diwali bumper window. Eastern Indias biggest multi-brand electronics superstore is spread across 20,000 sq ft over five levels.

 The unique element of the mammoth outlet is the experience zone at each level. It gives the consumer a plethora of choices through live product demonstrations in an interactive and contemporary environment, says Pulkit Baid, director of Technocity, from the house of Great Eastern Appliances, a Rs 130-crore turnover group.

 So, theres a 1,200-sq-ft listening lounge for music system buyers and three home-theatre studios for customers looking for the right LCD or plasma TV to suit their requirements. The store even offers live demos and cooking workshops for microwave seekers and complimentary laundry and pressing for those seeking washers and ironing gadgets.

 If there are Yamaha amps and Harmon Kardon speakers for the audiophile, the second-floor chill zone has 16 live air-conditioners of different makes in an ice-cube AC room and staff members carrying trolleys of foodstuff to simulate storage options for freezers.

 We want the customer to develop a bonding with the product before buying. Also for the first time, we will have a call centre tied up with all the manufacturers to coordinate customer complaints and ensure prompt services, discloses Baid.

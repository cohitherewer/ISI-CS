 Geologists say India and Australia were once joined in one gigantic landmass called Gondwanaland.

 A group from Down Under led by Amanda Vanstone, Australian minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, came Calcutta calling last weekend to further the current connect, hawking skilled jobs and tourism hot spots.

 At a skilled migration expo held by the Australian high commission in the city on March 10 and 11, Australian employers scouted for local engineers, professional cooks, mechanics and personnel from metal trades, construction and technical tradespeople.

 ?We have had 10 years of economic growth and good governance and thanks to the resources boom, the unemployment rate is at a low of five per cent, with the jobs market really opening up. We feel Calcutta and its huge hinterland can answer the needs of many Australian employers,? Vanstone told Metro.

 Australia is aiming to increase the size of its skilled migration programme for the ninth year on the trot. 

 There are currently many opportunities in Australia for skilled workers in a wide range of professions ? from civil engineers to geophysicists, mining managers to physiotherapists, chefs to hairdressers ? the minister stressed.

 The skills interface platform, with a sharp focus on mining, presented an opportunity for local youth to discuss options of permanent and skilled migration with a range of Australian employers and government representatives. Detailed information was available on migration opportunities, Australia?s culture and lifestyle and support for new migrants.

 To be eligible for skilled migration to Australia, the candidate must be under 45 when applying, have vocational English, post-secondary qualifications relevant to the occupation applied for and recent work experience in that occupation, according to Sushmita Sankrit, regional research assistant, visa office, Australian high commission.

 The novel Calcutta skills expo aimed to reach out to a focused target audience picked after a meticulous screening process. ?Registration information of the respondents was screened to identify members of our target groups who appear to meet eligibility requirements and who would be of most interest to the employers,? explained Amanda Paxton, first secretary (immigration).

 The minister felt Australia, with its multicultural character and kaleidoscope of sights and sounds, was also one of the most attractive tourism hubs of the world. ?Pretty much everything you would like to do during a holiday, you can do it in Australia. And with so many connections from Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong, it?s not too difficult to get there either,? she smiled.

 From the tropical rainforests of Cairns to the breathtaking sights of The Rock, the majestic Sydney Opera House and the sparkling beaches of the Gold Coast ? the options are endless. ?Also, the travel and accommodation facilities are top-of-the-line,? offered Greg Kelly, minister-counsellor (immigration) amp; regional director (South Asia), Australian high commission.

 The minister felt that if the Great Barrier Reef doesn?t wow the tourist, Melbourne, ?an Australianised European city?, surely would, or the wine-growing Adelaide. ?In fact, South Australia now exports more wine to the UK than the French,? she added.

 To boost tourist traffic to Kangaroo land and make the task of skilled migrants looking to make Australia their home easier, the immigration department is kicking off its e-visas programme in October. ?We have an ageing population and need young people to come and fill up the many vacant posts, and we are confident skills expos like this can act as an apt matchmaker,? Vanstone said.

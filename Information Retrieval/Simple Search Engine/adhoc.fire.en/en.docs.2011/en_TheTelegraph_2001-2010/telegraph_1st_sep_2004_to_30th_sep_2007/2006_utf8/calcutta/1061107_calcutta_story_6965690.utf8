 Forms and colours

 Presenting a remarkable emotional mix of unbridled enthusiasm and solemn dignity, fearless passion and serious contemplation, warm empathy and indifferent observation, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by a group of veteran artists offers a unique visual treat to art lovers. Portraying ubiquitous themes that have contemporary relevance, the works on show are mainly optimistic in intent, evoking feelings of comfort, serenity, hope and faith. Featuring both illustrative and figurative works, the paintings are a riot of colours, in stark blues, bright yellows and violent reds. Clearly defined forms and shapes distinguish the sculptures crafted in bronze, ceramic and terracotta, and are mostly symbolic in design. Participating artists include Ashim Basu, Barnali Das, Hiran Mitra, Partha Pratim Deb, Ratan Banerjee (a painting by him appears above), Ramaprasad Ghatak, Sibananda Mondal and Tapas Basu.

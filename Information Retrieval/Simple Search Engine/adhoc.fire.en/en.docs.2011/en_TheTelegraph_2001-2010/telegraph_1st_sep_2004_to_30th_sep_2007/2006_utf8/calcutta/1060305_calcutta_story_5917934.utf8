 Revival of a riverside rendezvous

 Sipping beer in the relaxed setting of the minimalist annexe of the hip, new-look bar. Leafing through rare tomes of army warfare strategies in the library, digging into the luscious Tandoori Fish and the crispy Chilli Babycorn. Or just jiving away the blues at the rain-dance fling.

 Ordnance Club, established by British ordnance officers in Calcutta back in 1907, has stepped into its centenary year riding on a clutch of upgrade initiatives to excite members and guests. Almost a year in operation now after the 75-day shutdown last year, the management at the riverside rendezvous promises pluses galore, going forward.

 ?When I assumed charge in February 2005, the club was in a shambles and all the sections needed immediate attention. The catering contractor, whose contract had expired, refused to leave even though the food he supplied was rotten, and the staff union resisted change. So I had no option but to close down the premises and when we reopened after two-and-a-half months, we did so on our own terms,? says M.K. Chaudhary, president of the club.

 A new caterer was appointed and there was ?no looking back?. The first to change was the bar, which was completely overhauled, with new flooring, modern furniture, sleek bar stools with a swank counter. The annexe was transformed into a cosy lounge with the period-piece furniture replaced by plush low-slung sofas, new vitrified tiles on the floor, split ACs in place of the old 85-tonne air-conditioning plant, the works.

 ?Our member Amit Chowdhury did the interiors and we also revived the health club, which was lying defunct since 2001, giving it to Bodyline Sports to set up and run,? explains the president. From the latest treadmills to exer-cycles to cardio fitness equipment and weight-training, sauna and steam facilities, the gym answers a long-standing need, feels Ashit Luthra, who is on the club?s entertainment committee.

 The management has also doubled the capacity of the main lounge from 24 to 48, throwing in a dance floor with a dedicated music system, effect lights and giant-screen plasma TV. ?Our aim is to transform the club into a very contemporary haunt that compares with the best civilian places in the city,? stresses Chaudhary.

 The dining hall is also being overhauled and the swimming pool and guest rooms being given a facelift. A new party pad, the Peacock Room, has been added, to accommodate 60-odd revellers indoors. ?Our sports facilities have always been our forte, and while Enrico Piperno runs a tennis coaching clinic, the badminton court is surely among the best in town,? says Luthra.

 The library racks at Ordnance Club boast a collection of rare books, particularly on military techniques and strategy. The pub nights are popular and the April 8 dinner marking the raising day of the Army Ordnance Corp is a red-letter evening. But nothing quite beats the rain-dance frenzy. ?We have decided to hold the rain-dance carnival twice a year, since it?s the most popular event in the club?s calendar. Perhaps we will have to find ways to extend the seating at the December cruise party, which is normally booked months in advance,? the president observes.

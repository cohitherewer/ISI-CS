The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Most people buy platform tickets to see off or receive their friends and relatives 

at stations. Strangely, the platform tickets are valid only for two hours. With 

late running of trains becoming common and even Up trains leaving after their 

scheduled departure time, platform ticket-holders cannot be held responsible for 

staying in the station for more than two hours. The railway authorities must take 

steps to ensure that the platform ticket-holders are not unnecessarily harassed 

by their staff. Perhaps, at the time of purchase of a platform ticket, the person 

at the counter can ascertain for what purpose it is being bought and make a relevant 

note at the back. May be the platform tickets can even be colour-coded to avoid 

confusion.

 I am a subscriber of BSNL?s DataOne broadband service. My plan is Home 250, 

under which users can download upto 400 MB of data without having to make any 

payment in addition to the monthly rental. The other plans offered by BSNL allow 

users to download as much data as they want for free between 2 am and 8 am. Home 

250 users are not entitled to the facility. The DataOne website provides the usage 

details of subscribers excluding the volume of data downloaded between 2 am and 

8 am. This is extremely inconvenient for Home 250 users who use the account during 

the free hours. They might easily overshoot their download limit without realising 

it and end up paying extra. I urge the BSNL authorities to look into the matter 

immediately.

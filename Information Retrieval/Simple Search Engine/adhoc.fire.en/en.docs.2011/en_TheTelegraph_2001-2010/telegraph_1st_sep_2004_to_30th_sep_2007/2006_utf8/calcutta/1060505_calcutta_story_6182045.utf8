 Most of them havent seen something like this before. So I think we will have to come to India more often, quipped Stephen Phele, minutes before taking the stage at Kala Mandir on Wednesday evening. And he wasnt far from the truth.

 As Phele and his co-performers danced a mix of tap, hip-hop and African tribal to a medley of drumbeat and music, the crowd clapped, whistled and clamoured for more even after 90 minutes of high-voltage action.

 African Footprint, the longest running musical from South Africa, almost caught Calcutta unawares as it breezed through town on Wednesday. The whirlwind India tour began with Mumbai in April and ends in Chennai, with Bangalore, Delhi and Calcutta in between. The trip is being sponsored by the South African High Commission and ICCR to celebrate the 12th year of South Africas democracy.

 The 30-member troupe touring India comprises 17 dancers, four singers, five percussionists and a musician who plays the South African pennywhistle.

 Fusing a variety of traditional South African dances with western forms ? ballet, jazz, tap, gumboot, jive and pantsula ? the group performed to a medley of songs tracing the evolution of South Africa. The intricate footwork and frenetic body movements synchronised with racy rhythmic beats formed the core of the pulsating extravaganza.

 Dribbling footballs in a coordinated dance number, a mock fight of tap dancers and swift costume changes on stage in between sequences ? all added up to get the crowd really going.

 Its very difficult. You need to be fit, mentally and physically, to be able to do the show. It needs a lot of concentration, so 30 minutes before the show we sit down and focus and warm up, revealed lead dancer Phele, who worked with a dance company before becoming part of Footprints original cast. I have travelled 17 countries just dancing, he laughed.

 The musical was conceived and produced by Richard Loring in 2000. After the initial staging at Globe theatre in Johannesburg, Loring took it to England, America, China and the whole of Europe. The musical has had more than 3,000 performances at home and abroad since. One of its many highlights was performing at the cricket World Cup in 2003.

 Footprint resembles Africa, with everything interwoven. It celebrates South Africa, what it has been and what it will be, said 25-year-old singer Ntambo Sepeng, who has been with the troupe for two years. We have grown up listening to the music of Barbra Streisand. We never looked at our own African artistes. When I got into this show it changed my whole perspective. It gave me my identity of being an African without being ashamed.

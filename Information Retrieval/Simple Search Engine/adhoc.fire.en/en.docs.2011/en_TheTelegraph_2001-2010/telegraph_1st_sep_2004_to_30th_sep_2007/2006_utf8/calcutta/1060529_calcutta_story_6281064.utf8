Life

 A cakewalk to the crown

 Madhabilata Mitra, Priyanka Laurembaum and Lisa Nandi? Contestant number 20, 12 and 2. The winner, first runner-up and second runner-up of Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006 respectively. 

 So what did these girls have that the others didnt? Was it their beauty, past compare? Was it spectacular brains? While no one can pinpoint the X-factor that placed the crowns on the girls heads, what the triumphant trio had to say to the judges was certainly a key. Here are samples. 

A short while after 9 pm? Thats when 20 went 

down to 10. Ten gorgeous girls, nervous and excited. Barry Brien, the host 

for the evening, played a quick game as a warm-up. He turned the table on himself, 

kicking off the first question-answer round of the evening, but got the girls 

to shoot the rapid-fire questions ? at him. They didnt show mercy. Sample 

this: 

 Madhabilata: Hey Barry, whats 

your waist size?

Barry: 28. (Long pause.) Plus 10.

 Priyanka: When was the last time you 

had a bath? 

Barry: (Trying hard to be believable): Just 

four hours ago. Alone. 

Lisa: If you had to choose Tilottama 

amongst one of us, who would it be? 

Barry: Hmmm, I think it would be number six, 12, 20, 

16, 15, 19? 

It was time for the real Q amp;A. Each finalist picked 

up the name of a judge. 

Rituparna Sengupta to Madhabilata: What is 

your favourite dream and how do you want to fulfil it? 

My dream is to enrich my life with valuable 

experiences and diverse education. 

Rajeev Khandelwal to Priyanka: How important 

is it for you to feel secure with your man and how would you define security? 

If a man understands his responsibilities and 

duties towards me and his family, he would be able to give me security. Of course, 

money matters too! 

Joy Goswami to Lisa: If you were the most beautiful 

woman in the world, then what would be your message to others who are not as beautiful 

as you? 

I would reach out and tell them that external 

beauty is not all. The way you behave, the way you treat people, everything is 

important and beauty is the complete package. 

Ten down to five?The girls were inching closer to 

the crown. Heartbeats were quickening. Now for some more flashes of ready wit, 

as what lay between these five girls and the Tilottama goodies was just Deemag 

Ki Batti, the final question round. 

The common question to each of them: If children 

are the future, youth present, then would you term parents as past?

Pens scribbling fast and the seconds ticking away 

loud ? very Pink Floyd, or was it the girls hearts pounding? The eternity 

of the one minute was finally over. Here are the answers that worked their way 

to the judges heart. 

Madhabilata: Without our parents, it 

is not possible to be present. Without the present there can be no future? So 

how can our parents be past? 

 Priyanka: Parents are the ones who have 

taught us everything, who brought us into the world. They are the past, present 

as well as the future. 

Lisa: Parents have given us birth, they 

can never be past. They are king-makers, they make us what we are.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Singapore sojourn for school heads

 - BRAINSTORMING ABROAD

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A mix of serious talks and fun on a foreign shore is the trademark of corporate culture.

 No, not really. Educational institutions, too, have taken a fancy to the idea.

 Departing from the usual practice of organising ?long, monotonous? meetings at one of its institutions, the Calcutta diocese of Church of North India (CNI) had recently flown principals and other senior officials of its schools to Singapore for a ?brain-storming session? on academic and administrative matters.

 At least 14 principals and secretaries of reputed English-medium schools, controlled by the CNI, joined the trip to the city state last month. Church officials say funds were provided by well-wishers, friends and alumni of the institutions.

 ?At least eight meetings with school heads and secretaries are held every year for discussing important administrative and academic issues,? said Bishop P.S.P. Raju, who also oversees the functioning of the schools.

 ?Normally, such meetings are held at one of our schools in Calcutta. This time, we decided to meet in Singapore to bring the heads and secretaries some relief from boredom and monotony,? he pointed out.

 The institutions represented at the Singapore sojourn included La Martiniere for Boys, La Martiniere for Girls, St Thomas group of schools, Pratt Memorial, St James and St John?s Diocesan School.

 The trip, Bishop Raju emphasised, was not just for pleasure. ?We have a common set of policies for all our institutions. One of the reasons that prompted us to organise the trip was to give the principals and secretaries an opportunity to share their opinions. And we felt the exercise would be more fruitful if the venue was far away from the city,? he explained. The tour also helped the participants forge a stronger bond among themselves.

 An official clarified that the CNI gave its nod to the idea only after ensuring that money meant for running the institutions would not have to be diverted to foot the tour bill. ?The trip was finalised after well-wishers and friends agreed to provide funds.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A camera on a stick

 - INDIA PRICE PLANNED AT RS 15 LAKH

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The portable Polecam with carbon fibre extendable pole has ceased to be a niche product

 It?s just ?a camera on a stick?, say its makers. But the Polecam can film windsurfing to under-water fishing and soccer matches to music videos with equal ease and elan.

 A brainchild of professional sports cameraman Stefan Hewitt, the portable camera weighs just 35 kg and can reach up to 20 ft with a carbon fibre extendable pole.

 ?It?s a niche product, but we?re finding more and more takers around the world. It?s a head-turner at the exhibitions we visit,? said Mel Noonan of the Kempton, UK-based Polecam Limited. The company has tied up with Calcutta-based Victor Informatics to market the product in India.

 ?The UK remains our biggest market for the moment, but we have sold the Polecam in Germany, Italy, Russia and recently in the US, too,? Noonan added.

 Both standard-definition and high-definition cameras can be used with the Polecam setup. The crane, bundled with a standard-definition camera from Toshiba, comes for around ?20,000, while a high-definition camera from Ikegami takes it up to around ?35,000.

 ?We?re planning to make it available in India for less than Rs 15 lakh but there?s a 32 per cent customs duty, which makes it difficult,? offered Samir Mukherjee of Victor Informatics.

 ?It?s a wonderful device and I intend to use it in shooting various projects,? said Kshitij Rajkumar, a city-based video production professional who bought the first Polecam.

 NON 

 - RESIDENT CALCUTTAN

 The British Museum, best known 

 for its Egyptian mummies and Elgin Stones, has been the 

 epicentre of a great Bengali upheaval for the past few weeks, 

 with an exhibition called Voices of Bengal showcasing 

 Bengali culture. 

 The impressive Great Court served 

 as the venue for the creation of a spectacular 20-foot image 

 of the goddess Durga. Fashioned on site by craftsmen from 

 Kumartuli, clay from Devon and straw from English fields, 

 Durga grew swiftly and by the third week of September, she 

 stood resplendent in gold and daker saaj. 

 A group of dhakis from 

 Murshidabad played in the Courtyard. Young tourists loved 

 this image of the new Britain. Hundreds of schoolchildren 

 listened to the Durga stories and gasped at the slaying 

 of Mahishasura. 

 The installation was surrounded 

 by live music and dance performances. I showcased British 

 Bengali dancers in the piece Sakhi. It was a big 

 journey for the young artistes from small community halls 

 to the Great Court. 

 Voices of Bengal, August 

 12 to January 7, launched an exhibiton of Tagores 

 paintings, part of the museum holdings but never displayed 

 before. Thousands from the community turned up to witness 

 Mahalaya celebrated in the Court. 

 Scores of sari-clad Bangladeshi 

 women from East End, who probably stepped into the British 

 Museum for the first time, did so to see the glorious Durga 

 installation. This really had nothing to do with religion, 

 rather everything with the cultural practice of both Bengals. 

 An exhibition featuring religious 

 stories, scrolls and artefacts investigated the rich traditions 

 of story-telling. The story new to me was from the 13-metre 

 Gazi scroll that recounts the deeds of the saint who brought 

 Islam to Bengal. 

 In that space Gurupada Chitrakar 

 unfolded his patas (scrolls) and sang songs to a 

 fascinated audience.

 Then Durga had to be transferred 

 to Camden Town Hall for worship. So we all walked in a procession, 

 the curators of the Museum fell in, dhakis drummed, 

 young people danced and cheered as Durga was taken on a 

 truck with her children. 

 As the peak traffic was held back 

 to let the procession pass through Bloomsbury, the traffic 

 police quickly clicked their cameras and people opened doors 

 and windows and cheered and clapped. 

 Young Sona Dutta of the British 

 Museum shouted: Did we ever dream that we would walk 

 in such a procession and stop traffic in Bloomsbury? 

 As cries of Durga Ma ki Jai 

 rent the tranquil evening air around Russell Square, it 

 seemed this assertion of cultural identity should finally 

 boost the Bengalis self confidence, somewhat lacking 

 among the diaspora here. 

 That evening though, the Bengalis 

 were as robust as the Punjabis and rocked to the music. 

 And Durga was more beautiful than I ever remembered her 

 she reminded me of the traditional Maddox Square protima.

 Its been over five decades 

 since a handful of Bengalis put together some money for 

 Saraswati Puja. When one of the young men proposed Durga 

 Puja, the others thought he was out of his mind. 

 But in 1962 the first Bengali 

 Durga Puja took place in London, after 350 were raised 

 by phoning every Bengali family in the London directory. 

 The festival moved to Belsize Park. In 1991 it moved to 

 Camden Town Hall. Today the five-day festival has 1,500 

 people go through its doors daily. As many people are fed 

 twice a day. 

 Media attention brought in a new 

 crowd this time. They were far more mainstream, tourists 

 and Londoners. It was about connecting with new people. 

 An Irishman who loved his khichuri 

 came back to take photographs every day (I suspect it was 

 also the love of hot Indian food). 

 A lovely Scottish couple came 

 every evening and said they had found new energy after knowing 

 about the goddess at once the fierce one and the protector. 

 Calcutta TV channels had swiftly 

 sent in reporters and young beauties in their finery were 

 being interviewed. 

 At last came the day when Durga 

 had to leave. Another carefully planned operation to dismantle 

 the huge framework, put the images in containers and transport 

 them to the Thames under Putney Bridge. The day was sprinkled 

 with showers and sunshine. 

 As we waited for high tide, the 

 drummers hit it again and the dancers swayed gracefully 

 with the music. Overhead, the bridge was full of people, 

 even the red buses had stopped to see what was happening. 

 As Ma Durga was lifted, the rains 

 came down, and curator Richard Blurton sighed: There 

 goes my Durga! Almost as if to make him feel better, 

 the sun splashed light on the bridge. 

 As Durga was immersed mid-stream, 

 a huge rainbow magically arched on the skies. Durga floated 

 swiftly downstream, clay to clay, and life was a circle 

 once again. 

 l the stories and rhythms of the 

 past few days concentrated into little drops of light. As 

 a second rainbow sprang across the skies, I was left with 

 a magical moment to clutch on to, as were the other teary-eyed 

 Bengalis on the banks of the Thames.

 Sangeeta Datta, an associate 

 director of the under-production film Brick Lane, 

 teaches at London University.

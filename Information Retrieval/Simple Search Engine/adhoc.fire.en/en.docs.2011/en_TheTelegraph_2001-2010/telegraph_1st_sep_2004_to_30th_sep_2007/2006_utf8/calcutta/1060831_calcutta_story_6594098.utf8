The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Five-star feel, 

 at home

 Opulent, luxurious and 

 dreamy designs... Hotel rooms are made of all this and more. 

 Shradha Agarwal finds out ways to bring the 

 magic to your personal space 

 House 

 Proud

 Opulent curtains dreamily romancing 

 the carpeted expanse or hard wood flooring. Fresh flowers 

 sunning themselves pretty in the finest vases. The most 

 inviting sink-till-you-cant-sink-more beds. Luxury 

 is what a star hotel room is all about. But some in Calcutta 

 want that in their homes now. 

 With the city already boasting 

 about 400 apartments costing around a crore the figure 

 is set to double in three years and some even ready to 

 shell out more than Rs 2 crore for a flat, there is a growing 

 demand for the five-star look in homes. 

 Architect and interior designer 

 Vivek Rathore agrees: Many want a luxurious feel, 

 a five star experience in terms of gadgets and fit-outs 

 in their master bedrooms and bathrooms, but with a major 

 thrust on personalising. 

 Says designer Charu Rajgarhia, 

 designer of some of the rooms in Hyatt Regency Calcutta: 

 Interestingly a lot of older age-bracket also wanted 

 to go for swanky, hotel-like room and bathroom, says 

 Charu. 

 But what makes a star hotel room 

 a star hotel room? For some, like interior designer Gopa 

 Ray who has been in the Taj Bengal design team, within 

 the reach is the key phrase that forms the backbone 

 of a hotel room. 

 She says: Whether it is 

 the array of two-way switches within half a stretch of your 

 arm or the mini bar by your bedside, everything should be 

 well within the reach. 

 For Charu, the universal design 

 sensibility is what sets a hotel room a cut above from the 

 rest. The design elements have to be liked by every 

 guest, whichever walk of life he or she may come from, 

 she says, explaining the impersonal colour schemes, neutral 

 but pretty wall pictures. 

 The hotels say what makes them 

 is their unmatched housekeeping standards. Cleanliness 

 and 100 per cent hygiene is the biggest thing. Hence the 

 team of micro-biologists testing every aspect of the hotel, 

 says Modhurima Sinha, director of public relations at Taj 

 Bengal.

 Experts say that to design a hotel-like 

 bedroom and an adjoining bathroom would cost about Rs 12 

 lakhs. The average rate per night is around Rs 10,000 plus 

 taxes. Do the math and for those who feel that a five-star 

 home is the better bargain, GoodLife has more.

 Design detail

 Little things go a long way to 

 make a big difference. Like the almost-not there night lamp 

 under the bedside table to guide you through the night, 

 halogens inside the cupboards and a soft, furry rug near 

 the bed to keep your feet warm as you step into a new morning. 

 Charu shares her list, all for that five-star experience. 

 The drapes or curtains 

 are designed in layers. A must is a blackout layer to block 

 the sunrays off. The next is a sheer layer and then finally 

 come the main curtains along with a lining. 

 Rich is the final word 

 when it comes to upholstery. Fabrics used are silks, satins, 

 organzas, tussars, rich cottons and linens. 

 These are mostly solid 

 colours or paisley at the most. The colour story revolves 

 around natural hues like beige, cream and gold. 

 The television always 

 faces the bed. But there is a swivel under the TV to adjust 

 viewing angles. 

 The lighting is all controlled 

 and they each have dimming options to create various moods. 

 The rooms are weatherproof 

 and a comfortable temperature is maintained at all times. 

 Acoustics are in place, 

 false ceilings and sound insulators ensure privacy. 

 The bathrooms boast a 

 larger powder area. 

 Luxury and look score 

 over other practical things like blowing the budget. A never-ending 

 ending quest for storage space is not on the list.

 Bed basics 

 The bed of a hotel room has the 

 power to push the plush meter higher than no other element. 

 Here are some housekeeping hints by Indrani Sanyal, director 

 of housekeeping at The Park. 

 Use special spring mattresses 

 with latex covering that are ergonomically designed to support 

 the spine. 

 Pillows should be ergonomically 

 designed. Contour pillows and feather pillows are better 

 for circulation.

 Use light colour linen 

 for a sense of peace and serenity. Single colours, specially, 

 do not clash with the decor of the room and also adds to 

 the dignity. The downside: high level of maintenance.

 Make the bed crisply. 

 Day beds are opulent with a rich cover and throw cushions, 

 while night beds are a haven of comfort where you can slip 

 into dreams almost immediately. Turn-down or 

 fold over the top of the covers to slip into the bed without 

 much effort.

 Aroma oil, chocolates 

 and bedside flowers are the added attractions that contribute 

 to the serene feel.

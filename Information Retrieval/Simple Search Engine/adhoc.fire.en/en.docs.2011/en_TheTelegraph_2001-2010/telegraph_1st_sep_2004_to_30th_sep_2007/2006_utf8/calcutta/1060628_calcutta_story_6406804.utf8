The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pact path to civic progress 

 - CMC to exit from non-core areas, boost core services

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya embraced partnerships with business groups in his budget speech on Friday.

 Such alliances will boost the financial capability of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), so that it can play ?a pivotal role in the ?Look East? policy of the Centre?, he said.

 ?The budget will enable Calcutta to emerge as a renewed metropolis in the renewed age,? Bhattacharyya added.

 The mayor made a four-point declaration to attract business groups to take part in the urban renewal of the city. According to it:

The civic body will exit from non-core projects

Non-core projects will be handed over to private partners

The CMC?s income will be augmented by forging intelligent partnerships

The civic body?s deployable manpower will be increased with an eye to boost civic 

services in the core areas.

 The mayor also announced that the civic body would join hands with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) for improvement of the transport infrastructure.

 The four projects that the CMC has decided to take up with the CMDA are:

A flyover connecting Parama island, on EM Bypass, with Park Circus bridge no. 

4

A flyover at Ultadanga

A 4.4-km road connecting EM Bypass with Basanti Road

The Vivekananda Road flyover.

 The CMC would join hands with the HRBC to improve tram tracks on MG Road, Bidhan Sarani and College Street.

 The mayor said the civic board is yet to take a decision on a tax on filtered water.

 The budget proposal for 2006-07 stated that the civic body had failed to spend Rs 7 crore of Rs 31.38 crore allotted for slum development in the year 2005-06. For the current year, Rs 41.58 crore has been allotted for slum development.

 ?In the field of slum development, the mayor has failed to come up with any extraordinary improvement proposal, though he established himself as a pro-slum mayor before the civic elections,? said civic Opposition leader Pradip Ghosh, of the Congress. 

 In a departure from the past, the CMC will also clear its dues with the CESC. A sum of Rs 120 crore has been set aside for the purpose.

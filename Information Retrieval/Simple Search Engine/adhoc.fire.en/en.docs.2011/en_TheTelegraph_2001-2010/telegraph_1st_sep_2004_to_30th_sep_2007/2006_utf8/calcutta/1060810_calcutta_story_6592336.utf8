 After three successful seasons, MTV Roadies is vrooming back for its fourth installment that promises to be more dangerous than ever.

 We have had enough foreplay in the first three seasons and now the journey gets really tough, said Ashish Patil, vice-president and general manager, creative and content, MTV India, a day before the Calcutta auditions of Roadies on Thursday. Its not a talent hunt or a beauty pageant or a travel show. Roadies is Indias longest-running reality show and it has grown by 55 per cent every year unlike the other dwitiyas and tritiyas.

 And if what MTV has planned is anything to go by, Roadies 4 is sure going to be a humdinger. After the auditions in five cities Mumbai, Calcutta, Chandigarh, Lucknow and Delhi the race will take off in Kovalam in the south and make its way up through Kerala, Rajasthan, Punjab, New Delhi and the north -east before rounding off in Gangtok.

 The tasks this time range from participating in a Snake Boat Race with an entire village to kushti in a langot in the north to playing Sepak Takraw in the north-east, revealed Ashish. The 13 finalists selected from the auditions will have to take up all these challenges for survival, immunity and money.

 And if you can come out on tops at the end of all that, you not only bag the Roadies crown, win Rs 5 lakh in cash and ride away a Hero Honda Karizma but also become a star on your own right. The winner of the first season of Roadies, Chandigarh boy Ranvijay has not only become an MTV VJ but will also make his Bollywood debut in Vivek Vaswanis Direct Dil Se.

 Roadies is a life-changing experience, said Ranvijay. The stint not only leads to friendships and competitions, it makes a man out of you. After those 40-odd days, you end up more mature, more patient.

But this time, it wont be that easy with twists planned 

at every corner of the race. And if the meaner and badder judges like VJ Nikhil 

and singer Mika dont intimidate you, theres Gulshan Grover waiting to play spoilsport 

at strategic junctions of the trip.

 The Calcutta auditions take place on Thursday at Vidya Mandir, 9.30 am onwards.

Bigger cake, larger slice

AdLib / SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

Why the cola giants have launched two campaigns with 

different hooks but a single motive

This week?s Ad Lib is a sequel to the last 

one. Just to jog your memory, last Sunday we talked about our inability to distinguish 

between cocktail and mocktail. Most advertising that we see on TV is of the ?what 

you see is what you get? variety. Usually they have no hidden agenda. That often 

numbs our senses. Just as well, because then the other rare variety of advertising, 

that has longer-term intentions, finds it easier to do its job quietly and surreptitiously.

There are two such recent campaigns. Not very coincidentally, 

both these are ads from the cola giants. Remember that little drama that is enacted 

in the Coca-Cola ad. Aamir Khan looking distinctly Japanese enters a not-so-fancy 

restaurant. Later it turns out that he is not Japanese, but just an Indian photographer 

bitten by the bee. Some find the drama amusing. Others find it unreal. To both 

the groups, however, the retained dominant memory of this advertisement is the 

theatre in it. The consequent criticism is that people are so obsessed with the 

play that whatever message the ad is trying to communicate is getting lost.

It is important to decode that likely-to-be-missed 

message. At one level it is the usual attempt to associate cola drinks with fun. 

One suspects that there is a far stronger ambition. Drinking of Cola is often 

impulse driven. It is obviously more comfortable for the marketer if the consumption 

could be hooked on to specific occasions and the demand is derived out of a habit. 

The task for Coca-Cola in this ad is to establish the brand as a snacking accompaniment; 

much like the tabla that is played whenever a maestro plays an instrument or an 

Ustad renders a raga. That is what prompts Coke to get the Japanese-looking Aamir 

in its ad to ask for a ?Thanda? with the snacks.

Achieving this end goal is likely to take time. True, 

as feared, people may remember only the drama in the ad. That can actually help 

rather than hinder the task. The retained memory could well act as a slow release 

capsule of the main message. The emission will happen without further trigger 

or expense. Undoubtedly a clever ploy; only time will tell whether it will succeed 

or not.

The other Cola giant Pepsi has the same marketing 

issue ? a potentially unreliable impulse-driven consumption. Their route is different. 

Their format is far more obtuse. There are superstars and there is Pepsi TV. It 

is strenuous to follow the storyline. Presumably when you have seen the ad enough 

number of times some images will stick in your mind. And this is possibly when 

one will start getting the message. You will start wondering whether the ad is 

urging you to drink Pepsi when you watch television. The Shah Rukhs and Kareenas 

are all supporting this mission ? make Pepsi a television-viewing accompaniment.

On the face of it, the cola titans are always at war 

with each other. But are they really competing? They have two distinctly different 

campaigns, very different hooks but a single motive: convert cola consumption 

pattern from impulse to habit. Both needed a carrier. One has chosen snacking 

and the other TV viewing, two of the most popular pastimes. As brand loyalties 

in the Cola market are not fierce, the duo may well have said to each other, ?There 

is no point fighting for brand share; let?s try and enjoy the same slices of a 

bigger cake.?

In the meanwhile, while their pretence continues, 

let us sit back, relax and enjoy the drama that an Aamir or a Shah Rukh delivers, 

relish the spectacle that a Kareena or a Priyanka entertains us with. It comes 

free. There is hardly any point for us to remember that all that glitters is not 

gold, all that fights is not at war.

 Imported cigarettes more harmful

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 There is a common belief that international brands of cigarettes somehow conform to better safety standards than those made locally. In 2003, a Taylor and Francis Health Sciences report, however, suggested that ?American? cigarettes, such as Marlboro, can contain many times more toxins than their Indian counterparts. 

 The report analysed the amount of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) present in cigarettes. It found that US brand cigarettes contain significantly higher levels of TSNA than cigarettes manufactured locally.

 In the case of India, the researchers took 15 packets of Gold Flake and the same number of Marlboros, and analysed the amount of carcinogenic TSNAs in each. The mean readings were .093 micrograms per gram in a standard Gold Flake cigarette, in comparison to 1.1 micrograms per gram in an imported Marlboro full flavour cigarette.

 Dr M. Wali of the Tobacco Harm Reduction Foundation, however, hastens to point out that the findings in the report should not be misinterpreted. ?These figures do not mean that Indian cigarettes are somehow safe. There is simply no such thing as a safe cigarette.?

 Officials of Tobacco Harm Reduction Foundation recently visited the city and are currently trying to establish strong links with like-minded groups in Calcutta. 

 According to the report, many Philip Morris brands, such as Marlboro, that are sold in India are not manufactured in the country. This differs from many other countries, where Philip Morris cigarettes are locally produced.

 Marlboro?s parent company, Philip Morris, has recently been criticised for changing its name to Altria. Critics say the move is an attempt by the company to distance itself from its past.

 The anti-smoking lobbying group Tobacco Free Kids launched an advertising campaign featuring a picture of a snake with the caption: ?No matter how often a snake sheds its skin? It?s still a snake?. Matthew L. Myers, president of the group, explained the motives behind the ad: ?This new ad is designed to be shocking because Philip Morris?s behaviour has been shocking.?

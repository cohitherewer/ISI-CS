 A hit this festive season is Calcutta Police Live, the orchestra of the city force.

 Formed four months ago, the 17-member group comprises trained musicians from the existing band of Calcutta Police the oldest police band in the country and from other wings of the force.

 With 22 live performances, mostly during the Puja, under its belt, the orchestra has turned out to be a major crowd-puller. Even schools are requesting us for programmes by the orchestra at their sports meets. We do send the team, considering the cause, said joint commissioner (armed police) Zulfikar Hasan.

 According to police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, the orchestra has been formed to give a new dimension to the Police Band.

 The 17-member group includes trained guitarists, drummers and three vocalists who can sing in Hindi, Bengali, Nepali and English. We got a tremendous response at a show on Ballygunge Circular Road during the Puja, smiled Prasahnta Tamanag, a singer who joined the Special Action Force, a wing of the city police, in 2002. People were surprised that those who run after criminals can also entertain people.

 Recalling how he came to be drafted into the team, Prasahnta said: I love singing and when the orchestra was formed, I requested my superiors to allow me to be part of it. I had to appear in a test, which I cleared. I am now very happy doing what I do best.

 Guitarist Sudipto Das was an old hand on the instrument when he joined the force as constable. I used to play the guitar at para functions and other programmes. Now, I am delighted to be part of the orchestra, said Das, attached to Shakespeare Sarani thana.

 Percussionist Tanmay Bose, who trained the group, was all praise for the cop-rockers. They are very talented and it was a pleasure working with them. I am looking forward to train them again, he said.

 Talking about the Police Band, the precursor to the orchestra, an officer said that on November 1, 1858, a group of Englishmen were hurriedly mobilised to play at Governors House on the occasion of the transfer of power from the Company Bahadur to the British Crown. Later, these musicians were recruited by the force to form the Police Band.

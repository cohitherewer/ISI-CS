The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A for Ash; B for body

 Global fave: Aishwarya Rai

 She knows how to turn the heads that matter. After bagging prestigious international movies, Aishwarya Rai has now landed in the list of the 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies in the world, as judged by the popular television channel E!. She?s supposedly edged past hot bods like Halle Berry, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears and Madonna.

 The news comes from Rai?s international manager Simone Sheffield, who refused to divulge her exact ranking. But if one does take her word, the former Miss World ?is in the Top 10?. 

 The five-day exclusive series, which promises to ?peel the clothes off the world?s 101 sexiest celebrity bodies on earth?, not only meets the stars but also talks to experts ranging from pop culture commentators to the doyens of fashion and style, including celebrity fitness trainers and co-stars.

 The experts include Italian sex symbol Raoul Bova, Fantastic Four?s Chris Evans, Playboy publishing icon Hugh Hefner, the dashing Sean Maguire, and international sex goddess Raquel Welch.

 Apart from Ash, the others reported to be in the Top 10 include Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, David Beckham and Beyonce Knowles. Watch this space for more information on this hot line-up.

 Now, mrs Jassi: Mona Singh

 Wedding bells

 In a desperate bid to stop the KBC2 juggernaut from riding roughshod over all other telly shows, Jassi was being married off to Armaan ?Sir? in a super hurry. But the rush hour never came as the wedding never happened. Now, after all these episodes, the TV queen has finally married her dream man, in true Malay style.

 ?I am very, very happy that my character is getting to marry finally,? says Mona Singh, still better known as Jassi across the country. ?It?s sad that her parents couldn?t be with her in Malaysia but it?s Raghav who gave her away.?

 Mona is excited with the Malay marriage rituals. ?It?s very different from the Indian style,? she says. ?There?s no pandit sitting or no baraat as such. We were made to sit in huge chairs and then carried around. Raghav played the best man throughout.?

 But doesn?t the marriage also mean the end of the serial? ?Something that starts has to end at some point of time,? says Mona. ?I just want a nice ending to the show so that people miss it once it?s gone off the air.?

 And will Mona be able to forget the character that not only made television history but also changed her life? ?I will always cherish Jassi,? she smiles. ?I am specially attached to my old look. There are many people who miss that old Jassi. When I went to the sets of Deal Ya No Deal in my old get-up, I got a thumping reception from the studio crowd.?

 Even as Mona takes a long ?well-deserved? break for the next couple of months, she has already committed to Page 3 producer Bobby Pushkarna for what will be her first act on the big screen.

 Fun five: The Laughter Champions

 Laughter lines

 With 2005 coming to a close, the next few months will see film awards being given away to the best from the world of movies. First up, on January 11, is the big one ? Hero Honda 12th Annual STAR Screen Awards, to be shown on STAR Plus on January 15 at 7 pm.

 The theme for this year?s awards is Mumbai, to celebrate the huge number of hits that Bollywood scored in 2005. And the show will be hosted by none other than five of the talented finalists from the Laughter Challenge of STAR One. 

 Not just that, the five have been assigned special characters to play ? Navin Prabhakar will be a coolie, Ahsaan Qureshi a traffic hawaldar who wants to become a choreographer, Bhagwant Mann a bhelpuriwala, Raju Shrivastav a Bihari taxi driver and Sunil Pal a black marketeer.

 ?This is a big achievement because this responsibility is beyond just being a host,? says Navin. ?It?s not easy to entertain the country?s top entertainers.? For Raju, it is the huge bevy of stars in the audience that matters the most. ?I am looking forward to performing in front of Bachchan saab, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, since I have learnt so much from them.?

 For STAR, what matters is the comic appeal the five bring to the show. Says Shailja Kejriwal, senior creative director, STAR India: ?It is an event of serious competition, serious glamour and serious speeches. So we thought we would spice it up with a bit of fun and humour to provide a good mix,? she explains.

 Suri in tune

 If 2005 has been one memorable year for anybody in Bollywood, it has to be 25-year-old director Mohit Suri. Mahesh Bhatt?s nephew not only debuted big with the Emraan Hashmi-Udita Goswami-Shamita Shetty-starrer Zeher but also finished the year with another successful film, Kalyug.

 Made at small budgets of Rs 3-4 crore, the sleeper hits also boasted of some fabulous music, mainly from Pakistani talent like the band Jal, singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan and Atif Aslam. Mohit also launched little sister Smiley in Kalyug. Now the young film-maker is set to start another film. It?s most likely to be called Friends, starring Kalyug debutant Kunal Khemu and Bhatt-favourite Hashmi.

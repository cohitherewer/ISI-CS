The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bank tie-up to end queues

 P.K. CHATTERJEE, chief postmaster-general of West Bengal Circle, met readers of The Telegraph in his office on Friday to answer their queries. Participants included Diptimoy Ghosh, Sreekumar Chattopadhay, Arun Ghosh, Koyel Bhattacharya, Md. Amiruzzaman, Sayani Ganguly, Debashish Ghosh and Sunil Agarwal

Sreekumar Chattopadhay: Senior citizens like me have to stand in long queues to collect the monthly interest on our postal savings accounts. Why don?t you computerise the post offices to speed up work?

 There are 200 post offices in the city where you can open a postal savings account under the small savings scheme. While our workload has gone up by 20 per cent in the past few years, the number of employees has gone down due to retirements. We cannot readily fill up the vacancies as there are restrictions on recruitment. We have no option but to cope with the increased workload with fewer hands.

 We are currently engaged in the computerisation of the post offices. The money for that will come in the form of a grant by Planing Commission. I personally feel computerisation will reduce transaction time in the post offices but will not put an end to queues.

Arun Ghosh: What can you do then to provide relief to senior citizens forced to stand in long queues?

 A scheme is on the anvil under which the monthly interest income will be deposited in the bank accounts of the depositors. Instead of visiting the post office to collect the money, they can withdraw it from their banks. We are discussing the matter with Reserve Bank of India and several nationalised banks. To avail of the service, an account-holder will have to fill up a form directing the post office to transfer the monthly interest accrued on the deposit to his bank account.

Koyel Bhattacharya: How long will we have to wait for the computerisation of the post offices? Will all post offices in Calcutta be eventually computerised?

 The computerisation will be done in phases. The first phase will cover 130 post offices in the city. By 2008, all post offices in Calcutta will be computerised. We have a plan to bring 47 important post offices across the state under a wide area network (WAN).

Sreekumar Chattopadhay: You have stated that your department is ready to handle the Speedpost consignments, which are now handled by couriers. But you are also claiming that your department is short-staffed. Please clarify.

 We have two distinct sections ? the mail office section and the post office section. While the post office section is facing a shortage of manpower, the mail section is starved of consignments to handle. We can easily compete with couriers once they are barred from carrying letters below 300 gm in weight. 

Sunil Agarwal: What is the status of the consignment tracking system?

 The tracking system is meant to assure our customers that their consignments are secure in transit. Those who have sent consignments with us must visit the customer-care cells with valid documents to avail of the service. 

Sunil Agarwal: I send a large number of consignments to the Northeast. The packages often do not reach on time. Why?

 We don?t have our own aircraft and hence have to depend on private companies. Sometimes the delay in delivering consignments takes place due to non-availability of space in transport planes. It is not possible for us to figure out beforehand how much space will be available in commercial carriers. The leftover consignments are often kept in the airport in anticipation of the next sortie. After consecutive refusals by airlines, we are forced to take the consignments to Howrah station and send them by train. The delay at the airport slows down the delivery system.

 I admit that there are problems in delivering consignments, even through Speedpost, to the north-eastern states.

Sunil Agarwal: In such cases, your department does not bother to inform the sender about the status of his consignment despite repeated reminders. The customer-care officials are indifferent to our problems. Couriers would never do such a thing.

 Generally, that is not the case. However, if you feel that the customer-care department is not dealing with you properly, register a complaint with me. Your grievance will be addressed at the earliest.

Concluded

 What: Exhibition of designer wear by Rewaz, a brand from Delhi.

 Where: Senator Hotel on Camac Street.

 When: Till February 25, from 10 am to 7 pm.

 Take a look: The exhibition is home to salwar suits, saris and ghagras in pure georgettes and crepes. From sober citrines and off-whites to electric splashes of pink and blue, the colour scheme is rich.

 The collection in floral and abstract patterns comes embellished with mukesh, gota, sequins and a host of other embroideries. 

 The salwar suit section is an array of pretty formals and semi-formal outfits. The dupattas with long thread extensions further accentuate the look. Some suits come along with belts. The suits in cotton seem perfect to beat the heat. 

 The ghagras are heavily embroidered and come with contrasting cholis.

 In the sari corner the double sari catches your attention. While one drapes the body, the pallu is a separate piece altogether. Some net and georgette saris also come with printed petticoat. 

 Pocket pinch: The salwar suits are priced at Rs 2,500-plus. Saris begin at Rs 3,000 and the price tags for ghagras read Rs 9,500 and more. 

 Voiceover: We have gone the traditional way, but the collection is innovative and trendy, says Rachna Agarwal, one of the hosts for the event.

 Interior ideas

 What: Home Decor 2006.

 Where: Ice Skating Rink.

 When: Till February 27, 11 am to 8 pm.

 Take a look: About 25 participants have come forward to liven up this exhibition organised by Fair Centre. The products range from home decor pieces to assembled lines of furniture.

 Modular kitchens, wooden furniture (both contemporary and antique), wrought iron ware, designer bed linens, plastic goods, metallic prints laminated on glass or canvas and functional sofa-cum-beds are some of the things on offer. 

 Pocket pinch: While the prints begin at Rs 750 and go up to Rs 5,000, the designer linens with cushion covers are tagged at Rs 1,650 and above. Modern furniture at Mirage is available from Rs 9,000 onwards while the more expensive variety comes for Rs 90,000. 

 The fibreglass range of furniture begins at Rs 8,500 and the home products come for Rs 1,200-plus. 

 Voiceover: Most of our participants are either manufacturers or direct importers. A platform like this is great exposure for them as well as the customers who get so much variety under one roof, says Hari Prapan Tharad of Fair Centre.

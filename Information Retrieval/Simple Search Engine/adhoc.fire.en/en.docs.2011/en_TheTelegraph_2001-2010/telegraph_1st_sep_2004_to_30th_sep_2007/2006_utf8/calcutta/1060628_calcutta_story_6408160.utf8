 Fear of cancer costs led to death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 It was not only the fear of cancer that prompted Nemai Chandra Dey to kill himself on Monday. He was also pushed by the thought of huge treatment costs. 

 Family members said 72-year-old Dey, who jumped off the 17th floor of Tata Centre, was driven to his death by another death ? of his son-in-law. 

 ?The death of his son-in-law from cancer in 2004 was fresh in his mind. He couldn?t get over the fact that his family spent about Rs 8 lakh on treatment, yet the patient couldn?t be saved,? said Keya Nandi, daughter-in-law of Dey?s brother. 

 She said that when Dey was diagnosed with a tumour in the pancreas, he presumed it was cancerous even before that was confirmed by medical reports. 

 ?He always talked about a pain and burning sensation in his abdomen. Even though no biopsy was done, he felt the tumour was cancerous. The doctors at SSKM Hospital advised tests, but he did not want to go,? Keya said. 

 Dey was supposed to visit the hospital on Monday and left his Howrah home early. It was only late in the afternoon, when he didn?t turn up, that the family started to worry. 

 A practitioner of homoeopathy, Dey was also a staunch believer in astrology. The day before he committed suicide, he told his elder brother Gour Mohan Dey that his days were numbered. 

 ?On Sunday evening, he came to my room and spoke for long. He told me that his life would come to an end within July this year. I did not realise that he was dropping hints,? Gour Mohan said.

 Tata Centre has tightened security after the incident. ?No one is allowed to enter the premises without a proper check-up,? said an official. 

 ?We are working on how he obtained the slip that is necessary to enter the building,? said deputy commissioner of police (south) Ajay Kumar. 

 Police were probing if Dey used a false name.

 Calcutta Column

 I am a customer of ICICI Bank, Ballygunge branch. Some time ago, I had dropped a cheque in the drop-box at the bank?s ATM on Circus Avenue. When even after three days my account was not updated, I visited the bank to inquire about it. I was simply told that the bank had not received any such cheque. I had to instruct my company to make a stop-payment for the amount, which was quite embarrassing. I once again requested the bank to look into the matter. Three days later, the officials verbally informed me that the cheque was not found. A friend of mine had faced similar problems after dropping a cheque in the drop-box of her bank?s ATM. This seems to be a common problem in many reputed banks. Has ICICI taken any precaution to ensure that such incidents do not occur frequently? 

 Payal Chhabria,

 Karaya Road. 

 Our bank has a foolproof system under which the cheques in the drop-box are counted and sorted by two bank officials. Then they are sent for processing. The system is in conformity with Reserve Bank of India guidelines. Hence, cases of cheques going missing are very rare. And even if a cheque does go missing, all that?s needed to be done is give the name, account number and cheque details to the bank. If we find that the customer?s grievance is genuine, we usually do not take more than three to four working days to credit his/her account. Any customer can approach us and lodge a complaint if these rules are not followed by the respective branch officials. 

 Supriya Nayar, 

 regional manager, branch banking, ICICI.

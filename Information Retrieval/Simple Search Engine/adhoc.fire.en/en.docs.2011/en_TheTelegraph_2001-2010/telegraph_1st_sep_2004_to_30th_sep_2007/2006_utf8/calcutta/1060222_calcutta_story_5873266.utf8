 Today?s question: Should sale of products other than books be allowed at the Book Fair?

 State of art: Figurines on sale on the Book Fair grounds

 Anuka Banerjee,

 Ariadaha

 As the name suggests, the Book Fair is meant to be exclusively about books. However, sale of other products should be allowed on the fairground since the other fairs are not as popular as the Book Fair. A corner of it can be devoted to art and food, provided the atmosphere of the fair is not tarnished in the process.

Sujata, 

 Howrah

 Only books should be sold at the Book Fair. It does not make any sense to allow stalls of other products to be set up at the venue.

 Chandan Ray, 

 Sakuntala Park

 There is a need to make the Book Fair more organised. Food and snacks stalls can be allowed in a separate enclosure. Sale of CDs and electronic products can also be allowed. Without provision for refreshment, visitors from outside the city would find it difficult to spend 6-7 hours at the fair. Fire safety measures and steps to reduce dust are also a must.

 Naren Sen,

 Ramrajatola 

 Sale of products other than books at the Book Fair is most welcome. But the sale of objectionable material should not be allowed. Visitors from the districts would stop visiting the fair if there aren?t enough food stalls at the venue. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra, 

 Beleghata

 Food and beverage outlets and stalls of old books and newspapers must be allowed at the Book Fair.

 Anuradha Kundu,

 College Street

 Books draw enough people to the Book Fair. It is not necessary to sell other products there.

 Pijus Kanti Sarkar,

 Narendrapur

 The Book Fair is gradually turning into a food fair. There are many who turn up only to eat. Their presence is an insult to book-lovers.

Santosh Chakravarty,

 Unique Park

 There should be a refreshment corner at the Book Fair, segregated from the book stalls. This is necessary to prevent fire and pollution. The food stalls are necessary for visitors from the districts, but the owners should ensure that the fairground is not dirtied. Sale of electronic goods, cosmetics and ceramics should not be allowed at the fair. 

Bratini,

 Behala 

 Sale of products other than books should not be allowed at the Book Fair since that would disturb the concentration of the book-lovers. If book stalls are not set up in the other fairs, why should stalls of other products be allowed at the Book Fair? Even food and beverage stalls should not be set up.

 Purnima Mukhopadhyay, 

 Entally

 The sale of products other than books should continue at the Book Fair. People who visit the fair to buy books also need to eat and refresh themselves, for which food and beverage stalls are a must. Items related with books such stationery can also be sold at the Book Fair. Children will be more interested to visit the fair if there are stalls of candy and popcorn. Seminars can also be held to make the fair interesting.

 Dinabandhu Mukherjee,

 Behala

 No. Otherwise, the words Book Fair would become meaningless. Stalls of other products will divert the attention of the visitors, especially children. The purchasing power being limited, some visitors might not even have money left to buy books. Only stationery and food stalls might be allowed.

Chirag Tulsiani,

 Suresh Sarkar Road

 Stalls selling refreshment must be set up on the fairground, because people get hungry after browsing and buying books for hours. Also, what?s wrong with shopping for other things along with books?

A.K. Mitra,

 Puddapukur Road

 It is impossible to browse only books for more than two hours. Therefore, sale of other products at the Book Fair must be allowed.

 Anirban Rudra,

 Address not given

 The necessity of refreshment cannot be ignored, hence food and beverage stalls should remain at the fair.

 Basant Kumar Choudhary,

 Kankinara

 Sale of other products can be allowed in a separate enclosure at the Book Fair.

 A.F. Kamruddin Ahmed,

 Bandpur, Hooghly

 A fair without food and fun will lose its charm. Food, stationery and electronics goods can certainly be sold at the Book Fair. But the number of other stalls should be restricted.

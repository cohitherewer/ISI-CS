 Songs sung true

 A new-age rock band is how they 

 define themselves, but 21 Grams (picture on left) 

 seems to hit the reinvention route with every new project. 

 Backed by Planman Motion Pictures, the band will formally 

 be launched on stage by the end of this year, followed by 

 live concerts around the country.

 But for now, the band is in screen, rather than stage, mode. After the minimalist score for Rituparno Ghoshs Dosar, the seven-member team is busy designing the songs and background score for Rituparnos Sunglass.

 Raja on keyboards, Nitin on bass, Sanjoy on drums, Rajiv on vocals, Humtu on the flute, Rohan and Dabbu on guitar are also gearing up for a music video, in association with HMV, that has been conceptualised and will be directed by Rituparno. Although we call ourselves a rock band we do not restrict ourselves to a particular genre, says Sanjoy.

 The theme of Ekla Chalo Re is an individual signifying mans struggle against contemporary social odds. Our main purpose is to popularise this song as an anthem with national significance. The tracks are ready with a blend of Tagores music and new-age sounds, says Raja.

 The music is inspirational, it has marching beats but does not get aggressive. The song starts off with a verse of Vaishnava Janato and fades out as the verses of Ekla Chalo Re settle in. The song is interspersed with excerpts from Tagores Where the mind is without fear in a narrative form, says Sanjoy.

 The band is all set to rope in Shankar Mahadevan, Shaan, Shubha Mudgal, Sunidhi Chauhan, Bhupen Hazarika, Jagjit Singh, Kailash Kher and Usha Uthup to lend their voices, while the video will feature several screen stars. Rabindrasangeet veteran Suchitra Mitra is slated to make a special appearance.

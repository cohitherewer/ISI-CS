 He travels from Planetree, on the Isle of Arran, to Edinburgh every now and then for his periodic radiotherapy sessions to treat prostrate cancer. This time, Reverend John Webster has journeyed a touch further, from King?s Cross all the way to Calcutta, with his bicycle dismantled and packed neatly in his travel case.

 On Saturday morning, the sprightly 72-year-old joined an eight-member group of robust Scots on a cycling expedition from Calcutta to Kalimpong to raise funds for Dr. Graham?s Homes, the ?children?s village? founded in 1900 by Scottish missionary John Anderson Graham.

 The group, mostly from in or around Edinburgh and connected through a common rage for rugby, hopes to cover the 700-km trail in seven days, climbing to a height of 5,500 ft into the foothills of the Himalayas. The aim is to raise ?20,000 from the charity bike ride and other allied events linked to it.

 ?I?ll never be able to climb Mount Everest or row across the Atlantic. So, whatever little difference I can make through this cycling trip, is worth the effort,? John told Metro on the eve of the flag-off. Having spent nine years at the Homes as chaplain, he has raised over ?100,000 for it in recent years by running marathons.

 If the Reverend was the inspiration, his son Johnnie Webster, an architect, has been the prime instigator, rallying together friends who can relate to the Homes? cause. He himself recently completed a 1,700-mile solo cycle expedition around the Scottish coast to raise money for the Kalimpong school.

 ?Back in Edinburgh, we also did the Robert Burns night on January 25 (to mark the poet?s birth anniversary) and also a Racing Night, both with Bollywood themes, raising ?2,000 from each of those evenings,? Johnnie declared, with a glint in his intense eyes.

 The trip symbolises the ?contrast of the poverty and squalor of sections of inner-city Calcutta with the tranquil surroundings offered by the Homes in Kalimpong?, stressed Alasdair Soutar, member of the Homes UK committee, a registered Scottish charity, which raises substantial funds for the school every year.

 It?s a motley milieu pushing pedals out there. If Alasdair, Lindsay Hampton and Jeremy Fraser are solicitors, Lee Clifford is a passionate photographer who would like to ?climb an 8,000-ft-plus peak in the Himalayas?. Angus Reid is a film-maker, Kevin Hamilton a company director and Ewan McCarthy a designer, who, as an experienced cyclist, is sure to wear the ?yellow jersey? for most of the trip.

 ?All these guys have paid for their own fare and most of them being self-employed, stand to lose a fortnight?s wages for taking this trip. I?m really proud of this bunch, and flattered they have allowed me to bike with them,? smiled Reverend Webster, former chairman of the Homes UK committee.

 In fond remembrance

 The first to dance in accompaniment with the rhythms of Tagores lyrical and romantic poetry, Srimati Tagore had popularised this style of dance, which nearly died a natural death after her own demise. Her dance, in tune with the lines of Jhulan, was recited by none other than Tagore himself. A versatile dancer, she gave new dimension to many of Tagores evergreen compositions in verse. Baitanik remembers her on her 104th birth anniversary with music and dance performances. Prasanta Kumar Mitra, Kamal Kumar Basu, Amit Das and Shaktipada Mukhopadhyay will pay tribute to Srimati Tagore by discussing various aspects of her multi-faceted life and personality. Uma Mukhopadhyay and artistes of Baitanik will render Tagore songs while Aditi Singha and Souryadipta will perform dance numbers to the accompaniment of Tagore songs.

 - PROTESTS MET WITH THREATS

 Sankar Ghosh and his family have almost lost their right of way to a string of illegal shops that have come up in front of the entrance to their house on Bondel Road, on a plot that was once theirs. Their protests have only earned them threats and insults.

 ?I had protested when the structures ? eateries, electrical goods and motor spares stores and a huge haystack ? came up in August last year. But a 500-strong mob threatened me with dire consequences if I dared to complain against the shops,? said Sankar.

 He had approached local CPM legislator and Left Front chief whip in the Assembly Rabin Deb, who promised to look into the matter. But things have not changed a bit since then.

 Deb, contesting from the Ballygunge constituency in the coming polls, argued that nothing could be done now, as the election dates have been announced. ?I know the family has suffered a lot. Everything will be sorted out once the elections are over,? he claimed.

 The house where the Ghosh family lives was built more than 60 years ago by Sankar?s father Sailendra Nath, who died in 1985. The three-cottah plot on which the illegal shops now stand was bought by the Calcutta Corporation from Sailendra Nath in 1943, for aligning Bondel Road. 

 Since then, the plot had been lying vacant. But only till August 2005. ?The situation has made our lives miserable.We are living like aliens in our own land. My wife lives in constant fear when I go abroad,? said Sankar, who works in a private organisation. His wife is headmistress of a city school.

 Sankar is also a stage actor and has to go abroad often for theatrical performances. ?My friends from Europe used to visit my house, but now I feel scared to invite them,? he said.

 Even his daughter and granddaughter have stopped visiting the place fearing trouble.

 What is more shocking, he pointed out, is that the civic authorities are supplying free drinking water to the shops. ?We have lodged repeated complaints with the municipal authorities, but in vain. Moreover, our share of water has been gradually decreasing and the authorities have refused to act on our requests to boost supply,? he added. 

 Mohan Lal Gupta, who runs two illegal eateries on the plot, and Sankar Lal Gupta, who owns an electrical goods shop, are quite blas? about the violation.

 ?What else could we have done? Our shops were on the other side of the road. The local leaders asked us to shift to this plot when the construction of the flyover started. They had also assured us that till we got permanent accommodation, we would not have to pay rent and would get drinking water free,? said one of the shopkeepers.

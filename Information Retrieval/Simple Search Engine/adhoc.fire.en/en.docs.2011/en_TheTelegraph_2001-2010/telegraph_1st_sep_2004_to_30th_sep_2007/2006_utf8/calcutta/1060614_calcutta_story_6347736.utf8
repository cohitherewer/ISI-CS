 Focus on research policy

 - Flush with funds, varsity eyes modern topics for study plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Flush with funds over the past few months, Calcutta University is gearing up to prepare a ?comprehensive research policy?, a first for the 150-year-old institution.

 Officials said the policy would identify key research areas and ensure that funds earmarked for innovations are utilised properly.

 ?The proposal for framing a comprehensive research policy is under the university?s consideration. Officials of the departments concerned have been working on it. All factors will be taken into account before the policy is finalised,? said registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.

 The scope for advanced research in the university has increased considerably following the allocation of more than Rs 150 crore by the Centre and the state government. 

 In the Union budget 2006, finance minister P. Chidambaram had allotted Rs 100 crore to mark the 150th anniversary of Calcutta University. Besides, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has sanctioned Rs 30 crore and the state government Rs 11 crore.

 The UGC grant followed a declaration of the university as a ?centre of excellence?. 

 The bulk of the funds, said a senior university official, is for research. A large number of research projects is taken up every year, but topics relevant to modern times, such as environment science and women empowerment, continue to be neglected. 

 ?The proposed policy will give us a clear picture of the areas in which research will be undertaken in the next 10 to 15 years,? said an official.

 ?Advanced research in biological sciences has become indispensable these days,? said Gouranga Dandpath, a spokesman for the Calcutta University Research Scholars? Association. ?The university needs to emphasise on research in this field in the next few years.?

 Biotechnology, nano-technology, environmental science, international relations, sociology and economics are some other areas the university intends turning the focus on.

 ?It?s time the authorities framed a well-considered research policy so that the projects end up bettering the lives of the ordinary people,? said an official involved in the process.

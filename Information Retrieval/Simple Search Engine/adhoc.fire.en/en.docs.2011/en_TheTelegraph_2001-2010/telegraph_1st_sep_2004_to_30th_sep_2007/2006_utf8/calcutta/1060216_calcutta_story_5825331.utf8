 Surgery, vision for the poor 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Durgapada Bose, 85, of Konnagar, 

 almost lost his vision to cataract as he couldn?t afford 

 to visit a surgeon. Phulrenu Devi, 75, who lives in a slum 

 on Garcha Road, suffered a similar fate.

 Bose, Phulrenu and many others 

 like them ? all aged and poor ? have regained their eyesight, 

 thanks to the Dr Nihar Munshi Eye Foundation.

 The city-based foundation, in association with several voluntary organisations, is on a mission to identify poor cataract patients and perform microsurgeries to restore their eyesight. Since 1998, more than 6,000 patients from the city, North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly have benefited from the endeavour under the Foundation?s Community Ophthalmology Project.

 ?Instead of conducting general eye check-up camps, we organise cataract detection camps as the disorder is common amongst the elderly of the city,? said P.K. Munshi, managing trustee of the Foundation. The organisation claims to treat more than 2,000 cataract patients every year.

 Surveys have revealed that 80 per cent of the population develops cataract beyond age 65. ?Eighty per cent cannot afford microsurgery. We try to treat them free,? added Munshi.

 A fund has been created for the purpose. The money is raised by treating more affluent patients and through donations by welfare societies and business houses.

 The Foundation?s ophthalmologists teach volunteers of other organisations how to detect cataract. They are then asked to visit households in their areas of operation and identify patients. 

 At the cataract detection camps, 

 surgeons check the patients before they are operated on 

 at the foundation?s Dover Place address. The patients need 

 to admit themselves for two days. Garcha Gurdwara, which 

 is nearby, provides space for the patients to stay. They 

 are treated in batches of 20 to 25. 

 The foundation has also taken 

 up a project to upgrade its facilities at an estimated cost 

 of Rs 50 lakh.

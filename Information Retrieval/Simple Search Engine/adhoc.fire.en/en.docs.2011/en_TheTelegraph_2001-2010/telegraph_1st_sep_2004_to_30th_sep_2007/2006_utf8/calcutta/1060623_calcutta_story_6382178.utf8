 Cruise crumbles: 

 The Rajarhat expressway across time 

 Apropos the report ?Numbers swell 

 in quota strike?, May 20, during my 30 years of service, 

 only one person was recruited to our department under the 

 scheduled caste quota. Despite being a postgraduate degree 

 holder of Calcutta University, he suffered a great deal 

 of humiliation at the workplace. 

 Every time officials from our personnel department tried to obtain data on the scheduled caste employees, he initially tried to suppress the fact that he was one but later provided the required information. This psychological problem was engendered by the quota system. 

 Reservation creates inferiority complex among those who benefit from it. Those who do not, either hate the people selected under quota or treat them as inferiors. 

 The quota system is only a political stunt. There should not be any quota for any section of people. Everyone should have to earn their position in society. 

 I know from experience that the quota system diffuses the urge for uplift and improvement. The desire to upgrade oneself should come from within. The imposition of reservation is like creating a back door for people, without sufficient ability, to slip through. 

 I belong to an OBC. I have done a Ph.D and got three promotions in my working life. Today I walk with my head held high because what I have achieved, I have achieved without government help in the form of quota. 

 P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur Avenue. 

 Apropos the report ?Scarred showpiece?, May 16, it is disheartening that the 11-km Rajarhat Expressway, the chief minister?s fast track to progress, is already dotted with craters. The prized path, inaugurated as recently as May 2004, needed to be maintained properly. Instead, it only got sarkari neglect. No amount of encouraging statistics are going to persuade prospective investors to focus on the state if they have to endure a bumpy ride from the airport to the city. 

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road. 

 Being a resident of east Calcutta, 

 I have to often face the perils that a broken road can bring 

 into one?s life. The state government should have considered 

 that the Rajarhat road was being built on soft soil. Even 

 after the road was constructed, the government did not look 

 after it properly. 

 Joyeeta Dey, 

 Teghoria. 

 The photograph entitled ?Happy Mother?s Day?, May 15, was heartwarming. Many human mothers consign their newborns to the footpath or dustbin. They should learn a lesson from the primates. 

 Prahlad Agarwala,

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 The report ?Triple cry of torture rings in court?, May 19, paints a grim picture of a consumerist society. Sons and daughters are interested in inheriting property but not in looking after their parents. The society and the government, too, are hardly bothered. Individual initiatives seem the only way out. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata.

 The report was a portrait of the 

 condition of a large number of aged, helpless people. They 

 bring up their children enduring hardships, only to be denied 

 love and warmth in old age. Those who behave badly with 

 their aged parents should remember that they, too, would 

 suffer the same fate. 

 Anirban Rudra, 

 Behala.

 It is unfortunate that aged people 

 are being tormented by their sons and daughters-in-law. 

 Police apathy in this regard is contemptible. The old people 

 who do not possess property are especially vulnerable to 

 abuse. They are often treated with scorn and ultimately 

 abandoned. The government should give old people legal protection. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder, 

 Behala. 

 Apropos the report ?Free roads or court trouble?, May 20, I had expected the high court to play a vital role in resolving the hawker problem. But the politicians and policemen, who benefit from the trade, are making it difficult to thrash out a solution. 

 Sukumar Ghosh, 

 Mukundapur. 

 Apropos the report ?High praise for Presidency?, May 22, the ?temples of higher education? must be kept in top condition. We are delighted to know that the National Assessment and Accreditation Council has given the highest rating to Presidency College. 

 B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum. 

 Apropos the report ?LPG vehicle tested for CNG fumes?, May 15, I did not imply that the workers of Lake Auto Service are untrained or had made a mistake in selecting the right fuel for emission tests. 

 Aniruddha Poddar,

 Raja Rammohan Sarani.

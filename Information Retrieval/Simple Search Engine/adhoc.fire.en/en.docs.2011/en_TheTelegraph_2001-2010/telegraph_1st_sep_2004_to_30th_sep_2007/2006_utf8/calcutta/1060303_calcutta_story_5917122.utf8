The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 After Germans, Italian teams due on biz trip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Overseas business delegations are clearly the flavour of the month.

 Shortly after the 45-member German biz team leaves town following its whirlwind recce this Friday, two Italian groups will touch down in Calcutta next week to explore opportunities for trade ties.

 A four-member food processing squad, facilitated by the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IICCI), will be in town on March 8 and 9, reciprocating the visit last year of a state team led by food processing minister Sailen Sarkar to Forli Cesena, the hub of the Italian agro-business industry.

 Besides representatives from the Mediterranean Fruit Company, Sorma SpA and the Cermac Consortium, the Italian team will also have a member from the Forli Cesena Chamber of Commerce.

 ?This visit could be the starting point for very significant food-processing and agro-business tie-ups with Bengal, and representation from the Forli chamber only adds to the import of the recce, quot; Italian consul-general in Calcutta Agostino Pinna tells Metro.

 Pinna stresses that last year?s trip to Italy by the Bengal team had left a favourable impression and the Italian team should be able to carry the thread forward.

 ?They are quite aware of the core strengths of Calcutta and Bengal through the presentations done by Sarkar and his team and would be looking to engage in structured dialogue on opportunities for joint ventures or technology transfer, quot; the consul-general says.

 The Mediterranean Fruit Company is a service society of 27 Italian companies, exporting technology and packaging and importing fresh fruits and vegetables. Sorma SpA, a 150 million-Euro group company headquartered in Cesena also has a division for packing material, sorting equipment and industry machines.

 Cermac is a producers? group of agricultural machinery, devices and systems for irrigation and gardening, of analysis and control implements for agriculture and also fertilisers and generators. The consortium proposes ?without profit, to increase and consolidate presence of the partner enterprises in foreign markets through achievement of promotional activities?.

 Besides the food team, the Promos-Milan Chamber of Commerce, in collaboration with IICCI, will bring a business delegation to visit Calcutta on March 9 and 10. The group, focused on chemicals, will be looking for local partners who are importers, distributors, end-users, producers, indenting agents, etc.

 ?We will organise one-to-one talks between the Italian team and Indian companies,? says Jyoti Saha, regional manager of the chamber. Calcutta had hosted a tourism delegation as part of the Festa Italia celebrations last November.

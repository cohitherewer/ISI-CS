 College autonomy to miss session

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Presidency College will not get autonomous status from the current academic session.

 The process of admission of students to undergraduate courses in the college is nearing completion and the new academic session is slated to begin in July. But the high-powered committee, set up by the government in May to examine the proposal on granting autonomy to state-controlled Presidency College, is yet to start functioning. 

 Consisting of five members, the committee has not held its first meeting yet.

 There is no possibility of granting autonomy to the college this year, as the government will not be able to finalise its decision on the matter within the short time left for the new session. 

 The government will be able to do so only after receiving the committee?s report.

 ?I cannot comment on the issue of granting autonomy to Presidency College at this stage. I will be in a position to say whether the college will be granted autonomy or not only after getting the report of the committee,? said Sudarshan Roy Choudhury, state higher education minister.

 The minister?s statement is significant as the chief minister had announced in the Assembly in February that his government was initiating measures to grant autonomous status to Presidency College as soon as possible, preferably within the current academic session.

 Bhattacharjee?s statement at that time, confirming that his government had full support on the issue, was significant because only a day earlier, then higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty had announced in the Assembly that the college would not seek autonomy immediately. 

 Chakraborty had made it clear in the Assembly that some teachers in the West Bengal College and University Teachers? Association were against an autonomous Presidency College.

 The government?s procrastination appears significant as a large section of teachers, leaders of the CPM-controlled Government College Teachers? Association and West Bengal College and University Teachers? Association, has stuck to its stand that Presidency should not be given full autonomy.

 Green case delay flayed

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Environment activist Subhas Dutta, in a letter to Chief Justice V. S. Sirpurkar, on Tuesday alleged that the court was not paying enough heed to cases related to public interest.

 Dutta said hearings of at least eight important cases, like eviction of hawkers, rash driving by private buses, entry of heavy vehicles into the city during night and traffic regulation violations, have not been heard by the high court in the past several months. 

 Annexing a copy of a 1997 Supreme Court judgment with the letter, Dutta pointed out that the green bench of Calcutta High Court had been constituted on the basis of an apex court directive. 

 ?The Supreme Court had asked the high court to set up a special bench for hearing environment matters. The order has also given me the liberty to move to the apex court, whenever I feel discomforted by the activities of the high court,? he stated.

 Dutta threatened the high court administration that further delay of these cases would prompt him to knock the door of the apex court. ?I will organise mock courts to hear these cases at Rani Rashmoni Road, if they don?t come up for hearing soon,? he said.

 Fleeting moments of truth

 - ARRESTING BODY OF PHOTOGRAPHIC WORK ON WAY OF LIFE IN THE CITY

 SOUMITRA DAS

 One of the photographs of Sumit Basu on exhibition at Birla Academy

 It may be a folly to compare photographs with paintings but some of Sumit Basu?s best black-and-white photographs, being exhibited at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, closely resemble the latter. In one, the busts of national leaders stare blankly, like silent observers, from a verandah screened with mesh. 

 In another, the feet of a deity are delineated above a signboard depicting Kali as Krishna. Inhabiting a space between reality and unreality, they could easily be the works of a contemporary Indian artist.

 Basu is a chartered accountant by profession and photography is a passion he pursues in spite of his busy schedule. The ones being exhibited were taken over the last decade, and include works that demanded an instant reaction on the part of the photographer to a certain situation that would change in a split second.

 On of the best of these is that of a bikriwala walking across the apex of a triangle of light on a city street. Another shows the tail-end of a bicycle zipping across the lines of a zebra crossing, meeting the railing of pavement at the certain point. Basu, no doubt, had to click at what to him was the moment of truth. 

 There are some other works that lack the spontaneity of these two. For example, the one of the policemen under the claw-like shadow of a lamppost looks quite contrived.

 Quite in keeping with the title of the exhibition, Townscape Landscape, Basu?s compositions, as a whole, present an arresting body of work on the way life in the city, like life in more picturesque locales, can be of interest to a photographer even in their details.

 Some compositions are particularly beautiful, like the shadow of a spray of grass on the stone wall, a tree wearing a halo of leaves in a field, iron beams from the Metro Rail site dumped on the Maidan and a flower bed. The tones of grey in these prints he had done himself are subtle and soft. He has avoided striking contrasts.

 One composition of the wooden surface of a door with its knob could not but be a photograph. In dark grey and black, with a strip of white separating the two vertical planes, it is a study in minimalism.

 The colour bromides look a bit jarring amidst this world of muted greys. But it would be difficult to imagine some of the photographs, such as the chappals displayed against a blue backdrop, and the one of step-farming in anything else but colour.

 Illumination at utility 

 point: Howrah station, a heritage structure

 The report Rs 21.75 teacher too 

 poor to move apex court, August 7, highlights the apathy 

 of the education department in carrying out court orders. 

 It also underscores the tardiness of our judicial system, 

 as according to the report, a contempt petition filed earlier 

 in the year by the teacher is yet to be heard. 

 The report makes it clear how disrespectful a government department can be towards the court over a prolonged period without being punished. Almost all the departments of the state government can be charged with contempt of court. 

 The harassment of primary school teacher Pranab Kumar Sengupta at the hands of the officials of the education department is only one of many such cases. Many pensioners or their family members have been forced to file contempt petitions after court orders in their favour were blatantly ignored by the departments of the West Bengal government. What is horrifying is that the number of such cases is swelling everyday. 

 The demand for a bribe of Rs 60,000 from the primary school teacher by an employee of the education department for releasing his dues is not surprising at all. Unfortunately, those who approach the court for recourse, end up suffering more. 

 To address the problem, there should be strict vigilance in every government office. Besides, the judiciary should clear the backlog of court cases as quickly as possible.

 Apropos the report Light-up time for landmarks, August 5, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas move to illuminate heritage buildings, starting with GPO, the civic headquarters, Writers Buildings and other offices, by spending crores is welcome. Though CESC has agreed to provide power for the project at a subsidised rate, the mayor needs to first come up with a plan to repair the edifices. With the city being submerged after every sharp shower and roads riddled with potholes, Bhattacharyya, perhaps, should be more concerned about addressing the grievances of the common people instead of thinking up grand gestures.

 We are used to Victoria Memorial 

 remaining dark at night. Before hatching grand plans 

 of illuminating landmarks, the mayor should first ensure 

 they are better maintained.

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi deserves kudos for trying to preserve the colonial heritage of the towns on the banks of the Hooghly (Focus on colonial legacy, August 7). The colonial powers exploited the local population for economic gains, but can one forget their rich contribution in the fields of education, science, technology and architecture? It will be a sin to consign the likes of William Carey to oblivion. Preservation of colonial legacy will not only enlighten future generations, but will also provide a boost to tourism.

 Apropos the report House rules ready for New Town, August 4, the reports on the townships planning and development have borne only false hopes. The plot-owners in New Town have been made to cool their heels so far.

 One Mukherjee did what another Mukherjee could not (How the club was won, August 4)! Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee lost the Cricket Association of Bengal presidency, but uro surgeon Dipak Mukherjee was elected the Calcutta Club president. 

 In both elections, the Ganguly family of Barisha was the loser. Debidas Ganguly, whom Dipak Mukherjee defeated, is the uncle of ousted India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly. Democracy is welcome, but not the bitterness is generates. As a senior citizen, I hope both bodies are run satisfactorily.

 Apropos the report Liquor link in drowning, August , it is shocking that two young picnickers lost their life while bathing in a pond. Given that numerous students die every year by drowning, educational institutions, humanitarian organisations and clubs should provide free swimming lessons to teenagers.

 Apropos the report Drama of motion and musculature, August 10, I think Kamala Roy Choudhury, one of the founder members of Society of Contemporary Artists, was mistakenly referred to as Kamal Roy Choudhury. Born in erstwhile East Bengal, Kamala Roy Choudhury was trained in painting at Paris and London in the 1940s. She came back to Calcutta just before Independence and was a faculty at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture. I am her family member.

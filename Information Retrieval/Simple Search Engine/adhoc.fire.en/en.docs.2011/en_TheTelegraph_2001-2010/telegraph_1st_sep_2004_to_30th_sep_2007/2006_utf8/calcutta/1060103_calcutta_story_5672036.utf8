 Fire havoc in crores 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Teak wood worth over Rs 2 crore was destroyed in a fire that gutted 32 warehouse-cum-shops in Nimtala early on Monday. The seven families trapped in the blaze were rescued.

 Thirty-eight fire tenders took about eight hours to douse the flames. About 20,000 sq ft of a timber market was destroyed in the fire.

 It was the third blaze in the market in the past 40 years.

 Forensic experts have collected samples of the debris to determine the cause of the blaze. Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee visited the site, along with local member of Parliament Sudhanshu Sil and local councillor Ajay Saha.

 ?The fire would not have been so devastating had the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) allowed the warehouse-owners to raise brick walls between their properties,? complained local timber merchant Bhajan Malik. 

 The timber market extends on either side of Strand Road. According to Malik, while the land on the west belongs to the CPT, the warehouses on the east stand on thika land. 

 Both the CPT and the controller of thika tenancy don?t allow the traders to construct pucca walls.

 Divisional officer of West Bengal Fire Services Dipak Sarkar said non-availability of water had made fire-fighting difficult. The firemen initially had to fetch water from the Mullickghat pumping station, about two km away. A pump was later installed on the Hooghly bank.

 The Calcutta Timber Merchants? Association, a body of about 500 traders, convened an emergency meeting to review the rehabilitation of the affected merchants, most of whom hadn?t insured their stocks.

 ?We have already taken on the responsibility of feeding the seven families that have lost everything in the fire,? said secretary of the association Amal Sarkar.

 The total loss is not less than Rs 3 crore, he added. 

 Over the weekend, about 50 truckloads of teak wood had been brought to the market. A truckload of teak costs about Rs 10 lakh.

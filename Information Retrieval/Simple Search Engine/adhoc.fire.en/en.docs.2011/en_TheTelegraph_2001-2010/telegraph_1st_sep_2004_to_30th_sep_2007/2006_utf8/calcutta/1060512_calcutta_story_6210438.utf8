 Exploring the commonality among raga sangeet, Western symphonic excerpts and the songs of Tagore, The Four ?R?s ? Raga, Rhyme, Rhapsody and Rabindranath, is a stimulating exercise that attempts to prove that fusion does not necessarily lead to distortion of musical forms and traditions. The programme illuminates, in an innovative manner, the common threads that bind certain Tagore songs with some English ballads and compositions by Beethoven and Mozart. Western melodies are presented on the sitar, sarod and on keyboards, mirrored in ragas like Kirwani and then linked to Tagore. Readings from Tagore?s Sangeet Chinta (Thoughts on Music) and dance will expand the concept of some of the pieces. Participants include Pramita Mallick (Rabindrasangeet exponent), Parambrata Chatterjee (actor/singer), Aparajita Addo (actor/dancer), Francis Lepcha (singer) and Sounak Chatterjee (Hindustani vocalist). Presented by Reliance GSM Smart, Patton, Priya, Tollygunge Club and Open Doors, as a tribute to Tagore on his birth anniversary.

 Raid busts sex racket, five in net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police on Saturday night busted a sex racket in Shastribagan near Baguiati, off VIP Road, and arrested five persons, including three women. 

 Among those arrested were the alleged kingpin Debdas Roy, alias Babu, and Debashish Dey. The flat from where the racket operated is owned by Roy. He had been earlier arrested for operating a sleaze racket from the same flat.

 ?Acting on a tip-off, we laid a trap and raided the flat in Shastribagan?s DB block last night. Apart from Roy and Dey, our officers picked up Pinky Sharma, 25, Rinky Daw, 21, and Soma Basu, 24. Dey, 32, who deals in real estate, was a customer,? said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. 

 According to police, Roy used to run two fast food centres in the locality before switching to real estate. ?He had incurred huge losses in both businesses and was in debt. That, perhaps, prompted him to run a sleaze racket from his house. He used to rent his room to sex workers and even acted as a middleman between them and clients,? said an officer of Rajarhat police station.

 During investigation, police came to know that Pinky, who is married, has links with criminals in the Maniktala area. 

 ?She used to lure young girls from the city, Howrah, Hooghly and South 24-Parganas, by promising them jobs,? said the officer. ?While Pinky gathered the girls, Roy brought in customers against a hefty commission.?

 Roy?s target group comprises promoters and suppliers of building material in the area.

 The two other women ? Rinky and Soma ? lived separately in rented flats in Baguiati. ?They told their landlords before moving in that they worked in private firms. Rinky is married,? said an officer working on the case.

 Pinky and Rinky told police during interrogation that they got involved in the racket for money. ?They used to visit malls often and splurge on dress and cosmetics,? said S.M.H. Meerza, sub-divisional police officer, Barasat.

 In a related development, police claimed to have got specific information about a few more flats in the Baguiati, Kaikhali and Naryantala areas that are playing host to sex rackets. Meerza said raids would be carried out on the flats soon.

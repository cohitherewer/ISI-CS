The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I have two swords this time?

 That?s just one thing KEIRA KNIGHTLEY is excited about as she returns as Elizabeth Swann in Pirates 2, working with such ?beautiful? co-stars

 Keira Knightley with Johnny Depp in a moment from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man?s Chest, releasing here on July 21

 How?s working on Pirates 

 2 and 3 compared to the first?

 It has been really weird actually because I can?t even remember where we started. I guess we started in February and it felt like the last two years had never happened and we have been working on Pirates of the Caribbean the entire time. (Laughs) But it has been great.

 It?s a long haul, as I said. We started in February, we had about a month-and-a-half on hiatus and then we are shooting until February or March (2006), so it is a big one. I have never done anything as long which makes it different, but the guys are great and it is pretty much all the same people and it?s nice, it?s good fun.

 What are you allowed to tell 

 us about what happens in Pirates 2?

 I don?t know! Absolutely nothing probably. I have two swords, that is all I am saying. It?s great. It?s just more really, maybe a little bit darker and we have some really fantastic fight scenes.

 What sort of costumes do you 

 wear in this one? Are you back in the corsets?

 Well, we are doing Pirates 3 at the moment so I am in a kind of Oriental vibe thing with shorts ? it?s the first time I have got legs out and it?s terrifying (laughs).

 Actually I am really glad, it?s so hot in there it is unbelievable, and everybody else has got their proper pirate stuff on and I am a little less dressed than everyone else and I am very glad, so that?s good. The rest of the time I?ve got kind of the pirate look instead of the corset.

 And do you prefer that rather 

 than being strapped in?

 I quite like corsets actually; it kind of gives you a character. You feel so ladylike but I kind of feel a little bit more like me now because I am in sort of boy?s attire. I am giving far too much away (laughs). Both are good.

 You must be pleased with the 

 critical reaction to Pride and Prejudice because 

 it?s had some great reviews?

 Has it? Good. I haven?t seen any of that. If I believed the good stuff, I would have to believe the bad stuff as well and neither of it is very helpful for me. But that?s good, that?s great to know. I like it. All the experiences that I have had so far have been absolutely amazing. And it is lovely to come back on to Pirates, with a film that is already established because there?s so much kind of excitement around it. But equally it is great to do things that are really a complete risk and you don?t know what the outcome is going to be.

 But does it feel like things 

 have changed?

 We made it in 2003 and yes, stuff has changed. I mean I have been working non-stop for one thing, so thats changed. But to tell you the truth the banter on set is exactly the same, so that hasn?t changed. You are working with the same people and it doesnt matter if you have done a lot of films in between or not, they are going to treat you the same as they did. And that?s cool, that?s the way it should be. So the work hasn?t changed but the trailer has (laughs).

 How do you choose a particular 

 film?

 I don?t know, it?s just whatever catches my fancy. If it is a film I think I would want to see, then that?s kind of a good way to judge it. And if you meet the director and you like them then that?s even a better way to judge it. But it just depends. I don?t pick it by genre, if I read a good comedy and I go ?oh yeah, I?d really like to be a part of that?, but equally it could be a drama. I don?t really have a plan; it?s just what jumps out at me.

 Is there a sense that because 

 the first Pirates was such a big hit that you have 

 to match it or better it this time?

 For me personally, no. I mean I think there is a certain amount of pressure because it was so loved and you kind of want to make it as good as you possibly can. But I think that is really the same with any film. What?s nice is the level of excitement around Pirates is huge and normally there isn?t that bigger level of excitement around anything you do until it comes out. But it?s quite nice to be in something where people go ?so come on, what?s going to happen? Tell us what?s going to happen??

 But has the next installment 

 lived up to your own expectations?

 So far yes, absolutely. These are the sort of films where you read it on the page and you can?t imagine what it is going to be like on the screen. I mean it was like the first one, none of us knew what it was going to be like. And in a funny kind of way it really is exactly the same because with this I can say ?yeah it was a great script...? But I can?t imagine what the finished product will be like. I think it is going to be great. I mean from what I have done, I haven?t seen anything, but from what I have done it seems cool, the look of it is really cool and it seems to have evolved in a kind of natural way for it. There are so many pirate stories, you know, you are bound to find a good one! (Laughs) So it?s a really exciting but I don?t know what it will be like.

 Any plans for after Pirates 

 has finished?

 I cannot imagine finishing this. I just can?t. I mean I don?t think we are even half way through yet, well just half way, so no. I?ve started to read a couple of scripts, but I can?t get my head around them yet. So no, no clue.

 What?s it like acting alongside 

 Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom?

 It?s amazing, I mean, they are very beautiful. (Laughs) Yes it is very easy on the eye. And they are really great as well, they are lovely and watching Johnny work, you know it?s masterful really, it?s taking an acting master class, so that?s always enjoyable. And Orlando I have known for a very long time. We used to go up for things in London together so it?s really nice to spend time with him as well. He?s my mate, which is nice.

 What: Performance by item girl Payal Rohatgi. Where: Tantra. 

 When: Saturday night.

 The seductress: The days when Payal Rohatgi revealed almost all for B-grade flicks are over. Now, she will work only under big banners. Coming up: 36 China Town and Corporate. But on Friday night, she did reveal quite a bit in three different dresses.

 The show: Payal did what she does best, send the testosterone levels soaring. Her first performance, from a total of three, started soon after midnight. The bar sales stopped and the dance floor came to a standstill. The mobile cameras were all zooming in on the bar top that was sizzling with Payal and her provocative moves. She gyrated to tracks like Zinda hoon mein, Deedar de and Dus Bahane. 

 The reaction: Mazaa Mazaa (yes, thats one of her sleaze films) was what the men gaped. And what did the ladies think of Payals performance? Tauba Tauba (yes, thats another one of her sleaze films).

 Night binge

 What: Dine with the Devil on Saturday night.

 Where: B.E.D on Ballygunge Circular Road. The cocktail party was thrown to announce B.E.Ds association with Shaun Kenworthy who would now rustle up Italian and Japanese cuisine at the night spot.

 The party: The liquor was free flowing and so were finger food of the Italian and Japanese variety. 

 Adding star power to the party was once-upon-a-time Bollywood hero Aditya Panscholi. I have heard a lot about Shauns culinary expertise, and now all of us will be able to savour it, said the star of movies like Sailab, Aatish, Yes Boss and Musafir.

 Chef Shaun is quite excited about his new innings. It would be a challenge to start from scratch, said the former Flurys man.

 Voiceover: The mood at the night club, which would be undergoing renovation soon, is also upbeat. Change is always refreshing. We have decided to give the place a whole new look, said a spokesperson for the party address.

 Friday fashion

 What: Fashion Show at Souravs: The Food Pavilion. 

 When: Friday night.

 The designer: Lalia Dattagupta.

 The show: Spread over four sequences, models walked the dance floor in various creations. The first sequence was dedicated to ethnic wear where the designers walked in saris in tussar block print, crepe with zardosi motifs and tie--dye in tissue. The second and third rounds were dedicated to floral ponchos, kurtis, raw silk tops and clubwear. The last sequence was reserved for salwar suits.

 Rita De was one of the most respected and loved make-up artists in Calcutta

 Rita De, a veteran hair stylist and make-up artist of Tollywood, died of a cardiac arrest on Monday morning at the age of 60.

 In the beauty business for more than 30 years, Rita has worked with Sananda since its inception. She began as a beautician and hair stylist with Ennis beauty parlour and later switched to films, said daughter Anita.

 Born half-Nepalese and half-Chinese, she married a Bengali and lived in Khardah where she ran two beauty parlours. Apart from Tollywood films, she was part of foreign collaborations like La Nuit Bengali and City of Joy (where she worked on Shabana).

 Known for her bridal make-up, Rita did Tabus wedding look in Mira Nairs The Namesake and was last working on Konkona Sen Sharma for Rituparno Ghoshs Sunglass. We have decided to dedicate Sunglass to Ritadi. This is the least we could do for her She did Unishe April, Bariwali, Dahan, Titli and Dosar. She was a very important member of the unit. She had an innate intelligence combined with a zest for life. We start the second schedule of Sunglass very soon and I dont know who is going to replace her, said Rituparno.

 Apart from working in all of Aparna Sens films, Rita was also the actress-film-makers personal hairdresser and beautician. Rita has been with me for 33 years. I dont know if anyone loved and cared for me as much as she did. The world is never going to be the same without her. She was more than a friend. She was like a sister, and a second mother to Konkona. She called me Didi though she was only six months younger to me. I feel very fortunate and privileged to have known her and to have been loved by her. She was a very giving and selfless person. She was a great favourite with Mother Teresa, who gave her the name Rita, said Aparna.

 She was there in all my films, from 36 Chow-ringhee Lane to 15 Park Avenue. I respected her judgment very much. I would look at Rita after finishing every shot and she would imperceptibly nod yes or no

 With Konkona in Bollywood, Ritas last work was Anurag Basus Metro. She did Omkara and was supposed to come to Mumbai for Metro again. I was also doing Sunglass with her. Somebody replacing her is unbelievable and unacceptable for me. She really brought me up like a second mother, said Konkona.

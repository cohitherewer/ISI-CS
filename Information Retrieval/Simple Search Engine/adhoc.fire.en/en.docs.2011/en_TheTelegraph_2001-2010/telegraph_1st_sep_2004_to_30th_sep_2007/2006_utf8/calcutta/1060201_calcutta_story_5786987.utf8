 Fire and earth find favour

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 The Chinese New Year that started on January 29 will be ruled by the elements of fire and earth, which are in harmony with each other since in the productive cycle of nature, fire creates earth

The advent of spring symbolically means the beginning of growth, prosperity and happiness in every sphere of life. This time the Chinese New Year is dedicated to the Dog and it begins with the elements of fire and earth, which are in harmony with each other because in the productive cycle of the five elements of nature, it is fire that creates earth. We can expect lesser international conflicts this year as compared to the previous years. Such friendly elemental combination of earth and metal was last seen in 2000, when the entire world happily celebrated the new millennium.

 This year, the first ruling yang fire element can be compared to the sun and its qualities like warmth, prosperity, clarity of mind, success and better opportunities. Peaceful negotiations in a healthy environment leading to better relationships can be anticipated. 

 Now, the second ruling yang earth element of the Dog is in clash with the earth element of the Dragon and at the same time forms a triple clash with the earth elements of the Ox and the Goat. Since earth is in direct clash with earth, we can expect disasters like earthquakes, landslides, building collapses etc.

 A special warning for those born in the Years of Dragon, Ox and Goat to avoid going too close to mountainous and desert areas, specially in the earth months ? April, July, October 2006 and January 2007. It will be beneficial for such people to carry a pendant of a Rabbit, which will prevent them from clashing with the Dog and its negative influence and hidden dangers. They should engage in performing good deeds and spiritual activities. Special attention should be given to health matters.

 Since fire is now coming to power, the year will be especially favourable for businesses related to finance, electricity, hospitality, entertainment, stock markets and airlines. In addition, as earth is also in power, which symbolises direct wealth for the wood element, it will also be a prosperous year for wood-related industries like books, printing presses, publications, paper, textiles and furniture. 

 According to the flying star methods followed in Feng Shui, the energies change every year. In the beginning of the Chinese New Year we should take a good look at the presence of good and bad energies in our homes and offices. In case bad energies move to important areas like the entrance, bedrooms, childrens study areas and office chambers we should take corrective measures to prevent mishaps.

 In the year of the Dog, the bad energy called Five Yellow ? symbolising obstacles and misfortune ? arrives in the west. If the west of your house is an important area like a bedroom or the entrance, it is best to hang a five-rod solid metal wind chime here to dissolve this bad energy. Alternatively, you could keep a heavy piece of metal at this point in the form of a statue or a pot. The worst months will be April, July and September. 

 Another bad star number 2, symbolising sickness, will arrive in the south-east in 2006. The traditional method to dissolve this is to hang a string of six metal coins in the affected area in the south-east of the house. The Grand Duke this year is in the north-west, hence it is not advisable to move earth or make major construction work in this direction. Do not even confront the Grand Duke Jupiters direction by sitting facing this side. It is always better to take its support by having it behind you. It is also not recommended to sit with your back towards the north as you will be sitting against the unfavourable energy called Three Shars or Three Killings. 

 The bad star 3 is a star of conflict, arguments and robbery. This is present in the centre of the house. It is necessary to exhaust the negative wood energy with something that represents fire. This can be a piece of red paper, a bouquet of red flowers or some candles arranged on a table in the centre of the house to minimise the bad influence. Alternatively, displaying a crystal tortoise on a red mat in the centre will also help to avoid arguments.

 The bad star 7, representing scandals, is in the south. The traditional solution for this bad star is to place three or four bamboo plants grown in a clear glass vase in the south.

 Rethink, resolve to make city greener

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In an attempt to make Calcutta greener, the state government is all set to revise its greening action plan later this month. 

 Having realised that last year?s programme was a disappointment, the government has decided to take steps to rework the existing greening policy.

 According to additional chief secretary (forest) A.K. Patnaik, the chief secretary will convene a meeting to chalk out the new greening policy for the coming years.

 ?We?ve circulated a note on our new greening policy to all related departments. We are waiting for their feedback. It?s important that we assess last year?s performance before chalking out the next plan,? said Patnaik.

 Last year, saplings were distributed to various agencies, including the army, the PWD, the Rotary Clubs, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), urban development department and other organisations. 

 Though the saplings planted by these organisations have survived, the overall outcome of the programme has been quite disappointing, forest officers said.

 ?Of the lakh-odd saplings distributed during the last monsoon, just 30 per cent of have survived. We have realised that making Calcutta green is quite a difficult proposition,? conceded a senior official. 

 However, the officers added that last year?s mistakes have given them new ideas to improve the scenario in the city. 

 ?In our first attempt in Rajarhat, we had planted small saplings, but it wasn?t very successful. Later on, when we experimented with tall saplings, we saw that these had a better chance of survival. We need to plant healthy, vigorous and tall saplings for Calcutta ,? said Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests (urban and recreational forestry wing).

 Officers said that some areas, like Manohar Das Tarag and Prinsep Ghat, had been neglected in the past and their maintenance will be addressed in this year?s plan. The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) had committed to pay Rs 1.5 lakh for the maintenance of the Manohar Das Tarag banks, but has not released the money as yet.

 ?Similarly, the Prinsep Ghat area is maintained by the army. But, they haven?t come forward to bear the expenses,? an officer added. 

 Notwithstanding last year?s failure, forest officers said plans are afoot for planting more than two lakh saplings this year. 

 Of these, a lakh saplings will be distributed to schools, colleges, NGOs and different nature clubs. The rough estimate of the complete programme, along with maintenance, will be around Rs 1.2 crore.

 ?The maintenance cost for next two years alone will require Rs 30 lakh in 2007?2008 and another Rs 25 lakh during 2008-2009,? Mukherjee added.

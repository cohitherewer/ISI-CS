 SOUMITRA DAS

 Joanna Hoffmans work at the Baruipur interactive session

 In the ruins of memory the house/breathes/through its mouldy surface/touched by strangers looks Time cracks inside the ripened walls/It tears off with fragile flakes/Swollen with history the heart of hearts/bestows its place on silence.

 These lines by Joanna Hoffmann, an artist from Poland, encapsulate the quest of the participants of Khoj, a 17-day workshop of 26 artists from all over the world, who worked at Chaudhuribari in Baruipur from October 14. It is a house with a thakurdalan belonging to local landlords. It was chosen for intercultural interactions.

 The works that the participants produced here, and the extensive discussions that they held were in response to the site, which had an ambience of its own and had its own interesting story to tell of life within and without. 

 The local artists were mostly from Calcutta and Santiniketan. Artists from Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore, Srinagar, Thiruvananthapuram and Guwahati were also there. Thanks to the networking skills of the organisers, there were participants from the USA, Georgia, Japan, Poland, Taiwan, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Jordan, South Africa, Bangladesh, the UK, and Pakistan.

 The days on which visitors were invited over, Chaudhuribari turned into an art mela. The better works were the simplest ones, though much thinking must have gone into them.

 Although they were meant to confound viewers, one could not miss Sanchayan Ghoshs (Santiniketan) faux plaques with fictitious inscriptions. Archana Handes (Mumbai) sepia self-portraits, once again were a play on identity/reality. 

 This hackneyed idea seemed to have caught on, for Pakistani artist Saira Sheikh, too, had tried it out, with herself in a photograph dressed as a Bengali woman in a sari and South African Simon Gush as her dhoti-ed spouse. 

 Ashim Purakayasthas (New Delhi) fibre-glass column played with the same idea. Abhishek Hazras Dweposit video work was more of the same, although in a smart-alecky manner. Manjari Chakravarty tried to evoke claustrophobia in the zenana but did it in a trifle too obvious a manner.

 The courtyard had a striking paper construction that resembled the Ganga tumbling down from heaven. This was by Parvathy (lives in Thiruvananthapuram but actually a Bengali) who wears her hair in dramatic dreadlocks and sings baul songs.

 Chou Meng Yehs (Taiwan) colourful numerals and Trag Ngoc Anhs (Vietnam) added colour. This house has no particular room assigned for childbirth. So Zahed Ali Chowdhury (Bangladesh) created one where this violent, bloody process was recreated with a straw dummy.

 When foreigners try to use indigenous forms or idioms, there is always a possibility of confusion, good intentions notwithstanding. Joscelyn Gardners work (Barbados/Canada) involved creating alpana, Nandalal Bose style. Perhaps she was unaware of the homely alpana with ground rice soaked in water. Simon Gushs performance with cycle-rickshaws was equally confused.

 Two works which stood out were those by Anindita Dutta (New York) and Joanna Hoffman. Dutta showed remarkable skill by creating a nude female figure. This stuffed doll, distinctly Indian in appearance, lay spread-eagled across the roof of a card four-poster, its image reflected in a large mirror under the bed.

 Hoffmans video of a rotating brain scan superimposed on architectural forms taken from Chaudhuribari had deep poetic resonances.

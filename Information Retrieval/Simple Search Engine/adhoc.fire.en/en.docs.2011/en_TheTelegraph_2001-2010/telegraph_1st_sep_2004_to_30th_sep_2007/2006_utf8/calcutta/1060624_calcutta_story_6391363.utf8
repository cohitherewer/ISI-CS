 JU guest house for overseas focus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 After adopting a new policy to attract foreign students, Jadavpur University (JU) is set to get its first guest house exclusively for foreigners and NRIs. The proposed accommodation is the first step towards increasing interaction with foreign institutions.

 ?Our new guest house will be of international standards and exclusively for foreign nationals and NRIs,? explained Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and a member of the university?s executive council.

 JU has chosen one of its properties ? a nine-cottah plot near Padmapukur, in south Calcutta ? as the site for the guest house ?to provide world-class accommodation to visitors?, Biswas added.

 The 22-room guest house will have facilities like foreign exchange counters, a multi-gym, a coffee shop, a common kitchen and a catering service. 

 The guest house plan is also in tune with a suggestion by a three-member inspection team of the Union human resources ministry that visited the campus in December 2005 to examine the university?s infrastructure for upgrading it to the IIT level.

 The committee had observed that JU needed greater interaction with foreign institutions through more international seminars, workshops and collaborative research programmes. 

 The inspection team felt that to boost such activities, the university immediately needed an international-standard guesthouse to provide accommodation to foreign visitors.

 ?We have earmarked nearly Rs 88 lakh from the fund that we received from the University Grants Commission for the upgrade programme,? Biswas said.

 ?Our students go abroad under our joint academic programmes with foreign universities. But we cannot invite students and researchers from other countries because we cannot afford to provide them with accommodation in hotels,? an official said.

 Construction will start in August. Selection of the architect?s firm is on, officials added. The final plan of the building and the facilities will be finalised once the university finalises the firm.

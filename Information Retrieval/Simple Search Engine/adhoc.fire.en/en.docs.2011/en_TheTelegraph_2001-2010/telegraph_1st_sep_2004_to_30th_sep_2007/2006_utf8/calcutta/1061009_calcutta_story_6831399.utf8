The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Feast of fantastic amp; fierce creatures

 SOUMITRA DAS

 Pages out of Gobardhan 

 Ashs Chhabi O Chhada 

 Gobardhan Ash had shocked Calcutta with his graphic depictions of the horrors of the 1943 famine. The artist, who died at the ripe old age of 89 in the obscurity of his home at Begumpur, in Hooghly, is still remembered for conjuring up those gaunt spectral figures who haunted the streets of Calcutta in search of gruel and offal, grabbing morsels from the dogs and vultures that had descended on the city.

 There are few around who remember that Ash used to belong to the Calcutta Group, along with the Progressive Artists Group of Bombay, which had in the late 1940s held an exhibition at 1, Chowringhee Terrace in space that belonged to Jatin Majumdar. Difficult though it is to believe it today, it is said that at this exhibition the price of Ashs paintings was more than that of M.F. Husains. 

 Although his exhibitions are still held periodically, often in combination with the works of his sons Nirban and Debarshi and grandsons Jyotirmoy and Chinmoy, his colourful doodles dating back to the 1970s, which were meant to entertain and edify his grandchildren, are rarely seen and less heard of. These delightful sketches of fantastic and fierce creatures were accompanied by simple rhymes that underlined the violence latent in his creations. 

 A selection of these has recently been published in the form of a slim book titled Chhabi O Chhada by Raktakarabi with the help of the Ash family. According to the foreword, in the 1970s, when the artists sons had become self-supporting, Gobardhan used to spend the afternoons spinning yarns for his grandchildren. Before sunset, he would start playing the sitar to welcome the evening. 

 His innumerable doodles cover the sheets of two books, the larger undated one measuring 9 inchx7 inch and the smaller one being 6 inchx4 inch dating back to 1983. Ash, having struggled with poverty all his life, was not very picky about his medium. He used crayons, oil paints and charcoal or whatever came his way. He did the same with these creatures.

 These are beasts of prey with an unsatiated appetite for flesh human or otherwise always on the prowl for victims they can make short work of with their sharp teeth. With their polka-dotted skin, they resemble cheetahs but are often equipped with a nasty-looking pair of horns with which they disembowel their victims before gobbling them up. They growl, roar and snap like curs when hungry but can look disarmingly innocent to lure their prey.

 The creature could be a figment of imagination a winged canine who hunted birds and at whom little boys threw stones. It could also resemble an alligator for whom nothing was inedible. These predators belonged to Ashs vast repertoire of animals, many painted on large canvases. At the same time, the creature is a caricature of beasts we see in the wild. The humour is unmistakable. 

 Beside these nasty pieces of work, there are three others a Vaishnav mendicant, children who live and let live, and an owl with a pigeon as his guest.

 Ashs animals show his understanding of the darker face of childhood. It is not simply the age of innocence and bliss but is as fraught with fears, anxieties and tensions as the lives of those who have grown out of it are wont to be.

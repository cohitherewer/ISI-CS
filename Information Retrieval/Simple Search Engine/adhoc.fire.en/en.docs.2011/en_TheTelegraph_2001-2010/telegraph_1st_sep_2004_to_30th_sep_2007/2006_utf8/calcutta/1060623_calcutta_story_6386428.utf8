 Based on a true story from the court files of Bihar, Waarish tells a horrifying tale of lust, power and superstition. In his obsession to produce an heir, Chiranji Chowdhury, a wealthy, childless landlord, tries to seduce Gulabi, his wife?s maid, and beget a child by her. He offers her impoverished father, Dinanath Pujari, cash and land in lieu. The landlord also promises that after the birth of his child, he would marry off Gulabi to Raghu, a motor mechanic with whom she is in love. Gulabi is aware that unless she accedes to Chowdhury?s demands, she will suffer a fate similar to that of other young girls of her village. The superannuated Chowdhury also tries to regain his long-lost virility by killing an infant-girl to offer as human sacrifice. Meanwhile, Gulabi gets pregnant by Raghu, and they both escape to save themselves from the grasp of the landlord, determined in his desire to sire a child. Direction: Rishi Mukhopadhyay.

 Marriage is a secure social institution while living together is a mere social trend. These were the opening lines of the GoodLife Talk Show that was hosted to a packed house inside the Desh Pavilion at the Calcutta Book Fair on Monday evening. 

 The topic: Marriage versus Live-in Relationships. 

 The panel comrpised six youngsters including actress Koneenica Banerjee, students Dibyadyuti Roy of Presidency College, Harsh Aditya Poddar of National University of Juridical Sciences, Tathagata Chatterjee of Bidhannagar Government College, Rema Bose of Bethune College and Neha Chadha, teacher of Pailan College.

 The discussion picked up momentum right from the time moderator Rita Bhimani introduced the topic, with each speaker putting forth his/her views on the subject. While Dibyadyuti viewed live-in relationships as just another variant of marriage, for Neha the two were totally different from each other.

 The session was then thrown open to the floor with Krishanu Agarwal, a student of law, stating that live-in relationships are an influence of the western media where such things are rampant and where nuclear families are the order of the day, thus posing a serious threat to our time-tested family traditions. Deftly dealing with the statement, Dibyadyuti said: You might have one Baywatch being screened on STAR World, but that is not the ultimate. You also have Full House aired on Zee Cafe upholding strong familial values. Such contradictions exist in every society; you are really not in a position to dub western culture as totally bad, while hailing Oriental culture. It depends largely on the individuals, on what they want and the kind of situations they are in.

 Rema had a different viewpoint: The kind of society we live in today does not still acknowledge living-in, especially here in Calcutta. Thus the benchmark of considering what is bad and what is good is very situational. With our kind of values and upbringing, we may find it difficult to accept the concept of living together, but had our grooming been different, we too would have accepted it. And no one is above society really, to live in society one has to abide by certain social norms. Thus marriage is much more acceptable to us.

 A strong advocate of the traditional institution of marriage, a middle-aged lady then asked the panelists whether they did not feel that there was a problem in the very foundation of a live-in relationship. If I like a person one day and start living with him/her, the very next morning I might wake up and start liking someone else and move in with that person. Is this what is desirable in todays society? Do people have no respect for the emotional dimensions associated with marriage? What does a live-in relationship stand on?

 Koneenica strongly supported the member of the audience: Frankly speaking, I am not at all for a live-in relationship. It is a relation out of which you get nothing. There is no foundation other than momentary physical attraction and the moment those needs are met, you start finding fault with your partner and walk out of it. Marriage binds you to some sort of discipline. And I believe the emotional support, the little good things that you come back home to in your married life can never be replaced by any form of living together.

 The actress also felt that men benefit more out of a live-in relationship. The kind of emotional security that a girl looks for is largely lacking in a live-in relationship. I fear that the day the institution of marriage breaks down, society will break down as well.

 With 80 per cent of the crowd averse to the idea of living-in, it was indeed difficult to dwell on the positives of such relationships. However, Rita asked the panelists what society could do to help the handful of youngsters who wanted to live together despite all odds. There is nothing wrong with people who want to live-in, as long as they dont question the basic ethics of society. We are groomed in a particular way, our parents inculcate certain basic values in us. But after a certain age it should be left to the youngsters to live life the way they want. If someone wants to try out something new, it is important that the person is allowed to do so. After all, we live in a democracy with full freedom of choice, said budding lawman Harsh. 

 The question of economics soon came up and there was much harping on how far that facilitated the rise in live-in relationships. Live-in relations might have increased, but they are still only a handful. It is still an unreal concept for most middle-class families and its best watched on screen. But money matters do play a great role in a live-in relation. In cities like Delhi, Bangalore or Mumbai, where accommodation is so expensive, it often makes sense to pool in and live together, agreed both Harsh and Dibyadyuti.

 The lively two-hour session came to an end with a bunch of youngsters asking what one could dub the rise in live-in relationships as: change of society or breakdown of society? The panelists felt it was the measure of a change in society, of a changing mindset caused by changing situations.

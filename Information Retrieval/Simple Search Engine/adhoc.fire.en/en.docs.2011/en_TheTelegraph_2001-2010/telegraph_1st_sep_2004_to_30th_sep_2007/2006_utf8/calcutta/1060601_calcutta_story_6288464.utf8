 Fall in line or face the music ? the cops have made a move on nightclubs remaining open beyond deadline. 

 Faced with a flurry of complaints from parents, Calcutta Police has asked discotheque owners to be prepared for stringent action if they keep their establishments open beyond the deadline ? 2 am for standalone party places and 4 am for five-star addresses.

 According to the parents, their children are spending the night at discotheques and returning home drunk at dawn. Complaints of eve-teasing and molestation at the discotheques have also poured in recently. 

 ?This is happening because of gross violation of rules laid down by police. An inspection last week revealed that none of the nightclubs adhere to the deadline mentioned in the licence issued to them,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma.

 The officers who carried out the inspection found that most discotheques remained open till early in the morning. ?Dance floors at two standalone discotheques were crowded till 5.30 am, when they are permitted to stay open only till 2 am. A couple of five-star discotheques were open till 6 am when they have permission to operate till 4 am,? said a member of the probe team.

 ?We are not trying to play moral guardian, we are only concerned about the law. The deadline is mentioned in the instructions issued to the discotheques. They must abide by the norms,? asserted Sharma.

 The discotheque authorities claimed that they have not violated the deadline. 

 ?The five-star hotels can keep their discotheques open till 4 am with police permission. We are open till dawn only after obtaining permission from Lalbazar. If we do not have permission, we close on time,? claimed Vinay Jaiswal, director of operations, Hotel Hindusthan International, which houses the nightclub Underground.

 ?The last drink is poured 15 minutes before 2 am. By the time the guests leave, it is 2.30 am,? stated Arvind Bhatnagar, executive director, PDK Shehnaz Hotels Pvt Ltd, of which Shisha is a part. 

 Deputy commissioner (special), detective department, Rajeev Mishra has, however, started planning a drive against nightclubs flouting the deadline. ?A list of violators is being prepared. We will conduct raids. If we find a discotheque operating beyond the stipulated time-limit, we will question the floor manager.?

 Three discotheques were served a showcause two months ago for violating the deadline. They were allowed to continue operations after the authorities promised to stick to the time curbs. Strict action would be taken against the nightclubs if they are caught violating the norms again, said the cops.

 Lease scam hits Salt Lake

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 A land scam is taking concrete shape in Salt Lake. The state urban development department has constituted a committee to probe the alleged transfer of plots and landed properties by leaseholders in Salt Lake, and 15 cases have already been filed seeking eviction and cancellation of lease deeds.

 This was disclosed in an affidavit placed by Shankar Ranjan Bagchi, joint secretary, urban development department, Salt Lake division, before a division bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday.

 ?So far, 921 allegations of property transfers have been lodged with the department, but the inquiry committee has found 421 of these allegations to be baseless. The committee is probing the rest of the complaints,? the affidavit stated.

 The committee has, in fact, engaged the Criminal Investigation Department to probe the plot-and-property scandal.

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Nadira Patherya on Friday directed the state government to keep it posted about the progress in the case.

 ?You must inform us what penal action is being taken against the leaseholders found guilty of the crime,? stated the division bench.

 According to a government notification dated May 23, 1984, plot holders in the Salt Lake area only have the right to transfer their leasehold properties to their father, mother, husband, wife, daughter, son, sister or brother.

 Rama Prasad Sarkar, an advocate of Calcutta High Court, had moved a public interest litigation before the high court a fortnight ago, alleging that the plot holders of Salt Lake were transferring their landed properties to ?outsiders?.

 Bidhannagar Bachao Committee, a social organisation in the area, backed the petitioner and submitted 600 alleged cases of leaseholders passing on plot and property illegally.

 The petition went on to allege that the illegal residents were changing the character of a given property and even using it for commercial, rather than residential, purposes.

 The court was requested to direct the authorities to cancel the deeds of the offenders as many legitimate claimants were being denied plots.

 The division bench made it clear on Friday that the urban development department must be prepared to furnish in court full details of leaseholding agreements since 1971. The case comes up for hearing after two weeks.

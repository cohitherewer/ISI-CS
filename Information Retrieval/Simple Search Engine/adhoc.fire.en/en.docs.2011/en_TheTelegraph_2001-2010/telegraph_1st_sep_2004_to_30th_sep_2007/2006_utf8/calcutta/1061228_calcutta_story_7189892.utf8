 Humorous stage-songs

 Since the late 18th century, music has been used as a powerful vehicle of expression in the theatre of Bengal. Over the next two centuries, while theatre songs evolved as a specialised genre of music, its humorous numbers (rangaraser manchagaan) played an important role in unfolding plots, reconciling conflicts and affording climax in plays. Experimenting with various styles and language of humour like burlesque, comedy, farce, lampoon, parody, satire, wit and so on, these comic songs made excellent use of the ubiquitous Bengali sense of humour in putting across a message. Presented by Academy Theatre, Rangaraser Manchagaan covers the twin areas of theatre and music humour of the last 200 years. Drawing upon research in recordings, notations, prompt-books and newspaper clippings, it presents an exciting and original view of the impact of humorous theatre songs upon the theatre-going audience. The presentation leads us to arrive at the crossroads of indigenous and alien approaches in social, political, economical and philosophical spheres. Participants: Riddhi Bandyopadhyay, Sudipta Chakraborty, Koushik Sen, Paran Bandyopadhyay and Devajit Bandyopadhyay, along with a band of renowned musicians. Concept and direction: Devajit Bandyopadhyay.

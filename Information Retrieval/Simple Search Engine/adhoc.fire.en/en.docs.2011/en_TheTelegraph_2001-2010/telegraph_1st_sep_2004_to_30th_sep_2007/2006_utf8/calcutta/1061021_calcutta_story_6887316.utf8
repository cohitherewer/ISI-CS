 While most girls her age are busy juggling classes, nightclubs and malls, this 18-year-old Gujarati girl is happy juggling roles of a loving biwi, doting bahu, responsible didi and concerned dost.

 Meet Prachi Desai, better known as Bani of Kasamh Se or as Tulsi of Zee TV.

 In town for the launch of a jewellery store on Wednesday, Prachi said: Fifty per cent of me is what Bani is, simple and sober. In real life, I am chirpy and fun-loving too, shades of which my character is enjoying at the moment.

 The teenager with a dimpled smile landed the role that changed her life when auditioning for Balaji, while still in junior college in Pune.

 I was never the studious kind. I was crazy about television as a kid and grew up watching Tulsi, Kashish, Prerna and Parvati (characters from STAR Plus prime-time shows). If not an actress, I would perhaps be an air-hostess, she shared.

 Talking about comparisons with Tulsi (Smriti Irani) of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Prachi said: Though it is a big compliment, comparison is uncalled for. I still have a lot to learn and hope to meet the audience expectations. 

 Her career moves currently revolve around Kasamh Se. Bani is the best role I could ask for and would not leave it for anything else... A reality show for a short while in future would be welcome.

 And what is it like, being Bani? The youngster is all praise for her colleagues: On the sets we are like one big family. Jigyasa might not be the best sister-in-law on screen, but off screen Prachi is quite close to Ashwini Kalsekar (playing Jigyasa). After all, we get to do a lot of scenes together, she smiled.

 Though reel life demands flaunting the heavy sari and salwar kameez, Prachi in real life is most comfortable in casuals. Before Kasamh Se happened, I would admire outfits worn by tele actresses. Now I have to wear my share of those dresses. So tees and denims are a welcome change when I am not shooting.

 Time off shooting is spent sleeping and shopping. I am happy how my life has shaped up, but I do miss college, hanging around with people my age and lazing around, came the candid confession. A hectic acting schedule leaves her little time to find Mr Right, but then Prachi is in no hurry. Looks, career, character I want my man to be perfect in all respects, she laughed.

 As for Diwali, Prachi plans to be in Mumbai, shooting for a while and spending valuable time with family.

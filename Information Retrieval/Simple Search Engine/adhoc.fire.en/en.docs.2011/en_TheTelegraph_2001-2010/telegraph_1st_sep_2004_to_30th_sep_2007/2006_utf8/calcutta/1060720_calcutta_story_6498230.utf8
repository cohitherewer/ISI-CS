 for the underprivileged. The book was launched by Russi 

 Mody, the main sponsor, and all 75 copies priced at Rs 300 

 sold like hot cakes, what else?

 All the recipes in the book are 

 non-Indian ? Ricotta Dumplings, Tsatziki, Chicken in Wine, 

 Vegetarian Paella, Anzae Biscuits, Sacher Torte and many 

 more.

 Voiceover: Dedicating the 

 book to his mother, the late Lady Zerbai Mody, the former

 one and there is hardly a recipe in this book that I havent 

 tried and tested myself!

 Hilsa hurrah

 various hilsa delicacies. Two dishes from Bengal with historical 

 tales attached to them find place on the menu. Ilish Machher 

 Rasha is a recipe by Bipradas Mukhopadhaya, father of theatre 

 personality Aparesh Chandra, and Ilish Machh Narkel Doodh 

 Diye apparently comes straight from the kitchens 

 of the Tagore family. 

 In the continental section, theres 

 hilsa with French and Spanish flavours. Dig into Pan-seared 

 Fillet of Hilsa and Hilsa Saint-Germain from the French 

 kitchen and Hilsa con Aceitunas y Alcaparras 

 from Spain. The festival delicacies are available for both 

 lunch and dinner.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start 

 at Rs 375.

 Voiceover: Four years 

 ago, when we started the hilsa festival, it was one of its 

 kind in the city. But now almost every eatery hosts an elish 

 festival. With our traditional and continental innovations, 

 we want to bring back the novelty factor, said Kallol 

 Banerjee, manager, Marco Polo.

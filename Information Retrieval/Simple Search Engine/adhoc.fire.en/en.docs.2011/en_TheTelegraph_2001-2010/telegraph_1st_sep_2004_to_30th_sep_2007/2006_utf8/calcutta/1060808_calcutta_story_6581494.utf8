 When it comes to browsing and buying at the marriage mart, Calcutta is right up there with the rest. The fact is borne out by figures at the debut edition of a one-stop wedding exhibition in town footfall in four days, 40,000; over-the-counter sales, Rs 2.5 crore-plus; estimate of annualised business worth for exhibitors, Rs 30-35 crore.

 Celebrating Vivaha 2006, that concluded at Taj Bengal on Monday, found the Calcutta consumer making a beeline for wedding-only counters showcasing 53 labels. Reason enough for the organisers to book double the capacity for the next event and even mull a bi-annual show here.

 Before the start of the extravaganza, on Friday, Tarun Sarda, CEO of Vivaha Interactive, had said the reasons for coming to Calcutta after Delhi were the changing spending pattern and the fact that the city has traditionally hosted some of the grandest weddings. At the end of the Calcutta show, Sarda was ecstatic: There was tremendous curiosity about the event. And when the traffic flows in, conversions happen.

 Although the footfall figures are way behind the 100,000 recorded in the last Delhi edition, the conversions can give the capital some competition.

 In value terms, jewellery was the biggest draw, with Delhi-based Hazoorilal Jewellers, Nemichand Bamalwa amp; Sons, Scintillating Jewellery and Trendsmith doing great business over the weekend. 

 Diamond jewellery brand Adora alone added over Rs 10 lakh to its kitty.

 While high-end luxury brand Movado received orders for 19 watches, Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre (JLC) and Baume amp; Mercier booked 15 orders. The price tag for these brands range from Rs 19,000 to Rs 40 lakh.

 We received great mileage from the show, said Gurinder Sahni, managing director of Jot Impex, which brought brands like JLC and Baume amp; Mercier to Vivaha 2006.

 To capture memorable marriage moments, Canon managed to sell more than 25 digital cameras in four days. 

 City-based wedding planner Sapphire Weddings received 350 solid potential inquiries for upcoming weddings, while event planning and celebrity management consultancy Talent Inc had 250 clients showing an interest in adding a dash of glamour to their weddings.

 City designers like Ekta and Ruchira (Ekru), Naina Jain (Bandhej) and Sonia Mahajan (Dar-e-aab) that had participated in the event were here mostly because of the brand equity of Vivaha. But they have made very good business at the exhibition, says CEO Sarda.

 The exhibition surpassed Naina Jains expectations, with the most expensive items flying off the racks first.

 No wonder bigger and better Vivaha plans are being lined up next year in the city that has played host to mega marriages, from Birla to Mittal.

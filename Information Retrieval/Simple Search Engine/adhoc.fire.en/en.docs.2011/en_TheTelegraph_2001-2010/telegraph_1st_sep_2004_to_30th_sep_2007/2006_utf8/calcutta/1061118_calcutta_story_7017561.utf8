 Cartridges at airport

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An abandoned cardboard box containing nine rounds of cartridges was found at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Friday evening.

 A Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) constable spied a box lying near the domestic arrival lounge. The lettering on the box said it contained nine rounds of cartridge of 7.65-mm bore.

 The CISF constable alerted senior officers and the box was opened. A passenger was probably carrying it but seeing the heightened security, he got scared and dumped it there, surmised a senior CISF official. And the cartridges are probably of .32-mm bore.

 The box of cartridges was handed over to airport police.

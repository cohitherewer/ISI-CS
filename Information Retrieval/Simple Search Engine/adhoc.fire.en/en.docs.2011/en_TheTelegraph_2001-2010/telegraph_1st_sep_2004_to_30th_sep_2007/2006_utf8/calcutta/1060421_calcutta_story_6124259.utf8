Language burden: Picture-perfect moments from a Champions 

League match and (below) a Tom and Jerry show

The picture of the crow?s nest on the palm of the 

Indira Gandhi statue published on the front page of Metro made me sad (House-proud, 

March 30). The time when the photograph was taken, the birds were well into their 

nesting season. So the eggs would have been laid by then. 

 Publishing the picture was sentencing the unborn eggs to immediate destruction before they could hatch. And that is exactly what happened. 

 The next day, another photograph was printed of the ?cleaned? statue after the maintenance people were jerked into action. 

 Could the newspaper not have waited for a few more weeks before going to press? The crows surely would not have cleaned up the nest after the chicks took flight. Or is it because there are too many crows anyway that they do not deserve humanitarian consideration? 

D. Chowdhury,

Alipore. 

Apropos the report ?Soccer global, commentary local?, March 30, the majority of viewers in the city would prefer English commentary with international sports events. Hindi commentary along with the Champions League quarterfinals left city football-lovers seething. I suspect the sports channels took the decision only from a commercial perspective. They have left the average sports-lover with no option but to wait for the CAS to be implemented. 

Chandan Ray,

Sakuntala Park.

Why are the foreign satellite channels bent on burdening 

us with a Hindi feed? Are we not worthy of the real thing? Much of the excitement 

goes out of European football if the crisp and impassioned English commentary 

is replaced by a damp squib in Hindi. With the World Cup coming up, it is a terrifying 

thought if ESPN is going to persist with its dumbing-down policy. Cartoon Network 

has already robbed us of the fun of watching cartoons by stifling the original 

voices of the masters and dubbing our favourite characters locally. 

Swati Banerjee, 

Jodhpur Park.

Apropos the report ?Bringing things to light, effectively?, March 29, in India, the state governments and the central government do not even acknowledge the receipt of a letter. Here the Right to Information Act is nothing but a mockery. It will add to the other well-meaning laws in the country that are never implemented. The citizens will not benefit at all. 

Sachindra Nath Mitra,

Beleghata.

Apropos the report ?Hospitals in security beef-up?, March 27, it is a wise decision on the part of the state health department to tighten security arrangements in the five city hospitals, as many unfortunate incidents have taken place on their premises recently. Beating up of doctors and destruction of medical equipment are commonplace. A girl was recently raped. Quite often, those involved in such incidents are local criminals, who have taken shelter in the hospitals. A security beef-up is urgently needed. 

Sourish Misra, 

Salt Lake 

Apropos the article ?Art of electronic media?, March 20, kudos to CIMA Gallery and Max Mueller Bhavan for organising a unique show of German video sculpture. People not familiar with this art form came to know about Nam June Paik, the father of video art. The exhibition introduced us to a wonderful form of creative expression. 

Godhuli Goswami,

Convent Road.

Ballygunge Sammilani?s efforts to preserve the residence of the late music composer Sachin Dev Burman is commendable (SD house, March 30). Buildings where important people lived need to be maintained. The condition of many such structures is decrepit due to lack of care. 

 The entire blame for that should not be heaped on the government, which is acutely strapped of cash. Private organisations should also help out. 

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 

Behala.

Apropos the report ?All terrain Pushpak?, March 31, we should be proud that three engineering students from the state have developed an all-terrain vehicle. It is sad that the government is more interested in promoting imported vehicles than home-grown talents. 

B.N. Bose,

Dum Dum Park.

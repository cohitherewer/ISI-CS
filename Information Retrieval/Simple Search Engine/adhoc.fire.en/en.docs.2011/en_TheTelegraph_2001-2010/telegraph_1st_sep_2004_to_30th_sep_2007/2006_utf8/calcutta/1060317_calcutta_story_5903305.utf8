 Mummy wants 

 me to model 

 - Growing breed of mothers pushing daughters to the ramp

 Behind every successful model ? Bipasha Basu to Koena Mitra ? there?s a mother. And now, they are coming into the forefront, pushing portfolios and propelling daughters on to the ramp.

 Ask event managers drowned by mothers pushing their ?model? daughters? cause. ?We organise lots of medium-scale fashion shows in city nightclubs, where we encourage new models. These days, we have mothers approaching us with the portfolios of their daughters who haven?t even given their Class X exams. This trend is growing, with most mothers harbouring dreams of instant fame and fortune if their daughters become the next Koena Mitra, whether they have the capability or not,? says an event manager.

 There is a word of caution from model mom Jhulan Mitra: ?When my daughter (Koena) had stepped into modelling, the scene was completely different. There was hardly any exposure and the family pressure not to go into modelling was immense. But now, mothers really want to push their girls into modelling because there are opportunities aplenty and success comes quicker. But they should first assess the capability of their daughters before making them plunge into the glamour industry.?

 The desperation among mothers to see their daughters reach the ramp can be seen outside venues where the auditions for various pageants take place. 

 ?When the Calcutta auditions for pageants like Gladrags Megamodel take place in Tantra, there is a whole host of mothers waiting outside, as if their kids are writing their school-leaving exams inside,? smiles a spokesperson for the Park nightclub.

 For some mothers, it?s about a sense of vicarious achievement while for others, it?s about doing the in thing. 

 Neha Kapoor, who wants her 15-year-old daughter Supriya to step into modelling, explains: ?I want her to take up modelling as a hobby. Modelling has become quite simple, and it can bring instant recognition.?

 Some see the ramp as a stepping stone to a better match in marriage. ?One of my aunts wants to put her daughter into modelling because a stint in the glamour industry helps, as boys nowadays prefer girls who are in sync with the latest fashion trends. And who better than a model,? observes Druna Paul, who works with a star hotel in town.

 Then there is the factor of financial independence. ?My daughter must learn to be self-sufficient. She has not passed her Class X exams, but for modelling, she does not require any formal qualification and she can learn on the job,? says Ruman Ghosh, whose daughter Riya, 16, will soon walk a ramp on Park Street.

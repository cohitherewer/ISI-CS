Chit Chat

Priyata Modi?s friends are still thinking up ways 

to earn pocket money, while this student fresh out of Modern High School is already 

planning on quick cash by playing the stock market.

 Harsh Gupta had always wondered why people were so dependent on chartered accountants to settle taxes. Now this second-year Bhawanipur College student is seriously contemplating launching an interactive online portal to clear all tax-related queries.

 Priyata and Harsh are among the 40 students who were selected from over 200 to attend the Millennium Youth Summer Camp. Launched five years ago, this five-week annual camp ?attempts to relate commercial and monetary realities to the theories puzzled over in traditional classrooms?, explained founder and teacher Bishnu Dhanuka. Sessions are conducted at Dhanuka House on Loudon Street thrice a week. Regular reading of financial newspapers to debating the Indian economic situation, these youngsters are set to gain expertise in all matters financial.

 ?The whole process is carried on in such a cool way and the camp is also free,? smiled Sidharth Bansal, an ex-Don Bosco student ready to leave for higher studies in the US. ?Initially, I thought it was going to be all boring classroom jargon. Now, for the first time, I feel involved in the economic matters of the country. And because I am beginning to understand inflation and stock market fluctuations, the pink papers make more sense.?

 The eye-opener was the concept presentation the students made last week. From selling bio-diesel to marketing water sports in Shankarpur, even Dhanuka was surprised by the latent entrepreneurial skills of the boys and girls. ?Sir has already asked us to procure licenses and start working on some of our ideas,? added Saket Tibrewal, whose plan of letting foreigners discover India at a multi-cultural resort near Bangalore drew praise.

 Dhanuka sees the summer camp as a platform where youngsters can shed their inhibitions, stage fright and inertia, and go from being mere consumers to participants contributing to society. Most importantly, he seeks to make them more sensitive towards their elders. ?When I asked these kids how big the communication gap between them and their parents was, they said there was no communication at all,? pointed out Dhanuka. ?The only way parents can guide and control these kids is to see things from their perspective. They should not try to keep the youngsters away from the pollution all around, but just ensure that they don?t cross the line.?

 He will be taking the students to Venom at the conclusion of the camp for some fun and frolic. But not before they have read and discussed Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki.

They are all of 11 years old, but their sweet-talk on air puts their guests at ease and lights up faces of kids who have their ears glued to the radio. Meet Haris Khan and Vidushi Agarwal ? the sweet yet confident voices of Red Dhamaal Explosive (RDX) every Saturday morning on Red FM. Haris is a student of Don Bosco Park Circus, while Vidushi is in Modern High School. The two kid radio jockeys (RJ) tell Young Metro how they pull off the live show with elan.

I used to listen to radio a lot and wanted to talk 

to everybody like the RJs do. I got selected through an audition.

How did you take to radio jockeying?

Vidushi: I used to listen to radio a lot and 

wanted to talk to everybody like the RJs do. I got selected through an audition.

How do you prepare before going on air?

Haris: I am given a script. I learn it and 

then start work. If I say something wrong by mistake, I usually make up for it 

by changing the topic.

What kind of guests do you have on your show?

 Vidushi: Four to 14-year-olds. If it is a particular occasion, the talk revolves around it. This Saturday, we had a Father?s Day special.

How do you cope with nervousness before the show?

Haris: I get nervous only when I make a mistake. 

The kids on my show are sometimes shy, scared, nervous or excited.

How does your family help you?

Vidushi: My brother studies in St Xavier?s 

College. He corrects me and helps me a lot. Recently, I had to talk on football 

though I don?t know anything about the sport. Bhaiyya helped me in every 

way to prepare.

What do you want to become when you grow up?

Haris: I want to become a doctor or someone 

like that and an RJ. I won?t stop RJing ever.

What are your hobbies?

 Vidushi: I like teaching, singing and dance.

Do the two of you compete on the show?

 Haris: Vidushi and I are equals on the show. 

We both try to make it better.

What do you do to take care of your voice?

 Vidushi: Of course I have ice creams and soft 

drinks. But at the very hint of a sore throat, I start drinking warm water, gargling 

and taking medicines.

A Chetna HIV/AIDS awareness seminar was held for students from five schools ? St Xavier?s, St Mary?s, St Augustine, Frank Anthony and Loreto House ? on June 18 at the St Xavier?s College auditorium. The event was organised by St Xavier?s School LTS (Leadership Training Service), unit of Zone C, in collaboration with Calcutta Samaritans and Emmanuel Ministries.

 According to a recent survey, conducted by these students under the guidance of teachers of St Xavier?s School Mini Joseph and P. Daniel, and Father Boris D?Santos (prefect, St Xavier?s School), the number of HIV-positives in the state is around 3.5 lakh. The projected figure is just the tip of the iceberg.

 Dr Prasenjit Saha from Calcutta Samaritans talked about the causes of AIDS and how to avoid it through methods abstinence, safe sex, etc, through an audio-visual presentation. He also informed the audience about the activities of the NGO with marginalised people at risk, including STI treatment, counselling, health check-ups, education, vocational training and awareness camps.

 Dr Saha later answered queries from the students. Barnik Ghosh, a Class XII student of St Xavier?s, said: ?I am stunned to hear that 5.7 million people are affected by the disease. It is time for us, the young generation, to act.?

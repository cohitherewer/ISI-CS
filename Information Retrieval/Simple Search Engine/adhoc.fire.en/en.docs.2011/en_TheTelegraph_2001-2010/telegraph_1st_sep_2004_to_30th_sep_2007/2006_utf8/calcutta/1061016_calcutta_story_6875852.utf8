 Cool role from cult film

 Slipping into Prans shoes for Farhan Akhtars Don, ARJUN RAMPAL talks to Pratim D. Gupta about the limp factor, his maiden production, and bagging Rituparno Ghoshs Devi Chaudhurani

 Arjun Rampal as Jasjit in Don

 Were you sceptical when Farhan Akhtar offered you Don?

 To be honest, it was more of a shock for me. It was Farhan who was sceptical at that point of time. But later he shared with me what exactly he had in mind. He told me that he felt I would be my best in a silent, intense role with a lot of brooding. And that was exactly what this character of Jasjit needed, played in the original by Pransaab.

 Are you a big fan of the original Don, too? 

 Arent we all? It was a cult film and all of us were touched by it in some way. The songs were so timeless. Even today when you hear Khaike or Yeh mera dil, it sounds so fresh. Then Mr Bachchan was phenomenal in the movie, which itself was so stylised and fun. So, it was quite cool to be part of the remake of such a film.

 Did you watch the film again before shooting for the new 

 Don?

 No, I didnt go back to the film. I stuck to the script written by Farhan. He was very clear in what he had set out to achieve. He told me that he was looking at the film as a tribute and not to outdo anybody. So, we all approached our characters as actors and although all the scenes, scenarios and even some of the dialogues were same as the original, we were not mimicking anybody.

 Jasjit is the only character Farhan has completely updated 

 in terms of look. Do you think Pransaab looked too 

 old in the original?

 I thought Pransaab did a wonderful job in the original. Everyone used to speak about his character. Even when the remake was being thought of, people would first ask: Whos gonna play Don? and the next question would be: Whos going to be Jasjit? I think Pransaab did well to play to the galleries. But we have got a different take altogether.

 The famous limp is still there

 Yes, the limp is very much there because you cant imagine Don without these small details. Theres Roma whos the martial experts and theres Jasjit with his limp. It adds to the overall impact of the character.

 Was it difficult to do all those difficult stunts with the 

 limp?

 Yes, it was difficult to do the action sequences with one leg. And I remember it was me who asked Farhan whether we really needed the limp. But he was right when he said that the limp thing has people sympathising more with this character. Farhan also gave me this really cool stick to play JJ.

 You have seen a test screening of the film. What is your 

 review?

 I am personally very happy with the film. I think Farhans done an outstanding job. I am sure everyone is waiting to draw huge comparisons with the old Don and we are aware of that. The highest pressure is, of course, on Shah Rukh. Mr Bachchan was so fantastic in the original Don But Shah Rukh has done it in his own style. Hes made the character very endearing, quite lovely. To sum up, I can say that if Don were to be ever remade, then it had to be made by this set of people.

 After Don, you make your debut as a producer

 Yes, we have already finished the film. Its called I See You and apart from me, it stars Sonali Kulkarni, Chunkey Pandey and Boman Irani. It should be out soon.

 And have the talks with Rituparno Ghosh worked?

 Yes, we have been in talks for a long time. I am finally doing Devi Chaudhurani with him. It stars Katrina (Kaif) and we should start shooting some time in January-February.

 Modern abstract art has found one of its finest exponents in Samindranath Majumdar, who portrays semi-familiar objects and images wrapped in an obscure, mysterious haze. Working mainly in acrylic, he applies paint in overlapping layers to give an impression of forms floating on a fluid, porous surface. In the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, he shows an overwhelming dependence on colour as atmospheric light. Heavily loaded with symbolic associations, his use of colour-tonalities for the evocation of feeling is reminiscent of Mughal art conventions and the style of Abanindranath Tagore, who closely studied and appropriated that tradition. The paintings on show also reflect Majumdar?s ambivalent stance to architecture, specially in its manifestation as monuments of human triumph. He admires their grandeur only in context of their vulnerability to the passage of time with forlorn structures exposed to enormous, imposing landscapes. Yet, caught in strange glows of illumination, they retain an aura of glorious invincibility.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Samindranath Majumdar 

When: Till April 16, 11 am - 7 pm

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Another 60 luxury buses to roll out

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a bid to boost public transport in the city, the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation will launch 60 more air-conditioned luxury buses.

 Forty such buses now ply in the city. Impressed by the revenue generated by them, the corporation has decided to expand the fleet.

 ?The buses are doing well. People find them both comfortable and affordable,? transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury said on Wednesday. ?Plans are afoot also to extend the services of these buses to destinations outside Calcutta,? he added.

 Of the 60 new buses that will be launched, some will ply outside the city. The probable routes include Siliguri-Guwahati, Calcutta-Siliguri, Calcutta-Jharkhand and Calcutta-Dankuni.

 The corporation will soon conduct a survey to ascertain the viability of running the buses on these routes.

 ?Till a decision is taken on routes outside Calcutta, the buses will ply on the usual routes, including airport to Tollygunge, Barasat to Garia, Salt Lake (Sector V) to Esplanade and Tollygunge to Howrah. While choosing the new routes, we will ensure that the business of other state buses do not suffer,? the transport secretary said.

 The corporation will spend Rs 15 crore for buying the buses. Each bus costs around Rs 20 lakh.

 The transport department, however, is worried whether it will get adequate land for setting up depots for the new vehicles. ?Without depots, it will be difficult to run the buses. Accommodating 100 buses is not a problem, except that the transport department depots are mostly in the hands of the unions. We are looking for land,? Choudhury said.

 The case of physical torture lodged by the father of six-year-old Varnika Gupta against a teacher of Our Lady Queen of the Missions school, in Salt Lake, has been withdrawn.

 In his complaint with Bidhannagar South police station on March 16, 2005, Hitesh Gupta had alleged that his daughter?s class teacher Ruma Pal had pulled out a tuft of the child?s hair because she had not taken her artwork to school in a carrybag.

 The school authorities had stood by Pal?s denial.

 ?With the charge being withdrawn and the teacher being discharged from the case, we wish to redeem the tarnished reputation of our school. We supported Pal because she is very good in dealing with the little ones,? principal of the school?s primary section Sister Mary Sebastian told Metro.

 Pal has been working in the school since it opened in 2001. ?She does not want to talk about this matter,? added Sister Sebastian.

 Varnika was in nursery when the incident occurred on March 15, 2005. She was then promoted to kindergarten but did not resume classes when the school reopened on April 4, post-vacation. ?She was taken out of school by the month-end, though we had no problems with her staying on,? the principal remarked.

 The Guptas were not available for comment. A lady at the Gupta residence, who refused to divulge her identity, said the entire family was ?out of station? and could not be contacted ?before a fortnight?. When asked about the withdrawal of the court case, she stated: ?Jo bhi hua, jhamela khatam hua. Ab chhod dijiye (Whatever happened, the trouble is over now. Let it be).?

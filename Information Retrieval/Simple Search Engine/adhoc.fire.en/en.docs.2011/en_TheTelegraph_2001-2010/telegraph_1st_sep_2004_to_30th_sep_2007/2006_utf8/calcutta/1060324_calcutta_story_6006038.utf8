The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta beckons back-in-action Bachchan

 PRATIM D. GUPTA

 Amitabh Bachchan

 Monday morning: Facing the arclights for the first time in four months at Yashraj Studios, Mumbai, for Karan Johar?s Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna.

 Tuesday to Saturday: Playing a zamindar for his make-up-man-turned-producer Deepak Sawant?s Bhojpuri film Ganga. Twenty-nine scenes to be canned at Film City, Mumbai.

 Sunday morning: Flying out to Calcutta for two brand endorsements.

 The Big B is busy again. And the man who loves referring to himself as the city?s ?jamai? has chosen Calcutta for his first long-haul commercial flight out of home after his diverticulitis-induced layoff.

 Amitabh Bachchan is coming to town on Sunday and leaving the morning after.

 After being operated upon at Leelavati Hospital on November 30, he had only been seen at religious sites ? Tirumala Dewasthanam in Tirupati (end-December), Akshardham temple in Delhi (end-January) and Sandapani Ashram in Porbandar (early February) ? outside Mumbai.

 He returned to the studios last month, first to record songs and dub dialogues, before plunging into a full shoot schedule from this week.

 And now, Calcutta?s calling. First up, Bachchan will be playing the part of brand ambassador for Emami.

 ?A couple of days back, Mr Bachchan?s office confirmed his visit to the city. He will be coming in on Sunday to share with the media his association with our group,? Aditya Agarwal, Emami director, told Metro.

 Coming in with his own team of security personnel, Bollywood?s biggest superstar will be putting up at the Taj Bengal, where he is scheduled to have a private lunch after the morning interactions.

 ?We haven?t been informed about his eating restrictions but I know that he prefers a simple vegetarian meal,? said Sujan Mukherjee, executive chef of Taj Bengal. ?He does have a sweet tooth and we will prepare something special.?

 In the evening, the 64-year-old will don the role of the Oye Bubbly man. ?He will meet and greet Pepsi loyalists,? confirmed a spokesperson of the soft drink Bachchan promotes.

 Vintage wow

 The period look isnt only about inspiration from the past and then putting it together for the present. The key to perfect it is to blend it well with the right contemporary elements, believes Neeta, the lady behind the Devdas dazzle. 

 Essential features, she says, is an elaborate style, a certain sense of unmatched magnanimity and over-the-top opulence.

 What you need is extensive knowledge of the period that you are trying to recreate as well as the right pulse of the fashion scene.

 Here are some of the style gurus secrets to attain the perfect period look:

 Think in totality, giving the clothes, jewellery 

and hair equal importance. 

 Play with a riot of colours, thinking bright 

is beautiful all the way. 

 Hindi cinema stands for larger-than-life. So 

does the period look, hence never compromise on the glamour factor. 

 Thorough research helps in a detailed think 

through the complete look.

 Concentrate on the yardage, giving elaborate 

authentic drapes special importance. 

 Pick up nuances from the particular culture 

and add it to your own sense of style. 

 Sari stunner

 No mini skirt and no bikini top can portray what a sari can, points out Neeta. No matter which country you belong to, a sari never fails to bring out your inner beauty, a fantastic feminine side that every woman has.

 Heres how you can achieve the right image in those sensuous nine yards: 

 Choose from white, green or black contrasted 

with gold.

 A simple, low black blouse looks the best with 

a sari. 

 Add interesting accessories like a bajubandh, 

a hair pin or large earrings.

 Leave your hair loose or don a gelled-back 

jooda.

 Darken your eyes and sport a light, glossy 

mouth. 

 Dont forget a tika ? be it large 

and dressy or a pretty, delicate bindi. 

 Trendy today

 A firm believer of the potential of Indian fashion, Neeta feels that India is no less than a Milan or Paris in terms of fashion.

 We are completely in sync or even way ahead of global fashion, believes the Bollywood favourite.

 Heres Neetas recipe for a rocking trendy look:

 Comfort is the key ingredient as far as western 

outfits go, hence be sure about your body language, stance and structure. Unlike 

a sari, comfort need not come naturally when you sport a trendy, western ensemble. 

 Stay away from outlandish filmi 

by keeping the embellishments and accessories minimal. 

 A basic white shirt and blue jeans should be 

complemented by funky bags and belts that showcase the seasons hot hues.

 Keep your tresses washed, blow-dried and fuss-free. 

 The make-up should centre around taupe or pretty 

shades of pink.

 Older bolder 

 The primary difference between the older womans style sense and her daughters is the colour palette. Also, I think classic styles look better on women than fads do, feels Neeta.

 Here are some tips for both an older power dresser and guidelines for the contemporary Indian looker:

 Choose muted colours for well-fitted shirts 

and tees. 

 Stick to basic cuts in trousers and jeans. 

Hema Malini effortlessly graduated from Kanjeevarams to cap-sleeve blouses 

with chiffons. Now she comfortably wears spaghetti-strap blouses and looks so 

graceful. 

 Neeta feels that the fine line between vulgar 

and elegant can be avoided by simple understanding of the figure. 

 Keep the make-up simple and the hair style 

neat. 

 Complement your look with delicate pieces of 

jewels and pearls.

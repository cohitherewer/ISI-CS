The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dabur jeans, 

 anyone?

 How the combination of opposites is 

 working wonders for Brand Buddha in Bengal rural and urban

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 I knew about the Scissors Berkley 

 story. But this was even more amazing. Let me tell you the 

 Scissors Berkley story first. This was many moons ago. The 

 cigarette market those days was very fragmented. What sold 

 in Punjab did not get shelf space in Haryana. In south India, 

 the brand that used to be the market leader was Scissors. 

 It offered smokers a strong smoke. Supporting the brand 

 was a campaign that said: ?Man of Action ? Satisfaction?. 

 The young macho image was supported by the icon of a man 

 on a motorbike.

 Strangely, even such a dominant 

 market leader did not sell very much outside Tamil Nadu 

 and Kerala. The brand to contend with in Karnataka was another 

 one from the same stable. The name was Berkley and its positioning 

 was exactly the opposite of Scissors. The advertisement 

 for Berkley portrayed a very serene natural setting and 

 said: ?Get the Taste of Mildness?.

 There is nothing unusual in this 

 story except the tailpiece. In those days, the tobacco blend 

 used for both the brands Scissors and Berkley were the same!

 I was reminded of this example 

 the other day after a gap of three decades. For those of 

 us who get informed by the morning paper and the evening 

 television that this election is about development in the 

 state, Brand Buddha has managed to convince many that the 

 ruling party is the best agent to develop this state. The 

 visual cues abound: flyovers and shopping malls, Sector-V 

 and multiplexes.

 I was looking at the results of 

 some opinion polls conducted by Star Ananda, the leading 

 Bengali news channel, about the ensuing elections. Among 

 other things, it asked the voters of Bengal why they would 

 vote for the party of their choice. The reasons were many 

 but none of them even obliquely hinted at the promised development 

 of the state. This is as it should be as the majority lives 

 in small towns and villages. Reaching Dalhousie from Salt 

 Lake in 10 minutes or buying Cool Water off the shelf are 

 not relevant experiences for them. It is hardly surprising 

 that they talked about drinking water and metal roads, electricity 

 and crop prices. The opinion poll also confirmed that the 

 Left vote bank amongst this segment of the state?s population 

 has remained where it was. To a political pundit this would 

 be basic knowledge. To me this implied a marketing achievement.

 In this election, it is the same 

 brand Left Front which is trying to market itself to voters, 

 both in the large towns and in the hinterland. Presumably 

 to both, the promise is the same. In one case they are offering 

 development translated in urban terms. In another case they 

 are talking in terms of issues relevant to the rural voter. 

 There is nothing extraordinary about that.

 In the case of Berkley and Scissors, 

 it was the same tobacco blend that was being positioned 

 in two different ways. Here, the brand is being positioned 

 uniquely but the benefits were being decoded appropriately 

 for the diverse segments. This is also on the beaten track.

 There is, however, a twist in 

 the tale. Both segments of voters eat out of the same plate. 

 Development costs money. The sum of money that is available 

 to the government is finite and constant. So you necessarily 

 need to rob Peter to pay Paul. The cost of a new flyover 

 can build a thousand tube wells or a hundred rural health 

 centres or quite a few kilometres of navigable roads.

 Credibly offering both as development 

 without making either segment of voter feel cheated is nothing 

 short of a marketing miracle. The issue was not only about 

 ensuring, in reality, the adequacy of development for both 

 the diverse constituencies. The challenge was to manage 

 their perceptions, humour their irrationalities. ?Pro poor? 

 and ?pro industry? do not cohabit easily. Can you imagine 

 a Pepsi Chyawanprash or Dabur jeans?

 Someone somewhere deserves to 

 walk away with the Marketing Man of the Year award.

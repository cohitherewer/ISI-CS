 Multiplex way for halls

 - Switchover rules to be relaxed to cut recurring losses

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Around 20 of the citys 82 cinemas are closed and many more are limping along, with the footfall dipping by the day.

 The prospect of the closed halls reopening and the rest shoring up their business may take an upturn, with the state government set to relax the rules for switchover of standalone halls to multiplexes.

 Weve decided to change the norms defining a multiplex, allowing two screens instead of the mandatory three, an information and culture department official said on Sunday. To draw more crowds, many city halls would like to convert to double screens and also set up eateries and commercial outlets under one roof. The changes are being worked on by the finance department.

 Multiplex tag will also enable the cinemas to enjoy tax benefits in the first three years of operation, though the state will have to amend the Amusement Tax Act for that. 

 To take care of another source of recurring losses, the cinemas will be allowed to bring down the number of seats which they are not allowed to do now once they switch to multiple screens.

 Most standalone halls have around 900-1,100 seats, of which around 80 per cent remain vacant on a weekday. Maintenance cost, however, remains the same. This makes running standalone halls increasingly difficult, said Arijit Dutta, vice-president of Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA).

 One reason why the halls could not switch to multiple screens, he pointed out, was the rule prohibiting the lowering of the number of seats.

 The managements of Khanna and Hind cinemas have already approached the government separately for the double-screen changeover.

 The EIMPA has recently pleaded with the government to relax the rules for setting up multiplexes, citing a similar order by the Rajasthan government. Bengal should walk in Rajasthans footsteps, observed Dutta.

 Conversion to two screens has been rewarding for Jaya cinema in Lake Town, pointed out Tapan Deb Banerjee, chairman of EIMPAs exhibitors section.

 Jaya now records almost 100 per cent occupancy on weekends. More shows and increased frequency are driving the footfall surge there, said Banerjee. Even refurbished halls have reported around 50 per cent hike in collection, he added.

 Officials said another reason that prompted the government to mull the double-screen multiplex idea is a proposal by Zee Telefilms Subhas Chandra to set up a chain of 43 two-screen plexes in Bengal.

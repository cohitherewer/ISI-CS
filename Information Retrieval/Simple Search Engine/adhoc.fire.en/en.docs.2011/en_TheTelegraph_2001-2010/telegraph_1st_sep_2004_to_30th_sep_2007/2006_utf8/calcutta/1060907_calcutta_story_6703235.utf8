What: Exhibition of saris and ready-to-wear 

garments at Central Cottage Industries Corporation of India Ltd (CCIC).

 Where: CCIC at S.N. Banerjee Road-Chowringhee crossing.

 When: Till September 29.

 Take a look: The central government undertaking, operating under the ministry of textiles, holds exhibitions of saris and ready-to-wear garments every year. If in summer the focus is on light cottons and casuals, in the pre-Puja show it lines up glamorous buys. What makes it special this year is a 10 per cent pre-Puja discount on all items.

 Favourites this year are silk and tussar saris with kantha stitch work from Santiniketan. These come in combos like kantha stitch with tie-and-dye or kantha stitch with sequins and beads. Sometimes, the typical kantha motifs are replaced by geometric designs and block-printed calligraphy. Colours of the base silk also varies from soft pastels like pinks and greys to rust and indigo.

 Designs of the patan patolla from Gujarat always give the impression of a Ganesha head, which is considered very auspicious and the best way to spot an original Gadwal (Andhra Pradesh) is to see if the border and pallu have been woven separately and then stitched together, advise CCIC salespersons. Balucharis on display are also unusual in their colours and sport scenes from Mahabharata to sober floral designs.

 There are kotkis from Orissa with checks, colourful bichitrapuri, hand batiks and block-printed soft silk and satin saris from Bangalore. Challenging the beauty of homespun tangails and dhonekhalis are the bagh and bagru block prints on cotton, cotton kotkis and gadwals. 

 Also on display at the CCIC are stitched garments for both men and women. Lucknow chikankari kurtas, cotton kurtas, shirts, silk ties, embroidered jackets and handkerchief sets are available for men. For women, there are cotton-silk tops and dupattas with mirror work, bagh prints, kantha stitch, etc. 

 Pocket pinch: The outfits start at Rs 137 and go up to Rs 2,600. Cotton saris cost between Rs 350 and Rs 3,500, while other drapes start from Rs 1,200 and go up to Rs 12,000.

 Voiceover: Its not just quality and range with which we are challenging our competitors, it is also the price. The silk threads we use for kantha work are desi, not the stiffer Korean variety used elsewhere and since we never use single threads our saris also last longer. While shops outside can barely afford 25-35 grams of silk, we ensure that on an average our customers get 40-50 grams, said M.K. Sengupta from CCIC.

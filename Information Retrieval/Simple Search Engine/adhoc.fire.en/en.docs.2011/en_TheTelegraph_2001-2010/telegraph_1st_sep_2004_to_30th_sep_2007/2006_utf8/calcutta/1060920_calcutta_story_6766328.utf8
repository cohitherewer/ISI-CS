Calcuttas pets will soon head the Tinkerbell 

way. After all, if Paris Hiltons pampered pooch can take a break from a 

hectic celeb schedule to get into the grooming grind, so can Calcuttas cats 

and dogs. With the opening of Paws, a pet salon and shop, that is.

Paws, a joint venture of Agnish Ghose and Castle Group, 

is located at 29/1A Ballygunge Circular Road near Tajaas. It takes up all 

of 150 sq ft, but then most good things do come in small packages. The red and 

canary yellow shop covers two levels the ground houses the pet shop and the 

mezzanine floor is reserved for vet visits and a grooming section. 

Berry Delight Shampoo, Oatmeal Shampoo with creamy 

buttermilk fragrance, Puppy Shampoo with gentle jasmine, Protein Lanolin Tearless 

Conditioning Shampoo, Frontline Spot On to tackle ticks and fleas, Oral Hygiene 

Kit, Puppy House Breathing Pads The list goes and on and on...

Other pet paraphernalia includes pregnancy test kits 

for dogs and cats, lint rollers, muzzles, collars, straps, chewies, toys, feeding 

bowls, Pedigree range of food, poop scoops, scrubbers, deos, sink-in beds, carriers 

and strawberry-shaped kitty tents.

The grooming section offers an extended list of services 

like shampoo, ear cleaning, hair cutting, nail clipping and overall grooming. 

Rates range from Rs 30 to Rs 900. Theres a shearing session for your Lhasa 

Apso or a shampoo for your spaniel or 

Paws also offers trainers certified by the Kennel 

Club of India for your pampered puppies and creche services with pick-up and drop. 

Our pet care centre is at Thakurpukur and we have various packages daily 

to monthly. We also have a stud farm where we will import puppies for sale, 

said Agnish. Dr Aparajita Chakraborty will be attending to pets every evening 

at the Ballygunge address.

Paws will offer state-of-the-art micro-chipping facility 

that will scan your dog for details like birth, de-worming and vaccination. It 

will also host a series of interactive programmes.

We want to help potential pet-owners. A software 

will guide them on which breed to buy according to their environment and space 

constraints. Nutrition charts will be provided and consultancy sessions too, 

said a spokesperson for Castle Group.

Annual membership fees at Paws is Rs 800, that includes 

two free shampoos and two vet check-ups every year and a 5 per cent discount on 

all products. Paws even offers free home delivery of goods within four-km radius 

for billing above Rs 500.

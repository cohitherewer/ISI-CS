 Arduous estrangement

 Presenting a marvellous blend of history and imagination, Yaadon Ke Bujhe Huye Savere takes the audience on a journey of emotional exploration and discovery of the painful paradoxes of life. Based on the unhappy, last days of Mughal emperor Shahjahan, the play vividly recounts the misery of the old king, abdicated from kingship and imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb. The Hindi adaptation of Ismail Choonaras A River Across the Unseen Divide, it faithfully reproduces the atmosphere of melancholy, which pervades the entire play. Gazing restlessly at the Taj Mahal, the magnificent edifice he had built to commemorate his love, Shahjahan is ironically haunted and tormented by memories of his glorious past. A note of tragic poignancy is struck when, on hearing the gentle murmuring of the Yamuna river, he fails to realise that it is the impediment between him and his desired destination. Direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala.

 Event: Play in Hindi, Yaadon Ke Bujhe Huye Savere, produced by Little Thespian

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 I want to enjoy every film

 You seem to be coming to Calcutta every second month

 Yes, my work brings me here. I have been coming here for quite some time now. Its a nice place and I love coming here.

 And now you are coming to shoot a film here, Rituparno Ghoshs 

 Devi Chaudhurani

 I dont know where that is going to be shot. I have not even been told that it will be in Calcutta and neither have we finalised the dates of the film yet. So, I am not sure where that will be shot.

 How did the project happen?

 Rituparno met me a few times in Mumbai and then he told me about this film. And I felt he is a kind of person whom I would like to work with.

 Is it an effort to be known as an actress?

 I think every type of cinema is important and one should keep in touch with the different kinds of cinema that is happening around you. Its good for you as an actor and its good for you to learn. So it was definitely something I wanted to do.

 Have you seen Rituparnos films?

 Yes I have. I think he has a particular style which is very interesting as an audience to follow and that is refreshing in the industry we work in.

 Your next big Bollywood release is Vipul Shahs Namaste 

 London

 We had a great time shooting that. It is entirely like my baby which I have worked so hard on. Its a really nice film. Its a young, fun, simple film, no action or spy thriller or anything. Its basically something which people should enjoy watching.

 You play a London girl in the film. Was it a kind of return 

 to roots?

 Yes, very much. It was very easy for me to try and use the different cultures around London in the context of the film. It was nice.

 This is your second film with Akshay Kumar after Humko 

 Deewana Kar Gaye. How do you find him as a co-star?

 His priority is always the scene and the content of it. He makes sure all of us are at our best when the scene happens and the film turns out as good as possible. He takes all that as his own responsibility, which is good.

 You are back with David Dhawan for Partner?

 David has become a very close friend after Maine Pyar Kyun Kiya. I was obviously going to do his film.

 And you are also doing Welcome with Anees Bazmee?

 Welcomes turned out to be a great script. It is really so funny. And even though its the same maker, it has nothing to do with No Entry.

 Are you consciously balancing serious and commercial cinema?

 It is important one should enjoy doing every film. And of all the films that were offered to me in the last few months, these are the ones I felt I would enjoy doing as an actress. Its not that I am trying to calculate one serious film, one comedy film The more options you have the more good films you can do and enjoy.

 Are you still working down south?

 No, I did it at the beginning because I thought it was a good thing to do at that time. Now it really has to be an extraordinary project for me to go and shoot down there. Because there is really no time.

 Any other Bollywood film you are doing?

 I am starting another film with Abbas-Mustan opposite Akshaye Khanna sometime next year.

 Any regrets for not doing Ram Gopal Varma Ki Sholay?

 No. It was genuinely and truly not possible. One thing people have to realise is that there are just 365 days in a year. Yes, our film industry is a wonderful place but sometimes there are delays. And once a film gets delayed your priority should always be the films that are on the floor. I have been working for seven months on all these films we talked about and I would want them to now come up and do well. Its really no point starting 10 new projects when the other ones are not getting completed. It basically comes down to what call you take at what point of time.

 Finally, are you going to dance with Salman for the first 

 time on the GIFA stage in Kuala Lumpur?

 See, at GIFA there will be Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, Priyanka Chopra and myself performing. I dont know why people are singling out us two. Nobody will be dancing together. Everybody has their own act.

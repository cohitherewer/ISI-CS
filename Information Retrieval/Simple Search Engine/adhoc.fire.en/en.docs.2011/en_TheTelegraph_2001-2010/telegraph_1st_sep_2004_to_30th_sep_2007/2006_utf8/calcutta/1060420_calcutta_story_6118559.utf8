 The growing number of pavement-dwellers in the city has furrowed civic brows. Residents and traders of various parts of Calcutta have complained to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) about the spurt in the number of pavement-dwellers. The vagrants are increasingly using the decorative guard rails and lamp posts installed by the civic body to hang up their belongings. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay has asked the chief engineer (conservancy) to prepare a status report on pavement-dwellers. As per a civic estimate, their number has crossed 10,000.

 The conservancy department holds police inaction responsible for the mushrooming of roadside settlements.

 Under the anti-vagrancy Act, it is illegal to live on the streets. There is a police department, headed by an officer-in-charge, to carry out operations against vagrants. But no drive has been undertaken in the past three years. 

 Ninety men and eight women were held in the last two drives, carried out by the enforcement branch of city police, in April 2003. Of them, 57 men and seven women were sent to the state government-run vagrants? homes in Liluah and Uttarpara. 

 The areas where most number of pavement-dwellers have put up include Strand Road, Colootola Street, CR Avenue, Madan Street, Moulali, APC Road, Park Circus, Ballygunge Phari and Gariahat. The pavements around the civic headquarters, too, have been taken up.

 According to civic conservancy officials, the pavement-dwellers are responsible for drug-peddling, theft of manhole covers, breaking of the railings of parks and gardens, car lifting and flesh trade. 

 Besides, pavement-dwellers are also known to pile up trash beside their shanties for sorting and selling to scrap dealers. This causes littering of the pavements.

 ?About 70 per cent of the newcomers on the pavements are either from Bangladesh or from the neighbouring states. They even use the road as their toilet,? said deputy-director of the civic solid waste management department Swapan Mahapatra. 

 Former CPM councillor of the New Market area Provakar Mondol said: ?Last year, I had submitted a mass petition to the previous mayor, requesting a drive against pavement-dwelling. No action was taken by the civic authorities.? 

 ?With the mushrooming of settlements on the pavements, the number of street children is growing by the day. It is now quite common to see street children begging in groups in front of shops and eateries on CR Avenue, Bentinck Street and Esplanade,? he added.

 The model puja of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2005, Behala Club, promises to take organisational efficiency to new heights this year. The puja, opposite Behala thana, has handed over the construction and running of the show to an event management company.

 The entire work is happening under a team of six experts. They are taking care of music and lights as well, said Bulbul Roy of the club.

 The outfit, called Sixth Sense, which built a stage for the Republic Day celebrations in Delhi this year, is going about things in an organised manner. They gave us an estimate for even the number of nails that they would require.

 What has struck the greatest chord with the organisers is the promise that if the expenditure exceeds the estimate by more than 10 per cent, the difference will be borne by the company.

 Last time, our budget grew to double the estimate that our theme-maker drew up initially. That almost crippled the club, recounted Roy.

 In terms of quality of work, too, the organisers are confident that teamwork will yield better results than the leadership of one, as is the case in most big pujas where a single theme-maker calls the shots. Each person is an expert in his own field. For instance, Subrata Majumdar, who is in charge of lights, won a Rajya Sangeet Nritya Akademi award last year, says Sanjoy Banerjee of Sixth Sense.

 The club is presenting the lifestyle of Gond and Bhil tribes, who live in the lap of nature. Painters from Madhya Prad-esh have done Pithora paintings under artist Partha Roys guidance, he said.

 One aspect that few theme-makers spare much time for is composer Balu Duttas responsibility. He has recreated the music of Gondwanaland, based on an album brought out by the Madhya Pradesh government, to suit open-air surroundings. 

 If Sixth Senses maiden Puja effort is successful, others might take the cue in a bid to introduce more method to the festival madness.

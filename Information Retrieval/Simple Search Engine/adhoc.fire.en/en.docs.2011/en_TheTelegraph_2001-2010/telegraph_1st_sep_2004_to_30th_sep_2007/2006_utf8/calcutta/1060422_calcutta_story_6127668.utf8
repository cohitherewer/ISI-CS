 Poll vehicle delay sparks road clash

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A day before the Assembly polls in Howrah, Kona Expressway turned into a battlefield on Friday morning as a large group of poll personnel clashed with local residents near Santragachhi railway station, four km from Vidyasagar Setu. 

 The poll workers, all of them government employees or schoolteachers, had assembled on Kona Expressway to be ferried to the election booths where they have been asked to serve on Saturday.

 They started arriving with their luggage at six in the morning. The district administration was supposed to provide the transportation.

 When there was no sign of any state vehicle even at 8.30 am, the poll personnel became restive. Some of them started squatting on the road. Before long, more joined the impromptu blockade, which held up public transport on the road.

 This irked the local residents, many of whom were headed for Calcutta. 

 Among those stranded were school and college students, too. The annoyed youths resorted to violence.

 ?On April 14, during an election training exercise, the staff of the additional judicial magistrate?s office had asked us to reach Santragachhi station by 6.30 am on Friday. They told us we would be taken to Uluberia,? said Ashoke Mondal, who works in a government press.

 ?I have come all the way from Diamond Harbour early in the morning. Is there any guarantee that we won?t be showcaused by the Election Commission if we do not report on time?? he thundered.

 ?It is the poll personnels? problem if they do not get a vehicle to take them to their destination. Why did they stop hundreds of students and office-goers from attending to their work?? questioned Santragachhi resident Asim Ghorui.

 By 9.30 am, the blockade had ground to a halt the traffic towards Calcutta, as well as that headed for the national highway approach.

 The clash started around that time. Within minutes, local youths, with bamboo sticks in hand, chased a section of the poll personnel to the Santragachhi station. 

 Some of the poll workers caught a train that was leaving the station and fled. 

 The pandemonium continued till 10 am, when officers of Sankrail police station arrived on the spot in a jeep. The cops dispersed the local residents and forced the poll personnel to lift the blockade. The policemen also arranged transport for the latter.

 Soon after, the traffic movement resumed.

 Teen death stays mystery

 - Father complains of foul play, police look for absconder 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sohail Chaudhury, 18, regained consciousness late on Thursday, after recovering from unknown poisoning and narrated a chain of events to investigating officers that threw up more questions than answers.

 Not convinced with his account, New Alipore police station is exploring several angles to unravel the mystery death of Deepesh Singh, 18, alias Chintu, a resident of Rai Bahadur Road, in Behala.

 Deepeshs father Arun Singh has lodged a complaint of foul play. He had earlier claimed Sohail had borrowed Rs 50,000 from Deepesh and failed to return it.

 According to Sohail, he left his New Alipore flat in Block G late on Wednesday and drove his Opel Astra to Deepeshs paan shop opposite Alipore Mint, on Diamond Harbour Road. Deepesh was asleep in the shop. 

 They were joined by Suraj Singh, who works in a nearby roadside garage, and the trio went for a drive.

 Sohail said they first went to Park Street and bought some potato chips and bhujia and then went to Ballygunge, where they bought two bottles of water from a dhaba and returned to his New Alipore garage around 2.45 am, said an officer.

 The teenager claimed they had not consumed alcohol. After a while, Suraj left but Deepesh and Sohail remained in the car. We both fell unconscious, he told police.

 They were discovered sitting unconscious in the car and rushed to CMRI, where Deepesh was declared dead. Sohail was admitted in the intensive care unit.

 Police are probing whether carbon monoxide from the exhaust pipe had sneaked into the car. According to Sohails mother Nina Chaudhury, the windows of the car were rolled up and the AC was still running. 

 But when the door was opened, the boys were found unconscious, sweating and frothing from the mouth, and the car was stuffy and hot.

 Police are also looking at a possible drug overdose angle. The real picture will only emerge once we get the post-mortem and viscera reports, said P.K. Banerjee, assistant commissioner handling the case. He stressed the importance of tracing Suraj, who is absconding.

 Police, meanwhile, said Sohail was a Class IX dropout, who splurged on friends like Deepesh and Suraj.

 Bending it with Beckham or kicking around with Kaka, backing the Blues of Mourinho or rooting for the Reds of Rafa. You could soon do all that on home turf.

 Sportswear giant Adidas, official partner to Fifa till 2014, is keen to fly in English Premier League (EPL) champions Chelsea or last season?s Champions League winner Liverpool to Calcutta, besides bringing down some of its iconic brand mascots, for exhibition matches and promo clinics.

 ?We are now apparel sponsors of Chelsea and Liverpool and in the next two years, we could have one of these top teams playing here. There?s a growing EPL fan base in the country, nowhere more so than in Calcutta,? Andreas Gellner, managing director, Adidas India Marketing Pvt Ltd, told Metro.

 Gellner said contemporary football gods like Beckham or Zidane, Kaka or Ballack, who endorse Adidas products worldwide, could come and ?interact with city kids, show them some tricks, talk about intrinsic elements of the European game and generally excite and energise these children about football?.

 Adidas, which was instrumental in getting Bayern Munich to Calcutta, is also commercially associated with AC Milan and Olympic Marseille, besides Chelsea and Liverpool. Most of these clubs now routinely tour East and Southeast Asia as pre-season promo, and the retail major is exploring possibilities of tying in an Indian leg, with Calcutta as a ?sure stop?.

 Following the ?very positive response? to the Calcutta leg of its +Challenge (under 16) football tournament, Adidas, official partner, supplier and licensee of World Cup 2006, is lining up a foray into the grassroots level.

 ?All big brands are now looking at alternatives to cricket in India, which is supersaturated, and what better alternative than football? We want to take the +Challenge success story forward by going to schools, tying up with existing academies or even working with the AIFF (All India Football Federation),? Gellner declared.

 Adidas, which recently unveiled its first flagship store, a 9,000-sq-ft outlet in Bangalore, is scouting for property to replicate the swank format in Calcutta. A ?testimony to the confidence? in the local market, it will be geared to offer ?experiential shopping, addressing all the senses?, with customised and programmed music, smell management, clear sight lines and smart visual signage.

 ?As soon as we can identify the right location (offering 6,000 to 8,000 sq ft of space), we will bring our flagship store to Calcutta,? stressed Gellner.

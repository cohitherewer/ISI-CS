 Machher jhol in war zone

 - Been there, done three stints of strife

 Monimala Basu: Eye on Iraq. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 Monimala Basu wears her 44 years lightly. Clad in a black shirt, three-quarter jeans, with chunky silver bangles clanging on her left hand as she sits cosily in her uncles Ballygunge Circular Road flat, Basu doesnt look like she has done three stints in war-torn Iraq. 

 A reporter with Atlanta Journal Constitution for the past 16 years, she first visited Iraq in 2002 when Saddam Hussein was in power. We knew that war was going to be declared, but it was still safe to be out on the streets for a woman, without a burqa, and with hair open, said Basu, in town recently on her yearly visit.

 That changed in April 2003. There were lots of stories. Iraqi society was opening up for the first time in 22 years. But the people were wary of speaking. Even if they did, you had to decide whether to put them in, because it might compromise your subject. We spoke to a guy who had hidden a satellite dish in his house for years, waiting for the day when Saddam would go, she recalled.

 Last year, Basu returned as an embedded reporter with a unit of the Georgia Armed National Guards, staying with them at Camp Striker, a section of the airport being used by the US army. 

 Death was a common sight as she travelled through the ravaged towns of Basra, Najaf, Naziria and Faluja. There would be bodies lying on the streets. You take these in your stride. But if you become immune to human suffering, you can no longer write about it.

 Being a woman, and of Asian origin, helped. I was perceived as less of a threat. She and photographer Bita were welcomed into homes. Iraqis are like Indians in their hospitality. It was food that brought her in touch with Ganesh Sarkar, of Nadia, who worked in the army mess. I got to eat rice with dal, begun bhaja and machher jhol in Iraq, she chuckled. Her work has fetched her the Journalist of the Year Award in Atlanta.

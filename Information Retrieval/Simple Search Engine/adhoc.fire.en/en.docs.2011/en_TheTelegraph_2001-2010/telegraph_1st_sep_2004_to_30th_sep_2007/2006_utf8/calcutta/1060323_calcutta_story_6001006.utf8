 Missing file tally 800

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Not 100, as the police had initially estimated, but as many as 800 files are missing from the mandamus section of Calcutta High Court.

 This came to light on the second day of the detective department probe on Wednesday. The files mainly contained orders issued to government departments.

 A senior officer working on the case said at least 450 files, containing orders on land-related issues, are missing from one rack. ?The rest, stacked on 11 other racks, were on education and other matters related to both the Centre and the state governments.?

 A preliminary probe revealed that the culprits had entered the mandamus section ? the ?safest corner on the premises, located in the basement of the Centenary Building? ? through a ventilator. 

 ?The cover of a ventilator was found broken,? said an employee of the mandamus section. The sleuths, he added, interrogated employees.

 Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar visited the section early on Wednesday. Deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department Gyanwant Singh went to the court later in the day and met the chief justice. 

 ?Investigation is on. We are trying to find out who removed the files and why,? Singh said in the evening.

 High court officials refused comment. ?It will not be proper for us to comment till the probe is over,? said an official.

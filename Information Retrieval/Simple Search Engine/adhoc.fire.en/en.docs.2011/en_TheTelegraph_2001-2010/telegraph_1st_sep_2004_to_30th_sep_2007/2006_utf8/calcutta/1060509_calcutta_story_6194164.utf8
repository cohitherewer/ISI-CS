 Enrol in a nine-month diploma course at Jadavpur University and become an entrepreneur.

 The course, Creating Entrepreneurs in New Business Environment, is the first of its kind in the country, making it mandatory for each and every student to work towards setting up his/her own business.

 Regular classes for the course, to be conducted by the Centre for Quality Management System (CQMS), will start from July 19.

 CQMS coordinator Sadhan Kumar Ghosh said the course aims at addressing the need for ?a well-groomed and quality-conscious band of young entrepreneurs in the new era of globalisation?. 

 The nine-month course has been divided into three semesters. The first semester will comprise theoretical classes and the second, practical sessions (during which the students will be taken to various industrial units and service centres).

 In the last three months, the students will work towards becoming entrepreneurs themselves, so that when they come out of the university they own a manufacturing unit or a service centre.

 The tuition fee is Rs 45,000. The students will have to pay Rs 30,000 during admission and the rest after the first semester.

 Of the 90 seats, 40 are reserved for those with an undergraduate degree/diploma. The other students will have to have cleared Higher Secondary. The applicants will have to take a written test. The successful ones will sit for an interview for the final screening.

 In designing the course, the university has roped in management professionals, engineers, chambers of commerce and banks.

 According to Ghosh, two banks have agreed to provide loans to the students. Former students of the university who are now successful entrepreneurs will be involved with the course.

 The university will help students get bank loans and licences, and also offers its expertise in building a marketing chain.

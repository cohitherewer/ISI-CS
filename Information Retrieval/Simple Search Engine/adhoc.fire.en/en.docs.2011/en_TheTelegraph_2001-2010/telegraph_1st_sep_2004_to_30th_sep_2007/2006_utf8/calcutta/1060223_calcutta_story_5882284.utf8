 Bail denied in kidnap case

 Mohit Srivastav: mock abduction claim turned down

 The key accused in the Mini Kanodia abduction case, Mohit Srivastav, was denied bail by Calcutta High Court on Wednesday. Two of his associates, however, were granted bail.

 The division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice S.K. Gupta passed the judgment after additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami submitted that Mohit had secured the help of his friends by claiming that he had an affair with Mini.

 Goswami also told the judges that Mohit had claimed that he had married Mini in November last year and produced a registration certificate to prove that.

 Mini had deposed before a trial court that she had no relation with Mohit and that her signature on the marriage certificate was forged.

 Even the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, in a communication to Hastings thana, said the signature on the marriage certificate was forged.

 On December 10, five days before her scheduled wedding with Vikas Kanoria, Mini was allegedly abducted from Vidyasagar Setu. 

 The next morning, police found her having tea with Mohit and two of his friends ? Devaki Nandan Bhojak and Santosh Sharma ? in a warehouse on Kalakar Street, in the Burrabazar area.

 Mohit had claimed that he had married Mini on November 22 last year and that the abduction had to be staged as Mini?s parents were opposed to the marriage.

 Mini herself had admitted before police that whatever Mohit had said was true. But her father lodged an abduction complaint, prompting police to arrest Mohit and his two friends.

 Apparently police, too, came round to the view that Mohit, who used to run a telephone booth on the ground floor of the building in which the Kanodias live, had an affair with Mini. 

 But later, when Mini was produced in a metropolitan magistrate?s court as witness, she denied having ever been involved with Mohit. The statement turned the case against the accused. 

 ?Mini?s statement in the trial court has only strengthened the charges against Mohit. For the sake of investigation, the court should not allow Mohit?s bail prayer,? the additional public prosecutor argued on Wednesday.

 Lawyers appearing for Mohit claimed that he had chalked out the abduction plan in collusion with Mini. ?Mini did not put up any resistance and just walked into the car during the abduction,? they claimed.

 ?We thought the investigating agency would place the facts before the high court today. It?s well known that Mini did not tell the truth in the trial court,? a lawyer said.

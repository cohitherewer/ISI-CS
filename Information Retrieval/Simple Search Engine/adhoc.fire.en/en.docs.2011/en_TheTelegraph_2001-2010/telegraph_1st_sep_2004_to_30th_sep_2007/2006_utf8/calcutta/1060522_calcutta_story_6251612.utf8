 Transport facility plus homes, mall

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 The government has teamed up with a consortium of two Hyderabad-based companies to build an integrated transport complex on a 250-acre plot in New Town, Rajarhat. The project will cost Rs 1,500 crore.

 According to the plan, 50 acres will house a truck terminal, with facilities to park at least 500 trucks. Warehouses, wholesale markets, weigh bridges, petrol pumps, emission test centres, rest houses, eateries and entertainment centres will be part of the terminal.

 Adjacent to the facility will be a terminal for long-distance buses. Private bus operators can avail of the services too.

 The complex, named Paribahan Nagar, will include showrooms for new and old cars, commercial vehicles, vehicle-repairing and servicing centres and spare parts stores.

 On 100 acres, there will be residential and commercial estates for all economic groups. A lake, playgrounds, schools, a shopping mall, cinema halls, an auditorium and cultural centre will complete this portion of the complex.

 The different wings of the transport department will be shifted to the office block within the complex, once it is completed. The project will be a joint venture of Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (TIDC) and a consortium of Southern Engineering Works and Prasad Infrastructure Development.

 The companies will invest the entire cost of the project, while TIDC will assist in procurement of land and provide administrative and other support.

 ?Land acquisition has begun. We expect to start work after the monsoon. Our plan is to complete the project within three years,? said director of the consortium Prabir Roychowdhury.

 ?We opted for joint venture as the government is not in a position to invest such a huge amount of money. We picked up the consortium through open tender,? said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 As part of the deal, the consortium will build a 10-lane road from Jessore Road to New Town at its own cost.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Judge in car jam hauls up top cop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 In a throwback to the flashpoint reached between Justice Amitava Lala and the police three years ago, a Calcutta High Court judge on Thursday hauled up Calcutta Police for allowing political rallies to block thoroughfares and disrupt traffic flow.

 Justice Pranab Chatterjee came down heavily on Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner (north), for allowing members of the Democratic Students Organisation (DSO) to hold a rally in the College Street area where the judge was scheduled to attend a function and paralyse traffic in north and central Calcutta.

 I want to know from the deputy commissioner whether she had information that a programme had been arranged to celebrate the 144th foundation day of University Institute Hall. Many dignitaries, including high court judges, will be attending the programme in the prestigious hall. How can a political rally be allowed in the area? demanded Justice Chatterjee.

 Deputy commissioner Sen had come to court for the hearing of a tenancy dispute case under Burtola police station. But she ran into a judge riled by the chaos on the streets.

 Spotting her in the courtroom, Justice Chatterjee addressed the government lawyer representing Sen and said: The rally has caused a lot of traffic jam in the College Street area. Many commuters, including myself, have suffered. I was trying to contact the deputy commissioner over cellphone, but it was switched off. What was she doing when the people were being harassed in the area she controls?

 The judge then asked Sen to wait for her case to be heard. The wait stretched beyond an hour.

 On September 29, 2003, after Justice Amitava Lalas car had been held up in a rally, he had summoned the then deputy commissioner (traffic) to court and directed that no rally be allowed to disrupt traffic on city streets. 

 Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic), played down the judge-versus-police action replay but admitted that the DSO rally from College Street to RR Avenue and the meeting of the labour wing of the Trinamul Congress, attended by Mamata Banerjee at Esplanade, had thrown traffic out of gear from 2 pm to 5.30 pm.

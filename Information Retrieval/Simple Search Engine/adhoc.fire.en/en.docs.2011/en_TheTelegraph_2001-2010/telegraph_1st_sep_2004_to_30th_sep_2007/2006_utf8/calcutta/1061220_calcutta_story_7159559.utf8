 Communication crisis

 One of the most unfortunate problems dogging the modern, civilized world is its slow, but steady breakdown of familial relationships. Focussing on the causes of weakening of inter-personal ties despite the closeness and intimacy of our daily lives, the fifth days perfomance of Nandikars ongoing 23rd National Theatre festival features two socially-relevant plays, Wapsi and Sankramana, produced by Sambhav, Delhi. Written by Hari Prakash, Wapsi is the story of a son and his parents, of their conflicting lifestyles and strained relationship. Kamta Naths Sankramana is a performance divided into three monologues of father, son and mother. This story, too, dwells on the interplay of emotions of each member of the family vis--vis the others. Direction: Devendra Raj Ankur.

 Event: Plays (Hindi) Wapsi and Sankramana by Sambhav, Delhi 

When: Today at 6 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts

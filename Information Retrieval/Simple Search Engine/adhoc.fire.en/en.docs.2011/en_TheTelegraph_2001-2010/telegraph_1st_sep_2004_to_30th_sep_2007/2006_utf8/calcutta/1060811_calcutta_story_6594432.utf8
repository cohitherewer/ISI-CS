The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CU Part II results declared

 - Delay in admission process to push back start of courses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II results of Calcutta University (CU) were announced on Thursday, much to the relief of candidates planning to continue their education outside the state. 

 The deadline for submission of graduation marksheets in most universities outside Bengal is only days away.

 The declaration of results will, however, not mean an early start to CUs postgraduate courses. The process of publishing advertisements in newspapers, seeking applications from students, began only on Thursday afternoon. 

 Publication of such advertisements is mandatory. They are generally brought out before the announcement of the Part II results or on the day the results are announced. This year, the advertisements will be published on Friday.

 Unlike in the past few years, when the distribution and submission of prospectus and admission forms began on the day of the publication of the advertisements, the CU authorities on Thursday decided to start distributing and receiving forms from August 17. The process will continue till August 25.

 The students who visited the university campuses to inquire about the distribution of admission forms were told that it is not certain when the forms would reach the sales counters. 

 We will unnecessarily have to wait a week, rued Anirban Dutta, a student who wants to apply for a seat in the universitys physics department. 

 Officials stated as a result of the delay in admission, MA, M.Sc and M.Com classes will not begin before September 23, barely a week before the Puja vacation. Classes in most universities outside Bengal have started.

 Pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das said: We are trying to start the admission procedure at the earliest so that we can begin the classes by the second week of September. 

 He added that the details of the admission procedure for the postgraduate courses in arts and commerce have been posted on the CU website, from where the students can also download the admission forms.

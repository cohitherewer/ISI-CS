 Unable to resolve the dispute with the defence ministry regarding reopening of Eden Gardens, the state forest department has decided to request the chief minister to intervene in the matter.

 Forest minister Ananta Roy will request Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to write to the defence minister, asking him to settle the issue within a week. 

 We have tried our best to reopen the garden. The officials have written to their counterparts in the Union ministry a number of times, but to no avail. Therefore, we have turned to the chief minister, said Roy at Writers Buildings.

 The forest minister held a meeting with his department officials at the state secretariat on Monday to reach a consensus on the issue. It was unanimously decided that the chief minister would be requested to resolve the matter.

 Early this year, Calcutta High Court had instructed the state government to open the garden to the public following a public interest litigation by activist Subhas Dutta. The government did not take any initiative. 

 The garden belongs to the defence ministry, but is maintained by the forest department. The main point of conflict is a Rs-2 entry fee. The defence ministry told the forest department that the garden should not be used for commercial purpose. It was closed in March 2005. 

 The idea behind the fee was to regulate entry into the garden. It was not introduced for a commercial purpose. We have tried to make the defence ministry understand our point of view, but failed, stated deputy conservator of forests (urban forestry) Somnath Mukherjee.

 Department officials said the dispute will not come in the way of the annual flower show, from January 25 to January 28, 2007.

 Laptop-lifter gang afoot 

 KINSUK BASU

 The next time you step out of your car after locking the doors, make it a point to carry along your laptop or even the briefcase. Or else, you might find it missing on return, though the locks will still be intact.

 A trifle difficult to believe? Ask Shantanu Som, of Behala. 

 On May 8, Som parked his Fiat Uno opposite Peerless Inn and stepped out briefly, leaving his laptop on the front seat. As he left, the driver immediately pulled up the glasses, locked the doors and went away to relieve himself, informing the man supervising the parking lot. 

 On his return, Som found everything in place, except the laptop. ?It?s a mystery to me. The doors were locked and nothing was either broken or tampered with. Only the notebook was not there. It was indispensable, as I had stored several crucial data about our company in it,? says Som. 

 He does not suspect the driver, as ?he has been with me for years?. 

 Som is not the only victim of such thefts, according to records at New Market police station. The same day, a man named Dilip Gupta found his laptop missing from his car parked near New Market.

 A few days earlier, a couple had lodged a similar complaint with the same police station.

 ?The gang at work has the expertise of opening car locks and lifting items almost in a twinkle. A few raids have been carried out in search of the culprits. We need some time to round them up,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central).

 If figures from police stations are any indication, even briefcases and bags have gone missing from cars, either locked or left with drivers in parking lots.

 ?At times, the gang will divert the attention of the driver by dropping a few currency notes in front of the car and raising an alarm. It happened in one case on Russell Street early this month. As the driver stepped out to figure out if the notes belonged to him, the gang members opened the locks of rear doors and picked up the briefcase,? said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 At least two such cases were reported with Park Street police station, too.

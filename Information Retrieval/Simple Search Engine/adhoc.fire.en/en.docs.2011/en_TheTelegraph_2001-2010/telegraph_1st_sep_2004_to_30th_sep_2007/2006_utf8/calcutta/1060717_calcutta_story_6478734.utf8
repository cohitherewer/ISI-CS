The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Courses, centres for tech training 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Information technology (IT) training major NIIT is gearing to introduce a host of programmes in West Bengal. 

 The Delhi-based company, with a turnover of $160 million, recently opened its 17th centre in Calcutta. It will be opening centres in Dunlop and Kankurgachhi soon.

 ?NIIT was the first to set up an IT training centre in Calcutta. Eastern India has always been a commercially viable market for us. We have 97 centres in the region and will increase our presence here steadily,? said NIIT vice-president Tulika Sinha.

 The flagship course of the company, GNIIT, has been revamped. NIIT will also offer international certification programmes in alliance with companies like Intel, Citrix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sun Microsystems.

 ?There has been a significant shift in the profile of students over the past two to three years. There is a pressing need for increase in interaction between industry and the academia. NIIT will update its programmes regularly and provide curriculum support to engineers and software personnel to meet the demands of the industry,? stated Sinha.

 The company, which had been in talks with the Bengal government to establish a university in the state, now plans to set up its campus in Rajasthan or on the outskirts of Gurgaon. ?Things did not work out here as planned,? remarked Sinha.

 Dacoits clean out cell shop 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A gang raided a cellphone store in one of the busiest pockets of Howrah town on Tuesday night and decamped with at least Rs 80,000.

 The criminals broke open the four locks of the shutters of the Reliance WebWorld centre on MG Road, in the Howrah Municipal Corporation Stadium complex.

 ?They broke open the cash box, a steel almirah and smashed the showcases. The almirah contained mobile handsets,? said Rahul Chowdhury, manager of the store.

 ?According to the complaint, Rs 80,000 was stolen from the cash box,? said Akhil Kumar Roy, superintendent of Howrah police. ?We are taking help of forensic experts to identify the culprits.?

 The store authorities, however, fear the loot was much more than what has been recorded. ?The outlet has been sealed, so we can?t assess the loss. The almirah that was broken contained several mobile handsets. The burglars might have taken them as well,? said an employee of the store.

 The outlet was closed at 8.30 pm on Tuesday. A sweeper turned up around 9 am on Wednesday and noticed that the shutters had been bent and a gap made between the base of the shutters and the ground.

 He immediately informed the manager, who rushed to the site and discovered the theft.

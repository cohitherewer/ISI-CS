 Bees fly by so close that you fear they will sting you. Rocks explode and you duck instinctively, only to realise it?s just a movie.

 ?True 3D? is coming to the city next week ? not at a theatre near you, but at a museum. Birla Industrial and Technology Museum (BITM) is set to unveil its three-dimensional theatre with a mission to Mars.

 ?This will be the first of its kind, high-resolution 3D theatre in the country,? said Jayanta Sthanapati, director of BITM. While Science City also has a 3D viewing system, the quality is not comparable in any way, Sthanapati added.

 The 25-seater auditorium on the second floor of the museum on Gurusaday Road has an 8 ft by 6 ft screen and 5.1 Dolby sound system. Set up at a cost of Rs 52 lakh, the equipment has been provided by Belgian projection specialist Barco.

 ?The stereoscopic image makes objects come out of the screen and you almost reach out to touch them,? offered Manoj Bhatia, a Barco business partner. Engineers from Barco?s Belgium and Noida offices came down to set up the system. Special circular polarised glasses will be required for the viewer to experience the 3D effect.

 BITM plans to throw the doors of the 3D theatre open to public on February 2. ?We have obtained a licence from Barco to show a film on Mars exploration for one year, after which we will choose a different movie,? said Sthanapati. There will be a Rs-10 ticket for the 10-20 minute show. ?The idea is to emphasise on the educational aspects and 3D will help students learn the concepts better,? offered Sthanapati.

 The new theatre is part of National Council of Science Museums?s plans to upgrade all its centres, including BITM. ?The museum celebrates its golden jubilee in 2009, and we will be remodelling all our 11 galleries. We will also add new elements, like the 3D theatre,? Sthanapati summed up.

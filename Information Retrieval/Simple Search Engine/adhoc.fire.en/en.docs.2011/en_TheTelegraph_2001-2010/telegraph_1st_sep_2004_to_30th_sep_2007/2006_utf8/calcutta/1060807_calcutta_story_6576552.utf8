 Rs 21.75 teacher too poor to move apex court

 Teacher Pranab Kumar Sengupta, who has been drawing a salary of Rs 21.75 per month since he joined a primary school in Patipukur on May 21, 1973, has run out of funds to continue the legal battle against the state government. 

 The governments refusal to carry out repeated court orders, asking it to regularise Senguptas service, had prompted the teacher to file a second contempt petition in the high court earlier this year. The petition has yet to come up for hearing. 

 Sengupta filed the first contempt petition in 1995.

 In March this year, Justice K.J. Sengupta of the court had asked the education department to ratify the teachers service with effect from the date he had joined Basakbagan Primary School and disburse his dues within six months. 

 Justice Sengupta, in his order, had also asked the district primary school council to pay the teacher Rs 34,000 as cost of the case. The judge even directed the education department to pay Sengupta his current salary.

 But due to some unknown reasons, the second contempt plea is not coming up for hearing. I am sure my client will get justice from the Supreme Court. To fight a case in the countrys apex court is quite expensive. At least Rs 30,000 is needed to fight the case in the Supreme Court. My client has no money. Now, he will have to beg to fight the case, said advocate Saibalendu Bhowmik, who has been fighting the cases for free for the past 12 years. 

 The state government is a habitual violator of court orders. A division bench had passed a similar order in 1995. But the department, instead of obeying the order, continued the battle. This time, my petitioner will go to the Supreme Court if the government flouts the order again, he added.

 Since joining the school as an assistant teacher, Sengupta has received his actual salary only for a month in 2004, after Justice Sengupta directed that the pay of the chairman of the North 24-Parganas primary school council would remain attached till the teachers salary was paid.

 In 1995, the high court had ordered the education department to regularise the teachers service and pay his dues with retrospective effect from 1973. 

 The then school education secretary informed the court two years later that the order had been carried out. But Sengupta is still moving from one court to another with the contempt petition in hand. 

 Education department clerks are not impressed by the court orders. Dont show us a court ruling. If you want your job and your dues, you will have to pay Rs 60,000, was what the 55-year-old Sengupta was told when he went to the primary school council with the order after the 1995 verdict.

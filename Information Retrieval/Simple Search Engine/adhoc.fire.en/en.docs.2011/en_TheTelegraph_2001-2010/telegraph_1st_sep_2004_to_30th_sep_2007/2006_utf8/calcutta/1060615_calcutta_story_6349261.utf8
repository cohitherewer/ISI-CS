 Dentist fined for neglect

 - Patient dies 48 hours after surgery

 SANJAY MANDAL

 The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has slapped a Rs 2-lakh fine on a city-based dental surgeon for medical negligence leading to the death of a patient. 

 Usha Ray, 51, wife of Sukumar Ray, an officer of the Central Statistical Organisation, New Delhi, died 48 hours after being operated upon by B.K. Biswas in August 2000. She had been suffering from toothache when she came to Calcutta in August 2000. She had consulted a dentist in Delhi, who had advised an X-ray of the affected teeth and their extraction.

 In Calcutta, Usha?s toothache worsened, so she visited Biswas?s clinic on August 8, 2000. After seeing the X-ray report, Biswas, too, advised extraction of the teeth.

 On August 10, Usha was operated upon in Biswas?s clinic. As soon as she was locally anaesthetised, she started complaining of a severe headache and chest pain. ?However, the doctor did not refer her to a specialist for a check-up,? Sukumar Ray alleged in his petition. Biswas gave her another injection and after five minutes, the pain subsided. Three of Usha?s teeth were extracted in the two-and-a-half-hour operation. 

 After her death, Ray filed a case demanding compensation of Rs 15 lakh. According to him, the doctor had not made any allowance for Usha?s high blood pressure, even though she was suffering from the condition for 15 years. He further alleged that his wife suffered a heart attack after being injected the anaesthetic.

 Biswas denied the charges. He told the consumer court that neither Usha nor her relatives had informed him about her high blood pressure. He claimed that the patient?s blood pressure was normal before the surgery. 

 Biswas said Usha did not turn up at his clinic the day after the surgery and had she been suffering from a headache or chest pain, he could have referred her to a specialist.

 ?He (Biswas) said he made a thorough examination of the patient but he is not providing the details,? the judges observed.

 The doctor had argued that if the blood pressure of the patient had increased abnormally, then neither could the teeth have been extracted nor the root channel treatment undertaken without profuse bleeding.

 ?Such a conclusion is based on conjecture and hypothesis,? the court ruled.

Frequent crew cuts that graduated to boys cuts 

when a bit grown up and finally a short blunt when you had the license to voice 

your choice. Quite in contrast to your favourite fairytale characters Rapunzel, 

Cinderella and Snow White, with cascading locks in gold and brown.

 Lets admit it, grandmoms, moms or young women now, almost all of them have the same story to tell when it comes to their childhood hairstyles. But for little girls today, its a different tress tale altogether. Just like wardrobe buys are no longer ruled by what mother gets made from the local tailor, but the ones dictated by Rani in Hum Tum, Preity in Dil Chahta Hai and their like, hairstyles and cuts for the little ones, too, follow the latest trends.

 As hair and beauty expert Bridgette Jones puts it: Earlier, it would be mothers choosing practical haircuts that were easy to maintain. But children now are fashion conscious like never before. They take interest in their hairstyles from a young age. They are fully aware of what is stylish and in. A haircut is not about what mom wants but about what they themselves want.

 GoodLife takes the styles and cuts head-on.

 Trend talk

 Little girls have a mind of their own and so when it comes to kids hair fashion, it is essentially a personalised statement, says hair expert Sabina Yah. But the latest trends do influence their decision. 

 Hence, fringes and texturisation are not restricted to grown-ups, but are a current rage with kids too. And so are curls and the out-of-bed look.

 Long hair is in fashion with young girls, short hair is completely out now, reveals Bridgette. Adds Sabina: Though curls are very in right now, many girls have a thing for straight silky hair and they like to sport it.

 But what happens to the unfortunate few who cant get the better of their mothers no-style diktats? Mothers today are as conscious as their children. So along with easy maintenance, looking good is a top priority. Even if the hair length is shortened, it is a stylised bob cut or smart shoulder length, says Rita Mohan of Rapunzel. 

 Suit the face

 For mothers, haircut sessions for their angels are no longer a tiresome exercise fuelled by bribes of chocolates and candies. In a salon, girls will patiently go through hairstyling catalogues and they are ever ready to experiment with cuts. For us, it is a balancing act ? making the child happy as well as giving her a cut that will suit her best, smiles Rita.

 Just like adults, a haircut for a child has to take into account certain basics like the facial structure and volume of hair. School restrictions have to be abided by, too. So the length should be such that the hair can be tied up while going to school and left open on other occasions, says beauty consultant Sujit Bhagat. 

 For someone who is chubby, I wouldnt recommend a short blunt cut. It would only make her look plump. It could be a forward graduation cut with some fringes to complete the look. This essentially renders a slender effect to the face, stresses Bridgette. For those with a petite build, volume around the head adds body to the face, feels Sabina.

 Fringes on a narrow forehead are not advisable, a layered pushed back look would be better suited. For broad foreheads, it could be asymmetrical bangs or light feathered fringes. For those with squarish facial structure, the hairline just below the ears is a no-no. This would only accentuate their jaw line, adds Bridgette. She recommends a shoulder-length hairdo for such faces. If it is neither a squarish nor an oval shape, a combination of layers and steps look good.

 For thick and unruly hair, it is essential that the weight is taken off by texturing and carving the hair around the head, before you style it, explains Sabina. If the child has curly hair, play around with its natural texture rather than trying to tame it. For long hair, you can keep it short and heavy on the top, and light at the bottom, combined with a lot of texturing, she adds.

 Whatever the style and cut, its the attitude that counts at the end of the day. A kids hairstyle should be in sync with her personality so that she can carry it off with ease and confidence. Also, there should be no problem maintaining it after the cut. It is all about a cool and fun style that suits your little ones active lifestyle, smiles Sabina.

 Jazzing up

 Be it birthday parties or colour-dress code in school, little girls want to look their best. And hairstyling is an integral part of the makeover. But then at this age, you dont have a salon date every now and then. That, though, is hardly a deterrent for decking up. 

 A stylish hairdo at home doesnt take much effort, just a bit of patience and creativity. And with the market flooded with childrens hair accessories, the task is that much easier. 

 Different kinds of braiding is a neat and stylish way of doing up the hair. Another option is to take all your hair on one side and pin it up with a pretty clip-on, advises Rita. Those with a wedge cut can light blow-dry the hair, brushing it backwards when its semi-wet.

 Bridgette suggests twisting up sections of hair in the front and attaching them with clips adorned with butterflies or flower motifs. Adding a bit of glitter completes the effect. 

 Colouring is not advisable for children, but then you can always put on funky hair extensions, says Bridgette. From bright orange and electric blue to blonde and yellow, theres a hue for every mood. 

 Sabina has some interesting tips up her sleeves. Divide the hair into many sections, twist and crunch them and finally pin them up when semi-wet. The effect is that of natural curls, she says. A high ponytail with an attractive tie-on always looks good, but for the extra zing, apply the same technique. 

 Take sections of the ponytail and twist them up with the help of clips. Keep them for some time. Once you open the clips, the ponytail looks different with soft curls. Add on a bit of gel and glitter at the ends, matching the colour of your dress, she suggests.

 Maintain mode 

 Being overtly exposed to fashion is quite unnecessary at an early age, but basic awareness about a regular hair care regimen is very necessary, stresses Bridgette. She advises: Children must be taught the ways of proper application of shampoo and conditioner. A hair massage with almond oil every 10 days is helpful.

 Contrary to the common notion that frequent washing of hair causes damage, beauticians prescribe the regular use of a mild detergent-free shampoo to retain a clean scalp that in turn keeps away fungal infections. A trimming session every six to eight weeks is essential.

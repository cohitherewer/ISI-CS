 15 high court judges

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 For the first time in its 165-year history, Calcutta High Court will appoint 15 judges at one go. Nine of the new judges are from higher judicial services; the rest are advocates of the high court.

 ?It is a fact that 15 more judges are going to be appointed in the high court within a month. Actually, 17 were selected for new appointments in the court. But two of the advocates whose names were included on the list, recently informed the judiciary that they were not interested in taking charge,? a senior officer of the high court said.

 Papers relating to the new appointments will soon reach the high court. ?According to norms, after signing the documents neither the advocates nor those in judicial services will have the right to continue in their present jobs,? he said.

 The high court has only 29 judges, against a sanctioned strength of 50. Once the new judges join, the strength rises to 44. Two judges retire within six months.

 For the past two years, members of the Bar Association and the Bar Library Club of the high court have been demanding recruitment of new judges, as ?the normal functioning of the court? is being affected. ?We have made repeated requests to the authorities concerned to fill up the vacant posts of judges as soon as possible,? said Uttam Majumdar, former secretary of the Bar Association.

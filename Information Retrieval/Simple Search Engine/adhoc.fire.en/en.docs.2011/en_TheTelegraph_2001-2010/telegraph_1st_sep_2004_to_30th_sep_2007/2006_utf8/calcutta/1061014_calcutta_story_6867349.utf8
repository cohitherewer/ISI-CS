 What: 

 Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) Eastern Region Brewmasters Championship. 

 Where: Cafe Coffee Day outlet at City Centre.

 When: Wednesday.

 Take a sip: The preliminary round had 12 Cafe Coffee Day participants preparing Espresso, Cappuccino and a signature drink in keeping with the World Barista Championship standards. Six short-listed semi-finalists brewed up their best. Simon Swamy, Roshan Bernard, Vijay Singh, Randolph Crizzle, Ritesh Charlie and Dhananjay Pandey whipped up four Espresso, four Cappuccino and a signature drink in 15 minutes. Judges marked them on time, speed and technique, as well as presentation of the signature drink.

 It was all about coffee creativity. Each laid a table neat and stylish. The menu cards with coffee beans, red velvet and more looked enticing. Communication while brewing and stirring up the drinks was commendable. The boys are creative and stand a good chance to compete internationally, said judge Jwala Kumar Singh.

 Vijay Singh was adjudged the winner. Randolph Crizzle and Roshan Bernard stood second and third.

 Two nominees from each zone will fight it out at the National Brewmasters Championship in Bangalore. Five winners from the championship will participate in the All India Barista Championship hosted by the Coffee Board of India. The winner will then go on to compete in the World Barista Championship.

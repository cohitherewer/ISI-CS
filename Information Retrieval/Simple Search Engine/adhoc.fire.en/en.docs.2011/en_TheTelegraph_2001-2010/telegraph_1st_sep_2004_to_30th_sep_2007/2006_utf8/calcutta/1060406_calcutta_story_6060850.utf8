The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Find a footpath 

 to walk down it

 On Day II of the Spot-the-Pavement 

 campaign, Metro travels from the heart of 

 the city to a VIP Road approach and picks three more stretches 

 where pedestrians said they would have walked on the footpath 

 provided they found it

 Where: Park Street-Mullickbazar 

 crossing

 What we saw: Everything, 

 from food to fancy gifts, tyres to titbits, was on sale 

 here. Shopkeepers blocked by the makeshift stalls said they 

 had often approached the authorities, but the writ of the 

 hawkers? union runs here

 Subhra Dasgupta

 Copspeak: ?It?s 

 tough manning the traffic here. We have to book errant vehicles 

 and see to it that people forced to walk on the road do 

 not get run over. If we tell them to walk on the pavement, 

 we find ourselves in a false position as there is really 

 no pavement space left for pedestrians? ? traffic official 

 on duty.

 CMCspeak: ?It?s 

 election time and we can?t do anything. We?ll have to wait 

 till the polls are over?

 ? Arun Sarkar, chief engineer, 

 conservancy.

 Pedestrianspeak: 

 ?I know it is wrong to walk on such a busy road but give 

 us a chance to walk on the pavement. The hawkers occupy 

 them all.? ? Subhra Dasgupta, Beckbagan resident

 Where: Grant 

 Street, in the Chandni Chowk area

 What we saw: The 

 pavement is just a narrow strip that calls for the skills 

 of a trapeze artist. And once you step on to the street, 

 you?re at the mercy of the autorickshaw gang. The three-wheelers 

 here are a law unto themselves, paralysing and managing 

 traffic at the same time. So, no traffic police in sight

 Shayne Hyrapiet

 Copspeak: ?The 

 public vehicles department has issued the licence for the 

 autos and so we cannot do anything? 

 ? Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner 

 of police (traffic)

 Residentspeak: ?My 

 grandparents are old and ailing. In any medical emergency, 

 we have a tough time taking them to the doctor because no 

 vehicle can enter. At night, they park their autos and blare 

 music. We have made numerous complaints to the CMC and police. 

 Fed up, we are leaving this house where three generations 

 have stayed? ? singer Shayne Hyrapiet.

 Where: Approach 

 to Ultadanga, from north Calcutta.

 What we saw: 

 Hawkers who sell vegetables, fruits and cloth pieces occupy 

 the entire stretch. The pedestrians are forced to step off 

 the pavement and on to the busy thoroughfare, making a mockery 

 of other fancy arrangements, like the footbridge to curb 

 road mishap count

 Sreerupa Basu Mullick

 Copspeak: Not 

 a single cop was in sight

 CMCspeak: ?There 

 is no proper arrangement for traffic policing on the entire 

 stretch. Also, many people avoid the footbridge because 

 the climb is too steep? 

 ? Arun Sarkar, chief engineer 

 (conservancy)

 Pedestrianspeak: 

 ?It is very difficult for people here to walk on the footpath 

 because they are completely occupied by the hawkers? 

 ? Sreerupa Basu Mullick, a resident 

 of Maniktala who regularly passes down this stretch

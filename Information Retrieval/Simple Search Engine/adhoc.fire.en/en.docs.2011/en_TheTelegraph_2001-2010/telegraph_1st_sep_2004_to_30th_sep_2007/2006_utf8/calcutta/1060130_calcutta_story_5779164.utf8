The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Duo vanishes after fraud

 - Con artists leave shops poorer by lakhs

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 R.K. Chaudhury is in his early thirties and V.K. Chaudhury in his sixties. Over the past month, the two had dropped in at several shops, made purchases worth lakhs and always paid by cheque.

 Now, they are on the ?most wanted? list of the police, as the cheques have turned out to be fake. Both are absconding.

 Unsuspecting shop-owners were not the only targets of the Chaudhurys, who used to live in a rented house in central Calcutta, posing as partners of a company in Parsi Church Lane, off Lalbazar. They had also duped their landlord. 

 Officers of the detective department came to know about the duo after the owner of a Kankurgachhi shop complained that the Chaudhurys had bought five mobile phones, worth Rs 64,000, from him in mid-December. A few days later, he was informed by his bank that the cheque submitted by the duo was forged.

 Days later, the sleuths found out, the Chaudhurys had walked into a watch shop in City Centre, bought five watches worth Rs 80,000 and dished out a fake cheque. 

 In the next few weeks, they left a mobile phone shop in Burrabazar and an electronics store on Shakespeare Sarani poorer by Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000, respectively. 

 On a few occasions, the shop-owners would balk at receiving payments by cheque. But the duo would convince them with the ?details of their company?s transactions?. 

 ?They are missing. It will take time for us to comment on how the two went about their way,? said deputy commissioner (I), detective department, Gyanwant Singh.

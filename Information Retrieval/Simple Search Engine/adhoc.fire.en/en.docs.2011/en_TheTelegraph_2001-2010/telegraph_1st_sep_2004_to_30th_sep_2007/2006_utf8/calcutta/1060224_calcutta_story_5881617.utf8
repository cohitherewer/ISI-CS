 What: Launch of Baker St, a bakery and pastry counter. 

 Where: The Kenilworth.

 When: February 13.

 Take a look: A few steps from the lobby and you find Baker St on your right, done up with pretty flowers. Covering a modest area of 65 sq ft, a glass showcase displays yummy pastries, savouries and cakes.

 The hotel always wanted to come up with a bakery outlet. Before doing something elaborate on a larger scale we want to see how this goes down with buyers, explains pastry chef Bruno Gomes.

 There are cookies and chocolates that will melt in your mouth. The array of cakes includes different seasonal flavours like strawberry, pineapple, Butterscotch and all-time favourites like Black Forest.

 Among pastries there is Chocolate Brownie, Chocolate Truffle, Vanilla, Mixed Fruit and more. You can indulge in Lemon and Strawberry tarts as well. Eggless and diabetic desserts are made to order.

 The savoury spread boasts baked delights like Veg Quiche, Spinach and Cheese Puff, Chicken Tikka Roll, Chicken Hot Dog and stuffed cold sandwiches that offer varieties like Coleslaw Croissant, Chicken Salad Sandwich and Cheese and Mayo in Hot Dog Roll.

 The bread corner is an assortment of pizza bases, burger buns, French bread, crusty hard rolls and croissant. Whole wheat and multi-grain breads are available on order. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 15.

 Voiceover: People are increasingly becoming calorie conscious these days. Keeping this in mind, we have kept the sugar content balanced. We will also keep gift packs for various festivals throughout the year, smiles Bruno.

 Decor den

 What: Launch of Durian furniture showroom.

 Where: Loharuka Estate, Ramakrishna Pally, Kaikhali.

 Take a look: The three-storey showroom sprawled over 20,000 sq ft is home to exclusive furniture from Italy, Spain, Malaysia and Brazil.

 Attractive leather sofa sets come in a range of colours ? brown, green, red, off-white and maroon. Ones with fabric upholstery are equally appealing.

 We are keeping 29 designs of sofa sets at present and more will be added soon, says M.L. Tripathi, sales in-charge of the showroom. A special massage chair from the US that helps de-stress is a show stealer.

 Innovative centre tables with glass tops in abstract shapes catch the eye. The highlight, however, is a table where a big, oval clock forms the top, laid over a wooden base.

 For dining sets, space saving and utility is the priority. While a rectangular table can be extended when required, some tables come with a lower rack for storing dining essentials. Some have glass tops, some wooden and others marble. Then there are bar counters in combinations of glass and wood.

 The bedroom sets consist of a double bed, two side tables, one set of drawers with mirror and a four-door wardrobe. Some are sleek and contemporary, while others are quite Victorian in appeal.

 There are conference tables, bookshelves, easy to use file cabinets and computer tables, too.

 Pocket pinch: Sofa sets start at Rs 30,000, bedroom sets at Rs 80,000 and office sets at Rs 1,400.

 Voiceover: We are a one-stop shop for all kinds of furniture. The variety is wide and prices are very competitive, smiles Tripathi.

 Weekend wow

 What: A new buffet spread for weekends and holidays.

 Where: Cinnamon on 24, Park Street.

 The menu: A blend of cuisines from the world over. The lavish five-course meal offers 25 dishes, from Mediterranean, Indian and Oriental (Thai, Chinese and Indonesian) cuisines. A special feature of the buffet is a wide spread of salads.

 Pocket pinch: Rs 275, plus taxes.

 Voiceover: The buffet concept is becoming very popular in the city. We introduced this weekend buffet in response to customer demand, says Ashish Chakraborty, proprietor of Cinnamon.

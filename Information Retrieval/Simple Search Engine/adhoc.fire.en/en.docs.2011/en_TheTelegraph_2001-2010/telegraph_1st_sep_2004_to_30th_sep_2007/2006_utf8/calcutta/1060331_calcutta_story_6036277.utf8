The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tear gas in clash rerun

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The police resorted to lathicharge and lobbed tear-gas shells to quell violence that erupted afresh on Narkeldanga Main Road on Thursday afternoon. The spot turned into a battlefield as local residents continued the brawl that broke out on Wednesday. 

 Ten persons were arrested and two policemen injured as the residents fought each other with bombs and sodawater bottles.

 A large contingent of police, including personnel of the Rapid Action Force, was sent to the spot. Traffic on the stretch was disrupted for more than two hours. 

 ?Today?s clash is a fall-out of yesterday?s violence,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). ?We have deployed a large contingent to keep a close watch on the situation.?

 It was around 2 pm when the clash broke out on Thursday. The two groups involved in Wednesday?s violence came out on Narkeldanga Main Road and started pelting stones at each other.

 ?A few policemen were deployed there from last night. But our men were outnumbered by the warring crowd of 200,? said Sharma.

 As news reached Lalbazar, joint commissioner of police (traffic) Ranvir Kumar, deputy commissioner (eastern suburban division) Vineet Goyel and deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim went over. 

 ?Initially, we resorted to a lathicharge. But that did not work, as the mob started attacking us. We had to fire tear gas shells. We lobbed three gas grenades,? said an officer of Narkeldanga police station. ?We have arrested a number of persons. A hunt is on to track down the others.? 

 Trouble erupted between the two groups on Wednesday afternoon over a game of cricket, when a bystander was hit by a ball. In retaliation, he beat up a child. 

 As word spread, the neighbours of the injured child, Jahir, armed with iron rods and swords, went to the adjoining area and hurled bombs. 

 To avenge the attack, about 50 youths in another group went on the rampage by throwing sodawater bottles. The fight continued for over an hour, injuring 10 persons, including two policemen.

 How about using Humpty Dumpty to implement important public policies or highlight traffic snarls in a school locality to develop ecological awareness? 

 This is Project Citizen, a curricular programme introduced by Lakshmipat Singhania Academy in collaboration with Ramjas School, RK Puram Delhi and Centre for Civic Education, California, for the first time in Calcutta. It is meant to teach future citizens democratic values, principles of tolerance and feelings of political efficacy.

 Though Lakshmipat Singhania is the nodal point, at least 20 other CBSE schools, including Birla High and Mahadevi Birla Girls? High School, are sending their teachers to participate in the workshop from March 24.

 ?This project promises to encourage students, parents, teachers and members of the community to actively participate in monitoring and influencing public policies and knowing the environment better,? says Anjali Razdan, principal of Lakshmipat Singhania.

 So how is Humpty Dumpty used as a case study? Students are presented with the problem of an egg falling from a wall. They are first asked to find out what caused the fall. Was it because the wall was too high, or because the king?s men were not doing their job properly?

 With the possible causes drawn, participants next suggest alternatives to avoid such accidents. Ideas like putting notices on the wall, making egg-shaped benches in the park, and fencing off the gardens are aired. 

 Next, comes the concept of policy making and how to involve the authorities for financial support. Some suggest that the king fund the making of benches, others say despite opposition the wall should be broken down, while some believe the king should gain opposition support before enforcing a rule.

 Thus a funny example engages students in learning how to make policies, develop action plans and involve the authorities in implementing such policies. ?Such projects will help youngsters develop a sense of independence and create an awareness to turn them into good citizens,? feels educationist Raj Sethia who has worked with student groups in six European countries.

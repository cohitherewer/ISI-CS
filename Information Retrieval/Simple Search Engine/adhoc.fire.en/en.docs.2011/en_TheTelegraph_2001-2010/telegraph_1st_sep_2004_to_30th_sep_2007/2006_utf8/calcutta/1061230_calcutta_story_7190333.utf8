 Saturday Club

 What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite.

 The bash: Starting 8.30 pm, get ready to rock with DJ Sooraj from Mumbai. Calcutta band Dhwani will belt out multilingual numbers to keep you on the dance floor all night long. If you still havent shaken a leg, Mumbai dancer Neha and her troupe will get you moving and grooving in no time. Dig into cuisine from Amber, Gupta Brothers and the clubs own kitchen specials. Try your hand at the lucky-draw contest on every entry pass or make sure you take home a prize for on-the-spot dance awards. City model Jessica plays charming compere for the night.

 Voiceover: We are expecting at least 1,500 people. So far the trend seems to be one couple bringing along another. The dress code is strictly formal-lounge suit with tie or national dress (Jodhpur suit) for men. Women can get away with anything! smiles Rajen Sood, convenor, entertainment committee, Saturday Club.

 Tollygunge Club

 What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite. 

 The bash: Dont sweat if you arent in Goa this December, because Mumbai-based Goan band Aqua Flow will recreate the surf-and-sand magic at Tollygunge Club, dominated by the beats of English party numbers. Of course youll have to give the beach party look a miss and opt for formals, instead!

 Barry Brien will ring in the New Year as emcee and DJ Austin will set the pulse racing and keep it going till early on January 1. An array of snack stalls and a complete dinner menu will be on offer.

 Voiceover: Unlike Xmas Eve which catered to a predominantly young crowd, New Years Eve will bring in the young and not-so-young, hence the emphasis is on the band. We have a limit of 2,000 entries and will stop bookings as soon as the mark is reached, said Arunava Chakravarty, deputy-managing member, Tolly.

 CC amp;FC

 What: Royal Challenge presents The Telegraph 31st Nite.

 The bash: Leslie Lewiss tunes and a team of six dancers will set the night rolling at 8.30 pm, followed by crooner Jyotsna from Mumbai with a mixed bag of songs. DJ Firoze will take charge of the console. Five food stalls will cater to all possible tastes Italian, Mughlai, Chinese, North Indian and Indian Vegetarian. A larger-than-life screen on the club lawns will provide a glimpse of the dance floor inside the air-conditioned Shamiana. 

 Bonfires will create the perfect ambience and a grand display of fireworks will spark off New Year celebrations at midnight. A lucky-draw can fetch you a four-night-five-day stay at a deluxe hotel in Singapore or gift hampers and liquor.

 Voiceover: This is our biggest event on the social calendar and we are expecting a footfall of 3,000-plus, said Deepankar Nandi, CEO, CC amp;FC.

 Space Circle

 The bash: Kick-start the party mood with European belly dancers at 9 pm. Up next, performers Roop Johrie (of Honey Honey fame) and Channel V singer Ravindra Upadhyay will hold centre stage. The theme of Party Royale will be celebrated in James Bond (Casino Royale) style even as dance group Aby Baby keeps you spinning till morning. Finally, pile your plate with tongue-tickling snacks from the club kitchen.

 Voiceover: Last year we had a footfall of 2,500. This year we are expecting more. Its a complete package of fun, food and family, said Suman Mukherjee, F amp;B manager, Space Circle.

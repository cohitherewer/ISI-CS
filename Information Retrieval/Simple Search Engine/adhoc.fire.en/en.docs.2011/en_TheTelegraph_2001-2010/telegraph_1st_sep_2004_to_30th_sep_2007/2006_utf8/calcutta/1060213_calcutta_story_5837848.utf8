Subhadyuti Datta: How many parks and squares will be improved under CEIP?

 Twenty parks and squares have been earmarked for improvement under the CEIP. Though a feasibility study had included Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar, they have been dropped from the list. The facelift of College Square, Hedua and Tallah Park has been completed. At Tallah Park, a Rs 50-lakh concrete bridge has been constructed connecting an island, which has hitherto been inaccessible to visitors, with the bank of the waterbody.

 Six schemes for water supply

 - CMDA to handle Rs 256-cr plan under urban renewal mission

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has undertaken a number of water supply projects under the National Urban Renewal Mission.

 Half-a-dozen projects, worth Rs 256 crore, were finalised at a recent meeting in Delhi, attended by senior officials of the CMDA, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and some government departments.

 The Centre agreed to include the projects under the National Urban Renewal Mission and provide 35 per cent of the cost. The rest will have to be borne by the state.

 ?Of the six projects, five are in and around the city,? said P.R. Baviskar, chief executive officer of CMDA, which has been chosen the implementing agency of the projects.

 The biggest of the six projects will come up in the city at a cost of Rs 98 crore. A Rs 18.34-crore project will come in Mahestala and a Rs 11.41-crore project in Akra, both on the southern fringes of the city.

 Two more projects are on the anvil ? at Bansberia, in Hooghly (Rs 49.29 crore) and at Uluberia, in Howrah (Rs 48.78 crore).

 The CMDA is also playing the role of a nodal agency in implementing a Rs 29.92-crore scheme in the Durgapur-Asansol belt of Burdwan district.

 Altogether, 11 water supply projects, worth Rs 874.46 crore, will be implemented across the state under the National Urban Renewal Mission.

 ?We will start work as soon as we get 25 per cent of the funds committed by the Centre under the mission,? said a senior CMDA official.

 ?The money will come soon and we hope to start work in July. All the projects are crucial, considering the pace of urbanisation the state is witnessing,? the official added.

 The cash-strapped state government now badly needs funds under the National Urban Renewal Mission for development projects. ?The government is even willing to accept conditions attached to the funds,? said another official of the agency.

 ?The government has already slashed the stamp duty, as asked by the Centre, and set up a committee to examine the other conditions, including the phasing out of the urban land ceiling law,? he added.

 ?The CMDA has recently implemented a few projects along with other government agencies. It has also partnered private companies in executing a couple of projects. But the water-supply schemes will be implemented by the CMDA alone,? said Pranbandhu Nag, general secretary of the Development Employees Joint Action Committee.

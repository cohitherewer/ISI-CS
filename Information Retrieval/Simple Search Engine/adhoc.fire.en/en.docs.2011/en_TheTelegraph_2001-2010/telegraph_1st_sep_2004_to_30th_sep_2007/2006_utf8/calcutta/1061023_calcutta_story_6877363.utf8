 The worlds oldest printing and publishing house, Cambridge University Press (CUP), has finally set up a store in the city. After offices in Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bangalore, the publisher opened a showroom at Raja Subodh Mullick Square on October 13. 

 The company has acquired a 51 per cent equity stake in Delhi-based publisher Foundation Books, which used to look after the CUPs interests in south Asia. The new imprint will be Cambridge University Press India Pvt Ltd (CUPIPL).

 CUP chief executive Stephen Bourne, who was in the city for the launch, said: While your Prime Minister Manmohan Singh receives an honorary degree at Cambridge University and Kiran Desai receives the Man Booker Award, we open our office in Calcutta looking forward to some exciting business opportunities in eastern India and also in Bangladesh and Nepal.

 CUPIPL will focus on English language teaching and academic books for the Indian market. It has made an initial investment of $2.5 billion, informed Chris Boughton, managing director (Asia Pacific) of the publisher. 

 While the erstwhile Foundation Books will continue publishing titles under its own imprint, which as Bourne says has been highly successful and academically of rigorous standard, new CUP titles will also be available in the market. Local books with local authors will be published under the Foundation Books imprint, as was being done earlier. We do not want to slow down that process. These books will be marketed and distributed from our offices. We will also bring in more of our original titles, stated Bourne. 

 CUPIPL will market Cambridge dictionaries, its English language teaching books and college texts in niche areas. According to Boughton, the house will expand its list in science, medicine, environment, agriculture and ecology.

 Whether the CUP books will now be available at more affordable prices or not and the kind of books that will be published by CUPIPL will be decided by Bourne and Boughton along with the managing director of Foundation Books Manas Saikia.

 With the press expanding its Indian presence, buyers might finally have access to its leather-bound Bibles. CUP published its first Bible in 1591, an edition of the Geneva Bible.

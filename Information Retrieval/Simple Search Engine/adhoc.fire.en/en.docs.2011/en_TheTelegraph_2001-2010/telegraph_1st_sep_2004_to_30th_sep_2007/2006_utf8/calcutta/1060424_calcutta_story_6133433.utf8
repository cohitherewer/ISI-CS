 Pick a role, play it right

 KONKONA SEN SHARMA has finally accepted the fact that she is an actor and developed a more professional approach towards her films, finds Reshmi Sengupta

 lHow has it been playing Emilia in Omkara, Vishal Bharadwaj?s adaptation of Othello?

 My character is called Indu in Omkara. I don?t remember much of Othello, but they have changed it a lot from Amelia. Indu is a great character. She?s someone who injects humour in the lives of the other characters, considering that it?s a dark film. So I have a contrasting character, but you also see the darker side of her sometimes.

 lDid you do any kind of homework for your role?

 Nothing for my role, but I had to work on the western UP dialect that I had to speak, which was very difficult for me. I can speak Hindi but I am not as comfortable as I am in Bengali or English. The other actors had problems too but it was probably much easier for them.

 lHow did Vishal come across as the director leading so many different kind of star actors, from Ajay Devgan, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Viveik Oberoi to Naseeruddin Shah?

 I loved Vishal Bhardwaj?s Maqbool and I have always wanted to work with him. He has been very flexible and open. Often the day before shooting a difficult scene, we all ? the director, the cinematographer, the editor and the actors ? would sit together with the set book for discussions. And that helped a lot. We have had a very friendly relation on the sets. Most of my scenes were with Kareena and Saif and it was a very humbling experience working with them. They are all very good actors. I don?t think Saif, though he has done a few negative roles, has been seen in such a role before. Kareena has done very well too.

 lWhat is your role in Naseeruddin Shah?s directorial debut Yun Hota To Kya Hota?

 I play a young woman who is married to Jimmy Shergill. He goes abroad and she accompanies him. It?s a marital drama. It?s not particularly light or dark, but it?s very real. Actually there are four different stories that culminate in one event.

 lHow did you find Naseer as a director? You have worked with him in Mixed Doubles?

 My scene with Naseer in Mixed Doubles is really nothing. I really admire him and it was great working with him. We did a lot of rehearsals and workshops for Yun Hota? which has helped a lot. The rehearsals were in fact a lot more fun than the shooting. We shot the film in Mumbai and then in America.

 Naseer has very strong opinions but I always agreed with him about the way he wanted to shoot the film, so there was never any problem. I, in a way, like him for the fact that he has strong opinions.

 lAfter directing you in Dosar, Rituparno Ghosh told us you have developed a directorial eye? 

 I have never made a conscious effort to develop a directorial eye. But as an actor, and this is true for other actors as well, you can?t be involved only with yourself. During shooting you need to be aware of the camera, the lens and the light. I hang around on the sets of my mother?s films even if I am not working in them because I love watching her work and I get involved with them. And I find it a great learning process. 

 lYou have played a variety of roles in a span of two years. How has the experience helped you mature as an actress?

 While deciding on a film, I look at the script, which has to be well written and convincing and one where you can relate to the characters. After playing all these roles, I think I have matured, in the sense that I have learnt to become more professional. Which means I don?t get too emotionally attached to the projects, say with the decisions taken, though I am very much involved with my characters. That apart, I have also accepted the fact that I am an actor. Earlier, I had a lot of confusion about whether I would be an actor or not.

 lWhat are your forthcoming releases and what are you going to work on next?

 Apart from Omkara and Yun Hota to Kya Hota, there is a thriller by Tanvir Khan called Deadline, where there is Irrfan opposite me. There?s also Siddharth Srinivas?s horror film Amavas, which is long due for release. 

 I am going to work in another film with Rituparno Ghosh very soon. It?s a comedy, my second one, as I would call Mixed Doubles my first comedy.

 That apart, there?s my mother?s Goynar Baksho which should start by the end of this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cops set out on trader trail 

 - Investigation gathers steam after Metro report

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After remaining inert for two months, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Behala police have swung into action to trace trader Subrata Hazra, who disappeared from his Rai Bahadur Road residence on November 19. 

 Subrata was a member of a group formed by local residents to prevent crime in the area. He regularly served as a night guard. 

 On November 19, Subrata had returned home around 4 am after night duty. He went out again around 5.30 am for his morning stroll. He hasn?t returned since then. 

 Following the disappearance, the family received four threat calls. The caller, a man, warned Subrata?s wife Anita not to look for him if she wanted to see him alive. She got in touch with the police and CID, but did not receive much help from them.

 Anita said a team of police officers visited the Hazra residence on Friday, following publication of a report of police apathy to the case in the Metro. ?Throughout the day, officers from Behala police station and CID made several inquiries,? she stated. 

 Anita added that she had provided the investigators some leads. ?Only a couple of days ago, a neighbour told me he had seen my husband at Sonarpur. I have asked the police to conduct a search in the area,? she disclosed.

 According to her, it is possible that Subrata is at Sonarpur, since she had found a number of tickets in his pockets of a bus that plied from Kharibari to Sonarpur via Behala. 

 ?But I cannot fathom why and how my husband can be at Sonarpur for so many days. He loved his son and daughter deeply. Moreover, he was always worried about his aged parents,? she said. 

 ?After his disappearance, I have fallen into financial trouble. Since all the bank accounts are in his name, I cannot withdraw money. The bank authorities have refused to provide me the account details since they are personal accounts. I am in real trouble and I don?t know how to manage. My daughter studies in Class IX of a reputed school and my son is trying to start a business. I feel quite helpless,? Anita added.

 When contacted, Behala police confirmed that they had interrogated a number of persons regarding Subrata?s disappearance. ?For the sake of investigation, it is not possible for us to provide any more details,? said a senior officer.

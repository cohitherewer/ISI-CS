 Jawans in road rage

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Two army jawans allegedly manhandled a civilian and forcibly took him and his car to Fort William, Eastern Command headquarters, early on Thursday.

 The cause of the carjack: the Indica had rammed into an army jeep at the Harish Mukherjee Road-Sambhunath Pandit Road crossing.

 Police sources said the accident occurred around 1.20 am near SSKM Hospital. Moments later, two of the four army jawans inside the jeep emerged and beat up the civilian behind the wheel.

 When policemen in a patrol van spied the man being assaulted, three of them rushed to the spot and tried to sort out the matter, but in vain.

 They informed Kalighat police station and a sub-inspector, R.K. Tiwari, along with two constables arrived after half an hour. 

 Tiwari asked both the civilian and the army jawans to accompany him to the police station and lodge a complaint. But the jawans allegedly refused and engaged in a war of words with the policemen. 

 They did not listen to us. Two of the jawans got into the car and asked the man to drive them to the Eastern Command headquarters. We remained mute spectators, admitted a police officer.

 Later in the morning, senior police officers were informed about the incident as the owner of the car lodged a complaint.

 Police then contacted army officers at Fort William and a captain arrived at Kalighat police station where the car owner was present.

 The matter was sorted out between them, which is why no official complaint was lodged, Bikash Roy, officer-in-charge of Kalighat police station, told Metro.

 Police said no one was to blame for the accident and both the vehicles were partially damaged. But it was a clear flouting of road rules.

 According to the rules, both the vehicles involved in the accident should have been brought to the local police station. Thereafter, a complaint is lodged against the offending vehicle... What the jawans did was violation of the law, an officer stressed.

 But a senior army officer brushed the matter aside. Why are you asking me this when no official complaint was lodged? Things have been sorted out, he said.

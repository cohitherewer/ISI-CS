 We Ask You Answer

 Flying clone of the West

 Today?s question: Is it right to call Krrish the first Indian superhero?

 Original superhero: A still from an 

 animation film on Hanuman

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 I don?t think Krrish is the first superhero of Indian cinema. All the heroes of Hindi commercial cinema are superheroes, no less. They can take on several armed villains with bare hands. They can jump to the ground from multi-storeyed buildings without sustaining a single injury. Surely, no ordinary mortal is capable of such feats. Krrish is merely one in a long line of superheroes.

 The search for Indian superheroes must begin in our mythology. Hanuman is the first and the greatest. He used his magical powers to carry a mountain on his back, set Lanka on fire and perform many other feats worthy of a superhero. People worship Hanuman as a god, but his image is definitely of a superhero. The euphoria over Krrish is partly due to hype. The only thing unique about the character is the way it is being marketed.

 I do not agree. I enjoyed the film but the success of the character is yet to be established. Besides it is modelled on western superheroes.

 No. According to me, the first Indian superhero is the mighty Hanumanji whom we worship.

 Absurd heroics should not be portrayed on screen since it creates an adverse impact on the minds of youngsters, who tend to emulate such action. Hrithik did his Krrish stunts with full safety gear and supported by not less than 50 professionals. Despite all this, if he sustained an injury, he would not have had to worry about its treatment and the future of his family. But what if a boy sustains an injury while trying to copy him?

 The rest of the world has Superman, Spiderman and many other superheroes. We in India finally have Krrish to call our own. He is the first Indian superhero and should be marketed properly so that he can become a global figure. It will be interesting to see competition between Superman and Krrish.

 Krrish is definitely the first Indian superhero. The Roshans have put in their best to create a flamboyant character. He has been vested with physical beauty, intelligence and special powers. The impact Krrish has made can be gauged from the box-office collections of the film. 

 Jyoti Kakarania,

 Salt Lake 

 It is absolutely right to call Krrish the first indigenous superhero. To date, our choice of superheroes was restricted to the likes of Superman, Batman and He-man. Krrish is the first Indian character of comparable clout. His stunts in the film are a treat, while the special effects are mindblowing.

 A. Chatterjee, 

 Lake Town 

 Krrish has the potential to take on Hollywood superheroes. Excellent production values of the film has boosted the character to the levels of the superheroes of the West.

T.R. Anand,

 Hrithik Roshan is indeed a superhero after Krrish. His father has done a wonderful job. The film?s technical prowess has elevated Bollywood to the status of Hollywood. India has shown the world that we can put up a strong challenge to anything the West dishes out. The fizzling out of Superman Returns in front of Krrish lends credence to our self-belief.

 D. Chakraborty,

 Cossipore

 Definitely. Krrish showed all the qualities of a superhero. He had sharp intellect, endless patience and political acumen of the highest degree. He helped the Pandavas win the battle of Kurukshetra.

 Metro to cut train interval

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Metro Railway plans to pare the interval between trains during peak hours to cope with the increase in passenger load. 

 If things go according to plan, trains could run at six-minute intervals later in the year, Metro officials said on Thursday. The trains are now operated at eight-minute intervals during office time.

 ?We are looking into the technical aspects of increasing the frequency of trains,? said G. K. Mohanty, chief operations manager, Metro Railway. According to the plan, the frequency of trains will initially be increased between 9 am and 11 am. Evening trains will be made more frequent later.

 Metro Railway has been registering a 10 per cent rise in passenger count every year. More than 325,000 people now avail of the service every day. The trains are often overcrowded, making it difficult for the doors to close. 

 To increase the frequency of trains, additional rakes will have to be pressed into service, explained Metro Railway officers. Now, 10 rakes are operated every day, with two others on standby. 

 The authorities plan to run 12 rakes, keeping two others on standby, to increase the frequency of services. The number of pairs of trains run daily will be raised from 95 to 105.

 However, once the Metro services are extended from Tollygunge to Garia, six additional rakes will be required to maintain the six-minute frequency.

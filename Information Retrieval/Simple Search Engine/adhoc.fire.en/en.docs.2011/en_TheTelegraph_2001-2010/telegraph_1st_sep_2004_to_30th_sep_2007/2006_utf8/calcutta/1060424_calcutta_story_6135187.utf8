 Pain relief for cancer patients 

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Pain, bleeding and vomiting, breathlessness, neurological complications, depression and emaciation ? it is a traumatic end for a cancer patient. 

 With deaths from cancer on the rise in the city, palliative care units are coming up to ease the pain of those terminally ill with the disease. About 65,000 people are detected with cancer every year in Bengal. Of them, nearly 10,000 are from the city.

 According to doctors, two-thirds of the cancer patients visit the doctor at an advanced stage and cannot be cured. 

 ?The patients need relief from pain as well as mental agony in the face of death,? said Anjan Dasgupta of TRA General Hospital, which recently inaugurated its indoor palliative care unit in technical collaboration with PRERAK, a voluntary organisation supporting cancer patients. The hospital has dedicated six beds for palliative care.

 ?The unit aims to improve the quality of life of the patients through various methods, including psychological counselling,? explained Rati Chand Vajpeyi, palliative care physician and founder of PRERAK. Doctors and nurses, specially trained in palliative care, will be part of the unit. 

 ?Some doctors shake off the onus of the patient when there is no chance of cure. There is need for a human approach towards a dying patient,? stated Subir Ganguly, oncologist at Subodh Mitra Cancer Hospital, which has a four-bed palliative care unit. ?Relatives of the patient should also undergo counselling,? he added.

 Head of surgical and medical oncology departments of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) Joydeep Biswas held: ?The situation becomes unbearable when all the symptoms of the terminal stage manifest themselves. Palliative care is the only way out then.?

 Talks are on with WHO and the Centre to develop a palliative care unit at CNCI?s Chandernagore wing.

 Stem cell therapy can help cut down progression of cardiac disease to heart failure or treat existing heart failure, while up to 90 per cent success rate in stem cell surgery for cardiac patients has been recorded in a very specific patient population, latest research reveals.

 While benefits of such research is on the early emergence in India, in the next three to six months, trials can be started in key centres including Calcutta, hopes Amit N. Patel, globally-acclaimed cardiothoracic surgeon and pioneer in stem cell research and therapies for cardiac disorders.

 Patel, who for over a decade has sought to improve treatment of heart conditions, particularly by restoring the strength and functioning of the heart muscle using adult stem cells, recently joined the scientific advisory board for LifeCell, frontrunners in stem cell banking and research in India.

 Issues of delivery, retention of cells, type of optimal cells and timing of delivery are the principal challenges in India at this point, Patel, certified by the US FDA for clinical trials using adult stem cells to treat heart patients, tells Metro. The director of cardiac stem cell therapies, McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, US, has performed over 100 adult stem cell surgeries worldwide.

 LifeCell, setting up Indias first exclusive stem cell therapy centre in Chennai, is actively considering a cord blood bank in Calcutta. The citys first cord blood banking facility, to come up early next year, is being launched by Singapore-based cell therapy major CyGenics, through CordLife Sciences (India).

 Stem cell therapy helps the human body repair itself by utilising the stem cells, which are still at an early stage of development, and implanting them in other areas of the body in order to aid the body repair itself. Used in cardiac surgery, stem cells are directly injected into the heart muscle with a needle.

 There are many possible reasons why they work, from creating new muscle or blood vessels, recruiting other cells or growth factors, or fusion with weakened cells making them stronger, observes Patel. He feels the use of stem cells and tissue engineering can help India create an effective and efficient healthcare system for the future.

 Infrastructure is now in place to develop a large store of 50,000-75,000 cords to meet the growing need, he says.

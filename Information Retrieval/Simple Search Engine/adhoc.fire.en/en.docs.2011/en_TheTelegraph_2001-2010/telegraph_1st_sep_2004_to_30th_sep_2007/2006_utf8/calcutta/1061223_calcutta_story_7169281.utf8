 A hangover shot for the day after, a Frozen Melon Ball for that first date, a Taipirojca for Wednesday early evenings or a Charlotte to beat the blues Soon, you can drown your sorrows, raise a toast or be nice and nostalgic with a sip tailored to match the mood.

 Kix, Calcuttas first mood bar, equipped to whip up a concoction for every theme, is ready to serve its arrival shot, at Salt Lakes City Centre.

 Kix is not just another lounge bar, but a relax rendezvous where there would be signature cocktails to suit all occasions and every mood, promises Anjan Chatterjee, director of promoters Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd, which also owns the Mainland China and Oh! Calcutta brands.

 Situated next to the groups quick-service Chinese restaurant Haka, Kix is the first in a chain of 10 to 12 mood bars set to come up in at least nine malls in the next 24 months.

 Eric Lobo, the man behind the counter mixing those designer drinks, claims he has an answer to everything. When your limbs are dog-tired but the minds still moving, we serve you Big Brothers Visual (a heady blend of seven different spirits). If you have had a fight with your wife, your best bet is a Spider Bite (jalapeno, vodka, lime, sugar and ice), offers Lobo, formerly with Library Bar, Olive and Indigo.

 If Tropical (a concoction of lime, mint, vodka and Bacardi) is meant to turn you on when you are depressed, there would be special frozen drinks, with or without alcohol, for Sunday afternoons, and refreshing, mild, no-hangover cocktails for Monday evenings.

 Kix at City Centre will have DJ Suketu from Mumbai manning the console to kick-start proceedings. He will then train his associate to keep the music playing. It wont be loud or intimidating and would never drown conversation, stresses Chatterjee, whose wife Suchanda has done the minimalist, contemporary interiors with subtle, fibre-optic illumination.

 The second Kix outlet will come up at Silver Arcade inside the Silver Spring complex on the EM Bypass, and a third in the South City Mall, declares Chatterjee. Besides the Kix bars, the group has signed up around nine food courts in upcoming malls like South City, Mani Square, Riverside Mall, Avani Galleria, Europa and Forum II.

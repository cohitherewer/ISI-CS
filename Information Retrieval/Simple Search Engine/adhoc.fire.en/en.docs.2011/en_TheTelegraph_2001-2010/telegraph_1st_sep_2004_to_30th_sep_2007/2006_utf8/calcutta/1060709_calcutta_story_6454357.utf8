 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Sirikhola

 Facing the towering Himalayan 

 peaks and surrounded by mountains green with conifers, Sirikhola 

 is located in a bowl-shaped valley at the foot of Singalila 

 range. The village, at an altitude of 2,292 m, is only 6 

 km from Rimbik. The mighty Kanchenjunga and its brethren 

 cast their shadow on the picturesque hamlet.

 Ferns and orchids adorn Sirikhola, which mostly attracts tourists with a yen for solitude. The snug Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) cottage is the most popular place to put up in. One might take the Hill Cart Road to reach Sirikhola via Rimbik. Those bound for Darjeeling generally choose the route, up to Ghoom. The trail meanders along railway tracks from Siliguri. Be sure to stop at Batasia Loop, an astonishing feat of engineering. 

 Take a left from Ghoom to reach Rimbik via Sukhia Pokhri and Manebhanjan. You can also follow the other route via Mirik. The routes converge at Sukhia Pokhri. A few buses ply between Rimbik and Darjeeling via Sukhia Pokhri and Ghoom. To travel in peace, hire a jeep or car to Rimbik from Ghoom or Manebhanjan. A road bordered with conifers leads to the tranquil valley past Batasi and Palmajua.

 While the more well-known hill stations like Darjeeling and Kalimpong are bogged down by the tremendous rush of tourists, Sirikhola welcomes even those without advance bookings with open arms. The water problems common to the popular tourist stops are also absent here. Moreover, Sirikhola is just as enticing in autumn.

 It will be nearly afternoon before 

 you reach Rimbik. Even though Sirikhola is only an easy 

 trek away you will be well advised to stay a night at Rimbik. 

 One good reason is to enjoy a view of the icy pinnacles 

 at sunset. The last rays spark off a psychedelic play of 

 colours on the snow-capped peaks. It is a sight you will 

 remember for the rest of your life.

 Next morning, hit the road as early as you can, preferably right after tea. Grab your breakfast on the way. The trek is not long, but fascinating. The path meanders along the course of a dancing rivulet, also called Sirikhola. In Nepali, khola means a small stream. The rivulet has in fact given the hamlet its name.

 Creepers and orchids as well as tall trees border both sides of the road. The whiff of cardamom adds to the allure. The twitter of varied species of birds is amplified by the silence. The slope is gentle so you will need only about an hour to reach the sylvan hamlet, but many tarry a while to enjoy the journey.

 Sirikhola is the quintessential getaway in the lap of unspoilt nature. Apart from the DGHC Trekkers? Hut, there is a motel adjacent to Tshering?s tea stall. Trekkers coming down from Sandakphu or Phalut spend a night here before proceeding to Rimbik. Many come from town during the day, but few stay the night. 

 There is not much to do apart from enjoying the scenery over coffee. Dusk creeps up enshrouding the valley in eerie silence. The ripple of Sirikhola will lull you to sleep, while Himalayan birds at their most vocal will wake you up. Those interested in the feathered species, can spend the morning watching them. 

 Adventure enthusiasts can try 

 a gruelling climb to Mulley through rhododendrons and creepers. 

 Proceed to Phalut along a trail strewn with boulders via 

 Sabarkumb Top. Another arduous trek will take you to Sandakphu 

 via Gurdum. Starting from Manebhanjan, the trekkers complete 

 the round route of Sandakphu-Phalut at Rimbik. 

 Going 

 Travel 70 km along Hill Cart Road 

 from Siliguri to Ghoom via Kurseong. Rimbik is another 50 

 km via Sukhia Pokhri and Manebhanjan. Sirikhola is a 6-km 

 trek from Rimbik. Buses and taxis are available to Ghoom. 

 You can take a jeep or a Landrover to Rimbik via Sukhia 

 Pokhri and Manebhanjan.

 There is another motorable road 

 to Sukhia Pokhri via Mirik. The journey takes around seven 

 hours by road from the Tenzing Norgay Bus Terminal. The 

 trek to Sirikhola takes about an hour.

 The closest railway station (broad 

 gauge) is New Jalpaiguri. Bagdogra is the nearest airport

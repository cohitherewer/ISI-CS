 Undergrads in CU sights

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta University (CU) appears ready to introduce teaching of undergraduate courses by early next year. 

 With St Xavier?s and Presidency ? its two best affiliates ? set to go out of its purview as the state government has given its final nod for granting them autonomous status, CU, in its effort to ?compete? with the two colleges, has decided to begin BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses. Both St Xavier?s and Presidency are expected to function as autonomous institutions from the 2006-07 academic session.

 After discussing the proposal among members of various faculty councils, university officers will place the matter for further discussion before the syndicate ? the university?s highest policy-making body ? on Wednesday. 

 ?We are heading towards a very critical situation because more and more colleges will opt for the St Xavier?s and Presidency path to autonomy,? said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs), said on Saturday. 

 ?We will find it difficult to attract high-performing admission-seekers to our postgraduate courses. The sooner we introduce the undergraduate courses in our university, the better for us. We should immediately start teaching the courses if we have to compete with these colleges,? he added.

 An amendment to the university act is necessary to offer the three-year, general-degree courses. Steps are being taken to introduce the courses from the 2007-08 session.

 As of now, officers admitted on Sunday that Jadavpur University (JU) gets the cream of students at its undergraduate level. JU is able to retain the high-performing students as they mostly join the postgraduate courses of the same university after graduation. 

 The CU authorities fear that once the two colleges become autonomous, a bulk of the high-performers, who are unable to join JU, will opt for St Xavier?s and Presidency at the undergraduate level, and do their post-graduation, too, from these two colleges. 

 Students graduating from middle and low-ranking colleges will seek seats in the university?s postgraduate courses. It is learnt that Loreto College and Belur Vidya Mandir are next in line for autonomy.

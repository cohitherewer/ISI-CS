 Interiors of Mangio 

 in Alipore. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 As you dig into your Shrimp Tortelli 

 and Mediterranean Chicken Brochettes, you could be anywhere 

 in a Trattoria next to the Grunwald Woodlands for traditional 

 Tuscan, in a quaint Paris bistro or in a distinctive 

 Dusseldorf delicatessen

 Mangio (I eat in Italian) 

 in Alipore, the first seated all-day dining den from the 

 house of Kookie Jar offering latest trends in world 

 cuisine is very European in ambience and spread.

 In the age of fast-food frenzy, 

 Indias first Franco Costa-designed property 

 located in The Enclave mall promises tailor-made, 

 not readymade fare.

 We met Franco and his design 

 team at their fabulous stall in a bakery trade fair of Dusseldorf, 

 and immediately knew we wanted them to do our place. We 

 chased them for more than a year, before tracking them down 

 to La Spezia, a cosy village in a corner of Italy, close 

 to Genoa, recalls Lovey Barman.

 Lovey had kicked off Kookie Jar 

 with the Rawdon Street outlet more than two decades back 

 and now plans to carry the footprint forward on a pan-European 

 format with an Oriental twist here and there.

 The idea was to create a 

 place where you could troop in any time of day or evening 

 and treat yourself to a hearty European meal, breakfast 

 through dinner. We laid out our plans before Franco, whose 

 interiors of the patisserie Paul on the Champs Elyssees 

 had fascinated us, declares Loveys sister and 

 business partner Puja Kapur, who like Lovey never realised 

 when a hobby became serious business.

 The furniture to the bar counter, 

 the doors with stylised motifs to the giant mural depicting 

 an Italian paved streetscape was all shipped from the Franco 

 Costa workshop in Italy. 

 Franco insisted we have 

 some backless seating to impart a feisty feel, which resulted 

 in the cubist seating arrangements. We just gave them the 

 walls, the wiring and the bare floor. They brought in everything 

 else and put together the jigsaw, including the refrigerating 

 cabinets and waste trays, says Puja.

 From the classic Caesar Salad 

 with or without bacon to the Smoked Tomato Soup served with 

 bruschetta, the Home-made Fettuccini (with olive oil, onion, 

 mushrooms, pine and oregano), or the Foccacia with Tapenade 

 and Grilled Vegetable, the munch mix at Mangio is eclectic 

 and wholesome.

 We are doing European food 

 in a very contemporary context, including a salad and tapas 

 (Spanish for finger food) bar. We use a lot of cold meats 

 and cheeses, asparagus and parmesan, says chef Suvir.

 Mangio serves a Classic Club Sandwich 

 (triple-decker toasted sandwich of bacon, lettuce, tomato, 

 chicken and egg), or a Chicken Ciabata Sandwich (rubbed 

 with pesto, spicy fried chicken thigh) and a choice of omelettes, 

 even at lunch or dinner.

 For the main course, one can try 

 Mushroom Sheesh Kebabs, Layers of Potato Roesti and Multigrain 

 Pancakes, Lamb Chops, Grilled Prawns or a Tenderloin Steak. 

 Then there are Mangio signatures like the Baked Fish 

 in Paper, adds Lovey.

 For a wholesome breakfast a 

 rarity in town there are assorted pastries, Chicken Schnitzel, 

 Bacon and Onion Ranchero, Potato Croquettes, Green Pea and 

 Spinach Steak or Asparagus Cheese Toast.

 And, of course, the Kookie Jar 

 touch can be felt in sinful desserts like Caramelised Rosemary 

 Apple Tart, Orange Creme Brulee, Molten Chocolate Cake or 

 Raspberry Cheesecake.

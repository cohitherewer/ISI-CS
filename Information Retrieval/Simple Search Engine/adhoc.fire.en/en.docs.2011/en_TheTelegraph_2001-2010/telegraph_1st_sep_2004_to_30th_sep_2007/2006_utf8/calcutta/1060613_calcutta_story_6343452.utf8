 Sergeants shine as saviours

 One was rushing to escort Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi to the Assembly; the other was busy tackling traffic.

 Yet, on Monday afternoon, when it came to lending a helping hand on the city roads, neither sergeant thought twice.

 While Prosenjit Chatterjee ensured that a wrecker dragged a broken-down ambulance carrying a patient to a nursing home, Vinod Singh, of the Vidyasagar Setu Traffic Guard, saw to it that a lost bag containing valuable documents was returned to its owner.

 At the end of the day, both said they had ?just done their duty?.

 The first incident occurred near Alipore Mint. Around 1.50 pm, Pronab Kumar Adak was struggling with pain as the ambulance that was carrying him from Singur, in Hooghly, suddenly came to a grinding halt.

 Chatterjee was riding past the ambulance on his motorcycle when he saw the driver trying hard in the scorching heat to set things right.

 ?I joined the driver in pushing the ambulance, but it would not budge. I called for help but no one came forward. It seemed a lost case when I spotted a wrecker,? Chatterjee recalled.

 Responding to his request, the driver of the wrecker tugged the ambulance along, escorted by the sergeant, up the Taratala flyover, to Ekbalpur Nursing Home. 

 At the clinic, Chatterjee ensured that Adak, nursing a serious head injury, received proper treatment. The man could not speak but managed to catch a glimpse of his saviour.

 For Vinod Singh, though, words of gratitude flowed aplenty when he handed over the lost bag to its owner, Pradip Bose of Bangalpara First Lane, in Howrah.

 Bose was riding his motorcycle when the bag slipped off the vehicle and fell near Eden Gardens. By the time Singh arrived on the spot ? having learnt about the bag lying on the road from a bus driver ? it was gone. The driver of a private bus had picked it up.

 ?I chased the bus and stopped it at the Hastings crossing. The bag had two account payee cheques for Rs 4,700 each and several documents. I found out the telephone number of the owner after scanning the papers and contacted him. He broke down in joy,? Singh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High trial, low repeat 

 That could well be the fate of the travel trend from here to Southeast Asia if the journey remains an ordeal 

 This was Pattaya. At a seaside hotel, a conference had just ended. The participants, some 80 of them, were all members of a sales team of an Indian company. As they exited the conference hall, a pleasant surprise awaited them. Each was presented with a nice cardholder and a hefty discount coupon that could be availed at the Bangkok airport on their way out. No, this was not from the Indian company whose conference it was. Neither was it a farewell gift from the hotel that hosted the conference. The tourism authority of Thailand was making this gesture to make sure that the participants of the conference went back feeling special and even grateful. Maybe some of them would come back.

 Not only Thailand, travelling to Malaysia and Singapore has become the flavour of the times in India, especially from the eastern part. The entire holiday market is now looking east. There are many contributors to this trend. Political uncertainty in Nepal, fatigue with Puri and Darjeeling, cheap air fares, inexpensive hotels, all have contributed significantly. Arguably, the clincher is the pleasure of going abroad.

 Competition from Indian destinations cannot stack up against the lures of Southeast Asia. True, the air fares in India are dropping. Very few will debate that India has far more to offer in terms of natural splendour. But after all, a holiday in Malaysia is not merely keeping up with the Joneses; it is a weapon to beat the Joneses hollow.

 There is just one snag. Or more aptly, there is this ray of hope for the Indian holiday industry. The airlines of these countries are acting in a very peculiar fashion. On the one hand they are offering irresistible fares. Yet the timings of their flights are far from passenger-friendly. Flights to Thailand and Singapore leave Indian shores well after midnight. By then you have already spent a couple of stressful hours at the airport.

 First, the airlines staffs at the check-in counter and then the three governmental authorities ? immigration, customs and security personnel ? have made it abundantly clear that they really do not approve of your taking a flight out of India. Having gone through the ordeal, you now get into the aircraft. The wheels of the plane retract into the belly of the aircraft. You heave a sigh of relief. The tension is released but the discomfort mounts. You realise that the seat is as good or as bad as the seat in the bus that you chartered for the office picnic.

 One suspects that there is a very smart reason why the airlines have scheduled their flights so. There are an overwhelming number of passengers on these flights who are carriers of foreign goods that you and I buy on the streets of Calcutta. As passengers they are a difficult lot to handle. So the counter strategy is to fly them at a time when they are likely to be least obnoxious. That is why on your maiden voyage in the sky you had the moon for company and not the sun.

 So what does it do to the marketing game? Low fares, cheap hotels, exotic locales have won. You are on the flight. In any case how could you anticipate how painful the journey would be? Perhaps the first time around you may even tolerate all this as it is novel for you. Your inexperience prompts you to believe that this is the way people go abroad. The moot point is whether you would feel as tolerant the next time around. If you do not, then the travel to Southeast Asia will become like many other products, a high trial and low repeat purchase service.

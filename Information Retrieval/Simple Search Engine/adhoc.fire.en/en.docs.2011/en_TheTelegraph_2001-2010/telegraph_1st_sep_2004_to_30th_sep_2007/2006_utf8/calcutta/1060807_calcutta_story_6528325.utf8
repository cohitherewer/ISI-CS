 Nature study beyond textbooks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The environmental studies syllabus in ICSE schools in Calcutta and elsewhere will soon undergo a makeover. 

 The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations had last year introduced environmental studies as a compulsory subject to comply with a directive of the Supreme Court.

 The apex court had directed the boards to introduce environmental studies as a compulsory subject in schools to create awareness among students about nature and the problems faced by it. 

 The council has now decided to bring about changes in the syllabus of the subject to make it more interesting.

 If the students do not have interest or knack in environmental studies, there is no point in making them attend classes on it. We need to foster their interest. Therefore, it is important to take the subject beyond the textbooks, said G. Arathoon, deputy secretary of the council. 

 In an attempt to train teachers on how to tackle the new syllabus, the council had organised a workshop at its Calcutta office from July 19 to July 25. More than 300 teachers, including principals, from all over the country took part. Two environmental experts from Dehra Dun conducted the interactive sessions.

 Unlike in the case of conventional subjects, students may not be looking to score high marks in environmental studies. What is important is the knowledge about their surroundings. We noticed that many teachers didnt have the right outlook; they treated the subject exactly like other subjects, said Arvind K. Chalasani, one of the trainers. 

 At the end of the workshop, the teachers were given guidelines and suggestions. 

 Every city or town has its environment-related problems. The students should be motivated to build up opinion on local environmental issues. For instance, students in Calcutta should be encouraged to deal with problems like filling up of wetlands, stated environment expert Harendra Chakhaiyal.

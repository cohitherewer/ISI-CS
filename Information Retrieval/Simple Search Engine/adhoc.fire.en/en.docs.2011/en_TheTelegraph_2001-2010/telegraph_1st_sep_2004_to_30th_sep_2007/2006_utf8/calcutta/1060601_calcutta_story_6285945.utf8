 Healing herbs haul at army hub

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 The moat around Fort William, in the heart of the smoke-and-sound-spewing city, hides a rich selection of medicinal plants, as the Calcutta chapter of WWF has found during a survey.

 The plants are being studied and preserved by the organisation, which has failed to find a richer crop anywhere else in the city. Lack of human interference has led to the rapid growth of the medical plants, opined the researchers.

 Over the past six years, WWF has been conducting studies on medicinal plants in the state. The programmes kicked off with a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-sponsored study in the hills of Purulia.

 In tandem with it, studies and development work have been undertaken in the Sunderbans, Jalpaiguri (in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research, National Biodiversity Authority and the state forest department) and other places.

 In Calcutta, WWF has been distributing literature on medicinal plants and seedlings in schools. ?Some schools and Barrackpore Cantonment are growing such plants,? said WWF state head Colonel Shakti Banerjee. 

 According to project leader Suman Karmakar, the time has come to publish some of the findings and take the work forward. 

 The WWF claims to have discovered four new species of medicinal plants over the past six years. ?Unlike Kerala or Tamil Nadu, such a study was never conducted in West Bengal, though the biodiversity here is just as rich,? said Karmakar.

 In Purulia, the WWF researchers ran a block-by-block scan for medicinal and aromatic plants and people who know about their uses. 

 ?At first, no one wanted to share their knowledge with us. Then, when we explained that this was the only way to save the hills, they agreed,? Karmakar recalled.

 Panchet Hill was chosen as the base of the Purulia survey because the Rajas of Gorapanchapur were said to have brought ayurvedic plants with them from Madhya Pradesh. At Ayodhya Hills, the focus was the effects of power projects on the region.

 At both places, the nearest health centres are at least 25 km away, so the local residents are dependent on the plants for cures. ?We visited different melas to locate ayurvedic practitioners and learn the uses of various leaves, shoots, roots, seeds and fruits. Each tribe puts the plants to different use,? explained Karmakar.

 Apart from Sharpagandha (Rauvolfia), which is good for high blood pressure, Ashwagandha (Withania), an anti-depressant, Gurmar (Gymnema), which helps combat diabetes, and Bhuiamla (Phyllantus), a cure for jaundice, the WWF team identified mixtures and salves for skin diseases, arthritis, malnutrition and fractures in Purulia.

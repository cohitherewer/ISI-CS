 Residents of Palm Avenue, the chief minister?s neighbourhood, woke up on Friday to the sound of an explosion ? a gang had hurled a bomb barely 150 metres from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s residence.

 Three of the gangsters, who raided the locality allegedly to murder a Congress leader, managed to sneak into the security ring around Bhattacharjee?s apartment after being chased by a 100-strong group of local residents. They were pinned down by Special Action Force personnel and arrested.

 Three more were arrested in the evening. ?All have been charged with attempt to murder and entering into a criminal conspiracy. Nine bombs were seized from them,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (headquarters). 

 Reacting to the incident, Bhattacharjee said at Writers? Buildings: ?Some goons had hurled bombs. Forget about it.?

 Police said three motorcycles, carrying nine youths, had pulled up in front of the Bondel Road house of Bappa Ghosh, former Youth Congress president of south Calcutta, around seven in the morning. 

 Ghosh was anticipating the attack, as some people, armed with hockey sticks, had turned up at his house on Thursday morning as well. He had fled through the back door and alerted his supporters in the area.

 On Friday morning, 100 of his supporters, split into groups, had taken up position around the house. ?The attackers smelt trouble immediately after entering Bondel Road,? said an officer.

 Chased by the group, two motorcycles turned right and fled. ?But the third turned left and hit a blind lane that ends in a wall. There?s a small gate, though which one can pass only on foot,? said Ghosh.

 The three got off and hurled a bomb at the leaders? supporters, who were still on their trail. They then crossed the gate and ran towards the chief minister?s residence. 

 Ghosh alleged the attack was masterminded by former state Congress chief Somen Mitra and accused police of ignoring his complaint on Thursday?s attack. Ghosh is a supporter of Mitra?s rival in the party, Adhir Chowdhury.

 Mitra denied the allegation.

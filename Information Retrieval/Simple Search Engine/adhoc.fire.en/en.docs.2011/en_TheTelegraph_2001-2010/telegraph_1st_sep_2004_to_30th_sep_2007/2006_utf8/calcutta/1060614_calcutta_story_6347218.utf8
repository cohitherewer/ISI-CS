The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Target to phase out deep tubewells

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Left Front board of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) plans to make the city deep tubewell-free by 2009. 

 Even after the setting up of additional treatment plants at Palta, establishment of new plants at Jorabagan and Watgunge and augmentation of the Garden Reach waterworks, 350 deep tubewells are needed to cater to the requirement of potable water of about 160,000 families.

 Settlements on either side of EM Bypass and in Behala and Ranikuthi are dependent on the deep tubewells for their water supply.

 According to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, a portion of the proceeds of the sale of civic land adjacent to EM Bypass would be utilised for new water supply projects. 

 ?We have already floated a tender for a 99-year lease on a 5.54-acre plot near the Bypass. The money will be used to set up water plants,? stated municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Two water supply projects have been chalked out by the CMC and the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority (CMWSA). They are expected to be executed under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNURM).

 The CMC will set up a 30- million-gallon-a-day (MGD) water treatment plant at Dhapa and the CMWSA will build a 60 MGD water treatment plant as part of the third phase of the Garden Reach waterworks augmentation scheme. The cost of the projects has been pegged around Rs 300 crore. 

 The state government has asked the civic body to share the cost of setting up the new treatment plant at Garden Reach.

 Both the CMC and the CMWSA have sent their proposals to New Delhi for approval under the JNURM scheme.

 Under the scheme, 35 per cent of the project cost is borne by the Centre, while the state government pays 15 per cent of the bill.

 Chief engineer (water supply) of the CMC Bibhas Maity said the civic body now supplies 335 million gallons of water to the city. 

 Of the amount, about 20 million gallons come from deep tubewells.

 ?Deep tubewells are neither good for public health nor for the environment. Hence, the civic authorities have decided to phase them out,? observed Maity.

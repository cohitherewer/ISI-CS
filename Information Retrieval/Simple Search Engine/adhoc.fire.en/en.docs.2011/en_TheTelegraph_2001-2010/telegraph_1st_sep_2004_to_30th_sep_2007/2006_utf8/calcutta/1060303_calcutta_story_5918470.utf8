 Closure cry at schools

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The authorities of Anglo-Indian schools and Christian missionaries under various denominations on Thursday decided to keep classes suspended on April 4 to close ranks against alleged government interference.

 The one-day closure will protest the government passing a bill in the state Assembly on February 17, making it mandatory for all minority schools, aided by the government to pay their staff salaries, to induct teachers through the West Bengal School Service Commission.

 ?We have the right to appoint our own teachers,? asserted Father Faustine Brank, president of the education cell of Bangiya Christiya Parisheba.

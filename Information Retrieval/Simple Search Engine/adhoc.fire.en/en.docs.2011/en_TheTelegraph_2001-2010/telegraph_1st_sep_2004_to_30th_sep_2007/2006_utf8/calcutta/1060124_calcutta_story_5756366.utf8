The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CalTel?s free land line offer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Yet another scheme from Calcutta Telephones to attract customers. 

 Any Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) subscriber in the CalTel area with an average monthly bill of Rs 2,000 for the past six months will be provided another B-phone (land line) connection free.

 Officials said the monthly rental of Rs 180 would not be required for the new connection, which can be used only for making calls to BSNL B-phones or mobile phones. 

 ?We are also taking into account the regularity of payment before offering the new connection,? said S.P. Chakraborty, CalTel chief general manager. If a subscriber surrenders the original connection, the new phone will be automatically disconnected.

 The move follows a series of woo-customer schemes ? Abhinaba, Sulabh and Maha Sulabh ? launched by BSNL to stem the steady slide in its customer base. 

 In the past two years, nearly 100,000 subscribers have surrendered their B-phones. The number is nearly three million across the country. ?Declining B-phone connections is a global phenomenon and one of the main reasons is the popularity of mobile phones,? said a CalTel official.

 This is borne out by the phenomenal rise in the customer base of BSNL?s mobile phone service ? CellOne.

 With very little publicity, the number of CellOne customers has shot up from 26,000 on May 12, 2004, when the service was relaunched, to around 400,000 now.

 The B-phone service, on the other hand, comprises 1.3 million subscribers.

 The rise in the number of CellOne customers has resulted in frequent network clogging, despite the fact that around 250 base transmission station towers have been set up in the CalTel area.

 The authorities are planning to instal another 900 towers in the city and its surrounding areas.

 To boost its sagging B-phone base, the authorities in January last year had introduced DataOne broadband (Internet) service. But the move seems to have flopped.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Power games ground flying club

 Winds of Change?: Behala Flying Club. 

 A Telegraph picture

 Nanda Lahiri: Behala Flying Club is the landmark of Behala. Spread over 300 acres in west Behala, the institute, once a premier flight-training centre, has been lying all but defunct. Do you have any plan to renovate it? 

 I had written to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to look into its development. But he has done nothing about it. The main problem is that its board members are former MLAs, who don?t have any power to take any initiative or decision. At present, many investors have offered to run it. During the current Assembly session, I had spoken to the transport minister about the tenders. The club belongs to the Central government and therefore, steps will be taken accordingly. Moreover, our demand will remain the same. The evicted families should be rehabilitated along with the other development work.

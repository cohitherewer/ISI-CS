The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Wind blows in winter

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bring out the woollens. Winter is finally here. 

 The minimum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 13.4 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. 

 The mercury is expected to dip over the next 48 hours. It will get a little colder. We expect the minimum temperature to hover around 13 degrees Celsius, said a Met official.

 A clear sky and unhindered passage of the North Wind from north Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir to Calcutta and the south Bengal districts are behind the drop in temperature. According to the weatherman, the current atmospheric condition is favourable for the cold wind to blow in the city and the adjoining districts. The temperature will not rise unless there is a low-pressure formation.

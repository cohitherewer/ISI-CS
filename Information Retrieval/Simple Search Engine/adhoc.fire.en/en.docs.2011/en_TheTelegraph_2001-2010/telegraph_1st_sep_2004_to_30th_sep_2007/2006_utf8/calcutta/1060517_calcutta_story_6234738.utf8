Amelie star AUDREY TAUTOU on playing Sophie Neveu 

in The Da Vinci Code

Devouring the book: In September 2004, I went 

to Mexico on vacation, and I took the novel with me. I devoured it in only a few 

days. I found it well put together, very effective. Rather cinematic, as well, 

in the way it?s divided up. But of course, I didn?t know it was going to be adapted? 

Breaking news: When I came back from my vacation, 

suddenly in Toronto, all the journalists were saying ? ?Congratulations on getting 

picked for The Da Vinci Code directed by Ron Howard.? I didn?t even know 

the film was in preparation. After a short detour to Paris, I went back to Mexico. 

There I got a telephone call from my agent, who told me that Ron Howard wanted 

to meet me. 

Sophie and I: I thought I was too young compared 

to the character in the book, Sophie Neveu. In the US, I am known for Amelie 

and I thought this image, which is very strong because of the film?s success, 

did not match Sophie Neveu?s. I also thought Ron Howard had to consider me too 

young and too sweet for the role. 

Destiny calling: For several hours I got a 

series of contradictory emails, until finally I had an appointment for tests in 

Los Angeles. The place looked like the Francis Huster room at the Cours Florent 

(the Paris drama school where Tautou studied) ? a small stage facing rows of seats. 

There were Ron Howard, the producer Brian Grazer and the casting director. Tom 

Hanks joined us. The meeting must have lasted two hours, and at the very end ? 

this is how sure I was of not getting the part ? I took out my camera to get a 

souvenir snapshot of this memorable moment, and to prove to my sister that I really 

had met Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. 

The missed calls: My agent (had) told me the 

choice was down to two. That evening, after I?d turned off my cell phone, I suddenly 

saw I?d missed 11 calls in half an hour, all from the same American phone number! 

I listened to my messages: I was asked to call Ron Howard directly on his cell 

phone. When I reached him, he was busy scouting locations at the Louvre. That?s 

when he told me, ?Ok, it?s you.? It was all done in 10 days!

Tom can act: He (Tom Hanks) has no lack or 

defect that I know of. It?s insane! He is so professional it?s uncanny, but in 

spite of his status, he is infallibly available and nice. For a director, working 

with him must be a dream come true. He has extraordinary technique, he can change 

his way of acting to make the editing process easier later because he knows exactly 

how it all works.

Raving about Ron: He adores actors and loves 

directing them. He is very receptive and his enthusiasm is contagious. He?s very 

curious and without prejudice. He doesn?t rest on his laurels, his power or influence. 

He?s open to everything, and at the same time he is more prepared than anybody. 

He always shoots with at least two cameras, if not four or eight. Nothing escapes 

him and everything is arranged with amazing precision.

 Audrey Tautou in The Da Vinci Code

Is that me? I never go to rushes? So, I saw 

the same trailer as everybody else. When I saw the trailer, I almost made fun 

of myself, my hairstyle, the intensity of the car chases? It makes me laugh to 

see myself in the kind of film I had never imagined being in. In this sort of 

role, you imagine a gorgeous toned Amazon rather than a mischievous little French 

girl. I just hope people won?t wonder why Ron came looking for me! 

A new life: My greatest joy is telling myself 

that I am in the kind of film ? action, suspense, American blockbuster ? that 

I am likely never to be in again. That amuses me. My greatest fear, given the 

scale of the project and the expectations, has to do with fame and popularity. 

I hope I can continue to live the same life I have now.

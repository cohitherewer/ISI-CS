 Cops chase drunk woman

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A woman in her early 30s led cops on a merry dance for a couple of hours late last night after getting drunk.

 Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said the woman entered a bar in the New Market police station area along with two male companions around 9 pm on Thursday. 

 She lost control of herself after getting drunk, said Chatterjee. She tried to smash liquor bottles when the bar attendants refused her more drinks. Her companions fled the spot to avoid trouble.

 When officers brought her to New Market police station, she kept shouting at them for over half-an-hour before running out and hailing a taxi to Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Spotting a jeep of the New Market police, she started running along Lalbazar Street-BB Ganguly Street. Policemen gave chase and brought her back to the police station. The woman, arrested for creating nuisance, was released on a bail bond of Rs 20 at Bankshal court on Friday.

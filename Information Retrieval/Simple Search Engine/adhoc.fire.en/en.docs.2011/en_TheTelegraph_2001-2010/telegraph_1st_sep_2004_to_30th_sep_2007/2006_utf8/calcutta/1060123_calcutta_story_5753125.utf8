The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Job training to protect forest 

 ATANU RAHA, director, Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, and additional principle chief conservator of forests, met readers of The Telegraph in his office to answer their queries. Participants included Sourish Misra, Kajal Ghosh, Sonatan Mondol, Sandeep Banerjee, Baidyanath Sen, Subhadyuti Datta, R.K. Gupta, Sanjit Das and Rathin Naskar

Sandeep Banerjee: Restrictions imposed in the Sunderbans reserve forest area pose a serious threat to the livelihood of villagers. Do you have plans to create jobs for them?

 The main problem is that the villagers are dependent on the jungle for livelihood. The non-forest stretch of the Sunderbans, between Basirhat in North 24-Parganas and Namkhana in South 24-Parganas, is inhabited by 3.9 million people. Most are poor and enter the forest regularly to collect honey, wood and fish. They are often used by smugglers for poaching tiger or deer. We have been training the Sunderbans residents to run poultry farms, duck farms and even grocery shops.

Kajal Ghosh: How many tigers are there in the Sunderbans? 

Why are they called Royal Bengal Tigers?

 According to the last tiger census, the number of big cats in the Sunderbans is between 240 and 280. The reserve forest area can support 250 tigers.

 The Sunderbans tiger is of the Bengal variety, which is widespread in Nepal, north and south India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The species became known as Royal Bengal Tiger following King George V?s hunting trip to the Sunderbans.

Sanjit Das: Why are Royal Bengal Tigers maneaters? Is there any specific reason?

 Sunderbans tigers are omnivorous. They eat everything ? from fish and crabs to human beings.

Sanjit Das: To prevent tiger attacks on people, you had installed clay human models in the forest with electricity passing through them and distributed masks among woodcutters. What was the result?

 The tigers are intelligent and did not touch the clay models. It is the habit of Royal Bengal Tigers to attack from the back, so the woodcutters wore the masks on the back of their heads. The trick did not work. 

Sonatan Mondol: How many people are killed annually by the tigers in the Sunderbans? Are the victims? families compensated? Also, what is the market price of tiger skin?

 According to our records, on an average eight to 10 people are killed every year by tigers. If someone with a valid permit is killed by a tiger, the family gets a compensation of Rs 50,000. 

 A tiger skin has no market price, but it certainly has street value. It is sold at Rs 25,000 per sq ft. We confiscated two tiger skins and arrested 17 smugglers last year. We burn the confiscated animal skins.

Subhadyuti Datta: Any special features of the 2006 tiger census?

 An improved technology will be used for the tiger headcount for the first time this year. Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun, and Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, will assist us in the survey. 

 In February, we will be undertaking our most interesting project, that of tagging four tigers with radio collars. The movement and behaviour of the animals in their natural habitat will be monitored with the help of the US Argos satellite.

Sourish Misra: Dumping of polythene bags in the rivers by tourists has been continuing unabated in the Sunderbans. Why don?t you launch an awareness campaign?

 The Sunderbans ecosystem is fragile and there are specific government orders against dumping of plastic trash and noise pollution in the region. We have been conducting awareness campaigns among the launch operators and warning them about cancelling their registrations if they violate the orders.

 We also patrol the rivers between December 25 and January 1 to prevent tourists from using loudspeakers and causing noise pollution. However, there?s no bar on radio.

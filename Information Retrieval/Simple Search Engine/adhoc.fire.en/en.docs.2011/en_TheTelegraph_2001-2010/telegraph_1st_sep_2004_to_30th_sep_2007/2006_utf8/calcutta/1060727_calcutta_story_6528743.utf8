The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Taxing time for tax-payer

 - Salaried seek to file returns, turned away by post offices

 A STAFF REPORTER

 ?Now you can file your income tax return at post offices also? The facility is available on all working days from Wednesday, 26th July 2006 onwards,? read the income-tax department?s public proclamation, complete with tips on ?how to file?.

 But what was meant to ease the tax-payer?s troubles ? with six days to go for the salaried ? only managed to add to them, as many Calcuttans spent Wednesday running from post-office pillar to tax-office post.

 With most designated post offices refusing to accept the tax documents ? claiming they hadn?t received any notification ? the income-tax department lay the blame squarely at the door of the postal department.

 ?We have already circulated the list of post offices that are supposed to accept the returns. It is the postal department?s duty to notify the post offices about the decision. The chief postmaster-general met our commissioner this morning to discuss the matter,? said Dinabandhu Naskar, chief public relations officer, income-tax department (eastern region). 

 Chief postmaster-general S.K. Das admitted to the ?teething troubles? on Wednesday and held out hope for Thursday. ?The proposal was finalised on Monday and we received the order from Delhi only on Tuesday afternoon. We are trying our best to iron out the problems. From tomorrow, all the designated post offices in Calcutta will be notified,? Das told Metro.

 Those thwarted in their bid to file returns at a post office on Wednesday would, however, think twice before heading for the head post offices at Alipore, Burrabazar, Barasat, Beleghata, Howrah, Park Street, Tollygunge, Belghoria and Cossipore, or even the GPO.

 Once-bitten Prerna Verma, an executive with a private company in central Calcutta, spent a good two-and-a-half hours on Wednesday afternoon trying in vain to file her returns. 

 ?When I called up Yogayog Bhavan, I was told that Beleghata head post office, which is close to my residence, was accepting the returns? But the staff there seemed to have no clue about the scheme. The head postmaster told me that he, too, had come to know about the scheme from the papers but hadn?t received any department circular yet,? Prerna explained.

 At Yogayog Bhavan, she was given a runaround, from desk to desk, till she was finally advised to head for the GPO. 

 ?I am not taking any more chances at a post office; I will go to Bamboo Villa instead,? Prerna averred.

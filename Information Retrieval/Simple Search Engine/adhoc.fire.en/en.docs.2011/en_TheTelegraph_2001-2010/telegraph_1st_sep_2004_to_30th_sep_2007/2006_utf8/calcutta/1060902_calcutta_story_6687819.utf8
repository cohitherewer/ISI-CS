 LPG outlet count fuels hot words

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The oil companies have made it clear to the state that they will not raise the number of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) outlets in the city if the demand did not rise.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury on Friday met representatives of various oil companies, in the presence of a senior Union petroleum ministry official.

 According to transport department officials, the meeting turned into a war of words between the state government and the oil companies over setting up of more outlets.

 While the government asked the oil firms to set up more outlets to make the green fuel easily available, the oil companies said the count could be raised only if sales increased.

 I have asked the oil firms to set up at least another 10 pumps across the city, said Chowdhury.

 Indian Oil (IOC) officers pointed out that the 10 existing LPG outlets can supply 900 metric tonnes of gas every month, but the average sale is 200 metric tonnes.

 IOC deputy general manager (LPG) A.C. De said: Let the state make efforts to increase the number of LPG-run vehicles and we are furnishing a guarantee that there will be no problem in getting the green fuel.

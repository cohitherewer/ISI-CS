The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Minister, animal resources development, government of West Bengal

 There are no reports of samples testing positive about bird flu in Bengal. Besides, the state government has made it clear that there is no problem in consuming properly cooked chicken or eggs. Even chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has appealed to people to consume chicken. Doesn?t the state have a responsibility towards the health of its citizens? But all such assurances have done little to allay fears. Somehow, people seem to have reacted sharply to media reports and have decided to shun chicken. This is extremely unfortunate. People in China have declared that they are not afraid of consuming an affected chicken after cooking it properly but here, we are simply not ready to believe in any scientific explanation.

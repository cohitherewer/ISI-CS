 SUDIP BANERJEE

 Chairman, West Bengal Pollution Control Board 

 We are catching the vendors because the law prohibits anybody to produce, store or even use plastic carrybags of a particular thickness and dimension. Moreover, we feel that penalising some vendors will generate fear and discourage others to store, use and distribute illegal plastic carrybags. If that happens, then the problems related to plastic waste will be minimised. This model was relatively successful in banning noisy firecrackers and we feel that the same will happen in case of plastic carrybags. And let me clarify that we are not targeting only the small vendors but the big producers of plastic carry bags as well.

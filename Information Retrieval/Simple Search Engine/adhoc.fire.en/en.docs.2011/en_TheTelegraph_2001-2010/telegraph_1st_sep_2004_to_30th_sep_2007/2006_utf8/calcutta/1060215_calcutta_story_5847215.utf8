The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Greens stall realty bid

 - Delhi petitioned on attempt to alter wetlands character

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The green lobby knocked on the doors of the Union environment ministry on Tuesday, protesting the state environment department?s bid to green-signal real estate projects falling within the East Calcutta Wetlands.

 ?We?ve sent an intimation to Siddhartha Kaul, director of the Wetlands Programme under the ministry for environment and forests, informing him of the environment department?s bid to change the character of the wetlands. We?ve appended clippings of Metro to support our letter,? said Parikshit Gautam, director (fresh water and wetlands), World Wildlife Fund (WWF), India.

 ?The government of India, as well as the West Bengal government, had agreed to designate this site under the Ramsar convention. There has to be consultation and discussion before any changes are made,? he added over the telephone from Delhi.

 WWF?s state wing took up the matter after it was revealed that the environment department had not made any changes in its controversial table 28 of the East Calcutta Wetlands Bill, 2006, notifying dag numbers 771 to 775 in the Dhapa Manpur mouza as ?urban/rural settlements?.

 ?The Centre must put its foot down since the state environment department seems bent on introducing the bill in its present form in the current Assembly session,? said Colonel Shakti Ranjan Banerjee, state director, WWF, India.

 Meanwhile, land and land reforms minister Abdul Rezzak Mollah, who had raised the contentious issue with CPM state secretary Anil Biswas on Monday, said: ?I will raise the issue again with my party leaders on Thursday, when the bill is scheduled to be tabled in the Assembly.?

 The environment department has overlooked objections from the land and land reforms department about the East Calcutta Wetlands Ordinance, promulgated last year.

 On December 12, the land and land reforms department wrote to environment secretary Asim Barman, pointing out that an inspection by the Institute of Wetland Management and Ecological Design of plots of dag numbers 771 to 775 in the mouza had shown the area to be a waterbody.

 ?Since the promoters have now moved Supreme Court? they might take advantage of the classification of the plot as mentioned in the Ordinance,? states the letter.

 Barman claims he knows nothing about the letter.

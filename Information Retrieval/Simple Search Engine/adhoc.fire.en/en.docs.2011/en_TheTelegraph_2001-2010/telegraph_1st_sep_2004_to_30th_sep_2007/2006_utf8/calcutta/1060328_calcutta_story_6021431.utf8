 From Renoir to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, from Rashomon to Rang De Basanti ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s bastion of culture has fallen to the charge of the Bollywood brigade.

 After spreading multiplex magic, campus craze and disc delight, the now-anthemic ?Aye sala?? is reverberating through Nandan twice every day.

 Starting March 25, the film aiming to awaken a generation is calling Calcuttans in large numbers, afternoon and evening.

 But why is Nandan playing host to Aamir Khan and his band of boys in their masti ka pathshala? 

 ?It is true that Nandan shows cerebral films, but we also want to screen films that the masses can enjoy,? says Nandan CEO Nilanjan Chatterjee. ?Hindi film distributors do approach us and this time, we responded because Rang De Basanti is a good film.?

 The definition of ?good? Bollywood fare in the Nandan lexicon, an official says, is a film with ?good social content, a basic message and not overt in terms of sex or violence?. 

 That?s what had brought Black, Amu and Iqbal to Nandan last year. If Black and Iqbal dealt with physical disability, Amu was about the aftermath of the Sikh riots. So Rang De?is the first true-blue Bollywood blockbuster to come to Nandan, song, dance and all.

 And the results are already showing. The first-day-first-show on Saturday, which is usually ?a little dull?, say officials, almost touched 100 per cent occupancy.

 And by Sunday evening, house-full signs dangled at the ticket counters, to the surprise of many a Nandan regular.

 The reasons for the rush are two-fold ? the popularity and price factors. The ticket tag ? Rs 20, Rs 40 and Rs 50, against the Rs 150-plus pricing at the multiplexes ? being easy on the pocket, has promoted many to brave the March heat and queue up at Nandan.

 And the crowd is a mix of Rang De? repeats and first-timers. ?I didn?t have the opportunity to catch the film before and Nandan provides the best of facilities at very affordable rates. The plex rates are too steep,? says MBA student Sougata, before stepping in for the 2 pm show on Monday.

 ?I didn?t get to see the film before and this time, I just had to see it because it?s running at Nandan, where the rates are something we can afford,? echoes graduate Antara, one among a gaggle of college-goers streaming in for the afternoon show.

 Then, there are others like Samapti Halder. ?I saw Rang De Basanti at INOX and wanted to see it again. The lower ticket rates here are a big help,? she smiles.

 If the winds of change are blowing through Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee? cultural bastion, Bollywood distributors aren?t complaining.

 ?Despite being a masala film, Rang De Basanti is unusual and has a social message. So, after the positive reaction and fantastic reviews, we approached Nandan. It?s a matter of prestige for us, as the hall is known to cater to a very niche audience,? says Aroon Sharma, distribution head, INOX, which is distributing the film here.

 And at Nandan, officials are happy that ?Bollywood is coming up with different kinds of films? and opening up a novel window of opportunity.

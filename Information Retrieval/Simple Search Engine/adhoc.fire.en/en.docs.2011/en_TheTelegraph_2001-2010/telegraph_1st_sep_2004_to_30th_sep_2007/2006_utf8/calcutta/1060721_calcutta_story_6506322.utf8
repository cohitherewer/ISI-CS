 Moments from True Caribbean 

 Pirates

 There is no evidence that the pirates ever buried treasure, announces Tim Prokop with a conviction that rings through the telephone line from California to Calcutta. The two-time Writers Guild award nominee, based in Los Angeles, has just completed filming a two-hour documentary on the pirates of the Caribbean for The History Channel, to go on air this Saturday and Sunday at 10 pm. 

 The film, True Caribbean Pirates, seeks to dispel many myths surrounding the romanticised figures with eye patches and peg legs. ?Pirate fact can be more appealing than pirate fiction,? laughs Prokop. 

 The show traces the origins and downfall of piracy through several individual pirates ? Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Henry Jennings, Ann Bonny, Calico Jack Rackham, Mary Read and Black Bart Roberts. ?So much has been written about pirates of which so much is inaccurate that we had to look carefully,? Prokop says. 

 Why weren?t there any treasures? ?Simple. They?d divide it straight off. Why would they go to the shore to dig a hole and bury it?? Popular imagination acted overtime. ?When Henry came back from the raid of Panama, people thought hey, that can?t be all he?s got. The rest must have been buried. Captain Kyd?s treasures were blown out of proportion. All he captured were two ships all his life!?

 Speaking of the research, Prokop flashbacks: ?I was surprised to find out that pirates could elect or dismiss a captain by vote and the loot was equally divided. In some gangs, the captain could have an extra share. And if one lost an eye or a hand in a fight, he could get compensation. The best democracies of the period existed on pirate ships.? 

 There?s more. Every ship had a ship?s article containing an agreed-upon set of rules, breaking which fetched specific penalties. ?Marooning could be one. That?s what happened to Johnny Depp in the first film of the Pirates series.? But mutiny, another essential element of pirate lore, was rare, happening mostly on merchant ships that had turned to piracy. 

 True Caribbean Pirates starts with Columbus making landfall in the Caribbean in 1492. ?As the Spanish reduced locals to a minority, a lot of gold and silver were being taken out. England, Holland and France could not compete with Spain. So they gave out letters of mark to privateers as legal licence to attack Spanish ships.? The first pirate profiled in the show, Henry Morgan, was knighted! 

 ?But they could see a nice Dutch ship and get tempted,? the writer-director chuckles, explaining how the line between legitimate privateering and piracy started blurring, right down to the golden age of pirates from 1713 to 1722. 

 Prokop had to guide a team of 200. ?We were greenlit by the channel last October, and from the start we hit the ground running.? The filming happened in eight days flat. ?We rolled two full units the whole time.? Four tall ships went out to the waters in Los Angeles, including a brig and a schooner. The land locations were shot in Puerto Rico. ?There aren?t many documentaries that actually attack a fort when they want to show a fort being attacked,? he recalls.

 Prokop toasts the flamboyance of the figures. ?They were doomed from the start once the countries turned against them. They could drink and dress like dandies in stolen clothes. After all, they were living just for the day.? As Long John Silver would sing in Treasure Island, ?Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum?.

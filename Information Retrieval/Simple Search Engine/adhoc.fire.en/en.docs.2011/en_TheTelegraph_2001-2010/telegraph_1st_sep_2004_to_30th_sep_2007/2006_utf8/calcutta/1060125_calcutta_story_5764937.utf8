The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 Growing up with the best 

Screen On amp; Off

Her debut might not have scored at the box-office, but 

Yahaan girl MINISSHA LAMBA has every big director knocking on her door, finds 

out Pratim D. Gupta

Till some time back, she was munching chocolate for 

an ad shoot, little knowing that her ?life-changing moment? was just round the 

corner. Even when she was jumping around to Gulzar?s obscure poetry ? Urzu 

durkut? ? in the forests of Kashmir, she had no clue of what lay beyond Yahaan. 

It was only when her phone kept ringing and offers kept pouring in that Minissha 

Lamba realised that she was indeed a lambi race ki ghodi?

Her debut vehicle didn?t exactly set the box-office 

ablaze but she did enough damage in the film to have everyone from Madhur Bhandarkar 

to Farhan Akhtar queue up outside her place. If that wasn?t enough, Provogue signed 

her on as brand ambassador for their new women?s line and before you could spell 

Minissha correctly, she was doing a Vanessa Mae in Himesh Reshammiya?s music video 

Tera suroor.

?Bollywood is a place where your dreams have a good 

chance of materialising,? smiles Minissha. ?I am happy that I have found something 

to do in life which I enjoy. You can say, I am ecstatic. To bag five big films 

in such short time is really great and now, I can say, I am here to stay.?

First up for the Delhi girl is Bhandarkar?s Corporate 

alongside the likes of Bipasha Basu, Kay Kay Menon and Sammir Dattani. ?I 

play this young Maharashtrian girl who has just graduated from a management school 

and aspires to be the top female executive in the country,? reveals Minissha. 

?She is not that kind of a girl who would forego her career for a married life. 

She comes from a middle-class background and has all her values in place. The 

character is not childishly naive and is very worldly wise. The film explores 

her journey from this MNC that she joins to eventually what happens to her.?

As expected, Minissha is all ga-ga over her Corporate 

director Bhandarkar. ?He was there to constantly guide me, something I need at 

this stage of my career,? she says. ?And he is so fun to be with, always joking 

around the sets.? She is even more impressed with co-star Bipasha. ?She may have 

this star aura around her, but underneath all that Bipasha is such a simple person. 

She knows everybody, from the spot boy to the focus-puller, by their first names.?

But it is her next release, Honeymoon Travels Pvt 

Ltd, produced by Farhan Akhtar and directed by his assistant Reema Kagti, 

that?s got Minissha most excited. ?It?s a supernatural feeling to do a Farhan 

Akhtar film,? she gushes. ?I was in splits when I was narrated the script. It 

is very funny. I am cast opposite Abhay Deol and that?s all I am allowed to say 

at the moment.?

Up next is the Suresh Krishna-directed Rocky, 

which will be Minissha?s first solo lead after Yahaan. ?It has Zayed Khan 

opposite me and is a romantic action film,? she says. ?I play this girl based 

in London who owns a travel agency and is completely in love with Zayed?s character. 

But he doesn?t respond to her at all and it?s only later that she realises there?s 

more to Zayed?s silence than what meets the eye. In an age of stylised action 

film, Rocky is a good old old-school way of film-making.?

That?s not all. Minissha has two more films in her 

kitty, which just keeps filling up. ?I am doing Raj Kaushal?s next film with Sanjay 

Dutt and Arshad Warsi. It?s a hilarious script and it will be fun shooting with 

the Munnabhai duo. Then there?s Flat opposite Kay Kay Menon which 

is a supernatural thriller.?

In between all these filmi assignments, Minissha 

has found time to promote Provogue and appear in Himesh Reshammiya?s music video. 

?For a newcomer like me, who is all of one film old, it was important for me to 

be visible because there will be at least an eight-month gap between my first 

and second releases,? she feels. ?So, the brand association and the video came 

at the right time.?

But doesn?t she feel sad to lose out to Vidya Balan 

in the Best Female Debut category in all the awards ceremonies? ?Even if her first 

film had come in some other year, there could have been two more stunning debuts 

in two other films,? Minissha replies. ?What is important is the fact that the 

industry is opening up to new talents and people like me are making it without 

any godfather. Bollywood has become so welcoming to newcomers and that?s really 

a refreshing change. As for the awards, well, they are just a celebration of a 

year gone by.?

Even at a time like this, when she is flooded with 

offers every passing day, Minissha dedicates her success to her Yahaan director 

Shoojit Sircar. ?If it wouldn?t have been for him, none of this would have been 

possible,? she says. ?He insisted I do that film. He had faith in me before I 

had faith in myself. He would use everything from kindness and empathy to screaming 

and abuses to teach me how to emote rightly. He is my only school.?

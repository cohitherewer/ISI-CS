 From the hypocrisy of politicians, who ?encourage? caste-based divisions, to the plight of students denied admission to educational institutions on the grounds of reservation, an erudite panel debated a host of issues at Crossword on Tuesday.

 The occasion was a panel discussion on veteran journalist and politician Arun Shourie?s latest book Falling Over Backwards ? An Essay against Reservations and against Judicial populism. Columnist Sunanda K. Datta-Ray, cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar and public relations consultant Rita Bhimani were in attendance, along with the author. ?We are in a world that demands specialisation. There is no job today where specialisation is not required. Yet, in India, excellence is under attack,? said Shourie, who didn?t mince words in voicing his ?reservations against reservation?.

 He declared: ?I am against reservation in any form. But that doesn?t mean that I want those with potential to be held back because they do not have access to facilities to improve themselves. Let the truly needy be identified and then let them be helped. I am only against general reservation. For then, the benefits go to a select few, those who are already able to provide for themselves.?

 ?If the word Dalit is taken out of its caste-bound connotation and comes to mean anyone who is oppressed, only then can reservation make a difference,? observed Datta-Ray.

 The audience participated enthusiastically in the discussion. One of them asked the author what right he had to take away the dreams of even one per cent of the backward castes whom reservation had helped. ?These are cliches and as I said, I am not against providing benefits to the needy,? replied Shourie.

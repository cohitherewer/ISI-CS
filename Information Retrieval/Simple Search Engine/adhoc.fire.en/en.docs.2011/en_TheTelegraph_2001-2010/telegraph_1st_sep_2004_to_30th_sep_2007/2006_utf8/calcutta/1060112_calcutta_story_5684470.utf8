 Church schools go south

 - After five sites in Rajarhat, land scouts out in Sonarpur

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 The Church of North India (CNI), that runs some of Calcutta?s best-known English-medium institutions, is now ready to open new schools south of the city within the next two years.

 About a year ago, the CNI had decided to set up new branches of some of its better-known schools in Rajarhat and along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass because of the city?s eastward expansion.

 Reverend P.S.P. Raju, Bishop of the Calcutta diocese of the CNI, said on Thursday that in view of the expansion of Garia and Sonarpur, on the city?s southern fringes, it was decided that new branches would be opened there as well.

 ?The number of applications from people living in the southern part of the city, seeking admissions to our schools, is increasing every year. We need to expand our schools not only in the east but also in the south,? said the bishop.

 ?To begin with, we have decided to open a new school immediately in south Calcutta, which will be a branch of the existing St John?s Diocesan institution,? the bishop said. 

 Last year, CNI had announced plans to set up branches of some popular schools like La Martiniere, Pratt Memorial and St James.

 The CNI schools have recently been accorded the Church nod to set up new branches in east as well as south Calcutta at their respective governing body meetings.

 The Church last year had targeted Rajarhat because of the large numbers of residential flats and houses coming up there. ?We have selected about five locations ? all beyond Vedic Village health resort ? in Rajarhat to set up the schools. The authorities of the schools concerned are now examining the process of finalising the sites,? the sources said.

 Since these sites will be too far from the new townships in the south, the Church authorities decided to open new schools in the south as well.

 The land for all the proposed schools will be purchased at market rates, Bishop Raju indicated. The Church will not approach the state government for land at subsidised rates.

 Every school opening a new branch has been asked to ensure that larger number of students belonging to the Christian community benefit from them.

 ?We want to expand our education system to definitely cater to the increasing need for quality education. At the same time, we want to reach out to the underprivileged class of people among the Christian community. There is a need to provide top-class education to deserving students in the community,? Reverend Raju said.

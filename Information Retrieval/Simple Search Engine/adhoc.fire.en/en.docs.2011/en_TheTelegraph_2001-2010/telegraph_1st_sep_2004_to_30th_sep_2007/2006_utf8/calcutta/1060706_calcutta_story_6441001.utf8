The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 New cheap carrier

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcuttans will soon have another low-cost, no-frills airline to board. IndiGo will launch operations in the city in August, with flights to Delhi and Guwahati. 

 The one-way fare to Delhi will be Rs 1,099 without taxes, lower than the fares of the other airlines operating on the sector.

 ?IndiGo has sent us its final plan for staring operations in Calcutta. We have allotted space to them,? stated a senior official of Calcutta airport.

 According to officials of the airline, it will be operating daily flights on the Delhi-Calcutta-Delhi and Calcutta-Guwahati-Calcutta routes.

 IndiGo is a subsidiary of InterGlobe Enterprises, a travel conglomerate with headquarters in Gurgaon. It will operate A320 Airbuses between Calcutta and Delhi and Calcutta and Guwahati. 

 This October, Indigo will launch a flight from Calcutta to Mumbai via Nagpur.

 The one-way fare to Mumbai will be Rs 1,749 (without taxes). For Guwahati, it will be Rs 1,399 (without taxes).

 The airline has expansion plans lined up from October 2006. According to the plans, IndiGo will start 30 flights across India and add new routes every month, said airline officials.

 ?With the low-end airfare falling to the level of railway fares, many more people will opt to fly,? observed Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of Travel Agents Federation of India.

 ?More people on a tight budget will choose to take flights. This will result in a boom in the travel and tourism industry in the eastern region,? he added. 

 Officials of Air Deccan, whose customers IndiGo threatens to lure away, said they were not perturbed by the low fares announced by the new entrant.

 ?We have done quite well in the city in June. The average load factor was about 80 per cent,? offered an Air Deccan official, over the telephone from Bangalore.

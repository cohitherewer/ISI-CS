The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Autos wrest fume rights

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 

 With the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government consistent in its green policy of taking one step forward and two steps back, Calcuttans must keep breathing in poison fumes.

 The latest U-turn in the fight against foul air is the transport department revoking its earlier order of banning three-wheelers more than 10 years old from city streets if they did not convert to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). 

 While the transport department has cited inadequate LPG outlets as the reason for the turnabout, sources said the decision has been forced by the CPMs labour wing Citu, which has considerable clout among auto drivers.

 Oil firms, meanwhile, have rubbished the governments excuse, claiming that enough outlets exist in the city and that they are ready to set up more if the demand rises.

 Of the 25,000-odd autorickshaws in and around the city, 10,000 are more than 10 to 15 years old. The governments ban order in June 2005 had prompted several operators to queue up at LPG fitment centres and almost an equal number to withdraw their vehicles.

 But following the rule rollback, theres no slamming the brakes on the poison-belchers any more.

 We have relaxed the earlier order and allowed old autos to ply in the city because of inadequate LPG outlets, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury told Metro on Tuesday. We cannot make the switch to LPG mandatory until easy availability of the fuel is ensured. We need at least 30-40 outlets across Calcutta.

 He said the Union petroleum ministry will send a team soon to the city to discuss the matter with the government.

 Deputy general manager of Indian Oil Corporation (LPG) A.C. De delivered a counterpoint: We have set up 10 LPG outlets in the city but there are few takers, forcing us to go slow on our expansion plan. If the demand rises, we will surely set up more outlets.

 The sale of LPG, De said, never crosses 200 metric tonnes per month, against the companys capacity to supply around 900 metric tonnes. 

 He alleged that IOC had agreed to set up six LPG outlets at state transport depots, but the government had denied permission.

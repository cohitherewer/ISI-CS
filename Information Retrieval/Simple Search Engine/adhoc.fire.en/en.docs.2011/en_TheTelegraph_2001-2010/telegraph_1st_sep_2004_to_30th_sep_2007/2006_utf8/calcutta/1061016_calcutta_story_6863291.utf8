 Cracker ban checks blazes

Swapan Banerjee: Beautiful 

 crackers like udan tubri and hawai have been 

 banned in the city during Kali puja and Diwali. Has this 

 ban helped in checking fire accidents?

 Of course. It has made a huge impact. You can go through our records and compare the number of accidents before the ban and after. As I have told you before, precautions are very important. Not all fire crackers are dangerous but a few, like udan tubri and hawai, can hurt you badly. To prevent people from using these crackers and also to control the pollution level, police officers raid shops and factories across the city and on its fringes.

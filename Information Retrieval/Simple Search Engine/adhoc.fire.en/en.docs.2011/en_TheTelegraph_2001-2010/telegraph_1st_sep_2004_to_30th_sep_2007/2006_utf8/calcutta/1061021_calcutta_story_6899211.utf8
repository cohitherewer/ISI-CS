The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Two women, one creative call

Stage On amp; Off

Taking a break from disillusionment to return to theatre, 

or taking a break from the screen to try theatre of a new kind... Heres catching 

up with Kitu Gidwani and Tannishtha Chatterjee

 Same act: Tannishtha Chatterjee and (top) 

Kitu Gidwani 

She seldom does things that she doesnt believe in. 

So, when Kitu Gidwani felt theatre wasnt rewarding enough, she stayed away from 

it for three long years.

But the self-proclaimed non-conformist resurfaced 

on stage with the comedy Your Place or Mine early this year. The play by 

Darshan Jariwala focuses on marital infidelity.

I did a lot of theatre from the late 1980s till 2000. 

Then I got a little fed up because there is no money in it. I was in London for 

four months for a play in 2003 and didnt do anything till this year, says the 

diminutive actress made famous by Doordarshan serials Air Hostess, Swabhimaan 

and Junoon. 

Currently, a couple of projects have got her excited. 

Raman Ramanathan is writing a play on three of Ibsens heroines. The women come 

into a psychiatrists clinic and talk about their problems. Theres Nora, Hedda 

Gabler and the other I cant remember. I have been reading and studying Ibsen 

and I like his works very much, smiles Kitu, sitting at the Akar Prakar gallery 

in Hindusthan Park last week. 

So, will she play Nora? No, not Nora, something different. 

But lets see which character I fit into, she adds.

The other act is by Anju Makhija, poet and playwright. 

Set in Mumbai, the piece will revolve around the relationship between domestic 

helps and their masters. Work is in progress, but first we will hold some play-reading 

sessions to see how it works out, says Kitu. We are also trying to do a piece 

on Shah Abdul Latif, the poet from Sindh But it is difficult for me to focus 

because I am not with any particular group. Working with different groups, different 

people all the time

The poor quality of current productions is the other 

reason why the stage doesnt hold as much attraction for Kitu as before. Good 

theatre is not happening in Mumbai anymore. It wasnt like this when I was doing 

theatre with Naseer (Naseeruddin Shah). Now Bollywood is such a big influence 

I think a lot of people from my generation have become very good writers, like 

Rahul de Cunha, she muses, letting out a ring of smoke from her cigarette.

Any favourite co-actor? I loved doing theatre with 

Naseer, she smiles.

Song and dance

Having wrapped up the filming of Monica Alis bestseller 

Brick Lane in London and Calcutta, protagonist Tannishtha Chatterjee is 

setting off for Kerala on a different mission.

The dusky actress will stay put at veteran dancer 

Daksha Seths dance company located in Trivandrum to revive an old performance 

piece along with Daksha, daughter Isha Sharvani (now a Bollywood name) and British 

stage director Tim Supple (who had steered the pan-Indian A Midsummer Nights 

Dream).

Postcards from God is a song-dance-performance 

piece the three women had worked on and staged in Kerala and Mumbai a year ago. 

Supple is keen on directing the piece and taking it places. Tim had seen a DVD 

of the performance and liked it so much that he now wants to direct it. Originally, 

we didnt have any director for the performance and it shaped up with all of us 

contributing, says Tannishtha.

The NSD-trained actress made an entry into the core 

team when music composer Devissaro, (Dakshas husband), met her in Mumbai. He 

was looking for someone who could act, sing and dance, says she.

Postcards from God has a loose girl-meets-boy 

narrative, based on Imtiaz Dharkers Postcards poems. There are just characters 

who swap roles. It revolves around the Bombay riots and shows life in a slum. 

I play a woman who might be a sex worker I sing a gibberish tune I learnt in 

my childhood in a final dream sequence when Isha dances with her lover. I also 

do a dance item number in it, reveals the star of Shadows of Time, Florian 

Gallenbergers Bengali film.

Dance performers there are used to approaching the 

forms first and then trying to mould expressions in them, whereas I, being an 

actor, explore the emotions and then think about the forms that would suit them. 

So, I asked Dakshas dancers to follow my method and they found it very exciting, 

says Tannishtha, looking forward to her four-month stay in Kerala.

What: Finale of Unish Kuri Streax Glam Hunt 

06. 

Where: Hotel Hindusthan International. 

When: Saturday evening, 6.30 pm onwards. 

The judges: Ace lensman Subi Samuel, model 

Indranil Dasgupta, editor of Sananda Madhumita Chattopadhyay, actress Debasree 

Roy and soccer star Bhaichung Bhutia. 

The contestants: Ten young aspiring models 

 Arpita Mukherjee, Rahul Arora, Sumeeta Swain, Arka Paul, Sweety Singh, Shabbir 

Khan, Lovely Kaur, Yash Dasgupta, Priya Ghoshal and Niraj Biyala vied for the 

Glam King and Glam Queen titles after an intensive grooming session by SMPAi that 

began on August 1. 

The hunt: The 10 contestants appeared for the 

first time on the ramp draped in white satin and georgette moving to a piece choreographed 

by Debraj Ghoshal. The music, composed by band Ishaan, was catchy. Then came the 

western formal round that doubled as an introductory session as they sashayed 

down in black power suits from Shoppers Stop.

The next sequence saw them in casual sportswear. Lots 

of cargos, tennis skirts, tees and vests, complemented with caps, headbands and 

wrist-bands were seen on the ramp as was sporting action with rackets and balls 

as accessories. 

The third and final fashion sequence saw designers 

Dev and Nil dress them up in ethnic ensembles with Eina Ahluwalias jewellery. 

The colour palette revolved round the autumnal hues of gold, rust and green. The 

men flaunted sarongs, dhotis and churidars while the gals wore fitted, panelled 

or flared lehngas. Intricate embellishments, simple silhouettes, rich Bengal 

fabrics defined the festive collection further.

The sub-contests: Yash Dasgupta and Sumeeta 

Swain won the titles of Glam Bod, Yash Dasgupta and Lovely Kaur took away Glam 

Walk, while Glam Face (most photogenic) was won by Yash Dasgupta and Sweety Singh. 

Dev and Nil also judged a special sub-contest to choose models for their collection, 

and Rahul Arora and Sweety Singh were selected the promising faces.

The winners: The Unish Kuri Streax Glam Hunt 

06 was a clean sweep by Yash Dasgupta who took away the Glam King title 

(the many times he bent over to kiss the ramp did not go in vain). Lovely Kaur 

won the Glam Queen crown. Reactions, photo opportunities and excitement filled 

the air (though one contestant couldnt stop crying and her parents were 

crestfallen, too). 

E-quotient: Was contributed by singer Zubeen 

Garg of Ya ali fame who kept the crowd rocking. I dont have 

a band here, so I will be singing on minus 1 tracks, announced the singer 

decked in a glittery turquoise shirt and black trousers. 

He kick-started the evening with Ya ali and 

then went on to Piya milan ko aana and Jiya dhadak dhadak. He then 

took a break to be back before the announcement of the winners. 

This time the singer from the north-east impressed 

the audience with a Bengali number before going on to Rama re from Kaante 

and wrapping up his performance with Tu hi meri shab from Gangster. 

Also spotted: Director Anindita Sarbadhicari, 

actress Rimjhim Mitra, actor Parambrata Chatterjee and DJ Akash.

Footnote: We would like to know, though, why 

the men were armed with swords in the ethnic wear round. The women carried nothing. 

Does manhood need props? 

And why were the men thrusting their swords at the 

audience and glaring at them with such violence before turning around? Men, especially 

new-age ones, can be glamorous without being cave men.

 Mail in mother tongue

 ?Priyo bondhu, kemon achho? 

 Onek din mail pai ni?.

 If you would rather have your 

 friend read these lines in Bengali when you email him next 

 time, log in to Rediff.com. The enhanced and more intuitive 

 Bengali interface is part of the re-launch of the portal?s 

 email service Rediffmail.

 ?A lot of people have children 

 studying abroad and would like to interact with them in 

 their mother tongue. In addition to Bengali, Rediffmail 

 offers 10 other Indian language options,? says Ajay Menon, 

 associate director (product marketing) of Rediff.com.

 There is also a growing demand 

 for regional language from the ?tier-two? cities, adds Menon.

 According to Rediff, neither does 

 one need to master special keypad layouts nor click on an 

 on-screen keyboard to enter each letter while typing emails 

 in the regional languages. ?The spelling rules are easy 

 to follow and pointers are provided while the user is typing.?

 The key factor in the revamped 

 email service continues to be speed. ?We have thrived on 

 developing fast community-use services and ?lightning-fast? 

 has been our campaign right from the start. But the definition 

 of fast has changed from how fast one can access the page 

 to how fast he can get everything done,? Menon points out. 

 The new Rediffmail offers a host 

 of new features, including an email preview pane ? like 

 Outlook Express ? where details of the attachments can also 

 be viewed, auto-address completion, email drag-and-drop, 

 enhanced search features and customised mail filtering options.

 The process of attaching files 

 up to 10 MB to emails will also be quicker in the upgraded 

 service. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML technology have 

 been used to provide the speed boost.

 ?The idea is to offer new features 

 to evolved users, but not confuse the basic users in the 

 process,? says Menon.

 The new email service was opened 

 to the public earlier this month and will continue to remain 

 in testing phase (or ?beta?) for at least six more months.

 Rediff has a registered user base 

 of 45 million and the NASDAQ-listed company saw its overall 

 revenues climb to $5.78 million in the quarter ending June 

 2006 ? a 37 per cent growth over the corresponding quarter 

 last fiscal year.

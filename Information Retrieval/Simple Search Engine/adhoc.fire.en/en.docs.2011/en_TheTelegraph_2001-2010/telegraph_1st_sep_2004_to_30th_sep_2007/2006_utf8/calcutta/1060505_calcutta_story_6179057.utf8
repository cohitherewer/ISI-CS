 Colours of pride: The Tricolour flutters 

atop Writers? Buildings during the flag-hoisting on Independence Day 

Apropos the report ?Cop clamour to cool horses?, April 

11, it was heartening to know that the mandarins are planning to take better care 

of the beautiful horses that guard the Maidan area. 

 The report only dealt with the discomfort of the horses in the stable during summer. But what about the hardships they undergo when they are outdoors for several hours on duty in the scorching heat? 

 I don?t think there are drinking water arrangements for horses in the Maidan area. Recently, while walking past Press Club, near the Mayo Road crossing, I saw a mounted policeman drinking nimbupani from a roadside vendor. It was terribly hot at that time and the horse, too, must have been as thirsty as the cop. It was looking at the water-vending machine with longing. I was pained and shocked when the policeman just kicked the horse and walked away. 

 I request the authorities to instal drinking water casks for the horses at three-four spots on the Maidan. The water should be kept under cover and the casks should be cleaned regularly.

The report ?Who will fly flag for Rs 50?, April 10, left me agape. I was not aware of the existence of the ?flag duty? post and the paltry remuneration that is paid to its holder. The salary was raised by Rs 20 in 2004. The insignificant hike for a specialised job is not only unjust, but also inconceivable. 

 The person in charge of flag duty must have strong nerve, good balance and acrobatic skills. He is undeserving of such trifling pay. Unless the pay is increased significantly, Writers? Buildings will be seen sans a fluttering Tricolour. Then at least some NGO or an individual will volunteer to do the work for free. 

Arindam Basu,

Birati. 

It is an ignominy for the national flag that the person 

entrusted to fly it is being paid Rs 50 a month. The amount is ridiculous and 

shows Writers? Buildings in poor light. 

Joyeeta Dey, 

Teghoria.

Kudos for highlighting the physical fitness required 

to hoist the national flag above Writers? Buildings. At a time when even a roti 

costs Rs 2, it is absurd to pay someone Rs 50 per month for a job that requires 

nightstay. How is he supposed to support his family? The person should also be 

compensated for the risk he undertakes by clambering up a 27-ft ladder with no 

railings. 

Bhupen Bose, 

Dum Dum.

Apropos the report ?Duo held for sleaze cry killing?, April 14, the number of sleaze rackets is steadily going up in the cities. Youngsters who patronise such rackets are lured by the electronic media. The state government should look into the matter.

The business community at Burrabazar has done a splendid job of thwarting robbery attempts by armed goons and arm-twisting tactics of police (Resist cops and robbers, April 10). The two groups have united the businessmen and fostered fellow-feeling. The incidents also highlight the nexus between police and goons. There is a message in it for all of us. It is time to develop community culture with the evils of urbanisation spreading its tentacles. 

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Borehat, Burdwan. 

Apropos the report ?Lakes still languishes?, April 12, I, along with Russi Mody, the then chief managing director of Tata Steel, film-maker Satyajit Ray and other leading citizens had prepared a master plan for the upkeep of the Lakes. We met the then chief minister Jyoti Basu and his chief secretaries several times in this regard, but the project failed to take off. 

Atmaram Saraogi,

Sarat Bose Road.

Apropos the report ?Trucks roll past terminals?, April 14, strangely and unfortunately, rather than tackling the menace of pollution due to auto-emission, the state government is bent on appearing busy on other things. Otherwise, after the high court revoked the ban on pre-1990 commercial vehicles, the government should have promptly stopped the goods carriers from entering the city. 

Sunil Banerjee,

VIP Road. 

Apropos the report ?All wall for MLA Mithun,? April 14, it is unfortunate that the election commission has denied those who paint walls their livelihood. This, however, has proved to be a boon for the film. 

Ratan Kumar Halder, 

Behala.

 Acute depression might have led the mother-daughter duo, Lina and Dolly Roy, to attempt suicide by locking themselves in in their Belgachhia flat without food for over 10 days, police said on Wednesday.

 Lina, 76, succeeded in her attempt ? her semi-decomposed body was found in the flat late on Monday ? but 45-year-old Dolly was saved in the nick of time.

 ?Lina was mentally challenged and Dolly, too, developed psychiatric problems. It seems acute depression, resulting from prolonged illness, had led them to take the extreme step,? said deputy commissioner of police (eastern-suburban division) P.S. Ghosh. 

 ?Dolly?s condition is now stable. According to the doctor attending to her at RG Kar Medical College, she is mentally unstable. With the help of local CPM leaders, we are trying to shift her to Pavlov Mental Hospital,? he added.

 The Roys? relatives, who came to the hospital on Wednesday afternoon, were too shocked to react. They performed the last rites of Lina.

 ?Dolly?s cousin, who lives in Salt Lake, came with his family after finding out about the tragedy through newspapers. They said neither Lina nor Dolly interacted with them,? said B.K. Maity, officer-in-charge of Ultadanga thana.

 Lina, sister-in-law of former CPM legislator Rathin Ray, had moved into the flat at the Belgachhia Villa Government Housing Estate in 1975 with her husband and Dolly. 

 Dolly, a spinster, resigned her job as Calcutta University librarian in 2002, after the left side of her body was paralysed.

 Lina?s husband died in 1996 and since then, she had been receiving pension every month. ?It?s not that the two had no income and Lina died of starvation. Over the past few years, they had been living a secluded life,? said Maity.

 Officers said a similar tragedy occurred at a nearby housing estate around 14 years ago. Two sisters, both unmarried, used to live in a flat near Belgachhia Milk Colony. ?After the death of the elder sister, the younger one confined herself for over a week, clinging to the body. Police were alerted only when a foul smell emanated from the flat,? said an officer.

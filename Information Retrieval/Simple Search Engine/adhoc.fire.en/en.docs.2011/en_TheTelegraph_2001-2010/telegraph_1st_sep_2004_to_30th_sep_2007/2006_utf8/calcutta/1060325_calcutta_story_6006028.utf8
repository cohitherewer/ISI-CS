 Three discos showcaused for staying open too long

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Three discotheques have been slapped with showcause notices by the police for remaining open beyond the stipulated time. 

 The authorities will have to reply within a week.

 The violation came to light last Saturday, when a police team conducted a surprise check on discos.

 ?This is not the first time discos have been caught violating rules,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 ?We are going through the records to ascertain whether the three discos had violated rules in the past, too. Action will be taken against them if they are found to be habitual offenders,? he added.

 Sharma has ordered police stations of the areas where discos are located to set up a vigil during weekends. 

 ?Apart from monitoring the closing time of the night hangout zones, the move will help keep the law-and-order situation in the vicinity under control,? he added.

 Last year, a series of raids were conducted in and around the Park Street area under the direct supervision of then deputy commissioner of the detective department Peeyush Pandey. 

 Several discos were issued showcause notices for violating the time regulation.

 ?We found couples on the dance floor of a popular disco even at 4.30 am. The authorities were ordered to close down the place for the night and the manager was asked to report to the Lalbazar headquarters,? said an officer of the detective department.

 Elaborating on the time bar, deputy commissioner Sharma said: ?Discos in five-star hotels can remain open till 4 am, but the rest have to close down at 2 am.?

 However, discos in the non-five star hotels, he pointed out, rarely abide by the regulation. ?We won?t be lax any more in dealing with them.? 

 In another move, police are planning measures to prevent entry of minors in bars and discos. 

 ?The excise department will have to play the lead role, because a policeman cannot enter a bar or disco to check whether a minor is being served liquor. We will provide all assistance to excise inspectors,? Sharma said.

 The licence of a bar or a disco will be cancelled immediately if any minor is found consuming liquor there, asserted excise secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar. 

 ?Serving liquor or tobacco to minors is illegal. Action will be taken against the offender if a specific complaint is received. Besides, we may conduct surprise raids in bars and discos to verify whether they are entertaining any minor,? he added. 

 S.S. Kothari, president of the Hotels and Restaurants of Eastern India, admitted that ?illegal and unethical activities? are reported from some bars and hotels.

 ?We have informed both police and the excise department about it and asked them to act against the offenders. The industry?s image is being tarnished because of a handful of businessmen,? he added.

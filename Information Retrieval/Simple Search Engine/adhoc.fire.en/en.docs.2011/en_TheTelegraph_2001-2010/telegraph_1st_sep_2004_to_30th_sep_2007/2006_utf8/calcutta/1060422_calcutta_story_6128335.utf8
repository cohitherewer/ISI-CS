 Wooden, but he dances like a doll

 It can stand at a height of four feet. It can twist every joint of its arms and legs. And it can do the Bharatanatyam when in the right company. Meet Saradindu, a wooden rod puppet with bushy locks like Nataraja?s. 

 Its maker, Pierre Renaud, has dedicated himself to the task of making Saradindu dance. The final goal of the project is to bring on stage an eight-foot, four-armed Shiva figure which will be animated by four dancers in the Bharatanatyam tradition. For now, it is the four-foot puppet that faces the Calcutta audience on Saturday afternoon at Max Mueller Bhavan.

 ?Puppetry is the art of the future,? Renaud, a bearded busy man, said while watching a group of local dancers get his Saradindu perform mudras to rhythmic bols. Puppets, he explains, are wonderful for multi-art, where slide shows, music, visual arts and performance can combine. ?The barriers in art are all in the head.?

 The 52-year-old resident of Montreal had started off as a graphic artist. For inspiration, he thought of making a fakir with a turban and a beard. ?But the piece of wood paste escaped my control and became a Zen guru instead. It had nothing to do with my work but became very popular.?

 That was a cue for Renaud, who till then had been involved in vulgarisation for publishers but hated working with computers. ?I love to smell paint and get my hands dirty. And I wanted to reach out to children.?

 So, he embraced puppetry full-time. ?An actor had to make a statement; a puppet is a statement,? says the founder-member of The Contemporary Puppet Quartet, quoting Richard Bass, the American master of puppetry, whose workshop he had attended. 

 So respectful is Renaud of Saradindu that he makes it sit on a chair when it is not dancing. ?It has a soul. It breathes.?

 The assumption has led him to pen a script for a play where all puppets, big and small, of Montreal unite to overthrow mankind and take a human being to court for trial. But as soon as they notice his eyes, they start performing, each fighting to catch the lone viewer?s attention. 

 ?The principle would be like that of Who Framed Roger Rabbit,? the classic that combined live action and animation on screen.

 In Calcutta with funding from Kala Bharati, Renaud finds the two cities much similar. ?Like Montreal, it is a city of artists with the joie de vivre of a mixed population. There are no ghettoes. The people are such that you feel like surfing a wonderful wave.? 

 He is full of admiration for an audience willing to sit for hours to appreciate art. ?People in the West lack patience.? Don?t mention the honking on the roads here to him, though.

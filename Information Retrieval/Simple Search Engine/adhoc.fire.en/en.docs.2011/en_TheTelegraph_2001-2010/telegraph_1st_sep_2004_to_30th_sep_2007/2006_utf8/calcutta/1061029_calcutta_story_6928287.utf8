With 

 winter approaching, its time to take your precious pug 

 or spaniel to the dog shows around town. But you need to 

 groom your pet for the purpose. Heres a what-to-do guide. 

 According to the KCI (Kennel Club 

 of India) rules, dogs that meet the following characteristics 

 can participate in shows: 

 1) They must be registered by 

 KCI Chennai.

 2) Dogs must be physically fit 

 to take part in a show.

 3) Male dogs with both descendent 

 testes will only be allowed. 

 To keep your dog in the pink of 

 health, you have to rid him of parasites that may have infected 

 internally or externally. De-worm your dog to improve coat 

 and skin.

 The best medicines for internal 

 worms are Drontal Plus, Pyrate Forte, Plozin and Ivermectin. 

 For external worms you can administer Butox, Ridd, Tick 

 powder and Tick shampoo.

 Then come food and exercise. If 

 your dog is participating in the working category, a lot 

 of exercise is necessary to develop his muscles and stamina. 

 Alongside exercises, give him food that is high on protein 

 and fat and low on carbohydrate. During this time you can 

 also give him high-energy planned commercial food like Pedigree 

 Active, Royal Canine and Hills Prescription Diet. 

 For toning up the body, you can 

 administer Vitacept and Tonophosphen injection twice a week. 

 Nutricoat, Vitabest or multivitamin tablets can be given 

 orally. Dont exercise your dog too much, as it might be 

 harmful for him.

 If your dog participates in the 

 toy, gundog or any other category, you should not give him 

 too much exercise.

 Give food containing more fat 

 to improve his coat condition. You can make a meal of paneer, 

 saltless cheese, oatmeal and full cream milk, or Pedigree 

 Puppy, Nutricoat, codliver oil or Vitacharm daily. These 

 will help the growth of hair and check hair fall.

 Be careful about dandruff which 

 may trigger hair fall and prompt the dog to scratch too 

 much. You can use Topzole, Myconil and Seledraff shampoo. 

 If you have got smooth-hair dogs 

 like a black Dobermann, dachshund or Labrador, you can use 

 a conditioner after shampoo.

 Rub the coat of your dog with 

 a mixture of olive oil and water for two days before the 

 show. For a shine, you can rub him with beer and leather 

 gloves daily. Brushing and combing will increase blood circulation 

 in the skin and nourish the hair follicles.

 Finally there is training, which 

 is very important to fetch marks. Judges will see how your 

 dog moves, stands and responds. Dont take your dog to a 

 show if he is moody, not until you can change his temperament. 

 Judges will touch your dogs head and mouth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bold amp; direct, honest amp; open

 Thats how AMITABH BACHCHAN defines the depiction of marriage in KANK. He also tells Pratim D. Gupta why he is a professional actor, not an asylum inmate

 Amitabh Bachchan in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna

 A couple of decades back you had done films like Silsila 

 and Kabhi Kabhie which dealt with the theme of 

 marital infidelity. Now that you are part of Kabhi Alvida 

 Naa Kehna, how do you think the treatment of the subject 

 has changed over the years?

 Marital infidelity is too harsh a term to describe the story line of Silsila. Kabhi Kabhie was not that at all. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, on the other hand, is marital discord and more. It is, perhaps, in keeping with the times, bolder and direct, honest and open. The previous ones were more subtle and guarded. The treatment, therefore, is also guided by todays thinking.

 Is that because Karan Johar has brought a young perspective 

 to the theme?

 Yes, Yash Chopra was a lot older than Karan when he made those films and perhaps governed by greater maturity. But the beauty of Kabhi Alvida and it is beautiful is the maturing of this incredibly talented director, at such a young age. And that really is the change. Todays generation is hugely progressive and arrogant in a constructive way and want to prove themselves to be the best anywhere in the world. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna is just that. A progressive subject, put together by an intelligence rarely expected from someone so young.

 After playing a lot of serious characters in Black and 

 Sarkar, you are doing a fun role in Kabhi Alvida... 

 Was it a welcome relief?

 I do not accept roles for mental relief. We are professional actors, not inmates of an asylum. Though many may imagine that we are. Diversity and challenge and the opportunity to be part of an enterprise that promises maximisation of ones creativity are what excite us. And that is what we welcome.

 In Sarkar, your on-screen relationship with Abhishek 

 was subtle and restrained. Here in Kabhi Alvida 

 it seems more loud and friendly. Is that a lot like you 

 two are in real life?

 May be. May be not. That aspect of our personal traits should and will remain personal. It should be of no interest really for a prospective client, whether a portrayal harbours personal ingredients.

 Do you think when you have such a huge assembly of stars 

 like there is in Kabhi Alvida the film and the subject 

 take a back seat?

 Do you really think that Karan Johar is that dumb ? That he would deliberately take such a huge assembly of stars to put his story in the back seat? And do you really think that this huge assembly of stars is equally dumb to get drawn in by such an absurd thought?

 Everyones talking about the Rock n roll soniye 

 number you have done with Abhishek and Kajol. Do you think 

 it will be the next Kajra re?

 Comparisons are odious. And such comparisons would tend to reek of garlic from every pore. Each creation has its own life and value, place and importance. Thats how it should be, surely, in order to avoid the stink. 

 How do you react to reports about a tiff between you and 

 Shah Rukh Khan?

 No answer.

 How does it feel to be awarded an international honourary 

 doctorate?

 It feels good and humbling.

 You are set to play Gabbar Singh in Ram Gopal Varma Ki 

 Sholay next month. Does the idea make you nostalgic?

 No, it does not. It scares the hell out of me. For its a challenge.

 Despite starting off with English theatre here in Calcutta, 

 you have consciously stayed away from English-language and 

 international cinema. Why?

 I consciously took it upon myself to work in Hindi cinema as a professional artiste. The English language theatre and the international projects would necessarily have to take second place. And Im not yet done with the first.

 Sir Michael Caine has said that he is most excited to work 

 with you in Jag Mundhras film on the 7/7 London blasts

 I really am quite uncertain on the authenticity of this remark. How would an eminent personality like Sir Michael Caine possibly know about me? We exist in different worlds.

 Your film with Rituparno Ghosh has been long overdue. Will 

 that happen?

 Hopefully, yes...

 You are on the wish list of every director in town. Which 

 of the new films have you agreed to do?

 There is no such wish list and the assumption is exaggerated. There are a few films on the floor and fewer in the pipeline.

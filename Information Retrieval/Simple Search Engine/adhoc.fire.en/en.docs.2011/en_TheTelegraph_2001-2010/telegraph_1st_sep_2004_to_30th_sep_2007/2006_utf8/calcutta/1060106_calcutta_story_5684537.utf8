 What: A performance by Lucky, a Ukrainian ballerina group.

 Where: Big Ben at The Kenilworth.

 When: Every night till January 8, 9.30 pm onwards.

 The show: An evening full of colour and music with Lucky, the young group of ballerinas. The trio is keeping the party people enthralled with brilliantly choreographed steps to match different styles of music from catchy numbers to soulful ballads.

 Voiceover: Getting this ballet troupe here at Big Ben is actually part of our extended New Year celebrations to keep the festive mood going. While we have these special troupes down here mostly for the weekends, this time we have got them throughout the week because people are still very much in the party mood, says a spokesperson for Big Ben. 

 The turnout for each of these nights is huge. In fact, people are enjoying themselves so much that we are seeing some regular faces coming back everyday. The atmosphere is just perfect for people to chill out after a days work, he adds.

 Sing along

 What: Karaoke evenings with Francis Lepcha.

 Where: At Mama Mia Gelato, 59, Ballygunge Circular Road.

 When: Every Friday till Valentines Day, from 8 pm to 10 pm.

 The show: Starting off just before Christmas, Francis Lepcha takes over the gelato parlour every Friday evening to belt out old English classics. Soft lounge music sets the mood for some romance with the sweet temptations offered by the store.

 Sip bite: An entire new range of gelatos launched for the festive season comprises Foresta Nera, Zesty Mint, Naughty But Nice, Nuts About You and other gelato cakes like the Dark Twilight Cake.

 Voiceover: The idea behind the concept is to offer a relaxed ambience for people to sit through the evening and enjoy their ice-creams with some soft music. To be able to sing along adds to the fun, says Natasha Agarwal, the 22-year-old proprietor of Mama Mia. 

 The aim is to keep the footfall high even through the winter months, when ice-cream sales figures tend to dip with the Celsius.

 All over the world people have ice-creams throughout the year. But in India, people have this mental block against having ice-creams in winter. Hence, this is a venture to tempt them with something more than just the gelatos, explains Natasha.

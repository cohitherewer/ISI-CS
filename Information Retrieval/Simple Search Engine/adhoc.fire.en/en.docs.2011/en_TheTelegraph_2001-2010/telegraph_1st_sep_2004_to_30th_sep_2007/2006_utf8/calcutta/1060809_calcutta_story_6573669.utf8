 Bangalore model, for better not worse

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 To be Bangalore and yet not be Bangalore, that is the challenge facing the information technology (IT) capital of Bengal.

 To pick the best of the garden city while avoiding its pitfalls, a fledgling body for and by the IT industry is putting in place an action plan for Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), annually growing at over 70 per cent for the past few years.

 No one expected Sector V to grow like this and approach a stage of saturation. Now that the workforce is expected to double in the next two years, we have to plan in advance to avoid a Bangalore-like situation, said D.K. Chaudhuri, chairman of the just-formed Salt Lake-Rajarhat Committee.

 Bangalores fall from IT grace has been articulated by the likes of Azim Premji and N.R. Narayana Murthy. 

 Keeping the Bangalore experience in mind, the committee wants to make the tech town a better workplace and also facilitate its growth.

 The major problems in Sector V have already been identified (see box). Now comes the next step: addressing them, using a continuous consultative approach.

 The first meeting of the Salt Lake-Rajarhat Committee, floated by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is slated for August 12. The list of members includes Rahul Saraf of Technopolis, Saurav Sarkar of Aesthetic Technologies and S. Radhakrishnan, vice-president, Bengal Chamber.

 Coming less than a month after a downpour had drowned the tech town, the state of infrastructure in Salt Lake will be priority number one at the debut meeting. The infrastructure in the township has to keep pace with the growth. We, along with CMDA and the state urban development department, are working to augment and also create necessary infrastructure, said S.A. Ahmed, chairman, Nabadiganta Industrial Town Authority.

 The civic body, responsible for the upkeep of Sector V and Rajarhat, will prepare a master plan for infrastructure development with inputs from industry representatives.

 With some top cops expected to join the Saturday meeting, security aspects both internal and external in Sector V-Rajarhat will also be put under the scanner. Salt Lake is secure in comparison with Bangalore and Cyberabad. But we must plan for the future, said Chaudhuri, also CEO of SkyTech Solutions.

 The Salt Lake-Rajarhat Committee will brainstorm with academicians to ensure a steady stream of quality professionals entering the industry. Besides giving Brand Bengal a boost, the committee will be striving to turn the spotlight on small and medium IT companies.

 Bangalore grew not only because of IBM and Infosys. In a competitive and favourable climate, a lot of small companies scaled up to the next level. We want the same thing here, said S. Radhakrishnan, vice-president, Bengal Chamber.

 The committee sees for itself an idea-to-implementation role. Our intention is to contribute and be a part of the overall development, summed up Chaudhuri.

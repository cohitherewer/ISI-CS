 Art and the self

 One of the most critical questions by which modern civilisation is constrained is that of identity. As the world moves ahead at a rapid pace, drawing us closer and blurring erstwhile physical, social and cultural boundaries, existential issues like unity, individuality and belongingness become all the more crucial. Critical Imperatives The Ethics of Identity, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by 13 celebrated Indian painters, seeks to put in perspective our understanding of the status of the self in the current historical setting. Besides providing an insight into the condition of contemporary art in the country, it offers an interesting redefinition of realism, which is no longer restricted to an absolute representation of fact. Overflowing the edges of conventional rational thought, the works on show confront us with doubts, fragilities and uncertainties of modern life. Participating artists include Jogen Chowdhury, Sunil Das (a painting by him appears above), Robin Mondol, Jaya Ganguly, Paritosh Sen, Amitava Das and Prabhakar Kolte.

 Gibberish that makes sense

 Thanks to a Bengali film, Rajat Kapoor has been a frequent flier to Calcutta for the past few months. This week, he is here with a stage production after one full decade. That was when he had directed Edward Albee?s Who?s Afraid of Virginia Woolf with Sanjna Kapoor in the lead.

 C for Clown, which Kapoor has written and steered, will take the stage at GD Birla Sabhagar for two back-to-back shows (3.30 pm and 6.30 pm) on Saturday as part of Odeon 2006, the theatre gala hosted by Hutch.

 ?C for Clown has been running for seven years and I have been looking for sponsors to bring it to Calcutta all this while. We have had 100 shows so far,? he says, minutes before the theatre seminar at ITC Sonar Bangla on Friday. The play has travelled to Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi and Dubai. As the sets of the production were washed away during the floods in Mumbai, Kapoor?s team had to rebuild the structure. 

 Comprising five actors, C for Clown has less to do with the lives of clowns and more to do with clowning. ?The script is 90 per cent gibberish and there?s very little spoken word. But it?s gibberish that makes absolute sense. The clowns could be anyone, or any artiste. We are using clowns just as a means of stylisation. And I can promise you that you have never seen anything like this before,? adds Kapoor.

 As one of the cast members of C for Clown (Joy Fernandes) is absent, Kapoor will play his role ?with some padding? in Odeon. The others in the production are Atul Kumar and Shiva. 

 Kapoor wears the hats of theatre director, actor and film-maker with ease. Making films has been his passion and goal, and theatre happened pretty much by accident, he admits. ?Between Private Detective, my first film, and Raghu Romeo, there were eight years. There was a lot of time and I did theatre. It?s something that I can do whenever I want. All I need are two good actors.?

 The cast of C for Clown is made up of mostly known faces, some of whom Kapoor has directed in his films, like Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey in Mixed Doubles. Ranvir will also play the lead in his next film Mithya.

 ?It?s about a very very bad, struggling actor, and it?s not autobiographical,? Kapoor is quick to clarify with a disarming smile. The actor gets involved with a gang led by Naseeruddin Shah.

 Ready to hit the floors in July, Mithya will have Neha Dhupia as Ranvir?s moll, apart from Saurabh Shukla, Rahul Dev, Vinay Pathak and Iravati Karve. The film will be shot in the Mumbai monsoons.

 A new stage production in Kapoor?s repertoire is unlikely before the end of next year as his schedule is chock-a-block with directorial and acting assignments. First up is Madhur Bhandarkar?s Corporate, where he plays one of the central roles and not just a ?walk-on part?.

 Next in queue is Bheja Fry, starring Milind Soman, Vinay Pathak, Sarika and Kapoor himself. The film will be directed by Sagar, who assisted him in Raghu Romeo and Mixed Doubles. 

 As far as his own projects go, Mithya will be followed by a sequel to Mixed Doubles. ?Another amoral tale,? sums up Kapoor.

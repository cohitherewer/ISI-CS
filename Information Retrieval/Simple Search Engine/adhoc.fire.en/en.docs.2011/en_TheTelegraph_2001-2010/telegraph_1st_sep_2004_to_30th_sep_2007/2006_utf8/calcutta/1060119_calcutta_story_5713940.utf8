 Big draw for big day

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 Book a corner in a popular eatery or amusement park, outsource food and fun, and have a b-day to remember.

 Birthday bashes for toddlers and teens are no longer the conventional family get-togethers at home, as birthday boys and girls pick and choose their hot spot for a party ? from Sparkz to Pizza Hut, Souravs to Space Circle.

 We are booked for more than 70 birthday parties almost every month, says Sandeep Agarwal of Sparkz, the amusement park in Alipore.

 The trend of celebrating birthdays outdoors started picking up two years back. But it has gained momentum in the last seven-eight months with the number of outdoor birthday bashes increasing by leaps and bounds. The rise can be attributed to so many options that are coming up.

 And also the chance to avoid the hassle of playing host at home. From decoration to clean-up, everything is taken care of by these entertainment addresses, along with food and beverage, and often fun and games.

 The all-fun factor plays a major role in stepping out of home on a birthday. And Prince of Cal, the night club at Souravs: The Food Pavilion, is a preferred pitch for obvious reasons. Those celebrating the birthday do not have to worry about anything. They just have to come in with their guests and have fun. We provide all other facilities like doing up the place, arranging for a puppet show or a clown act and, of course, cleaning up after the party is over. If a similar party is held indoors with 50 to 60 people in attendance, one has to get busy days in advance and the effect continues for days after the party, says Kanishka Mazumdar, CEO, Souravs.

 The bottom line here is that the hosts can have just as much fun as the guests. When I hosted a birthday party for my 11-year-old daughter at Pizza Hut with 20 of her friends and their mothers, I too ended up having a great time, admits Sulekha Roy.

 The requirements for an outdoor birthday bash are very basic. People just want a small hall that can accommodate 50 to 80 people. Snacks are preferred over dinner with sweets, mocktails and a birthday cake. The one thing they do not want is any hassle, says a spokesperson for Space Circle in Teghoria.

 From being hassle-free to breaking the monotony, the reasons for shifting the birthday venue out of home are varied. Contrary to popular belief, the gulf between the expenses at home and at a commercial place is not very big. One also has to take into account the comfort factor at these places. And how many homes today can accommodate so many kids at one go? asks Girish Bajoria who threw a birthday party for his nine-year-old son at Sparkz last November.

 The average price range is between Rs 200 and Rs 300 per head, depending upon the variety of cake, the soft drinks on offer and the nature of finger food. Fun and games come for an extra fee.

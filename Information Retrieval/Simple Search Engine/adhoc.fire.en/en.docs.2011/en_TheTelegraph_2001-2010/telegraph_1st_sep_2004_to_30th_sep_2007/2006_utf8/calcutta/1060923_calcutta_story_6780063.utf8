The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 To shop amp; pandal-hop

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) on Friday started plying special buses at night to ferry shoppers to major malls in the city. The service will continue till Sunday and may be extended if the demand persists.

 On Puja days, there will be a special taxi service for revellers to visit pandals in and around the city. Up to five persons can ride in a taxi and the fare has been fixed at Rs 100 per hour (the booking has to be for at least four hours).

 CSTC managing director, Ashok Bhattacharya said the shoppers bus would start from the airport at 8.30 pm and reach Gariahat around 10.30 pm. It will touch Big Bazar- Bazar Kolkata (Baguiati), City Centre (Salt Lake), 89 Cinemas (EM Bypass), Hiland Park (EM Bypass) and Pantaloons (Gariahat).

 The bus will leave Gariahat at 12.30 am and reach the airport, following the same route, at 2.15 am. Normal fare will be charged from the passengers. We have decided to ply the buses at night because most major malls will remain open till midnight, said Bhattacharya.

 Bengal Taxi Association general secretary Bimal Guha said the taxis for pandal-hoppers have to be booked in person at the BTA office at 63/3/B, Sarat Bose Road or by calling 24753505/24742249.

 The entire amount has to be paid in advance. Booking starts on Monday.

 He said the cabs will pick up passengers from their residence or any other designated spot. All drivers will be given a form that the passengers will have to sign. The drivers will be paid only if the passengers express satisfaction with the service, said Guha.

 Makers of gods brave the odds 

Kumartulis artisans struggle against red tape

 Its festival time in Kumartuli, time for the artisans to earn as much as possible to survive another year.

 But, bogged down they are by the problems of getting their annual trade licences renewed and receiving their quota of oil for blow torches at a subsidised rate. The twin woes are posing a challenge to the idol-makers racing to meet the early Puja deadline.

 The trade licence is very important for us, said Babu Pal, secretary of the Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity. Without this piece of paper, we cannot approach banks for loans that we so badly need to complete work on time for the autumn festivities.

 The licences usually reach the artisans by May, but the past two years were difficult. This year, we have managed to obtain loans through a bit of smooth-talking. But if the licence problem lingers, god knows what will happen next year, sighed Babu.

 The oil for the blow torch, used for drying the clay images before a coat of paint is applied on them, is another indispensable item for the artisans. Early Pujas have made it more so, with incessant rain threatening to wash away their labour.

 But the oil, supplied by the Food Corporation of India at a discount, is proving elusive. Samity treasurer Biswanath Dey said: The last time we approached officials for approval to collect our quota, they asked us to produce the Saraswati puja accounts. Its nothing but an excuse to deny us the nod.

 The corporation provides five litres of oil per week in the days leading to the Puja to the 300-odd members of the Samity.

 Another complaint of the artisans is that their idols are not fetching the expected price, despite the demand. 

 The price of clay has gone up from Rs 250 to Rs 350 per tonne, a bundle of hay has become costlier by Rs 4 and labour charges are up by Rs 2,000. But the price of an idol has increased by only 10 to 15 per cent, said Samity president Nemai Pal.

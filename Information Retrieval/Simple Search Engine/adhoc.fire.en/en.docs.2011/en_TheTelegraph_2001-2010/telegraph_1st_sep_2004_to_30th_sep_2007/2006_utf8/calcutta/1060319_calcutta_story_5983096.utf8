The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bollywood?s 

 brand variants

 An actor doing the same thing over 

 and over again had more to do with marketing wisdom than lack 

 of versatility 

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Naseeruddin 

 Shah was once asked who he envied the most as an actor. 

 Without hesitation he had named Shammi Kapoor. Naseer said 

 he knew Shammi Kapoor personally and thus could realise 

 the distance he travelled to become the screen entity that 

 we loved. With characteristic modesty, Naseer said that 

 he did not have it in him to undertake the voyage into absurdity.

 I was reminded of this story when 

 I was watching the telecast of one of the numerous film 

 awards ceremonies. There was Ash, sitting there dainty as 

 ever. Her presence was very delicate, very soft. No piece 

 of clothing that she wore screamed for attention. Suddenly 

 it struck me that she was the same lady who had done the 

 Kajra re number. Then I saw Rekha, giggling, clapping 

 and often bathing in her own enjoyment, and yet she is the 

 same person who did Umrao Jaan. And then there was 

 a tall, dark and still handsome man sitting quietly. Convent 

 educated, son of a great poet, childhood friend of Rajiv 

 Gandhi? What it must have taken him to play the lead role 

 in Lawaris or Sharabi, Agneepath or 

 Black?

 True, all actors need to travel 

 the distance to make the drama realistic. That perhaps is 

 the key word: realistic. Most characterisations provoke 

 an actor to become someone else. The greatness of the actors 

 who earn their living from Hindi films is that most of the 

 time the character they need to become cannot be even visualised. 

 Can you imagine someone falling in love with a beautiful 

 lady in the serene settings of Kashmir and on receiving 

 reciprocation screaming, Yahoo, chahe koi mujhe 

 junglee kahe?

 It is a curious coincidence that 

 most who manage such huge transformations also tend to repeat 

 their feat. They get typecast in movie after movie. Whether 

 it is Dilip Kumar or Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor or Dev Anand, 

 Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan, with honourable exceptions 

 they all have been asked to play the same character and 

 do the same thing over and over again. They have delivered 

 consistently and we the people have lapped it up most of 

 the time. 

 By doing so as actors they have 

 often been criticised for being less than versatile. The 

 moot point is why have they done so? The simple explanation 

 is that they had little choice. They did what the directors 

 offered them. That may be a part truth but certainly not 

 a complete explanation. After all, when Raj Kapoor or Dev 

 Anand directed themselves, they could have broken the stereotype.

 The reason why they did not is 

 possibly because they were conscious that the pigeonhole 

 that each one of them created was a brand with visible characteristics. 

 More crucially they realised that their brand has won much-coveted 

 public approval. Thus they felt the need to earn their keep 

 by lending the popularity of their brand to every film they 

 were doing. In any case that was the popular demand from 

 the makers. Earning recognition for their versatility was 

 less profitable.

 No wonder we had the film industry 

 producing multiple incarnations of Raju from Raj Kapoor 

 or Vijay from Amitabh Bachchan, much like the present day 

 Harry Potter series. Indeed in modern parlance they would 

 have been hailed as launches of brand variants. Those much-maligned 

 actors would have been lauded for shouldering the onus of 

 delivering consistent brand value, a cardinal rule of marketing. 

 It is amazing that such marketing wisdom existed even before 

 the first business school in the country opened its door.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Weekend of the scorchers

 - Galaxy of stars, hot and happening, descends on city for events galore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Katrina Kaif and Lalu Prasad: Sizzle power 

 If the west wind has blown in a warm spell this week, a star shower will make the weekend a hot and happening one. And the guest list ranges from politician to pretty face, super singer to item girl.

 Steering the star train is the erstwhile badshah of Bihar, Lalu Prasad. The railway minister takes the Calcutta Club podium on Sunday for The Telegraph National Debate to hold forth on whether reservation has been beneficial to the country and industry.

 Though the list of speakers packs plenty of punch ? Sitaram Yechury to Pramod Mahajan, Barkha Dutt to Viren J. Shah, among others ? there is no doubt who the star will be. ?I?m very anxious to hear Lalu speak,? says Bhaskar Sen, immediate past president of Calcutta Club.

 From musings to melody, singer Shaan and Pakistani band Jal will rock at Rebeca 2006, Bengal Engineering and Science University?s annual fest, presented in association with The Telegraph. While Shaan ? who recently scored the number Shuruaat in the soundtrack of the Hollywood blockbuster The Chronicles of Narnia ? takes the stage on Sunday, the Woh Lamhe boys would do a follow-up act the day after. ?Shaan is the hottest Indian singer right now and we decided on him a year ago,? says Anirban Basu of the fest organising committee.

 The Bollywood brigade, too, will be making its presence seen over the action-packed weekend. Katrina Kaif and Koena Mitra will add a feminine touch to the finals of the Grasim Mr India contest at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday evening. The hunk hunt is being held in the city after five years, but the spotlight will surely be on city girl Koena and Boom babe Katrina.

 With big-screen beauties in town, can the ramp rulers be far behind? Flavour of the season Deepika Padukone and veteran Jesse Randhawa will do the catwalk at the Oberoi Grand Ballroom on Saturday for the PC Chandra Sananda Fashion Show. If the daughter of badminton great Prakash Padukone is being touted as model number one, Jesse remains a ramp rage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Laser show on watery screen

 If the Port Trust has its way, the riverfront could be the citys favourite hangout in the evening. The port authorities have drawn up an ambitious plan to set up a water-screen on the Strand for showing anything from the latest blockbuster to documentaries on Calcuttas history.

 The project follows the decorative illumination of Howrah bridge, also done by the Port Trust.

 Powerful pumps will propel water in the air to form the giant water-screen on which anything can be projected. People on both banks of the river can watch the shows.

 This is an effort to add an attraction to the riverfront, as well as to make it beautiful. But the project will be a commercial venture. The Port Trust does not have the means to implement the scheme. We will only be the facilitators, providing infrastructure support, Port Trust chairman A.K. Chanda told Metro.

 Advertisements on the water-screen could be a source of revenue, Chanda pointed out.

 The details of the project have not been finalised. Tenders will be invited from private parties, who will be responsible for the technical and commercial aspects. of the project. The project is open to both Indian and foreign companies, said the chairman.

 Laser shows and video projections on water-screens are not new in India, or even Calcutta, but the Port project is the first on a river. There is provision for projection on the musical fountain at Science City, though no show has been held for quite some time, said Ingit Mukherjee of the National Council of Science Museums. 

 Water pumped up under high pressure forms a mist that serves as the perfect base for video projections and animation shows with laser, said Saibal Bhowmick of Premier Fountains, a company that has been providing musical fountains and water-screens for laser and video shows in India and abroad.

 We have installed water-screens in Hyderabad and Gujarat. Musical fountains cost a minimum of Rs 2 crore. Several types of laser guns and other equipment can be used for the shows. Most of them are not available in India, added Bhowmick.

 He expressed willingness to undertake the Port Trust project. Shows can be held on the river only in winter. Projection is not possible if there is a strong breeze, warned Bhowmick. 

 Chanda said: Experts will deliberate on all aspects before we finalise the site for the water-screen. The tides and other natural factors need to be taken into consideration.

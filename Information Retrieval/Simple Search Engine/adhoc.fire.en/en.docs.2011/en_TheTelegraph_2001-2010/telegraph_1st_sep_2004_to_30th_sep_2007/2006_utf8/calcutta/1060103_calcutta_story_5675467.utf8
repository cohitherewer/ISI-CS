The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 She, in search of an address

 15 Park Avenue is poised to open the doors to the chaotic world of a schizophrenic girl

 Aparna Sen: new challenge 

 Where is 15 Park Avenue? In Calcutta or in New York? The mystery shrouding the address and its residents, if any, will be unravelled this Friday when the film by Aparna Sen releases across the country in English and in Hindi (dubbed version).

 Starring Konkona Sen Sharma, Shabana Azmi, Waheeda Rehman, Rahul Bose, Soumitra Chatterjee, Dhritiman Chatterji, Shefali Shah and Kanwaljeet, the Rs 3-crore film has been produced by Bipin Vohra?s SPS Films.

 A schizophrenic patient called Meethi (Konkona) is in search of 15 Park Avenue, where she believes she lives with her husband and five children. That?s her reality, always on the edge, threatened by the world outside. 

 For the director, who has been ?interested in challenged characters since Parama?, 15 Park Avenue will be a fuller exploration of ?their? world after Paromitar Ekdin. 

 ?Both I and Konkona have observed schizophrenic patients from very close quarters and among very close relatives. I feel challenged characters have only recently started to be represented in mainstream films like Black and Iqbal,? said Aparna on Monday.

 ?Meethi is a character whom I have grown up with. There?s a challenged character in most of our families who is hidden away somewhere. She?s not like Mrs Iyer where I had to fit in,? added Konkona.

 To drive home Meethi?s chaotic world, the director and her lead actress sought help from a psychiatrist who pitched in with medical details. ?I talked to a psychiatrist as I was representing a character who had both epilepsy and schizophrenia. And also because Meethi is functional in the beginning; she develops schizophrenia after an incident,? explained Konkona, who was her mother?s first choice for the role.

 ?I wanted an actor who wouldn?t go over the top and Konkona has a very fine sense of balance. She is a very good actor and I say this as a director,? smiled Aparna, who also tailored her script to fit Shabana into the scheme of things. 

 ?When I was writing the script I was in talks with Shabana because she is a very close friend. Shabana insisted on doing the film, so I and Konkona discussed and decided to make her the half-sister, who is 18 years older than Meethi. And that has worked out very well. It has added another dimension to the film ? the fact that she and Meethi are not of the same father and yet she cares so much for Meethi,? said Aparna. 

 The relationship between the sisters is complex and layered. ?Meethi is envious; she loves, hates, depends and also wants to emulate Anu (Shabana). Anu is very protective and yet very angry because her life is always on hold for Meethi.? 

 The soft and gentle Waheeda Rehman comes across as an insecure, anxious and frightened mother, while Soumitra Chatterjee plays her supportive second husband. 

 Aparna felt the subject of schizophrenia needed an educated audience, and so she chose English. ?That apart, budgets for Bengali films are very low and I felt I would have to add some formula elements if I did the film in Hindi,? she smiled. 

 Shot on location in the city and Bhutan, 15 Park Avenue releases at INOX (City Centre and Forum), 89 Cinemas, Fame and Priya.

 What: 

 New menu launch at Orkos Restaurant and Lounge Bar.

 Where: City Centre, 

 DC Block, E 306.

 When: May 9.

 Take a look: 

 New sofas, painted glass, abstract paintings and a 250 sq 

 ft dance floor at the lounge bar, and mouth-watering food 

 all in the revamped interiors, jazzy yet elegant.

 The new food menu includes an array of interesting soups, starters and main-course dishes. One could start the gastronomic journey with Jal Jeera and Lassi. The soup section includes Cream of Tomato Soup (fresh tomato puree with cream), Mulligatwany Soup (mixed lentil with herbs), Lasooni Murg Shorba (garlic-flavoured thin chicken shorba) and more.

 For starters, go for Orkos speciality Dahi-ke-Kabab, Methi Mirch Ka Paneer Tikka (cottage cheese steaks marinated in spicy fenugreek flavoured yoghurt and cooked in clay oven), Murg-Ka-Sula (boneless chicken flavoured with spices and cooked in clay oven) and Bhuna Gosht Ball (nuggets of lamb laced with spices and cooked in clay oven, lightly tossed in masala gravy), among other items.

 In the main course, choose from 

 Paneer Makhani (cubes of cottage cheese cooked in 

 a clay oven, finished with a silky puree of tomato and butter), 

 Baby Corn Methi Palak (babycorn stir-fried with spinach, 

 cumin and fennel), Fish Begum Bahar (dumplings of fish cooked 

 in rich gravy) and Hari Mirch Ka Bhuna Gosht (tender pieces 

 of lamb cooked in thick gravy with green chilli).

 Spotted: At the 

 launch on Tuesday evening were actresses Deboleena Dutta, 

 Monami Ghosh and Rimjhim Mitra and actor Arindam Sil.

 Pocket pinch: Approximate 

 meal for two would be Rs 850.

 Voiceover: This 

 is an effort to break away from the monotony of the same 

 food spread and allow our customers to taste more of Indian 

 cuisine, smiled Ratna Sen, managing director, Sens 

 Group of Orkos Restaurant and Lounge Bar.

 Book corner

 What: Launch 

 of Gallery Book Corner at Gallery Kanishkas. 

 Where: 2/1, Hindusthan 

 Road.

 When: May 9, 

 6 pm onwards. 

 Sitting in: Over 

 two years old now, Gallery Kanishkas has been home 

 to many an art exhibition. The latest offering is a book 

 corner housed on the premises of the gallery with titles 

 related to art and artists. 

 The book corner is divided into 

 three categories. One has books on various art movements 

 like modernism, surrealism and cubism. 

 Another is on the life, work and 

 analysis of great artists like Picasso, Henri Matisse, Nicolas 

 Poussin, Vincent Van Gogh and more. 

 The third category stocking books 

 on paintings, pastel, sketches, acrylic, development of 

 perceptions and ideas is an effort to help budding artists 

 and art students. There are more than 700 titles available 

 at present.

 The inaugural event on Tuesday 

 kicked off with a chat session ? Art, Adda Aar Cha featuring 

 artist Suvaprasanna, S.V. Raman, programme director, Max 

 Mueller Bhavan, photographer Sunil K. Dutt and actress Suchita 

 Roy Chowdhury discussing various aspects of art over tea, 

 beguni and samosas.

 It is true that the Internet has brought many things within our reach but the relation that is formed with a book when we personally go through its pages and imagine the words is quite unmatched, said Suvaprasanna.

 Rabindranath Tagore was discussed as a creative stalwart encompassing art in all forms. 

 Then the talk veered towards Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyays Panther Pachali and Tagores Noshto Nir inspiring great films like Panther Pachali and Charulata. Films are a blend of all art forms, observed Sunil K. Dutt.

 A question from the audience as 

 to how the uninitiated could appreciate paintings prompted 

 Suvaprasanna to observe: What is important is the 

 need to connect with the work of art, spiritually and mentally.

 Voiceover: The 

 idea is to allow art lovers to view paintings and browse 

 through art books within the peaceful confines of a gallery. 

 The place provides a leisurely ambience to browse through 

 the varied range of books before making a choice. We often 

 see a particular painting with strokes and illustrations 

 that interest us; the books shall help the art lover learn 

 more about it, said Prateek Raja from Kanishkas.

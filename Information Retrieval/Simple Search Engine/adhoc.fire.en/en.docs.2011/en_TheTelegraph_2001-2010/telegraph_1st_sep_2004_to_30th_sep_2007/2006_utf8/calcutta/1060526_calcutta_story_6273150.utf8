The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Sam amp; Saransh

Screen On amp; Off

 Making the big appearance on The Great Indian Laughter Challenge this week is the sultry Sameera Reddy. It?s the semis and the 60 stand-up comedians from across India and Pakistan are now down to 13, battling it out over the next three weeks.

 Also appearing on the show will be eight-year-old Saransh Bharadwaj from Gwalior. The ?small wonder of comedy? may be in Class IV but is a big hit with both the judges Shekhar Suman and Navjyot Singh Sidhu. Shekhar feels had he not been underage for the show, special guest Saransh would have won hands down.

 And when you have Sameera herself blowing a kiss to this child star, you know he?s hit a high.

 Catch all the action this Friday on STAR One at 10 pm as two men from Mumbai, one from Indore and one from Chandigarh fight it out while raising a laugh.

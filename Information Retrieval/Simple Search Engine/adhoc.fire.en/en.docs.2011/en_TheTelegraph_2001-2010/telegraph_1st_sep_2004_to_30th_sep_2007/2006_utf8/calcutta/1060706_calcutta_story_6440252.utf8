 Dreams rooted to a wheelchair

 - RESILIENCE AND THE CHILD

 Dreams have wings. But young Sambit Roy?s are rooted to a ground reality ? he wants to walk to school. 

 The boy from Class VI who will complete 12 next week is suffering from Ducchenne Muscular Dystrophy, which has made him unable to stand or walk on his own. On Tuesday, he received an advance birthday gift from his school ? the Priyamvada Birla Brave Hearts Award. 

 Sambit was up and walking as a child. Only, his heel would not touch the ground, and climbing stairs was painful. But calamity struck after Class III when his right leg became stiff. ?We took him to All India Institute for Medical Sciences in Delhi for treatment in April 2005. He was given a stem cell injection. But when we returned for the second shot last October, they did not encourage it,? mother Nandita recounts. 

 Now, the boy?s companions for movement are a knee ankle foot orthosis or a wheelchair. 

 Yet that has only steeled his resolve to swim with the mainstream. ?Sukukaku? (Driver Sukumar Ray) carries him from the car to his seat and back. The permanent first-bencher hates the privilege. ?I want to sit on the last bench,? he states, adding how ?one can see so much through the window?.

 Sambit?s teachers, too, are aware of his resilience. Recalls Rana Das, assistant controller of examinations, South Point School: ?During the last annual exam, their seat was on the fourth floor. To facilitate his movement, I slotted him on the ground floor. But on the first day, he cried so bitterly on having to sit with strangers that we had to send him upstairs to his classmates.? 

 He hates to stay away from school, neither will he study alone, says his mother. That means going to three more addresses regularly for tuitions from their Lake Town home. Another hour-and-a-half goes for daily physiotherapy.

 Yet, Sambit believes he is doing fine. ?Just that I have to stay in the empty class when they go for PT (physical training),? a cloud of sadness drifts through the innocent face. 

 Sambit loves his school, though he does not count any of his classmates as friend. ?The monitor brings me books in the library,? concedes the Secret Seven fan. Perhaps such an admission would only make him dependant on others. He would rather talk of his teachers and his favourite subject, history.

 As the boy is carried forward in his wheelchair, the gathering at the Science City auditorium rises to its feet. ?A salute to tenacity?, ?inspiring icon? ? words of praise flow from the lips of R.S. Lodha, the South Point Education Society president. Children of other schools walk up to him afterwards to shake his hand. 

 Sambit sits in silence, clutching on to his prize ? a cheque for Rs 5,000 and a certificate. His face betrays no emotion. Just his limp feet he keeps shifting, proudly refusing help to raise them on the seat.

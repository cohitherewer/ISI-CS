 Roll of unlisted buildings 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The civic authorities will approach the postal department, CESC and cooking gas companies to create a database of unregistered buildings in Calcutta.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay made the decision after a geographical information system (GIS) map of Ward 57, in Beleghata, revealed over 7,000 unrecorded buildings.

 The addresses or holding numbers of the buildings are arbitrary and it is difficult to find a house in the area. In contrast, buildings in Calcutta have had proper addresses since the British era, said acting deputy municipal commissioner (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee.

 More importantly, the premises numbers of the ?mother? plots have remained unchanged over 100 years in the city proper, he added.

 Since the map shows several unrecorded structures, the assessment department of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has requested the survey department to provide a revised list of buildings, excluding those being assessed.

 ?This is just the tip of the iceberg. It gives us an idea of how big the problem of unrecorded buildings is in the city and the loss to the civic coffers,? stated Bandyopadhyay. 

 According to Mukherjee, there is a high concentration of unrecorded buildings and structures on the eastern fringe of the city and 85 sq km in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, which was added to the city in 1984. 

 Some panchayats areas were also added to Ward 57 then. 

 The GIS map was prepared using data collected in an aerial survey by National Remote Sensing Authority (NRSA). The NRSA has also provided digitised base maps (on a scale of 1:500) of Beleghata, Munshibazar, Canal South Road, Pagladanga Road, Chingrihata, Tapuriaghata and Makaltala. 

 The geographical information was fed into the base map by a private agency named Riddhi Management Services. 

 Utilising a financial grant by the British government?s department for international development, the CMC is spending Rs 5 crore on preparing GIS maps of the city. The project is scheduled to be completed by December 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Girls? school under scanner 

 DEB DWAIPAYAN CHATTOPADHYAY, chief municipal health officer, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Diptimoy Ghosh, Saikat Roy, Sivabrata Chatterjee, Md. Aamiruzzaman, Srikumar Chatterjee, Sushmita Roy, Kajal Das, S.M. Sarfuddin

Md. Aamiruzzaman: There is a HS English-medium girls? school in the Lalbazar area with a student strength of 3,500. There are only eight toilets on the campus, all of them in horrible condition. Insufficient light in the classrooms is affecting the eyesight of the students. What are you doing?

 I have received a complaint about the school recently and asked the borough executive health officer to prepare a report. We will decide on the next step after getting the report.

Sivabrata Chatterjee: The stretch between Elgin Road and Puddapukur, in ward 70, is dotted with over 200 workshops, none of which has a health licence from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). They create a lot of noise pollution. Since 1974, I have been lodging complaints with the civic health department and the state pollution control board (PCB) against these workshops, but to no avail.

 There is no record of any such complaint in my office. Moreover, I would like to inform you that the licence department has been issuing the health licence since 2004. However, you can write to the civic health department about the noise pollution. After carrying out an inspection, we will notify the PCB. 

Diptimoy Ghosh: Has the health department stopped raids against adulteration of edible oils, ghee, ground spices and other items?

 We have a food cell in the civic health department. However, it is a fact that the drive against adulteration has not been pursued seriously over the past four years. We have now decided to have at least one food inspector in every borough. The inspectors will regularly collect samples for tests.

 Besides, citizens can lodge complaints with the mayor about adulterated food items. They can also approach the mayoral council member (health), the municipal commissioner or the civic health department. The complainant should be specific and provide the name and address of the shop and the item.

Sivabrata Chatterjee: The civic authority keeps us in the dark about the quality of drinking water supplied in the city. The terms ?safe drinking water? and ?treated water? do not provide an idea of the quality of drinking water.

 We have started a discussion with the water supply department in this regard. The civic health department tests water samples regularly and if impurities are found, we immediately notify the water supply department for remedial measures.

Kajal Das: The CMC has now got an environment department and there is a mayoral council member in charge of it. Can we now lodge complaints with the department against air and noise pollution?

 The health department was initially given charge of the environment department in 2002. The then mayoral council member (health) was given the responsibility of the new department. Subsequently, the mayoral council member (slum development) was made the in-charge of the environment wing. Now, mayoral council member (parks amp; gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan is looking after the department. Hence, I am not in a position to guide you in this regard.

Srikumar Chatterjee: The stray dog population in the city is growing rapidly. School children have to deal with the menace in different pockets of the city. Why aren?t you taking steps to curb the number of canines in the city? Isn?t the civic body duty-bound to do so?

 We have a dog squad and two pounds, but the infrastructure is not adequate. We have engaged six NGOs for sterilising stray dogs and vaccinating them. Out of the NGOs, three are active. 

 Under the prevention of cruelty to animals act, the CMC or an agency appointed by it cannot kill a dog. After sterilisation, a dog has to be returned to the area from where it was picked up. A dog can only be killed if it becomes rabid.

Md. Aamiruzzaman: How many more years do you need to commission the maternity home on 40, Canal East Road in Narkeldanga?

 I don?t know anything about the project since I am new here. But I can tell you that it will be commissioned by 2007. We are now preparing the design of the operating theatre and in the process of procuring instruments.

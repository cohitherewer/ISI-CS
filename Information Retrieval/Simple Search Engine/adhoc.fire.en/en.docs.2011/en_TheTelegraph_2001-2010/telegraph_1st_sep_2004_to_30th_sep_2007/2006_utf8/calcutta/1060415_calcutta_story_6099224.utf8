 To celebrate Poila Baisakh, Tollygunge Club, in association with Hero Honda, National Insurance, Polar, Jetex and Open Doors, hosts a variety entertainment programme that reaffirms our faith in the quintessence of Bengal?s customs and traditions. Presenting the best of what Bengal has to offer by way of culture, crafts and cuisine, it showcases a delightful combination of artistry and amusement. Featuring popular Bangla band Cactus (picture above), which sets the mood for an enchanting evening with its inimitable brand of catchy tunes and lyrics, the programme also includes a performance by Santhal dancers of Birbhum who will present an act of sheer grace and agility, with male drummers doing a balancing act while dancing along with the women. Baul singers, with their lilting melodies of humour or pathos, provide the perfect accompaniment to this excellent expression of Bengal?s folk culture. To be preceded by a vibrant display of a mind-boggling variety of Bengal handicrafts (at 6.30 pm) including terracotta jewellery, sola-pith carvings, cane and bamboo objects and filigree work, courtesy Crafts Council of West Bengal.

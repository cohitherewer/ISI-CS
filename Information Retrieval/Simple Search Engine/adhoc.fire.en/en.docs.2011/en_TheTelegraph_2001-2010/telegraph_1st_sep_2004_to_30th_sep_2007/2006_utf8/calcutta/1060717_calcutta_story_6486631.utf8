The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Missing, cards for complaint 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 An acute shortage of complaint cards has become an impediment in lodging complaints with the traffic control department.

 Traffic complaint cards were introduced about three years ago to help people lodge complaints with the cops on duty. The complaints are later forwarded to the traffic guard offices.

 Of late, the cards have not been available with the traffic cops on duty. A visit to a number of crossings across Calcutta revealed that traffic constables are not carrying the complaint cards as they are not supplied regularly.

 ?We are not getting the complaint cards from the traffic guard offices. The cards are of very poor quality and we can?t even write on the cards,? said a constable at a Sovabazar crossing.

 ?It is possible that the cards are not always available with the traffic constables. People can still write their complaints on a piece of paper,? Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), told Metro on Sunday.

 He claimed that there was no shortage of cards with the traffic department and they are being regularly supplied to the constables.

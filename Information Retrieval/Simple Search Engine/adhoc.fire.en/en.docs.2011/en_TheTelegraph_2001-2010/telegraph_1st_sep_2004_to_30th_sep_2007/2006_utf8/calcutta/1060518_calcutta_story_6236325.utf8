 A feel for figures was the highlight of the ICSE and ISC results declared on Thursday.

 The marks in mathematics have been ?unexpectedly good? in both the examinations conducted by the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations .

 ?Students have performed extremely well in mathematics this time. The trend is encouraging and we are happy to find young boys and girls doing well in mathematics,? said J.K. Sen, general secretary, Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools, and principal of Julien Day School (Ganganagar).

 A large number of students from the 390-odd ICSE and ISC schools ? 100 in Calcutta proper ? scored full marks in math, and several obtained 99 marks, a trend that was not noticed in the past few years, observed principals of a cross-section of schools.

 M.C. Alexander, a member of the Council and principal of St Jude School, attributed the rise in math marks to some recent changes in the syllabi and also in the teaching techniques of the subject. 

 ?Students have performed well in mathematics not only in Calcutta and Bengal. A similar trend is noticed in other parts of the country as well,? he clarified.

 Apart from mathematics, students have fared better in economics, computer applications and English, compared with previous years.

 In keeping with the national trend for some years now, girls in Calcutta and in the districts outshone boys in both ICSE and ISC. Bengal?s pass percentage among girls in ICSE was 95.92 per cent, compared to 94.17 per cent among boys. In ISC, the success rate among girls was 95.76 per cent against 91.39 per cent among boys.

 Between Calcutta Boys and Calcutta Girls, a tinge of disappointment lay in store for boys? school principal J.R. Emmanuel. ?I am happy at the overall results but a little disappointed with one candidate not passing in each of the exams.?

 The ICSE and ISC toppers in Calcutta Boys were Chirag Tibrewal (94.8 per cent) and Sanjiban Chowdhury (94 per cent), while at Calcutta Girls, the toppers were Indra Saha (96.5 per cent), and Debolina Mukherjee (96.75 per cent).

 ?I am very excited, especially about topping our school. The high point was 99 in economics. I want to do economics honours,? smiled Debolina.

 At La Martiniere for Girls, the ICSE topper was Samira Daswani (95.8 per cent) and the ISC topper was Shalini Iyengar (97.5 per cent).

 Rita Wilson, Council deputy secretary, told Metro late on Wednesday that the marksheets have already been despatched to schools from the Council?s Delhi office.

 ?The marksheets will be made available to the students from their respective schools by Thursday,? she confirmed.

 Eight fashion designers, eight 

 artists, four jewellery houses, three lifestyle stores and 

 an accessory designer. In its debut edition, the Art and 

 Design Show organised by Canvas Unlimited brought them all 

 to the Hyatt Regency Calcutta ballroom on Saturday.

 And the city sat up and took note, 

 loosened its purse strings and shopped and shopped. Only 

 this time it was for a cause all benefits from the daylong 

 exhibition went to the Friends of Tribal Society, striving 

 to make a difference to the lives of eight crore tribal 

 citizens of the country.

 Even before it was time for the 

 exhibition to get underway and while the stalls were still 

 being set up, women in their designer finery (georgettes 

 with heavy zardosi work), blow-dried hair and perfect 

 pout queued up to choose and pick the best items.

 The days proceedings began 

 with an auction of various items donated by the exhibitors. 

 So while there was a white cutwork salwar kameez by Rohit 

 Bal tagged at Rs 10,000, there was also a blue vase from 

 Hugli with a minimum bid amount of Rs 3,000.

 A black shirt with white threadwork 

 from H2O (Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna) at Rs 1,500 and 

 an embroidered clutch purse from Bea Accessories for Rs 

 2,000 were placed alongside a bright orange embroidered 

 sari from Payal Singhal for Rs 8,000. 

 Bidders picked up small cards 

 and jotted down their bid amounts alongside the product 

 codes. Two hours later, when bidding was closed, the highest 

 bidders picked up their respective prized possessions and 

 donated the entire amount to charity. A hundred bids from 

 about 15 bidders were placed during the two hours.

 A Sekhar Roy painting with a minimum 

 bid amount of Rs 5,000 was lapped up for Rs 20,000. Shantanu 

 Goenkas blue empire-line dress with a bag went for 

 Rs 15,300 while Rohit Bals salwar kameez managed to 

 raise Rs 18,000. Alka Javeris jadau bangle 

 (Rs 7,000) earned a highest bid of Rs 19,000 and Asit Sarkars 

 painting (Rs 7,000) went for Rs 11,111.

 Pick and choose

 Auction over, the focus shifted 

 to the exhibition. As the day wore on, ladies flocked to 

 the venue, exchanged pleasantries, compared notes, placed 

 orders and also bought some. The jewellery houses made brisk 

 business all day as crowds simply refused to move away from 

 their stalls. Nemichand Bamalwa and Sons had diamond and 

 jadau ornaments ranging from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 50 lakh. 

 Falguni Mehta and Alka Javeri exhibited a lot of diamonds 

 and coloured stones, both precious and semi-precious. Abhishek 

 Haritwal from Jaipur-based Haritsons lined up an eclectic 

 range of costume jewellery, coloured stones and jewels set 

 in silver alongside gold and silver fabric ornaments, priced 

 at Rs 4,000-plus. Shantanu Goenka and Anjalee Kapoor of 

 Surya Design Line also presented some jewellery, besides 

 their garments.

 Bea Accessories had a wide range 

 of bags from chic clutches and batuas to trendy 

 totes in white, aquamarine and metallic shades, priced 

 between Rs 1,200 and Rs 3,500. While Kaadamb had wooden 

 showpieces and home decor items, Delhi-based Emblem showcased 

 a line of soft furnishings. City lifestyle store Hugli had 

 an extensive array of products from glass flower vases 

 to marble dinner plates, from wooden photo frames to jute 

 bags.

 An entire section was devoted 

 to paintings and sketches Ananta Mandals cityscapes 

 and Sekhar Roys Radha-Krishnas shared space with Asit 

 Sarkar, Subroto Sen, Bibekananda Santra, Sudipta Tewari, 

 Avisankar Mitra and Saikat Patra.

 Fashion flair

 Last but not the least, there 

 was fashion and that too in generous doses.

 Anita Dongre in pristine white 

 made her presence felt in the morning. Tunics, tops, salwar 

 kameez and skirts comprised the mainstay of the 70-odd items 

 she had flown down with, but to her disappointment, the 

 western wear didnt find many takers. Calcutta 

 women are quite conservative in their tastes, rued 

 Anita.

 Possibly why Rohit Gandhi and 

 Rahul Khanna did not bring their womens wear label 

 Cue to the exhibition at all. A single white and plenty 

 of black, blue and dark brown shirts from H2O priced between 

 Rs 1,950 and Rs 4,200 filled the racks. 

 Shantanu Goenka presented his 

 trademark heavily-embroidered lehngas along with a few saris 

 and salwar kameezes.

 Rohit Bal had 60-odd salwar 

 suits, nearly 50 shirts and two lehngas. A maroon lehnga 

 teamed with a corset with intricate zardosi and sequin 

 work, tagged at Rs 5,65,990, failed to attract buyers.

 To the surprise of many in the 

 crowd, a few hours before the end of the event, Rohit announced 

 a 30 per cent discount on all his items.

 The Art and Design Show 

 has been a success and all the exhibitors are willing to 

 be part of the event next year, too, said Sweta Tantia 

 from Canvas Unlimited.

 Rohit Bal with his golden mane 

 and Aviator shades was undoubtedly the star attraction. 

 While Tanusree Shankar dropped 

 by in the morning, former Sananda Tilottama Jyoti 

 Brahmin was seen shopping around later in the day.

 Winner of the day: City 

 designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, for donating 10 items from 

 his collection. His stall was empty before noon.

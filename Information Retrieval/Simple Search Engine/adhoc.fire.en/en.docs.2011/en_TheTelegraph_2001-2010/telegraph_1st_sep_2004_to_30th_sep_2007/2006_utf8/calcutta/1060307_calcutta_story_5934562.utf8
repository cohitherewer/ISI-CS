The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mother saw rape victim 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Statements made by Virendra Ram?s mother corroborate the allegation that he had raped the wife of a patient on the Medical College and Hospital compound early on Sunday.

 Medical tests on the 26-year-old woman, whose husband Lalit Mondal is being treated for abdominal pain in the Green Building for the past few days, also suggest that she has been violated.

 ?Preliminary examinations indicate rape. There are also injury marks on her face. We are waiting for the detailed forensic report,? said a hospital official on Monday. 

 Virendra?s mother, Bailo Devi, said she had seen her son leave the radiotherapy building with a woman around the time Mondal?s wife alleged she had been raped. 

 Bailo Devi was sleeping on the floor of the single-storeyed building with Virendra?s six-year-old daughter.

 Bailo Devi?s husband, Ram Sevak Ram, is a security guard posted in the radiotherapy building. A paralytic, he is now admitted in the hospital. The Rams are from Bihar?s Arrah district, where Virendra?s wife and two more daughters live.

 ?Around one o? clock on Sunday night, I was woken up by a knock. I opened the door and saw Virendra,? Bailo Devi told Metro. He entered the toilet after asking his mother to go to sleep. ?As his turning up late was nothing unusual, I went back to sleep.?

 ?However, my sleep was broken for a second time by a sound and to my surprise, I saw Virendra leaving the building with an unknown woman,? Bailo Devi recalled.

 To a question from his mother about the identity of the woman, Virendra said she was a relative of a patient and had come to the radiotherapy building to sleep. 

 ?The woman was hurrying away. I asked him why she was leaving. He said she was feeling scared,? Bailo Devi added.

 Later in the day, she came to know about the charges against her son.

 On the basis of a complaint lodged by the victim, Virendra was arrested on Sunday evening. He was produced in court on Monday and remanded in police custody till March 14. 

 According to the hospital authorities, Virendra was working as a private attendant in the ward where Lalit Mondal is admitted. 

 ?The woman often talked to him while he was on the rounds,? an official said. 

 That?s why she did not suspect his motive when he told her on Sunday night that her husband?s condition was critical and asked her to accompany him to the ward.

 The hospital authorities, meanwhile, held meetings with police officers during the day. ?We are beefing up security on the campus,? said hospital superintendent Anup Roy.

 ?The private security personnel of the hospital have been asked to interact with the personnel in the police outpost on the hospital compound,? said Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (central division).

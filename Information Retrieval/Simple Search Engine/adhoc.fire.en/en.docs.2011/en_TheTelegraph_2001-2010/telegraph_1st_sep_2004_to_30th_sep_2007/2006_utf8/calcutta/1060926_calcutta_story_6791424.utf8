 Warrant out for jawan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Government Railway Police (GRP) has identified the Border Security Force (BSF) jawan who had reportedly slapped a German woman at Sealdah station on the night of September 12.

 Hoshair Singh, from the BSFs 73rd battalion in Krishnagar, has been charged with outraging the modesty of the woman and booked under Section 323 IPC for voluntarily causing hurt. 

 An arrest warrant has been issued against Singh and a Sealdah court has asked him to turn up by mid-October.

 The accused has been identified by some witnesses, said Barun Mullick, superintendent (GRP), Sealdah. 

 An investigating officer said Singh and four colleagues had come to Sealdah from Krishnagar on September 12, on their way to a BSF camp in Taratala. 

 Around 9 at night, Singh spotted the woman standing alone at the station. He asked her for her passport, but the woman said it was with her boyfriend, who had just gone to a stall. Singh then reportedly slapped the woman, said an officer.

 Its an unfortunate incident. He will be court-martialled, said S. Goyel, inspector-general, BSF (South Bengal).

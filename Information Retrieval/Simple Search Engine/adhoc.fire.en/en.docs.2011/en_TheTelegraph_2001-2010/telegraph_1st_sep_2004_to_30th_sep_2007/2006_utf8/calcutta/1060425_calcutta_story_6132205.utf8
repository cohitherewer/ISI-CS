 More to go Xaviers way

 - Adequate facilities can fetch colleges autonomous status

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Post-Assembly elections, Calcutta is set to have a string of autonomous colleges.

 A report prepared by the West Bengal Council of Higher Education has suggested that colleges with adequate infrastructure be granted autonomy.

 At present, St Xavier?s College is the only undergraduate institution in the state granted the status. It will soon be joined by Presidency College ? the chief minister had announced in the Assembly in February that the decision to grant autonomy to the College Street campus had been finalised.

 ?The autonomy of more colleges under Calcutta and other universities should be strengthened to offer courses in emerging areas,? the council observed in the report, tabled last week at a meeting organised to felicitate outgoing higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty (he has not been given a nomination in this election).

 The institutions next in line for an autonomous tag include Lady Brabourne College, Bidhannagar Government College and Bethune College. All these colleges are under the direct control of the government.

 Besides, Calcutta University plans to grant the status to some private colleges including Loreto and Ashutosh.

 ?Colleges with adequate infrastructure must have the freedom to modernise their curricula according to their requirements,? said Shyamapada Pal, member of the higher education council. ?That?s the rationale behind the council?s recommendation.?

 Debabrata Choudhury, principal of Ashutosh College, said he was aware of the council?s suggestion. The governing body of the college will meet after the polls, in the third week of May, to discuss the matter.

 ?Our college was the first in the city to approach Calcutta University for autonomy two years ago. We will submit a fresh application next month,? Choudhury said.

 ?Academic freedom of undergraduate colleges is a crucial requirement for fulfilling the demands of students today. Colleges with academic and operational freedom are imparting education of a high standard across the country,? he added. 

 To facilitate the granting of autonomy to St Xavier?s College, the government has amended the Calcutta University Act.

 ?Now that the provision for autonomous colleges has been incorporated into the act, we hope the university will accept our proposal,? Choudhury said.

 One of the most celebrated sculptors of the 20th century, Ramkinkar Baij was a fearless critic of the arts and made daring innovations that stormed the citadel of convention-ridden artists, quite early in his life. He was equally ruthless in dealing with Western naturalists who preferred to tread the safe path of verisimilitude. His two large compositions in cement on the simple lives of the santhals of Birbhum are great contributions to Indian sculpture heritage. No less active in the field of painting, his works in oil have the same vitality that he invested in his sculptures. In his watercolours, he revelled with pure abandon, splashing colours with brilliant effect and making lines swirl with rhythmic cadence. In revered memory of the legendary artist, Nandan, an association of former students of Kala Bhavan, Shantiniketan, is organising the ongoing group-show of paintings, ceramics, sculptures and graphics. Participating artists include Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Suchibrata Deb, Arundhati Banerjee, Chanchal Krishna Dey, Amit Bose, Manik Talukdar, Sukumar Bhattacharjee, Amiya Nimai Dhara, Haren Thakur, Jahar Dasgupta and Krishna Dutta Samanta.

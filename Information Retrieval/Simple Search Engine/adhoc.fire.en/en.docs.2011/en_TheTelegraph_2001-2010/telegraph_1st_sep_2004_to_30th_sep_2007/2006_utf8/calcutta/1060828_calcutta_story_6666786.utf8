The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The character amp; its reality

 Thats what defines VIDYA BALAN and her decisions as an actress. In the run-up to the release of Lage Raho Munnabhai, she speaks to Reshmi Sengupta

You 

 have shed the traditional girl image for a glamorous look. 

 Is the makeover a conscious decision?

 No, not at all. Raju Hirani and Mr Chopra (Vidhu Vinod) were writing the Munnabhai seuqel while we were shooting for Parineeta. And by the end of Parineeta, they wanted me to test for Munnabhai and I got through the screen test. We also shot a couple of scenes with one look but then Sunil Dutt passed away and several other things forced a seven-month break.

 When we started the film again, we began working on a different look for me. Raju Hirani said he could try out the new look and shoot the scenes again. And within a week, Sheena Parikh, who had written the screenplay of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, took me to a hairstylist, got my hair cut and coloured. Then we decided on the wardrobe, which she designed. When we shot in my new look, everybody went ballistic. Mr Chopra liked it very much, and I was on the desktop in his office (laughs).

 Its a very normal everyday look. Lage Raho Munnabhai is a very real film so you cant have an ultra-glam look. It had to be real and pretty at the same time. This film is a very refreshing change for me after Parineeta. People who have attended the special screenings have been telling me that I am looking very fresh and young. So, I think it has worked. I feel proud to belong to Lage Raho Munnabhai.

 But are you comfortable doing 

 ultra-glam roles?

 I would like to work in films where my look would be something that defines the character. I am hoping that I can do ultra-glam roles and that I succeed in doing them. I am willing to do whatever the character demands. I go by the character and all that leads you to believe in the reality of the character the scenes, the script, the costumes, the look.

 What about Lage Raho Munnabhai 

 makes you proud?

 I loved doing Parineeta but Munnabhai was a completely different genre of film. Its a cult film because you dont get to see a comedy like this these days. It keeps making you laugh all through and tells some simple truths of life that we otherwise dont pay any heed to. I cant remember the last comedy I saw other than Munnabhai MBBS which had this kind of a sensibility. Its not slapstick. Its so clean that you can sit and watch it with your family. The other interesting thing is the way Raju Hirani has used Gandhiji and his ideology. Its a film made straight from the heart.

 And your co-actors, Sanjay 

 Dutt and Arshad Warsi?

 Oh! Sanjay and Arshad are just unbelievable. They have an excellent sense of timing for comedy. It was nice working with Sanjay again after Parineeta, and it was very reassuring to have co-actors like them.

 How important is your role 

 in the scheme of the film?

 Well, Lage Raho Munnabhai starts with Munna falling in love with my voice. I play Jahnavi who is a radio jockey, and radio plays a very important role in the film. So thats how my character becomes important. This is not a film about radio or radio jockeys.

 In Nikhil Adavanis Salaam-e-Ishq, 

 you play one of the couples with John Abraham among 

 a pair of six. Is there any tension with so much competition?

 John and my track has been shot independently. I dont even know what the other tracks are. So theres no competition with anyone. In fact, I chose this film depending on what Nikhil had narrated to me; I had said yes to it the moment he read out the script.

 What are your forthcoming projects?

 Eklavya is ready for release and I am shooting for Sajid Khans Hey Baby with Akshay Kumar, Riteish and Fardeen Khan. Its a fun film, a comedy where I will play a modern girl. I have signed Shaji Karuns Suryamukhi which I cant talk about. This is on painter Raja Ravi Varma and his muse. I will start Priyadarshans Chandramukhi in 2007. This is a Hindi remake of the Malayalam film Manichthrathazhu, and I am playing a dancer.

 Rituparno Ghoshs Rahgeer 

 is not happening, after all

 No, its not happening and there arent any other offers from Bengal either. My Bengali has become a lot better now!

 Have you made any friends in 

 the film industry now?

 I dont socialise much and keep to my family, but Raima (Sen) has become a very close friend.

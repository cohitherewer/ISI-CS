 Circuit house for cost cut

 SHALMOLI KUNDU

 To cut expenditure on state guests, the public works department (PWD) is building another circuit house in the city. A 30-cottah plot near Gol Park has been earmarked for the purpose. The budget will be about Rs 1 crore.

 Theres not enough space in the existing circuit house to put up all the state guests. This has prompted us to take up the new project, said PWD secretary P.K. Agarwal.

 The rooms in the new circuit house will be airconditioned. Amenities such as intercom and car parking will also be available. There will be about 30 rooms in the building. Space permitting, more rooms might be built.

 The department has decided to be careful while recruiting the staff for the circuit house. We often receive complaints from guests about the quality of service provided at our guest houses. So, we will recruit employees for the new facility with care. We have already approached various hotel management institutes, said Agarwal. 

 The construction of the circuit house is expected to begin right after the Puja and be completed by March next year, said a PWD official. 

 Currently, many state guests have to be put up at five-star hotels due to a space crunch in the government guest house. The circuit house, once ready, will be able to accommodate some of these guests.

 The existing state government circuit house in Calcutta is on Hungerford Street. It has 25 rooms. After Darjeeling, Murshidabad, Malda and Purulia, Calcutta will be the fifth site in Bengal to have more than one circuit house.

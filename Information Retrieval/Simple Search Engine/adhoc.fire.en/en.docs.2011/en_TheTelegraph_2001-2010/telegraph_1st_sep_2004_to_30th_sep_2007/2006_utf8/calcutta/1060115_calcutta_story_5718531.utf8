 Boys night out

 G irls wanting to have some fun have it pretty easy. All it takes is one smooth strut to a nightclub and just a smiling manager stands between them and a whole night of partying. No questions asked, good-to-see-you-greetings and their night out just couldnt have got off to a better start.

 Poor guys. Just ask them how their stag evening begins and their sob story gushes forth. Well, apart from that occasional boys-night-out, be prepared to hear out how tried to ? and of course failed to ? convince a grumbling girlfriend or a fussy female buddy to give them company (and an easy entry ticket to where big boys play at night).

 At the night club door, that same keeper who smiles when they have a girl on their arm, grouches when they have none.

 Did someone say its a mans world? Some like Sovan Mukherjee of Shisha come up with the male-female ratio needs to be maintained mantra, while others like Ravdeep Singh of B.E.D acknowledge the absurdity of the no men only concept in India. Abroad, theres nothing called stag entry because the girl-guy ratio comes naturally. Its over here that we need to consciously work towards it, feels Ravdeep.

 Being a regular ? and a genteel one to boot ? at a club does help. And while they all maintain that there are no real rules pertaining to the no entry of stags to a nightclub, a handy list of dos and donts never hurt anyone. 

 Heres the GoodLife guide that can help the boys through the bouncer-covered door of their favourite night haunt.

 Do

 Dress decent. I begin screening the guy when he is about 20 metres away, admits Ravdeep. So guys, remember that first impressions count big-time. Dress well, look good and the job is half done. The guy doesnt have to be great looking or anything; decent is good enough, says the man in B.E.D. 

 Be polite and mild. The way you introduce yourself is extremely important ? so be soft-spoken and well-mannered, tips off Sovan, who feels that if the tone is rude outside and problems begin at the gate, then a hectic night full of trouble could be easily anticipated. 

 Agrees Anirban Simlai, F amp;B director at The Park: Its much nicer if the guy just comes up and requests an entry sweetly, rather than throwing his weight around. Ravdeep, too, banks a lot on the first conversation that he starts off to check out a party persons mannerisms.

 Do some homework before stepping out. Simlai suggests you get a member or a regular party-hopper to call the bar you want to go to and arrange for your entry. This way, it is simpler for both visitors and hosts, and also saves the hopeful walk-ins a whole lot of embarrassment while gate-crashing. Unless its a bad profile, we usually dont say no, stresses Simlai. 

 Enter the club with other regulars. Not only will you get noticed in no time, even the management will be convinced about your credentials.

 Dont

 Never demand an entry. Raising your voice and being rude ups the chances of you being blacklisted at that spot forever. No one forgets an unpleasant scene, so make sure you arent party to any. 

 Dont flash the rest of your nightclub cards at an entry point. Many guys purposely have their other cards in their hands while negotiating an entry. That doesnt help matters, reveals Ravdeep. So while you might be a privilege member at one bar, it by no way guarantees you a walk-in at another. 

 Dont drop names because that doesnt impress anyone at all. Try and get in by your own merit, not your friends uncles. Calcutta is a small place and it is far too connected, people here feel that they are kings? Someone will just dial someone and say come out and get me in. Thats disgusting, says a manager who chose not to be named.

 And even once youve managed your way in, dont dare go and bump into the ladies on the dance floor. Thats when we have to say no to stag dancing, says Ravdeep. And the next time, Mr Bumper is bounced out at the door.

 Now for the good news. The right kind of single guys are welcome. As Simlai sums up: If the guy is a hunk, he would surely act as a magnet for the girls. And any club will welcome a big drinker. All these add up to better business!

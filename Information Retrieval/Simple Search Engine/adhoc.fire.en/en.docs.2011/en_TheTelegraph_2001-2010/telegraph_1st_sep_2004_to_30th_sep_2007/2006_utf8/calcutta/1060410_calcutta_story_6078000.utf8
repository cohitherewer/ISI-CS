The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pass to Rooney, coffee with Butt

 - Calcutta boy settles down in Birmingham City?s football academy

 Chiraag in front of his Birmingham student home in his academy tracks

 Knocking the ball with Wayne Rooney on the St Andrews pitch, helping him warm up before Man U took on Birmingham City. Sipping coffee with stars of the Blues? Premiership squad like Nicky Butt. And grapevine buzz of Arsenal spotters eyeing him among other foreigners in his academy for the Gunners? fabled junior programme?

 For 17-year-old Calcutta boy Paul Chiraag, the ?first Asian to get a full and unconditional scholarship? to study and train for becoming a professional footballer in England, the kick-off four-and-a-half months in the Midlands have been as memorable as they were rewarding.

 From landing in Birmingham at 3 am 18 hours behind schedule, to the first training session at the Wast Hills grounds in sub-zero temperatures in November rain and snow to the star-gazing during Birmingham City?s home ties ? it?s been living out a non-stop football fantasy.

 The South Birmingham College, which has an alliance with Birmingham City Football Club?s ?Football in the Community? wing for a comprehensive football and education programme, has offered Chiraag a ?full scholarship for the duration of the course for two years? to study the BTEC National Diploma in Sports Studies.

 ?The weather was surely a huge challenge, more so, since I had never seen snow before. But the toughest ask has been the fitness levels expected here and I must say that has been the biggest value-addition to my game,? Chiraag (Jeet to his parents and friends) tells Metro from his Sellyoak home in Birmingham.

 Besides catching up with the Drogbas and Henrys (academy kids help out with odd jobs on home match-days and get to sit alongside the Blues reserves), the most memorable event for Chiraag has been receiving the gear of the Birmingham City Football Club Football Development School. ?The day he brought home his three sets of academy uniforms, he literally ate and slept in them,? remembers father Pradeep who had been to the Midlands to handle the budding striker?s start-up blues.

 A typical day in Chiraag?s Birmingham bastion starts at 6.30 and he has to report for practice at St Andrews by 8.30, from where, the training pitches of Wast Hills are a short bus ride away. ?We train till 11.45 and then break for brunch when we can catch up with the senior team in the clubhouse,? says the youngster.

 Then there?s college and home assignments, and he has notched up a 4.5 grade in academics from a maximum possible five, scoring distinctions in two presentations. On the pitch, his goals and assists have boosted the academy team at Wednesday and Friday matches.

 ?Jeet has been extremely lucky in getting the right breaks at the right time,? feels mother Arunima. And the Pauls, nurturing their son?s dream at their Udita apartment, are in step with the odds the youngster must overcome before kicking a ball in the English Premier League.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The foreign tag SEZ it all

 - Students, teachers debate global institutes on home soil 

 Ahuge area housing campuses of 

 foreign universities and reputed private institutes of higher 

 education from across the globe could be a reality across 

 the country in the near future. The Union commerce ministry 

 has readied a proposal for setting up special education 

 zones. A consultation paper submitted to the human resources 

 ministry suggested that the special zones offer flexible 

 rules to invite foreign investors.

 The idea has already sparked off 

 a debate amongst the student and teaching communities in 

 the city. Many feel that the proposal has the potential 

 to boost the education sector in the state, while others 

 doubt the feasibility of the plan. It is still undecided 

 whether the foreign institutes should be given the same 

 status as the national universities and institutions.

 Before the Centre reaches 

 a decision in this regard, it should be certain which universities 

 and institutes would be interested in setting up their campuses 

 in the special zones. The quality of education on offer 

 has to be judged thoroughly instead of jumping into something 

 in the lure of courses with foreign tags, said Zaad 

 Mahmood, who is doing his Ph.D in globalisation and law 

 and is a lecturer of political science in Jaipuria College.

 Some students of Calcutta University 

 and Jadavpur University feel that giving the foreign universities 

 the same status as national universities can prove detrimental. 

 The Indian universities will then lose out both academically 

 and economically, said a post-graduate student of 

 history in Calcutta University. Monitoring by UGC 

 and AICTE is a must for the standardisation of fees and 

 syllabi, said Anwesha Ghosh, another Calcutta University 

 student.

 But the university authorities 

 are quite open to the competition. Neither Jadavpur 

 nor Calcutta will be affected as long as we render our services 

 properly, said Manoj Mitra, dean of the engineering 

 and technology department, Jadavpur. The regulations for 

 the universities here should be applicable to the foreign 

 universities, said Asis Kumar Banerjee, vice-chancellor, 

 Calcutta University. 

 Another threat, many feel, would 

 be the high pay packages at the foreign institutes that 

 may lure teachers from their Indian counterparts. 

 Most students feel that the quota 

 system should be kept away from the foreign institutes, 

 in case they are here. The biggest advantage, they say, 

 is the opportunity to pursue courses in subjects that many 

 Indian universities dont provide. Subjects like 

 molecular biology, mass media and comparative studies would 

 be really welcome, said Tanmoy Das Lala, a Class XI 

 student of St Xaviers Collegiate School. The other 

 benefit is reasonable fees for a foreign degree, that too 

 nearer home. Special zones would encourage healthy 

 competition, which is much needed in the existing education 

 system, said Medha Mehta, who is doing her MBA at 

 ICFAI, Hyderabad.

 In awe of USA

The composition of the United 

 Nations Security Council bears the signs of a bygone colonial 

 era. The UN today functions like a subordinate office of 

 the US State Department and has become a mere tool to legitimise 

 US hegemony. 

 The nuke tests conducted by North Korea is undoubtedly an act against the collective interest of the entire human race. Thus, the imposition of sanctions by the Council is justified. But this very act also confirms the Councils exceedingly cordial disposition towards the US, which while staging a vociferous protest against the brazen act seems to have forgotten all about the deadly weapons of mass destruction at its own disposal.

 The UN glorifies the essence of democracy and equality but frustrates the same by not making any concerted effort to ensure the elimination or surrender of weapons of mass destruction by some of its pet nations. This undoubtedly raises a question on the credibility of the UN itself.

 Today we need an international body that promises pro-active conflict resolution, dedicated security forces, a truly democratic set-up, and most importantly, freedom from the US hegemony of which we have already had an overdose.

 Net results

 It is undoubtedly a great feeling 

 to find someone special just a click away. But at these 

 online communities one comes across people who are the last 

 one would expect to find there. Trust me, you cannot judge 

 a person by the testimonials, scraps and picture. Keep yourself 

 safe and save yourself from embarrassing situations. The 

 Internet is a great place as long as your personal details 

 are safe.

Sirs vs students

 A spectacular football match between 

 students and teachers took place on our school grounds on 

 October 18. It was both surprising and fun to watch our 

 teachers step on field in red T-shirts and shorts. We were 

 so used to seeing them in western formals in school that 

 it was a welcome change. The students were in a white uniform. 

 While the team of teachers was cheered on by their colleagues, 

 we screamed slogans for our buddies. Among the participating 

 teachers were Kumar Saha (PT), Partha Pratim Pal (physics), 

 Partha Datta (English) and Krishnendu Bose (maintenance 

 officer).

 The match started amid roars from the enthusiastic audience. 

 Though the teachers played their level best, the students 

 won the match 6-4, courtesy their young age and stamina. 

 It was one delightful watch. Hats off to the sporting spirit 

 of our teachers.

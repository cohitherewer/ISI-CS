The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fog?s first victim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 This winter?s fog claimed its first victim around midnight on Sunday. 

 Devendra Agarwal, in his mid-20s, was driving down St George?s Gate Road, towards Vidyasagar Setu. Unable to negotiate the turns in the thick fog, he rammed into the road divider. 

 The car overturned and Agarwal, a resident of Bally, was critically injured in the head, chest and abdomen.

 A jeep patrolling the area spotted the vehicle. ?The cops immediately set the car upright and took an unconscious Agarwal to SSKM Hospital,? said an officer of the traffic department.

 ?The doctors admitted him and tried their best to revive the youth. But their efforts proved futile and Agarwal died around 1.30 am,? the officer added.

 The traffic department?s fatal squad officers conducted an on-the-spot investigation.

 ?The left front wheel of the vehicle was broken. It appears the car had first hit the median and then overturned,? said Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner (traffic).

 An officer working on the case said: ?Our men on patrol duty on Sunday night were constantly alerting the control room that roads, especially in the Maidan area, were covered with dense fog. Nothing could be seen at a distance.?

 On Monday, Metro published a series of dos and don?ts the traffic department of the city police had issued for pedestrians and motorists to beat the fog between mid-January and mid-February. 

 Fifteen persons, including three cops, were killed during the period last winter. 

 The advisory contained a request for motorists to instal fog lights on their vehicles. Agarwal?s car, police said, had no such light.

 Reiterating the department?s plea, Shamim said on Monday: ?Be on alert while driving a car or crossing a road. Do not take any risks. If you can?t see the road at a distance, stop driving till you get a better view.?

 Creation and its preservation and dissolution in this universe are controlled by energy. This energy, which can be both positive and negative, is manifested in women as shakti, an indestructible, infinite power. Presented by Shinjan Nrityalaya, Shakti ? formidable women power is an Odissi performance that attempts to evoke this strength and pay tribute to women who have displayed valour, courage and power for the benefit of mankind. Performed through stories taken from Hindu mythology, it portrays shakti in both its fierce and gentle aspects. Depicted as complementary to male power, it is tender in the role of a mother, wife or daughter, or violent like Sati when she assumed the form of Mahavidyas. This unique dance ensemble, embellished with Sabda Nritya and Ravan Chhaya, is also an endeavour to revive these nearly extinct art forms. Concept, choreography and direction: Aloka Kanungo.

 Event: A choreographic presentation by Shinjan Nrityalaya

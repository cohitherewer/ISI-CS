 Jobless man hangs self

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Driven to despair after three years of unemployment, soon after losing use of the fingers of his left palm, Sudeb Pal, in his mid 30s, committed suicide in the Charu Market police station area early on Sunday. Pal hanged himself from a tree near the Lake Gardens flyover.

 Though no suicide note was found either on Pal?s person or in the room in which he lived, police said the man may have taken his life following acute depression. 

 According to the police, Pal left his residence at the CMDA quarters in Charu Chandra Place well after midnight and went straight to the flyover. He then climbed a tree and hanged himself with a rope.

 Pal had met with an accident in the factory where he worked three years ago. In spite of being under long-term treatment, his fingers never functioned again.

 ?Pal lost his job. He approached a number of companies and shop-owners for a job. But they turned him away after seeing his defective hand. It made him depressed,? said an officer of Charu Market police station. 

 ?He used tell his mother frequently that if his left hand functioned properly, he would have been an employed person,? the officer added.

 While having dinner together on Saturday night, his mother noticed that he was down. ?When she tried to find out why, Pal did not answer,? said N.R. Babu, deputy commissioner of police (south), adding: ?She did not become suspicious because Pal used to be depressed most of the time.? 

 He went out after his mother fell asleep. Earlier, he had had a spat with his younger brother, who lived in the same flat, over their water line.

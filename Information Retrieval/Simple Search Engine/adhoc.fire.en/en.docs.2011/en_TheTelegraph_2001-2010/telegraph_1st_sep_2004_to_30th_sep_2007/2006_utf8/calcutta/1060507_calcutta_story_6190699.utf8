The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The Merc of 

 a man

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 I 

 am not sure whether I should tell you the story first or 

 start by explaining why I am telling you the story. I guess 

 this ?once upon a time? story will be much more fun. So 

 here we go.

 This is the story of Dorothy, 

 daughter of a billionaire father, and Robert, who hailed 

 from a family of modest means. They met at a friend?s place. 

 Then the usual Mills amp; Boon story line evolved. After 

 some months of dating, Dorothy decided to marry Robert. 

 Yes, you read it right: Dorothy took the decision. Robert 

 was too scared to ask. Dorothy?s father met Robert and whole-heartedly 

 endorsed his daughter?s choice. No heartbreaks, no ?give 

 me a few years to prove how worthy I am?. Instead, there 

 was pat mangni and a date was set for the chat 

 shaadi.

 On D-day, after the rituals and 

 speeches, the couple rushed out of church. As they got to 

 the courtyard, they were greeted by a gleaming red brand 

 new Mercedes Benz. Dorothy was ecstatic and Robert was dazed. 

 In a few minutes they were out of city limits.

 It was late afternoon when, after 

 a leisurely lunch by a river, they got back to the car. 

 Robert turned the ignition key, nothing happened. He tried 

 again, nothing happened. Robert was upset. Had he mishandled 

 the car? After all he had never driven such an expensive 

 car before. Dorothy took out her mobile phone and called 

 her father. Her father was embarrassed ? the car had come 

 straight from the factory on the morning of the wedding. 

 He told Dorothy not to worry; he would do something.

 That was assurance enough for 

 the daughter. An hour later, Dorothy was woken up by the 

 sound of an approaching helicopter. The helicopter landed 

 and an auto-mechanic emerged. He opened the bonnet of the 

 car. What?s wrong, asked Dorothy. The mechanic said the 

 car was delivered in a hurry and they forgot to put an engine 

 in the car. My god what will we do now, screamed Dorothy. 

 We have instructions to airlift you both, smiled the mechanic. 

 Relieved, Dorothy hugged Robert. 

 Constrained by the tight embrace, 

 Robert could barely whisper to the mechanic: If there was 

 no engine in the car, how did the Merc come this far? The 

 mechanic?s prompt reply: On goodwill, sir.

 Now let me remind you of a modern-day 

 fairy tale. Sachin Tendulkar had a tennis elbow and has 

 now undergone a shoulder surgery. He has not played any 

 cricket for about three months. His recent scores are very 

 un-Sachin like. His recent response to chin music has been 

 embarrassing. For the first time, someone has raised the 

 question, Tendulkar or Endulkar? Yet, he is about to sign 

 a contract worth Rs 180 crore for endorsement rights over 

 the next three years.

 The connection between the two 

 fairy tales is pretty obvious. These days they call it brand 

 equity.

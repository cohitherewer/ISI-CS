The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You cant 

 get through this week without

 Grooving through the night 

 with DJ Aqeel

 If superheroes are the 

 filmi flavour of the season with Krrish and 

 Superman soaring at the multiplexes, heres 

 your chance to rock to the tunes of a super DJ! The king 

 of remixes, DJ Aqeel from Mumbai, is all set to show Calcutta 

 ? yet again ? why when it comes to partying, theres 

 no one quite like him. With chartbusters like Disco 82 

 and the Kajra re Remix ruling the nightclubs, Aqeel 

 is clearly the music man of the moment. So, get set to dance 

 to his tunes at Tantra this Saturday night as Aqeel spins 

 tracks and charms the crowd as only he can.

 Perking up the home with aqua 

 splashes

 With the weather being 

 rather dull and dreary owing to the late monsoon blues, 

 perk up your interiors with some vibrant splashes. Indulge 

 in some home linen in bright hues, with an emphasis on aqua 

 tones to match the seasons mood. So, polka dots and 

 floral prints in aqua blue and green, with an occasional 

 dash of magenta or orange can add that spark to your private 

 space and lift your mood when the world outside looks grey.

 Catching up on Corporate culture

 After the dim beer bars 

 and shimmering night parties, Madhur Bhandarkar has now 

 aimed his roving camera at boardroom politics. Corporate, 

 his latest real-meets-reel roulette stars Bipasha Basu and 

 Kay Kay Menon in the lead, with quite a supporting cast 

 in Rajat Kapoor, Raj Babbar, Sameer Dattani and Minissha 

 Lamba. Part of a trilogy that started with Page 3 and 

 will end with Signal, Corporate is the ideal 

 small film between a Krrish and a KANK. If 

 for nothing else, catch it coz Bipasha is called Nishigandha 

 Dasgupta!

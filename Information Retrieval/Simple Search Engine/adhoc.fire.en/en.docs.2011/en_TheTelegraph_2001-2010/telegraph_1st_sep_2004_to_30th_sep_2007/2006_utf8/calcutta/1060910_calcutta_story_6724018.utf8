 Footloose fun, Friday fashion

What: Vive La Salsa. 

Where: Roxy at The Park.

When: Wednesday night, 9 pm onwards.

The bash: The first Wednesday of every month will see Roxy get into Latino 

mode with Aditya Upadhyay of Vive La Salsa co-hosting a salsa party. Students, 

regular guests and not-so-regular guests dropped in this Wednesday to experience 

a sexy salsa session and pick up some quick merengue moves. 

 The evening began with Aditya taking the floor accompanied by his partner Shaneel Mukherjee. The demo-performance acted as a trailer of what was to come in the next hour or so feeling the rhythm, getting into the groove and, of course, learning the right moves. 

 The workshop culminated with a round of Rueda Cuban-style salsa, in a circle and left the audience pleasantly surprised.

If only: The guy-girl ratio was better. As usual, the number of women outnumbered 

the men. No partner, no salsa!

Voiceover: Though the latest trend seems to be learning how to salsa, 

sadly there arent many places to flaunt the moves. Roxy provides a ready 

platform to enjoy the lessons learnt and pick up some new ones too. Special classes 

are held at Solace (day spa at Sunny Park) on the Saturday before the party, 

said Namrata Ray of The Park.

 Style splash

 Models at the fashion show in Underground.

What: McDowells No. 1 Diet Mate party.

Where: Underground at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

When: Friday night.

Take a look: While DJ Anshul was at the turntable spinning out Bollywood remixes 

one after another, an hour-long fashion show choreographed by Prithviraj Ghosh 

was the prime attraction of the evening.

 City models Jessica, Tina, Ishika, Priyanka Kohli, Rusha and Dipanjan walked the ramp in outfits from La Lingerie.

Clubwear, sportswear, swimwear and casuals made up 

the collection paraded at the nightclub.

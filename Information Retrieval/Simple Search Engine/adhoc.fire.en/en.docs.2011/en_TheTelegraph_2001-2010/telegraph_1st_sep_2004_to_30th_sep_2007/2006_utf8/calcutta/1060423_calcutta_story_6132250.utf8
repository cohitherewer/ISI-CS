 They overwhelmed the Delhi crowd 

 with a glittering grand finale at the Wills Lifestyle India 

 Fashion Week (WLIFW) about a fortnight ago. Now, designer 

 duo Rahul Khanna and Rohit Gandhi is set to impress on a 

 very different stage. The designers behind the labels Cue 

 and H2O will soon debut in Bollywood by creating costumes 

 for Indias first science fiction movie.

 The deal is not yet finalised, 

 but in all likelihood we will be doing it. Its a first-of-its 

 kind film in Bollywood, totally futuristic in the genre 

 of Jurassic Park and Terminator, revealed 

 the two, in town for the launch of the fashion store 85 

 Lansdowne.

 They added in the same breath: 

 We have always been totally against doing movie wardrobes. 

 Many model-turned-actors like John (Abraham) and Dino (Morea) 

 have requested us to design for films, but we have stayed 

 away... This project is so interesting that we decided to 

 go for it.

 Films apart, the coming months 

 will see the duo launching a couple of new stores in Delhi. 

 First up is a swank store in Crescent, the mall housing 

 a plethora of designer labels, next month.

 We had to do this store 

 after the 1 MG Road one was closed down. Soon we will be 

 launching another store at Emporio, which will boast stores 

 by big international brands, said Rahul.

 Then there is a big art show coming 

 up at their gallery in Delhi. We have been working 

 with artists from Calcutta like Jogen Chowdhury, Chitravanu 

 Mazumdar and Ganesh Haloi for a long time and they are always 

 a part of our art shows, reveals Rahul.

 The designers are also busy readying 

 a special line for Harrods, the fashion store in London 

 that placed a small order with them at the WLIFW. 

 Along with Harrods, the two also bagged orders from a host 

 of stores in West Asia, Japan, Istanbul and Turkey. 

 Indian designers are very 

 well accepted in the West Asian market because our design 

 sensibilities match their taste. The market is conservative, 

 but they buy in bulk, says the duo. 

 West Asian market is so important 

 to the Indian fashion industry that while fixing dates for 

 the spring-summer edition of WLIFW in end August-beginning 

 September, the organisers made sure they dont clash 

 with the Ramazan days, revealed Rohit.

 The Calcutta market, feel the 

 designers, is hugely ready for a designer wear 

 boom and 85 Lansdowne according to them comes just at the 

 right time.

 In Calcutta we have been 

 retailing from Kali and CIMA Designs in Forum and the response 

 has always been great. Following that we decided to open 

 our own store here and were even scouting for a location. 

 So when Shalini (Nopany) came with the proposal of a shop-in-shop 

 in 85 Lansdowne, it suited us perfectly, said Rahul.

 The designers have taken up one 

 full room at the store where they will be first showcasing 

 their summer collection. A deviation from their signature 

 structured look, the collection sees lots of flowing sheers. 

 The look is feminine and romantic, with a generous dose 

 of laces, pearls and crochet, embellishments that the designers 

 term the biggest trend of the moment.

 We have always believed 

 in doing wearable clothes rather than working around a concept 

 and just making a statement. And we are sure Calcutta will 

 accept our style sensibility, they signed off.

 Bollywood seems to be keeping 

 quite a few of our designers busy of late. Raghavendra Rathore 

 is definitely one of them. The prince of Jodhpur has just 

 finished designing the entire wardrobe for Vidhu Vinod Chopras 

 Eklavya and is considering two other projects at 

 the moment.

 Bollywood is the highest 

 level of couture. You not only have to work according to 

 the script requirements and the directors specifications, 

 but also the whims and fancies of the actors, smiled 

 Raghavendra, in Calcutta for the launch of 85 Lansdowne.

 The designer has created the entire 

 wardrobe for Eklavya, a film set in Rajasthan that 

 stars Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, Vidya Balan, Raima 

 Sen and Boman Irani, among others.

 The story is set against 

 the backdrop of Rajasthan and deals with the tussle between 

 modern thinking and old values. Its not a period film, 

 but the look is very royal Rajasthan, he explained.

 Designing for the Big B, who plays 

 the bodyguard of the maharaja, played by Boman Irani, was 

 a thoroughly enjoyable experience because he himself 

 gets very involved with creating the right look.

 But it was Bomans look that 

 gave the designer a tough time. I had to transform 

 him into a feminine maharaja. The difficult part was that 

 it couldnt be in-your-face feminine because he is 

 a maharaja, and yet it had to be brought out subtly, 

 he shared.

 Raghavendras most enjoyable 

 task, however, was designing for Vidya. She can carry 

 off the old-world look to perfection and understands fashion 

 really well.

 From reel to real fashion, Raghavendra 

 will be launching a summer diffusion line at his shop-in-shop 

 at 85 Lansdowne. A basic, quick and convenient 

 collection boasts a lot of old-world motifs and ideas. The 

 fabrics are skin-friendly ? cottons and lycra.

 Thoroughly excited about the venture, 

 Raghavendra sees a strong trend of mixing real estate 

 with fashion. Today, while speaking about a big mall 

 or a designer store, people talk in terms of hangar space 

 and not square feet, he observed. I think thats 

 a very interesting pointer to how important fashion is becoming 

 in India. Very soon, fashion will be the nucleus of modern 

 India.

 Ask him whether Calcutta is ready 

 for a designer shop-in-shop concept and Raghavendra is confidence 

 personified. It has worked in Mumbai and Delhi and 

 its even starting to work in Jaipur, so it is bound 

 to work in Calcutta. Plus, Sabyasachi (Mukherjee) and Anamika 

 (Khanna) have jolted the Calcutta fashion industry in a 

 big way. In fact, Anamika set the fashion retail ball rolling 

 with her studio, he felt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Bright spark in dark flick

Screen On amp; Off

 Red hot: Jennifer Connelly

 It?s taken some time to come to Calcutta but the Jennifer Connelly-starrer Dark Water is finally here. The spooky film has the Oscar-winning actress playing the role of Dahlia Williams, who is a single mother with a new job and a new apartment. With her strained separation from her husband leading into a bitter custody battle, Dahlia?s new flat ? dilapidated, cramped, and worn ? takes on a life of its own. 

 It?s also been quite some time that Connelly has come on the Calcutta big screen. She was last seen in her award-winning portrayal of Alicia Nash in A Beautiful Mind. Her subsequent releases didn?t come to the city theatres. And the kind of offbeat fare that Connelly has been doing, it?s unlikely that she will return to the Calcutta halls in the near future.

 Currently, Connelly is working on a film titled Little Children. Co-starring Kate Winslet, the film revolves around a group of young married women, whose lives intersect on the playgrounds, town pools and streets of their small community in surprising and potentially dangerous ways.

 The actress, who first came into the reckoning in the Joaquin Phoenix-Liv Tyler-starrer Inventing the Abbotts, will also be working in The Blood Diamond opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and then will be seen in the 2007 release The Berkeley Connection alongside the likes of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall.

 Twin treat: John Abraham and Nana Patekar in Taxi No. 9211

 Nana Patekar in a music video? Well, this apparently impossible development has been achieved for his forthcoming film Taxi No. 9211. Nana will be seen along with co-stars John Abraham and Sameera Reddy in a specially shot hip-hop music video to promote the Ramesh Sippy production. 

 The song, sung by Adnan Sami, has been shot by the film?s director Milan Luthria himself. It has been choreographed by Piyush, assistant of director Farah Khan. Farah recently made the Bluffmaster! video Right here, right now. 

 ?My film is inspired from the popular cartoon characters Tom and Jerry,? says Luthria. ?It?s about two people from completely different walks of life and what happens when they meet each other. The music video will be a fun addition.?

 Not just that, Taxi No. 9211 will also feature the Daddy of Disco, Bappi Lahiri, as the singer. This is for the first time that Bappida has sung for a composer other than himself. The lucky music director duo is Vishal-Shekhar. The foot-tapping Bappi Lahiri track Mumbai nagariya, which has been playing on the small screen as part of the film?s teasers, is turning out to be a chartbuster of sorts.

 Class act: Isabelle Huppert

 The bold and beautiful Isabelle Huppert is a favourite of two great French film-makers ? Claude Chabrol and Jean-Luc Godard. With her versatile acting abilities, both on screen and stage, and her choice of roles, the French actress has reached out to a wider pan-European audience. 

 The French Association is holding a retrospective of her works as part of the Calcutta Book Fair, starting February 1. The screenings are at Nandan II, at 3 pm and 6 pm. 

 Day One features Claude Goretta?s The Lacemaker, followed by Godard?s Every Man for Himself. February 2 showcases Maurice Pialat?s Loulou and Diane Kurys?s At First Sight. Claude Chabrol?s Madame Bovary and Christian Vincent?s The Separation are slated for February 6. Chabrol?s A Judgement in Stone and Patricia Mazuy?s The King?s Daughters will be screened on February 7. The concluding day, February 8, includes Michael Haneke?s The Piano Teacher and Olivier Dahan?s Ghost River.

 From a shy lovestruck girl to a streetwalker, the romantic Madame Bovary to a sexually repressed piano teacher, the package reveals Huppert in her best.

 A missile misfires on a powerful aircraft carrier leading to one of the worst accidents in naval history. Two huge luxury ocean liners collide, jeopardising hundreds of lives on both ships. A regular morning turns gruesome as six bullets are fired, wounding an American president and three others.

 College alumni meet

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The 20th annual general meeting of St Xaviers College (Calcutta) Alumni Association was held on Saturday evening in the college auditorium.

 More than 2,000 members constitute the alumni association, which is three years shy of its 150th year.

 We have gone from strength to strength in the past 20 years. The members have grown in number and we have taken many bold initiatives. Unlike many alumni associations, we undertake several philanthropic activities, said Naresh Gupta, vice-president of the association.

 The meeting kicked off with the minutes of the last annual general meeting, after which the members were shown an audio-visual compilation of last years events.

 We started our Mumbai and Singapore chapters, besides hosting loads of social and cultural events in the city. At present, there is only one thing on everyones mind the second campus, which is coming up off EM Bypass, behind the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. If everything goes according to plan, the 17-bigha campus will be ready by 2010, said Imran Zaki, general secretary of the alumni association.

 Saturday also saw the re-launch of the website of the association and election of the members of the governing council.

 We now have a corpus of Rs 50 lakh. This will go a long way in supporting our social and philanthropic activities, added Zaki.

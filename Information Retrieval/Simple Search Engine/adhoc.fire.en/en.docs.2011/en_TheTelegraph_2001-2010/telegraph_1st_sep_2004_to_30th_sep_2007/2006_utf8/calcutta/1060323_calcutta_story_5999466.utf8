 Mixed bag, varied media

 - CELEBRATION OF SPRING

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An acrylic by Partha Pratim Deb

 The city?s dwindling Parsi community celebrated Navroz, or new year, on Tuesday. Gallery Katayun?s exhibition in celebration of spring opened on that very day. The artists are mostly young and have yet to make a name for themselves. The only notable exception was Partha Pratim Deb.

 This is a mixed bag of works by various artists using various media. Parag Roy?s is an assemblage of small canvases on the theme of Urban Fairytales. Here, things used every day are invested with a life of their own, underlining the fear factor in quotidian reality. A telephone receiver develops a menacing mouth of its own. A goat grows the head of a woman. Fish fly in a vacuum; it is a tiny but arresting piece.

 Tapas Kanti Mitra handles water colour with ease. He paints a large manor with a spectacular row of columns and a verandah with Rajasthan-style brackets, in a scene where shadows play hide and seek with light.

 The idea of using the head of a Kalighat pata courtesan in the buckle of a belt may be quite clever but this painting by Snehasish Maity is the outcome of wrong-headed ideas about post-modernism. Nabanita Javed?s large painting seems to be a throwback to the 60s and 70s, when psychedelic was the catchword of the day. But it looks like too much of an imitation to be of any interest to viewers.

 Atin Basak presents the head of a monk in saffron. This artist seems to be more at ease with printmaking than handling paint.

 The two small paintings by Partha Pratim Deb stand out by dint of their simplicity. A man stands alone in a field full of flowers. The background is uniformly dull and grey. The flowers are painstakingly smudged on the surface. Like most of this artist?s work, these stand out because he knows exactly what he wants.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Shake to Shakira, get high on Himesh 

 They make you move your 

 booty and rock your body. GoodLife got DJs 

 Vicky, Girish, Akash and Anshul to pick todays most 

 popular tracks. Here are the five final scorchers 

 (From top) Moments from 

 Phir Hera Pheri and Gangster; (below) Shakira

 Track: Ya Ali/Tu hi meri shab hai from Gangster.

 Artiste: Sung by Zubeen/KK, both the songs have been written by lyricist Sayeed Quadri.

 Genre: Commercial.

 Hot-o-meter: DJ Girish 

 says the track is a hit because it is a flashback for party 

 people to the Woh lamhe days. Adds DJ Anshul: However 

 empty the dance floor might be, these numbers from Gangster 

 ensure a packed house in less than 20 seconds. 

 Track: Hips dont lie.

 Artiste: Shakira. 

 Genre: R amp;B.

 Hot-o-meter: This 

 one is a sure-shot winner with all the ladies. Women are 

 absolutely crazy about it, whichever part of the country 

 they might be from, says DJ Vicky. 

 Track: Burn it up.

 Artiste: R. Kelly.

 Genre: Reggaeton.

 Hot-o-meter: It literally 

 burns up the dance floor, says DJ Anshul. Girish has 

 dubbed the track a rocking interlude to the 

 hugely popular Gasolina.

 Track: Yaad sataye teri from Phir Hera Pheri.

 Artiste: Sung by Himesh Reshammiya and remixed by DJ Akbar Sami. 

 Genre: Commercial (or is Himesh a genre by himself!). 

 Hot-o-meter: The 

 Himesh hangover, says DJ Akash. Period.

 Track: Kiss You.

 Artiste: IIO of Rapture fame.

 Genre: House music.

 Hot-o-meter: The 

 vocals are girlie and extremely enchanting. Top it with 

 a powerful baseline that sets off a progressive tone, and 

 this track is here to stay, points out DJ Girish. 

 Rapture is still fresh in peoples minds, helping Kiss You to move up, adds Vicky.

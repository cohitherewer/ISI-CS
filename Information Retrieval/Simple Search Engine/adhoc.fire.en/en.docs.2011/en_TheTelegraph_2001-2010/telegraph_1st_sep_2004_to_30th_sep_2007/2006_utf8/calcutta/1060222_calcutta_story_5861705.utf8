 Irish aid for rural 

projects 

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 Funds from the Irish government are proving to be the backbone of an initiative by Young Men?s Welfare Society (YMWS) to improve the quality of life in the rural areas of South 24-Parganas.

 The Irish government has donated Euro 28,000 to the NGO to pursue projects in the district. Kieran Dowling, Irish ambassador to India, was given a tour of the initiatives last week and was encouraged by what he saw. 

 ?It?s interesting to see the progress being made. A couple of generations ago, the rural parts of Ireland were in exactly the same condition that the rural regions of India are in now,? he commented.

 The 36-year-old city-based NGO started off with the aim to promote education as a route out of poverty. While education remains a primary focus, YMWS has broadened its sphere to encapsulate micro-financing for rural women and ensuring access to clean water.

 An ongoing project for YMWS is the installation of tubewells for safe drinking water. ?A real problem in the Sunderbans is the high salinity of the water due to the region?s proximity to the sea. One has to dig over 1,000 ft to find drinkable water. The tubewells we are installing last more than eight years and cost only Euro 160, which makes them worthwhile,? said Sourav Mukherjee, founding president of YMWS.

 On rural education, he said: ?Rural education is in a state of shambles. There are too many male teachers for the younger children, who prefer women teachers.?

 A savings and credit system for rural women has also been set up by YMWS to increase their financial independence.

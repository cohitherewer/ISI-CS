The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tax yoke on plex, mall

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Pay more for multiplex seats, pay less for mithai shops; pay more for tennis strokes, pay less for tech space; pay more for mall floor, pay less for education floor ? these were some of the highlights of the first Rs 10,000-crore-plus civic budget placed on Thursday.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has made access to sport and recreation facilities dearer in the Rs 1,158.41-crore Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) budget 2006-07.

 Justifying the hike in civic charges 

 in the recreation segment , the mayor said: ?Those going 

 to multiplexes or clubs can afford to pay a little more 

 for the facilities they enjoy. This additional money will 

 be used in slum development and essential infrastructure 

 work.?

 To carry this forward, Rs 3 crore ? against Rs 8.98 lakh in 2005-06 ? has been earmarked for the benefit of underdeveloped and backward areas.

 ?Any added levy is a burden. We need to understand if it?s justified or not, but we are here to comply and hope this serves a greater good,? said Ujjal, general manager, Forum.

 The reaction of Debashis Ghosal, MD amp; CEO, 89 Cinemas, was sharper: ?From Rs 4 to 100 per seat is absurd. We agree there has to be a revision, but it should be staggered. This is a crushing blow.?

 This found an echo on the tennis courts of Dakshin Kalikata Sansad, where secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee said: ?We already pay taxes for court, structure and the lease pact, besides amusement tax. This way, we can never produce any sportsperson in this city.?

 Far from the sporting arena, Bhattacharyya pushed the twin planks of education and IT. Building sanction fees for education structures have been halved, while the same for IT buildings has been slashed to one-third the present rate. Licence fees for the IT sector, sweet shops and the cottage industry have also been halved.

 ?It is a good sign for the IT industry, but care must be taken to ensure that this is not a stop-gap arrangement,? observed Santosh Rungta, vice-president, All-India Credai.

 One notable jump over the previous budget is Rs 50 lakh ? over Rs 4.98 lakh last year ? for beautification of parks and playgrounds.

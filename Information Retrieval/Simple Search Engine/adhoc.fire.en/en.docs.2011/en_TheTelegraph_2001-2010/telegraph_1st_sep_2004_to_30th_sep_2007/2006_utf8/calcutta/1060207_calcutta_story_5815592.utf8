 Bebo beats: retro amp; rocking

 Caked in chocolate or planting the kiss of coffee, Kareena Kapoor is always in the spotlight. She lets Pratim D. Gupta into her vanity van for a tete-a-tete

 Elusive or effusive, Kareena Kapoor doesn?t believe in half measures. Depending on how your stars shine on a given day, you can find Bebo at her monosyllabic best, playing every query with a dead bat, or see her go chatty-chatty bang-bang, throwing her bat at everything in sight.

 On Saturday, the location was the revamped Kamala Mills in Mumbai?s Lower Parel where Kareena is set to slip into the role of guest judge for Indian Idol 2. Learning that there?s just one journalist who seeks her time ? and space ? Kareena chose her make-up van parked outside the sets as the Q amp;A pitch.

 From the bright sunlight outside to the mellow shimmer inside the vanity van, all that is visible is Kareena?s side profile, glistening in the glaring bulbs bordering the mirror. The screen queen is almost made up but the ?almost? ? the lack of finishing touches ? allows just a glimpse of the natural beauty otherwise buried under piles of face paint.

 ?How have you been?? comes the greeting accompanied by a Kareena smile ? broad and bright ? and it?s heartening to know that the brief encounter more than a year back at an awards do in Dubai hasn?t gone waste.

 She faces herself again in the mirror and as her hairdresser continues to strategically place the rollers in her tresses, she waits to be questioned.

 Having been bombarded on the box with her bouncy (read: kinky) new commercial for Pepsi Cafechino, one can?t help but ask her about the kick-and-kiss act with Priyanka Chopra and a hapless male model for company. ?I belong to the Pepsi family and their coming up with a new flavoured drink was a great idea. The commercial was meant to be very glamourous. Priyanka, I have known for a long time and she is really sweet. Then, the ad was being directed by Farah Khan. So, it was like good friends having a good time.?

 The surprisingly ?sweet? words for Kareena?s Aitraaz co-star get sweeter. ?Have you heard Priyanka sing? She has a stunning voice and music is like a passion for her. Even though I have sung for Dev, I am not that great a singer. It?s always been just acting for me and that song was a one-off thing...?

 She does love music, though, even if it?s not the current variety. ?The 1970s were the best musical days when the likes of Shammi Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor used to dance away,? feels the youngest Kapoor in Bollywood. ?I feel a lack of such music today. You know, despite being in the 21st century and having all these innovations and technologies, we have not been able to match up to such legendary music.?

 But judging a musical talent hunt show like Indian Idol is something that falls into the charity bracket for Kareena. ?It?s a wonderful cause and I am absolutely honoured to be here. It?s such a big inspiration for all these singers who would get to see filmstars like us up close and personal. They would get to interact with us and good or bad whatever we feel about their singing, it will be like a form of progression for them.?

 Kareena has no qualms admitting that she doesn?t follow the popular Sony show. ?Last time, I liked Abhijeet Sawant the best. It?s sad though that only one person can become the winner. This time, I heard that some of the finalists have come from villages in Bengal and Bikaner. It would be sad if they have to go back empty-handed. Even though I have everything, I don?t want to go empty-handed! I am very sensitive in these matters ? I can?t see someone crying and all.? (Gulp).

 Does that make Bebo partial towards the underdog? ?I have always been like that. I speak from my heart and not from my head. Am I not known for that?? she looks straight into the eyes. An affirmation later, she starts lining her eyes, squinting every now and then, scrutinising herself intently.

 Desdemona to Don

 Music talk over, it?s time to talk movies. ?I am currently shooting for two films. There?s Vishal Bharadwaj?s Othello with Saif Ali Khan, Viveik Oberoi and Ajay Devgan, where I play Desdemona. I?ve a totally different look for the film. It?s a dream role and the moment I read the script I knew I had to do it. I am also shooting for a Harry Baweja film (Love Story 2050), where he?s launching his son (Harman).?

 But Kareena?s next release will be the Subhash Ghai production 36 China Town. ?It was great working with Abbas-Mustan again after Ajnabee. And then I have Shahid (Kapur) and Akshaye (Khanna) as the co-stars. It should release in summer? I also have a special appearance in Don.?

 Dear sister Karisma?s Mere Jeevan Saathi having hit halls, one asks for Kareena?s review. ?I haven?t seen the film,? pat comes the reply. Then, in a more serious tone: ?I don?t watch all movies.?

 A sudden knock on the van door means Kareena has to leave for the sets. That the hair still isn?t in place means another question can be popped. Wasn?t she aware that having chocolate all over herself (for a Lux campaign) was inviting another controversy after the MMS liplock? ?I thought it was a great campaign. Of course, I was wearing something inside. It was all very tastefully done.?

 But promoting the kiss of coffee in one ad and the full-bodied call of chocolate in another ? isn?t that a tad too much? ?I don?t believe there?s anything called over-exposure,? roars Kareena. Then the soft submission: ?Between the two, I do like coffee more.?

 The bittersweet chat came to a close as the world outside her van waited for another round of the Bebo beam.

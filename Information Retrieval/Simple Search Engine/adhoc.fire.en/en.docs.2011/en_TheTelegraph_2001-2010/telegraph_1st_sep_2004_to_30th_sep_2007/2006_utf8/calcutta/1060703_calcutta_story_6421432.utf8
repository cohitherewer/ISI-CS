The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hand of help from Japan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 From saying it with flowers to propping up primary education, poverty alleviation to pottery exhibitions, films and philharmonic ensemble ? the Japanese are reaching out with a bouquet of bridges.

 Even as the Mitsubishis and Itochus are working up steam to boost the industrial climate, succour for the city has come from another flank.

 The Grant Assistance for Grassroots Projects (GGP), a financial-assistance scheme offered by the Japanese government since 1989 for development projects in developing countries, has gained fresh momentum in the state.

 The grant is functional since 1989 and from fiscal 1992 to 2003, the consulate-general of Japan in Calcutta has disbursed money to 45 projects, of which 37 were in Bengal, according to vice-consul Akihiro Oikawa.

 The scheme supports projects implemented by NGOs, local government authorities and research and medical institutions legally qualified as a recipient of foreign funds.

 ?In Calcutta, we have been doing a lot of work in slums and fringe areas, which has intensified over the past five months,? Kanako Hayashi, development consultant and project coordinator of GGP, tells Metro.

 The grant has enabled NGO HelpAge India procure two hi-tech ambulance vans that function as mobile health clinics. GGP has also worked with Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, helping organise awareness programmes.

 ?We are working with Loreto Education Society of Sister Cyril, which has purchased two mobile education vans with the grant funds,? adds Hayashi. At La Martiniere, the grant supports computer classes and printing-technology training programmes for the urban poor.

 The grant funds are provided to the recipient organisation after an evaluation of each application by the Japanese government on an annual project-by-project basis. ?Sustainability of the project, financial strength of the partner organisation and domain knowledge are some of the key criteria,? says Oikawa.

 The amount of grant per project is generally under Rs 39 lakh. The major categories of GGP are projects supporting basic human needs like primary healthcare, primary and secondary education and adult literacy, safe drinking water and sanitation, prevention of HIV/AIDS, slum development and women?s empowerment.

 While he hopes the grant can support more development projects in and around Calcutta, the vice-consul also promises a vibrant showcasing of Japanese arts and culture in the coming months, including a film festival and a concert.

 Being part of the culturally conscious milieu, artists should ideally play a greater role in removing social disparities and working for the overall uplift and benefit of society. In a noble endeavour that promises to be the forerunner of more such efforts, a group of young painters has come forward to lend a helping hand to those less fortunate. Hosted by ITC Sonar Bangla, in association with Anubhav-Kolkata and Spandan Art Gallery, these artists are presenting a charity art show in aid of Anubhav-Kolkata, a home for underprivileged children. Featuring paintings that evoke our gentler emotions and arouse feelings of tenderness and compassion, the exhibition showcases the works of those who have specially created canvases for the cause of helping the less fortunate. Participating artists: Rana Roy, Subhro, Keshav Roy, Partho Bhattacharya, Avijit Dutta, Sukanto Das (one of his paintings appears above), Samir Paul, Gaurang Beshai and others. Inauguration this evening at 7.30.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by various artists

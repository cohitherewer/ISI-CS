 Food festivals, slogan writing contests, sports gear, mobile updates?its Theme Football everywhere. But does your TV corner, where you catch the 2006 FIFA World Cup action live, reflect the football fanatic in you? 

 While the furniture, curtains and floor cannot be tampered with just for a month, the trick is to accessorise the interiors the football way.. So get yourself soccer add-ons from Archies at City Centre and give your room a sporty makeover.

 To make it look warm and cosy, what better than cushions that look like club jerseys? The covers are synthetic and the cushions have sponge cotton stuffing.

 The cushions are flying off the racks. Not only do they look cool, they are value for money as they are washable and last long, says a store spokesperson.

 For Zinedine Zidane fans, its the white jersey cushion with a Real Madrid logo on the top right corner. The back reads jersey number 5 and Zidane, bold and clear.

 And if you are an ardent David Beckham loyalist, his jersey in white with the number 7 in blue could give you company. Iceland might not have qualified in the final 32, but girls going gaga over their blond skipper Gudjohnsen can comfort themselves with his Chelsea look-alike jersey in blue with number 22 written on the back.

 essandro Del Pieros Juventus club jersey in black and white along with the club logo finds place on the racks. For ardent Brazil followers, defender Roberto Carlos name features on a bright lemon cushion.

 Football-shaped polyresin piggy banks can be placed in corners. Track time with clocks that sport your favourite club names like Liverpool or Arsenal. For the complete effect, the cup replica in golden is a must.

 While all this gives your room the World Cup look, bands, watches and mobile holders help you gear up in soccer style. Wristwatches come with dials splashed with the names of various football teams and associations. 

 The one with the AFA logo ? of Argentina Football Association ? is in blue and the other with the FC Barcelona logo comes in an eye-catching combination of red and blue.

 If doses of tea and coffee are keeping you awake during late night matches, make sure you sip your hot drink right. Store the drink in steel flasks with team names on top and drink it from coffee mugs with the World Cup logo splashed on it. Replace water jugs with bottles boasting football replicas as caps.

 Mobile hangers read Arsenal and Juventus. Also available are towels, car pillows and wristbands with club names inscribed.

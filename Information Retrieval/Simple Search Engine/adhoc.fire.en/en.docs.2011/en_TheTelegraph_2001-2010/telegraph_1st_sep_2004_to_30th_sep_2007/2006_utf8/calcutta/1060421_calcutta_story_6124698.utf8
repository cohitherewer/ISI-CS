 STAR wars, on screen and off

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The beam battle involving broadcaster STAR India and city multi-system operators (MSO) Manthan and SitiCable saw shifting on the ground and shouting on the screen, on Thursday.

 Srishti, one of the largest master control rooms in the country, dumped Manthan and moved to CableComm, which is carrying the STAR feed.

 ?We were planning to move out soon, since we have plans to launch our own MSO. The ongoing trouble hastened that decision,? said Raj Narayan Roy Chowdhury of Srishti, which covers a large number of cable households in the Behala-Thakurpukur belt.

 While the beam baton changed hands in Behala, a recorded video, reportedly on behalf of aggrieved cable operators, presented the ?truth? about the STAR imbroglio to viewers of Manthan and SitiCable around the city.

 On Thursday, a video aired on Manthan and SitiCable urged viewers to rise against STAR?s injustice in demanding an ?unrealistic price hike?. According to operator sources, the video cassette was produced by a section of Mumbai-based cable operators protesting STAR?s direct-to-home launch and had landed in the city around six months back.

 The STAR bouquet of channels is off air on Manthan and SitiCable. While STAR switched off Manthan more than a month ago over a dues dispute, SitiCable blocked the STAR beam on Saturday, protesting the broadcaster?s ?high-handedness?. All three are locked in a tussle in the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal.

 Senior STAR officials had flown down to the city on Wednesday to present their version and push their case.

 What: 

 Superstar Fashion Night.

 Where: Venom, the nightclub 

 in Fort Knox, Camac Street.

 When: Friday night, 11.30 pm.

 The show: Knee-deep water at the Camac Street crossing or the festive feel gone damp could not stop the Calcutta party people from stepping or rather wading out on Friday night. Maybe they wanted to end an otherwise dull home-bound day on a high. Maybe they wanted to gape at stars Minissha Lamba and Upen Patel. Or maybe it was Provogues autumn-winter collection they wanted to see. Whatever the reason, the result was rocking, because the show was as much about fun as fashion.

 Minissha kickstarted the show in a sexy black empire-line dress before taking her place at the DJs console, next to choreographer Achla Sachdev, where she stayed put all evening. The first fashion sequence showcased denims and innerwear for men. Perfectly sculpted bodies flaunted a bare chest and a pair of denims, sporting an occasional neckpiece. The girls came up next in this round, also in denim jackets, jeans and tees.

 The second sequence, Colours and Prints, saw lots of graphic elements, florals and stripes, accessorised with wide metallic belts. The third sequence showcased Provogues sweater line jackets and pullovers for men and women.

 The fourth round on formal wear showed mens shirts in rainbow colours and the final sequence showcased party wear lots of shimmer and shine for the girls while men wore crushed silk shirts in solid colours.

 The showstopper, Upen Patel, made a filmi entry to the soundtrack of 36 China Town. Mr Hotbod did not disappoint as he flirted, shook and kissed hands, and also danced with an excited member of the audience.

 The choreography by Achla was fun and flirtatious. No straight walks, no stern faces, each of the models had a blast on the ramp. Dancing, a solo gig, with partners or with strategically planted poles sent the oomph element soaring. 

 Ramp scorchers: Mumbai imports like Aanchal Kumar, Candice Pinto, Shruti Agarwal, Muzammil Ibrahim (the catcalls for him drowned the music easily) mingling with Calcutta ramp regulars.

 Also spotted: Sourav Ganguly made a quiet entry at 9.30 pm. He then obliged photographers by hopping on to the ramp with models. He left early because of morning nets, only to be stuck in his Scorpio on sea street till being bailed out by Venom wheels.

 Voiceover: Calcutta is an important market for us. We plan to open five more standalone stores in the next two years, said Ajay Kulkarni, business head of Provogue.

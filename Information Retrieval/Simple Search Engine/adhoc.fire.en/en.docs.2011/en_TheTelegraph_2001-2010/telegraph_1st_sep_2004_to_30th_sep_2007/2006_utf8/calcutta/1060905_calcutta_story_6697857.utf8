 Skillset tips for sunrise industry

 - B-school, 

 retail major join hands

 The retail sector is one of the fastest growing industries in the country. But the manpower growth hasnt kept pace 

 To facilitate the growth run of 

 the retail industry, the Indian Institute of Social Welfare 

 and Business Management (IISWBM) has taken the lead to churn 

 out human resources for the sunrise industry. 

 The countrys oldest B-school 

 has joined hands with retail major Pantaloon Retail (India) 

 Ltd (PRIL) and has launched a two-year programme billed 

 as the first of its kind in this part of the country in 

 retail management. 

 This course has been designed keeping in mind the growing needs of the retail industry, for which the human resources need special skillset. We are partnering with 10 other institutions across India in order to initiate this special course in retail management, said a PRIL spokesperson at the launch of the new course. 

 The retail sector is one of the fastest growing industries in the country and has been consistently registering double-digit growth numbers for the past few years. But the manpower growth hasnt kept pace with that of the industry. 

 So, the main objective of the two-year, full-time management programme is to develop expertise in retail management by exposing the students to theories of general management, market research and various retail specific modules like floor designing and logistics. The classes will start from September 11. 

 As part of the programme, the students will also get on-the-job training in various Pantaloon outlets. Besides, they will have to take up three-month projects thrice during the two-year course, priced at Rs 2.5 lakh. 

 Students with a score of 45 per cent in three-year bachelor courses from any recognised university can sit for the admission test. 

 The response has been phenomenal We got around 450 applications and selected 60 students on the basis of performance in written test, group discussion and personal interviews, said Sudipa Banerjee, in-charge of corporate relations at IISWBM. 

 PRIL will have a strategic involvement in the running of the course and it will provide all sorts of technical support to the faculty members. The certificate for the course will be awarded jointly by IISWBM and Pantaloon Retail (India) ltd. 

 Besides banking on its partner, IISWBM is also gearing up to offer the best possible pedagogy in retail management. 

 We are recruiting new faculty members, who will focus on grooming the students to make them suitable for the retail industry. We are also going to bring in experts in retail management from all parts of the country, said Gairik Das, coordinator, postgraduate programme in retail management, IISWBM. 

 The students will not only learn the skills, the institute will also offer placement assistance. 

 The best part about this course 

 is that the interested students will get absorbed by PRIL 

 directly from the campus, said Banerjee.

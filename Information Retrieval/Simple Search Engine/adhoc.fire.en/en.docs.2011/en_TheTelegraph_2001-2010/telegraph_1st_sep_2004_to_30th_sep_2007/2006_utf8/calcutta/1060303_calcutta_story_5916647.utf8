 When like-minded artists come together and form a group for the study and exploration of art, it is bound to come up with fresh and innovative ideas of creative expression. Expression, the group formed by four such young and enthusiastic students of art, focuses on finding the essential truth of life through its manifestation in all creation: nature, animal and human. The ongoing exhibition of paintings by them is truly expressionist in nature, concentrating on the complexities of our inner world. Yet, the paintings retain clarity of thought and vision in their ability to appeal to the common viewer. Jayanta Khan?s simple visual idiom is powerful enough to contain several layers of meaning. The paintings of Sumita Paul (one of her paintings appears above) reflect an innocent charm that gives her works a soft, musical quality. Prasanta Acharya and Sudipto Sur portray reality as it appears to us in moments of trance or reverie.

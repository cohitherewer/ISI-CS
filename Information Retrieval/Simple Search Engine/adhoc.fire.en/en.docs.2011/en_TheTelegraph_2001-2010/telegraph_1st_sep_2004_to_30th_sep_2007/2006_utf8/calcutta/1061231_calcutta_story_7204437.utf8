The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Our fave five 

Screen On amp; Off

 THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE SMS VOTES. YOUR VOICE HAS, OF COURSE, EARNED PRIDE OF PLACE. HERE ARE OUR TOP PICKS IN ALL THE CATEGORIES

 Sexiest star

 The legs did it. From the swinging beauties against the Seoul skyline to the folded ones amidst the Goa greenery, KANGANA RANAUT rsquo;s legs stood out. Inhe zameen par mat utariyega, maile ho jayenge...

 Best song

 Yes Beedi gave us a kick and Ya ali a punch but no track could match what Rang De Basanti rsquo;s Luka chhupi did to us. It brought us home. Rahman kept his promise of reserving something special for Lata Mangeshkar every time. Whether it was Jiya jale in Dil Se or So gaye hain in Zubeidaa or Khamoshiyan in One Two Ka Four, the Rahman-Lata combo is definitely the best out there. If it catches the right ear, it might just pick up the Oscar

 Best actor

 The man breathed so much fire on screen, man, you could feel the heat sitting in the cool theatres. Saif Ali Khan rsquo;s Langda Tyagi was, without a flicker of doubt, the standout performance of the year. Not because he limped well. Not because he got the bhaiyya dialect right. Not because he used his lips and his cigarette, his tongue and his twang with such menace. But because the coy Chhote Nawab could come out from his palace and actually become a scheming scumbag from UP for Omkara. And to think an Italian was giving him company all the time!

 Best actress

 It was in Nagesh Kukunoor rsquo;s Dor that we realised why everyone from Naseeruddin Shah (Yun Hota...) to Anurag Kashyap (No Smoking) calls AYESHA TAKIA the most natural actress around. So what if the black magic woman refuses to kiss on screen or shed clothes? She sure has better things to do and, boy, does she do them well!

 Best film

 Vishal Bhardwaj rsquo;s OMKARA is 146 minutes of pure cinema. From performances and treatment to camera and music, this is Indian cinema almost as good as it gets. It might not have achieved box-office glory but neither did Pyaasa. Shakespeare reborn in UP, beedi jalaike!

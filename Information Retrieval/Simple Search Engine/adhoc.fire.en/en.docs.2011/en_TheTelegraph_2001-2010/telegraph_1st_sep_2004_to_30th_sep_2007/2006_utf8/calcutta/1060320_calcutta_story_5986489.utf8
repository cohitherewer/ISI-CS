The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Crushed in killer zone

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The stretch leading to Calcutta Leather Complex from EM Bypass turned into a death trap once again on Saturday night, after a youth, Khokan, was crushed by a Matador. His friend was seriously injured when the two-wheeler they were riding collided with the speeding van.

 Police, however, managed to intercept the killer vehicle and arrested the driver after a long chase, when a group of officers noticed the accident while patrolling the stretch.

 Police said Saturday?s mishap was a fall-out of twin factors ? reckless driving and poor visibility due to absence of streetlights on the stretch. 

 ?It appears that the duo did not notice the side of the road as the van driver kept focusing the headlights on them, instead of using a dipper. As a result, Khokan was blinded. The road here has a slight turn. There is no signboard mentioning ?turn ahead or drive slow? here, which is a big problem, especially at night as there are no streetlights,? an officer said. 

 The incident took place at Bamunghara in the Calcutta Leather Complex police station area ? the same spot where a Sumo skidded off the road and rolled into a roadside ditch, killing five on the spot.

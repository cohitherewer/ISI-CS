The city?s ever-expanding skyline just got a fresh boost with the entry of National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC), a public sector undertaking under the ministry of urban development, making its maiden entry into Calcutta?s burgeoning real estate industry with the residential project NBCC Vibgyor Towers, in Rajarhat.

 The foundation stone for the project was laid by Union minister for urban development Jaipal Reddy on Tuesday, in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 NBCC chairman-cum-managing director Arup Roy Choudhury said: ?Currently, the real estate market in Bengal is on a high, especially with the government playing a proactive role, and we feel this is the perfect time to make an entry.?

 7 plans to hand over possession of the 10-acre, 14-storeyed project within 33 months, and has further plans for the city. ?Rajarhat is getting ready to offer quality lifestyle through world-class infrastructure, along with very good residential and commercial properties. We plan to make bigger projects in the city as well,? said Roy Choudhury.

 Reddy lauded the rapid strides, but stressed that archaic civic bylaws must be modified. He lamented that though the Urban Land Ceiling Act and the state tenancy laws ?have outlived their purpose?, West Bengal still persisted with them.

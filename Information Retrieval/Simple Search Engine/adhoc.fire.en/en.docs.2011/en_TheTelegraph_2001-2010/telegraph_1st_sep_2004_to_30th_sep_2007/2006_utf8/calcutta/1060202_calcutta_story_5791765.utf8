The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Court boycott off

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 The stalemate in Calcutta High Court over the lawyers? decision to boycott Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar?s court was resolved on Wednesday. 

 The Bar Association will ?formally announce? the withdrawal of the boycott after the general meeting scheduled for Thursday.

 The stalemate, continuing since Monday, came to an end after a meeting between the association and the chief justice on Wednesday afternoon. 

 The lawyers decided to boycott the chief justice?s court following his refusal to meet association vice-president Bhudeb Bhattacharjee and other members. The association demanded that the chief justice express regret, which he did on Tuesday, but the lawyers claimed they had not received the letter.

 On Wednesday morning, association president L.C. Behani wrote to the chief justice, seeking an audience with him in his chamber at 1.40 pm.

 Three senior judges accompanied Chief Justice Sirpurkar at the meeting with association representatives. 

 ?The chief justice expressed regret and said the stalemate arose out of a misunderstanding. He said he never had the intention of insulting the association representatives,? said a member of the executive committee of the lawyers? body.

 The two-hour meeting also discussed various problems faced by lawyers. The delegation complained to the chief justice that litigants had to pay bribes to court officials to include their cases on the ?daily list?.

 ?The chief justice asked the delegation to write to the Bar Association secretary, identifying the officials who demand bribes. He assured us that the vigilance wing of the court would investigate the charges and the officials found guilty would be punished,? the member said.

 fusion

 Grub

 The 

 kitchen transformed itself into a greenroom. The chef doodled 

 on a design mood board. The models strutted their stuff 

 with a difference. They flaunted not just fashionable 

 silhouettes, but also pretty platters of designer 

 food.

 Atrium, the coffee shop at The 

 Park, unveiled its winter collection by executive 

 chef Davide Cananzi on Friday afternoon.

 Three sequences, short and sweet, 

 gave a glimpse of what to expect in Atrium this season. 

 The first sequence saw models Jesse Randhawa, Sanjana Tomar 

 and Anusha Chouhan, in black-and-white outfits, with crushed 

 silver foil as neckpieces and bracelets. They flaunted Oriental 

 Black Satin Chicken Drumettes, Farfalle al Salmone e Caviale 

 with Smoked Salmon, Caviar and Cream and Creole-style Stuffed 

 Suppli in Fried Papadam basket with Spicy Balsamic Reduction.

 The second sequence titled Mediterranean 

 saw some more colours both on the outfits and on the platters. 

 Assorted cold cuts, Parma Ham, Swiss-style cheese, submarine 

 sandwiches, Lobster Thermidor, Arugula Asparagus and Mushroom 

 Salad with Creamy Olive Polenta were the highlights of the 

 Mediterranean Collection. 

 The third sequence revolved around 

 desserts. Models in cream crochet sashayed around displaying 

 White Chocolate Mousse with Glossy Chocolate and Caramel 

 Sauce, Kids Special Jelly and Tropical Sundae. Then, 

 the show stopper: a chocolate girl smeared with 

 dark, gooey chocolate.

 The choreography by Meetu and 

 Meenu was relaxed, to go with the lounge-like 

 feel of an afternoon coffee shop show.

 The idea behind the launch of 

 the collection was simple: If the season can change 

 fashion, why not food, summed up Anirban Simlai, director, 

 food and beverage, The Park. The winter menu at Atrium boasts 

 a wide international selection, new pasta and 

 risotto sections, breakfast platters and variations in the 

 existing Clay Pot and Sandwich sections. 

 My three years in Calcutta 

 have taught me a lot about the citys demands. People 

 here love innovation, not necessarily fusion, and beautiful 

 yet simple presentation. My new collection incorporates 

 it all, signed off chef Davide.

 What: 

 Showing of designer Jattinn Kochhars club wear and 

 swimwear collection as part of the Fashion Police series.

 Where: Tantra, at The Park.

 When: Friday, post-midnight.

 The show: One would have expected a low turnout at a fashion show on the opening night of the World Cup. But the crowd at Tantra on Friday exceeded expectations. The nightclub was jam-packed with the crowd waiting eagerly and patiently past midnight to catch a glimpse of the beauties on the bartop.

 The show, timed for the break between two matches, displayed Delhi-based designer Jattinns spring-summer 2006 collection comprising club wear and swimwear. The show opened with a black line, with splashes of vermilion peeping through. The palette story moved forward with a dull blue line, then on to orange, saffron, brown and finally pale green.

 The silhouettes were skin-hugging, made from Italian lycra. The styles were simple, clean and smart. Short cocktail dresses and simple evening gowns formed the womens club wear line, while Neeraj, the only male model in the show, sported club shirts. One-piece bathing suits and bikinis for women, and square-cut and bikini-style swimming trunks for men made up the swimwear line.

 The highlight of the line was the extensive use of digital prints, with typical Indian motifs adorning the western silhouettes. Hindi scripts and Sanskrit shlokas in black were often splashed on red swimsuits and trunks. Image of a Rajasthani Maharaja was printed on cocktail dresses, gowns and mens shirts.

 Various regional embroidery forms like Phulkari from Punjab, Kutch from Gujarat and Jamevar weave from Kashmir were replicated through digital print. The prints were often highlighted with Swarovski crystals, metallic embellishments and hand-embroidered paisley patches.

 The collection drew a mixed response from the crowd. While some found the clothes smart and sexy, others felt they were too plain for designer wear.

 The clothes were showcased by models Jesse Randhawa, Candice Pinto, Angela, Sonalika Sahay, Tina, Amanpreet, Jessica and Neeraj. The choreography, done by Meenu and Meetu, saw a marked improvement from the rather amateurish catwalk of the last edition of Fashion Police in May.

 Two TV stars from Mumbai ? Aman Verma and Rohit Roy ? were quite a hit with the star-starved city crowd.

 Voiceover: The line draws inspiration from tribal hand-embroidery and craft forms of various states of India. Theres a bit of spiritual influence too, said Jattinn, who showcased in Calcutta after 10 long years.

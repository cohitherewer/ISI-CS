 Key boost to baby brain 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Studies have proven the efficacy of breast-feeding a child, as also the importance of the right nutrition inside the womb and outside, for a baby?s development. But not too many parents are aware of the vital role of docosahxaenoic acid (DHA) in building the brain of an infant.

 ?The first and most crucial source of that essential nutrient is mother?s milk,? stressed Tapan Kumar Ghosh, chairman of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Infectious Diseases chapter. 

 ?Seventy per cent of the human brain is developed inside the mother?s womb. The remaining 30 per cent occurs in the first three years. If the child isn?t provided the right nutrients, the effect is detrimental,? he added.

 DHA, a type of unsaturated fatty acid called Omega 3, is a primary structural component of brain tissue, found in breast milk and marine fish, among other food types. A DHA-deficient diet results in poor performance in school, apart from behavioural, neurological and vision problems.

 ?Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, temper tantrums, sleep disorders and sluggish behaviour are all effects of insufficient DHA in the child?s diet. Breast-feeding is essential for the first six months, with no artificial supplement. It is also important for the pregnant mother to have a DHA-rich diet,? explained Ghosh.

 ?Till age three, foods rich in DHA are a necessary part of the child?s diet,? added the consultant paediatrician and scientific coordinator of the Institute of Child Health.

 ?Intelligence, fitness and potential of a child can be optimised with the correct nutrition and environment. But a positive attitude of the parents is most important. Every individual is different, so comparing one child with another means permanently scarring the person,? Ghosh said.

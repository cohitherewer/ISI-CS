 Communication crisis

 Amazing advancement in technology has virtually brought the world within our fingertips, enabling us to surmount spatial boundaries and making us proud denizens of a global community. Yet, within this world without boundaries, we have created invisible barriers that prevent us from communicating with our loved ones, in spite of the proximity of our intersecting lives. Nisiddha Thikana laments this unfortunate trend in contemporary society. The play tells the story of a nuclear family, comprising a husband, wife and their only son. It shows us how children of the new generation suffer from insecurity and a feeling of rootlessness, which stems from their having been torn apart from their extended families. Leading cloistered, suffocating lives, they feel alienated even from their own families. Though ending on an optimistic note, the play raises questions of an existential nature, and is bound to provoke serious thought amongst a discerning audience. Direction: Kumar Roy.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Nisiddha Thikana, by Bohurupee 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

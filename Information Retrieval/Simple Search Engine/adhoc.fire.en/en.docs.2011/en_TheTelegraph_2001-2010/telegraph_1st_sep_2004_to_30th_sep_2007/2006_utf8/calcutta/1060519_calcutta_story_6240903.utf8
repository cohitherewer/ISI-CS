 Triple cry of torture rings in court

 - Senior citizens allege cop inaction against torment by sons for property

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 WHAT NOW? A still from a recent Bollywood film, Umar

 Three victims: two above 70 and one 90-plus. Common complaint: police turning a deaf ear to appeals for protection against torture by their sons and daughters-in-law.

 On Thursday, the trio, from addresses across the city, approached the high court for redress. 

 While hearing one of the pleas, Justice Girish Gupta, assigned by the chief justice to cases of cop inaction, observed: ?Police have failed to provide security to the citizens, especially the aged.?

 Gita Rani Biswas, 71, a resident of Garfa School Lane, under Purba Jadavpur police station, alleged that her second son Sanat and his wife were pressuring her and her unmarried daughter to leave the house. Gita?s husband died in 1997.

 According to her lawyer, Kunal Chatterjee, Sanat wants Gita and his sister to move to their ancestral home in Birati and has been torturing them to achieve his objective. 

 The angry judge said he would put Sanat and his wife behind bars if his mother had the same complaint after a couple of weeks.

 Kaushalya Mondal, 70, had faced similar pressure. ?My sons have forced me and my unmarried daughter to leave the house that my late husband owned. Even after repeated complaints, police did not arrest my sons,? cried the woman from Rajarhat in court.

 Prafulla Ghosh, 91, fell ill in court after travelling from Barasat for the hearing of his plea against his sons, who are allegedly forcing him to shift to an old-age home. Police, instead of acting on his complaints, have asked him to ?move out of the house?, his lawyer told the court.

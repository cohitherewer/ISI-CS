 Flat-owners victorious in rights fight

 PRASUN BHATTACHARYA

 Encouraged by a television talk show, flat-owners in a Howrah residential estate have moved the district consumer disputes redressal forum and obtained a verdict in their favour against the landowners and the promoter.

 Twenty-two families residing at Green Garden, in Salkia, filed a complaint with the Howrah Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in September last year, under the banner of Salkia Green Garden Residents? Welfare Association. 

 Their main grouse was the ?illegal activities? and ?violation of contract? of the landowners and the promoter. 

 ?We were tired of the illegal activities of the landowners and the promoter. One day, on television, I saw consumer affairs minister Naren De talking about various aspects of consumer rights. It suddenly occurred to me that we could move the forum against our tormentors,? said Pamela Sen, owner of flat B-303 in the estate.

 The association accepted Sen?s proposal and approached the forum. The allegations against the landowners and promoter included the complaint that they had only handed over 40 per cent of the estate to the flat-owners and had ?illegally? provided shelter to 22 families in the rest of the area. 

 ?The landowners were stopping the flat-owners from using the roofs. Open spaces meant for common use of flat-owners were being encroached upon. The main entrance had not been built and the common passage was being kept inaccessible. All these are violations of the contract,? pointed out Sukanta Kumar Banerjee, lawyer of the association.

 The forum found merit in the charges and passed a judgment in favour of the association on January 4.

 It directed the land-owners and promoter to clear the common passage and build the main entrance, not to encroach upon the common space or change the character of vacant land and give free access to the flat-owners of two blocks to the roofs for essential maintenance work.

 If the directions are not adhered to within three months, the forum ruled, the landowners and the promoter would have to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation to the complainants.

 The landowners have decided to move the state consumer disputes redressal forum.

 ?All allegations against us are baseless. We will move the higher forum,? asserted Prasad Chandra Paul, one of the landowners.

 ?I am ready to finish the remaining construction work, including putting up the main gate. The owners of the land are stopping me from doing so,? stated Manoj Jaiswal, a partner of Nav Niketan Construction, which built the estate.

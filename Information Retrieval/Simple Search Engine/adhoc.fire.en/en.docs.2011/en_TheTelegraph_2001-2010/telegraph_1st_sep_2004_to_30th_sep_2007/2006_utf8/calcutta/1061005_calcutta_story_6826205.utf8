 Meeting mantra for business boom 

Job woes

 - Conference 

 call 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Q: 

 I am starting a garment export business 

 with a friend. We would like to have a conference room in 

 the office. Kindly suggest where it should be located. Can 

 the north-west room be chosen for this purpose?

 Abhinay Suri

 THE SOLUTION: The best area for the conference room is in the north-east of the office. The ruling calm and serene energy of this area ensures productive outcomes for meetings that are filled with inspiration, creativity and wisdom. It brings out the best in everyone who sits at the table. 

 In contrast, the ruling movement of the north-west would interfere with the concentration of people attending the conference. This would result in unproductive meetings, which would affect your business.

 Feng Shui recommends that the conference room be built in the north-east of the office since this sector is ruled by calm and serene energy that ensures productive outcomes for meetings filled with inspiration, creativity and wisdom. It brings out the best in everyone attending a meeting

 Q: 

 I moved to a better company in April, hoping 

 for more job security in the future. But that is just not 

 happening; I am still confused and am always on the lookout 

 for a new job. Plus, whatever money comes is spent immediately. 

 I was born on January 28, 1966 at 12.32 am. The north-east 

 portion of our house is cut and our master bedroom is in 

 the north-west direction.

 THE SOLUTION: Your pillars of destiny reveal you are a weak fire person. Presently, you are under the influence of the wood element, which is providing you with a lot of support. 

 You should really do well in this period and I would advise you to stick to your present job. The next year shows a promotion in your job.

 Three elements of earth that represent your intelligence drain away your weak fire element resulting in a confused state of mind.

 To make things worse, your master bedroom is in the north-west sector, which is governed by a lot of movement. It disturbs your restless mind, which keeps wandering. 

 Please vacate this room and occupy either a bedroom in the south-west or in any other part of the house. 

 If you have no option of changing the room, then place a heavy boulder in the extreme north-west corner of the room to suppress the ruling movement of this area. 

 Install a light in the cut north-east portion of the house from outside to get back energy from the lost corner or place a large mirror on the internal north-east wall to create an illusion of space and depth. This is again a vital corner of the house that blesses you with mental peace and gods blessings. 

 Keep away from an earthy environment or the colours connected with it to give some peace to your mind. 

 Instead strengthen yourself with wood and fire elements and their associated colours green, red and maroon.

 Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon, the much-awaited lounge beauty stop near Maddox Square, opened its doors for Calcuttas fashionistas on February 4. Located at 78B, Sarat Bose Road, the one-of-its-kind salon by beauty expert Bridgette Jones spells luxury from the moment you step in. Spread over an area of 3,000 sq ft, Bridgettes dream venture is split into two levels.

 Salon service

 Splashes of bright canary yellow on the walls and furniture greet you as you enter. The ground floor boasts a nail bar, a hair cutting and colouring section, shampoo beds, spa pedicure and a kids station.

 The usual salon services are rendered a touch of luxury with bucket chairs for haircuts, massage chairs for spa pedicure, shampoo beds, where you can lie down and get your hair washed without having to strain your neck, and more.

 The spa pedicure chairs massage the neck and the back during the pedicure, while jets of water caress the feet. The feet are pampered with different types of pedicure like Dead Sea, Rose Petal and Aqua. The Mineral Line pedicure costs Rs 450, while the ordinary ones come for Rs 300.

 A hair cut starts at Rs 250 and streaking using Schwarzkopf colours costs Rs 950-plus. A hair spa is priced at Rs 450 and beyond. The nail bar specialises in nail art, with a combination of colourful motifs. This comes for Rs 100 per nail, including a manicure. A skin polishing session to reduce blemishes and dead cells is priced at Rs 450. The small but complete kids station offers the little ones services like mini manicure, mini pedicure and mini facial.

 The two exclusive facial rooms offer a host of exotic facials, starting from the regular herbal, priced at Rs 550, to aroma therapy, oxygenating and skin lightning that go up to Rs 1,200.

 Bridal best

 An ornate bridal room, done up in shocking pink and gold, is the real show-stealer of Bridgettes salon. Antique, carved, gold-leaf chairs and mirror frames set the tone here. The idea is to pamper the bride-to-be and make her feel like a princess on the eve of her special day, smiles Bridgette.

 The bridal package consists of the make-up, hair do, bindi and draping the wedding attire on D-day. It also includes a facial and consultation on skin, hair and body care in the run-up to the wedding. The package comes for Rs 6,500.

 Pamper pack

 I have lined up quite a few special treats for my customers, promises Bridgette. These come in the form of discount packages for different segments. Senior citizens or 60-plus women, for instance, can avail of a 20 per cent discount on all services.

 A Little Girls Day Out scheme offers special discounts for groups of three and above on services like facials, pedicure and nail art. A Mother and Daughter package offers a special discount on availing more than four services by a mother-daughter duo.

 Bridgette also hosts personal make-up classes that cover skin analysis, colour analysis, skincare grooming and training in regular and party make-up.

 Cafe corner

 The other highlight of the salon is a 12-seater cafe, done up beautifully in shocking pink and steel. The informal cafe boasts a menu of exotic coffees, herbal teas, home-made cookies and fresh popcorn. A newsboard displays information of events happening across the city as well as articles on beauty by Bridgette.

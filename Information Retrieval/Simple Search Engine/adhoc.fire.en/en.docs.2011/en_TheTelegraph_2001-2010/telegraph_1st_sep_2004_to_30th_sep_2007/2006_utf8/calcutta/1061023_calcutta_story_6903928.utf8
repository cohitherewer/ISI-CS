 Innovation is the mantra to success

 He has won over 30 awards for his innovative product designs in the past decade or so. 

 But for Bangalore-based Neil Foley, receiving the Reach for the Stars award on October 20 at the annual general meeting of The All-India Anglo-Indian Association and The All-India Anglo-Indian Education Institution at La Martiniere for Boys meant much more than the other honours bestowed upon him.

 The award is given every year to young and upcoming achievers in the Anglo-Indian community. The other awards focussed on my products. This one is community-driven. I definitely cherish it more, 33-year-old Foley smiled.

 The products that Foley designs range from the mundane, like cloth hangers and toothpick holders to hi-tech, like head-mounted television and luxury buses. But his USP is his practical approach and simple designs, many of which are inspired by nature.

 Since most of my clients are large manufacturers, one of the prerequisites for the design is to be mass produce-able and cost effective. At the same time, my designs are true to the user. Whether it is a simple product or a complex kitchen appliance, I put in equal amount of effort, in styling, detailing and manufacturing, pointed out Foley, who spearheads many design projects at Titan Industries, besides freelancing under his brandname Neil Foley Designs.

 One of his innovations, Bio Bin, won the Metropolis Next Generation Big Idea International Design Competition 2004 in the US. Besides, his designs for the Titan FasTrack sunglasses have been quite a rage. One of his bicycle designs won a prize in the 9th International Bicycle Design Competition 2004 in Taiwan. 

 In India, Foley admits, product designing is at a nascent stage. Fashion designing is well-known here probably because of the glamour attached to it. It would take six to eight years for a product designer to get a foothold in the industry.

 Portrait of a young Pinter

 When Harold Pinter won the Nobel Prize for literature in October last year, one of the first people to hear the news was Thea Sharrock, the young artistic director of the Gate Theatre. 

 The Gate is traditionally home to international theatre, but Sharrock decided to fete the newly anointed laureate with a revival. Having worked with the playwright as assistant director on Peter Hall?s production of Betrayal in 2003, she duly proposed to him a double bill of less frequently revived plays. Pinter acceded. 

 After reading the collection, she alighted on A Kind of Alaska, premiered at the National in 1982, and A Slight Ache, first performed as a radio play on the BBC?s Third Programme in 1958 and produced on stage three years later at the Arts. The double bill will be called In Celebration of Harold Pinter.

 His shorter plays have been yoked together in various combinations, but this particular coupling had never occurred to Pinter. 

 ?It did strike me that the central characters in each play, which are totally different, nevertheless have one thing in common. They are both under great stress one way or the other. And in one way or the other they have to accept their fate, their destiny. However much they fight against it, I?m afraid fate wins in the end,? says Pinter, after watching a run-through of the production.

 Written in response to Oliver Sacks?s Awakenings, A Kind of Alaska dramatises the moment a middle-aged woman, like one of Sacks?s case studies, is awoken by injection believing she is still 16, only to discover that she has been asleep for 29 years. ?I read it again,? says Sharrock, ?and thought, this is completely heartbreaking, which is quite an un-Pinterlike emotion. But A Slight Ache was the one that really struck me as dark and difficult and about such fundamental things.?

 It is famously a rule of thumb that you don?t ask Pinter himself what his plays are about. Nonetheless, he reveals that the idea for A Slight Ache came to him when a memory reared up from his childhood.

 ?It had something to do with the period when I was evacuated in the War in about 1944,? he says. ?I went up to King?s Lynn and I stayed in an old rectory, as far as I remember, with a couple, and they had lots of flowers. It was a totally different life. I?d never seen anything like it. It left a great impression on me.?

 A Slight Ache duly opens with a couple discussing the flowers in just such a country garden, but before long their attention is drawn to the mysterious presence of a bedraggled match-seller standing sentry outside the gate. The husband invites him in and initiates a disturbing conversation in which the catatonic guest says not a word.

 Perhaps not uncoincidentally, Pinter was himself under great stress when he accepted the commission to write A Slight Ache. ?I?ll never forget it,? he says. ?I was totally broke and really dispirited because my first professional production of The Birthday Party had gone on in 1958 and was a total disaster. It came off in a week at the Lyric Hammersmith. I had absolutely no money and I didn?t know what the hell was going to happen. My first wife and I had a newborn baby. We were living in absolute poverty. 

 ?And suddenly the Third Programme in the guise of Donald McWhinnie invited me to come and see him and said, ?Look, why don?t you write a play for us?? I think he said, ?I?ll give you ?30,? which was a fortune as far as I was concerned. I said, ?Oh fine, I?d love to.? I went away and I wrote A Slight Ache.?

 Last year Pinter suffered a far from slight ache himself. A rare throat disease brought him to within five minutes of death, and kept him in hospital during an all-star staged reading of his play Celebration in the West End in December. He was taken to and from hospital to record his coruscating anti-American acceptance speech for the Nobel ceremony. 

 Is the playwright aware of inspiring a certain awe? ?No, it doesn?t occur to me. I don?t think they are in awe at all.? In the original radio production, the part of the wife in A Slight Ache was played by Pinter?s own wife, Vivien Merchant. And though not cast as the husband, the playwright himself was put to work in the recording studio. ?I played the silent character on the radio,? he recalls. ?Very demanding.?

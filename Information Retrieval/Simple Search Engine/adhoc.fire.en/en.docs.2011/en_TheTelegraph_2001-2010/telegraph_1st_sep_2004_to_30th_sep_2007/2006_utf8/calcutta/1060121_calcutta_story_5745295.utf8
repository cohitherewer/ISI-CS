 Surgery way out of extra weight woes

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Regular aerobics, a daily six km run and a low-calorie diet for a whole year only left Aatreyee Eitland 20 kg heavier, and with diabetes and hypertension. After a visit to Calcutta for treatment for her obesity, she is now looking forward to a healthier life.

 Eitland, in her mid-thirties, weighed more than 90 kg before she underwent a special laparoscopic obesity surgery at AMRI Hospitals recently. ?The lap band surgery is suitable for people whose excess weight is more than 40 kg,? said V.K. Bhartia, who led the team of doctors who performed the surgery.

 While the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) is popular across the world, it is quite rare in India. 

 The procedure helps the patient lose four to five kg in a month. The normal weight can be achieved in just 18 months, doctors said.

 Problems started for Eitland two years ago, when she went to a doctor in the US for surgery. ?The doctor told me that I am 10 kg overweight. I started exercising but kept putting on weight,? recalled the US-based painter. 

 Last year, she discovered that she was 20 kg above the normal weight for her height. She had also developed diabetes and hypertension. 

 ?The doctors in my country said I was not yet ready for surgery, but things were becoming difficult for me,? she said. Just a week ago, she came down to Calcutta, after contacting Bhartia over phone from her hometown.

 ?There are about 50,000 people in the city who are morbidly obese. They, too, can benefit immensely by the lap band surgery,? Bhartia pointed out. 

 In this method, a hollow silicone band is placed around the upper part of the stomach, creating a small pouch that can hold only a small quantity of food. The narrowed opening between the stomach pouch and rest of the stomach controls the speed at which food passes from the former to the latter.

 Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass (LGB) is an alternative to lap band surgery. 

 In this procedure, a section of the stomach is removed or sealed off, limiting the capacity of food it can hold. The LGB involves creating a small pouch by dividing the stomach. The small intestine is divided and joined with this new pouch. This forces food from the stomach pouch to move to the small intestine, bypassing the lower stomach.

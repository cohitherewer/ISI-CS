The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Enjoyment agenda at traffic park

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A playground for kids, a small stadium, an earthen ramp and a sprawling open space dotted with greenery. If you think it?s another housing complex, think again. The traffic police are set to build a park with all these facilities, where people can pick up the basic road rules in a relaxed atmosphere. 

 The proposed Traffic Park would come up on the Tallah Park premises, in north Calcutta. It will be designed to draw children with the promise of fun and merriment, and instil in them a respect for road rules while they enjoy themselves.

 The state government has sanctioned Rs 45 lakh for the project and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been entrusted with the responsibility of executing it. 

 ?We want the kids to imbibe a sense of traffic discipline so that when they grow up, they have an idea of what to do on the road. It makes sense to help children pick up the basics so that what they learn stays with them. At least, they should know what is a zebra crossing and a stop line, and when to cross the road,? said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 According to the plan, the park will house two traffic department offices, a plush canteen for the officers and those taking part in the training programmes and a small stadium for conducting the training.

 There will be roads cutting through the greenery, where children would be able to ride bicycles or take training cars for a spin. The park would be brightly illuminated to make it more attractive.

 ?We want to redefine the concept of a park by introducing elements that would make ours attractive for both the youngsters and the grown-ups. In keeping with this objective, we have decided to build an earthen ramp, where visitors might sit and watch the training sessions,? stated Debdas Bhattacharya of the CMDA?s traffic and transportation department.

 ?We would have started the work right away but for the restrictions due to the Assembly elections. Tenders for the work would be floated soon. It shouldn?t take us much time to deliver the work,? he added.

 Once the park is ready, the traffic training school would be relocated there. It is currently a part of the Police Training School. The shift is likely to facilitate the training of drivers of both heavy and light vehicles who are ignorant of the basic road rules.

 If required, the participants would be offered accommodation for the duration of the training. In addition, there will houses for senior traffic officers on the campus.

 To ensure more involvement, competitions for kids would be a regular feature at the park.

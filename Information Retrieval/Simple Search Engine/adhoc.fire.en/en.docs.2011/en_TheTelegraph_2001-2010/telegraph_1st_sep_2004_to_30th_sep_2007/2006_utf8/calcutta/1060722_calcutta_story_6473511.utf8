The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hang-out zones on security overdrive

 Malls like City Centre, in Salt Lake, are easy targets of law-breakers because of their sprawl. A Telegraph picture

 *Forum, on Elgin Road, has a weekday footfall of over 12,000 and weekend footfall of 20,000-plus

 *The weekend footfall at 89 Cinemas is 4,500

 *Venom, in Fort Knox, has a Saturday night footfall of 650 

 Malls, multiplexes and nightclubs are mushrooming in the city and Calcuttans are thronging there by day and by night. But the recent serial blasts in Mumbai have raised the spectre of terrorist strikes on these prime party spots.

 Responding to the threat perception, security measures have been tightened, and even recast, at all these hang-out zones. The authorities are aware of the inconvenience caused to customers, but plead helplessness in view of the rising risk factor.

 ?We have stepped up vigil in the hotel in general and Underground, our nightclub, in particular,? said Vinay Jaiswal, director (operations), Hotel Hindusthan International. ?All cars are being checked with down-mirrors. Everybody entering the discotheque and the belongings are being screened. Our security manager has all the emergency numbers.?

 In Tantra, at The Park, security has been beefed up and everyone is being frisked.

 The malls of the city, too, are leaving nothing to chance. Closed-circuit cameras have been installed and private securitymen are ?keeping an eye? on the premises.

 ?The malls are easy targets, as they are spread over a large area, monitoring every corner of which is difficult,? said Subir Das, deputy manager, Forum. ?All dustbins at Forum are checked at regular intervals. Once a day, personnel from the special branch of the city police inspect the entire compound, including the remote corners. Closed-circuit cameras scan the whole area and our security staff keep a tab on people on all floors.?

 The plexes, where footfall runs into thousands, are not lagging behind in upgrading their security parameters. 

 ?We?ve always been extra careful as far as our security is concerned,? said Prashant Shrivastav, vice-president, 89 Cinemas. ?People pass through electronic screening and are also physically frisked. In the past, many of our patrons had raised objections, but we did not slacken security. After the blasts, all our securitymen have been re-briefed.?

 Off the record, however, everyone admits that it is almost impossible to have a foolproof safety system. ?If somebody is out to disrupt peace, there is little we can do,? said a spokesperson for a mall.

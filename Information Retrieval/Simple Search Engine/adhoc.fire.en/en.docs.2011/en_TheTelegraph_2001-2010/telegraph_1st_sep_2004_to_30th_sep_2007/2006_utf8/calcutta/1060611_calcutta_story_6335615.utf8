The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mission, slow 

 and steady

 The 30-second strip that tries to 

 change our mind, bit by bit

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 This 

 was many decades back. One of our precious but rare escapades 

 from college had taken us to Park Street. This was a little 

 after what in the commercial world is known as lunchtime. 

 For us it was simply the period when ?AKC? took his class. 

 A friend had promised a treat and there we were in Olympia. 

 A bottle of beer split among five of us was the main attraction. 

 The next hour-and-a-half was bliss. Each one of us got drunk 

 ? more on the excitement than the peg or so of the brew 

 that we could indulge in.

 It is then that we noticed the 

 couple of men at the table next to ours. One of them was 

 drinking a colourless liquid and smoking the then ubiquitous 

 Wills Filter, the ?made for each other? brand that we all 

 aspired to smoke but could not afford. His attire was smart 

 and the piece de resistance was a flashy tie. He was the 

 animated speaker at their table; his companion was a mere 

 listener who kept smiling and nodding his head. Even at 

 that raw age, barely a year-and-a-half into college, we 

 knew that this man had to be in advertising.

 Over the years, this image of 

 advertising ? a profession of flashy ties and mid-day cocktails 

 ? has substantially changed. The very size of the industry 

 (a few thousand crores annually) now evokes respect. Yet 

 the output of the industry still carries a hint of levity. 

 Arguably the most common image we have of advertising is 

 an attractive drama on television that entertains. Often 

 that is what the doctor orders. There is no sinister plan 

 to brainwash. The brief is: earn love not respect, create 

 illusion rather than knowledge. The ads thus go only up 

 to flimsily dressed models, exciting graphics, great punch 

 lines. They have no ulterior motive. Maybe such ads are 

 in majority; the perception of flashy ties and mid-day cocktails 

 thus lingers, one way or the other.

 As audiences, we get used to them 

 so much that it becomes difficult to distinguish between 

 cocktails and mocktails. There are ads that look the same. 

 For them it is a tough pretence. We are engrossed in the 

 theatre on display, when actually all the while the 30-second 

 strip is trying to change our mind, slowly and unobtrusively.

 There is one such campaign that 

 is currently on air. It may not feature in the top of the 

 pops for many people but it is pregnant with a task that 

 is path-breaking. I am talking about the campaign for Fastrack 

 watches from Titan. The current one, many would recall, 

 is a sequel. In this ad, instead of a college boy with a 

 Fastrack watch being swooned over by girls, the gender equation 

 has been reversed. This time the girl with the coveted watch 

 is being fawned over by her male classmates because of her 

 watch. The format is the same, a comical, almost unreal, 

 presentation of a slice of college life. Both campaigns 

 proudly demonstrate the attractive range that Fastrack has. 

 The punch line is the same: How many do you have?

 My father spent most of his student 

 days proudly wearing my grandfather?s gold-plated watch. 

 I myself do not remember when I bought my current wristwatch. 

 In any case, these days when I need to check the time, I 

 prefer my mobile to my wrist. This is what makes this effort 

 from Titan truly titanic. It is converting a watch from 

 a mere timekeeper to a fashion accessory. The peak is lofty, 

 multiple purchases by a single consumer, all changing as 

 per the flavour of the season. Thus, repeat buying on a 

 scale hitherto unimagined should result. Eventually, GeneratioNext 

 will move towards a wardrobe of Fastrack watches.

 This ad has a mission. And in 

 equine terms the mission is not a 1,000-m sprint but a 12-furlong 

 Derby.

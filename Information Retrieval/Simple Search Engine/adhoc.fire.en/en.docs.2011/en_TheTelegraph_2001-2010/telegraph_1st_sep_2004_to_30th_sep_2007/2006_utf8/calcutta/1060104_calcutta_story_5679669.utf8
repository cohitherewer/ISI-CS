 We Ask You Answer

 Prince will rise from ashes

 Today?s question: Which Calcuttan in your view will be the one to watch out for in 2006? More responses will be published next week

 Payel Bhattacharyya, 

 Joka

 Bengalis in general will do well in the coming year, but my eyes will be on Sourav Ganguly. Last year was bad for him but I have great faith in his ability to shine in 2006. Who knows, the captaincy crown could be back on Maharaja?s head.

 Tuhin Purkaystha,

 Sourav Ganguly will be the one to watch out for in 2006, especially because he is back in the team. Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see how he performs in Pakistan. May Sourav return to his old form.

Kajal Chatterjee,

 Sodepur

 The Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006 is Sourav Ganguly. Last year saw the humiliation of India?s greatest captain and one of the best ever batsman by the coach, selectors and media. Sharad Pawar?s victory in the board elections has ensured justice for the favourite whipping boy of Indian cricket. We will eagerly wait to see whether Ganguly once again forces his critics to eat their words or succumbs to the pressure.

 Obviously Sourav Ganguly. Given the events of the last few months, all eyes will be on the erstwhile skipper during the Pakistan tour. His lone battle on the 22 yards will determine the future of his career.

Kalyan Ghosh,

 Park Street

 The only name that comes to the mind is of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. He has shown a lot of foresight and vision. His handling of sensitive issues like foreign direct investment in retail, improvement of industrial climate and his efforts to make Calcutta an IT hub are proof of his statesmanship. The way he has persuaded his belligerent colleagues to tread the path of reforms speaks volumes about his ability. Calcutta is definitely a city on the move under his leadership.

 Suparnaa Sinha, 

 Motilal Nehru Road

 Mamata Banerjee is the Calcuttan to watch out for in 2006. The Assembly election is round the corner and Bengal is eagerly waiting for a change of guard. A lot would depend on Mamata, who is a representative of the masses.

 Moumita Nandi,

 Behala 

 In 2006, my focus will be on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the police minister. I ardently hope that he and his comrades come up with a plan to make Calcutta safer. To strike at the root of cop corruption should be his primary duty. 

 Subhankar Chakraborty,

 Agarpara

 I think Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be in the limelight because of the Assembly elections in West Bengal. It will be interesting to observe how the chief minister keeps at bay his opponents in the party and advances his industrialisation agenda.

 Arunava Bose Chowdhury,

 Barrackpore

 I believe our chief minister will be the cynosure of all eyes this year. As the Assembly election is round the corner, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is expected to increase his efforts at attracting foreign investment. As these steps are going to lead overall betterment of the state, Bhattacharjee?s farsightedness must be appreciated.

 Dipro Ray,

 Beniapukur

 My pick for the Calcuttan of 2006 is Rituparno Ghosh. This immensely talented director has received enough flak for Antarmahal, and is ready to bounce back with Dosar and Khela. 

Arpita chowdhury, 

 East Sinthi Road

 The Calcuttan of the year will be none other than Sourav Ganguly. He is the most suitable representative from Bengal in the arena of international sports. The Prince of Calcutta will make his second comeback during the year. Consecutive centuries had marked his first comeback in 1996. Let?s see how his willow speaks out against all the humiliation heaped on him last year.

 Arindam Basu,

 Saptagram

 A lot of noise has been made over the bad patch that Sourav passed through in 2005. Several seized the opportunity to launch vitriolic criticism against him. But I am confident in Sourav?s ability to turn an adverse situation into a favourable one. No other Calcuttan faces a tougher battle, and hence no one?s ascension would be as sweet.

 Tuli Das,

 Salt Lake 

 Film-maker Rituparno Ghosh is definitely the Calcuttan to watch out for this year. He will continue to utilise his talents and enchant us in 2006 and beyond.

 Indranil Sanyal,

 Dhakuria 

 Given the chance to play freely, Sourav Ganguly will be the one to watch out for in 2006. He has become a cornered tiger and is raring to roar again. The serieses against Pakistan and England will mark his return to triumphant ways.

 Joydeep Chatterjee,

 Shyambazar 

 Without doubt Sourav Ganguly is the one to watch out for in 2006. The fate of his career will depend on his batting in the coming months.

 Sujit De,

 Sodepur

 It will be Sourav Ganguly?s year all the way. His flashing blade will show what Bengalis are capable of in the face of injustice. The Prince of Calcutta will rise from the ashes and have the last laugh.

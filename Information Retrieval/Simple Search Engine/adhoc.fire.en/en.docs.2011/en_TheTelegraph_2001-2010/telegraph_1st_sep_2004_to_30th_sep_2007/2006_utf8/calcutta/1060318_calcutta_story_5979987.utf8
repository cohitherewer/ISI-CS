 Calcutta High Court on Friday wondered whether the state administration?s move to erase wall writings would not further deface public and private properties across the city.

 ?You say your government is erasing the wall writings very quickly. Can you assure us this will not further deface the buildings?? Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar asked advocate general Balai Ray while hearing a public interest litigation demanding immediate removal of graffiti.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Tech terror in movie mode 

 Bringing back the Gadar pair of Sunny Deol and Amisha Patel, producer-director HARRY BAWEJA tells Pratim D. Gupta how to negotiate the Teesri Aankh 

 Amisha Patel and Sunny Deol in moments from Teesri Aankh ? The Hidden Camera, to release this FridayHarry Baweja 

 What is Teesri Aankh ? The Hidden Camera all about?

 Teesri Aankh is not about mythology, it is about technology. We are not talking about Shivji?s third eye but the spy and mobile cameras jo har aadmi haath mein leke ghoom raha hai. While there have been several incidents in the country, I was particularly inspired by this newspaper report on how some girls in Pune were secretly filmed by their tenant.

 Having made masala movies like Qayamat and Main Aisa Hi Hoon, why did you take up such a theme for your new film?

 For some time now, I was wondering what would my leading man Sunny Deol fight for next? Not Pakistan, it?s a different scenario now. Not terrorism, we have got sick of it. So, the hidden camera is his new enemy. The way it is attacking women, in hotels, in changing rooms, in malls. They are not bothered with the religion or caste or colour of the women, whether they are poor or rich, they are just being victimised for no reason. And don?t we all have women in our homes? Mothers, sisters, daughters, wives? anyone can be targeted any fine day.

 How have you turned this grim theme into a commercial potboiler?

 We have camouflaged this very contemporary message with entertainment and thrills. So, we have the likes of Mukesh Rishi and Mukesh Tiwari as the conspirators while the victim is played by Neha Dhupia who is a very normal girl, ambitious enough to live life on her own terms. The witness of the crime is Amisha Patel who is mute and is basically a timid girl. The baddies want to get their hands on her. We have Ashish Chaudhary and Aarti Chhabria as a couple in distress and finally Sunny Deol is our saviour.

Which elements of the technology menace have you highlighted in the movie?

 The MMS bug is very easy to show. Then we have shown what happens in the changing rooms during a fashion show. Then there are spycams hidden in hotel rooms. We have tried to show all kinds of problems but not gone on to explain the modus operandi since it is meant for family viewing. So, everything is suggested to send that shudder down your spine.

 Are you trying to look at solutions too?

 The solution we have given is to finish the menace inside us before looking outside. As Sunny?s character says in the movie, we have to get to the root of the problem. Why do you still kill off girls at birth? Why do we still take dahej (dowry) during marriage? The thekadaars of the society are people like you and me and we are the real culprits. We have to clean our home first before cleaning up society.

 Don?t you feel Sunny Deol is past his prime and won?t be able to bring in the audiences?

 Just because he hasn?t had a release for the last 10 months or so doesn?t mean that Sunny is past his prime. Just because his last release Jo Bole So Nihaal didn?t become a hit doesn?t mean he won?t be able to bring in the audiences. He has his own audiences. The music of my film has already become a rage in the north and the audiences have been lapping up the trailers so much that I have had to send more trailers to the theatres. Before Qayamat also, people had said that Ajay Devgan was over but the film became a huge hit. It all depends on the kind of product you are making.

 What about Amisha Patel? Will she be able to do a Rani Black Mukherjee?

 Amisha?s done a wonderful job. She did need to speak in sign language in parts of the film and we had a tutor on the sets. But she didn?t need to talk in sign language all the time because then the new people she is meeting wouldn?t have been able to understand what she is saying. So, Amisha has combined sign language and histrionics to communicate in the film. That?s a bit different from Rani?s portrayal.

 Have you been able to re-ignite the Sunny Deol-Amisha Patel chemistry of Gadar ? Ek Prem Katha?

 See, Teesri Aankh is basically the story of one night while the rest is told in flashbacks. So, the relationship that Sunny and Amisha share is more of an unsaid one. It is a very emotional bonding. Hope the audience can see that subtle chemistry between the two.

 After Teesri Aankh you are launching your son Harman in Love Story 2050. Why did you drop Kareena from the movie?

 We parted ways amicably because of date problems. It is a sci-fi film and we are flying down lots of Hollywood technicians for the shoot. Now, if these Americans sit idle for 10 days, I will have to bear her cost. So, with Kareena doing this film and that film, we had to part ways. I can?t shift a day for Love Story 2050.

 And Priyanka Chopra?s replaced her?

 No, she has not. I have been so busy with Teesri Aankh that I haven?t been able to decide on the replacement. It?s a big film and we have to be sure about the casting. God willing, Harman will be the next big thing in Bollywood.

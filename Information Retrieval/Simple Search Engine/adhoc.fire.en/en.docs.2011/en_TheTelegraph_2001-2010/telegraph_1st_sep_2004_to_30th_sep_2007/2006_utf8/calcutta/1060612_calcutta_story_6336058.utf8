 Cheat slur on realtor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An elderly couple of Taltala has lodged a police complaint of cheating against a realtor with alleged Trinamul Congress backing.

 Jayati and Mrinal Ghosh have alleged that they had paid Rs 3.8 lakh to Gautam Dasgupta and booked a flat in Entally in February 2004. The rest would have to be paid before taking possession of the flat, which, Dasgupta promised, would be ready in eight months.

 But the couple has neither been handed over the flat nor returned the amount.

 ?Dasgupta showed us a site where he said he would build a three-storeyed building. We paid Rs 3.8 lakh as the first instalment. He was supposed to hand over the flat in October 2004,? said Jayati Ghosh, a retired school teacher.

 A month after the payment, the couple came to know that the plot belonged to a businessman, who denied having any plan to build an apartment block on it. 

 ?The next day, we met Dasgupta and asked for the money. He told us to wait,? she added.

 After much persuasion, Dasgupta paid the couple Rs 2 lakh. ?But he is not returning the rest, saying he would arrange a flat for us in the same area. We refused. He has been threatening us with dire consequences if we dared to lodge a complaint,? Ghosh said.

 V.K Bhandari, additional officer-in-charge, Taltala thana, said: ?We have asked the promoter to return the money to the couple.? 

 When contacted, Dasgupta admitted having taken around Rs 4 lakh from the couple. 

 ?I have paid them Rs 2 lakh and will return the rest soon. My political adversaries are trying to make an issue out of it,? he said.

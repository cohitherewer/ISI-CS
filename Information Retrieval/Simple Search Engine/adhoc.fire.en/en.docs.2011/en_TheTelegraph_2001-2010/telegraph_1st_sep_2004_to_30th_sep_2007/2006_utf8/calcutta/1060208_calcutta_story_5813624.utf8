 Today?s question: Should sale of products other than books be allowed at the Book Fair? More responses will be published next week

 Books, what books? The palate rsquo;s the thing in the food court at the Book Fair. Picture by Pradip Sanyal

 Pintu Kumar Shaw,

 Christopher Road

 Never. Because the Book Fair is the only one of its kind and is held only once a year. Fairs of other products, in contrast, are organised more often.

 Ashis Kumar Bhowmick, 

 VIP Road

 Sale of products other than books might be allowed at the Book Fair. However, stalls for the other products should be set up in a separate enclosure. The people who visit the Book Fair from faraway places must be provided an opportunity to refresh themselves on the fair ground at a nominal cost.

 Sale of products other than books should be allowed at the Book Fair. Food, painting and handicraft are the other items on sale at the Book Fair. Over the past few years, CD-ROMS and computer peripherals have also made their entry into the Fair. Sale of these products should not be stopped.

 Sunil Banerjee,

 VIP Road 

 Sale of products other than books should not be allowed at the Book Fair. Since the fair is named after books, infiltration of other products is neither desirable nor ethical. Book-lovers will be deprived if the authorities are not strict.

 Though there?s a case for permitting food stalls to be set up on the fair ground, I feel even that should not be allowed. Food stalls attract the wrong kind of people and result in littering. 

 Debasish Chakraborty, 

 Cossipore

 Definitely not. The sale of other products is going to affect the dignity of the Book Fair. We should not forget that the fair results in the spread of literacy and culture, and should not be trivialised.

Arindam basu,

 Birati

 During a visit to the Book Fair last year, I noticed that almost all the food stalls were spilling over with customers, but even the stalls of some reputed publishers were empty. I felt sorry seeing books play second fiddle to food.

 The space occupied by the food stalls can be allotted to small publishers and little magazines. The fair would thus act as a launchpad for publishing houses, which in turn would provide a platform to budding writers. The fair authorities should try to keep books in focus.

 Gauri Mitra,

 Salt Lake

 Sale of products other than books should not be allowed at the Book Fair. The presence of other stalls and their advertisements make it difficult for book-lovers to trace the stalls of their choice. At most, one or two food stalls might be allowed. But their presence should not violate the spirit of the fair. 

 Paramananda Pal,

 Address not given

 As its name suggests, the Book Fair is essentially for book-lovers. However, in recent times, CDs of books are also being sold at the fair. However, in such a fair, it is odd to sell material that has no relation with the written word. Not only does the stalls of other products violate the atmosphere of the fair, but they also divert the attention of the visitors. Food stalls that provide much-needed sustenance to the visitors, however, cannot be dispensed with. 

 Suchanda Sen,

 Howrah 

 Sale of other products at the Book Fair would result in commotion, which would disturb book-lovers. The fair should remain their exclusive domain.

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake

 Items related to books and education, like stationery, can be sold at the Book Fair. A separate enclosure can also be built for stalls vending soft drinks and food. But the prices charged should not be higher than that charged outside. And no one should be allowed to hawk on the fair ground.

 Biswajyoti Bagchi,

 Alipore

 A visit to the Book Fair is a must for the majority of Calcuttans. Though most people drop in at the fair to browse through books, they also look forward to spending an enjoyable afternoon with family and friends. Debates and talk shows are also part of the attraction of the fair. Also, it is impossible to forego food and drinks for more than a few hours. The stalls set up by television channels and financial institutions should be removed.

 Jyoti Agarwal,

 Alipore

 Whether a product can be sold at the Book Fair depends on its nature. Items like stationery and CD-ROM can certainly be sold at the fair. Food stalls and first-aid kiosks are essential, but sale of clothes, toys etc should be avoided.

 Tuhin Purkayastha,

 Parnasree Palli

 A lot of people visit the Book Fair for reasons other than browsing and buying books. Small traders and artisans should be allowed to set up stalls in the fair to supplement their income.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mane man?s fav is Dirrty Aguilera

 - International stylist in raptures over Indian women?s striking eyes, superb hair

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 This mane man has styled Kylie Minogue, Christina Aguilera and Beyonce Knowles. Yet, it?s Aishwarya Rai?s ?strikingly beautiful hair? that has caught his eye. Meet international hairstylist John Gillespie, who breezed through town on Monday.

 On his first trip to India, the Scottish stylist was completely taken in by Indian beauties, their ?stunning eyes and superb-quality hair?. 

 He is, in fact, all set for an Indian rendezvous in the form of an exotic photo shoot. ?I want to capture four sharp makeovers showcasing sexy, geometric cuts on Indian women,? he told Metro, while launching Satinique, an Amway haircare range of which he is brand ambassador.

 The man who began his career in the kitchen ?correcting his friends? hair cuts?, now boasts more than 21 years of experience in the high-profile industry. Gillespie?s first stint with starry tresses was about 15 years ago, when he styled rock star Andrew Ridgeley of Wham! fame. Since then, there?s has been no dearth of ?huge moments?.

 Topping the list, of course, is his ?big night? ? the MTV Europe Music Awards 2004, where Gillespie was chosen to be part of a 13-member team of ?world-class stylists?. His ?favourite was and still is? Christina Dirrty Aguilera. ?I twisted all her hair and made her wear it down,? he recounts.

 While he made Beyonce?s tresses ?poker straight?, he let Kylie?s mane appear ?loose and voluminous?. The Australian pop star, says Gillespie, is a ?small person with very fine hair?. Some amount of volume is ?what she needs? at all times.

 Volume variation for Kylie and super straight for Beyonce. But the man of the moment, for Gillespie, was Justin Timberlake, former boyfriend of Britney Spears and current date of Cameron Diaz. ?He is such a regular guy? His hair is quite wavy and looks best short. All I needed to do was mess it up a bit.?

 The Gillespie prediction for the next global look is sharp style with lots of blunt cuts and very geometric in nature. And the colour story? ?Browns, browns and more browns.?

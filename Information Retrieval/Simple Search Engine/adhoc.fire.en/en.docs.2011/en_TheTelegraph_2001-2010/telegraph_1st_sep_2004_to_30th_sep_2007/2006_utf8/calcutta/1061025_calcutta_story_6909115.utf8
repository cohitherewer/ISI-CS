 It is the death of a dream. The worn-out building, the rusty gate, the mossy walls all proclaim the story of the hard times the school has fallen on. Prafullanagar Acharya Prafulla Chandra Vidyapith was established by residents of Prafullanagar, most of whom were employees of Bengal Chemical at Sodepur, on January 1, 1951.

 Standing in front of the statues of Iswarchandra Vidyasagar and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy, secretary Binoy Mitras eyes fill with tears as he seeks remedy with folded hands.

 The teacher count is dwindling. Now, there are only nine, including the principal. Among the nine, the history teacher is on leave, said principal Samiran Guha Niyogi.

 The district inspector of schools, secondary education, did not allegedly respond to the repeated requests of the school authorities to recruit a teacher.

 The school does not have any Sanskrit teacher. The Sanskrit teacher died in an accident in 2004. An application for a replacement was submitted the same year. There are no teachers for physical education and work education, too. The district inspectors office showed no interest in filling up the vacancies. At times, I have to take classes myself, says the 80-year-old Mitra.

 The school also applied for upgrade to the Higher Secondary standard in 2001. Even after a thorough inspection, it has not been upgraded because there are not enough students. 

 Several of our students have left because of lack of facilities, said Mitra. District inspector Aniruddha Ganguly refused to comment on the issue.

 The school caters mostly to underprivileged children. The Madhyamik results used to be quite up to the mark. In 1998, five of the 13 students got first division and there were star marks, too. But the results deteriorated gradually, said Niyogi. 

 One hundred and thirty-one students, eight teachers, a few non-teaching employees and one strong man at 80 make the team that is fighting all odds.

 I just cant bear the fact that the school, started for a good cause, is being ruined by the carelessness of the authorities, said Mitra.

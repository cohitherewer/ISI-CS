 Masada, the mountain rock rising in splendid isolation from the Judean Desert on the western shores of the Dead Sea, shares wall space with The Ophel, the biblical city of King David, ruins of the Katzrin synagogue and the fishing village of Capernaum along the Sea of Galilee.

 ?Israel ? Archaeology from the air?, a novel photo exhibition being held at Swabhumi (February 24-27), showcases aerial photographs of archaeological finds, monuments and others by Duby Tal and Moni Haramati, ex-Israeli fighter pilots.

 The event, part of the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the Independence of the state of Israel, is produced by the public affairs division of the Israel ministry of foreign affairs and presented by the embassy and the honorary consulate of Israel in Calcutta.

 The mounted exhibition features frames taken from the duo?s third book, Skyline Archaeology, published in 1994. Skyline-Israel from Above and Skyline-Jerusalem from Above are their other books.

 ?Israel has the highest density of known archaeological sites per square kilometre. It is also the birthplace of two of the greatest monotheistic faiths of the world, Judaism and Christianity,? Harsh Neotia, honorary consul of Israel in Calcutta, said after inaugurating the exhibition on Friday.

 The aerial shots taken from a Robinson helicopter piloted by Haramati, capture archaeological finds, natural and manmade landscape in the varying light of each hour, at sunrise, sunset and in the continual interplay of light and shade.

 Traces of the ancient towns, religious monuments, battlefields and the vast secular and literary heritage of the two religions and of the Muslim communities that lived there have attracted scholars from all over the world.

 Archaeological studies are being conducted since the mid-19th Century when biblical scholars surveyed the area in search of remains of places mentioned in the Old and New Testaments. Neotia hopes the exhibition will offer a ?unique opportunity to look into the setting and geographical significance of the area?. At present, there are some 20,000 recognised sites of antiquity in Israel protected by law.

 From the fortresses of Masada and Herodium, where the Jews fought for freedom, to Qumran, south of Jericho, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were preserved, the Jewish Quarters of the Old City and the Hisham Palace, winter haunt of the kings of the Hasmonean Dynasty and King Herod? The vignettes are as varied as they are dramatic.

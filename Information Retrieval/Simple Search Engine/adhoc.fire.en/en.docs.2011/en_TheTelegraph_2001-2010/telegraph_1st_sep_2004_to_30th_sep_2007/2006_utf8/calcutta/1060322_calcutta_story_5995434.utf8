 Hippie hair hues

 What: Launch 

 of Couture Lights, a range of five hair looks for the season 

 by LOreal.

 Where: Headturners, the salon at 3A, Gurusaday Road. 

 When: Tuesday, 3 pm.

 The collection: The Couture Lights range by LOreal boasts five distinct looks ? Colour Couture, Colour Accents, Sunkiss, Blonde Ambition and Volum Sculpt. Colour Couture is about highlights for the look of extreme sophistication with a glamorous couture result. Colour Accents uses high shine highlights that result in a deep and long-lasting colour. The Sunkiss look revolves around a textured haircut played up by dual tones. Blonde Ambition is an eclectic and dramatic look while Volum Sculpt promises to enhance hair volume. And the new Diacolor Richess, a sub-brand of LOreal, plays a tone-on-tone magic to create a unique dimension, breaking the monotony of curly hair.

 Hairstylist Amin chose Colour 

 Couture to give a tress makeover to model Natasha (in picture

 with her complexion and hair texture, said Amin.

 Seasons style: Amin says that the seasons hair texture has a distinct hippie feel. Colour effects are going through a subtle phase and are all about tone-on-tone shades in complementary colours, he said.

 Voiceover: This new collection by LOreal promises to shatter the myth that blonde hues dont go well with Indian skin tones. If the colour is placed correctly as highlights, it can look great on dusky complexions too. Also, it is another misconception that blonde hair tones are difficult to maintain, correct after-care products can lend the hair a long-lasting rich shine, said a spokesperson for LOreal.

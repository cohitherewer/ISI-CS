 Auction of seized goods

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Want to buy a colour TV or a washing machine cheap? Be at the commercial tax office in Beleghata, where a large number of such goods will be auctioned on February 18. 

 Unclaimed goods, seized by the department from shops and warehouses, will be put under the hammer. They include cooking appliances, vacuum cleaners, crockery, toiletries, stationery and luxurious household items, cosmetics, shoes and garments.

 Officials said anyone can take part in the auction after applying to the department and depositing a certain fee. ?We have invited applications from the public. There is no condition for participating in the auction, but applicants will have to deposit the money,? said a tax officer.

 The goods to be put on sale were seized from traders on charges of non-payment of the way-bill fee.

 According to rules, a trader carrying goods to the city has to obtain a way bill after depositing a fee at the commercial tax department. Traders can also obtain way bills from checkpoints. 

 Employees manning checkpoints are bound to seize goods if a trader fails to produce the way bill.

 But a section of traders bribes employees at checkpoints and do not pay the fee. The other way to avoid payment is to take a less-frequented route that does not have checkpoints.

 ?We have a team that patrols the wholesale markets in the city. The members conduct surprise checks by stopping trucks and asking the drivers to produce the necessary documents. If a driver fails to produce the papers, the goods are impounded,? said a senior official of the tax department.

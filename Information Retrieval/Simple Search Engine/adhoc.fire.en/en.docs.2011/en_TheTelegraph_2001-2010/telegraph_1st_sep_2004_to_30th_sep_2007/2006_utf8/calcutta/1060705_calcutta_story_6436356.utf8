 Continental corner goes chatpata

 SUBHRO SAHA

 fare at Blue Fox 

 The second coming during Puja 2003 was marked by a sumptuous spread of a specially-researched Mediterranean menu to go with the classic Indian and the exotic Oriental.

 Come Puja 2006 and Blue Fox, that stood tall in the culinary corridor of Park Street since 1961, will sacrifice its perennial picks at the altar of the fast-food fad, as it comes out of the cold again. Exit, Chicken Tetrazzini and Baked Alaska. Enter, chaat and chatpata.

 Locked out on July 12 last year by the management headed by catering king Dipak Kumar Singh, alias Munna Maharaj, due to labour trouble, the popular eatery is set to reopen this festive season, following full and final settlement of staff dues. But it will bear little resemblance with the Blue Fox we knew.

 We will come back as a full-fledged fast-food restaurant, with the existing 150 covers and add some standing space and a takeaway counter as well. We will also change the name from Blue Fox, Sanjay Singh, brother of Munna Maharaj, said on Tuesday.

 The laid-back landmark on 55, Park Street, where the likes of Meena Kumari, Louis Banks and Mohammed Aziz have entertained diners through the decades, will now morph into a quick-bite rendezvous, with a multi-cuisine menu that would include bakery products, pizzas and burgers.

 Munna Maharaj, who has served his signature dishes to a galaxy of celebrities ? from the Mittals to Michael Jackson ? had taken over Blue Fox in 2003 after the restaurant had remained closed for 10 months following faction-feuds among the erstwhile partners.

 He now plans to introduce some of his most sought-after chaats and chatpatas at the born-again Park Street haunt.

 Theres no denying the tinge of melancholy that is bound to greet the menu makeover. Its sad that Blue Fox wont be what it was and many Calcuttans have nostalgic memories of the place which served amazing food and was the other live-music haunt besides us. However, given the location, even a fast-food place should do well, felt Sunny Puri, owner of Trincas.

 Nitin Kothari, whose Mocambo has managed to successfully hang on to its original continental avatar all these years, agrees. The first reaction is Im disappointed. But then, they might be moving with the times and could be a step ahead of us, said Kothari, also vice president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India.

 At Blue Fox, meanwhile, Sanjay Singh claimed the management has already completed financial settlement with 20 of its 35 erstwhile staff members. The total compensation package would cost us close to Rs 65 lakh, he added. The establishment will resume operations with a fresh staff roster.

 Restoration of an ex-gratia compensation package for the scrapped service tax was one of the demands on the staff charter. The bone of contention, however, was bonus on leave wages, which the employees demanded and the management refused, citing the tripartite pact of April 2003 signed before the labour commissioner.

 They have offered the employees a golden handshake and plan to reopen with new hands. There are a few minor points still to be sorted out, but we hope things will work out, said Mohammed Nizamuddin, president of the Citu-affiliated City Eating amp; Refreshment Establishments Workers Union.

 Selfish materialistic pursuits override all human duties and sensitivities where people are singularly engaged in a stiff battle for wealth, power and position in society. Family values and traditions, that were formerly nurtured and passed on with great care, have now ceased to matter in the least. What is left of society is merely a sad relic of the past; a torn, fragmented, decayed structure which we all criticise, but make no effort to reform. Annyakatha?s play, Swapna Yuddha, introduces us to an individual who fights against odds in his attempt to make a positive change in society and, in the process, makes us conscious of our responsibilities. A dreamer and an idealist, he wishes to make the world a better, brighter and safer place for future generations. Unfolding his dreams and how he plans to fulfil them, the play invites the audience to dream along with its protagonist and help him in realising his vision. Script and direction: Monosij Bandopadhyay.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Swapna Yuddha, produced by Annyakatha 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Sisir Mancha

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fuel lack hits upper-end car-owners

 JAYANTA BASU

 During A.P.J. Abdul Kalams visit to Calcutta a few months ago, officials of the state transport department were in a tizzy, trying to procure 95 RON (research octane number) petrol for the Presidents Mercedes-Benz.

 This, despite a government of India notification making it mandatory for oil companies to supply 95 RON petrol in 11 cities in the country, including Calcutta, from April 1, 2005. 

 Unleaded petrol must be 95 RON to be compliant with Bharat Stage (BS) III engines. 

 A higher octane number means smoother engine operation with less knocking, better combustion and hence, better emission.

 In a complaint to the director of the public vehicles department, auto emission expert S.M. Ghosh had pointed out that 95 RON petrol is not being supplied to the city, in violation of the central notification. Calcutta pumps only get 91 RON petrol. 

 The fuel for the Presidents car was somehow managed. Other car-owners, however, are not so lucky.

 My customers are willing to pay the price, but oil companies havent yet brought 95 RON petrol to the state, complained Hiteswar Singh, chief executive officer of Interkrafts, the only Mercedes dealer in Calcutta.

 Singh added that he had sought supply of 95 RON petrol for 30 to 40 customers in the city, but Bharat Petroleum had not got back.

 Engines of all Mercedes models are manufactured in Germany. The company takes fuel samples from India to customise the engines, explained the dealer.

 He stated: Super-refined, 5.5-l AMG engines cannot run on 91 RON petrol. Premium cars like Ferraris need petrol higher than 95 octane. 

 Atanu Ganguly of the Delhi-based Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers defended the supply of 91 RON petrol since engines are being customised according to Indian fuel.

 Prof P.K. Bose of Jadavpur University was not willing to buy the theory that luxury cars are customised to run on lower-grade fuel. The industry is not ready with appropriate fuel, though high-end cars are coming into the market, he remarked.

 With the prescribed octane-rated fuel not available, the emission guarantee by car manufacturers up to 80,000 km makes no sense and the consumers are being taken for a ride, alleged S.M. Ghosh.

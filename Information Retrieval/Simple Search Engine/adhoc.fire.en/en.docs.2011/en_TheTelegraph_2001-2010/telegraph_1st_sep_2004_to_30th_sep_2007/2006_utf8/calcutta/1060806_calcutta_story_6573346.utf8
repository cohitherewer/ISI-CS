 Next weekend you can be at ... 

Kapilash

 At an altitude of 2,150 ft, Kapilash 

 is called the Kailash of Orissa. The getaway is located 

 atop an undulating lush green hillock close to the headquarters 

 of Dhenkanal district, also called Dhenkanal. The region 

 was once part of the ancient capital of Keshari kingdom 

 and known as Chowduar.

 The gateway to Kapilash is Dhenkanal 

 town, 26 km away. Pick up your provisions here before heading 

 up. You will be able to find basic ration even at Kapilash.

 Surrounded on all sides by the 

 Eastern Ghats, Kapilash is quite picturesque. There is an 

 abundance of sal, segun, kendu, jarul 

 and mohua apart from many other plants. The fauna consists 

 mainly of monkeys, jungle cats, peacocks and squirrels. 

 The dense forests and the presence of wild animals draws 

 many nature-lovers to this area. 

 The people of the region believe 

 that Kapilash is the abode of Lord Chandrasekhar or Shiva. 

 There is a popular temple atop the hill. This is surrounded 

 by a cluster of other shrines and a medieval fort. Nearly 

 2,000 steps lead to the main temple. There is also a serpentine 

 motorable road.

 The temples of Narayana and Viswanath 

 on the hilltop are also popular places of pilgrimage. Some 

 distance away is a ridge on which stands the relics of a 

 ruined fort and a few ancient caves.

 The deer park was the solitary 

 attraction of the foothills till a science park was built 

 adjacent to it. For children, the two parks remain the top 

 draw of Kapilash.

 The tourism department of the 

 Orissa government provides the best accommodation option. 

 Not only is its Panthashala quite comfortable, both vegetarian 

 and non-vegetarian fare is available at reasonable rates.

 A stay at the tourism department 

 bungalow will help you recharge your batteries. The surroundings 

 are serene and free of pollution. The lush green vista and 

 oxygen-rich air are guaranteed to provide a welcome diversion 

 from city life.

 Having said that, Kapilash is 

 not really a place for those looking for adventure. Lie 

 back and laze around for as long as you can. A leisurely 

 walk is the most strenuous activity you can possibly undertake 

 here.

 There is a trail to explore, though. 

 It leads through the jungle around the bungalow to a spring. 

 Its water is believed to be a cure for many a disease.

 Deogaon, 5 km way, is worth a 

 visit, even if only in search of sustenance. Many tourists 

 at Kapilash go there to buy chicken!

 If you do not want to take all 

 that trouble for a meaty mouthful, place your order in advance 

 with the manager of Panthashala and he will take care of 

 the rest.

 Saptasajya is another charming 

 spot, 11 km from Dhenkanal. Visit the temples of Saptarshi 

 and Raghunath there. Legend has it that the Pandavas had 

 taken shelter here while in hiding.

 You can also go on an excursion 

 to Joranda, now growing in popularity among tourists. Followers 

 of the Mahima cult visit Joranda as pilgrimage. It is also 

 famous for handicrafts. 

 The hills around Kapilash form 

 the rough boundary of the Cuttack and Dhenkanal districts. 

 Of the numerous peaks, the loftiest is Kapilash.

 The abode of Shiva comes alive 

 during the most important festival of the region, Shivratri. 

 Thousands of pilgrims gather here from various parts of 

 the state. Some come from as far off as Cuttack. Devotees 

 carry the water of the Mahanadi in earthen vessels on their 

 shoulders. They trek barefoot to the hilltop before pouring 

 the water on the Shivling. The fair held to celebrate the 

 occasion continues for three days.

 Going

 The nearest airport is Bhubaneswar, 

 113 km away. Kapilash is 26 km from Dhenkanal by road. Dhenkanal 

 is on the 

 Talcher-Puri branch line of South 

 Eastern Railway (SER). Cuttack, on the main line of SER, 

 is connected with Dhenkanal by road. Jeeps are available 

 from Dhenkanal to Deogaon. There is a bus stop at the foot 

 of Kapilash

 Staying

 There is a PWD inspection bungalow 

 and a few dharamshalas for pilgrims.

 Project for Bypass water supply

 - 15-km pipeline under busy thoroughfares for 30-gallon facility at Dhapa

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Residents on the eastern side of EM Bypass, forced to hit the bottle for drinking water, may be able to kick the habit in another three years.

 Thats if a grand plan of drawing water from the Hooghly and carrying it 15 km by digging up half the city travels from idea to implementation.

 The idea is to have a 30-million-gallon plant at Dhapa to supply the eastern side of the Bypass, which now has no source of treated water.

 The implementation will involve laying out a 15-km pipeline, 52 inches in diameter, 15 feet under some of the busiest thoroughfares in central and south Calcutta.

 To link the Mullickghat Pumping Station at Burrabazar with the Dhapa waterworks, the pipes will have to be laid under stretches of the central business district, the Maidan, Shakespeare Sarani, Park Circus and more (see chart).

 The proposed Rs 100-crore water treatment plant is coming up under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission for the benefit of over a million people living on the eastern side of EM Bypass, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 The project has been approved by the central government and the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission has already cleared 25 per cent of the funds.

 Chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity said work on the proposed project would take off soon after its ratification by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation later this month, and would take around three years to complete.

 Discussions are on with the city traffic planner of the state transport department, the city police and other technical experts to find a way to lay the pipelines without causing major traffic disruptions, stated Bandyopadhyay.

 We are yet to get the final route map of the proposed pipeline from the civic authorities, but we have advised them to explore the feasibility of following the trenchless method of laying pipes under busy roads, said deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim.

 He admitted that laying of such a large-diameter pipe under such thoroughfares would spell trouble for traffic movement. But chief engineer Maity clarified that since the source of surface water lies along the western border of the city, there is no option but to carry it to the Dhapa treatment plant on the eastern end through an underground network of intake pipes.

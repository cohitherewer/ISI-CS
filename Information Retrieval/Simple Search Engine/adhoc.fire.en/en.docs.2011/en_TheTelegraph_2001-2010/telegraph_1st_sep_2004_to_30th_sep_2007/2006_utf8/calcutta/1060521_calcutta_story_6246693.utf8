 Neck deep in dazzle

 From chunky chokers to 

 cleavage-kissing ropes of diamonds, Smita Roy Chowdhury 

 zooms in on the accessories turning heads at the ongoing Cannes 

 Film Festival 

 While internationally the silhouettes are getting cleaner with straight lines and bare shoulders, the fashion focus has clearly shifted from surface ornamentation to accessories. And when it comes to the beauty brigade at the Cannes carnival, the neck seems to be the focal point of attention.

 Be it a stone-studded serpent circling Bollywood beauty Aishwarya Rais neck or ropes of diamonds caressing the cleavages of most Hollywood actresses, all the action on the jewellery front is clearly happening near the neck.

 The trend that was born last year, and was quite visible at the Cannes fiesta in 2005, has snowballed into a rage this year. 

 Says couture jeweller Raj Mahtani: Till a couple of years ago, there was an overdose of earrings. But the trend of cascading danglers has totally worn out. Now, elaborate neckpieces are in fashion worldwide.

 Adds the man from Satramdas Dhalamal Jewellers on Park Street: The clothes are very clean now and hence there is a natural digression towards neck jewellery for a fuller look. At Cannes this year were getting to see a lot of plain, black gowns, accessorised with heavy neckpieces.

 While last year one got to see everything from beads and shells to metallic ropes going round and round the neck in good volume, the look this year is far more delicate and classical. 

 Women the world over are taking jewellery much more seriously now. The playful and casual approach towards real jewellery is gone. The look hence is very vintage, classical and feminine, feels Raj.

 The designs are either structured or lacy and flowing, stopping near the cleavage or hugging the neck tightly. 

 Neck jewellery is coming back with a bang and international fashionistas are sporting lots of them with gowns. And theres nothing small in neck jewellery right now. Bold, striking pendants and chunky chokers are the most happening pieces. The look is feminine, delicate and very opulent, says jewellery designer Varda Goenka of Diagold.

 Diamonds, diamonds and more diamonds in unusual cuts and colours, set in white gold, are the flavour of fashion. Champagne, pink, gold? newer hues are very visible in diamonds. Knots, crosses and geometrics comprise the design diktat, with florals on their way out.

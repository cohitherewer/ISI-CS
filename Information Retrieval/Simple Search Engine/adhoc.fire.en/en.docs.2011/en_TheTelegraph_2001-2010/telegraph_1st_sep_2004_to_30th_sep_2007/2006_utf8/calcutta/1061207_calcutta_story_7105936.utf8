The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 If Dabboo Ratnani does a Bollywood 

 calendar every year with 24 stars appearing in different 

 moods and media for his lens, its now the turn of Subi 

 Samuel. But unlike Dabboo, Subis got just one star to pose 

 for his calendar shots John Abraham.

 The concept: Zee Muzic 

 got together with John and Subi to come up with the collectors 

 edition calendar for 2007. Unlike other clients, the channel 

 gave me a free hand to shoot anything I wanted and that 

 got me going instantly, Subi tells Metro.

 Every month of the calendar has 

 John in a different pose in an exclusive setting. I was 

 very excited to be part of this initiative, says the Bollywood 

 hunk. We had a blast shooting the calendar. Subi has done 

 a terrific job. 

 For Zee Muzic, John went well 

 with the image of the channel. Irshwin Balwani, business 

 head of the channel, says: John Abraham is the hottest 

 youth icon today. The visuals are an embodiment of what 

 John is about natural, rugged, adventurous and exciting.

 As Subi sums up, its about the 

 five Ss sun, sand, sea, skin and (loads of) sex appeal.

 Monochromatic: Doing away 

 with colour altogether, Subi has gone for black-and-white 

 in all the 12 frames. Theres no reason in particular apart 

 from the fact that I love black-and-white as a medium, 

 the ace photographer, who turned film producer earlier in 

 the year with Alag, explains.

 I have always had this strong 

 bias towards black-and-white because they make for some 

 very interesting pictures, Subi adds. For the calendar, 

 we shot on the beaches of Goa, besides a few indoor shots, 

 and it was interesting to capture the sun and sand in black-and-white.

 Shooting John: So, is John 

 Abraham the perfect model? Thats a sticky one is how 

 Subi tackled the question. After all, half of Bollywood 

 is best friends with the lensman who is slated to produce 

 four films in the new year. 

 But Subi has no qualms in admitting 

 that John is definitely one of the best in front of the 

 camera. The man is a delight to shoot... John gives 100 

 per cent for every shot and that too from the time he was 

 just another model. That level of commitment comes from 

 my end also and so the end result always comes out top notch. 

 Also, we were all old friends working for the shoot. So 

 it was a whole lot of fun.

 Out of bounds: Its difficult 

 for the aam janata to lay his (and more importantly 

 her) hands on the John calendar, once it is launched in 

 another couple of weeks. It will be a very limited edition 

 release, reveals a Zee spokesperson.

 So, you have to hope that one 

 of your friends or family members is presented a copy of 

 the calendar and then you can beg, borrow or steal John 

 for yourself. However, you can gape at the soft copies of 

 the 12 John Abrahams on the actors personal website www.johnabraham.com.

 The calendar is almost sure to 

 be back for 2008, and while Subi is keeping it under wraps, 

 it may not be John every time.

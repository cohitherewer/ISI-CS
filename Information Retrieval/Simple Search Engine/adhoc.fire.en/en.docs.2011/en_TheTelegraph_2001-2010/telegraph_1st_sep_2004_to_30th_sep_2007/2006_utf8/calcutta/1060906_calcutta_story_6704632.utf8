 Classes were disrupted at Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) on Tuesday, as students went on a strike to protest police interference in the institutions affairs.

 The Independent Consolidation-backed BESU Students Union demanded that criminal proceedings against eight students be dropped, police pickets on campus be withdrawn and disputes involving students be resolved through talks.

 Police pickets have been posted at the institute after the death of Soumik Basu, a third-year student who fell victim to campus unrest last month.

 The latest round of campus resentment leading to Tuesdays strike has been brewing since August 22, when eight students were detained by police for moving around the campus at midnight. University rules prohibit students from loitering around after 10 pm.

 Following detention, a suo motu case was registered against them under Section 107 CrPC (breach of peace). The eight appeared before the executive magistrate, Howrah, on Tuesday for bail.

 The court directed the head of the institution to furnish a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh each for the eight students. But a copy of the order is yet to reach us, said Gautam Dhang, who appeared for the students.

 Abhigyan Bera, of Independent Consolidation, threatened an indefinite strike if the demands are not met. 

 The college authorities refused to comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Big stars, big tickets, big rush

 - Karan Johars latest storms in at Rs 250 per seat, 23 plex shows a day

 Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee in KANK

 It doesnt get bigger than this King Khan vs both Bachchans; Rani vs Preity; Karan Johars crack at a hit hat-trick (after Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham); whopping number of prints (30); ticket prices touching an all-time plex high in the city (Rs 250).

 Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, better known as KANK, has shown that size does still matter in big bad Bollywood. 

 And what better timing than an extended first weekend Friday (August 11) to Tuesday (August 15) that looks set to rake it all in with 23 shows a day at the multiplexes.

 Even a week ago, though, it was just five shows at one plex. But, thanks to the sheer magnitude of KANK, the distributor and exhibitors went into daily huddles and by Thursday afternoon, the Fanaa history, of standalone release only, was not repeated. Finally, everythings on track and we are coming in all four city multiplexes, besides single-screeners like Menoka, Paradise, Malancha and Jaya, revealed KANK distributor Kushagra Jalan.

 The advances have not disappointed. We have had to add an extra show, says Prashant Srivastav of 89 Cinemas. The theme of marital infidelity has made KANK more of a plex film than a Fanaa or a Krrish. People have been queuing up for tickets from 8.30 in the morning.

 The single screens havent lost out, either. Almost 90 per cent of the tickets till Tuesday have been sold out, says Pranab Ray of Menoka. Black had shown that if a big film is good, it can run well everywhere.

 The increased pricing hasnt had an effect on ticket sales. After Rs 200 for Sarkar and Rs 225 for Mangal Pandey, INOX (Forum) is charging Rs 250 for a ticket of KANK. While the ticket prices at other plexes range from Rs 160 to Rs 200, a balcony ticket at a single-screen theatre like Menoka costs Rs 150. The main reason for the higher pricing is the length of the movie (3 hrs 12 min), says Jalan. While we are starting the first of the four shows at 11 am in many single-screen theatres, we are losing out on a show at many places.

 Before it breaks all relationships, KANK is one love story which sure has broken many rules.

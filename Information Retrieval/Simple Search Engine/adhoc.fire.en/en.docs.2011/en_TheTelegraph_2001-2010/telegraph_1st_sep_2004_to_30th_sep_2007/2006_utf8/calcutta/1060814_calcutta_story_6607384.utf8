The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Diwali debut for link road

 KINSUK BASU

 The much-awaited Prince Anwar Shah Road connector to the EM Bypass is set to be unveiled by Diwali, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) officials say.

 The two-lane road, 15 metres wide, will be a faster alternative to the Rashbehari connector for motorists approaching the Bypass from the south. According to officials, reaching the fringe artery from the crossing of Prince Anwar Shah Road and Raja SC Mullick Road through the new road will take just six minutes.

 Taking stock of its various projects, the CMDA has realised that the Puja deadline for completing the Anwar Shah connector cannot be met. Diwali has been set as the new deadline, and the contractors and engineers have been warned that no further delay will be tolerated.

 At the CMDA, we have been handling several major projects and our primary concern is to deliver work on time. Keeping this policy in mind, we have decided to throw open the Anwar Shah Road connector shortly, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 Once the road is unveiled, the authorities will start work on its expansion to four lanes, covering 30 metres in width. A Rs 20-crore expansion scheme has been submitted, said Debdas Bhattacharya, chief engineer of the traffic and transportation department.

 Language link to software markets

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Learn German and Japanese is the new mantra of IT professionals in the city.

 With software markets emerging in Germany and Japan, the Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council has decided to promote learning of the two languages. The West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) is also planning to set up a laboratory for learning foreign languages. 

 ?The future of the IT business is in Japan and Germany, so the professionals must learn to interact in the local tongues,? asserted S. Radhakrishnan, chairman of council?s state committee and managing director, Descon Ltd. 

 In a recent circular, the council, an autonomous organisation under the Union ministry of communications and information technology, announced two schemes under which professionals learning Japanese would be reimbursed 50 per cent of the fees. 

 ?In order to enable exporters and professionals to overcome the language barrier in entering the IT software and services market in Germany and Japan, the ministry of commerce and industry has approved the council?s proposal,? stated Radhakrishnan.

 The scheme, Language Related Market Access Facilitation Initiative, has been implemented in Calcutta and employees of the member companies of the council can avail of the benefits. 

 ?We have set up collaborations with all the recognised foreign language teaching institutes in the city, like the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture and Max Mueller Bhavan,? Radhakrishnan added. The course completion certificate has to be produced for reimbursement.

 The technology colleges are also gearing up to teach students foreign languages. ?Learning foreign languages is a must for IT professionals, along with developing hard skills,? opined Ashok Ranjan Thakur, vice-chancellor, WBUT.

 ?The laboratory for learning foreign languages will be an open forum and can be replicated at all institutes affiliated to the university,? he added.

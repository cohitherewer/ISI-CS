 When art is born of spontaneous expression of emotion, it truly represents the reality of life. Transgressing the boundaries imposed by lines and strokes, it assumes a unique dimension of artistic authenticity, allowing us to witness the truth of life in a way that was hitherto hidden from view. Expressions, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by Ranadip Das (one of his paintings appears above) and Parthapratim, brings to light emotions and experiences that stay embedded within the dark confines of the human psyche. Creating a coated imagery with overlapping layers of dark, dusky colours, Das helps us perceive the depths of our sub-conscious feelings. Illuminating fantasy through the interweaving of light and shade, Parthapratim evokes a realm of existence that is alien to the natural one. Nevertheless, his play of colours acts merely as a camouflage, making familiar objects appear strange and out of this world.

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Ranadip Das and Parthapratim 

When: Till February 25, 3 pm - 8 pm 

Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

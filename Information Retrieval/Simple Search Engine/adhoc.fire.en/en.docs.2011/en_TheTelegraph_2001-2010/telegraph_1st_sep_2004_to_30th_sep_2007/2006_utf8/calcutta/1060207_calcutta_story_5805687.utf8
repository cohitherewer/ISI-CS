 Hangouts in safe sex chant

 - Youth haunts to instal condom-vending machines for awareness spread

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 There?s a safe sex campaign ahead at nightclubs

 Big boys play (it safe) at night could soon be the slogan at popular nightclubs. For, sharing space with the beverages and Bollywood beats will be condom-vending machines.

 ?One can spot a condom-vending machine in any nightclub abroad. Youngsters who hesitate in buying a condom from medical stores can now simply pick it up while partying,? says Vinay Jaiswal of Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI). The AJC Bose Road star hotel is importing a machine to be installed at Underground, the HHI disc, by April.

 But Underground could be beaten to the condom cause by Sourav?s: The Food Pavilion. ?We have a lot of youngsters coming in during weekends. Having a condom-vending machine would create awareness amongst them. We plan to instal a machine by March in Prince of Calcutta, the disc on the fourth floor. The DJ will also speak on the virtues of safe sex,? reveals a spokesperson for the Park Street food pavilion.

 Adding to the safe sex campaign ? close on the heels of Tantra hosting an AIDS awareness evening driven by DJ Josey Kray from London ? would be B.E.D. 

 ?A vending machine was supposed to be there from the inception of the nightclub? The rush of youngsters at the nightclub has prompted us to go ahead with the plan now,? says Hem Dhillon, director of the Ballygunge Circular Road party address.

 For the young party people, the move is a welcome one. ?This should have a big impact, with youngsters realising that their favourite nightclubs also preach safe sex,? says 23-year-old Atan Shah.

 If nightclubs are growing socially-conscious, can the other youth hangouts be far behind? Coffee shops will soon have condoms on the menu ? or at least within touching distance ? with Caffeine?s Gol Park branch and the Caf? Coffee Pai lounge caf? coming up in New Alipore. ?This is a good way to spread awareness about safe sex,? says Navin Pai of Caf? Coffee Pai. ?The Gol Park outlet has the maximum footfall, with quite a few colleges and other institutions nearby,? explains Caffeine owner Rajdeep Goshal.

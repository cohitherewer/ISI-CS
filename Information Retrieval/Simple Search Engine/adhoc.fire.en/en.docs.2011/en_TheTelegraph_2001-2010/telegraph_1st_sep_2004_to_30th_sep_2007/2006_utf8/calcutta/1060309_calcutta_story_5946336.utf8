 You share your birthday with...

 Zakir Hussain 

You do not rest till you have examined every aspect. You?re always convinced that there?s a way to improve the state of affairs. It?s good to have high ideals, but don?t expect them always from others. You?re a great learner from experience and never repeat a mistake. You have an immense capacity to work and the ability to do several things simultaneously. ? Kusum Bhandari

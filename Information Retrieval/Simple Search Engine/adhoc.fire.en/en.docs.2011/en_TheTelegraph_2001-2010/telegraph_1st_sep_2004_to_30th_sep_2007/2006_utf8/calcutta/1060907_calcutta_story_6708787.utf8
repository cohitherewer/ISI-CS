 A bizarre experiment with two children, a white and a black, marooned on an African island with a mute nurse for six years is the central theme of Kunal Basus latest novel Racists, published by Penguin. 

 The experiment is the outcome of a raging debate between an English craniologist obsessed with skull sizes and a French ethnographer who believes human species are as dissimilar as a horse and a zebra. 

 Basus book somehow reminds one of Roald Dahls famous short story William and Mary. There, too, the scientist-protagonist is so obsessed with his superior intelligence that his subservient widow did all the things that annoyed her husband, like drinking a cocktail and smoking, right in front of his preserved cranium. 

 Dahls black humour is somewhat reflected in Basus story as the subplot of the Englishmans assistant and the mute nurses love story triumphs over the rather inhuman experiment of their bosses.

 The European obsession with racial superiority and the consequent intellectual endeavour through the 18th and 19th centuries is what spurred Basus novel. 

 He is at pains to explain: It wasnt any personal experience that prompted me to write the book. I am race blind and dont have a minority angst. Neither am I a social scientist. Rather, it was the historian in me that led me to look into what was going on in that time. 

 The time is mid-19th Century, the time of European Enlightenment when Britain and France had consolidated their colonies and needed a science-backed theory to prove their natural superiority. Ironically, against that backdrop, an Englishman and a Frenchman are at loggerheads over the superiority of races.

 In the short discussion that followed the launch of the book at Oxford Bookstore on Tuesday, the audience demanded to know why the author did a traditional Afro-European racial confrontation and not a more apt Indo-European or even a Sino-European racial face-off. 

 Basu blamed it on the history of the times that he was writing about, when the European was at the top of the chain of races with the Negro at the very bottom.

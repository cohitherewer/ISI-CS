 ANUMITA GHOSH

 BABY'S DAY OUT 

 A petite beauty with long golden tresses and dreamy eyes, always clad in the trendiest of clothes and accessories. She is Barbie, the girl little girls just love to love. For them, she is best buddy and fashion icon rolled into one. And why not? Be it her looks, clothes, accessories and the add-ons she comes with, Barbie from the house of Mattel Toys has constantly revamped herself to be popular all over the globe.

 The latest role for Barbie is that of a pop star, in the brand new Idol Idols range. Her other relatively new avatar is that of a fairytale princess in the Barbie and The Magic of Pegasus line.

 With talent hunt shows like the American Idol and Indian Idol becoming a rage, children too are getting hooked on to these shows. The Barbie Idol Idols range is very well timed since a singing star is the most happening thing to be now, smiles Santanu Ghosh, customer care associate and manager-operations of the City Centre outlet of Shoppers Stop.

 In the Idol Idols range, Barbie with a tiny microphone in her hand is a cool singing star, sporting the latest fashion wear. For instance, in one of the models she flaunts a pair of bellbottoms teamed with sea green top and high heels. With golden danglers and wristband to match, Miss Barbie is in perfect hip hop attire. She also carries along her lipstick, hair dryer and blush-on for a final touch up before a performance. And with a battery operated real microphone, little girls aspiring to be the next Britney Spears or Sunidhi Chauhan can sing along with Barbie and share her superstar status. The set is priced at Rs 1,199. 

 The show stealer in this range is a swanky recording studio that todays tech savvy little ladies will never give a miss. The play set includes FM, a real headphone and recording facilities. Apart from digital recording gadgets, the studio is done up with lounge accessories. A silver table has a coffee maker and tiny cups. Stylish sofa sets with cushions take care of the sitting area. Walls in bright splashes of pink and mauve make for the complete effect. The set is of course not without a cut-out of singing star Barbie. This comes for Rs 2,499.

 In the Barbie and The Magic of Pegasus collection, she looks fetching in fairytale attire. One model finds her in an elegant lilac gown with a tiny bow on the neckline. Tiny mauve hoops and a silver crown on her head accentuate her looks. The set comes along with a stone-studded magic wand. 

 so in this range, a smiling teddy in white with curly eyelashes demands attention. It giggles and laughs when its tummy, toes and palms are pressed. The teddy even blushes, a tummy press bringing a reddish glow to its cheeks! The price tag for Barbie here is Rs 899.

 The Idol Idols and Barbie and The Magic of Pegagsus range are value-additions to the collection of Barbie goodies. Both the ranges are doing very well, says Santanu.

 The other inclusion is Barbie in a pink poncho with a furry neckline and corduroy trousers from the Fashion Fever range.

 While girls can play with their fashionable Barbie at home, they can flaunt accessories like glittered pencils, heart and flower shaped erasers, a key ring and a pink furry notebook at school. The set is priced at Rs 899.

 The My Scene range has Barbies friend Chelsea sporting blue denims and a stone wash jacket. The highlight of the set is a small black locker with a lock and key. The price tag: Rs 999.

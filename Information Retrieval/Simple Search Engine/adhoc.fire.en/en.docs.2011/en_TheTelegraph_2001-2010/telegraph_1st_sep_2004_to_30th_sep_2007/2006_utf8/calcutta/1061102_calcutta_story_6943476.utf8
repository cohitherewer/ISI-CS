Sarong party girls

Non- Resident Calcuttan

OUT TO CATCH CAUCASIAN MEN, THE SPGS, DUBBED 

SHAMELESS, HAVE FOUND A SPOKESPERSON, SAYS RUPALI GHOSH. 

 A glimpse of Zouk, a popular disco in Singapore

Caucasian men (read: blond, blue-eyed, tall, single 

or attached) are hot property in east Asian countries. From Tokyos swinging 

Roppongi clubs to the crowded buxiban (English conversation schools) of downtown 

Taipei; from Phukets white hot beaches to Singapores party spots on 

Emerald Hill, these men know they are on to a good thing. 

The good thing being an adoring little group of attractive 

local women out to woo, date, and if they get really lucky, eventually marry one 

of the blue-eyed boys. 

In Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, there is a derogatory 

term to describe these young and not-so-young women: the sarong party girls 

(SPGs in the abbreviated lexicon of our time). 

The term, of course, comes from Jim Aitchisons 

immensely popular 1994 satire on Singapore called Sarong Party Girl. 

SPGs, like their sisters in other parts of east Asia, 

follow a strict sartorial code. They like to dress skimpy, sarongs naturally being 

the preferred historical outfit teamed with halter tops. These days the sarongs 

arent compulsory and anything casual yet minimal does just fine. 

At Nok Jos barbeque shack tucked away in a dusty 

Phuket bylane one hot June evening, I saw some Thai SPGs prettily dressed in lycra 

tanks and silk hot pants knocking back chilled cans of Changs with a small 

group of raucous farang (Caucasian) men. 

The local media have long portrayed SPGs as shameless, 

gold-digging, really nasty hussies (to put it politely), who will do just about 

anything to snag that unsuspecting innocent Caucasian man. 

These days, at least in Singapore, the much-maligned 

SPGs have finally found a loud voice in spunky Miss Izzy: an opinionated SPG passionate 

about her commitment to the sisterhood and utterly reluctant to stay closeted. 

On Miss Izzys website, scattered among the controversial 

essays on sexual choice, the death penalty and religion, is a selection of naughtily 

naked or tastefully half-naked self-portraits. 

Miss Izzy makes no excuses for being an SPG; instead 

she lists her well-researched reasons for loving ang mo (the term means 

Caucasian in Singaporean slang) men: 1) Expat salaries are way more attractive 

than what the local guys earn; 2) Local men are abysmal. To paraphrase Miss Izzy 

for a family paper, male Chinese Singaporeans are woefully inadequate in certain 

areas of the anatomy, while Indian Singaporean men most commonly suffer from a 

problem of erectile dysfunction; 3) Local men Chinese, Indian or Malay rarely 

have their own apartments, preferring instead to live with their mothers... Like 

they say, there always are two sides to every story. 

Postscript: Singapores version of OK TATA 

Horn Please are these slick exciting graphic advertisements splashed across 

buses and taxis, like the striking red, black and white Biennale cab grafitti 

promoting the biggest art event of the year. 

Or the mammoth Olympus digicam ad with the open-mouthed 

shark hanging over the edge of the bus against an ocean blue background with the 

tagline Built for the Extreme. 

The artwork is designed by Moove Media, a Singapore 

company that manages outdoor media (ads on the move) plastered on 

taxis, buses and around railway stations. 

These days whenever I get into a taxi covered in Biennale 

graffiti, I promptly get the chatterbox cabbie to talk about Moove Media a great 

concept, but even greater is that it is a wonderful way to distract him from the 

volley of questions hes about to fire at me on everything from my Indianness 

to Bollywood movies and the authenticity of the Indian food sold on Serangoon 

Road.

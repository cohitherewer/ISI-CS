The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Business of bat amp; ball

 TRPs and money matters, rather than runs and wickets, could be the crux of cricket administration today

 This 

 was during the last ICC Champions Trophy. The cricket World 

 Cup in South Africa was less than a year away. The commentators, 

 during the break of a Champions Trophy match, were discussing 

 the upcoming Cup. A legendary South African cricketer of 

 yesteryears was in the box. The discussion veered towards 

 the prospects of India in the Cup. The South African made 

 the point that Indias preliminary engagements are being 

 played in grounds where not only would they have a lot of 

 crowd support but the pitches were also being prepared to 

 suit the Indian cricket team. He went as far as saying that 

 losing India in the preliminary rounds of the World Cup 

 would be financially disastrous for the organisers.

 This story repeats the well known. Commercial interests do influence cricket. Indeed, cricket is no longer a game. The moral high ground that the phrase this is not cricket represented has now changed to acquire an altogether different meaning. Today it represents a commercial sentiment: It does not make good business sense. The fulcrum of the business of cricket is undoubtedly the television rating points or the TRPs. Eyeballs delivered through the telecast of a cricket match bring in ad revenue. It is not surprising therefore that the cricket bosses are always very keen to protect and indeed nurture all variables that influence TRPs. The situation in India is obviously no different there are some very shrewd business minds involved in the administration of Indian cricket. This is where the plot thickens.

 The big news is that Sourav Ganguly is back in contention. The list of probable candidates of the Indian cricket team for the ensuing Champions Trophy has been announced. Souravs name features prominently in the list. Even a few weeks back, Souravs comeback was a pipe dream. His recent County performance did no good to his chances. Yet, he is back. How did this happen?

 Explanations are coming in from 

 all directions. Sharad Pawar, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and 

 Jagmohan Dalmiya are names being hurled as those responsible 

 for pulling the strings. The now famous e-mail from Sourav 

 to a friend before the CAB elections is being cited as the 

 turning point. The most innocuous explanation is the half-a-crore 

 Grade A contract that Sourav has with the Board.

 There can be this other explanation. Souravs ouster from the Indian cricket team created a hue and cry. The sympathy wave may have been national, but in its intensity Bengal led the chorus. Some people here even stopped watching the matches on television. 

 Did the TRPs suffer? If empirical evidence is anything to go by, TRPs may have gone down in Bengal by a notch or two. To the channel telecasting the matches, to the advertisers and most importantly to the cricket bosses, this must have been bad news. For obvious reasons, TRPs cannot be allowed to go down. Now add this drop of TRP, to the box of reasons we already have for Souravs return to the list of probables. We might start seeing a different picture altogether.

 This is a plausible theory. Is it probable? We leave that to you and your friends. Debate it this Sunday over a glass of beer. Maybe your adda will become a little spicier.

 Howrah facelift plan

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 A makeover blueprint worth Rs 1,000 crore is being drawn up for Howrah ? a move believed to be aimed at striking a balance in development on both sides of the Hooghly.

 The Howrah Rejuvenation Plan, drafted by CMDA, focuses on key urban clusters in the district, like Howrah town, Bally, Shibpur, Belur, Tikiapara, Shalimar and Uluberia.

 Officials said the chief minister had asked the urban development department to involve all state and central agencies in the makeover of Calcutta?s twin.

 The plan will be finalised after the government hears the views of town planners from both India and abroad and experts from the department for international development (DFID) at a two-day workshop from January 17. 

 British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall will attend the conference, as also planning and development minister Nirupam Sen and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 Other participants will include representatives of the railways, Calcutta Port Trust, National Highway Authority of India, CMDA, Howrah Improvement Trust and the Howrah Municipal Corporation. The Howrah Chamber of Commerce and Industry, too, has been invited to share its views. 

 ?We are exploring the Shanghai, Singapore, London and Mumbai models, that hinge on vertical growth, good connectivity and balanced development,? said an official.

 Minister Bhattacharya said: ?We have taken up the rejuvenation plan to ensure a balanced development of Howrah. We have not neglected Howrah, but there?s a need for improving its infrastructure.?

 The government is eyeing financial help from DFID and other foreign agencies. Funds will also be pumped in from budgetary allocations. The DFID, on its part, is expected to provide Rs 1 crore initially to prepare an item-wise plan.

 Despite the minister?s denial, officials concede discrimination in allocation of funds. While over Rs 2,000 crore had been spent on Calcutta?s infrastructure in the past five years, the share for Howrah has been only Rs 300 crore.

 Pumps fight to tame tides

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Friday, 2 am. Nikhil Ranjan Samanta, acting chief engineer (drainage) was attending his aunts funeral at Keoratala when the message alert on his cellphone beeped: Water level rising alarmingly at Palmer Bazar.

 Samanta ordered all 19 pumping stations in the city to switch to capacity. Eighty pumps came alive in 15 minutes and started draining out 2.5 crore gallons of accumulated water every hour.

 The city received 120 crore gallons of rainwater from 2 am to 7 am. And to make matters worse, high tide in the Hooghly set in at 8 am.

 While I was rushing to Palmer Bazar, I got a similar message from the Ballygunge pumping station, recounted Samanta, sitting in the civic control room.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay came in at 7.30 am. The control room phones kept ringing, as complaints of waterlogging poured in from Bagbazar, Cossipore, stretches of central Calcutta, Topsia, Tiljala, Behala and Jadavpur.

 The mayor asked the engineers whether portable pumps could help bring the situation under control. But, sir, where will we drain out the water? The canals and the river are flowing above the level of the low-lying areas because of the high tide, replied deputy chief engineer P.K. Dhua.

 The mayor then asked the boroughs to arrange for relief from their own funds, which would later be reimbursed.

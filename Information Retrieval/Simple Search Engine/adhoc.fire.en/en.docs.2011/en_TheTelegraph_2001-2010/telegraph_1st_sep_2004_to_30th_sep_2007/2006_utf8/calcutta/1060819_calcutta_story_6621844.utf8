 KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR

 What: 

 Kake Ke Dhaba festival. 

 Where: Red Kitchen and 

 Lounge at The Enclave in Alipore.

 When: Till August 24.

 The spread: A two-week long Punjabi festival has the place done up in highway style, complete with vibrant phulkari work, colourful kites and maps of Punjab, milestones and Bollywood posters. Do a belly shake to the beats of Malkit Singh or Daler Mehndi while you gorge on Chicken Tandoori.

 For vegetarians, chef Sarabjeet recommends Subz Tikki Delhiwali for starters and Ambala Paneer for the main course, while non-vegetarians can dig into Murg Tikki Dharampur and Dhaba Gosht. If you want more, theres Chapli Kebab, Jammu ke Rajma and Kali Dal. 

 Savour the dishes with Naan or Namak Ajwaine Paratha. Wash down your meal with Pede or Kalakand ki Lassi seasoned with saffron, served in earthen cups. For desserts, theres Badam ki Kheer.

 Pocket pinch: An average 

 meal for two would cost Rs 600.

 Voiceover: The festival 

 hopes to bring alive the dhaba culture and ambience 

 in Calcutta, said Ashim Mewar, restaurant director.

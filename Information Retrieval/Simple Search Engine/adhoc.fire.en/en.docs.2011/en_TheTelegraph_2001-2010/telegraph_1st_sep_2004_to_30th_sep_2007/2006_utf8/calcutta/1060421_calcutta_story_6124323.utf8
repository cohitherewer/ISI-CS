 Academic activity in the city and its suburbs has hit a low, with the Election Commission (EC) capturing a host of campuses for the ongoing Assembly polls.

 Rabindra Bharati University (RBU), on BT Road, where a series of exams are due next month, has been forced to shut out students.

 The academic blocks and the library have been converted into strong rooms for storing electronic voting machines and also an office for the commission staff.

 The approach to the administrative building has been blocked by a series of bamboo structures that will house the post-election counting centres.

 University registrar Santosh Kumar Ghorui fears the shutdown could even force a section of students to lose a year. ?It will also be difficult for us to complete the first and second-year curricula.?

 Describing as ?indiscriminate? the EC?s decision to take over the academic blocks and the administrative building for more than a month, Ghorui said: ?The commission did not even have the courtesy to seek our consent. I have no idea how to organise the convocation, scheduled for May 8. Besides, because of the poll personnel trooping in, we had to hire a ground in the locality for our football team to practise for an inter-university tournament.?

 Also overrun by the EC army are Uluberia College, Motijheel College, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Muralidhar Girls? College and the Hastings campus of Calcutta University, which houses the home science department.

 An official of Uluberia College said: ?The EC is issuing decrees at will. We were ordered to hand over the campus on April 14, but they took it over from April 6. I have no idea how we will cope with our academic and administrative work after this setback of the polls.?

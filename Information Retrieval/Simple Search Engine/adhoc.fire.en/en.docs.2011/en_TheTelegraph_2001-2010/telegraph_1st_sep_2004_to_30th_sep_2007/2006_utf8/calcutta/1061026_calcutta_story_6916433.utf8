 Womans body found

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The decomposed body of a middle-aged woman was found in a bush beside a closed mill near Golaghata, off VIP Road, on Wednesday evening. 

 The woman is yet to be identified. There were no injuries on the body.

 We received a complaint from local residents that a womans body was lying in a bush beside Eastern Paper Mills. The residents had gone to inspect the spot after a stench started to emanate from the bush. After preliminary investigation, it appears that the woman had died two to three days ago. It also seems that she did not belong to the locality, said North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.

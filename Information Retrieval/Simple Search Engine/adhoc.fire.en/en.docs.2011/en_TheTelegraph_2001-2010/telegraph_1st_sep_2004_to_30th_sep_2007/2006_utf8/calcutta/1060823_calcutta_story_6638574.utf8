What: Introducing The Elephant. 

Where: Swarovski outlet at Forum. 

 When: August 18.

 Take a look: The latest offering from the leading crystal brand is The Elephant, the fifth from its Numbered Limited Edition. The Elephant joins other Numbered Limited Editions from Swarovski The Eagle, The Peacock, The Wild Horses and The Bull. Numbered Limited Editions are limited pieces of crystal art available exclusively to members of the Swarovski Crystal Society, a platform for crystal lovers around the globe.

 The Elephant measuring 20.4 cm in height and 28 cm in width has been designed by Heinz Tabertshofer. It replicates a grand African bull elephant, a sign of wisdom and dynamism. Nature has always been an inspiration. Days were spent understanding an elephants psyche, its habitat, thereby capturing an impression breathtaking and grand, said V. Shiv Kumar, country manager, consumer goods business, Swarovski India Pvt Ltd, in town for the introduction on Friday.

 The gait, the swinging tail and the tusks captured by the dazzle of crystal makes The Elephant a treat for the eyes. The edition is limited to 10,000 pieces. To possess The Elephant, Swarovski Crystal Society members can fill in application forms at any Swarovski outlet. A draw of lots in October will decide the lucky owners.

 Talking about Swarovskis expansion plans, Shiv Kumar revealed that though Europe and North America continue to be the strongest consumer brackets for the brand, India and China have been identified as focus markets. In Calcutta, a second showroom in the South City mall is in the pipeline. An outlet in New Town, Rajarhat, will follow. Nationally, Swarovski will expand by almost 17 stores, added Shiv Kumar. 

 Pocket pinch: The price tag for The Elephant reads Rs 1,69,495.

 Voiceover: Last time, we had a good response from this part of the world. This time should be no different, smiled Shiv Kumar.

Banquet buzz

 What: Opening of La Mirage lounge and banquets.

 Where: Magma House, 24 Park Street, 11th floor. 

 When: August 18.

 Take a look: The latest from the Chicky Madan Catering stable after Chickys (the Ballygunge Circular Road eatery), is La Mirage.

 The sprawling 14,000 sq ft banquet has been tastefully done up. A stretch of green terrace garden with an artificial waterfall creates a pleasing setting. Italian marble flooring, traditional wooden carvings, a sober peach colour code, European paintings on the walls, wooden Rajasthani-style pillars, arches and panels lend the decor an Indo-western feel.

 There are options of throwing an open-air party on the double-deck terrace above the banquet hall. 

 There are separate entrances for the banquet and the terrace, ensuring complete privacy, says Rajat Pandit, manager, La Mirage. Also available are six well-furnished bedrooms. 

 Voiceover: The height should act to our advantage. The stunning view overlooking the city is a value-add, says Uday Madan, director, Chicky Madan Catering.

Taste talk

 What: An adda session over hilsa.

 Where: Palladian Lounge at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 When: August 17.

 The agenda: To promote positive cultural relations between West Bengal and Bangladesh, the secretary general of Bengal Chamber met celebrity couples from the Bangladesh High Commission at a socio-cultural gathering over lunch. The session began with a chat session on music, language, literature and, of course, cuisine. A basket of paper chits did the rounds and while some chose to sing songs and act out small parts, others debated on the different kinds of fish.

 Seen at the function were Qamrul Hasan, first commercial secretary, Md. Imran, deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh, and Khokan Mookerjee, secretary general of Bengal Chamber.

 Sip bite: A sumptuous Bengali spread comprising delicacies from both the Bengals greeted the group after the adda.

 Voiceover: A medium of common bond like hilsa is just one of the similarities between Bangladesh and Bengal. To bridge the gap between the two, we need to increase cultural interaction; business interaction will follow suit, said Md. Imran, deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh.

Wellness way

 What: Pranic healing workshop.

 Where: Health Shoppe on Rowland Road.

 When: August 18.

 Take a look: The workshop was presided over by Shakun Goyal, managing trustee, Pranic Healing Foundation, Delhi. The seminar touched upon topics like stress management and aromatherapy. But the focus was Pranic healing, an ancient art of healing using prana or life energy to heal the body, mind and soul.

 Shakun also highlighted ways to use the aroma range of Prana Naturals, a line of natural skin, hair and body care products. The bath salts, candles and aroma oils offer 21 aromas. The complete range is being retailed from Health Shoppe. 

 Voiceover: With so much of stress around, Pranic healing helps fight depression, tension and similar problems, explained Shakun.

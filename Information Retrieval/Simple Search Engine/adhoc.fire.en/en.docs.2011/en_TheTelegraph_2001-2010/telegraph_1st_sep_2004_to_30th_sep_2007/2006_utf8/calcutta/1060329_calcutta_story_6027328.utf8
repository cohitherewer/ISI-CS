 Three die in two mishaps

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Three persons were killed and four seriously injured in two accidents in the city and Howrah on Tuesday. 

 While the first accident occurred in the early hours, the mishap in Howrah occurred around 4.30 pm.

 A 35-year-old employee of a private security agency was killed and three others were seriously injured when the van carrying them collided with a bus. 

 The accident occurred around 5.20 am at the intersection of Raja Rammohan Sarani and Keshub Sen Street, in the Amherst Street police station area. The victim was later identified as Sanjay Rai of 46/6, Fakirbagan, Kapurgully, in Howrah.

 ?The injured are in a critical condition. We are on the look-out for the driver of the killer bus,? said an officer of Amherst Street police station.

 Since the accident occurred before 6 am, no traffic cop was posted at the intersection. But a few local residents, jolted out of their slumber by the noise of the collision, rushed to the site to find the four writhing in pain. But the bus had speeded off.

 The police were subsequently informed and the four injured were taken to Medical College and Hospital, where they were first to the emergency ward and then shifted to the medicine department in the Green Building. 

 Rai succumbed to his injuries here.

 Preliminary investigations revealed that the van was used to carry cash to the ATMs of a nationalised bank and on Tuesday, it was on its way to an ATM counter on Mahatma Gandhi Road after depositing money at one on Vivekananda Road.

 Local residents complained that the spot is accident-prone, particularly in the early hours of the day, before the traffic cops take up posts.

 Motorists drive at breakneck speed at that time, paying scant attention to students walking down Raja Rammohan Sarani to college.

 In Howrah, two unidentified persons died and another was injured when the motorcycle they were riding hit a divider on Kona Expressway, under Chatterjeehat investigation centre, police said.

 According to witnesses, the three were on their way to Nibra from Howrah and were travelling at a high speed. Neither was wearing a helmet, police said. 

 Near Bakultala More on the Expressway, the motorcycle hit a divider while trying to negotiate it. Police took the trio to hospital.

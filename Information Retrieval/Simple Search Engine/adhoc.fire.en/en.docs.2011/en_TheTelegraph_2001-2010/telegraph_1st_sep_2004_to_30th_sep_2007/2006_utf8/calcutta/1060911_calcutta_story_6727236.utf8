 Minus any Net gains 

 PRONAB MONDAL

 No Internet connection, no software and no manpower the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)s cyber crime wing has been functioning without these three key factors since it opened six months ago. 

 The department does not even have a room in which its three-man squad, comprising two sub-inspectors and a constable, can sit.

 The CID receives five to seven complaints of cyber crime every month. From the beginning, the section has two bosses a deputy superintendent (DSP) and a deputy inspector-general (DIG). But the DIG has too much on his plate.

 So, the immediate superior is the DSP, who deals with the crimes directly. Apart from the womens grievance cell, I have to look after the cyber crime wing. And we have already cracked a number of cases successfully. But a fact we cannot deny is that our job would have been much easier with an Internet connection, said DSP Neelu Sherpa Chakraborty.

 Even the computer on Sherpa Chakrabortys table does not have a Net connection. The DIGs computer is the only one that has access to the Internet.

 Officers come to my room and use my computer whenever they need it. And sometimes, I get involved with major cases directly, said Rajeev Kumar, DIG (operations). He agreed that had there been more computers with Internet connections, the job would have been smoother.

 The two officers of the specialised wing admitted that they use Kumars computer whenever they need to.

 Sometimes, we need to get access to the Internet for at least 10 times a day while handling a critical case. On such occasions, we will feel hesitant to enter the DIGs room after every half-an-hour, said an officer.

 Emphasising the importance of the wing, an officer said in the near future, crime on the Net would turn into a major problem for law-enforcing agencies. Recently, a number of incidents of cheating and fraud have taken place and victims are contacting us from various part of the state. Some swindlers are committing crimes by taking advantage of the trend to do e-shopping using credit or debit cards, he said.

 Another problem on the rise is using cellphones to commit crimes, like sending obscene SMS. We are handling the crime successfully, but it is taking time because of the non-availability of software, said the officer.

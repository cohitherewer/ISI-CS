 Zakir Hossain, 27, and Robin Hazra, 25, alias Barka, were arrested on Monday night while trying to dismantle billboards on Alipore Road and Judges Court Road. Both are residents of Mahestala. 

 ?The two were part of a racket that used to steal billboards erected at road intersections,? stated Alipore police station officer-in-charge Nanda Dulal Pal.

 After being caught, the two claimed that they had been employed by an advertising agency. ?We called the agency and came to know that they used to work there one-and-a-half years ago. They lost their jobs for stealing,? Pal added.

 Three billboards and a couple of signboards, worth about Rs 4,000, were found at the duo?s hideout.

 ?They used to sell billboards as scrap. The two confessed to stealing over 14 billboards. We are on the lookout for the other four members of the racket,? said an officer of the police station.

 What: Bhawanipur Fashionista 06, annual graduating show presented by students of fashion design and textile department of The Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College.

 Where: Swabhumi.

 When: December 16 and 17.

 Take a look: On Saturday evening, the heritage park decked up with a makeshift ramp to host the student show. The show started off well beyond the scheduled time, but the creative display by 20 final-year students made up for the long wait.

 First on the ramp was a collection from the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) before the Bhawanipur students took over. A Provogue sequence punctuated the show. On Sunday evening, another 21 students of the institute unveiled their graduating lines.

 Models Debbie, Pamela, Jessica, Priyanka Pal, Tanusree and others strutted in dramatic clothes, with the line-up heavily titled towards westerns. Golden Tree, Attitude, X-Factor, Right Calories, Society Itch the themes and inspirations were varied. The colour palette pointed towards a sober mood lots of browns, pastels, blacks, onion pinks, ocean greens and blues. Occasionally, there was a splash of fiery red or yellow.

 The students didnt give the winter element a miss. Lots of trendy coats some short, others long and jackets with interesting embellishments were seen. Dresses and skirts came in all forms, with hemlines stopping a few inches above or below the knee. Loose trousers, churi pants and capris also jostled for attention amidst balloon hemlines and sexy necklines. Patchwork, jutework, funky trimmings, sequins, beads and intricate embroidery decorated the clothes.

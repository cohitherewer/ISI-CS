 Tale of an ancient city

 Set against the backdrop of Varanasi, Kashinama (written by Kashinath Singh) tells a poignant tale of conflict between fanaticism and culture. The ancient city, formerly known as Kashi, is a silent witness to the ageless, faceless tableaux of civilizations over centuries. The play takes the audience on a metaphorical journey of the city over the last few decades, exposing the crude reality of changes that took place behind the facade of socio-economic progress. Its protagonist is the temple city that has long suffered in the name of religion. It becomes the symbol of the country on one hand and epitomises the hypocrisy and dishonesty of religious ambassadors on the other. A telling exposure of the contemporary national scenario, the play ends with a disturbing question: Are the forces of globalisation and the spirit of ancient India, as propagated by its advocates, really opposed to each other? Or are they just two sides of the same coin? Design and direction: Usha Ganguli.

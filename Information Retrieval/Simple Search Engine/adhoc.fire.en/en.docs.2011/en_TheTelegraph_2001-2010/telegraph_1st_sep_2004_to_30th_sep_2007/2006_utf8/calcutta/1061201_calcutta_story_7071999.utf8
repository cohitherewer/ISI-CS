 The ordinary altruist

 In a world ridden with greed, self-seeking and selfish interests, it is indeed strange to come across someone who devotes his life to help others. Based on a story by Maugham, Dildaar, Sayaks latest production, narrates the saga of one such man, who is neither of extraordinary talent nor blessed with great fortune. He does not even possess the power or motivation to be a hero in the war against life. Though he is an artist, he believes himself to be an ordinary worker who has inherited all the qualities of a true artist, and is free from prejudices. Though not wealthy, he tries to help the poor and the needy with all his heart and soul. He confesses that he is inspired by the philosophy of his grandfather, who was also an artist, and by Banamala, an ascetic who he is in love with. His friends and relatives find him to be strange and eccentric. Yet, a prostitute wishes to show him the path and accompany him along the journey of ultimate fulfilment. Direction: Meghnad Bhattacharya.

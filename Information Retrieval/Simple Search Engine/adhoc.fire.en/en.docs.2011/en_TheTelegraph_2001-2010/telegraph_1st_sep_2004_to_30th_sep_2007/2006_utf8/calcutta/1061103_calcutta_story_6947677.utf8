 You have already seen the colts on the ball. Next winter, you should catch the big boys on the break.

 European giant Bayern Munich, which had sent its youth squad to the IFA Shield tournament in Calcutta last November, is poised to follow it up with a visit by the professional Bundesliga side in 2007, complete with an all-star line-up of Oliver Kahn, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Lukas Podolski and Owen Hargreaves.

 Germanys flagship carrier Lufthansa, official sponsor to Bayern Munich, is kicking off its Calcutta-Frankfurt service on December 2 with three flights a week. 

 It is keen to cement its bond with the city using soccer as a common connect.

 Theres a very good possibility that the senior squad of Bayern Munich will play here next year, Werner Heesen, general manager, passenger sales India and director South Asia of Lufthansa, told Metro.

 Heesen was in town on a goodwill trip ahead of the December take-off and confirmed he was in close contact with Bayern and the club was very interested in making the trip.

 We started in a very modest way last year, when we invited the youth team of Bayern to Calcutta. If the seniors trip works out, it will be a big event, not just for the people of Calcutta but also for Lufthansa, said Heesen.

 It is learnt that the leaders of the youth team delegation really liked Calcutta and thought it was a worthwhile investment, paving the way for Felix Magaths big guns to look towards the city as a possible stop. During the winter break, they intend to come to Calcutta via Dubai... They should experience the enthusiasm and fondness for the game in this city, added Heesen.

 Lufthansa is also hopeful of coaches exchange programmes and skill-set clinics being worked out with Calcutta clubs and the IFA, just like it has done in Japan.

 Buoyed by Bengals pro-growth policy framework, the airline is keen to project Calcutta as a coming boomtown. It also wants to help in positive branding of the city our brand new baby by stressing theres much more to Calcutta (read: than the Mother Teresa connection), and by promoting the city as a potential tourist destination.

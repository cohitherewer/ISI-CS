 Romantic comedy (or ?rom com?) 

 has become a studio staple over the past 20 years: a fair 

 bet for reasonable profits, with the occasional runaway 

 success.

 The ?rom com? genre, however, 

 changes from place to place, with the romantic and the comedy 

 elements changing from country to country. For a nation 

 not renowned for its romantic prowess, Britain has proven 

 remarkably adept at producing romantic comedies that prove 

 to be successful in most corners of the globe. It all started 

 with Four Weddings and a Funeral?s phenomenal success 

 in America, with the same formula being repeated ad nauseam.

 Let us begin by looking at the 

 dynamics between the principal characters in the British 

 ?rom coms?. In Four Weddings and a Funeral, a bumbling 

 charming English gent (Hugh Grant) falls for an upfront 

 American woman. In Notting Hill, a bumbling charming 

 English gent (Grant again) falls for an upfront American 

 woman.

 As one may have noticed, writer 

 Richard Curtis is already bursting at the seams with original 

 dynamics between his lead characters. The term ?if it ain?t 

 broke?? has never been more accurately applied than to the 

 slew of recent rom coms. The progression of recent English 

 rom coms can be seen thus: they roared with laughter at 

 Four Weddings, they giggled at Notting Hill, 

 they sighed at Love Actually and they groaned at 

 Wimbledon.

 Bridget Jones? Diary and 

 its successor The Edge Of Reason is yet another example 

 of a British film trading on the foreigner?s perceptions 

 of what English people are like. Funnily enough, both films 

 also star Hugh Grant, opposite a Renee Zellweger boasting 

 one of the most astonishingly accurate English accents that 

 an American has ever affected.

 The American rom com has different 

 rules and gags. Much more blunt and slapstick, the American 

 rom com trades less on cultural differences and embarrassment, 

 and much more on what one might term ?spectacle? ? in its 

 various different forms.

 For instance, Something About 

 Mary kicks off with a man trapping his you know what 

 in his fly as he is about to embark on his high school leaving 

 prom. In Four Weddings Hugh Grant pathetically jumps 

 out of a cupboard with a pencil (?Found it!?) as two of 

 his friends are consummating their marriage, but in Something 

 you see Ben Stiller writhing around with his wedding 

 tackle fastened to his trousers.

The ?gross-out? method of comedy 

 is far more prevalent in the US than in the UK. This and 

 a wide selection of social faux pas have become the comedic 

 retort to romantic mush, and thus ingeniously keep everybody 

 happy.

 Pretty Woman has held sway 

 over two generations of young women. With its cod-Pygmalion 

 story line and Richard ?the gerbil? Gere?s strong on-screen 

 chemistry with Julia Roberts, the film was an enormous hit 

 at the box office and came to redefine the genre for the 

 dawn of the 1990s.

 One cannot underestimate the power 

 of successful TV shows on rom coms, with films like the 

 upcoming The Break-Up using Jennifer Aniston to pull 

 millions of Friends fans. The film by all accounts 

 seems to be an extrapolation of a Friends theme, 

 and will have similar traits in terms of humour.

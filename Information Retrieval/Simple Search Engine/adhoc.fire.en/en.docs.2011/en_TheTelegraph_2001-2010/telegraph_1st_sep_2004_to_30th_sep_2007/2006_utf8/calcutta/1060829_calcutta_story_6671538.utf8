 Chan, Jackie Chan 

 Jackie teaching Simi the 

 tricks of his trade in his Hong Kong office

 Simi Garewal flew to Hong Kong 

 in mid-July for a special Rendezvous with the one 

 and only Jackie Chan. Metro asked the lady in white 

 about the elastic man.

 You have mostly interviewed 

 Indian and Pakistani celebrities on your show. How did you 

 zero in on Jackie Chan?

 Also Australians... Rupert Murdoch 

 and Brett Lee! Jackie was a fairly obvious choice actually, 

 considering he is the biggest star in Asia. Actually it 

 is difficult for the western mind to comprehend the magnitude 

 of his audience. When I read a poll conducted in India as 

 to who the most popular non-Bollywood star was, Jackie came 

 first before Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts! Then I decided 

 I must really try to get him on my show.

 Where else have you travelled 

 with your crew for an interview?

 We travelled to Jayalalithas 

 place in Chennai for our Rendezvous. To Los Angeles 

 for Rupert Murdoch. To Dubai for Benazir Bhutto. To London 

 for Lakshmi Mittal. And now to Hong Kong for Jackie Chan. 

 We were six of us from Mumbai and we had gone on July 16.

 Are you a big Jackie Chan fan?

 I had seen some Jackie Chan movies 

 and enjoyed them. But when I started researching him for 

 my show I saw almost all of them. I can see why he is such 

 a big international star. I can see why his fans cut across 

 all ages, all classes and all countries.

 Have you known him before? 

 Did you met him when he came down to Mumbai earlier this 

 year?

 No. I had never met him, never 

 even seen him in real life. And prior to the actual interview 

 we just shook hands, sat down, got miked, all in approximately 

 40 seconds! So there was no communication whatsoever before 

 we rolled.

 So what was Jackie the host 

 like and the people around him?

 As I said, I barely had 40 seconds 

 before we rolled, but his staff members were most co-operative 

 and efficient. We went to the location, his office, a day 

 before for a recce to decide the camera set-ups and lighting 

 requirements. Our entire unit stayed at Hunghom Plaza in 

 Hunghom, not far from Kowloon, where his office is situated.

 My crew said they just told the 

 taxi: 145 Waterloo Road, please and the drivers responded: 

 Oh! Jackie Chan? Tourists visit this place and leave messages 

 for Jackie on the outside walls.

 What was the experience of 

 interviewing the most popular Asian star on this planet 

 like?

 You know people often tell me: 

 You know all your guests personally and thats why they 

 open up on your show. But actually there are many guests 

 I have never met prior to our interview. And certainly not 

 Jackie. And yet when you see the show, you will see how 

 easily the conversation flowed. He was wonderful, didnt 

 hide anything, didnt evade any questions. 

 He wasnt image-conscious as 

 stars often are and he gave me even more than I could 

 have asked for. He revealed things that arent even there 

 in his biography! At the end, he told me how comfortable 

 he was and that it was like a conversation not an interview. 

 He said: I speak everything the truth. Graciously, he 

 was the one who knelt and thanked me. Then he kissed me 

 and sent kisses to all our viewers.

 How would you rate the Jackie 

 Chan Rendezvous?

 Well, Id say it is definitely 

 one of the best. My crew thinks it is the best! 

 Excerpts of Chanspeak to be aired 

 on STAR World on Sunday, Sept 3, 9.30 pm

 Simi: Tell me 

 Jackie, is Hollywood the ultimate goal for an actor?

 Jackie: I think 

 yes, because its the biggest market in the world. 

 Hollywood seems the place to be. No matter you are Indian, 

 you are Chinese... Sometime I ask myself why. Why Hollywood? 

 Why Oscar? Why? You have your own Oscar, we have our own. 

 Nobody care. But why Oscar everybody care? Its Hollywood, 

 it seems like a place to be but everybody want to get into 

 Hollywood, even myself. I tried to get into Hollywood 

 So difficult.

 Simi: What about 

 your son Jaycee? 

 Jackie: Hes 

 now 23 years old.

 Simi: Did you spend time with him when 

 he was growing up? 

 Jackie: Not really. If youre talking 

 about family life, yes, I lost a lot of his childhood. But 

 in business way, Im success. You have to choose. 

 I dont think I could send him to school, pick up 

 from his school I think hes really appreciating 

 what Im doing and he really understand. Even my wife. 

 She knows my personality. She support me, even my son support 

 me.

 But the most important is beside that, the whole world, 

 Jackie Chan fans, in the Internet they really teach me a 

 lot of things. They like the movie, they dont like 

 the movie. They dont like too violent. Ok, I change. 

 I learn so many things from the fans, really.

 Simi: Jackie Chan is obsessed with his 

 work?

 Jackie: Because I am very lucky becoming 

 a Jackie Chan.

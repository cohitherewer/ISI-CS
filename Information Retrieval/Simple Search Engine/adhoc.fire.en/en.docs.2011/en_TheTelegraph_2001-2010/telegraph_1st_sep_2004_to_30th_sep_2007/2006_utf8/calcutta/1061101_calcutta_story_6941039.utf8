 Funds pledge puts paid to loan need 

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 With the Centre agreeing to fund projects worth Rs 5,000 crore under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the civic authorities might not take the Phase II loan of Rs 1,500 crore for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

 Under the Mission, 35 per cent of the project cost is borne by the Centre, while the main stakeholder bears half the expenses. Hence, for a Rs 5,000-crore project, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will have to shell out Rs 2,500 crore.

 A grant of Rs 210.7 crore has been provided under the Mission for three water supply and drainage projects in the city. The Rs 1,750 crore that the Centre is likely to come up with (for the Rs 5,000-crore project) will be addition to the earlier grant.

 We are not sure whether we will take the Rs 1,500-crore loan from the ADB for the CEIP Phase II projects. We have to re-evaluate the benefits of the ADB loan carefully, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Tuesday.

 The main plus point of financial assistance under the Mission is that it is not a loan but a grant, explained municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 Chief of municipal finance and accounts Debotosh Dasgupta stated that the civic body would have to pay back loans from international funding agencies, such as ADB, along with interest at rates in excess of 12 per cent per annum.

 Long before approaching the Centre, the CMC had applied for Rs 1,500-crore loan from the ADB for the CEIP Phase II. The ADB authorities in Manila have agreed in principle to provide the loan.

 The bank told the CMC that this time, it might provide the loan directly to the civic body or through the state government, without the Centre having to act as guarantor. 

 Work is on under the CEIP Phase I, for which a loan of Rs 1,700 crore was granted by the ADB. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2010.

 According to the mayor, financial assistance to the tune Rs 1,500 crore or more is required to make the benefits of Phase I of the CEIP accessible to about three million people living in 50 backward wards and east Calcutta. 

 It has been found that after completion of the CEIP Phase I in 2010, six wards in east Calcutta, six wards in Jadavpur, seven wards in Behala and two wards in Garden Reach will be outside the projects command area, said the mayor.

 An imbalance already exists in civic services between the city proper and the 41 wards of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, which were added to the CMC area in 1985. Without the funds, imbalances will be created even within the 41 wards, observed mayor Bhattacharyya.

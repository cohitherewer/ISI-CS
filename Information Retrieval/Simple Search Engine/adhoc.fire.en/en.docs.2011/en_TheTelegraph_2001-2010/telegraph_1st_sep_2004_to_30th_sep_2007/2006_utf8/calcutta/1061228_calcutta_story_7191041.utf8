The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Fog plays havoc on flights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Low visibility, caused by dense fog at Delhi and Dhaka airports on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, disrupted flight schedules, resulting in abnormal congestion at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.

 The runway visual range (RVR) at Delhi airport was very low last night and early today, said an official of Calcutta airport. At least five Delhi-bound flights were cancelled on Monday night and rescheduled for Tuesday morning, causing congestion in Calcutta.

 The rescheduling of the flights caused a chain effect, resulting in an average delay of 45 minutes in services. The situation is slowly returning to normal, the official added.

 Airport director V.K. Monga confirmed that flights to and from Delhi and Dhaka were disrupted on Tuesday because of fog.

 A Saudi Arabian Airline flight from Jeddah to Dhaka had to make an unscheduled landing in Calcutta at 4 am on Wednesday because of dense fog. The passengers were reportedly kept on board for a long time. 

 Since the airline does not operate from Calcutta, we needed some time to make arrangements for them, said an airport official.

 The passengers were reportedly agitated and a CISF team cordoned off the plane. The airport authorities clarified that the situation was under control. The flight left for Dhaka at 11 am.

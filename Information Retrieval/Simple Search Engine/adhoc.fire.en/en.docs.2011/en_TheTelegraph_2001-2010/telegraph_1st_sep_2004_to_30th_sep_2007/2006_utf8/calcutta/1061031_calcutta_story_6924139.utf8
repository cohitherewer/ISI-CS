 Winter wows in beauty basket

Creamy textures, warm colours... Celebrity 

make-up artist MICKEY CONTRACTOR lets Shradha Agarwal in on make-up trends and 

secrets for the cold weeks ahead

Make-up, like all things in fashion, takes a seasonal 

swing. Creamy textures in place of all things powdery. Warm colours instead of 

summery shades...

 GoodLife takes you beyond the basics as Mickey Contractor, celebrity make-up artist and director of cosmetic major MAC India, reveals his secrets. Find out what makes up the make-up palette of winter 2006, the top trends and more.

Diffusion details

 The biggest trend this season is a diffused look that shows no fine lines. No eyeliners, no lipliners and no lines of streaky make-up figure in this form.

 No feature is screaming for attention. The look is calm and serene, very close to the fresh-face feel of Isha Koppikar in Don, says Mickey. 

 Heres how to get it right:

Clean face and moisturise well. A dewy complexion is a pre-requisite.

Use colours that are neutral and close to your skin tone. 

The lips are almost nude. 

Use creamy blush and eye make-up.

No sharp lines are seen on the face.

Retro rocks 

 Another hot trend this winter is retro rage, like a throwback to the good ol days. Retro influences appear on the face in two styles. The first look, quite like MACs Dolce Vita, is about dark eyes, false lashes and loads of mascara. Its very Sophia Loren in style dark eyes and a pale face. The lips can be a hint of peach-coral, says Mickey. 

 Red lips are the second retro glimpse this season. A deep red is a must in every womans wardrobe. It can be creamy, matte, glossy but it just has to be very red, says Mickey. Those with inhibitions may take inspiration from Madonna, Gwen Stefani and Rekha.

Eye appeal

 The eyes continue to be in focus this winter. After seasons of undisputed attention, the smoky saga takes a backseat this time and the eye story travels beyond. The gaze lingers on the eyebrows and eyelashes. Heres how:

Brow beauty 

 Remember Kajols full brows? Well, like it or not, this time it comes around like a style statement by itself. This trend, illustrated by MACs Masque Femininity look, is an almost masculine feel. It is a very edgy look but unless done perfectly, it can go unnoticed too, says Mickey.

 Heres how to recreate the Masque Femininity feel: 

Thread the eyebrows close to their natural shape. 

Use transparent mascara to shape them. Strokes should be upward. 

Eyes are bare. No eyeliners and not much colour either. 

Contour face strongly after dabbing foundation. 

Mouth is kept bare. 

 Lash lustre 

 Eyelashes are all set to have some fun this winter. Colour, glitter and more make an entry this season.

 Ditch the black mascara for coloured ones. Use them adventurously, wildly, keeping an eye on the aesthetics all through, says Mickey. Glitter on the eyelids is a hot trend. But let some glitter fall on your eyelashes, adds Mickey. 

 Nothing in this look is right or wrong. It pushes your limit and is quite OTT (over the top). Go with the flow and the brush strokes but finesse is super-essential in this cutting-edge trend, says Mickey.

Winter wows 

 Mickey draws up a beauty guideline for the coming winter months. 

Moisturise, moisturise and moisturise. The most essential element in winter is 

to keep the skin hydrated. Nothing works better than a soft, dewy face.

Use cream blush on the cheeks. The creamy texture blends well into the skin and 

the glow seems natural, coming from within.

Use cream shadow for the eyes. The powdery look doesnt complement the harsh 

weather. 

Use a lip conditioner before lipstick. A lip gloss doesnt lend moisture 

to the lips, it only gives a moist effect.

Stay away from matte lip colours. Experiment with shades but keep the texture 

creamy or glossy.

Finally, always remember it is better not to look fashionable than to look 

like a clown this winter.

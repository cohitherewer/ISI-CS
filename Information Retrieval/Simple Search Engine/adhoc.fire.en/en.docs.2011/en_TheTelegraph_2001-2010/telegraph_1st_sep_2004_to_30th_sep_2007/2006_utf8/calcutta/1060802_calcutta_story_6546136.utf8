 The evening began with Rabindrasangeet and a dance presentation by Srijani, a Rabindrik cultural organisation that explored the classical to the contemporary, from Tagore to Joy Goswami. 

 Lopamudra Mitra with her repertoire of Bengali songs took stage next, accompanied by the tabla, keyboard, guitar and octopad.

 A special Bengali buffet dinner replete with Bhapa Elish and Malpua ended the cultural event.

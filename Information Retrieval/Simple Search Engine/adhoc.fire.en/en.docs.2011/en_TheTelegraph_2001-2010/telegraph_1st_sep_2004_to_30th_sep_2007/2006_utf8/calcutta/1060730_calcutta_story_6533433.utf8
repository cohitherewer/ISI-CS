 Party Time

 What: Ladies Night. 

 Where: Venom, the nightclub 

 at Fort Knox. 

 When: Wednesday night. 

 The bash: The ladies 

 special series at Venom saw a wrap-up on Wednesday night; 

 a season finale, if you please.

 An action-packed kick-off by Mumbai-based 

 male performers, salsa and merengue dance workshops by expert 

 Aditya Upadhyay and beauty treats by salon Squeeze ? Venom 

 saw it all on Wednesday nights, 9 to 11.

 The sign-off evening saw ladies 

 in the house downing free-flowing cocktails, heady shots 

 or wine. And then, of course, the action shifted to the 

 dance floor.

 Voiceover: Ladies 

 Night was a huge success and we hosted 150 ladies on an 

 average each Wednesday. I am convinced that Calcutta has 

 gone way beyond the free-drinks hook and we promise to be 

 back with a twist, soon, said Bunty Sethi of Venom. 

 Guests at the Mischief 

 Mongers Nite at Cloud 9 on Friday night. 

 Mischief mood

 What: Mischief Mongers 

 Nite.

 Where: Cloud 9.

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: The party kicked 

 off with unlimited supply of White Mischief vodka and snacks, 

 while the DJ spun out the latest tracks at the console.

 Voiceover: White 

 Mischief is targeted at young people who have a mischievous 

 streak in them. We ran a contest on Red FM asking people 

 what was the most mischievous thing they had ever done. 

 The winners of the contest made it to the party, said 

 a spokesperson for White Mischief.

 Music mantra

 What: Fusion Beats with 

 DJ Sammy and percussionist K. Mohan.

 Where: Roxy at The Park.

 When: Friday night.

 The beat: The dynamic duo 

 played electric sets for one hour each. The electric house 

 music combined with percussion beat ensured quite a fusion 

 of sorts.

 The audience took it well ? some 

 sat back and lapped it up, while others danced away to the 

 beats. Its important for me to create a difference 

 with my sound, said K. Mohan, percussionist and lead 

 singer of popular bands Sankara (now Agnee) and Change of 

 Plan.

 The city reverberates with 

 an aura that is unique in itself, and Roxy is the perfect 

 setting to experiment with different sounds. The unique 

 ambience, feel and mood of the place complement the uniqueness 

 of this recipe of music, added the Calcutta boy, now 

 based in Mumbai. 

 Voiceover: Roxy is 

 very distinctive in terms of ambience, decor and feel and 

 we want to keep the events and promotions equally distinctive 

 here. DJ Sammy knows the mood of the Calcutta audience and 

 he synchronises perfectly with Mohan to create just the 

 right sound that people love, said Nilekha Mungi, 

 manager of Roxy.

 Fix-it rap for crater corridor 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Housing minister Goutam Deb on Tuesday asked officers of Bridge and Roof Company (India) Limited, contractor of New Town-Airport Road, to repair the cratered connector at its own cost immediately .

 Deb, who is also chairman of the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), implementing agency of New Town, held a meeting with officers of the company along with engineers of Hidco and the housing department.

 I have asked the contractor to repair the road immediately at its own cost. I have shown its officials the report of the Sadhan Banerjee committee, set up to look into the cause of the damage, which has pointed out lapses on the part of the contractor, Deb said after the meeting.

 He said major repair work could not be undertaken right now owing to the monsoon. I have asked the contractor first to repair the potholes to ensure smooth traffic movement and then take up the major repairs. Work will have to start latest by August 15 and be completed within a fortnight, Deb said.

 He said the Sadhan Banerjee committee has recommended that the upper surface of the road be strengthened along the entire stretch. The contractor will have to abide by this, Deb said. 

 He admitted that the guarantee period of the road is over but insisted that this was of no consequence.

 Noose closes on murder mastermind

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After arresting the alleged killer, the police are zeroing in on the person who had reportedly masterminded the murder of Trinamul leader Sachin Mukherjee.

 ?We are looking for Biswajit Debnath. He not only plotted the murder, but also hired the killer,? S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said on Friday.

 ?Debnath was once a close associate of Mukherjee. After interrogating a number of persons, including Biswajit Saha, who was arrested in the Regent Park area on Thursday, we became sure of Debnath?s role,? he added.

 On Friday, police raided the telephone booth in Garia, from which calls were made to Mukherjee?s cellphone minutes before he was gunned down on Sunday evening.

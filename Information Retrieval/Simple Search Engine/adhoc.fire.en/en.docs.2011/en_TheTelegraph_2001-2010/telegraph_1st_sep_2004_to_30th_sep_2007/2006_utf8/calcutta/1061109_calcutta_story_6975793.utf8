 More than a thousand packed into a hall that could barely hold 400. Serpentine queues outside, swelling by the minute. Over a hundred with valid invites denied entry for lack of space. Jostling teenagers desperately seeking a pass.

 Calcutta is used to such a crowd crush, but only when a Big B or a King Khan makes an appearance in a live show at a stadium or a cineplex.

 Live show it was on Tuesday evening, but the venue was Indian Association for Cultivation of Science and the master of the ceremony was Sir Roger Penrose, one of the greatest physicists and cosmologists, holding forth on what else Big Bang.

 By the time Sir Roger was almost halfway through his mesmerising version of the origin of the universe, the guard at the gate yelled: There is absolutely no space inside, we cannot let in anyone else. He feared a law and order breakdown, just as what happened at Science City during a music talent hunt a few months ago.

 Inside the auditorium, as expected, the huge audience listened in rapt attention as the celebrated scientist spoke on Beyond the Big Bang. The lecture was organised by British Council to mark the birth anniversary of CV Raman.

 There existed another universe before the Big Bang. Our universe emerged from it, stated Sir Roger. 

 With the elan of a musician shifting from one instrument to another, he sailed from Einsteins Theory of Relativity to the Weyl curve hypothesis to establish his point.

 And there was no laptop, online data or power-point presentation. Sir Rogers only prop was the near-extinct overhead projector. 

 I think learning one technology is good enough in one life, he said earlier.

 Penrose, who had once agreed that there was nothing before the Big Bang, began to contest the theory in the past couple of years.

 According to the conventional belief in astronomy and physics, our universe has a beginning the Big Bang. Before that there was nothing.

 The standard theory is that our universe sprang into life as singularity around 13.7 billion years ago. Singularities are zones which defy our understanding of physics.

 It was an amazing experience listening to Sir Roger, said physicist Partha Ghosh. I am particularly pleased to notice the immense interest among the people, especially the younger generation, in basic science and the universe. It shows that if explained properly, pure science can still evoke excitement. 

 We have come from Asansol to hear this lecture and it was unbelievable, said school student Debasish Majumder. So was the turnout.

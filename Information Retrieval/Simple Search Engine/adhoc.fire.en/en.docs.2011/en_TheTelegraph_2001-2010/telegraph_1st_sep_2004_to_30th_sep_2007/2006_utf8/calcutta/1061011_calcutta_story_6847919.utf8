Life

 A few good men, sexy and suave

 On the Big Bs 

 64th birthday, GoodLife picks a few salt 

 n pepper heartthrobs who continue to rock with 

 their charm 

 Amitabh Bachchan

 DoB: October 11, 1942.

 Blow the candles, cut the cake 

 and sing the song. Its another Happy Birthday 

 to Mr Bachchan. From one of the Saat Hindustani to 

 the lone guardian in Eklavya, the legend continues 

 to grow. Beating back the flops, becoming the biggest star 

 in the 70s and 80s, then losing the plot in the 90s and 

 then rising again in the new millennium, the Big B has almost 

 come to epitomise timelessness.

 So even when he flirts with Kirron Chandigarh Kher in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna at 64, he carries it off with the aplomb that son Abhishek can only aspire to match. No wonder still everyone from Hema Malini (Babul) to Jiah Khan (Nisshabd) strives to be his screen love.

 Heres to the 64-year-young Sexy Sam. Thats the way, we like it...

 Pierce Brosnan

 DoB: May 16, 1953.

 From Remington Steele to James Bond to Thomas Crown, he has shaken and stirred our imagination of the man with the golden gun. Who can forget his fixing of the tie after blowing up an entire civilisation from inside his tanker as 007? Cool never looked cooler on screen.

 And even as he grows old, Brosnan continues to bond with the best, picking and choosing his roles. An outspoken environmentalist and a crusader against breast cancer, our world is surely not enough without this Stylebhai.

 Richard Gere 

 DoB: August 31, 1949. 

 Most hearts went hop, skip and jump as he serenaded Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Its been 16 years and little seems to have changed. Whether he is tap-dancing with Catherine Zeta-Jones in Chicago or ball-room dancing with Jennifer Lopez in Shall We Dance, Gere romances three generations with his charm. An officer, a gentleman, a gigolo, this man sure has a way with women.

 And when the same man fights against AIDS, you cant stop your heart from going out to him. Declared the Sexiest Man Alive in 1999, seven years on, he remains the thinking womans turn-on.

 George Clooney

 DoB: May 6, 1961.

 Hes on this list only because of his prematurely grey hair that adds so much to his sex appeal. He first caught our eye as Dr Doug Ross on television show ER and hasnt dropped out since as we tracked him right through Oceans Eleven to (in the pipeline) Oceans Thirteen. 

 Under that sexy grey hair, the mans got some hyperactive grey cells. From the psychological Confessions of a Dangerous Mind to the political Good Night, and Good Luck, Clooney the director has been right on the dot. 

 And who doesnt like a handsome man who speaks his mind? Clooneys comments on the Iraq war We cant beat anyone anymore and his legendary Golden Globe speech Who would name their kid Jack with the word off at the end of your last name? has just earned him more Brownie points. And to think Clooney initially wanted to get into professional baseball!

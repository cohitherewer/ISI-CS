The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 ?I had got bored of acting?

 Screen On amp; Off

 NASEERUDDIN SHAH tells Pratim D. 

 Gupta about his ?insatiable itch? to make movies

 When did you first decide to turn director?

 I had been nursing the thought 

 for quite a while. For the last 10 years or so, this desire 

 was growing. I had just got bored of acting in movies. There 

 was an insatiable itch to do this for the last five years.

 So what took you this long?

 Water finds its own level and 

 I was just waiting for things to happen. It was Paresh Rawal 

 who brought me this script written by a friend of his, Uttam 

 Gada. It just had a plot outline and a synopsis. There were 

 four stories which were unconnected but ended together. 

 That connected with me instantly and we set about developing 

 the script.

 This was also the first time you were writing a script?

 That?s right. My co-writer Riju 

 Bajaj and I got around four months to rework the script. 

 Now, we wish we had more time but the money came in very 

 suddenly. Once the project got the green light, we had to 

 start straightaway. We started shooting Yun Hota To Kya 

 Hota last year on July 20 and we plan to release the 

 film this July 21.

 When you were reworking the script, did you have the actors 

 in mind?

 Konkona Sen Sharma 

 and Jimmy Sheirgill in Yun Hota To Kya Hota; 

 (Top). Ayesha Takia in the film 

 It all started with Paresh and 

 so, the script was written with him in mind. But then I 

 preferred to see him differently. I wanted him to adapt 

 to the part rather than just play the way he is expected 

 to play. So, I rewrote his section with that in mind. Irrfan 

 was another actor whom I had cast in my mind while writing 

 the script. The rest I decided to cast later, after looking 

 at the script in totality.

 So, what is Yun Hota To Kya Hota about?

 The film looks at the US as the 

 common dream. Of course, it?s a comment on the land of opportunities. 

 All these people from different strata of society want to 

 migrate to the US, where they believe things get sorted 

 out. And so we have these various perspectives and attempts 

 to go to America and how all these separate stories collide 

 in the end.

 What was the experience of going behind the camera like?

 Exhausting, among other things. 

 I don?t think I want to repeat it in a hurry. I know my 

 shaky areas and I do not wish to repeat those mistakes in 

 my next film. So I want to take a little time, try and develop 

 those areas, take better advice on the scripting before 

 making another film.

 How did your star cast treat you on the sets?

 They gave me a little too much 

 of respect (laughs). And that really got tiresome. 

 I just wanted them to relax and give their best. They were 

 never on test in front of me. Finally they did manage to 

 settle down.

 Did you act the scenes out for them?

 No, no, I never demonstrated any 

 scene. That?s never a good idea. Every actor has his or 

 her own way of expression and they should never be dictated. 

 I chose the best actors around and just let them be themselves.

 You have got this mix of commercial stars like Ayesha 

 Takia and non-mainstream actors like Konkona. Is your film 

 also trying to bridge the gap?

 I really don?t know these bridges 

 and forms and movements. It?s really too early to label 

 cinema like this. There?s just good films and bad films. 

 And I hope Yun Hota To Kya Hota represents good cinema.

 Do you fear the film being watched only by the intelligentsia?

 I am quite sure that it?s not 

 going to get into the interiors of Bihar. The film has not 

 been made with that sensibility. Maybe a Karan Johar or 

 a Rakesh Roshan can do that ? making films for everyone. 

 But I won?t be disappointed if Yun Hota To Kya Hota 

 is not seen in the smaller towns. It is primarily a metro 

 film expected to run in multiplexes.

 Do we bid adieu to Naseeruddin Shah the actor?

 Not at all. I intend to continue 

 acting. Maybe more on stage than movies. Now, it is the 

 stage which stimulates me more than films.

 And what films would we get to see you in?

 I have done a small part in Vishal 

 Bhardwaj?s Omkara, supporting the project more than 

 anything else. The two films I am looking forward to this 

 year are Pan Nalin?s Valley of Flowers and Rahul 

 Dholakia?s Parzania. I will also be doing Rajat Kapoor?s 

 next film Mithiya, where Neha Dhupia is paired opposite 

 me.

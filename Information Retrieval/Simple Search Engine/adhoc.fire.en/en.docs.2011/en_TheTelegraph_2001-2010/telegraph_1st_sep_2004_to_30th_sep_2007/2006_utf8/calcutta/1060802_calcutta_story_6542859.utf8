 White metal wonders

 From chunky oxidised 

 pieces to shiny ones studded with stones, silver jewellery 

 is the flavour in accessory fashion. Poulomi Banerjee 

 tunes in to the trend 

 Not a poor mans gold anymore. White shine is what the fashion conscious is after. Team it with coloured stones, beads or wood, or go for the chunky ethnic effect, but if its stylish accessories that you are after, silver is the metal to sport. 

 Silver has made a huge comeback, says jewellery designer Suhani Pittie. There are many things in its favour. While one advantage is that it is less expensive, it is also a metal that is easy for jewellers to work on, she explains.

 Most stones, she says, look good when set against silver. The 1990s have been the era of accessories and silver has seen a huge boom, she adds.

 Whether it is filigree work from Cuttack, or banjara pieces from Rajasthan, or new-age designs, city-based jewellery designer Vasundhara Mantri believes the craze for silver has gone up sharply in the past two years. Since it is not exorbitantly priced, one advantage is that you can use it for regular wear. Its not locker jewellery. Silver today is for stylish people, says Vasundhara. 

 She thinks the recent stress on all things desi has fired the rage for silver. It has been fuelled by more and more celebrities sporting silver today. The ethnic look of kurtas paired with jeans and kohl-lined eyes goes best with silver accessories, feels Vasundhara.

 Designers say that while Cuttack, Jodhpur, Kashmir and Hyderabad to an extent were traditionally known for their silver jewellery, the boom has led to silver trinkets being sourced from all over Rajasthan and Gujarat, too. Some designers are increasingly working with karigars from Bengal for their craftsmanship. 

 Vasundhara adds that apparel designers have recognised the passion for silver and are making clothes that look best with silver accessories. I did a whole line of silver jewellery recently to complement Kiran Uttam Ghoshs collection for the Rome Fashion Week, she says.

 Pop pick

 Bracelets, earrings, toe-rings, anklets and chunky chokers are the most in-demand items in silver. And while even a few years ago, ethnic, chunky and oxidised pieces were the most sought after, options today are limitless. Tribal designs were the only stylish choice earlier. But the movement away from the oxidised look and the availability of trendy designs in white silver have opened the market, says Suhani.

 She uses textured silver and stones for a raw, rough look that is ethnic yet sophisticated. You can either make a very sober piece, or a gorgeous yet classy one for a night-out, by blending crystals and coloured stones with silver. These designs suit the 20 to 40 age group of urban women very well, who wouldnt want to wear gold all the time, adds the designer. 

 Global glory

 India is not the only country to have woken up to the beauty of silver. Designer Varda Goenka of Diagold, who works mainly with coloured stones and diamonds on silver for everyday wear jewellery, says that it is an international obsession now. 

 Across the world, people are rediscovering silver. The market has been booming for the past three years with at least a 30 per cent per year increase, she says. 

 Demand graph

 The shops selling silver jewellery have felt the effect. Last year my shop witnessed a rise of 100 per cent in the demand for silver jewellery, smiles Mahesh Punjabi of Heritage, a shop in New Market. 

 Silver is an amazing metal and very stylish, it is for someone who enjoys wearing jewellery and not buying it for its investment value. All coloured stones look better against silver than gold, and you will notice that craftsmen too bring out their best designs on silver, he adds. 

 Says Vashi Barwani of Asian Arts, another shop in the same area: Even junk that was so popular just a few years back is not so much in demand as silver. From chunky pieces to delicate trinkets, everything that is in silver is a rage. 

 Says Tseringyangki of Chamba Lama, the accessories treasureland of the city: Thankfully theres always been a section of artistically inclined people in Calcutta who have appreciated our ethnic designs. But yes, many more people have become charmed by silver recently.

 In keeping with the times, Chamba Lama has evolved from mainly ethnic designs to include trendier jewellery. Usually people buy both ethnic and trendy jewellery, for today no one sticks to one particular way of dressing.

 So whether its a sari or a sarong that you are in, go silver this season.

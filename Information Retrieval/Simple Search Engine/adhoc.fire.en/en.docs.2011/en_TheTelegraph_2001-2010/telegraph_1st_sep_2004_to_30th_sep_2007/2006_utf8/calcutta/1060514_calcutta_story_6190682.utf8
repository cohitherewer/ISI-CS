 How much is too much

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 We all know of at least one couple 

 at our favourite nightclub that invariably crosses the frontiers 

 of PDA (public display of affection, of course) and tresspasses 

 into the tricky area of PDEA (public display of extra affection, 

 of course). 

 A nightclub is meant to get lovers young and old going, but some just do not know when and where to draw the line already blurred by thumping beats, free-flowing liquids, ill-lit interiors and the cool comfort of anonymity.

 Where else, pray, does this city allow lovers the space to just be themeslves? 

 But what we see today at the nightclubs is, ironically, far less than what the city has seen in the recent past.

 Seven years ago, when people were so lost in the then new nightclub culture, they didnt know what not to do. Thankfully the scene is much better now. People are more in control and the people around are also that much more open, overlooking a lot of things that they wouldnt have looked through then, feels Bunty Sethi, proprietor of Venom.

 Presenting, a GoodLife guide to smart and non-objectionable PDA.

 Do

 Look before you leap. It is an age-old saying but remains relevant even in todays e-zones. What could seem like a safe second to sneak in that kiss could unexpectedly run into rough weather if moms sisters friend is gaping. So, look around and look again when you feel that irresistible urge to seal it with a kiss.

 Cuddle up and hold hands 

 if you want to, suggests actress June. A light kiss 

 is also okay in a nightclub where everyones idea is 

 to let their hair down, she feels. So if the atmosphere 

 is very private and only friends are around, a little bit 

 of affection is perfectly permissible.

 Set your own limits. Remember 

 that you are your best moral police, why depend on others 

 to keep you on a leash? Anyway, our security guys 

 and bartenders are instructed to keep a constant eye on 

 the number of drinks and behaviour of the guests, 

 says Bunty. 

 SMS your feelings. Intimacy 

 does not mean holding hands anymore. In todays day 

 and age, affection is rather displayed through the SMS, 

 laughs Salmoli Mukerji, director public relations at The 

 Park. So sit as close as can be, and keep SMSing your desires 

 to keep out of harms way.

 Dont 

 Stretch your personal moment to more than a moment. If it is long enough for people to notice; then you can expect a rude objection to come your way, warns Bunty.

 Lock lips or jump on each 

 other. It is too much for our community to handle, 

 says Salmoli.

 Cross the line from affection to lust. Though some display of affection and love is okay with most nighclub officials ? and crowds ? the slightest step beyond could mean asking for trouble. 

 Dodge people to steal 

 some private and intimate moments in the restrooms. Though 

 some zones like the dance floor are safer than others like 

 the couches,where you will invariably attract more prying 

 eyes, never assume that youre alone. Remember that 

 you are being watched ? always, everywhere.

 If matters still get out of hand, then the nightclub managers have full authority to step in. And if a stern behave yourselves doesnt work, prepare to be shown the door, impassionately.

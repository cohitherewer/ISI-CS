 Adapted from Arthur Miller?s A View from the Bridge, Gotraheen deals with the theme of displacement, destitution and rootlessness. Confronting the audience with a disturbing reality that poses a persistent threat to civilization the world over, the play also tries to evaluate people?s efforts to come to terms with it. Seen against the context of illegal Bangladeshi migrants seeking refuge in the city, the play uncovers problems more of a social and emotional nature rather than a political one. For obvious differences in geographical and political setting, the shelter-seekers from across the border in Gotraheen do not resemble Miller?s Sicilians in search of an identity on foreign shores. Yet, their difference is only superficial, for both speak the language of the homeless and the hapless. On ultimate analysis, Nandikar?s play is a tragic love story where all the characters are basically good-natured, but are compelled by circumstances to act otherwise. Direction: Rudraprasad Sengupta.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Gotraheen, produced by Nandikar 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

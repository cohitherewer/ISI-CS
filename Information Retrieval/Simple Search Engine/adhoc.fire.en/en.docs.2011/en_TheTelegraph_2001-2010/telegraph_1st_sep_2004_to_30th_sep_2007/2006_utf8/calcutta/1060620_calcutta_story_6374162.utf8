 The City Diary

 The city and its adjoining areas suffered prolonged power cuts on Monday evening, with the shortfall in the CESC-served areas touching 160 mw. Sources attributed the disruption to the state electricity board?s curb on its supply to the CESC grid. After 7 pm, the board supplied 270 mw to the CESC system. This led to power cuts, ranging from one to one-and-a-half hours.

 dmitting that the situation was dismal, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said central sector units had supplied poorly to the board grid. ?We are trying to start another 210-mw unit in Kolaghat on Tuesday. We are faced with inferior quality coal there. A 500-mw unit collapsed in Farakka and a 210-mw unit tripped in Kahalgaon. DVC is not supplying the 200 mw it is supposed to contribute to the board grid,? said Banerjee.

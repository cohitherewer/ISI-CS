 Eleven-year-old Sayantan Ganguly, student of a south Calcutta school, is upset with his mother. A tiff over tiffin he takes to school snowballs into a major fight, and Sayantan tries to hang himself.

 Taken from a doctor?s case diary, this is just one of several incidents of so-called trivial issues, like the content of a tiffin box, becoming the reason for a bitter fight between a mother and her child, often ending in a disaster.

 ?If you want to help your child handle his problems, you can start with the tiffin box,? says psychiatrist R. Ghosh Roy. ?We often come across cases where an unimaginative mother keeps giving the same food to the child. What happens is that the child starts thinking the boy next to him enjoys a better life. This often develops into an inferiority complex.?

 Child psychologists and nutritionists in the city have joined hands to make parents aware that ?little problems? at home need to be sorted out quickly.

 ?Kids can be very difficult with their eating habits. A mother should try to give her child food that looks exciting and tempts him to eat. There should, however, be no compromise on nutrition. The food should be both tasty and healthy, and should also appeal to the eyes,? says nutritionist Anuradha Mullick.

 Psychologist Bhargavi Chatterjee Bhattacharya of Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre thinks a child has a tendency to believe his tiffin is inferior to that of his classmates. 

 ?And quite often, after a child returns home from school, the mother finds remnants of a different meal in the tiffin box. This is what happens if you keep giving your child the same items for days on end. And there is every possibility of a child developing an inferiority complex if this continues for long,? says Bhattacharya.

 Nutritionists suggest: 

 If your child doesn?t like the regular brown bread, pick up bread rolls or add home-made mayonnaise to the sandwich

 Spice up rice, as it makes a great tiffin. Vegetable pulao or tomato/sambhar rice are just two examples. One can also consider brown rice, as it is nutritious 

 Wheat noodles can add a twist to the everyday healthy roti. Wheat noodles are tasty and children also love the texture. Noodles with vegetables (carrot, peas or capsicum) is a hit with kids

 Egg sandwich is another option. Protein-rich eggs help build and repair cells

 Salads are an excellent way of providing complete nutrients to a child. Watermelon and papaya cubes, kiwi and apple slices, strawberries and grapes make a tasty fruit salad.

 Music e-dream come true

 Browse and sample millions of songs, pick your favourites, make the payment and download them on to your PC. Carry the tunes in your portable music player, burn them on to a CD or do anything else you please. Without breaking a single cyber law.

 If this electronic dream of the iPod generation in India was a distant one so long, Saregama?s latest efforts could make it real. The RPG Enterprises-owned music company is opening its online music store next month, where songs can be bought for as little as Rs 12 each.

 ?It?s part of our new plan to reconfigure the business. More people are listening to music than ever before and they are listening to more music. What better time to build on our core competencies than now?? asks Subroto Chattopadhyay, president amp; CEO of RPG Enterprises-Entertainment Sector.

 At the heart of that effort is 

 the digitisation of Saregama?s music collection of some 

 300,000 tracks dating back to the dawn of the 20th Century. 

 ?We have content in 23 languages and in every genre,? says 

 Chattopadhyay. And the online music store is just one of 

 the vehicles to deliver chunks of that digital goldmine.

 ?It?s a 360-degree approach. Surfers can download songs for a price, listen to music streams through the Internet radio and even participate through blogs,? Chattopadhyay explains.

 The opportunity before Saregama is huge, considering the success of digital downloads ? Apple?s super successful iTunes music store has seen over 1 billion songs downloaded since its inception in 2003 ? coupled with the fact that companies like Apple, Yahoo! and Microsoft are yet to extend their online music services to India.

 ?There are 200 million Indians overseas, with some 70-80 million Bengalis among them? By September, we will have an idea of the kind of numbers we?re looking at,? admits Chattopadhyay.

 Saregama had put up a selection of 40,000 songs on iTunes three years back and received a ?very good? response. Now its own online store is in the test phase and the company is looking at an end-August launch date.

 ?We are partnering with content providers around the world, including Bangladesh and Pakistan. When the new batch of FM stations comes up in the country, we will be ready with the content to feed them. There are plans for value-adds like mobile phone downloads, too.?

 But the risk of offering music online ? read piracy ? needs to be taken into account, too. ?Policing can get you only this far. We will, instead, launch a consumer awareness programme to check piracy,? offers Chattopadhyay.

 The company is on an expansion spree with offices being set up in Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Cochin, Shillong and ?Lahore, hopefully?. The hunt is also on for ?young, fresh talent? to manage artiste, repertoire and the crucial technology.

 ?We?re looking at sustainable growth in a solid way, successful innovation-driven marketing and a significant market share,? sums up Chattopadhyay.

 Along with Saregama investors, that should be music to the ears of every listener, Gen-ex to GenX.

 Of raisin, reason amp; risk

 He doesn?t know Bengali, but the first production Brian Russo directed for the Calcutta stage was Shalbonir Sankat. That was two years ago and the cast comprised students of Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) where Russo was a visiting lecturer on a Fullbright scholarship. The American is back in town, this time to steer an American play at the behest of American Center.

 Lorraine Hansberry?s poignant play about racial discrimination, A Raisin in the Sun, is being produced by the Center in collaboration with Spandan. ?A Raisin in the Sun is one of the best plays showing American family life, like The Death of a Salesman and A Long Day?s Journey into Night,? says Russo, who teaches theatre at Gonzaga University in Washington and also directs student plays. His favourites are Shakespeare and Arthur Miller.

 A Raisin in the Sun mirrors African-American life in America, revolving around a lower-middle class family in the 1950s struggling to break out of its cramped living conditions. With a bunch of nine actors and a 10-year-old boy ? all picked from among 50-60 after auditions in Calcutta ? Russo is immersed in intense rehearsals in a first-floor room in the Spandan office on Park Street.

 ?I was looking for actors with the willingness to take risks and challenges, with emotional vulnerability and those who knew good English,? he says. The actors, all of them with a theatre background, are working on their American accents with tapes and the diction is ?getting better by the day?. 

 The cast has been practising six hours a day, six days a week. So far, it?s been only a week and a half. ?I am working on their voice, accent and body movements before getting on with the rehearsals,? explains Russo.

 The two-hour-and-a-half-long play will be staged on July 28 and 29 at Gyan Manch. The set, to be designed by Santanu Roy of RBU, will reflect a poor American apartment with the Chicago cityscape as the backdrop. Dana Roy will design the costumes. 

 A Raisin in the Sun will also stage shows at GD Birla Sabhagar, following which a tour of Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore is likely to take off.

 During his earlier stage stint in Calcutta, Russo had also directed A Midsummer Night?s Dream with students of RBU and Loreto College. ?I even saw a little bit of group theatre. Everywhere it?s the same. In America too, to put bread on the table, theatre actors work in films and TV,? he observes.

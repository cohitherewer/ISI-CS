 Alumni celebrate with dinner date

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The St Xavier?s College Calcutta Alumni Association will host its annual reunion dinner on Saturday at the college campus. This year?s dinner is expected to be ?extra special?, as the alumni association will also be celebrating its 20th year. 

 Imran Zaki Siddiqui, general secretary of the alumni association, said: ?Celebrating 20 years of our existence is simply amazing, especially considering the humble beginnings of the association. It has to be reiterated that all this would not have been possible without the physical, financial and emotional support extended to us by our alumnus. They have stood by us through thick and thin.?

 The annual dinner is one of the highlights of the Xaverian alumni social calendar, on a par with Beyond Barriers and the St Xavier?s College Alumni Annual Debate. Attended by some high-profile names, the dinner should see a large turnout. 

 With plans for the second campus being finalised too, there should be a number of reasons to celebrate.

 What: 

 Down Memory Lane. 

 Where: St Josephs 

 College.

 When: December 10, 5.30 pm onwards.

 Tune in: The audience relived the magic of Engelbert Humperdinck, Cliff Richard, Tony Brent and Jim Reeves. After a welcome note by Brother Noel, songs like Release me, Living doll, The girl of my dreams, Monalisa and My foolish heart filled the air by performers Shayne Hyrapiet, Geoffrey Culloden, Francis Lepcha, Carlton Kitto and Rubin Rebeiro.

 This was followed by A Tribute to Jim Reeves in a live performance by lead vocalist Shon Anderson and his band called the Kolours. After a fun munch break, boys from St Georges School and St Josephs School engaged in a community singing session with numbers like Roll out the barrel, Oh when the saints go marching in, Daisy Daisy and My Bonnie lies over the ocean. 

 GoodLife columnist Nondon Bagchi was the master of ceremonies. 

 Voiceover: This kind of community bonding gets all the Anglo-Indians in touch with their roots and helps them relive the good ol music of the 50s and 60s, said Neville McNamara, principal of St Josephs.

 Kids day out

 What: First anniversary celebrations of Fame Hiland Park with Purple Ribbon a social initiative of Fame Multiplexes.

 Where: Fame Hiland Park.

 When: December 8, 11 am.

 Take a look: Around 150 kids from Parivarikee, a school for slum children, were treated to a fun-filled morning as they sat through a special screening of the animated Hanuman and feasted on popcorn, sandwiches and soft drinks. 

 Right in the middle of the film, the lights came on and Bollywood babe Sameera Reddy stepped into the auditorium for a meet-and-greet session with the children.

 The actress, busy shooting for Buddhadeb Dasguptas Aami, Yasin Amaar Madhubala, took time out for a cause. The kids first crowded around the sexy but simple star as she cut the anniversary cake. They then queued up for Sameera to hand out Hanuman merchandise.

 Voiceover: It was fabulous meeting all these kids. The best part was when they screamed so loudly on meeting me that I could hardly hear myself! smiled Sameera.

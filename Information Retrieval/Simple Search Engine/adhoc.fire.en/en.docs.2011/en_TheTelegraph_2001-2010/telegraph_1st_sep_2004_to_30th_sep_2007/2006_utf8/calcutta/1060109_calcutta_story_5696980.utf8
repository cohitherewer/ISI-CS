The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hunt in cave-in wake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police have launched a hunt for the developer of a highrise commercial-cum-residential building coming up near Kalighat tram depot, in south Calcutta, at the site where Ujjala cinema stood. The caretaker of the site is also wanted, for neglecting safety measures while carrying out demolition of the old structure. 

 Two labourers were seriously injured on Saturday when a section of the building?s parapet collapsed. 

 After stopping demolition work, deputy commissioner of police N.Ramesh Babu said that proper action would be taken against the offenders. ?Necessary steps will be taken after the local police submit a report. I have asked them to collect the details,? he said. 

 Sarad Paria and Dharmendra Behra, the two injured, were rushed to SSKM Hospital by other labourers at the site. They are under observation.

 ?Paria?s left hand was injured, while Behra?s left leg was damaged, when a chunk of concrete fell on them. The labourers are lucky to be alive,? said an officer of Kalighat police station. 

 Firhad Hakim, local Trinamul Congress councillor and chairman of Borough 9 of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said the accident could have been avoided if proper precautions were taken.

 Dilip Mazumdar, local CPM leader, said the hall was owned by the Kankarias and had closed down of late. ?It became quite difficult for the owners to pay the employees. Last October, when the owners proposed to pay off the staff and shut down the hall, the employees agreed and everything was amicably settled,? he said.

 Police said a case of negligence has been initiated against the promoter and the caretaker, since it is evident that no proper steps were taken to ensure the safety of labourers. 

 ?If you are carrying out a demolition, it is mandatory that you take necessary precautions. It should be a matter of days for the promoter to be arrested,? said an officer of Kalighat police station.

 Pocket Pinch: A meal for two will cost around Rs 1,400.

 Voiceover: With Punjabi dishes being a little on the spicier side, this is easily the best season to enjoy this fare. I have drawn up the menu in such a way that Calcuttans get to treat their taste buds to the best of delicacies from our land. While the menu will keep changing every day, traditional favourites like Makki ki Roti and Sarson da Saag will be on offer throughout the festival. I have brought in a lot of ingredients from Punjab so that authenticity is not compromised, smiles Sweety Singh.

 Oven treats

 What: Oven Roast on a la carte.

 Where: Waterside Cafe at Hyatt Regency. 

 When: January 13 to 22. Lunch only, from 11.30 am to 3.30 pm.

 The spread: A sumptuous affair meant for the winter afternoon with each dish specially cooked in wood fire ovens. On offer is a hearty assortment of non-vegetarian and vegetarian delicacies. 

 The menu includes Wood Fire Tenderloin with Rocket Salad and Roast Potato, Seared Kolkata Bekti with Roast Potato, Thyme and Garlic Marinated Chicken with Grilled Vegetables, Oven Roasted Mushroom with Goat Cheese and Olive Oil Dressing, Cajun Marinated Oven Roast Cottage Cheese and Basil Pesto Marinated Oven Roasted Vegetable. The dishes come with a choice of bread or rice.

 Pocket Pinch: Plate prices are pegged between Rs 315 and Rs 425.

 Voiceover: Food cooked in wood fire has a characteristic flavour that cannot be duplicated with any other medium. Most items have been sourced from Europe. However, I have added my own modifications, only to them make them more delicious for food lovers in the city, smiles chef-de-cuisine Ashish Rout.

 Kashmiri bites

 What: A Kashmiri food festival.

 Where: Kalash, the Indian speciality restaurant at Hotel Hindusthan International.

 When: From January 13 to 29.

 The spread: The festival gives Calcuttans a chance to taste Kashmiri delicacies like Gushtaba, Tabak Maz, Kashmiri Masala Trout, Shrimal and Dhania Paratha.

 Pocket pinch: The prices of the dishes range between Rs 120 and Rs 345 on an a la carte menu.

 Voiceover: There hasnt been a Kashmiri food festival in Calcutta in a long time. We decided to host one because the cuisine involves a lot of meat, which would go down well with the weather prevailing in the city now, says Utpal Mondal, executive chef of the hotel.

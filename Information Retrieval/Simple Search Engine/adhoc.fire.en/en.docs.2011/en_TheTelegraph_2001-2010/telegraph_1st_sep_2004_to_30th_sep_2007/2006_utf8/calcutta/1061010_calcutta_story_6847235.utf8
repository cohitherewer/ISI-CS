 Tit for tat

 Driven by what we conveniently consider compulsions of middle-class honesty and social responsibility, we often demand for ourselves as well as for everybody else what we ourselves think to be right from our point of view. However, this highly-disciplined, self-righteous attitude takes a beating when the avowed practitioner of equality and objectivity finds himself at the receiving end of similar demands, justified by the very same principles as preached by him. Howrah Dakshinayans latest production, Boomerang, is a stinging satire that exposes the hypocrisy of such self-appointed advocates of common good. Unfolding the happenings within a family, the play makes a strong comment on the dichotomy of middle-class materialism as practised by the so-called torch-bearers of social progress. It also appeals to viewers to be more liberal in their attitude and temperament. Script and direction: Kunal Mukhopadhyay.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Boomerang, produced by Howrah Dakshinayan 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

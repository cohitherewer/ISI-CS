 Centre debut in Shibpur

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An interdisciplinary Centre of Excellence on Soft Computation in Materials Science and Engineering will open its doors at Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU), Shibpur, in July.

 ?It will be a collaborative venture with a number of national and foreign institutions, including Cambridge University?, said Prof N.R. Bandopadhyay, head, materials science department of BESU.

 The centre is an offshoot of an international workshop on Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm in Materials Science and Engineering, held on the campus in January. The university also proposes to start an M.Tech on materials modelling.

 The centre will primarily work on the development and application of soft computing in materials science with an active industry interface. Computational materials science is a subject of growing importance and one that has seen collaboration between the academic laboratories and the industry.

 ?There are numerous commercial products that have resulted from the application of materials science research,? stated Bandopadhyay, who was the chairman of the organising committee of the international workshop. The BESU centre will initially join hands with Tata Steel, which was the co-sponsor of the conference. 

 Apart from the school of materials science and engineering and departments of metallurgy and materials engineering, computer science, information technology and others of BESU, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Kanpur, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, and Jadavpur University will participate in the academic programmes at the centre.

 Cambridge University, Abo Akademi University, Finland, and Iowa State University, US, will be among the foreign collaborators.

 The institutions, especially the ones from abroad, will mostly participate in the technical exchange programmes.

 The need for the centre was felt at the workshop, where experts on the interface of neural network and genetic algorithm discussed its uses and ramifications in materials science. The need for using soft computing methods like neural networking and genetic algorithm in materials sciences was underlined as old methods of regression analysis have failed to make accurate predictions of properties of materials and how they would behave under various conditions.

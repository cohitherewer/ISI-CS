 Victims of society

 From time immemorial, close, intimate inter-personal relationships among people have served as stepping stones of modern society and civilisation. However, various complex rules of society, framed from the beginning of human history, have gradually made us oblivious of the finer aspects of life. Rigidities of social order make us regard any deviation from established conventions with suspicion and aversion, often without attempting to view it from an unbiased, neutral perspective. Thus, in Daibaddha, Gagan, Sita and their daughter, Jhinuk, find themselves confronted by an antagonistic society which refuses to accept them as a family like any other. Uncomfortable questions are raised about the so-called unnatural alliance of the trio, who are humiliated and finally alienated from societys mainstream. Yet, when the victims challenge the rusted tenets of society, which itself is crumbling, the veteran guardians of social decorum fail to provide any satisfactory answer. Direction: Meghnad Bhattacharya.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Daibaddha, produced by Sayak 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

 Newborn rescued

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A group of youngsters out on a stroll on Monday afternoon rescued a newborn girl abandoned on a pavement near a fast-food outlet in Babughat. 

 They guarded the baby, which was lying wrapped in a white cloth, for over half-an-hour until a constable patrolling the area came along.

 ?A message was sent to the Lalbazar police headquarters. A vehicle of Radio Flying Squad (RFS) rushed to the spot and officers admitted the girl to SSKM Hospital. She is in good health,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma.

 Police found a hospital discharge slip with a name and address in the baby?s wrap. ?The name and address turned out to be false. We have no idea from which hospital the baby was released, since the slip did not bear an official stamp,? added Sharma.

 ?The youths noticed a tiny hand sticking out of a bundle of white cloth. They immediately took a closer look and drew the attention of the passersby,? said an officer of Hastings police station.

 Had the youngsters not guarded the baby, the stray dogs and crows would have killed it, the officer stated.

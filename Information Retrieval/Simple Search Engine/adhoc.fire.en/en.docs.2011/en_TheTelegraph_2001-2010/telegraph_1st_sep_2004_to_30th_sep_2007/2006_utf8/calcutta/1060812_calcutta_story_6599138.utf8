 Two autorickshaws parked illegally in the middle of a road in Kestopur, on VIP Road, on Thursday were impounded by police. But both had to be released after a Citu leader threatened officers with a demonstration.

 A month ago, the Shyambazar traffic guard had launched a drive against illegal parking of autos plying on the Ultadanga-Ahiritola route. The next day, 300-odd autos blocked the entrance to the traffic guard office, forcing police to negotiate with the operators.

 Calcuttans have long lost the right to walk on the footpath. Now, they are losing their right to hassle-free movement on carriageways too, courtesy illegal autos and parking. 

 Complaints lodged by commuters are ignored by police, acting under the influence of political leaders.

 The situation has spun out of control in fringe areas like Bidhannagar, Ultadanga, Dum Dum, Baguiati, Madhyamgram, Dunlop, Birati and Regent Park. 

 We, indeed, face some problems over the plying of autos, admitted superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar. The view was echoed by Kumars counterpart in South 24-Parganas, S.N. Gupta.

 Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh, too, sounded vexed. We try to rein in errant auto drivers, but I must admit we are not successful. 

 A senior police officer in Barasat said the illegal autos are a major source of income for a section of political leaders, mostly of the CPM and Citu. The owner of an illegal auto has to pay Rs 25,000 a month to the leaders and the driver is forced to cough up Rs 2 to Rs 5 for every trip. The amount is divided among the leaders and a few police officers. 

 If any officer impounds a vehicle, he added, the leaders flex their muscle through his superiors and get it released.

 A case in point: Police 

 had recently demolished an illegal autorickshaw stand on 

 VIP Road to prevent plying of the vehicles on the busy Joramandir-airport 

 route. But the business has not stopped and the autos are 

 parked in such a way that we have to alight from the bus 

 in the middle of the road, said Tapan Kar, a local resident.

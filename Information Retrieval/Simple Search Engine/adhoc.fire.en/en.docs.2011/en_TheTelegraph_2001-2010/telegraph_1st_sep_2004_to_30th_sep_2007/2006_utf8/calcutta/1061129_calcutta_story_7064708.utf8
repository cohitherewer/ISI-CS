 The City Diary

 Dibyendu Bhattacharya, 29, was arrested on Tuesday on charges of rash and negligent driving, resulting in grievous injury to a cyclist, Sebananda Shaw. Bhattacharya, a resident of Babubagan Lane, in Jadavpur, was returning home from office around 11 pm on Monday in his car. He hit Shaw near Ballygunge phari. But instead of slowing down, he drove on, dragging Shaw for over 200 yards. He slowed down briefly when cops and some local residents raised an alarm, but sped off again, leaving behind a profusely-bleeding Shaw. Police rushed him to SSKM Hospital.

 The power situation in Calcutta and its adjoining areas improved on Tuesday evening, as the two 210 MW units at the Kolaghat thermal power plant were restarted on Tuesday. They were shut down on Sunday following a snag. The state electricity board supplied around 250 MW to the CESC grid on Tuesday evening. The shortfall in the CESC-served areas was 58 MW on Tuesday evening, against 135 MW on Monday.

 To carry out a Calcutta High Court order, a team from Bidhannagar (south) police station on Tuesday evicted eight families from two government housing estates.

 A mob ransacked the station masters office and the ticket counter at Budge Budge railway station, on the southern fringes of the city, to protest late running of trains. Eastern Railway sources said trouble started around 10 am, when a Sealdah-bound train arrived at the station 40 minutes late. 

 The body of a middle-aged man, identified as Loknath Batabyal, was found lying by a ditch in Sankrail, Howrah, on Tuesday morning. Police said several cases of cheating were pending against him. The body bore several injuries.

 Around 450 womens self-help groups will take part in a fair at Salt Lake Central Park from December 4 to 13. The fair being organised by the rural development and panchayat departments will showcase handmade items, including jewellery and handicrafts.

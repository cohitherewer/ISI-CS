The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 The Book Fair is meant for books. So there should not be any space for other audio or audio-visual media. Their presence goes against the effort to encourage the reading habit. If there is a Thakumar Jhuli available in the next stall as an animation film, children are likely to want to take a shortcut from reading the book itself. However, an exception should be made for education kit. Any innovative method to teach children should be encouraged. So a CD explaining a difficult topic in physics is welcome to be sold alongside the text book. And is it fair to devote so much space to the Food Park? Eateries are a necessary presence but but they should not eat up precious ground space.

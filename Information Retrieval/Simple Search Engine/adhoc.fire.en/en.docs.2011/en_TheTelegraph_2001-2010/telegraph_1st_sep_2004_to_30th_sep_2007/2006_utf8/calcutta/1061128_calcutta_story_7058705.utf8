The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Prolonged power cuts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The city and its adjacent areas experienced prolonged power cuts on Monday due to two 210 MW units at Kolaghat Thermal Power Plant remaining non-operational since Sunday. 

 South Calcutta and parts of central Calcutta were the worst affected. The power cuts extended from an hour to a couple of hours in phases, said a power department official. 

 A CESC spokesperson, however, claimed the shortfall of 135 MW compelled them to disrupt supply for 30 to 40 minutes. 

 The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) cut down its supply to the CESC grid from 5.45 pm due to the shortfall.

 We couldnt meet Monday evenings demand of 1,149 MW as the WBSEB imposed a stiff limit to the power it supplies to us. This affected several pockets in the city. Some of the areas experienced power cuts for 30 to 40 minutes, the CESC spokesperson said.

 Besides the two units, a third unit at Kolaghat power plant has been closed for maintenance. This resulted in a shortfall of 450 MW during the day. The situation should improve in a couple of days. We are expecting the two units to become operational by that time, said state electricity board chairman Malay De.

 Some departments of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital went without power for more than an hour around Monday noon while state finance minister Asim Dasgupta was holding meetings in the cardiovascular and gynaecology departments.

 The power was restored around 1 pm after a group of patients and their relatives approached the minister while he was on the rounds of the wards. 

 Power on one floor of the cardiovascular department was affected due to an internal snag. The supply was restored immediately, said medical superintendent of the hospital K. Roy.

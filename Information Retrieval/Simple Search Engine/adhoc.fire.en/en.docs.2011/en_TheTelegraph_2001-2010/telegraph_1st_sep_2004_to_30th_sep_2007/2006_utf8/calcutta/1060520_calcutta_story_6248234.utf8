The king of rock

 Elvis Presley: Comeback call

 A new stage show brings to life the king of rock and roll in all his glory, focusing on his sensational 1968 Comeback Special. Philip Norman, who wrote the musical This Is Elvis: Viva Las Vegas, describes how he turned tragedy into celebration.

 The Elvis story is ultimately so horribly sad that theatre producers over the years ? not to mention audiences ? have tended to shy away from it. As everyone knows, no musical monarch ever came to a less regal end. When Elvis died of heart failure in the bathroom at Graceland, his Memphis mansion, aged only 42, he had suffered a terrible decline from world-challenging sex symbol to overweight Las Vegas cabaret star.

 However, his last decade was not all jump suits and cheeseburgers. In the late 60s, he scored one further triumph to match any in his hip-swivelling ?50s prime, when, for a brief, electrifying moment, rock ?n? roll got back its king, as sexy and irresistible as he?d ever been. 

 By 1968, thanks to his wily manager, Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis had become locked into a seemingly unbreakable cycle of third-rate Hollywood films. He had met the Beatles during their 1965 American tour and, since then, had grown increasingly discontented with his Hollywood exile. Finally, in 1968, he decided it was time to reclaim his crown.

 The comeback took the form of a ?special? on NBC television, and had a seated Elvis playing to a small studio audience with the intimacy of a spontaneous jam-session. Dressed in a tight-fitting black leather suit with a high Beau Brummel collar, his (dyed) black hair gleaming like new-laid tar. 

 The Comeback Special won enormous ratings and had an instant, galvanising effect on Elvis?s career. From there, it would have been an easy step to the big-stadium rock shows. Instead, in 1969, he signed a lucrative contract to appear at the new International Hotel in Las Vegas. Eight soul-destroying years later, the king was dead.

 This Is Elvis is a feelgood musical which also happens to be historically accurate. It focuses on that magical moment in 1968, when the king was reborn to his subjects. The first act recreates the NBC Comeback Special, with Elvis savouring the almost-forgotten buzz of live performance; the second act is his opening show at International Hotel, when he is still buoyed up by his artistic rebirth and as yet has no inkling that Vegas will be for ever. The score features more than 30 Elvis songs, from Hound Dog and Jailhouse Rock to later ballads such as Bridge Over Troubled Water and An American Trilogy. 

 Not that we gloss over Elvis?s darker side. There are hints of his neglect of his young wife Priscilla, his unextinguishable grief for his mother Gladys, and his mood-swings between rampant ego and niggling self-doubt; there are ominous signs of the eating and drug problems that would soon destroy him.

 But mainly this is Elvis as he should be remembered; that shy, chivalrous, strangely vulnerable country boy from Mississippi, who rewrote the dreams and fantasies of boys no less than girls, and ensured that no pop idol ever afterward could sing in any voice but his.

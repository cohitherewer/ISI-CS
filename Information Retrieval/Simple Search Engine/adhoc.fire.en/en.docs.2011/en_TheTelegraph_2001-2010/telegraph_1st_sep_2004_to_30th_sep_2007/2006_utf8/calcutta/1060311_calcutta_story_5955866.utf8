 Gutsy girls talk about gender bias

 They may be wrapped in a world without colour, but that hardly deterred these skilled youngsters from giving shape to clay wonders, at an environmental campaign for physically handicapped children at Birla Industrial and Technological Museum on March 8. Picture by Pabitra Das

 The session of That Takes Ovaries at St Xavier?s College on March 7 was an interactive session designed to encourage female students to examine discrimination and worse acts that they have encountered in their lives.

 The workshop, subtitled Bold Females and Brave Acts, held by Thoughtshop Foundation and co-sponsored by West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society, sought to address the issues on a wider national and cultural level.

 The name of the workshop is taken from the title of the bestseller That Takes Ovaries by US-based author and activist Rivka Solomon. A scene of domestic violence from the book was acted out with hair-raising accuracy by a few pupils of the host college. 

 The students were asked to write down what the word ?ovaries? meant to them and also other words which expressed confident femininity.

 Mira Kakkar, who anchored the workshop, came up with an ingenious abbreviation she had heard from an Italian lady. There were a few appalled gasps when she spelt the word ?bitch? on the board. But when she informed the students that it stands for Babe In Total Control of Herself, there was much amusement and applause amongst the participants.

 The most poignant part of the workshop was when various students told the audience about moments when they had stood up for themselves in the face of difficulties and discriminations in various spheres of life. The narrations ranged from the comic to the tragic. Some of the stories were very harrowing and demanded a great deal of bravery on the part of the storyteller. Each person who told a true-life story was then given a prize of an ?ovary? or Easter egg.

 One student who?s house was broken into by an armed gang described how she was held hostage as the robbers ransacked the place and forced her to cook them a meal at the end of it. She and her family have had to rebuild their lives since the incident.

 Another student told of how her parents were divorced when she was younger. Her mother then remarried a man who was extremely unpleasant to her. Yet, her mother refused to move out, as the shame of being twice divorced was too much to bear. The girl eventually gained the courage to tell her mother about her husband?s behaviour towards his stepdaughter, but the situation remains the same.

 Another pupil described how a friend of hers had fallen in love with a boy. But he declared that he could never properly go out with her because her complexion was too dark.

 The programme concluded with a film by Oxfam, which among other things, addressed the gender imbalance in South Asia. Said Kakkar: ?So far, we have taken the session to various colleges across Calcutta and they have been very successful.?

 Acting out

 On February 20, Stage-Addict in association with Padatik presented a theatrical reading of Richard Kalinoski?s Beast on the Moon at Padatik Little Theatre II. The readers were Arnab Banerjee, Ayan Guha and Adwaita Das.

 The play is about the Armenian genocide and deals with the mental conditions of two victims coping differently with losing their families in a gruesome manner. The play ends on an optimistic note with an orphan child coming into an infertile couple?s life.

 Though the play would have been more appreciated as a theatrical production, the readers were quite successful in bringing out the nuances of the characters and the trauma that violence has on human life.

 Shyamanand Jalan, as one of the audience members, complimented the group saying the performers had read their parts with feeling. Theatre veteran Vinay Sharma agreed that even without any action, such a movement and activity-dependent play was rendered well.

 Four days before the show, Stage-Addict had presented ?Where have you been all these days??, a tribute to poet Jibanananda Das. February 17 was his birth anniversary. Student poets of JU explored the boundary between English and Bengali verse and found channels across it through poetry readings of their original works and their translations. The fluidity of verse was portrayed through dance, theatre, music and celluloid.

 Jibanananda?s poems, in Bengali as well as translations by Prof Sukanta Chaudhuri and Ananda Lal, were read by actors Barun Chanda and Soumitra Mitra. The event was meant to bring to the fore Das?s works and the concept of aesthetically pleasing poetry to the younger generation, as well as rekindle his soulful art for those whom his words held the essence of life, love and loss.

 In mid-March, Stage-Addict will present another original play, Swap, after its successful November 2005 maiden venture Not Oedipus. It is about the breakdown of communication in relationships.

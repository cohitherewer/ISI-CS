Life

 Friday night fever and chill thrill

 What: First birthday bash of Gossip. Where: The restopub in Unnayan, at the Bengal Ambuja Housing Complex.

 When: Friday, 9 pm onwards.

 The bash: The first birthday of the restopub was, indeed, a happy occasion for its regulars, patrons and guests. City band Rudra entertained the crowd with their live performance. Their repertoire for the evening ranged from Bengali folk songs to old English numbers. The party went on till about 1 am.

 Spotted: Percussionist Ratul Shankar with his wife, actress Rimjhim Mitra with actor Rishi Kaushik.

 Star guest Bhaichung Bhutia, however, gave the party a miss, causing quite a bit of disappointment among the guests on a World Cup night.

 Sip bite: An impressive alcohol list was complemented by some lip-smacking delicacies, including Beer Batter Fish (bekti marinated with beer), Achari Fried Chicken (pickle-flavoured fried chicken) and Teamgeist Lollypop (ball-shaped delicacy made with cheese, corn and mushroom stuffing), named after the official ball of FIFA World Cup 2006.

 Music mood

 What: Musical Night.

 Where: Little Italy at Fort Knox.

 When: Friday, 8 pm onwards.

 The bash: Singer Shon Anderson with band member Kaizzad Gherd on the keyboard took the stage a little after 8 pm. He belted out some classics like Hotel California, Wet wet wet and Love will keep us alive. The crowd lapped up the music as much as the Italian spread at the all-vegetarian restaurant.

 Tea treat

 What: Iced Tea Festival. 

 Where: The Junction, the bar at Taj Bengal. 

 When: Till end-June.

 On the menu: The iced teas offered at this festival claim to have something to suit everyones taste. So while there is Scots Tea (iced tea spiked with whisky and topped with mint leaves) for a hardcore whisky drinker, there is Wounded Soldier (a heady cocktail of vodka, white rum, gin, tequila, cointreau, sweet-and-sour mix and iced tea) for those who like it strong.

 For the less experimental, there are milder concoctions like Tea-Totler (white rum, dark rum, cointreau, diced lemon, mint, dermera sugar and soda) and Lady in Red (vodka, red wine, diced fruits, sweet-and-sour mix and lemonade). The non-alcoholic section includes Lemon Almond Iced Tea (iced tea, hazelnut syrup, vanilla and lemonade) and Cranberry Honey Tea (iced tea, cranberry juice, honey and sweet-and-sour mix).

 Pocket pinch: The alcoholic iced teas are priced between Rs 425 and Rs 595, and the non-alcoholic ones are tagged at Rs 345. 

 Voiceover: Our idea is to offer a tall, refreshing drink to beat the intense heat. The basic base of each drink is tea, but various spirits have been added for that extra zing, said Jayanta Das, manager, The Junction.

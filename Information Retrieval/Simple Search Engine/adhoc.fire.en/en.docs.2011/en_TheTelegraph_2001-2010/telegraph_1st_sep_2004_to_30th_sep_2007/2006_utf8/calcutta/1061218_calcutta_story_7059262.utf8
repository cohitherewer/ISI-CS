The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CAS comes in, viewers clueless

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Mahasweta Guha, a resident of Tollygunge, where the first phase of conditional access system will roll out within three weeks, is clueless about CAS. I am not sure what CAS is all about. I have heard of it, but have no idea how it can benefit me. Will the monthly subscription I pay be the same or will it be an additional burden? wonders Guha.

 Going by the rollout roadmap, CAS Part I is ready to reach homes in Alipore, New Alipore, Behala, Chetla, Budge Budge, Garden Reach, parts of Thakurpukur, Tollygunge, Haridevpur and Mahestala from January 1, 2007.

 For the majority of over three lakh cable homes in the first phase, the only brush with CAS has been the occasional newspaper advertisement. The neighbourhood cableman has hardly communicated the CAS story to the consumer and is blaming the multi-system operator (MSO) for lack of information flow.

 We have not yet been briefed by MSOs on what the situation will be once CAS comes in and what we will be offering our viewers, argues a cable operator in south Calcutta.

 MSOs blame the cable operators for not undertaking a door-to-door campaign to spread awareness about CAS. We had asked our last-mile operators to distribute subscriber application forms, both in English and Bengali, to all households as directed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), says Suresh Sethia, director Siticable Network Limited.

 The cable operators, however, have covered only 15 to 20 per cent of the cable homes and distributed forms selectively, allege MSOs.

 Mrinal Chatterjee, of Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva, admits a lot of ground remains to be covered, but clarifies that the demand for set-top boxes can be met and training sessions for cablemen are on.

 Sudip Ghosh of Manthan Broadband expects the demand for CAS to rise by end-December, early-January.

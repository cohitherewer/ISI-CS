 What: 

 ELIXIR 2006, the seventh annual fashion show by National 

 Institute of Fashion Design (NiFD), Salt Lake.

 Where: The Hyatt Regency Calcutta.

 When: Saturday, March 18, 6.30 pm onwards.

 The show: The two-and-a-half hour gala showcased collections of 38 students graduating from the institute. Proud family members and friends started pouring in early, all set to applaud the young designers who eagerly awaited the audience response.

 The ensembles were carried off by some of the top ramp walkers of the country like Deepti Gujral, Sheetal Menon, Shonal Rawat and Candice Pinto, along with city models Tanushree, Priyanka Pal, Konkona and Neeraj Surana.

 At the judges table were designers Abhishek Dutta and Sunipa Samadder, Jaydeep Dutta, regional head, United Colors of Benetton, Anjali Sengupta, honorary secretary of Arts Villa ? Textile and Fashion Design Institute, Manjushree Bangur from BD Bangur Endowment Nirman and actress Pallavi Chatterjee.

 The collection was divided into 24 sequences. The fabrics were an assortment of rough textures and soft weaves like denims, lycra, wool, silk, cotton, khadi, all mixed and matched to bring about a very contemporary feel. 

 The colour palette was a riot of hues ranging from pristine whites to earthy browns to cool lime greens to electric reds.

 Skirts teamed with frilled stockings, skirts with extensions that went on to become net drapes and tops that were a blend of knitted wool and sheer fabric ? innovation was clearly the name of the game.

 Some trousers went the flowy way, while skirts with sensuous side slits had maps illustrated on them. Pleated pants and tops in splashy pink and peacock blue resembled traditional dance outfits. Asymmetrical necklines dominated the tops section.

 The inspirations were varied too ? old school days, evolution of the earth, Barbie, Egyptian culture, tribal motifs and more.

 The judges carefully picked winners in various categories. Surya Sarker and Salma Iqbal walked away with the Best Creative Designer award for their collection Entwine With Me. Sheer white fabrics blended with white leather formed collared jackets and flowy skirts, further accentuated with silver adornments. 

 The sequence Carnival won the Best Conceptual Collection prize. Created by Anurupa Dutta and Swapna Roy, it drew inspiration from Brazilian carnivals. 

 The Best Contemporary Collection award went to Nikky Tanwani and Ranjeeta Rai for Little More Fun that boasted capris and skirts along with frilled stockings, all teamed with elf caps. 

 The Best Promising Designer award was bagged by Jahnavi Mukherjee for her bold collection showcasing tribal cultures and traditions in an innovative way. The Best Wearable Collection was Hangout by Deboshmita Dasgupta and Neha Agarwal. Its street fashion concept was an array of innovative college wear.

 The World of Unknown, a collection of skirts and cocktail dresses in black by Shilpa Churoria and Shilpi Bachhawat won the Best Theme Representation award. 

 Voiceover: We are 

 an institute that fuses fashion with modern technology, 

 equipping our students to face challenges in every field. 

 The show is an effort to provide a platform of exposure 

 for the students, smiled S. Chowdhury, centre head, 

 NiFD, Salt Lake.

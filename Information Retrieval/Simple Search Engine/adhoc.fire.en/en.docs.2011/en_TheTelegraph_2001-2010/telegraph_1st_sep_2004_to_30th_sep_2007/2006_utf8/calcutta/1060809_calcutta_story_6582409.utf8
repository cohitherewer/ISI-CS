 Having repeatedly smashed retail 

 sound-and-sight barriers through its Park Street mother 

 store which grosses over Rs 2,000 per sq ft per month 

 against the international industry average of Rs 1,000 

 Music World is now set to unveil its second major outlet 

 in the heart of Calcuttas central business district.

 The countrys leading music 

 and home video chains 2,000-sq ft store at 10, Lenin 

 Sarani in the bustling Esplanade area its sixth outlet 

 in the city will be unveiled on Wednesday, with Suchitra 

 Mitra doing the honours alongside Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta 

 and Srikanta Acharya.

 Just like we did with Park 

 Street, we are again swimming against the tide this time. 

 Our core focus in the Lenin Sarani store will be on Bengali, 

 in sharp contrast to the abundance of Hindi music software 

 available in the area, says S.K. Chowdhury, president, 

 music amp; books, Music World.

 Chowdhury hopes to tap into the 

 600-plus people walking past the Dharamtala 

 store every minute constituting mostly middle-aged 

 Bengalis. 

 The property tie-up is with the 

 owners of Eagle Commercial, the label which had launched 

 the iconic Bengali folk number Boro loker biti lo 

 by Swapna Chakraborty, a song that became an anthem in the 

 late Eighties.

 This store will be another 

 initiative in our endeavour to constantly make the brand 

 accessible to the music and movie connoisseurs in the city. 

 With the launch of the Lenin Sarani store, we are now also 

 ready to serve the catchment areas of Dharamtala, College 

 Street, Moulali and Sealdah, says Sanjay Gupta, vice-president, 

 operations amp; marketing.

 The new outlet will have nearly 

 30,000 SKUs (stock-keeping units), more than 50 per cent 

 of which would constitute Bengali titles. The Lenin Sarani 

 Music World will also have a corner for Bengali books, mostly 

 related to music, besides housing VCDs, DVDs and CD-ROMs.

 Music World is scouting for space 

 in the Gariahat-Gol Park boulevard for another large-format 

 store, 3,000 sq ft or more. 

 Its a traditional 

 bastion of Bengali music and our stress will again be on 

 regional repertoire there, Chetan Arora, controller, 

 eastern region, declares.

 The chain will open a 600-sq ft 

 Express store in Kankurgachhi and another inside 

 New Empire cinema before the Pujas.

 Jamshedpur and Bhubaneswar will 

 also have Music World outlets in the next two months, while 

 the management is looking for more properties in Calcutta.

 Since opening the first-ever 

 dedicated music store in the country over eight years ago 

 in Chennai, we have constantly led from the front and our 

 Park Street store is still the leading music outlet in the 

 country. Today, Park Street has the highest average transaction 

 value of Rs 575, Chowdhury points out.

 That means a customer spends, 

 on an average, Rs 575 on every visit to Music World Park 

 Street, which translates into three-and-a-half units 

 of software, explains Gupta.

 The Park Street store will soon 

 give the music buff one more reason to drop in. We 

 are launching a service of customised bottled music, which 

 will enable the customer to pick and choose numbers from 

 a pre-arranged catalogue of titles cutting across genres 

 and we will burn those songs onto a CD, promises Gupta.

 The chain is also kicking off 

 its programme Transform the way you hear and see 

 at Park Street. 

 You can bring your old, 

 worn-out cassettes and we will give you a discount on CDs 

 against them. The same offer is valid vis-a-vis VCDs and 

 DVDs. Its an effort to enable people upgrade from 

 analogue to digital and enhance the audio-video experience, 

 explains Arora.

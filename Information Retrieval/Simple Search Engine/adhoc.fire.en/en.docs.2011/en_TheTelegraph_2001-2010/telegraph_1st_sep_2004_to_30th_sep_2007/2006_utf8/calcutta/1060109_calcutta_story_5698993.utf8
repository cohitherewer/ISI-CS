 Aryeman with Akshay Kumar in a moment from Family ? Ties of Blood

 Set to make his big-bang debut with Family ? Ties of Blood this week, producer Keshu Ramsay?s son ARYEMAN clears the controversies about him getting maximum screen space in the film and the unceremonious exit of Koel Mullick.

Is Family ? Ties of Blood an Amitabh Bachchan-Akshay 

Kumar film or your launch film?

 Let?s just say that Family is the best launch film that any actor in tinsel town can ever have. From the director (Rajkumar Santoshi) to the co-stars, it?s truly a dream debut for me.

How did it come about?

 I did the production for Khakee, which my father was producing and Rajji was directing. It was during the shooting that Rajji learnt that I had done theatre and I wanted to become an actor. He saw some pictures of mine and I was on.

So was Family written for you?

 No, it was always written with Amitji in mind. They needed a newcomer for the film and things just fell into place from there on.

What is the film about?

 It?s a story about two families. One is negative and the other is positive. One is the Don?s ? played by Amitabh Bachchan ? family. And the other is a normal family, which is Akshay?s family. I play Akshay?s younger brother. What happens when these two families meet or rather have a conflict, is what Family is about.

Can you rewind to the first day of the shooting?

 Oh! I was very scared and very nervous. The sheer scale of the film and then you have Amitji? I was really nervous. But then, I had been with this same unit for years. So everybody was nice and helped me calm down and things got rolling.

How different did you find cinema from theatre?

 Totally different. I believe the two demand completely different kinds of acting. Theatre, of course, has just one take to deliver whereas you can really sit back, think and improvise in films. Also, I find theatre very loud and artificial whereas cinema is all about being natural. It?s definitely much more realistic.

What was it like, working with veterans like Amitabh 

Bachchan and Akshay Kumar?

 Excellent. Amitji is amazing. I have been a big fan of his and did learn a lot of things from him during the shoot ? how he got into his character and his exceptional dedication to his work. What do I say about Akshay? Well, he?s worked in 16 of my father?s films (most of the Khiladi movies). I have practically grown up in front of him. So he was very easy to work with ? very chilled out.

But hasn?t Mr Bachchan played the big Don already 

in Agneepath and Sarkar?

 First of all, Family is a Rajkumar Santoshi film. So, all the characters and roles are totally different from any other Hindi film. And this Don that Amitji plays is a sophisticated and educated man. You hurt his family and he just goes mad. It?s all about the family, you see.

Why was Koel Mullick dropped after a day?s shoot?

 The script changed. She was supposed to be cast opposite me. Then, we didn?t need a heroine for my character because that would have spoilt the pace of the movie. So she had to be dropped. But it was great shooting with her for that one day. She is a very sweet girl. I am sure my father will cast her in his next production. I would love to have her as my heroine in my next film.

With days to go for what could be the year?s biggest 

debut, how do you feel?

 I am nervous. The film is releasing on Wednesday and I am going to Shirdi on Tuesday with the film?s print. I want to face God before I face the world.

What next?

 There have been lots of offers, even outside my father?s production house but I haven?t taken anything up yet. After a debut like Family, I really need to be careful about which film I sign next. Rajji is out of the country. Once he is back, Dad and he will sit together and chalk out my future plans.

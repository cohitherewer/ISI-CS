The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Baubles, beauty and Bebo

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 Shobha Asars artwork 

 is brilliant and the designs are gorgeous, says Kareena 

 Kapoor. Having been a friend of the brand, she 

 would surely know. While Bebo launched the Shobha Asar exhibition 

 in Mumbai earlier this month (in picture), shes set 

 to unveil the Calcutta collection on October 12.

 So, was cajoling Kareena out of shoot schedules difficult? Calcutta was logistically more complicated than Mumbai. We like the way she presents our jewellery and asked her if she was willing to come with us and give Calcutta a view of how our pieces look on her, says Siddharth Asar, Shobhas son, marketing force and administrative manager of the brand.

 And her reply was simple If youre looking at the Calcutta market seriously, then Id be happy to help out.

 Dates decided, Shobha Asar is in Calcutta for a second year in a row. Calcutta is a very mature market and its time it sees the latest designs, simultaneously with Mumbai, the trendsetter metro. Were showing lots of long earrings, thick bracelets and large pendants. Prices vary from Rs 30,000 to Rs 40 lakh, the range is varied, but quality remains the same unmatched, says Shobha. 

 She classifies designs under five broad heads Classic (very big diamonds and simple designs), Ethnic, Art-deco that shows diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires in intricate settings, Victorian (very now) and Gothic that shows geometric styles.

 The exhibition in Calcutta will showcase the latest trends: Victorian designs in lots of diamonds and rubies. Its great for the festival season because auspicious in India means red, says Shobha.

 In her 25th year in the precious profession, Shobhas three-fold advice to buyers is simple. Always buy high quality diamonds and double-check by testing them in labs. Secondly, dont get duped by low making charges; that usually implies low-quality gold. Finally, dont succumb to easy inspiration; be original and get noticed; make a statement. 

 The Calcutta exhibition will be presented by clients-turned-friends-turned-partners Manisha Rampuria and Hina Toolsidas at Taj Bengal on October 12 and 13 from 10 am to 8 pm.

 Contemporary Iran is not the best 

 of places for a woman. Irans Constitution holds that 

 the value of a womans life is only half as much of 

 a mans, the testimony of two women is equal to the 

 testimony of one man in court, and women who appear in streets 

 and in public without the prescribed Islamic hijab (head 

 scarf) will be lashed 74 times. 

 In this Iran, Shirin Ebadi has 

 lived, worked as a human rights lawyer, specially for women 

 and children, and sometimes helped to change the law. If 

 you look carefully, you see the halo around her face. She 

 also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.

 But that, says the 59-year-old 

 Ebadi, has hardly changed her life. Not her personal life. 

 Like most Iranian women, I cook, clean, do the shopping 

 and the household chores. My husband, an electrical engineer, 

 doesnt come home before eight, she explains.

 Ebadi, the first Iranian and the 

 first Muslim woman to win the Peace Prize, was in town last 

 week. Short and stout, with sharp, handsome Iranian features, 

 she speaks only Persian, but has the unmistakable bearing 

 of the woman anywhere on earth who takes everything in her 

 stride. One of the first woman judges of Iran who was dismissed 

 when the mullahs took over in 1979 and imprisoned several 

 times since, Ebadi has that very patient look, 

 dropped only when, speaking passionately, she clenches her 

 fist and brings it down on the table.

 In town for two days last week, 

 she is meeting reporters at the office of a Calcutta NGO. 

 She faces with equanimity questions on the weighty issues 

 asked again and again Irans nuclear position (she 

 doesnt approve of any country acquiring nuclear power), 

 terrorism (has its roots in poverty and prejudice), Saddam 

 Hussain (he is not the only villain), the hijab in 

 the eyes of the West (its a womans choice) 

 displaying the poise of The Nobel Laureate Meeting the Crowds, 

 though she clenches her fist when speaking about terrorism. 

 But she has to deal with much worse in her daily life. 

 They tried to kill me twice, 

 says Ebadi. I have been threatened with letters and 

 phone calls for many years. Now these pour in through 

 e-mail. She recently received a letter accusing her of working 

 against Islam and Iran. Instead of a signature, the writer 

 had taped a dead roach to the bottom of the letter. But 

 it is not easy to kill Ebadi.

 Iran now is not the best of places 

 to be, but it is one of the greatest opportunities to come 

 up with survival strategies. (Are MBAs listening?) It is 

 one thing to visit the website of the Makhmalbaf family, 

 the filmmakers, and to find out that Samira Makhmalbaf and 

 Marziyeh Meshkini, too, appear in the hijab (74 lashes 

 for online guilt, too?), but quite another to watch their 

 sensitive, strangely liberating films. Some of the best 

 art is coming out of that repressive regime. 

 And some of the most courageous 

 individuals. Ebadi says how she, and artists, writers and 

 filmmakers who go against the grain, survive Iran. Censorship 

 is very heavy. Every screenplay and book has to get approved. 

 But film-makers and writers have to know how to say what 

 they want to, she says.

 I have written 14 books 

 and every single one of them has been about the violation 

 of human rights. I refer to the law that equates the testimony 

 of two women with that of one man. Next to it I also mention 

 that more than 65 per cent of our university students are 

 women. Then I ask if the eyes of a woman can see less than 

 the eyes of man. If I said it directly, it would be censored.

 If the government is tough, our 

 filmmakers and writers are smart, she says. Then she 

 drops that very patient look again, looks you 

 in the eye and winks.

 But strategy does not always work. 

 Her memoirs, called Iran Awakening, came out this 

 year in English and has been translated into 18 languages, 

 including Hindi. It was not allowed to be published in Persian 

 or from Iran.

 Then someone asks about her family. 

 Ebadi bursts into life. Let me introduce myself, 

 she says. I am the mother of two daughters. That is 

 my most special characteristic. The prize, 

 even if it helped to bring her voice to more international 

 platforms, did not make any difference at home I 

 didnt even change the furniture. She suggests 

 that her husband has been extraordinary in being supportive: 

 Even when I went to prison, he didnt ask once 

 why are you causing so much trouble at home. 

 My elder daughter has chosen 

 her fathers profession and the younger daughter is 

 doing her Masters in law. So we have divided the world 

 equally between my husband and I, she says. Human 

 rights start at home, she concludes.

 I want to know what makes her 

 go on, as she is getting into the car. But the interpreter 

 is not there. No English, she smiles, waves 

 and disappears.

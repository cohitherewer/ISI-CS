 A rehearsal for Ranger 

 Haat. Picture by Aranya Sen

 To be staged by Sundaram, 

 the play revolves around a busy village market where women 

 from the red-light area troop in to buy and sell. The centre 

 of attention is Phutu, a young spotted goat that Shanta 

 Bahin from across the river has sold to the slaughterhouse. 

 A misfit with his innocence and 

 expectations of love, Phutu becomes the butt of ridicule 

 for Blackie the black goat who is proud of being the product 

 of a farmyard formula and doesnt mind being converted 

 into chops and cutlets.

 This is unlike what I have written 

 so far, a strange blend of the comic and the gruesome. The 

 central protagonists here are goats who have their own identities 

 and resemble human beings in many ways. I find animals useful 

 in my attempts to analyse the present, says writer-director 

 Manoj Mitra, who plays the pivotal role of Fajluda, an elderly 

 pimp-turned-cattle supplier.

 Catch it at 6.30 pm, EZCC, 

 on December 12.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Panic over empty car

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fear fuelled fear a day after the bomb scare on the Wipro campus in Salt Lakes Sector V, as police at Howrah station went into a tizzy when a car was found parked for a long time on Friday, with no takers.

 As word of the unclaimed black Ambassador spread, panic gripped commuters, who feared the worst: a car bomb.

 A search, however, yielded nothing, but police managed to trace the owners name and phone number from the blue book. The owner was called and asked to report to the office of the Howrah Government Railway Police.

 Around 5 pm, the car-owner, a businessman, turned up and said he had left the car at the station in the morning to catch a train to Asansol, as he would be back by evening. He has been charged under the Motor Vehicles Act for blocking a thoroughfare for an unlimited time, said superintendent of railway police K. Jayraman.

 Officers explained that a car can be parked at Howrah station, between platforms 8 and 9, for a maximum of two hours at a stretch and the owner or driver must be around.

 We were informed that a black Ambassador was parked from morning. As people panicked, we kept calling for the owner over the public address system, said Jayraman.

 The bomb squad was summoned and three constables and an officer broke open the car doors.

 At the other end of the city, in Salt Lake, cops were at a loss while tracing Thursday afternoons caller at the Wipro office, who had said a bomb planted there would go off at 10 pm. The caller had spoken in Bengali.

 The sleuths have traced the call back to a public telephone booth on Sarat Bose Road, in south Calcutta. Our officers are interrogating the booth-owner. Efforts are on to trace the caller, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

 A senior officer, however, admitted that it was an uphill task to locate the caller. Officers of the CID and detective department of the city police visited the booth and spoke to local residents.

 After Thursdays eviction-and-combing operation, the police picket was withdrawn on Friday. The situation is back to normal, but security has been stepped up, said a Wipro spokesperson.

 SHRADHA AGARWAL ON THE SHE STYLE MUST-HAVES OF THE MOMENT

 Denim turn-ups

 They might not be the latest kind of denims to be launched in the market, but Bangkok or Ballygunge, denim turn-up is in. Wanna look hot or look cool? Well, look just the way you want simply by teaming this versatile piece right. A conservative tunic or a sporty vest, accessorise it well and viola, you just set your own style statement. Its amazing how a slight show of skin can change the overall look so dramatically.

 Note of caution: resist the temptation of wearing one if you have a very broad ankle.

 But heres the real bad news: most denim majors in town have run out of turn-ups, but Cotton World, Bizarre and Spykar are expecting fresh stocks.

 To bridge the demand-supply gap for the moment, Levis Original Store at Forum offers a smart tip ? take a slim fit or a boot-cut pair, fold it up six inches and step out in your readymade turn-ups!

 PS: Slip on a slim silver anklet; your turn-ups just got sexier!

 Metallic chappals

 Keep your feet in sync with fashion by sporting the latest. Just make sure they are metallic and they are chappals! Bronze, gold, copper or silver or metallic mauve, pink or black? the list of hues is long and the styles are also varied.

 Look out for interesting Kohlapuris, matted or chunky metal embellishments. Choose from one-inch heels or tie-ups. Comfortable to walk in all day and dance in all night, these slippers will shoot up the oomph factor like little else can.

 Raid the racks of Metro Shoes, Soles, Hamlyn, Be: and Regal. Their metallic collection is bright and right. Also, the roadside stalls offer great bargain buys.

 PS: Dont forget the pedicure. Paint your toenails a vibrant hue, all for the metal chappal to be more of an eye-catcher.

 Cream lipstick

 Think Bipasha Basu (Nishigandha Dasgupta, if you please) in Corporate. Make-up artist Aniruddha Chakladar says: Over-the-top glossy lips are on their way out.

 The new look to show off is soft and creamy. Choose an almost-nude skin tone according to your skin colour and apply generously. Check out international make-up brands like MAC, Nina Ricci and Christian Dior. Their prices begin at Rs 700. The Indian ones are smooth too. Try Maybelline, Revlon or Lakme.

 PS: Be creative and play up your eyes; this is the biggest advantage of subdued lips.

 Calf-length skirts

 When it comes to style, you just cant skirt the skirt. Sometimes it is gypsy, crushed, pleated or balloon. But this time, the it silhouette is an A-line skirt that ends at calf level.

 Mostly printed and sometimes sequinned, these skirts are a riot of psychedelic colours ? parrot green to fuchsia to electric blue.

 Not regular symmetrical butis, these skirts are very Manish Arora in style and design. Pick them up from 85 Lansdowne or check out the stocks at Be: by Anshu Arora Sen and Priyadarshini Rao. Westside also has a great collection of the fun A-line skirts.

 PS: Dont get fooled by the tricky length; great legs are a pre-requisite here, too.

 Retro shades

 Retro. Oversized. Funky. Shell-framed. Just a few words to describe the shades that you must possess this season. Hollywood or Bollywood, everyone is sporting them with elan and its time you picked a perfect pair for yourself. If picking up shades is a stressful task, take along a friend for suggestions. Be patient and find one that fits your face and budget.

 The GKB Opticals outlets house a wide collection. Try out bee-shaped glasses from D amp;G or the monster-shaped ones from Oakley. Also check out Shoppers Stop.

 PS: Pull your hair back 

 in a ponytail; the oversized frame will look all the more 

 attractive.

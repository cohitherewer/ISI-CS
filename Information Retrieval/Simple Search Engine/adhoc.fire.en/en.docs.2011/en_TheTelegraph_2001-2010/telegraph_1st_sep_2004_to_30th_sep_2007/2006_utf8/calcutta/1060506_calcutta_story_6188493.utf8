The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Formal seal on billboard ban

 Dalhousie Square, Esplanade and the Maidan comprise a no-billboard belt ? and that?s official.

 In a radical departure from Subrata Mukherjee?s billboard bonanza, the Left Front mayor-in-council unanimously passed the civic heritage committee?s proposal to rid the heritage zones of such visual pollution.

 The former mayor had gone on a billboard overdrive to rake in civic revenue ? that jumped from Rs 7 crore to over Rs 15 crore in 18 months under this head ? and turned the heart of the city into an eyesore.

 The decision to ban billboards from the three zones will take ?immediate effect?, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said after Friday?s meeting.

 Metro, on April 27, had reported on the heritage committee of the civic body passing a resolution to remove and then ban billboards from BBD Bag (Dalhousie Square), Esplanade and Chowringhee.

 Following Friday?s ratification by the mayor-in-council, prior sanction of the heritage committee will be mandatory before a billboard is put up between Reserve of Bank of India at BBD Bag and Bishop?s House in Chowringhee.

 Mayor Bhattacharyya has directed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay to prepare a list of billboards on government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and private land in the designated area, to be placed before the heritage committee.

 ?All billboards disapproved of by the committee will then be pulled down. If the outdoor advertising agencies do not dismantle their boards within seven days, the CMC will pull them down,? said mayoral council member (information and culture) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 According to a civic estimate, there are over 200 billboards in what is now a no-billboard zone. Only those that meet the aesthetic standards set by the heritage committee, comprising artist Ramananda Bandopadhyay, architect Samir Rakshit and veterans from other allied fields, will be allowed to stay.

 The move to prevent the city from becoming a billboard jungle could be extended to other strategic heritage areas once the Dalhousie Square to Maidan zone is cleaned up.

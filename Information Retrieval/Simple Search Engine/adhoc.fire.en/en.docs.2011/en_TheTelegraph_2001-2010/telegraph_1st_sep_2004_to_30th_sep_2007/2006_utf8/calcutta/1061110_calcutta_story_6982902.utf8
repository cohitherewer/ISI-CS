 Tollywood star Prosenjit will 

 get red-carpet treatment at the 37th International Film 

 Festival starting in Goa from November 23. He will be felicitated 

 along with Anil Kapoor.

 The festival committee contacted 

 me to express their wish to felicitate me. I am glad that 

 Anil is also sharing the honour because we go back a long 

 way. We are very good friends. He calls me Bangal ka 

 don I was supposed to direct him in Vande Mataram 

 which didnt happen finally. But if I ever do the film, 

 it will be with him, smiles Prosenjit, who will also be 

 seen on screen at the festival in Rituparno Ghoshs Dosor, 

 slated for December 1-2. The festival will be inaugurated 

 by Shashi Kapoor.

 Back home, Prosenjits debut venture 

 as producer, Teen Yaari Katha, will be screened at 

 the Kolkata Film Festival on November 11.

 This film will test the waters 

 as I plan to make more youth-oriented films from Ideas (his 

 production house). I think films like Teen Yari Katha 

 will draw in the youth audiences we have lost, says 

 Prosenjit, on the sets of Bondhu at Lake Land Country 

 Club.

 Directed by Prashant Nanda, co-starring 

 Swastika Mukherjee and Victor Banerjee, Bondhu is 

 based on a father-son relationship. The son is played by 

 Tithi Bose.

 My role is of a father who is 

 extremely attached to his child. Their relationship is more 

 of a friendship, says Prosenjit, whose filmi platter 

 is full with a combo pack of arty and mainstream films.

 After Buddhadeb Dasguptas film 

 co-starring Sameera Reddy hits the floors on November 27, 

 there is Anup Senguptas untitled film with Koel Mullick, 

 Swapan Sahas Greftaar with Swastika Mukherjee and 

 Ashish Vidyarthi, and a Probhat Roy film.

 Talentspotting

 Bollywood ab door nahin, 

 say the billboards all over Mumbai and even a few here in 

 Calcutta. Why? The second season of Zee Cinestars is 

 here. The talent hunt show is looking for artistes to impress 

 the judges and home-viewing audiences, and win their ticket 

 to tinsel town.

 The judges line-up this time 

 is impressive to say the least. Anupam Kher, Madhur Bhandarkar 

 and Pooja Bhatt are the three wise people on the show hosted 

 by Aman Verma.

 Having started as a struggling 

 actor and then done 322 films, I know exactly what raw talent 

 goes through, Kher told Metro in his Mumbai 

 office. Adjoining the office is his training school An Actor 

 Prepares, where all the Cinestars hopefuls will be 

 groomed from scratch.

 For Pooja, the quest for new actors 

 is hereditary. I have inherited from my father (Mahesh 

 Bhatt) the responsibility to discover and launch fresh talent, 

 she smiled. Very few people have the audacity to work with 

 new people. But our conviction has always paid off and through 

 Cinestars I want to take this process a step further.

 After rounds and rounds of elimination, 

 24 contestants appear on the show (it went on air on November 

 3 and can be seen every Friday and Saturday at 10 pm). The 

 journey of the contestants will be shown as a reality series 

 spanning 18 weeks.

 The three judges will have three 

 distinct roles. Kher spelt it out: Having my own school 

 all these years, I would rather be a teacher to these kids 

 wanting to make it big. Madhur will give the directors 

 point of view and Pooja will look after the styling and 

 presentation of the contestants.

 Pooja is confident even those 

 who dont make it big on the show will take back a lot from 

 the experience. A show like Cinestars engages you 

 with life, she explained. Most people have misconceptions 

 and pre-conceived notions about the film industry but once 

 you are here you will be corrected.

 What the winner(s) most definitely 

 will have is a launchpad. Zee will be signing them up for 

 some under-production movie. Even Pooja hopes to cast the 

 Cinestars participants in her productions.

 You dont even need to look like 

 a hero or heroine to make it big today, Kher added. Cinema 

 is no longer about stars. It is about characters and if 

 you are talented you can fit it.

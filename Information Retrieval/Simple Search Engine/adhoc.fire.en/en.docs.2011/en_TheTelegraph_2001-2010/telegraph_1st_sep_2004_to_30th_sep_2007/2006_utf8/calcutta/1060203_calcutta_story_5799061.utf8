 No drinking water. No trolleys. No conveyor belts. There was no respite for passengers on Day II of the airport employees? agitation. The ordeal had, in fact, grown more acute.

 The domestic and international lounges had scattered piles of filth, as the cleaning staff have joined the ceasework. The toilets were worse; they have not been cleaned for the past 48 hours. 

 ?We cannot use them. Even roadside public toilets are better,? complained M.A. Mannan, who arrived from Agartala. 

 The handful of passengers who braved the filth and entered the lounges found the enclosures no better than gas chambers ? the airconditioners were not working.

 In some pockets, there was no power supply since morning. ?All the problems seem to be here. In Hyderabad, things are almost normal,? said Mrinmoy Roy, who returned from Hyderabad early on Thursday.

 In the evening, a passenger leaving for Bangalore saw 80 per cent of the lights off. There were no lights in the boarding area and serpentine queues for security checks.

 The conveyor belts have not been working for the past two days, and to make matters worse, there were too few trolleys. Most of the them were stacked outside, as there are no staff to wheel them in. Some were even bound with chains.

 ?We had to drag our own luggage. There are no trolleys or staff to help us,? said Mamta Jain, of Ballygunge, who returned from Jaipur. 

 The airlines staff were carrying the bags up to a certain point outside the arrival lounge, from where passengers had to carry them themselves. 

 For Santanu Bhattacharya, the agitation meant much more than inconvenience. The wholesaler of imported flowers, was running from one leader of the agitation to another, pleading for the release of his consignment of orchids, worth lakhs, from the cargo terminal.

 ?The orchids are perishable and will rot if not cleared today. But there are no staff around,? rued Bhattacharya. He approached MP Amitabha Nandi, who was camping at the airport, but that did not help.

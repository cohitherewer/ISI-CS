 Fed up with the way companies are maintaining the traffic islands and gardens where they have been allowed to put up billboards for free, the city civic authorities have decided to lay down some ground rules.

 ?We have allowed companies to enjoy free publicity for years in exchange for a commitment to maintain the roadside gardens and islands,? said mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

 ?Some of the companies have allowed the gardens and traffic islands to become dumps. So, we have decided to lay down norms on maintenance and also charge the companies for the advertisements they put up there,? he added.

 About half of the 316 roadside gardens in the city are maintained by companies. More than 90 per cent of the privately-maintained gardens are not looked after properly, stated Khan.

 According to him, the companies are not interested in anything more than deriving the maximum publicity. ?Just see the condition of the roadside gardens on Rashbehari Avenue and near the Lansdowne crossing, or the traffic island in front of the Tollygunge Metro station. They are dumping grounds.?

 B. Roychowdhury, a partner of MP Jewellers, which maintains the Tollygunge traffic island, said: ?It?s unfortunate that we have not been able to maintain the island properly. Currently, we have three billboards there. The civic body recently sent us a letter stating that from now on, it would charge money for putting up billboards on the roadside gardens and traffic islands.?

 Under the new programme, the civic body will seek maintenance and beautification plans from companies before giving them the go-ahead. A committee headed by Khan and consisting of engineers would approve the plans. 

 The civic body will also retain the power to terminate the contract of any company found to be negligent in executing the beautification and maintenance plan. 

 The civic body plans to ask companies to come up with innovative theme-based advertisements. Instead of continuing the system of putting up billboards on gantries, it will try and introduce single-pole structures for displaying advertisements.

 According to Khan, plans are afoot to instal electronic boards that will not only telecast advertisements but also entertainment programmes.

 Tanker rams into stall, kills child

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Four-year-old Barun Sardar (picture inset in graphic) was enjoying an after-school treat on Monday afternoon in the stall run by his parents, when an oil tanker rammed into it, killing him and seriously injuring his mother. 

 The incident occurred off the intersection of Raja Subodh Mullick Road and Prince Anwar Shah Road, opposite Jadavpur police station.

 Baruns mother Shyamali, 28, is fighting for life at MR Bangur Hospital. 

 The collision reduced the paan-cigarette stall to a mangled mass of wood and tin. Some shops adjoining the stall were also damaged.

 Barun studied in a nursery in Jodhpur Park. I picked him up from school soon after his classes ended around 11.30 am and left him with his mother. I was washing my hands at a tap nearby, when I heard the sound of a crash. I turned around. The shop was gone, and the tanker was rolling to a stop over its remains, recounted Baruns father Ramdev.

 Passersby managed to extricate Barun and Shyamali from the debris. The child died on the way to hospital.

 Barun always used to take a laddoo from me after school. It was a routine of sorts. Today, too, I gave him a laddoo. He was eating it inside the stall, when I saw the tanker approaching. It was travelling down Prince Anwar Shah Road and had hit a taxi. Oil was leaking from the tank. It rode up the footpath and reduced the stall to rubble, said Swapan Sardar, owner of an adjoining stall and a witness to the accident.

 Officers of Jadavpur police station arrived on the spot and took the driver and his help into custody. The vehicle was impounded.

 This, however, did little to quell the anger of the local residents, who tried to put up a blockade. Sensing trouble, the district police called in the RAF to handle the situation.

 Earlier in the day, Mazinur Rahaman, 63, was run over and killed by a minibus on Karaya Road. The accident prompted about 500 local residents to put up a blockade for over 30 minutes. The blockade was lifted on the intervention of senior police officers.

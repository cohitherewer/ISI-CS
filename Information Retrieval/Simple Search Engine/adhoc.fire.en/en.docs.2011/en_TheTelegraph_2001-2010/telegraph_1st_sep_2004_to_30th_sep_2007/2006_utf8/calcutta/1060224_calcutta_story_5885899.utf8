 EZCC hosts the maiden performance of Dhara, a one-of-a-kind multimedia production that displays an innovative combination of the visual and performing art traditions of Orissa. A part of the Raghurajpur Lila Project, which aims to highlight the artistic skills of the village community of Raghurajpur, near Puri, Dhara is an hour-long spectacle performed by eight members of Dance Routes. Using traditional and contemporary styles of choreography, paintings by patachitra artists and an original soundtrack that incorporates folk instruments with natural village sounds, it weaves together the acrobatic skills of the gotipua with the sensual classicism of Odissi. This unique performance explores the process of embodying dance as yoga, or union ? a practice that historically linked the folk gotipua and classical Odissi dance forms. It represents an act of surrender to the deities depicted in images indigenous to the region. Direction: Dr Rekha Tandon.

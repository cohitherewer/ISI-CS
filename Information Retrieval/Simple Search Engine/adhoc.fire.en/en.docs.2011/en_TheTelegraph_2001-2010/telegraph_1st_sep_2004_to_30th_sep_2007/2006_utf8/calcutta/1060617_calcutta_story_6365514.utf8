 What: 

 Launch of a new Bata showroom. 

 Where: 41, NSC Bose Road 

 in Tollygunge, near Ashokenagar park.

 When: Thursday afternoon.

 Take a look: The 2,400 sq ft family footwear store has been done up according to the fixed format that Bata follows globally. The store was inaugurated by managing director of Bata India Limited, M. Villagran, and Tollywood actress Rimjhim Mitra.

 We have grown up wearing Bata shoes and it is like a family shoe store for all of us. The shoes stand out for their quality and affordability. A new Bata store is a value-add to the city, said Rimjhim, sporting black tees and denims.

 While the first floor houses the mens section, the ground floor is for ladies and children. The launch kicked off with a fashion show exhibiting the latest range from the house of Bata. City models sported four different looks ? formal, Indo-western, beach and sports.

 The formal shoes come in black, brown, beige and maroon, with smart and no-frills designs. In the Indo-western sequence, kurtis and saris were teamed with pretty slip-ons. Then came the beach wear with slippers, sandals and slip-ons.

 The sports sequence, predictably, revolved round World Cup style. Models sporting football earrings and team jerseys walked in muted blue, pink and brown footwear. 

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 129 and go up to Rs 2,199.

 Voiceover: As our customers have evolved, so have we, constantly reinventing to cater to all kinds of tastes and needs. The shop is home to a collection that offers the latest in shoe trends. We are planning to open 200 stores of the same format, nationally, said M. Villagran.

 Speed spirit

 What: Live screening of Fosters British Grand Prix. 

 Where: Willow and Birch, banquets at The Park.

 When: Sunday afternoon, 4.30 pm onwards. 

 Take a look: The live screening hosted by Simon Wilson, consul-general, British Deputy High Commission, and Calcutta Motor Sports Club saw an enthusiastic turnout. Trademark chequered flags, in the form of posters, coasters and tablemats set the sporty mood as all eyes were fixed on the huge screen bringing the F1 action live from Silverstone in England.

 Sip n bite: 

 Lebanese mezze and assorted salad sticks served with a variety 

 of dips, Chicken Brochette, Fish Nuggets, Spinach and Cheese-stuffed 

 Mushroom, Green Apple and Asparagus Bruschetta? The snacky, 

 finger food menu kept the guests busy all through the exciting 

 race. Not to forget the endless supply of Fosters 

 beer, of course.

 Voiceover: British engineering is heavily involved in the production of Formula 1 cars, and there is such incredible interest in the sport. There are also a number of great teams based in the UK. All in all, hosting the British Grand Prix is a great opportunity for me, both to promote this awesome sport and also British technology, said Simon Wilson, an F1 fan for whom the speed sport most definitely scores above soccer.

 Creative blues

 What: Do Your Denim Fest. 

 Where: Shoppers Stop 

 outlets at Forum and City Centre.

 When: Till June 18.

 Take a look: Customers can choose their favourite blues from a wide array of styles, shapes and brands. The festival is targeted at the youth wanting to flaunt their attitude.

 The highlight is a Lee Denim Lab, where customers can create their own denim designs ? rip, paint, glitter, sticker or embroider. The best-designed jeans will win free merchandise from the Lee X line. There are exciting offers and freebies across many brands, on purchase ranging between Rs 995 and Rs 3,000.

 Voiceover: The Denim Fest celebrates the spirit, energy and vitality of the youth of Calcutta, said Santanu Ghosh, unit head, Shoppers Stop, City Centre.

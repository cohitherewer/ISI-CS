 The Clarins workshop in progress. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

What: Workshop by cosmetics major Clarins. 

Where: Taj Bengal.

 When: Thursday afternoon.

 Take a look: The interactive session kicked off with Jason Au, regional trainer, Asia training division, Clarins, highlighting how the products are a blend of plant extracts and technology.

 Next, it was the turn of city beauty expert Bridgette Jones and others to put forth their requests for easy accessibility of Clarins. Some also wanted to know how to use the skin-care range and how appropriate it was, keeping in mind the climatic conditions in this part of the world. More than the climate it is important to know whether the skin condition is ready for the product and to choose one which suits you best, felt Jason.

 This was followed by a demonstration of a homecare beauty treatment, using the Clarins range. The cleansing process included getting rid of the make-up first. The gentle eye make-up remover prevents dehydration of eyelids and conditions lashes.

 Tips for cleansing the face: warm the cleanser on your palms and apply gently; briskly lift your hands off the face with flapping movements to lift dirt and make-up without causing irritation.

 Next up, exfoliation and application of an eye mask that would take care of dark circles and puffiness. A hydrating mask was applied on the face, to restore skin radiance and refine skin texture. It was pamper time with a brisk hand-and-shoulder massage. Finally, a makeover with eyes done up in a smoky effect and lips touched up with gloss.

 Voiceover: Its good to see that the women here know skincare issues and how to use cosmetics, smiled Jason.

 With less than a week to go for the much-talked-about Lakme Fashion Week to roll in Mumbai, the fashion fraternity of the country is waiting to see to how the rebel venture sinks or sails.

 While style stalwarts and budding talent across the country are busy putting finishing touches to their autumn-winter 2006-07 collections for the glamour capital from March 28 to April 1, its the grand finale that promises to be really special.

 Happy Hour: By Day and By Night defines the two looks that designer Ritu Beri will put together for the final flourish, interpreting the summer statement by Lakme. Two different moods to suit the sunny mornings and sultry evenings will find expression through Ritus resolutely mischievous collection.

 Happy Hours is about a lot of fun. It is about the jet-setting woman who can sport this collection anywhere in the world, Ritu tells GoodLife.

 I am delighted to be able to bring alive Lakmes summer fashion statement on the ramp. The collection is a combination of humour and style, a kaleidoscope of visions that lets women be sophisticated and chic and yet celebrate the simple joys of being women, she adds.

 A lot of Indian inspirations blend into the strictly western silhouettes. Summer colours like pink, purple, beige, peach and white form the palette. For Happy Hour by Day Ritu uses candy pinks, icy purples and soft peaches, while shimmering pinks, electric purples and sparkling peaches make up Happy Hour by Night.

 Ritu Beri, our chosen designer for the Lakme Grand Finale, will lend her creativity and passion to interpret the Lakme statement for summer 2006. And I am sure that like our last two statements for summer and winter 2005 ? Peppermint and Mosaic, respectively ? this one will also receive overwhelming response from Indian women, said Anil Chopra, vice president of Lakme Lever.

 The Happy Hour range of cosmetics 

 from Lakme that was launched recently boasts instant hair 

 highlighters, lip colours, nail colours, blushers, lip gloss 

 and eye cubes. The Happy Hour services at the Lakme salons 

 include Happy Glow Facials, Happy Touch Hour Hand Facial 

 and Happy Touch Foot Facial.

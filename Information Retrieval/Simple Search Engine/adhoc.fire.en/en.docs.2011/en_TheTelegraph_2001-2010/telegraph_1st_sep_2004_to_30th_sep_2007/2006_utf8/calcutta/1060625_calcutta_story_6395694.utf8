The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 A for effort, 

 Z for event

 The Boys from Brazil match was a great 

 marketing idea that failed to rise above the frills

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 It 

 was late afternoon when the hoarding caught my eye. A popular 

 cell phone company was telling me that in a few hours I 

 could watch the ?Boys from Brazil? in action. The temptation 

 was irresistible; I had no tickets or invitation, yet a 

 few moments later, there I was, standing in a long queue 

 to get inside the stadium. The hoarding I saw had clearly 

 said that admission was free. Even then, when I saw some 

 people with admission tickets in hand, I felt nervous. Someone 

 told me that they were distributing tickets a few steps 

 ahead. I rushed, joined the frenzy to collect the piece 

 of paper: a fixture for the World Cup matches.

 The next surprise came as soon 

 as we entered the arena. This was not football as we know 

 it but a miniature version of it. The ground was tiny, the 

 goalpost fit for a kindergarten. The advertising for the 

 event promised that the match would start at 4 pm. By then, 

 we had already waited for 40 minutes in an un-shaded stadium 

 gallery.

 The temperature was high, the 

 humidity killing. It took another half-hour for the anchor 

 to get into the act. His verbal assault concentrated more 

 on getting the crowd to roar rather than giving us the antecedents 

 of the ?Boys from Brazil? or the rules of the match. No 

 one was really bothered about the spectators, although they 

 were the honoured guests. They were the people for whom 

 the event was organised. They were the prospective buyers 

 of cell phones. Finally the match started. Within a few 

 minutes it was abundantly clear to all those who have some 

 knowledge of football that the ground was too small to accommodate 

 five players from each side. Even a Maradona would not have 

 been able to show his skills on such a crowded ground. A 

 sizeable number of spectators left the ground during half-time. 

 I was one of them.

 Organising events has become very 

 popular as a marketing activity. Musical soirees, theatres, 

 football matches ? events come in all shapes and sizes. 

 They are attempts to offer additional and beyond-product 

 value to the consumers of the brand that sponsors such an 

 event. Quite naturally, the value on offer needs to be something 

 that the consumer desires.

 Much as this may sound like a 

 no-brainer, most brands falter on this count. And this is 

 precisely where this event involving the ?Boys from Brazil? 

 scored. True, the high public interest for World Cup soccer 

 is well known. More significant is that, as always, in this 

 tournament our home team is made up of 11 players in yellow 

 and green from another continent. None of them has possibly 

 ever set foot in India. Yet the passion is as intense, our 

 support for them is as vociferous. Recognising this as a 

 marketing opportunity showed sensitivity. Getting the ?Boys 

 from Brazil? to come down was a masterpiece.

 There was just one problem. The 

 actors were there. The playwright was well chosen. The make-up, 

 the light, the props were all ready. Someone, somewhere, 

 somehow, forgot about the play to be staged. The music before 

 the match, the dancing troupe on the dais during the interval 

 were mere frills. 

 The fever of the World Cup and 

 the support for Brazil owe their origin to the passion for 

 the game of football. People braved the heat to watch a 

 delicate dribble or a swerving soccer ball. They wanted 

 to experience this magic from Brazil. The event managers 

 somehow did not realise this.

 As I was dragging my tired feet 

 from the ground, I realised that while good marketing ideas 

 are difficult to come by, it is possibly even more difficult 

 to convert them into great events.

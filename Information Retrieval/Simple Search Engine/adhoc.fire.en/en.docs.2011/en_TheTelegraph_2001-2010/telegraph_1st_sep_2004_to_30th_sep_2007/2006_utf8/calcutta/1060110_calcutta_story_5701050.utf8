The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Squat site, traffic plight

 What is the Metro Channel? The permanent rallying point opposite Metro cinema. Why is it such a nuisance? Because Calcutta Police, in all its wisdom, has designated this a meeting/rally site, along with Shahid Minar grounds and Rani Rashmoni Avenue. All an organisation ? political or non-political ? needs to do is deposit Rs 2,000 for police permission. But if one-third of the thoroughfare is not left free for vehicular movement or if emergency vehicles like an ambulance are not provided easy passage, the deposit money is to be forfeited. Will police forfeit the far-from-forbidding deposit ? if it was deposited in the first place, that is ? from the women?s wing of the Congress that overran Metro Channel, blocked off the thoroughfare and paralysed Chowringhee till the Park Street flyover on Monday afternoon? 

With an average of 15 traffic-stopper meetings at Metro Channel a month, shouldn?t police be designating this a no-rally site, instead? Pictures above by Pradip Sanyal

It?s mad really, and hard to resist 

Screen On amp; Off

 Bill Nighy, the loveable 

 old rock star in Love Actually, is Davy Jones 

 in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man?s Chest

 What can you tell us about 

 Davy Jones?

 Davy Jones is a man transformed by love and luck. As people will see from the pictures, he is half squid and half-crab but there is a man in there somewhere. And weirdly he?s Scottish, for reasons we will perhaps go into later. His job in the movie is largely to put the fear of death into people and the only time you will ever see Davy Jones, or indeed his terrible crew on their horror ship, is at the point of death. Davy Jones will turn up at the point of death and he will offer you a deal and it?s not much of a deal but it?s the only one in town and it?s a terrible deal.

 And then you will belong to him in a way that you can?t even imagine. Along with his crew and his ship they constitute the most powerful force on the ocean, so if they are on your side you are in brilliant shape, if they are on the other side ? forget about it.

 And he doesn?t have a beard, he has what appears to be a squid growing out of his chin with tentacles that move all the time; but his beard plays the organ. He also smokes a pipe and he actually smokes through his neck (laughs).

 So he has his own ship?

 Yes, it?s called The Flying Dutchman and it?s an incredible ship. In the Caribbean we had three incredible ships. Johnny?s (Depp) ship, The Black Pearl, a unique craft in that it looks the way it does but it moves so quickly, it?s very cool. 

 So what was it like, the first 

 time you stood on board The Flying Dutchman?

 It was incredible and it was daunting. Because you just think, ?Well, I?d better be bloody good because these people are bloody serious.? It?s often like that, when someone hands you a prop on a movie and it?s been made with such precision and such care and such wit, you do feel outclassed.

 Had you seen the first film 

 when the call came to meet director Gore Verbinski?

 Yes, I had. And the first film is more than just a fond memory for people, it?s kind of beloved. And it is largely to do with Johnny?s performance. And it occurs to me that it is a performance that has entered the language in a way that very few performances do. And it is a performance that will survive down the years ? we will show our grandchildren this performance. It?s a huge contribution Johnny has made and it has everything ? it?s profoundly funny and witty, it?s daring and bold, it?s affectionate and fond and it?s iconic. And you can?t say that very often but he really has pulled it off and it will survive.

 The essence of the story is? 

 Jack Sparrow made a deal with Davy Jones, which is like a deal with the devil. It?s a Faustian pact. And his time is up. He got The Black Pearl and the right to live but now it?s time to pay up and he tries to think throughout the film of every way not to pay up. And then you have Keira (Knightley) and Orlando?s (Bloom) story that continues and Jack Davenport has a major part to play. It?s great, a really great script. 

 What was it like being in the 

 Caribbean for such a long stint? 

 Well, I think my luggage was books; I didn?t take anything else apart from my iPod and I?d put the iPod on Dylan shuffle or Stones shuffle and get the book out; I mean, for me that?s a bit of a result, I?m happy. I don?t do anything else anyway ? that?s what I do.

 What?s Johnny Depp like to 

 work with?

 He?s an exemplary man, both as a colleague and as company. He is terrific company, he is a gentleman, a democrat ? I don?t mean in the political sense, I mean in terms of his general sensibility ? he?s funny, decent, conscientious, a lovely guy and an assassin in terms of comedy. He?s just entirely wonderful.

 How did Gore cope with such 

 an enormous project? 

 Gore is a wonderful man. He was absolutely terrific with me; he is much, much cleverer than I am, which is what you require in a director, he also has the talent that directors are supposed to have which is that he can hold everything in his head. His attention to detail is remarkable, from the rings on your fingers to the design on the curtains, nothing escapes him. He is brilliant on the tonal variations; he can tune you in and tune you out. And I mean, you look at the unit you have out there in the Caribbean and you could invade a country, it?s a huge thing. And he wears it very, very lightly. If there is any pressure, you won?t hear about it from Gore ? he?s very classy and always working and always honouring the story.

 What?s it like seeing that 

 incredible image of yourself as Davy Jones? 

 It?s extraordinary when you see yourself like that. It?s mad really. My face moves all the time with these tentacles because they are alive. Amazing. It?s extraordinary because it?s not like any other gig and when you start you sort of try and tune your head to something where you are operating with a degree of taste and you try and keep the level authentic and in human terms. And then you remember what you look like and all that goes out of the window really!

 How does this compare 

 with your other work?

 This is in a class of its own. A category of one. And you know, hard to resist.

 The gulp moment has finally arrived. Saturday is the big night that will witness the crowning of Vatika Honey amp; Saffron Soap Sananda Tilottama 2006. 

 Twenty hopefuls take the stage, giving their best shot to make or break their world of starry dreams. When so much is at stake, no amount of advice seems adequate.

 On Friday afternoon, the Tilottama finalists geared up for their final pep talk. The agenda was vital and the panel of experts special.

 Interacting with the girls was Vandana Luthra, president of the VLCC group. 

 The girls look starved? They must know the secrets of a balanced diet, she observed, eager to share her beauty mantras with the wannabe beauty queens.

 Here are some hot tips from her: 

 Do not make beauty an 

 obsession and see the results for yourself. 

 Always remember that health 

 is wealth.

 Discipline is the key 

 to success in life.

 Tilottama grooming experts Nayanika Chatterjee and Ria Mitra were also present to give last-minute tips. 

 Butterflies are bound to flutter when they take the stage for the first time but it should be a smooth sail after that, assured Ria.

 And this is what Nayanika had to say to the girls: Smile, smile and smile. This will change the mood and take you a long way. And secondly, be confident. Everything else will fall into place perfectly. 

 The girls were also given D-day-related instructions by VLCC make-up expert Johanna Beyer who urged them to moisturise their faces well and not wear kajal or any other make-up before their faces were worked upon. There will be two distinct looks ? the first one creamy and soft, the second sophisticated, probably with smoky eyes, she said.

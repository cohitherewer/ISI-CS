 What: Walk The Line, a 

 fashion show by Preeti Jhawar and jewellery designer Suhani 

 Pittie showcasing their spring-summer line. 

 Where: Prana, the lifestyle store at 13/3, Ballygunge Circular Road.

 When: March 9, 4.30 pm.

 Take a look: Based on a celebration of feminity, designer Preeti Jhawars spring-summer collection was a blend of elegance and grace. The collection was unveiled through five sequences that saw a total of 30 garments comprising saris, kurtas, salwar suits and lehengas.

 Walking the makeshift ramp in the store itself were city models Jessica, Sreshthaa, Tina, Pooja and Pamela.

 The first sequence, Princess Memory, was about the dreamy woman who adopts an excessive style combining floral and foliage prints in a bohemian spirit of kitsch. The clothes in this sequence were a mix of soft and bright floral tones ? a nonchalant look with abundant details, gathers and frills in vintage flowing dresses.

 Next up was Ethnic Queen, clothes that brought out the adventurous woman who enjoys discovering tribal influences and styles. This line saw a dominance of African dress codes with churi sleeves in military colours such as combat green, tobacco brown, mahogany and gold.

 The clothes in the sequence Acid Baby Doll were about exaggerated volumes with ribbons, smoked sleeves and floral applique work in tangy, acid colours reflecting the over-the-top creativity of a woman.

 The next two sequences, Aquastar and Miss Clean, with a focus on the minimalist look witnessed creations in shades of whites and cold pastel shades. As the woman who appreciates simplicity in real life, one got to see slim jackets and straight hair.

 The last sequence witnessed the jewellery line by designer Suhani Pittie. Her collection was all about chunky neckpieces, bracelets and earrings in silver, beads and semi-precious stones. The one thing that dominated her collection was that big is back.

 Voiceover: Glitter is the essence of my collection. I have used a lot of sequins and stones on soft pastel colours to reflect the vibrancy of the coming season, smiled Preeti.

 Craft calling

 What: Baishakhi, an exhibition hosted by Crafts Council of West Bengal.

 Where: Artisana, 13 Chowringhee Terrace, first floor. 

 When: Till March 19.

 Take a look: The nine-day exhibition is home to a creative collection of crafts and textiles from traditional weavers, dyers and printers from across the country. Craftsmen from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu are showcasing their collections across the counters.

 Silk weaves from Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh, come in a riot of hues. Pretty saris with thin borders and small butis all over, and unstitched materials in cool shades are suitable pick-ups for the summers. Sea-blue, green and off-white dupattas can be coordinated with ethnic skirts or suits.

 Kotas from Rajasthan stand out for their fine weaves and ornate patterns. A pink drape in gold and silver embellishments is a definite eye-catcher. Temple-bordered cotton saris from Orissa have typically overworked pallus. Ikkats in earthy shades of blue, orange and green have a traditional yet trendy appeal. 

 so available are pattu weaves from Rajasthan, Maheshwaris and Jamdanis. Cotton salwar suits and tops come adorned with hand-stitched embroidery around the neckline. Some of them are also collared. Team them with chic bags in abstract patterns. 

 Table covers and napkins in silk-cum-cotton come in sober shades of white and blue. Also available are cushion covers in sizes big and small.

 Pocket Pinch: Rs 350-plus.

 Voiceover: Exhibitions like these highlight the efforts of talented grassroots craftsmen and help revive many a traditional art form. With Poila Boisakh around the corner, people can enjoy some great buys, said Sonali Basu of Crafts Council.

 The touch of 

 technology

 SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

 Discoveries 

 in science usually mutate to a technology. Through the ages, 

 science and such resultant technologies have contributed 

 to human life. Some discoveries, although significant in 

 a scientific sense, remain remote for the man on the street. 

 For instance, the small step that was described as a giant 

 leap for mankind, is yet to touch our lives in a big way.

 Then there is the other kind of 

 discovery that results in machines and medicines which make 

 your life and mine a lot safer and a lot better. For the 

 moment, there is one such technology that is changing life 

 all around us. Last week, work took me to Andal, a small 

 town of less than one lakh population, sandwiched between 

 Durgapur and Asansol. I was talking to a young lady, barely 

 out of college. She has her mother and an elder sister at 

 home, having lost her father some years back. The sister, 

 the only earning member, teaches in a school. The lady herself 

 is currently planning to take up the same profession.

 According to her, for someone 

 of their background not much choice is available in terms 

 of a respectable livelihood. Andal, she told me, has no 

 professional institutes except some computer centres of 

 dubious credentials. For exposure to a wider world she needs 

 to travel to Durgapur, Asansol or even Burdwan. A few years 

 back her mother would not let her elder sister to venture 

 so far. My respondent then said rather hesitatingly that 

 things may be different for her. For her mother, the source 

 of confidence was the mobile phones that her sister had 

 bought one for the home and the other for the sisters 

 when they are away from home. She might thus even allow 

 her to take up a course in Durgapur or Asansol and be away 

 for the whole day. That may change her life completely.

 Technology, developed and perfected 

 thousands of miles away, has now been translated into a 

 gadget that touches so many lives and changes them for the 

 better. Credit obviously goes to the scientists who broke 

 knowledge barriers to evolve the technology. Yet, when one 

 sees such technology touching lives, very few spare a thought 

 for the marketing man. His role is not minimal. He had to 

 achieve a scale of operation for the technology that would 

 allow popular pricing. He had to ensure that the remotest 

 of towns offered the facilities to purchase a phone, and 

 more crucially a cash card, whenever one wanted to. That 

 is no mean a distribution feat.

 Most of all, consider the battle 

 of the mind. This widow in a remote town of West Bengal 

 has possibly grown up in an environment where phones were 

 bulky instruments seen in the houses of the rich and famous. 

 Her world was post card and inland letters. For her to get 

 acquainted with a completely new communication technology, 

 not feel threatened by it, and then feel courageous enough 

 to embrace it, must by itself be considered significant. 

 Today she may have actually reached a mental state where 

 she would trust the new technology for something as critical 

 as her daughters well being. That is nothing short of a 

 remarkable marketing feat.

 It takes not only hours of thinking 

 and planning but weeks and months of toil to achieve the 

 state of popularity and penetration that mobile phones have 

 achieved. Indeed, contrary to popular belief, many marketing 

 men earn their keep not by pulling wool over the consumers 

 eyes but by making them brighter.

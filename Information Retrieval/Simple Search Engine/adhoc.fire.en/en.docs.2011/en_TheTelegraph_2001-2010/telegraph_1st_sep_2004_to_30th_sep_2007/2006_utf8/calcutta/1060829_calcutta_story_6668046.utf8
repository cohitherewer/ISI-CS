The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 CMDA agenda to boost coffers

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has drawn up a list of measures to realise dues amounting to a staggering Rs 250 crore, in an attempt to shore up its sagging finances.

 It is also gearing up for raising internal revenues and economising revenue expenditure. Certain units have been identified for the purpose.

 Officials said stringent action has been planned against defaulters for effective recovery of the dues. 

 Besides, the authorities will order a probe to find out whether employees are fudging figures to help defaulters.

 We will promptly act against employees found guilty, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.

 An official said the authorities are also readying a plan for economising revenue expenditure, which will include handing over completed assets to the urban local bodies concerned for curtailing the operation and maintenance costs.

 Curbs will be imposed on the use of vehicles and telephones and on consumption of electricity to rein in the rising expenditure. The tender procedure is being revised to usher in uniformity, clarity and transparency.

 Among other measures being planned to generate funds are profitable exploitation of unused stackyards and disposition of redundant road-rollers. Also on the anvil are commercial exploitation of the Maniktala staff campus and redeployment of engineering and technical officers. 

 The authorities are even planning privatisation of certain sectors. All new water supply schemes will be planned in such a way that the distribution network could be privatised. 

 A list has been prepared to assign responsibilities to specific departments. The electrical and mechanical departments will look after collection of water charges and the traffic and transportation department and the electrical and mechanical wings will be responsible for collection of royalties, advertisement rents and other charges.

 The headquarters (finance) will monitor the receipt of funds from the state government against allocation in the budget and from the Centre under the megacity and other sponsored schemes.

 Chief executive officer Baviskar said the CMDA has paid back external loans with great difficulty. Unless it is an emergency, we will not borrow any more.

 The steps to boost the finances have been welcomed by the unions. Action should have been taken long ago. But better late than never, said P.B. Nag, general secretary, Development Employees Joint Action Committee.

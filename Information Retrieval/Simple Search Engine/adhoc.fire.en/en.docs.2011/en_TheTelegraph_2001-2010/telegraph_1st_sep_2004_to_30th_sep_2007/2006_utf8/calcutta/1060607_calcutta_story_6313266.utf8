 Roll back, play the guitar, step to the seven stars or stand like a garden cockroach. This is not an attempt to write a rock number. These are names of Tai Chi movements, the ancient Chinese exercise. 

 Created by Taoist Chan Sang Feng about 600 years ago, Tai Chi, which means supreme energy, began as a martial art, but is purely a health exercise now. A secret for emperors and their families alone for years, some Masters let it out to the non-Chinese community, says K.V. Subramanyan from Bangalore, in town to conduct a workshop at Solace, the day spa at Sunny Park. Subramanyan follows the Cheng Man Ching tradition, the art that travelled to Taiwan, Malaysia and then America. 

 His class may not have had Hollywood stars Jennifer Aniston or Courteney Cox Arquette along with her husband David, all Tai Chi followers, but was an interesting mix, including a scientist, a language professor, a physiotherapist and a government executive. They attended the two-day session stretching to eight hours each day. Instead of the peppy music of the usual group exercise class, there was silence, occasionally interrupted by Subramanyans voice. 

 Unlike other types of exercise that leave you drained, Tai Chi energises you, said Rahul Banerjee, the scientist who attended the session. 

 Do this

 Tai Chi requires extremely slow movements and their repetitions. The Cheng Man Ching tradition has movements like garden cockroach standing on one leg, stork spreading the wings, play the guitar and step to the seven stars. 

 The practice could either be a Short Form (which has 37 main movements, complemented by 28 repetitions) or the Long Form, consisting of 108 movements. There are advanced practices like the Sword Form, says Subramanyan. 

 Morning, he says, is the best time to practise Tai Chi. One hour after dinner induces sound sleep. The early hours between 3 am and 4 am are the best but 6 am to 7 am is also okay, he adds. 

 Loose-fitting cotton garments are advised during the practice, accompanied by special Tai Chi footwear. 

 Feel that

 For its calming effect, Tai Chi is suitable for anyone who is stressed. The Chinese art believes that the energy that humans lose every moment can be conserved through daily practice. 

 The exercise promises to help attain the pliability of a child along with the mind of a sage and is best suited for an older age group, preferably 25-plus. A certain level of stability and maturity in the mind is a must for this exercise, adds Subramanyan. 

 He lists the advantages of practising Tai Chi: 

 Increases flexibility. 

 Reduces stress levels. 

 Improves breathing, making it deeper. 

 Induces softness in daily physical movements. 

 Helps decrease knee pains and other joint aches. 

 Increases sensitivity towards the environment. 

 Says fitness expert Preetom Mukherjee-Roy: Its definitely as easy as it looks on TV. Though it is low impact, your body feels so worked out. Its great for the lower body, posture and strengthening core muscles. 

 Some felt more relaxed and found it easier to breathe. Others in the class noticed a greater change. In two days I felt a difference in my body co-ordination, says French professor Trinanjan Chakrobarty. The two-day workshop at Solace was tagged at Rs 1,500.

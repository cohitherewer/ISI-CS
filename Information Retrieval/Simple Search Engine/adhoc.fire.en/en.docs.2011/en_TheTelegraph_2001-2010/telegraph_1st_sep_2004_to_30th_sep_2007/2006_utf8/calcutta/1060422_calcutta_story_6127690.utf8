 Calcutta Girls? High School joined a select band of city schools on Friday to have a commemorative stamp to its name. 

 Chief postmaster-general P.K. Chatterjee unveiled the issue in the presence of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya at the school on its 150th anniversary. 

 The school became a part of a philatelic tradition that has paid tribute to the likes of Bethune Collegiate School and Calcutta Blind School.

 ?A stamp carries a message far and wide. You can use your school?s stamp to tell your friends about the day?s events by mail,? the chief postmaster-general urged the students, ruing how the generation shies away from writing letters. ?Are we losing the habit of thinking?? he wondered.

 The mayor stressed on how women?s education was an uphill task 150 years ago, when the school was founded by Lord Clive. Meant for English-speaking girls, it was handed over to the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1877. 

 ?Girls were reared to be married off then and heavens, it was believed, would fall on those seeking education,? Bhattacharyya said. The tenor carried into a skit entitled Child Unborn, put up later by students, which showed how discrimination against daughters continues even today.

 Outside, though, the mood was merry, what with a stamp exhibition being put up by the students with help from Asish Chakraborty, Calcutta GPO?s Philatelic Bureau supervisor. 

 Taniya Bharadwaj took pride of place next to her collection on the evolution of transport, from balloons to satellites. The Class X girl, who started off with a gift of stamps from a neighbour, found company in Spandita Ghosh of Class VIII, who had also exhibited her stamps and used the occasion to renew her philatelic account with the GPO at a special counter, from where the new stamps were selling thick and fast. Eight lakh copies have been printed.

 The star of the show was the principal?s own collection. ?I had to take the albums down from the loft,? Beulah Raju said, lamenting how the school?s philatelic club had to shut down due to pressure of studies. The stamp itself was the result of long perseverance. ?We had written to the postal department in February 2005.? 

 The chief postmaster-general was not far off the mark. 

 Among those who were queuing up to buy the stamp, none confessed to being a letter-writer. ?Stamp-collection is also on a downward curve in India. Activities like these will enthuse youngsters,? felt leading philatelist Sekhar Chakrabarti.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Channels back on the beam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 After the hide-and-seek, the STAR bouquet of channels finally returned to all parts of the city on Thursday.

 STAR had switched on multi-system operator (MSO) Manthan late on Tuesday, but the MSO curiously denied viewers the beam throughout Wednesday. 

 With STAR and SitiCable reaching a resolution in the early hours of Thursday, subscribers of both MSOs awoke to find the STAR channels back on their screens.

 ?For the first time in the Calcutta market, there were no compromises made with MSOs or unions. SitiCable had to sign the same contract as MSOs in the rest of the country. We stood our ground and are happy with the results,? said Yash Khanna, senior vice-president (corporate affairs) for STAR India.

 Especially for Calcutta viewers STAR will air edited recap episodes of its weekday primetime show Pyaar Ke Do Naam Ek Raadha, Ek Shyaam on May 14 and 21. 

 STAR had switched off Manthan in March for dues. SitiCable yanked the STAR beam off its network in solidarity with Manthan and protesting STAR?s ?high-handedness?, in April. Both MSOs had also claimed their operators were leading the protest.

 ?It is true that we have not received some of the demands we made, but we made an honest attempt on behalf of the viewer,? said Alok Sharma of Forum of Cable Operators.

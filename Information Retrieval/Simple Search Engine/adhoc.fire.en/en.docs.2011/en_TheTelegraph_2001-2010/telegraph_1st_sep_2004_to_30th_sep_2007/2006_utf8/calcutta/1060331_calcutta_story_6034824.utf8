 Techno India Fest 2006 presents an evening of music and entertainment along with a percussion performance that brings together the liveliest melodies from all over the world. Featuring Abhishek Basu?s World Music Project, ISM ? Impromptu Symphonic Mind, the presentation is based on world music compositions by Basu himself. Influenced by Indian classical ragas, as well as jazz, Latin, Afro music, and some rock tunes, it represents a complete, sonorous union of diverse rhythms and beats. With Basu playing the tabla, pakhawaj, darbukka (Egyptian drum) and kanjira (south Indian instrument), as well as some mouth percussions, the highlight of the 90-minute concert will be his exciting and innovative rhythmic combinations. Supporting musicians: Indradeep Ghosh (violin), Ratul Shankar (drums), Sourav Roy (keyboards), Ambarish Das (classical vocal), Anindita Chatterjee (vocal) and Arnab (Latin percussions including kahon and djembe).

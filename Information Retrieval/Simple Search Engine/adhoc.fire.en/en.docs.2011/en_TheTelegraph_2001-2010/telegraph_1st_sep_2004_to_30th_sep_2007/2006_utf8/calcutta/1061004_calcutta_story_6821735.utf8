The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road, drain revamp

 KINSUK BASU 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has drawn up a twin plan of upgrading a few key roads on the eastern fringe leading to EM Bypass and revamping the drainage system along them.

 The thrust is on the Rashbehari Connector, with around Rs 3.5 crore being allotted for it. The money will be spent on redoing the surface, replacing the median dividers and revamping the drainage channels along the artery. 

 The repairs will carry a three-year warranty.

 Among the other roads on the touch-up list are the Prince Anwar Shah Connector and the one linking Ruby Hospital and Calcutta International School. Work is likely to start by end-October.

 The projects together will cost more than Rs 5 crore.

 We dont want to take up work on a piecemeal basis, said CMDA CEO P. Baviskar. Along with repairing the roads, we would like to improve the drainage system, too, so water does not spill on to the road surface, washing away the asphalt layers.

 Chief engineer Debdas Bhattacharya said: Siltation over the years has reduced the capacity of the canal near Bosepukur that stretches up to Dhapa. Unless it is dredged, it will be difficult to drain out the water that accumulates along the Rashbehari Connector.

 The other channel to be dredged is Panchanantala Canal, leading to Tollygunge. That will save the Prince Anwar Shah Road Connector.

 Books and food need not be mutually exclusive. Though I personally do not eat at the Book Fair, I find nothing wrong with eateries on the fairground, especially since it is so large. I have never thought of the worlds of music and art as separate from that of books. Hence, a bit of music and art at the fair is always welcome. I know a group that brings out a poetry magazine and puts up a stall at the Book Fair every year. In the late-nineties, when the members were quite young, some of them used to strum songs with a guitar on the fairground. It used to be wonderful. I believe music, painting and handicraft add to the vibrancy of the Book Fair.

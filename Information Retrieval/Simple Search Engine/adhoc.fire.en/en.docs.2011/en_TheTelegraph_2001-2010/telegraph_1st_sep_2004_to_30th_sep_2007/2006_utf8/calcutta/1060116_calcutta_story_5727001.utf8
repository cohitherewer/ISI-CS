On a rare visit to Calcutta on Friday, Shah Rukh Khan 

spent two hours at a hospital and then answered a volley of filmi and non-filmi 

questions, reports Pratim D. Gupta

On Don: I start shooting for Farhan 

Akhtar?s Don in 20 days in Mauritius. It is one of the best screenplays 

I have come across. Still, I don?t think we would be able to outdo the original 

Don. It was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my childhood. 

So, I believe, for all those youngsters who are, say, in their teens or 20 years 

old and who have not been introduced to some of this great cinema, they will see 

the new Don. They should not be bereft of such great films.

On his other films: I have just completed shooting 

for Karan Johar?s Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. It should release some time in 

July. Then in August I start Happy New Year, which is a home production 

and will be directed by Farah Khan. I produced Main Hoon Na and Paheli 

in a span of 11 months, two films which are as different as they get. Happy 

New Year will again be a commercial film. It?s not about what kind of films 

I want to do. It?s more about what kind of films directors come to me with. This 

year, I will just have two releases ? Don and Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna. 

So, I would let other actors do better this year. I have also committed to Shimit?s 

(Amin, of Ab Tak Chhappan fame) film which is tentatively titled Chak 

De and is about the Indian hockey team.

On Paheli: I was myself pleasantly surprised 

when Paheli was selected as India?s entry for the Oscars this year. We 

have hired the best publicists in Hollywood to try and pitch the film to the Academy 

members. Three ladies are heading this publicity company (Rogers and Coen) and 

they are doing whatever they can to make Paheli be seen there. The whole 

Oscar campaign is too complicated a process to explain here. I have never been 

one who has tried to go to the West, but I am proud to represent my country. Without 

sounding immodest, I would like to say that the West can come to us.

On Calcutta: It is one of my favourite cities. 

I do not find enough excuses to come to Calcutta. The last time I was here must 

be five years back (for the Anandalok Awards). Very few people know that 

during my university days, my final project was an audio-visual on Calcutta. I 

have been here many times, done a lot of theatre with kids and with Anamika Kala 

Sangam. I have also stayed in a lot of hotels here. The city is definitely the 

cultural centre of the country. You have such great films of Mr Ray. I would love 

to bring my Temptations show to Calcutta. But it is such a costly affair with 

so many stars that it would be unaffordable. As for my doing a Bengali film, I 

think no one has approached me after hearing my Bengali in Devdas!

On smoking: My smoking habit is a personal 

choice and not for public consumption. But I did make a resolution to cut down 

on smoking when I turned 40. The youth should not take to smoking. Those who don?t 

smoke should never smoke. I am too old to give up on bad habits. But I have cut 

down by one-hundredth of what I used to smoke. The entire time that I was here 

(AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria), did I smoke at all? 

On healthcare: That?s the reason I have come 

here. When last November, Aditya (Agarwal) and Manish (Goenka) came to me in New 

York on the sets of Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna, they wanted me to come and be 

part of the inaugural celebrations of their new building at AMRI Hospitals. I 

agreed immediately because of two reasons. One is the Emami family? who are all 

very nice people and of course I am their brand ambassador. Secondly because of 

the noble cause. Doing something for healthcare is doing something for humanity. 

And whatever little I know of medicine and medical facilities, I believe this 

is not only one of the best hospitals here but also in India. It was very nice 

meeting the children and also patients of the general ward. For people outside 

the hospital, I just pray that we do not have to come here and go through all 

this.

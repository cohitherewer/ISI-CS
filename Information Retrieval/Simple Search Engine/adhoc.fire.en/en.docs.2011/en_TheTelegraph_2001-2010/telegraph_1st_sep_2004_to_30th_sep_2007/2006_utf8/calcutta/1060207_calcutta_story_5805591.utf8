 Though men appear to be gregarious and sociable by nature, there remains, at the core of their hearts, a strain of sorrowful loneliness. Capturing the mood of sadness and solitude that characterises human disposition, Asit Ghara?s exhibition of paintings focuses on the more serious and sombre aspects of our lives. Featuring works depicting women and nature, the show draws interesting parallels between human expressions and nature?s demeanour in times of stress, turmoil and upheavals. While portraying glimpses of the graceful beauty of life and nature, in its vibrant, luminous and gentle appearances, Ghara retains a consciousness of the fact that life is but fleeting and all living beings progress steadily towards their inevitable extinction. More prominently, feminine countenances are the major means of his artistic expression. His bold contours, with their lines and ridges and interplay of light and shade, clearly underscore the melancholic melody of our lives.

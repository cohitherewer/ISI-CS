The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Five parks, car parks below

 - Feelers from Europe fan civic hopes

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Encouraged by offers from firms in Europe and Asia, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to set up parking plazas under at least five parks.

 We are identifying the parks suitable for building hi-tech underground parking plazas. The possibility of building underground lots elsewhere is also being explored, stated chief engineer (civil) Nilangshu Bose. 

 The preliminary shortlist includes Deshapriya Park in south Calcutta, Shraddhananda Park near Sealdah, Macpherson Park on Theatre Road, New Park on CIT Road, Harish Park on Harish Mukherjee Road and Deshbandhu Park on Raja Dinendra Street, according to civic sources.

 The civic authorities have reportedly planned to approach the army for permission to construct a parking bay under Citizens Park.

 We have received offers from firms in Korea, Denmark and Holland to set up hi-tech parking lots. More business queries are coming in, confirmed municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.

 We will soon invite letters of interest from the firms. The selection will be made on the basis of the technology and financial package offered by them, added Bandyopadhyay.

 The municipal commissioner said the parking plazas will be joint venture projects, under the public-private participation scheme. 

 The CMC will only provide land on a lease of 20 or 30 years to the builders. The revenue is likely to be shared. 

 The move follows construction of a parking plaza under Lindsay Street, in front of the New Market clock tower. It is expected to be commissioned fully by the end of the year.

 The plan for the mega parking lot under Chaplin Park, opposite the civic headquarters, has, however, been revised. 

 The civic body had decided to build a lot for about 1,000 cars under the park, using Dutch technology. After receiving offers from other foreign builders, the corporation board wants to explore options before proceeding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cry for bribery helpline

 - Traders allege police apathy in dealing with complaints

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Installing helplines for the aged and providing medical help to all are fine; but there should be a hotline at the Lalbazar police headquarters to deal with complaints of harassment by the force itself.

 This is what the traders of the Burrabazar-Posta area and the members of Burrabazar Nagarik Front have said in a memorandum to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday. 

 They have sought his intervention in activating a helpline that will enable them to lodge complaints against corrupt policemen. 

 ?Bribe-taking is a burning issue in this trade turf. We have to give money to cops ranging from constables to officers,? said Amit Pandey, assistant secretary of the traders? organisation.

 ?Senior officers at the headquarters are aware of it. But no action has been taken against those who are giving the force a bad name,? he added.

 According to traders, low-level policemen target hawkers who ply their trade by encroaching on pavements. 

 ?They extort Rs 150 to Rs 500 from each of the hawkers every month. Apart from these, a great number of deals involving lakhs are conducted under the table,? said a businessman, on condition of anonymity.

 The organisation also demanded installation of closed-circuit television cameras at Burrabazar and Posta police stations. 

 ?When a trader goes there to lodge a complaint against extortion and bribery, officers hardly pay any attention. The cameras will at least prove that we sought police assistance,? said the trader.

 A senior officer at Lalbazar, however, ruled out the possibility of installing a helpline to deal with complaints against cops demanding bribes. 

 ?There may be a handful of policemen who take bribes and we always take action once they are proved guilty. But I think most of the men in the force are honest,? the officer added.

 He elaborated: ?It is essential to understand that Calcutta Police is a clean and efficient organisation. The bad pennies that inevitably exist, we can take care of.?

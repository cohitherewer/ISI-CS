 The Bidhan Sarani address made famous by Uttam Kumar and Sabitri Chatterjee on stage will now play host to Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai on screen.

 After more than a year of dilly-dallying, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has entrusted the running and operation of Star theatre to a private player, who is gearing up to turn the historical venue into a cultural centre complete with films, theatre, jatra, eateries and adda.

 Priya Entertainment Pvt Ltd took over Star, recently renovated at a cost of Rs 1.15 crore, from the CMC on Saturday. The company was informed that the ?offer of the management of Star theatre complex through public-private partnership has been accepted? in a letter dated May 20.

 The main auditorium will screen films, and with that, Star will come under the regular chain of halls exhibiting English, Hindi and Bengali movies. ?We will not go for run-of-the mill films but those with a different sensibility. I would have probably opened it with The Da Vinci Code. It will take 45 to 60 days for us to unveil the new Star theatre,? said Priya proprietor Arijit Dutta. Keeping the north Calcutta crowd in mind, ticket prices would be much lower than multiplexes. 

 The auditorium will also host cultural events, ranging from film festivals to theatre, jatra to Poila Baisakh programmes. ?We will strive to make Star a national theatre, a concept that Sisir Bhaduri had conceived,? said Dutta. 

 One of the exhibition centres can be utilised for workshops, book releases, author meets and mini awards, while the other on the mezzanine floor will have a ?coffee house atmosphere?. The open-air theatre will target the youth. The top level will house two restaurants. There are plans for a theatre archive called Binodinir Smarane.

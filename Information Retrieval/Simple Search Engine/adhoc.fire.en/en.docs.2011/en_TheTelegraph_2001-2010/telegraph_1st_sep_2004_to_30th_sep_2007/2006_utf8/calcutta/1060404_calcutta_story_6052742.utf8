The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Bill rage will shut school doors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Classes in more than 700 missionary schools, including some reputed Anglo-Indian institutions, will remain suspended on Tuesday as a mark of protest.

 The school authorities said the suspension of classes was part of the first phase of the agitation for withdrawal of the School Service Commission (Amendment) Bill 2006.

 The bill, passed in the Assembly on February 20, makes it mandatory for state-aided minority institutions to recruit teachers and headmasters through the school service commission.

 Schools run by the Calcutta diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) are, however, not participating in Tuesday?s programme, spokesperson Suman Biswas clarified on Monday.

 The CNI schools include La Martiniere for Boys, La Martiniere for Girls, St James and Pratt Memorial. Though the CNI is opposed to the bill, it has decided to pursue a separate movement to persuade the government to withdraw it.

 Schools run by the Catholic churches, including the Don Bosco group, Loreto branches, Holy Child and Christ Church, as well as those run by Jesuit Brothers, will take part in Tuesday?s agitation.

 ?If the bill is not withdrawn in the first Assembly session after the elections, we will fast unto death,? said Herod Mullick, general secretary of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba (BCP).

 Apart from the BCP, many religious and linguistic bodies, like the GNLF, Madarsa Students? Union, Confederation of Dalits and Minorities and All-Bengal Minority Youth Federation, have expressed solidarity with the cause.

 Father Faustine Brank, a spokesperson for the West Bengal Association of Christian Schools and a Roman Catholic priest, said the state government had passed the bill unilaterally, without consulting the church authorities.

 The church schools are opposed to the bill, as it infringes on the rights granted to them in the Constitution. ?The founding fathers of the Constitution had carefully included some guidelines under Article 30 to safeguard the character of the missionary schools. The government cannot take away those rights,? asserted Brank.

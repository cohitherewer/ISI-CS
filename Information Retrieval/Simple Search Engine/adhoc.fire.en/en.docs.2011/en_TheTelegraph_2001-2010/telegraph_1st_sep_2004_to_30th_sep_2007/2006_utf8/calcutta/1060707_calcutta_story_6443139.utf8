 Justice cry to rights panel

 Meera Acharya: A family denied

 Ever since 40-year-old Meera Acharya died in police firing 22 years ago, her family has been living on generous assurances of help from the state. 

 But nothing concrete has materialised, prompting the family to move the state human rights commission. 

 On November 7, 1984, Meera was critically injured when a bullet, fired ?accidentally? by a sergeant at the Rashbehari Avenue crossing, pierced her abdomen. She was put in SSKM Hospital, where she died on November 18.

 The mother of three children was returning home to Budge Budge after offering puja at Kalighat temple. Younger daughter Ruby, who could not see, accompanied her.

 ?Soon after the mishap, officers at Lalbazar assured me of financial help and a job. As asked by them, I submitted all relevant papers, but they have not bothered to send a reply,? said Meera?s husband Narendranath, a cardiac patient. He had lost his jute mill job before his wife died.

 After son Raju came of age, Narendranath pleaded with the police brass for a job for him. But it was a repeat of the earlier ritual of encouraging words amounting to nothing.

 Narendranath then sent an appeal to then chief minister Jyoti Basu. The appeal was accepted, but job and money remained elusive.

 ?My financial condition was getting worse by the day. I managed to get my elder daughter married to a local youth. But I could neither continue Raju?s education nor Ruby?s treatment,? he said.

 After Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee became chief minister, Narendranath again went to Writers? Buildings with Raju. ?But we could not meet him as he was busy. His secretariat promised us help,? Narendranath recalled.

 After a few days, Raju alone went to Writers? to meet the chief minister. Again, he was denied an audience. ?Instead, the officials told me that if I could collect Rs 10,000, they would help me procure an autorickshaw,? Raju said.

 ?We are now pinning our hopes on the rights commission,? said Raju.

 Panel chief Justice (retired) Shyamal Sen said: ?After going through the papers and facts, we will see to it that the family gets justice.?

 The Bluffmaster look 

 Kajols Fanaa skirts on Saptami, Rani Mukherjees rainbow saris from Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna on Ashtami and Soha Ali Khans denim turn-ups and tunics from Rang De Basanti for pandal-hopping on Navami night. All accessorised with Preitys long necklaces, courtesy KANK again. Theres something for the men as well the layered look of linen jackets from Bluffmaster and summer suits from KANK.

 Filmi fashion for the festive season is a must flaunt, and this year is no exception. Though there hasnt been a super-stylish trendsetting film like Devdas, Parineeta or Bunty Aur Babli, KANK in its first month promises to be the haute hope this Puja, followed by Fanaa for Kajol. The KANK look has clicked, says creator Manish Malhotra, because of its timely reflection of the current seasons look classic.

 With the screen rage rubbing off on the racks from New Market to Forum to Gariahat Tollywood designer Agnimitra Paul puts it down to the click factor.

 Something that is modifiable, easy-to-copy yet novel, something that a young girl should be able to explain to her local tailor.

 Designer Megha Dalmia of studio M amp;S who went big with Bablis patialas last Puja feels filmi trends make both design and business sense. Films give great ideas and they are easy to sell.

 This time, her focal point is Kajols silhouette in Fanaa. We had been making long skirts and kurtis for some time but the silhouette got a boost as soon as Kajol wore them. And once they are branded as Fanaa, they fly off shelves, explains Megha. 

 Agrees Amit Kumar, who supplies outfits to Sriram Arcade, Metro Plaza, Emami Market, Vardaan Market, and several stores in north Calcutta. The cotton block-printed skirts from Fanaa in various hues are favourites this festive season, says Amit.

 If the Fanaa factor is about an old design getting a facelift thanks to a new film, the KANK craze is more about a whole new look.

 The simplicity of Ranis chiffons and nets coming together with the surprise sensuality of velvet halters and animal prints; Abhishek colouring his staid stripes bright and infusing a dash of floral fusion.

 Those not keen to buy the Bluffmaster or KANK can take the Rang De Basanti route. And not just for Sohas turned-up denims and kurtas. Ask DJ Girish for his style statement of the season and he says: I love Karans look in Rang De (played by Siddharth). He wore smart formal shirts with jeans. Thats going to be my pick this Puja.

 So, its time for you to hop on to the Bollywood boat before the Devi catches her dola.

 Manager in loan scam net

 - Crores sanctioned against garments, forged documents 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 A former senior manager of a nationalised bank has been arrested by the detective department for allegedly helping a duo obtain home loans amounting to Rs 6 crore for 11 housing projects, all of them fictitious. 

 S. Bhupati Raj, in his forties, was held at his Chennai residence on Friday. He was produced in a city court on Monday and remanded in police custody till March 10.

 Raj worked in the Lansdowne branch of the bank. He is the first bank manager to be arrested in recent years on the charge of a home loan fraud. 

 The loans were granted in 2003 and 2004. Raj quit his post about 18 months ago.

 Investigations suggest that he was instrumental in Kaushik Nag and Monoranjan Roy bagging not only home loans, but also trade loans.

 The youths had floated two fake companies ? Dawsons Goods Private Limited and Grover Commerce Private Limited ? and sought trade loans from the bank against collateral security. 

 Nag was arrested on March 18 last year. Roy was held soon after.

 ?The collateral security was nothing more than two huge boxes of garments. Since the senior manager of the bank was reportedly hand-in-glove with the duo, a trade loan of more than a crore was sanctioned,? said detective department chief Gyanwant Singh.

 ?We have found out that Raj allowed total self-withdrawal of the trade loan amount, which is in total violation of the banking rules,? he added. 

 The officers investigating the case claimed that the youths had confessed to paying Raj between Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore.

 ?We are yet to ascertain how much money Raj made out of the deal. We have found evidence that soon after the loans were sanctioned, large amounts were transferred to his wife?s bank account,? Singh stated.

 According to police, nine other youths were involved in home loan scam, which is turning out to be the biggest in the past few years. They had teamed up to procure loans from a number of private and public-sector banks by taking the employees into confidence.

 Some of loan applications made by the team were in the name of people who do not exist. The documents presented along with the applications were forged by the youths.

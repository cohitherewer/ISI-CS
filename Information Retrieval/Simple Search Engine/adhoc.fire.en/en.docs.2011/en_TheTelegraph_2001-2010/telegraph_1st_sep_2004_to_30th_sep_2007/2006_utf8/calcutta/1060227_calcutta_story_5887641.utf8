 Optimism in soul-ar quest

 - EX-MUSICIAN TURNED PAINTER WHILE TREATING LEPROSY PATIENTS

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 FROM PAIN TO PAINTINGS: Artist Joy Bhaduri explains one of his canvases

 ?You may say I learnt painting while caring for leprosy patients at the Titagarh centre run by the Missionaries of Charity. Splicing through bandages, cleaning and scraping wounds, applying medicine? were preparations for ?artistic technique?,? says Joy Bhaduri, whose first solo exhibition Scrapes is currently on at the Academy of Fine Arts. It will be followed by another at Arpana Caur?s art gallery in Delhi this March. He is also planning a European tour with his Italian wife Sara.

 ?Leaving the Bangla band Krosswindz had been a shattering experience and the Nineties found me immersed in all kinds of welfare projects. At the Titagarh centre, I met a patient called Baba, who told me ?if you are in pain, don?t be a pain, be a painter instead?. Yet Baba himself had lost both hands and legs to the disease,? recalls Bhaduri. A subsequent spiritual quest in the Vedas and Zen philosophy was supplemented by a self-imposed study of masterpieces by the likes of Kandinsky, Pollock and Abanindranath Tagore. Many months of experimentation and hard work yielded a painting (aluminium paints on wood board, 55x5 ft) shown at the RCGC, participation in group-shows (Calcutta, Kodaikanal and Pune) and Scrapes.

 On till February 28, Scrapes is a celebration of colour and texture. The brilliant blues, reds, yellows and greens don?t just fill the geometric forms and spaces between areas of pure black. They flare like flames or shower gently down like light, they acquire a metallic hardness or disappear in a haze, and they twist like roots or embody myriad shadowy forms like dreams. 

 ?A rag, a blower, some brushwork, a few washes were all that was needed,? says the artist, who takes care to label each canvas in Sanskrit, English or Italian. The works were influenced by various experiences ? Mother Teresa?s death inspired Agnes and Carlos Santana?s Chill Out inspired Chiller. 

 The works resemble scrapes or fragments of something that wasn?t taken forward or given the required depth. Whether these are mere appetisers to a more sumptuous visual treat or whether Bhaduri will now concentrate on using his artistic and literary skills to attract more funds for streetchildren, leprosy and AIDS victims remains to be seen. But this ?soular expressionist? painter will always continue to be an optimist. As he quotes from one of his recent lyrics, ?In life shines the soul of heaven/Where love blooms the spirit of men/Kind chances bind the humankind/Enlightening minds in the darkest night.?

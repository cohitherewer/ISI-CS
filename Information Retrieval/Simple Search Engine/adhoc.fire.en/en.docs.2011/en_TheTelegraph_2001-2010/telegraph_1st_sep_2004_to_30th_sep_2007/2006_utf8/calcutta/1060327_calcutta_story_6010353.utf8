 What: Bakery competition. Where: Incognito at Taj Bengal.

 When: March 23.

 Take a look: Twenty two chefs from Taj Bengal battled it out in the bread and pre-plated dessert competition. The panel of judges included food critics Rajan Bali and Oindrilla Dutt.

 From Cheese French Bread to Spicy Herb Bread to Arabian Tea Time Bread to Twisted Doughnut, the bread section saw innovation and creativity at its best. Breads in flavours sweet, salty and tangy were displayed in an array of eye-catching ways. While some displays illustrated village landscapes of waterfalls and coconut trees, others resembled baskets and fruits. The participants in this category were judged on the basis of presentation, taste and texture.

 The dessert section matched the creativity of the bread corner. Logs, broken bricks, Bhagat Singh? contestants drew inspiration from it all.

 While one presentation put forward a social message to quit smoking, another illustrated how one begins a day with a cup of coffee while reading The Telegraph. Chefs whipped up sumptuous sweet ends like The Cup of Coffee (a three dimensional chocolate cup filled with soft coffee mousse), Sundried Succulent Mangoes with Mascarpone Cheese and White Chocolate Velvet and Almond Praline in Chocolate Flower. Judges looked into the presentation, taste and innovation.

 In the bread category, Domnic Samuel, Chintaman Maske and Jay Shankar Jha walked away with the first, second and third prizes. In the dessert section, Indrajit Mukherjee and Alok Das were declared winners.

 Voiceover: As chefs, one always cooks up dishes on the menu or what guests want. Occasions like this help them go beyond that and showcase their talent. The items that these chefs have come up with are a value addition to our menu bank, smiled executive chef of Taj Bengal, Sujan Mukherjee.

 French fare

 What: French cookery competition.

 Where: The French Association.

 When: March 24, evening.

 An open-air affair on the terrace of the institute saw friends, family, faculty members and students enjoying themselves with music and food. The competition had 30 students trying their hand at French cuisine and whipping up French Entree (starters), Plats Principaux (main course) and desserts. Salade De Frute, Crepe Aux Pommes and Boeuf Bourguignon? The dishes with strong French flavours were named accordingly too.

After a long tasting session, Tejaswini Jhunjhunwala and Maria Chatterjee won the best starters and best dessert awards respectively. For main course it was Nidhi Agarwal and Shreya Sen.

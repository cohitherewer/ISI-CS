 After making Kajol look a million bucks in Fanaa, Manish Malhotra, along with designer Vikram Phadnis, is set to bring the IIFA Awards alive. For the first time in six years, the IIFA Foundation will be hosting a fashion show and not a sports event to raise money for charity.

 To be part of the three-day filmi celebrations in Dubai, the IIFA Foundation Fashion Extravaganza will have some of India?s leading models and film stars walking the ramp to support the noble cause. They will be sporting a signature line of jewellery, specially designed by Rosyblue to match the collection being showcased by Manish and Vikram.

 The IIFA Fashion Extravaganza evening will be hosted by Dia Mirza and will also feature Karan Johar on stage, who will interview some of his film-star friends including Anil Kapoor, Lara Dutta and Riteish Deshmukh. The show will end with an electrifying performance by British Asian hip-hop band Hunters.

 Discovery Channel is re-running its special World Cup series on the giants of the game, World Cup Shootout, over consecutive days at 9 pm. From the first World Cup in 1930 through to the climax of the current competition in Germany 76 years later, the show will look beyond events on the pitch to understand the real emotions.

 On Monday, it?s England, the first nation to win as hosts in 1966. With a passionate fan base and the superstar status of their players, they have always shared a love-hate relationship with the sport they invented.

 Over to 2006 hosts Germany on Tuesday. In the 1954 final, they were the underdogs against the Hungarians. An extraordinary comeback laid the foundation for future dominance.

 Wednesday is for Italy and Paolo Rossi?s goal-scoring marvel. Their World Cup victory in 1982 ended a 52-year wait for their supporters.

 Last comes France on Thursday. The 1998 champions had included 15 players in the squad from different ethnic backgrounds embodied by Zidane, Desailly and Lizarazu.

 The most racially troubled country in Europe pulled off a stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil, which led to days of euphoria across a nation united by soccer glory. 

 A dozen takes on dwindling wildlife and environmental changes will be beamed by Animal Planet on June 5, World Environment Day. The package of fascinating films on global environmental issues can be seen from noon to midnight. 

 First up is Return of the Pandas on two pandas brought from China to the US. There is a film on saving endangered mountain gorillas (Saving Uganda?s Wildlife) and one on relocating gorillas reared in England (Gorilla Gorilla). From efforts to save the Mexican Grey wolves (Wolf: Return to the Wild) to one for the worlds fastest sprinter, Return of the Cheetah, the viewer will be spoilt for choice.

 A film on the efforts of elephant rescuers Soraida Salwala and Sangduen Chailert, founders of the Elephant Nature Park in Thailand (Elephant Rescue) is followed by one on Jane Goodall the conservationist and groundbreaking research in Jane Goodalls Return to Gombie. Warnings from the Wild highlights global warming and its impact on species. Hunt for the Rarest Whale follows conservationist Nan Hauser?s decade-old quest to understand the behaviour of prehistoric mammals.

 For tiger lovers there is The Temple of the Tigers about a unique refuge for 10 wild Bengal tigers in a Thailand monastery and two thought-provoking programmes on poaching and illegal trade in wildlife products. In Tiger Zero, conservationist narrator Valmik Thapar will raise concern over the dwindling tiger population. This World: Tiger Traffic leads to the discovery of a dead tigress and footage on a flourishing trade in tiger teeth and bones in the Myanmar market.

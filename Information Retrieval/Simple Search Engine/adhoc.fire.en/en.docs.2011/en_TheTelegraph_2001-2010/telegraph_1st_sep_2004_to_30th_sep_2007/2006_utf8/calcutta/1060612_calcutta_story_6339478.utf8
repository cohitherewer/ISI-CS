 Action plan for unsafe buildings

 Divya Mishra: Recently, a part of a building had collapsed on Chetla Hat Road. What is your action plan against such unsafe buildings in the city?

 The building department has served notices to 700 such buildings in the city. The owners of these buildings have been asked either to repair their structures or demolish them. The part of a building, which had collapsed at Chetla Hat Road, belongs to the CMDA. We had slapped a notice on the officer of the housing complex in December 1999.

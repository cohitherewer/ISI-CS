The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Clean bowled by Bips

 She finds him sexy, he finds her simple. KAY KAY MENON talks to Pratim D. Gupta about his Corporate co-star, cricket and more 

 Kay Kay Menon in Corporate, which releases on Friday

 So are you under house arrest, 

 thanks to the Mumbai rains?

 Mostly, but I have managed to do some pending dubbing work. But it?s been really frustrating being under water all the time.

 But your new release Corporate 

 is set to swim at the box-office. Are you excited about 

 it?

 To me, it?s just one more film I have worked hard for. I have told you before how after Paanch and Black Friday I have learnt to get detached from my films as soon as the shooting gets over. But Corporate was a fine experience ever since Madhur (Bhandarkar) called me up to offer the role. 

 What is your role in the film?

 I am up there in the hierarchy of the corporate ladder. I am also part of a corporate family in the film. I hold a top creative job. Bipasha on the other hand is an outsider who?s worked her way up through sheer merit. Then again the film is not just about the two of us, it?s got a slice of everything to do with corporate life. Like all of Madhur?s films, this one too is a collage, of the trials and tribulations in the corporate world. It is about the fight between ambitions and personal emotions.

 You worked with Ram Gopal Varma 

 on Sarkar. And now you have worked with Madhur who 

 assisted Varma for many years. Do you see any similarity 

 in their approach?

 I think in this short time, Madhur has been able to carve a niche for himself. He chooses to make films that have to do with daily life. Whether it?s Chandni Bar or Page 3 or Corporate, he has been able to make very human stories set in one particular sector.

 He?s also known to be a woman?s 

 director. Did you feel the pinch?

 It?s just that woman protagonists in his film tend to be stronger. Now, that?s his style. Even Ibsen had strong women characters in his plays. That?s something a writer or film-maker chooses for his career. It is entirely his prerogative. But as far as treatment on the sets goes, I didn?t feel anything like that. He respected everyone on equal terms.

 How was Bipasha as a co-star?

 I found her to be an extremely simple girl. She is uncomplicated and very easy to work with. And specially in Corporate she has shown a lot of poise.

 Bipasha has used her silences a lot and that?s something only an accomplished actor can do. There are scenes when she?s needed to hold the frame through silence and she has done that beautifully.

 She finds you the sexiest actor 

 around?

 (Laughs) I will be lying if I say I do not feel kicked about that. Any man would be happy if a lady finds him sexy. I take it as a compliment. How I look at it is that when you are working for a long time as an actor, the familiarity finally starts coming across on screen.

 And you now feel confident 

 enough to start dancing Bollywood ishtyle?

 I don?t think you can call what I did in Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd dancing. I play this nerdy Bengali husband named Partho. He and his wife, played by Raima Sen, are part of the group of seven middle-class couples travelling to Goa on a honeymoon. It?s like a satire on marriage where all the characters redeem themselves in the end. For me, the film is my first full-fledged attempt at humour. So there is this scene where all of us are in this yacht and my character just lets loose. It?s more like an opening up rather than dancing. I can dance as long as it?s not aerobics.

 How would you rate Raima as 

 an actress?

 She was fantastic. She was right there, bang on, in the character.

 What is your take on the controversy 

 about you playing Mohammed Azharuddin in Arindam Mitra?s 

 Shunya?

 See, if people go in to watch me play Azharuddin, they will be disappointed and the film will be a flop. Actually I am playing this successful sports person who has to go through all kinds of trials once he achieves a certain level. 

 Now since cricket is the most popular sport, it has been chosen to get easy access to the minds of the audiences. Most people in the country know what an LBW is rather than an off-side. Lagaan wouldn?t have been such a big hit had it been about football or hockey. 

 I am definitely not playing Azhar. My character of Mahendra Nayak just goes through this certain phase in life when he has to negotiate all kinds of things, including temptations.

 Are you happy with your mix 

 of films?

 Yes, I think I am being able to balance arthouse and commercial movies pretty well.

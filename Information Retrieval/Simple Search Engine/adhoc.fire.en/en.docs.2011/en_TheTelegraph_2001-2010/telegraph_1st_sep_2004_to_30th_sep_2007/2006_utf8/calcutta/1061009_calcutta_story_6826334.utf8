The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Forty and fashionable

 Benetton is 40 and the 1.8 billion 

 Euro-turnover group with a strong Italian character 

 is gearing up to celebrate its 40th anniversary at the Centre 

 Pompidou in Paris with the passion, verve and attention 

 to the future of a company that retains its identity, inspired 

 by life.

 Luciano Benetton, chairman of 

 the group, had launched Benetton in 1965 in Ponzano Veneto 

 near Treviso in north-east Italy with siblings Giuliana, 

 Gilberto and Carlo.

 Today, its an iconic name 

 in the fashion world with its brands the casual United 

 Colours of Benetton, fashion-oriented Sisley, Playlife leisurewear 

 and Killer Loop streetwear and produces around 115 million 

 garments every year.

 During his Calcutta visit last 

 November, the 70-plus Benetton group chairman had referred 

 to the city as bubbling with innate energy and 

 rolled out an aggressive retail roadmap, predicting a 40 

 per cent growth in 2006 alone.

 Luciano saw Calcutta on an equal 

 footing with any other Asian metro in terms of retail 

 potential. He had said the group wanted to be present in 

 every new mall coming up in the city. The Italian major 

 has plans to set up 20 Benetton outlets in the east by 2008, 

 hoping to notch up a century of stores nationally.

 Benetton, looking more at natural 

 markets like India rather than emerging economies, 

 is for now focusing all its attention on Paris.

 In the French capital, in the 

 prestigious spaces of the Parisian contemporary art institution, 

 Benetton will present a fashion show telling the story of 

 a brand that represents freedom, democracy of taste 

 and a simultaneously international and Italian lifestyle.

 At the same time, the Centre Pompidou 

 will present an exhibition entitled Fabrica: les yeux 

 ouverts, conceived together with Fabrica, the communication 

 research centre created from the business philosophy of 

 Benetton.

 We chose Paris as the location 

 for our celebrations because it represents, now more than 

 ever, the capital of international fashion, said the 

 Benetton Group chairman. The brand opened its first outlet 

 outside Italy on Boulevard St. Germain, Paris.

 The October 10 fashion show at 

 the Forum of Centre Pompidou (in support of the initiative 

 of the world food programme in the fight against hunger 

 in the world) will mark the first occasion when Benetton 

 creations would appear on the catwalk.

 The dominant theme will be wool, 

 the essence, together with colour, of the innovative spirit 

 of Benetton that, since the mid-60s, has revolutionised 

 style for everyday living and leisure. Items created specially 

 for the occasion will be exhibited, a collection without 

 time or season, multiethnic and global.

 Fabrica, Benettons communication 

 research centre, created in 1994 from the groups cultural 

 heritage, will also have a strong presence in Paris.

 From October 6 to November 6, 

 the Centre Pompidou will showcase Fabricas research 

 projects, developed through various forms of expression 

 design, photography, cinema, music, publishing projects 

 and new media.

 A parallel cinema and music festival 

 will also be held throughout the period of the exhibition. 

 Co-produced by Fabrica Cinema, this will feature 2002 Academy 

 Award winner No Mans Land by Danis Tanovic, 

 besides Blackboards by young Iranian director Samira 

 Makmahlbaf and Seventeen Years by Chinas Zhang 

 Yuan.

 Back home in Calcutta, a 5,000-sq 

 ft lifestyle flagship store is in the offing, likely to 

 be laid out on Shakespeare Sarani by Benettons sole 

 city franchisee Marda Collections, which has outlets in 

 Forum and City Centre.

 Luciano Benetton, 

 chairman of the 1.8 billion Euro-turnover group, spoke to 

 Subhro Saha on the eve of its anniversary gala

 Q: Your group celebrates 

 its 40th anniversary at the Pompidou Centre in Paris on 

 October 10. What gives you most pleasure today and what 

 has been Benettons true strength?

 A: What gives 

 me most pleasure is thinking about the future, looking ahead 

 to the next 40 years, to the new markets that are opening 

 up, such as India for example, where we want to establish 

 an increasing presence, enabling us to respond to consumers 

 requests. I think this is exactly Benettons strength, 

 the fact that it looks ahead and doesnt rest on its 

 laurels, working with people first and foremost 

 our partners to continue to improve each day as 

 though it were the first.

 Q: Benettons first shop outside Italy was 

 opened in Paris. How special is the city for the group?

 A: Four years after founding the Benetton 

 Group, we opened our first store in Paris, which was and 

 still is the capital of world fashion. It was a decision 

 that brought us luck and today we go back there to celebrate 

 our 40th anniversary. 

 Q: Whats the secret behind Benettons 

 edge in terms of innovation and design?

 A: Curiosity. Being constantly on the 

 lookout for new sources of inspiration and imbuing our products 

 with the outlook and ideas of the young designers 

 over 200 who create our clothes collections. Exploring 

 the communication world through Fabrica, maintaining a continuous 

 dialogue with the over 2,000 partners who work with us in 

 the 120 nations in which we operate. Curiosity and an urge 

 to look to the future are the only ways we can keep the 

 brand young and in tune with customers.

 Q: You were the first global brand to enter the 

 Indian market. How important is India? And do the colours 

 of India inspire your creative team?

 A: India is one of the pillars of Benettons 

 future development. Weve been in the Indian market 

 for over 15 years and today were capitalising on 

 the experience weve acquired, not the least thanks 

 to the passion and professional competence of our retailers. 

 I have always admired the ability to combine the colours 

 of traditional culture with Indian clothing. Yes, of course, 

 this tradition was one of our sources of inspiration for 

 enriching the colour palette that has always distinguished 

 our products. 

 Q: When you visited Calcutta last year, you told 

 us there would be about 20 Benetton stores in eastern India 

 by 2008. You had also forecast a 40 per cent growth for 

 the brand in Calcutta...

 A: I confirm last years forecast. 

 Our business plans are heading precisely in that direction. 

 I think these numbers are satisfactory. They could get even 

 better but for the time being Id prefer to stick 

 to the forecast.

 Q: When will Benettons fashions arrive on 

 the shelves in India at the same time as in Milan or Paris?

 A: Would you be surprised, if I told 

 you that they already do? The styles and models Benetton 

 stocks in India are exactly the same as those in the Paris, 

 Milan or New York stores. Each shop manager makes his or 

 her personal choices, so each store has its own characteristics 

 and personality, but the same can be said for the rest of 

 the world.

 The paintings of Karunamoy Sur are an extension of his religious consciousness. To him art has always been an exercise in imbibing spirituality. His earlier works, dealing with mythological characters, reflected a staid, sober serenity. Later, his figures became diluted and transformed into patterns with geometrical colour-fields, resembling religious symbols. The Inner Voice, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings, presents canvases with a kinetic-geometrical, abstract sensibility, creating an ambience of holiness and sanctity. The lotus, transcended into a symbol of beauty and divinity, has been used as a motif in most of his works, gradually transforming into various forms of luminous geometry. Overlapping shapes of multi-coloured circles, squares and triangles often create a tension that generates a mystical radiance and rhythm. Such rhythm is the essence of Sur?s forms, starting from piety and religiosity and being liberated into a feeling of sublime spirituality.

It would not be right to ban other products at the 

Book Fair. People come here from places as far-off as Bongaon and Burdwan. For 

them, it is a day-long trip. They would be very inconvenienced if the food stalls 

were done away with. To counter the problem of trash accumulation, there should 

be proper means to dispose of the waste. As for the CDs that are on sale on Tagore?s 

works or fairy tales of Bengal, they are also reading material. We have to widen 

our horizon of the media. A medical stall should also be allowed to help tide 

over emergencies. But sale of inflammables like incense sticks should be avoided.

 Leader?s skills for executive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta announced its new one-year postgraduate programme for executives (PGPEX) on Thursday. 

 The residential programme at Joka, scheduled to start from December 2006, has been designed to provide a leadership perspective to executives with at least five years? work experience.

 Sudas Ray, professor, marketing group, said: ?We conducted a demand assessment for such a programme and found that a growing segment of executives do not have the required professional qualifications, or have not had the opportunity to undergo proper training. This course is aimed at them.?

 PGPEX has been positioned as an international programme, as IIM Calcutta expects to attract a significant number of foreign applicants, especially from West Asia, Southeast Asia and the Saarc countries.

 The one-year programme, will also be ?more intense?, compared with a regular management course. 

 ?Input hours are going to be much more. The programme is largely going to be in the participatory mode, with regular analyses, case studies, assignments, exercises and project work,? said Roy.

 Spread over seven terms, PGPEX will have course modules such as managing global logistics, cross-border management and enterprise, team-building and communication effectiveness. 

 Students will also have to undergo a mandatory five-week internship abroad.

 ?The admission process will be similar to the admission process of B-schools in Europe and America,? said Roy.

 Malls were the major draw pre-Durga puja or in the mad rush for Diwali shopping, but Calcuttas traditional shopping destinations have bounced back with a bang before Id. 

 Women circling around the churiwallah (bangle-seller), men sifting through stocks of sherwani and kids trying out kurtas there is no missing the hustle-bustle in New Market or on Rabindra Sarani, around Nakhoda Masjid. 

 And taking a cue from the market-savvy malls, these traditional marketplaces have decided to extend shopping hours. 

 So, the churiwallah will be around till 2 am, the shoe stores will remain open till 1 am and kurtas will be available at Rabindra Sarani shops till sehri for the next three days. 

 Girls and women buy churis and earrings after they are through with shopping for garments. So, we are working in turns to maintain a 16-hour schedule, says Mohammad Afzal, accessory stall owner near Nizams, off New Market. 

 Abbas Ali Iqbal, of Magic Shoe Gallery on Lindsay Street, has increased staff strength and working hours to cope with consumer flow. 

 But it is difficult to manage, he confesses. 

 Iqbal specialises in womens footwear and to cater to his clientele, he has introduced Bollywood varieties on the racks in his 10x10 shop. 

 Long boots have clearly pipped tie-ups and jutis. More than 250 people are walking in every day and the filmi trends are the favourites, adds Iqbal, who has introduced KANK long boots. 

 Similarly, the accessory stores are stashed with Kashish earrings and garment shops have stocked Fanaa skirts and Don shirts. The massive footfall is a welcome change at these small shops. 

 The daily sales volume is crossing the Rs 20,000-mark. This sort of business is only possible during Ramazan, when people start shopping for Id, reveals Salman, explaining the importance of Id for shop-owners. 

 The past few years have seen the mega malls and single brand retail outlets eating up New Markets share in the consumers mind and wallet. With the festive rush changing the trend, no one is complaining about the crowd. 

 Ii is a festival when people buy new clothes, shoes and accessories. And the bulk of the shopping is done in New Market, says Sunil Manglani of Manglani Brothers. 

 While New Market is the top draw for women and children, the men are rushing to Rabindra Sarani for kurtas and sherwanis. 

 Klassic Kurta, famous for its range, is keeping the shop open till sehri. Muslims from the entire city come to our shop to purchase for Id. Though managing the crowd is a problem at times, it is the best time for us, says owner Md Irfan.

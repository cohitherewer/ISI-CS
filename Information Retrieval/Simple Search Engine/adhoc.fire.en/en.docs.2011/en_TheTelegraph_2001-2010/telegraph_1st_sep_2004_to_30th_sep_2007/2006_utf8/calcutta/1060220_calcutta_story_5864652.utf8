 What: Launch of Leela, a brand of handicrafts and garments from Mrittika Foundation.

 Where: Rotary Sadan.

 When: Friday night.

 E-quotient: A performance by Class Apart, the musical group represented by Santanu Bandopadhyay of Bishnupur gharana and Neel Adhikary (western vocals), set the tone for a cool evening on the lawns.

 Two sequences showcasing handwoven saris and garments designed by Sunipa Samadder using textiles by Mrittika Foundation added to the glam factor.

 City models Sheena, Priyanka Pal, Ananya and Anusmriti walked the makeshift ramp. 

 Dulal Mukherjees passion and commitment towards Bengal craftsmen and artisans led me to design this classy collection, smiled Sunipa.

 The fabrics used were dupion, raw silk and linen silk. The first sequence was about skirts of all kinds and one saw a splash of everything from trumpet, asymmetrical, straight, sarongs to detachable hemmed and layered skirts teamed with interesting tops.

 The second collection showed lovely saris, draped innovatively and teamed with tops and kurtis. The idea is to present a very global collection that sends out a message that Bengals thoughts, colour palette and textile arts are not for Bengal alone, added the designer. 

 Also spotted: German consul-general in Calcutta Gunter Wehrmann, actor Soumitra Chatterjee, actress Roopa Ganguly, danseuse Mamata Shankar and Priti Patel, adman Ram Ray and real-estate biggies Harsh Neotia, Sumit Dabriwal and Nandu Belani.

 Voiceover: This entire effort is born out of sheer passion, smiled Dulal Mukherjee, veteran architect, the force behind Mrittika Foundation.

 Key witness backs out in Gunjan trial

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 

 A key witness in the trial of Gunjan Ghosh, arrested on charges of abducting Roma Jhawar and murdering aide Biswajit Dey, has refused to testify, alleging intimidation by associates of the accused. 

 A councillor of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality is among those who are allegedly threatening Rajiv Sarkar.

 Roma was abducted at gunpoint about 50 m from her residence in Salt Lakes CA block, while on her way to college in a car in February last year. Dey was murdered later over a monetary dispute. 

 Sarkar wrote to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) last week, expressing his unwillingness to testify in court. 

 He wrote to us that Gunjan and his aides were threatening him and his family. He mentioned that some political leaders were also involved, said a CID officer. 

 The magistrate of the Sealdah fast track court, which is handling the case, was informed of the development. A court official said he has asked Sarkar to meet him and discuss the matter.

 When contacted, Sarkar confirmed that he was not willing to testify in court, but refused to elaborate on the reasons. I have some problems, but I dont want to discuss them, he said.

 The CID officer added: The weapon with which Gunjan killed Biswajit was found in a ditch near Joramandir, off VIP Road. Amitava Saha, arrested along with Gunjan, accompanied us to the spot on March 9 this year. Sarkar and another local youth, Soumitra Gupta, were witness to the recovery of the revolver.

 Amitava, who is close to the local councillor, is out on bail now. Both are reportedly threatening Sarkar and his family.

 While Gupta has refused to testify in court, Sarkar appeared before the court on April 20 this year. 

 Soon after, he started receiving threats over the phone, he stated in the letter. Sarkar further alleged that the local toughs were threatening him on his way back from office and were pressuring him to back out from testifying.

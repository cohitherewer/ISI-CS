 Greening of the campus

 - Presidency College draws up pre-autonomy doll-up plan

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A clean, green campus awaits Presidency College ahead of its autonomy. For the first time in its history, the 189-year-old institution has decided to prepare a plan to spruce up its sprawling College Street campus. 

 ?Presidency College is known internationally for imparting quality education. It is time now to take some measures to clean up the campus and make it look attractive. We have started chalking out a beautification project,? said principal Mamata Roy.

 A move is being initiated to seek funds from the government for the beautification drive. The request is likely to be made after the Assembly elections.

 There is a general feeling that the cleanliness and aesthetics of the campus do not match Presidency?s academic excellence, which has prompted the authorities to take up the beautification drive, said an official of the state education department.

 The thrust of the scheme will be on making the campus greener, the principal added. Small gardens will be laid, seasonal flowering plants will be planted wherever possible and the corridors and open spaces decorated with flowerpots. 

 The college also has plans to restore its playground, upgrade the students? canteen and common rooms, and improve the existing illumination facilities.

 The responsibility of overseeing the greening has been entrusted with a botany teacher, said a college source. A teacher of geology will supervise the rest of the work.

 Pockets on the campus, such as the space in front of the students? union room and the canteen and near the Baker Laboratory, were being used to dump garbage. ?We are trying to remove the litter and keep the spots clean,? Roy stated.

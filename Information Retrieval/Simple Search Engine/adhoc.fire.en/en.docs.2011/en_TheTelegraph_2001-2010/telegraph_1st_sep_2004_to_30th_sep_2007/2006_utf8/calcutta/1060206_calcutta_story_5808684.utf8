The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Boarding a Metro train is always a nightmare during the Book Fair. On Friday, I opted not to board an overcrowded Tollygunge-bound train from MG Road around 3.10 pm. When I got into the next train at 3.26 pm, a man pushed me out just before the doors shut. Finally, I managed to board the train at 3.41 pm, but had to literally stand on one foot with my face pressed against the door. It is appreciated that Metro Railway runs extra trains on such occasions, but it should also have a system of restricting the number of passengers on each train. Perhaps, an average upper limit can be arrived at to determine the maximum number of people who can be issued tickets from all the stations taken together within a given span of time.

 Tanmoy Das,

 Salt Lake. 

 The main water pipeline on Parnasree Main Road has been leaking for the past two weeks. The water has widened the potholes on the road and has made the entire stretch very slippery. Some pedestrians have also fallen and injured themselves. The civic body should immediately repair the leak and the road.

 Tuhin Purkayastha, 

 Parnasree Pally. 

 Many guardians are parking their vehicles on the footpath in front of Assembly of God Church School on Royd Street. I request the school authorities to instruct the guardians to park their vehicles elsewhere. 

 Md Sohail,

 Mcleod Street.

 Forced landing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 An aircraft carrying 105 passengers from Delhi to Singapore made an unscheduled landing at Calcutta airport early on Sunday after the pilot suspected a technical snag.

 The Indian (airline) flight IC 859, an Airbus 320 aircraft, took off from Delhi airport for Singapore at 1.15 am. After flying for about two hours, the pilot suspected some problem with the generator, said a spokesperson for Indian.

 ?About half an hour before the landing the pilot told air traffic control that there was probably a technical snag and that he wanted priority landing,? an airport officer said.

 The flight landed safely at Calcutta at 3.25 am and thereafter, the passengers disembarked.

 ?The check-up revealed that there was no major problem with the aircraft,? the airline spokesperson said. 

 After the ?precautionary landing?, another Indian aircraft left for Singapore with the passengers at 7.05 am.

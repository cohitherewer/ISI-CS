 What: Valentines 

 Day date for winners of The Telegraph Write From 

 The Heart Contest in association with Hey Ya!

 Where: Fame Hiland Park.

 When: February 14.

 Show of love: The afternoon began on a grand note. The winning couple ? Parminder and Poonam Singh ? was escorted from the Convent Road residence to Fame Hiland Park for the 2.40 pm show of the Jim Carrey-starrer Fun With Dick And Jane.

 The entrance to Screen No. 1, booked exclusively for the duo, was done up prettily with mauve balloons. As the movie rolled in the hall for two, an attendant served Parminder and Poonam refreshments throughout the show.

 A happy couple emerged from the hall with Parminder planning to take his wife out for some shopping (cosmetics, of course) and then a dinner with friends.

 The two, now married for 13 years, were all dressed up in the hues of love ? Parminder in a red checked shirt and Poonam in a flashy red sari. Parminder had his handycam ready, capturing the special moments for their two kids back home.

 We have known each other for a long time now, but the romance is still there. We love each others company and inspire each other to keep the love factor going strong, said the duo who tied the knot after five years of courtship.

 Ever since we have known each other, The Telegraph has been there with me. I would often send my husband messages through the paper, blushed Poonam.

 Winning lines: Poonam, the more romantic of the two, had responded to The Telegraph Write From The Heart Contest with the message: My handsome hubby ? if Valentines Day didnt come once a year, then u wud get a msg from your biwi everyday.

 The SMS count for the contest that came to a close at 12 noon on February 11 was 800-plus. Out of the 10 best messages, Poonams was chosen through a lucky dip. The 10 messages have been put up on billboards at key intersections in the city. The winning message is up at Dalhousie.

 Voiceover: The experience was grand. I felt like Amitabh Bachchan in Sharaabi, booking the whole hall for himself. And with my wife by my side, it felt all the more worthwhile, said Parminder.

 Mobile mush

 What: Interactive session with the winners of Be My Valentine contest by Airtel.

 Where: Gossip, the lounge restaurant in Udita at the Bengal Ambuja Housing Complex.

 When: February 13.

 The session: Winners of Be My Valentine Contest launched by Airtel were given the opportunity to meet actress June and singer Siddhartha of Cactus. Twenty lucky winners selected through a mobile contest also got to choose their dates for Valentines Day.

 The final winner of the contest was Arijit Lahiri, an engineering student from south Calcutta. The session was rounded off by June and Siddhartha sharing their V-Day experiences.

 On offer: The event was further marked by the launch of special Valentines Day prepaid and post-paid connections by Airtel, which offer loads of free talk time, SMS and MMS benefits for the next one year to new customers. A host of other offers were also unveiled.

 Voiceover: The mobile is an integral part of the lives of the youth today and so is Valentines Day. So, we decided to launch our new products targeting this special segment on this special day, said N.V. Subba Rao, chief operating officer, Mobility, Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd.

 Early birds

 What: Valentines Day bash.

 Where: Forum on Elgin Road and Prince of Cal at Souravs.

 The bash: The footfalls at the mall exceeded 6,000 by Tuesday early evening. The crowd mainly comprised young couples. Some headed for tattoo work on their arms while others went to the tarot card reader to know what lay ahead on V-Day. The couples then headed for the jam session on the fourth floor where Power FM had a DJ playing the latest hits.

 At Prince of Cal (Souravs) teenagers trooped in from 2 pm. They danced and partied the afternoon away, but fought shy of the cameras. Papa ko pata chal jayega, was the common refrain.

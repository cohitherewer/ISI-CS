 Of friendship and fraud

 Yasmina Reza, French-Iranian by birth, actress by training in Paris, and dramatist by repute ever since her first play in French won the prestigious Moliere Award in 1987, has become a name to reckon with in less than 20 years with four successive critically-lauded international stage hits. 

 Only the third among them, Art (1994), has made it to Calcutta. When it first arrived eight years ago in the Mumbai production starring Rahul Bose and Zafar Karachiwala, I complained about the simplistic symbolism of costuming Bose (the cynic) in black against Karachiwala (the connoisseur) in white, and the former?s underacting along with the latter?s caricaturing.

 This time, the Scene Stealers? version from New Delhi (presented by Spandan and Sanskriti Sagar) evoked different responses. 

 The acting was superior: Sunit Tandon quite the cool, sophisticated art lover fascinated by the apparently aesthetic heights of an obviously unpainted plain white canvas for which he has paid a handsome amount, Suhel Seth his ruthlessly frank but philistine friend who calls this white spade a white spade (reminiscent of the emperor?s new clothes), and Vivek Mansukhani the ordinary guy caught in their crossfire and negotiating between these two opinionated opposites.

 Art is as much about friendship as about fraudulent art or the individual interpretation of art, and how far friends should go to accommodate friendships or fall out over dogmatic standpoints.

 Mansukhani directs this theme well, himself proving a bravura monologist in the middle, so with former Calcuttans like him and Seth it seemed a homecoming to make us proud, even like a home team. 

 Yet, as most Calcutta theatregoers remember the play so clearly, they would have appreciated a newer reading. For example, dropping the very British translation and reverting to the original critique of les bobos ? what the French call their bohemian bourgeois ? of which India has far too many now, crying for satirical treatment. Thus Mansukhani could have Indianised the script, working on the social artificiality in bobo India today.

 Meanwhile, the English theatre festival Constellation 2006 by Night and Fog brought five young local groups doing their new works on the Gyan Manch platform, most of which we have covered in this column. 

 The organiser?s own contribution, Fire Walk with Me, was unfortunately quite poor. Only Debanjan Basak caught the eye as a tripped-out lights operator because he put on a performance; the others did not.

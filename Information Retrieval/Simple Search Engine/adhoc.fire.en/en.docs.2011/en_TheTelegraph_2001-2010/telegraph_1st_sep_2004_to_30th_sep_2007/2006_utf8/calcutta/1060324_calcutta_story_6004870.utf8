The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Don?t 

 shy away from praise, especially if you deserve it. Don?t 

 expect much from others and you won?t be disappointed. You?re 

 a great person to work with in a team. Learn to say no; 

 don?t compromise on values. It?s best to forget everything 

 unpleasant and move on with a cheerful outlook. Although 

 your generosity is commendable, it?s not a bad idea to ask 

 for your share at times. ? Kusum Bhandari

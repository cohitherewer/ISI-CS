The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 You share your birthday with...

 Celine Dion and Norah 

 Jones You?re a private person; you don?t flaunt 

 your feelings. You have imaginative ideas, strong ideals 

 and a sparkling sense of humour. Don?t be intimidated by 

 others. Being a good team member doesn?t mean you lose your 

 individuality. Try and avoid negative people, even if they 

 are family or friends. ? Kusum Bhandari

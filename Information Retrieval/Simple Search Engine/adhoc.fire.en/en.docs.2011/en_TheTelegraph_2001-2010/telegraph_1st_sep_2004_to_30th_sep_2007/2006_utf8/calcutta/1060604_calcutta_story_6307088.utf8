 Writing off 

 the wall

 Why we have exhausted the bank of 

 possible marketing reasons for re-allowing graffiti

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 The 

 next election is going to be a lot more fun. The festivities 

 are bound to be back. The chief minister has promised us 

 as much. Some law will be repealed or redrafted, so that 

 we can have all the fun and the political parties can have 

 their democratic right to deface the city walls. Lest you 

 feel that all this is sarcasm let me hasten to add that 

 many indeed felt disturbed by the calm and quiet of the 

 last Election Day. There was less of festival; the onset 

 of the election was unheralded.

 That however is hardly the point. 

 The chief minister?s initiative to restore wall graffiti 

 possibly has less to do with the emotions of the citizens. 

 There must be a political reason for it. Indeed, a pertinent 

 question will be is there a marketing benefit to be had 

 by freeing the wall space? At the height of electioneering, 

 when all political parties are trying to change the mindset 

 of the voters, walls become useful as it is an unpaid medium 

 of communication that is available in plenty. The abundance 

 gives the parties the luxury of not giving much conscious 

 thought to the use of the space. Rarely does one see constituency-specific 

 messages or visuals.

 Outdoor as a medium is not given 

 a lot of time by you and me. We hardly ever stop to read 

 what is written. Brevity is thus a virtue in outdoor communication. 

 As a result, they are used more to remind what has been 

 said already in ads appearing in newspapers or on television. 

 So it is not surprising that election graffiti is brief. 

 The party symbol, name of the candidate and the name of 

 the constituency occupy bulk of the space. The curious thing 

 is that the aim is to inform rather than persuade.

 It is difficult to fathom why 

 political parties miss such a medium so much. In any case, 

 using wall writing for persuasion is at the best of times 

 a difficult mission to accomplish. It requires special designing 

 efforts. In the world of consumer goods and services there 

 are some notable but rare examples like Amul, Air India 

 and Jenson amp; Nicholson. The distance that our political 

 advertising needs to travel to reach that height is considerable. 

 As of now, persuasion is hardly likely to be the pot of 

 gold that political parties are after.

 Why then the repeal? Some feel 

 that the atmosphere leading up to the election and the crescendo 

 reached on Election Day through banners and posters is necessary 

 to encourage people to vote. Otherwise a day of election 

 could degenerate into a day of bandh.

 The last Election Day has negated 

 this theory. The voter turnout did not drop. That just about 

 does it. We surely have exhausted the bank of possible marketing 

 reasons for re-allowing wall graffiti. On the contrary there 

 is a strong marketing logic for doing the opposite. Attitudes 

 and beliefs govern behaviour. The votes that were cast in 

 this year?s election were predicated by the state of mind 

 of the voters on Election Day. If there is one thing that 

 is certain to top chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s 

 wish list, it will be that this state of voter mind remains 

 unchanged till the next Election Day. By reopening the graffiti 

 door he will be allowing the Opposition an opportunity to 

 challenge the status quo.

 Maybe he is content because of 

 the marketing ineptness of his political opponents. Maybe 

 he wants to keep his own options open for course corrections. 

 After all one can never be sure about what one?s communication 

 needs will be five years down the road. Or may be there 

 is streak in him which reminds people of the folklore of 

 Kalidas.

 It is unlikely, but possible.

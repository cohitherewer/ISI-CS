 Metal hunt, midnight hour

CALCUTTANS REFUSED TO LET DHANTERAS SLIP 

BY WITHOUT ITS FAIR SHARE OF FUN AND FESTIVITY. ANUMITA GHOSH AND KARO 

CHRISTINE KUMAR JOINED THE GOLD RUSH THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT

Anjali jewellers, Sovabazar, 8 pm

Anjali Jewellers, Sovabazar

Time : 8 pm

 Crowd profile 

: More than 350 shoppers, mostly Bengalis children, teenagers, homemakers, 

office-goers and more. Many like Rajesh Biswas (at his wifes instance) 

were first-time Dhanteras buyers. Ninety per cent of the crowd is Bengali. 

Dhanteras, like Valentines Day, is everyones festival now, smiled 

a spokesperson for the store.

 Ambience 

: The Puja spirit was unmissable A long queue extended way beyond the 

large iron gates. Shoppers (in their pre-Diwali best) waited patiently for their 

turn some reading newspapers, some busy chatting, others peeping into the 

store with eager anticipation. Once inside the sprawling premises, it was a mela-like 

mood with people digging into free phuchka, vegetable chop, ice-cream, tea and 

paan, and women even queuing up at a mehndi stall.

Inside the shop it was no different. The gold section, Johuree Bazaar (lightweight 

jewellery) and diamond section were flooded with buyers. While toddlers dozed 

off in arms and husbands reclined on sofas, women and a few enthusiastic men crowded 

the counters. Pandal-like announcements kept the cash counter in line. Security 

was tight with bouncers and policemen a shout away.

 Best buys 

: From coins priced at Rs 120 to wedding sets touching a few lakh.

 Crowdspeak 

: I stood in queue for half an hour and then spent an hour at the counter. 

The whole ambience is the attraction, smiled homemaker Jayati Das. 

Ruby Das had come all the way from Durganagar to be a part of the festivity. I 

would have been out in the morning, but the rain played spoilsport, she 

rued. 

We were planning this outing from Monday but postponed it for the showers. 

This evening we were determined, smiled 20-year-old Madhumita Roy.

 Voiceover 

: The belief that metal purchase in these hours brings luck has sunk 

into the Calcuttans system. Last year we shut our stores around 3 am, this 

year the scenario looks no different, said proprietor Anargha Chowdhury.

Forum

 Forum, 9 pm 

Time: 9 pm 

 Ambience: 

A Diwali Mela was on in the open space in front of the mall. Jugglers, tattoo 

artists, face painters and magicians pushed up the entertainment quotient. Also 

on were exciting games like Eye The Tiger, Stick The Bindi and Bold The Joker. 

 Voiceover: 

Diwali is the perfect occasion to strengthen our bonds with customers. To 

add to the celebrations we are open till midnight, offering exciting schemes on 

jewellery and other items, said Naveen Misra, customer care associate and 

unit head, Shoppers Stop, at the Elgin Road mall.

Bowbazar

Bowbazar, 10.30 pm

Time: 10.30 pm

 Crowd profile: 

A mix of Bengalis and non-Bengalis, mostly Dhanteras regulars. Places like Senco 

Jewellery House recorded 100 per cent more footfall than last year 

throughout the day, claimed a shop official. Even at closing time, more than 40 

buyers were at their bargaining best.

At shops like Benud Behari Dutt, post 10.30 pm the shutters were on their way 

down. I have been coming here for the past 25 years all the way from Dum 

Dum, said Gopal Singh, busy surveying rings. As B.K. Dutt, proprietor, Benud 

Behari Dutt, put it, 95 per cent have been purchasers not window shoppers.

 Ambience: 

While some had their shutters down, others like Shaw Jewellers and Senco Jewellery 

House still had their hands full. Music from a para programme pepped up the otherwise 

quiet night.

Chowmein, muri and cha were all there to cash in on the Dhanteras frenzy. I 

usually close shop at 9 pm, but today I will keep my stall open till around 11 

pm, smiled tea vendor Subhash Chakraborty.

 Best buys: 

All that glittered was definitely gold. From chains to balas to more elaborate 

sets, everything was moving fast. Not far behind was silver. At Shaw Jewellers, 

customers picked up silver coins, utensils, payals and idols. 

 Crowdspeak: 

Every year I come back with my family here for Dhanteras. After all, there 

is a shagun to buy something auspicious this day, said Kajal Hariramani 

from Mullickbazar.

 Voiceover: 

Compared to last year we recorded 25 per cent more sales. Our customer turnover 

has been tremendous, said Ashok Kumar Sen, proprietor, Senco Jewellery House. 

Fort Knox

Tanishq, Fort Knox, 11.30 pm

Time: 11.30 pm

 Crowd profile: 

For a change, the feet were not headed for the dance floor at Venom on the eighth 

floor, but for the jewellery stores in the Camac Street mall. Souparna Chaudhuri, 

store manager, Tanishq, said: The non-Bengali to Bengali ratio at our store 

has been 60:40. At Tanishq, the footfall shot up from around 50 to 

500 in the 4 pm-to-10 pm span, claimed a shop official. The sales figure 

too was 75 per cent more than normal days.

 Ambience: 

Phuchkawala Ramashankar Gupta was there to serve it up even past 11.30 pm, unlike 

normal days when pack up is complete by 9.30 pm. While parents were buying 

metal, children were busy buying balloons. On the first floor, Adora, Zenith and 

B. Motiram were doing brisk business too. Stores like Sakshis (that raised 

shutters only on Thursday) were happy with the amazing response.

 Best buys: 

Gold, diamonds, jadau it was a mixed bag. 

 Crowdspeak: 

I chose this hour specifically as I thought the crowd rush would be less, 

smiled Anjana Malhotra. 

 Voiceover: 

Compared to last year, we had 70-80 per cent rise in sales, said Souparna.

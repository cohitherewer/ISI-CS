The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 It's Your Birthday So...

 Few 

 people are as open and direct as you. In relationships, 

 you have the good sense to know when to move on. You are 

 warm and good-intentioned; but make financial security your 

 top priority. You treasure the lessons of experience, yet 

 maintain a progressive and realistic outlook. You are known 

 for your excellent and result-oriented style of working.

 Driver link in murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sanjit Naha

 A Mahestala businessman, missing since Saturday, was found dead in East Midnapore on Sunday night, his face smashed beyond recognition.

 A team from Nandakumar police station, near Digha, stumbled upon the body of Sanjit Naha, 36, and found a driving licence in his pocket.

 The body was identified by Sanjits wife and brothers, who were shown a photograph of it on Sunday night by a team from Nandakumar thana.

 In the photograph, Sanjit was seen wearing only trousers. His face seemed to have been smashed with a heavy object, said Sanjits neighbour Sandip Mukherjee.

 Two persons have been detained for interrogation and the sleuths are looking for another two, including a driver of the small entrepreneur.

 Sanjit, a resident of Mukherjee Gate, lived with his wife and two children. He ran a fast-food centre and also a car rental service.

 Sanjit, neighbour Mukherjee said, recently had an altercation with Bapi Chatterjee, who used to drive his mini-truck. On Friday, he left for Dankuni with the truck loaded with goods, as Bapi refused to undertake the trip, recalled Mukherjee.

 Sanjit told wife Sandhya that he would be back the same day. But in the evening, he called her to say that he was going to Kharagpur and would return on Saturday evening.

 When there was no word from him till Saturday night, the family approached police.

 The truck was found at the residence of Bapis uncle. We have detained the drivers father and uncle. We are looking for Bapi and one of his friends, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

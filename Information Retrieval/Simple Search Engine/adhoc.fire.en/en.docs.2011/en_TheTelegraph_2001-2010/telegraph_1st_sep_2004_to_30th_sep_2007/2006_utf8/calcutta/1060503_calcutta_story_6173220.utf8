 Rights panel probe prod

 - Hounded Dum Dum family still wary of returning home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The state human rights commission on Tuesday ordered a probe, suo motu, into the assault on the Sinhas near Dum Dum by the local CPM councillor and his aides. But the family that fled Kalidham in fear is wary of returning home.

 Saraswati Sinha, daughter Runu and son Somnath were forced to abandon their home on Friday after it was ransacked by party activists demanding a portion of their premises for a club.

 The three, who sought the help of CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar at Alimuddin Street on Monday, have taken shelter at the house of Saraswati Sinha?s sister near the airport.

 ?How can I dare return home with my children?? asked Saraswati. ?I have heard that the local councillor and his aides are still at large in the area.?

 The Sinhas have been hounded by councillor Swapan Saha and his supporters for the construction of a club on a portion of land that clearly belongs to the family.

 Dum Dum?s CPM zonal committee secretary Swapan Gupta, assigned by Alimuddin Street to look into the matter, assured the Sinhas of a safe passage back home.

 ?Let Saraswati Sinha and her children come back and reconstruct their home. Our men will not meddle in their matters,? he announced on Tuesday.

 Runu, yet to recover from the head injuries she had sustained during Friday?s attack, said they would submit a report to the rights panel on Wednesday.

 ?I have asked deputy inspector-general of police (Presidency range) Surajit Kar Purakayastha to probe the assault on the Sinha family and submit a report to the panel within two weeks,? human rights commission chairman Shyamal Sen said on Tuesday.

 According to Sen, the move by the commission comes in the wake of reports in Metro on ?CPM?s terror tactics on a woman and her two children?.

 ?I am saddened to learn that CPM activists, led by local party councillor Swapan Saha, unleashed terror on the family. They vandalised Saraswati Sinha?s house and even beat up her son and daughter to grab a piece of land for the construction of a club. This is inhuman,? Sen observed.

 The rights panel chairman has also sought within two weeks a report from the superintendent of NRS Medical College on the nature of Runu?s injuries. 

 ?Her picture published in the papers with blood oozing from the wounds was really shocking,? said Sen.

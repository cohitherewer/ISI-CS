 What: 

 Midnite Fusion ? Ladies Night Out, presented by Kriya 

 in association with Saturday Club.

 Where: Phoenix Hall and Antiquity Bar at the club. 

 When: Saturday, 11 pm onwards.

 Take a look: The first ladies night organised by the club had women in the age group of 26 to 40 enjoying themselves thoroughly. To add fun to the event, there was a fashion show by designer Tejas Gandhi. The show was divided into five sequences. 

 The casualwear shirt round had models sashaying white shirts with denims and skirts, teamed with funky belts and boots. The second sequence was a medley of colourful skirts, bikini tops, halter necks, teamed with trendy shades. 

 For the loungewear round, black and white was the colour code. The eveningwear round was a colourful one ? the women flaunted ponchos and hot pants, while the men were seen in silk and linen kurtis.

 The final round was in keeping with the current soccer fever. Models showed off Germany, England, Brazil and Argentina jerseys. In between, dance troupe Zodiac kept the party mood going.

 The evening culminated with the crowd flocking in front of a screen to catch the Brazil-France match. Some continued dancing to tracks belted out by DJ Firoz.

 Voiceover: Ladies night out is an in concept. This was an effort to make the women feel special. The response has been good and talks are on for a night out like this once every month, said Soumitra Sen, bar convenor, Saturday Club.

 Fears allayed in flu cry

 OUR BUREAU

 Read my lips: please eat chicken and eggs without fear. 

 Animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman sent out this message from the floor of the state Assembly on Tuesday.

 ?There are no reports of bird flu in Bengal. We want to tell the people not to panic and to eat chicken and eggs. The government is alert about the day-to-day developments,? assured Rahman.

 The minister was replying to a call attention motion placed by six MLAs on Monday.

 Apart from maintaining vigil at poultry farms, Rahman said 2,000 samples of migratory birds had been sent to Bhopal for testing. ?All have tested negative for avian flu,? he declared.

 After a meeting with the leading poultry players at Writers? Buildings, the minister said: ?Producers have been asked to take precautions and to keep us posted about the death of birds or any possible outbreak.?

 The minister pinned the death blame of 30 birds at a poultry farm in Hooghly on Ranikhet disease. ?Even then, we?ve collected samples from the birds and sent them to Bhopal,? he said.

 Playing down the incident at Arambagh Hatcheries, in Hooghly, on Tuesday, where sub-divisional officer Uttam Patra was reportedly denied entry by hatchery officials, minister Rahman said: ?Nobody can walk into a hatchery without prior permission.?

 Staring at a loss of around Rs 8.97 crore in the past three days, the leading players in the poultry industry on Tuesday sought government support to regain consumer confidence.

 ?The sale of chickens has dropped by nearly 50 per cent across the city and so, a joint effort of the industry and the government is needed to salvage the situation,? said P.K. Roy, managing director of Arambagh Hatcheries.

 A meeting will soon be held with Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) employees and dos and don?ts on handling poultry circulated in the CMC markets.

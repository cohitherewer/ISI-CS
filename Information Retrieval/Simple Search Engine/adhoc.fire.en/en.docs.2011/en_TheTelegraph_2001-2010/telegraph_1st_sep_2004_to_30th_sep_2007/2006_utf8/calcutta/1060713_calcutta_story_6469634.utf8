 The new-look Calcutta airport will also have some new services soon, to bring it on a par in look and efficiency with other international airports. 

 An Asia Pacific-based travel agency will set up a 24-hour help desk at the airport by the end of July, to assist travellers with their last-minute requirements.

 Specialising in corporate and business travel, FCm Travel Solutions already has the service in place in major airports around the country, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai. 

 By July-end, the 24x7 airport transfer service will be available at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport as well.

 The desk will provide airport assistance to passengers with last-minute needs. The FCm ground staff will manage the requests of the client. 

 ?The service has been very popular in the other cities, with 80 per cent of FCm clients using it. Whatever the need, we will help, be it a visa glitch or baggage concerns,? says Rahul Nath, CEO, FCm Travel Solutions.

 Although the focus is on the company?s core clientele of corporate and business travellers, the ?meet-and-greet? offer will be available to all passengers at the airport. 

 FCm?s services include account management, advanced management reporting and analysis, independent travel advice, travel information, frequent flyer management, a global hotel program and total travel fulfilment (visas, passports, insurance, airport transfers, etc).

 FCm India established its Calcutta office in 2005 on Chowringhee Road. After 18 months, the office is now fully equipped to cater to large corporate customers and group movements. 

 ?Calcutta is emerging as an IT hub, and it looks like it will soon become a centre of attraction for the auto industry as well. We established the office to deliver international services to corporate customers, with several first-of-its kind services previously unheard of in the Calcutta market,? adds Nath.

 Anthony Grigson, global executive general manager for FCm Travel Solutions, says: 

 ?Since launching in China in August 2004, we?ve expanded our business regionally in Asia by around 400 per cent. In India, we?re planning to expand our network from 16 to 25 offices within the next six months.?

 Although none of these additional offices will be set up in this city, Calcuttans can look forward to some cricket World Cup action. FCm has been licensed by the International Cricket Council as one of the official travel agencies for the World Cup in the West Indies next year. 

 ?We are just finalising the details, and will be coming up with package deals, including match tickets, in a couple of weeks,? adds Nath.

 Two distinct types of themes mark the paintings of promising young artist, Arya Chandra Choudhury. The first is women, who are are engrossed in an idyllic world of romance and imagination. Whether in solitude or in the company of other women, their lives appear to be free from male encroachment. The second type of paintings depicts hefty masculinity in a manner reminiscent of Rennaisance art, the muscular bodies of men complementing the delicate, ethereal quality of his paintings of women. Frames of Memories, the ongoing exhibition of Choudhury?s works, is inspired by his memories of popular images of reference like famous personalities, pictures or film-frames. The careless attire and casual, leisurely postures of his women has given them an air of sensuality. The artist has captured the mass and volume of the female body, highlighting their features and skin tones in minute detailing. Often, his poetic exuberance, coupled with an amazing realism lends a visionary quality to his paintings.

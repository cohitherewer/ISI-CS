 Gang behind murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 The assassins of Krishnapada Mondal first gagged him with a strip of adhesive tape, then covered his head with a piece of white cloth and finally put a noose made out of a muffler around his neck. 

 As the 41-year-old from Bongaon struggled for air, the noose tightened, causing asphyxia, according to the post-mortem report. 

 The body was found in the anteroom of a 80-sq-ft shop on Manohar Das Street, off Mahatma Gandhi Road, on Wednesday morning. 

 A gang committed the murder to take away Rs 25,000 from the shop, said police on Thursday. 

 It appears that at least three youths had stepped into the Sonapatti shop and strangled Mondal to death after overpowering him, said a senior officer of Burrabazar police station.

 Police have learnt that a few days back, the owner of the shop, Ajit Biswas of Balagarh, Hooghly, had given Mondal Rs 27,000 to keep. 

 On Tuesday, he asked Mondal, who used to look after the illegal transaction of coins in the shop independently, to hand over Rs 2,000 to his son-in-law Sanjay Biswas to buy train tickets. Biswas was scheduled to leave for Bangalore with his niece for her treatment on Thursday. The assassins walked away with the remaining Rs 25,000.

 We are trying to put the pieces together by collating the information. The assassins might not have known that the money had been kept in the shop. We have found that most of the shops dealing with illegal coins keep around that amount on the premises, stated a detective department officer.

 During the investigation, the police have found that Mondal used to run another business for his employer. He traded soiled notes for new ones. Police seized soiled notes worth Rs 2.9 lakh in the shop on Wednesday evening.

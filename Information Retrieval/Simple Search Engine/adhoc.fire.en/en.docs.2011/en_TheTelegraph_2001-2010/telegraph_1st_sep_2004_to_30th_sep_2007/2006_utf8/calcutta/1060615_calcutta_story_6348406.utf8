 It?s vulture culture

 - Count 

 DIPS 95 per cent 

 SEBANTI SARKAR

 India, Nepal, and Pakistan have lost over 95 per cent of their vulture population, said wildlife conservationists at a meeting on Monday at Aranya Bhavan. 

 It was a rare session, in which J.B.R. Alfred, director, Zoological Survey of India, and representatives of animal husbandry, forest department and various NGOs came together. Among the many topics discussed was the publication of an easily-accessible handbook on the birds of Bengal. 

 But the bird that took centre stage was the vulture. One of the reasons was of course the presence of Asad Rehmani, director, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), who has played a major role in the ongoing vulture protection and breeding programme. There was general exultation over the government ban on the manufacture and marketing of the drug Diclofenac.

 Introduced to the Indian veterinary market just a decade ago, Diclofenac has been responsible for rapidly pushing the Gyps species of vultures towards extinction. Studies conducted by the Peregrine Funds (USA) and other organisations in India like the BNHS have proved just how this non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug, used as a painkiller for livestock, is finishing off vultures. 

 ?When vultures feed on the carcasses of cattle, they suffer from dehydration, visceral gout, kidney failure and die,? explained V.K. Yadav, of the forest department.

 In 2000, the World Conservation Union had listed the three Gyps species vultures as being critically endangered, the highest category of endangerment. 

 In 2002, the three species were categorised under ?Schedule I? of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act. 

 But concrete steps have been taken only recently. Conservationists began (for the first time ever) monitoring vultures. In West Bengal, Prakriti Samsad, Nature Environment Wildlife Society, the WWF, Aranyak, Himalayan Nature Wildlife Foundation (of Siliguri) and various other NGOs of Alipurduar and Cooch Behar underwent special training in Bishnupur, Sukna, Calcutta and North Bengal.

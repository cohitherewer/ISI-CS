The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Oh captain!

 Screen On amp; Off

 Rahul Bose is the new cricket 

 captain of Team India. No the other Rahul Dravid has 

 not got the boot (yet) but the Indian rugby captain will 

 play the cricket skipper in a new childrens film starting 

 next year.

 I have always wanted to do a 

 childrens film, says Rahul, ecstatic about Sourav Ganguly 

 making it back to the national team. Its warm, funny, 

 sad, sentimental... something even the adults would love 

 to see. The film will be in Hindi to be directed by Ken 

 Ghoshs assistant Tamara Nedungadi.

 On a different pitch, Rahul is 

 disappointed that he could not do Buddhadeb Dasguptas Two 

 Boys and a Girl. The dates were clashing and there 

 was very little I could do, he explains. I can give my 

 right arm to work with Buddhada and Aparna (Sen).

 Aniruddha Roy Chowdhurys Anuranon 

 makes him smile, though. It is a really accomplished 

 first film... It questions whether a man and a woman can 

 lead a purely platonic relationship. The answers thrown 

 up are full of reverberations and resonance. Its also beautifully 

 shot by Sunil Patel, making it look three times more expensive.

 Rahul is also looking forward 

 to the release of Rajeev Viranis The Whisperers 

 and Santosh Sivans Road to the Sky. Whisperers 

 is based on my screenplay and is a psychological thriller 

 involving two men, played by Manoj (Bajpai) and me, Rahul 

 reveals. Santoshs film is, of course, an international 

 project and may get a premiere at Cannes.

 Besides Rahul, Road to the 

 Sky features Nandita Das and the two spent a lot of 

 time shooting for the film and their comfort levels led 

 many to believe that the two single souls were seeing each 

 other. I can understand from where it came from because 

 there is a commonality between us as social activists, 

 says Rahul. Nandita and I have had a wonderful friendship 

 for six-seven years now. In fact, we had a good laugh about 

 this in Goa. Usually theres smoke because of fire. Here 

 the fire put out the smoke.

 Rahuls second directorial project 

 (after 2001s Everybody Says Im Fine) is still pending. 

 It will happen late next year, he declares. Ive finished 

 the first draft of the script and also got international 

 finance. But I am not happy. I want to write a second draft 

 and do a recasting. 

 Six years without steering a film 

 isnt he losing precious time? My looks and youth will 

 disappear in three months flat, laughs Rahul. Let me be 

 an actor till then.

 Triangle twist in late-night murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A 44-year-old labour contractor was murdered late on Wednesday in front of his Keshtopur residence, near Baguiati. 

 Police suspect the murder of Ramprasad Srestha by a group of unidentified men could have been due to his involvement in a love triangle. Thirty-eight-year-old Archana Thapar, who lived in the same three-storeyed building as the victim, has been arrested in this connection.

 ?Thapar lost her husband a year ago, and Srestha shared one of the ground-floor flats. Sheikh Bilu, alias Dilip, moved into an adjacent flat a few months ago and allegedly got involved with Thapar,? said an official of the Rajarhat police station. ?This led to an altercation last Sunday between Srestha and Thapar when he came to know of the affair,? the official added.

 ?According to local residents, Srestha was taking a stroll in front of his house after returning from work on Wednesday night when he was attacked,? North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said. 

 Preliminary investigations revealed that there were three men who attacked the victim. The body bore multiple stab injuries.

 Sreshtha had reportedly warned Thapar to sever ties with Bilu. ?When Bilu was told that Srestha had asked Thapar not to speak to him, he threatened the labour contractor with dire consequences,? Kumar said.

 Bilu has been missing from the neighbourhood since the incident took place. ?The absence of Bilu further strengthens our suspicion that he could be behind the murder,? Kumar said.

 During interrogation, Thapar denied allegations about her involvement with Bilu. 

 ?She maintained that the suspect was her neighbour and she did not have anything to do with him,? a police officer said. 

 Thapar will be produced in court on Thursday morning.

 Police are also checking whether there could be other motives behind the murder, including professional rivalry.

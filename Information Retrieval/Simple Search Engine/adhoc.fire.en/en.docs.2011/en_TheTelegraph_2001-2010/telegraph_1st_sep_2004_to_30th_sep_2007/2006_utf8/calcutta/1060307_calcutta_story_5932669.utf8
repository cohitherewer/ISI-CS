 Waiver for illegal houses

 - Regularisation to add crores to civic coffers

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided to offer the owners of illegal buildings erected after 1997 a chance to regularise their constructions without paying a penalty.

 The proposal received the state government?s nod last week. Residents of the colony areas in New Alipore, Picnic Garden, Tiljala, Kasba, Jadavpur, Santoshpur, Tollygunge, Garia and Behala are likely to benefit the most from the scheme.

 There are 50,000 three-cottah colony plots in the city. Buildings up to four storeys high, including apartment buildings, have come up illegally on more than 30,000 of the plots over the past 20 years. The owners of these constructions have been enjoying civic services without paying the CMC.

 The owners of the buildings and the flats could not mutate the properties as there was a bar in the civic building rules against legalisation of constructions in the colony areas after 1997, without payment of penalty.

 ?The deadline has been done away with. The owners can now get the buildings and flats in the colony areas legalised without making any payment,? stated director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol.

 According to the civic assessment department, the total number of flats in the colony areas is over 100,000. The regularisation of these structures will help the CMC net extra revenue of Rs 50 crore, officials of the department said. 

 Since the character of the plots and the structures on them have changed, the civic body is considering a proposal to exclude them from the list of colonies. 

 Also under consideration is a voluntary disclosure scheme, on the lines of the waiver-of-interest offer on property tax introduced by the previous CMC board. Under the scheme, the owners will have to fill a form stating the built-up area on the colony plots. The flat-owners can also make the disclosure to get the mutation done. 

 The CMC has estimated that the building department has suffered revenue loss of about Rs 100 crore in terms of building sanction fees. The annual loss to the civic coffer in terms of property tax has been over Rs 30 crore due to non-regularisation of structures on colony plots.

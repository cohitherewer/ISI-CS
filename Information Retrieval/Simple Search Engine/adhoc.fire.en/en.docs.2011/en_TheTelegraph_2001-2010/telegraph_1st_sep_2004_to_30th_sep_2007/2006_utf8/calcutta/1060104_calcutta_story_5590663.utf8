Life

 Mediterranean mood

 Llifestyle Zone

 Ciao bella, at 3, Queens Park, is a quaint haven of fashionable collects. The brainchild of designer Madhu Khaitan, this boutique houses everything from exquisite bridal lehngas, linen shirts for men, intricately embellished cushion covers and some stunning silver trinkets.

 Having launched her label in April 2005, Madhu gave shape to her store later in the year, in August. The most striking feature at the studio, apart from the exquisite decor, is the use of mixed media, be it in the net saris or batua-style bags.

 Resham, applique, sequins, lace, buttons and mother-of-pearls ? each of these elements seems to effortlessly find a perfect place in the melange of fashion facets.

 Decor details

 Not conventional in the least, the decor is very Mediterranean, both in look and feel. A stone floor and a span of creamy, textured ceiling set the mood at this lifestyle zone. Lush green plants on the outside and sleek leather chairs with a glass-top table help enhance it further. 

 Bright pink, intricately embroidered cushion covers add a dash of colour to the sitting corner. Very Italian in design, smart shelves showcase the accessories and bags in style. An oval aquarium placed on one side is definitely the eye-catcher at Ciao bella.

 The trial room is tastefully done up, too. A huge slab of etched glass, complete with back-lighting stands on a wooden base. A Venetian mask adds distinctive character while raw silk curtains in turquoise make for a regal finishing touch.

 The cut-out on the ceiling bears the stores logo in crystal, casting interesting designs all around.

 Wardrobe wonders 

 Having specialised in experimental embroidery, Madhus ensembles reflect an eclectic mix of mediums ? quite a riot of colours and forms. Bridal lehngas are mostly in raw silks and brocade and the lighter ones are mainly in silk blends. Starting at Rs 5,000, these go up to Rs 70,000. Stocks on display, though, are marked within a range of Rs 35,000. 

 The saris at Ciao bella are stylish and concept-based, starting at Rs 3,500. Some interesting finds are chiffons used as patches and highlighted with resham and sequins.

 so on display is a wide range of womens westerns ? smart jackets that can be picked up as separates or with co-ordinated trousers.

 The mens wear comprises embellished kurtas with tone-on-tone embroidery and well-cut shirts in linen. This range is both designed in-house and also outsourced.

 Fringe benefits

 Bags, shawls, cushion covers and jewellery ? the accessory line-up is available in various styles and designs.

 Bags in many shapes are on offer. Some are cool canvas printed, some cylindrical and others funky square ones. Also available is a plethora of potlis and batuas, beautifully embellished with ribbons, stones, zardosi and sequins.

 We also custom-make the bags on request, says Madhu. The bags are all priced Rs 750 onwards.

 The jewellery, too, displays an interesting variety. Mostly set in silver, theres everything from tiny trinkets to huge chandelier earrings. Other eye-catchers are chunky stones in abstract forms. Mother-of-pearls, moonstones, corals, garnets and onyx ? trendy elements fuse with modern sensibilities to create stunning pieces. These are all priced between Rs 390 and Rs 5,800.

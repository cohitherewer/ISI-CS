The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High-end flats 

 see sell-out surge 

 - For square-foot buyers in new-age addresses, price is no longer a factor

 SUBHRO SAHA

 Calcutta is living life kingsize ? in dwelling dens to match. For an increasingly large segment of square-foot buyers at new-age addresses, apartments equal lifestyle products. So, condominium class is here and the price tag is no longer a deterrent if the specs are right.

 ?In four-five months, we have seen a surge in sales of apartments in the range of Rs 30-60 lakh and more. In Hiland Woods in Rajarhat, we have sold 300 HIG units in the past five months, while over12 months, we had sold just 100,? says Nandu Belani, managing director of the Belani Group.

 Pradip Sureka of the Sureka Group reports a similar response to his high-end flats in New Town?s Sunrise Point, where ?maximum movement? is in the Rs 35-45 lakh band. The HIG segment of Ujjwala at Rajarhat, from the Bengal Ambuja stable, is also a sell-out.

 Upcountry major Unitech, which launched its first phase at an introductory price of Rs 1,800/sq ft last July, has already pushed up basic price to Rs 2,500/sq ft. ?Our apartments start at Rs 40 lakh and go up to 1.2 crore, and every single unit of our first three phases is gone,? says Sameer Bahri, head, eastern region, Bengal Unitech Universal Infrastructure.

 What is driving this brick-and-mortar boom in a segment that was a traditional laggard in the city? ?We have seen a large investor community coming in of late to drive sales. Business, particularly in IT, is doing well in Bengal and there?s a feel-good factor all around,? offers Belani.

 ?Salaries across the board have jumped over the past couple of years and the aspiration level of house-hunters is rising all the time in Calcutta, which now wants to catch up with its metro counterparts,? offers Sureka.

 Pawan Agarwal of property marketing agents NK Realtors confirms the luxury lap-up. ?Flats in the 30-40 lakh bracket are hot cakes. Getting a decent apartment in Ballygunge or Alipore for even Rs 60-70 lakh is becoming difficult,? he says.

 While Bahri of Unitech reports around 25 per cent mop-up by NRIs, non-resident Bengalis are also making a beeline for upscale city properties, feels Jakarta-based NRI Prasoon Mukherjee, a partner in Kolkata West International City. The mammoth West Howrah project has seen ?tremendous response? to its 70 lakh-plus bungalows.

 Four days too far for CAS

 SAMARPAN DUTTA

 Only four days are left for the scheduled roll-out of the conditional access system (CAS) in the city, but multi-system operators (MSOs) are not prepared for new-age television viewing.

 Information and cultural secretary Dilip Chakraborty said the MSOs have not been able to stock enough set-top boxes (STBs) a must for viewing pay channels once CAS is launched on January 1 to meet the expected demand.

 We are trying to ensure that the subscribers who have applied for the boxes get them in time. Of the three lakh-odd subscribers in the areas CAS will be launched in the first phase, around 25,000 have applied for STBs, Chakraborty said.

 A telecom regulatory authority of India official monitoring the implementation of CAS, too, has expressed the fear that the situation may get out of hand, with demand far outstripping supply.

 In the first phase, CAS will be implemented in Alipore, New Alipore, Behala, Chetla, Budge Budge, Garden Reach, parts of Thakurpukur, Tollygunge, Haridevpur and Mahestala. Residents of these areas refusing to go for CAS will be denied popular pay channels. 

 There will be chaos once the analogue signals are taken off air and the pay channels dont reach cable homes from January 1 midnight. The situation is such that if the demand rises, it will take at least three months to provide the STBs. How will the customers react if they do not get to watch their favourite channels for three months? the officer asked.

 By the first week of January, officials are expecting a demand for at least 1.8 lakh STBs. According to market sources, the collective STB stock of the MSOs is barely 36,000.

 While MSO Manthan Broadband has a subscriber base of 80,000-odd in the first-phase areas, it has a stock of only 1,000 boxes and may acquire another 4,000 by January 15.

 Similarly, Siticable and Indian Cablenet, which have a combined subscriber base of 1.5 lakh, have managed to stock only 22,000 boxes and expect to get another 20,000 by the second week of January. Cablecom and Srishti have approximately 2,000 and 10,000 boxes, against a subscriber base of 20,000 and 35,000, respectively.

 Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva, which has only 2,500 subscribers, may have to beat a hasty retreat, as it has practically been forced out by big players.

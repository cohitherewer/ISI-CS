 Me the brand has to outlive me the person

 Death threats, air missiles, suicide bombings... JOHN ABRAHAM tells Pratim D. Gupta why Kabul Express comes once in a lifetime

 You could have done without Kabul Express. Why take 

 the risk?

 When Kabir Khan came to me with the script, the first thing that struck me was that I wanted to go and see Afghanistan. I wanted to be there, on the terrain I had only seen on news channels. Also, the script was very interesting. I immediately fell in love with it. And I am happy that I did Kabul Express because now that I see the finished product I feel proud of it.

 But in the middle of all the death threats and bombings 

 didnt you feel at any point of time that it was a bad idea?

 I dont look at life in retrospection. We were already there in Afghanistan. So whatever was happening was happening around us. We had to stay there and carry on. I was being advised by the RAW. I was constantly in touch with my producer Aditya Chopra. The shooting did get stopped for a few days but then we bounced back with all the required security arrangements. And since the security was being provided by the Afghani intelligence, we felt safe.

 You had accepted the film even before Yash Raj Films came 

 on board

 Banners are important but banners are not everything. I want to do what I believe in. I always go by my gut feel. If its a big banner, its good. If its a big idea, even better.

 Kabul Express depends a lot on your camaraderie with 

 Arshad Warsi. How was he to work with?

 Oh, superb! Arshad is the best co-star I have worked with. All the difficulties that we faced in Afghanistan were made easier because of him. We got along like a house on fire. Touch wood. He is not only a brilliant actor, he is a great human being. And he is addictive. I am so happy that we are doing another film together, Vivek Agnihotris Goal.

 You also worked with an international cast an American, 

 a Pakistani and an Afghan

 And they are all right here with me. They have come to Mumbai for the promotion and premiere of Kabul Express. Its great just sitting here and going back to all the great times we spent on the sets of the film. We had good fun. We all come from different backgrounds and bring different talents on board.

 Do you think your presence makes an offbeat film commercial?

 I dont believe in this commercial dictum of the film industry. Work is work. To put it simply, I should like the story in the first place and then have conviction in the director. Every film that I work in has to work for me at the script level. And post-Baabul, I have been able to choose the films I want to do. Whether its Goal with Vivek Agnihotri or No Smoking with Anurag Kashyap or Rockstar with Imtiaz Ali or the film with Soham, all work for me before I have started shooting.

 Today theres the John Abraham calendar, the John Abraham 

 bike series, the John Abraham clothing line. Your brands 

 getting bigger by the day

 As a marketing person, I am aware that John Abraham the brand has to be bigger than John Abraham the person. Me the brand has to outlive me the person. And as of now, things are looking nice, by the grace of God. My biggest plus point is that my audience is with me.

 We all missed you in Dhoom:2

 You did? Well, I dont do post-mortem of a movie. I myself have seen the film and I felt it needed a different cast.

 So what is your next big challenge after Kabul Express?

 No Smoking. I am a non-smoker and I have to play this chain smoker who is trying to quit. Its an 80-day shoot and I am needed every day. So, its fully around me. In terms of joys of cinema, No Smoking with Anurag Kashyap has been the best experience of my life.

 Gender speak

 Bethune College hosted a UGC-sponsored 

 workshop on changing gender scenario in the world on March 

 3. It was jointly organised by the departments of economics, 

 history, political science and psychology.

 Bharati Roy, president of the college?s governing body, in her address pointed out the predominant role of gender in every aspect of life in the 21st Century.

 Parliamentarian Ratnabali Chatterjee focussed on the trafficking of women and girl children.

 The scope of feminism, the speakers said, has widened to include both activism and scholarship. They called for formation of groups, both at the national and international level to push women?s causes.

 Varsity beats

 It was music magic at the centenary 

 auditorium on CU?s College Street campus on March 8. And 

 keeping the tempo going was Chandrabindoo with hits like 

 Juju, Duniya.com, Riskawala, Paashbalish 

 and Bondhu tomay. The show was part of Campus 

 2006, a cultural extravaganza presented by the students? 

 union to mark the 150th year of the university. 

 The evening also saw the prize distribution of the annual sports and cultural competitions of CU. This was followed by the staging of play Istehadi and a performance by Rupankar.

 The students took the stage after that to show off their dance moves to the tune of Bollywood chartbusters. The audience joined in with impromptu jigs.

 Media matters

 Media should become the mouthpiece 

 of every section of the society without any discrimination. 

 Free press evolves in a free society but free society evolves 

 only where there is no fear. This was the chorus at the 

 regional seminar on ?Qualitative Change in Democracy and 

 Role of Media?, organised by AMIC at the Press Club on March 

 4 and 5. 

 Eminent media personalities highlighted the role of media in promoting democracy at the seminar. Prof Amal Mukhopadhyay reminded future journalists of their social responsibility in the era of market-driven media. Senior journalist Rathin Banerjee regretted the loss of credibility of the media, while Snehasis Sur commented on the timeliness of the seminar. Chief information commissioner Arun Bhattacharya discussed the Information Act.

 Moments in the Twilight...

 Pouring rain, pelting pain, so 

 much so, I feel insane... 

 Bottled up so much I hear 

 Of a dreadful end, a constant fear... 

 I feel like dew on leaves so green

 A reverie, is all this a dream? 

 Like sailing clouds across the azure sky

 Under duress somewhere tears die? 

 Cherry and crimson streak daylight

 Snow peaks shine divine white? 

 Ethereal beauty of nature?s makes, 

 A welcoming sun as I finally awake 

 To truth, glory of an intangible sort?

 In the fallacy of joy I now am caught?

 True or False

 In love with an image

 An image not me

 This you or no you

 Life would live

 Paper lantern patterns of time

 Scrape sweet sapphires off my smile

 Absorb fatigue in an embrace

 Maybe that would be love

 Violet vases of crystals of light

 Liquid sun of winters in your arms

 Chit Chat

 Consumer cause

 The students at Eastern Institute of Management were in for a treat last week, with the guru of consumer behaviour, Prof Jagdish Seth, agreeing to spend an afternoon on the campus. The aim was to offer students an insight into global management trends, but we would have been happy merely to meet the great man. The fact that Prof Seth is rarely in India, and even more infrequently in Calcutta, made the occasion momentous. 

 Within minutes of walking into the auditorium, the professor had effortlessly put us at ease as he guided us to areas of management we knew little about. He covered a range of topics, but spent the most amount of time on ?how to add value to consumers?. Seth emphasised the importance of an organisation to understand customer needs and help shape them.

 We listened fascinated as he identified trends in the US and Indian markets. The marketing men in India will have to capitalise on the technology and communication boom, he stressed.

 A large number of the institute alumni and the best management brains of Calcutta attended the interaction. A lively question-answer session followed the talk.

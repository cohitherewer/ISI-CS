 Thrill of instant cricket, indoors

 A cricket match 

 at Space Circle on Friday. Picture by Rashbehari Das 

 Cricket in Colombo might have 

 been a washout, but rain cant play spoilsport in Calcutta 

 as the fifth edition of the Corporate Indoor Cricket tournament, 

 stroked off on Independence Day, gathers momentum at the 

 air-conditioned Skydrome arena of Space Circle Club.

 The field has grown from 24 to 

 64 teams and the enthusiasm has been infectious over the 

 years. It removes rank, hierarchy and age barriers, bringing 

 together those who are playing their last match before retirement 

 and those who have just joined the company, on the same 

 pitch, says Sanjeev Ghosh, general manager of the club.

 The VIP Road club offers temporary 

 membership to participants and their families for the duration 

 of the entire tournament, the finals of which are slated 

 for September 16. The idea is to encourage participation 

 and promote camaraderie, adds Ghosh.

 There is star presence as well 

 with former Bengal Ranji captain Utpal David Chatterjee 

 (turning out for UBI) leading a sprinkling of Ranji players 

 in various teams. With Twenty20 cricket now creeping into 

 both our lexicon and our domestic structure, short-duration 

 matches have fired the imagination of the city. Matches 

 at the Space Circle indoor tournament are eight-a-side affairs. 

 The rules are fairly simple and ensure that every participant 

 gets an opportunity to bat and bowl.

 While each side consists of eight 

 players, the squad can include two reserve players. Each 

 player has to complete one over each of batting and bowling. 

 The tournament is designed in such a way that each team 

 gets to play a minimum of three games, with the field divided 

 into three divisions Gold Plate, Silver Plate and Bowl.

 The Space Circle tournament 

 has become a red-dot event in our corporate calendar and 

 we have been participating since its inception, declares 

 Jayanta Bhattacharyya, manager, customer engineering services, 

 BOC. The crowd, ambience and organisation all contribute 

 to make it a compulsory stop for the Taratala Road corporate 

 house, which won the Losers Plate last year.

 The organisers have introduced 

 special prizes for the Best-Dressed Team (won by Ernst amp; 

 Young last year), the Best Cheering Team (won by Labvantage) 

 and the Best Sporting Team (bagged by ITC Travel House) 

 to spice up proceedings further.

 Club general manager Ghosh feels 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers is a hot contender for the Best-Dressed 

 Team this time. 

 The entrance of a clutch of Sector 

 V units like IBM, eRevMax, Avaya Global and Atos Origin 

 has been a high point, while a number of real-estate 

 firms like Mani Group, NK Realtors and Vedic Village have 

 also joined the fray.

 Whistling Woods International 

 in Mumbai; (below) dean Kurt Inderbitzin

 Its initials may suggest something more gruesome, but Whistling Woods International (WWI) has little to do with war. Bollywood showman Subhash Ghai?s dream project built over sprawling 20 acres of land at Goregaon Film City, WWI is India?s answer to the likes of NYFA, UCLA and USC. The dean of the recently launched film school, which ?offers an international standard of education through a unique Indian perspective?, Kurt Inderbitzin was in Calcutta for a few hours on Sunday for a WWI seminar.

 With 12 years of experience in writing, directing and producing movies and shows for major studios and networks, including CBS, ABC, NBC, TNT, HBO and Warner Brothers, Kurt has already taught at noted institutes like the University of La Verne and Georgetown University. The reason for shifting to India and taking over WWI was not an overnight one for the man who has worked with the likes of Adrien Brody and Christopher Walken.

 ?Firstly, I was presented with an opportunity to be the first dean of an institute which can be running for the next 500 or 1,000 years,? he told Metro at The Park. ?Then there?s the fact that India is a very exciting place at the moment in the world of media, especially with a booming economy. Also, I love to teach.?

 Having seen many a top film school from close quarters, Kurt is confident that WWI will deliver the goods. ?The infrastructure, the technology, the faculty is on a par with the best American colleges,? he asserted. ?The only difference is that Whistling Woods offers the same course at one-fourth their price and that will surely bring more international students here.?

 The goal, Kurt feels, is not to just produce students who can make stellar productions locally but who can call the shots anywhere in the world. ?Why should they just make Bollywood musicals, they should be in a position to go to studios in Hollywood, Japan and France and work with the best in the world,? he elaborated. 

 WWI?s solid faculty should come in handy, feels Kurt. ?Come on, Naseer (Naseeruddin Shah) is not only heading the acting department, he?s actually designing the course... We have some of the best full-time faculty members apart from some famous guest lecturers (Mira Nair, Shyam Benegal, Ketan Mehta?) Our goal is to utilise their expertise and knowhow for the benefit of our students.?

 Kurt clarifies that you do not have to be a Tarantino or a Santosh Sivan to make it to the different courses ? direction, cinematography, editing, audiography and acting. ?It is really not about what they have to know before coming to Whistling Woods,? he said. ?They should have a basic college degree, some creative aptitude and a lot of maturity. Because it is a very tough programme and only people with real passion and tenacity will make it. We are not looking for students who get up in the morning and shout, ?I want to be a film star?.?

 But in a country where most famous film-makers have made it on their own, is technical education in cinema all that important?

 ?You wouldn?t have asked me this question had we been talking about medicine or engineering,? he shot back. ?Having been involved with all this for 15 years, I feel I have learnt nothing. Media is just as complex if not more than all other areas of life.?

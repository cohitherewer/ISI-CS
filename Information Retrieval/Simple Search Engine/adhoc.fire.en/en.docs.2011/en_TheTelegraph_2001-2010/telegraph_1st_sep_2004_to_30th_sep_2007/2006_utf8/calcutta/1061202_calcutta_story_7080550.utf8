The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chime of change

 This little boy in yellow 

 found a job to his liking at a childrens programme 

 held recently at National Library auditorium. With a 

 mischievous smile on his face, he merrily knocked off 

 the toy brick house that the girl had made. The interactive 

 session with kids and parents was organised by Read 

 On..., a centre for communication skills in the English 

 language. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 

 From Shakespeares Lady Macbeth 

 and Brutus to Maarich, Ravana and Manthara of Ramayana 

 to Mahabharatas Kansa, Valmiki led all of them 

 on the path to reform at the Science City auditorium recently. 

 The occasion was the Founders Day programme of Lakshmipat 

 Singhania Academy.

 Parivartan A Global Metamorphosis, the play presented by students of the school, was truly global in theme. Taking off from Tagores dance-drama Valmiki Pratibha, the story of a dacoit turning into a sage, the play portrayed some well-known literary and mythological negative characters in good light. The characters were not shown as evil and were instead depicted as victims of circumstance, who are ready to change for the better if given a fair chance.

 In a world held to ransom by terrorism, 

 the show put up by the 275 students from classes III to 

 XII offered a new perspective on fighting evil. The songs 

 were self-scripted and the narration was in a mix of English 

 and Hindi. The choreography was innovative, set to music 

 from six different countries, including Scotland, Ireland, 

 English folk and ballet, West Asia and an Afro-Latino mix 

 (picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya).

 The show was a success, thanks to people like choreographer Sanjay Bhattacharya and play director Rajesh Gupta.

 Learning curve

 Three days of learning coupled with oodles of fun. Sounds contradictory? Well, that is exactly what the youngsters who recently gathered in Bangalore from 25 cities across the country had to say about their experience. The occasion was the national finals of the Horlicks Wiz Kids 2006, an inter-school festival organised by Activity.

 From November 3 to 8, the 44 finalists, selected through city finals from schools across the country lived it up at the Ancient School of Wisdom, an institution set in an idyllic landscape 32 km out of Bangalore. The roster of activities included a talent round, a project presentation and an outing to Pegasus, an institute where the participants engaged in activities that ranged from obstacle race to rope wall climbing. A night trek under the moonlit sky capped the adventure agenda for the participants, many of whom were staying away from parents for the first time. Nilabhra Mondal of Don Bosco School, Liluah, one of the 12 shortlisted candidates, thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the night trek being the high point of his trip. 

 The Grand Finale, held at Ambedkar Bhavan in Bangalore, included a talent round where the 12 candidates showcased their special flair. The clincher was the Judges Round where they battled it out amidst questions dealt to them by Rajeev Gowda of IIM Bangalore, Nirmala Karunan of Greenpeace India, Colonel Anil, the NCC regional head, and Geeta Ramanujam, principal of National College, Jaynagar. 

 Mani Sudhir Selvaraj from Bangalore, Anupama Kumar from Cochin, Deepika Easwaran from Chennai and Kishlay Kishan from Patna emerged the winners. They get to go to Philippines on an educational-cultural exchange from January 6 to 9 where they represent India on the Charter of Human Responsibility, a global project which is a platform for students to create awareness on social and environmental issues. 

 Said Anupama: Earlier, I wondered whether the friendship I struck with other participants here will suffer because I won and they didnt. But we have become like a family.

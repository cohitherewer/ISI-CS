The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Mind games after dud duo

 Will director Ananth Mahadevan be third time lucky with Aksar, a suspense drama? 

 He started his directorial career with the RD Burman tribute Dil Vil Pyar Vyar, but the actor we best know as the khalnayak of Khiladi has finally put together a thriller. After Dil Maange More?s lukewarm reception at the box-office last year, Ananth Mahadevan ? he?s now added a Narayan as his middle name ? is ready to release Aksar starring Dino Morea, Emraan Hashmi and Udita Goswami.

 ?It is more of a suspense drama and I have tried to give it that very French noir flavour,? Mahadevan tells Metro, of the film releasing on January 27. ?It is an amoral film, very adult in theme. Aksar is about the mind games between three different individuals from three different backgrounds and it is a gripping ride till the end where there?s a twist in the tale.?

 The film has Dino Morea playing a stiff-upper-lip aristocratic businessman, something out of screen character for the model-turned-actor. ?It?s sad that he hasn?t been exploited at all in the film industry,? rues Mahadevan. ?When he wears those glasses and suits, Dino almost looks like Christopher Reeves. There?s this classic James Stewart feel to his character ? the way he walks, the way he talks. It?s like a comeback of the character we have lost over the years.?

 Emraan, on the other hand, plays a character that he knows best. ?He is this wild fashion photographer who has a debonair attitude towards life? Emraan fitted the role like a glove. He, like the character he portrays, wears his heart on his sleeve. Maybe not in real life but at least in the kind of characters he has played till now.?

 The role of the madam in the middle, however, wasn?t offered to Udita at first. ?We asked Celina Jaitley to do the film,? recalls Mahadevan. ?Fortunately or unfortunately she couldn?t give us the necessary dates because she had committed to Jawani Diwani and Zinda. At that stage, we thought of bringing back the Zeher pair of Emraan and Udita.?

 But the real star of Aksar in the countdown is music director Himesh Reshammiya with Jhalak dhikhla ja and Lagi lagi setting the charts on fire. ?I started with a retro musical like Dil Vil Pyar Vyar where Panchamda?s original arranger Babloo Chakraborty recreated the soul of RD Burman?s songs. Then for Dil Maange More, an irreverent romantic comedy, Himesh and I came up with some melodious stuff,? says the director. ?But for Aksar, we were always sure that the ?sound? would be very different since a thriller doesn?t lend itself to songs. So, for the four situations in the film, I hunted down five numbers from the 50 that Himesh offered me.?

 The way Dil Vil? and Dil Maange? were written off as flops remains a sore point. ?The music royalty of Dil Vil? alone got Rs 2.5 crore. For a film with Rs 5.5 crore budget, that?s a lot. Dil Maange More too made quite a profit. Since these films are not backed by big production houses, they are pulled down? I believe I have made two lovely little films where I have tried to retain a certain kind of sensibility within the framework of commercial cinema.?

 Mahadevan has also churned out a small festival flick in Staying Alive based on the life of screenwriter Soojit Sen. ?It is a black comedy where a newspaper sub-editor and a don are lying in two adjoining beds at a hospital. While the sub-editor has had his third heart attack and is now almost laughing at death, the underworld guy is scared after his first heart attack. So, it is about their bonding in that one room and how the don learns the lesson of his life.?

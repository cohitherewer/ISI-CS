 Traders opt for self-help 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 We don?t need your protection, we know how to tackle goons ? this was the message traders of the Burrabazar-Posta area delivered to the local police after driving away a gang of armed extortionists.

 On Friday night, three armed men tried to snatch a bag with cash in it from the owner of a telephone booth off Jamnalal Bajaj Street. The owner resisted and the attackers hit him on the head with a pipegun butt. The man raised an alarm and then residents chased them away. The goons escaped bursting bombs.

 Since then, traders of the city?s business hub have become confident that they can protect themselves. They have decided to put up a strong resistance whenever they are under attack.

 ?Friday?s incident has set an example for us. Two days have passed, but none of the culprits has been arrested. How can we rely on the lawkeepers?? said Amit Pandey, assistant secretary of Burrabazar Nagarik Front.

 Pandey added that businessmen now have no option but to put up a strong resistance on their own since going to the police makes no difference, and politicians do not pay any heed to their pleas. 

 The traders are asking porters and handcart-pullers to join hands with them. A porter had played a key role in chasing away the attackers. Deputy commissioner of police, central division, Ajay Kumar said a hunt was on to track down the culprits.

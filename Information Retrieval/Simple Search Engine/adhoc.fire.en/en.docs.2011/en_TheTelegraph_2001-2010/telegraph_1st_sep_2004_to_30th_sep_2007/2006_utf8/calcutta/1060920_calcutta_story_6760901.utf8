 Church schools in breakaway chant

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 The Church of North India (CNI) is planning to break away from the state-level body of Anglo-Indian schools and form its own association.

 The heads of more than a dozen CNI schools in the city, all of them popular with parents, and more than 100 institutions in eastern, northeastern and northern states will be part of the new association. 

 The principals of the state CNI schools are now members of the association of the heads of nearly 70 Anglo-Indian schools in Bengal.

 The heads of the CNI schools will be able to implement our policies better if the new association is formed, bishop of Calcutta diocese of the CNI Reverend P.S.P. Raju said on Monday.

 The guideline for CNI schools is different from that for the other missionary schools... Unlike other Anglo-Indian schools, the CNI institutions do not take assistance from the state government. Our schools also offer certain facilities to teachers and students that are not provided in the other institutions, added the bishop.

 Sources in the Calcutta diocese said a committee of principals of CNI schools in various states has been constituted to find ways to maximise the benefit of the institutions by forming the association.

 The panel has also been asked to examine whether the CNI schools would need to continue as members of the existing state-level body of Anglo-Indian institutions after they have their own association.

 According to sources, the principals of the CNI schools are unlikely to continue as members of the state-level body once the new association has been constituted.

 Bengal is the only state where the government pays the dearness allowance (DA) of the teachers and non-teaching staff of Anglo-Indian schools. The CNI schools in Calcutta decided to stop accepting the assistance from the state government two years ago.

 Reverend Raju stated the proposal to set up the association was placed at a meeting of the CNI in Delhi recently.

 St James School principal Terence Ireland has been selected representative from the eastern zone.

 The first meeting of the panel will be held soon. I will be in a position to highlight the activities of the proposed association after attending the meeting, Ireland said.

 J.K. Sen, principal of Julien Day School (Ganganagar) and general secretary of Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools in West Bengal, however, said he had no information about the CNIs plan to break away.

 ?Antare atripti rabe sango kori mone hobe/Shesh hoye hoiylo na shesh? was what Tagore said of short stories. They leave behind a yearning inside, and even as one finishes, it doesn?t feel as if they have ended.

 A collection of 14 contemporary Bengali short fiction translated and edited in English by Aruna Chakravarti does precisely that. After each story, the reader needs a pause to break away from the spell the stories cast.

 And it is here that Chakravarti succeeds, both as a translator and an editor.

 At the launch of the Penguin anthology The Way Home at the Crossword bookstore on Friday, Aruna chose to read excerpts from a few of the stories of those who were present at the show. 

 Sunil Gangopadhyay?s Palatak O Anushandhankari, a tale of fugitives of the Naxalite movement, Bani Basu?s Uttar Paksha, a gender-sensitive story highlighting the chasm between illusion and reality, and Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay?s Gharer Path made for some magical moments.

 On her selection, Chakravarti said: ?Tagore has been extensively and widely translated. I saw no point in doing him again. Contemporary fiction is what is being written in our times or maybe 50 years ago.? 

 Hence, The Way Home begins with Rajshekhar Basu and his comical expose on gender relations. More sombre tales follow, that of Bibhutibhushan?s Mouri Phool, Ashapurna Devi?s Cactus and Suchitra Bhattacharya?s Shikhar Thikana. Powerful stories all of them, they can be grouped under the gender theme. Even so, Chakravarti came in for flak for having a gender disbalance in her collection. 

 Sanjukta Dasgupta, a teacher of English literature at Calcutta University, who moderated the show, pointed out the omission of Nabanita Dev Sen. 

 The stories, arranged according to the lifetime of the authors, bring to the fore the stylistic evolution in Bengali literature. The late 20th Century fiction of Samaresh Basu, Sunil Gangopadhyay and Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay take on metaphorical dimensions.

 Shirshendu?s story, from which the book takes its title, has a magic-real world of illusion and fantasy that talk of familial relations and home. As a translator, she finds a challenge in tackling these nuanced and varied styles. 

 Having translated Srikanta and Shei Shamay, Aruna faced a different proposition doing short stories. ?There was a distinct style change in each story. Some were lyrical, others down to earth.?

 Writing for not just the Indian reader but the western audience, too, particularly ?in this golden age of Indian literature in English?, the editor admits to modifications. ?I highlighted some aspects that would endear the work more to the international reader and discarded the retrogressive elements.?

 But she reiterated: ?I haven?t bent over backwards to please the western audience.? The Bengali audience, too, would love to rifle through The Way Home, if only to savour their favourite stories in English and encourage their English-speaking children to read them.

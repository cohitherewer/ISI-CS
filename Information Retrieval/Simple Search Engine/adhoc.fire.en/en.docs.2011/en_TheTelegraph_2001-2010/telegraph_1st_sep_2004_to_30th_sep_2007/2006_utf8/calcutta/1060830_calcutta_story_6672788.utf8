The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 River cops in fast forward

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 The growing rate of terrorist attacks and crime on the ghats has prompted the city police to draw a plan to modernise the river traffic wing. 

 A 26-km-long stretch of the Hooghly, from Budge Budge to Konnagar, falls under the jurisdiction of the river traffic police. Their job is to keep a tab on the major ghats and installations like Howrah bridge, Vidyasagar Setu, Budge Budge oil refinery, Calcutta port and Netaji Subhas Dock.

 The river traffic wing is an integral part of Calcutta Police. We have decided to equip it with state-of-the-art equipment to monitor the ghats and other major installations, like Howrah bridge, joint commissioner of police (administration) Kuldiep Singh told Metro on Tuesday.

 According to the plan, closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) will be installed at the major ghats and bridges to keep an tab on crime and suicide deaths on the riverfront. 

 Right now, our aim is to keep a vigil on the ghats during the festive season, so that we can check the count of deaths by drowning during immersions. We are working out the plan with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, an river traffic police officer said. 

 He added that with the installation of the CCTVs, they can also check the drug deals on the ghats. 

 Drug peddlers hire a boat and meet their local contacts. Several gangs are working here. We came to know about this after a racket was busted in July, in which two persons were arrested and 15 kg of ganja and opium seized. The CCTVs will definitely help in checking these rackets, joint commissioner Singh said. 

 Officers of river traffic police complained that Howrah bridge and the ghats have become suicide points. 

 We have been acting as counsellors to check the growing rate of suicide. We have to devote a lot of time in such cases, rued an officer of the river traffic police. 

 An officer at Lalbazar said they were planning to hire psychologists for counselling sessions. Besides, vigil will also be stepped up at the ghats to check the suicide attempts.

 Indulging in the age of innocence

 - Show 

of limited-edition serigraphs by Paritosh Sen 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A Paritosh Sen drawing

 It needs an artist of no mean skill to execute the drawing of the little boy with a sling the way that Paritosh Sen does. The muscles of the little devil?s stomach are taut and tense as he is about to release the missile. The drawing is about as close as possible to nature, but at the same time, the artist pokes gentle fun at the little brat, as he does in many of his drawings on display at Akar Prakar gallery. On display here is a set of limited edition serigraphs of the artist?s works signed by him.

 Sen has executed two drawings of a man who has fallen off his cycle, clothes and limbs all in a tangle, the very picture of chaos and confusion. In its hasty execution, it is very close to a cartoon but a little more than that. No cartoonist would have distorted the limbs of the victims as comfortably as Sen does.

 The age of innocence seems to be a subject close to Sen?s heart and he depicts children with great adroitness and spontaneity. The tiny boy king (is he wearing a false moustache?) sits on a throne like a little rag doll, although his eyes are alive with curiosity. A child gorges on a melon. One of them feeds a pet goat, while another plays a flute. He has a keen eye for the mundane and the ordinary, like a plate of sweets crawling with ants and vegetables and fish being sold in a market.

 Sen?s lines are spare, sure and sensitive. He is best when he depicts objects that have no apparent beauty, such as a pair of gnarled and wrinkled hands that seems to be a study in self-introspection. He can build up emotion with a couple of powerful strokes.

 Apart from these small drawings, he has done some others on a grander scale. In a few, he makes liberal use of gold. Ravan with his 10 heads sheds tears of grief ? a tragic hero brought low. A woman in full bloom ? Kalighat paat style ?waits in anticipation in her boudoir, mobile phone clinging to her ear. 

 The cobbler reminds one of the Company paintings of yore, depicting the various professions. Such cross references make the viewing of Sen?s drawings all the more rewarding. His mind seems to be in present times, while by training he is steeped in tradition which makes this shuttling back and forth from past to present and the reverse all the more easy for the octogenarian artist.

 His drawings of voluptuous women culminate with the picture of a couple making love, viewed through a parting in bedroom curtains. It is intimate and voyeuristic, like the scene of a stage play. 

 Sen is not multi culti but this work will remind viewers of those erotic vignettes that the Japanese excel in.

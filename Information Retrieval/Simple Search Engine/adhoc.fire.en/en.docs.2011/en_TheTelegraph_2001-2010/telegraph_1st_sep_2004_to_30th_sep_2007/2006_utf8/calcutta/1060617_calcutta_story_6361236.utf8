 Police fail to crack abduction case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Five days after the family of the missing Argha Daw, 32, lodged a complaint of receiving a ransom call, the police have failed to make any headway in the case. 

 Though Argha?s family, which is from the Muchipara area, has not received a second ransom call, police are looking for leads to identify the caller.

 Daw, who belongs to a business family, has been missing from last Saturday. The same day, his family received an SMS, in which he said he was in the city and would return home late.

 Then, on Sunday, Argha?s sister received a ransom call, demanding Rs 2 lakh. ?We came to know about it on Monday, when the family came and lodged an official complaint,? said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 Police found out that Daw was in Howrah when he sent the SMS from his cellphone. 

 ?The youth was supposed to get married to a Howrah-based girl soon. He even met her on the day of his disappearance. It is still not clear where he had gone after leaving the girl?s house,? said a detective department officer.

 The caller wanted the cash at Tarapith. When Argha?s sister asked the caller to disclose the exact spot where they should wait with the money, she heard whispers being exchanged. Then, the line suddenly got disconnected. 

 Since then, nobody has called at the Daws? Hidaram Banerjee Lane residence.

 According to the call statement of Daw?s cellphone, the phone was under the coverage area of a tower at Tarapith on Monday. But since then, it has been switched off.

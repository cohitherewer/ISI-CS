 In remembrance of the pioneering work done by Ramkinkar Baij in the field of contemporary Indian sculpture and as a tribute to him on his birth centenary, Shilpakriti, the ongoing exhibition of sculptures, presents works that echo the masters efforts to bring sculpture closer to life and the people in terms of themes, methods, materials, as well as in terms of modern sensibilities. Featuring sculptures in stone, bronze, terracotta, fibre glass, cement-concrete, wood, porcelain and various other materials, the show brings together a microcosm of the range of works being created in the country at present. Bearing evidence of innuendos of thought processes of their creators, they are mostly reflective and symbolic in nature, at times enthused with sensuousness and transparency. Participating artists include Satish Gujral, Uma Siddhanta, Bipin Goswami, Nagji Patel, Tarak Garai, Janak Jhankar Narzary, Sunil Kumar Das, Gopinath Roy, Shyamal Roy (a sculpture by him appears above), Pankaj Panwar, Debashish Bhattacharya and Krishna Yadav.

What: Hip Hop Night with Vishal Kanoi.

Where: Underground at Hotel Hindusthan International (HHI).

When: Friday night.

The bash: The music, the attitude, the style statements and the groove It 

was hip hop from the word go as city-based choreographer Vishal Kanoi took the 

makeshift stage by the dance floor, mike and cap in place.

Hip hop is basically a freestyle dance form 

and every person can interpret it in his or her own way. Hip hop is now a well-accepted 

genre in Calcutta, so it is just the right time to teach people the basics and 

more, said Vishal.

The party people sure picked up some grooves 

and a few loose steps to flaunt on the dance floor. The students were upbeat 

in their hip-hop bests loose denims, tees, jackets, metallic accessories keen 

to shake a leg and have fun. The sound was a lot of R amp;B, Reggaeton everything 

from Daddy Yankee (Rompe) to Abhishek Bachchan (Right here right now).

Voiceover: We are planning to introduce a different dance style every 

month in Underground, said Amit Hathiramani of HHI.

What: Future Friday.

Where: Venom at Fort Knox.

When: Friday night.

The bash: Future Friday will see DJ Ivan spinning his House magic at Venom 

on the last Friday of every month, at a time when the city is all set 

for this sound, having witnessed an over 25 per cent growth in House 

culture in the past couple of months.

ose to 500 clubbers dropped in at Venom to get a feel 

of the latest in House, moving to the beats on a packed dance floor. The hottest 

picks of the night were Feel love and World is mine. The decor of 

the nightclub also boasted an international House feel.

Voiceover: Venom promises to slot many such happening events, 

said Bunty Sethi, proprietor of Venom.

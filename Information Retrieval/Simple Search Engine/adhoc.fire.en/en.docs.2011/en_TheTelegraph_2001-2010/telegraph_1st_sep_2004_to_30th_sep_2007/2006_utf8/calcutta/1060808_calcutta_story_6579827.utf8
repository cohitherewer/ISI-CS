 Rage on the wrist

 From gods and goddesses to toon toppers and screen heroes, the rakhi today is witnessing quite a makeover. Its taking on a contemporary colour without divorcing itself from its traditional hue. 

 So long as the thought or idea behind the ceremonious affair of Raksha Bandhan does not change, it matters little if the pattern of expression does, says Srikant Mohta, proprietor of the nationwide rakhi supply chain Shree Rakhi at Burrabazaar.

 This festive season, buyers are spoilt for choice with the rakhi becoming as much a statement of fashion as of festivity. On the eve of Rakhi, GoodLife checks out some eye-catchers.

 Nik-Nish

 Spiderman, Noddy and Disneyland characters are some of the cartoon-based rakhis flying fast off the racks, thanks to five-to-14 age group. Other innovations at the Camac Street outlet include utility-based Barbie-cum-eraser designs and after-Rakhi use combinations like a watch rakhi. 

 Edible green jelly rakhi and six-set packs (two rakhis, two lumbas and two bajubandhs) complete the list. 

 The intricate work on some of the bajubandhs and rakhi-lumba combinations here includes sequins, beads and coloured stones fixed atop artificial-coloured fur and ribbons. 

 To get the Rakhi sale going, there are special offers on household items and jewellery ranges. 

 Prices range between Rs 10 and Rs 50 for the usual rakhis whereas the combo pack goes up to Rs 350.

 Giggles

 A selection of simple and less elaborate rakhis and fancy threads in an abundance of cheerful colours are laid out on the shelves at the Park Street outlet. 

 Pick and choose within a price range of Rs 15 to Rs 115. Rakhis of rudraksh beads, copper coins, swastika imprints, wooden Chinese beads, polystones, coloured stones and kundan are selling the most. 

 For children, Beyblade and music-cum-light rakhis are a recent rage. And the fun does not end on August 9 stocks will stay for a week after that, while the extras will be stashed away for special requests later in the year.

 Pantaloons (Food Bazaar)

 The range here is not elaborate but it does serve the purpose. From rakhis priced at Rs 19, Rs 29, Rs 39 and Rs 59, one can select single pieces, popular characters like Winnie the Pooh, light-cum-music guitar rakhis and three-piece sets. 

 Zardosi rakhis with salma dubka and gold and silver threads are all-time favourites. 

 A special offer entitles you to one free rakhi with any two that you pick up.

 Landmark

 Clasp-based straps with images 

 of Hanuman and Ganesha to tiny teddy and Pokemon, innovation 

 is the name of the bonding game here.

 Its astounding how big a role television plays in the making and selling of rakhis, says Gautam Jatia, CEO of Landmark. Clubbing Rakhi (August 9) and Friendship Day (August 6) together because of the proximity, the Lord Sinha Road store has sold out almost all its varieties, whether well-crafted embroidered sequins or those studded with semi-precious stones. 

 A rack of rakhis will be on offer till Maheshwari Rakhi, which follows 20 days later.

 Archies (Forum)

 The mod look goes zip, zap, zoom with the leather Harley Davidson bands for boys (Rs 199) and oh-so-trendy with colourful rubber Livestrong bands (Rs 15 for two). 

 ashing rakhis, 24K gold-plated divinity rakhis and cool buddy straps are other items on the hit list. 

 Some bands in festive colours of red and yellow have a raised pattern woven in. 

 Traditional platters consisting of decorated metal plates replete with diyas, sachets of vermilion powder, grains of rice and a soft toy are tagged at Rs 150. Greeting cards with rakhis attached start from Rs 35.

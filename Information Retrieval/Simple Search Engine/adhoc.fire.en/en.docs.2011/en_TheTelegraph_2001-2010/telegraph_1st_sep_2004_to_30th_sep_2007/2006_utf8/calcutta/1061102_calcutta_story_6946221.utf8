A Bollywood trickle throughout the day and a star 

shower in the evening, followed by a generous sprinkle the next afternoon. That 

summed up the first two days of the Lakme Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2007.

The opening day of LFW in Mumbai clearly belonged 

to Bollywoods ace designer Vikram Phadnis. While the fashion week kicked 

off at the NCPA on Tuesday with a low glam quotient, Vikram drew a big Bollywood 

brigade to the final show of the evening.

The designer who has created wardrobes for films like 

No Entry, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Dus, Humraaz and many 

more, lined up almost a Manish Malhotra star cast in the front rows. Priyanka 

Chopra, Suniel Shetty, Fardeen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Amrita Rao, Tabu, Celina Jaitley, 

Riya Sen, Tara Sharma, Preeti Jhangiani, Gul Panag, Poonam Dhillon, Mohd. Azharuddin 

and Sangita Bijlani made up the glam set. 

And the collection was quite in sync with the crowd 

profile. The super-sexy, glam diva look was very Bollywood, with Vikram belting 

out exactly what he does best. The vibrant colour story starting with blue and 

moving on to green, pink and finally orange was the highlight of the line. And 

the Bollywood stars were all praise for the palette.

While everyone from Tabu to Celina to Fardeen mouthed 

I loved the vibrant colours, Suniel Shetty went a step further and 

admired the beautiful textures of the clothes and Amrita went gaga 

over the mix and match of fabrics, crochet and beads.

The collection titled Blithe Panache presented 

lots of sheers, flowing fabrics with layers and asymmetrical hemlines, rubbing 

shoulders with body-hugging uppers. Flowy dresses, skirts and gowns and some stylised 

saris with halter blouses made up the diffusion line. Jewelled edges and waistlines 

embellished the prints graphic, abstracts as well as florals. Silk, chiffons, 

jerseys, nets and georgettes ensured the flow.

Go glocal

Earlier in the evening, Priyadarshini Rao presented 

a down-to-earth collection of higher pret. The inspiration green foliage, 

dark woods and pale blue skies found reflection in the palette made up 

of greens, blues, whites, beiges and browns. Trapeze dresses, bubble dresses, 

empire tunics, shift dresses, blousons as well as salwar kurtas formed the womens 

range, while the men sported casual shirts and long tunic shirts with belts.

A variety of pleats, from narrow to box, cutwork, 

and reverse appliques were the techniques used. Voiles, muls, organzas, 

linen and light silks were the fabrics. I have played around with the fabrics, 

mixing a lot of varieties. The idea was to marry Indian fabrics with global shapes, 

explained the designer.

A highlight of the day was Surily Goels show 

in the afternoon. The young designer of her Jaan-e-Mann had a surprise 

up her sleeves. No OTT (over the top) glamour this time as the designer set out 

to prove there was more to her than just Bollywood. 

Surilys first-row audience had a surprise element, 

too. While last season her show had a full house from Bollywood, this time starry 

footfalls were limited to Fardeen Khan, Sameera Reddy, Dino Morea, Neelam Kothari, 

Tara Sharma, Sonali Bendre and Suzanne Khan. On the ramp, Surily finished her 

show with a guest appearance by Rhea Pillai in a sizzling silver bubble dress. 

Surilys collection showed some serious fashion 

 bubble silhouettes in different colour stories. This time my collection 

is more chic and sophisticated as opposed to fun, said the designer. The 

jewel inspiration showed in the palette rubies, emeralds, opal greens, rose 

quartz. The collection divided into four sequences.

While Surily mixed knits with chiffons and georgettes, 

she kept embellishments to a minimum, except in the last sequence. The focus was 

on cuts and colour combinations. The silhouettes were restricted to dresses 

with bubble dresses far outnumbering every other shape and a few layered skirts 

with asymmetrical hemlines.

Day II had started with Calcuttas Abhishek Dutta 

debuting on the LFW ramp with a new Spring-Summer 2007 collection. Abhishek has 

a long way to go, but the collection was an impressive effort. Full marks for 

originality (his trademark use of leather) and effective stylisation.

The collection titled Immortality boasted Abhisheks 

signature textured and deconstructed look. Leather knits and patches, threadwork, 

sequins, applique, cutwork, smocking, pleating and rubber prints defined his collection. 

Skirts and dresses with balloon cuts, fishtail dresses, 

draped skirts, corsets, cropped jackets and saris formed the line. The colours 

were dull hues of pinks, purples, peaches, browns, greens, blues and more, while 

the fabrics used were knits, denims, textured cottons, nets, linen and georgettes.

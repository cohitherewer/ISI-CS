 You share your birthday with...

 John Travolta 

You are courageous and don?t give up easily. You never leave things undone. You are confident yet open to positive criticism. It is a better idea to confront people and clear the air, rather than remain in doubt. You are efficient, dutiful and responsible. You are cool and composed and it is difficult to instigate you. ? Kusum Bhandari

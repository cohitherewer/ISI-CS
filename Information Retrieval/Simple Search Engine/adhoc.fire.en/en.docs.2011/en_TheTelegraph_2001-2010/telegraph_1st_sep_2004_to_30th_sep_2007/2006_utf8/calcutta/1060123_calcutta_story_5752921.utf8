 Hope for youth denied rail job

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Raja Mitra, a physically challenged youth, had been knocking on the doors of the railway authorities with a plea that the appointment letter issued to him be honoured. All his appeals fell on deaf ears.

 A recent order of Calcutta High Court, however, has rekindled the hopes of this Baranagar resident, who suffers from hearing impairment. 

 Raja had been selected for a Group D post and handed an appointment letter by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on January 11, 2001. But the Chakradharpur division of the SER refused to let him join on the grounds that the rules regarding candidates with hearing impairment had since been changed. 

 Raja then appealed to the Central Administrative Tribunal, which directed the SER to allow him to join. But the railway moved the high court and obtained a stay on the tribunal order.

 The appeal has finally been rejected by a division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutt.

 ?We make it clear that the appointment of the respondent to a Group D post pursuant to the order of the tribunal will abide by the final order that may be passed in this writ petition,? the court stated, while disposing of the petition. ?We also make it clear that such appointments will not create any equity in favour of the respondent.?

 SER officials said they would study the court order before deciding on their course of action. 

 When Raja had applied for the job, candidates with 40 to 70 per cent hearing impairment were being considered for Group D posts. According to the certificate issued by RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Raja had 45 per cent hearing impairment.

 A subsequent medical test at SER?s Central Hospital, Garden Reach, revealed that he was suffering from 40 per cent impairment. Following a written test and an interview, he was empanelled under the handicapped quota. 

 After the railways denied him a job, Raja moved the central tribunal, which in January 2002 directed the authorities to consider his application. 

 Two years later, he filed a petition before the Calcutta bench of the tribunal. ?The rules applicable for the applicant are the rules that existed at the time of issue of the advertisement for vacancies,? the judges had observed in their order.

 Raja?s family, frustrated over the stalemate, is now seeing light again. ?We have fought a long battle and had given up hope. But the high court order has given us a fresh lease of life,? said A.K. Mitra, Raja?s father. 

 Mitra, who has retired from service, has spent the money he had saved for his daughter?s marriage on the case. He said his son, armed with the court order, will soon get in touch with the Chakradharpur division of the railways.

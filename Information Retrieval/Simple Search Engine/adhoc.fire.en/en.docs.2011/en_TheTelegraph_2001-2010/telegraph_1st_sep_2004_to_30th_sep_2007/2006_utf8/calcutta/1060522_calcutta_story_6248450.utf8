What: Retro night. 

Where: Venom in Fort Knox on Camac Street.

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: The Retro night on Friday flagged off a series of musical nights that will be hosted by Venom every alternate week.

 DJ Ivan from Bangalore was the guest at the console and he regaled the crowd with retro tracks. The crowd was a mix of some not-so-young party people who had a great time on the dance floor.

 Voiceover: We have decided to do a music theme night every other week, where we will get DJs down from other cities to play for the party people of Calcutta. This way we will expose our guests to various genres of music. Today we have a lot of old-timers who would earlier party at Anticlock and Winning Streak. We want to get them back on the dance floor, said Bunty Sethi of Venom.

 What: Winner of Hero Honda Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2005 Debojit at I lounge and bar.

 Where: The Metropolis at Hiland Park.

 When: Friday night.

 The bash: Assam boy Debojit Saha is now a busy man. Interviews, shows, albums, film assignments? Life has changed almost overnight for him after winning the song showdown on Zee TV.

 In town on Friday for the launch of his first album Debojit, his schedule was no different. After spending the day at the Power FM studio and then MusicWorld, the night found a charged-up Debojit descending on I, enthralling the audience with romantic tracks and popular hip-hop. The crowd, young and old, danced to his captivating renditions of Bheege honth, Kajra re and Jeena.

 Voiceover: I love being amidst people and entertaining them with my songs. After all, it is because of them that I have reached this position, smiled Debojit.

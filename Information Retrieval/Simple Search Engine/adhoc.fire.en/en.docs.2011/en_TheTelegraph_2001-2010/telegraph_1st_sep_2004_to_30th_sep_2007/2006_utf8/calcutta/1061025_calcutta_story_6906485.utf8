 Kali, Diwali and a wimp 

 - A BIGGER, LOUDER BLAST 

 PATRICK PRINGLE

 Fireworks on Guy Fawkes

 Theres a rather macabre ritual every November 5 in Britain, called Guy Fawkes. Every Guy Fawkes, Britons let off fireworks to celebrate the capture and gruesome execution of a Catholic who had plotted to blow up Parliament. 

 Charming! Eat your heart out, Guy Fawkes.

 Friends at home who had experienced Diwali compared it with Guy Fawkes. Only the fireworks are much bigger and louder than in the UK, they said. I assumed this postscript to be a throwaway Oh those crazy Indians and their festivals comment.

 It, in fact, turned out to be an understatement. Indeed, at some point on Saturday night, the city was somewhere between London on November 5 and Beirut circa 1982.

 A friend invited some of us to Salt Lake to let off some crackers. Some crackers turned out to be a veritable ammunition dump. It was, in fact, Diwali that showed me up for the wimp I am.

 Over a decades worth of horrific British public health warnings showing kids who have been hit by rockets has turned me into a pathetic wreck in the company of rockets. Uninhibited by visions of melting nylon tracksuits and scarred faces, my Indian friends were leaping all over the place, setting off fluorescent nuclear warheads.

 I was loitering somewhere at the back, but somehow managed to pluck up the courage to light a Swastika wheel and a couple of Roman candles, pretty daring by Pringle standards.

 The other event of the weekend was, of course, Kali puja. Superficially, it seemed a bit of a let down after the frenetic Durga puja.

 But my perspective was to change totally when I visited the pandals beneath Durgapur Bridge, near New Alipore. The Chamunda Kali pandal, with its enormous idol, beat anything Durga puja had to offer. 

 Another notable pandal nearby was one that featured seven visions of Kali, each depicted by children dressed as Kali and Shiva, sitting patiently as gaping visitors filed past. 

 It was as interesting to look at visitors faces as it was to look at the pandals. The look of absolute devotion on peoples faces struck me during the course of both pujas. 

 At school, I was forced to attend church twice a week for 10 years, and not once did I see anybody become so engaged with their faith as I have at the pandals. Religious festivals in India sharply remind me how tiny a minority is the secular West that I grew up in.

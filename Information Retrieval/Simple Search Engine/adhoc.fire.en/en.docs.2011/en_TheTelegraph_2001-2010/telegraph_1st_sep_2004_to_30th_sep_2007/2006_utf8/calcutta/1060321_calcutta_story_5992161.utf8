 New school nod in doubt

 - Clearance linked to silence on ICSE, CBSE questionnaire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The state government is planning to stop the process of issuing no-objection certificates to individuals and private agencies opening ICSE and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools. 

 The move is aimed at getting the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which gives affiliation to ICSE schools, and the CBSE to force all schools under them to respond to a questionnaire circulated some months ago.

 Under the present system, getting the government nod is a must for opening a new school affiliated to the ICSE or CBSE, so that certain norms are adhered to. 

 The ICSE as well as the CBSE are in favour of the certificate as they do not have the administrative machinery to carry out the task of monitoring adherence themselves.

 The government is unhappy at the reluctance on the part of the authorities of the 350-odd ICSE and CBSE schools to reply to the questionnaires sent to them.

 The questionnaires were handed out to the institutions as a part of the government?s drive to regulate functioning of ICSE and CBSE schools following complaints from guardians and teachers that a number of these institutions were offering education and facilities of a poor standard, despite charging high tuition fees.

 A 13-member committee, set up last year to find out ways of how the government could establish control over these institutions, had sent two reminders to the schools asking them to answer questions on their functioning, their infrastructure, laboratory facilities, size of classrooms, students? fees and teachers? salaries. Not a single school has replied to the questions so far.

 Government officers say it appears from the present situation that it becomes the ?liability? of only the state government to monitor the functioning of these schools.

 ?The state government has little control over the ICSE and CBSE schools, so it becomes pointless giving no-objection certificates to these schools,? said Ardhendu Sekhar Biswas, commissioner of school education and chairman of the 13-member committee.

 Education department officers will visit Delhi next month and discuss the issue with the ICSE and CBSE authorities.

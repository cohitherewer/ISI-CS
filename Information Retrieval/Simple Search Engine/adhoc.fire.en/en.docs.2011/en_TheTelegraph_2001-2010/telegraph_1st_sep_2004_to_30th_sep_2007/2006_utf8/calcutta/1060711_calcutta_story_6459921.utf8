 Restoring the green cover

 - Trees 

 for birds, Herbs for animals 

The state forest department, along with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and NGOs, have decided to set up shrub parks in different parts of the city to observe Afforestation Week.

 With an aim to provide stray animals and birds with a natural habitat and medicines, the first afforestation programme will be inaugurated by forest minister Ananta Roy on James Long Sarani on July 12. 

 Explaining the significance of such parks, mayoral council member (parks and gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan said the boulevard of James Long Sarani, stretching between Diamond Park and Taratala Road, will be turned into a shrub park, where medicinal plants for stray animals will be grown.

 According to the plan, he added, the forest department will plant medicinal shrubs and the park will be maintained by Love-n-Care, an NGO working for animals. 

 Besides, the NGO has also offered a seven-cottah plot near Shibrampur Bazaar, in Behala, for the plantation of medicinal plants for animals, deputy conservator of forests Somnath Mukherjee said. ?We are planning to set up more such parks in different pockets of the city. We hope more and more NGOs will step forward and take the responsibility of maintaining these parks,? said Mukherjee. 

 For the first time, the civic authorities have engaged the state forest department for planting trees on the roadside and other open spaces in the city. The department will also maintain the parks, for which the CMC will give Rs 15 lakh, Khan said. 

 The main objective behind the afforestation campaign is to restore the green cover of the city and to maintain the ecological balance. The CMC is stressing on planting fruit trees, so that birds and other animals get a natural habitat.

 ?If you have noticed, the twittering of birds has disappeared from the cityscape, though the number of roadside trees has gone up in the past few years. We need trees like guava and blackberry which can attract birds and animals,? said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan. 

 The trees which will be planted are hijal, aswath, pakur, neem, ritha and jarul, phalsa, kul, guava, blackberry, aanshphal and mango. The state forest department also plans to plant fruit saplings in Citizens Park and along the banks of canals in the city.

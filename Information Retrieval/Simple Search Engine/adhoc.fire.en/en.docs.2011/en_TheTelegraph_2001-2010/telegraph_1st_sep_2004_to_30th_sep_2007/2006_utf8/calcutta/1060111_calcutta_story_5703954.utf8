The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Due to lack of coordination between the Corporation and the police, illegal parking is rampant in many busy thoroughfares of the city. Those manning these illegal parking lots charge exorbitant amounts from car-owners and drivers, who are either unaware of the no-parking rule or knowingly ignore it. The passing vehicles and pedestrians are tremendously inconvenienced by this practice. On holidays and over weekends, the problem increases manifold. It?s high time the administration curb the menace of illegal parking.

 It takes around a week or more for post offices to get cheques issued by investors cleared from their respective head post offices. The investor stands to lose interest on the sum over this period. Similarly, post offices take more than seven days to issue cheques for redemption of investment. The postal authorities should speed up this process to maximise the investor?s gains.

 Traffic cops need to be trained to be sensitive to any sort of discrepancy that they come across on city streets. A stand pipe opposite Mahatma Gandhi Road Metro station has been leaking for months. Settlers have set up shanties in its vicinity and have free access to the water. The cops at the crossing never bother to report the matter to the Corporation staff so that the pipe can be sealed. 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat.

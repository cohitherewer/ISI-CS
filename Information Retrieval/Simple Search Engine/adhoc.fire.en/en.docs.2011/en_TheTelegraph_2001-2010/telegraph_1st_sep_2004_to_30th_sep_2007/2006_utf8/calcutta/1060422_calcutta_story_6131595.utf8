 Cross-cultural unity

 Following Tagore?s poetry, Tuntunir Galpo is finding favour with western opera, reports Reshmi Sengupta

 A moment from the opera Snatched by the Gods

 Weaving a Bengali weaver?s tale into the western opera format is no mean feat, especially when you have a host of white British children queuing up for the roles of the sly fox or other animals from Upendra Kishore Ray Chaudhuri?s Tuntunir Galpo.

 William Radice, writer-translator of Bengali language and literature, has written the libretto for this opera to be staged at the end of this year.

 This is not his first brush with such cross-cultural fusion of Bengali literature and the western opera. In the early Nineties, Radice had collaborated with composer Param Vir for a successful transposition of Tagore?s Debotar Grash on the European stage. Snatched by the Gods enthralled audiences across Europe, forcing a revival in the mid-Nineties, and has now entered the standard opera repertoire.

 From the East...

 Upendra Kishore?s Boka Jola Aar Sheyaler Galpo, translated as Chincha-Chancha Cooroo or The Weaver?s Wedding, has been commissioned by W11 in London. Having commissioned as many as 26 new operas, this theatre provides opportunities to young people from various backgrounds to get involved on stage.

 Chincha-Chancha is still in its nascent stages but it promises to be a novelty when the colourful story set in a Bengali village springs to life in the winter chill of London on December 9 and 10. It will premiere at Britten Theatre in Royal College of Music, with a cast comprising a bunch of nine to 18-year-olds.

 The opera has been set to music by Bernard Hughes, a promising British composer who has trained in classical music and has worked with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, among others. Hughes had quite a task in hand: forming an opera that combined the elements of a musical.

 ?The two genres are very different; one is serious, the other is light. The opera is sung all the way through, it has greater sophistication and originality. Musicals have dialogues; they are tuneful, accessible and very popular. And it?s difficult to bridge the gap between the two,? explains Radice, who has retained the Indian rhythm in his translation.

 ?I knew the Boka Jola story would make a wonderful opera the first time when I read it years ago and later suggested it to Bernard,? he recounts.

 Though Boka Jola has a typically Bengali flavour, Radice didn?t find it a handicap considering that fairytales have talking animals and fairly similar characters across all cultures.

 In serious western opera, stories have often been taken from exotic foreign sources, Radice points out. The Bengali names of the characters ? and the colourful village landscape ? have been retained in Chincha Chancha.

 The production is likely to include ?White British and Brown British children?, especially Bengalis who are training in Western classical music.

 ...To the West

 Snatched by the Gods is a chamber opera based on Rabindranath Tagore?s Debotar Grash, which was lapped up by the European audiences when it premiered in Amsterdam in the early Nineties. It travelled across Europe and was revived in 2003.

 The music for the opera was scored by Param Vir, an acclaimed London-based composer of Indian origin. It was performed as a double bill along with Broken Wings.

 On Radice?s suggestion, Param Vir read his translation of Debotar Grash and took an instant liking to the story set in a boat tossed on a turbulent river. 

 For an opera, Radice says one needs a story that really stirs the emotions. ?We were looking at the universal elements in a work, which are there in Debotar Grash. It explores superstitions and mob hysteria. It has a Hindu pilgrimage but the opera doesn?t need to depend on background knowledge,? he explains.

 The set is a dark swing that has been used to give the impression of a boat tossed on the waters. Director Pierre Audi kept the costumes vaguely Indian.

 ?With the story as the basic structure, Param Vir filled out the asterix portion with a musical interlude. When it starts again there?s a kind of lassitude. The story offers a wide range of voices, and hence great variety for the composer,? adds Radice.

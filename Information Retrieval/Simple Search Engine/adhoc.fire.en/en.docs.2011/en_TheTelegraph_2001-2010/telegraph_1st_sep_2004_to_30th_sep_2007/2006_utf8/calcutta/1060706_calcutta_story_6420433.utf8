 Zeroing in 

 on eclectic electronica

 MUSIC 

 ZONE

 Henry Binns (left) 

 and Sam Hardaker of the UK band Zero 7 

 Zero 7 is one of the hottest electronica 

 bands to emerge from the UK in recent times. At the core 

 are childhood friends and sound engineers Henry Binns and 

 Sam Hardaker who collaborated with vocalists like Mozez, 

 Sia Furler, Tina Dico and Sophie Barker for their first 

 two albums ? 2001s award-winning Simple Things 

 and 2004s follow-up When It Falls. 

 They have also remixed material 

 for Radiohead, Lenny Kravitz and Sneaker Pimps. Following 

 last months release of their latest album, The 

 Garden, Henry answered some questions over email to 

 Subhajit Banerjee about the bands journey so 

 far...

 Congratulations on the new 

 album. But what took The Garden so long?

 We were touring When It Falls 

 for quite a while, and then I moved to the countryside and 

 spent some time trying to find somewhere for a studio, and 

 then built it. 

 We wrote the bulk of it in about 

 six months, but then it took us a while to get it just how 

 we wanted IT, as the finished article. But it didnt 

 feel like that long, to be honest!

 Why are Mozez, Sophie and Tina, 

 who contributed vocals to some of your best-known songs, 

 missing from this album? Would they join you for the ongoing 

 UK tour?

 Theyre not gone forever. 

 This album just worked out the way it did. The music we 

 initially wrote just suited the musicians we ended up using. 

 Mozez, Sophie and Tina are not on tour with us at the moment, 

 but they may join us at some point in the future.

 How was it working with the 

 new vocalist Jose Gonzalez, who you hadnt met before 

 recording this album?

 I suppose we were all quite shy 

 and nervous at the beginning, because we didnt know 

 each other. But soon enough we all felt comfortable. 

 Jose is a very genuine and good 

 guy. And once we sat down to write the stuff, we all liked 

 what each other did and it just seemed to work.

 How did you approach the new 

 album? How different is the sound from the previous albums?

 Its quite hard to have a 

 perspective on ones own work, to say how it was the 

 same or different. I think my moving, and building the studio 

 ourselves definitely had an influence on the sound. It didnt 

 feel like I was going to work. 

 Sam came up and down from London 

 and we were in and out of the studio and the house. Different 

 musicians came and went, and it was all pretty relaxed.

 so, having less options at our 

 fingertips in terms of equipment and people made the process 

 simpler in a way. I think all those things can be heard 

 in the music somehow.

 The name Zero 7 is supposedly 

 from a Honduras nightclub. Is that true?

 Yes, but we didnt exactly 

 mean it to become our name. When we did our first remix 

 for Radiohead, we didnt have a name. Sam and I had 

 just come back from travelling in Mexico and Central America 

 and we had been to this place called Zero-Siete 

 in Honduras. It was a cool place, so we called our Climbing 

 Up the Walls remix the Zero-7 remix and it was what 

 we became known as.

 When did you and Sam decide 

 to make music together?

 We met when we were about 15; 

 we lived near each other. We both loved music and spent 

 a lot of time going to record shops and listening to stuff. 

 We both left school and decided to try sound engineering 

 college.

 Not long after that, another old 

 schoolmate Nigel Godrich (producer for Radiohead and, recently, 

 Paul McCartney) managed to help us get jobs as tea-boys 

 at a big studio where we learnt our trade. We made our own 

 music in our spare time. Then we got a break with the remix 

 and that started us off as a proper outfit!

 Who are your musical influences? 

 What kind of music do you listen to? 

 I have so many musical influences, 

 its hard to put them all down. But I suppose soul 

 music and hip-hop were big influences when we were teenagers.

 I love Ray Charles. I got into 

 folk music later, and Joni Mitchell is massive to me. 

 I like a lot of Sixties and Seventies 

 stuff, particularly Steely Dan, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, 

 and Brian Wilson. But Mozart and Schubert are up there, 

 too!

 How much do you rely on technology 

 to create music? 

 Everything is done in the studio 

 on various different electric pianos, guitars and other 

 gadgets and sounds we have. We use a program called Pro-Tools 

 on Macintosh computers and we have an old Seventies mixing 

 desk called Neve. 

 But no technology in the world 

 can write you a good tune. I always start making up my songs 

 sitting at the piano and then record the different parts 

 and instruments in the studio.

 What kind of an image do you 

 have of India? Do you plan to tour here?

 A very good friend of mine in 

 Spain, who is a widely travelled man, has a photomontage 

 on his kitchen wall of a trip he took to Varanasi. So I 

 always have those images in my mind when I think of India, 

 of the Ganges and the temples.

 Neither of us has ever visited 

 India, though we are huge fans of Indian cuisine and I cook 

 a few dishes myself. I would love to visit India, but the 

 touring is mostly organised by the record company.

 I didnt know anyone there 

 had ever heard of us. Would there be enough people who know 

 us to fill up a concert? If so, I would love to do one!

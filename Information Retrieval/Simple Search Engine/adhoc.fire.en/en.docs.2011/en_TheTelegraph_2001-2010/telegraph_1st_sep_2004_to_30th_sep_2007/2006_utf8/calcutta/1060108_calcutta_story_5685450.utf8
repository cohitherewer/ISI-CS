 Some of the city?s finest tandoori dishes could be savoured at this popular rendezvous, with the Tandoori Fish, Prawn Toasts and Chicken Tikka Kebabs being the standouts. Now, The Calcutta Punjab Club is gearing up to add an open food court to its F amp;B arsenal.

 ?We will do the outdoor food court on the 4,000 sq ft lawn, which now simply serves as a sit-out,? says club president Deepi Bahri. The multi-cuisine food court will have three counters, one catering strictly to vegetarians, plus an ice-cream parlour and an air-conditioned bar.

 ?The new bar will have a very contemporary setting and will be on the first floor, overlooking the lawn, which will be properly landscaped to add to the ambience,? adds Manish Arora, honorary secretary.

 Punjab Club already has the Golden Room run by Astor, Jharokha, which serves food from the club kitchen, the Maharaja Lounge and Regal Room, the new air-conditioned party room that can be used for banqueting by at least 70 people.

 Work on the outdoor food court will start in February, while the ground-floor bar is also being renovated to blend with the new surroundings. On a major upgrade spree, the Ballygunge Circular Road address plans to add a few more guestrooms to the existing set of 10.

 ?Besides, we are re-laying our tennis courts housed next to the South Club, where a new shamiana has also been put up. The possibility of adding squash and a skating rink on the tennis court premises is also being explored, subject to Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) approval,? says vice-president Sanjay Lamba.

 President Bahri says the club is planning to re-introduce the Bar Nite. Now every Friday is a musical night, while the Sunday afternoon tambola is also extremely popular. ?Unlike most other clubs, we don?t have a bar on children?s entry even after 7 pm, which makes it simpler for families using the club facilities,? stresses Bahri.

 Always a vibrant haunt of social and religious festivals, the club celebrates Lohri by creating the ambience of a Punjabi village with traditional folk songs, gidda, bhangra and a huge bonfire. Special gifts are given out to the newlywed and newborns. Valentines? Day, Holi and Baisakhi are also marked with great fanfare.

 ?In keeping with the changing times, we are also keen to break the mould and not just serve quintessential Punjabi food at the club like Tandoori Chicken and Masala Kulcha. Members and guests will be able to enjoy authentic Chinese and vegetarian fare, too. We have also launched a special health-food menu and it has been very well accepted,? declares Arora.

 The club is also tying up for reciprocal membership with more institutions in various cities from north to south India.

 ?We have lots of plans to make the club a more complete destination for members, and we know space is a constraint. Nonetheless, we will try to make the most of whatever resources we have,? the president promises.

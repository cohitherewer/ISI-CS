 Red pandas running through ice-coated mountains, or white-tailed eagles circling over the coast of Scotland ? it?s the call of the wild for nature enthusiasts next week.

 The 3rd Aranyak Wildlife Film Festival starts on January 27 for four days of films, seminars, slide shows and cultural performances, on the Nandan campus. 

 Extending the ambit of the festival, Aranyak, a forum of wildlife enthusiasts, has stocked up an eclectic mix of around 40 films and documentaries on conservation of the environment and wildlife . 

 The unveiling by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be followed by the inaugural film, Cherub of the Mist. Directed by Naresh Bedi, the documentary traces the endangered red panda, or the fire cat, living in the inaccessible Himalayas. 

 ?We have selected films that raise awareness and deal with real problems of man-nature conflicts,? said festival director Ashok Dasgupta.

 The package from abroad features critically-acclaimed films like With Beak and Claw, Eagle Odyssey, Predators at War, Elephants: Spy in the Herd and Cuba: Wild Island of the Caribbean. 

 From birds nestled in northern Poland to the near-extinct sea eagles of the UK, the mega-predators of Africa to a spy camera tracking the movements of wild elephants, the films provide a peek into the life of the wild beasts and birds. 

 ?Though the number of films is the same as last year, we have got better variety this time. There are entries from Cuba and Scotland, Germany and the UK,? said Suchetana, the chief minister?s daughter and a member of Aranyak.

 The screenings will be spread over the 1,000-seater Nandan I, Nandan II and Nandan III. 

 The films have been sourced from National Geographic, British Council, the French Embassy, Dreamworks Studio Universal, Children?s Film Society, Austria Broadcasting Company, and film festival packages from Delhi and Bristol. 

 ?We are highlighting Bengal this time through the slide shows and seminars? Making a wildlife film is a costly affair and there is also not much awareness. So, there aren?t too many Indian films on the subject,? rued Suchetana.

 The slide shows will dwell on the avi-fauna, wildlife conservation and lesser mammals of Bengal. The seminars, comprising wildlife activists and scientists as speakers, will focus on tigers of Bengal and Calcutta?s biodiversity. 

 As part of the programme, artistes from north Bengal and the Sunderbans will showcase traditional performances. Prize-winning works from Green Globe, the nature and wildlife photography competition hosted by Aranyak, will also be on display.

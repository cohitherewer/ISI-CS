 Flying Fish at the Nandikar theatre festival

 When German theatre director James Fuhrmann asked him to be part of a troupe that would tour India, Ashwat Bhatt was tempted by the possibilities it threw up ? to explore his roots that spread far and deep.

 In the all-German core group of Flying Fish, formed in Berlin on Fuhrmann?s initiative, Ashwat is the only non-White face. Before embarking on the countrywide tour, Flying Fish staged its adaptation of Oscar Wilde?s The Nightingale and the Rose at Nandikar?s 22nd National Theatre Festival in mid-December.

 Ashwat, who left his job of theatre instructor in Birmingham to join the troubadour troupe, is also engaged in researching the folk theatre of Kashmir. ?Our house in Kashmir was burnt down and my family and I lived on pavements for days,? recounts the 30-year-old, who admits having had a ?dark teenage? due to the violence.

 The family later shifted to Delhi where Ashwat studied theatre at National School of Drama and pursued a master?s degree from London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. His theatre stint in the UK also includes radio plays for the BBC.

 ?We lived through violence and hatred in Kashmir, and you tend to get carried away by it. But theatre helped me overcome my bitterness and gave me different perspectives. Or else I may have ended up as a fundamentalist,? says Flying Fish?s associate director.

 No wonder it?s in Saadat Hasan Manto?s writings that Ashwat finds resonances of his life. ?I went to Lahore, met Manto?s family and even lived with them for some time,? he says.

 The experiences have resulted in Ek Mulaquat Manto Se, a Hindi-Urdu solo that Ashwat has staged in India and the UK. He uses Manto?s articles that talk about himself, and about how the scenario changed in Pakistan.

 ?I was inspired by Manto?s Thanda Gosht... My aim is to propagate his works. His writings are something you don?t get in history books, something only a writer can give,? feels Ashwat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Chill still to bid adieu 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcuttans might not have to make the trip to the Book Fair in sapping heat, after all. According to the Met office, even though the minimum temperature soared to 17.7 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal, on Thursday, a cold spell is round the corner. 

 The coldest day this winter was January 10, when the mercury dipped to 11 degrees Celsius. ?The temperature steadily rose from January 15, following the development of an upper- air circulation over the coasts of Orissa, Bangladesh and north-west Bay of Bengal. The circulation caused a change in the wind pattern,? a Met official explained.

 He predicted a fall in temperature from Friday. ?We expect the mercury to drop to 15 or 16 degrees Celsius within the next 24 hours. Over the next two or three days, the minimum temperature should drop to about 14 degrees, which is normal around this time of the year,? the official said.

 The changed wind pattern has resulted in the blocking of the North Wind and flowing in of warm air from the Bay of Bengal, in the south.

 The dissipation of the cold-wave condition in the north-western part of the country has also contributed to the temperature rise.

 ?In Kashmir and Pakistan, there has been incursion of a lot of moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, leading to high levels of humidity, clouds and rainfall. This has increased the temperature there by four to six degrees Celsius on an average. The atmospheric temperature in north-west India,too, is not as low as it was,? stated another official.

 The good news for Calcuttans hoping for a longer winter is that the upper-air circulation and the wind pattern has shifted again from Thursday.

 ?We are now getting wind from the north-western part of the country, even though it is not very cold. We expect the minimum temperature to come down gradually,? added the Met official.

 However, there is little chance of the mercury dipping below 14 degrees Celsius. ?The temperature can decrease further only if another cold wave sweeps north India,? the official said.

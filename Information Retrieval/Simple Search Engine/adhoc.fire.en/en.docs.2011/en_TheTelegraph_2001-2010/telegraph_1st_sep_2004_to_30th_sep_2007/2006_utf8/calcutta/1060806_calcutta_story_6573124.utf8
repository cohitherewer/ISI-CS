 Superstar meets super model

 Pratim D. Gupta 

 Shah Rukh Khan plays 

 a junior artiste in Om Shanti Om; Deepika Padukone 

 is slated to make her screen debut in Farah Khans 

 second film 

 Sticking the spoon into some mishti 

 doi at the Eden Pavilion in ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton 

 amp; Towers, Farah Khan looks up, eyes twinkling. I 

 know what you are going to ask, she whispers, making 

 no effort to hide an impish smile.

 And the ace choreographer-turned-director, 

 in town for a day to judge the finals of the Derek Brien 

 talent hunt show on Sony Cadburys Bournvita Confidence 

 Champion, is right.

 Ever since Farahs much-talked-about 

 second film Happy New Year was scrapped (the official 

 statement: it couldnt be worked out), 

 she has stayed mum about her new project.

 The title: Om Shanti Om. 

 The bazaar buzz: Shah Rukh Khan plays Rishi Kapoor in Farah 

 Khans remake of Subhash Ghais 1980 blockbuster 

 Karz.

 But before one could pop the multi-crore 

 question after all it will be a King Khan production under 

 the Red Chillies banner Farah announces: My film 

 is not a remake of any old movie.

 But it does have Shah Rukh, playing 

 the role of a junior artiste in a story that spans three 

 decades. My first film Main Hoon Na was a tribute 

 to the movies of the 70s and 80s that I grew up watching. 

 Om Shanti Om is set in the 70s but it does come to 

 the modern times too, explains Farah.

 And who will be the star she 

 opposite Shah Rukh? No Rani, no Preity, Om Shanti Om 

 should be the Bollywood debut of ramp star Deepika Padukone.

 The daughter of badminton great 

 Prakash Padukone, who has been scorching fashion shows around 

 the country, was also slated to play SRKs leading 

 lady in Happy New Year. However, we havent 

 yet formally signed her (Deepika) for Om Shanti Om, 

 cautions Farah.

 There are changes in the crew, 

 though. If the music of Happy New Year was supposed 

 to be composed by Main Hoon Na music director Anu 

 Malik, Om Shanti Om will rock to the rhythm of A.R. 

 Rahman. I am off to Chennai from here to have a sitting 

 with him, says Farah. I totally loved (Rahmans) 

 Rang De Basanti.

 Farah intends to keep the promise 

 made to Indian Idol finalist Rahul Saxena and include 

 him for the soundtrack.

 She also cant get over the 

 music of her husband Shirish Kunders directorial debut 

 Jaan-e-Mann, composed by Anu Malik. Sonus 

 got some great songs there and they are really fabulous, 

 she gushes. The films shaped up really well 

 and should release during Diwali.

 But with less than a week to go 

 for Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, can anyone not ask Farah 

 about the KJo (Karan Johar for the non-Bolly buff) experience? 

 I just saw KANK last week and its a superb 

 film, she says. You will really identify with 

 the characters. Karan has made a wonderful film.

 KANK, of course, is punctuated 

 by Farahs moves, which will soon be mirrored in night 

 haunts across the country. Wheres the party 

 tonight was just like Its the time to disco 

 with the same feel and same setting, she recalls. 

 It has John Abraham in the song as a DJ while Rock 

 roll soniye has Kajol with Amitji 

 and Abhishek, reveals Farah.

 Amidst all her big-screen work, 

 Farahs taken up another small-screen assignment. She 

 will be judging the new dance show on Sony titled Jhalak 

 Dikhla Ja, the licensed adaptation of the BBC format 

 Strictly Come Dancing. Its just eight 

 episodes and will take very little of my time, she 

 says, almost conspiratorially.

 But the very little time she spent 

 in Calcutta was well spent, as she headed for an authentic 

 Chinese meal in Tangra. I have the full list 

 of restaurants with me, smiled the foodie in Farah.

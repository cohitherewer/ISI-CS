 Recline your seat 150 degrees with a flick of the remote, order from the munch menu on wireless, sip a single-malt in the exclusive lounge oh, and dont forget to catch your favourite film in club-class comfort.

 Get ready for the Pure Cinema experience as PVR finally gets its projectors rolling in Calcutta with an eight-screen, 2,000-seater multiplex on VIP Road in 2009.

 We know we are a late entrant in Calcutta, but we promise to make up for it with a complete cinema experience the city hasnt seen and felt till date, Pramod Arora, president, corporate strategy, PVR Ltd, tells Metro from Delhi. The group, which gave India its first multiplex, is targeting 50 to 60 screens in and around Calcutta in the next three years.

 The inaugural PVR plex is coming up in the 500,000-sq-ft retail-entertainment stop (at the long-defunct Eastern Paper Mills site) being developed as a 50:50 joint venture between Kshitij, the venture capital fund of the Future Group (formerly Pantaloon Retail), and the city-based builders consortium, the Diamond Group.

 The plex would include PVRs luxurious Gold Class and boutique programming. Gold Class is a super-deluxe format seating between 32 and 50 cinegoers for a show, with tickets priced at Rs 350-plus.

 Its the ultimate in cinema satisfaction, with personalised service that will make you feel at home, yet with five-star add-on comfort points. We will also redefine comfort levels in our standard section with more leg room and seat space, stresses Arora.

 PVR plex seating will have a minimum back-to-back clearance of 1,100 mm and centre-to-centre (arm-to-arm) width of 570 mm or more. 

 Be it the sound, the projection system or the fire-fighting sprinklers, all our technology conforms to the industry gold THX standards set by the George Lucas Labs. And Candy Bar, our F amp;B area, offers a wide range of sip-bite options, says Arora.

 The VIP Road film haunt will be designed by one of the groups pool of international architects Jestico Whiles of London, R amp;S of Los Angeles or Unik Architects of Scotland.

 Benoy Architects of the UK, which has designed Bluewater, Kent, Europes largest out-of-town shopping development, is in charge of the design of the VIP Road mall.

 The group plans to introduce its boutique-programming concept for niche audiences. For instance, there will be Senior Citizens cinema and film society windows for parallel and award-winning titles.

 Besides forking out Rs 35 crore for the land and shell, PVR Ltd will spend another Rs 15 to 20 crore on fit-outs and technology at the eight-screen cineplex.

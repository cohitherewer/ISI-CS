 Indra Lal Roy, whose death anniversary is on Thursday

 The 88th death anniversary of second lieutenant Indra Lal Roy will be observed on Thursday by the armed forces with due solemnity, for the first time. But who is this new-found Bengali war hero?

 Calcutta-born Roy, according the British War Archives, fought in World War I and was the only Indian flying ace to have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) by the British. ?Roy was a hero of World War I and the only Indian to receive the DFC,? stressed wing commander R.K. Das, spokesperson for the defence ministry, that dug out details with help from the British War Archives.

 Roy was born on December 2, 1898. His father?s name was PL Roy. The Roys lived at their ancestral house in Park Circus. Roy was only 16, studying in London?s St Paul?s School, when war broke out in Europe. He signed up for the Royal Flying Corps in April 1917.

 ?Roy was granted a commission as second lieutenant (general list) on July 5, 1917. Five days later, he moved to Vendome for flight training. After a stint at the Gunnery School in Turnberry, he joined No. 56 Squadron on October 30, 1917,? said an officer.

 Fighting for A Flight, led by Richard Maybery, Roy was injured when his SE5A (B567) plane crashed on December 6. He was then posted back to Farnborough on January 14, 1918. On July 27, 1918, Indra Lal Roy was killed in action when his plane went down in flames over Carvin, in northern France, during a dogfight.

 ?A very gallant and determined young officer, who in 13 days accounted for nine enemy machines. In these engagements, he displayed several remarkable skills and daring, on more than one occasion,? reads the DFC citation, Supplement to the London Gazette, September 21, 1918.

 After Roy?s death, his commanding officer wrote to his mother, Lalita, back in Calcutta: ?From the time he came to this squadron, his aim in life was to shoot down Huns and through his skill as a pilot, he succeeded in bringing down nine enemy machines? He was admired by all the men and officers in the Squadron??

 On Thursday, 88 years after Roy?s death, Fort William will salute a war hero, rediscovered.

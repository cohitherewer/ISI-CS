The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Life

 Girls wanna have fun

 What: MTV Lux Xnites.

 Where: Underground, at Hotel Hindustan International. 

 When: Friday night. 

 Star attraction: MTV VJs Nikhil and Rannvijay chatting and charming their way through a frenzied female following.

 E-quotient: The frolicking female party also boasted exotic nail art, hair braiding and a tattoo corner. The hottest attraction was to get clicked with only-too-happy-to-oblige Rannvijay (in picture by Pabitra Das). 

 The evening also saw funky messages by girls who divulged their X appeal on a cool graffiti wall. Johanne Mantosh and Precious emerged winners of an impromptu contest and bagged a dinner date with Rannvijay and Nikhil at Virgose.

 Voiceover: Its too good to be true ? playing host to so many women on their girls night out, smiled Rannvijay.

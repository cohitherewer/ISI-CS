 Car amok on Bypass

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manisha Chowdhury, 60, was killed and Gautam Das, 65, seriously injured after being hit by a car on EM Bypass on Wednesday afternoon. The Maruti Omni then broke through the railing around the island in front of Ruby General Hospital.

 The two were crossing the road when the car, coming from the north, hit them. The people waiting at a nearby bus stop took them to hospital.

 Chowdhury, a resident of Naktala, died soon after the collision, while Das is fighting for life at Ruby General Hospital. Traffic was disrupted for over half-an-hour on one flank of the Bypass as the cops struggled to tow away the car. The driver is absconding.

 Jan. date for library catalogue

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY 

 National Library will introduce machine-readable catalogues in January to help readers access book details online.

 The library has about three million books, magazines, journals, maps, and Indian and foreign documents. Efforts are on to include all of them in the catalogue. 

 From now, if you log on to www.nlindia.org, you can get the complete catalogue of titles available with us, said Sudhendu Mondal, director of National Library.

 Machine-readable catalogues were introduced by Library of Congress in Washington DC. It was named Marc 21. 

 Steps taken by National Library to implement machine-readable catalogues have been certified by Harish Chandra, librarian at IIT Chennai, and E. Rama Reddy, former librarian of Hyderabad Central University, both experts in the field.

 Mandal added the catalogue to be available in English and Bengali and other languages will be upgraded to global standards. Work is expected to be over in three to four years. Work on digitisation of books is in progress.

 Theatre, without doubt, is the most primeval form of collective cultural activity and a source of great entertainment. At present, however, with the growing popularity of other forms of amusement, it has lost its former glory. Aneek?s latest production, Dwitiyo Basanta, makes an attempt to contend this situation by carrying out a meaningful social discourse on the causes of its decline and to make it clear that theatre must inevitably resurrect itself for the benefit of society. The plot of the play is built around a commercial theatre hall, Janata Ranga Mancha. Stalwarts of yesteryears like Girish Ghosh, Ardhendu Mustafi, Sisir Bhaduri, as well as thespians of the contemporary era like Soumitra Chattopadhyay have performed here for the entertainment of theatre lovers. Yet, it now lies deserted and dilapidated. But theatre can have no death. As long as society exists, it will continue to overcome all odds and will rise like a phoenix from its own ashes to entertain, enlighten and edify the audience. Direction: Moloy Biswas.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Dwitiyo Basanta, produced by Aneek 

When: Today at 6.30 pm 

Where: Girish Mancha

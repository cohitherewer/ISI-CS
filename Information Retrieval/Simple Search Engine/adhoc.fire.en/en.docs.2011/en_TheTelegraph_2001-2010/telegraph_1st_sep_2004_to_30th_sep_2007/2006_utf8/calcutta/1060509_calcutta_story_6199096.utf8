 Mind the gap or go into Hooghly

 Jyoti Singh was lucky. Two launch hands had rushed to the rescue of the 17-year-old Howrah girl on Saturday. She fell into the river while gazing at its waters, leaning over the railing of Howrah bridge. 

 But thousands of people walking down the sidewalk of the city?s iconic bridge run the risk of dropping into the river water every day. 

 There are at least four points along the bridge?s southern sidewalk which are open, and if one slips, one plunges straight into the Hooghly. 

 Besides, there are several pillars whose iron covers at the base have given way, leaving a gap big enough for any child to slip through. 

 On a few stretches, the iron railing separating the main road of the bridge from the sidewalks on either side have gone missing, so that pedestrians run the risk of stepping on to the road, even if they do it inadvertently.

 ?On these stretches, we have to stand and ask pedestrians not to step on to the road. It?s difficult particularly at night, when the traffic moves at a high speed and hordes of people, particularly outsiders, walk into the city from Howrah station down the bridge,? said an officer of North Port police station. ?On how many points across the bridge can you keep an eye?? he added.

 On Monday, errant pedestrians stepped out on the thoroughfare at the points where the railing between the road and the pavements was missing. Two constables posted at the police outpost could not do much to tackle the hordes of people who walked either to Howrah station or from it. 

 A large number of people treaded past the openings that had appeared after the rails had given way. At a few places, the gaping holes ? between pillar numbers 7 and 8, and also between 20 and 21, for instance ? were partly covered with blocks of stone. At other points, they were gaping holes, through which one could see the river waters swirling underfoot.

 Some people who regularly walk down the stretch seem to be aware of the death trap but could not care less. It?s a small price that you pay for enjoying the refreshing breeze of the Hooghly, they say with a smile. 

 ?Don?t look for those holes. Just stand here at any time of the day and feel the cool breeze. It?s is so refreshing after a hard day?s work,? said Arup Saha, a flower-dealer who had come all the way from Behala to buy his stock from the Mullickghat flower market.

 But the police are worried. The North Port police have already shot off letters to the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), informing them of the condition of the bridge and are awaiting a reply. 

 ?Maintenance of the bridge is not our job. We have informed the CPT and they are aware of it,? said Ajay Ranade, deputy commissioner (port).

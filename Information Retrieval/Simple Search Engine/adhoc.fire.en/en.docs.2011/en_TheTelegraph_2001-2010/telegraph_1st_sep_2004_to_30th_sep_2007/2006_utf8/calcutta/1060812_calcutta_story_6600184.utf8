 Unions sit for amity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The two students unions at Bengal Engineering and Science University (BESU) sat together on Thursday night to draw up a peace roadmap for the violence-scarred Shibpur campus.

 The condition of third-year electrical engineering student Soumik Basu, the latest victim of campus violence that had been raging since the students union elections in July last year, continued to be critical on Friday. He fell off the second floor of a hostel on Wednesday and suffered severe injury to the brain.

 The peace meeting between the Independent Consolidation (IC)-backed BE College Students Union and the SFI-backed PG Students Union took place in the presence of registrar Indranath Sinha and teacher-in-charge Col A.K. Ghosh.

 The unions resolved not to disrupt the peace on campus, promote amity among the students and keep politics away.

 Sinha said: The representatives of both the unions met last night and they agreed, after a prolonged discussion, to promote amity among the students and bring back a congenial atmosphere on campus The students are in a state of shock following Soumiks mishap.

 IC spokesperson Kaustav Banerjee, however, alleged that the PG Students Union was vitiating the campus atmosphere by distributing leaflets that blamed IC activists for pushing Soumik off the second floor.

 We are trying to restore peace on campus, but the PG Students Union is not cooperating with us, he alleged.

 The IC has forwarded a proposal to depoliticise the union. There will be only one forum to represent the students. Class representatives will be elected by a democratic process and they will constitute the students representative body. The general secretary and other office-bearers will be nominated on the basis of their experience and expertise, Banerjee said.

 While undergraduate students are unanimously backing the proposal, the PG Students Union is not receptive to it, he claimed.

 The university has asked the students to work out a consensus on the issue by November, when the next students union elections are due.

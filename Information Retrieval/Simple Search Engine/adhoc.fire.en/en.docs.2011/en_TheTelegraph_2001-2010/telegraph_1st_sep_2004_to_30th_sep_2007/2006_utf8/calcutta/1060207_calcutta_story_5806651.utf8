 The richness of burgundy

 - On exhibition, Amal Ghosh?s transparent watercolours

 SOUMITRA DAS

 It is difficult for an artist to transfer the sensuous experience of looking at colours on either paper or canvas with the help of brushes and pigments. This task becomes even more complex when the artist decides to contemplate the various tones of a single colour without allowing oneself the indulgence of juxtapositions and contrasts with shades at the opposite end of the spectrum.

 Amal Ghosh has done exactly that in some of his works, now on display at Galerie 88. His task has been rendered even more difficult by the medium that he has chosen to work with ? transparent watercolour, which few artists care to touch these days because it demands hours of painstaking work that leaves no room for committing errors. Once a ?wash? has dried up too early, the more an artist scrubs the surface to conceal it, the more flawed it appears.

 Ghosh, in his early 70s, was trained as an artist in Calcutta, and had made a name for himself as a teacher in reputable art institutions in the UK, and is known for the high quality of public commissions where he used vitreous enamel and stained glass. 

 Local viewers may connect watercolour with Abanindranath and the Bengal School. But as they will be quick to discover, Ghosh?s paintings are neither anaemic nor sentimental. They are glowing and full-bodied entities ? a quality he achieved by applying, at times, manifold layers of paint. His best paintings explore the possibilities of working with a red that has the richness of burgundy or fresh blood, the darker and more sombre shades standing out against the tongues of flame flickering in their depths. It is something akin to watching the dance of light on stained glass.

 Ghosh has executed them over the past 20 years and he does not create more than three to six every year. By the standards of watercolour, they are rather large and, thus, make a forceful impact on viewers.

 In some others, green, yellow, blue and orange and other shades of the rainbow glimmer through washes of red, creating forms akin to trees, human beings or streamers. In a particular work awash with a lovely sap green, a finger of light burns within. These works that carry suggestions of forms without making any clear statement, are visually more engaging than the more recent ones, where faces and figures are more obviously delineated.

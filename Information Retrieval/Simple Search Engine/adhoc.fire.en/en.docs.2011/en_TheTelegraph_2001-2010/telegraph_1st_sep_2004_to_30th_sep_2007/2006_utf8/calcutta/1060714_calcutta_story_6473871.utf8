 THOUGHT FOR FOOD

 What: More Colour, More Flavour, More South India.

 Where: Tamarind at 64, Sarat Bose Road.

 When: Till July 24.

 Take a look: The popular southern speciality restaurant 

 is celebrating its second anniversary with a host of additions 

 to its existing menu. Venturing beyond the restaurant, Tamarind 

 will provide outdoor catering, organise theme parties, toss 

 up corporate lunches and host special events to make a song 

 and dance about south India. 

 There are also plans of tie-ups 

 with tourism firms for packaged tours down south. At the 

 restaurant, there will be a library of coffee-table books, 

 CDs, VCDs and merchandise of packaged sweets, savouries 

 and souvenirs from south India.

 The restaurant near Puddapukur 

 is hosting a special buffet for 10 days and recreating the 

 ambience of south India through various elements. Flower 

 decorations adorn the place and a counter for coffee and 

 south Indian products like soap, spices and snacks has been 

 set up near the entrance.

 Bharatanatyam, Mohiniattam and 

 Kathakali dancers liven up the atmosphere while a temple 

 priest, a fisherman and a coconut vendor add authenticity. 

 A masquerade of popular south 

 Indian stars like Rajnikanth and Prabhudeva pep up proceedings. 

 Two faces you cant afford to miss are Rahul Dravid 

 and the ghost of Veerappan.

 The spread: The special buffet comprises a welcome drink, 

 followed by three vegetarian and three non-vegetarian dishes. 

 In the vegetarian section, you can order a Kofta Curry, 

 a paneer dish and a mixed vegetable dish. 

 You can find a range of choices 

 in fish, chicken, mutton, shrimps and crabs in the non-vegetarian 

 section.

 Enjoy the dishes with flavoured 

 rice (could be tamarind, coriander or lemon), paratha 

 and appam. End on a sweet note with desserts like 

 payasam or shahi tukra. The buffet is available 

 for both lunch and dinner.

 Pocket pinch: The buffet costs Rs 250 per head, inclusive 

 of taxes.

 Voiceover: We wanted to thank our patrons for 

 their continuous support over the past two years. This is 

 the most appropriate opportunity to go beyond the limitations 

 of a restaurant and give them something extra, says 

 Gautam Purakayastha, co-owner of Tamarind.

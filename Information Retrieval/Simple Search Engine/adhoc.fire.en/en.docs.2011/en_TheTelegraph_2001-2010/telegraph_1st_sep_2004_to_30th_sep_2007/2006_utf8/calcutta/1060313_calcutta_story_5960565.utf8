 Bill break-up to dispel doubt

 Subhodyuti Datta: We often receive exorbitant bills. Is there any way we can verify our telephone bills?

 Our billing system is transparent and there is no hidden charge in our schemes. If you have any doubt regarding the bill amount, you can readily get the details of the bill by applying to the accounts officer telecom revenue in your area or to the deputy general manager telecom revenue. Besides, we have opened customer service centres connected by a network.

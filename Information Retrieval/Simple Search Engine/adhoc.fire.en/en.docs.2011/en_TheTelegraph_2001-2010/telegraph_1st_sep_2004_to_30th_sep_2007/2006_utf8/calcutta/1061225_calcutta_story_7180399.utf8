The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Silt in pipes, trickle in taps

 HARD TALK - Santoshpur

 Subrata dasgupta, CPM councillor of ward number 103, met readers of The Telegraph and answered their queries. 

Participants included Tanusree Roy, Ruma Saha, Biren Gupta, Sumita Roy, Swapan Karmakar, Sandeep Banerjee, Subinoy Samaddar, Swadesh Karmakar, Goutam Neogi and Kaberi Ghosh.

Tanusree Roy: Earlier, you had assured us that with the commissioning of the Garfa booster station, the water crisis in our area will be eased to a great extent. But unfortunately, the problem still persists. In the Shantipath area, the water supply is irregular and the pressure is very low. Have you taken any steps to resolve the problem?

 I admit that I had assured you about solving the water problem in your area. I had hoped to do so. But after the commissioning of the booster station, we have found out that without changing the old and silted pipes in the distribution network, supply cannot be normalised.

 Before the setting up of booster station, deep tubewells were the main source of potable water. Owing to that, the network is choked and silted. A three-inch-diameter pipe is now a little over one inch due to extensive sedimentation. This obstructs the water flow.

 We are planning to relay all the pipes in the network. In some areas, new six-inch and four-inch-diameter PVC pipes have already been laid. Hence, people living in Nilachal, Bidhan Colony and Rajapur are getting better supply. We had decided to take up rest of the work. But it has been delayed due to the setting up of the new water supply department. I am hoping that by May-June, a direct pipeline from Avenue South to Shantipath will be ready.

 Tanusree Roy: But why is the water supply to my house erratic when in my neighbourhood, it is normal? Also, the water supplied to me is comparatively dirty. 

 Water pressure may vary from one house to another in a same locality due to several localised reasons. It can be due to a leak or choked pipes in the household. 

 Also, the height of the water pipes makes a lot of difference. If the connection is at a level higher than in your neighbourhood, water pressure to your house will certainly drop. 

Ruma Saha: After a heavy shower, waterlogging is a common feature in the South Road and Trikon Park areas. But the problem is aggravating with time. Can you brief us about the situation during the monsoon next year? Are you taking some steps to ease the problem?

 I am hopeful that next years rainy season will be the last season of your suffering. The project of revamping the drainage system is on and is funded by the Asian Development Bank and Calcutta Environment Improvement Project.

 I must remind you that we are responsible for these sufferings in our neighbourhood. At present, we are suffering because our parents or their parents had dumped solid waste in the TP channel. 

 It is also possible that the drains were not regularly desilted. The civic body may not have taken proper steps. Recently, after a severe waterlogging in this area, we scooped out 100 kg of plastic bags, wafer packets, cups and gutka packets. 

 Therefore, waterlogging is not uncommon or a new phenomenon in this area. There are over 40 box drains in the area but owing to continuous deposition of solid waste, the bed of the TP Channel is silted. 

 Besides, there are several housing projects in wards 102, 103 and 109. They have their own water pumping arrangements. When after a heavy shower, backflow takes place in the box drains, these housing estates add extra load on the TP Channel, further worsening the situation. 

Kaberi Ghosh: The cleaning and beautification scheme of Taltala pond is being carried out in a half-hearted manner. As a result, the water in the pond is contaminated and people who regularly use it for bathing and washing utensils are prone to skin diseases and stomach disorders. 

 I feel the residents in the Taltala area should come forward to preserve the pond. 

 You must be aware that land sharks have been eyeing it for a very long time. Already, some buildings have come up on a part of the waterbody, which was filled up by the contractors. 

 However, they could not fill up the entire pond.We have spent nearly Rs 1 lakh to preserve the pond. But local residents are still dumping plastic bags in the waterbody. These practices must be stopped first.

 I have plans to widen the pond next year. Regarding the quality of water, I think it will be better after the pond is filled up with rainwater next monsoon.

To be concluded

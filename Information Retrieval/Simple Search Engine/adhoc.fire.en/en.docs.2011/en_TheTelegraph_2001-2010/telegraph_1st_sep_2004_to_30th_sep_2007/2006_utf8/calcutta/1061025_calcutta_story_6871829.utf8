 Tress stylist Sabina 

 Yah snips up five sizzling styles for the coming winter months

 Animal metamorphosis, plant kingdom, 

 sizzling Seventies, Charlies Angels Such influences 

 combined with loads of style, sensuality, funk, femininity 

 and an easy-maintenance mantra. That, in a nutshell, describes 

 the autumn-winter tress tale.

 As hair expert and proprietor 

 of Sunflower Sabina Yah puts it: Winter is the time 

 to play around with your hair, unlike summers when you prefer 

 tying it up. Styles this season have adopted nature aspects. 

 The Seventies is also happening. And the cuts are strictly 

 wash-and-go.

 Bob is back with a bang and even 

 Victoria Beckham seems to be making a statement with one. 

 Shattered, classic, funky, graduated bob your hair the 

 way you like it best. The pixie look with its retro feel 

 is going great guns too. Short and close to the scalp, 

 it has a bed-head feel to it, adds Sabina.

 The colour story, in sync with 

 the winter festive season, could be bright. Warm reds, warm 

 coppers, khaki and ash are the ones to watch out for. The 

 adventurous can go for blues, magenta pinks and violets. 

 Try two tones, low lights (surface lighter and inner 

 panels darker) and ash reflect colour effects, offers 

 Sabina.

 The hair expert demonstrates, 

 for GoodLife, five styles for the season ahead.

Graduated bob

 1) Sabina recommends the graduated 

 bob for the 30-plus woman, a cut that renders a youthful 

 look. She has demonstrated the look on Pratiti 

 Sarkar of CIMA Gallery.

 Short at the back, this 

 cut has one side cropped close to the ear, while the other 

 is kept long enough to frame the face.

 Magenta red on the top with the 

 ends left black complete this look.

 Pixie charm

 2) The pixie look is apt for anybody 

 who wants to stand out from the rest. A combination 

 of curls and straight fringes makes for a super sexy makeover, 

 sported by Maithreyi Radhakrishnan.

 The crown has curls and the undercut, 

 near the nape, is overgrown. The fringes and bangs framing 

 the face are re-bonded straight.

 For a more striking effect, Sabina 

 suggests blue highlights.

 This style is right for 

 small and slender facial structures and sharp features, 

 she adds.

Feathered layers

 3) If long locks are more your 

 style, the Farrah Fawcett look (of the 1976 

 television serial Charlies Angels) is an option 

 for you. The look here is sported by Tania Khare.

 Fawcetts shaggy, feathered 

 layers still havent lost their impact. It is the flavour 

 of the season, feels Sabina.

 The ends are cut into different 

 sections, flicked out to keep it away from the face, 

 explains the tress stylist. Touched up with blonde highlights 

 and an overall chestnut hue, the look is a sure hit.

 This ones best avoided 

 by women above 50 years, cautions Sabina.

 Textured razor

 4) The other option for those 

 wanting to keep it long is a regular textured razor cut, 

 flaunted by designer Bhavna Jhingan.

 The parting is low. Separation 

 and less weight at the ends allow the hair to flick out 

 easily, making for a look sober yet funky. A tint 

 of ash bordering the fringe and inside panels jazzes it 

 up further. The base can be varied black, brown or blonde.

 This is suitable for any 

 age group and facial structure, says Sabina.

 Woven hues

 5) If you are not ready to experiment 

 with cuts this season, go all out with colours. A simple 

 forward graduation cut that doesnt tamper with the 

 length. Brighten it with blended highlights. You can blend 

 blonde and khaki panels for a stunning woven effect. This 

 look has been displayed on Zeba Chopra.

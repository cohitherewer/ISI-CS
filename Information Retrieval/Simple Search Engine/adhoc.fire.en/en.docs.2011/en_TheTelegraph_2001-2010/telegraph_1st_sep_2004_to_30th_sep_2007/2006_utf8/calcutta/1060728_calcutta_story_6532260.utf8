 When the different spheres of the creative arts interact and coalesce, a spontaneous medium of artistic expression is born; one that reaches out to the audience, evoking instinctive, spirited responses. Hosted by Picasso, Triveni presents a unique confluence of music, poetry and theatre, offering an alternative perspective on love, death and divinity. Featuring readings from Joy Goswami?s poems, Bratya Basu?s plays and alaaps by veteran classical vocalist Ulhas Kashalkar, it aims to build a platform for innovative performance concepts like this one. Basu will reads excerpts from his plays including Ashaleen, Babli, Mrityu, Ishwar, Jaunota and the yet-to-be staged Dorjiparar Marjinara. This will be combined with passages from Goswami?s selections, Surjopara Chhaee, Ma Nishaad, Hariner Janyo Ekak and E Bhoomi, and Kashalkar?s alaaps. Strung on experiences and beliefs, these nuggets of tunes, verses and dialogues draw unexpected parallels among the three most intriguing subjects of human thought.

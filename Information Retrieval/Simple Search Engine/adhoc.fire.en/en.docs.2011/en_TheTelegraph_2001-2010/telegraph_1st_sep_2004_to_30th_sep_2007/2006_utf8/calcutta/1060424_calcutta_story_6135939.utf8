The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Vans, stalls to replace kiosks

 SUKHENDU CHAKRABORTY, joint director of fisheries, met readers of The Telegraph on Friday to answer their questions. Participants included Koushik Mitra, Sanchita Biswas, Kajal Bose, Asim Majumdar, Subhadyuti Datta, K. Roy Chaudhury, Jaydip Majumdar, Saikat Ghosh, Tapan Talukdar and Biren Shau

Asim Majumdar: Why have the sales kiosks of the fisheries department been shut down?

 Fish and value-added fish products are marketed by Benfish. Licences were given to people to sell Benfish products from kiosks. Since the kiosks were not being run properly, Benfish introduced sales vans. Besides, the fisheries development corporation has started to set up stalls in different pockets of the city.

Sanchita Biswas: What?s the reason behind the recent shortage of fish in the markets? When will the fish prices come down?

 I admit there is a shortage in supply of various types of fish, but I don?t think the average market price has gone up much as a result. While the price of meat is Rs 170-Rs 180 per kg, kata pona is available at Rs 80 per kg. Good quality katla can be bought for Rs 140 a kg. The fish prices will fall by September, when the local fish will start entering the market.

 An upward revision of price and a downward revision in variety is common between March and May. Supply of marine fishes does not reach the market during this period as there is a bar on sea fishing till May 31. The supply of sweet water fishes also goes down during this phase as the fishermen prepare the ponds for the release of seeds. 

Subhadyuti Datta: What steps have you taken to stop indiscriminate fishing of small hilsa or khoka ilish?

 A government order banning the sale of small hilsa in the wholesale market is imminent. It will be issued soon after the election. The licence of the wholesellers will be cancelled if they are caught selling hilsa below a certain size. The fisheries department has decided to impose a ban on the use of gill net to catch small hilsa.

Kajal Bose: The fisheries department claims that the state is the leader in terms of production of fish seed and fingerlings. Are we self-sufficient in fish production?

 The total demand for fish in West Bengal is 1.3 million metric tonne (MT). In addition to the supply of marine fish, Andhra Pradesh supplies around 80,000 MT of sweet water fish per year. There is still an annual shortfall of 6,000 MT.

 Bengal, indeed, tops the list in respect of production of fish seed and fingerlings. We produce 12,500 million fish seeds a year. Half of the produce goes to Andhra Pradesh.

Saikat Ghosh: Is it true that fishery owners on East Calcutta Wetlands are forced to take out the fishes before they reach their full size, fearing sabotage with pesticide?

 Fish worth Rs 15 crore is destroyed annually due to sabotage. But it is not the only reason we seldom get local fish more than 2 kg in size. The main reason is that there aren?t many big tanks in the state. 

Tapan Talukdar: What steps have you taken to prevent such crimes? 

 A family feud or enmity leads to pouring of pesticide in the pond. It is hard to pinpoint an offender. Since the motive behind such action is to inflict financial damage, we have decided to introduce an insurance policy for the fishery owners. The fisheries department will take the responsibility of assessing the damage in case of sabotage.

K. Roy Chaudhury: Is the culture of nylontika and African magur banned here? If so, why?

 Yes. African magur and nylontika eat up other fishes in a waterbody. 

Tapan Talukdar: Why are we dependent on Andhra Pradesh for our daily requirement of fish? 

 There are two reasons. Firstly, there are several large tanks to grow fishes in Andhra Pradesh. The other reason is people of Andhra do not prefer pond fishes.

Biren Shau: Use of poisonous red colour on pabda and yellow colour on Topsey have been rampant in the markets. What are you doing?

 The vendors use colour to make the fishes look fresh. My department has no control on the vendors. It is the civic authority?s responsibility to crack down on such practices.

Jaydip Majumdar: Why is there a spate in the pabda supply? Are the fishes coming from Bangladesh?

 No. Successful artificial breeding of the variety by the fisheries department has resulted in the supply glut. We have set up Pabda hatcheries in a couple of districts.

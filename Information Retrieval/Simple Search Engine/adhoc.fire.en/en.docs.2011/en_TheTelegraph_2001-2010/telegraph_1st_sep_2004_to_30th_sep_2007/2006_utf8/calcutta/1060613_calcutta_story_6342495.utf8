 Devotion, perseverance and commitment to her art have made Aruna Mohanty perhaps the finest among Odissi dancers of her generation. Her grooming in the sculptured manifestations of this form of dance has endowed her with graceful movements, sculpturesque postures, captivating expressions and an exquisite style, culminating in a magnificent visual experience. This evening, she presents, along with selected participants of her recently concluded workshop, some compositions from her creative repertoire. Workshop participants will present Mangalacharan ? Siva stutee Nagendra Haraya Trilochanaya and Abhinaya ? Devi vandana of Goddess Durga. Guest teachers, Janhabi Behera and Bijay Kumar Sahoo, will present Pallavi, in raga Ragesree.

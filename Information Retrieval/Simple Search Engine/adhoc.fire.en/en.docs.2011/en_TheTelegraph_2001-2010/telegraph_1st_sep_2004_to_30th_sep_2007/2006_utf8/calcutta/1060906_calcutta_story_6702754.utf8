 Revised rule for LPG refill

 Booking for a refill of a cooking gas cylinder can only be made 21 days after its delivery, the oil companies have decided.

 We are producing and supplying an adequate amount of cooking gas. This rule has been framed to check diversion of LPG cylinders. One cylinder is enough for a family of four or five for 20 to 25 days. So, no consumer should be worried about the rule. The cylinder will be supplied within two days of booking, said A.C. De, deputy general manager of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which is the coordinator of the oil companies.

 In case of an emergency or if a family needs a cylinder refill within 21 days, it must apply to the dealer concerned in writing and the cylinder will be supplied, added De.

 According to IOC officials, most of the 3.5 million cooking gas consumers in and around the city have double cylinder connections. The consumers book for a refill as soon as one cylinder is exhausted. Thus, in most kitchens, one cylinder remains virtually unutilised, an official reasoned.

 As LPG is available on demand, consumers with double cylinder connections need not book for a refill immediately after using up a cylinder. We feel there will not be a problem in getting a refill three weeks after the receipt of the first cylinder, he explained.

 The move is aimed at preventing illegal sale of LPG cylinders to restaurants, roadside eateries and tea stalls. The oil firms have received complaints that cylinders shown as supplied to consumers in registers are being diverted to commercial establishments.

 Cooking gas is subsidised and hence, meant only for domestic use. Commercial LPG cylinders are available for restaurants and food shops.

 At least 15 per cent of the cooking gas cylinders are diverted every month, creating a supply crisis. We want to stop this. Our inspectors will pay surprise visits to offices of dealers and check the booking and delivery register. We will take immediate action if any discrepancy is found. We will also organise camps for interaction between consumers and dealers, said the IOC deputy general manager.

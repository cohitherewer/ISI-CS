 Melange, the newest coffee lounge in the city, can trace its seeds way back to 1999 in Melbourne, where its proprietor Naveen Pai enjoyed a stint at Caf? Grecos after college.

 Hours dedicated to Friends, trying to capture the real feel of the Manhattan coffee shop Central Perk. Years dedicated to understanding the growing needs of a growing coffee population. All adding up to Melange, Naveens latest offering to the city after a string of Coffee Pai outlets.

 The super six combo of Joey, Rachel, Monica, Ross, Chandler and Phoebe cherishing lifes moments, set against a backdrop of Central Perk night or day, has always inspired me. The inspiration finally takes shape here, says Naveen. 

 Housed at H-18 Nalini Ranjan Avenue, near New Alipore triangular park, Melange is true to its name in every possible aspect ? from the interiors to the menu to the music. 

 Targeted clearly at the 25-plus crowd, Melange, in its English-style lounge-like decor, is proud to be different from the other noisy and cheerful coffee shops in Calcutta.

 The look

 The 1,000 sq ft ground floor area of an old Bengali home has been cleverly crafted into four distinct spaces. The idea was to create adjacent lounges of different characters under one roof. These are then visually integrated with cut-outs and transitional decor elements, says Vivek Rathore, interior designer of Melange.

 A journey through Melange goes like this: the initial introduction takes place in a step in zone, based on the colour theory of Yin and Yang, the strong linear black and white stripes on the floor setting the overall pace; next up is a brown and amber plush lounge meant to be an extrovert family dining area this leads to another, slightly more casual lounge, overlooking a lily pool, all very Mediterranean. 

 There is provision for a projection screen to add to the existing World Cup cheer in the city, says Vivek.

 The highlight

 The real high point of Melange is, however, a shisha (hookah) lounge that serves 15 single flavours like mint, cherry, lemon and chocolate along with 20 combo flavours like the Melange Special (any combo of your choice) and Hawaiian Ecstasy (combines pineapple, green apple and cherry). The single flavours come for Rs 175 (half an hour), while the combo is priced at Rs 200. 

 An ultra violet lighting option alternates with blue tints and warm, diffused lighting, just to create the right mood, explains Vivek.

 A full-fledged merchandising window, part of each lounges display, will soon boast a wide range of art, sculpture, posters, lighters and other cigarette accessories. 

 The fare

 Bits of Mediterranean, bits of Indian, throw in some Lebanese and some more Thai ? very Melange indeed.

 We didnt want to serve any authentic cuisine. This is our own format of food, each dish is very light in nature but its a big platter-style meal, says Naveen. 

 The hot coffees are priced between Rs 25 and Rs 45, while the cold coffees come for Rs 55-65.With other beverages in the pipeline, there is also a live kitchen that plans to throw itself open to guests soon.

 The favourites on the menu right now are the Dip Platter that serves hummus, Babaganouj and Tzatziki with pita bread and olives.

 so try the Pesto marinated Paneer Espetada, Golden Fried Crusted Prawn with Thai sweet chilly dip.

 Melange also has an extensive salad menu and a sandwich bar that offers a choice of white, brown or French, and plain, grilled or toasted bread.

 In the main course, try the Whole-baked Aubergine with Whole Corn, Tomato and Mozzarella or one of the Frittatas (Italian-style flat omelette). 

 Sweet temptations comprise warm Fudgy Mudcake with vanilla, Apple Samosas and Fresh Fruit Cheesecake. The food items are priced at Rs 35-plus and a meal for two costs around Rs 300.

 The musical mood beats it all. A mismatch of everything from country to lounge, signs off Naveen.

 Melange opens its doors officially on Monday, from 2 pm till midnight.

 They have the time to spare, are physically fit and possess experience worth a lifetime. Yet, post-retirement, most elderly people have little to do to occupy their time.

 An ?unretirement? workshop plans to change that.

 ?After retirement, loneliness is the biggest problem faced by senior citizens. This workshop would encourage them to pursue a hobby or a passion and make a second career out of it,? said Sarla Totla of Dignity Foundation, Calcutta chapter. 

 The workshop will be conducted by ?brand coach? Sumit Roy on June 9 at the foundation?s new day-care centre in Dhakuria. 

 Roy coaches entrepreneurs and managers in MNCs to grow their career. 

 ?This will be our first workshop in Calcutta. We have received a great response from similar workshops conducted in Mumbai,? Totla said.

 The foundation, with ?productive ageing? as its motto, hopes the workshop will enable senior citizens to answer with pride a question they usually dread ? ?what are you doing these days??

 At the half-a-day interactive workshop, participants will be encouraged to pursue a hobby and ?create a blueprint? to turn it into a career. 

 ?For instance, someone with an interest in music can open a shop of musical instruments. In Mumbai, we had a couple interested in cooking start a dabba service, while a lady who loves kids started a cr?che. The idea is to look at something that will fill the spare time and help them earn some money as well,? Totla explained.

 Open to anyone above 50, the workshop will have a batch size of 25 and a fee of Rs 100.

 The ?unretirement? workshop kicks off activities at Dignity Foundation?s new day-care centre for the elderly in Babubagan Lane, Dhakuria. 

 Several facilities will be available at the 1,500- sq-ft centre for a one-time membership of Rs 1,000. The list includes library, psychological, legal and financial advice, meditation and yoga, indoor games and computer training. Monthly get-togethers and film shows will also be organised.

 By October, a Dementia Care Centre for dementia and Alzheimer?s patients is also scheduled to come up on the same premises. ?There are over 30,000 Alzheimer?s patients in the city. It?s very difficult for the untrained family members to look after them,? said Totla. 

 Activities at this centre will include building dementia awareness and a memory gym.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 How to control the parking problem in Calcutta is a million-dollar 

 question. My office is on AJC Bose Road and I pay Rs 20 

 every day for parking my car for eight hours. But on a particular 

 day, I was asked to cough up Rs 70 for seven hours. The 

 parking attendants were very rude and threatened me with 

 dire consequences if I refused. Ultimately, after a heated 

 argument, I paid Rs 20 and left the spot. It was not the 

 first instance when I had faced these goons. On many previous 

 occasions, I have noticed that these attendants do not carry 

 the rate cards and charge unusually high on the pretext 

 that they have to pay shares to the cops and others of their 

 ilk. I request the authorities to take steps to stop such 

 harassment. 

 Name withheld. 

 The autorickshaws plying on the Jadavpur-Mukundapur route 

 regularly charge Rs 5.50 per passenger whereas, the autorickshaw 

 fare in other places for the same distance is just Rs 3.50. 

 Why are the rates so high here? The transport authority 

 and the autorickshaw unions should look into the matter.

 The stretch leading to Calcutta Leather Complex from EM 

 Bypass has turned into a death trap with accidents occurring 

 almost every day. Even the five-point crossing near Big 

 Bazaar and Peerless Hospital is fraught with danger. I have 

 seldom spotted any traffic policemen there. Immediate steps 

 should be taken to control the chaos in this area to avoid 

 mishaps. 

 Radhu Roy, Panchasayar.

 Study sugar, save the foot

 - Training can help doctors curb diabetic amputation: Experts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over 40,000 patients lose their feet to diabetes every year. But several can be spared the ordeal if doctors are trained in treatment of diabetic foot.

 To fix the limp in healthcare, around 1,000 camps are being held across the country to train doctors in management of diabetic foot. One of the camps, organised by Dr Reddy?s Laboratories, was held in Calcutta on Sunday.

 The initiative could not have been better timed, as it is estimated that India in the next 10 years will turn out to be the diabetes capital of the world. In the absence of remedial measures, the disease in several patients will manifest itself through foot ulcers, resulting in amputation and a crippling economic loss for society.

 ?Diabetic foot problems are going to reach epidemic proportions in the country in the next few years and most patients will be in the age group of 35-45,? warned Arun Bal, president of the Diabetic Foot Society of India.

 ?Losing one?s feet to diabetes can be devastating for anyone, but if it happens in the most productive years of a person?s life, the emotional and economic burden becomes too overbearing for the victim. The key to prevention of amputation is to train doctors,? he added.

 The ?Save the Foot? initiative of Dr Reddy?s is also aimed at educating people suffering from diabetes on how to take care of their feet and prevention of possible amputation.

 ?We need cost-effective strategies for educating doctors, diabetics and care-givers. Advances in medicine or technology will help prevent foot ulcers. On behalf of the medical community, I can say that initiatives like these workshops can contribute a lot to prevention of amputation,? Bal added.

 In order to give more impetus to the initiative, Dr Reddy?s has launched patient information websites on foot care. 

 ?The initiative reinforces our commitment to diabetic foot care,? said Satish Reddy, chief operating officer and managing director of Dr Reddy?s Laboratories.

 Experts estimate that if existing international guidelines on diabetic foot management are implemented, the incidence of amputation can be reduced by 49-85 per cent. 

 The guidelines call for identification of patients at risk of foot complications, regular foot examination, use of appropriate footwear and training in self-care for diabetics.

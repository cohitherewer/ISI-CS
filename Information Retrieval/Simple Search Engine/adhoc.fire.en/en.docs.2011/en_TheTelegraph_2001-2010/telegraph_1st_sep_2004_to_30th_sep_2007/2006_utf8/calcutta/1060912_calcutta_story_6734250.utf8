 Luke Wilson with Uma Thurman in My 

 Super Ex-Girlfriend

 Actor LUKE WILSON plays Matt Saunders opposite Uma Thurmans G-Girl in My Super Ex-Girlfriend. This is what he has to say about his high-flying experience.

 What do you think about this 

 film?

 I just really enjoyed the script. Don Payne, the guy who wrote it, is just a very funny guy; he works on The Simpsons. I think its very funny, but it also has heart and then it has funny stuff about relationships. I just think its something people can relate to. Everybodys been through a rocky relationship and this is a very rocky one.

 What about working with Uma?

 Its been really fun to work with Uma. I, of course, was a big fan of hers, have been a big fan for a while. She doesnt seem like she does a lot of comedies, really. It kind of makes me laugh when she goes into acting like the crazy girlfriend. She does a really funny job of that. Shes just a very smart person and she does a really good job helping get scenes set up.

 Tell us something about your 

 character...

 Matt Saunders is just kind of a regular guy. Hes single, he works as an architect. Rainn Wilson and I play best friends and hes that typical friend that gives terrible relationship advice, which I listen to. And then one day I see Umas character in the subway and I go up to her and ask her out and she turns me down. And then a guy snatches her purse and I catch the guy and get her purse back and we start going out. And then it becomes clear that shes G-Girl, the female Superman of Manhattan. And Im really excited about that, Ive been a big fan of hers from reading The New York Post. And then as the relationship progresses, she gets stranger and stranger

 You break up after discovering 

 shes a superhero. Do you really expect us to believe that 

 somebody will dump Uma Thurman?

 Yeah, I know its not that believable right? When we were shooting the movie she would do something really very crazy and funny which I find so attractive in a woman, and Id have to remain myself.

 How come you get paired with 

 power women (Charlies Angels, Legally Blonde)?

 I dont know. How did you get to date Reese Witherspoon in Legally Bonde? people ask. I dont know. Its just something I ended up doing.

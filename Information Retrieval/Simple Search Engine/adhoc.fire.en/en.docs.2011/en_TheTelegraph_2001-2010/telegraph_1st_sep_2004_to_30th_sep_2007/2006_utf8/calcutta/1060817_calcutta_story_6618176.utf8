The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Iconic mall at book hub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Not just a bastion of books, the countrys first book mall, at the heart of the College Street Market urban renewal initiative, would become a vibrant cultural hub, melding the old with the new, according to Hafeez Contractor.

 The Mumbai-based architect anchoring the design solution of the 500,000-sq ft Barna Parichay, a joint venture between Bengal Shelter Housing and Calcutta Municipal Corporation, did his first walk-through of College Street on Wednesday, along with civic officials and planners.

 Its very important we dont lose the old fabric. The proposed mall should respect the past, yet look ahead at the future. We must make an edifice, which is really iconic and puts Calcutta on the international map architecturally, Contractor told Metro later.

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who along with Bengal Shelter managing director Samar Nag, filled the architect in on the unique character of College Street and the aspirations of the book-loving Calcuttans, also stressed on the need to be sensitive to the past, the streetscape and the heritage factor.

 Contractor said Barna Parichay, which would replace the municipal market of 1917 vintage, would combine books with arts and culture, shopping, food and entertainment. Itll be a complete destination where one can spend the entire day without running out of surprises, he smiled.

 The architect, who designed 22 Camac Street, wants to do a very contemporary faade, and recreate old Calcutta streetscapes as the interiors. The box will be shining new, with precious old jewels stacked inside. There will also be a museum of rare books and an auction house, besides parking for 2,800 cars, Contractor added.

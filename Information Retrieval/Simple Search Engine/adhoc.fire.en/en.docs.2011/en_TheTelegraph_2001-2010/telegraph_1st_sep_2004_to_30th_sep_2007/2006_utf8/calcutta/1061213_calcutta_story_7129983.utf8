 Empty kiosks stand guard

 If you are mugged or teased at night on a deserted crossing do not expect police to lend a helping hand. You might not even be able to approach them for help because chances are that the nearest Calcutta Police kiosk will be deserted and locked.

 The kiosks were set up to introduce 24x7 policing on the streets, but several of them only serve to make a mockery of the grand goal.

 Deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Ranade said: Police officers have to be in the booth from 7 pm to early morning. We will look into the matter. Action will be taken against errant officers.

 After focussing on the locked police kiosks at Fairlie Place and Strand Road, Metro turns the spotlight on two more kiosks in similar state at important crossroads.

 Where: Eden Hospital Road- 

 Central Avenue crossing, in front of Central Metro station 

 When: 9 pm

 Police station: Bowbazar

 What we saw: Commuters 

 jostling for space with vehicles in a rush to reach home. 

 An accident is just waiting to happen. But the kiosk is 

 locked and the cops are nowhere to be seen. Even much later, 

 no cop takes up his post at the kiosk. 

 Thanaspeak: It is not 

 possible to provide guards at the kiosk round the clock. 

 They are supposed to be there from 9 pm to early morning, 

 said an officer of Bowbazar police station. When told that 

 the kiosk was closed late at night, he claims the guards 

 went on their rounds. Even if they have gone out, they 

 cannot switch off the lights and lock the kiosk, admitted 

 the officer. 

 Commuterspeak: This is 

 an accident-prone zone. The police must have thought it 

 necessary to set up a kiosk here. But what is the use if 

 no one mans it? asks Jamil Akhtar, who has a cellphone 

 shop near the crossing.

 Where: Mechhua-Central 

 Avenue crossing, in front of Mahatma Gandhi Road Metro station.

 When: 9.15 pm

 Police station: Jorasanko

 What we saw: The busy crossing 

 is chock-a-block. Only the kiosk is shut. 

 Thanaspeak: Our officers 

 are there at the kiosk round the clock, asserts an officer 

 of Jorasanko police station. The pictures though tell a 

 different story. 

 Commuterspeak: There are 

 often scuffles in the area. The police kiosk is reassuring 

 but there are hardly any cops inside, said a local fruitseller.

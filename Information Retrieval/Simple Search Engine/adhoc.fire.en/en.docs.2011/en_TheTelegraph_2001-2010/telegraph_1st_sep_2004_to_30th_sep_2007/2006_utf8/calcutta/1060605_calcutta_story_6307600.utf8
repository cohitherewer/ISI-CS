What: Phulwari ? A Floral Fantasy. 

Where: Soumyas Creation at 57/9, Ballygunge 

Circular Road.

 When: Till June 10, from 4 pm to 8.30 pm.

 Take a look: With the floral motif as the theme, the exhibition displays chiffons, georgettes, cottons and light mulberry silks along with a small collection of Chanderis designed with phool butis and jharpallas.

 Also available are printed cotton Gadwals and other hand-woven experimental textiles, suitable for summer wear. The floral motif is seen in cotton salwar kurta sets and stitched kurtis, cushion covers and durries, printed stationery and brocade-embellished carry bags. 

 The flower has also been an inspiration for a line of silk tops for women, worked upon with kantha embroidery. 

 A range of light silk and cotton kurtis in floral tones and prints comes with scarves worked upon with floral patterns. Also on offer are batik saris, salwar kurta sets and short tops.

 A range of costume jewellery in floral designs uses semi-precious stones such as pink quartz, blue topaz, tourmaline, tanzanite and more.

 Candles in floral shapes and floral perfumes are also exhibited. These are made by Silence, an organisation working with the hearing impaired, and Asha Niketan, that works with the mentally challenged.

 Pocket pinch: Rs 25 to Rs 4,000.

 Voiceover: Phulwari celebrates the floral motif in textiles, prints, hand-woven and handmade products. A part of the display is sourced from a cluster development programme sponsored by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation directly impacting 300 families of weavers. We have kept the exhibition as an evening bazaar so that people dont have to venture out in the afternoon heat, said Sudatta Chakraborty of Soumyas Creation.

 Royal reward

 What: Ponds Sapno Ki Rajkumari contest.

 Where: Pantaloons at 22, Camac Street.

 When: Saturday, 3 pm onwards.

 Take a look: An ambience of royal grandeur was created at the store, replete with a throne, a woman with a fan and sentinels on either side. Shoppers at the store played exciting games, following which the winners were presented with crowns. 

 They were then showered with rose petals and given Ponds gift hampers, silver tulips and other prizes. The five minutes of fame that the contest offered to each were heartily enjoyed by all the winners ? Pamita, Jayita, Monica, Priyanka and Raman. 

 The two-day contest at the store is a floating campaign for a bigger national-level Sapno Ki Rajkumari competition, where one has to buy Ponds talc and tear off the contest strip from the pack. Lucky winners will be crowned, taken around town in a palanquin and treated royally for one whole day.

 Voiceover: I had just come here to shop and took part in the contest and look what Ive got ? a pair of diamond earrings! said a visibly elated Pamita. Now Im looking forward to participating in the national contest, she added.

 Up above the world 

 so high: A lunatic bridges the gap between food and 

 fantasy 

 Apropos the report ?Doctors petition 

 CM for security?, March 17, the brutal murder of Salt Lake-based 

 physician Jayanta Ghosh has resulted in panic among city 

 doctors. 

 The members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has expressed concern about the growing incidents of assault on doctors. And rightly so. Jayanta Ghosh was asked by his murderers to accompany them to a patient?s house. He agreed without realising that it was a trap. 

 Most doctors do not refuse to visit patients. Sometimes the visits are made late at night. A few years back, I had accompanied a doctor friend on a late night visit to a patient. We found that the young man my friend was supposed to treat was already dead. There was blood near the throat and bruises on the body. 

 The relatives were furious when my friend refused to issue a death certificate. They started threatening him. My friend was courageous enough to ignore the warnings and leave without writing the death certificate, but there was nothing he could have done if the relative attacked him. The court hauls up doctors for issuing death certificates to murdered patients, but there?s no one to protect physicians from the murderers? 

 I know of a veteran city surgeon who has to change his address frequently to avoid threat calls. He has informed police as well as the IMA about the threats, but to no avail. Even the chief minister has not responded his repeated pleas for protection.

 Apropos the report ?Quest for food atop the bridge?, March 17, the acts of lunatics sometimes prove to be quite significant. I find similarities between a madman clambering to 280 ft above the sea level in search of food and the chief minister trying to attract foreign investment. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is busy climbing the development tree, shedding the age-old dogmas. In a state where development is synonymous with flyovers, it is ironical that a lunatic chose to climb atop the oldest bridge. 

 Joyeeta Dey,

 Teghoria. 

 What should have been done by 

 policemen posted on the Howrah bridge, was done by some 

 vegetable vendors. Not only did they spot the madman climbing 

 up a tower, they informed the police. The incident highlights 

 the laxity of the security personnel. They should be more 

 cautious in the future, as they are protecting one of the 

 prides of Calcutta. 

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake. 

 It is difficult to imagine how 

 a lunatic managed to climb to the top of the Howrah bridge, 

 where so many security personnel are posted. This incident 

 underscores the negligence of police in discharging their 

 duties. The lack of vigil can result in disaster on any 

 given day. The government should not forget that Howrah 

 bridge is part of the city?s heritage and should not compromise 

 on its protection. The police superintendent?s assurance 

 that the mental patient will be admitted in an asylum is 

 commendable.

 Apropos the report ?Owners gun for sale bar?, March 17, the high court?s decision to renew permits of commercial vehicles that are older than 15 years is a regressive step. The judgment will certainly result in increase in pollution level in the city. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in respiratory problems among the residents of Calcutta. The older vehicles are also susceptible to mechanical breakdown and metal fatigue. 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 New Alipore. 

 After the high court removed the bar on pre-1990 

 commercial vehicles, the government should have forced the 

 vehicles to switch to green fuel to curb auto-emission. 

 Strangely, and most unfortunately, the government is bent on appearing too busy on other things to pay much attention to the issue.

 Apropos the report ?Calcutta beckons back-in-action Bachchan?, March 24, it was interesting to learn that Amitabh Bachchan would visit Calcutta soon after his recovery from a major illness. Big B is a great artiste and has made an indelible mark on the minds of cinema-lovers. But he needs to curb the temptation of making easy money through advertisements. 

 Prahlad Agarwala, 

 Majdia, Nadia. 

 Apropos the report ?Court orders sold as scrap?, March 24, corruption is the biggest industry in India post Independence. Files going missing from Calcutta High Court is indicative of the rot that has set in. Without the collusion of the court staff, the files could not have been stolen. 

 Sachindra Nath Mitra,

 Beleghata. 

 The cops are claiming that a drug 

 addict living on the pavement near the high court had stolen 

 355 of the 800 lost case files from the premises, while 

 the remaining files are yet to be traced. Such a daring 

 act cannot be undertaken by an addict without involvement 

 of the court personnel. Judgments might have been stolen 

 with an ulterior motive. 

 Govinda Bakshi, 

 Budge Budge 

 The report of case files being 

 stolen from the high court building raises the question: 

 Is the collapse of the entire system imminent? Every time 

 one visits the court, one notices scores of policemen guarding 

 it. It is difficult to believe hundreds of files were stolen 

 from the building without they being aware. 

 Only recently, lawyers with fake Ll.B degrees were found to be practising in the high court for years. Elsewhere in the city, questions were leaked and sold outside a school. Headmasters provided false certificates. Is there any ways to break this vicious circle of corruption?

 SP Mukherjee Road 

 Apropos the report ?Mummy wants me to model?, March 17, it is unfortunate that mothers are more interested in their teenaged daughter?s modelling care, than the daughter?s themselves. The lack of concern for basic education can only have detrimental effects. The late teens are crucial in the life of any person. If during this period, the elders espouse a value system that puts glamour above knowledge and skill, the consequences are bound to be disastrous. 

 Diptimoy Ghosh,

 Salt Lake. 

 Apropos the caption ?Stock exchange?, March 18, the photographs are not of love birds. The birds are called Budgerigars. Their common Bengali name is Badri and their origin is in Australia. Love birds are called Agopornis and are native to Africa. 

 Nilanjan Das,

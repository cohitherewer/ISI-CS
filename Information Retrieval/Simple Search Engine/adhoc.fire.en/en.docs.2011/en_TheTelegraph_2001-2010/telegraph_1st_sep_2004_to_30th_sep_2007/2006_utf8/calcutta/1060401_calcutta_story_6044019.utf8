Homecoming truths

 Some critics consider The Homecoming Pinter?s masterpiece, above The Birthday Party, just as some place Endgame higher than Waiting for Godot in Beckett?s oeuvre. This judgment indicates the complexity of the respective plays. Tathagata Singha, who directed Homecoming for Theatrecian last week, and had directed Godot in his debut last year, must have felt the steep hike in the difficulty index. One would apply two criteria to evaluate youth in such theatrical enterprises: applaud the young group for attempting a formidable text, and criticise it where its inexperience failed to come up to the exceptionally high standards that the play demands.

 Two glaring gaps in Singha?s direction sufficed to castle the production. Both could have been easily avoided by just a modicum of studying Pinterian detail and technique. First, the utter falsity of the set. Pinter created a seedy working-class home degenerating further: Max a former butcher and Sam a cabbie, but the sons Lenny and Joey a pimp and would-be boxer respectively. Instead, Singha hired furniture that could grace a genteel drawing room.

 Second, the gross negligence of the proverbial Pinter pause turned the savage, sinister undertones into straightforward comic lines at which the audience laughed merrily. The Homecoming depends not on its dialogue but on its silences, the subtext between the lines. Its characters are animals stalking each other in a cage smelling of their own filth, waiting for a false move to pounce. Singha gave them no time to develop this unvoiced bestial menace.

 If we ignore these obvious deficiencies, Singha succeeded in conveying the absurdist world in which Pinter deliberately topples every convention of the age-old dramatic situation of the happy family reunion. He also captured Pinter?s politically incorrect aim of exposing the slimy underbelly of England, to show how low the lumpen can descend, as well as poking fun at the idiocy of academics who supposedly live on a higher plane. 

 The eldest son Teddy, a professor of philosophy, cannot answer one question on his subject; Lenny makes a superior philosopher.

 The male acting was strong, led by Max, to whose crotchety father/mother figure Tanaji Dasgupta added minutely conceived mannerisms. Tathagata Chowdhury expressed the personality of the impotent but gentle Sam. Soumyak Kanti De Biswas (Teddy) made quite an impression as an unsmiling Austin Powers lookalike. Deborshi Barat and Sumeet Thakur presented Lenny and Joey as crass, leering men.

 Ronjini Chakraborty disappointed as Ruth, Teddy?s wife who chooses to become the queen bee to the others? drones. Singha declares that he wanted to stage Homecoming because he ?fell in love with Ruth?, but that did not rub off on his treatment of Ronjini. She revealed no trace whatsoever of the rich motivations underlying her character, which Vivien Merchant (Pinter?s first wife) created so definitively in the original as well as the film.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Net shield against mosquito

 DEBASISH BISWAS, entomologist, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, met readers of The Telegraph to answer their queries. Participants included Dipti Bhattacharya, Soma Basak, Srikumar Chattopadhyay, Rajasree Dasgupta, Sudipta Basak, Dhruba Nag, Bijon Kanti Das, Sushanta Pandit, Kajal Roy, Shyamal Debnath, Sandip Banerjee, Nabin Chandra Mondol, Mou Basak, Krishna Basak and Dipankar Bhattacharya

Rajasree Dasgupta: Are coils, mats and liquid repellents effective in preventing malaria? What is the most effective protection against mosquitoes? 

 The mats, coils and liquid repellents have been found to be useless in warding off malaria-causing Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Mosquito nets are most useful in maintaining a barrier between man and mosquito.

 A survey by the civic body revealed that 75 to 80 per cent of the people suffering from malaria use mats, coils or liquid repellents at night. Only 3-4.5 per cent of the mosquito-net users had been afflicted with malaria.

Mou Basak: What is an ITN?

 ITN is an abbreviation for insecticide treated net. A mosquito net becomes an ITN if it is coated with synthetic Pyrethroid, Cyfluthrine or Permethrine. If a mosquito comes in contact with such a net, it dies instantly. An ITN needs to be coated every six months.

Dhruba Nag: You are advocating eco-friendly methods, such as fish and bio-larvicides, to control mosquito population. But why do you continue to spray chemical larvicides?

 Bio-larvicides do not work well in dirty water. Hence, we spray chemical larvicides on open drains and puddles. 

Krishna Basak: Despite the much-publicised anti-malaria drive, the mosquito population in the city is increasing. Why wasn?t the problem as acute 25 years ago?

 The reason behind the recent spate in the number of mosquitoes are open, congested drains, the real estate boom on the eastern fringes and the added areas and lack of awareness among the common people. Mosquitoes have wings and can easily enter the city core. The mosquito population was much lower 25 years ago because the open drains were not clogged.

Sudipta Basak: We are accustomed with itching caused by mosquito bites. But a mosquito bite causing a burning sensation is a fairly recent phenomenon.

 You become accustomed to the stings of mosquitoes in your locality. A burning sensation means the mosquito is not from your locality. 

Sandip Banerjee: How can you control malaria and dengue by spraying larvicide in puddles and open drains when Tolly?s Nullah and Beleghata Canal have become breeding grounds of mosquitoes?

 Vectors of malaria and dengue lay eggs in clean water. We had collected samples of larvae from the two canals. No larva of Anopheles stephensi or Aedes aegypti was found.

Soma Basak: How can we check mosquito breeding in our houses without using chemicals?

 Do not let water accumulate and keep the reservoir clean. You can use pith beads. It is an internationally accepted method of larvae control. The pith beads float on the surface and make the mosquitoes think that there is no water underneath.

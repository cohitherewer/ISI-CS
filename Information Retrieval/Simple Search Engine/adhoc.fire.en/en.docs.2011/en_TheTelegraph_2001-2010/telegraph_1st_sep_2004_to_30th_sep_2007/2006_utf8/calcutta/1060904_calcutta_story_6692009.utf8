 A partial lunar eclipse will unfold in the Calcutta sky on September 7, starting at 11.35 pm and ending at 1.07 am the next day. 

 A lunar eclipse occurs when sunlight, blocked by the Earth, does not fall on the moons surface the whole of it or a part thereof. During a partial eclipse, the Sun, Earth and the Moon are almost in a straight alignment, but not exactly positioned along a straight line.

 The greatest magnitude of the September 7 eclipse will be 0.190, occurring around 00.21 am, when the moon will be a little to the south of the exact overhead (zenith) position.

 Less than 20 per cent of the moon will be under the main umbral shadow, caused when the moon passes through the full shadow of the earth. The penumbral eclipse, that is the space around the moon that remains partially illuminated, will start at 10.12 pm and end after the main partial eclipse at 4 am on September 8.

 It will be difficult for the people to identify and observe a penumbral eclipse, when the moon will be just a shade darker than its original brightness. The best viewing time will be from 11.35 pm on September 7 to 1.07 am on September 8, said Debiprosad Duari, director, research and academics, MP Birla Planetarium.

 The eclipse will be best visible, almost near the zenith, from everywhere in the country. The whole eclipse can be seen from the eastern half of Africa, most of Asia, Europe and western half of Australia.

 Since the eclipse will take place almost around midnight and needs no special instrument for viewing, MP Birla Planetarium has not made any arrangement for the public. People can see the eclipse from their home with the naked eye.

 Clouds permitting, it will be a wonderful opportunity for the people of Calcutta to view this partial eclipse, Duari added.

 The last partial lunar eclipse in the Calcutta sky was on October 17, 2005. According to astronomers, the next lunar eclipse, on March 4, 2007, will be total, though in India the eclipse will be partial and can been seen during moonset.

 India?s meteoric rise in the field 

 of IT has been well documented. But industry insiders and 

 experts warn that maintaining the edge over other emerging 

 economies like China, Brazil and Philippines will become 

 increasingly difficult. The Indian youth will have to be 

 more industry-oriented to meet the requirements of the employers.

 To address this issue, the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Calcutta, hosted a seminar on ?Empowering youth for an IT-enabled nation? at Science City recently. The speakers for the evening were principal IT secretary G.D. Gautama, senior vice-president of Satyam Computer Services Sudhaker Varanasi, and CEO of Skytech Solutions D.K. Chaudhuri.

 ?India has to move further from simply providing low-cost labour and position itself as a place where there is skilled manpower. The youth have an important role to play if we wish to move up the global value chain,? said Gautama.

 ?While ITeS provided us with the momentum, it is software research and development that will give us the thrust. We have to focus on creation and innovation. Education will be our greatest tool for this. In fact, one should take the example of Bengal, which has the highest per capita expenditure on education in this country,? he added.

 While using technology to create wealth was a point agreed upon by all, the usage of technology for the benefit of society at large was deemed to be equally important. ?There has to be a social dimension as well. Technology has to benefit society at large and has to have social ramifications. Today?s youth have to chase excellence in every sphere, not just success,? pointed out Varanasi.

 ?The nature and quality of work produced by Indian industry today is amazing. Technology empowers the youth to do the sort of work that is not only monetarily beneficial but also socially gratifying,? he explained.

 ?Corporate social responsibility notwithstanding, the advent of technology has shown that capital is not the only requirement for the growth of a business. ?Technology has changed the paradigms of doing business. To make a company successful today, one does not need capital. Rather, it is the idea that sells,? felt Chaudhuri. 

 ?We require knowledge capital. That is where India has such an advantage over other nations. Having one of the youngest populations in the world is our biggest asset,? the CEO emphasised.

 Chaudhuri used the example of Infosys Technologies, which had started with a capital of $250 and had crossed $2 billion in revenues in just over 25 years.

Quota controversy

 The stand of the medical students 

 against reservation is undeniably justified. A country that 

 propagates the principles of equality and liberty as social 

 values should not pass such an illogical bill in Parliament. 

 Dividing students on the basis of their caste is immoral. 

 The authorities should be more concerned with the merit 

 and efficiency of students rather than their social background. 

 Medical students are rightly stating their demands. The 

 government should negotiate with them.

 Doctors are striking to protest 

 the increase in quotas in higher educational institutions. 

 This has severely hit the healthcare system, the main sufferers 

 being the patients. How can doctors be so insensitive to 

 people?s difficulties? A doctor?s profession is said to 

 be noble. But this method of protest is atrocious. Why don?t 

 Indians adopt different methods of protest where the inconvenience 

 to the common man is minimised? Stopping work is not a solution. 

 The doctors should understand this before the situation 

 worsens.

 The quota controversy is inconvenient 

 for all. The situation has reached a dead-end. Police are 

 ruthlessly lathicharging students. The quota hike will undoubtedly 

 deprive those with merit, and will adversely affect the 

 country at large. The government now is thinking of a compromise 

 ? increasing the quota in stages. One day in the near future, 

 one or more institutes of higher education will be reserved 

 for OBCs. The present increase in quota will not cover all 

 OBC students, and soon they will be asking for more. If 

 this trend continues, there will have to be reservation 

 for students deprived by the OBC quota.

 Counting their bones

 Stroking their bulging bellies

 Merrily with their rickety fingers; 

 The little ones stand in delirium, 

 While their mother serves opium; 

 No! She has no choice to make 

 ?This is all for today,? they can take. 

 The kids then speak of better days 

 When they drink, if they do 

 Possess a few phials of cheap liquor, 

 (Life, at times, provides a great succour!) 

 So what if they lie stirring on the cold ground, 

 Ready to die under the naked moon; 

 There?ll be someone to count their bones 

 And make a living of their own.

 The rain slithers down your slender 

 spine

 Creating ecstasy in your erratic eyes.

 Dance divine damsel of dreams

 With the whirling wind in your hair

 Taste nectar on your tongue

 Salvation is yours.

 Teacher bill protest

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 West Bengal United Minorities Forum and the Calcutta Diocese of the Church of North India (CNI) on Monday organised a rally to protest the recent amendment to the School Service Commission Act, 1997. 

 The amendment, in February, makes it mandatory for state-aided minority institutions to recruit teachers through the government-controlled West Bengal School Service Commission.

 The rally started at St James School, on AJC Bose Road, and proceeded to Rani Rashmoni Avenue along SN Banerjee Road. Bishop of the Calcutta Diocese Reverend P.S.P. Raju led the procession.

 Nearly 3,000 people took part in the protest under the banner of the forum, an umbrella body of representatives of minority communities, including Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists.

 The educational institutions under the CNI were represented at the rally by their principals, teachers and guardians of the students.

 Two teams of delegates later met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and submitted a memorandum demanding withdrawal of the bill.

 Suman Biswas, a CNI spokesperson, said the chief minister had promised to look into the matter. The CNI would continue the protest until the demand was met, he added.

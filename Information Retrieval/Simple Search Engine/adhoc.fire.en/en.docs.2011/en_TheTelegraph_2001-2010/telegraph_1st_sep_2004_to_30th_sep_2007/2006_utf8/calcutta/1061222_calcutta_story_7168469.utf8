 By January, the fragrances will be available in Shoppers Stop, Nik Nish and Pantaloons.

 Pocket pinch: The products are priced between Rs 900 and Rs 2,800.

 Voiceover: The fragrances are for all age groups and we are sure they will do well in this market, smiled Naresh Gurani, group general manager, MKP Distributors.

 Festive fete

 What: Christmas Bazaar.

 Where: Loreto House, Middleton Row.

 When: December 16, 10 am to 6 pm.

 Take a look: The crowd streamed in all day long at the fete organised by Loreto House Alumnae Association. 

 Stalls were selling everything from salwar suits and tops to bags from Ballyfabs to trinkets to potpourri to personalised cards to cushions and candles. 

 Cake auctioning and the jukebox scored with the younger crowd, but the real hit was hair expert Bridgette Joness stall offering nail art, temporary tattoos and hair extensions. There were game stalls too Feed Santa, Light The Candle, Snow The Snowman, Ring Toss and Coin The Coin. 

 The little ones had a ball at the playpen, complete with games like jumping Mickeymouse, junglegym, train ride and merry-go-round. 

 Voiceover: The proceeds from the Christmas Bazaar we organise once in two years go towards raising funds for scholarships and sheltering children. This is dedicated to our alma mater, said Uma Ahmad, president, Loreto House Alumnae Association.

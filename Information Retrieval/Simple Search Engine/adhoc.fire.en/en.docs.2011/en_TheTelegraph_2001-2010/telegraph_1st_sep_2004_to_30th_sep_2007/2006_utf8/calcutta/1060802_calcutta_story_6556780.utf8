 The City Diary

 Justice J. Bhattacharya of Calcutta High Court on Tuesday issued an order allowing the Salt Lake municipality to go ahead with the process of floating a tender for setting up 14 car parks. The municipality had decided to float tenders for the setting up of parking zones in a number of places, including in the Nicco Park-Nalban area. The decision was challenged in the court by an organisation that had been earlier engaged in collecting parking fees in the township.

 The city civic authorities on Tuesday launched a drive to clear the Strand Road pavements of encroachments by shop-owners. Several iron pipes and other items, stacked on the pavements by six shop-owners, were seized. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said similar action would be taken against other shop-owners in the Burrabazar area.

 A 45-year-old pavement-dweller was found lying unconscious on Mansatala Road, in Watgunge, on Tuesday morning. Local residents took him to SSKM Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police said the man, identified as Panchu, might have died of heart attack.

 Anshu Devi, 45, died after being hit by a truck near Paharpur, under West Port police station, early on Tuesday. Police said the victim was a resident of a slum nearby.

 Shankar Saha, 38, was critically injured after being knocked down by a Tata Sumo at the CR Avenue-BB Ganguly Street crossing on Tuesday morning. Saha was taken to Medical College and Hospital.

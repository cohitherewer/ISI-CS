 Tech treat for music lovers

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Denon from Japan, KEF from Britain 

 and Polk Audio from America. With some of the best brands 

 of speakers, amplifiers and AV receivers under one roof, 

 a new south Calcutta address is offering music lovers a 

 treat. 

 Octave Music (picture by Aranya 

 Sen), on 16/2 Hindustan Road, is aiming to cater to the 

 quality conscious Calcuttan. There was 

 a need in the city for a destination store that is also 

 an experience store, says Sangita Mukherjee, a director 

 with Octave Music. 

 Octave doubles as the showroom for the Bangalore-based company PROFX, which represents Denon, KEF and Polk Audio in India. Calcutta is still an untapped market for premium hi-fi products. Were testing the waters here with this store, says Manu Ganesh, chief operating officer of PROFX.

 Denon was founded in 1910 and has a few firsts to its credit ? like selling the first LP record in Japan. The entire range of Denon amplifiers, AV receivers, DVD players and home-theatre systems is available at Octave. Ditto for KEF and Polk Audio, the British and American brand of speakers, respectively. 

 The speakers have different flavours. For a punchy and dynamic sound, you should go for Polk Audio. And for a sound with more details, KEF, advises Ganesh. 

 The European-styled store in Gariahat ? the fourth PROFX showroom in the country after Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai ? is spread across 900 sq ft and sports two demo rooms and a display area. We want customers to bring in their own music and listen to it on as many systems as they want till theyre satisfied, offers Mukherjee. 

 Its been less than a month and the footfall is encouraging. Weve had a great response. Buyers coming in range from college goers to the elderly. They are very knowledgeable and know exactly what they want. Denon has a very high brand recall, says Mukherjee.

 Prices range from Rs 15,000 to Rs 4 lakh for Denon, Rs 19,000 to Rs 7.5 lakh for KEF and Rs 9,000 to Rs 85,000 for Polk Audio. Besides the PROFX brands, Octave also stocks CD players and amplifiers from the British brand Chord, cables and inter-connects from QED, plasmas and LCDs from Panasonic, LCDs from Sharp and projectors from Sanyo. 

 A surprise hit is the turntable from Denon, priced at Rs 9,900, which has seen queries coming in from GenEx to GeNext. PROFX is targeting a turnover of Rs 20 to 25 lakh per month from the Calcutta stop and is looking to set up more stores in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Coimbatore and Ahmedabad.

 Daughterlocks 

 up woman?s body

 A STAFF REPORTER

 There was unease in Salt Lake?s CG Block on Monday morning over the death of an elderly lady.

 Rekha Roy, 65, a resident of CG 202, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom in the morning. Her daughter locked the entrance of the house, not allowing anyone to enter. Neighbours called the police, who broke open the door. 

 Bidhannagar (East) police station has started a case of unnatural death on the basis of a complaint by relative Pratip Chandra Roy. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 ?There was no external injury,? said a police officer.

 Rekha?s husband P.C. Roy, a doctor who used to work with the central government, is suffering from Alzheimer?s disease. Their son Sanjay stays abroad, while one of the two daughters, Seema, lived with the couple.

 According to police, Seema had studied in the US for several years. She had returned a few months ago. Neighbours said she had ?psychological problems?.

 Around 9 am on Monday, the neighbours learnt of the death. ?Rekha?s husband told a neighbour that she had died,? stated Shyamal Gon, secretary of the CG Block Welfare Association.

 When the neighbours reached the house, they found P.C. Roy loitering outside and the door locked.

 ?Since he is suffering from Alzheimer?s, he sometimes behaves incoherently. But we were surprised to find the door locked,? added Gon.

 When the neighbours knocked on the door, Seema started shouting at them. ?She abused us and asked us to leave,? recounted block association president Adhir Chatterjee. ?We went to the rear of the house through the driveway and saw the body lying on the floor.?

 The neighbours then called the cops. Seema, however, refused to open the doors even for the policemen and shouted at them. 

 When the main entrance was broken down, she locked herself up in another room. Its entrance also had to be broken down. The body was then taken for post-mortem.

 Where: The Park banquets. 

 When: Friday afternoon.

 The competition: The Anglo Gold Ashanti Auditions invited jewellery designs from all over the country. Forty designs were shortlisted from the 1,500-plus applications received.

 We received entries from professional designers, karigars as well as amateurs, said Chris Kenny, director, global markets of Rand Refinery Ltd. 

 The theme for the competition is Ethno Contemporary. The final 40 designs will be unveiled at a glittering show in Mumbai on March 24. The 40 designs will be executed jointly by MP Jewellers and Emerald Jewellers, Coimbatore.

 Apart from keeping with the visual element and theme, many other factors like practicality and saleability had to be kept in mind. Hence, we had an interesting mix on the judges panel, said Madhumita Dutta, senior brand manager of World Gold Council. 

 With Sabyasachi Mukherjee as the design consultant from the initial days of the competition, other judges included jewellery designer Saba Ali Khan, Anjali Lal from Tanishq, Chris Kenny, Chandrakanta Roychowdhury of MP Jewellers, Srinivasagam from Emerald Jewellers and Sanjiv Agarwal, managing director of World Gold Council.

 The winner will be given one kg of gold, the first runners-up wins 250 g while the second runners-up bags 100 g of the metal. 

 Voiceover: This is the first such competition and we are hoping to make it an annual feature. We are really looking forward to executing these designs because the design sensibilities that have come through have been phenomenal, said Chandrakanta Roychowdhury.

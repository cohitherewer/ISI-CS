 What: Launch of Akriti, 

 a fashion store.

 Where: 103, Park Street, fourth floor (beside Siddha Point).

 When: March 8.

 Take a look: The 1,500 sq ft sprawling showroom, tastefully done up in wood and glass, is home to exclusive ethnic wear for women.

 The design patterns are a combination of contemporary and traditional sensibilities. Stones, sequins, beads and crystals lend their brilliance to colourful fabrics. The colour palette ranges from cool citrines to splashy reds to elegant ivory.

 There are saris in fabrics like crepe, georgette, organza and jacquard. From those with simple borders to heavy ones with all-over work, there is a variety to choose from.

 The salwar suit collection is an assortment of party clothes and regular wear. Those with frilly sleeves and polka-dotted lowers are definite eye-catchers.

 Then there are the unstitched ones with screen prints, hand paints and kantha-stitched patterns.

 The real showstealers, however, are lehngas in vibrant colour combinations. While there are heavy bridal lehngas with ornate work all over, there are some lighter ones for other occasions. Also available are sherwanis for men that are in sync with the bridal lehngas.

 The store is also home to designer wear from Allure, Matra, Riddhiman and Supriya Saraf.

 Pocket pinch: Prices start at Rs 700.

 Voiceover: There is something for all age groups. Each piece is unique as the designs have not been repeated, smiles Rakesh Agarwal, proprietor of Akriti.

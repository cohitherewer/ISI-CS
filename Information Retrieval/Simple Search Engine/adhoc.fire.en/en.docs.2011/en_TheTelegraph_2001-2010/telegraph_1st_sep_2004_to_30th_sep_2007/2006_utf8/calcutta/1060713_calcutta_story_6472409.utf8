 Abhishek Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra in Bluffmaster!

 Always wanted to see those extra scenes of your favourite film that got chopped on the edit table? Well, STAR Gold brings to you the uncut premiere of last year?s musical hit Bluffmaster! starring Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, Riteish, Nana Patekar and Boman Irani.

 More than being a film, the Rohan Sippy creation was one big party on the sets and the chartbuster Right here right now was an accident. ?It all started with a joke when I just made a proposition jokingly to Rohan to make me sing,? recalls Abhishek. ?Rohan caught on and made me actually sing the track. Music directors Vishal and Shekhar have done a great job of pulling my joke this far.?

 The one person who did not have the best of times during the shooting schedules was Priyanka Chopra. ?Abhishek and Rohan together can really rag the hell out of you,? she describes. ?You can count Riteish too in that with Abhishek as the group leader. With three of them hand in glove, you simply have no chance to stand up to their madness.?

 Watch all these juicy nuggets along with the deleted scenes this Sunday, 8 pm on STAR Gold.

 News Broadcaster CNN-IBN is expanding its feature programme line-up with a new weekly show exploring the art of healthy living. The half-hour weekly show focusing on health and lifestyle, Living It Up, airs on Saturday at 2.30 pm and 5.30 pm, with a repeat on Sunday at 11.30 am. 

 According to CNN-IBN?s managing editor Rajdeep Sardesai: ?Through this programme we are aiming to share little nuggets of information to counter difficult times, manage problems, balance lives and endeavour to get the best out of life.?

 Each week, the programme will showcase health, fitness and beauty solutions to problems that are commonly faced by urban Indians today.

 Sharing information and solutions apart, the programme will also have a reality segment, the Weight Loss Challenge. Four dieticians will team up with four overweight people and over seven weeks they will be challenged to lose as much weight. The team, which loses the most weight, will wear the crown! 

 STAR News, which first started the trend of viewers turning reporters as early as 2003 with STAR Reporter, has turned the tables again. The recent heavy downpour in the first week of July in Mumbai provided a platform for people participation with hundreds of viewers sending in their narratives. They got featured on the STAR News special feature Aap Ka Bulletin, the most recent instance of people participation in an otherwise long roster of other such initiatives.

 The roster includes stories and videos beamed on the devastating tsunami of December 2004, the London blasts of July 2005, the infamous Delhi blasts last October and numerous other instances reported via mobile clips, video footage and emails reported in and telecast on STAR News.

 During the 26/7 Mumbai deluge last year, viewers braved flood waters and watery cesspools to bring in up-to-the-moment footage on life from the farthest corners of Mumbai. 

 People?s reporting has now been institutionalised on STAR News with the email addresses picturesstarnews.co.in and starnewsvsnl.net accepting stories, pictures and MMS clips while the phone numbers 022-66630137 and 022-66630099 serving as hotlines to receive viewer inputs.

 And now with the serial blasts in Mumbai on Tuesday, if you have more stories to tell, be heard and seen on STAR News.

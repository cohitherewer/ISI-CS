 Gift of a cultural bouquet 

 - Combo of art, dance and heritage from Germany

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A work by Georg Baselitz

 Contemporary art and choreography as big as it gets, a lens legend of our citys architectural heritage, an exchange residency programme of authors, a montage of award-winning TV shorts and strains of jazz and lounge

 Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) Calcuttas autumn-winter offerings promise to deliver a heady mix of programming cutting across genres, also bringing to town two global icons to showcase their creations.

 The exhibition of artist Georg Baselitz, Pina Bauschs Tanztheater Wuppertal and the photographic documentation of some listed heritage buildings in north Calcutta by Peter Bialobrzeski and his students from the College of Arts Bremen, are the high points for me, says MMB director Martin Waelde.

 Baselitz, who along with Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke and Rosemarie Trockel, is one of the most sought-after artists in the world, will exhibit his printed works at CIMA Gallery from October 13 to November 4. 

 The event will be jointly organised with CIMA and the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, Stuttgart.

 He won the Nobel Prize for Art the Premium Imperiale awarded in Tokyo, the highest award for contemporary art, for his energy-filled painting, according to MMB programme director S.V. Raman.

 Pina Bausch is considered the most important contemporary choreographer and one of the most influential dance personalities of the 20th Century. The concept of Tanztheater (dance theatre) she developed in the 1970s had a tremendous impact on contemporary dance.

 She and her team comprising stage designer Peter Pabst, her assistant Robert Sturm and her dancers will make a preliminary trip to Calcutta and Kerala (November 14-28) to gather impressions, ideas and inspiration for the new project India Piece.

 The premiere will take place at Wuppertal on May 18, 2007, before the production is brought to India with stops at Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai, and then moving on to Paris and other cities.

 India Piece is likely to be the last big international co-production that Bausch will embark on with her ensemble. Here, the co-producers are presented with a unique opportunity to introduce international elite audiences to India-aspirations choreographed by one of the greatest artists of our time, says Waelde, a personal friend of the artiste.

 Bialobrzeski, who had exhibited his Neon Tigers in Calcutta last year, will bring over 20 students from his Bremen institute for the photo-documentation project on north Calcutta heritage buildings.

 The project will be executed in collaboration with conservation architect Manish Chakrabarti and the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute, with support from German Academic Exchange Service.

 The results of the project will be presented in the form of a publication and an exhibition in March or April next year. MMB will also display a selection of artist portraits by another acclaimed German photographer Barbara Klemm on its premises (October 16 to December 24).

 Clicking for leading German daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeiting for over three decades, Klemm has shot portraits of personalities like Simone de Beauvoir, Joseph Beuys, Andy Warhol, Madonna, Simon Rattl and Alfred Hitchcock with her absolute photographic eye.

 We will also have Sasha Waltz, a very famous contemporary choreographer from Germany, perform her production Nobody at Rabindra Sadan (January 12, 2007) and a jazz concert with Wolfgang Haffner amp; Band this December, smiles Waelde.

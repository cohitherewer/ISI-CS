 - INCREASED CONNECTIVITY FOR POLICE STATIONS WITH LALBAZAR

 PRONAB MONDAL

 As part of their modernisation programme aimed at bringing in more efficiency, the Calcutta Police authorities have decided to send a set of five computers to each police station shortly.

 Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner of police (administration), said 27 police stations have been selected from all divisions of the force for the first phase of the programme. ?Not just computers, the thanas will also be provided with a printer, scanner and a photocopier each,? he said.

 The modernisation programme is being effected with funds from the Centre. ?The scheme has been adopted under the Centre?s National Crime Record Bureau?s Common Integrated Police Application programme. We have received a grant from Delhi and part of it is being spent on buying the computers and other gadgets,? Singh stated.

 Elaborating on the need to computerise the police stations, Singh said: ?We plan to register complaints ? both the general diary and the first information report ? on computers. The current practice is to write the complaints in record books. Once the system is introduced, complainants will be provided with printouts of their complaints.? 

 Singh has instructed all police stations to keep a corner of the duty-officer?s room ready for installing the gadgets. ?Four to five officers will be given the basic training in handling computers shortly,? he added.

 The authorities have also initiated a move to improve the online link between the headquarters and the police stations. ?The present system allows only eight thanas to establish a link with Lalbazar at a time. We are planning to increase the network capacity to at least 30.?

 The increased connectivity will ensure instant transmission of all decisions of the headquarters to the police stations and also help the authorities save on manpower. ?Suppose an organisation announces a major law-violation programme. The deputy commissioner (headquarters) finalises the police deployment by the previous afternoon. In the present set-up, we have to engage a batch of 20 cops and five vehicles to deliver the order to the offices of the five divisional deputy commissioners. The divisional offices, in turn, engage more groups to circulate the order to the thanas. As a result, it?s well after midnight when officers-in-charge come to know about their next day?s schedule,? Singh explained.

 But once the new system is in place, all police stations will be informed about the deputy commissioner (headquarters)?s order within two hours of its approval. ?And for this, we will not have to engage additional cops or vehicles,? Singh signed off.

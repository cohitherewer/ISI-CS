 Ramp rockers

 Where: Lake Club.

 When: Saturday, 7.30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: SMPAi, eastern Indias oldest and biggest acting, modelling and dance academy, celebrated its 12th anniversary. City models Manini, Sana, Tanushree, Sudipta, Abhishek, Vinay and others walked the ramp in outfits designed by Ria Boutique, punctuated with dance performances by Taal ? the beat and students of the academy. 

 The glamour quotient was upped by Arjun Chakraborty, Moyna Mukherjee, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee and Snehashish Bhattacharya among others. While Abhishek Verma got the award for outstanding ramp model and Fazul Haque bagged the outstanding product model award, Aratika Mukherjee won the award for outstanding child model of the year. 

 Manini Choudhury was selected the best music album artiste, Nilay Banerjee was the outstanding achiever of the year and Tanushree Ghoshal the face of the year. The student of the year award went to Pragya Paramita Dutta.

 Voiceover: This is the third year of the awards. Models have only contests and they are just for newcomers. Sadly, there are no awards for veteran models. In order to fill in the gap, we decided to institute these awards, said Samrat Mukherjee, principal of the academy.

My wife loves shopping at Shoppers Stop and its like her second home. After the grand welcome I certainly feel like a jamai, smiled Arindam.

 Arindam enthralled audiences with songs befitting the occasion ? Kaal gelam bhai sasurbarite followed by other Bengali melodies. Later in the evening it was band Prithivi that regaled audiences with Bangla band numbers. The audience clapped along as Arindam joined Prithivi for Sadher Lau.

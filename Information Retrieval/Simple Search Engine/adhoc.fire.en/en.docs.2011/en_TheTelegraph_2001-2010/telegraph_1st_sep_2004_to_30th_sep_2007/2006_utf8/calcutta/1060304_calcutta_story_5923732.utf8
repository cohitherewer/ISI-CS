 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the civic authorities to demolish a three-storeyed building on Tiljala Road within four weeks and submit a compliance report in a month.

 Justice Soumitra Sen, who passed the order, also asked both the state and city police to render ?all possible help? to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in razing the building.

 The order followed a contempt petition by Sharique Afzal, son of Mohammad Musa, who owns the plot on which the building had been constructed illegally.

 Moving the petition, Afzal?s lawyer Kallol Guha Thakurta submitted that the civic authorities had ignored a ?specific order? of the court to demolish the building.

 The lawyer appearing for the CMC, however, argued that the civic body had approached Karaya police station for help, ?but the officers refused on the grounds that they had not received any order from the court?.

 Hearing this, Justice Sen came down on the force and ruled: ?Police will have to obey the court?s directive.? 

 He asked the director-general of the state police and joint commissioner of the city force to ensure that the court?s directive is implemented smoothly.

 According to the records of the case, Musa?s father in 1959 had allowed Vinod Mallik to live on the plot at 83/1, Tiljala Road. ?In 2003, Vinod?s widow, Kestomoni, had made an agreement with a local promoter to construct a three-storeyed building on the plot. Kestomoni had furnished false documents at that time to prove that she owned the plot,? said counsel Guha Thakurta.

 After going through the documents, the court had asked the CMC to demolish the building. ?But due to an unknown reason, the civic body was not active enough in carrying out the directive,? the lawyer claimed. 

 This was the second such ruling in a year; the earlier one had asked the authorities to raze a three-storeyed school building in Behala.

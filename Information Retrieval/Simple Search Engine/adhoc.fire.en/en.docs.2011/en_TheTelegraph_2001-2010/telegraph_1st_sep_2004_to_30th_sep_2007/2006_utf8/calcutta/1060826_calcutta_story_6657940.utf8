 Whats on your mind 

 Leader lack

 Sing-along: Debopam Banerjee of Akshar presents a Rabindrasangeet 

 at the first round of The Telegraph School Awards for 

 Excellence at Vidya Mandir on Wednesday. He later received 

 a Certificate of Honour for outstanding talent. The 

 final round of the awards will be held at the Science 

 City auditorium on Saturday morning. Picture by Sanjoy

 As we Indians proudly celebrated 

 our 59th Independence Day and remembered the legendary leaders 

 of the past, some of the present leaders of our country 

 put us to shame. 

 I was shocked to see on a television news channel that our MPs who went about hoisting the tricolour were not even aware of the order of the colours in the flag. Some singing in praise of Gandhiji did not know his full name.

 Not one out of the several parliamentarians interviewed could answer even the most basic of questions, like who wrote the national anthem. Even my 10-year-old cousin could beat them on this any day! The need of the hour is to scrutinise the educational backgrounds of these ministers.

 Fee fiasco

 Parking is a pain in this city. 

 I have had the worst of arguments with the parking fee people 

 in this regard. One evening, after meeting a few friends 

 at a cafe on Park Street, I was confronted by the parking 

 fee collector when I got into my car. He neither had the 

 rate chart, nor an ID card on him. When I told him that 

 I was in the know that the municipal corporation issued 

 ID cards to them, he simply said he would get his after 

 the polls. He didnt know who he was working under, and 

 also refused to tell me his name. I am sure hundreds of 

 other people in this city face the same kind of harassment.

 Career craze

 The extreme careeristic attitude 

 and growing selfishness amongst students finds expression 

 on various occasions.

 Recently, after the first-year results were announced in a renowned college in north Calcutta, a student of the political science department submitted a medical certificate to the authorities to substantiate why she had not appeared for one of the examinations. 

 Considering that the case was genuine, the department granted her some privilege. At this, some other students pressured the teachers of the department to cancel the girls promotion. Shockingly, these students had been her friends all along and had turned foes as they had not obtained the pass marks in the same examination. Though the teachers didnt bow to their demands, they were taken aback by the selfishness and jealousy of the students. Is ones career greater than friendship?

 Lessons on the House

 The workshop for teachers 

 on mock Parliament sessions in educational institutions. 

 Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya.

A two-day workshop on Youth Parliament 

 Competition Scheme was organised by the state government 

 last month. Teachers and professors in charge of select 

 schools and colleges, respectively, were invited for the 

 session. The objective was to train them about parliamentary 

 democracy and methods of conducting mock Parliaments.

 In the inaugural session the guests 

 discussed the importance of mock parliamentary sessions 

 in educational institutions. On the second day of the workshop, 

 higher education minister Sudarshan Roy Choudhury pointed 

 out that it was necessary for all students to learn more 

 about parliamentary democracy but also warned them against 

 the aberrations in Parliament. 

 Opposition leader Partha Chattopadhyay 

 quoted Roosevelt to elaborate that democracy was not static, 

 it was an everlasting march and hence it was important that 

 the youths of the country take part in the process. 

 Manas Bhunia of the Congress pointed 

 out that most youngsters these days have grown a phobia 

 against politics as it is synonymous with corruption for 

 them. But the view has to be changed to save the democracy 

 and that has to be done from the school level through workshops, 

 he added. Former chief whip of the Assembly Rabin Deb provided 

 guidelines for mock Parliament sessions in educational institutions. 

 The representatives of schools 

 and colleges at the workshop then placed their questions 

 and doubts regarding the youth parliamentary session. A 

 professor of a district college urged that parliamentary 

 studies be made a part of the curriculum.

 THE DAIRY

 Extract

 I would like you to die this moment, 

 before the glares and sneers

 and prejudices can find you

 and drag you out to the dawn, seething;

 before their greedy fangs dig blood

 on the flesh of your back; 

 I would like you to die

 and become a sacred memory,

 a phantom fragrance, a summer night

 dream I can hide in the darkest spires of my eyes... I would 

 like you to die in my arms 

 still warm, unscathed, pure.

 A Hippocrene Gone Dry

 The half-broken moon and 

 the headlights of speeding trucks,

 manufacture...

 A spectrum of loneliness.

 The speed breakers yell out 

 whisper... spasmodically.

 Man turns in his dreams

 the cupboards... of plastic ecstasy

 the saga... of real horrors.

 The dead souls along the purple sky

 orchestrate... broken litanies.

 The wondrous cacophony

 The modern mans lullaby.

 Greeting

 Diamond dew for forehead

 Crown of earned glory

 Each corner of lips curling into 

 butterflies of happiness

 Teardrop peace for you

 You who are still a stranger

 Yet so remembered

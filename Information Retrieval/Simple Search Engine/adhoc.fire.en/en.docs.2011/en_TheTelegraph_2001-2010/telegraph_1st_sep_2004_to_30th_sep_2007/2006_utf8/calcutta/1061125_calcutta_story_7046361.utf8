 robs hearts 

 - Sequel opens to full houses but fails to set screens ablaze

 SCRIPT-SAVER: Hrithik Roshan in Dhoom 2

 He did not emerge as the twist in the cops-and-robbers tale at the end of the film, but John Abraham still got the loudest cheer at the packed first-day-first-show of Dhoom 2 in town. Despite Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai, Abhishek Bachchan and Bipasha Basu, the bad guy of Dhoom sent the otherwise sedate INOX (Forum) crowd into a tizzy when he appeared in the Kabul Express trailer before D:2.

 Calcutta went all out to welcome the second Dhoom film on Friday but clearly missed John. Its like a Munnabhai sequel without Circuit, grumbled an audience member. 

 As the replacement robber, Hrithik does dance like a dream and his stunts have a lot of steam, but thats not enough to save the script, or rather the lack of it.

 Sure, the most-awaited film of the year opened big huge, actually, with most screens sure of 100 per cent occupancy for the weekend but there was no missing the murmurs of disappointment as the reels rolled on.

 And worse, sniggers and boos greeted the hottest scene of the film Hrithik and Ash in a liplock. Yes, she does surprise by her first real on-screen kiss no wonder Abhishek goes through the film with a perpetual frown but just like her half-baked character, even her kiss is half-blown.

 If the babes disappoint Ash looks hot but acts cold; Bipasha in Baywatch gear has precious little to do either in Mumbai or in Brazil and speaks all of two lines in Bengali the bikes are missing in action. The mean machines, which made Dhoom the movie of 2004, do not hit the screen till the climactic chase.

 But by the time the word of Dhoom 2 not matching up to Dhoom spreads, the box-office would have been won and another sequel planned, thanks to the 1,200-plus prints released worldwide.

 The Friday opening has been tremendous in cities and suburbs alike and the first weekend is sure to go house-full everywhere, said Kushagra Jalan, the films east India distributor. Thats three-fourth of the battle won, since we have released the film so wide.

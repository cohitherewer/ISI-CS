The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 Recently while returning from the Dum Dum airport, I boarded 

 a prepaid taxi and was asked to pay Rs 121 as the fare till 

 Nagerbazar. This is quite unusual because according to the 

 taxi rate card displayed at the airport, the fare for areas 

 within 6 km from the airport is Rs 63. Nagerbazar is not 

 more than 5 km from the airport. At the same time, they 

 charge the same fare till Private Road bus stop which is 

 not more than 6 km from the airport. I would request the 

 authorities to look into the matter.

 There are no direct buses to Salt Lake from Hazra Road 

 area. As a result, people working in Salt Lake, especially 

 techies, have a tough time reaching office. Earlier, there 

 was a mini bus plying from Salt Lake to the zoo, which was 

 stopped. I request the authorities to look into the matter 

 and re-introduce the mini-bus service.

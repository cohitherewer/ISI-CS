The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Recharge without cash card

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Telephones has introduced a docking landline system to enable its pre-paid cellphone users, with a BSNL landline connection, to recharge their sets anywhere in India without buying a cash card.

 The recharge value will be added to the subscribers landline bill.

 CalTel has 13 lakh landline and more than 5.5 lakh cellphone connections in the city.

 There are two preconditions for availing of this scheme, introduced in end-September, CalTel general manager (customer relation and sales) Salil Kumar Bhaduri said on Monday. The user must have a landline connection in his name at home or in office and the telephone bill must be Rs 500 or more.

 For enrolling in the scheme, a cellphone user will have to fill up a registration form, available from local customer service centres. It will take a day or two to get the landline number registered with the docking service.

 For recharging, the user will have to dial a toll-free number, 18003456060, and mention the recharge denomination. The phone will be recharged automatically.

 CalTel has also launched two more plans for cellphone users under the Ananta scheme: a new user will get a one-time talktime of Rs 100 and all subscribers will be able to talk to any two specified numbers at a lower call rate. One of these numbers must be of a landline connection.

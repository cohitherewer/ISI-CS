 HS council nod for grades

 - Five-point scale okayed, rule changed for additional subject 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Wednesday finalised its decision to implement grades and scrap divisions from next year?s Higher Secondary (HS) examinations.

 The council had called an emergency meeting, at which the proposal to assess students with grades was unanimously approved by the members.

 ?HS marksheets will look completely different from next year,? said council president Gopa Dutta after the meeting. ?There will be no mention of division or aggregate in the marksheets. Instead, they will show grades and the marks obtained by students in individual subjects.? 

 The council members on Wednesday approved a five-point gradation scale. According to a section of council officials, some teachers? bodies had proposed a nine-point scale. 

 Under the five-point scale, students scoring between 80 and 100 will be awarded A+ (excellent). Those securing between 60 and 79 will be graded A (very good). Those scoring between 59 and 45 will be placed in grade B (good). Students obtaining marks between 30 and 44 will get a grade C (satisfactory). The final grade will be D (disqualified), for those scoring less than 30.

 Since divisions are being scrapped, successful candidates will be described only as ?passed?. Marksheets of unsuccessful examinees will proclaim ?disqualified?.

 To clear HS, students will have to score at least 30 in six subjects, including the two languages (first and second), three elective subjects and environmental education. It will not be mandatory to pass the additional subject.

 The council on Wednesday also abolished the system of deducting 30 from the score in each of the additional subject papers.

 ?We have brought about thorough changes in syllabi, question pattern, teaching techniques and examination system, in tune with the system adopted by many other boards in the country. A thorough revision of the form of marksheets was necessary to match the revised structure,? Dutta observed.

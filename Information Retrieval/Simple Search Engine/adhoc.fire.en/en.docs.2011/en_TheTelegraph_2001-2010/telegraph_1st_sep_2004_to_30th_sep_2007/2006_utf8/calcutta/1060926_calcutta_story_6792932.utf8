 Automatic pay- amp;-use public toilets plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI) is planning to bring hi-tech, continuously-disinfected, automatic-pay toilets to the city.

 We are talking to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) for setting up 14 pay-and-use public toilets, said Shanta Ghosh, recently-elected BNCCI president and vice-chairperson of the Development Consultants group of companies. One or more members of the BNCCI will sponsor each of these public toilets.

 According to Ghosh, some of the toilets will be automatic-pay, modular structures that are generally seen abroad, while the others will be conventional toilets.

 The automatic toilets will be like pay phones. When you drop a coin, the door will open, she explained.

 The BNCCI has not yet decided how many of the proposed toilets will be regular brick-and-mortar structures. 

 Vice-president of the chamber K.K. Navada said: The CMC will have to find us the spots where the toilets will be set up. The civic body is expected to decide on the location of the toilets post-Puja.

 The chamber has other community projects in mind. In association with the civic body, we want to build some hostels for single and working women, said Ghosh, referring to the growing number of single women in the city in the wake of the information technology boom.

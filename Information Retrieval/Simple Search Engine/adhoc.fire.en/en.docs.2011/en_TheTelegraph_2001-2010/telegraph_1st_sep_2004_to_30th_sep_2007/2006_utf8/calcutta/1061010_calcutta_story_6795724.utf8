 SUBHRO SAHA

 A 

 THOUGHT FOR FOOD

 Dishes from the revised 

 menu at Ivory 

 Burnt Ginger Cashew Prawn, Baby 

 Corn Mushroom Red Pepper, Minty Lemon Chicken or Gosht Parcha 

 Kabab for starters. Seafood Meatball Soup or Mexican Broth 

 to warm up for the real action. Guti Gobi Teen Mirch, Murgh 

 Jahangari, Kung Pao King Prawn or Lamb Patty Florentine 

 for the main course...

 Ivory (formerly Grain of Salt) 

 at 22 Camac Street is reinventing itself by revamping 40 

 per cent of its menu mix, with the dessert dossier set to 

 morph almost 75 per cent.

 The focus remains multi-cuisine 

 and unlike last time when only our Oriental section was 

 changed, we are now overhauling the Indian and World cuisine 

 line-up as well, says Arvind Bhatnagar, executive 

 director, operations, PDK Shenaz Group, the company that 

 owns the Ivory brand.

 The popular lunch buffet spread 

 will have some changes to it too, with kebabs being added 

 to the meal matrix. At the end of the day, what you 

 got earlier is what you will get now. We have just increased 

 the options and given the menu a fresh feel, even customising 

 items based on feedback from our patrons, adds Nitin 

 Kohli, director of the group.

 So starters now have additions 

 like the Mongolian Spicy Chicken (chicken flavoured with 

 five spices), Creole-Stuffed Mushrooms (marinated fresh 

 mushrooms in lime and black pepper and fried) and Murgh 

 Kandahri (chicken cubes enriched with kaju, cream 

 and cheese).

 For the main course, there are 

 fresh items like Sliced Chicken Peking Style (pot-roasted 

 chicken), Spinach Crepe Cheesy Vegetables (green pancake 

 with cheesy vegetables) and Bhutte Da Gosht (succulent mutton 

 and corn tossed Mughlai style).

 Sweet surprises come in the shape 

 of Cashew Cinnamon Custard, Almond Citrus Cheese Cake, Caramel 

 Nougat Kulfi and others.

 We are extremely particular, 

 almost fussy, about hygiene, purity, freshness of all ingredients 

 and about being environment-friendly, and we have just completed 

 our ISO surveillance audit, stresses Kohli.

 The eatery had bagged the trophy 

 triumvirate ISO 9001:2000 for quality management systems, 

 ISO 14001:2004 for environment management systems, and HACCP 

 (Hazard Analysis at Critical Control Points) for the highest 

 international food-safety norms, a first for any standalone 

 independent restaurant property in India. While 

 HACCP has stood us in good stead, helping put highly evolved 

 systems in place, our Singapore experience has opened our 

 eyes to the latest global trends in the F amp;B industry. 

 Our senior kitchen team in Calcutta also regularly browses 

 the Net to track these trends, says Pankaj Tandon, 

 managing director, PDK Shenaz Singapore Pte Ltd, the groups 

 Singapore property launched early last month.

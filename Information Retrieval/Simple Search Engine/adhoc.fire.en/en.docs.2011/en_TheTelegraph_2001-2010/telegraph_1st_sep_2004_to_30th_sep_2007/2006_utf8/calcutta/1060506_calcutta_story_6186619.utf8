 Minus men, 

 loads of fun 

 - More spaces, public and private, for girls-only nights out

 Some danced on the podium and the window-sills, others cheered and clapped, the rest just gaped and gulped. But all of them were just being themselves, and why not? After all, this was a room full of ladies at the ladies? only night in Venom, the new night haunt on Camac Street.

 The extra rush of adrenaline could be explained by the only men in the house ? ?male performers? Kamlaksh and Hasnain from Mumbai, who did the Half Monty. Even the organisers were ?pleasantly surprised? by the full-throated turnout of 250-plus. ?The guests were initially apprehensive, but they soon loosened up,? said Sonali Sethi from Venom. The ?real cause? of the super success, reasoned proprietor Bunty Sethi, was ?the total absence of men?.

 No men please is the fun mantra as girls just wanna have some fun, girlie style. And now they are finding spaces, public and private, to do just that, with the men frequently reduced to the role of chauffeurs.

 So, what exactly makes a girls-only night out? Complimentary drinks (shooters, Breezers, wine-based cocktails), loads of song requests and lots of dancing (to Bollywood beats), endless gossip (from saas to Sourav) and uninhibited fun ? with men out of sight, but definitely not out of mind.

 ?The fact that men were out of bounds truly made the evening perfect. No one was conscious about how they were looking or behaving simply because no one was really watching,? laughed photographer Ruchita Jain, 33, fresh out of the Venom party.

 It all began with Anticlock and later Tantra, serving up girls-only nights on Wednesdays and Fridays. Over time, Wednesday nights became linked to the ladies at other party places like Big Ben and Underground.

 And now, the all-girl fun is stepping beyond the nightclub arena. A growing ?me-time? brigade ? girls determined to make some time for themselves ? have just discovered the therapeutic joys of spa parties.

 ?It is so much fun. Girls getting together for a pedicure, back rub or facial against the backdrop of soft lighting, fluffy towels and strawberries with champagne,? smiles Saumya Singh, a regular at such weekday private bashes.

 The city, say the party people, is growing up and allowing girls to have fun the way they want it: unplugged.

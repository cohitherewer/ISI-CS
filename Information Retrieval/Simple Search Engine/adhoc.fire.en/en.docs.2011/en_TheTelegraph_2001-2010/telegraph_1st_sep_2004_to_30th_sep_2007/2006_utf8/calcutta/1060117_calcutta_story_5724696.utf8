 Calcutta High Court will soon have a state-of-the-art, four-bed medical unit. Two experienced doctors and four medical staff will run the facility.

 Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar is scheduled to inaugurate the unit next week.

 People falling ill on the premises have so far been treated at a tiny clinic on the first floor of the court building. A doctor and a medical staff operate the clinic.

 ?The sole doctor has to attend to patients in the city sessions court and the New Secretariat Building, too. Sometimes, he is even called to Writers? Buildings,? said an advocate of the high court.

 Lawyers and staff of the court have long been demanding a proper medical set-up on the premises. The demand intensified last year after an advocate suffered a heart attack during court hours and later died. It was alleged that he could not be properly treated due to lack of facilities.

 ?The state government has funded the medical unit. However, our demand for an ambulance has not been met. Last year, at least 80 persons fell seriously ill during court hours. All of them had to be rushed to hospital in advocates? cars or taxis,? stated Sunil Das, a high court staff member.

 A former secretary of the high court Bar Association said: ?The new unit will not be able to serve our purpose. There should be a stock of life-saving drugs and sufficient staff members in the unit. Unless an ambulance is provided, the facility will be of no use.?

 According to the high court police, on an average day, 7,000 lawyers, 4,000 employees and 9,000 litigants visit the premises. Since there aren?t any medical facilities in the city civil and sessions court and the New Secretariat, the high court medical unit will have to cover those areas also.

 ?It is unlikely that the new set-up will serve its purpose,? opined a police officer.

 According to the state law department sources, Rs 8 lakh has been allotted for the first phase of the medical unit. ?There are a lot of proposals. The new unit will be developed in the near future,? claimed a high court source.

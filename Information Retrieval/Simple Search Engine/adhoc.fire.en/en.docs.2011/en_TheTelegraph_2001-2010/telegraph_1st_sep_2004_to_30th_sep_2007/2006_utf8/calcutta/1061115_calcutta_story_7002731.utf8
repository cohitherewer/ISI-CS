The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

 Being real is boring 

 Screen On 

 amp; Off

 Pratim D. Gupta

 Boman Irani on screen is not much 

 different from Boman Irani off it. And thats not the only 

 thing that makes him our very own Jack Nicholson. Just like 

 Jack had said during the making of Stanley Kubricks The 

 Shining, Boman admitted on Tuesday afternoon: Being 

 real is great, but it is also very boring for the audience!

 And thats why the actor who does 

 loads of research to get into the skin of his varied characters 

 Dr Asthana, Lucky Singh, DCP DSilva brings that something 

 extra to touch people in a special way. On Tuesday it was 

 Bomans turn to touch the hearts of visually challenged 

 kids who had gathered at the Bhawanipur Gujarati Education 

 Society (picture above by Aranya Sen) to watch a 

 special audio-described screening of Munnabhai MBBS.

 The Childrens Day event was organised 

 by Trinayani Welfare Trust in association with National 

 Association of the Blind, Calcutta Metropolitan Round Table 

 No 41 and Calcutta Metropolitan Ladies Circle No 65.

 Jetlagged like a beast, Boman 

 flew in straight from New York to attend the screening. 

 Through my films I have got more than I deserve and I want 

 to give it back to people who matter, he said. 

 If Boman was in Calcutta for the 

 special screening of Munnabhai MBBS, he was in New 

 York for the special UN screening of Lage Raho Munnabhai. 

 I believe this was the first time a commercial Indian film 

 was screened at the United Nations, Boman said. It was 

 so good to see the audience, 80 per cent Whites, crying 

 and laughing throughout. Imagine, they were just reacting 

 to the subtitles!

 Boman feels Lage Raho Munnabhai 

 has taken a life of its own and its therapeutic effect is 

 unique. What is happening is just beyond cinema, he said. 

 We do not set out to make movies to change peoples lives 

 but this film has done that and beyond. It has become an 

 epiphany of sorts.

 So, even though Boman is fresh 

 from his evil screen persona in Don, he prefers to 

 keep rambling about his stint as the Sardar in Lage Raho... 

 While coming to this event I had a telephonic chat with 

 director Rajkumar Hirani and we are planning to add a commentary 

 audio channel to the DVD of the film when it comes out.

 Boman is proud that these days 

 his fans dont call him Mamu but give him Get well soon 

 cards. To break an image you have to disappoint the audiences, 

 he revealed. Throughout Don, I felt everyone was 

 expecting me to crack a joke but I didnt.

 And taking an envious filmography 

 forward, Boman (who couldnt fulfil his Calcutta ambition 

 of going to Flurys on Tuesday), will now be seen in Reema 

 Kagtis Honeymoon Travels Pvt Ltd and Vidhu Vinod 

 Chopras Eklavya.

 It?s time for Calcuttans with roots in Rajasthan to root for Rajasthan as a tourist spot.

 The two Indian states that attract the maximum number of tourists have been in the news for wrong reasons ? terror and torment.

 The grenade attack on tourist buses in Kashmir and the rape of tourists in the desert state have created a fear psychosis among prospective visitors in Bengal.

 To arrest a dip in the tourist flow to Rajasthan and highlight some of the positives of the state, the Marwari community in Calcutta is spreading awareness among people who might visit Rajasthan from Bengal. 

 ?The number of tourists visiting Rajasthan has been rising at a steady rate of 57 per cent every year. Among the tourists, 17 per cent are from the country. People from Bengal account for six per cent of the visitors. We want more and more people from the state to visit Rajasthan, which is considered a Mecca for tourists,? said Harimohan Bangur, president of Rajasthan Foundation, Calcutta.

 The biggest step to curb crime against tourists in Rajasthan was taken when the Tourists Assistance Force (TAF) was formed in 2004. It comprises former Indian Police Service officers and army personnel. TAF reports directly to the Union ministry of tourism.

 ?TAF is an unarmed force that was conceptualised in 2000 and came into being in 2004. The members do not carry arms, hence they have access to all the religious and cultural tourist spots. They have set up booths in several places to provide information to tourists about the spot and medical assistance. TAF also rescues tourists in distress,? explained Sundeep Bhutoria, secretary of Rajasthan Foundation, Calcutta.

 The present strength of TAF is 180. According to plans, the number will be doubled in the next two years. 

 The Rajasthani community is also trying to promote new attractions in the state to lure more tourists. ?The Palace on Wheels is a very big draw. Its tickets are booked for the next four years. The government of Rajasthan has now started the Shekhawati Express for tourists. The Karnavati and Shekhawati belt is being aggressively marketed amongst the tourists,? added Bhutoria.

 Efforts are also being made to highlight the security factor among tourists, both domestic and foreign. ?Rajasthan Foundation has always been at the forefront of a movement to spread development and harmony. We do not want Rajasthan, and India, to lose its image of being tourist-friendly just because some elements are trying to take advantage of the vulnerable tourists,? stressed Bangur.

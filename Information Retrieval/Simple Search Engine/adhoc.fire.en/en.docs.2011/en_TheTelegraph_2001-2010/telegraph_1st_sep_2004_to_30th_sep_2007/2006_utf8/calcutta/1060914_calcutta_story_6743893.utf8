 Promoters draw court ire

 - Municipality ordered to raze illegal structure in car park

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed South Dum Dum Municipality to demolish within four weeks an unauthorised structure constructed by a promoter in the Nager Bazar area. 

 The court also minced no words in hauling up promoters for threatening flat-owners who objected to such illegal constructions in their housing estates.

 This has become a common practice. Promoters are illegally constructing buildings on the space allotted for car parks. The municipal authorities should take serious note of these matters, as many flat-owners are being harassed by the promoters, Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya observed, while passing the order.

 The court frown followed a petition moved by Subir Das, who had purchased a flat on plot no. 432, Kabi Nabin Chandra Sen Road, in the Nager Bazar area, which was constructed by Space Forum, a real estate firm.

 The promoter and the owner of Space Forum had allegedly shown an open area as the parking lot of the housing estate and later started constructing another building on the plot. Das claimed that even the original building plan had the space allotted for car parking. 

 Three months ago, my client (Das) noticed that the promoter had started constructing a building on the 1,000 sq ft area for a car park. Despite repeated requests, the promoter continued with the illegal construction. Though my client moved South Dum Dum Municipality, the authorities didnt take any action, Uttam Majumdar, lawyer appearing for Das, informed the court.

 He added that the promoter hired goons to prevent Das from raising further objection to the construction. My client informed Nager Bazar police. But again, no action was taken.

 Majumdar told the court that many promoters in the city were cheating the occupants of their housing blocks, by constructing buildings on the plots allotted to them and later selling them. 

 One promoter of a big housing estate on Sarat Bose Road had sold out the ground floor of the building to business establishments. Surprisingly, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had issued licences and allowed the trading houses to carry on business. Later, the civic body was forced to cancel the licences after the flat-owners of the building approached the high court, the lawyer told the court.

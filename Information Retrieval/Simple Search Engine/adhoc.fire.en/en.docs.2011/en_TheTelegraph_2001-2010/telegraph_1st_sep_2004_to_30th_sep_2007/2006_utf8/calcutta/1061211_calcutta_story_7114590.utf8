 Wolfgang Haffner: Groove drumming

 If winters here, jazz cant be far behind in Calcutta.

 The Wolfgang Haffner quartet from Germany brings the curtains up on the season with an open-air concert on the St Xaviers College grounds (Wednesday, December 13, 6.30 pm).

 Organised by the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) Calcutta in association with St Xaviers College Alumni Association and Congo Square on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, this will be the last concert for the group on its tour of South Asia.

 The band features front-man Wolfgang Haffner on drums, Sebastian Studnitzky on trumpet and keyboard, Frank Kuruc on guitar and Christian Diener on bass. Before the Calcutta stop, they are performing in Karachi, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Dhaka.

 Haffner is one of the most prominent of the new generation of German jazz musicians who can move comfortably between different styles and techniques. He is an internationalist, a German globetrotter in the matter of drums and jazz, says Martin Wlde, MMB director.

 He was only 18 when he received a call from legendary German trombonist Albert Mangelsdorff who invited him to join his band. For nearly 20 years, Haffner played the drums beside the reigning trombone world champion as the people of Frankfurt affectionately called their beloved Albert who passed away in 2005.

 Haffner has recorded with a range of illustrious American artistes from Michael Franks to Gato Barbieri besides featuring extensively with US stars including Pat Metheny, Michael and Randy Brecker, Mike Stern and Joe Sample, Lalo Schifrin, Cassandra Wilson and Billy Cobham. 

 I play differently, more groove-based. The music I make differs from that of most other German drummers. For example, when I play a simple 4/4 with brushes, most people sit up and listen because it sounds completely new. Of course, I also freak out when I hear grandiose double bass drumming, but thats just not my thing, Haffner said in a recent interview. 

 With his present quartet, Haffner plays groove-based music, which focuses on the smooth interaction between bass and drums to produce clear rhythmic motives. In Shapes, the current album, the band celebrates a kind of contemporary jazz-rock, that is also like dance music influenced by hip-hop, trip hop and by the Norwegian scene.

 A band is a team and must act as one. I have worked with so many bands. Some of them had fantastic individual musicians who were popular with the crowd, but they didnt gel as a band, Haffner, who has 11 albums in his own name, said.

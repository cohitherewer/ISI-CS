The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 They shone bright on showbiz night

 The Fairever Anandalok Puroshkar 2006 at the Science City auditorium on Saturday evening was a blend of spirited performance and starry presence. Here are a few glimpses of the Bolly brigade

 Tollywoods hero no. 1 Prosenjit handed over the 

 Best Actress (Hindi films) award to Bipasha Basu for Corporate. 

 While Bipasha didnt go up on stage to accept John 

 Abrahams award for Most Promising Star, she did seem 

 delighted to be honoured in her home town. Ekhane 

 eshe khub bhalo lagchhe, smiled Bips. Prosenjit himself 

 won the Best Actor (Bengali films) award for Dosar after 

 his song-and-dance tribute to 75 years of playback in Tollywood

 Shveta Salve and Eijaz Khan flew in from Mumbai to stage 

 a homage to Bollywood music directors. Dancing to songs 

 from Awara hoon to Raat baki to Kajra re, the duo came up 

 with a spirited shake-a-leg. The finalists of Fairever Nayikar 

 Khonje, a talent hunt conducted by Anandalok to find a new 

 face for Bengali films, gave a lively performance too, with 

 winner Subhashree.

 The petite beauty Amrita Rao spoke bits of Bengali as she 

 received the Most Promising Actress trophy for Vivah.

 Rakesh Roshan became emotional as he accepted the Best 

 Director (Hindi films) trophy for Krrish. I received 

 the same award in 2003 for Koi... Mil Gaya and here I am 

 again. Hope this relationship continues, he said. 

 Papa Roshan also collected the Best Actor (Hindi films) 

 trophy on behalf of Hrithik, who won for his superheroic 

 act in Krrish.

 Upen Patel won his first ever acting award when he was crowned 

 the Best Male Debutant for 36 China Town. I dont 

 know what to say, he admitted even as the crowd clapped 

 loud and long. Kangana Ranaut, who won the Best Female Debutant 

 award for Gangster, couldnt make it to Calcutta

 It was K.K. who made Saturday a night to remember rendering 

 his chartbusters back-to-back. Coming in at the start and 

 then at the very end, the singer had the crowds dancing 

 in the aisles as he belted out everything from Dus bahaane 

 and Tuhi meri shab to Its the time to disco and Kya 

 yeh pyar hai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Boy mowed down by bus

 - Rash driving near school claims life on holiday-eve

 A STAFF REPORTER

On 

 the second last day of school before Puja holidays, Shiv 

 Kumar Mahato, 15, was crushed to death by a private bus 

 at the approach road to Taratala bridge on Wednesday morning. 

 Mahato was a Class X student of Alipore Tankshal Vidyapith.

 The boy was on his way to school when the accident occurred. He, along with a younger student of the same school, got off the bus near Taratala bridge. They then tried to make their way towards the pavement when suddenly, another bus hit Mahato and killed him on the spot. 

 The accident, around 10.30 am, was a result of rash driving. We have been able to trace the vehicle that killed the boy and also the driver, said S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas). 

 The other boy, who was with Mahato when the accident occurred, was safe but he lost consciousness out of shock. His parents later took him home.

 A resident of Bakultala, Mahato was a meritorious student. He came second in Class IX last year. The teachers of his school had high expectations of him this year, as he was going to appear for his Madhyamik.

 He was a very good student. He would come to us if he faced any problem. This year, he was to appear for the board examination and he was working very hard to score good grades, said his science teacher, Mukesh Mahato.

 The boys father, Rajkumar Mahato, owns a small roll shop at the Bakultala crossing. Both his parents run the shop together. Mahato has a younger sister, who is seven.

 He was a very nice boy. His father worked hard to send him to school. He was getting ready to celebrate the Puja in his locality, said Mohan Rajput, a neighbour of the family.

 The school is in a congested stretch of road. There is often a rush of students and of vehicles. It is unfortunate that we have to live with rash driving, added Rajput.

 After the accident, agitated residents of the area stopped vehicles and even smashed the windscreen of a private bus. But there was no traffic disruption. At 11.30 am, Mahatos body was shifted to Vidyasagar Hospital, Behala. The body was handed over to his family around 5.30 pm.

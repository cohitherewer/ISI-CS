The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Now, clinics get a watchdog

 - Accreditation board to monitor facilities and functioning of private healthcare players

 KINSUK BASU

 Swank corridors, dirty bed linen. Plush waiting rooms, slack personal care. A long list of doctors, not too many around during an emergency?

 It?s time nursing homes, or at least some of them, stopped duping patients by making false claims, the Centre has decided. It will soon appoint a watchdog to keep a vigil on the facilities they provide.

 After working out an accreditation process for pathological laboratories, the Centre is putting in place a similar system for private hospitals. At a meeting held a week ago, the government had decided to set up a body ? National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) ? to look into the functioning of the private players.

 Officials said the board will accredit private hospitals after ensuring that they comply with its guidelines, comprising more than 200 categories. The parameters include the number of doctors at a clinic, their academic records, patient-doctor ratio, medical technology in use, facilities at the intensive care unit and in the emergency ward, and patient care in terms of diet, housekeeping and laundry. 

 The board, to be headed by former All India Institute of Medical Sciences chairman P.K. Dave, will also look into the standards of hygiene and waste management and steps taken to fight infection.

 ?This should bring about a sea change in the way some clinics are operating,? said Sajal Dutta, president of the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India, the largest body of private hospitals in the city, with 13 institutions under its wing. ?The best part of the move is that all clinics will have to follow certain standards. There will be a system of accountability.?

 The association will meet on February 16 to discuss the issue.

 ?We will surely implement the guidelines, which will be a boon for private hospitals,? said Satadal Saha, vice-president of AMRI Hospitals (Salt Lake).

 Sudipta Mitra, medical superintendent of Peerless Hospitals, said: ?Accreditation will be the best way to gain the trust of those who prefer hospitals outside the state to private healthcare in the city. Besides, medical insurance companies, too, will want private hospitals to follow certain norms. The other factor we need to keep in mind is medical tourism. For city-based nursing homes, this is the best possible move towards standardisation of service.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Dreamer and 

 destroyer

 He is certainly in love with himself, 

 this middle-aged rake with the time-shined suit and the 

 gaunt, unshaven face. Or is it that he holds himself in 

 even more contempt than he does the rest of the world? Either 

 way, the narcissism is overwhelming.

 Playing the title role in Brian 

 Friel?s great play Faith Healer, which opened in 

 a mesmerising revival at the Booth Theater, Ralph Fiennes 

 paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer 

 that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it 

 might be painted in wet blood. The self-lacerating vanity 

 that has always been central to Fiennes?s presence as a 

 film actor (The Constant Gardener, The English 

 Patient) has rarely been put to such powerful use.

 This shrewd channelling of his 

 glamorously peevish star shine may finally get Faith 

 Healer, a production from the Gate Theater of Dublin, 

 directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent, the New 

 York audience it deserves. 

 First (and last) seen on Broadway 

 in 1979 for a mere 20 performances, Faith Healer is 

 a dense and lyrical series of monologues, a form little 

 loved by action-hungry American theatregoers. Yet anyone 

 who starts listening, with full attention, to the words 

 ? and, just as important, the silences ? of the three characters 

 who tell their horrible, fantastic and oddly familiar story 

 should be fatally hooked.

 Faith Healer is the unforgiving 

 and exalting tale of Frank Hardy (Fiennes) and his wife 

 Grace, and manager Teddy. Frank is an itinerant, erratic 

 healer of the sick in small towns throughout the British 

 Isles.

 An Irishman in self-imposed exile, 

 Frank is an egocentric, hard-drinking, irresistible man 

 who is so suspicious of his talent and so afraid of losing 

 it that he makes everyone around him suffer. You?ve heard 

 all this before, no doubt, in books, films and plays about 

 artistes like Ernest Hemingway, Dylan Thomas and Diane Arbus, 

 brilliant souls crucified on their own talent. 

 The play is a mystery story in 

 both the mundane and spiritual senses. Though each of the 

 narrators tells essentially the same tale in four soliloquies 

 (Frank speaks first and last), their accounts disagree in 

 ways that leave us dizzy. 

 Fiennes plays up the showman in 

 Frank. There are vestiges here of Laurence Olivier as the 

 decaying music hall performer in John Osborne?s Entertainer, 

 conveying the same mixed urges to ingratiate and alienate.

 Simon double bill Neil 

 Simon returns to one of his favourite hunting grounds ? 

 Calcutta ? with a brace. Regular readers of this column 

 will recall that he is the most-staged contemporary dramatist 

 in this city: my statistics over the last 20 years as reviewer 

 for The Telegraph reveal that he ranks after Tagore, 

 Shakespeare and Brecht in total number of productions, including 

 imports from other cities. Of course, he has been performed 

 mainly in English. The day Bengali and Hindi groups dump 

 their aversion to American authors and discover his seriocomic 

 societal talents, he is guaranteed to overtake some of the 

 others. 

 The two plays last week, Spotlight?s 

 Broadway Bound and Proscenium?s Chapter Two, 

 belong to the later half of Simon?s career, when he grew 

 introspective, shelved the hilarious situations and dialogue 

 that had made him famous, and began composing more intense 

 semi-autobiographical drama tinted with comedy. Chapter 

 Two (1977) heralded this change, wrought by the premature 

 loss of his wife to cancer in 1973, followed by his relationship 

 with Marsha Mason, an actress whom he eventually married 

 and who starred in it. Hence its title.

 Considered his best work by some 

 for its exploration of love, it presents a writer who cannot 

 get over his wife?s death and rejects his brother?s encouragement 

 to play the field, until by chance he phones a newly-divorced 

 actress who also has no desire to start dating again.

 The director, Ashoke Viswanathan, 

 had acted in Spandan?s version 10 years ago, compared to 

 which this comes off second-best. In the lead, his own performance 

 (despite inconsistencies between American and British accents) 

 and that of Bulan Lahiri acceptably express the conflicting 

 emotions the older lovers feel. But the foil couple of Udita 

 and Indrarup Chakraborty turn into caricatures because they 

 just try too hard. Viswanathan?s choice of music, too, is 

 terribly banal.

 In 1986, Simon completed his autobiographical 

 trilogy with Broadway Bound (preceded by Brighton 

 Beach Memoirs and Biloxi Blues), which deals 

 with his initiation into scripting comic radio scenarios 

 partnered by his older brother Danny. We see his Jewish 

 family disintegrating in front of his eyes because of his 

 father?s extramarital affair, which in turn induces the 

 sons to leave as soon their big break comes.

 The two who stay at home the most 

 and try to patch up things domestically ? Simon?s grandfather 

 and mother ? receive the best portrayals. Pradip Mitra outshines 

 himself as the former, the genial paterfamilias everyone 

 would love to have, whose humour Simon clearly inherited. 

 Cultivating a one-sided smile and aged voice, Mitra seems 

 quite ready to step into grand-paternal shoes himself. Rita 

 Roy sensitively expresses the wronged wife?s angst. But 

 the others do not reach their levels. By just looking pained, 

 Arya Gupta cannot adequately convey the husband?s dilemma. 

 The sons strangely turn out one-dimensional: Dhruv Mookerji 

 simply obsessed with making it to Broadway, and Bikram Ghosh 

 wandering around with a fixed smirk, as his bad habit of 

 finding his own character?s jokes funny becomes irritating. 

 However, Gitanjali Jolly designs an impressively elaborate 

 two-level interior. 

 The litmus test of success with 

 Simon lies in delivery of his one-liners, very American 

 in their allusive irony and carefree kidding. Neither production 

 captures their subtle tonality right. 

 In Spotlight?s case, their practice 

 of not designating a director (Cedric Spanos receives credit 

 as ?friend, philosopher and guide?) may have added to this 

 problem, compounded by the fact that nearly everyone forgets 

 their words at one time or another.

 Troupe tour

 The performing wing of Kalamandalam, 

 the Bharatanatyam training centre, had its first Singapore 

 tour in May 2006. The dance school was invited by Tagore 

 Society in Singapore to perform Rabindranath Tagore?s dance 

 ballet Chitrangada at Victoria Theatre, as part of 

 the poet?s birth anniversary celebrations. 

 They also performed Chandalika 

 at Little India in Singapore. The 12-member troupe was 

 led by Guru Thankamani Kutty.

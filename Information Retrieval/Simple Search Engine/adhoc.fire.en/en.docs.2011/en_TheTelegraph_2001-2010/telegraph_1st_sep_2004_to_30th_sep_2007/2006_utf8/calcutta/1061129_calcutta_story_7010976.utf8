The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Pills to party, risks be damned

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Work hard all day, party harder all night and do not forget to pop that pill in between. This is the credo a section of city youngsters live by.

 The driving force of these party regulars: drugs like amphetamines (speed) and Ecstasy (love drug). The banned substances are gaining currency among revellers because of their psycho-stimulating and hallucinogenic properties. They influence the central nervous system and provide a sense of energy. 

 According to the party people, the primary reason behind the popularity of these drugs is their ability to provide an instant high and energy after a hard days toil.

 The work schedules are extremely hectic. Some people put in more than 12 hours at office, which leaves them with little energy for anything else. But partying is as important as work for some of these people. They take these drugs to get back into action, says the DJ at a popular discotheque in south Calcutta.

 The party drugs are becoming increasingly popular among the call-centre crowd. Young people, who have recently started partying, are also taking these drugs, he adds.

 According to the DJs and bartenders at nightclubs, the number of pills popped goes up on special occasions such as the New Years eve.

 There are other reasons for the popularity of party drugs. Their easy availability has played a part as has the fact that most young professionals can afford them.

 The party drugs cost between Rs 500 and Rs 1,500. There is a group of boys in Ripon Street, Free School Street and Park Circus, who peddle these pills, says a bartender in a nightclub. 

 Peer pressure, too, is to blame. There are many who pop the pills to blend in with their group.

 Doctors warn of the dangers of using party drugs. The pills affect the central nervous system and provide people virtual energy, says Dr Arpan Chaudhuri, attached to the CMRI and Westbank hospitals.

 As soon as these substances enter the system they raise the blood pressure and increase the heartbeat. In extreme cases, a person can even die under the influence of these drugs, adds the doctor.

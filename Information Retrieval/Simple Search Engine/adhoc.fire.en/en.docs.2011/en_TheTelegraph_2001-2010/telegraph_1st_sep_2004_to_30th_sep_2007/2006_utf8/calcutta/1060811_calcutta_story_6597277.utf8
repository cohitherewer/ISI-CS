The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

On amp; Off

Twist in the tale

Screen On amp; Off

 Heres something by way of an add-on when you queue up at Fame (Hiland Park) for the 6 pm show of Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna on Friday. Lallan, the funky prankster of Filmy, will be there to introduce the film as Rukh Rukh Khan. You also need to brush up your film-related GK because the simpleton from Jaunpur will be fielding questions at the interval with gifts up for grabs. 

 As part of a tie-up between Filmy, the movie channel from the Sahara stable, and the Karan Johar film, Sunil Grover, who plays Lallan, will do some stand-up comedy around KANK. He will impersonate the superstars of the movie playing both Rukh Rukh Khan and Amitabh Bachpan to add some spice to the proceedings. 

 We will also be going to Delhi, Indore, Mumbai and Pune, adds Grover, who has done cameos in films like Family, The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Pyar To Hona Hi Tha. I had introduced Krrish in many theatres and got a great response.

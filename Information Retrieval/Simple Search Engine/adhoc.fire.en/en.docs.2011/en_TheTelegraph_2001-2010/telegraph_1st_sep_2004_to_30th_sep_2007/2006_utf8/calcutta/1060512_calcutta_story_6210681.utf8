 Dump unwanted 

 antique to move ahead 

Feng Shui Matters 

Pinky Kapoor

 Vintage cars that are permanently parked 

 in the garage and never used symbolise life coming to 

 a standstill, according to Feng Shui. So, these should 

 either be disposed of or be repaired to ensure that 

 they are in smooth working condition 

Q: 

 My father has inherited some antique 

 pieces like watches, clocks and cars from his forefathers. 

 The cars have not been taken out of the garage in several 

 years. He is very sentimental about his ancestral possessions 

 and doesnt want to part with them at any cost. My 

 mother and I feel very suffocated with all these things 

 around. But at the same time we dont want to hurt 

 his sentiments. Please suggest a way out.

 THE SOLUTION: Being surrounded by too many things disrupts the smooth flow of Chi and this directly affects your life. So, first sort out the clocks and watches. The ones that are not in working condition should be either repaired or disposed of. 

 Do not let them lie around because your life is closely linked with time and dysfunctional watches and clocks mean that your life will stop moving ahead. 

 Similarly, cars that are permanently parked and never used symbolise life coming to a standstill. Your father should either dispose them of or give them to people who can take good care of them and ensure that they are in proper working condition. 

 In this way, at least they will 

 be used, otherwise they will only get rusted and decayed 

 and in Feng Shui, decaying things are considered extremely 

 inauspicious.

 Work space 

 Q: 

 I live in a big house, a part of which 

 is lying unused. I am thinking of utilising this area for 

 setting up my new business. I would like to know whether 

 we can connect the residential area with the business area. 

 Also, guide me on the placement of reception area, chambers, 

 furniture and the boardroom in the office. Since I am in 

 the advertising industry, I would like to know which would 

 be the best wall to show my presentation to clients.

 THE SOLUTION: When you start your business from your residence you should create two separate identities. That is, one of your office and the other of your home. In this way, they are nourished by the vital life force individually through their respective entrances. 

 To invite business related energy, you should start by placing the companys board at an eye level or higher. Reception should be close to the entrance but not in line with the main door. It becomes difficult to retain the staff when they are made to sit in this position because they are directly hit by the in flowing energy. 

 Your chamber should be placed in the south-west corner as this position is considered to be the most powerful one, which gives the boss authority and status of an emperor. 

 The chamber for the senior executives could be along the southern and western side and each chamber should have the main working table placed in its south-west sector. Such a placement gives stability to your senior executives as well. 

 Ensure that all the senior people are well supported by a solid wall from behind. The Chinese strongly believe that business opportunities slip out from behind when sitting with a window at the back. 

 Even the junior staff should not be made to sit in a similar position as this would make them feel insecure, resulting in inefficiency on their part. 

 The boardroom is best located in the north-east and the presentation board on its northern wall.

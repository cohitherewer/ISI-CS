The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 River source for daily supply

 Subhodyuti Datta: You are drawing more and more water from the Hooghly to meet the ever-increasing demand for treated surface water in the urban areas. Won?t this have a negative effect on the flow of the river?

 It is a fact that more and more water is being drawn from the Hooghly. There is no survey report on the maximum amount of water that can be drawn from the river. According to an estimate, we need to produce 500 million gallons of filtered water daily to supply to the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. We can draw this much water from the river without any problems.

 Besides, 80 per cent of the water we draw from the Hooghly returns to the river as treated discharge.

 Platinum passion

 With small is beautiful being the mantra on the jewellery front, the white metal seems to be finding favour with the woman of today, finds out Riddhima Seal

 With more and more women opting for the minimalist look in jewellery, platinum is fast emerging as a popular choice. Classy and modern at the same time, the metal suits the tastes of modern women perfectly, says Vaishali Banerjee, country head of the Platinum Guild International. Vaishali was in Calcutta on Thursday to kick-start the Platinum Festival at the MP Jewellers showroom at 99, Vivekananda Road.

 GoodLife checks out the factors that are gradually making this purest form of metal the popular pick of many.

 Minimal mode

 The fact that heavy jewellery is on its way out and the minimal look is in seems to be working in favour of platinum.

 Internationally, white metal seems to be the mantra on the jewellery front. And when it comes to white metal, there is absolutely no substitute for platinum. Five years back when we first started promoting this metal, the market was completely virgin. Even people in very fashion-conscious cities like Delhi and Mumbai favoured just gold and diamonds, says Banerjee.

 But the attitude has changed, thanks to the spirit of experimentation in todays woman. And what began as an experiment has now developed into a full-fledged trend. With time, people realised the true fashion worth of platinum. As a result, more and more people got hooked to the metal and the market has significantly increased, adds Banerjee.

 Trend talk

 Small and chic works best when it comes to platinum. A clear reflection of this is seen in the fact that rings, pendants and lightweight chains find maximum takers.

 The collection on offer as part of the Platinum Festival at MP Jewellers clearly celebrates this concept as well. Designed for the trendy urbanite, the minimalist look shows in all the pieces, beginning from rings, ear tops, pendants and chains. 

 The collection is targeted at working women who can wear small but striking pieces to work, says Chandrakanta Roychowdhury of MP Jewellers.

 Dwaipayan Sen, regional manager, Tanishq, feels that the diamond rage is a major reason for the popularity of platinum. There can be no better combination than diamond and platinum. The brilliance of a diamond often gets lost when you blend it with gold. But when you wear it on a platinum base, the radiance doubles due to the white colour of platinum even if it is something as small and simple as an ear top, says Sen.

 Rajiv Beri, CEO of Josh Diamonds, Mumbai, says that the demand for customised platinum jewellery is also at an all-time high. This is very significant in terms of how far the platinum market has really grown. We get lots of clients these days who ask us to get the pieces done in a particular way. And this is not limited to celebrities and the high-fliers alone, he says. Popular forms of customisation include engraved wedding rings and pendants.

 The trend has reached Calcutta as well. Roychowdhury of MP Jewellers reveals that a lot of youngsters in the age group of 18 to 25 want customised nose pieces and ear tops. 

 Bridal bests

 Small and simple is not where the platinum story ends. Many to-be brides, too, are finding the radiance of platinum hard to resist. Very recently, a Bengali couple walked into our store to buy gold jewellery for their daughters wedding. But they were so impressed by the platinum designs that they ended up buying platinum jewellery worth Rs 10 lakh. This indeed shows where the platinum market is headed in Calcutta, says Roychowdhury.

 He adds: And this is not just a stray incident, we have had several families readily opting for platinum for wedding jewellery.

 The timeless appeal of the metal is what makes it a smart buy, feels Banerjee. Gold loses its shine with time, but the best thing about platinum is that the more you wear it, the more radiant it becomes. It is timeless in the true sense of the term. But of course, the demand for bridal platinum jewellery is still in its nascent stage and will take some time to pick up.

 Market watch

 Although largely unaudited, the market for platinum has witnessed a growth by a good 40 to 50 per cent over the past five years. We started marketing with Delhi and Mumbai only, but now we are present in 65 cities including smaller places like Jammu, Trivandrum, Rajkot and Guwahati, offers Banerjee.

 The Platinum Festival at MP Jewellers, on till January 31 at showrooms across the city, is part of the promotional activities undertaken by the Platinum Guild International all over the country. With this festival we want to give a taste of platinum to those who have not worn it earlier. The products are priced very reasonably, starting at Rs 5,000. With affordability marking the range, it will prove to be a big draw, feels Roychowdhury. 

 The dipping price of the metal is indeed a major factor pushing up demand. Previously, with very few manufacturers, platinum was very expensive and out of reach for many. But now people even in price-conscious cities are able to afford it, feels Sen from Tanishq.

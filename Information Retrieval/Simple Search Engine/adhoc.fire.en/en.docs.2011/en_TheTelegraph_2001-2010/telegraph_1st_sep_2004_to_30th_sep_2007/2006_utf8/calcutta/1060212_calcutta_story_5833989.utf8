The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Two and two make 22

 Reality shows are all about numbers 

 but the critical issue is the number of people that each vote 

 represents

 Shiloo Chattopadhyay

 Reality show is the flavour of 

 the season. I am talking about the live TV contests where 

 the winner or loser is decided by popular votes. Some weeks 

 back this column had discussed the danger of using popular 

 voting to choose the best among singers. It was argued that 

 we, the lay judges, are incapable of isolating the effect 

 of only the singer when we hear a song.

 Since then the particular contest 

 has marched towards its grand finale. On the way there has 

 been a lot of drama. The experts, not unexpectedly, often 

 got rudely shocked by the popular judgment. Outbursts from 

 the mentors started. One of them even walked out of the 

 show. Then came the latest twist. During an episode, three 

 of the contestants announced on screen their decision to 

 concede defeat without participating further. Their grouse 

 was that one of the contestants was managing to get overwhelming 

 number of votes from his native region. Presumably their 

 argument was that the verdicts were reflecting only the 

 skills of vote garnering. The crisis was averted through 

 backstage persuasions.

 Since then, curiously, the show 

 has started announcing the votes garnered by each challenger 

 from each region; then the national aggregate is announced. 

 On one of the episodes, there was much discussion about 

 whether the aggregate should be used for the final verdict 

 or should only the votes of a neutral zone from where none 

 of the participants hailed be taken into cognisance. The 

 debate was unresolved and the method of judging remained 

 unaltered.

 The world of marketing as we all 

 know is also driven by popular choices. At stake are not 

 votes and viewership but continuous patronage of a brand 

 and thus profits. One of the inescapable realities of the 

 marketing world is that consumers are seldom unanimous. 

 If Tamil Nadu prefers the pink colour for a new soap, Punjab 

 is vehement about the green. If men go for yellow then women 

 are sold on blue. If sons like the younger model in the 

 ad, their fathers indicate their love for the mature one.

 The easiest solution of course 

 is to launch the new soap with pink cakes in Tamil Nadu 

 and green ones in Punjab. But such luxuries are seldom affordable 

 and difficult to manage. It is thus pretty common to use 

 a national aggregate of consumer opinion for choosing the 

 colour of the cake of soap or the model for a new campaign.

 How does the world of marketing 

 arrive at the national aggregate? The algorithm used by 

 the TV show is a simple addition of the votes from each 

 region. Marketing thinks differently. The preferences from 

 all segments are imparted importance. The determinant of 

 importance lies in the answer to a simple question ? how 

 much money do I or can I make from the segment?

 If Karnataka uses very little 

 of detergent cake and in Rajasthan it is the most common 

 washing agent then their preferences will be given heed 

 in that proportion. The process is mathematically driven 

 and quantitative weights are given to the preferences of 

 each segment. If the usage is uniform then weight is given 

 according to the size of the populations, as everybody in 

 that segment is a consumer.

 One wonders whether the TV game 

 shows need to take a leaf out of the marketing man?s handbook. 

 As the mentors in this musical mahayudh often say, 

 the chosen voice of Assam or UP can become India?s voice 

 only when the rest of India agrees to this judgment.

 In gauging this, the critical 

 issue is not the number of votes cast but the number of 

 people that each such vote represents. In a state where 

 100 people live and 10 votes are cast, then each of the 

 votes cast represents as many as 10 people.

 This is no different from what 

 happens in Parliament. Kerala sends fewer MPs than Uttar 

 Pradesh. TV channels will have no worry about precedence.

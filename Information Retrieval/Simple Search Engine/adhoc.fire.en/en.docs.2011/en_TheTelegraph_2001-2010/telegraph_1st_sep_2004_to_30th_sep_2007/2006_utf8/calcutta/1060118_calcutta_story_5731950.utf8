 I had a very bitter experience on New Year?s Eve. We had to queue up for around two-and-a-half hours to catch a glimpse of the deity at Kalighat temple. During our wait we noticed that some visitors were bypassing the queue and were being allowed by the temple staff to cross the railings against a payment of Rs 50 per head. When we protested against the unfair practice, two of the temple staffers standing nearby ridiculed us. We promptly called in two policemen who were on duty outside the temple. But even they didn?t question the temple staff. Why should a handful be allowed to use money power to their advantage at a place of worship, while elderly people and children wait for hours in queue?

 The system of parking in front of schools should be streamlined to facilitate smooth flow of traffic and to minimise the risk of accidents.

 Numerous small and big firms bring out calendars with pictures of gods and goddesses. After use, many throw the calendars made with non-biodegradable material into waterbodies causing a lot of pollution. Many of the calendars also end up in garbage dumps hurting religious sentiments. These calendars shouldn?t be allowed to be printed at all, or else, a proper method of disposal should be thought of.

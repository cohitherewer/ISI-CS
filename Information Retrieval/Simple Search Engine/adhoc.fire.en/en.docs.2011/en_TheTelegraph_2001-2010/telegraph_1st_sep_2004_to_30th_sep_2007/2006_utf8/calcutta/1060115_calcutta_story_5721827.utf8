 After budget PCs, it?s time for designer PCs. Indian IT giant HCL Infosystems has launched a range of desktop computers designed by National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad.

 According to HCL, the ?Designed in India? range of PCs is the first such effort in the country. ?Any good consumer product needs to have a strong aesthetic and engineering convergence. In this case, two Indian organisations have come together to create that,? said George Paul, executive VP (marketing), HCL.

 The new range ?looks and feels very different? from the existing PCs, designed with a stress on ergonomics, operability and health issues such as preventing long-term disorders.

 According to HCL, the company felt the need to go for such a partnership after realising that there was a gap between a change in customer lifestyle and preferences over the years and solutions which catered to these changes.

 ?While designing the desktops we ensured that the final product fulfils the demands of new technology, future trends in computer industry and caters to the changing lifestyle,? said Darlie O. Koshy, executive director of NID.

 The institute conducted a survey among 200-plus enterprises across various industry segments before deciding on the design. ?Users care a lot about how their desktop computer looks, sounds and feels,? added Koshy.

 The price range will remain the same as the existing models, as HCL terms the makeover as ?evolution? of its desktop range rather than introduction of new models.

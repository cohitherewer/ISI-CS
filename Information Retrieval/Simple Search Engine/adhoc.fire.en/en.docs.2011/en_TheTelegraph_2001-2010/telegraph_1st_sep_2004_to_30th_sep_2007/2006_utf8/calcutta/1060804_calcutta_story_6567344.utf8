The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 One step more

 She has danced her way into many hearts across the globe, but now Isha Sharvani is determined to prove that she is not just a dancing diva. Its a conscious decision to do films that do not have song and dance, says the girl who made her movie debut with Subhash Ghais big-budget debacle Kisna. Otherwise people take it for granted that they can only give me films with dance in them.

 So come Friday and Isha will be seen playing a bindaas, rich spoilt brat in Chekravarthys directorial debut Darwaza Bandh Rakho. When he called me up for the role, I just wanted to meet him, having seen Satya so many times, gushes the girl who danced in front of Michael Jackson at a show in Oman last year.

 A three-and-a-half hour script narration later, Isha was on. Its a hilarious setting where I play this rich girl kidnapped by four amateur kidnappers, she starts laughing on the phone. Now this girl is chalu yet bholi. She just drives the four of them crazy and as more and more people start coming into the house, they get totally baffled by her. I am sure everyone is going to fall in love with my character.

 If the film was funny, her director was just the opposite. Chakry is Satya in real life, Isha announces. He is very intense on the sets. He can get impatient and even go on to shout at you but thats because he is driven. It was great to work with someone like him. He is just like my mother. If she is totally passionate about dancing, Chakry is mad about movies.

 After Darwaza Bandh Rakho, Isha will be seen playing the quintessential Bollywood heroine in Rocky opposite Zayed Khan. It is a full-on commercial film with action, emotion and romance, she says. I am ready to do all kinds of films. My journey has just begun and I feel I have a long way to go.

 That long journey will, of course, be punctuated with Ishas famous dance shows with her mother Daksha Seths troupe. We are in the process of coming up with a new production called Postcards of God, she reveals. We usually work with abstract concepts but this is the first time we are addressing an issue and it is about the 1993 Mumbai blasts. It should be ready by the end of the year when my other film Good Boy Bad Boy would have released.

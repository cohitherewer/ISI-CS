 Girl body exhumed 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Police on Monday dug out the body of five-year-old Anushila Basu from Muraripukur Hindu burial ground and carried out a series of post-mortem tests to find out if she was yet another victim of medical negligence or not.

 A little over a month-and-a-half ago, Anushila?s father had lodged an FIR, following her death in a private nursing home on September 29. 

 The exhumation was in keeping with a directive by Bankshal court. 

 Anushila?s body was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital in the afternoon for the forensic tests. After completing the necessary formalities, it was buried once again in the presence of her parents.

 Doctors claimed that dengue shock syndrome was the cause of Anushila?s death. 

 Her father Saibal refused to accept that. He said when his daughter became delirious after water retention in her abdomen, doctors had assured him that she would recover. 

 It was only after her death, Saibal claimed, that the doctors told him the girl had died of dengue shock syndrome.

 Refusing to accept the doctors? claim on the death, Saibal lodged an FIR with Shyampukur police station on November 13, holding five doctors responsible for Anushila?s death. 

 The charge was straightforward: the girl?s ailment was not diagnosed correctly and the nursing home did not have the necessary infrastructure to monitor dengue shock. 

 Saibal also charged the School of Tropical Medicine with not wanting to accept blood samples. 

 Of the five doctors accused of negligence, two are virologists from the School of Tropical Medicine and one a paediatric physician attached to the nursing home. 

 ?We have carried out the forensic tests and the report will be submitted before an expert committee for its observation. Based on it, we will decide our next step of investigation,? Gyanwant Singh, city detective chief, said. 

 Anushila?s father started off with lodging complaints with the State Medical Council, the Indian Medical Association and then the police. 

 At every stage, Saibal stressed how doctors were negligent about treating his daughter and how, if all the doctors had properly carried out their duties, Anushila would have been alive. 

 Saibal, for instance, has alleged that the physician who had been treating his daughter since childhood tried to shirk his responsibilities, saying hers was case of viral fever. Later, when her condition worsened, he refused to check her. 

 Forensic experts claim the post-mortem would determine if the girl had suffered from shock syndrome and if there was any evidence of shock in her body.

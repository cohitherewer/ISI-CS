 What: 

 Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2006, presented in association 

 with The Oberoi Grand.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand ballroom.

 When: Saturday night, 8 pm onwards.

 The show: Whether the pull was Manish Malhotras first showing in Calcutta or simply the Saturday night factor, the ballroom at the hotel was packed to the brim with many struggling to get a toehold. And Manish surely did not disappoint. 

 A Manish Malhotra show without a star cast on the ramp is a rarity, but the Bollywood design badshah didnt have much choice in Calcutta. So, while professional models strutted his clothes on the ramp, the front rows were filled up by the usual Calcutta party people (quite a unique event at the designers shows). 

 Taking the stage second, after the showing by Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna, the filmi fashion guru put up an impressive show. The opening sequence, however, failed to impress as he lined up a few cocktail saris and lehngas that looked too Bollywood. 

 The chiffon saris in pastel hues of pinks, greens, blues and yellows boasted crocheted or embroidered borders and embellishments in white or silver. The lehngas with smart cuts were overloaded with shine and shimmer.

 The second part of the show featured Manishs spring-summer 2007 line titled Sensuality, unveiled at the grand finale of the India Fashion Week in Delhi last month. 

 The high point of the collection was an English rose print in red and green on a white or nude base. The print dominated most parts of the collection, whether on mens jackets or sari borders. 

 The Sensuality theme was portrayed through lots of sheers and flowy fabrics chiffons, nets, satins, silks and jerseys. The colour palette was soft, too, with whites, nudes, salmon pinks, beiges, creams, cherry reds and more. 

 An array of dresses (long, short, empire-lines) skirts of all lengths (from floor-kissing ones to flared minis), knee-length pants, corsets, capris, summer jackets, swim wear (seen through sheer over-layers) and cocktail saris made up the collection. 

 The men sported printed fitted tees, shirts and jackets with plain white trousers. Generous doses of embroidery, lacework, a touch of pleating, patchwork (on mens jackets) and mirror work decorated the clothes. The collection was accessorised with broad embellished belts, bags and long neckpieces.

 Earlier in the evening, the ramp saw another Fashion Week finale collection, as Cue by Rohit and Rahul showcased its fall-winter 2006-07 line unveiled at the grand finale of IFW in April. 

 The super-glam line, however, had little surprises for Calcutta, as many in the audience had already seen parts of the collection at least twice once at the inaugural show of 85 Lansdowne and more recently at Fashion Police in Tantra last month.

 An unusual combination of browns and pinks, with some flesh interspersed, was the highlight of the collection. Extravagant laces, sensual silks, tulle trims, velvet edgings and satin details in voluminous lowers lent a sensuous feel. Wool embroidery, digital prints, silver work, velvet applique, foil printing and metallic hand embroidery formed the embellishments, along with stones, shells and pearls.

 Corset shirts, heavily embellished skirts of various shapes, a plethora of styles in evening dresses, jackets and more were the shapes for women, while the men had suits, jackets, tees, shirts and trousers. The silhouettes were skin-hugging with flow in the lowers.

 An impressive collection no doubt, but its high time Rohit and Rahul started taking the city a wee bit more seriously and cared to dish out something new, more so since the duo keep on mouthing Calcutta is a great market for us every now and then.

 Modelwatch: The show choreographed by Alison Kanuga featured top ramp names like Monikangana Dutta, Carol Gracias, Sonalika Sahay, Jesse Randhawa, Michelle Innes and Indrani Dasgupta.

 Coming up: Kicking off at Calcutta, the Blenders Pride Fashion Tour 2006 will roll to Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Bangalore.

 That?s the way we like it 

 The cooking and salsa 

 workshops, held in association with TTIS, at 

 Crossword. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya and Rashbehari

 A bowl full of crisp biscuit pieces, 

 a ladle full of chocolate syrup and dollops of fresh cream. 

 Ten-year-old Aashna couldn?t be bothered about getting the 

 chocolate biscuit fudge recipe right by the book. All that 

 mattered was trying her hand at what she loved best? mixing 

 all the ingredients in the bowl and showing off her cooking 

 skills to others her age.

 ?I will make it for mummy later,? announced Radhika, a Class II student of Loreto House, adding that she already excels in making ?yummy sandwiches?.

 For Aashna, Radhika and the rest of the 80-odd kids who signed up for the non-stove cooking workshop at Crossword Children?s Summer Fest, organised in association with TTIS, the sessions were a welcome departure from the run-of-the-mill music, painting and dance workshops that dot the cityscape during vacations.

 Mamta Ruia and Varsha Rohariwala sat back and watched their daughters from a distance. ?At home, I don?t allow my daughters Vrinda, 4, and Avantika, 8, to enter the kitchen. But I have noticed that they are genuinely interested in cooking. So, I thought they would enjoy this session,? smiled Mamta. That cooking workshops for kids are not common was a reason for the popularity of the event, Varsha added.

 The other off-beat activities were toy car racing, a puzzle solving meet, an origami workshop and a sports quiz. Even the craft activity session was unique with the children being taught to make photo frames using ice-cream sticks.

 Over 600 children have taken part in the fun events at the 20-day fest, which will wrap up on June 4 with a magic show between 11 am and noon.

 One of the most awaited workshops was the one on salsa, for eight to 16-year-olds, on June 2 and 3. Salsa went from hot and sexy to cute and cuddly as kids lined up in their holiday best to learn some steps from instructor Aditya Upadhyay.

 Neon capris, vests, denim skirts, polka dots and tunics formed the haute statement perfect to pick up some basic salsa footwork and also styling. ?I kept the syllabus simple and segregated to suit the eight-to-16 age bracket. The mambo step, rhumba or side step coupled with some simple turns and styling is what the kids basically learnt,? said Aditya.

 The children seemed to really love it. Moving to the counts perfectly, picking up the right groove and, of course, not to forget the shy smiles when their salsa instructor asked them to ?face their partners and hold their hand?, this was one summer holiday workshop they would not forget in a hurry.

 With the same objective in mind, and encouraged by the response to the ongoing TTIS series of kids? events, Crossword is now planning to hold similar workshops and fun activities for children more often.

 ?We have had to turn away people as there were so many registrations on each day of the fest. Instead of keeping these restricted to the vacations, we are planning to introduce such workshops on weekend evenings,? said Puja Raja, marketing manager, Crossword.

 A house of mystery for comics

 Earn money from film-making and other side projects and plough it back into setting up a publishing house only for ?graphic novels?. A novel and noble idea to offer unknown talents a chance, open up the graphic novel genre in this country and perhaps even make some money. But will it work? Friends and collaborators Sarnath Banerjee and Anindya Roy will find out soon.

 The duo has just set up Phantomville, 

 a platform for aspiring comics creators ? or comicists as 

 they would please. Functioning out of Delhi, Phantomville?s 

 first output, The Believers (picture inset), tells 

 the story of two brothers brought together by death but 

 separated by belief. A complex and sensitive tale told in 

 pictures and words.

 ?For the past five years we had 

 been thinking of a platform for comics. Two years ago we 

 had started the South Comix Collective with an NGO to talk 

 about social issues like child labour and infanticide. We 

 wanted to take that forward,? Anindya , a mathematics graduate 

 with a film-making background, told Metro from Delhi.

 Sarnath, of course, is the author of India?s first graphic novel, Corridor. ?Anindya and I realised that if we are to bring about a real change as to how comics are created and perceived in India we have to take a more active approach,? Sarnath explained via email from Frankfurt.

 Graphic novels, or ?long-form comic books with complex story lines often meant for mature readers?, have found it difficult to turn mass in India. ?It?s a cultural form in the West, in Latin America and in Japan,? pointed out Sarnath. 

 Not to mention one of Hollywood?s favourite idea storehouses, be it with past adaptations like Alan Moore?s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to the more recent V for Vendetta, Frank Miller?s Sin City or the upcoming Watchmen (Moore again).

 ?They are expensive and have a niche market. How many can buy a comic book worth Rs 700 or 800? But we still see a potential with graphic novels and have been stocking them for the past few years,? said Gautam Jatia of Landmark, a favourite comics haunt.

 Anindya and Sarnath plan to turn Phantomville into a ?vehicle for graphic storytellers? to publish the new narratives emerging from India. ?We are encouraging narratives that originate from the local, yet avoid the mythological, and supporting stories that seem to be real in the times that we live,? explained Sarnath. 

 Why Phantomville? ?Ghost town, imaginary neighbourhood, uncertain place, pick your choice. But it has nothing to do with Phantom, the ghost who walks, who is one of my favourite characters,? said Sarnath. ?It?s more like a house of mystery. You never know what?s coming out of it next,? felt Anindya.

 What has come out for now is The Believers, written by Keralite Abdul Sultan PP and illustrated by Partha Sengupta. Up next is Kashmir Pending, which deals with, among other things, the militancy in Kashmir and is written by journalist Naseer Ahmed, with illustrations by Saurabh Singh.

 The expectations from the first publication are modest. ?Corridor sold around 4,500 copies. I?d be happy if The Believers sells 4,000,? said Anindya, who is working on his debut novel.

 Sarnath?s second comic book The Barn Owl?s Wondrous Capers is due later this year from Penguin.

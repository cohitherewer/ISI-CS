 Memorial for living

 - Gaffe 

 leaves force red in face

 IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI

 Its a comedy of errors for Calcutta Police.

 Four years ago, the force had built a memorial for Ronald Allen Moore, who had served Calcutta Police as a traffic sergeant in the 1960s and rose to hold the rank of deputy commissioner. 

 A month ago, senior officers at Lalbazar came to know that Moore is still alive and lives in Perth, Australia, with his wife and sons. 

 Realising the faux pas, the officers hurriedly renamed a boxing tournament in Moores name. The tournament, which was inaugurated by police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee last week, is under way at the Calcutta Armed Police headquarters (Bodyguard Lines).

 Subsequently, the officers are also planning to invite Moore and show him the modernised police force and its achievements. 

 Zulfikar Hasan, joint commissioner (armed police), said: When I spoke to him, he could not believe that Calcutta Police still remembers him. He was very excited to know about the force and wants to visit Calcutta. But right now, he is not keeping well. Once he recovers, we will bring him here. 

 According to a senior officer at Lalbazar, Moore, who was a very popular boxer and even won the Indian National Boxing Tournament, took voluntary retirement in 1977 and left for Australia with his family. 

 We lost contact once he left for Australia. A few years back, someone said that Moore had died in an accident. We didnt have his number or address, so we could not verify the news. He was a very popular officer of his time, so we decided to build a memorial in his name, the officer said. 

 It was only last month that we came to know that Moore was alive. It was certainly a blunder on our part. We should not have acted in haste, the officer admitted.

 A solar eclipse in October 2005

 Astronomy Aura

 Not just stars of the small and big screens, the year that was saw Calcuttans catch up with other starry kinds as well. From Saturn coming closest to Earth (till 2031) in January to a rare line-up of Venus, Mercury and Saturn in June, and Mars coming closest to our planet (till 2017) in October ? 2005 was a stargazer?s delight.

 This year is likely to be a little different, with more misses than hits. The list of no-shows kicks off with the first major astronomical event of the year, the penumbral lunar eclipse on March 14.

 The miss will cost the astronomer dearer than the common man, as the difference in brightness of the moon would be hardly noticeable to the naked eye.

 The city would also have to pass up the chance to catch the annular solar eclipse in September ? we had at least a partial glimpse of the 2005 one ? as well as Mercury?s transit across the sun in November.

 It would be one of only 13 transits that Mercury makes in a century; thousands had queued up to see the last one, in 2003.

 The planetary conjunction in December will be missed more for the spectacular sight than anything else, when Mercury, Mars and Jupiter line up.

 Calcuttans would, however, be able to catch a partial glimpse of the total solar eclipse in March. Globally, there?s tremendous interest in the event since after a long time the path of the eclipse passes through the locality. 

 Those in Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan and West Asia would be in the best position for the sight, but special eclipse tours and cruises are being arranged from different parts of the world for the rest.

 Mars drawing close to Saturn in June, though not a rare astronomical event, would be fully visible. 

 The other starry event worth a look is the partial lunar eclipse in September, provided clouds don?t play spoilsport.

 And there could always be unforeseen events like last year?s sunspots that grabbed the world?s attention for weeks.

 iPod Nano

 Technology Take

 If a flurry of new channels battled for eyeballs in 2005, this year could see the war of reaching those channels to your TV set hotting up.

 Direct-to-home (DTH) is likely to be the buzzword as the Tata-STAR joint venture, T-Sky, prepares for a mid-year rollout, riding the recently-launched Insat-4A satellite.

 As early reports suggest, the company is set to go all out to battle Zee?s dishtv ? the only existing paid DTH service ? on price, number of channels and value add-ons.

 The dishtv offering, which claims to have captured a subscriber base of over six lakh, is preparing to offer add-ons such as movie-on-demand and time-shifting ? the option of pausing live television, and recording programmes for viewing later.

 Reliance Infocomm is the other big player making some noise on the ground. The company is approaching cable operators to provide the crucial last-mile connectivity for its phone-and-Internet-over-cable project. 

 The company has delayed the launch of its service several times, but 2006 might just be the year for them.

 Cable operators are not likely to sit tight either. The DTH drive has already forced most multi-system operators in the city to initiate the process of digitising their service.

 Xbox 360

 Once finished, that would help them provide more channels in better quality over the existing set-up with broadband Internet thrown in as well. All that may just lead to the consumer (viewer), finally being crowned king in 2006.

 As far as new gadgets and gizmos are concerned, the grey market continues to cater to the Calcuttan?s craving for the latest in line.

 Legally, a Microsoft Xbox ? let alone the new Xbox 360 ? will still not be available and the iPod phone, Motorola?s ROKR, has a remote chance of being launched. Other iPod models, however, are sure to rule 2006 as the preferred portable music player and the ideal festival gift.

 Lookout for Microsoft?s Media Center-based PCs and lifestyle equipment as well, trying to make the best use of the personal computer?s multimedia features and merge them with television. 

 Pause and record live television, beam music and movies to other rooms of the house and more.

 Kaushiki Chakraborty Desikan

 Music Matters

 Given the norm of last-minute confirmations ? and cancellations ? of big-ticket gigs in town, there seems to be hope and little else on the 2006 horizon. Various agencies and event management houses are striving to bring big impact international music acts to town. 

 Names doing the rounds range from Vanessa Mae to Norah Jones, The Allman Brothers Band to Jimmy Herring.

 Amjad Ali Khan

 The Congo Square Jazz Fest (January 21 and 22 on the DI lawns) promises to weave a collage of myriad notes. While Mandu Sarara, a Brazilian quintet, will play instrumental world music, the Eric Lohrer Quartet from France and the French-German ensemble, the Three Raags Trio, will play straight-ahead jazz. 

 HFT, the Indian fusion jazz band will also perform, even as the organisers talk to a few other foreign bands.

 American jazz group Black Entertainment Television (BET) is slated to perform in late January, courtesy USIS, which is also bringing the Latin Jazz Quartet to Calcutta and IIT Kharagpur the month after.

 Norah Jones

 The annual treat for Indian classical music lovers, the Dover Lane Music Conference, is scheduled for January 21-25 at Nazrul Mancha.

 The list of vocalists features Parveen Sultana, Rashid Khan, Ajoy Chakraborty, Padma Talwalkar and Kaushiki Chakraborty Desikan.

 Maestros on instruments include Ali Akbar Khan, Amjad Ali Khan, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Shahid Parvez and Irshad Khan.

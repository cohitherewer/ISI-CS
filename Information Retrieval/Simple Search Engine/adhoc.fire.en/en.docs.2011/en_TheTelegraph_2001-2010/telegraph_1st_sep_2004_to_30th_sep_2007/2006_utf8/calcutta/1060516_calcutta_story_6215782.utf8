 The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) is looking forward to the new academic year. The Joka campus will see close to 340 students, the largest intake amongst all six IIMs, taking admission into its staple two-year management programme, Postgraduate Programme in Management (PGP).

 And that?s not all. December 2006 will also see 40 students, with at least five years? full-time work experience and competitive GMAT scores, tackling a one-year Postgraduate Programme for Executives (PGPEX).

 Keeping this in mind, IIMC has embarked on a number of academic initiatives that have been designed to integrate global management trends with hardcore research methodology.

 Anindya Sen, dean of programme initiatives, IIMC, said: ?The next year will see a host of academic initiatives on campus. Since the intake of students this year should be around 340, which should rise to 400 soon, the academic modules in a number of programmes will undergo a few critical changes to reflect global business practices and the ever-changing demands of the corporate sector. Management studies can no longer stop at teaching only functional modules. Programmes must be cross-disciplinary and transnational.?

 The institute is waiting for the commencement of PGPEX, which, it feels, will add a new dimension to its profile. PGPEX starts from December and the institute has been quite stringent with its admission procedure with regard to the course. 

 ?PGPEX will have a strong international component. It will be related to globalisation, and we want students to get the complete IIMC experience that should help them move up the value chain. We expect a sizeable number of faculty from abroad to come over and teach a number of courses,? explained Sen. 

 The students will spend a term doing an internship abroad. 

 Sen said the student intake may rise to 120, depending upon the response.

 IIMC has also been on a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signing spree. It has signed one with National University of Singapore, that includes student and faculty exchange and long-term collaboration. An MoU with the University of Colorado, Boulder, also aims at facilitating student-faculty exchange.

 While the institute has no immediate plans to open campuses abroad, it wants to reach out to a international audience through their Management Development Programmes (MDP).

 ?There has been a tremendous response to MDPs that are satellite-based. The faculty teach from our campus studio and students? questions can be answered immediately. It?s for professionals who can?t or don?t want to take time off for a full-time MBA,? said Sen.

 ?The bad news is that it has been difficult sourcing quality faculty. But we are quite hopeful that we should overcome the problem soon,? signed off Sen.

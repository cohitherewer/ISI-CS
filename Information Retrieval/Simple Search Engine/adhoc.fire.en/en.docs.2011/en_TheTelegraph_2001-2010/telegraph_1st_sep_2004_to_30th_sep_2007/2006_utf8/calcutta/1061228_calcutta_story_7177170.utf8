The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Road repairs in tandem

 KINSUK BASU

 The urban development department has finally woken up to the need for a coordinated approach to road repair. 

 After rounds of patchwork on key arteries have proved futile, the mandarins have decided that come 2007, the government agencies and the civic body will work in tandem to bring about lasting improvement in the quality of roads.

 The attempt at coordination will start with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), irrigation department and Hidco working simultaneously for the upgrade of the Rashbehari and Park Circus connectors to the Bypass, and also Chaulpatty Road. Traffic police will also be part of the project. 

 One cant repair roads in isolation. For instance, it would make little sense to repair the Rashbehari connector without ensuring that there is no waterlogging on the stretch, said CMDA chief P.R. Baviskar. 

 The primary objective of the coordination will be to protect the asphalt layer of arterial roads from water. The main drainage channel along the Rashbehari connector will be cleaned and linked to the Tollygunge-Panchannagram Canal I. This will take care of waterlogging in and around New Ballygunge and Bosepukur. 

 The civic body will begin work in January, when the CMDA is to complete repairs on the 3.8-km stretch. The CMC will then coordinate with the irrigation department on desilting the canal. 

 We will hold talks with the irrigation department before starting work on the canal as part of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, said CMC chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) P.K. Dhua.

 Work on Chaulpatty Road, in Beleghata, will also be taken up in January. The CMDA has held talks with Hidco and tenders for work on the 3.5-km stretch have been floated.

 Chaulpatty Road is a very important artery and I have time and again urged the CMDA to repair the road, stated deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim. 

 The upgrade of the Park Circus connector will follow with improvement of drainage around Gobindo Khatik Road. It has been decided that a 300-m stretch will be concretised. Work on each lane will be carried out in phases.

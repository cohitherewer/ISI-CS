 The Sons amp; Daughters

 Come Thursday, 10 pm, and STAR World will bring you the zany and slightly troubled members of the Walker family who try to make it through the day-to-day routine of life. A unique hybrid comedy series, Sons amp; Daughters offers a mix of improvised as well as scripted humour in an unadulterated look at marriage, raising children and living in close proximity to an extended family.

 Says the shows creator and actor Fred Gross: You really cant do a show with improvised dialogue unless you have a really strong script. I know that sounds strange but we do write a script that runs into 10, 11 pages. The story is very well described. In each scene, the actors intentions and objectives are very well explained. Its a really fun process. It makes the actors seem more real and makes the camerawork more interesting.

 Sons amp; Daughters is about an extended family, but Fred refuses to call it a family show. The subject matter can be pretty raw and real, he says. We try to as far as standards and practices will allow us make people talk as real as they do, as opposed to painting some kind of TV reality of how families are. Thats what were striving for and like I said, that is what makes us different, and what makes us different will either help us because of the climate of what people are looking for or hurt us because of the climate of what people are looking for!

 And theres a lot in the show which is straight out of real life. (Co-creator) Nick and I are both products of divorce, and teen pregnancy; the whole Jewish wife scenario is taken from my life, says Fred. Im going through the same thing with my wife in raising our kids Jewish when Im not Jewish. So a lot of the ideas sprang out of our own personal experience with our modern extended families.

 Ablution by fire

 Complete lack of morality in both public and private life is a phenomenon that has spread its tentacles far and wide in modern society. Written by Hara Bhattacharya, Aguner Barnamala assesses the terrible impact this can have on children and conscientious adults. The play unfolds the story of Kushal, a seventeen year-old psychiatric patient. Accused of burning his father to death, he also considers himself responsible for his mothers suicide. He often inflicts burns injuries on himself, trying to walk over fire or to hold it with his bare hands. He thinks that like Sita, who emerged unhurt from her agnipariksha, or Sharngnaka brothers of The Mahabharata during khandavdahan, he too would be unharmed by fire and thus prove his purity, unlike his parents. His condition rouses the inert conscience of his doctor, who realises his own hypocrisy and ventures to amend the sin he committed. Inspired by Peter Shaffer. Direction: Anirban Bhattacharya.

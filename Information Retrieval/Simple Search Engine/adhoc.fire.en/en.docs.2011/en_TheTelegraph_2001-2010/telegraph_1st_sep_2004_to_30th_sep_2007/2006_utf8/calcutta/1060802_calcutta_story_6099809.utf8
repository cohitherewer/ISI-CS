 Unnamed mole spurs book sales 

 - As Jaswant Singh courts controversy, his Call to Honour flies off the shelves

 ZEESHAN JAWED

 More than a call to honour, its a call to controversy that sells. 

 It doesnt matter if Jaswant Singh is yet to name the mole who was leaking nuclear secrets to the US. His book, A Call to Honour: In Service of Emergent India, in which he makes the claim, is doing what it should at the bookstores: flying off the shelves. 

 In Calcutta, we have already sold more than 1,000 copies and are getting more orders from various bookstores. The fourth re-print is already in the market, says Raju Barman, eastern region head of Rupa amp; Co, publishers of the book. Because of its content, the book is supposed to appeal to a niche audience that is interested in biographies, autobiographies and books on politics and current affairs. Considering the limited readership, we think the book is going great guns. 

 If Singh who had held the foreign and finance portfolios has embarrassed his party, the BJP, and enraged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, it has only helped the book. 

 A Call to Honour hit the shelves on July 21 and sold steadily, till the storeowners realised that they have run out of stock. The book has performed beyond our expectations. We are going to place an order for our second consignment, said Gautam Jatia, CEO, Landmark. 

 At Oxford Bookstore, the book is sold out. Given the present trend, the popularity of the book is only going to grow, says an Oxford Bookstore spokesperson. 

 Singh claims in the book that he has a letter that proves that a high-ranking civil servant in Prime Minister Narasimha Raos office was leaking the secrets to the US. The official, Singh alleges, took part in a secret meeting in Bangalore, where nuclear tests were discussed. Singhs observations about the Kandahar hijack, the Pokhran blasts and the Gujarat riots also could upset his party leaders, some feel. 

 There are two ways in which a book becomes popular. One, if it has a very rich content, like The Argumentative Indian. Two, if there is enough hype about the book, creating general awareness. At present, A Call to Honour would fall into the second category, says Sidharth Pansari of Crossword. 

 Like Kavya Vishwanathans How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life, before the 19-year-old author was found guilty of plagiarising and the book was yanked off the shelves. 

 And now, Singh has announced that his next book will be on Ayodhya, the temple town, where the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 led to one of Indias bloodiest carnages.

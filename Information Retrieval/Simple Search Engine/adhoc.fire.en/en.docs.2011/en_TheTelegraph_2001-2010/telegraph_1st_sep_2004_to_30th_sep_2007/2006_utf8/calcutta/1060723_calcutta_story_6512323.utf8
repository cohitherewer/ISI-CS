Life

 Autumn aura in ivory amp; gold

 SMITA ROY CHOWDHURY

 What: Fashion Police, the monthly style extravaganza at The Park.

 Where: Tantra.

 When: Friday, post midnight.

 The collection: Flowing, layered, asymmetrical skirts; rich ivories and charcoal; dash of crochet and foil prints. That pretty much sums up the look splashed across the Tantra bartop on Friday night. The third edition of the fashion series saw a club wear line by Delhi-based designer Anju Modi, who presented an edited version of her autumn-winter 2006-07 collection called Hybrid.

 The feel of the line was overtly feminine, with Anjus trademark foil prints in golden and silver adorning the soft ivory bases. The motifs combined roses and leaves with abstract.

 Flowing skirts varied from mid-calf-length to the knee, mostly layered and with asymmetrical hemlines. These were teamed with wrap-tops, angarakha-style tops, fitted jackets, empire-line tops and more. A hint of glitter and shimmer jazzed up the ivory.

 Cottons, chiffons, lycra, and wool knits formed the fabric story. The clothes were accessorised with lace hair bands and flat tie-ups.

 The show: Models Viveka Babaji, Shruti Agarwal, Romil Srivastava, Archana Vijaya, Sohini Jaitley, Amanpreet Wahi, Devdutta Banerjee and Shreya Pandey trotted the bartop, showcasing the creations. Choreographed by the duo Meenu and Meetu, the catwalk was livened up by the models reading and sketching, smoking cigarettes and sipping wine.

The crowd: The nightclub was full to the brim with a section of the crowd grooving away happily to Bollywood chartbusters and others waiting eagerly for the show to start. But the wait was a little too much for even the Calcutta crowd used to fashionable delays. An audio-visual concept presentation kicking off the show drew very little attention, as most party people were busy dancing or drinking. And by the time the show started, a little past 12.30 am, many in the crowd had lost interest in the clothes.

 Voiceover: The line is subtle and serious, not the usual loud club wear clothes that we see everywhere. Its meant for meaningful evenings out, Anju said about her collection.

 If only: The crowd was a little more discerning.

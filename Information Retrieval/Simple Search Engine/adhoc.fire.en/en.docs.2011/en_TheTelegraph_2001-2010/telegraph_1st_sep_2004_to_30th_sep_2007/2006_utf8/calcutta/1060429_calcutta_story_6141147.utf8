The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Of emotion and reason

 - TALK ON ROMANTICISM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The Raft of Medusa, by Gericault

 Of what relevance is a lecture on romanticism and the romantic movement in art to an audience in Calcutta in this day and time? Little, if the lecture by Anirudh Chari, research scholar, UK, (according to the invitation card) at Victoria Memorial Hall on a stormy Monday evening was anything to go by. An academic exercise, however brilliant, must be contextualised. Chari?s talk sounded more like an honours class lecture in college.

 Chari tried to cover too many issues in a lecture that lasted a little more than an hour. As a result, it lost its focus and became diffuse. He began by defining romanticism, whose traits cannot be catalogued. The notion was rejected by Delacroix and Goethe, who denounced it as a ?disease.?

 But romantic was the opposite of the term classical, which was marked by placidity and calm. By the end of 18th Century, Europe was undergoing rapid industrialisation that caused untold miseries to the people. 

 Whenever Chari wanted to make a point, the corresponding work of art would appear on screen. That was one of the best things about the lecture.

 The impact of the revolution could never be eradicated. The artist could not allow emotion to be submerged by reason. He was to depict what he saw within himself. The new view of the artist was that he was an isolated being, like Blake and Goya. Chari dwelled on the art of these two artists, as well as that of David.

 Around this time there was a revival of Gothic architecture, the new House of Parliament belonging to that style. Landscapes began to be painted as independent entities and not as backdrops. Chari analysed the manifestations of the romantic movement in English literature and art and the debate in France on classicism vs romanticism. Perhaps there was too much for the audience to chew on.

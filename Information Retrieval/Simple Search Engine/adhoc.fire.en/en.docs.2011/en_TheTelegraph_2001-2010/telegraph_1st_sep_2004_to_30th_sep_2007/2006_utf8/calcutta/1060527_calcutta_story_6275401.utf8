 At CIMA Gallery, artists from Madhya Pradesh are holding a large exhibition, which opened on Friday. While the art of the tribals of this heartland India state is known the world over, little is seen here of the works of the urban artists there, many of whom were trained at Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal. Both, happily, are represented in this exhibition.

 The Gond tribals originally used earth colours that gave their paintings a jewel-like hue. But the tribal artists of today paint on canvas or paper, using acrylic paint. Many such works can be seen here. Significant among them is Venkatram Singh Shyam?s bird holding aloft the clouds that have eyes. This artist went recently to London to illustrate a children?s book that has won an award. A multi-colour Ganesha with as many arms as a centipede and other deities, mostly fantastic, aeroplanes that dart around like dragonflies and other winged creatures stand out against white canvases. The artists are Dilip Kumar Shyam, Ravindra Shyam and Mohan Shyam. Mayank Kumar Shyam stands out as his drawings are in black and white.

 Mayank?s works have a modern sensibility even when he depicts tribals in pastoral bliss, cooking, dancing and making merry. 

 There are two other works where there is a shift to urban life. In one, birds fly past apartment blocks. The other depicts a busy road tightly composed around a cluster of houses with a mosque in its midst. His work lacks the flamboyance of the paintings in which beads of colour bloom but they have a cool sophistication to make up for exuberance.

 The self-confidence of an artist becomes apparent from the way s/he handles his/her chosen medium. The bare essentials are what Kunal Bhaurao Ukey has chosen to depict in the water colour titled Bottles. The only colour he uses is yellow but certainly with telling effect.

 Hutaram Adhikari is a tribal artist but only in name. He does not feel obliged to make his work look identifiably ?tribal? and prefers to create an identity of his own. 

 His is a silk screen of a tree metamorphosing into a flock of birds.

 It would have made a lot of difference for viewers in Calcutta to find out at least a little about the artists whose works have been presented here. Only one artist from Madhya Pradesh ? Devilal Patidar ? was present at the opening. 

 He offers a series of skilful drawings of implements much in use in every day. 

 These are done with kajal instead of conventional media such as a pencil, a pen or a brush. Each tool, however, has a significant difference from the conventional ones, and has a life of its own.

 Patidar has also done a series of faces with different expressions using vegetable dye and gouache on paper. These paintings hardly show any details and are comparable to Noh masks. One painting resembles a caricature. A face is all smiles, quite literally.

 Some Calcutta artists have a part to play in this exhibition. Sculptors Shyamal Roy and Uma Siddhanta present works in terracotta and fibreglass, respectively. 

 Sumitro Basak?s alpona in white on the floor has a beautiful sinuous design.

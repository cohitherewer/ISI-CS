The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Sniffers miss their calories

 - CRUNCH HITS DOG SQUAD

 KINSUK BASU 

 Mima is busy these days. As a bomb detection expert, she has to go out for security drills at least five times a week after the Mumbai blasts. 

 Just like nine others in her team, she is doing an outstanding job, but her trainers are worried how long Mima and her teammates will continue to deliver.

 Mima is one of the active members of the Calcutta Polices dog squad, which is now facing a funds crunch. 

 With security drills being intensified after the Mumbai blasts and other terrorist attacks across the country, the workload of these sniffer dogs has increased manifold, but the budgetary allocation for their food and upkeep has not gone up proportionately. 

 Around two years ago, the state government had fixed Rs 950 for each dog every month. But the sum is inadequate, as the cost of food and other services has gone up, a senior officer in the dog squad said.

 According to the experts, a police dog needs 1,400-1,500 calories daily. The requirement goes up to 2,000 calories during winter, when dogs undergo several training exercises. Trainers say unless the food intake is right, it is difficult to get them in their right mood.

 These dogs can have major mood swings. Therefore, the food should be to their taste or getting them to work can be really tough, says a trainer at National Training Centre for Dogs, Gwalior.

 Officers, too, admitted that the dogs should be kept in the best spirits to get the desired results, especially during specialised operations like security checks in VVIP vehicles and inside Metro Railway stations.

 For all categories of dogs from explosive sniffers to those deployed in rescue mission, work is quite tiring. Apart from their usual duties, the dogs are now on the prowl outside prisons to detect explosives. For all this, the dogs must be fit. And therefore, they should get the right amount of calories, a senior officer in the bomb squad said. 

 But with the funds allocated by the state, we are facing problems in meeting their requirements, he added.

 Buddha has star guest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Even as life in the city limped along on Monday, thanks to the 12-hour bandh, a star visitor livened up an otherwise dull day at Writers Buildings.

 A little after noon, in stepped 

 Prosenjit. Dressed in all white, Tollywoods leading man 

 was escorted to the door of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee by an 

 all-smiles police force (picture by Amit Datta).

 The rendezvous came close on the heels of Prosenjit, wearing the hat of the secretary of Artistes Forum, meeting Bhattacharjee at Nandan to discuss the governments move to privatise Technicians Studio. The chief minister, on Monday, reiterated that the Tollygunge studio will be leased out to Zee Telefilms, but without the industrys interests being compromised.

 The bandh-day meeting, however, was mainly for Prosenjit to invite the chief minister to the inauguration of Mahanayakke Nayaker Shraddhanjali, his tribute to Uttam Kumar, starting October 12 at Star theatre.

 Prosenjits company Ideas is organising the four-day event, which includes an exhibition at Science City with talk shows and auction of Uttam Kumar memorabilia.

 Women cops to tame road Romeos

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Learning a lesson from last years incidents of eve-teasing, the city police have decided to strengthen the vigil on the major thoroughfares this year.

 According to the latest plan drawn, more policewomen will be deployed on the roads this year, in an attempt to drive away the eve-teasers.

 We are not taking any chance this year. We will be keeping a close watch on the main thoroughfares before and during Durga puja, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

 According to last years police records, more than 55 youths were arrested in different areas of south Calcutta for various types of crime during the Puja days. Most of the complaints were reported from the Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Gariahat, Ballygunge and Dhakuria areas. 

 However, senior police officers said that they were reluctant to deploy policewomen in these busy areas.

 Most of the policewomen complained about lewd remarks made by passersby and were unwilling to join the campaign, said a senior officer at Lalbazar police headquarters. 

 He added: We had to organise one-to-one counselling sessions for the policewomen to motivate them to join us.

 Pradip Chatterjee, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said: Our target is to prevent any kind of crime, be it eve-teasing or theft. We will soon issue a guideline for all the officers, who will be deployed during the puja days.

 He added: We will focus mainly on the trouble spots where such cases are quite common and also on the bigger pandals. The policewomen will be accompanied by their male counterparts.

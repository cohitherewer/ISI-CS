The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Who?ll police the police?

 - Buddha?s friend-in-need force reveals its ugly face

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The charges: Extortion, 

 high-handedness, inaction, illegal detention, false implication 

 and unwillingness to lodge complaints against colleagues

 The ACCUSED: Police 

 stations

 Complaint count against cops: 

 8,004 in past seven months.

 ?There has been an increase in the number of complaints against policemen over the past few months. Complaints of extortion and high-handedness have come in mostly from areas like Burrabazar, Posta, New Market, Cossipore, Bowbazar and Shakespeare Sarani,? admitted Kuldiep Singh, joint commissioner (administration).

 This puts paid to the much-publicised promises of better police-people relations and greater police-public interface.

 ?Police are the human face of the administration and you should always be on your toes to help. Common people should not fear you, but look upon you as friends in need,? chief minister and home (police) minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had pronounced at the inauguration of the year-long celebration of 150 years of Calcutta Police last November.

 While police harassment cuts across socio-economic borders, the weaker sections of society bear the brunt.

 ?The maximum number of complaints of harassment, inaction, illegal detention and refusal to register complaints comes from areas populated by the underprivileged. Most of these police stations are in the Port area and in the eastern suburban division,? said a senior officer. ?Tangra clinches the first place, with 53 complaints against cops, followed by Narkeldanga,? he added.

 CMspeak ? ?Do not judge people by their dress,? he had exhorted his force ? has clearly fallen on deaf ears.

 In the past year, more than 50 cases of extortion and torture and 23 cases of atrocity against the poor have been recorded in the Port area. The maximum number of complaints, 21, has been lodged with Garden Reach police station.

 Deputy commissioner (headquarters) Pradip Chatterjee said: ?We forward complaints against our men to the divisional deputy commissioners for inquiry. Prompt action will be taken against cops found guilty.?

 Forget prompt, any action is hardly ever taken. A senior officer cites ?lack of evidence? and ?inadequate vigilance staff? as major problems in policing policemen.

 Now, Lalbazar is making a move to the rein in rogue cops and thanas. ?We start a probe on receiving a complaint, but the process takes time. So, we are planning to set up a cell that will deal only with complaints against cops,? said Singh.

 Calcutta?s cuisine and nightclub craze has not just come a long way ? it?s also going places.

 Seared Wild Salmon from Kochi, Masala Crab Cake Chennai-style or Mirchi Prawns, Rajma amp; Goat Cheese and Lamb Bhuna done the Goanese way? The cream of Indian coastal cuisine can soon be savoured on one of the world?s most celebrated waterfronts, Clarke Quay in Singapore, with a Calcutta eatery setting out to tantalise Southeast Asian taste buds for the first time.

 Grain of Salt, after taking the city gourmand on a culinary trek with its global platter at 22 Camac Street, is shining its silverware to lay the tables at its 100-cover fine-dining outlet in the island nation?s upper-crust hub of speciality F amp;B stops this July. The Nizam?s pillaf and the seafood skewers will take on the menu might of bite biggies like Forbidden City and Hooters, day and night.

 And through the night, Shisha, the popular hookah lounge here, will match steps with nightlife rockers like the Ministry of Sound and the Crazy Horse Paris cabaret. The 75-seater format is complete with flavoured hookahs and DJ Girish at the console.

 The next stop after Singapore on the Grain-Shisha global roadmap is London, where plans are afoot to open a speciality restaurant ?by this yearend?, followed by another dine-disc combo in New York. Mainland Europe and West Asia will be next in the pecking order.

 Singapore has over 2,500 big restaurants but Clarke Quay is where the real action is. ?We chose Clarke Quay because that?s where the finest rub shoulders, and we decided on coastal Konkani since our repeated recces threw up that segment as the sole deficiency,? says Nitin Kohli, director, PDK Shenaz Hotels, which owns the Grain and Shisha brands.

 Singaporean design house Jane Yeo Design Consultants, which specialises in hospitality addresses, has been appointed to create the design solution for the 7,000-sq-ft property leased from Capita Land, which owns nearly 45 per cent of the properties on the swank island.

 If rentals at the much-sought-after waterfront are stiff, the entry barriers, particularly for overseas entrants, are stiffer, since Singapore is forever scouting for novelties and Clark Quay, where the upmarket critical mass comes to dine, is averse to duplication of concepts.

 ?We had to spend months and fly in and out umpteen times to convince the landlords that we will actually be bringing something new to the table,? says Pankaj Tandon, who will be managing director of PDK Shenaz Pte Ltd. The fully-owned Singapore subsidiary of PDK Shenaz Calcutta will run the restaurant and nightclub.

 ?We know the competition is absolutely world-class. However, if the concept is right and the service standards are impeccable, Singapore gives everybody a chance to grow,? observes Arvind Bhatnagar, head of operations, PDK group.

 While the management plans to take its successful buffet concept to Singapore, the idea is not to ?mess around with the tried and tested? formula of Shisha, with its flavoured hookahs and DJ tracks, barring minor alterations to suit local preferences.

 ?The perception of Indian food abroad has mostly been limited to North Indian tandoor or the South Indian dosaidli varieties. Singapore?s fascination for seafood prompted us to go coastal at Clarke Quay. Likewise, we would like to introduce different elements and plug the gap wherever we go,? says Kohli.

 The PDK group will also throw open its foreign facilities to its Platinum Lounge members.

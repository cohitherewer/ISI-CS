 Hawker ouster guns out

 - One-third of pavement will be kept clear for pedestrians

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 On a prod from the high court, the state government and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) are finally set to adopt a uniform policy on hawkers to help clear many roads and large portions of the pavements of encroachments and goods.

 Both the state government and the city?s civic authorities, through separate affidavits, will inform the high court on June 16 that they will introduce the new policy soon.

 According to legal sources, the government and the CMC, in their affidavits, will inform the court that they will undertake massive drives to remove hawkers who have encroached on roads and clear merchandise that shop-owners dump on the pavements and roads.

 The CMC will issue licences to hawkers and make it mandatory for them to follow certain guidelines to run their business on pavements.

 In accordance with the National Hawkers Policy, certain roads and pavements of the central business district of the city will be kept free of hawkers.

 In other areas, they will not be allowed to occupy more than two-thirds of pavements. 

 Instead of constructing kiosks on pavements, they will have to cart their merchandise on stalls on wheels.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya confirmed on Wednesday that both the government and the CMC have decided to start removing merchandise from pavements and roads as soon as possible. 

 It was also decided that one-third of all pavements will have to be left free for pedestrians. Other systems will be introduced gradually. 

 The mayor confirmed that the CMC is going to file an affidavit before the high court on June 16.

 Earlier, on May 20, a division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice Soumitra Sen, while hearing a petition filed by environment activist Subhas Dutta, had directed the state and the civic body to file affidavits stating their stands with regard to hawker removal.

 Another issue will come up for hearing before the court on June 16. As per an earlier court order, the city police will have to file an affidavit about their traffic signalling policy in the city. 

 The bench had asked police to inform it whether the force was in a position to change its auto-manual signalling system or not. The bench felt that the present signalling system of the traffic police was faulty.

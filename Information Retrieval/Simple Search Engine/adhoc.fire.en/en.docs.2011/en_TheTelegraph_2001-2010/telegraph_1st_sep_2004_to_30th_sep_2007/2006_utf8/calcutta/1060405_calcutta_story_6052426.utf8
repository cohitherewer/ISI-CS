 What: Rakhi Sawant 

 night.

 Where: Tantra. 

 When: Saturday night.

 The seductress: Rakhi Sawant has danced her way into the hearts ? or would that be aiming too high ? of screen gazers around the country. After making her big screen debut with Mohabbat hai mirchi, Rakhi has moved on to a number of hit remix videos including Pardesiya, Haadsa and most recently Buddha mil gaya. She also boasts cameo appearances in box-office hits such as Main Hoon Na and the recent success story Malamaal Weekly.

 The show: Calcutta, however, knows the dancing sensation best for her raunchy moves on the bar top at Tantra. Saturday was one such night when the party people thronged the disc on Park Street. And Rakhi did not disappoint the oglers. 

 In a silver outfit that left little to the imagination, she first danced to tracks like Aankhiyan na maar, Pardesiya, Ek ajnabee, Honto pe aisi baat , Mohobbat hai mirchi, Zindaa and Haadsa. 

 The second set saw her change into another revealing gold number as she did the bump and grind to Kajra re, Salaam namaste, Mummy ko nahin hai pata, Budhha mil gaya and Deedar de.

 See you

 What: Performance by Hastalavista (Spanish for see you soon), a band of two girls.

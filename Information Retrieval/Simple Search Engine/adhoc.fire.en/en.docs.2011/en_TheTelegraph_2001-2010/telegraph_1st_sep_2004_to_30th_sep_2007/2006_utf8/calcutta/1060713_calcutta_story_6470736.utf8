 Bleak past, void ahead

 KINSUK BASU

 At 86, Satyen Bose?s weary eyes have seen too many deaths ? his son, his wife, and now his daughter, Purabi.

 Purabi Das Majumdar, 47, died when a bomb exploded in the bus carrying pilgrims from Bengal at Dal Gate in Srinagar on Tuesday morning.

 On Wednesday evening, as Dum Dum Park waited for the dead and the wounded, Bose looked back on a life of tragedy and into a void ahead.

 The eyes ? that have recently undergone surgery ?cringe in pain as they recount the losses, one after the other.

 ?My son Mihir was 17 when we lost him in an accident. That was in 1968 and we lived in Baguiati then. I had a flourishing business in imported timber and since Babu was my first child, it left us all numb with pain. Almost three decades later, I lost my wife Anima, in February 1997.?

 From them on, his life revolved round Buri (Purabi). ?I sold my house in Baguiati and moved to Dum Dum Park just to be close to her. I would wake up every morning thinking that at least I have my daughter. But now even she is gone,? Bose said, eyes moistening, fingers gripping the arms of his wooden chair.

 When Satyen?s son-in-law Subir Das Majumdar had informed the octogenarian about their grand plan of visiting Kashmir, he had opposed it, urging them to find a safer holiday destination.

 ?I told them that having lost everyone, they were all I had, but Buri smiled and assured me there was nothing to worry, as she would return soon? I wished I had stopped them. Look at me now, waiting for my daughter?s body,? cried Satyen Bose, moving away from the last remaining ray of light on the balcony to the darkness of the room.

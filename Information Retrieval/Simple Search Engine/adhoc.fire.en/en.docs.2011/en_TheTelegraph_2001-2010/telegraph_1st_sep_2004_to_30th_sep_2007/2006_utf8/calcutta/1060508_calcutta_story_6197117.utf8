 Tagore?s tales today

What would have happened to Charulata, Ratan, Tarapada and Shubha had Rabindranath Tagore not ended their stories where he had in Galpoguchchha? Stretching his imagination, Kaushik Ganguly is scripting a sequel to a clutch of four Tagore stories that had also been made into films. 

 Tarpar Rabindranath, to be shown as part of Kabipaksha to mark the bard?s birth anniversary on Zee Bangla, consists of Nashta Neer, Postmaster, Atithi and Shubha.

?I have taken some of the protagonists which didn?t 

see an end in Tagore?s stories. Assuming that 20-25 years have passed since, I 

am trying to capture the progression keeping the original stories in mind,? says 

Ganguly, who is linking his version of Nashta Neer with Satyajit Ray?s 

Charulata, retaining Madhabi Mukherjee in the title role. 

 The year is 1984 and Charulata is a lonely dowager, guarding the decrepit house that once resounded with Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee) roaring Hare murari. A Sikh youth (Badshah Moitra) is a tenant in a portion of the house that land sharks want to grab. But Charulata decides to sell it off to a couple from Pondicherry (played by Churni Ganguly and Pulak Lahiri).

 ?Charulata is a lonely woman in a modern situation and her relationship with Amal will be reflected through Churni and Badshah,? says Ganguly. The telefilm is currently being shot at Baruipur Rajbari and a house in Bhowanipore. 

 In Ganguly?s version of Postmaster, a story that mirrors the fond relationship between master and servant, Ratan (Sudipta Chakraborty) has grown up into a young woman. She still works as a maid and wields more authority than her post would allow. But the dynamics of the relationship alters with the entry of a young postmaster. ?With every postmaster, Ratan has assumed the role of the lady of the household. The equation changes this time, specially when the man goes back home, gets married and brings his bride. Ratan is reduced to just a servant and it becomes a struggle for survival for her,? he explains.

 Atithi told the tale of a young footloose Tarapada who could never stay in one place for long; Ganguly has pushed him to the centre of a subdued love triangle involving the daughter of his landlord and a colleague. The cast features Parambrata Chatterjee, Monami Ghosh and Samata Das. 

Deaf mute Shubha from the eponymous story has matured into a woman (played by Satabdi Roy). Her husband has a second wife who gives birth to a deaf mute baby. Neglected by his parents, the child communicates with Shubha. ?A bridge forms between the two and the child takes Shubha to be his mother despite what others try to convince him,? says Ganguly. 

 The series will be shown on Zee Bangla from May 15, Monday to Friday, at 9.30 pm.

Sensuality focus in final splash

Fashion Week- Delhi

 Actors Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapur walk the 

ramp for Manish Malhotra. 

The curtains came down on the India Fashion Week in 

New Delhi on Sunday night, with the usual grandeur that accompanies a grand finale. 

Finale designer Manish Malhotra, predictably, lined up a star cast on the ramp 

 Urmila Matondkar, Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapur as well as an impressive 

collection markedly different from his all-white winter line unveiled in Mumbai 

earlier this year.

The finale flagged off with a dance performance by 

a duo that introduced the Sensuality theme. Urmila, pretty in a flowing pink skirt 

and fitted upper, opened the show. The actress did a super-filmi catwalk 

round, almost tripping on the skirt more than once.

Kareena, however, was in control of herself (and Shahid 

as well) as the couple rounded off the show, dressed to kill in all black. Kareenas 

long flowing empire-line dress was complemented by Shahids black corduroy 

jacket teamed with black trousers and white shirt. Black is the ultimate 

hue of sensuality. So after showing a whole lot of whites, salmons and reds, I 

decided to end the show with a touch of black, Manish explained the final 

contrast to the rest of the colour palette.

While Shahid admitted to being very nervous 

on the ramp, the confident Bebo thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the experience. 

I loved the feeling of being on the ramp and did not want to get off it. 

But sadly, time was running out and it had to end, smiled the actress.

Its always great to be dressed in Manishs 

creations and its always great to walk the ramp for him, gushed Urmila, 

who had last catwalked for the designer six years ago.

The high point of Manishs spring-summer line 

was an English floral print in red and green on a white base. The print dominated 

most parts of the collection, coupled with a collage digital design. The Sensuality 

theme was presented through sheers and soft fabrics (chiffons, nets, satins, silks 

and jerseys), as well as the colour palette (salmon pinks, beiges, creams, nudes, 

cherry reds and more). 

An array of dresses long, short, empire-lines, skirts 

of all lengths from floor-kissing ones to flared minis, knee-length pants, corsets, 

capris, summer jackets, swim wear and cocktail saris made up the collection. The 

men sported printed fitted tees, shirts and jackets with plain white trousers. 

Generous doses of embroidery, lacework, a touch of pleating, patchwork (on mens 

jackets) and mirror work decorated the clothes. The collection was accessorised 

with broad embellished belts, big crocheted bags and long neckpieces.

The decor echoed the sensuality focus, with white 

satin drapes flowing across the show area. The crowd saw a sprinkle of star faces 

 Madhur Bhandarkar, Shekhar Suman, Amjad Ali Khan with wife Subhalakshmi and 

sons Amaan and Ayaan, and Shobhaa De.

Earlier in the day, Suneet Varma unveiled a diffusion 

line inspired by African art and culture. The influence was portrayed through 

animal prints, tribal motifs, basic African colours and even some of the silhouettes. 

A combination of vegetable dye, patchwork, hand-embroidery, applique, prints and 

knits brought about an eclectic feel. Ivory, indigo, forest green and rust coloured 

the clothes. Tunics, wrap-tops, capes, a variety of dresses, skirts, trousers, 

kurtas and saris formed the line. Beads, wood, leather and cowrie shells embellished 

the garments. Chunky tribal jewellery and braided African hairdos completed the 

look.

Africa bombards your senses. Nothing is quite 

what it seems at first sight and it is the spiritual significance and links with 

the past that capture the imagination, said Suneet.

The show preceding Suneets by designer Ranna 

Gill also had a folk focus. The Asian Ikat and the Abr-Bundi craft by the Uzbek 

and Tadjek groups worked as the inspiration behind Rannas colourful line. 

The line titled Ikat comprised popular dress 

silhouettes kimono, wrapped, pinafore, pleated empire-line, peasant and gowns. 

There were skirts teamed with peasant blouses, jersey tops, tunics and day jackets 

with puffed sleeves. Ikat prints and extensive embroidery made up the look. Red, 

fuchsia, indigo, turquoise, green and more formed the vibrant palette. Fabrics 

were silks, cottons, jerseys, voiles, linens and blends.

Manoviraj Khosla didnt manage to make much of 

an impact with his sexy line powered by biking. The women flaunted skirts, from 

minis to A-lines and tops, from bustiers to tees and blouses. The men walked in 

jackets, tees and shirts. Saffron, red, turquoise, green, lilac, rust, orange 

along with the black-and-white combo formed the palette. Textures with crinkling, 

shredding and rivets, applique, pin-tucks and multi-coloured floral embroidery 

described the look.

Anita Dongre had started the day with a patriotic 

line named India Rocks, which focussed on crafts techniques of India on 

western silhouettes. Blue pottery colours of Rajasthan as well as whites with 

tonal treatment coloured the line of cocktail dresses.

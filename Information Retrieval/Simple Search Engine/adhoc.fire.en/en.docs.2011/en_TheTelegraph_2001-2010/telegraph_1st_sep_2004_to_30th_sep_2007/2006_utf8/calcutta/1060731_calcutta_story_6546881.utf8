The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Slums are ballot bowls

 Subrata Mukherjee, former mayor and present councillor of ward 87, met readers of The Telegraph. 

Participants included Nandita Banerjee, Sonali Ghosh, Uttam Mondol, Kamal Hazra, Swapan Dasgupta, Arka Bose

Nandita Banerjee: The civic taxpayers are the most unfortunate and neglected community in the city. There are many who don?t even pay a single paisa as property tax to the civic body. We are the scapegoats, we have to pay huge amount of money as property tax. A flat-owner has to shell out 38 per cent of the annual valuation of his flat as the annual property tax. Please tell us what to do?

 I admit that the house-owners and the flat-owners living in Calcutta proper have to pay heavy taxes to the civic body. In my last budget, I had announced a 15 per cent slash of property taxes for the house-owners. Subsequently, an order was also issued. But I am surprised that the present civic body is not following the order.

 I know that the house-owners, living in the areas that were added to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area in 1984, pay one-fifth of the tax paid by the owners living in Calcutta proper. Slums are ballot-bowls for the ruling party, so they are against any sort of tax on the slum-dwellers. 

Sonali Ghosh: You are the councillor of Ward 87, but you never go to the civic headquarters for any development work in your ward. Are you doing justice to the people living in your ward? 

 Do you live in my ward? Are you facing problems regarding any civic amenity? I am fortunate that there is not a single slum in my ward and therefore, I don?t rush to the CMC office very often. Besides, my men are working in the ward round-the-clock. They inform me about every development. 

Uttam Mondol: During your tenure as mayor, you didn?t employ a single unemployed cadre. You even had a favourable order from the court but you did not recruit the empanelled block sarkars. Now, the present board has employed more that 150 party activists. Why couldn?t you do something? 

 Do you have any proof of your information? I have no idea that activists have been employed by the present board. 

 Regarding the recruitment of empanelled block sarkars, I would request present mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to absorb them immediately. He is morally bound to do this, since he was the advocate of the block sarkars in court. 

Swapan Dasgupta: You have held many important portfolios in your party, in the civic body, in government and trade union. Which were the best and the worst phases in your career?

 My best period was when I was the mayor. And interestingly, that was the worst period, too. It was during that period that partymen gheraoed me. My partymen didn?t support me. 

Kamal Hazra: The Gariahat treasury scandal took place during your tenure. But why didn?t you take any initiative to bust the racket?

 The racket was first busted during my tenure but that does not mean that the siphoning of money by manipulating computers took place only at that particular point of time. 

 It had been continuing for a long period and because of our alertness, we could bust it. I lodged an FIR and a few men were arrested. I had even suspended a few of them involved in the racket. 

 But as the civic polls were due at that time and we lost the polls, we couldn?t complete our mission. The present board decided to sit on the file. And after a long battle over eight months and following pressure from the Opposition, the CPM board at last suspended them. 

Nandita Banerjee: Citizens Park is just like a white elephant. By spending Rs 10 crore of public money, you did not create an asset but a liability for us. What is the use of such a park?

 Citizens Park is one of the landmarks of our city. It is the biggest gift to Calcutta by the CMC after the Raj era. Since, the present board cannot maintain it, they are telling you all these things. Present mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya wants to hand-over the well-developed park to some businessman, like Millennium Park, for minting money. Millennium Park was also developed by using public money and later handed over to a private party.

 We Ask You Answer

 A few yards for livelihood

 Today?s question: Do you support the mayor?s call to bring hawkers back to the pavement? More responses will be published next week

 Space for a living: Hawkers are back on the pavement 

 Gauri Mitra,

 Salt Lake

 The mayor?s call means more makeshift stalls blocking the pavements and causing harassment to pedestrians. The mayor is possibly thinking about the hawkers, but who will think about the pedestrians? 

 Dalim Kumar Datta, 

 APC Road

 I support the mayor?s call as long as the hawkers do not impede movement of pedestrians. The hawkers should not set up stalls near road intersections or keep their stalls open during office time.

 Mahasweta Saha, 

 Garia

 I strongly support the mayor?s decision. He had failed to provide the hawkers alternative accommodation to carry on their business, and hence had to call them back to the pavement. The unemployment count being higher in West Bengal compared to other states, the hawkers cannot be removed. 

 S.N. Mitra,

 Beleghata 

 There are hawkers in all parts of the world and Calcutta cannot be an exception. I support the mayor?s decision.

B.N. Bose,

 Dum Dum 

 Certainly not. There is no way the hawkers can sell their wares without inconveniencing pedestrians. Even if they are designated particular spots on the pavements, they will move to where there is better chance of business. Moreover, the mayor?s call is an election gimmick. He is not really interested in the betterment of hawkers. 

 Sourish Misra,

 Salt Lake

 It is unfortunate that the mayor has asked hawkers to return to the pavement. The situation on the city streets is grave. The footpaths on busy roads have been totally or partially encroached upon by the hawkers and the common people are suffering every day due to this. 

 Ratan Kumar Halder,

 Behala

 I am totally against the mayor?s call. Several road mishaps have occurred due to illegal encroachment of the pavement. Instead of showing misplaced kindness, the mayor should rehabilitate the hawkers in a market. 

P. Pramanik, 

 Santoshpur

 I was astonished at the mayor?s call for hawkers to return to the pavement. Bikash Bhattacharyya doesn?t have to walk down city streets and that?s why he could act so irresponsibly. During my school days, in the 1940s, the hawkers used to move about with their wares. That should be revived.

 Ratan Gupta,

 Behala

 I don?t support the mayor?s call to bring back hawkers to the pavement, but I don?t blame him. The leaders of the ruling party cannot be expected to know that hawkers are those who carry their goods from place to place. Those who sell their goods at one spot are called shopkeepers, not hawkers. 

 Sunil Banerjee, 

 VIP road

 The mayor?s call is unethical and deprives us of the basic right to walk freely. Due to offensive behaviour by the hawkers, many pedestrians are forced to risk their lives by walking along the carriageway. It is not possible to tackle the problem without political will and the leaders are exploiting the situation.

 Shyamal Ranjan Ray,

 Address not given

 Hawkers are a necessary evil. They should ideally be relocated to a market. If that is not possible, they should be made to adhere to rules.

 Bratini Shome,

 Behala

 I do not support the mayor?s call. Hawkers need a place to earn their livelihood. A market for the rehabilitation of hawkers is the most appropriate solution.

 P.N. Pal,

 Karaya Road

 The mayor?s call cannot be supported as it will encourage encroachment of pavements, and consequently, accidents. An isolated operation to ?drive out? hawkers will be useless. But a permanent solution is not forthcoming due to vested interests.

 K.K. Ahmed,

 Collin Lane

 I don?t support the mayor?s call. The chief minister had issued a similar call recently. Both the statements were made with an eye on the Assembly election. We should not forget that the ruling parties had once evicted hawkers. Crores were wasted on plans to rehabilitate them. They thrive because of corrupt cops and leaders. The mayor has no right to appease hawkers at the cost of tax-paying citizens.

naren sen,

 Howrah

 The mayor?s call is absurd. Why should anyone call back hawkers to congested roads? Leaders are compromising with the development of the city to garner votes. Worse, they have wasted a lot of money in the name of hawker rehabilitation.

 B.K. Choudhary,

 Kankinara

 Yes, because many people survive by hawking on the pavement. The hawkers should be made responsible for the area where they set up their stalls. They should keep the surroundings clean and leave enough space for the pedestrians.

 D. Mukherjee,

 Behala

 The hawker problem has aggravated because of the apathy of the administration. They should not be removed without proper rehabilitation. Police should be put on alert so that more hawkers do not set up business in the city. The mayor?s call is an attempt to secure more votes in the Assembly elections. An eviction call might be sounded once the poll results are out.

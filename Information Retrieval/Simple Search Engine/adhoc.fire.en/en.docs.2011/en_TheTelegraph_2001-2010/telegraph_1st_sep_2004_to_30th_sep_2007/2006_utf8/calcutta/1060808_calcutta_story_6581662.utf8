 Scan on CIT flats

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) engineers have been asked to inspect the Kasba apartments whose balconies collapsed on Saturday night, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Monday. The CIT will take action on the basis of the report.

 Some of the CIT quarters are in a poor condition the walls have cracked and the balconies are hanging precariously. We will tag those buildings dangerous. If any mishap occurs thereafter, we will not be responsible, he said.

 The CIT has decided to sell its apartments to those who are staying in them. A month ago, it had issued the tenants forms for buying the flats. 

 A ground-floor, one-room flat of 250 sq ft will cost Rs 16,000. A flat of the same size on the first or second floor will be priced at Rs 18,000. Flats with more than one room will cost Rs 65,000.

 If the tenants agree to pay the amount, the government will repair the flats, the minister added. He also said the government plans to use some of the quarters for commercial purposes.

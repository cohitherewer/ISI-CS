 The civic body on Sunday flagged off an exercise to make BBD Bag more of a draw for tourists and those interested in Calcuttas heritage.

 NGOs People United For Better Living In Calcutta (PUBLIC) and Action Research in Conservation of Heritage (Arch) have been engaged for the purpose. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has also sought the help of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said PUBLIC has been asked to keep the area free of posters and graffiti. We have asked the other NGO (Arch) to create a heritage trail. This means it will prepare a list of the main heritage sites, publish information brochures and create a bank of guides who will give interested people a tour of the area, he added.

 A token amount will be paid to the NGOs annually for their services.

 Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC said the organisation would remove posters and graffiti from the walls of heritage buildings every Sunday with the help of schoolchildren, serving as volunteers. We started the work today.

 Manish Chakraborty of Arch stated it had shortlisted about a dozen heritage sites for the guided tour. It will begin and end at Great Eastern Hotel and will be held on Saturdays and Sundays. 

 The CII has agreed to fund signboards in front of heritage buildings in the area, detailing their historical and architectural importance. The civic body will provide the text for the signboards.

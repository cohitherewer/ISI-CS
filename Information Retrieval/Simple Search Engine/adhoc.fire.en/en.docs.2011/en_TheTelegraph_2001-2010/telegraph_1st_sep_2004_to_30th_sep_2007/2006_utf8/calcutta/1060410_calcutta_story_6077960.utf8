 Attack on car showroom

 - Goons beat up Agarpara outlet employees

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Employees of a car showroom in Kamarhati, near Agarpara, were beaten up by local goons on Saturday morning on the shop premises. The attackers forced their way into RD Motors ? at 149, BT Road ? around 10.30 am and beat up the workers.

 ?We had just opened for the day on Saturday morning when 20-odd people, led by Naeem Khan, a local goon, and an office bearer of the 230 bus stand union, barged in. They were looking for the logistics officer and the works manager who assign duties to drivers and servicemen,? said a manager of the showroom.

 ?Once they spotted the two, they started beating them up in front of other employees and abused them. The logistics officer was hit on his chest. Even the accounts officer did not escape their wrath. The goons left after threatening that from Monday, the employees would join work at their own risk,? he added.

 According to RD Motors employees, Sukanto Bardhan, an employee, was slapped a fine of Rs 800 for mishandling a car-servicing equipment. RD Motors had been forced to employ Bardhan last year on the insistence of Khan, and hence the attack by his henchmen.

 ?Sukanto worked as a driver, but was transferred to the servicing department because of his rudeness. Early this week, an equipment was badly damaged due to his negligence. In accordance with the rules, he was slapped a fine of Rs 800, which was to be deducted from his salary over a period of four months. When he was told about this, he threatened us with dire consequences,? said an employee.

 The management of RD Motors said it was not the first time that local goons had heckled them. They alleged that the goons often force them to employ their candidates and also demand cars from the service station for personal work.

 ?We often have to give them cars for their personal work. We cannot say no to these unreasonable demands because we have to carry on our business in this area,? said a manager of the showroom. 

 ?But this time they crossed all limits. After the attack, we have posted an armed security guard outside our showroom and beefed up the unarmed security too. We have also lodged an FIR with Khardah police station,? he added.

 ?We are acting on the complaint. Once we round up the accused named in the FIR, the employees of RD Motors will be called to identify them,? said an officer of Khardah police station.

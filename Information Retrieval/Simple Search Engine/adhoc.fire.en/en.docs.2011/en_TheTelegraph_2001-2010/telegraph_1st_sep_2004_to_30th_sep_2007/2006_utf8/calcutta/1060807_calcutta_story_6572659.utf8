 Nikhil Biswas belonged to a generation of artists, who, during the early decades of the post-Independence period, were greatly involved in changing the art scenario of the country. Perhaps by virtue of his predictive stance and, at times, an uncanny apocalyptic vision, he is one among very few artists ever to have been recognised as a genius in his own lifetime, as after his death. Most of his serious compositions were done on paper in ink, with brush or pen. Side by side, he also worked on transparent and opaque watercolours, depicting the lighter and more cheerful aspects of life. His later paintings, done in oil, have the same haunting quality as his earlier black-and-white drawings. The exhibition of his paintings, being inaugurated today, reflects the mind of the man in its multiple, creative dimensions.

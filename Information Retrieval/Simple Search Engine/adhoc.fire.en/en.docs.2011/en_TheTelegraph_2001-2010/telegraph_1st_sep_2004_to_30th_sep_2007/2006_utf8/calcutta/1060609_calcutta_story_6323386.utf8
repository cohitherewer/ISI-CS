 Painting palms to beat odds

 She grew up on the pavement facing Harish Park, saw her father die there, and dropped out of school to make sure that her siblings studied on. Yet, she never let the colours fade from her life.

 Today, 21-year-old Sunita Haldar earns a living and helps support her family applying mehendi on the palms of young brides and teenaged girls. 

 Sunita was not even into her teens when she lost her father in 1997. But she resolved to see her family ? mother, an elder sister and a younger brother ? tide over the crisis. ?I thought it would be a good idea to make a living by applying mehendi. I had learnt the art watching others. I approached Minu Mundra, a resident of Harish Mukherjee Road, who introduced me to my first clients, her friends,? recalls Sunita.

 Since then, she sits daily on the pavement where her father had died ? buried beneath the rubble of a collapsed structure, part of which still stands, dilapidated ? and applies mehendi.

 And Sunita proudly announces that she has achieved some of her dreams, having helped her siblings stand on their feet. Her sister passed a nursing course and is working in a clinic. Her brother, who has cleared Higher Secondary, is employed by a neighbourhood CESC office. ?I am proud of what they have achieved through sheer hard work,? says Sunita.

 She, however, could not pursue studies beyond Madhyamik. ?My mother used to look after our tea stall while we studied under a lamp post. The money I was earning was not enough for our school fees. As my sister and brother showed promise, I decided to drop out and help them keep studying,? Sunita says.

 She still has a long way to go. ?One day, I would like to be famous as a mehendiwali.? Her clientele has grown over the years and across the city. She charges Rs 75 for regular mehendi and Rs 2,100 for dulhan mehendi. Sarda Bajaj, a resident of Bangur Avenue, says: ?Sunita is excellent with designs and all my friends go to her.? Adds Minu Mundra: ?Brief her on any design and she will produce it in seconds.?

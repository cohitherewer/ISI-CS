 An artist of international repute, G?nther Uecker shows in many of his works an inner portrait of his visions of life and suffering. As he himself proclaims, ?My subject is life and death ?.? Man?s Inhumanity: 14 Pacified Implements, the ongoing exhibition of his works, processes experiences, registers feelings and tries to reveal, in his sensitive setting of signs, basic human drives like aggression, injury, destruction and setting them against gestures of reconciliation. They represent his protest against tyranny, cruelty and barbarism, and are an expression of his agitation at all forms of human oppression. Uecker reacts to the ?injury of human being by human being? in the language of form typical of him ? with slats of wood, linen cloths, stones, ash, sand, pages with writing and, of course, nails. The actual background of these works, created in 1992-93, was the violence against foreigners in Germany that continues even today.

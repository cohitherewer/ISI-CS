The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Star minus the tag

 After tasting super success in mainstream masala movies, SAIF ALI KHAN is now Being Cyrus simply because he can choose work and experiment with films, he tells Pratim D. Gupta 

 Saif Ali Khan (with 

 Dimple Kapadia in picture above) in moments from Being 

 Cyrus 

 A top-notch Bollywood star 

 doing a small-budget English film by a first-time director. 

 Why did you agree to do Being Cyrus?

 I have been offered quite a few non-commercial films. I just take three minutes to decide whether I want to do a film or not. Fortunately, now I am in a position to choose work and experiment with the kind of films I do. As for a first-time director, I never thought Homi was making his debut or anything. After reading the script I knew it?s a great film to be a part of and I must tell you although this is Homi?s first film he was very clear about what he wanted from each of us.

 Aamir Khan once said he wanted 

 to do an English film as that is the language he thinks 

 in. Does the same apply to you? How much did you enjoy doing 

 an English language movie?

 Actually the first reason why I was involved in an English film was because I always wanted to do something in English. I wanted to do this film because many of us speak in English in this country and not lots of English films come out of India.

 I thought it would be easy to work in an English language film, but no, now I think it is as difficult as working in Hindi. Hindi is more physically expressive while in English you need to ensure that it doesn?t look like a stage play.

 You are one of the few Indian 

 actors who revels in under-acting. Was Being Cyrus 

 in the same mould where it?s more in the mind than in the 

 mouth?

 Yes, definitely, Being Cyrus is a very unusual film, something which has never been made before and I had to understand it very well to carry the role perfectly. It was like? my actions had to speak more than words.

 You have worked with first-time 

 directors like Pradeep Sarkar, Siddharth Raj Anand and Homi 

 Adajania. Was it tough adapting to the different story-telling 

 techniques and styles?

 Honestly speaking, whether it?s Pradeepda or Siddharth, I feel I?ve moved to a different level as an actor working with them. People like Siddharth and Homi are ready to experiment and expand their horizons. It was great working with all of them.

 Naseeruddin Shah says that 

 Being Cyrus and Omkara will be watershed performances 

 in your career. Would you agree?

 Oh, I am fortunate that he thinks this way about me. I am trying my best to do good things and I hope I have been able to shed the star tag.

 What was it like working with 

 him?

 Naseer is one of the great actors we have in our industry. I respect him a lot and it?s very difficult to match the sensibility of a person of his calibre. It was overwhelming to share the screen with such accomplished actors. 

 In fact one of the reasons why I chose to do this film was because I was getting an opportunity to share the screen with them.

 Dimple, Naseer or Boman, I have learnt something or the other from each of them. In fact, I?ll tell you something, I really get along well with Boman and it was only after I did the small episode of Darna Mana Hai with him that I started doing different kind of acting in unusual films.

 You couldn?t romance Dimple 

 Kapadia on screen in Dil Chahta Hai but here...

 Oh, I don?t have any mushy scene with her as people seem to be thinking, but yeah it was great sharing the same space on the screen with her.

 Finally, how does it feel these 

 days to be Saif Ali Khan?

 It feels great but I still have to do a lot. I am still in the process of learning. I hope people keep on supporting me with their affection.

 What: 

 Italian food festival.

 Where: The Atrium Cafe 

 at The Park.

 When: Till December 3.

 The spread: The Emilia 

 Romagna menu kicks off with a variety of antipasti Zuppettina 

 di Cozze e Vongole al Pomodoro (mussels and clams stew with 

 tomato sauce and garlic croutons), Insalata di Pollo Affumicato 

 e Patate con Maionese Verde (smoked chicken salad with potato 

 and green mayonnaise), Rucola Pere e Gorgonzola (rocket, 

 pears and gorgonzola cheese salad with lemon vinaigrette) 

 and more. 

 Move on to the Zuppe (soups) section 

 and then in pastas relish Ravioli di Patate con Salsa ai 

 Carciofi (potato-filled ravioli with creamy artichokes sauce), 

 Spaghetti ai Funghi Porcini e Proscuitto di Parma e Pelati 

 san Marzano (spaghetti with Italian tomato pelati, Parma 

 ham and Porcini mushrooms) or Cappelletti di Pollo Alla 

 Bolognese (stuffed cappelletti with chicken in a meat bolognaise 

 sauce).

 There is quite a selection of 

 risottos, before you come to I Piatti Forti, the section 

 with main-course dishes like Gamberoni al Guazzetto (jumbo 

 prawns poached with fennel, onion, tomato, carrot and spring 

 onion), Filetto di Manzo con Porcini e Verdure Alla Griglia 

 (beef tenderloin with Porcini mushroom sauce and grilled 

 vegetables), Scaloppina di Pollo al Limone e Menta con Pure 

 di Patate e Verdurine Bollite (chicken escalopes with lemon 

 sauce, mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables) or Cannelloni 

 di Ricotta e Spinaci al Forno (oven-baked cheese and spinach 

 cannelloni).

 Round it off with desserts like 

 Salame al Cioccolato (dark chocolate and biscuit roulade 

 served with vanilla sauce and dry fruits), Citrus Tart with 

 Vanilla Ice-Cream, Panna Cotta with Mixed Berry Sauce and 

 Tiramisu.

 Pocket pinch: A la carte 

 dishes for dinner are priced between Rs 215 and Rs 865.

 Voiceover: The focus 

 of this menu is on the Emilia Romagna region. The cuisine 

 in this part of Italy is known for its fresh vegetables 

 and seafood. No preservatives are used in cooking, 

 said executive chef Davide Canazi.

 Indian feast

 What: Launch of new menu.

 Where: Sonargaon at Taj 

 Bengal.

 When: November 22.

 The spread: Retaining some 

 of the signature dishes and introducing an array of exciting 

 new flavours, the menu at Sonargaon has undergone a refreshing 

 change.

 For starters, try Chatpati Rawa 

 Batata Tikki (crispy semolina coated potato kebabs stuffed 

 with cheese and jalapenos), Lasooni Jhinga (jumbo prawns 

 marinated in cheese and garlic and cooked in a clay oven) 

 or Tandoori Salmon (lightly spiced pink salmon). 

 Move on to the main course with 

 delicacies like Raan Sonargaon, Murg Hara Masala, Amritsari 

 Chhole or Mirch Baigan Ka Salan. 

 Enjoy these with vegetable or 

 chicken biryani, in Lucknowi style, or a variety of breads, 

 including the delicious Kabuli Naan.

 In the section titled Fish Market, 

 you can choose from squid, jumbo prawn, lobster, crab, white 

 pomfret, bekti and pabda. You can even get it cooked 

 just the way you want grilled, barbecued, steamed, crispy 

 fried or curried. In the Bengali cuisine section, new preparations 

 like Pabnar Murgi and Golbarir Kosha Aloo have been added.

 The highlight of the new menu, 

 however, is a vegetarian selection dedicated to health food 

 dishes that are cooked in olive oil. Sample this: Tofu Phalli 

 (silken tofu and haricot verts), Lasooni Palak (spinach 

 in garlic), Soya Badi Matar (soya dumplings and green peas). 

 End with Aam ki Shirni and Anjeer 

 Ka Halwa.

 Pocket pinch: A meal for 

 two would cost around Rs 1,600.

 Voiceover: We have 

 incorporated a lot of guest feedback and detailed research 

 has gone into drawing up the new menu, smiled executive 

 chef Sujan Mukherjee.

 SHRADHA AGARWAL

 True to tradition with Bengal basics

 Its that familiar whiff of traditional Bengal the moment you step into Kala Kriti, a quaint little boutique store at 10, Lansdowne Terrace, close to Deshapriya Park. Maybe its the Ma Durga statuette that greets you at the entrance. Maybe its the red terracotta flooring that covers the expanse of the floor. Maybe its the inherent feel of the collection on display. 

 It all adds up because when sisters Radha Kothari and Poonam Tondon set up this place three years ago, the look and feel of Bengal was uppermost on their minds.

 Kala Kriti is basically an extension of Bengal, confirms Radha, the administrative brain behind the store, handling the production and execution of orders. Sibling Poonam provides the design and creative inputs. 

 The brand that was born 10 years ago, purely out of a hobby, can be traced back to a tiny outlet near Chakraberia. But today, this 1,000 sq ft studio-cum-workshop has a very different story to tell.

 What began just like that now has tremendous responsibility attached to it. Kala Kriti is committed to run 12 homes, says Poonam. Indeed, this design den is like a close-knit family, dedicated to the team of printers Sudha, Himanshu, Lakhan, Sanat and Shankar.

 The ambience 

 Textured whitewashed walls set the mood at this store. Jharoka-style windows at regular intervals make way for adequate sunshine and give an extra dimension to the interiors. Colour is added in the form of unfinished terracotta tiles and breaking the relief is a pattern created by mosaic tiles in canary yellow and cobalt blue. A clay statue of Mansadevi, placed near the centre of the store, is the real eye-catcher.

 Lots of bamboo is used here too, both on the ceiling as well as the door of the trial room. A divan, where printing blocks are used as the design detailing, occupies space on one side of the store. A wooden-framed large mirror lends a sense of space to the design hub. Occasional throws of chatai further add to the rustic appeal. The interiors of Kala Kriti have deliberately been kept extremely earthy, reveals Radha.

 The designs

 The forte is prints, prints and more prints. A smooth melange of sensibilities can be noticed when smart stripes combine with feminine florals and solid colour splashes. Each of the printing blocks is developed in-house, the fish design being the signature block. 

 The thing about Kala Kriti is that we never follow fashion fads and trends. Our designs are perennial and standard. Very traditional, but with a slight contemporary twist, stresses the duo.

 These prints are sometimes worked upon by means of hand embroidery, that too sourced from the adjoining districts of Calcutta. 

 The USP of Kala Kriti lies in the striking colour combinations. Here turquoise blends beautifully with sea green and red merges brilliantly with sunrise orange. A very strong partiality towards cream and black is noticed amongst the mostly earthy colour palette. As a result, there is a lot of beige, rust, brown and off-white.

 The season decides our colour story. So there are pastels for the summer months and richer hues for the festive season, says Poonam. About 80 per cent of the stocks comprises salwar kurtas in cottons, jute blends, silk dupion, muls, voiles and a formal range that uses georgette and crepe. These are priced above Rs 1,500. Also available at the store are some saris in cotton and tussar, tagged at Rs 650-plus.

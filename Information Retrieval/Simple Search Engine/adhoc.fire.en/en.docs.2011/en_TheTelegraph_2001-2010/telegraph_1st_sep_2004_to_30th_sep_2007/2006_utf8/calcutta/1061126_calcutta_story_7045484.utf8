 It is essential to combine roti-graphy 

 with photography these days, says lensman Avinash Pasricha, 

 because creativity has to marry purpose. Being 

 a second-generation photographer, and also father of photographer 

 Amit Pasricha, he would know. 

 Avinash was in Calcutta as a jury-member 

 for the BD Bangur Endowments Project Nirmaan on Thursday. 

 And choosing a candidate wasnt easy.

 It is difficult to decide 

 who has the best talent and even tougher to figure out who 

 really needs the money. The industry has changed, 

 says Avinash, recalling his 1960 days. That was when there 

 was hardly any industrial or advertising photography. 

 But look at things now. There are many avenues, much 

 visibility even magazines are 70 per cent photographs. 

 People can earn Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000 per day!

 The veteran lensman, however, 

 is critical of the attitude of the current crop towards 

 photography. People might be re-discovering photography 

 as art but youngsters dont think twice before saying 

 no to wedding photography. I would still do it, adds 

 Avinash.

 Wedding photography he would still 

 do, no doubt, but capturing the moods of Indian dance forms 

 remains his passion.

 For me, it is like meditation. 

 It requires you to concentrate on one thing in this case, 

 the dance moves and expressions at a given point of time. 

 I focus through my camera for that one right moment, that 

 one glint in the eye that makes my picture, smiles 

 Avinash.

 His first tryst with Indian dance 

 took place by sheer chance in a music festival 

 in the mid-60s. My cousin suggested that I capture 

 the mood. There I arrived, with no ear for music, no concern 

 for the audience and began clicking, he recalls. 

 Decades later, now Avinash has 

 earned himself a fixed place in Delhis 

 Kamani Auditorium. Now I can simply sit and shoot, 

 without disturbing anyone, he smiles. 

 The last few years have seen other 

 changes too. Like the great crossover from film rolls to 

 digital cameras. A reluctant Avinash finally made the switch 

 four months ago. 

 But theres nothing 

 like the good old cameras. They gave me five-point satisfaction. 

 I felt joy each time I looked through the camera, then saw 

 the picture develop (if at all it did), the art directors 

 nod of approval, saw it in print and, finally, when the 

 reader remembers the photograph years down the line. Digital 

 isnt bad either, it has taught me wild photography; 

 I can click away without worrying about film wastage!

 The clincher, though, is Avinashs 

 final assessment of why photographs never seem to impress 

 the subject. Ninety-five per cent of photographers 

 are happy with their pictures. But it is the subject who 

 is tough to please everybodys self image is high. 

 They get disappointed when the reality doesnt reflect 

 that, he smiles.

The Telegraph Apartainment, held in association 

with Videocon on Sunday evening, was in-house entertainment at its best, with 

a star judge, surprises galore and a super-enthusiastic crowd.

More than 250 residents of Lake District at 74 and 

74/1, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Sarani (opposite Swabhumi), had a real pre-Puja 

blast. Its an evening we enjoyed thoroughly. We should have one Apartainment 

every month, smiled Dr Parag Baran Pal, convenor of cultural committee, 

Lake District.

Actor Arindam Sil pushed up the glamour quotient. 

An active participant, Arindam defined it as an event that helps the cohesive 

force of a locality by allowing all family members, young or old, 

the pleasure of participation.

Pencil outlines, splashes of colour, shading here 

and there The sit-and-draw session saw around 35 tots, aged three to nine years, 

filling up their drawing sheets with village views, goddess Durga, Independence 

Day, apples and even alphabets! Eight-year-old Khyaati Agarwal, illustrating a 

beautiful sunset in bright yellow and red, stood first. She was awarded a trophy, 

memento and cap. Aishwarya Chakravarty and Niharika Rawat stood second and third. 

Niharikas portrait of Mahatma Gandhi surely seemed inspired by Lage Raho 

Munnabhai. Each won a memento and cap. Others did not go empty-handed either, 

with Cadburys chocolates and TTIS badges being handed out.

A spot quiz followed. Winners were handed out The 

Telegraph diaries and Videocon sling pens. Chatpata crunchies at the 

chaat counter further boosted energy levels.

For little Khushi, it was one birthday she would remember 

for some time to come. Amidst bursting balloons and applause, Khushi took centre 

stage cutting her third birthday cake to the crowd chorus of Happy birthday 

to you... 

Up next, Three Minutes To Fame. The judges for the 

event were actress Deboleena Dutta and Partha Pratim Ray. One participant 

spoke on what she would change if she was the prime minister.

Ankit Soni grooving to the beat of Jhalak dikhla 

ja stood first. The 12-year-old Hrithik Roshan fan said, I want to be 

a dancer, after bagging a trophy, a memento and a cap. Singers Ria Dey and 

Sonika Sil won mementos and caps. Ankeet Saraf was awarded The Telegraph special 

award for speaking on how the media was not only about TRP but a necessary 

source of information. Bhavik Bairagara was declared the Icon of Lake District 

for his impromptu performance on the influence of K-serials on both saas and 

bahu. He walked away with a Videocon DVD player.

Its great to be here. I wish we had opportunities 

like these when we were kids, signed off Deboleena, before scribbling a 

few autographs.

Finally, the Antakshari moderated by Pranam and Tanusree, 

set to sound by Anthony and band, and won by Team G with 105 points. Winners Vinod 

Agarwal, Anita Agarwal and Nikhil Rajgaria lifted the team trophy, with mementos 

and caps.

With just a handful of big names showcasing, the Bollywood 

brush, one would think, is the only trump card of the Lakme Fashion Week. But 

theres much more than screen stars to the ongoing fashion extravaganza in 

the glamour capital. For one, the fashion week scores really high on sheer variety 

on the ramp.

Each collection unveiled so far has boasted a handwriting 

of its own. Epitomising this was the South African Style Meets Bombay Chic show 

on Wednesday evening. Two South African labels Clive Rundle and Sun Goddess 

 showcased their spring-summer 2007 collections on the NCPA ramp. Strikingly 

different from what the fashion week has seen so far, the collections scored on 

richness and variety. The wearability count, though, was rather low.

ive showed first, unveiling an extravagant collection 

with layering as the primary focus. Floor-kissing jackets and gowns, evening dresses, 

skirts, cropped jackets, shirts, loose pants and many more interesting shapes 

were piled on effectively. Bold checks and velvets caught the eye, along with 

unusual prints and loud colours. Orange, burgundy, peach, purple, brown, olive, 

pink, blue as well as whites and blacks made up a riot of hues. A shredded and 

raw-edged look dominated parts of the collection.

The pile-on technique was visible in the Sun Goddess 

collection, too. Layering is a part of South African attire. To give the 

feeling of extravagance and opulence, we pile many layers of clothing, explained 

Asande of the Sun Goddess duo. Drawing from past South African kingdoms, the collection 

had a luxurious feel. Deep scarlet, purple, royal blue, gold, brown, black-and-white 

the palette was rich.

The use of leather as the base fabric as well as in 

patches was an important technique here. The other dominant feature was the use 

of animal prints and peacock feathers. A mish mash of draping, pleating, applique, 

prints and intricate beadwork defined the look.

We wanted to celebrate Africa and our collection 

drew from all thats typically South African. Globally, people like fashion 

with ethnic influences. But we live in modern times and hence we had to modernise 

those influences, explained Balekwe from Sun Goddess.

Sensual style

The second evening of LFW drew to a close with Wendell 

Rodrickss much-awaited show. A Wendell collection without a Goan inspiration 

is a rarity and once again the designer focussed on flavours of his homeland. 

But instead of the sea, the beaches or the resorts, this time the designer chose 

quite a unique theme. His spring-summer collection titled Les Vamps was 

a tribute to Goas other world, a world of dark secrets.

Like the spirits and exorcists who are almost 

always beautiful women, the collection is mysterious and ethereal, said 

Wendell.

And he went on: Les Vamps is about beauty, 

mystery, secrets, fear and, above all, fashion; for the woman of today who can 

take on many emotions, switching from coy innocence to fierce vamp with equal 

ease. Like the haunting beauty of Goas ghosts, spirits and vampires.

The most sensual collection of the fashion week so 

far was all about fluid, vaporous forms. Volume and layering were dominant, in 

flowing fabrics like silk crepe, chiffons, charmeuse, tulle, organza, crushed 

silk, linen and more. Lots of sheers, angel wings and bat wings added to the sensual 

look.

Net pleating, draping, satin inserts, smoke shading, 

floral accents were some of the techniques used. While the women walked in everything 

from tunics, dresses, skirts to saris, the men sported hot pants, jackets, shirts, 

kurtis, long coats and more. The collection was accessorised with feathers, 

umbrellas and interesting headgear.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Calcutta Column

 In the evenings, commuters have a trying time finding public transport to NSC Bose Road from Tollygunge metro station. The drivers of the NSC Bose Road-bound autorickshaws choose up to where they want to go. Even if there are several autorickshaws at the stand, the drivers make themselves scarce. Most people are dependent on the autorickshaws since it is virtually impossible to get on the packed buses. The number of shuttle-taxis is also limited. The cabbies take advantage of the situation and demand a premium. The elderly people are inconvenienced the most. Unlike others, they cannot jostle their way into the three-wheelers. It is difficult to fathom why the system of queues for the autorickshaws ceases to exist during the busiest hours? Most importantly, why aren?t there more autos? The authorities should try to come up with solutions at the earliest. 

 Rajrupa Banerjee,

 NSC Bose Road. 

 Several food stalls have been set up on the pavements of Jhowtala Road, right from the Mayfair Road crossing. The hawkers have taken up the entire breadth of the footpath by erecting sheds covered with tarpaulin sheets, compelling pedestrians to walk along the carriageway. There have already been several accidents on the stretch. In December 2005, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and other agencies had dismantled the makeshift stalls, only to allow them to be set up again in a few weeks. It was shocking. Why did the CMC authorities demolish the sheds when they had no intention of keeping the pavements encroachment-free?

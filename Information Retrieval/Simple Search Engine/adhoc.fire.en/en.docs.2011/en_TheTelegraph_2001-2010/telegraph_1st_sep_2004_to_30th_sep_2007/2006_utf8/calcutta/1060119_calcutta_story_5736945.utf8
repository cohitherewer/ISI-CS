 TO SWITZERLAND, A SONG ON HER LIPS: Usha Uthup performs. A Telegraph picture

 In Davos, Switzerland, when political leaders and business giants engage in debate and discussion on world issues later this month, a voice from Calcutta will rise in their midst.

 But far from holding forth on topics like job creation and changing economic landscapes, Usha Uthup will sing about love and peace at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, on January 28.

 ?I?m terribly excited about the opportunity to perform at the event,? says Usha, who leaves for the Swiss city with her five-member band on January 25. 

 ?It?s either classical music or Bharatanatyam or Bhangra that usually represents India on such occasions. I?m glad I?ll be able to sing my own music,? says the singer, who was contacted by a Delhi-based event management company for the show. 

 Usha will be performing a ?mixed bag? of songs in different languages ? English, French, Spanish and African. ?I will definitely sing Fever, a song I?m identified with. Also some jazz standards, songs in Punjabi and even one in Bengali,? Usha says. Aha tumi shundori koto or Bankurar mati is likely to be the Bengali song of her choice.

 It?s also the image of someone in a sari and bindi singing on a world stage that appeals to Usha. ?It would be nice to be clad in a sari, singing a song in Zulu or Swahili at a World Economic Forum meeting.?

 Usha and her band ? Emile Isaacs on bass, Benu Chatterjee on lead guitar, Amal Roy on drums, Tapan Roychowdhury on handsonic and Raja Deb on keyboards ? have recently returned from London Mela and a festival of world cultures in Ireland.

 Before the Davos trip, performances are lined up in Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore. ?Then we go to Birati and from there, straight to Switzerland,? Usha laughs.

 The annual meet of the forum ? January 25 to 29 ? would tackle topics such as emergence of China and India as economic powerhouses, the changing economic landscape, regional identities and struggle and innovation, creativity and design strategy.

 With a unique, vibrant character of its own, the ancient city of Varanasi, formerly known as Kashi, stands silent witness to the ageless, faceless tableaux of civilizations over the centuries. Written by Kashinath Singh, Kashinama takes the audience on a journey of the city over the last few decades, exposing the reality of the changes that took place in Varanasi behind the facade of socio-economic progress. In its poignant portrayal of change, and the way in which it affected the lives of the city?s inhabitants, Varanasi becomes a microcosm of the contemporary social scenario. In the play, the central figure symbolises the country on the one hand and, on the other, embodies the hypocrisy and dishonesty of religious ambassadors. It ends with the disturbing realisation that the spirit of ancient India, as epitomised in its wealth of tradition, culture and ethos, faces serious threat from the forces of modernisation and globalisation sweeping across the country. Design and direction: Usha Ganguli.

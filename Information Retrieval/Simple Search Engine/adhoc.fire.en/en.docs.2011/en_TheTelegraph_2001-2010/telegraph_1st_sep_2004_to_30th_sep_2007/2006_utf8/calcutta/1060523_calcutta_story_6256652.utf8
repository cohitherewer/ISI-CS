 This Puja, pick up the slickest plasma TV, the latest floorstander bass reflex speaker, that newest PlayStation model, the coolest double-door fridge or that iPod you?ve been eyeing. All under one roof, in the heart of downtown Calcutta.

 E-Mall, the ?first speciality electronic mall in India? ? inspired by the iconic Funan IT and Sim Lim Square in Singapore and Panthip Plaza in Bangkok ? is coming up in Magnet House on CR Avenue, next to the Chandni Chowk ?grey? market.

 ?We are proud to be able to turn a 60-year-old building into a speciality destination business mall. It will be a one-stop shop for every conceivable electronic product, Indian or imported,? Sanjay Kumar Bajoria, of developers The Hooghly Mills Co Ltd and CEO of E-Mall, tells Metro.

 The focused mart, spread across 80,000 sq ft in a G+3 format, will be zoned into six categories, according to the senses ? ?vision, hearing, speech, touch, smell and intuition?. The ground level will accommodate premium brands like Sony, Haier, Bose, Samsung, Kodak, Videocon, Nokia and HCL, while Pantaloon Retail has sought 30,000 sq ft for its e-Mart.

 The product mix will have TVs and home entertainment, office appliances, computer hardware, software and accessories, home appliances, mobile telephones, communication tools and accessories, industrial and medical instruments, watches and even household pumps and electrical goods. A quick-service caf? will be another boon for the office crowd dropping in.

 While J.P. Agrawal of Forum fame has designed E-Mall, Sembcorp of Singapore is the construction manager. Wipro and Johnson are responsible for the fire-fighting facilities, building-management systems and innovative lighting solutions. A 2,500-sq-ft area is dedicated to product launches.

 Special stress is being put on ?international-quality signage? by Selvel. ?We are importing an LED display wall from Berco of Belgium, while there will be lamps in the mall that can mutate into 4,000 different colours,? Bajoria declares. Trammell Crow Meghraj and NAI-NK Realtors are the marketing agents.

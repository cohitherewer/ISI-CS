 Doctor in love

 A hilarious play with subtle psychological overtones, Daant Paake Bandha (written by Amalesh Chakraborty) unfolds the story of Ananya, a young girl who falls in love with dentist Dr Gargari. However, the doctor says he is married, and so declines her romantic overtures politely. The two agree to remain good friends and continue to see each other. A year later, when Gargari fails to keep an appointment with Ananya, she decides to commit suicide in a fit of frustration. She sends a note to him informing him of her intention. When the doctor receives the news he becomes restless, which makes Nita, his assistant, very nervous, as she too is in love with Gargari. Meanwhile, Ananyas attempt to take her own life fails, as her neighbour Suchibrata, a poet, saves her in the nick of time. Finally, the dentist tells Ananya that he is prepared to divorce his wife and marry her instead, which leads the play to its surprising climax. Direction: Chandan Das.

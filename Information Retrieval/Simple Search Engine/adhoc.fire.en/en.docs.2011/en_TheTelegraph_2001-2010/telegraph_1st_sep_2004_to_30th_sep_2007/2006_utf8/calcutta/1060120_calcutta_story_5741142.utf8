 India?s first paediatric hospital is in the midst of its golden jubilee celebrations. 

 The Institute of Child Health, in Park Circus, began at a time when the word paediatrics was all but unknown in India and a special centre devoted to the treatment of children was quite inconceivable.

 Even today, in its 50th year, the institute is providing facilities way ahead of other similar institutions. 

 Take the MRI scan unit inaugurated on January 18. ?It is specially designed so as not to seem claustrophobic to children,? explained Apurba Ghosh, director of the institute.

 ?Found nowhere else in Calcutta? is the upcoming intensive care unit for children and the paediatric neurology section.

 In his address while inaugurating the institute on January 16, 1957, Jawaharlal Nehru had remarked: ?Nobody can doubt the extreme need for institutions of this kind.?

 Yet, when founder K.C. Chaudhuri had approached numerous educational and medical institutions all over India, only four cared to respond. Chaudhuri, inspired by child welfare organisations he had seen as a student in Vienna and Germany, stuck to his hospital dream.

 An anonymous donation of money and equipment worth Rs 150,000 finally got the institute started. Today, the 110-bed hospital, the outdoor facilities catering daily to 250-300 patients and the postgraduate college affiliated to Calcutta University, all run on charity and voluntary work of doctors.

 ?The state gives a token amount but we have been able to generate enough funds to keep the hospital charges low. Doctors charge no fees and no one is out to make a profit, so the bill is modest,? said Ghosh. ?But this does not affect the services in any way. In fact, we try to keep it on a par with corporate hospitals that have more funds at their disposal.? 

 The Institute of Child Health was the first to include a separate centre for the handicapped. Now, there are separate departments for immunisation, microbiology, ENT, speech therapy, haemato-oncology, ophthalmology and others. The institute has its own seminar hall and library.

 On Thursday, the ground floor waiting room is crowded. Weary and worried faces, a low rumble of voices as ears crane to catch the announcements. A child plays with his shadow in the sunlight streaming in through the large windows. 

 ?People have changed. They are more aware. Not just about medicine, but of their own rights. I respect their demand for transparency,? said Ghosh.

 Three more officers will join the visa section of the US 

 consulate in Calcutta by next year and another three by 

 2011, consul-general Henry V. Jardine announced on Thursday. 

 There has been enormous growth in the movement of people 

 between the two countries. Hence the decision to increase 

 the number of officers. He cited a recommendation of the 

 Indo-US CEO forum that the waiting period for visa interviews 

 be shortened. 

 quot;Any person planning to visit the US can apply to 

 the visa facilitation service by logging on to the website. 

 He can have an interview at the consulate two days later, 

 said consular officer Rebecca Dodds. 

 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation will abide by the high court order on the removal of hawkers from the pavements of eight roads, mostly in Burrabazar, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Thursday. Most hawkers have already left and those who havent will be evicted soon, he added. 

 A Howrah-bound truck overturned near Santragachhi Garpar Bridge, in Howrah, on Thursday morning, causing snarls on Kona Expressway. Vehicles had to be diverted to other roads, said a traffic department officer.

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied bail to Dinesh Dalmiya, the prime accused in the Rs 120-crore Calcutta Stock Exchange scam. Calcutta Police had moved the apex court after the high court granted him bail. Dalmiya is now lodged in a Chennai jail in another case.

 The body of a man in his 40s was found in the new complex of Howrah station on Thursday morning. Police said the body bore no injury marks. It has been sent for post-mortem. 

 Two men and three women were caught stealing jewellery from a temple in Narkeldanga early on Thursday. Police said the priest, Ajit Chakraborty, arrived around 3.30 am to make arrangements for the morning prayer when he saw the two gates of the temple open and a man removing the jewellery of the deity. The others were standing guard outside. The priest alerted local residents, who rushed to the spot.

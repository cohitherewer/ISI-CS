 Chocolates amp; chillies

 Shaun Kenworthy

 A purist will say that nothing 

 but chocolate with the highest possible cocoa content will 

 do. And as for fillings, only the finest European praline 

 and truffle-filled centres are worthwhile (yawn yawn yawn). 

 What a load of old cobblers! Im one of them people 

 who agree with the late Roald Dahl that the British chocolate 

 bar is by far the best in the world and gives you much more 

 variety than you can ever even dream about. I grew up and 

 so did my children on Mars bars, Snickers, Bounty bars, 

 Toblerone, Cadburys and all sorts of chocolate bars 

 with dirty fillings.

 Even now, the Snickers bar filled 

 with roasted peanuts, caramel and that silky undefinable 

 whipped layer swings it for me. It was a great day when 

 all the new Indian supermarkets started stocking them on 

 their shelves. Im not saying in any way that the more 

 superior continental chocolates are anywhere near bad, but 

 a lot of the time they tend to be a little too sophisticated 

 for most tastes (like anything else in my life, given the 

 choice between clean or dirty, Id more than likely 

 go for the latter). 

 When it comes to cooking with 

 chocolate, only the best will do and the darker and richer, 

 the better. You dont come across much good dark chocolate 

 in India and when you do it will be atrociously expensive. 

 Unless you know the general manager of a hotel. I suggest 

 you use Bournville as a safe easy option that will satisfy 

 most of your puddings, desserts and mousse and also try 

 to use a good quality cocoa powder wherever necessary.

 There are some flavourings that 

 without a doubt marry well with chocolate and youll 

 find them time and time again in recipes. Things like coffee, 

 orange, mint, vanilla, cinnamon the Aztecs always used 

 cinnamon in their Chocolatl with the addition 

 of chilli, hence the title of the column; and most Mexican 

 chocolate will be already flavoured with cinnamon all 

 varieties of nuts and dried fruits, coconut, ginger, raspberries 

 and many other things that Ive more than likely used 

 but probably forgotten. 

 Some spirits and liquors lend 

 themselves very well to chocolate and can add that extra 

 dimension that many Europeans just cant get enough 

 of. Try to stick to things such as whiskey, rum, brandy 

 and rich liquors such as coffee; nut and other rich fruit-based 

 liquors. 

 When following recipes, one problem 

 is the size of an egg. Its not the same always. In 

 most British cookbooks an egg equates to around two fluid 

 ounces or around 60 millilitres. Most of the eggs in India 

 are much smaller than that and you should plan recipes accordingly. 

 Try to use unsalted butter whenever you can use. 

 When it comes to sugars, use castor 

 sugar or for recipes with dark chocolate, use brown or Demerara 

 sugar for an even richer result. Last, the kind of cream 

 you use is most important, as Indian cream usually has no 

 oomph and very rarely whips. Try to use cream from the cow 

 rather than the buffalo with at least 40 per cent fat content.

 To conclude these last three weeks, 

 most European and American soldiers carry bars of chocolate 

 as part of their rationing for nourishment and to lift spirits. 

 Even astronauts take chocolate into space, so it cant 

 all be bad. What I can tell you is, never use chocolate 

 that goes by the name of cooking chocolate, its made 

 with vegetable fats and not cocoa butter and will leave 

 an awful taste in your mouth. 

 The best way to eat chocolate 

 is however you like it and interestingly enough, chocolate 

 has a melting point of around 36O C, the same as body temperature. 

 I wont elaborate anymore on that but it does mean 

 you can patch up that relationship and enjoy chocolate all 

 at the same time if you know what I mean!

 Below is the most requested recipe 

 I have. The humble chocolate brownie.

 Chocolate brownies

 Butter an eight-inch cake tin, 

 a square one preferably. Line the bottom with a circle of 

 greaseproof paper, butter the paper and the sides, and set 

 aside. Pre-heat an oven to 170O C.

 Next, slowly melt 200g of dark 

 chocolate and set aside for a couple of minutes. In a mixing 

 bowl, cream together 150g of butter and 250g of sugar until 

 light and creamy, slowly add three eggs, one at a time and 

 pour in the chocolate and 100g of chopped walnuts.

 Again slowly mix together thoroughly. 

 Sift in 150g of flour, 50g of cocoa and one tsp of baking 

 powder, folding gradually as you go. Put into a tray, lined 

 with greaseproof paper and bake for 20 minutes. When fully 

 cooked, it shouldnt be completely set, it should be 

 a little gooey. It will set a little more as it cools.

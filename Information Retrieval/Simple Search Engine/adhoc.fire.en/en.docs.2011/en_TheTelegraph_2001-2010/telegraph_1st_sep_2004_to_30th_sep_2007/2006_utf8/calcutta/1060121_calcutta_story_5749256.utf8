The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Outsider at the crossroads

 Sarah Jones, who had taken Calcutta by storm twice, is taking her multi-ethnic message to Broadway. Is she ready for uptown and is uptown ready for her?

 Sarah Jones has performed in all manner of unlikely spots, from tiny East Village clubs in New York to a gigantic outdoor stage in India to the United Nations, where she appeared before a group of delegates and conference goers ? a tough crowd if there ever was one.

 But no place has been more unexpected, she said, than Helen Hayes theatre on Broadway, where Bridge amp; Tunnel, her one-woman exploration of the immigrant life in modern-day America, was to begin previews. ?I don?t even say ?Be careful what you wish for?, because I never even could have imagined this,? said a giddy Jones.

 The 32-year-old Obie Award-winning playwright, actor and poet had received standing ovations twice in Calcutta, when she staged Women Can?t Wait! in 2001 and then Waking the American Dream in 2003.

 ?Think of discrimination against women as discrimination against half the population,? Jones had said to a packed auditorium in Loreto House during her first trip to the city. She was back two years later, captivating the audience at GD Birla Sabhagar with questions of nationalism and borders. 

 The Broadway debut of Bridge amp; Tunnel on January 26 comes nearly two years after its premiere at an off-Broadway theatre. With the backing of Hollywood star Meryl Streep, a fan who lent her name as a producer, and a bunch of excellent reviews, Bridge amp; Tunnel was considered for an immediate Broadway transfer. That didn?t happen, because of the lack of an appropriately sized theatre, but the show ran for seven months, recouping its $200,000 production cost in two.

 Bridge amp; Tunnel follows the story of more than a dozen characters from various cultures, ranging from a kindly Pakistani accountant to a Brooklyn rapper, all vying for a slice of fame in a Queens cafe. Over the course of the show, the characters, all played by Jones in various accents and attitudes, touch on a wide spectrum of immigrant existence, from uncomfortable assimilation to the indignities of low-wage labour. 

 The New York Times praised Jones and ?the uncanny accuracy with which she portrays the host of immigrants and outsiders who make up this hybrid nation?. Since then, Jones, whose earlier shows, Surface Transit (1998) and Women Can?t Wait (2000), also won critical praise, has made some changes to the script, allowing most of her characters to age in real time, while another character has aged backward, becoming a child. ?The characters? lives have changed over the last couple of years,? said the actress who also appeared in the Spike Lee film Bamboozled.

 ?I?m really ready for uptown and, more importantly, I think uptown is ready for me,? said Jones. ?These are people that I really want to reach. And sometimes you have to come to the crossroads to reach them.?

 The producers of Bridge amp; Tunnel will soon find out exactly how large an uptown audience there is for Jones?s downtown mix of spoken word and stand-up comedy. ?The Broadway audience is always searching for the hot show, the different show, something they could only see in New York and tell folks back home about,? producer Streep wrote in an e-mail message. ?Sarah?s is the most authentic New York offering currently on Broadway.?

 That said, the success rate for one-person shows on Broadway has been mixed. Last season had a bundle of solo shows, including one blockbuster (Billy Crystal?s 700 Sundays), one that struggled to break even (Dame Edna: Back with a Vengeance), and a trio of money-losers (Whoopi Goldberg?s Whoopi, Mario Cantone?s Laugh Whore and Eve Ensler?s Good Body). Not that that seems to phase Jones, whose life seems little changed by her show?s change of address.

 Born in Baltimore, Jones moved to Queens at the age of 10, and now lives in downtown Manhattan, in a West Village apartment with her husband, Steve Colman, who is also a poet and is credited with helping to conceive Bridge amp; Tunnel. 

 ?The bill for the rent seems to arrive the same as it used to,? she said. ?And in some ways, I really like it that way.?

 Doctor case plea rejected

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 US-based doctor Kunal Saha?s petition challenging the acquittal of three city doctors, in a case relating to the alleged wrong treatment of his wife, leading to her death, was rejected by Calcutta High Court on Thursday.

 The division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Debasish Kargupta upheld the verdict of the president of the West Bengal Medical Council, acquitting the doctors of charges of negligence and rash treatment, after ?going through the merits of the case in detail?.

 Saha?s wife Anuradha died of an ailment at Mumbai?s Breach Candy Hospital in May 1999. Before being shifted to Mumbai, she was treated in Calcutta by Abani Roy Chowdhury, Baidyanath Haldar and Sukumar Mukherjee, against whom Saha had moved the medical council.

 In his petition before the high court, Saha had accused council president Ashok Chowdhury of being ?biased? while disposing of the case, and of shielding the accused instead of trying them.

 Countering the allegations, council lawyer Saibalendu Bhowmik argued that his client had taken the decision after hearing all parties concerned. 

 ?Saha had failed to prove that his wife had died because of negligence and rash treatment of the accused doctors. On the other hand, the accused had substantiated that their treatment of Anuradha was correct,? Bhowmik stated.

 Reacting to the ruling, Saha said in a faxed message that advocate-general Balai Ray had pleaded on behalf of Sukumar Mukherjee, one of the accused. ?As advocate-general of the state, he cannot defend an accused.? 

 Saha said he would move the Supreme Court against Ray?s conduct.

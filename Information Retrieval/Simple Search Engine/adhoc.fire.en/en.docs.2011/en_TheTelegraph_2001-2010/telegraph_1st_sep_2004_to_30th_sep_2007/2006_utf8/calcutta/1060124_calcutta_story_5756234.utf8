 Timeout

 Less a form of visual expression than a form of utterance, the paintings of Jayashree Chakravarty have a natural eloquence, rhythm and cadence that is characteristic of poetry. With a fluidity and flexibility suggesting the transient nature of human consciousness, her works offer slices of life as captured in fleeting moments of realisation. In The Very Face of The Time, the ongoing exhibition of 18 of her most recent works, is reminiscent of the pattern of a mosaic. The evocation of the ineffable is embedded in her densely-wrought yet strangely figurative surfaces, while her richly-symbolic imagery floats, independent of the motifs, gestures, textures and colours of which it is composed. Laden with more than a single layer of meaning, her symbols are also in a state of flux; evolving, disintegrating and again recreating as the artist works upon her medium. Sometimes, apparently random shapes, calligraphic marks or abstract entities merge with fish, flowers, faces and even words and phrases.

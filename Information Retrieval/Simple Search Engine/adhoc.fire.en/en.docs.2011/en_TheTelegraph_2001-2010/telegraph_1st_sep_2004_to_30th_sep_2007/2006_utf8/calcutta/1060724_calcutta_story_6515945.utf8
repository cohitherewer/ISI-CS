The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Academy to groom nurses for the US

 - High 

 wages, permanent positions prompt professionals to fly 

 SUBHRO SAHA

 After 18 years in general nursing and midwifery in Calcutta, Ruby Paul is now well-ensconced in the Medical College of Virginia, drawing a wage in excess of Rs 2 lakh a month, a beacon of hope for hundreds of aspirants back home in Bengal.

 The beam has just got brighter, with five more nurses from Calcutta gearing up to catch the flight to the US by this year-end and an academy in the offing. GlobeMed Resources, the ?largest nurse recruitment and placement company? operating in India, which together with the Happy Group of Companies, has been grooming nurses in the east for the US healthcare industry for the past two years, is setting up a special school for the purpose.

 The ?first-of-its-kind? GlobeMed nursing academy will train nurses in the ?social, cultural and economic pattern of the West?, along with the professional skills they need to acquire to settle abroad. The academy is being launched in Chennai, with the same model to be replicated in Calcutta soon.

 ?Nurses from West Bengal are highly efficient and are becoming increasingly aware of the opportunities in the US,? Pratimaa Ghosh, senior medical staffing manager, GlobeMed Resources, tells Metro. With nursing staff shortfall in the US pegged at 1.36 million, the opportunities could hardly be over-emphasised.

 In Calcutta, GlobeMed has been training aspirants at its Gariahat facility to clear the three tests necessary to take up permanent nursing positions in US hospitals ? the CGFNS (Commission on Graduate of Foreign Nursing School), IELTS (International English Language Testing Services) and NCLEX (the US licensing exam).

 ?The US offers tremendous opportunities for talented and experienced nurses and India is a storehouse of talent in services. Our tie-up with GlobeMed is aimed at bridging the gap and providing mutual benefits to both the countries,? says Sushil Poddar, chairman, Happy Group of Companies.

 Once a medical facility in the US is presented to the student, GlobeMed provides information about location, cost of living, safety, cultural environment, career opportunities, pay philosophy? Clearing the first two hurdles qualifies nurses for US immigration procedure, and the agency, which has tie-ups ?with over 100 US hospitals?, helps process state licensure for the candidate.

 ?While patient-handling and communication skills are important, it?s also extremely critical to give them a cultural orientation before they leave,? stresses Ghosh. For this, nurse managers, including Chris Brindenbaugh, vice-president, nursing, fly down from GlobeMed?s global headquarters in Richmond, Virginia.

 The GlobeMed academy has a ?novel structured curriculum? which includes mock ?Role Play? to simulate medical situations for students to react to. It also has a computer room, a library and a hostel. Nurses are trained in technology ? use of machines and equipment ? and groomed in English language, US etiquette and culture.

 With a batch of 15 trainees in the city right now, by end-2007, GlobeMed hopes to send at least 25 nurses from Calcutta to permanent US hospital positions, and more than 200 from India. At an average of $25 per hour for 12-hour shifts and $53 for every overtime hour put in, the wages are clearly a huge impetus to fly, even as city hospitals languish for want of trained nursing staff.

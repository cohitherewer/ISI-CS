The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 High roads for car flow

 - Flyovers 

 in the north

 A STAFF REPORTER

The state public works department (PWD) has come up with a twin flyover project at the Nagerbazar and VIP-Jessore Road intersections, to clear the crossroads. 

 The two flyovers will come up at the Nagerbazar intersection, where Dum Dum Road meets Jessore Road, and near the airport, where Jessore Roads meets VIP Road.

 The construction of the Nagerbazar crossing flyover will be handed over to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, whereas the other flyover near the airport will be constructed by the PWD. 

 The estimated cost of the twin one-km flyovers is pegged at Rs 30 crore each. Officials claimed that the flyovers would ease the traffic congestion in the area.

 The idea is to decongest the roads. It takes around 15-20 minutes to cross the area during peak hour. Therefore, the only solution is re-engineering of traffic movement. People in the north will benefit most from them. It will also bring down the number of accidents in this area, asserted P.K. Agarwal, PWD secretary. 

 After getting a nod from the state finance department, the PWD is drawing a detailed project report of the flyovers. Officials said the report will be ready in three weeks and the work will start soon after. 

 I do not think there will be any problem in implementing the proposed project as no land acquisition is required. We just need to conduct a thorough study and prepare a project report. We aim to start the construction work at the earliest, said P.K. Deb, PWD chief engineer.

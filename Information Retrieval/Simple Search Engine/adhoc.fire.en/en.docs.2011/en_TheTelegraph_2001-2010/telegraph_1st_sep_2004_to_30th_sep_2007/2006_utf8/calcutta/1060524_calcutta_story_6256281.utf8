 Ranadip Das, 

 Panihati

 Reputed colleges with good academic record and adequate facilities should be granted a degree of freedom, but not full autonomy. They should be allowed to function as they please and experiment with courses and teaching methods. But the government should retain the right to clip their wings if they start misusing their power.

 A. Bose Chowdhury, 

 Barrackpore

 If colleges with adequate facilities are granted autonomy then the unnecessary burden on the university will definitely reduce. The step will help the universities to start courses in cutting-edge disciplines and concentrate on research, which they haven?t been able to do for want of funds. But the autonomy status should be reviewed annually to prevent malpractice and complacency.

S. Chakraborty, 

 Unique Park

 No. The reason being no matter how good the infrastructure of the colleges, most of them cannot be trusted to run the show without any assistance. They might bite off more than they can chew. Liberty should not turn into licence.

 Indranil Sanyal, 

 Dhakuria

 There are several defects in the current higher education system, such as late publication of results. Some colleges have the potential to do a better job if they are granted autonomy. The resultant competition among the institutions would also push up the academic standard.

 Sourish Misra, 

 Salt Lake

 Autonomy grant to colleges will boost the education system. But the institutions worthy of the responsibility should be selected through stringent checks.

 H.K. Dutta,

 Shibpur

 All colleges, whether they want to become autonomous or not, should have adequate facilities. Those institutions fulfiling the other requirements for autonomy need not be granted the status immediately. Academic record and the degree of interference of the students? unions need to be taken into consideration. We need to remember that once autonomy is granted to a college, it would be difficult to control it even if it indulges in malpractice.

Joyeeta Dey,

 Teghoria 

 All colleges with adequate facilities should be granted autonomy. The status would make the authorities more responsible and increase competition among institutions of the same stature.

D. Chakraborty, 

 Cossipore

 If colleges with adequate facilities are granted autonomous stature, they will be able to function more efficiently. Freed from the constraints imposed by the university, the autonomous institutions will appoint better teachers, leading to improvement in academic standard. The students will thus benefit enormously.

 Sandhya Banerjee,

 Salt Lake

 The colleges that secure the centre of excellence tag from the UGC can be granted autonomy. To be eligible for such a responsibility the institutions should appoint quality teaching staff and upgrade their academic standard till it is on a par with the best institutions abroad.

 Naren Sen,

 Santragachhi

 Autonomy should be granted to colleges with good credentials, adequate infrastructure and a proven track record. If a number of colleges are granted autonomy and they hike the tuition fees, then ordinary students will end up as losers. 

P. Pramanik,

 Santoshpur

 Eminent educationists no longer figure in the governing bodies of schools and colleges. The committee members are now elected on the basis of their political affiliations, even if their academic credentials are suspect. If autonomy is granted indiscriminately to colleges in this kind of an environment, the entire education system will suffer. 

Sukumar Ghosh,

 Mukundapur 

 Autonomy should be granted to all colleges that are capable of producing good students on their own. This might help the students to shake off the shackles of the university.

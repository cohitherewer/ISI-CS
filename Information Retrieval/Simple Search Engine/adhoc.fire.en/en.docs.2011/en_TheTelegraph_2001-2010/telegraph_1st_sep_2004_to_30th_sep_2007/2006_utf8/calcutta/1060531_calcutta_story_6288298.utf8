 Delving deep within the recesses of a man?s psyche, Nandikar?s production Maramiya Mon tries to uncover certain hidden facets of basic human character that guide his spirit and make up his innermost being. An adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky?s The Gentle Spirit, the play represents, perhaps, the maiden appearance of this celebrated Russian dramatist on the Bengali stage. With a plot that explores afresh the eternal tensions, conflicts and dichotomies of man-woman relationships, it presents the transformation of the soul of its protagonist through a series of monologues, sometimes cryptic and at others, almost confessional. It begins on a note of eerie apprehension, with a man talking aloud to himself, or maybe conversing with his dead wife, who has just committed suicide. As he mumbles and stumbles across the stage musing upon his relationship with her, he begins his search for his self and his conscience, also revealing aspects of his wife?s proud and overbearing character. Finally, after bursts of anger and depression, sarcasm and bitterness, he discovers his essential loneliness without her. Direction and acting: Goutam Halder.

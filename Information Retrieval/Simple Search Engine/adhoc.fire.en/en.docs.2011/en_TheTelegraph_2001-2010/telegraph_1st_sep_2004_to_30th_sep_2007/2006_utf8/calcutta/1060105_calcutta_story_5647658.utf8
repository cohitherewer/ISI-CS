 A page from the Kingfisher Swimsuit Special Australia 2006 calendar 

 Six strikingly gorgeous fresh faces and hotbods, 22 new designers from the country over, one hotshot lensman and some breathtaking locales of Australia? The fourth edition of the Kingfisher Swimsuit Special Australia 2006 calendar promises 12 months of fun, glamour and eye candy.

 To be launched at Taj Lands End in Bandra, Mumbai, on January 8, the calendar as always is a showcase for Indian fashion. It features 22 upcoming designers from 12 design schools around India, with an exclusive cover done by Wendell Rodricks.

 Splashed across the pages are models Karishma Kotak, Mashoom Singha, Neelam Chauhan, Deepika Padukone, Shilpa Reddy and Shruti Agarwal, all six featuring in the much-talked-about Kingfisher calendar for the first time.

 Shot extensively throughout Australia, it captures the great scenic treasures of the tropical city of Cairns, the magnificent Great Barrier Reef, Sydney and Kangaroo Island. The award-winning (winner of the International Food amp; Beverage Creative Excellence Awards in 2004 and 2005) limited-edition calendar has been shot by ace photographer Atul Kasbekar. 

 The Kingfisher calendar is a true showcase of Indian fashion. It has given a phenomenal opportunity to young designers across the country to showcase their works on such a celebrated platform. True to Vijay Mallyas vision, this time the calendar further explores the space of fashion, Atul tells GoodLife.

 The energy and enthusiasm that has gone into the making of the calendar makes it really special, adds Atul. I have infused a lot of energy into the visuals with movement and wider shots.

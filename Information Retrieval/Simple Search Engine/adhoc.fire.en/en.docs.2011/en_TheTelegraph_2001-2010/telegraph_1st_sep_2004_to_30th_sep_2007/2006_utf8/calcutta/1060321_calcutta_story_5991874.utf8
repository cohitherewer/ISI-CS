The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 C above A amp; 

 B in manager jobs 

 - Comparative index pegs Joka campus foremost in offers and salaries

 BISWARUP GOOPTU

 Being good is not good enough, and nowhere more so than on the big B-school campuses at this time of the year. With six-figure salaries raining down on the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) addresses ? from A to B to C ? it?s all about being the best in the recruitment ring.

 And Calcutta, after staying mum while Ahmedabad and Bangalore slugged it out over salary highs, has decided to have the last laugh. In a carefully-crafted comparative index prepared on the Joka campus, IIM-C has been pegged above IIM-A and IIM-B in average domestic salary, highest domestic salary, highest international lateral offer, maximum foreign offers, and more (see box).

 But why wait till Bangalore and Ahmedabad have hogged the cash-and-career headlines? ?This is something we do not prescribe to. All this (trumpeting of salaries) leads to increased pressure on the students. We prefer giving the median salary figures, instead. It has to be remembered that we are providing a service only,? said Ranjan Das, chairperson, placement committee, IIM Calcutta.

 This was echoed by the e-mails dashed off to director Prakash Apte by Gaurav Agarwal and Venkatesh Shankaraman, who had bagged the highest salary offer at IIM-Bangalore. They pleaded that their salary details must not be made public for the safety of their families. Agarwal has an offer for US $193,000 from Barclays Capital, London, and Shankaraman Rs 30 lakh from McKinsey, in Mumbai.

 ?We strongly feel such details are personal and should not be made public? This has caused a lot of personal problems for us,? they said, adding that the salary figures had been made public without their consent. This trend, warned the duo, could lead to a tussle of one-upmanship among various IIMs, affecting credibility in the long run.

 The final recruitment programme having got over on March 17, the entire batch of 249 students at Joka, the largest amongst the six IIMs, has been placed in three slots, with a total of 505 offers to choose from. 

 Of 114 companies that had confirmed their participation in the recruitment programme, the first 89 managed to snap up the entire class of 2006.

 ?Recruitments continue to be on an upswing. They have been excellent, especially considering that Slot Three (after Slot Zero, One and Two) was not required at all. It is evident that the IIMs have become global sourcing centres,? said placement committee chairperson Das.

 Some of the recruitment highs at Joka were:

 Slot Zero (64 accepts 

 out of 85 offers), saw the maximum number of recruits from 

 Calcutta

 Lateral recruitment (for 

 students with work experience) was 72 accepts out of 150-plus 

 offers

 Lateral international 

 offers were in excess of $100,000, ?a first for any campus?

 Mittal Steel made more 

 offers in Calcutta than in Ahmedabad and Bangalore combined.

 ?Lateral placements and summer internship programmes (SIP) have become leading indicators of how the final recruitments are going to be. The exceptional number of pre-placement offers (PPO) garnered by IIM Calcutta students during their SIP have played an intrinsic role in the success of our final recruitment programme,? observed Das.

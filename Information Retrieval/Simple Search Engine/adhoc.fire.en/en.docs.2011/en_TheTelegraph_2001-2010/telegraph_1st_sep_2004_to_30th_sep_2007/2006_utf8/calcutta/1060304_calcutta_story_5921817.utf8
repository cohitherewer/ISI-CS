The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Green mess buck passes

 - Maidan left swamped under Bush effigies, rally leftovers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The scars inflicted by the Book Fair had hardly healed when the Maidan was mauled and marred by a mini rally, organised by the ruling Left Front, on Thursday afternoon.

 The 4,000-strong rally to protest the visit of American President George W. Bush to India left the stretch of the Maidan opposite the American Center singed and soiled.

 The Maidan was a mess 24 hours later, on Friday afternoon, with the remains of the rally strewn across.

 Burnt and half-burnt effigies of the American President, blackened piles of grass and leaves, plastic carry bags, paper packets bearing oil stains of the samosas and telebhajas that were hot property on Thursday, plastic teacups and newspapers ? the greens were a garbage dump.

 And unlike the day after the Book Fair, there was no one around to clean the mess.

 And no one seemed to know who would clean the mess and when. A spokesman for the army, custodians of the Maidan, said cleaning up was the responsibility of organisers of the function/rally.

 ?The organisers will be asked to do the clean-up. If they don?t, we?ll approach the public works department (PWD),? said the spokesman.

 The organiser ? in this case, the ruling coalition that had mobilised a modest crowd to shout slogans against the American President ? chose not to comment on whose Maidan mess it was anyway.

 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Anuj Sharma said he had sought a report from the deputy commissioner of police (south) and would only comment on the Maidan matter after that.

 Senior officers, meanwhile, said it was not the job of the police to clear up the mess left behind by political parties. ?Our job is to maintain the law and order, not to clean up the Maidan,? grumbled an officer.

 Passing the buck was also the game of the day at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Civic officials made it clear that clean-up of the Maidan did not fall under their jurisdiction.

 ?It is the job of the PWD,? an official said. ?Only if the PWD asks us to do the needful and pays us for it, will we do the job,? he added.

 The PWD officials, in turn, said they have not been approached by the army to clean up the Maidan in the aftermath of Thursday?s rally.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Blame game over repair

 - Patchwork 

 speedy but short-lived

 KINSUK BASU

 Who is to be blamed for your bone-jarring ride down the Park Circus Connector? Given the blame game being played off the streets, pinning blame seems tougher than avoiding the craters on the remains of the street.

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) points a crooked finger at the police forcing it to undertake another round of patchwork fourth in the past three months on the Park Circus Connector, instead of the overhaul it so badly needs.

 Police, in turn, justify the need for a quick fix, given the traffic load on the 2.6-km stretch, linking the Park Circus seven-point crossing with EM Bypass, and blame the mess on the failure of CMDA to carry out repairs that last.

 Every time the road surface comes undone, CMDA engineers cover the potholes with a layer of asphalt that does not survive even one smart shower. The CMDA is not engaging any contractor for the job, but ferrying bitumen from its hot-mix plant in Salt Lake.

 Ideally, there should be a layer of catalytic bitumen on the crushed bricks covering the potholes, then a two-inch-deep layer of bituminous macadam and finally, a topping of bituminous concrete. But the authorities are not ready to give us the time required for such work, explained Debdas Bhattacharya, chief engineer, traffic and transportation, CMDA.

 A coat of bitumen, Bhattacharya added, needs at least 12-14 hours to settle. But we will not be allowed to close the stretch that long. So how can you expect the repairs to last?

 Engineers also blame the frequent cave-ins on the weak soil beneath, thanks to the absence of a proper sewerage and the waste disposed by tanneries for years.

 The Park Circus Connector is not the only thoroughfare under the scanner. Joint commissioner (traffic) Ranveer Kumar and deputy commissioner (traffic) Jawed Shamim toured several suspect stretches on Wednesday.

 Several agencies have been urged to speed up repair work. Among the worst-hit roads are Nirmal Chunder Street (where the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners have been asked to complete tram track concretisation by Sunday), Circular Garden Reach Road, Bidhan Sarani, Topsia South Road, the southern slope of Barrackpore Bridge, RG Kar Road and the stretch between the Hudco crossing and Ultadanga underpass.

 Tall tale of teen trouble

 Kaavya Viswanathan?s staggering $500,000 advance from Time Warner for How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life placed an enormous weight of expectation on the 18-year-old Harvard freshman, born in India and raised in Scotland. The deal was a risk by Time Warner, with not only the danger of losing money on the book, but also producing a literary equivalent of Macauley Culkin. Their faith, however, seems to be well placed.

 The story is based on Indian-American girl Opal Mehta and her ambitious parents, who are obsessed with her gaining admission to Harvard. But in her interview, she is caught on the back foot when she is asked what she does ?for fun?. 

 Fun has not featured in Opal?s curriculum, or indeed in her life. To get into Harvard, it seems she will have to become a more rounded person. Her parents enthusiastically embrace turning their daughter from a studious NRI girl into an American teenager. 

 Coming-of-age high school stories are two a penny these days, and you may be forgiven for groaning at the prospect of yet another teen opus, but Kaavya?s take is unique within it?s sphere. Her writing style is frighteningly mature and deft considering her years, and in terms of plot she approaches the well-trodden Pygmalion path with humour and elegance. 

 The main source of amusement in the book is how an Indian family so enthusiastically embraces American teenage rebellion so that their daughter may seem ?normal? in the eyes of the Harvard dean. Opal?s parents turn teenage rebellion into a rigorous academic exercise. 

 Indian family life and American teenage life are at the best of times incongruous bed fellows, and Kaavya hilariously addresses every facet of the match. Towards the end of the book, Opal undergoes a realisation that she does not have to be a fanatical follower of fashion in order to be ?normal?.

 At times the interplay between the characters is a little predictable, a sense that you have seen these situations before crops up from time to time. But this is balanced by a genuinely comic touch. For instance, Opal compares the rigid social strata of the high school cafeteria with that of the Hindu caste system. 

 The end, however, peters out a little, and the book loses some of its initial sparkle. But Opal Mehta..., to be released in March in India by Penguin, is a charming book, which does not as one might expect, entirely trade upon cultural confusion, and is a promising start from this precocious talent. If this is what Kaavya is producing at 18, it can only bode well for this nascent literary talent.

 Justice for Jessica

 The Jessica Lal case has been making front page news of late. What is worrying is, what kind of a law system do we have? Isn?t this a green signal to people with power and money that they can get away with whatever they do, even the heinous crime of murder of an innocent? 

 The witnesses who turned hostile comprise the elite of our society; they are the sort of people some of us look up to. If this kind of a system continues, there is a serious threat to the security of the common masses of our country. 

 Can?t we take the initiative and do something? It is the responsibility of the common citizen, especially the youth of the country, to come forward and at least take a stand against the corruption that has crept in at all levels of our lives. 

 It?s time to do something about this, we can?t let it go on. Pleas should be made to the President to reopen the case. The hundred-odd witnesses who were present should be forced to speak up. 

 The police should consequently take up full responsibility for their security. Only then can Jessica and her family get justice, something that has become so rare in our country.

 Convict the criminals

 Justice delayed is justice denied. But what does one do when justice is denied completely with little hope of bringing the culprits to book? 

 A whip of injustice is being meted out to the family of Jessica Lal in a shocking verdict where all the accused were acquitted. 

 Lack of convincing evidence against the accused, fudged ballistic reports and hostile eyewitnesses made a blatant mockery of our flawed criminal jurisprudence. 

 However, the initiatives taken by the media and the overwhelming public support for the slain woman?s family is encouraging. The essence of justice means that nobody is above the law. 

 If Manu Sharma is not the culprit, then who is? In such a system, anybody with power and money will go scot-free. Even if a retrial is conducted, what is the guarantee that the police won?t be influenced?

 Flu fear

 Bird flu has once again raised its ugly head, leading to the culling of lakhs of chickens. The laboratories are yet to announce the sure arrival of this disease. But even before confirmation, fear is not only leading to the killing of many innocent birds, but it is also destroying the livelihoods of poor people totally dependent on chickens and eggs.

 Science special 

 The Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) celebrated National Science Week in style, from February 22-28. Said director Jayanta Sthanapati of the expansion of the event from a day to a week: ?Spacing it out over a week has proven to be a success. In the past, many children could not attend the event on a particular day. When it takes place over a week, most people can make it.?

 BITM?s instincts have proven to be correct ? 6,727 students from 46 schools in Calcutta attended the various events. ?There was much more participation due to the flexible arrangements, and we plan to continue with it in future,? said Sthanapati. Ten shows took place per day, all of them sold out.

 Shows for people of all levels of scientific understanding were staged, including the new 3D show on Mars Exploration. ?We have the best 3D show in the country, which features real photographs taken by NASA from the surface of Mars. It is the first public display of this footage in this country,? he added.

 Two lectures were also held, one on the Bird Flu scare, by Dr Gautam Mukherjee, an expert on the subject. The talk lasted for 45 minutes, with an additional 30-minute question-and-answer session at the end. Another talk was given by Dr D.C. Paul of the Botanical Survey of India on bio-diversity, which was also the theme of this year?s event.

 Along with the main event at BITM, several other events took place simultaneously at BITM?s satellite museums, like Digha Science Centre and District Science Centre in Purulia.

 Save-water civic scurry 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Over 10 million gallons of filtered water, equal to the daily supply to Salt Lake, flows down the drain every day through the 20,000-odd roadside taps of Calcutta. 

 More than 95 per cent of these taps, called stand pipes, are never turned off.

 The CPM-led civic board, after repeated prods from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has decided to launch a save-water campaign by fitting proper taps on these stand pipes.

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya will convene a meeting with his councillors to make them aware of the colossal waste of filtered water taking place in their areas.

 ?I think a councillor is morally bound to motivate all stand pipe-users in his area to look after them. I am convinced that the right initiative by the councillors can prevent this daily loss,? said the mayor. 

 Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said Rs 5 lakh had been allotted for buying taps. ?But how many times a year can we replace the broken taps?? he asked.

 Water supply department engineers warned that if such waste of filtered water continued, the civic body would have to seal the stand pipes.

 ?Stand pipes are nothing but official leaks in the city?s water supply network. Hence, broken taps mean, apart from waste, a fall in pressure in the household supply,? pointed out Congress leader and councillor Pradip Ghosh.

 Besides, an engineer pointed out, an election means 500 new stand pipes. A stand pipe has become an important gift to woo the electorate.

 What: 

 A new childrens collection for girls at FabIndia.

 Where: Both the outlets at 16, Hindustan Park and City Centre (shop no: D104).

 Take a look: The collection includes pretty frocks all the way from Vietnam, with an array of Chinese and French embroidery patterns. The collection aimed at newborns to six-year-olds comes in pure cotton. 

 The colour palette is ruled by summer shades of white, baby pink, pale blue and yellow. Full sleeves to half-sleeves to sleeveless, there is quite a variety to choose from. The sleeveless ones with small round collars look smart. Cutwork ones with lace and tiny flower and leaf embroideries look cute. 

 But the showstealer here is the smocking further accentuated with tiny rose embellishments on the pretty little dress.

 Pocket pinch: The price tag reads anything between Rs 499 and Rs 899.

 Voiceover: It is an effort to make people aware of rich Asian craft. Moreover, with summer already making its presence felt, there can be nothing more apt than these fine quality cotton frocks that are not only comfortable but look good as well, smiled Pallabi Basu, manager, FabIndia, Calcutta.

 Eye appeal

 What: Launch of a new Lawrence amp; Mayo outlet.

 Where: 42/2, Gariahat Road (beside Ramakrishna Mission, Gol Park).

 When: Sunday, March 19.

 Take a look: The 1,800 sq ft swank showroom is the fourth L amp;M outlet in the city and the 39th in India. From frames to lenses to shades, the store is home to an array of domestic and international brands. For frames one can choose from domestic brands like Optimed, Seiko and LM Think. International frame names include Cartier, Mont Blanc and Bvlgari. The lenses are from French brands like Airwear and Varilux. Contact lenses ? soft, semi-soft and disposable (daily, fortnightly, monthly and quarterly). The shades counter offers choices for the young and old.

 There are two clinics where a group of three optometrists look after primary eye care. A workstation offers free facilities of adjustment of frames and the like.

 Pocket pinch: Prices range between Rs 250 and Rs 60,000.

 Voiceover: With problems of vision increasing by the day, there is a growing need for more such stores in the market. We offer quality products and standout after-sales service, said Subrahmanya, marketing and systems manager.

 Magic mood

 What: Ladies Coffee Meet. 

 Where: Calcutta Swimming Club (CSC). 

 When: Monday, March 20.

 The speaker: Ipsita Roy Chakraverti, the Delhi-based practicing witch or wiccan who was born in Calcutta and went on to become a member of the Society of the Study of Ancient Cultures and Civilizations in Canada. She has also written two books, Beloved Witch (her autobiography) and Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown.

 The talk: The Banquet Hall at CSC converted itself into a dreamy den as Ipsita spoke to a packed house of eager ladies. The setting was perfect, the room dotted with pretty candles and exotic lamps, as Ipsita touched upon various aspects of her mystic craft.

 Voiceover: We wanted 

 to host a very interesting speaker for this coffee meet 

 and so we contacted Wiccan Ipsita Roy Chakraverti. We were 

 sure that a discussion with her would be extremely exciting 

 and unusual, said Sarika Todi from the club.

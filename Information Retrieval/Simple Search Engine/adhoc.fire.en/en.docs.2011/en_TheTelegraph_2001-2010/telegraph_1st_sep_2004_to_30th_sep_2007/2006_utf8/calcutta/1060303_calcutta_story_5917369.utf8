 Short stories, mega hunt

 - Platform for aspiring authors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Riding the wave of fresh writing in English, Oxford Bookstore has launched its fourth edition of the online literary contest. 

 The e-Author version 4.0 is focussing on the short story genre and is being held in association with Reader?s Digest. 

 The three winning works will be published on www.oxfordbookstore.com and in Reader?s Digest. 

 ?The contest is aimed at people who have the itch to write but don?t have a platform to showcase their work. There?s also nobody to assess their work. So, we have a panel of judges who go through the writings and pick those with the potential of making it big,? says Apeejay Oxford Bookstores CEO Rajiv Chowdhry.

 The panel of judges for e-Author 4.0 comprises Reader?s Digest editor Ashok Mahadevan, senior commissioning editor of Penguin Books India Diya Kar Hazra, MP Jairam Ramesh, authors Kunal Basu and Samit Basu, and journalist Swapan Dasgupta.

 ?The judges would look at clarity of thought, a good subject, the element of excitement and the power to captivate the reader? The contest was on novel writing in the earlier years and we have changed the format this time. Maybe next year, we will go for poetry,? adds Chowdhry.

 From the 500 entries in the first year, the response climbed to over 3,000 in the last version, and Chowdhry expects it to cross the 5,000-mark this time.

 Launched last month in Delhi, the version 4.0 invites aspiring writers to send in a set of two original unpublished short stories, each within the 4,000-word limit, to eauthorapeejaygroup.com. 

 Entries can pour in till March 9. 

 The judges will go through the works and shortlist eight or 10 before picking the three finalists (to be declared on May 9) who will then have to submit three stories each. After a second round of judging, the three best works will be announced and published on the Oxford Bookstore website on August 21.

 While the winner takes home a cash prize of Rs 50,000, the first and second runner-up will be rewarded with Rs 30,000 and Rs 20,000, respectively.

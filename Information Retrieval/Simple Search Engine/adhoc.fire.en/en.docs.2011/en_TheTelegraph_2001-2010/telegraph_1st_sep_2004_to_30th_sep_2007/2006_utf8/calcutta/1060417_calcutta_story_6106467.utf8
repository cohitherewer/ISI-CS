The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Channels off beam again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 The hide-and-seek war over the STAR bouquet of channels continues among cable operators, multi-system operators (MSO) and the broadcaster, while viewers across the city stare at empty television screens.

 Channels like STAR Plus, STAR Movies, STAR Gold and National Geographic Channel vanished off MSO SitiCable?s network on Saturday midnight, in a repeat of a 24-hour ?token strike? observed by SitiCable and another MSO, Manthan, last month.

 Only this time, the beam block ? in protest of STAR?s ?high-handedness? ? is scheduled to extend beyond 24 hours, taking the count of STAR-less households in the city to around 75 per cent. 

 SitiCable viewers woke up on Sunday morning to see this message ? attributed to ?cable operators and associations? ? on their screens instead of some of their favourite channels: ?To protest against high-handedness of STAR in trying to extort more money, which is detrimental to the interest of consumers and cable operators, all STAR channels are not available on this network.?

 The channels, however, are available on Purvalaya (a south Calcutta arm of SitiCable), MSO CableComm and some households serviced by independent operators.

 STAR had switched off its feed to Manthan some time ago on account of disputes related to payment and contract renewal. 

 On March 17, SitiCable had made a similar move by switching off the STAR bouquet for 24 hours as a ?token strike?.

 Manthan and SitiCable are also locked in a legal battle with the broadcaster in the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal.

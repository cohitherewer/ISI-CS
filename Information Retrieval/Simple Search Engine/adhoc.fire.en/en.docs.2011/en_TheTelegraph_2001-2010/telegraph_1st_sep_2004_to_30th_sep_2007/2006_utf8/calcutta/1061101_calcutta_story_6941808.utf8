No buzz, not much media frenzy, no star shower and 

not even too many P3P footfalls the Lakme Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2007 got 

off to a quiet start at the NCPA in Mumbai at high noon.

Designer Narendra Kumar flagged off the week on Tuesday 

with a mens wear show, the high point of which was a ramp appearance by 

John Abraham, looking hot in a white linen suit with brushstrokes on the jacket, 

sporting a pair of dark glasses.

The only star presence in the front rows was yes, 

you guessed it right his lady love Bipasha Basu, dressed casually in red-and-blue 

printed trousers with a loose, white spaghetti top.

The clothes are just exceptional, and I am not 

saying that because I walked the ramp, smiled John. The colours are 

comfortable, the cuts are brilliant, the slim pants are very in I just loved 

the whole look and was very happy wearing the outfit, said the star who 

has been given a complete makeover by friend Nari (Narendra) for his 

forthcoming film Baabul.

My personal style statement was always very 

casual. But Nari has given me a totally new look, as you can see in the promos 

of Baabul. He has given me a very balanced look between casual and subdued 

formals. I sport a lot of earthy hues, whites and khakis in the movie, revealed 

the actor. 

As for Narendras mens wear collection, 

it took a tongue-in-cheek look at the recent explosion in the Indian 

art scene. These days, anyone with the right backing can pick up the brush 

and sell his works as art. The collection takes a look at where Indian art is 

heading, explained Narendra. The silhouettes were varied, linen was the 

mainstay of the fabric and the colours were subdued.

The second show of the day and the first womens 

wear collection of the fashion week was by Calcutta duo Dev and Nil. The boys 

from Howrah unveiled an impressive line titled Chocolate that talks about 

indulgence and the finer things in life.

The silhouettes were free-flowing lots of tunics, 

dresses (with bubble dresses dominating), pants, wrap-tops, some jackets and highly-stylised 

saris with waistbands. 

Extensive use of smocking, pleating, ruching, tone-on-tone 

texturisation, subtle embroidery and prints marked the collection.

Silk jersey was the primary fabric, along with other 

silk and cotton blends from the handlooms of Bengal. The colours were muted 

whites, off-whites, pale yellows and greens, with touches of red.

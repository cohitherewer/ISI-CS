 - CALCUTTA WILL MISS BIG SKY EVENTS

 One will occur only five times this century, while the other is this year?s first major astronomical event. But the chances of Calcuttans catching a glimpse of either range from slim to nil.

 First up is the penumbral lunar eclipse of March 15, which will be best visible from Europe and Africa. The eclipse starts at 2.52 am and ends at 7.44 am for Calcutta.

 ?A penumbral lunar eclipse is, anyway, difficult to see. But in the case of Calcutta, the totality of the eclipse ? 4.48 am to 5.48 am ? would be during sunrise,? explained Debiprosad Duari, director, research amp; academics, MP Birla Planetarium.

 But in case you are desperate for a dekko, look for a ?subtle yet distinct shading? across the southern half of the moon, advises Duari. In all likelihood, however, the one-in-five occurrences in the 21st Century will be a miss for the city.

 There is at least some hope of taking a closer look at the next big event in the sky, the total solar eclipse on March 29. Calcutta, with a two per cent view of the eclipse, loses out to places like Amritsar, which will have a 40 per cent view.

 For the city, the eclipse starts at 5.02 pm and ends at 5.45 pm, with the peak at 5.24 pm. ?Sunset occurs at 5.45 pm in Calcutta, so it will be difficult to distinguish between the fading sunlight and the eclipse part,? Duari said.

 Looking even at a setting Sun for a long time can cause irreparable eye damage. A telescope and projection system or a telescope fitted with a solar filter is recommended.

 The total eclipse will be visible from within a narrow corridor traversing half the Earth. The path of the moon?s umbral shadow begins in Brazil and extends across the Atlantic, northern Africa and central Asia, where it ends in western Mongolia.

 ?Countries like Libya, Egypt, Turkey and Mongolia will be able to catch the full eclipse, lasting three minutes, and currently there is a major rush for these destinations from across the world,? Duari said.

 The next total solar eclipse, though not fully visible from India, will occur on August 1, 2008. India will get lucky on July 22, 2009, when the path of totality passes through India, Nepal, China and Central Pacific.

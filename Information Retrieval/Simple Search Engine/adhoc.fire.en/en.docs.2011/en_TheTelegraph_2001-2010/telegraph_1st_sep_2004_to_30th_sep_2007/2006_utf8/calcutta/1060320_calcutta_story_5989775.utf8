 The other Bong connection

 Emraan Hashmi and Kangna in Gangster;

 He would have loved to have lived this day. But as destiny would have it, when the rest of the country finally gets the first flavour of the sheer musical genius of Goutam Chattopadhyay, the Mohiner Ghoraguli man is not around to revel in the recognition.

 His philosophical fable Prithibi, which has till now resonated through the voices of many a Bangla band, has found a new pan-Indian form in Bheegi bheegi, the latest chartbuster from Anurag Basu?s new Bollywood potboiler Gangster. Starring Shiney Ahuja, Emraan Hashmi and newcomer Kangna, the Bhatt production is loosely based on the romance between Abu Salem and Monica Bedi.

 ?I remember I used to sing Prithibi a lot on the FTII campus when I was studying there,? recalls music director Pritam, who has recreated the Goutam Chattopadhyay song for Gangster. ?Then I have played the song many times in my stint as the guitarist of the band Jotugriher Pakhi. When Anurag and I were planning the music of Gangster, we felt that the feel of the music of Prithibi was ideal for the film and so we went and bought the rights from Asha Audio.?

 Once the copyrights were bought and Minati, wife of the late Goutam Chattopadhyay, gave the film-makers the nod, Pritam went about restructuring the song. ?I kept the basic tune but completely changed the orchestration,? explains the composer still known as the Dhoom man. ?With the new words ? by lyricist Mayur Puri ? the song became very different. If Prithibi was philosophical, Bheegi bheegi is more of a song of longing.?

 Who should sing the track became a major problem. ?The known version of Prithibi was sung by Krosswindz?s Bonnie and he did a very good job,? says Pritam. ?Initially I wanted to have Bonnie singing the Hindi version as well but Anurag felt Bangladeshi rock icon James would lend a different attitude to the song. Anurag is a big fan of his music and has one of his hard rock tracks Kali kali playing on his car stereo all the time.?

 But making James sing Bheegi bheegi was not easy. ?We couldn?t trace him at all,? recalls Pritam. ?Anurag sent one of his mashis to Bangladesh to look for him. Once we found him, there were visa problems. Finally, when we got him down, James wasn?t too keen to sing a Hindi song since he didn?t know the language. We wrote the song in Bengali script and even got him drunk. Once James was stoned, he came up with an incredible rendition.?

 At the end of it all, Pritam is happy with the way Prithibi has been recreated. ?I have never worked so hard on a single track since I realised it was one huge responsibility,? he confesses. ?I could f*** up with other songs but not this one. I was aware of the cult status of the song in Bengal and my challenge was to make the people there like the new version. I hope I haven?t done injustice to Goutamda in any way. I would say, in terms of emotions, Bheegi bheegi is on a par with the original.?

 The other Gangster track which is being played with the TV teaser these days is Tu hi meri shab hai, picturised on Emraan and Kangna. ?We tried the song with a lot of other people but we kept the KK version for the album because he sang it so purely and innocently,? reveals Pritam. ?I would call the song a modern ghazal with some great words by Sayed Quadri.?

 There?s also a Sufi number called Ya Ali sung by Assamese singing sensation Zubin. ?I had brought him down just to sing the aalap but he sang the lines so well, that we went ahead with him,? says Pritam. ?Kailash Kher was supposed to sing the song but he had to go off for an international tour. For the picturisation in Seoul, I had sung a scratch version of the same. Emraan liked it so much that he insisted that I sing it on the album also. But I didn?t want to take such a big risk. Also, Himesh (Reshammiya) gaichhe bolei ki amake gaite hobe?? 

 This is the first time the two Bengalis Anurag and Pritam are working together in a film even though they have known each other for almost a decade now. ?Since now we stay in the same complex in Goregaon, we get to interact a lot more. So the music of Gangster was created in the gardens, dolnay dultey dultey,? Pritam smiles.

 Will the nation now swing to the tunes and will the Goutam Chattopadhyay legacy grow with Gangster?

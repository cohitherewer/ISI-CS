 Kabul Express is not the only Indian film to have made it to this years Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF). The third edition of the festival, which started last Sunday and will go on till next Sunday, will see Bollywoods best sharing the red carpet with international stars.

 Shivani Pandya, DIFFs managing director, said: Dubai is fast becoming an important market for Indian cinema, contributing massively to its box-office revenues. The festival hopes to assist in the growth of this market and with the support of the Indian industry we feel we have a winning formula.

 Shah Rukh Khan himself will be a guest of honour at DIFF this year and will receive a DIFF Salutes trophy for his lifelong contribution to cinema during a special presentation entitled A Conversation with Shah Rukh Khan at the Madinat Theatre.

 Upping the glam quotient will be Kangana Ranaut, the Reddy sisters Sameera and Sushama and the talented Ayesha Dharker. They will be sharing the limelight with the likes of Diane Kruger, Ivana Milicevic and Maria Grazia Cuccinota. 

 Kabul Express men John 

 Abraham and Arshad Warsi will be there too. Irrfan will 

 be at the festival with Mira Nairs The Namesake (picture 

 above). Dev Anand and Mohanlal will add weight to the event. 

 Big names from world cinema expected in Dubai include Oliver 

 Stone, Richard Gere, Moss Deff, Barry Osbourne, Joshua Jackson 

 and Lawrence Fishburne.

 Representing diversity of subcontinent cinema and encapsulating the art and spirit of the region will be Anjan Dutts The Bong Connection, Rajnash Domalpallis Vanaja, Nagesh Kukunoors Dor, John Jeffcoats Outsourced and Mani Ratnams Iruvar.

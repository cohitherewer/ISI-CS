 Then a child woman foraying into films, now a mother with her daughter as co-star. In between, three-odd decades have passed, but Mousumi Chatterjee hardly seems to feel the passage of time.

 ?I was in Class VI when I did Balika Bodhu. That was some 30 years ago... But I am not feeling the gap of time at all,? says Mousumi, back in town to shoot for her second film with Tarun Majumder after Balika Bodhu.

 In Bhalobashar Anek Naam, Majumder is introducing her Mumbai-born daughter Megha Mukherjee. The film also stars Uttam Kumar?s grandson Gourav, Soumitra Chatterjee and Tapas Pal.

 ?I play a lonely housewife (of Tapas Pal). Gourav is drawn to me as he finds some similarity with his long-lost elder sister. I misunderstand his affection at first, but soon realise my mistake,? says Mousumi, a cousin sister to her daughter in the film.

 ?I think Megha is fortunate that she?s got to learn from Tarunda? They (Majumder and his team) are very happy? It?s like history repeating itself. We have the same guru. And it?s also so nostalgic. I had shot for Balika Bodhu in Bolpur. And so many old residents who had seen me shooting for Balika Bodhu came to see me while we were shooting for Bhalobashar Anek Naam there,? adds Mousumi.

 For her daughter, shooting for her debut film has been smooth sailing. ?I am taking it as it comes. It?s a good learning experience,? says the granddaughter of Hemanta Mukhopadhyay. Though she had been offered a few Bollywood films, Megha turned them all down.

 ?I never thought I was cut out for acting. I had a flair for it though,? says she, having taken acting lessons from Kishore Namit Kapoor. ?Tarun Majumder had seen me at the Bengali Film Festival in Baltimore sometime last year. But I was very scared when he wanted to cast me in his film because being brought up in Bombay, I hadn?t seen much of Bengali films. And I also wanted to pursue modelling. But I took the plunge because it was a Tarun Majumder film and my mother was in it,? says Megha, playing a chirpy village girl who finds love from leading man Gourav.

 ?Mom has been very helpful. She is less of a co-star and more of a mother. She gives me tips but she doesn?t enforce anything on me,? says Megha. The duo will shoot for five more days at Technician?s.

 Before going on the floors, Megha worked on her Bengali diction by watching films ? ?my mother?s Ogo Bodhu Sundari, which is an all-time favourite, Satyajit Ray?s Teen Kanya and others?.

 Back in Mumbai, high on her agenda is making a mark as a model, both on the ramp and in commercials. ?I found I was quite photogenic and I also have the height (5 ft 6.5 inches), so I want to try ramp walk,? says she.

 Her mother, meanwhile, will get busy with two films ? Tanuja Chandra?s Rocking, co-starring Sushmita Sen, and a Hindi film by Basu Chatterjee. 

 Both focus on her funny side. ?In Rocking, I have a double role of two sisters ? one serious and one comic. In Basu Chatterjee?s film, I play a wife who is very possessive about her ugly husband (Satish Kaushik),? laughs Mousumi, adding: ?I wish Tarunda makes a comedy with me some day.?

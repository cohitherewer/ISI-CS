The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Cancelled flights and rigid checks

 Passengers stranded at Heathrow airport, London, on Saturday (Reuters)

 Kindly carry minimum amount of hand baggage to facilitate security screening.

 The message on the electronic information board outside the domestic and international terminals of Calcutta airport prepared fliers for the stringent security checks that were to follow. 

 Reports of long queues and security screenings, from the entrance to the ladder, had compelled most of them reach the airport much earlier than usual. The situation mirrored that at Heathrow, where the British Airways flight to Calcutta on Saturday was cancelled due to delay in security procedures. The Air-India flight on the route was also cancelled, but due to technical reasons, claimed an airline official.

 Consequently, the Calcutta-London flights of both airlines were cancelled on Sunday. 

 I normally come to the airport half-an-hour before check-in. Today, I came two hours before the departure, said Hari Menon, a city-based trader on the way to Mumbai on a Jet Airways flight. 

 S. Ahmed, 17, who had gone to New Delhi to visit relatives, returned on an Air Sahara flight. It took me more than an hour to clear the security at Delhi airport, he stated. 

 With liquids and gels barred on board, children are being forced to go without milk on flights. The security men told us we cannot carry the bottle of milk with us, complained Izima Khandinanle of Mizoram, who took the Indian flight from Aizawl to the city with her three-year-old grandson Chimi. 

 We are prepared for any eventuality, asserted K.N. Tripathi, CISF commandant at Calcutta airport. The airlines, too, have chipped in. Ladder-point frisking has been intensified, said an official of Indian.

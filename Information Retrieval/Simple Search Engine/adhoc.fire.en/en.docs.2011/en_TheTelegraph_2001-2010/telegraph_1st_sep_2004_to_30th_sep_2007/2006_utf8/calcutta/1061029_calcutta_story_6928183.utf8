 What: 59 Minutes, 

 a fashion and music presentation by ABN Amro Bank.

 Where: The Oberoi Grand Ballroom.

 When: Friday evening, 7.30 pm onwards.

 Take a look: Hosted by Van Gogh Preferred Banking of ABN Amro, the evening saw a fashion show by designers Snehasish Bhattacharya and Abhishek Dutta, with a musical interlude by Zubin Garg.

 Zubin, the Assamese boy of Ya Ali fame, kicked off the evening with two of his tracks Rabbi from Zindaggi Rocks and Piya milan ko from Strings. The fashion show was divided into five themes Mughal Era, British Influence, Khadi Revolution, Babus and Bibis, and Bohemian Street.

 Starting off with the Mughal theme, Snehasish showcased an elegant collection of saris, lehngas, sherwanis and kurta-pyjamas. Lots of white with tonal embroidery and flashes of gold and brighter hues defined the look, moving on to a brighter palette of reds, blues and purples with all-over intricate embroidery.

 Next up was Abhisheks interpretaion of the theme cocktail saris with halter blouses and lehngas in flowy fabrics with a generous sprinkling of embroidery mixed with sequins, beads, leather patches, crocheted edges and more. The colours were bright blue, pink, purple, green

 Abhishek then displayed British Influence with a fusion line of dresses and skirts. A lot of texturisation and layering with Abhisheks trademark embroidery made up the look. The silhouettes comprised knee-length dresses with high waistlines, often empire lines. The colours were duller pinks and lavender with touches of turquoise.

 Snehasish came next, interpreting Khadi Revolution. Saris and kurta-pyjamas with touches of kantha work, applique and other threadwork formed this line. The colours were muted ashes, browns, whites, dull reds and blacks and the look was very khadi. In this line he introduced some half-and-half saris with different bodies and pleats and carried it forward to the Babus and Bibis collection. Half-and-half saris in combinations like white and red, white and black, red and black were the the show-stealers of the whole evening. The mens wear range in this sequence was much more ornate with kurtas in brighter bases like orange and turquoise boasting elaborate embroidery, teamed with churidars, dhotis and chaddars.

 Abhishek finished the show with the Bohemian Street look, a collection that screamed out the designers signature. The out-and-out western line boasted skirts knee-length, calf-length, layered, asymmetrical, flared minis, cropped jackets, ruched capris, structured tops, mens jackets and lots of denims. The overall look was very structured and the highlights were the use of leather, face prints and prominent pockets.

 The show was punctuated by Zubins hit numbers like Ya Ali and Tu hi meri shab hai from Gangster, Rama re from Kaante and a Sufi song.

 Modelwatch: The clothes were paraded by models including Viveka Babajee, Deepti Gujral, Amrita, Joy, Sanchita, Tanusree, Arjita and Neeraj, along with actresses Rimjhim Mitra, Chaiti Ghoshal and Locket Chatterjee, and actor Rishi Kaushik.

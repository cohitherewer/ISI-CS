 On a day Citu mobilised its supporters for the December 14 strike, a 25-year-old leader of the organisation was shot dead by a gang in a police camp at Lalkuthi, in Dum Dum Park, early on Sunday morning.

 The two National Volunteer Force (NVF) personnel present in the camp had to remain mute witnesses, being armed only with lathis.

 Gopal Rajbanshi, secretary of the Citu-affiliated bus workers union on routes 12C and 12C/2, worked as starter of private buses.

 The incident took place around 8 am. A few criminals fired at Gopal, alias Potla, while he was going to work, said superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar.

 Chased by the gang, Gopal ran into the police camp, where the assailants fired at him through the window grilles. 

 Local residents took him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

 Kumar said two local youths, Binay Roy and Bimal Rajbanshi, have been arrested in connection with the murder. Local residents, however, claimed that two more Samir Manna, 23, and Amar Goswami, 37 have been picked up.

 The police superintendent said a departmental probe has been ordered to find out the role of the NVF men during the murder.

 Krishna Rajbanshi, 55, Gopals mother, said her son left home around 7.45 am after breakfast. 

 From our house, I could see a few youths chasing him. They must have been hiding somewhere near our home.

 Police and residents of the locality differed on Gopals background and the possible reason for the murder.

 An officer of the local Lake Town police said the Citu leader was a victim of the rivalry between the gangs of Hatkata Dilip and Pinaki Mitra. Dilips gang was losing its share of extortion money to Gopal.

 A section of local residents, however, portrayed Gopal as a good Samaritan, who was engaged in organising self-help groups with unemployed youth. 

 Thanks to his success, the local youths were gradually turning away from the gangsters, who would earlier engage them in criminal activities. That prompted the gangsters to join hands to kill Gopal, the residents alleged.

 The mall-multiplex mania is crossing the river. Coming up, just off Foreshore Road, is 400,000 sq ft of retail space with a glass-dome central atrium, sleek steel arches, a plush plex, food stops, multi-level parking for over 400 cars and a terrace garden with a waterfront view.

 Work on the Rs 120-crore Avani Riverside Mall is slated to commence in June, subject to clearances, with a 24-month completion schedule. ?Our pledge is to deliver an upmarket mall that residents of Howrah can be proud of,? Anirudh Daga, managing director of Avani Group, told Metro.

 Pantaloons and Big Bazaar will be the shopping anchors, having taken up 120,000 sq ft. Fame of Shringar Cinemas, having signed up 70,000 sq ft, will do the ?four or six-screen? plex.

 Shringar is also setting up the 25,000-sq-ft food court. Through international property consultants Trammell Crow Meghraj, the developers have also tied up with brands like My Dollar Store, Provogue, Gatha, K-Lounge, Raymond, W, Levi?s and Biba.

 Avani Group is confident the huge pent-up demand for formatted retail and quality entertainment on the other side of the river will make the Riverside Mall a hit. ?The retail potential in Howrah and its suburban areas of Shibpur, Andul and Shalimar is extremely high, and there are no exit options. People often cross the river just to catch a movie,? stresses Daga.

 Mainland China will bring its quick-service Chinese cuisine format Haka to the mall, while Big Mac ?has also evinced interest?, according to Daga. Talks are on with a clutch of mid-range and small brands as well.

 The large footprint (110,000 sq ft on each floor) and ?meticulous retail zoning? to prevent clutter are the other highlights of the mall, designed by J.P. Agrawal of Forum fame.

 Besides speciality and multi-cuisine restaurants, there will be cafeterias and fast-food points, a kids? zone for games, activities and toys and a terrace garden with two dedicated elevators. ?We plan to hold music concerts and other entertainment events on the terrace, which offers a great setting,? says Daga.

 With the cry for including Howrah in an integrated approach towards regeneration of the riverfront growing stronger, the Riverside Mall can act as a catalyst to that effect, feel urban planning experts.

 And the location could well turn out to be a pull rather than a push factor for some Calcuttans, argue the developers, with the prospect of a drive across Vidyasagar Setu drawing them to the mall.

 Based on a story by Taslima Nasreen, Aitijhya Natyapeeth?s production, Phera, makes a strong statement against communalism, offering compassion and understanding as the answer to communal forces. With a soul-stirring tale evoking sympathy in the minds of the audience, the play brings to light the loss of values, ideals and morals in modern life, that are responsible for the corruption and disintegration of society. It unfolds the unhappy circumstances befalling Kalyani, the protagonist, who had tried to escape the troubles of her present by returning to the days of her past. Hurt and humiliated, she is compelled to accept the truth of her present position in life. She realizes, perhaps a little too late, that though pleasant memories of her past can provide her solace from the harsh realities of the present, she has no choice but to encounter immediate challenges. A virtual stranger, Badal, finally helps her find her life?s direction. Directed by Himangshu Das. The staging of Phera will be followed by Taslima Nasreen?s commentary on the story, along with a session in which she reads out her own poems.

 Event: Play in Bengali, Phera, produced by Aitijhya Natyapeeth; poetry-reading by Taslima Nasreen 

When: Today at 6.30 pm

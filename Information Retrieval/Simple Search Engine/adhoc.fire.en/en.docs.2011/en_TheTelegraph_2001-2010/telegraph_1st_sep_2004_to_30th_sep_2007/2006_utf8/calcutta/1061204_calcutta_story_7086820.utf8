Asim Majumdar: Why you have rolled back your service Plan 100? Do you have any proposal to introduce it again?

 Before the introduction of broadband services, we had offered Plan 100 to professors, college teachers, and government and bank employees. Plan 99 was introduced for students and researchers, to offer them Internet service at a cheaper rate. It was a relatively slow dial-up service and had a few shortcomings. For instance, as long as you surf the Net, you cannot use your telephone for any other purpose.

 Now, we are offering you a better, swifter and more economical broadband service with which you can talk to people while surfing the Net on your computer.

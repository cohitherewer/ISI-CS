The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Countdown calendar

 - Itll be a special Sunday. Dedicate it to fun, food, fashion, family and friends

 A STAFF REPORTER

 TGIS Thank god its Sunday. What better way to bid 2006 goodbye and beat the Monday morning blues by waking up to a whole new year? And heres how you can make the most of the special Sunday.

 Beginning early

 Dedicate the day to great food, fashion, friends and family, whether indoors or out. And start early. Ill be spending all day with my kids with a lazy lunch at Tolly Club and then a game session at Timbaktoo in Forum, says actress June.

 If movies mean merry, then Happy Feet it is. Sing along with Glorias heartsongs or tap your feet to Mumbles impromptu jigs and just march with the penguins. But if Bollywood is your choice, go gape at Hrithik (or Ash or Bips) one more time in Dhoom:2.

 Last-minute fashionistas can do some stylish shopping for the finishing touch or binge on beauty pick-me-ups. Book yourselves for a glow facial, body spa, blow dry and manicure to feel like a million dollars, suggests beauty expert Bridgette Jones.

 The men could do with a head massage and pedicure one to help keep their cool and the other to keep them on their feet, all night long.

 If food is more your thing, end the year by lunching out at any of the fancy food festivals and brunch buffets in town. Spend the rest of the day doing nothing till its time to get ready for the party in balloon dress and bling for her, funky shirt and jackets for him. (Note: the weatherman predicts no Celsius slide, so a flash of well-toned flesh is on the 31st cards.)

 Ending late

 The city will be one big party zone, sunset to sunrise. There will be no better hotspot than clubs hosting The Telegraph 31st Nite parties, from RCGC to Space Circle, Tollygunge Club to CC amp;FC to DI, and Saturday Club to Calcutta Club.

 The other popular parties would be 40 Thieves After Dark at Nalban, The Glamorous New Years Eve at Venom and the long line-up at The Park. Police, however, have warned that bars and discs must wind up by 2 am. Only those on five-star premises can carry on partying till 4 am. (Also note: Park Street will be a no-parking zone on Sunday night.)

 Staying in

 Those at home can pour the wine, fill the popcorn bucket and switch on STAR Movies at 9 pm for George Lucass Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Or go the Bolly way with Sonys Jhoom Ke Aaja 2007 starring Salman, Priyanka, Bipasha... If you opt for a musical farewell to 2006, zap to STAR World for the American Music Awards, live.

 Staying in does not mean staying out of party plans for those going big with private parties. I have invited about 85 people home for kebabs and drinks. We friends rather be all together to bring in 2007, says 22-year-old Shiv Burman.

 The resolution

 Its that cliche time of the year again. But this time, forget the diet plans and say NO to bandhs in 2007.

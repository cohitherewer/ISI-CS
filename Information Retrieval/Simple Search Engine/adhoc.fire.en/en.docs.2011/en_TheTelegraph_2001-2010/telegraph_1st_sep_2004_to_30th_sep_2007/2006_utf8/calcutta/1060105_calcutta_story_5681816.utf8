 Ganesh Pyne: Evolution of the artist. Picture 

by Pabitra Das

 A painting by Ganesh Pyne that will be on 

display at CIMA Gallery 

 In an interview nearly two decades ago, at a time when he lived in a dark lane of Colootolla closer to north than central Calcutta, Ganesh Pyne had declared that his art would remain immutable, resisting fads and the follies of fashion. The artist, whose most easily identifiable themes are death, dream and the whirligig of time, has remained steadfast in his resolve. Pyne?s work has evolved over the years ? his palette has become lighter, one catches glimpses of decorative interiors, and in a way he has developed the resolve to fix his gaze on life in the raw. 

 But in its essence, Pyne?s art still draws its enchantment from the oneiric world where the real becomes indistinguishable from the unreal and death is not equated with negation. It is as much a creative force as life. Such thoughts could cross the mind of a viewer as one takes in some of Pyne?s latest works, to be exhibited at CIMA Gallery in a rare one-person show from Friday evening.

 Pyne, too, is in agreement with this viewpoint. ?The identity of an artist is the work he has done all his life. There have been many new waves in the field of art, such as conceptual art. I don?t feel that it is necessary for an artist to follow any of these trends,? insists Pyne.

 Most of the works were executed in the past two to three years, the oldest dating back to 1997. Some of these are undated jottings ? random sketches, along with occasional quotations on small graph sheets ? some of which he develops into full-blown paintings.

 Grim as the world of Pyne?s temperas has always been, it was tempered by the magical play of light and shadows and a lyricism that drew its inspiration from the sordid realities of middle-class Bengali life. Yet, he always averted his gaze from in-your-face ugliness.

 This time, however, one of Pyne?s most striking images is that of the bestial Neighbour who is a cross between a Yahoo and Caliban. The squat, naked ? Pyne has not shied away from depicting his sex organ ? and hairy creature inhabits the darkness of the unconscious.

 The beast stares squint-eyed at the viewer. He is the personification of our animal instincts, a reminder of the brutality that is inherent in the mental make-up of all human beings.

 In a similar embittered vein, a smile does not warm the cockles of our heart. A huge skull occupying the entire canvas breaks into a terrifying grin. The monochromatic profile of woman has the sharp edges of a cleaver and her rictus reveals a set of pearly whites that would become any carnivore. It could have been the face of a succubus or the visage of the Gorgon that he had so hauntingly conjured up in one of his very early self-portraits.

 This woman is in stark contrast with the genteel beauties in frilly blouses, harking back to the Rabindranath that Pyne loves to depict.

 Death does not spare them, either. Even when he depicts a decorative domestic setting ? so much a part of Pyne?s new life after marriage ? death lurks as a shadow-like form or an insect fatally drawn to a flame. While painting the insects, Pyne draws upon his skills as an animated cartoon artist. Early in his career, he had been trained as such by his mentor Mandar Mallik. ?The world of cartoons extended the sphere of my imagination. From creepies and crawlies, I could draw the sun and other heavenly bodies as well,? he says.

 In another work, the corpse of a man, perhaps a pilgrim, or even the great sage who began the Bhakti movement, lies dead with his staff next to him. His ribcage stands revealed through his putrefying flesh, while his head has turned into a skull.

 Sri Krishna Chaitanya, whose golden image haunted Pyne?s childhood world, appears in another tempera. A grim, severe and upright man, he is a far cry from the popular calendar deity. He stands between the carcass of a flayed human being and a lamp fashioned out of human bones with five flickering tongues of flame. He is the personification of the ?idea?, a man in whom his idealism had reached its apogee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

 Hot celebs 

 make for hotter scents 

 - International glamour, not Bollywood glitz, rules fragrance retail racks

 Jennifer Lopez: Prime perfume

 Where does J.Lo kayo the King Khan and Britney Spears beat the Big B hollow? 

 On the retail fragrance racks around town, of course.

 Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan may sell more multiplex tickets and push more products than any other national icon, but when it comes to following the scent of the celeb, they don?t stand a whiff of a chance against the Jennifer Lopezs and the David Beckhams.

 With 11 weeks to go for World Cup 2006, the English soccer captain?s signature perfume Instinct is flying off the Shoppers? Stop shelves in the first week of its India debut at Calcutta. And there is no sign of either SK or Tiger Eyes by SRK, or of Amitabh B.

 ?Though Amitabh and Shah Rukh have huge mass appeal, their kind of pull doesn?t apply to the targeted luxury goods user,? reasons Naveen Misra, unit head of Shoppers? Stop, Elgin Road. 

 The present perfume popularity count in Calcutta reads like this:

 Four brands by Jennifer Lopez ? Live, Still, Glow 

 and Miami ? priced at Rs 2,900, Rs 3,900, Rs 2,930 and Rs 

 3,000 for 100 ml bottles

 David Beckham Instinct, 75 ml for Rs 2,100 

 Curious by Britney Spears, 100 ml for Rs 2,700

 Cindy Crawford, 100 ml for Rs 2,300.

 Shah Rukh Khan: Taking a nose-dive 

Clearly, when it comes to star scent, international glamour rules the racks here, from Westside to Pantaloons, Shoppers? Stop to Exclusive Lines.

 Subhashis Dutta, eastern regional head of Harmony, distributor of brands like Calvin Klein, Aigner and Police in India, questions the very logic of celebrity endorsement. ?The overall pull of the brand is more important than the celebrity. Also, a name limits its audience to specific fans and their like. For example, a Ronaldo fan may not venture near a Beckham product,? he argues. 

 Dipali Prasad, corporate communications manager, Baccarose, a house that deals in Tommy Hilfiger, Burberry, Elizabeth Arden and Britney Spears products, feels that lending a celebrity name does ?increase initial noise?, but it?s the power of the fragrance that steers sales figures in the long run.

 If every flavour of Instinct bearing the ?dvb? ? David Victoria Beckham ? logo is said to enjoy the exclusive approval of the Real Madrid star, celebrities are often roped in to just lend their face to a fragrance.

 Case in point: True Star by Tommy Hilfiger. If singer Enrique Iglesias lent his face to the men?s cologne, Beyonce Knowles did her bit for women?s brand. Priced at Rs 2,800 and Rs 2,935 for 100 ml for the male and female fragrances, they move quite well from the city racks.

 Christian Dior, in fact, has never used a name to launch a perfume. ?We did once consider asking Sanjay Dutt to endorse Fahrenheit but then, he would have got way more publicity out of it,? smiles Fiona Caroline, national training manager of Dior in India.

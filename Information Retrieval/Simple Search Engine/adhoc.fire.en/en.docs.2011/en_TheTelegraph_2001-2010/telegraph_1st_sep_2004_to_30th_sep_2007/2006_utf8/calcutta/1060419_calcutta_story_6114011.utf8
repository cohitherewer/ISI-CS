 Interiors of Skydancer, 

 a private luxury yacht of The Park 

 Chairing a corporate board meeting on board a luxury yacht, savouring your favourite Italian Parmigiano cheese with a strong tannic Cabernet Sauvignon at your best friends anniversary bash, or simply sunbathing on the upper-deck on a lazy winter afternoon ? All, aboard the Skydancer on the Hooghly.

 Apeejay Charter Pvt Ltd, a part of the Apeejay Surrendra Group, has acquired Skydancer, a 55-ft private luxury yacht for The Park, Calcutta.

 The mid-sized vessel is the first of its kind to anchor in the city port and is being used exclusively for the guests of The Park.

 The pleasure yacht has been manufactured and custom-designed by UAE-based Gulf Craft Inc, a global leader in the segment. 

 It arrived by ship from Dubai to Chennai and then cruised down to Calcutta.

 We are happy to introduce this luxury concept to Calcutta. 

 As a boutique hotel, our principle is to try and redefine luxury continuously. The private yacht is an ultimate international style statement and will propel hospitality and luxury to another level, says Salmoli Mukerji, director, public relations, The Park Hotels.

 Ambassador 55, the top-of-the-line boat with a fully moulded fibreglass body, is a model from the brand of Majestic Boats created by Gulf Craft, and features luxurious indoor and outdoor options. 

 The star address is looking at using the yacht for private parties, offbeat corporate conclaves, birthday bashes and small get-togethers.

 Skydancer has a centrally air-conditioned living area, a lounge with two spaciously appointed cabins with well-fitted bathrooms and a pantry. The interiors are furnished with fine wood, carpet, leather and fabric, and supported by latest communication systems like satellite TV, e-mail and fax.

 The plush salon uses a studied lighting concept, with careful choice of upholstery, a blend of hand-crafted burl and cherry wood, Roman shade curtains, the partially recessed decorative ceiling, to comfortably entertain up to 15 guests, according to a Park spokesperson.

 While the open upper-deck can be used for sunbathing, a very contemporary fly-bridge with covered seating area offers a splendid river view.

 A customised extended swimming 

 platform completes the stylish, elegant look. The yacht 

 is fully manned by a trained crew, complete 

 with all five-star luxury services and a personal butler 

 in attendance.
